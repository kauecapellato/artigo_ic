0,07/02/2021,22:26,Leipzig face in-form Wolfsburg in Cup quarters,"RB Leipzig will face Wolfsburg in the quarter-finals of the German Cup after Sunday's draw, while Borussia Moenchengladbach will host Borussia Dortmund in the other all-Bundesliga tie.","Leipzig are second in Germany's top division while Wolfsburg are third and on a run of five straight wins in league and cup. The other top flight side left in the competition, Werder Bremen, will travel to second-tier Jahn Regensburg as clubs eye a cup that looks much more winnable with Bayern Munich out of the way. Bayern's conquerers at the last-32 stage Holstein Kiel have been rewarded for their penalty shootout win over Darmstadt in the last 16 with a trip to Rot-Weiss Essen, who play in the fourth division. Essen will likely be no pushover however after having knocked out Bayer Leverkusen, Arminia Bielefeld and second division team Fortuna Duesseldorf in previous rounds. Quarter-final draw, matches to be played March 2 and 3: RB Leipzig v Wolfsburg Borussia Moenchengladbach v Borussia Dortmund Jahn Regensburg v Werder Bremen Rot-Weiss Essen v Holstein Kiel"
1,16/01/2021,21:03,Leipzig blow chance to knock Bayern off top of Bundesliga,RB Leipzig were left rueing their squandered chance to replace Bayern Munich as Bundesliga leaders on Saturday after being held to a 2-2 draw at Wolfsburg.,"For the second consecutive Saturday, Leipzig, who lost 3-1 last weekend at home to Borussia Dortmund, missed out on first place. ""It's tough, you always have to deliver and when you look at the other results, three points would have been great,"" Leipzig coach Julian Nagelsmann said. ""I am sure Leverkusen and Dortmund would say the same thing,"" he added after rivals Bayer Leverkusen lost at Union Berlin on Friday while Dortmund drew at home to Mainz. ""There are a lot of good teams in the league and you have to go to your limits each time."" Embattled Bayern, who crashed to a 3-2 league defeat at Borussia Moenchengladbach and were then dumped out of the German Cup in midweek, host Freiburg on Sunday. They stay a point ahead in the table. Nagelsmann's men got off to a great start when Nordi Mukiele gave them an early lead after converting a pass from Emil Forsberg. However, Wolfsburg roared back with goals from Wout Weghorst and Renato Steffen, whose shot clipped the chest of Leipzig defender Willi Orban on its way into the net. Orban made amends when he tapped home Leipzig's equaliser in the second half. Fourth-placed Dortmund also dropped points as captain Marco Reus missed a late penalty in their 1-1 draw at home to strugglers Mainz, who climbed off the bottom. ""I could have decided the game. I am very, very sorry,"" said a crestfallen Reus, who buried his face in his shirt after firing wide from the spot 15 minutes before the final whistle. ""The disappointment is huge. We wanted to climb the table and we've missed the chance to take another step."" Defender Levin Oztunali gave Mainz the lead when he beat Dortmund goalkeeper Roman Burki from 20 metres just after half-time. Belgium defender Thomas Meunier equalised, but Dortmund's 16-year-old striker Youssoufa Moukoko deserved credit for keeping the ball alive in the area and providing the crucial pass. Reus fired his spot-kick wide after a foul on Meunier in the area. Later, Stuttgart got the rub of the green on their new pitch as Silas Wamangituka converted a last-gasp penalty to earn a 2-2 draw with Moenchengladbach. Nagelsmann compared their pitch to a potato field after Leipzig's 1-0 away win a fortnight ago and Stuttgart reacted by spending 150,000 euros ($181,000) on a new surface which was laid Monday. Gladbach were 2-1 up deep into added time thanks to a Denis Zakaria effort, after Lars Stindl's spot-kick had been cancelled out when Nicolas Gonzalez scored Stuttgart's 3,000th Bundesliga goal. Wamangituka converted a 96th-minute penalty after VAR ruled Stuttgart forward Sasa Kalajdzic was fouled when he backed into Gladbach defender Ramy Bensebaini. Union are so far the only top five club to win this weekend after beating third-placed Leverkusen 1-0 in Berlin. Leverkusen were the second big name to crash in the capital city after Dortmund lost at Union last month. Union's home win was overshadowed by allegations of a racist slur aimed at Leverkusen midfielder Nadiem Amiri, which the hosts are investigating. On Saturday, Union signed 19-year-old winger Leon Dajaku on loan from Bayern Munich for the rest of the season. Werder Bremen claimed their first home victory since October with late goals in a 2-0 win at home to Augsburg. Bremen winger Felix Agu, 21, celebrated his first league start by setting up Czech defender Theodor Gebre Selassie before sealing the points with a goal of his own. ""There is nothing better, I really enjoyed that,"" said Agu, who had played a total of 91 minutes on his three previous league appearances. Hoffenheim drew 0-0 at home to Arminia Bielefeld while Cologne against Hertha Berlin finished in a goalless stalemate, with all four teams in the bottom six places."
2,01/01/2021,03:00,Haaland back in action as Bundesliga returns from mini-break,Borussia Dortmund striker Erling Braut Haaland is expected to make an eagerly awaited return from injury as his side look to battle back into the Bundesliga top four with a win over high-fliers Wolfsburg on Sunday.,"The prolific Norwegian prodigy has missed the last four league games and the last seven in all competitions after picking up a hamstring injury in early December. Yet the 20-year-old returned to team training this week, and Dortmund sporting director Michael Zorc confirmed that he would be back in action this weekend. ""Erling's recovery has gone well. We are working on the assumption that he can play against Wolfsburg,"" said Zorc. Haaland's return is timely, with his side in desperate need of a win after a miserable run of form before Christmas saw them drop to fifth in the table, eight points behind leaders Bayern Munich and two behind Sunday's opponents Wolfsburg. Dortmund sacked coach Lucien Favre after they were thrashed by promoted side Stuttgart in mid-December, before suffering a shock away defeat to minnows Union Berlin in their second game under caretaker boss Edin Terzic. Defeat to Wolfsburg would see Dortmund lose four home league games in a row for the first time in 20 years. ""The most important thing is that we start well and end well,"" said Haaland, who has scored 17 goals in 14 games in all competitions this season. In a season squashed by the coronavirus pandemic, many Bundesliga clubs have had just a week off in the shortest winter break in the league's history. Yet after their pre-Christmas cup tie was postponed until January, champions Bayern have had an extra week to recover and are expected to waltz past struggling Mainz on Sunday and defend their two-point lead at the top of the table. Second from bottom and without a win in six games, Mainz parted ways with both their coach and sporting director over Christmas. Huddersfield boss Jan Siewert will take the reins as interim coach against Bayern. There has also been a changing of the guard at bottom club Schalke, where new coach Christian Gross will take charge of his first game away to Hertha Berlin on Saturday. Former Tottenham and Stuttgart coach Gross has been charged with leading Schalke out of danger and ending their miserable winless streak of 29 games. Having not won since last January, the seven-time German champions are now just two games away from equalling Tasmania Berlin's unwanted record of 31 games without a win, set back in 1966. Fresh from his coronation as the world's best goalkeeper, the Bayern stopper is just one game away from equalling Oliver Kahn's club record of 196 Bundesliga clean sheets, a milestone he has been chasing in vain for more than two months. If he fails again to reach Kahn's mark against Mainz, Neuer will have gone nine league games without a clean sheet for only the second time in his Bayern career. 150 - RB Leipzig will celebrate their 150th Bundesliga game when they take on Stuttgart on Saturday. They have won 80 of them so far, more than any other German club at the same milestone. 50 - Weeks since Schalke's last Bundesliga win in January last year. The league's bottom club are just two games away from equalling Tasmania Berlin's unwanted record of 31 games without a win. 10 - Goals Erling Braut Haaland has scored in his eight league games for Borussia Dortmund this season. The Norwegian is set to make his first appearance in a month against Wolfsburg. Fixtures (all times 1430 GMT unless stated)"
3,24/12/2020,00:25,Bundesliga strugglers Mainz out of German Cup,"Crisis-hit Bundesliga club Mainz crashed out on penalties to second division side Bochum in the second round of the German Cup on Wednesday after Robert Tesche scored a dramatic, stoppage-time equaliser for the underdogs.","Jean-Paul Boetius and Danny Latza gave Mainz a comfortable 2-0 lead, but Bochum fought back through Gerrit Holtmann and a stoppage-time equaliser from Robert Tesche. Despite having goalkeeper Manuel Riemann sent off in stoppage time, the underdogs triumphed 3-0 in the penalty shootout after Mainz missed all their penalties. Defeat crowned a miserable Christmas week for Mainz, who sit second from bottom in the league and parted ways with sporting director Rouwen Schroeder on Tuesday. Elsewhere, Dutch striker Wout Weghorst scored twice as Wolfsburg thrashed second-tier minnows Sandhausen 4-0 in the second round of the German Cup Wednesday, despite losing numerous players to Covid-19 in recent days. With four players having tested positive for coronavirus in the last week and another three self-isolating, Wolfsburg were forced to list two reserve goalkeepers, Lino Kasten and Niklas Klinger, as outfield substitutes. Yet the top-flight side cruised to victory thanks to goals from Yannick Gerhardt, Joao Victor and Weghorst, who has now scored 11 goals in his last 11 games. ""My players showed from the first minute that they weren't going to worry about the difficult conditions and the absentees,"" said Wolfsburg coach Oliver Glasner. In Wednesday's other games, first-half goal from Sasa Kalajdzic saw Stuttgart to a 1-0 win over south-western neighbours Freiburg, while Werder Bremen waltzed to a 3-0 win over Hanover. In-form Rot-Weiss Essen are the last fourth-tier side left in the draw after they stunned second-division local rivals Fortuna Duesseldorf 3-2."
4,21/11/2020,23:11,Haaland scores four as Dortmund cut Bayern's lead,Erling Braut Haaland netted four goals and Youssoufa Moukoko became the youngest player in Bundesliga history on Saturday as Borussia Dortmund routed Hertha Berlin 5-2 to trim Bayern Munich's lead at the top of the table to just a point.,"It was the first time the 20-year-old Haaland had scored four goals in a game for Dortmund since his January debut, with all of them coming in the second half. ""I drank a Red Bull at half time, I got some wings and everything was good,"" said Haaland. The Norwegian now has 10 goals in seven Bundesliga matches this season to give him a total of 31 goals in 30 games in all competitions for Dortmund. After Matheus Cunha gave Hertha a first-half lead at Berlin's Olympic Stadium, Dortmund roared back. Haaland equalised when he tapped home an Emre Can pass on 47 minutes. He grabbed his second two minutes later with perfect timing to slip his marker and fire in a Julian Brandt pass. Haaland wrapped up his hat-trick on 62 minutes, just before Raphael Guerreiro stabbed the ball home from close range to make it 4-1. Cunha converted a late penalty, but the night belonged to Haaland who finished a move he started with 10 minutes to play. There was still time for history to be made as Moukoko made a late cameo off the Dortmund bench to replace Haaland. One day after his 16th birthday, Moukoko is the youngest player in Bundesliga history. ""He's only just turned 16 -- that is amazing,"" Haaland said of Moukoko. ""He has a big career ahead of him."" Dortmund's romp in Berlin moved them second in the standings, behind defending champions Bayern who stayed top despite a 1-1 home draw with Werder Bremen. Germany goalkeeper Manuel Neuer produced great stops to twice deny US forward Josh Sargent as Bremen earned their first point at Bayern for a decade. ""We had to invest a lot,"" Neuer told Sky. The 34-year-old bounced back after conceding six goals in Germany's crushing defeat by Spain in midweek with two brilliant first-half saves in quick succession. He used a boot to block a Sargent shot, then lunged across goal to save from Ludwig Augustinsson. In the dying stages, Neuer then stood tall to block a shot by Sargent, who had broken clear. Bayern coach Hansi Flick was far from pleased that Bremen took the lead in his 50th game in charge, saying his team ""have to defend better"". Bremen deservedly went ahead just before half-time when midfielder Maximilian Eggestein finished off a superb attack. ""We conceded a very cheap goal, that's how Bremen's plan worked and they defended very well,"" said Bayern forward Thomas Mueller. Kingsley Coman equalised in the 62nd minute at the Allianz Arena by meeting a Leon Goretzka cross at the far post. Bayern forward Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting fired over with the goal at his mercy five minutes from time. However, Neuer's heroics at the other end preserved the draw. Bayer Leverkusen are third after their 2-1 win at strugglers Arminia Bielefeld thanks to Aleksandar Dragovic's late winner. The victory was a relief for Leverkusen goalkeeper Lukas Hradecky, who scored a embarrassing own goal early in the second half. Leverkusen were 1-0 up thanks to a Leon Bailey goal when Hradecky sliced a clearance, which rolled into the empty net behind him. Dragovic stabbed home from close range two minutes from time to spare Hradecky's blushes. RB Leipzig sit fourth after Yussuf Poulsen came off the bench and produced a deft second-half volley in their 1-1 draw at Eintracht Frankfurt after winger Aymen Barkok gave the hosts an early lead. Despite having seven players quarantined with the coronavirus, a depleted Hoffenheim drew 3-3 at home with Stuttgart. Schalke's winless run stretched to 24 league games, dating back to January, after losing 2-0 at home to Wolfsburg. A Daniel Caligiuri equaliser two minutes from time gave 10-man Augsburg a 1-1 draw at Borussia Moenchengladbach."
5,08/11/2020,17:57,Casteels late penalty save seals Wolfsburg win,"Wolfsburg climbed to sixth in the Bundesliga Sunday after goalkeeper Koen Casteels pulled off a late stunning penalty save to help seal a 2-1 home over Hoffenheim, who have struggled since their shock win over Bayern Munich.","Hoffenheim were awarded a penalty in the fourth minute of injury time, but their Israeli striker Munas Dabbur watched helplessly as Casteels pushed away his spot kick attempt. It was the second late penalty which went begging after Wolfsburg's Dutch striker Wout Weghorst fired his spot-kick attempt wide on 84 minutes. Wolfsburg raced into the lead when Swiss winger Renato Steffen scored after just six minutes, although the VAR needed to check whether there was an offside in the build-up. A superb pass by Wolfsburg midfielder Xaver Schlager then split the defence and put Steffen away with the towering Weghorst scoring on 26 minutes. However, the 1.97m-tall Dutchman squandered the chance to put the result beyond doubt when he fired his late penalty attempt wide. Hoffenheim finished the stronger. When Wolfsburg's US defender John Anthony Brooks failed to connect with a clearance header, Hoffenheim's replacement forward Sargis Adamyan smashed his shot into the net three minutes from time. However, Casteels' goalmouth heroics made sure Wolfsburg took the three points. Since shocking Bayern Munich 4-1 in late September left them briefly top of the table, Hoffenheim have now won just three of their eight games to drop to 13th. Bayern opened a two-point gap over second-placed RB Leipzig on Saturday with a 3-2 win at rivals Borussia Dortmund, who dropped to third."
6,01/11/2020,20:27,Hertha held on Guendouzi debut,"Arsenal loanee Matteo Guendouzi made his Bundesliga debut on Sunday as Hertha Berlin were held to a 1-1 draw at home to Wolfsburg, while Bayer Leverkusen came from behind to beat Freiburg.","Guendouzi replaced fellow Frenchman Lucas Tousart just before the hour mark and was booked for dissent in stoppage time in his first competitive appearance since June. The curly-haired midfielder joined Hertha on loan in October having fallen out of favour at Arsenal, but was forced to delay his return to action after testing positive for coronavirus. He finally made his debut in Berlin's empty Olympic stadium on Sunday, helping Hertha to end a four-game losing streak and pick up their first point since the opening weekend. ""It's not an easy situation, but we have to stay positive. We have a lot of new players in the side, and we need to get to know each other on the pitch,"" Hertha midfielder Vladimir Darida told Sky. Matheus Cunha gave Hertha the lead after less than six minutes, squeezing a low shot inside the post from the edge of the area despite slipping on the turf as he struck the ball. Ridle Baku levelled the scores with a sweetly struck shot on 20 minutes, smashing the ball into the roof of the net from 18 yards out to score his first goal for Wolfsburg since joining the club in October. Earlier Sunday, Argentina striker Lucas Alario continued his fine run of form with two crucial first-half goals as Bayer Leverkusen saw off Freiburg 4-2. After a disastrous first half-hour for Leverkusen, Alario struck twice before the break to turn the game on its head and fire his team back into the top four. ""It was a strange match in which we started badly. Normally you can't turn games like that around, but Lucas's goals really helped us,"" said Leverkusen coach Peter Bosz. The Argentine now has seven goals from eight games in all competitions, and has found the net in each of his last three league appearances. Leverkusen, meanwhile, remain the only Bundesliga team yet to be beaten after the first six games of the season. Freiburg took the lead on just three minutes, Lucas Hoeler latching onto a 50-yard through ball from Lukas Kuebler and flicking the ball past Leverkusen keeper Lukas Hradecky. Leverkusen were bracing themselves for a long afternoon when Sven Bender was shown a red card for a trip on Hoeler in front of goal, but the decision was reversed by VAR. Having ridden their luck in the first half-hour, Leverkusen ruthlessly took their chances from then on, with Alario turning the game on its head with two quick goals before half-time. The Argentine pounced on a misplaced pass from Nicolas Hoefler to slot home the equaliser, before turning in a low cross from Lars Bender to put Leverkusen ahead just minutes before the break. Bosz's side looked to be in the clear when Nadiem Amiri smashed in a third on 65 minutes, but a tap-in from substitute Nils Petersen quickly brought Freiburg back into the game. Yet the home side's revival was short-lived, as centre-back Jonathan Tah rose high at a corner to head in Leverkusen's fourth and seal the three points. While Leverkusen return to the top four, Freiburg now sit just three places adrift of the bottom three, having not won since the opening day of the season."
7,30/08/2020,23:06,Dominant Lyon beat Wolfsburg to claim fifth straight Women's Champions League title,"Lyon continued their reign as Europe's dominant women's team on Sunday, beating Wolfsburg 3-1 in the Champions League final to win the trophy for the fifth year running with Japan star Saki Kumagai's goal proving crucial.","Kumagai netted after Eugenie Le Sommer had handed the French outfit the lead in San Sebastian, giving Lyon a 2-0 half-time advantage and leaving Wolfsburg with too much to do even if Alexandra Popp pulled one back in the second half. Icelandic midfielder Sara Bjork Gunnarsdottir's late effort made sure of the victory for Lyon, whose fifth consecutive Champions League crown is their seventh overall, comfortably a record. Five in a row sees them equal the feat achieved by the Real Madrid men's team between 1956 and 1960, in the early days of the European Cup. French President Emmanuel Macron even tweeted his congratulations at the end of the game. ""Now we need to win a sixth in a row to beat the record,"" said captain Wendie Renard, who along with Le Sommer and goalkeeper Sarah Bouhaddi has featured in all seven final wins. ""It is hard to win this trophy but we give everything to win it every year."" Lyon's latest triumph confirms their status as the finest club team around even as rivals across Europe step up their investment in the women's game. Jean-Luc Vasseur's team had previously edged out Bayern Munich and Paris Saint-Germain in the 'Final Eight' in Spain's Basque Country, played out behind closed doors because of the coronavirus pandemic. They also pipped PSG to claim a 14th successive French title this year and defeated the same team on penalties in the French Cup final. This victory, against a side who won a German domestic double and were unbeaten in 40 games before the final, showcased the depth of their squad. Lyon were missing four leading stars, with France duo Griedge Mbock and Amandine Henry injured and Norway's 2018 Ballon d'Or winner Ada Hegerberg not fully fit. England forward Nikita Parris was suspended. But Lyon's long-serving president Jean-Michel Aulas continues to be rewarded for his heavy investment in a women's team, despite the prize money for winning the Champions League being a mere 450,000 euros ($535,000), a tiny fraction of that on offer in the men's competition. ""It is the stuff of legend because we have had to rebuild and innovate every year, but the team showed great resilience and to win a fifth Champions League in a row is absolutely incredible,"" Aulas told Canal Plus. Here, Lyon were still able to call upon a host of French internationals and foreign stars like Kumagai, Germany's Dzsenifer Marozsan and England right-back Lucy Bronze, who is now expected to return to her home country. They are now unbeaten in 65 matches stretching back over two years, and this is also the third time in which Lyon have beaten Wolfsburg in the final, leaving the Germans still searching for a third Champions League crown to go with their titles in 2013, when they beat OL, and 2014. Previous finals between these sides have been close affairs, although on this occasion the holders started strongly and were rewarded with the opening goal in the 25th minute. Delphine Cascarino cut the ball back for Le Sommer, and she pounced to convert the rebound after her first shot was blocked by goalkeeper Friederike Abt. The second goal came in the 44th minute. Ingrid Engen stopped Amel Majri shooting but only succeeded in setting up Kumagai, who scored with a terrific left-foot strike from 23 yards. Wolfsburg pulled one back just before the hour as Ewa Pajor set up Popp to head in from close range, but Lyon made it 3-1 in the 88th minute. When a corner was not properly cleared, Le Sommer went for goal and her wayward shot was deflected in by Gunnarsdottir."
8,29/08/2020,03:00,Wolfsburg aim to stop Lyon,"They are the two enduring heavyweights of the last decade in European women's football, and on Sunday title holders Lyon and German contenders Wolfsburg meet in the Champions League final for the fourth time in eight years.","Lyon's hegemony in Europe was supposedly under greater threat than ever before coming into the 'Final Eight', but the French club are now just 90 minutes away from winning the Champions League for the fifth year running, and for a record-extending seventh time overall. But Wolfsburg have lived up to their billing as the most likely team to halt Lyon's run, and are themselves now aiming to lift the trophy for the third time in their fifth final appearance. It is a fitting occasion for the women's game to be in the spotlight, although the coronavirus threat has ensured the match in San Sebastian will be played behind closed doors, just like the men's final between Bayern Munich and Paris Saint-Germain in Lisbon a week ago. The similarities do not go much further -- if the two men's finalists earned total prize money of around 80 million euros ($95m) and are expected to make around 130 million euros altogether once television revenue and other bonuses are added, the winner of Sunday's game will have made just 460,000 euros in prize money. At least Video Assistant Referees will be available for the final, having controversially not been in use previously in the competition. For years Lyon have served as a model of how successful a women's side attached to a professional men's club can be given proper financial backing, although rivals at home and abroad are gradually making life tougher. They were crowned French champions for the 14th year running in May in a season curtailed because of the pandemic, and they recently won the French Cup for the ninth time by beating Paris Saint-Germain on penalties in the final. Jean-Luc Vasseur's team again edged out PSG in the Champions League semi-finals, with skipper Wendie Renard's header making the difference in Bilbao. Prior to that they shaded Bayern Munich 2-1 in the quarter-finals. ""I think my team is growing in strength,"" said Vasseur after the semi-final. His squad reads like a who's who of the biggest names in women's football, from captain Renard to England right-back Lucy Bronze, Japan midfielder Saki Kumagai, Germany playmaker Dzsenifer Marozsan and Norway's 2018 Ballon d'Or winner, Ada Hegerberg. ""These players' hunger to win things is insatiable,"" Vasseur added. ""They are still greedy for success. I've never seen anything like it."" Two years ago, Lyon came from behind to beat Wolfsburg 4-1 in extra time in the final in Kiev, although that game actually ended goalless in 90 minutes. When 'OL' beat Wolfsburg in 2016 they needed penalties to do so after a 1-1 draw. And the Germans claimed the first of their back-to-back titles by defeating Lyon 1-0 in 2013. This will surely be another close contest, with Wolfsburg having completed a German league and cup double before coming to Spain, where they defeated Barcelona 1-0 in the semi-finals with Sweden international Fridolina Rolfo scoring. In Dane Pernille Harder they have another prolific Scandinavian forward and in Germany's Alexandra Popp they have a player especially determined to gain revenge -- she was sent off in the 2018 final with Wolfsburg leading at the time. ""They're the number one in Europe and we obviously want to put a stop to that,"" Popp told UEFA.com. ""I don't think we've had a season as strong as this year. And that gives us the confidence to go again in the Champions League final. We stated at the start of the year that our target was to win the Champions League."" One thing that could help them is that Lyon will be without suspended England forward Nikita Parris, who was sent off against PSG. The fearsome Hegerberg is not yet fully fit after a serious knee injury. 2009-10: Turbine Potsdam (GER) 2010-11: Lyon (FRA) 2011-12: Lyon (FRA) 2012-13: Wolfsburg (GER) 2013-14: Wolfsburg (GER) 2014-15: Frankfurt (GER) 2015-16: Lyon (FRA) 2016-17: Lyon (FRA) 2017-18: Lyon (FRA)"
9,27/06/2020,18:01,"Bremen snatch play-off survival chance, champions Bayern rout Wolfsburg","Werder Bremen gave themselves hope of avoiding relegation from the German Bundesliga by thrashing Cologne 6-1 to grab a play-off place on the last day of the season, while champions Bayern Munich routed Wolfsburg before lifting the trophy on Saturday.","Japan striker Yuya Osako scored twice as Bremen stole the lifeline of the relegation/promotion play-off place from Fortuna Duesseldorf, who lost 3-0 at Union Berlin and were relegated with Paderborn, finishing one point behind Bremen. Florian Kohfeldt's Werder will face second-tier opponents in either Heidenheim or possibly neighbours, rivals and fellow fallen giants Hamburg in the play-off first leg on Thursday. Bremen have spent more seasons than any other team in the Bundesliga, having only spent one term in the second tier, in 1980-81. A burst of goals from Osako, Milot Rashica and Niclas Fuellkrug -- all in the space of eight minutes -- had Werder 3-0 up at the break against Cologne at the Weserstadion. Former Everton midfielder Davy Klaassen then fired home a rebound just after the break before Osako, facing his old side, added his second and USA international Josh Sargent completed the rout. Dominick Drexler pulled a goal back for Cologne. Werder, the four-time Bundesliga champions, also needed a favour from Berlin and got one as Union beat Fortuna 3-0 with goals from Nigerian duo Anthony Ujah and Suleiman Abdullahi either side of veteran midfielder Christian Gentner's effort. Bremen will find out their play-off opponents on Sunday, with Heidenheim currently in the play-off place ahead of the final round of matches in the second division. At Wolfsburg, Bayern striker Robert Lewandowski scored a penalty for his 34th league goal of the season, finishing as the top scorer for the fifth time. Kingsley Coman, Michael Cuisance and Thomas Mueller also got on the scoresheet as Bayern, champions for the eighth straight season, finished 13 points clear of second-placed Borussia Dortmund. Mueller set up Coman for Bayern's opening goal to finish the campaign with a league record 21 assists, and his goal that rounded out the win was also Bayern's 100th league goal this season -- one short of the Bundesliga record. Wolfsburg captain Josuha Guilavogui was sent off for a second yellow card after fouling Cuisance, leading to Lewandowski's penalty. Meanwhile, Borussia Moenchengladbach and RB Leipzig secured qualification for next season's Champions League after 2-1 wins over Hertha Berlin and Augsburg respectively, as fifth-placed Bayer Leverkusen missed out by two points despite beating Mainz 1-0. Dortmund, who had already wrapped up second place, crashed to a 4-0 home defeat by Hoffenheim, for whom Croatia striker Andrej Kramaric scored all four goals, including one penalty. That result allowed Hoffenheim to leapfrog Wolfsburg and take sixth place, although both sides will go into the Europa League next season along with Leverkusen. Before kick-off in Dortmund, Mario Goetze, whose winning goal sealed Germany's victory in the 2014 World Cup final, was given a send-off by the club. He will leave this summer with his contract having expired, but the 28-year-old attacking midfielder has not announced his future club. Elsewhere, Timo Werner signed off with a brace in RB Leipzig's 2-1 win at Augsburg in what was his final appearance for the club before moving to Chelsea. Schalke's disastrous second half of the season was completed with a 4-0 thrashing at the hands of Freiburg as they finished the season 12th, having been third in December. Eintracht Frankfurt beat bottom side Paderborn 3-2 in Saturday's other game."
10,16/06/2020,20:58,Gladbach brush aside Wolfsburg to boost Champions League hopes,Borussia Moenchengladbach stayed in the hunt for a Champions League berth with an emphatic 3-0 Bundesliga home win over Wolfsburg on Tuesday as midfielder Jonas Hofmann scored twice.,"After consecutive defeats by Freiburg and Bayern Munich, who can win an eighth straight league title later on Tuesday with victory at Werder Bremen, Gladbach raced into a two-goal lead after half an hour at Borussia Park. Hofmann scored twice before Germany international Lars Stindl swept a third into the net following a second-half counter-attack. Gladbach moved back into the fourth and final Champions League spot, two points ahead of Bayer Leverkusen, who host Cologne on Wednesday in their game in hand. Bayern and Borussia Dortmund have already qualified for next season's group stage, while RB Leipzig sit third, five points clear of Leverkusen. Gladbach took the lead on 11 minutes when Swiss forward Breel Embolo sidestepped a defender and played the ball into Hofmann, who fired past Wolfsburg goalkeeper Koen Casteels. The hosts doubled their lead when a long ball into the box was headed down by 2014 World Cup winnner Matthias Ginter into the path of Hofmann, who made no mistake from close range. Gladbach put the result to bed when a wayward pass from Wolfsburg defender John Brooks was snapped up by winger Ibrahima Traore, whose pass picked out Stindl to fire home 25 minutes from the final whistle. The defeat leaves Wolfsburg sixth, which carries a Europa League place next season. The result was all the more impressive as Gladbach eased to victory without injured French forwards Marcus Thuram and Alassane Plea. Marco Rose's Gladbach face bottom side Paderborn on Saturday, then mid-table Hertha Berlin on the final day of the season, while Leverkusen face Hertha and Mainz in their last two games."
11,07/06/2020,20:20,"Werder slip towards drop, Union eye safety as teams take knee for Floyd","Werder Bremen were staring at relegation from the Bundesliga on Sunday after a 1-0 home defeat to Wolfsburg, while Union Berlin edged towards safety on a day that featured a renewed show of solidarity with the global protests sparked by the death of George Floyd.","Wout Weghorst headed home the decisive goal for Wolfsburg eight minutes before the end to push his team back up to sixth and into the Europa League spots. The Dutch international's 12th league goal of the season came just seconds after Xaver Schlager crashed a shot off the bar and leaves Werder, the team with the most seasons in the Bundesliga, facing the drop for the first time since 1980. ""It is very disappointing, but everything is still possible. We will give everything until the end,"" said Werder captain Niklas Moisander to DAZN. With four matches left, Florian Kohfeldt's side are second-from-bottom, six points from safety and three from the relegation playoff place following back-to-back home defeats. Werder are the league's lowest scorers with 30 goals and have won just once at home all season, losing 11 times. They travel to bottom side Paderborn next weekend in a match that could be decisive for their survival, with league leaders Bayern Munich the following weekend and relegation rivals Mainz, who are just outside the drop zone and won 2-0 at Eintracht Frankfurt on Saturday, three days later. The match began after both starting elevens gathered round the centre circle at the Weser Stadium before dropping to one knee, echoing a gesture made by Borussia Dortmund and Hertha Berlin players and Mainz midfielder Pierre Kunde Malong on Saturday. Union Berlin and Schalke players then did the same before their 1-1 draw in the German capital. Favourites to go down in their first ever Bundesliga season, Union are 14th on 32 points, seven ahead of Werder who occupy the final automatic relegation place, and four away from the playoff spot. However their Nigerian striker Anthony Ujah failed in his attempt to score and take the knee himself, as he had promised he would do on Saturday. Ujah did set up Robert Andrich's neat 11th-minute opener. Union are level on points with Augsburg, who snatched a late draw at home to Cologne thanks to Philipp Max's 88th-minute equaliser, which came just three minutes after Anthony Modeste had fired the away side into the lead. Cologne are 12th on 35 points after a draw which also saw Florian Niederlechner miss a first-half penalty for Augsburg. Schalke, who grabbed a point at Union thanks to a fierce Jonjoe Kenny strike in the 28th minute, have failed to win in 12 league games but are 10th and are seven points from the European places. ""It's a tough situation we're in but it's a good step to come away and get a point at a difficult place to come,"" said English goalscorer Kenny. With protests against police brutality and for racial equality taking place around the world on Sunday, the Bundesliga has become a stage for tributes to Floyd, a black American man who died last month at the hands of police in Minneapolis. On Saturday, Dortmund players also wore messages on their T-shirts during their warm-up in honour of Floyd. Jadon Sancho and Achraf Hakimi wore the messages ""no justice, no peace"", while midfielders Axel Witsel and Emre Can's T-shirts displayed the words ""black"", ""white"", ""yellow"" and ""red"" crossed out, with the word ""human"" below. Prior to their 4-2 win at Bayer Leverkusen on Saturday, Bayern Munich players warmed up in T-shirts bearing both the Black Lives Matter hashtag and the slogan of the club's official ""Reds Against Racism"" campaign."
12,30/05/2020,21:10,Lewandowski hits brace as Bayern Munich go 10 points clear,Bayern Munich opened a 10-point lead at the top of the Bundesliga on Saturday with a 5-0 drubbing of relegation-threatened Fortuna Dusseldorf behind closed doors with the league's top-scorer Robert Lewandowski scoring twice.,"Duesseldorf defender Mathias Joergensen scored an early own goal before Benjamin Pavard, Lewandowski (2) and Alphonso Davies hit the target. With five games left, Bayern, who have won their last eight league games, are comfortably on course for an eighth straight league title. However, second-placed Borussia Dortmund could trim their lead on Sunday at bottom side Paderborn. Several records fell as Lewandowski now has 43 goals in all competitions, a season's best for the Poland striker with games in hand. Also head coach Hansi Flick claimed his 22nd win in his first 25 games, bettering the start made by Pep Guardiola when he took charge in 2013. ""Statistics and records don't interest me, what's important is to have a successful season,"" said Flick, in his first season since replacing Niko Kovac in November. ""At Bayern Munich, you are expected to win. I am very happy, we were very aggressive and didn't give them any chances."" Lewandowski, who had never previously scored in six games against Duesseldorf, made amends with goals either side of half-time. Fortuna, who were unbeaten in their three games since the league resumed after a two-month coronavirus-enforced hiatus, were humbled at the Allianz Arena where they last poached a 3-3 draw in November 2018. They fell behind on 15 minutes when Joergensen turned the ball into his own net after Pavard mishit his shot. Right-back Pavard then grabbed the second with a powerful header on 29 minutes before Lewandowski made it 3-0 just before the break after being presented with a tap-in by Thomas Mueller. Duesseldorf were floored with two goals in as many minutes as Lewandowski profited again with another poacher's goal after Serge Gnabry's good work. Davies then scored the game's best goal. After some high pressing, the Canadian teen won the ball in the Duesseldorf area, barged past a succession of defenders and fired home to make it 5-0 on 52 minutes. Werder Bremen boosted their survival hopes with a 1-0 win at Schalke, who are winless in 11 games and continue to plummet. Midfielder Leonardo Bittencourt scored a first-half winner. ""This is a very, very important away win,"" said Bremen coach Florian Kohfeldt. ""We have taken seven points from the last three games, but if you look at the table, we are still behind."" Bremen have spent more seasons in the Bundesliga than any other club, but currently sit second from bottom. However, Saturday's victory leaves them just three points from guaranteed safety with six games left. They are two points behind Duesseldorf in 16th, which carries a relegation play-off at the end of the season. Werder could climb out of the relegation places for the first time since December on Wednesday if they beat Eintracht Frankfurt at home. Bittencourt hit a stunning strike from just outside the box which beat Schalke's Bayern-bound goalkeeper Alexander Nuebel on 32 minutes. Schalke succumbed to their fourth straight defeat, piling pressure on head coach David Wagner. In the same game, Schalke's American midfielder Weston McKennie wore a 'Justice for George' armband as part of the growing protests over the death of an unarmed black man during a police arrest in the United States. ""To be able to use my platform to bring attention to a problem that has been going on too long feels good!!!,"" tweeted 21-year-old McKennie. ""We have to stand up for what we believe in and I believe that it is time that we are heard."" George Floyd died in Minneapolis in an arrest by a police officer who pinned him to the ground for several minutes by kneeling on his neck. Hertha remain unbeaten with three wins and a draw since Bruno Labbadia took charge during the lockdown after their 2-0 win at home to Augsburg thanks for goals by Javairo Dilrosun and Krzysztof Piatek. Having routed Leverkusen 4-1 away on Tuesday, Wolfsburg crashed to a 2-1 defeat at home to 10-man Eintracht Frankfurt. Japan midfielder Daichi Kamada scored the winner 10 minutes from time while Frankfurt had replacement midfielder Lucas Torro sent off in the dying stages for a second yellow card. Frankfurt took the lead when striker Andre Silva converted a penalty on 27 minutes, but Wolfsburg equalised when right-back Kevin Mbabu headed home on 58 minutes. Hoffenheim are seventh after their 1-0 win at Mainz thanks to Ihlas Bebou who darted into the area, swept past two defenders, and fired home on 43 minutes. On Friday, Leverkusen went third when Germany midfielder Kai Havertz became the first player in Bundesliga history to score 35 goals before his 21st birthday to seal a 1-0 win at Freiburg."
13,23/05/2020,18:02,Dortmund beat Wolfsburg to close in on Bayern ahead of title showdown,Borussia Dortmund warmed up for their looming top-of-the-table clash against Bayern Munich with a 2-0 win at Wolfsburg on Saturday in the second weekend of the Bundesliga's restart from the coronavirus-enforced suspension.,"Goals by Raphael Guerreiro and Achraf Hakimi sealed an away win in front of empty stands to leave them a point behind league leaders Bayern. On Tuesday, Dortmund host defending champions Bayern -- who host Eintracht Frankfurt later on Saturday -- in a showdown behind closed doors. This was the second weekend of the Bundesliga's restart, following a two-month hiatus, as the first top European league to resume during the coronavirus pandemic. A minute's silence was held before kick-off in the afternoon's four matches to remember the victims of COVID-19, which has so far claimed 8,216 lives in Germany. In Wolfsburg, Portugal winger Guerreiro, who netted twice in last week's 4-0 derby thrashing of Schalke, scored his third goal in two games to open the scoring in the 32nd minute. Erling Braut Haaland, who had scored 10 goals in nine league games since joining in January from Red Bull Salzburg, mistimed his attempt to meet the cross, but Guerreiro was on hand to tap home. With the players calls echoing around the near-empty stadium, Dortmund had a let off early in the second-half when Wolfsburg winger Renato Steffen clipped the crossbar. England winger Jadon Sancho helped sealed the win when he dribbled at the Wolfsburg defence, then laid a pass off to Hakimi, who fired home 12 minutes from time. In the final minutes, Wolfsburg had replacement Felix Klaus sent off for fouling Hakimi. Bayer Leverkusen built on Monday's drubbing of Werder Bremen by moving up to third place with a 3-1 win at Borussia Moenchengladbach, who dropped to fourth. With the terraces at Borussia Park decked with 13,000 cardboard cut-outs of home fans, Leverkusen's rising star Kai Havertz, who also scored twice in the 4-1 rout of Bremen, again netted twice. Playing up front as a striker, the 20-year-old Germany winger darted onto Karim Bellarabi's pass into the area and fired home with seven minutes played. French forward Marcus Thuram levelled with his eighth league goal of the season for Gladbach just after the break. Havertz netted a penalty soon after when the video assistant referee spotted a foul on Bellarabi in the area, before Sven Bender unwittingly sealed the win with his shoulder nine minutes from time. Second-from-bottom Werder Bremen gained a valuable win in the relegation fight with a 1-0 win at Freiburg to claim their first victory in eight league games. Midfielder Leon Bittencourt hit the winner in the 19th minute when his long-range shot flew hit the far corner. In the action-packed dying stages, Bremen had defender Philipp Bargfrede sent off for a second yellow card and Freiburg had a goal ruled offside. The result leaves Bremen two points from 16th -- which carries a relegation play-off at the end of the season -- but six points from 15th, which guarantees safety. Bottom side Paderborn are now nine points from safety with seven games left after their 1-1 draw at home to Hoffenheim. On Friday, Hertha Berlin drubbed neighbours Union Berlin 4-0 at the Olympic Stadium in the capital's derby. Hertha's new coach Bruno Labbadia celebrated a second win in as many games to lift his team up to 10th."
14,15/12/2019,17:31,Arnold's late winner denies 'punchbag' Moenchengladbach top spot,Borussia Moenchengladbach coach Marco Rose compared his side to a punchbag after they failed to return to the top of the Bundesliga on Sunday as Max Arnold's thundering injury time volley consigned them to a 2-1 defeat at Wolfsburg.,"Moenchengladbach arrived at the Volkswagen Arena knowing a third straight league win would send them back to the number one spot above Leipzig who hammered Fortuna Duesseldorf 3-0 on Saturday. Rose's side lost for a second straight game following the midweek defeat to Istanbul Basaksehir in the Europa League. ""I find it really disappointing -- although I knew it would come -- that my team would be treated this way, like a punching bag being hit here and there,"" Rose said. ""We've been answering all the questions people have asked of us for seven or eight weeks now and so this week we've received two bitter results -- and now people are saying we aren't up to it,"" he added. Arnold's effort, 42 seconds into added time, came after Breel Embolo had responded for Borussia following Xaver Schlager's opener within the first quarter of an hour. The hosts opened the scoring after 13 minutes, with Schlager side-footing into the net from close range to score his first of the season. Gladbach hit back two minutes later, however, with Switzerland forward Embolo smashing in a looping cross from Alassane Plea at the back post to make it 1-1. From there, the encounter turned scrappy, with six yellow cards handed out, three in each half, as each side pushed for a winner. With the clock winding down, Arnold met a poorly cleared ball at the edge of the box and struck it cleanly past goalkeeper Yann Sommer to claim the three points. The Wolves move above Hoffenheim to eighth place, while Gladbach fall back to second after 10 weeks on top of the table and are now two points behind Leipzig. In Sunday's late game, 10-man Schalke leapfrogged Bayern Munich into fourth place as they held on to beat Eintracht Frankfurt 1-0 thanks to an inspired performance from Amine Harit. ""We played with cleverness and maturity to close out the game in what was a completely crazy day for us,"" Schalke coach David Wagner said. ""Crazy day, crazy game, but for the way the boys fought back against it, we're incredibly happy."" The Royal Blues' US midfielder Weston McKennie was stretchered off in the opening quarter of an hour with a shoulder injury. Attacking midfielder Harit was everywhere at the Veltins Arena, creating the overlap and then assisting Benito Raman's goal in the 53rd minute. The hosts endured a nervous final 25 minutes -- as well as a further seven minutes of injury time -- after goalkeeper Alex Nuebel was red carded for a brutal mid-air challenge on Eintracht's Mijat Gacinovic outside the box. Gacinovic suffered a blow to the head as a result of the clash and was unable to continue. Eintracht's Lucas Torro had a chance to equalise from the last play of the match when a corner landed at his feet in front of goal, however the Spaniard failed to strike the ball cleanly."
15,07/11/2019,21:19,"Man Utd ease into last 32, Celtic down Lazio to progress","Teenager Mason Greenwood scored as Manchester United cruised into the Europa League last 32 with a 3-0 win over Partizan Belgrade at Old Trafford on Thursday, while Celtic stunned Lazio with a last-gasp goal in Rome to progress.","Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's United knew that a third victory in four Group L games would be enough to send them through. The 18-year-old Greenwood broke the deadlock in the 22nd minute with a cool finish to score his third goal of the season and second in this competition. Anthony Martial doubled the advantage after the half-hour mark with a brilliant individual goal, before Marcus Rashford lashed home the third four minutes after the interval. The comfortable victory saw United bounce back after a 1-0 loss at Bournemouth last weekend had ended a three-game winning run. AZ Alkmaar thrashed Astana 5-0 in Kazakhstan to keep control of the race for second place in Group L behind United, eliminating their hosts and moving four points clear of Partizan. Olivier Ntcham scored a dramatic injury-time winner to grab Celtic a 2-1 victory at Lazio. Neil Lennon's outfit remain top of Group E with two games remaining, seven points clear of third-placed Lazio after their second straight win over the Romans. ""It's great to have qualified with two games to spare,"" Celtic manager Lennon told uefa.com. ""It's too early to say how far we can go in this competition but we can be a difficult opponent for anyone."" Ciro Immobile volleyed the hosts into a seventh-minute lead, but James Forrest drew Celtic level before half-time. But substitute Ntcham latched onto Odsonne Edouard's pass in the fifth minute of added time and dinked a cool finish over Lazio goalkeeper Thomas Strakosha. ""Realistically we have very little chance of qualifying. But never say never in football,"" said Lazio coach Simone Inzaghi. The other game in the group saw CFR Cluj move to within a point of qualification by beating Rennes 1-0 in Romania. Celtic's Old Firm rivals Rangers gave their hopes of reaching the knockout stage for the first time since 2011 a massive boost with a 2-0 victory over Porto at Ibrox. Second-half goals from Alfredo Morelos and Steven Davis fired Steven Gerrard's men second in Group G, three points ahead of Feyenoord after the Dutch side's 1-1 draw with Young Boys. Bundesliga leaders Borussia Moenchengladbach grabbed their first win of the Europa League campaign as Marcus Thuram's 95th-minute strike sealed a 2-1 triumph against Roma. The German club moved second in Group J, ahead of Roma on head-to-head and two points behind leaders Istanbul Basaksehir, who saw off 10-man Wolfsberger 3-0 in Austria. Wolves made it three straight Europa League wins despite Ruben Neves missing a penalty as Raul Jimenez's 92nd-minute goal grabbed a 1-0 success over Slovan Bratislava at Molineux. Nuno Espirito Santo's men now sit five points clear of Slovan in second in Group K, with Braga a point ahead of the Premier League side at the top after beating Besiktas 3-1. Former Barcelona winger Munir El Haddadi starred with a hat-trick as Sevilla thrashed Dudelange 5-2 to also reach the knockout rounds. Record five-time winners Sevilla knew victory in Luxembourg would send them through from Group A and their one-sided win also sealed top spot. Dudelange are still in contention to progress despite sitting bottom of the group, one point behind APOEL and Qarabag after the Cypriot side's 2-1 win in Nicosia. PSV Eindhoven, the 1978 winners, suffered a humbling 4-1 defeat by Austrian team LASK Linz to slip to third in Group D behind their opponents and Sporting Lisbon, who won 2-0 at Rosenborg. Elsewhere, Espanyol moved to the brink of qualification by hammering nine-man Ludogorets 6-0, while Gent moved top of Group I with a 3-1 win at Wolfsburg."

Marcel Sabitzer scored Leipzig's second in the 55th minute and opened the floodgates, with goals from Emil Forsberg, Konrad Laimer and Timo Werner padding the score out to 5-0. Germany forward Werner struck again in the 88th minute before Wolfsburg got a consolation goal from Wout Weghorst. Elsewhere, Werder Bremen dominated second division side Heidenheim, winning 4-1. Milot Rashica scored after just six minutes, with Leonardo Bittencourt and Davy Klaassen adding two more before the game had reached 20 minutes. Austrian defender Marco Friedl added a fourth in the 41st minute, before Heidenheim's Marc Schnatterer converted a penalty in first-half injury time. Amateur side SC Verl continued their miraculous German Cup run, advancing to the last 16 after defeating second-division Holsten Kiel 8-7 in a penalty shootout. Home side Verl, who play in the fourth division of German football, equalised in the 45th minute through Nico Hecker after Kiel opened the scoring in the 13th minute through Janni Luca Serra. Both sides converted each of their five penalties, with the shootout eventually going to its ninth round. Verl's Zlatko Janjic scored from the spot, before Kiel's Phil Neumann failed to convert to send the minnows through. Verl had defeated Bundesliga side Augsburg in their first-round fixture. In another match decided by a penalty shootout, two-time German Cup winners Kaiserslauten won 6-5 over Nuremberg, after the score finished 2-2 following extra time. In Wednesday's late games, Borussia Dortmund welcome Borussia Moenchengladbach, while Duesseldorf take on Erzgebirge, Hertha Berlin face Dynamo Dresden and St Pauli take on Eintracht Frankfurt."
17,27/10/2019,18:08,VAR denies Wolfsburg chance of going top,"A late VAR intervention cost Wolfsburg the chance to go top of the Bundesliga on Sunday, with Joao Victor's 84th-minute goal disallowed in a goalless draw against Augsburg.","Wolfsburg celebrated what they thought was a victory after Tin Jedvaj's cross was tapped home by Victor before referee Tobias Stieler overturned the strike for offside. The visitors started on top, dominating the first period. Augsburg striker Florian Niederlechner had a number of chances, going close in the 17th minute with a close range shot. Niederlechner had another chance to open the scoring in the 50th minute, but again failed to convert. Brazilian defender William was the home side's best player, probing and asking constant questions of the Augsburg defence. It was a rare offensive stalemate for Wolfsburg, who had scored in every Bundesliga game so far this season. They are now third, level on 17 points with Freiburg. Wolfsburg remain the Bundesliga's only unbeaten side, while Augsburg finish the weekend in 17th after chalking up their fourth draw of the season. The stalemate highlighted the congested nature of the 2019-20 Bundesliga campaign, with only four points separating leaders Bayern Munich from 10th-placed Hoffenheim. Borussia Moenchengladbach have a chance to go top in Sunday's final game when they take on Eintracht Frankfurt at Borussia Park."
18,06/10/2019,16:42,Moenchengladbach go top with Augsburg thrashing,Borussia Moenchengladbach moved top of the Bundesliga on Sunday after a double from Patrick Herrmann helped the unfancied outfit take advantage their Bundesliga rivals faltering with a 5-1 thumping of Augsburg.,"Marco Rose's side are in first place for the first time since the 2011-12 season, two points ahead of five teams, including Bayern Munich and RB Leipzig. Gladbach dominated their lowly opponents and were three goals up after just 13 minutes and 4-0 ahead by half-time. Bayern, who lost 2-1 at Hoffenheim on Saturday, surrendered top spot. Borussia Dortmund, a further two points back, and Leipzig both drew. Gladbach hit the lead in the second minute, when Denis Zakaria tapped home from close range. Patrick Herrmann quickly scored twice to put the hosts three ahead. Alassane Plea added the fourth in the 39th minute. Augsburg opened the second half more positively. Florian Niederlechner probed and pushed for the Bavarians before having an effort turned onto the post with 15 minutes remaining. Niederlechner scored the away side's only goal five minutes later, but Breel Embolo made it five for Gladbach just five minutes later to seal a comprehensive victory. In Sunday's late games, Wolfsburg have the chance to go second when they host Union Berlin, before Frankfurt close the round against Werder Bremen."
19,13/09/2019,22:29,Wolfsburg miss chance to go top with Duesseldorf draw,Wolfsburg striker Wout Weghorst netted his fourth goal in five games this season to rescue a 1-1 draw on a frustrating visit to Fortuna Duesseldorf on Friday.,"The draw is a missed opportunity for Wolfsburg, who would have leapfrogged RB Leipzig to go top of the table overnight with a win. Yet a contested VAR decision and a late missed chance mean Wolfsburg now sit second between Leipzig and Bayern, who face each other in a blockbuster clash on Saturday. Fortuna left-back Niko Giesselmann almost broke the roof of the net with a brilliant 16th minute opener, as he blasted the ball into the top corner from a wide angle to pick up his first ever Bundesliga goal. The goal, ultimately given by VAR, sparked controversy as Wolfsburg protested that the ball had gone out at the touchline in the build up. Dutchman Weghorst corrected the perceived injustice less than 15 minutes later, nutmegging goalkeeper Zackary Steffen at the end of a well-worked move to draw Wolfsburg level. Felix Klaus came closest to grabbing a winner for Wolfsburg at the end of a turgid second half. This weekend promises to be an early litmus test in the Bundesliga title race, as last season's top four teams go head to head in two highly anticipated clashes. Borussia Dortmund host Bayer Leverkusen just hours before champions Bayern travel to league leaders Leipzig for the headline fixture on Saturday evening."
20,31/08/2019,19:14,Perisic opens Bayern account in Mainz thrashing,Bayern Munich new boy Ivan Perisic bagged his first goal for the Bundesliga champions as they romped to a 6-1 win over a hapless Mainz at the Allianz Arena on Saturday.,"Bayern showcased their attacking brilliance throughout, with six different players getting on the scoresheet. Robert Lewandowski scored his sixth of the season in just three games, while Benjamin Pavard, David Alaba, Kingsley Coman and Alphonso Davies also scored. Mainz took a shock early lead when Jean-Paul Boetius finished a superb sixth-minute counter attack, giving the visitors hope that they might be able to pick up their first point of the season. However Pavard equalised for the hosts half-an-hour later through an expertly taken volley which recalled his stunning 2018 World Cup strike against Argentina. Alaba gave Bayern the lead with a brilliantly taken free kick just before the break, and the rout was completed in the second half. The win sees Bayern move up the table to equal second, behind leaders RB Leipzig whose 3-1 win over Borussia Moenchengladbach on Friday means they have won three out of three. In Freiburg, Cologne's Ellyes Skhiri scored the winner in second-half injury time to secure the visitors a 2-1 victory. Freiburg hit the lead in the 40th minute through an own goal by Rafael Czichos, before Cologne fan favourite Anthony Modeste equalised in the 52nd minute. Schalke picked up their first win of the season over a disappointing Hertha Berlin at Gelsenkirchen's Veltins Arena. Berlin scored own goals either side of half time through Niklas Stark and Karim Rekik. English defender Jonjoe Kenny added a third in the 86th minute to make it 3-0 -- the first goal by a Schalke player this season -- to put the game beyond doubt. Wolfsburg and Paderborn fought out a firey 1-1 draw at the Volkswagen Arena. Newly-promoted Paderborn went ahead through Cauly Souza in the 12th minute, before Josip Brekalo equalised in the 56th minute. At the BayArena, visitors Hoffenheim ended Bayer Leverkusen's 100 per cent start to the season as the sides fought out a 0-0 draw. The visitors had to endure a six-minute spell of injury time but held firm against a luckless Leverkusen attack. While Leipzig's win over Gladbach saw them secure outright first on the table, Dortmund have the chance to snatch it back when they take on Union Berlin later on Saturday."

""We are delighted to have signed him. He's a young forward with remarkable physical attributes. He's very strong and powerful and has a great scoring ability,"" said Lille managing director Marc Ingla. The arrival of Osimhen, for a fee that reportedly could rise to 14 million euros ($15.5 million), comes with Lille on the verge of selling Nicolas Pepe and Rafael Leao to Arsenal and AC Milan respectively. Lille finished second to Paris Saint-Germain last season and qualified for the Champions League group stage for the first time since 2012-13."
22,11/05/2019,18:02,Dortmund take title race to wire as Bayern held,Bayern Munich missed the chance to wrap up a seventh successive Bundesliga title as they were held to a goalless draw at RB Leipzig on Saturday and rivals Borussia Dortmund edged a nervy 3-2 win over Fortuna Duesseldorf.,"Chelsea-bound US international Christian Pulisic found the net in his final home game for Dortmund, helping them to battle back to within two points of league leaders Bayern ahead of the final round of games next weekend. Bayern can now secure the title with a win at home to Eintracht Frankfurt next Saturday, while Dortmund must win at Borussia Moenchengladbach. Dortmund, who looked dead and buried after slipping four points behind last week, enjoyed the rub of the green as they stumbled to victory over Duesseldorf. Pulisic, who will join Chelsea next season, bid an emotional farewell to the Dortmund fans before the game and then opened the scoring on 41 minutes. A howler from stand-in goalkeeper Marwin Hitz allowed Oliver Fink to equalise, but Thomas Delaney restored the lead for Dortmund. Hitz then gave away a penalty with a foul on Dodi Lukebakio, but the Belgian dragged the ball wide from 12 yards. Mario Goetze appeared to seal the win for Dortmund on 90 minutes, but Dawid Kownacki pulled one back for Duesseldorf minutes later to make it a nerve-jangling finish for the hosts. In Leipzig, Leon Goretzka's stylish scissor-kick sent Bayern into ecstasy after half-time, but the goal was ruled out by VAR. Serge Gnabry hit the bar later in the second half, but Bayern could not force the winner. At the other end of the table, Nuremberg and Hanover were finally relegated as Stuttgart secured the relegation play-off place with a 3-0 win over Wolfsburg. Hanover went down fighting as goals from Waldemar Anton, Ihlas Bebou and Walace saw them beat Freiburg 3-0. Yet Anastasios Donis, Gonzalo Castro and Daniel Didavi were on the mark for Stuttgart to condemn Hanover and Nuremberg to the drop. Nuremberg, meanwhile, suffered a 4-0 defeat to Borussia Moenchengladbach thanks to an own-goal from Lukas Muehl and strikes from Thorgan Hazard, Denis Zakaria and former Nuremberg man Josip Drmic. The thumping win sees Gladbach go fourth overnight, leapfrogging both Eintracht Frankfurt and Bayer Leverkusen, who were held to a 1-1 draw at home to Schalke, Guido Burgstaller cancelling out Kai Havertz's opener. Frankfurt have the chance to break back into the top four with a win over Mainz on Sunday. Werder Bremen also kept their European hopes alive with a 1-0 win over Hoffenheim, and Hertha Berlin snatched a late 4-3 victory away to Augsburg. Johannes Eggestein's first-half goal condemned RB Leipzig-bound coach Julian Nagelsmann to defeat in his last home game in charge of Hoffenheim. Andre Hahn and Michael Gregoritsch put Augsburg ahead three times but goals from Marvin Plattenhardt and Marko Grujic kept Hertha in the game before a late brace from Salomon Kalou secured three points."
23,04/05/2019,21:00,Dortmund collapse leaves Bayern on brink of seventh successive title,Borussia Dortmund coach Lucien Favre defended goalkeeper Roman Buerki after his second-half howler saw Dortmund throw away a two-goal lead to draw 2-2 with Werder Bremen and left Bayern Munich on the brink of a seventh successive Bundesliga title.,"""I am not going to talk about Roman. Whatever happens, he has had a fantastic season and has saved us a lot of points in the past,"" Favre told Sky. Buerki's error and a goal from Claudio Pizarro all but ended Dortmund's title challenge and sealed a perfect afternoon for Bayern, after club stalwarts Franck Ribery and Arjen Robben earlier returned from injury to help them to a 3-1 victory over bottom club Hanover. Dortmund, who were nine points ahead of Bayern in December, must now make up a four-point deficit in the last two games of the season. ""We have to win our last home game next week, that is our only hope,"" said Favre. Christian Pulisic opened the scoring for Dortmund after just six minutes with a brilliant solo goal, before Paco Alcacer doubled the lead with a fizzing free-kick. With Dortmund in full control on 70 minutes, Buerki allowed Bremen back into the game when he let Kevin Moehwald's tame shot through his legs, and former Bayern star Pizarro scored a shock equaliser moments later. ""If we can help Bayern, why not?"" a smiling Pizarro told Sky. In Munich, Robben and Ribery, both of whom are set to leave Bayern at the end of the season, came off the bench to make their first appearance together in 2019. Ribery scored what may be his last ever goal at the Allianz Arena, while Robben, who had not played since November, told Sky that his cameo appearance was not the end of his Bayern journey. ""I always said I didn't want to come back just to wave to the fans and say goodbye. There are two games left and the German Cup final, so there is more to come,"" he said. Hanover kept Bayern at bay for nearly half an hour before Robert Lewandowski headed the hosts ahead from close range and Leon Goretzka curled the second in off the post. The visitors hit back after half-time with a Jonathas penalty, the result of a highly controversial handball decision from VAR against Jerome Boateng. Ribery secured the win with a deflected shot six minutes from time. Bayern now need just one win from their last two games against top four sides RB Leipzig and Eintracht Frankfurt. Elsewhere, Borussia Moenchengladbach and Hoffenheim both stumbled in the race for the top four, as they shared the points in a 2-2 draw. Matthias Ginter cancelled out Pavel Kaderabek's opener, before Nadiem Amiri restored the lead with a fine volley. Josip Drmic saved Gladbach's Champions League hopes with a late equaliser. Wolfsburg also remain in the hunt for a top four place after goals from Felix Klaus and Marcel Tisserand saw them beat second-from-bottom Nuremberg 2-0. Both Nuremberg and Hanover were spared relegation for at least another week, however, as Hertha Berlin won 3-1 at home to Stuttgart, who remain in the relegation play-off place. Goals from Vedad Ibisevic, Ondrej Duda and Salomon Kalou sealed the win for Hertha, despite a late consolation header from Mario Gomez."
24,28/04/2019,17:42,Weghorst double and Baumann mistakes see Wolfsburg beat Hoffenheim,Hoffenheim goalkeeper Oliver Baumann fluffed two routine saves as his side lost 4-1 to Wolfsburg and missed the chance to move within a point of the top four.,"The usually reliable Baumann made his mistakes in the second half to hand Wolfsburg victory and end a six-game unbeaten run for Hoffenheim. ""It is really annoying because I saved pretty much everything else,"" Baumann told Sky. The defeat is a blow to Hoffenheim's hopes of European qualification. Julian Nagelsmann's side remain on course for a Europa League berth in seventh, but are four points adrift of the top four. ""If we are no longer favourites for the Champions League, then that is probably deserved after today,"" said Baumann. Adam Szalai found the net at the end of slick counter-attack to put Hoffenheim in front on nine minutes. Andrej Kramaric then missed a penalty for the hosts, before Wolfsburg's William curled in a superb equaliser just before half-time. Despite having made several fine saves in the first half, Baumann gifted Wolfsburg the lead with 20 minutes to go when he let Wout Weghorst's soft header slip through his fingers at the near post. The Hoffenheim keeper was beaten at his near post again by a fierce shot from Maximilian Arnold. Weghorst struck again in the 89th minute. The puts Wolfsburg move a point behind Hoffenheim in eighth. Bayern Munich have the chance to go four points clear at the top of the table when they face Nuremberg in Sunday's late match."
25,23/04/2019,12:58,Linz boss Glasner to replace Labbadia at Wolfsburg,"Austrian coach Oliver Glasner will take over from Bruno Labbadia at Wolfsburg at the end of the season, the Bundesliga club confirmed on Tuesday.","Glasner is currently in charge of Austrian side LASK Linz and will replace Labbadia, who announced his impending departure from Wolfsburg last month. The 44-year-old will sign a three-year contract, Wolfsburg confirmed in a statement. ""We have been following Oliver Glasner and his impressive work at Linz for a long time,"" said Wolfsburg sporting director Joerg Schmadtke. ""Our discussions with him confirmed our positive impression that he is the right person to lead the club into the next stage of its development. ""We are getting a coach with incredible expertise and a real team player."" Glasner has worked wonders at Austrian side Linz, whom he took over in the second division in 2015. He led them to promotion in his first season in charge, and they now sit in second place in the top flight, behind perennial Austrian champions Red Bull Salzburg. Having also worked as an assistant coach at Salzburg, the Wolfsburg job will be his first outside his native Austria. His appointment ends Wolfsburg's search for a new coach after 53-year-old Labbadia announced he would not extend his contract earlier this year. Labbadia saved Wolfsburg from relegation last season, and they are now in the race for Europa League qualification."
26,22/04/2019,22:43,Late Wolfsburg goal dents Frankfurt's Champions League bid,American defender John Brooks scored in the 90th minute to give Wolfsburg a 1-1 home draw with Eintracht on Monday and dent the visitors' Champions League hopes.,"Eintracht had taken the lead in the 78th minute as Jonathan De Guzman scored 10 minutes after coming on. When a deflected shot angled across the penalty area the Canadian outmuscled Josuha Guilavogui and then guided the ball past Pavao Pervan from close range. Eintracht have a Europa League semifinal against Chelsea at the start of May and were seeking breathing room in the race for the fourth Bundesliga spot in next season's Champions League. But with a victory that would have put them four points clear of Borussia Moenchengladach in their grasp, the Frankfurt defence went missing. After the visitors gave the ball away in midfield, their ragged back line allowed Felix Klaus to race into space on the right. When he crossed, Brooks, sprinting up from central defence, was alone in front of goal to boot the ball into the roof of the net. Brooks had a chance to win the game with a header in added time. The draw moved Wolfsburg up to ninth, four points behind Hoffenheim in the last potential Europa League berth."
27,13/04/2019,17:38,Raffael puts Gladbach back in the race for top four,A second-half winner from Brazilian striker Raffael gave Borussia Moenchengladbach a 1-0 win over Hanover on Saturday and fresh hope of a top four finish in the Bundesliga.,"Gladbach have endured a turbulent few weeks of late, having dropped out of the top four and announced the impending departure of coach Dieter Hecking. The win over Hanover, only their second victory in nine games, marked a timely change in fortunes and keeps Gladbach in the race for Champions League football. They now sit in fifth, a point behind Eintracht Frankfurt, who play Augsburg on Sunday. Raffael grabbed the winner just after half-time, flicking a loose ball over the head of Hanover keeper Michael Esser. Bottom-of-the-table Hanover created little more than a handful of half-chances on the counter-attack, and failed to add to their meagre tally of 11 home goals this season. RB Leipzig, meanwhile, strengthened their grip on third with a comfortable win over Wolfsburg. Kevin Kampl curled in the opener on 16 minutes, before Timo Werner headed in a second to notch his third goal in four games. Defeat is a setback for Wolfsburg, whose fellow European hopefuls Bremen and Leverkusen both won on Saturday. Bremen snuck into a Europa League place thanks to a 2-1 win over Freiburg. Late headers from in-form Dutch midfielder Davy Klaassen and Theodor Gebre Selassie sealed the three points for the home side, despite Luca Waldschmidt's even later consolation goal for Freiburg. Leverkusen, meanwhile, battled to a 1-0 victory over relegation-threatened Stuttgart. Stuttgart keeper Ron-Robert Zieler kept out Kevin Volland with a brilliant reflex save before half-time, but could not stop Kai Havertz's coolly taken penalty just after the hour mark. Tempers flared late on as Stuttgart's Santiago Ascacibar clashed with Havertz and was sent off. Leverkusen sit between Bremen and Wolfsburg in seventh in what is proving to be a thrilling race for Europe. A single point separates Bremen in sixth from ninth-placed Hoffenheim, who play Hertha Berlin on Sunday."
28,01/02/2019,14:24,Dardai bans Bayern talk ahead of cup clash,Hertha Berlin boss Pal Dardai has banned any talk of Bayern Munich's looming cup visit to keep his side focused on Saturday's Bundesliga match at home to Wolfsburg.,"Hertha host German giants Bayern next Wednesday at the Olympic Stadium in a plum German Cup last-16 tie and Dardai is so fed up of hearing about the imminent visit that he has banned any reference to them. ""I don't want to hear a thing about Bayern. And also not about any ticket requests - it's only about Wolfsburg,"" said Dardai, with both Hertha and Wolfsburg on 28 points in the Bundesliga table. ""There will be no better preparation than having three points against Wolfsburg behind us."" Hertha have already stunned Bayern this season, deservedly running out 2-0 winners when the sides met in the league last September after captain Vedad Ibisevic converted a penalty and playmaker Ondrej Duda netted a superb second goal before the break. With the pair in form, seventh-placed Hertha are unbeaten in their first two games of 2019 and are knocking on the door of the European places for next season, but Wolfsburg are just behind them in eighth. It has been 10 years since Hertha last took seven points from their first three games after the Bundesliga's winter break and Dardai wants to beat Wolfsburg, who lost their last two games, to boost confidence before the cup showdown. ""On our day, we can beat anybody,"" said Dardai. ""And I'll say it now, when we have our fans behind us and everyone is fit, we will win on Saturday. ""But to do that, you have to work hard and not think about Bayern."""
29,26/01/2019,20:34,Dortmund go nine points clear of Bayern Munich by thumping Hanover,Marco Reus shone as Borussia Dortmund opened a nine-point lead over Bayern Munich at the top of the Bundesliga table with a 5-1 rout of strugglers Hanover on Saturday.,"With defending champions Bayern hosting Stuttgart on Sunday, Dortmund grabbed the chance to thump second-from-bottom Hanover with Reus causing havoc on his return from an ankle injury. ""We took our time to find the gaps, but after we changed ends and went 2-0 up it was much easier,"" said Dortmund coach Lucien Favre after his side floored Hanover with three goals in seven minutes. Achraf Hakimi, on loan from Real Madrid, Reus, Mario Goetze and Raphael Guerreiro scored Dortmund's goals to keep them on course for their first Bundesliga title since 2012. The rout piles pressure on Hanover coach Andre Breitenreiter, but his side showed spirit when Marvin Bakalorz scored a late consolation against his former club before Witsel grabbed Dortmund's fifth goal on 90 minutes. ""It's up to others in the club to decide now where we go from here,"" said Breitenreiter, who helped Hanover win promotion back to the Bundesliga last season. ""This isn't about me -- it's about staying up."" Hanover started brightly at Dortmund's Signal Iduna Park when forward Henrick Weydandt forcing an early save, but it was one-way traffic thereafter as Reus hit the post on 23 minutes. Soon after, Dortmund left-back Hakimi swapped passes with Guerreiro on the edge of the area and curled his shot inside the post for the opening goal. Reus had an injury scare just before the break, clashing heads with Danish midfielder Thomas Delaney as both charged into a challenge. However, the pair shook off the collision and Reus was instrumental in a flurry of goals just after the hour mark. It started with text book counter-pressing when Hakimi robbed Hanover defender Miiko Albornoz on the edge of the box and squared to Reus who fired home his 12th league goal in 18 games. Mario Goetze claimed his second goal of the season when a sublime pass from Jadon Sancho found the Dortmund striker was unmarked to fire home. Reus set up Dortmund's fourth, cutting through the Hanover defence and passed to Guerreiro who netted with the defence cut to ribbons. The game had already turned into a rout even before a glove from Hanover goalkeeper Michael Esser denied Reus, then Sancho in quick succession. Bakalorz scored Hanover's consolation before Witsel found a gap in the defence and his shot went in off the post for his second goal in a week after netting the winner at Leipzig last weekend. Borussia Moenchengladbach joined Bayern on 39 points, but went second on goal difference with a 2-0 win at home to Augsburg. Gladbach midfielder Jonas Hofmann, linked with a move to Tottenham Hotspur, had a penalty saved just before the break before Oscar Wendt and Patrick Herrmann scored second-half goals. Bayer Leverkusen claimed their first win under new coach Peter Bosz when Germany internationals Kai Havertz, Kevin Volland and Julian Brandt netted their goals in a 3-0 victory at Wolfsburg. Hoffenheim moved into the top six with a 4-2 win at Freiburg as Andrej Kramaric scored twice while mid-table Mainz won 2-1 at home to bottom side Nuremberg with Sweden striker Robin Quaison scoring the winner. On Saturday night, Eintracht Frankfurt climbed into the top four with a 2-2 draw at Werder Bremen as striker Sebastian Haller equalised with a second-half penalty for the visitors. RB Leipzig can regain fourth place by avoiding defeat at Fortuna Duesseldorf on Sunday evening."
30,20/01/2019,20:43,Schalke see off Wolfsburg for Man City boost after Faehrmann bombshell,Bundesliga strugglers Schalke earned an important three points as captain and goalkeeper Ralf Faehrmann was dropped for Sunday's 2-1 win over Wolfsburg -- a month before their Champions League last 16 tie against Manchester City.,"The 30-year-old Faehrmann, who has made 228 appearances for Schalke, was replaced by Germany Under-21 goalkeeper Alexander Nuebel for the club's first league game after the winter break. ""That was a relief to get the win,"" said Daniel Caligiuri, who scored both goals before admitting the decision by coach Domenico Tedesco to drop Faehrmann caught the team off guard. ""It was a shock for us, Ralf is our captain, but was a bit unsure in the last few games -- we'll have to see what happens now."" Right-back Caligiuri gave the hosts the lead by converting a penalty after eight minutes, but Wolfsburg drew level midway through the first half when midfielder Elvis Rexhbecaj beat Nuebel. Schalke ensured the win, which keeps them seven points away from the bottom three, when US midfielder Weston McKennie picked out Caligiuri on the right and the 31-year-old hit the net against his former club Wolfsburg, who are sixth. Despite having qualified for the Champions League's knock-out phase, Schalke, last season's runners-up in Germany, remain just above the relegation places after losing nine of their 18 league games. They host Pep Guardiola's Manchester City in Gelsenkirchen on February 20 with the return leg on March 12. On Saturday, leaders Borussia Dortmund stayed six points clear at the top with a 1-0 win at RB Leipzig, thanks to Axel Witsel's first-half goal, in a commanding away performance without captain and playmaker Marco Reus. Defending champions Bayern Munich, who are chasing a seventh straight league title, remain second after an impressive 3-1 win at Hoffenheim on Friday as Leon Goretzka scored twice. Earlier on Sunday, veteran striker Vedad Ibisevic helped break Hertha Berlin's five-game winless streak with a hand in all three goals in their 3-1 victory at bottom side Nuremberg. Hertha earned their first win since December 8 to go seventh in the table as Ibisevic, 34, who is out of contract in June, showed his experience with a commanding performance in icy conditions. The Bosnia and Herzegovina international gave Hertha the lead after he quickly exchanged passes with strike partner Davie Selke and steered his shot past Nuremberg goalkeeper Christian Mathenia after 15 minutes for his seventh league goal this season. The hosts drew level just before the break when midfielder Hanno Behrens stabbed home a long-range shot from Eduard Loewen from the edge of the box. However, Ibisevic made sure of the three points by steering a cross from the right into the path of Ondrej Duda, who restored Hertha's lead five minutes after the break. Duda netted his second goal on 70 minutes when Ibisevic let a pass from Selkie fall to the Slovakia midfielder who crashed home his ninth goal of the season."
31,26/09/2018,22:49,Seven-up Dortmund keep heat on Bayern Munich,Teenager Achraf Hakimi scored on debut as Borussia Dortmund waltzed to a 7-0 win over Nuremberg on Wednesday to keep the heat on Bundesliga leaders Bayern Munich.,"Real Madrid loanee Hakimi, 19, scored Dortmund's third goal as Lucien Favre's side obliterated Nuremberg to move to within two points of Bayern in second place. Jacob Bruun Larsen's stylish finish gave Dortmund the lead early on, the Danish striker latching onto Christian Pulisic's through ball and lofting the ball over Fabian Bredlow in the Nuremberg goal. With Dortmund in complete control, Marco Reus doubled the lead on 32 minutes, as his long range effort was deflected past a helpless Bredlow. Hakimi's moment came just after half-time, as he rounded off a Dortmund counter attack by blasting the ball into the bottom corner from the edge of the box. Reus added another a few minutes later, and Manuel Akanji picked up his first ever Bundesliga goal before substitutes Jadon Sancho and Julian Weigl completed the rout. ""We put pressure on them from the very first minute, did our job at the back and took our chances,"" Akanji told the official club TV channel. ""It was a great feeling to score my first goal for the club."" Borussia Moenchengladbach, meanwhile, are among those chasing Dortmund after they battled to a 3-1 win over Eintracht Frankfurt to go fourth. Gladbach forced several saves from Kevin Trapp in the first half before Alassane Plea finally broke through in the 56th minute, the Frenchman rifling the ball in from a tight angle to grab his sixth goal in all competitions. Thorgan Hazard doubled the lead with a sweetly struck finish ten minutes later, and though Ante Rebic's goal gave Frankfurt a flicker of hope, it was extinguished by Nico Elvedi's 85th minute header. Elsewhere, RB Leipzig battled to a 2-0 win over Stuttgart, while Wolfsburg were held to a goalless draw in Mainz. Captain Willi Orban put Leipzig in front on the stroke of half-time, tapping in the rebound after Kevin Kampl had forced a save from Ron-Robert Zieler. Timo Werner had a goal ruled out by VAR in the second half before Jean Kevin Augustin whipped in Leipzig's second to seal the win. Wolfsburg failed to take advantage of a comedy of defensive errors from Mainz. Twice gifted possession in the first half, Josip Brekalo first struck the post on 23 minutes, and then fired the ball straight at Mainz goalkeeper Florian Mueller. Earlier, two goals from Kevin Volland saw Bayer Leverkusen continue their recovery with a 2-1 win at Fortuna Duesseldorf. After a breaking the deadlock with a tap-in after half-time, Volland nodded in Kai Havertz's elegant cross to double the lead, and Rouwen Hennings late penalty was not enough to prevent a second win in a row for Leverkusen."
32,25/08/2018,20:30,Schalke crash at Wolfsburg amid VAR chaos,A dramatic late Daniel Ginczek goal sealed Wolfsburg's shock 2-1 win over Schalke on Saturday as video assistant referee (VAR) interventions dominated the opening weekend of the Bundesliga season.,"After Nabil Bentaleb's late penalty cancelled out Wolfsburg's first-half goal by US defender John Anthony Brook, Ginzcek sealed a dramatic win by sweeping home the 94th-minute winner against Schalke, last season's runners-up in Germany's top flight. However, the game was dominated by chaotic scenes midway through the second-half at Wolfsburg's Volkswagen Arena as VAR interventions led to a flurry of card reversals. Schalke coach Domenico Tedesco later claimed he was insulted during a heated exchange with match referee Patrick Ittrich over the interventions. ""It was very one-sided, I did not have much to say,"" Tedesco replied when asked what he said to Ittrich. ""I asked the fourth official a question - a normal question - and then I was insulted. ""This means that the conversation was not very respectful from my point of view. ""Emotions are part of the game - even for the referee, which makes it okay."" Schalke were reduced to 10 men when defender Matija Nastasic was sent off for going in studs up on Wolfsburg's Dutch striker Wout Weghorst on 66 minutes. A VAR ruling meant the yellow card he was initially shown was upgraded to a red by referee Patrick Ittrich. Weghorst was then sent off moments later for barging Schalke forward Guido Burgstaller. However, his red card was downgraded to a yellow after the video assistant spotted that Burgstaller, who was subsequently booked, had shoved the Dutchman over in the penalty area. VAR chaos in Wolfsburg comes after defending champions Bayern Munich beat Hoffenheim 3-1 on Friday with the help of a controversial penalty despite the referee consulting VAR. Wolfsburg took the lead when Maximilian Arnold's corner drifted to the back post and was headed into the top corner by burly centre-back Brooks on 33 minutes. The American defender then gave away a late penalty for a kick on Schalke's Swiss striker Breel Embolo. Ex-Tottenham Hotspur midfielder Bentaleb, who had just come off the bench, fired home the 85th-minute spot kick before Ginczek struck. On Saturday night, Borussia Moenchengladbach enjoyed an impressive 2-0 win at home to Bayer Leverkusen, capped by a stunning goal from US forward Fabian Johnson. Thorgan Hazard squandered a first-half penalty when his weak shot was saved by Leverkusen goalkeeper Ramazan Ozcan. It was goalless at the break, but Gladbach were not to be denied at Borussia Park and midfielder Jonas Hofmann converted a penalty on 55 minutes before Johnson scored the goal of the opening weekend. After a superb exchange of quick passes at close quarters with Raffael, the American forward toed the ball home for a 58th-minute goal which gave Leverkusen no chance. Elsewhere, Nuremberg suffered a 1-0 defeat at Hertha Berlin on their return to the Bundesliga after a four-year absence. Hertha captain Vedad Ibisevic slammed home the first-half winner at Berlin's Olympic Stadium. Eintracht Frankfurt, under new coach Adi Huetter, made up for their shock German Cup defeat to fourth-tier minnows Ulm last weekend with a 2-0 win at Freiburg as strikers Nicolai Mueller and Sebastien Haller scored. Werder Bremen were held to a 1-1 draw at home to Hanover 96 with Hendrik Weydandt's goal for the visitors cancelled out by a late header by Bremen's Czech defender Theodor Gebre Selassie. Augsburg enjoyed a 2-1 come-back win at newly-promoted Fortuna Duesseldorf thanks to Andre Hahn's late header after Austria defender Martin Hinteregger levelled following Benito Raman's first-half goal for the hosts."
33,25/08/2018,20:12,Wolfsburg captain wears rainbow armband in fight against homophobia,Wolfsburg captain Josuha Guilavogui wore a rainbow-coloured armband on Saturday for the first time as part of the Bundesliga club's efforts to fight homophobia in football.,"The 27-year-old French midfielder led Wolfsburg to a shock 2-1 win over Schalke, last season's runners-up in Germany's top flight, as the rainbow armband made it's debut in a German league match. It is part of a club initiative started in the womens team by Swedish international Nilla Fischer. ""As a club we stand for a tolerant society,"" explained Wolfsburg's general manager Joerg Schmadtke. ""That's why we're not only taking this stance against discrimination now, but across the whole season and in all of our teams, sending out a clear signal that we stand for diversity."" The captains of all Wolfsburg's mens, womens and youth teams will wear the rainbow armbands during matches and Guilavogui says footballers have a duty as role models. ""We footballers serve as an example and we want to show that everyone is welcome in the stadium and in the club,"" said the Frenchman. ""Regardless of your skin colour or sex, who you like or if you have a physical disability and whatever your religion. ""Football is for everyone."" However, homosexuality in men's football remains largely taboo. Former West Ham, Everton, Aston Villa and Germany midfielder Thomas Hitzlsperger, who retired in 2013, was the first -- and so far only -- Bundesliga footballer to come out in 2014."
34,24/05/2018,20:55,Lyon blow Wolfsburg away in extra time to retain Champions League title,A stunning burst of goals in extra time allowed Lyon to come from behind and beat Wolfsburg 4-1 as the French side made history by winning a third straight women's Champions League title on Thursday.,"Amandine Henry, Eugenie Le Sommer and Ada Hegerberg all scored in a crazy first period of extra time to stun Wolfsburg, and substitute Camille Abily later made sure of the victory. The German champions had taken a 93rd-minute lead courtesy of their Danish star Pernille Harder, only for influential midfielder Alexandra Popp to be sent off almost immediately after. Lyon are the first side ever to lift the women's trophy three years running, and also set a new record by winning the tournament for the fifth time overall. All of those titles have come since 2011, and the dominant side in the European game overtake Frankfurt's record of four titles. It has already been a glorious first season at the helm for coach Reynald Pedros, with Lyon having won a 12th consecutive French league crown -- they can still make it a treble with the French Cup final to come against Paris Saint-Germain. The extra-time drama came after a tense 90 minutes in the third final confrontation between these two sides in six seasons. In 2013, Wolfsburg triumphed 1-0 in London for their first of back-to-back Champions League titles. Lyon gained their revenge in 2016, emerging victorious in a penalty shoot-out. This encounter was watched by a crowd of more than 14,000 in the leafy setting of Kiev's Valeriy Lobanovskyi Dynamo Stadium, just 48 hours before Real Madrid and Liverpool clash in the men's final across the Ukrainian capital. Lyon have almost become the women's equivalent of Real, with the Spanish side also going for a third successive Champions League crown on Saturday. Yet after needing penalties to beat the same opponents two years ago, and against PSG last year, it looked like Lyon might be taken all the way once again. They had enjoyed the better of the chances in normal time, but then fell behind as the game opened up completely in extra time. Harder's low strike from outside the box found the net via a deflection off Lyon skipper Wendie Renard. The German double winners were euphoric, but they were brought back down to earth within two minutes of that when Popp was shown a second yellow card. Popp could only look on in horror as France midfielder Henry broke into the box and drilled in the equaliser in the 98th minute, and 60 seconds later substitute Shanice van de Sanden set up Le Sommer to put Lyon in front against the 10 players. It was 3-1 before half-time in extra time as Van de Sanden provided another assist, this time for the prolific Norwegian Hegerberg. With Wolfsburg shell-shocked, veteran midfielder Abily came off the bench to sidefoot in the fourth."
35,23/05/2018,19:12,"Lyon, Wolfsburg cross paths once again in Champions League final","Before Real Madrid try to get their hands on a third straight Champions League crown this week, Lyon have the chance to achieve the same feat in the women's showpiece.","The dominant French club face Germany's Wolfsburg in Kiev on Thursday at the leafy Valeriy Lobanovskiy stadium, a short walk across the Ukrainian capital from where Real Madrid and Liverpool will clash on Saturday. The size of the crowd and the prize money may not be the same -- UEFA offer a bonus payment of just 250,000 euros ($294,000) to the winner. In comparison, the side that emerges victorious in the men's competition stand to collect up to 57 million euros before substantial sums related to shares of television income are added on. But this is the last time the men's and women's finals will be played in the same city, with UEFA president Aleksander Ceferin saying that decision was taken because ""the potential for women's football is limitless"". And Lyon and Wolfsburg are worthy finalists here, with this the third time in the last six editions that they have met at this stage. They torpedoed the hopes of leading English sides to make it to Kiev, with Lyon edging out Manchester City in the last four with a goal from England's Lucy Bronze, while Wolfsburg overcame Chelsea. The last 10 champions have been either French or German, with Wolfsburg themselves triumphing in 2013 -- when they beat Lyon -- and 2014. The extent to which Lyon reign supreme at home and abroad is remarkable -- they have just won a 12th consecutive French title, and have won four Champions League titles this decade. ""It is first of all down to lots and lots of hard work every day. It's in the girls' DNA, they are always looking for perfection,"" said the Lyon coach Reynald Pedros when asked how he has managed to keep his squad hungry. No club has ever won five Champions Leagues, so Lyon are hoping to make history by beating a side they already defeated in the 2016 final. Then, Lyon's triumph came on penalties, despite the prolific Norwegian Ada Hegerberg missing their first spot-kick. The French side also emerged victorious when they met in the quarter-finals last season, en route to another penalty shoot-out win in the final, against Paris Saint-Germain. ""Last year they were two quite close encounters, with just one goal between us, so we can expect a difficult game,"" said Lyon captain Wendie Renard. Wolfsburg are the German champions, and are fresh from beating Bayern Munich on penalties in the German Cup final. And they have a Scandinavian star of their own to look out for up front in Denmark's Pernille Harder. She scored one of the penalties as the Volkswagen-backed club beat Bayern at the weekend after an energy-sapping contest in the heat in Cologne. ""It was a tough game, it was warm, but it gives us energy to have won another title,"" insisted their Swedish skipper Nilla Fischer.

36,21/05/2018,22:37,Wolfsburg beat Holstein Kiel to stay in Bundesliga,"Robin Knoche crushed Holstein Kiel's dreams of promotion on Monday, as his header fired Wolfsburg to a 1-0 win in the second leg of the relegation play-off, securing Bundesliga survival.","Knoche's header 15 minutes from time ended a spirited resistance from underdogs Kiel, and saw Wolfsburg escape relegation in the play-off for a second successive season. Champions League quarter-finalists just two years ago, Wolfsburg's experience saw them through as they ground out a 4-1 aggregate win over minnows Kiel. ""Kiel made it very difficult for us,"" Wolfsburg coach Bruno Labbadia told Eurosport. ""I feel empty now, but also content. This was the hardest job I have ever had in football."" Trailing 3-1 from the first leg, the odds were stacked against Kiel, who only earned promotion to the second tier at the end of last season. That did not stop the home fans from dreaming, and they created an electric atmosphere in the 10,000 capacity Holstein-Stadion. Their hopes were dealt a cruel blow on 18 minutes, when Yunus Malli found the net for Wolfsburg. The visitors' celebrations were cut short, though, as Divock Origi was ruled offside by VAR, and the goal was disallowed. Kiel came out fighting in the second half, Aaron Seydel forcing a fine reflex save from Koen Casteels on 54 minutes. They were lucky not to go a man down minutes later, when Patrick Herrmann, already on a yellow card, crunched into Wolfsburg's Josip Brekalo. Kiel's dreams were finally extinguished on 75 minutes, when Robin Knoche broke free of his marker at a corner and sent a powerful header past goalkeeper Kenneth Kronholm. Hope was briefly restored for the home side five minutes from time when they bundled the ball in at a corner. Once again, though, the goal was disallowed by VAR, after Rafael Czichos was judged to have handled the ball. ""The emotions came after the final whistle,"" said Kiel coach Markus Anfang, who was seen crying after the game. ""The lads gave so much. It's one thing not to be promoted, but it was also bitter to lose the game, because we were clearly the better team today."""
37,16/05/2018,16:22,Holstein who? Origi blunder leaves Wolfsburg red-faced,"VfL Wolfsburg were left red-faced before Thursday's Bundesliga relegation play-off, first-leg, at home to Holstein Kiel after their striker Divock Origi admitted never having heard of the second division minnows.","The Belgian international, 23, who has scored six goals this season on loan from Liverpool, blundered at the weekend on German national television by confessing he knew nothing about Wolfsburg's play-off opponents. ""You have to concede that to a foreign player. I can assure you: he now knows who Holstein Kiel is, but it's not ideal - that's clear,"" admitted Wolfsburg's coach Bruno Labbadia. In Origi's defence, most German football fans would struggle to name a single Holstein Kiel player before the David verses Goliath clash at Wolfsburg's sold-out stadium with the decisive second leg in Kiel next Monday. Likewise, Wolfsburg's French midfielder Josuha Guilavogui was reportedly not previously aware that Kiel striker Marvin Ducksch was the second division's top-scorer with 18 goals this season. ""This shows what different worlds are meeting,"" said Holstein captain Rafael Czichos. ""Here are players, who play at World Cups or come from Liverpool, playing against us, who know football from a slightly different side."" Holstein are on the verge of two promotions in as many seasons after coming up from the third division in 2016/17, while Wolfsburg have fallen from grace. Just two seasons ago, when Kiel were fighting to stay in the second division, Wolfsburg pulled off a stunning 2-0 home win against Cristiano Ronaldo's Real Madrid in the Champions League quarter-finals, but bowed out after a 3-0 away defeat. After finishing 16th in the table for the second year running, Wolfsburg, the 2015 German Cup winners and 2009 Bundesliga champions, must again win a play-off to stay in Germany's top flight. In financial terms, the clubs are poles apart. Wolfsburg's budget for their squad is reportedly 60 million euros ($70.8m) -- ten times that of Kiel, who are in the play-off after finishing third in the second division. ""In Wolfsburg, a single player earns as much as our entire time, but we want to go up,"" said Holstein's sports boss Ralf Becker. The pressure is on Wolfsburg, who have had three coaches this season. ""It (the play-off) is bigger than a cup game, at the end we can still go down and we can't afford to be arrogant,"" said Guilavogui. Relegation would be a nightmare for Volkswagen-backed Wolfsburg, but promotion would also present Kiel with a headache. Their Holstein Stadium holds only 11,000, short of the minimum allowed capacity of 15,000 under Bundesliga regulations and according to reports, Kiel have approached Hanover 96 about a possible ground share."
38,04/05/2018,02:10,Hamburg adopt knock-out mentality for survival fight,"Midfielder Lewis Holtby says Hamburg must treat Saturday's match at Eintracht Frankfurt as ""a cup semi-final"" if they want to avoid a historic first relegation from the Bundesliga.","Second-bottom Hamburg are five points from safety with two league games left -- at Eintracht Frankfurt and then at home to Borussia Moenchengladbach -- as they bid to avoid slipping out of the top flight for the first time. But they sit just two points behind Wolfsburg, who occupy 16th place, which provides the solace of a relegation play-off against the team who finish third in the second tier. Holtby says, from a Hamburg perspective, those remaining games against clubs fighting for European places next season are effectively knock-out matches. ""This is our 'semi-final',"" said Holtby, who has scored four goals in Hamburg's last five games to breathe life into their survival hopes. ""We aren't dead yet. I believe 100 percent that we can rescue things."" Hamburg are the only club to have played in every season since the Bundesliga was established in 1963 -- when even mighty Bayern Munich were still a second-division club. A seven-point gap at the start of April has been slashed by wins over fellow strugglers Freiburg, 1-0 at home a fortnight ago, and Wolfsburg, 3-1 away last Saturday. Three wins in their last four games have given belief to Hamburg's players and fans alike, but they need Wolfsburg to drop more points. Moreover, they are facing a Frankfurt side eager to bounce back from a 4-1 mauling at champions Bayern Munich, which followed a 3-0 home defeat by Hertha Berlin. ""We have not achieved anything yet, if we want to get over the line, then we need further victories,"" said Christian Titz, Hamburg's third coach since January. Hamburg have fallen on hard times in recent seasons, needing to win the relegation play-off in both 2013/14 and 2014/15 to stay up. This season has been a disaster. Hamburg were second from bottom with 15 points from 19 games when Markus Gisdol was sacked as head coach in late January. Former player Bernd Hollerbach took over, but was soon dismissed after failing to win any of his seven games, admitting ""we need a miracle"". Titz was promoted from the reserves and the 47-year-old has coaxed three wins from his six games to turn the corner. ""We are playing a totally different style of football, the coach has his own ideas and sticks to them,"" enthused midfielder Aaron Hunt. Hamburg need Wolfsburg to slip up either this Saturday at RB Leipzig, who are winless in their last five games and fighting to keep a Europa League place, or at home to Cologne, who are already relegated. Having already had their relegation confirmed last weekend, bottom side Cologne host champions Bayern Munich, who are licking their wounds after their agonising Champions League exit in midweek. Bayern, who sealed a sixth straight league title last month, hold a massive 24-point lead in the table. Coach Jupp Heynckes is sure to rotate after they drew 2-2 at Real Madrid on Wednesday to lose their Champions League semi-final 4-3 on aggregate. Saturday's fixtures (all 1330 GMT) Borussia Dortmund v Mainz, RB Leipzig v Wolfsburg, Cologne v Bayern Munich, Werder Bremen v Bayer Leverkusen, Borussia Moenchengladbach v Freiburg, Eintracht Frankfurt v Hamburg, Augsburg v Schalke, Hanover 96 v Hertha Berlin, Stuttgart v Hoffenheim"
39,03/03/2018,21:16,Three-star Reus targets World Cup after Dortmnd leveller,Marco Reus underlined his brilliant return from a serious knee injury by scoring in his third straight Bundesliga game on Saturday as Borussia Dortmund drew 1-1 at RB Leipzig.,"After eight months sidelined having torn his cruciate knee ligament in last May's German Cup final, Germany winger Reus now has three goals in four games. Having missed Germany's 2014 World Cup victory with torn ankle ligaments and Euro 2016 with a groin injury, the fleet-footed Reus is even more determined to help defend the global title at Russia 2018. ""I'd be lying if I said that I didn't think about the World Cup and really want to be there,"" he told Bundesliga.com before kick-off. ""I won't make a secret of the fact it's a big goal of mine to be there. I know I've got a good chance, if I'm playing well."" Reus was a constant threat on Saturday and involved in the build up when striker Michy Batshuayi tapped home on 16 minutes, but Andre Schuerrle, who supplied the final pass, was offside. Leipzig took the lead when Liverpool-bound Naby Keita, back after a thigh injury, played a pass through Dortmund's defence which Jean-Kevin Augustin tucked away on 29 minutes. Having also had an earlier goal flagged for offside, Reus made no mistake at the second attempt, sprinting onto Batshuayi's well-timed pass and equalised seven minutes from half time. With an hour gone, Batshuayi, on loan from Chelsea, bungled the chance to grab the winner with the goal at his mercy. Leipzig, who picked up a point after three defeats, stay sixth. Dortmund coach Peter Stoeger is unbeaten in his ten league games in charge. ""I am happy with the 90 minutes, we are in the group fighting for Champions League places, it'll stay that way until the end of the season, and our goal is to qualify,"" said the Austrian. The result leaves Dortmund third after Schalke had earlier snatched second spot with a 1-0 home win against Hertha Berlin. Marko Pjaca, on loan from Juventus, claimed his second goal in five league games when Daniel Caligiuri whipped in a cross and Franco di Santo let the ball roll to Pjaca, who scored on 37 minutes. Schalke are 17 points behind runaway leaders Bayern, who play mid-table Freiburg on Sunday. Reports Bayern approached Freiburg boss Christian Streich last month to replace Jupp Heynckes as head coach next season have added extra spice to the game. Eintracht Frankfurt are fourth after their 1-0 win at home to mid-table Hanover as defender Danny da Costa scored their winner. Argentina striker Lucas Alario converted a first-half penalty and Julian Brandt scored with a superb chip as Bayer Leverkusen consolidated fifth place with a 2-1 win at ten-man Wolfsburg. Admir Mehmedi scored the consolation effort for Wolfsburg against his former club. The hosts finished with ten men when Brazilian left-back William was sent off for a second yellow card in added time. It finished goalless, but there was plenty of drama in Hamburg's basement battle at home to Mainz. Hamburg winger Filip Kostic hit the woodwork and had a goal ruled off side in the first half. Mainz had Nigeria defender Leon Balogun sent off for a second yellow card when he fouled Luca Waldschmidt in the area on 61 minutes. The referee pointed to the spot, but Kostic's weak attempt was saved by goalkeeper Florian Mueller on his Bundesliga debut. Hamburg are now seven points behind 16th-placed Mainz and on course for a first relegation in the club's history. ""Giving up is not in my nature, but we need a small miracle,"" admitted Hamburg coach Bernd Hollerbach. Having been booed by his own fans last weekend, the pressure eased on Hoffenheim coach Julian Nagelsmann with a 2-0 win at Augsburg. Croatia striker Andrej Kramaric scored for the fifth match in a row before Germany winger Serge Gnabry added a superb second after the break."
40,23/02/2018,02:10,Five things to look out for in the Bundesliga,"Bayern Munich coach Jupp Heynckes will be chasing a 38-year-old club record when his team host Hertha Berlin on Saturday, but will do so without the injured James Rodriguez.","Heynckes is looking to become the first Bayern coach to win 15 games in a row as his team look to consolidate a commanding 19-point lead at the top of the Bundesliga. Second-place Borussia Dortmund host Augsburg on Monday, with fans from both sides set to boycott the game. Elsewhere, Bruno Labbadia takes charge of Wolfsburg for the first time against Mainz on Friday, while RB Leipzig look set to host Cologne without star midfielder Naby Keita. Here are five things to look out for in this weekend's Bundesliga action: Jupp Heynckes has worked wonders since returning to Bayern Munich, and on Saturday he looks set to break an incredible club record. Heynckes, who has led Bayern to 23 victories in 24 games since October, could now become the first Bayern coach ever to win 15 games in a row. The 72-year-old watched his side romp to victory over Besiktas in midweek to pick up a 14th consecutive win, equalling a club record set under Pal Csernai back in 1980. Bayern are expected to be without James Rodriguez, who was forced to leave the pitch after 44 minutes against Besiktas with a calf problem. A diagnosis on Wednesday confirmed that the Colombian will be out of action for no more than a few days. More fan protests are expected this Monday when Borussia Dortmund take on Augsburg in the Bundesliga's second Monday night fixture. Last week's inaugural Monday game saw fierce protests from Eintracht Frankfurt fans, who blew whistles and held up banners in protest at the new scheduling. This Monday, both Dortmund and Augsburg fan groups are expected to continue protests. Around 300 Dortmund fan clubs have reportedly signed up to a boycott led by the influential fan group ""Suedtribuene Dortmund"". ""We accept every opinion and every protest, as long as it is carried out peacefully,"" said Dortmund CEO Hans-Joachim Watzke. RB Leipzig will be without star midfielder Naby Keita when they host Cologne on Sunday evening. The Guinean midfielder left the field after just an hour in Leipzig's defeat to Frankfurt on Monday, having pulled his hamstring. Captain Willi Orban is also a doubt after suffering a cut to his knee in a collision with Frankfurt's Sebastien Haller on Monday. Coach Ralph Hasenhuettl, though, claimed that the injuries were not a disaster for his team, as Leipzig look to muscle their way back into the top four this weekend. ""We have enough quality to replace both of them,"" insisted Hasenhuettl. Bruno Labbadia takes charge of Wolfsburg for the first time on Friday evening, as the Wolves travel to Mainz for a crucial bottom of the table clash. Labbadia took charge of the struggling Wolves after Martin Schmidt's sudden resignation earlier this week, and is now tasked with leading the club back to safety. ""We have to use every hour available to us,"" said Labbadia. ""I will demand of my players that they invest everything into this fight."" Relegation threatened Hamburg find themselves in last chance saloon ahead of Saturday's visit to arch rivals Werder Bremen. Hamburg have not won in 10 games, and are now six points from safety as they prepare for a must-win game over fellow strugglers Bremen. ""The derby is coming just at the right time,"" said Hamburg's Aaron Hunt. ""It is a great chance for us to turn things around.""

41,20/02/2018,14:54,Wolfsburg turn to Labbadia in relegation fight,Wolfsburg on Tuesday appointed Bruno Labbadia as their new head coach in their fight to avoid relegation from the Bundesliga.,"The 52-year-old Labbadia has stepped in after Martin Schmidt resigned from the 2015 German Cup winners on Monday after just five months in the job. Under Swiss coach Schmidt, Wolfsburg won just five of their last 22 matches to leave them 14th and just a point from the relegation places in the German league table. Labbadia, who has coached at Stuttgart, Hamburg and Leverkusen in Germany's top flight, has experience of winning relegation battles. The former striker kept Hamburg up in 2015-16, but was later dismissed after starting the 2016-17 season with a draw and four straight league defeats. He has not coached a team since September 2016, when Hamburg sacked him. ""I feel well, rested and am looking forward to working with my new team,"" said Labbadia in a statement. He has a contract until June 2019, but Wolfsburg can ill afford another mistake with the appointment after a series of short tenures. Schmidt's predecessor Andries Jonker was sacked last September after six months having in turn replaced Valerien Ismael, who had lasted just four months. Dieter Hecking, who won 2015 German Cup and reached the Champions League quarter-finals in 2015-16, was head coach from 2012 until his sacking in October 2016. ""Bruno Labbadia is a very experienced coach who has proven his qualities in the Bundesliga several times,"" said Wolfsburg's director of sport Olaf Rebbe."
42,19/02/2018,19:55,Schmidt quits Wolfsburg after five months,"Wolfsburg have parted company with head coach Martin Schmidt by mutual consent after just five wins in 22 matches in charge, the Bundesliga club announced Monday.","The 50-year-old Swiss had only been at the helm for five months. Schmidt told Wolfsburg he was stepping down ""to improve the current situation with new impulses from the coaching bank"", the club said in a statement. Schmidt's last game was Saturday's 2-1 home defeat by runaway league leaders Bayern Munich, who needed a 91st-minute penalty to seal the win. Wolfsburg say Schmidt walked away to ""relieve the increasing public pressure -- and especially against him personally -- on the club"". He took over in September after predecessor Andries Jonker was sacked. Schmidt leaves with the 2015 German Cup winners 14th in the table and only one point above the relegation play-off place. The club said a caretaker coach will be announced on Tuesday ahead of Friday's league game at Mainz, who are third from bottom."
43,18/02/2018,20:50,Five things we learned from the Bundesliga,"Arjen Robben missed his first penalty in six years, but that didn't stop Bayern Munich from snatching victory against Wolfsburg and taking their lead to 19 points. Borussia Dortmund moved up to second after Marco Reus fired them to victory over Borussia Moenchengladbach, but RB Leipzig could yet overtake them with a win against Eintracht Frankfurt on Monday. Elsewhere, Mario Gomez lifted Stuttgart away from the relegation zone with a winner against Augsburg.","Here are five talking points from this weekend's Bundesliga action. Arjen Robben stirred unhappy memories in Bayern Munich's 2-1 win against Wolfsburg, missing a penalty for the first time since the 2012 Champions League Final. Robben's penalty misery six years ago marked a low point in his career, as opponents Chelsea went on to win the title. The Dutchman had not missed a spot-kick since for Bayern until he failed to beat Koen Casteels from 12 yards on Saturday. He would quickly make amends, however, providing the assist for Bayern's equaliser and winning the penalty for Robert Lewandowski's injury-time winner. ""If you pick up an assist and win a penalty after having missed one earlier in the game, I think you can be happy,"" said Robben. Marco Reus marked his return to fitness with a fine goal on Sunday, but it was the playing surface which made the headlines as Borussia Dortmund beat Borussia Moenchengladbach. Ravaged by both cold and wet weather in recent weeks, the pitch at the Borussia Park was in a dreadful condition, and became steadily worse as the game progressed. Referee Bastian Dankert chose to let the game go ahead, however, and bobbling balls and a slippy surface were not enough to stop Reus from lashing in a brilliant first-half winner for Dortmund. Breel Embolo netted what would be the decisive goal in Schalke's 2-1 victory over Hoffenheim on Saturday, and immediately dedicated his winner to the team's video analyst. The Swiss international took advantage of a mistake by Hoffenheim's Kevin Vogt, intercepting a pass across the defensive line and sliding the ball effortlessly past goalkeeper Oliver Baumann. ""At least 80 per cent of the goal belongs to our video analyst,"" admitted Embolo. ""We knew in advance that Vogt has a tendency to play brave passes, and that sometimes he is too brave."" Mario Gomez will be hoping that his winner for Stuttgart on Sunday will have caught the eye of Germany coach Joachim Loew. The 32-year-old has his sights set on a return to the national team set-up for this summer's World Cup in Russia. ""Joachim Loew knows that he can rely on me,"" he told Welt. ""The important thing is that he sees I am fit, that I have energy and self-confidence. At the moment, I have all those things, 100 per cent."" Gomez certainly showed that on Sunday, as his first-half strike inspired Stuttgart to a first away win of the season. The video assistant referee was once again the subject of controversy. Cologne were left furious when Claudio Pizarro's late winner against Hanover was ruled out with the help of VAR, and there was confusion in Augsburg after Michael Gregoritsch's equaliser was disallowed after a full two minutes of discussion. ""It's not about whether the decision is right or not, it's that it seems arbitrary when the referee chooses to use VAR,"" said Cologne goalkeeper Timo Horn. ""Anyone who loves football has lost something this season."""
44,17/02/2018,20:44,Last-gasp Lewandowski penalty rescues Bayern at Wolfsburg,Robert Lewandowski converted a 91st-minute penalty to rescue Bundesliga leaders Bayern Munich with a 2-1 win at Wolfsburg on Saturday which took their winning streak to 13 and extended their advantage at the top of the table to 21 points.,"With Bayern hosting Besiktas in the last 16, first leg of the Champions League on Tuesday, they rested several stars and were almost made to pay. Wolfsburg striker Daniel Didavi gave the hosts an early lead while Bayern winger Arjen Robben had a second-half penalty saved. However, Sandro Wagner headed Bayern level in the 64th minute before substitute Lewandowski hit the winning penalty in injury time. The win stretched Bayern's runaway lead to 21 points as they steam towards a sixth straight title. ""This will to win games, even though it does not seem to be exciting at the top (of the table), makes it fun. This team is just awesome,"" said Bayern captain Thomas Mueller. Bayern coach Jupp Heynckes named a weakened team with David Alaba, Jerome Boateng, Mats Hummels, Joshua Kimmich, Mueller and Lewandowski starting on the bench. Wolfsburg profited from Bayern's slow start after only eight minutes when Yunus Malli's cross was headed home by Didavi. Bayern winger Franck Ribery was then booked when the video referee spotted he had swatted Renato Steffen in the face in a challenge for the ball. It was 1-0 at the break, but Bayern were awarded a penalty when Steffen barged over Corentin Tolisso in the area on 53 minutes. Steffen was booked for his furious protest, but Wolfsburg goalkeeper Koen Casteels palmed Robben's spot-kick onto the post. Bayern drew level when Robben's cross was met in the middle by Wagner -- Lewandowski's back-up -- to head home on 64 minutes. Heynckes responded by bringing on Mueller, Alaba and Lewandowski in the final half an hour. When Germany Under-19 international Gian-Luca Itter pulled Robben back in the area, the referee pointed to the spot. Casteels got a glove to the ball, but Lewandowski claimed his 20th league goal this season with the last-gasp penalty. RB Leipzig are at Eintracht Frankfurt in the Bundesliga's first Monday night kick-off, which allowed Bayer Leverkusen to climb to second with a 2-1 win at Hamburg. Leon Bailey continued his stellar season by rounding Hamburg's goalkeeper Christian Mathenia on 40 minutes. It was the 20-year-old Jamaican's ninth league goal this season. Leverkusen's 18-year-old striker Kai Havertz doubled their lead after the break, finishing a move Bailey started. Hamburg forward Andre Hahn came off the bench to claim a consolation goal. Schalke climbed to fifth with a 2-1 win at home to Hoffenheim, whose captain Kevin Vogt gave away the winning goal with a howler of an error. With Schalke 1-0 up in Gelsenkirchen, Vogt's lazy pass across his goal was intercepted by Breel Embolo. With Hoffenheim's goalkeeper out of position the Swiss striker tapped into an empty net on 28 minutes, before Andrej Kramaric headed a consolation goal for the visitors. The result leaves just a point separating second-placed Leverkusen from Schalke in fifth. Freiburg captain Nils Petersen converted a first-half penalty in their 1-0 win at home to Werder Bremen in persistent falling snow. The win ended Freiburg's three-match run without a victory while Bremen stay just above the relegation places. Bottom side Cologne remain nine points from safety as they drew 1-1 at home to Hanover. Japan striker Yuya Osako gave Cologne an early lead before Hanover forward Niclas Fuellkrug equalised with his 10th league goal of the season. In the dying stages, 39-year-old Claudio Pizarro came off the Cologne bench and had the ball in the net, but his header was ruled offside. On Sunday, Borussia Dortmund can go second with a win at Borussia Moenchengladbach as Michy Batshuayi looks to add to his five goals in three games."
45,11/02/2018,20:44,"Kainz brace boosts Bremen survival bid, Ginczek gives Stuttgart hope","Florian Kainz netted two superb goals in Werder Bremen's 3-1 Bundesliga win at home to Wolfsburg on Sunday, helping ease his side's relegation worries.","Stuttgart also boosted their chances of Bundesliga survival with a 1-0 victory over Borussia Moenchengladbach. Werder finished the weekend three points above the relegation zone in 15th with Stuttgart a point and a place above that. Swedish defender Ludwig Augustinsson headed Bremen into an early lead before Austrian international Kainz curled a long-range shot inside the far post on 40 minutes at Bremen's Weser Stadion. Wolfsburg captain Paul Verhaegh gave the visitors hope by converting a penalty early in the second half. However, Bremen sealed the win after midfielder Maximilian Eggestein won possession and striker Max Kruse sent Kainz in behind the defence, the Austrian slotting an ice-cool finish past ex-Bremen goalkeeper Koen Casteels with 18 minutes left. The win leaves Bremen unbeaten in their last seven homes games in all competitions, while Wolfsburg are 13th, but only four points from danger. Earlier, Stuttgart got their first victory under new coach Tayfun Korkut as striker Daniel Ginczek netted the only goal of the game. Korkut, 43, a German-born former Turkey international, was brought in as head coach a fortnight ago to stop Stuttgart's slide after predecessor Hannes Wolf was sacked following a run of seven defeats in eight league games. After overseeing Stuttgart's 1-1 draw at Wolfsburg last weekend, Korkut got off to a winning start at Stuttgart's Mercedes Benz Arena. Just five minutes in, veteran Germany striker Mario Gomez threaded a pass between two defenders for Ginczek to sprint onto and cooly slot home his fourth league goal of the season. Gladbach had their chances as Josip Drmic, Brazil forward Raffael and Germany striker Lars Stindl all went agonisingly close for the visitors, who have now suffered three straight league defeats. This was only Stuttgart's fifth league win since October. Erratic Moenchengladbach drop to tenth despite being the only team other than Hoffenheim to beat runaway leaders Bayern Munich in the Bundesliga this season. On Saturday, Bayern's Robert Lewandowski scored for the 11th straight home league match, equalling the Bundesliga record, with Thomas Mueller also netting in a 2-1 win over Schalke that left Munich 18 points clear."

Cameroon-born Ntep joined Wolfsburg for five million euros ($6.14 million) last January from Rennes, but failed to score in 15 Bundesliga appearances and has started just once in the league this season. Struggling Saint-Etienne ended a 10-match winless streak in Ligue 1 by beating Toulouse 2-0 on Sunday, but remain only four points above the relegation zone."
47,22/12/2017,12:10,Mario Gomez heads back to Stuttgart,"Experienced German international striker Mario Gomez is to move to Stuttgart from Wolfsburg, rejoining the team he left eight years ago.","Gomez, 32, came through the Stuttgart youth system and won the 2007 Bundesliga title with the club. ""I am very happy to return home, to the place where it all began,"" he said. The transfer fee was around three million euros ($3.5 million), according to German sports agency SID. Gomez has scored 151 Bundesliga goals and has played 71 times for Germany, scoring 31 goals. ""With Mario Gomez, we will have a scorer of the highest quality,"" Stuttgart's sporting director Michael Reschke said. Germany coach Joachim Loew left Gomez out of his 2014 World Cup squad, but recalled him for Euro 2016. Gomez abruptly left Besiktas in 2016 after the coup attempt against Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and joined the Volkswagen-backed Wolfsburg side."

Lucas Alario restored the lead for Leverkusen on the hour mark, but Wolfsburg were level again within 10 minutes. Daniel Didavi came off the bench to set up Jakub Blaszczykowski, who slotted the ball past Bernd Leno. The draw extended Wolfsburg's winless streak to six games, but coach Martin Schmidt was positive about his side's performance. ""It was a good point to win,"" said Schmidt. ""After the last game, I felt that we had lost two points, today I feel we have won one."" Werder Bremen are still searching for their first win of the season after suffering a 2-0 defeat at home to Borussia Moenchengladbach. Gladbach had the lion's share of the chances in the first half, and were rewarded on 27 minutes when Lars Stindl curled the ball around Jiri Pavlenka to open the scoring.

Further chances followed in the second half, as Thorgan Hazard was denied by Pavlenka and Stindl hit the post late on.

Jonker's entire backroom staff, including assistant coach and Arsenal legend Fredrik Ljungberg, have also been fired. The new coach, who both magazine Kicker and Sky Sports News claim will be ex-Mainz coach Martin Schmidt, is expected to take his first session on Monday afternoon ahead of Tuesday's Bundesliga match at home to Werder Bremen. Then follows a tough away match at Bayern Munich on Friday. ""We have two difficult games ahead of us this week, but we didn't want to implement a caretaker solution, rather install a new head-coach with immediate effect,"" explained director of sport Olaf Rebbe. A statement by Wolfsburg's supervisory board said they felt the team's development had stagnated. ""Decisive for us in taking this step was not just the impression made upon us during the game against Stuttgart, but rather based upon the perception of stagnated development amongst the team, which was to a great extent newly formed during the summer,"" said Wolfsburg's board. ""We expressly wish to thank Andries Jonker and his coaching staff, for rescuing VfL's position in the top-flight at the last minute at the end of last season."""

The 32-year-old suffered fractures of the eye socket, the nose and the upper jaw when the knee of Wolfsburg goalkeeper Koen Casteels caught him flush in the face late in Stuttgart's 1-0 Bundesliga win on Saturday. Only the quick reactions of Stuttgart's team doctor prevented a tragedy as Gentner, a former Germany international, had swallowed his tongue in the collision. Reschke says he has exchanged text messages with Gentner in hospital and the midfielder ""will now determine the timing of his recovery, when he can talk again,"" added Reschke. ""We really need to be happy that in some ways he got off lightly,"" said Reschke. As Gentner lay knocked-out on the pitch, ""my heart stopped. The terrible fears, which we all initially had, didn't come true. Thank God,"" added Reschke. Gentner is expected to be out for several months, but ""he will still be a very important figure for this team this season,"" added Reschke. The Stuttgart boss says he expects goalkeepers will rethink how they challenge for the ball in future. ""I think Casteels will not do the same thing again in the next match and that many other Bundesliga goalkeepers will be thinking about how they will go into challenges in the future, at least not with this aggressiveness,"" added Reschke."

""That was a shock for us all, they were dramatic minutes,"" said Stuttgart coach Hannes Wolf. ""We had tremendous fear that what happened could have left lasting damage. ""We couldn't enjoy the win, our thoughts are with our captain. ""He has definitely got a bad concussion, probably broken a few bones, but the doctor says he will make a full recovery."" Gentner's team-mates were shaken after witnessing the collision. ""I am sad about what happened and Gentner's health is in my thoughts,"" said Stuttgart defender Denis Aogo. ""I wish him all the best, hope there are no lasting consequences and that he is back soon."" The 32-year-old Gentner made five international appearances for Germany in 2009/10."

The 33-year-old Benaglio, who has played at three World Cups and won the Bundesliga with Wolfsburg in 2009, has signed a three-year deal at Monaco. The imposing 6ft 4in (1.93m) 'keeper told Monaco's website how honoured and excited he was about the move after proving himself with 259 Bundesliga games.

""He will bring all of his experience to our squad,"" Vasilyev said listing off Euros, World Cups and the several trophies he has won with Wolfsburg.

Yanus Malli's shot was saved, but the ball fell to the Portugal winger, who hit the back of the net with a first-time strike from the edge of the area. It was heartbreak for Braunschweig, who finished third in Germany's second division to earn their chance to face Wolfsburg, the 2009 German champions who finished 16th in the Bundesliga. Braunschweig will play in the second division next season, while VfB Stuttgart and Hanover 96 were automatically promoted to the top flight, taking the place of Darmstadt and Ingolstadt, who were relegated."
57,21/05/2017,20:47,Wolfsburg go from beating Real to brink of relegation,Wolfsburg have one final chance to avoid relegation from the Bundesliga after the 2009 champions went from stunning Real Madrid to the brink of Germany's second division inside 13 months.,"In April 2016, Wolfsburg produced a superb display to shock Cristiano Ronaldo's Real 2-0 in their home leg of last season's Champions League quarter-finals. Ronaldo scored a hat-trick in Real's 3-0 return-leg victory at the Bernabeu six days later to reach the semi-finals, en route to winning the 2015/16 title, and Wolfsburg bowed out 3-2 on aggregate. Fast forward to Saturday and Wolfsburg's 2-1 defeat at Hamburg saw them finish 16th in the German league, capping a disastrous season in which they have gone through three coaches. Having reached the Bundesliga for the first time in 1997, Wolfsburg, backed by embattled car-manufacturer Volkswagen, are now just a play-off away from returning to the second division. They host second-division side Eintracht Braunschweig on Thursday in the first of two legs which will determine their survival, with the return fixture on May 29. ""I'm speechless. Football is brutal,"" fumed Wolfsburg's Germany striker Mario Gomez, who signed from Fiorentina last August, after their defeat in Hamburg. ""Now we have got what we've deserved -- an extra round of matches!"" Wolfsburg's fall from grace has been rapid. After winning the 2009 Bundesliga title, which included a 5-1 thrashing of Bayern Munich, Wolfsburg won the 2015 German Cup final, finishing second in the league in 2014/15. They beat Bayern 5-4 in a penalty shoot-out to win the German Super Cup in August 2015 having humbled the Bavarian giants 4-1 in the league the previous January. But the August 2015 sale of chief playmaker Kevin de Bruyne, who insisted Wolfsburg let him join Manchester City, sparked a downturn in their fortunes. His replacement, Julian Draxler, was signed on a five-year deal just days after De Bruyne's departure -- but stayed less than 18 months. With Draxler in the attacking midfield role, Wolfsburg reached the last eight of the Champions League a year ago -- the furthest the club had ever gone in Europe. They bowed out to Real in the quarters, but not before Draxler's majestic display in their 2-0 home win over the Spanish giants, and finished eighth in the league last season. However, Draxler returned from Euro 2016 with Germany last July insisting he wanted to leave. He was eventually dropped after a series of lacklustre displays, booed by his own fans when he came off the bench in December, and sold to Paris Saint-Germain in January. Wolfsburg have been towards the bottom of the table since the first few weeks of this season. Dieter Hecking was sacked as head coach in October, his replacement Valerien Ismael was fired in February, while director of sport Klaus Allofs was dismissed in December. The relegation writing was on the wall for Wolfsburg after their 6-0 thrashing at home to Bayern Munich, who secured a fifth straight German league title, at the end of April. Four points in their final three games has not been enough to halt their slide down the table and head coach Andries Jonker only has two more matches left to keep them up. ""If we combine an order (in our game) with a fighting spirit, then we are one of the best teams in the Bundesliga,"" said the Dutchman, who gave up his post as head of Arsenal's academy in February to help Wolfsburg. ""It is unbelievable that we are in 16th place, but we have to keep going and win the relegation play-off."""

Gomez netted his third goal when he converted a penalty -- awarded on 86 minutes by referee Deniz Aytekin. The controversial spot-kick in Leverkusen was awarded when Wolfsburg winger Jakub Blaszczykowski was brought down by Bayer defender Benjamin Henrichs, who made contact with the ball first. The decision incensed Voeller. ""The penalty against us was ridiculous,"" fumed Voeller, Leverkusen's director of sport. Aytekin had missed an earlier foul on Gomez which could have led to a penalty, so the Germany striker was in no mood to hear complaints about the referee. ""If Leverkusen really want to start talking about the referee, then Rudi Voeller -- I'm sorry -- has a bit of a distorted view,"" said Gomez. ""If you play the sort of game like Leverkusen do, you don't stand there and have a go at the ref -- that's unsportsmanlike."" But Voeller, who is known for his post-match rants when things do not go Leverkusen's way, says he has no problem with Gomez. ""I have nothing at all against Mario Gomez and I can understand the fact he sees things differently. You have to be able to do that,"" he said. ""This does not change my assessment that it was definitely not a penalty."" Wolfsburg and Bayer Leverkusen are both just above the relegation mire in Germany's top tier with eight games left. Leverkusen are away to bottom side Darmstadt on Wednesday the same night Wolfsburg host mid-table Freiburg."

The left-back played 256 Bundesliga games, an outfield club record, and won the last of his eight Germany caps in 2010. ""Wolfsburg has become home for my family and I but this move to America is a dream come true for us,"" he said, having made his last Bundesliga appearance in December.

Jonker has a contract until June 2018 and replaces Valerien Ismael, who left on Sunday after Wolfsburg's 2-1 defeat at home to Werder Bremen. The Dutchman is Wolfsburg's third coach this season, after they also sacked Dieter Hecking in October. Friday's loss left the 2015 German Cup winners just two points from the relegation spots after only six wins from 22 league games. ""We need to solve a small problem here,"" said Jonker, eyeing up the relegation battle at the 2009 German champions. He says his priority is to find out why Wolfsburg have lost five of their last six matches in all competitions despite spending 33 million euros ($35m) on new players in January. His task has not been made easier by Wolfsburg's director of sport Olaf Rebbe setting a target of 40 Bundesliga points -- meaning six wins from their final 12 league games. ""Andries Jonker knows VfL Wolfsburg and has kept regular contact with the club since his move to London,"" said Rebbe. ""Both of these factors were decisive in being able to realise this top solution in a short period of time. ""He is a coach with international experience and a proven tactician who brings with him the best conditions to help get VfL quickly and sustainably back on the path to success."" The 54-year-old Jonker has plenty of experience of German league football. He was Louis van Gaal's assistant at Bayern from 2009 until April 2011 when he stepped up as caretaker coach until the end of the season after van Gaal was sacked. Jonker then had a stint as Wolfsburg's assistant coach from 2012 to 2014 when he left to become the head of Arsenal's academy. Wolfsburg finished second to Bayern Munich in 2014/15 and were eighth last season, but their fall from grace has been dramatic this campaign.

Carlo Ancelotti's Bayern were the only club in the league's top six to win this weekend after Arturo Vidal and Arjen Robben scored last-minute goals in Saturday's 2-0 win at strugglers Ingolstadt. They now have a seven-point lead at the top. Hosts Wolfsburg deserved to beat Hoffenheim and break their three-match losing streak to stay 14th, now six points from the relegation places. Hoffenheim made a bright start at the Volkswagen Arena after Kerem Demirbay hit the crossbar with an early free-kick, then set up Steven Zuber to give them a deserved lead on 26 minutes. But Wolfsburg roared back with two second-half goals and Germany striker Mario Gomez was only denied a third when goal-line technology showed the ball had not crossed the line. Maximilian Arnold latched onto the end of a wayward clearance kick and hammered his shot home on 50 minutes to pull the scores level. Then Didavi produced a close-range header on 73 minutes for the winner. Hoffenheim stay fifth as the latest to stumble in the pack chasing Bayern. On Saturday, second-placed Leipzig lost for the second week in a row in crashing 3-0 at home to Hamburg, who escaped the bottom three. RB were two goals down after 24 minutes in a nightmare first-half, conceding two headers from near identical situations from centre-back Kyriakos Papadopoulos and Brazil midfielder Walace. Hamburg grabbed a third on 93 minutes when replacement Aaron Hunt scored with his first touch. Third-placed Frankfurt lost 3-0 at Bayer Leverkusen as Javier 'Chicharito' Hernandez scored two superb goals to take the pressure off coach Roger Schmidt following back-to-back defeats. Fourth-placed Dortmund crashed 2-1 at bottom side Darmstadt as Thomas Tuchel named three teenagers in Borussia's starting line-up in Dzenis Burnic, Christian Pulisic and Emre Mor. US international striker Terrence Boyd, on loan from Leipzig, gave Darmstadt an early lead, then Portugal midfielder Raphael Guerreiro levelled with a bullet shot for Dortmund just before the half-time break. But Darmstadt sealed the win when Antonio-Mirko Colak got in behind the defence and slotted his shot past Dortmund goalkeeper Roman Burki. Hertha Berlin stay sixth after going down 2-0 at Schalke, thanks to goals by striker Guido Burgstaller and midfielder Leon Goretzka for the Royal Blues."

Wolfsburg, who are struggling in the Bundesliga, upped the pace for the final ten minutes as Bayern lost their shape at the back. Attacking midfielder Yunus Malli, a new signing last month from Mainz, forced Neuer into spectacular parries in quick succession as Carlo Ancelotti's Bayern endured a tense final few minutes. ""We were trembling a bit at the end, but all in all it was a deserved win,"" Bayern's president Uli Hoeness told broadcaster ARD. Costa's goal was a boost for Bayern amidst reports the Selecao forward is considering leaving the German giants to further his career at the end of the season. And according to another report in magazine Sport Bild, Bayern captain Philipp Lahm has decided to retire in June despite having a year left on his contract. Elsewhere, Borussia Moenchengladbach won their third round match 2-0 at second-division Greuther Fuerth thanks to goals by Oscar Wendt and a penalty from Thorgan Hazard, brother of Chelsea star Eden. Gladbach's cause was helped when Fuerth's Hungary international midfielder Adam Pinter was sent off with just 19 minutes gone for a dangerous tackle on Germany midfielder Christoph Kramer. Hamburg, who are in the Bundesliga's relegation places, brushed off poor league form, winning 2-0 at home to Cologne with goals by Gideon Jung and US striker Bobby Wood. Second division Arminia Bielefeld are into the last eight after a scare against fourth division minnows Astoria Walldorf, progressing 5-4 on penalties after a 1-1 draw.

Wolfsburg, the 2015 German Cup winners, have won just five of their 18 league games this season and their latest display infuriated Gomez. ""We were sedate, arrogant and naive,"" fumed Gomez, who joined from Fiorentina at the start of the season. Having won their previous three league games, Wolfsburg thought they ""just had to wag their arses a bit to win a Bundesliga game,"" said Gomez. ""We played like a youth team and you don't win games like that."" After Gomez's header, his sixth league goal of the season, gave them a fourth-minute lead, Wolfsburg were punished for a lacklustre display. Cologne, who battered bottom side Darmstadt 6-1 on Saturday, are their next opponents. There were loud whistles from Wolfsburg's fans towards the end of the game and coach Valerien Ismael admitted: ""We feel like we beat ourselves."" ""As a team we need to understand what we can do and what our identity is,"" added Gomez. ""We had a super mentality in our last three games -- which we didn't have today."""

""I will be discovering a new country, a new championship and am very proud to embark on this new stage as part of a club that has become a reference in Europe and has recruited many very great players in recent years,"" Draxler said in a club statement. Draxler was unsettled at Wolfsburg and ruffled feathers last year when he announced publicly that he wanted to leave, prompting coach Valerien Ismael to say the player was causing 'confusion' in the team. Draxler is PSG's first purchase in the January transfer window as the club seeks to strengthen its squad after a disappointing start to the season and ahead of a their Champions League second round clash with Barcelona on February 14 and March 8. Draxler made his Bundesliga debut at 17 for Schalke 04 and went on to become the youngest ever goalscorer for the national side, against Kazakhstan in June 2013, and the youngest player to captain Germany the following year against Poland in a World Cup warmup game, aged 20. More recently his career has been dogged by controversy. He has upset fans, teammates and officials at Wolfburg, with his drive to quit the club lying 13th in the Bundesliga while critics say his performance on the field has fallen short of his stellar reputation. Last month former German international Lothar Matthaus chimed in with a warning to clubs interested in the precociously talent player that he had ""never proved at the highest level that he was capable of making the difference""."

However, the 2015 German Cup winners are now in danger of slipping into the bottom three and are only out of the relegation places on goal difference. Coach Valerien Ismael has taken just four points in his seven games since Hecking was fired in October and there is unrest behind the scenes with want-away Germany forward Julian Draxler out of the squad for the match in Munich.

72,10/12/2016,17:39,Bayern regain top spot as Leipzig lose unbeaten record,Robert Lewandowski netted twice as Bayern Munich returned to the top of the Bundesliga on Saturday with a 5-0 win over Wolfsburg after RB Leipzig lost their unbeaten record.,"Leipzig's shock 1-0 defeat at bottom side Ingolstadt, who finished with ten men, ended their three-week stint as leaders as Carlo Ancelotti's Bayern cut the three-point gap and regained top spot on goal difference with both teams on 33 points. Second-placed RB had their 13-match unbeaten run ended -- a record for a club at the start of their first Bundesliga season -- as coach Ralph Hasenhuettl endured a horror return to Ingolstadt, who he left after last season. Ingolstadt's Australia striker Mathew Leckie was sent off for two yellow cards in quick succession in the tense final stages. But his team held on for the win which took them off the bottom leaving Darmstadt, who lost 1-0 at Freiburg, now last. Bayern host Leipzig on December 21 at Munich's Allianz Arena, where the hosts romped to a heavy win over Wolfsburg. The 2015 German Cup winners have fallen from grace and defeat leaves Wolfsburg 15th, only clear of the relegation zone on goal difference. Head coach Valerien Ismael, who took over after Dieter Hecking was sacked in October, left Germany's attacking midfielder Julian Draxler out of the squad. The 23-year-old cost 35 million euros ($37.3m) from Schalke in August 2015 and Wolfsburg say they are open to sell him in January's winter break. Bayern started with Jerome Boateng on the bench with a shoulder injury and his centre-back partner Mats Hummels was missing with gastroenteritis. Arjen Robben opened the scoring by cutting in from the right and curling his superb shot around Wolfsburg's goalkeeper Diego Benaglio on 18 minutes. Lewandowski netted five goals in a record nine minutes in the same fixture in September 2015 and the Poland hot-shot needed just 21 minutes to also get on the scoresheet. To compound Wolfsburg's problems, defender Marcel Schaefer went off with a knee injury after 23 minutes as it finished 2-0 at the break. Lewandowski added his second on 58 minutes, Mueller grabbed his first league goal of the season by firing home Robben's pass on 76 minutes then Brazil winger Douglas Costa added Bayern's fifth just before the whistle. Fresh from their 2-2 Champions League draw at Real Madrid, Borussia Dortmund needed a 90th-minute Marco Reus goal to rescue their 1-1 draw at ten-man Cologne. Cologne took the lead when Germany defender Jonas Hector fired in a long-range free-kick and Artjoms Rudnevs slipped his marker, heading past Dortmund goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller on 28 minutes. But Reus rescued a point when he cooly slotted Adrian Ramos' cross for a point which kept Dortmund sixth as Cologne had Salih Ozcan sent off late on for a second yellow. Hamburg stay in the bottom three despite their 1-0 home win over Augsburg as both sides finished with ten men. The hosts took the lead when Nicolai Mueller hit the post and Serbia international Filip Kostic converted the rebound on 68 minutes. Hamburg had Lewis Holtby sent off just before the break for lashing out after Augsburg's midfielder Dominik Kohr's rough tackle. But Kohr was also shown a red when he earned his second yellow soon after. On Friday, Hoffenheim were held to a goalless draw at Eintracht Frankfurt but are now the only unbeaten team in Germany's top flight."
73,04/12/2016,19:34,Dropped Draxler repeats wish to quit Wolfsburg,Some of Europe's top clubs will again be monitoring Julian Draxler in January's transfer window after the Germany forward repeated his wish to quit Wolfsburg after being dropped for the first time.,"Juventus, Arsenal and Paris St-Germain have all previously been linked to the precocious attacking midfielder, who has made 27 appearances and scored three goals for Germany. The 23-year-old, who cost Wolfsburg 35 million euros ($37.3m) from Schalke in August 2015, was dropped for the first time for Saturday's 3-2 home defeat against Hertha Berlin after a series of lacklustre performances. Wolfsburg's coach Valerien Ismael, who replaced the sacked Dieter Hecking in October and has won just one of his six games in charge, took the decision to drop Draxler. When he came on for the last 12 minutes, Draxler was booed and whistled by Wolfsburg fans every time he received the ball at the Volkswagen Arena and the defeat left his club just above the relegation places. ""You can only imagine what these whistles do to a person,"" said Draxler. ""It's out of the question that someone wouldn't have problems to perform after that. ""The fans have the right to do it, but it's certainly not conducive. ""I already made my feelings clear in the summer and I stand by that."" In August, Draxler went public about his desire to leave Wolfsburg after the club's director of sport Klaus Allofs said he was going nowhere. ""I expressed myself clearly after the European championships to (then) coach Dieter Hecking that I want to leave VfL Wolfsburg,"" Draxler told German daily Bild at the time. The World Cup winner was signed to great fanfare after Wolfsburg sold Belgium playmaker Kevin de Bruyne to Manchester City, but Draxler has shone on only rare occasions for Wolfsburg. With no goals to his credit in any competition this season, Draxler has so far failed to gel with Germany striker Mario Gomez, who Wolfsburg signed from Fiorentina before the start of the season. Allofs said last month that Wolfsburg would be open to selling Draxler if they receive offers during January's winter break."
74,06/11/2016,14:22,Ismael seals Wolfsburg job as Ingolstadt fire Kauczinski,"VfL Wolfsburg made Valerien Ismael head coach, on Sunday following a spell as caretaker while conversely Bundesliga strugglers Ingolstadt sacked Markus Kauczinski after just four months in the hot-seat.","Saturday's 3-0 win over Freiburg was the result Wolfsburg needed to make Ismael's job permanent, despite two defeats in three games since Dieter Hecking was fired. The French ex-Bayern Munich and Hanover 96 defender has a contract until June 2018. ""The thorough examination of all alternatives has shown that this is the best solution for us,"" said director of sport Klaus Allofs. Ex-Chelsea and Tottenham Hotspur coach Andre Villas-Boas, now at Shanghai SIPG, and ex-Hamburg boss Bruno Labbadia had been both linked to the job. Wolfsburg's win, their first league victory since the opening day of the season, catapulted them from the relegation places to 13th, but they remain just two points from the bottom three, where Ingolstadt lurk in 17th. The Bavarian club are winless in Germany's top flight this season and have just two points with eight defeats and two draws from ten league games. Just four months after taking charge, Kauczinski was sacked less than 24 hours after their 2-0 defeat at home to Augsburg on Saturday left them just one place from bottom. ""We have analysed the work of the past four months with Markus and decided that the best thing for Ingolstadt is to make a new start,"" confirmed Harald Gaertner, the club's director of sport and communication. Ingolstadt's bosses hope to have a new coach in place after training on Tuesday, but if there is no appointment, a caretaker coach will be named. Kauczinski, who had previously spent 15 years at second-division Karlsruhe, was only appointed in July after predecessor Ralph Hasenhuettl left to coach RB Leipzig."
75,18/10/2016,21:19,Wolfsburg take a chance on Ismael,Bundesliga side Wolfsburg on Tuesday unveiled inexperienced ex-Bayern Munich defender Valerien Ismael as head coach -- with a view to making the job permanent if results in Germany's top flight pick up.,"The 41-year-old Frenchman has been promoted from being coach of the Under-23 team to Wolfsburg's senior side. He replaces Dieter Hecking, who was sacked on Monday with the team winless in their last six games and sitting 14th in the Bundesliga. ""He is now the head coach,"" confirmed Wolfsburg's sporting director Klaus Allofs, who insisted Ismael was ""not an emergency solution"". ""Now he has the chance to prove that to Wolfsburg."" The main task of the former Lens, Werder Bremen, Bayern and Hanover 96 defender is to coax some form out of the likes of Julian Draxler and Mario Gomez. Wolfsburg have scored a paltry four goals in seven league games. Gomez was announced as Wolfsburg's star signing before the season started, but the Germany striker has yet to hit the net. ""All my energy will go into the success of the club,"" said Ismael. ""It's not about me, but the club."" His first task is get a win on Saturday at strugglers Darmstadt, who are just a place below them in 15th, to give ambitious Wolfsburg their first Bundesliga win since the end of August. Allofs said results in the coming weeks -- and discussions with other potential candidates -- will show whether Ismael is finally given the job on a permanent basis. His only previous experience as head coach was a six-month stint at Nuremberg in 2014 when he was sacked after seven defeats in 14 games. Following that brief stint, his only other experience was in charge of Wolfsburg's junior team. ""The next few weeks will show which alternatives there are,"" said Allofs. Other potential candidates are ex-Tottenham Hotspur and Chelsea coach Andre Villas-Boas and ex-Schalke boss Andre Breitenreiter."
76,17/10/2016,18:08,Wolfsburg sack Hecking,VfL Wolfsburg on Monday reportedly sacked coach Dieter Hecking after their latest defeat left the ambitious Bundesliga club winless in their last six league games.,"According to both German daily Bild and broadcaster Sport1, ex-French defender Valerien Ismael, 41, has already been promoted from the Under-23 team to be caretaker coach for Saturday's Bundesliga match at Darmstadt. Ex-Chelsea and Tottenham coach Andre Villas-Boas and former Schalke boss Andre Breitenreiter have both been linked to the post. The 52-year-old Hecking steered Wolfsburg to the German Cup title in 2015, the year they were runners up in the Bundesliga. They also reached the knock-out stages of the Champions League last season for the first time in the club's history. But Sunday's 1-0 defeat at home to newly-promoted RB Leipzig, which left the team 14th in the table, was the final straw for Wolfsburg's bosses. Hecking was sacked after three and a half years in charge, with the team just three points from the relegation places and Wolfsburg have taken just 25 points in their 24 league games in 2016. ""As the head coach, you are always responsible -- for anything that happens,"" said Hecking after Sunday's defeat. ""If you don't win any games, then you have no argument."" Hecking is the third coach to be sacked in Germany's top flight this season. Werder Bremen dismissed Viktor Skripnik on September 18 and Hamburg fired Bruno Labbadia a week later after poor results left their respective teams in the relegation places."
77,16/10/2016,20:13,Unbeaten Leipzig down Wolves to go third,Controversial new-boys RB Leipzig are up to third in the Bundesliga after claiming another big-name scalp in Germany's top flight with a 1-0 win at VfL Wolfsburg on Sunday.,"Sweden international midfielder Emil Forsberg's winner gave unbeaten RB their fourth win in seven games as Wolfsburg joined Borussia Dortmund, Hamburg and Augsburg, in losing to Leipzig. The result, a third defeat in seven games with three draws and just one win, is a disaster for Wolfsburg, who reached the Champions League's knock-out stages last season. They are now fourteenth, just two points from the relegation places. High-profile summer signing and Germany striker Mario Gomez is yet to score for his new club and the latest defeat could spell trouble for coach Dieter Hecking. ""We have to have discussions and see how we react,"" said Wolfsburg's director of sport Klaus Allofs. ""We have to see that we come out of this as a club. ""That could be with, or without, the coach."" Sponsored by Austrian energy drinks giant Red Bull, RB Leipzig are unpopular with fans of traditional clubs, who fear the rise of corporate-backed entities in Germany's top flight. RB were only founded in 2009, but have risen through the ranks with four promotions in seven years to reach the Bundesliga. Their young squad, which has no big-name stars, are winning over neutral fans by playing eye-catching football, including Forsberg's superbly struck shot which curled in from outside the box on 70 minutes. Alongside leaders Bayern Munich, second-placed Cologne and sixth-placed Hoffenheim, Leipzig are one of the few unbeaten teams in the German league. Earlier, Mainz moved up to seventh with a 2-1 win at home to local rivals Darmstadt. Just 48 kilometres (30 miles) separates the two clubs and while Mainz are knocking on the door of the top six, the result left Darmstadt 15th in the table, just above the relegation places. Argentinian striker Pablo De Blasis gave Mainz the lead at the Opel Arena with a brilliant flick after just five minutes to claim his fourth goal in seven league games this season. Darmstadt were awarded a penalty just before the break when Mainz captain Stefan Ball fouled striker Antonio-Mirko Colak, but the Croatian forward had his spot-kick saved by Danish goalkeeper Jonas Loessl. It was a busy first-half as both sides hit the crossbar. Mainz doubled their lead when Turkey international Yunus Malli was brought down by Darmstadt captain Aytac Sulu, but got up to bang home the spot kick on 57 minutes. Darmstadt scored a late consolation when Mainz substitute Niko Bungert, who came on in the 90th minute, gave away a penalty for handball which midfielder Jerome Gondorf gratefully converted in injury time. Bayern remain two points clear at the top of the Bundesliga despite their 2-2 draw at Eintracht Frankfurt on Saturday, which left the defending champions winless in their last three matches."
78,20/09/2016,22:26,Dortmund rout Wolfsburg to go top in Germany,Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang struck twice on Tuesday as Borussia Dortmund romped to another big win with a 5-1 victory at VfL Wolfsburg to temporarily top the German league table.,"Having hammered both Legia Warsaw and Darmstadt 6-0 in their previous matches, Thomas Tuchel's Dortmund handed out another drubbing with Gonzalo Castro setting up two of their goals. The thrashing leaves Dortmund top on goals scored, with nine points from a possible 12, a status they will lose on Wednesday when Bayern Munich host Hertha Berlin. The only teams still with 100 percent records meet at Munich's Allianz Arena with Hertha chasing their first league win in Bavaria since 1977. It was another bad night for Wolfsburg, who have won only once in four games so far, and new signing Mario Gomez. The Germany striker has yet to score since joining from Fiorentina and was repeatedly denied by Dortmund goalkeeper Roman Burki. Dortmund needed just four minutes to take the lead at the Volkswagen Arena when centre-back Marc Bartra threaded his pass through the Wolfsburg defence. Portugal midfielder Raphael Guerreiro sprinted onto the perfect pass and drilled his shot inside the near post. Dortmund doubled their lead on 17 minutes when Aubameyang looped his shot over Wolfsburg goalkeeper Koen Casteels. But Wolfsburg dragged their way back into the match. Burki blocked left-back Ricardo Rodriguez's powerfully struck free-kick with half-time approaching and then Wolfsburg deservedly pulled a goal back just after the break. Moments after Gomez was again denied by Burki's point-blank save, Daniel Didavi met Paul Seguin's superb cross and drilled his shot just inside the near post on 53 minutes. But Dortmund hit their third five minutes later when Castro pulled two defenders out of position to allow winger Ousmane Dembele a simple tap-in. Castro then sprinted into the area and squared to Aubameyang, who slid his shot inside the far post on 62 minutes, before Lukasz Piszczek added Dortmund's fifth with a powerful header. Eintracht Frankfurt moved up to fourth with their third win from four games as defender David Abraham and Bastian Oczipka netted in their 2-0 victory at Ingolstadt. Newly promoted Freiburg inflicted a third straight defeat on Hamburg, who are third from bottom, as ex-Bayern Munich striker Nils Petersen scored the second-half winner. Hoffenheim picked up a fourth draw after their 1-1 with Darmstadt when Croatia striker Andrej Kramaric's goal was cancelled out by Darmstadt's Denys Oliinyk in the 92nd minute. On Wednesday, unbeaten RB Leipzig host Champions League side Borussia Moenchengladbach. Schalke 04 are desperate for points at home to Cologne after three straight defeats to leave them second from bottom. Bottom side Werder Bremen host Mainz having sacked coach Viktor Skripnik on Sunday after three straight defeats."
79,19/09/2016,18:07,Dortmund juggernaut to tackle goal-shy Wolfsburg,Free-scoring Borussia Dortmund head to Wolfsburg for Tuesday's Bundesliga clash looking to continue an impressive scoring streak that has seen them bag 12 goals in two matches.,"In contrast, Germany striker Mario Gomez is desperate to break his Wolves' duck after failing to score in his first two appearances for the club. Wolfsburg host Dortmund at the Volkswagen Arena having finished goalless in their last two games, a problem Borussia do not have after demolishing Legia Warsaw and Darmstadt by the same 6-0 scoreline in their last two matches. Gomez, who netted two goals for Germany in June's European championships, will be looking to take a leaf out of Dortmund's book having failed to score in his two league appearances since joining Wolfsburg for seven million euros ($7.8m) from Fiorentina in August to great fanfare. The 31-year-old missed a handful of chances in Saturday's goalless draw at Hoffenheim, leaving his new team on five points from a possible nine this season. ""I'm sorry for the team that I haven't scored,"" said Gomez, the Turkish league's top-scorer last season with 26 goals on loan at Besiktas. ""It was one of those days when the (Hoffenheim) goalkeeper saved everything. ""It's clear that I have to score at least once, but the goals will come and the next game is a good chance for that. Borussia Dortmund haven't won the game yet."" Both teams are in the top half of the table with Dortmund a point above Wolves on six points. Last time out, Dortmund blitzed Darmstadt despite leaving stars Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Mario Goetze out of their starting line-up. And head coach Thomas Tuchel has a selection headache with half a dozen highly-talented youngsters all vying for starting places against Wolfsburg. Amongst them is USA international Christian Pulisic, who scored against Darmstadt, only turned 18 on Sunday after making his Champions League debut in Warsaw. ""You can finally drive a car in Germany!"", said USA coach Jurgen Klinsmann in a video message to the attacking midfielder. ""We proud of you in the USA -- shoot a few more goals!"" Pulisic is typical of the talent Tuchel is nurturing. Both French rising star Ousmane Dembele, 18, and Portugal international Raphael Guerreiro, 22, are impressing on the left flank. Turkey international Emre Mor, 19, scored his first Bundesliga goal against Darmstadt. Right-back Felix Passlack only turned 18 in May and defensive midfielder Julian Weigl is a full Germany international -- at just 21. Tuchel, who has seen 10 different players score in their last two matches, may need his talented squad as Borussia have a busy week coming up with three games in seven days, including Friday's visit of Freiburg before hosting Real Madrid in the Champions League group stages Tuesday next week. But a strong bench and more rotation does not necessarily mean more league points, according to Tuchel. ""That would be too simple a calculation,"" he said. ""We shouldn't hanker after the 78 points we achieved (in the German league) last season."""
80,27/08/2016,20:14,Wolfsburg's Dost eyes Sporting Lisbon move,"Dutch striker Bas Dost said Saturday he hopes to transfer from VfL Wolfsburg to Sporting Lisbon imminently, with his Wolves place under threat following the arrival of Germany's Mario Gomez.","The transfer window closed at midnight on Wednesday (2200 GMT), but Dost hopes to be plying his trade in the Portuguese league soon, with the deal set to cost up to ten million euros ($11m). ""I am assuming that it will come off,"" said Dost after helping set up the opening goal in Saturday's 2-0 win at Augsburg with Gomez still sidelined and recovering from a hamstring injury he picked up at the European championships. Wolfsburg's recent signing of Gomez, the Bundesliga's top scorer over the last decade with 132 goals in 197 appearances for either Stuttgart or Bayern Munich since the 2006/07 season, has left Dost looking for another club. Gomez scored 26 goals last season on loan from Fiorentina at Besiktas, to finish as the Turkish league's top-scorer, and netted twice for Germany at Euro 2016. ""Of course, it (Gomez's arrival) has played a role, he will be the first choice striker,"" admitted Dost, who has scored 36 goals in 85 games in Germany's top flight since joining Wolfsburg in 2012. Dost's best season in Germany was in 2014/15 when he scored 16 goals in 21 league games to help Wolfsburg finish second only to Bayern in the Bundesliga and they won the German Cup. Wolfsburg's director of sport Klaus Allofs said talks with Sporting are ongoing, ""they could come to something, but we will make a decision in peace in the next few days."""
81,24/08/2016,03:27,Five major transfers to Germany for 2016-17,"Ahead of the start of the 2016-17 Bundesliga season on Friday, AFP Sports takes a look at the five biggest incoming transfers of the close season in Germany:","Barcelona (ESP) to Hamburg, five million euros ($5.6m) Halilovic was 16 when he made his professional debut for Dinamo Zagreb and having been billed as Croatia's 'next big thing', he was snapped up by Barcelona in May 2014. The attacking midfielder scored four goals in 29 matches for Barcelona B over the course of the 2014-15 campaign, but made just one Copa del Rey appearance for the first team. On loan at Sporting Gijon, his injection of class meant he made 36 appearances in 2015-16, netting three goals and five assists to earn the the nickname 'Guajlilovic', a play on 'El Guaje' (the Kid). The 20-year-old missed out on a place in Croatia's Euro 2016 squad, but scored his first goal for Hamburg in their 1-0 win at Zwickau on Monday in the German Cup -- eight minutes after coming off the bench. ""That I scored with my first chance is really great. I hope that more goals will follow,"" he said after his debut in the Cup's first round. Rennes (FRA) to Borussia Dortmund, a reported 15 million euros The 18-year-old winger joined Rennes as a 13-year-old in 2010 and only made his French league debut last November, but is already one of France's brightest talents. He has said his dream is to play for Barcelona and last season he scored 12 goals in 26 French league games, including a hat-trick in the derby against Nantes last March. Dembele was named France's Young Player of the Year for 2015-16 and can play on either wing. He announced himself for Dortmund with a stunning goal in a 4-1 win against Manchester United on their tour of China last month. ""Dembele uses both his feet and has great dribbling skills. He can do anything,"" said Dortmund coach Thomas Tuchel. Benfica (POR) to Bayern Munich, 35 million euros The 19-year-old defensive midfielder is already a European champion having helped Portugal win the Euro 2016 title. Despite standing a modest 1.76m, he has plenty of pace and power and has completed a meteoric rise in the past 12 months. He netted his first goal for Benfica last December, then made his Portugal debut in a 2-1 defeat to Bulgaria in March. At 18 years and 328 days, he broke Cristiano Ronaldo's record as the youngest player to appear in a European Championship final and picked up the award for the Young Player of the tournament. Having signed for Bayern in May, his future employers were pleased to have tied him down to a five-year deal before his breakthrough in France. ""He has extraordinary talents. Bayern would not have been able to afford him had we tried to sign him after the Euros,"" said Bayern chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge. Fiorentina (ITA) to VfL Wolfsburg, reportedly seven million euros After three years spent abroad, the Bundesliga's most prolific striker in the last ten years is back in Germany. Since the 2006-07 season, Gomez has scored 132 goals in 197 German league games making him the Bundesliga's top scorer over the last decade. Gomez has adapted his game and proved he can create chances as well as finish them when his crisp cross led to Mesut Ozil's goal in the quarter-finals of Euro 2016. He won the 2007 Bundesliga title with Stuttgart before signing for Bayern Munich for a then-record 30 million euros in 2009 and was the league's top scorer with 28 goals in 2010-11. He lost his place in the 2012-13 season, when Bayern won the treble, and a move to Fiorentina backfired, as he scored just seven times in two seasons in Italy and was left out of Germany's triumphant 2014 World Cup squad. But a reinvigorating loan spell at Besiktas saw him finish as the Turkish league's top scorer last season with 26 goals in 33 appearances. His aim for the 2016-17 season is to get Wolfsburg back in the Champions League. ""The team and I both share the same hunger to be successful,"" he said. Barcelona (ESP) to Borussia Dortmund for eight million euros Bartra made his Barcelona debut under Pep Guardiola in February 2010 and has won the Champions League twice, the Spanish league title five times and the Club World Cup. But having made just 59 appearances in seven seasons at Barcelona, his best spell the 2013-14 campaign when he played 20 times in Spain's top flight, he found himself relegated to third or fourth-choice centre-back under Luis Enrique. His quest for regular first-team football has brought him to Germany and with Carles Puyol as his agent, he has a Spanish legend in his corner. Bartra has plenty of pace and is known for his smooth passing. He is good in the air and can also play at right-back, providing Thomas Tuchel with plenty of options."
82,22/08/2016,23:19,Brazilian Dante reunites with Favre at Nice,"Brazilian centre-back Dante will reunite with former coach Lucien Favre at Nice in Ligue 1 after completing his move from Wolfsburg, the two clubs announced on Monday.","The 32-year-old returns to France a decade after spending two years at Lille early in his career and will rejoin Favre, whom he played under at Borussia Moenchengladbach while in Germany. Dante won the Champions League with Bayern Munich in 2013 and was part of three Bundesliga title-winning sides during his time in Bavaria. He also helped Wolfsburg make a surprise run to the quarter-finals of Europe's premier club competition last season and has been capped 13 times at international level. Wolfsburg have already sold Germany internationals Andre Schuerrle and Max Kruse this summer, although the Wolves were able to recruit striker Mario Gomez from Fiorentina."
83,18/08/2016,14:31,Gomez targets Champions League return with Wolfsburg,Mario Gomez said Thursday that his priorities at new club Wolfsburg are to get them back in the Champions League and make sure his want-away Germany team-mate Julian Draxler stays.,"The 31-year-old Gomez is enjoying an Indian summer of his career, having been top scorer in the Turkish league last season with 26 goals while on loan at Besiktas. Gomez has signed for Wolfsburg from Fiorentina and held his first press conference on his return to the Bundesliga after a three-year sojourn in Italy and Turkey. The ex-Bayern Munich and Stuttgart striker admits the fact Wolfsburg will play in neither the Champions League nor the Europa League this season had been a factor. But Wolfsburg reached the Champions League quarter-finals last season, losing to eventual winners Real Madrid, and Gomez says the team has the potential to return to the international stage. ""I wanted to join a team which plays in the Champions League,"" said Gomez, who has signed a three-year contract and reportedly cost seven million euros ($7.8m). ""I had conversations with other teams, but they already had top strikers or they wouldn't have made it out of the Champions League's group stages, which didn't make much sense. ""I considered which team had the most potential to play in the Champions League. ""I wanted to return to the Bundesliga and had a good feeling here after a few conversations. ""It's bitter that Wolfsburg aren't in Europe, but we have the hunger to get back there quickly."" Gomez's signing boosts a squad which was weakened by the off-season departures of Germany forwards Andre Schuerrle and Max Kruse, plus Brazilian defender Naldo. Attacking midfielder Draxler had made it clear he also wanted to leave and Gomez joked that his job is to score the goals to keep his Germany team-mate happy. ""I'd like to think that one of the best German players will keep a smile on his face,"" said Gomez with a grin. Gomez netted twice for Germany in their run to the Euro 2016 semi-finals, but missed the 2-0 defeat to France with a hamstring injury. Wolfsburg start their new Bundesliga season at Augsburg on August 27, but Gomez is expected to make his debut at home against Cologne on September 10 as he works on his fitness after injury. Having been the Bundesliga's top scorer in 2011 with 28 goals before his departure from Bayern, Gomez will rival Dutch striker Bas Dost for a starting berth. Gomez cost Bayern a then Bundesliga record 30 million euros when they signed him from Stuttgart in 2009 and he has made 236 appearances, scoring 138 goals, in Germany's top flight. But he returns to Germany having adapted his game to be more than just a threat in the penalty area, as he demonstrated at the European championships. The burly forward has added an element of play-making, which he showed in Germany's quarter-final win over Italy at Euro 2016 when he created Mesut Ozil's goal in a 1-1 draw before the Germans won a penalty shoot-out. ""I believe that I am an absolute team player,"" said Gomez, who has scored 29 goals in 68 appearances for Germany. ""Perhaps, at the start I used to broadcast in the national team the fact that I always wanted to be the one who scored goals. ""But at the Euro, I showed that it's about the bigger picture and I try to be a team player in the national team."""
84,17/08/2016,20:25,Germany's Gomez signs for Wolfsburg,"Germany forward Mario Gomez will return to the Bundesliga with the ex-Besiktas and Fiorentina striker joining VfL Wolfsburg, the club said on Wednesday.","Wolfsburg confirmed earlier reports from German daily Bild and magazine Kicker as well as agencies DPA and SID, an AFP subsidiary, that claimed the club was set to complete Gomez's signing from Fiorentina. The 31-year-old, who spent last season on loan at Besiktas where he was the Turkish league's top scorer with 26 goals, is reportedly set to cost Wolfsburg seven million euros ($7.8m). He will be officially presented as a Wolfsburg player on Thursday, having reportedly agreed a three-year deal, and will wear the number 33 jersey. Gomez netted twice in Germany's run to the semi-finals of Euro 2016, but a thigh injury suffered in the quarter-final win over Italy ended his tournament. Scorer of 29 goals in 68 appearances for Germany, Gomez decided not to stay in Turkey given the political unrest in the country. Gomez cost Bayern Munich a then Bundesliga record 30 million euros when they signed him from Stuttgart in 2009 and he has made 236 appearances, scoring 138 goals, in Germany's top flight. He was the Bundesliga's top scorer in 2011 with 28 goals for Bayern. But the Munich giants sold him to Fiorentina for 15.5 million euros after winning the 2013 treble of Champions League, Bundesliga and German Cup. Wolfsburg start their Bundesliga campaign at Augsburg on August 27."
85,04/08/2016,17:18,Wolfsburg insist want-away Draxler is staying,"VfL Wolfsburg has said their winger Julian Draxler will not be sold in the current transfer window, despite the Germany international having told club bosses he wants to leave.","""VfL Wolfsburg will not transfer Julian Draxler in this current window,"" said the Bundesliga club in a statement. ""In a meeting, Wolfsburg has again explained to Julian Draxler that they will be not able to meet his transfer request."" The 22-year-old joined Wolfsburg to much fanfare last August for 35 million euros ($39m) from Schalke. But just 12 months later, and with four years still left on his contract, Draxler made it clear in an interview with German daily Bild this week that he wants out. He has been linked to both Arsenal and Juventus, but will not be granted a transfer before the current window closes on August 31. In the Bild interview, Draxler also slammed coach Dieter Hecking and director of sport Klaus Allofs for not having spoken to him before initially telling the media he will stay. But after clear-the-air talks on Wednesday, Hecking says he expects Draxler to knuckle down before Wolfsburg start the German League season at Augsburg on August 27. ""We had a sensible and constructive conversation -- also from Julian's side,"" Hecking told Sky. ""I have to say that he was very professional throughout the talks and we expect him to remain just as professional."" Having reached the quarter-finals last season on their Champions League debut, Wolfsburg have not even qualified for the Europa League this year. With their Brazil defender Naldo having joined Schalke, Germany winger Andre Schuerrle switching to Borussia Dortmund and striker Max Kruse signing for Werder Bremen, Wolfsburg could ill afford to let another big name go. But how much Draxler will feature at the start of the season is down to his attitude now. ""It will depend how quickly Julian's thoughts return to VfL again,"" added Hecking. ""I hope he will put in some performances, because he is definitely an important stabilising factor for us."""

There is no prognosis of when the defensive midfielder will be able to play again, ahead of Wolfsburg's first league game of the season at Augsburg on August 27.

""He has already amassed considerable international experience. His quality will be of great value for our team,"" said Dortmund's sporting director Michael Zorc. Schurrle, 25, has played 55 times for his country and becomes Dortmund's second major signing in as many days after Mario Goetze returned to his former club on Thursday following a frustrating three-year spell at Bayern Munich. Schurrle, who has scored 48 goals in 174 Bundesliga games, spent the past 18 months at Wolfsburg after he joined them from Chelsea in February 2014 for 32 million euros. He is Dortmund's eighth signing this close season as Thomas Tuchel looks to reinforce his side following the departures of Henrikh Mkhitaryan, Ilkay Gundogan and Mats Hummels."

Just before kick-off, one of the flares hit the roof of the Hanover bench and exploded, forcing the home substitutes to scatter. The DFB say 40,000 euros of the total fine must be used by Wolfsburg to improve the club's security arrangements, infrastructure and anti-violence measures. The German FA has also threatened to ban home supporters from parts of Wolfsburg's ground for home matches should there be any repeat and the club are on probation until June 2017. The club have accepted the fine and said they will not appeal. ""Such a high penalty has never been previously imposed on Wolfsburg,"" said one of the club's directors, Thomas Roettgermann. ""We were able to demonstrate conclusively to the DFB that there had not been such a blatant misconduct of our fans to date and there shouldn't be in the future."" The March incident was not the first time the use of pyrotechnics marred a Bundesliga match between the north German neighbours. In December 2014, Wolfsburg fans fired four flares and set off a smoke bomb in the away section of Hanover's stadium and both clubs were fined 6,000 euros at the time.

Despite a run to the quarter-finals of the Champions League, including a 2-0 shock home win over Real Madrid before losing 3-0 away in the last eight, Wolfsburg have won just three of their last 18 league games. They finished second only to Bayern Munich last season in the German league and lifted the German Cup with a convincing 3-1 win over Dortmund in Jurgen Klopp's last game as Borussia's head coach. But Saturday's crushing defeat at Dortmund left them 10th in the table, ending any hopes of qualifying even for next season's Europa League. The slump has left Allofs fuming. ""Am I stupid or what?"" he angrily asked reporters after the umpteenth enquiry whether Hecking will be replaced after their fourth straight defeat. ""The squad isn't perhaps as good as it's seen from outside. It's mediocre, if not less. ""We'll have to see if we can change things for the last two games and, of course, definitely before next season. ""Last year, we were the second best in Germany. This (recent results) is all nonsense. ""You can't just put in a good year, you need two, three or four. ""The signs are that one or two players will leave for various reasons. ""We can't change anything, the players have contracts, but I think it would make sense to bring in new players and let others follow a different path. ""I think that would be best for a few individuals and us (the club)."" There are several candidates. Swiss left back, and dead ball specialist, Ricardo Rodriguez has been courted by Real and Manchester United. World Cup winner Andre Schuerrle has failed to win a regular starting place since signing from Chelsea and Tottenham Hotspur are reportedly interested. Striker Max Kruse was disciplined by Wolfsburg, and kicked out of the Germany squad in March, for off-field indiscretions including leaving behind 75,000 euros (US$85,852) in a Berlin taxi. Brazil defender Dante spent the whole 90 minutes of the Dortmund match on the bench."
94,25/04/2016,15:34,Wolfsburg part ways with Bendtner,Denmark striker Nicklas Bendtner is without a club after VfL Wolfsburg announced on Monday they have cancelled his contract with a year still left to run.,"The 28-year-old joined Wolfsburg on a free transfer from Arsenal in 2014 on a three-year deal. But he has scored just nine goals in 47 games and his relationship with Wolfsburg coach Dieter Hecking has deteriorated over the course of the season. ""When he first arrived, both Nicklas and us here had promised a lot of commitment at VfL Wolfsburg,"" said Wolfsburg sporting director Klaus Allofs. ""After two years, we unfortunately have to see that these expectations have been met neither by him nor by us, and to continue working together would have made no sense for anyone. ""Therefore, the decision to end this deal is the best solution for everyone."" According to reports, all that is left to sort out is the amount of compensation Bendtner will be paid, which looks to be up to two million euros ($2.25m, £1.55m). The Danish international has been excluded from first-team training for the last four weeks and his last goal in the Bundesliga was back in October in a 2-1 win over Bayer Leverkusen. He was left out of Wolfsburg's run to the quarter-finals of the Champions League. Bendtner was on the bench for their group stage win over Manchester United in December, but left out of the match squad entirely for both legs of their quarter-final defeat against Real Madrid. He was fined by Volkswagen-sponsored Wolfsburg in February after breaking club rules by posting a picture of him climbing into a luxury Mercedes. Bendtner turned down an offer in January to play in China and his future is now open. ""We wish Nicklas good luck in his further career,"" added Allofs."
95,12/04/2016,22:45,Ronaldo hat-trick fires Real Madrid into semis,Cristiano Ronaldo inspired Real Madrid to a record sixth successive Champions League semi-final with a hat-trick as the Spanish giants overturned a 2-0 first leg deficit to beat Wolfsburg 3-0 on Tuesday.,"Ronaldo struck twice in just over a minute to bring Madrid level in the tie inside 17 minutes. Yet, the 10-time winners were forced to wait until 13 minutes from time to find the winner when Ronaldo's dipping free-kick escaped the clutches of Diego Benaglio to find the bottom corner. Madrid hadn't overturned a first leg deficit in the Champions League in eight attempts stretching back 14 years to when coach Zinedine Zidane played for Los Blancos in a quarter-final win over Bayern Munich. However, they roared back into the tie and were level as Ronaldo struck twice in 86 seconds. Dani Carvajal replaced the much-criticised Danilo in Madrid's only change from the first leg at right-back and the Spanish international's deflected cross fell perfectly for Ronaldo to tap home the opener at the back post. The two nearly combined for the second straight from the restart as another dangerous Carvajal effort was just cut out before Ronaldo could head home. However, there was no stopping the three-time World Player of the Year from the resulting corner as his downward header found the bottom corner for his 15th Champions League goal of the season. Wolfsburg's disastrous start was compounded when star midfielder Julian Draxler limped off injured to be replaced by Max Kruse just after the half hour mark. Yet, the Germans still managed to grow into the game as the opening 45 minutes wore on. Luis Gustavo's fierce long-range effort forced Keylor Navas into a decent save before Bruno Henrique squandered a huge chance to net the vital away goal as he hesitated in getting his shot off and Marcelo got back to block the ball behind. Madrid started on the front foot again at the start of the second-half as Ronaldo saw a free-kick deflected wide before Benaglio was forced into a save to prevent Joshua Guilavogui turning a cross into his own net. The hosts were convinced they had gone ahead for the first time in the tie when Sergio Ramos's header came off the inside of the post and rolled along the goal line, but Hungarian referee Viktor Kassai adjudged the ball hadn't crossed the line. Wolfsburg continued to pose the threat of an away goal as Vieirinha fired wide before Dante's downward header was held by Navas. However, Ronaldo finally struck the decisive blow when his free-kick from 25 yards skidded off the wet turf and beyond the despairing dive of Benaglio to seal his 37th hat-trick for Madrid. The Swiss 'keeper then kept Wolfsburg in the tie with brilliant saves from Karim Benzema and Jese Rodriguez to set up a grandstand finish. But Madrid's experience told in the dying stages as they comfortable saw the game out to match Barcelona's record run of six semi-finals between 2008 and 2013."
96,11/04/2016,15:10,'Positive' Zidane seeks patience in Madrid recovery mission,Real Madrid coach Zinedine Zidane insisted he remains positive his side will overcome a 2-0 first-leg deficit to reach the Champions League semi-finals against Wolfsburg on Tuesday.,"Madrid need to end a run of bowing out in the Champions League the last eight times they have lost the first leg, but Zidane also stressed the need for patience as an away goal for the Germans would leave Real needing four to go through. ""I am always positive and I achieved something as a player with this philosophy,"" said Zidane, who scored the winner for Real in the 2002 Champions League final. ""What most concerns me is to see the faces of my players and they are very focused on the game, so that eases the pressure. ""We need to score, but we have 90 minutes or more to do so."" Madrid's fortunes have turned around dramatically in La Liga in recent weeks as they came from behind to end Barcelona's 39-game unbeaten run earlier this month before closing to within four points of the leaders with six games to go after Barca lost again at Real Sociedad on Saturday. And Zidane is hopeful the momentum of their league form will carry into a famous night at the Santiago Bernabeu, where Madrid have scored 37 goals in nine games since he took charge in January. ""The message is patience because we know anything can happen in football,"" he added. ""As we've seen in La Liga -- with Barcelona's goal we were 13 points behind and now we are four. That is the great thing about football. ""We have to keep our heads, we are not going to win (the tie) in 10 or 15 minutes. ""It will be much more difficult if they score a goal. Anything can happen, but we need to be concentrated from the first minute."" Madrid will be at full strength as Karim Benzema has recovered from a knee knock that forced him off in the first leg. Captain Sergio Ramos returns from suspension, whilst the likes of Gareth Bale, Toni Kroos and Luka Modric were rested for Saturday's 4-0 thrashing of Eibar. ""We have a great team full of talent and I think that the whole side is capable of coming back tomorrow with the help from our fans,"" said Modric. Wolfsburg weren't so successful at the weekend as a 1-1 draw at home to Mainz all but ended their hopes of qualifying for next season's Champions League through the Bundesliga. Coach Dieter Hecking admitted any chance the Germans were underestimated by Madrid in the first leg will certainly not be repeated in the Spanish capital. ""If it was the case that Real had underestimated us in the first leg, they definitely won't do that again,"" he said. However, German international Andre Schuerrle claimed his side were ""one million percent ready"" to continue their historic European run and the former Chelsea forward is hopeful of killing the tie off with an away goal. ""We have already shown that we have the quality up front and if we get a goal, that will make it all a lot easier."""

""We did a good job of selling ourselves well in the first leg, but we are going to have to give everything we have in order to pull off a huge sensation."" Real have a huge job on their hands at the Santiago Bernabeu if they are to go through to a sixth consecutive Champions League semi-final after succumbing to a Ricardo Rodriguez penalty and a Maximilian Arnold goal. Wolfsburg suffered something of a Champions League hangover on Saturday as they were held to a 1-1 draw in the Bundesliga at home to Mainz, although Hecking rested four of the side which beat Real. However, last season's German Cup winners, who are in the Champions League knockout stages for the first time, have tended to struggle immediately after European games this season, picking up just 10 league points from a possible 27. Germany forward Andre Schuerrle says the team is ""one million percent ready"" for Tuesday's return leg although he expects Wolfsburg will have to run themselves into the ground to reach the semi-finals. ""It's going to be an intensive game,"" said Schuerrle. ""We'll have to play like we did in the first leg or maybe even better. ""We'll need to be mentally switched on from the very first minute. ""We have already shown that we have the quality up front and if we get a goal, that will make it all a lot easier."""

However, the Frenchman sounded confident of turning things around with the backing of the home support at the Santiago Bernabeu to reach the semi-finals for the sixth year running. ""I think the supporters will be behind us. On Tuesday we're playing for our season but we clearly know that. It's a huge game and the fans like that too. ""I like it when things become difficult and I think the fans do as well,"" said Zidane, adding he wasn't worried about his future should Real bow out of Europe next week. ""My job is at stake all the time. When I put myself in this situation, I knew the rules. If I'd had a problem with it, I wouldn't have put myself in it. ""I'm at peace with that. What keeps me going is what I do daily, how I can do things to improve, for the team to improve. ""As for the rest, I know that if I lose two matches, one competition, I know that I can be on my way, that they can replace me, that's just part of things. ""But I'm not in that position, I'm right in the middle of the season and very busy with my goals."" Conquering Europe represents Real's only remaining hope of a major trophy this season after they were disqualified from the Copa del Rey for fielding an ineligible player. They also trail La Liga leaders Barcelona by seven points despite a 2-1 victory in El Clasico last weekend. Real will be without Karim Benzema and Raphael Varane for Saturday's league game at home to Eibar, but Zidane said the pair should be fit for Tuesday's return leg against Wolfsburg. France striker Benzema hurt his knee during the defeat in Germany, while Varane injured his calf while on international duty with the Euro 2016 hosts. ""Karim can still feel his knock and it will be difficult for him to join us tomorrow (Saturday). The idea is to do some individual work. ""It's the same thing for Raphael. It will be his first training session out on the pitch after doing some work inside. The aim is to have both players ready for Tuesday."" Zidane is expected to rotate his squad on Saturday, with Keylor Navas and Luka Modric rested and Sergio Ramos suspended, although Cristiano Ronaldo will start."
99,07/04/2016,13:25,Wolfsburg boss tells Marcelo to 'cut the acting',"Wolfsburg coach Dieter Hecking has told Real Madrid defender Marcelo to ""cut out the acting"" following his antics during his team's 2-0 Champions League quarter-final first-leg defeat in Germany.","The Brazil left-back thrust his head towards Wolfsburg midfielder Maximilian Arnold's chest in the 69th minute of Real's shock defeat, then crumpled to the turf, clutching his face. Arnold, who scored Wolfsburg's second after a penalty from Ricardo Rodriguez, was shown a yellow card, while Marcelo escaped a booking for the incident. ""Marcelo is an actor,"" fumed Hecking. The Wolfsburg coach sought out the Real star at Wolfsburg's Volkswagen Arena stadium after the game to tell him not to try anything similar for the return leg in Madrid on Tuesday. ""I told Marcelo to cut his acting out. He couldn't have complained if he'd found himself no longer on the pitch after that scene,"" added Hecking. ""Arnold got a yellow card he didn't deserve. That annoyed me, because there was no need."" Arnold gave a tongue-in-cheek answer when asked about the incident following his heated exchange with Marcelo on the pitch. ""We ended up talking about our haircuts,"" said the German with a grin. Marcelo's theatrics were ridiculed on social media and drew comparisons to his fellow Brazilian Rivaldo's play-acting at the 2002 World Cup. Swiss full-back Rodriguez converted a penalty in the 18th minute before Arnold slotted home on 25 minutes to leave Real with it all to do next week in Madrid."

""I feel a tremendous anticipation. I think there is nothing better than playing in the Champions League quarterfinals against Real Madrid."" When he was younger, the 22-year-old Draxler used to watch videos of Ronaldo to improve his game. Now the Germany star will once again face the three-times world player of the year. Draxler was impressed with Ronaldo's winning goal in Real's 2-1 victory over Barcelona in Spain's El Clasico on Saturday. He hopes Wolfsburg can get a result at the Volkswagen Arena to put then in a good position for the return at the Bernabeu on April 12. ""We hope that we can keep them at bay as much as possible in the two games. At the end of the day, it's about Wolfsburg v Real Madrid, not Wolfsburg against Ronaldo,"" said Draxler. He has plenty of experience of facing Real's star-studded team which will include the likes of Wales forward Gareth Bale and Draxler's Die Mannschaft team-mate Toni Kroos. Two years ago, Draxler was in the Schalke team which was hammered 6-1 by Real in Gelsenkirchen's Veltins Arena in the Champions League. They then lost the return 3-1 at the Bernabeu for a 9-2 aggregate defeat in the last 16 as Madrid went onto win the Champions League title and claim their tenth European crown. ""I am pretty sure that we can get a good result in our own stadium,"" said Draxler. ""We need to have due respect, but not be afraid of Real Madrid. ""We need to be physically robust, 100 percent mentally there, be compact at the back and sting them on counter-attacks."" Wolfsburg have never got this far in the Champions League and will need an outstanding display against Real to give them hope for the return leg. The German Cup holders are eighth in Germany's top flight and winless in their last three games since beating Gent at home in the last 16 to reach the quarterfinals. Last Friday's 3-0 league defeat at Bayer Leverkusen did little to boost confidence. ""The bottom line is we are not acting like a Champions League team in the Bundesliga,"" Wolfsburg's director of sport Klaus Allofs told magazine Kicker. ""This match coming up is for some players something extraordinary and you don't know if you will experience it again. ""So you have to enjoy it and make sure we do a few things well again. ""I don't fear that we will play again like we did in Leverkusen."""

We were second best in a lot of situations,"" said Draxler. ""Real Madrid will be a very different game and it's a different competition. ""Our job was to concentrate on Leverkusen, but our performance wasn't up to scratch."" Wolfsburg had few answers at Leverkusen's BayArena on Friday and there was little to suggest they will trouble Real at the Volkswagen Arena in their bid for a semi-final berth. Hosts Bayer dominated with an early goal by winger Julian Brandt before Javier Hernandez came off the bench for the last half an hour to make it 2-0 on 73 minutes with an excellent curling strike in off the far post. Fellow replacement Vladlen Yurchenko grabbed their third in the dying stages before Chilean midfielder Charles Aranguiz came on to make his debut for Leverkusen. The win lifted Leverkusen to fourth, before Saturday's fixtures, to keep them on course for a Champions League spot for next season. Wolfsburg are now eighth in the German league, ten points adrift of an automatic place in Europe's top domestic competition. ""Things don't look good for us right now. You can't say we deserve to be higher in the standings than we are right now,"" said Draxler. ""We've got to improve a lot more to compete where we want to be - at the top of the table."" Hernandez was described as ""exceptional"" by fellow goal-scorer Brandt after his Atlantic odyssey to make the game. 'Chicharito' scored for Mexico in their 3-0 win in a World Cup qualifier in Vancouver last Saturday. He came off the bench in the 2-0 victory in Mexico City on Tuesday before jetting home to Germany, but he brushed off his jetlag with a superb goal back in Leverkusen. ""It was a very important win for our pursuit of a top-four finish,"" said Hernandez, who scored his 15th league goal of the season. ""I travelled a lot during the international break, but I felt good and was pleased to get some minutes under my belt."""

Roger Schmidt's side led at the interval at the BayArena thanks to a fine strike by youngster Julian Brandt, who exchanged passes with Hakan Calhanoglu before slotting low past Diego Benaglio from the edge of the area. Hernandez, just back from international duty across the Atlantic, emerged from the bench in the second half and made it 2-0 with an excellent curling strike in off the far post. And fellow substitute Vladlen Yurchenko also got his name on the scoresheet, his first Bundesliga goal coming before the Chilean midfielder Charles Aranguiz came on to make his debut for Leverkusen. Aranguiz had signed on at the BayArena last summer after helping his country win the Copa America, only to succumb to injury almost immediately. Schalke 04 and Borussia Moenchengladbach will both hope to climb back above Leverkusen later this weekend. Schalke go to Ingolstadt while Gladbach face a tough test at home to Hertha Berlin, who are third, on Sunday. The defeat was hardly ideal preparation for Wolfsburg ahead of their Champions League quarter-final, first leg against Real Madrid next Wednesday. Dieter Hecking's side have gone three Bundesliga games without a win and are eighth in the table."
103,21/03/2016,18:06,Kruse dropped from Germany squad for poor behaviour,"Wolfsburg striker Max Kruse was dropped from the Germany squad on Monday for upcoming friendlies against England and Italy following a string of off-pitch indiscretions, the German FA announced.","Germany coach Joachim Loew removed Kruse from his 27-man squad, citing a ""number of incidents"" in which the striker's behaviour was deemed unprofessional, the DFB said in a statement. ""I want players who are also focused on their football and the European Championship in between games. Max has behaved unprofessionally yet again and I won't accept that,"" Loew said in a statement. While celebrating his 28th birthday over the weekend, Kruse was involved in an argument with a journalist at a Berlin nightclub after the player was reportedly unhappy at having his picture taken without permission. According to German daily Bild, Wolfsburg fined Kruse 25,000 euros ($27,800) over the incident, just days after the Bundesliga club slapped him with a similar fine for leaving 75,000 euros in the back of a taxi. Kruse, who is a keen poker player, reportedly forgot the huge amount of cash in a holdall during an early morning taxi ride through Berlin last October. While the suspension ""initially applies"" to Saturday's game against England and the world champions' clash with Italy on March 29, it will serve a big blow to Kruse's chances of making Germany's squad for Euro 2016. ""The Euros this summer are drawing closer and we have big aims with the national team. We need players who are focused and are conscious of their responsibilities as a role model,"" added Lowe. Kruse has scored four goals in 14 appearances for Germany."

He missed both legs of Wolfsburg's last 16 clash against Belgium's Gent after the German club had reached the knockout stages for the first time in their history. But now the 26-year-old hopes to make his return against Bayer Leverkusen on April 1 having taken part in Wolfsburg training on Tuesday for the first time since his injury. ""Of course, I'd like to play this weekend (against Darmstadt), but I don't think I'll manage that,"" Dost told Sky. ""The weekend afterwards is an international window and then there's the Leverkusen game -- I must manage that."" Wolfsburg will learn on Friday who they will face in the last 16 of the Champions League when the draw is made in Nyon on Friday with the first leg to be played on April 5/6 with the return on 12/13."""
105,14/03/2016,14:25,"Kruse fined for losing 75,000 euros in a taxi","VfL Wolfsburg have reportedly fined Germany striker Max Kruse 25,000 euros ($27,805) after he left 75,000 euros in cash in a bag during an early morning taxi ride through Berlin.","The 27-year-old, who is a keen poker player, reportedly forgot the huge amount of cash in a holdall in the back of a cab in the early hours of October 18 last year. News that Kruse had lost so much money only came to light when he lodged a complaint in February with Berlin's police, who are investigating, but his employers have taken a dim view of his carelessness. ""Some people would have never seen so much money in their lives and certainly not in cash,"" Wolfsburg's director of sport Klaus Allofs told German daily Bild. ""There was a conversation between Max, myself and our coach (Dieter Hecking) and he has been fined. ""We explained to him what kind of behaviour we expect from our players in their free time in public. ""I can only hope that this is a lesson for him and he will change his behaviour somewhat. ""These days, you can no longer say 'when I drive out of the training ground, I am a private person'."" Wolfsburg need no off-pitch distractions having reached the Champions League quarter-finals, but suffered a shock 1-0 defeat to relegation-threatened Hoffenheim in the Bundesliga on Saturday. Kruse's negligence will do little to help his chances of adding to his 14 caps, with a place in Germany's squad for the European championships in June, as head coach Joachim Loew is known to frown upon such behaviour. For the past two years, Kruse has opted to spend his end-of-season holiday at the World Series of Poker championships in Las Vegas. He won $36,000 after finishing third in one category at the poker event in 2014 while his Germany team-mates were winning the World Cup."
106,12/03/2016,17:49,Wolfsburg suffer Euro hangover at Hoffenheim,Wolfsburg suffered a Champions League hangover on Saturday with a 1-0 defeat at relegation-threatened Hoffenheim in the Bundesliga as Andrej Kramaric scored a third-minute winner.,"Wolfsburg reached the last eight in Europe on Tuesday for the first time in the club's history as their 1-0 win at home to Gent sealed a 4-2 win on aggregate in the last 16. But Dieter Hecking's side were stunned by second-from-bottom Hoffenheim in Sinsheim as Kramaric, on loan from Leicester until the end of the season, scored after just three minutes for his third goal in the Bundesliga. Hoffenheim should have scored a second as Germany forward Kevin Volland had a penalty saved after Wolfsburg goalkeeper Koen Casteels brought down Kramaric in the area. Volland had demanded to take the second-half spot-kick, which Kramaric had wanted to attempt himself, but held his head in his hands when Casteels palmed his effort away This was Wolfsburg's first defeat in four games since going down 2-0 to league leaders Bayern Munich at the end of last month. The defeat leaves Wolfsburg outside the top six while Hoffenheim remain two points from safety. Hoffenheim's win pushed bottom side Hanover 96 closer to relegation as they suffered a 2-0 defeat at home to Cologne with Leonardo Bittencourt scoring both goals. Eintracht Frankfurt's new coach Niko Kovac suffered a 3-0 defeat on his Bundesliga debut as his side were humbled at Borussia Moenchengladbach to stay in the relegation places. Kovac, who coached Croatia to the 2014 World Cup and took over after Armin Veh was sacked last Sunday, made four changes to the starting line-up, but it did little to stop Frankfurt going eight games without a win. Hanover's Lars Stindl opened the scoring by drilling in his shot on 36 minutes and the hosts doubled their lead when Raffael casually curled home a clearance kick from Frankfurt goalkeeper Lukas Hradecky on 53 minutes. Gladbach's Syria-born midfielder Mahmoud Dahoud added Gladbach's third 11 minutes from time after a mistake from Frankfurt midfielder Stefan Reinartz. A foul on South Korea midfielder Ja-Cheol Koo in the dying stages of Augsburg's 2-2 draw at Darmstadt led to his side taking a crucial point. Darmstadt took a 2-0 lead through Sandro Wagner and Mario Vrancic before Augsburg hit back with goals from Markus Feulner and a penalty by Alfred Finnbogason after Koo was fouled with a minute left to play. Things remain tight in the relegation battle with three points now separating five teams. Australia striker Mathew Leckie scored only his second goal of the season as he headed home from close range in mid-table Ingolstadt's 3-3 draw at home to Stuttgart. German league leaders Bayern Munich host Werder Bremen on Saturday night while second-placed Borussia Dortmund host Mainz on Sunday. On Friday, Hertha Berlin cemented third place in the table with a 2-0 win over nearest rivals Schalke thanks to goals from defender Niklas Stark and striker Vedad Ibisevic."
107,08/03/2016,22:44,Schuerrle fires Wolfsburg into Champions League quarters,Andre Schuerrle fired Wolfsburg into the Champions League quarter-finals for the first time to seal Tuesday's 1-0 victory and a 4-2 aggregate win over Gent.,"Having lost the first-leg 3-2 at home, Gent arrived in Germany needing to score at least twice but Schuerrle ended their hopes with a goal 16 minutes from time. It was his Germany team-mate Julian Draxler, who scored twice in the first-leg, who danced around Gent defender Nana Asare to provide the cross which Schuerrle drilled home. It capped a fine seven days for the Germany winger after Schuerrle hit his first Bundesliga hat-trick the previous Tuesday in a 4-0 romp over Hanover. Hitting the winner against Gent will further raise his stock at Wolfsburg, who are now seventh -- four points from a Champions League place next season -- in Germany's top flight. Gent coach Hein Vanhaezebrouck said he wanted his team to unsettle the hosts, but his side was restricted to just six shots on goal. Nigerian forward Moses Simon's low cross lacked a boot to turn it as Gent's best first-half chance went begging, but their challenge gradually petered out. Wolfsburg effectively closed the game down in the first-half by restricting Gent to only a series of half chances. Schuerrle deserved his goal and had a great chance approaching the hour mark but his shot was blocked by Gent midfielder Renato Neto. Gent centre-back Rami Gershon then blocked a Schuerrle shot, which had been heading for the back of the net, on 70 minutes. Soon after, Vanhaezebrouck brought on Mali forward Kalifa Coulibaly, who scored Gent's second goal in the first leg, to try and break the deadlock. It was Wolfsburg who finally opened the scoring, though, when Draxler, who had scored in both of Wolfsburg's previous games, turned provider. The attacking midfielder picked out Schuerrle's arrival in the box for his team-mate to rifle home to the delight of the home fans. In the dying stages, Gent midfielder Brecht Dejaegere fired over, but it was too little, too late. Both sides had qualified for the knock-out stages for the first time, but it is German Cup holders Wolfsburg who go into the last eight pot."

Like their hosts, they are in the last 16 of Europe's elite club competition for the first time and both sides are eager to make more history. Gent's coach Hein Vanhaezebrouck knows his side's performance in the first 80 minutes of the first leg let them down. ""We made a lot of mistakes in the first leg,"" he said. ""But, as everybody knows, miracles happen in football from time to time. ""If we can take the lead, who knows what will happen ""If Wolfsburg take the lead, the task becomes even more difficult for us. ""We have to be focused from the start."" Gent midfielder Renato Neto says the Belgians need the same fighting spirit they showed in the dying stages of the first leg. ""We all need to believe together. We know how difficult it will be -- they'll be playing at home with their fans, but we will go there with belief and try to get the best result,"" said the 24-year-old Brazilian. ""We have to keep our heads up and try to do our best in the return match, try to score the goals we need and not concede.

But the 25-year-old Schuerrle has struggled to hold down a first-team place since joining Wolfsburg from Chelsea a year ago. ""I already have the match ball in the changing room,"" beamed Schuerrle as Wolfsburg got back to winning ways after Saturday's 2-0 defeat at home to Bayern Munich. ""I was playing more as a striker tonight and the change paid off. Of course I'm pleased, but it's the sort of game which is good for the soul."" March 1 is a lucky day for Schuerrle who also scored a hat-trick for Chelsea against Fulham in the Premier League exactly two years ago. His performance will boost his standing at Wolfsburg and in this one game he has scored more goals than in his previous 33 matches for the Champions League side. He needed just 26 minutes to score three goals before Germany team-mate Julian Draxler added Wolfsburg's fourth at Hanover's HDI Arena. Schuerrle opened the scoring by firing home Draxler's pass in off the post on 36 minutes. He doubled his tally on 59 minutes and then claimed his third less than three minutes later when he chested the ball down and fired home with a superb shot. He could have finished with four goals after his chip went just wide of the post before Draxler netted Wolfsburg's fourth on 69 minutes. The win leaves Wolfsburg eighth while Hanover are bottom and six points from safety. The German FA (DFB) is expected to fine both clubs after one of the flares fired from the away fan block hit the Hanover bench before kick-off, but no-one was hurt. ""That sort of thing shouldn't happen in a stadium,"" said Schuerrle in criticising the fans' behaviour. This is not the first time this fixture has been affected by fireworks. In December 2014, Wolfsburg fans also fired four flares and set off a smoke bomb in the away section of Hanover's stadium. Both clubs were fined 6,000 euros ($6,500) at the time. ""There is already some history of this happening and there should be no place for it in football,"" said Hanover captain Christian Schulz. Elsewhere, French striker Anthony Modeste rescued a point for Cologne in their 1-1 draw at Ingolstadt after forward Lukas Hinterseer had given the hosts the lead.

Wolfsburg, who sit eighth in the Bundesliga having won just one of their last 10 games, entertain Belgian side Gent in the second leg of their Champions League last-16 tie on March 8 leading 3-2 from the first leg. The loss of Naldo is a blow for a side looking to reach the Champions League quarter-finals for the first time. Always a threat at a set-piece, the centre-back scored twice when Wolfsburg beat Manchester United 3-2 in December to finish as winners of their Champions League group and eliminate the English giants. ""I felt pain straight away in my right shoulder and couldn't play on,"" said Naldo, who came off in the 76th minute after falling awkwardly while challenging for the ball against Bayern. ""Of course, I am very annoyed that I can't help the team in the important phase of the season."" Wolfsburg have already lost wing-back Sebastian Jung for the rest of the season with a knee injury, while they sold centre-back Timm Klose to Norwich City in January. ""Naldo was a first-choice player and one of our top performers, this is a big loss for us,"" Wolfsburg's sporting director Klaus Allofs told broadcaster Sport1. ""This is the sort of thing we really don't need right now."" Wolfsburg are at bottom side Hanover on Tuesday in the north German derby, then host Borussia Moenchengladbach next Saturday before facing Gent. In the coming games, Brazil centre-back Dante will pair up with Robin Knoche, but the Wolves are light on centre-back options should either player get injured."
114,27/02/2016,17:47,'Lewo' nets again as Bayern go 11 clear,Robert Lewandowski scored his 23rd league goal of the season on Saturday as runaway Bundesliga leaders Bayern Munich went 11 points clear with a 2-0 win at Wolfsburg.,"Pep Guardiola's Bayern now have 62 points out of a possible 69, their tally exactly double that of Wolfsburg, who are eighth. A tight tussle was settled by second-half goals as Kingsley Coman scored for the first time since November before Lewandowski netted for the 33rd time this season in all competitions. The Poland hot-shot's 23 league goals in 22 games keep him as the league's top scorer. With second-placed Borussia Dortmund hosting second-from-bottom Hoffenheim on Sunday, Bayern took the chance to extend their lead. Both teams came into the Volkswagen Arena clash jaded -- Wolfsburg had 12 players either ill or struggling with injury in the build-up. Meanwhile, fresh from their 2-2 Champions League draw at Juventus in midweek, Bayern again fielded a back four without a recognised centre-back. Jerome Boateng, Javi Martinez and Holger Badstuber were all again sidelined, but the visitors shut out their hosts and it was Coman who broke the deadlock approaching the midway point in the second half. When Lewandowski's shot headed skywards after being blocked, Coman arrived unmarked in the box to fire home on 66 minutes. Both sides had their chances as Wolfsburg 'keeper Koen Casteels, who had flu in midweek, denied Lewandowski and Mueller before Coman beat him. At the other end, Bayern goalkeeper Manuel Neuer had a busy afternoon, denying Wolfsburg's German international duo Julian Draxler and Max Kruse. Lewandowski's goal was stamped 'Made in France' as Coman's cross was met by substitute Franck Ribery, who flicked the ball on to the striker to fire home on 74 minutes. In the dying stages, a superb Neuer save denied Kruse's fierce shot as Wolfsburg sought a consolation. Elsewhere, bottom side Hanover gained ground in the relegation battle with a shock 2-1 win at Stuttgart after an eight-match losing streak. Japan midfielder Hiroshi Kiyotake capped his first start since November after injury by setting up both goals for defender Christian Schulz. It means just three points separate the bottom three sides, but Hanover remain five points from safety. Swiss striker Josip Drmic scored his first goal for Hamburg in their 1-1 draw at home to Ingolstadt, whose striker Lukas Hinterseer headed an equaliser. Both sides are in mid-table, but Werder Bremen are deep in the relegation battle despite their 2-2 draw at home to Darmstadt. Anthony Ujah's early opener was cancelled out by Darmstadt's Sandro Wagner, and Aytac Sulu headed Darmstadt ahead on 82 minutes before Claudio Pizarro gave Bremen a 90th-minute equaliser. On Friday, Hertha Berlin strengthened their grip on third place with a 1-0 victory at Cologne. Hertha arrived in Cologne without a win in five, but Bosnia striker Vedad Ibisevic scored to hand Pal Dardai's side their first league victory of 2016. ""It's nothing against Cologne, but they've been one of my favourite teams to play against this season,"" said Ibisevic, who also scored twice against the same opponents in a 2-0 win in September."

Injury and illness mean Wolfsburg have 12 players either ruled out or struggling to be fit to face Pep Guardiola's league leaders at the Volkswagen Arena. Bayern are eight points clear of second-placed Borussia Dortmund -- and a massive 28 ahead of eighth-placed Wolfsburg. Between them Lewandowski and fellow Bayern forward Thomas Mueller have scored a combined tally of 39 Bundesliga goals -- more than the entire Wolfsburg team. Wolfsburg's ex-Bayern defender Dante says the only way to stop Lewandowski is to cut off his supply. ""If we defend as a team and the ball doesn't come to him, then he can't really do anything,"" said the Brazilian. ""We have to really get things going and be up for the game. ""We have to go into each one-on-one with real passion and every pass must hit the target."" Four days after their 2-2 draw at Juventus in the Champions League, Guardiola is set to rotate his Bayern squad, especially with defenders Holger Badstuber, Jerome Boateng and Javi Martinez all sidelined. Winger Franck Ribery could start his first Bundesliga game for a year, while Wolfsburg coach Dieter Hecking could be down to his third-choice goalkeeper with Diego Benaglio injured and Koen Casteels recovering from flu. On Sunday evening, Dortmund host rejuvented strugglers Hoffenheim. Thomas Tuchel's side is a force to be reckoned with and are unbeaten this season at their Signal Iduna Park stadium having picked up 28 points from a possible 30 at home. Second-from-bottom Hoffenheim earned fresh hope in the relegation battle when they claimed a 3-2 win over Mainz last weekend under their 28-year-old coach Julian Nagelsmann. Dortmund will be without Greek centre-back Sokratis, who is sidelined for three weeks with a groin injury, and Neven Subotic is set to take his place. Hertha Berlin are at Cologne on Friday night hoping to end their run of five league games without a win despite staying third in the table. Hertha coach Pal Dardai will be counting on Ivory Coast striker Salomon Kalou to add to his tally of eight goals scored away from home, the most on the road for any Bundesliga player. Bayer Leverkusen will not have coach Roger Schmidt on their bench for Sunday's match at Mainz. The 48-year-old is banned for three league games, and was fined 20,000 euros ($22,031), for refusing a referee's order to leave the touchline during last Sunday's 1-0 league defeat at home to Dortmund. Mainz are up to seventh in the table and are unbeaten in their last five home games, while Leverkusen's defeat to Dortmund broke their six-game unbeaten run.

But with Volkswagen being the Bundesliga club's main backer, Wolfsburg bosses have taken a dim view of the Danish forward's decision to use a picture featuring a rival manufacturer's car. ""We have our rules, one of those being that you must pay attention to how you are photographed in public,"" said Wolfsburg's director of sport Klaus Allofs. ""The rules are not new. ""It's misconduct and it's careless, which at the end of the day will cost (Bendtner) money."" The 28-year-old ex-Arsenal forward has completely fallen out of favour with Wolfsburg's head coach Dieter Hecking and plays second fiddle to Dutch striker Bas Dost and Germany's Max Kruse. His two-year contract expires in June and, with nine goals in 47 appearances for Wolfsburg, Bendtner is likely to be seeking a new employer at the end of the season. The Danish bad-boy seems to have curbed the indiscipline (drink driving and other alcohol-related indiscretions) which blighted his nine years at Arsenal, plus loan spells at Birmingham, Juventus and Sunderland, before he joined Wolfsburg in 2014. After a difficult first season, the 28-year-old scored a late equaliser, then netted in the penalty shoot-out, when Wolfsburg beat Bayern Munich in the German Super Cup last August, but soon found himself back on the bench. ""I've said all there is to say,"" was Hecking's dismissive reply on Friday when asked about Bendtner, who turned down an offer in January to play in China. Bendtner was left out of the match squad for Wolfsburg's 3-2 win at Gent on Wednesday in the last 16, first-leg of the Champions League, but is expected to be on the bench for Saturday's Bundesliga match at Hertha Berlin. Wolfsburg have a mounting injury list with Dost (fractured foot), Diego Benaglio (rib injury), Daniel Caligiuri (bruised thigh), Andre Schuerrle (torn hamstring), Joshua Guilavogui (hip injury) and Sebastian Jung (torn knee ligament) all out."

Draxler was superb at the Ghelamco Arena, having also tormented Manchester United in Wolfsburg's 3-2 win in December in the final round of group matches which condemned Louis van Gaal's Red Devils to the Europa League. Draxler's Germany team-mate Kruse added Wolfsburg's third on 60 minutes as the Gent defence capitulated and he nearly added a fourth just moments later by hitting the woodwork. But Wolfsburg, last season's German Cup winners, lost their shape badly after Gent captain Sven Kums scored with 10 minutes to go before Kalifa Coulibaly added a second just before the final whistle. The Germans were forced into a first-half change when right-back Sebastian Jung succumbed to a leg knock to make way for ex-Chelsea winger Andre Schuerrle. But persistent pressure from the away side had paid off just before that when Draxler created a superb opening goal. He showed why Wolfsburg paid 35 million euros ($39.4m) to sign him from Schalke last August by brilliantly turning Thomas Foket near the left touchline. Draxler then sprinted away from the defence and played a neat one-two with Vieirinha before slotting the return pass into the bottom right-hand corner on 44 minutes. Draxler doubled Wolfsburg's lead just after the break when he pounced on a mistake in the Gent defence. The 22-year-old snapped up a loose pass, played the ball between Stefan Mitrovic's legs and chipped Gent's onrushing goalkeeper Matz Sels on 54 minutes. His classy finish took the wind out of the hosts' sails, and Wolfsburg's third followed six minutes later when Christian Traesch's pin-point cross was met in the middle by Kruse, who fired home from close range. The Wolfsburg striker hit the woodwork two minutes later as the Gent defence again left him in acres of space, but he mistimed his shot. Gent were surprise qualifiers from their group behind winners Zenit St Petersburg, knocking out Valencia and Lyon, and they finally showed some fighting spirit in the closing stages. Kums gave his side hope by beating two defenders and curling his shot around Wolfsburg's Belgian goalkeeper Koen Casteels 10 minutes from time. Wolfsburg's defence vanished and Coulibaly headed their second on 89 minutes when he got in front of centre-back Dante at a corner to give his side some reason to believe for the return."
118,16/02/2016,18:28,Gent coach ready for toughest test yet,Gent coach Hein Vanhaezebrouck said on Tuesday he expects Wednesday's Champions League last 16 clash at home to Wolfsburg to be his side's hardest of the season.,"The plucky Belgian outfit were surprise qualifiers from their group behind winners Zenit St Petersburg, knocking out Valencia and Lyon. But the struggling Bundesliga outfit, who eliminated Manchester United in the pool stage, will be another step up according to Vanhaezebrouck. ""Our group wasn't the most difficult, but it was nonetheless an achievement (to progress),"" said the coach. ""Against Wolfsburg another challenge awaits us. It will be our toughest match of the season. ""We need to avoid silly mistakes in the Champions League. If we concede stupid goals like we have recently in the league, well, then we'll have problems."" But having surprised everyone, themselves chiefly, by qualifying for the knock-out stages, Vanhaezebrouck has no intention of giving up now on their unlikely run. ""We can't afford any mis-steps if we want to keep on dreaming. ""We're not thinking about the historic impact on the club, we're just concentrating on the task at hand: get a good result to take to the return leg on March 8 at the Volkswagen Arena (in Wolfsburg)."""
119,16/02/2016,02:00,Resurgent Wolfsburg head to Ghent buoyed by Draxler,"VfL Wolfsburg head to Belgian league side Ghent for Wednesday's Champions League last 16, first-leg, with renewed confidence after Germany's Julian Draxler helped break their six-match winless streak.","German cup holders Wolfsburg powered their way into the knock-out stages by beating Louis van Gaal's Manchester United 3-2 at home last December to condemn the Red Devils to the Europa League. Germany midfielder Draxler ran riot while Brazilian defender Naldo headed two goals to put Wolfsburg in the last 16 of Europe for the first time in the club's history. But since beating United, the Germans failed to win any of their next five games until Draxler scored in Saturday's 2-0 win over Ingolstadt to stay eighth in the Bundesliga. The 22-year-old World Cup winner finished the move he started before defender Robin Knoche added the second after the break. Having been booed in losing at Schalke the week before, Wolfsburg's victory gave the side much-needed confidence ahead of the trip to Belgium. ""The fans were right to criticise us,"" said Draxler, who cost Wolfsburg 35 million euros ($39.4m) from Schalke last August. ""We hadn't shown for a while what we could do. ""We've drawn a line under things now and got the three points we needed."" But Wolfsburg coach Dieter Hecking has warned his side to expect a much tougher test at Ghent than Ingolstadt provided. ""We mustn't make so many mistakes,"" said Hecking as 124 of his side's 377 passes went astray last Saturday. ""We need more ball possession to make the opponent chase after us. ""Julian had his moment, he looked dangerous in front of goal, which is why we signed him,"" added Hecking. ""But he is also struggling for form. ""What applies to him also goes for the whole team: we can still do better."" Knoche is expected to start in Ghent at centre-back for Naldo, who is suspended after picking up his third European booking in the win over United. Ghent's 1-0 defeat to title rivals Brugge cost them top spot in the Belgian league a week ago to leave them second. But they warmed-up for Wolfsburg with a 2-0 win over Mouscron-Peruwelz last Friday thanks to goals from Mbark Boussoufa and Danijel Milicevic. The Swiss midfielder is doubtful with an ankle injury, but Ghent need their top scorer in Europe with Milicevic having scored three goals in their six games. Naldo expects his team to endure a tough night at the Ghelamco Arena as Gent try to make the quarter-finals fo the Champions League at their first attempt. ""They're a team that won't lie down, a team that always look for goals,"" said Naldo. ""They took out some big teams along the way, like Valencia and Lyon. ""We have to be ready because they will come out fighting to make history in the Champions League."""
120,13/02/2016,18:06,Wolfsburg stop the rot ahead of Ghent clash,VfL Wolfsburg warmed up for their midweek Champions League clash at Ghent with a 2-0 win over Ingolstadt on Saturday for their first victory since knocking Manchester United out of Europe last December.,"Dieter Hecking's Wolfsburg won for the first time in six matches ahead of Wednesday's clash at Belgian league leaders Gent in their last 16, first-leg match. The previous occasion when Wolves won, they consigned Louis van Gaal's Red Devils to the Europa League with a 3-2 home victory to book their place in the knock-out phase of the Champions League. After Ingolstadt lost the ball near the halfway line in the Bundesliga match, Germany midfielder Julian Draxler finished off the move he started by giving Wolfsburg a 29th minute lead at the Volkswagen Arena. Defender Robin Knoche then added a second just before the break when Wolfsburg's Brazil defender Naldo won a header and Knoche claimed his first goal of the season. After playing Ghent, Wolfsburg take on Hertha Berlin, leaders Bayern Munich, bottom side Hanover 96 and Borussia Moenchengladbach in Germany's top flight before the home leg against the Belgians on March 8."
121,13/02/2016,17:48,Mkhitaryan seals Dortmund win to trim Bayern lead,Henrikh Mkhitaryan's superb second-half goal sealed Borussia Dortmund's 1-0 win over Hanover 96 on Saturday to trim Bayern Munich's lead at the top of the Bundesliga to five points.,"Dortmund were without injured star striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, who missed his first league match of the season having netted 20 goals in as many league games. In his absence, Mkhitaryan showed superb individual skill for the winner at Dortmund's Signal Iduna Park. With Marcel Schmelzer screaming up in support on his left, Mkhitaryan cut back inside and curled his right-footed shot around Hanover's Germany goalkeeper Ron-Robert Zieler on 57 minutes. With Pep Guardiola's Bayern at Augsburg on Sunday, Dortmund remain second while Hanover are rooted to the bottom, seven points from safety. Wolfsburg warmed up for Wednesday's Champions League, last 16, first-leg at Ghent with a 2-0 win at home to Ingolstadt to pick up their first victory since knocking Manchester United out of Europe in December. Dieter Hecking's Wolfsburg won for the first time in six games but stay eighth after first-half goals goals by Germany midfielder Julian Draxler and defender Robin Knoche. Bayer Leverkusen moved up from seventh to third as they bounced back from their shock German Cup exit at the hands of Werder Bremen in mid-week with a 2-1 comeback win at Darmstadt. On a heavy pitch, Sandro Wagner stabbed the ball home to give Darmstadt an early lead, despite Leverkusen goalkeeper Bernd Leno catching him around the throat with his forearm. Leverkusen drew level when Darmstadt defender Aytac Sulu headed into his own net on 62 minutes. The visitors then took the lead with a sweeping move which went the length of the pitch. From a Darmstadt corner, junior Julian Brandt started the move he finished by tapping home Kevin Kampl's final pass for the winner on 77 minutes. VfB Stuttgart's impressive form continued as they picked up their fifth-straight league win to go ninth with a 2-0 win at home to Hertha Berlin. A long-range strike from Ivory Coast defensive midfielder Serey Die and a second-half goal from left-wing Filip Kostic sealed the hosts' win. Hertha suffered their first defeat in nine games since losing 2-0 at Bayern in November to drop to fourth. The youngest manager in Bundesliga history made his debut when Julian Nagelsmann, 28, was on Hoffenheim's bench for their 1-1 draw at Werder Bremen in the basement battle. Nagelsmann took over after predecessor Huub Stevens resigned on Wednesday due to heart problems. Despite Hoffenheim taking the lead on 10 minutes through Croatia striker Andrej Kramaric, Werder hit back three minutes later as former Chelsea defender Papy Djilobodji scored his first Bremen goal. The result leaves both teams in the relegation places."
122,07/02/2016,16:22,Hecking cracks whip with Wolfsburg in freefall,Wolfsburg's coach Dieter Hecking cracked the whip on Sunday with his team in Bundesliga free-fall since knocking Manchester United out of Europe and their Champions League clash at Ghent just 10 days away.,"Wolfsburg booked their place in the Champions League's last 16 as group winners with an impressive 3-2 home win over United on December 8 as Germany midfielder Julian Draxler ran Louis van Gaal's Red Devils ragged and Brazil defender Naldo netted two headers. The victory consigned United to the Europa League while Wolfsburg reached the Champions League's knock-out stages for the first time in the club's history. But league results have taken a downward spiral since with Wolfsburg winless in their last five games and Saturday's lifeless 3-0 defeat at Schalke in Germany's top flight snapped Hecking's patience. Instead of the usual gentle recovery session, the Wolfsburg squad found themselves sweating during an intense 100-minute session on Sunday morning. Ghent, who are top of the Belgian league, host Wolfsburg on February 17 with the return leg in Germany on March 8 and Hecking has much to sort out if his club are to reach the quarter-finals in Europe ""I'm annoyed and with good reason,"" fumed Hecking. ""If Schalke had counter-attacked us better before the half-time break, then it could have been three or four-nil (at half-time). ""That's very alarming. In the second half, it was just about damage limitation. ""It's not enough. The team is not playing like a team at the moment. That is the basic problem."" Having been fourth in mid-December, the alarm bells started ringing after a shock 3-1 defeat just before Christmas at Stuttgart, who left the relegation places as a consequence, sent Wolfsburg tumbling down to seventh. Then came a 3-2 loss on their January return after the winter break at Eintracht Frankfurt, whose captain Alexander Meier hit a hat-trick, followed by a 1-1 draw at Cologne last weekend before the crash to Schalke left them eighth. Wolfsburg were 2-0 down at the break at Schalke as striker Klaas-Jan Huntelaar netted his first league goal for two months before midfielder Johannes Geis drilled in a free-kick. Then new-signing Alessandro Schoepf netted a late third for Schalke as Wolfsburg failed to take their chances despite dominating possession. Draxler had to deal with jeers, boos and whistles from the home fans on his first return to Gelsenkirchen since signing for Wolfsburg last August for 35 million euros ($39 million), after 14 years with Schalke, following Kevin de Bruyne's sale to Manchester City. ""It was nice to see a few old faces again, but in general it was a game to forget,"" said the 22-year-old Draxler. ""I can understand the fans, but we lost an important game 3-0 and that's bitter."" The Wolfsburg squad can expect more tough sessions ahead of next Saturday's home league match against mid-table Ingolstadt before they take on Ghent. ""Right now, there are no positives to take, but I know which wheels I have to set in motion,"" said Hecking. Wolfsburg's director of sport Klaus Allofs says his coach's position is not under threat - for now. ""For me, the coach's position doesn't come into question,"" added Allofs."
123,31/01/2016,17:47,Cologne draw keeps Wolfsburg winless since United,Wolfsburg remain winless in their four games since beating Manchester United in the Champions League after being held to a 1-1 Bundesliga draw at home to Cologne on Sunday.,"Wolfsburg face Gent in the away leg of their last-16 clash in Europe on February 17. But Dieter Hecking's side have now lost two and drawn two in their last four games since knocking United out of the Champions League with a 3-2 win last December. Wolfsburg's luck deserted them again at their Volkswagen Arena as they threw away a second-half lead. The hosts went ahead when right-winger Vieirinha fired in a cross, which found Julian Draxler unmarked for the Germany international to fire home on 67 minutes. But Cologne equalised eight minutes later when Leonardo Bittencourt's pass put Anthony Modeste into space. The Frenchman then unleashed a superb curling shot which beat Wolves 'keeper Diego Benaglio. The result leaves Wolfsburg seventh -- outside the European places for next season -- and Cologne ninth. Bayern Munich host Hoffenheim later on Sunday, without Javi Martinez who is their latest star to pick up an injury. On Saturday, Borussia Dortmund moved within five points of the Bavarians with a 2-0 win over Ingolstadt as Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang scored twice to leave him with 20 league goals in 19 games. Dortmund could consider themselves fortunate though as captain Mats Hummels escaped a red card for a foul in the area, then scored a second-half own-goal, which the referee refused to award to Ingolstadt after a foul in the build-up. The result stretched Dortmund's lead over third-placed Hertha Berlin to 10 points. Hertha threw away a 2-0 lead as hosts Werder Bremen roared back with three goals in ten second-half minutes to claim a point in a 3-3 draw. Ivory Coast veteran Salomon Kalou struck Berlin's third goal to leave Hertha 3-1 up in Bremen with 20 minutes left. Then Bremen veteran Claudio Pizarro netted a penalty before defender Santiago Garcia fired in a shot which was later credited to Pizarro, who nudged the ball over the line to level the scores. Bayer Leverkusen climbed to fourth with a 3-0 win at Hanover 96, who dropped to the bottom, with Javier Hernandez scoring twice in the romp. 'Chicharito' converted a penalty, then drilled home his 13th league goal in 16 matches. He has now scored 21 times in all competitions this season since joining from Manchester United. Schalke have youth to thank for their 2-0 win at Darmstadt as dynamic midfielders Max Meyer and Leroy Sane, who are both 20, scored either side of half-time. The win left the Royal Blues fifth in the table and relieves some of the pressure on coach Andre Breitenreiter after last Sunday's shock home defeat against Bremen. Schalke and Leverkusen's wins meant Borussia Moenchengladbach slid from fourth to sixth after Friday's 1-0 defeat to mid-table Mainz. Mid-table sides Augsburg and Eintracht Frankfurt fought out a goalless draw in Bavaria. Strugglers Stuttgart are two points clear of the relegation places after their dramatic 2-1 win at home to mid-table Hamburg. Stuttgart's new signing Artem Kravets, who arrived earlier this month from Dynamo Kiev, headed the winnner on 88 minutes for his first Bundesliga goal."
124,24/01/2016,20:00,"Wolfsburg, Schalke crash to shock defeats",Eintracht Frankfurt captain Alexander Meier hit a hat-trick as Champions League side Wolfsburg lost 3-2 away while Schalke also crashed as Sunday yielded two shock Bundesliga defeats.,"Wolfsburg, who face Ghent in the last 16 of the Champions League, are seventh, outside next season's European places, after the Frankfurt defeat. Schalke are sixth after losing 3-1 at home to relegation-threatened Werder Bremen. After Wolfsburg's Germany winger Andre Schuerrle hit a late equaliser in Frankfurt, Wolves were heading for a 2-2 draw before Meier struck a late dramatic winner. Wolfsburg took an early lead when centre-back Dante slotted home on 25 minutes, but Meier, last season's top scorer in Germany's top flight, took advantage of poor Wolfsburg defending. He equalised on 66 minutes, then put his side ahead on 73 minutes before Schuerrle levelled six minutes later. But Meier produced his third goal, from just his third shot, three minutes into added time as Wolfsburg were punished for woeful defending. The result left Wolfsburg seventh, with Eintracht 14th, and means Wolves are winless in their three games since beating Manchester United in their final Champions League group game. Another German league shock then followed in Gelsenkirchen when Schalke crashed despite taking a fourth-minute lead through Cameroon defender Joel Matip from a corner. Bremen remain in the bottom three despite picking up only their fifth win of the season with goals by captain Clemens Fritz, former Bayern and Chelsea striker Claudio Pizarro and Nigeria's Anthony Ujah. Veterans ruled at the Veltins Arena as Fritz, 35, equalised, then turned provider by setting up the 37-year-old Pizarro for his 178th German league goal in his 397th Bundesliga match on 54 minutes. And Fritz again provided the final pass for Ujah to hit Bremen's third, and his eighth of the season, just a minute from time. On Saturday, Borussia Dortmund consolidated second place with a convincing 3-1 win at Borussia Moenchengladbach to trim Bayern Munich's runaway lead. Goals by Dortmund's Marco Reus, Henrikh Mkhitaryan and Ilkay Gundogan, with a consolation from Gladbach's Raffael, sealed the win. It left Dortmund both eight points behind Bayern and eight points ahead of third-placed Hertha Berlin, who were held to a goalless draw at home to Augsburg in the capital. It was only Gladbach's second league defeat since Andre Schubert took charge last September with the team bottom of the table. They stay fourth. On Friday, Bayern kicked-off the second half of the season with a 2-1 win at Hamburg thanks to Robert Lewandowski's two goals. At the other end of the table on Saturday, veteran Portugal striker Hugo Almeida marked his debut for relegation-threatened Hanover 96 with a goal. But he was unable to prevent their 2-1 defeat at home to Darmstadt as Sandro Wagner scored both of the visitors' goals. The defeat left Hanover bottom as ex-Bremen coach Thomas Schaaf took charge of his first game since replacing Michael Frontzeck over the winter break. Darmstadt are 12th. Stuttgart left the relegation places with a 3-1 win at Cologne as Jurgen Kramny picked up his second straight win having been given the head coach role full-time. Bayer Leverkusen stay fifth after their 1-1 draw at Hoffenheim as Jiloan Hamad's goal for the hosts was cancelled out by Leverkusen captain Omer Toprak's late strike. Ingolstadt, who are in their first season in Germany's top flight, earned a 1-0 win at home to Mainz through a Moritz Hartmann penalty to go tenth."

Matt Jarvis, Ivo Pinto and Ben Godfrey have already moved to Carrow Road this month as manager Alex Neil continues to bolster his squad for the fight against relegation. Neil, who is also reportedly on the verge of signing Everton forward Steven Naismith, said Klose's Champions League experience was a significant factor in his decision to sign him. ""Timm has got plenty of experience having played in the Bundesliga, in the Champions League and for his country, which will be an asset to us,"" Neil told Norwich's website. ""As a player, he's got good technical ability and he's solid in the air. He can also play at either right centre-back or left centre-back."" The 27-year-old defender, who played against Manchester United in the Champions League this season, added: ""It was always a dream to play in the Premier League and Norwich have given me a big chance. ""Now I want to give everything I can to be a good player in this league."""

Rest in peace Junior!"" the club wrote on their English language Twitter account while Wolfsburg players wore green hearts on their training tops with Malanda's number 19 at their winter camp in the resort of Lagos on Portugal's Algarve. ""When we look back one year, it was a very difficult time for the team and for VfL. Junior still plays a major role in all of our thoughts and that will continue to be the case,"" Wolfsburg's sporting director Klaus Allofs told the club's website.

United's England striker Wayne Rooney is out with an ankle injury, but United boss Van Gaal says it's up to the players chosen to score the goals at Wolfsburg's Volkswagen Arena to keep United in Europe. ""It is very important for the club and the players to continue in the Champions League,"" says Van Gaal in Monday's press conference. ""You have to prove yourselves, as a club, as a team and as players. ""Football is about scoring goals, it's the most important aspect, and as a manager you can't be pleased when it is like this, you have to score. ""This is the most important match at this moment. ""It is very important for the club to continue in Europe and the players want to show their qualities on the highest podium."" United, a point behind leaders Wolfsburg in the group, need a win to guarantee qualification, but could also go through if Eindhoven lose at home to CSKA Moscow in the group's other game or if both matches are drawn. Van Gaal says relying on the result in Eindhoven is not an option. ""That's why it is very important to beat Wolfsburg,"" said the Dutchman, ""we cannot depend on the result of PSV."" ""You never know for sure, but I have the experience as a manager that the goals will come, because when you are creating chances in the end you will finish them. ""That is why we have that belief, it's a matter of time and I hope we can prove it tomorrow"". United beat Wolfsburg 2-1 at Old Trafford in September and are hoping for a repeat of their 3-1 win at the Volkswagen Arena in 2009 when Michael Owen scored a hat-trick. Germany captain Bastian Schweinsteiger is relishing his first game in his native country with United and is backing his side to break their goal drought. ""We know the situation,"" said Schweinsteiger, the only United player to score in their last three games. ""We beat Wolfsburg in Manchester and we want to do it again. ""We're doing an unbelievable job defensively but we have to be determined to score. I'm convinced we can change it."""

Wolfsburg are licking their wounds after losing 2-1 at home to Borussia Dortmund last Saturday when Japan midfielder Shinji Kawaga hit the winner with virtually the last kick of the Bundesliga match. It was Wolfsburg's first home defeat in 29 games. In a dramatic final two minutes, Ricardo Rodriguez's 90th minute penalty put Wolfsburg level before Kagawa struck the winner just seconds before the final whistle. ""It was a very, very bitter defeat. It cost us so much strength to come back from 1-0 down and we took no points despite a good second-half,"" said Wolfsburg captain Diego Benaglio.

""There are no gifts to share out,"" said Schuerrle. ""We're looking forward to it and know it's a big opportunity for us also to make history with Wolfsburg."" United have struggled in front of goal of late after being held to a goalless draw by PSV Eindhoven at Old Trafford last time out in the Champions League.

Leaders Wolfsburg will reach the knock-out stages for the first time in the club's history with just a draw, while United, who are a point behind, know anything less than a win could see them eliminated. However, United could still qualify even if they draw or lose to Wolfsburg, provided PSV do not better their result at home to CSKA Moscow in the other group match. But Van Gaal wants to leave nothing to chance in Germany. ""We have a huge Champions League match at Wolfsburg,"" Van Gaal told the club's United Review magazine. ""After the disappointing result against Eindhoven at Old Trafford, we now know what we have to do in order to progress to the knockout stages of the competition: win. ""We have not made it easy for ourselves, but we know that victory in Germany will not only guarantee qualification, but also ensure we finish top of our group."" Finishing top of Group B will mean United avoid the likes of Real Madrid, Barcelona and Bayern Munich in the last 16. United lost at the same stage four years ago when a 2-1 defeat at FC Basel saw them bow out in the 2011/12 group stage and Van Gaal's side is still looking for their first away victory in the group for this campaign. United's overall away record against sides from Germany is won five, lost five with four draws. Their fans will have good memories of their last trip to Wolfsburg when former England striker Michael Owen scored a hat-trick in their 3-1 win in December 2009 as the Red Devils reached the quarter-finals. Diego Benaglio and Marcel Schaefer are the only survivors in Wolfsburg's first team and VfL have lost seven in a row against Premier League clubs in Europe. Their last home defeat to an English club was a 2-0 loss to Everton last season in the Europa League's group stages. During his two-year reign as Bayern Munich coach, Van Gaal was unbeaten in four encounters with Wolfsburg, winning three of them.

The Germans still have every chance of qualifying for the knock-out stages and consolidated third in the German league table by hammering Bremen. There was a minute's silence at all Bundesliga grounds this weekend -- the players also wore black armbands -- out of respect for the victims of the Paris terror attacks. Stuttgart's 4-0 thumping at home to Augsburg was delayed by 15 minutes due to the tightened security checks at stadiums across the country. There were no such problems at Wolfsburg's Volkswagen Arena as Bremen gifted their hosts the opener when defender Alejandro Galvez slid the ball into his own net on 11 minutes. Kruse put Wolfsburg 2-0 up at the break by heading home a free-kick then Portugal international Vierinha scored from the right wing on 56 minutes. The floodgates opened when French defensive midfielder, on for the injured Brazil star Luiz Gustavo, stabbed home his shot on 67 minutes.

Bayern again gave last season's German league runners-up a masterclass in attacking football in the second-round clash as Brazil winger Douglas Costa opened the scoring with a thunderbolt from outside the area on 15 minutes. Then Mueller took full advantage of two superb crosses from left-back David Alaba on 20 and 34 minutes to make it 3-0 at the break. The game's tempo dropped in the second half, but Wolfsburg had the last word when midfielder Maximilian Arnold found Andre Schuerrle in space and the Germany winger fired his shot past Bayern goalkeeper Manuel Neuer on 90 minutes. Earlier, two Bundesliga teams suffered embarrassing defeats as Eintracht Frankfurt were humbled 1-0 by third division Erzgebirge Aue and ten-man Mainz crashed out as second division 1860 Munich scored late goals to claim a 2-1 win.

Darmstadt beat Hanover 2-1 in the all-Bundesliga clash with all three goals scored in a frantic five minute spell. Aytac Sulu's strike for Darmstadt on 74 minutes was immediately cancelled out by Hanover striker Artur Sobiech before Darmstadt forward Sandro Wagner chested the ball over the line on 79 minutes for the winning goal. Hertha Berlin needed extra time to seal their 2-1 win over second division FSV Frankfurt as Ivory Coast striker Salomon Kalou scored both Berlin's goals, including netting a 99th minute penalty to settle the tie. Frankfurt finished with ten men when defender Marvin Plattenhardt was sent off right at the end of extra time."

Wolfsburg finished second to Bayern in the Bundesliga last season, but were routed 5-1 last month at the Allianz Arena when Robert Lewandowski scored five goals in just nine minutes. With a place in the third-round at stake in Wolfsburg, Bayern are in no mood to rest on their laurels with Pep Guardiola's side bidding to repeat their 2013 treble of Champions League, German Cup and Bundesliga titles. ""This is a death or glory match,"" said Bayern winger Arjen Robben. Having warmed up for their Bayern clash with a 1-0 win at Darmstadt, Wolfsburg will be the underdogs on Tuesday despite home advantage after beating Guardiola's German league champions on penalties in the pre-season Super Cup. Halting Bayern's star-studded strike force will be Wolfsburg's main concern as their Brazilian centre-backs Naldo and Dante were exposed for pace when the sides met in the September rout. Bayern have scored 33 goals in the first ten league matches and between them Munich strikers Lewandowski and Thomas Mueller have scored 23 Bundesliga goals. Werder Bremen are home to Cologne while Schalke are out for revenge against Borussia Moenchengladbach at the Veltins Arena after the Royal Blues lost 3-1 at Gladbach on Sunday in the league. On Wednesday, Borussia Dortmund are home to second-division neighbours Paderborn, who have won both of their matches since ex-Germany midfielder Stefan Effenberg took charge ten days ago following seven defeats in ten games. Dortmund, the 2012 German Cup winners, warmed up for the cup clash with a 5-1 drubbing of bottom side Augsburg in the Bundesliga on Sunday with Gabon striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang claiming a hat-trick and Germany's Marco Reus netted twice. ""I am really looking forward to the game,"" said Dortmund coach Thomas Tuchel. ""Of course, since Paderborn signed Stefan and had two wins, the match has a new look to it. ""That's the cup, but we will do all we can to win the game. ""I was a big fans of his as a player and I like his style of analysing games. ""I am not surprised that he has got things moving forward, but on Wednesday we want to put our foot on the brake."""
137,21/10/2015,22:59,Wolfsburg down PSV to take top spot,Germany's Wolfsburg scored two second half goals to defeat PSV Eindhoven 2-0 to move top of Champions League Group B on Wednesday.,"After a laboured first half, Bas Dost struck immediately after the break to put the Germans ahead. Max Kruse then followed it up with a headed goal in the 57th minute. In an indication that it was not going to be PSV's night, they then had a late penalty saved by Wolfsburg's Swiss goalkeeper Diego Benaglio. The win puts Wolfsburg two points clear of Manchester United at the top after United drew 1-1 with CSKA Moscow. PSV are now bottom, though only three points behind the leaders at the halfway stage. For Wolfsburg, the victory was yet another success after their 3-0 win over Hoffenheim in the Bundesliga last weekend. Wolfsburg created the first major chances with five minutes gone, Daniel Caligiuri and Julian Draxler forcing two smart saves in quick succession from Jeroen Zoet. PSV slowly settled into the game, but could create nothing before the half hour mark beyond a couple of long range efforts from Andres Guardado and Jorrit Hendrix. With 35 minutes gone, Wolfsburg sprang into life. Luiz Gustavo, Kruse and Dost all had major chances from just inside the box within the space of three minutes, but none were able to trouble Zoet. At the other end, PSV had a penalty appeal turned down after Naldo appeared to handle the ball. The visitors then wasted the best chance of the half, Adam Maher heading wide after Simon Busk Poulsen's cross found him unmarked in the box. Wolfsburg took the lead immediately after half-time when Joshua Guilavogui's long range shot was parried by Zoet and Dost tapped in on the rebound. Dost nearly made it two on 50 minutes, heading the ball over the bar after a cross from Christian Trasch. Kruse doubled Wolfsburg's lead in the 57th minute. After a fantastic run, Draxler forced a good save from Zoet. However, Caligiuri picked up the rebound and crossed for Kruse to head the ball in. Guardado could have pulled one back for PSV on 66 minutes, but his shot flew high over the bar. Wolfsburg continued to dominate, though, and looked perpetually dangerous on the counter attack. Kruse nearly made it 3-0 six minutes from time after Vieirinha broke away to whip in a cross. PSV had a chance to get one back in stoppage time after Benaglio fouled Locadia, but the Swiss keeper saved the resulting penalty."

Reigning Dutch champions PSV have not won any of their last 14 away matches against Bundesliga sides in Europe, a sequence stretching back to 1977. None of their current squad was born when PSV beat Eintracht Braunschweig in the UEFA Cup third round in the 1977/78 season. For both Wolfsburg and Eindhoven, this is a chance to bounce back from defeats last time out when the Germans crashed 2-1 at United while Eindhoven went down 3-2 in Moscow three weeks ago. Having opened their European campaign with a 1-0 win over CSKA at the start of September, Wolfsburg warmed up for the visit of the Dutch champions with a 4-2 German league win over Hoffenheim. They got back to winning ways after four games without a victory, including the 5-1 Bundesliga mauling at Bayern Munich in late September. ""That was a step in the right direction,"" said Wolfsburg coach Dieter Hecking after the Hoffenheim win. ""Now we need a similarly good performance on Wednesday against PSV, so that we can take three points."" Against Hoffenheim, Germany striker Max Kruse scored the first hat-trick of his career -- and says there is more to come. ""It's a nice feeling, but this is just the beginning,"" said the Wolfsburg striker, who scored his first goal after just 43 seconds. Having beaten Manchester United 2-1 in Eindhoven before losing in Moscow, Phillip Cocu-coached PSV are chasing a rare away win in Europe after losing eight of their last ten continental away matches. PSV have only lost twice this season, but both defeats were also away. Right back Santiago Arias sits out the Wolfsburg game as he serves a one-game ban after being shown a second yellow card against Moscow. Coco was far from impressed with his side's 1-1 draw with SBV Excelsior on Saturday after throwing away a 1-0 lead at home. Davy Proepper's goal was cancelled out by Nigel Hasselbaink's 93rd-minute equaliser for Excelsior and the draw kept Eindhoven third in the Dutch league table. ""I can't possibly be satisfied with our display. We've forgotten to put the game to bed,"" said Coco. ""We were not efficient enough, which should not happen too often."""

VW's new chief executive Matthias Mueller has said all of the company's investments will be re-appraised in the wake of the global scandal and this is the first sign of the football club tightening their belts.

VW's new CEO Matthias Mueller has said his company will review their finances thoroughly to see where they can save cash -- which includes delving into their huge sponsorship of Wolfsburg. The carmakers invest an estimated 100 million euros into the football club per season, but Allofs refuses to worry about the durability of the sponsorship of his Champions League team. ""We have confidence in the strength of the leadership. Besides, many things speak for the engagement of Volkswagen at VfL,"" Allofs told SID, an AFP subsidiary. On Tuesday, Volkswagen boss Mueller told the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung that they will ""turn every stone and inspect it"" to see where they can save cash. ""Everything which isn't absolutely necessary will be cancelled or written off,"" he added. ""I want to be quite frank: this will not happen without pain."" Volkswagen have sponsored Wolfsburg since 1945 and Allofs insists it must be business as usual on the pitch for the Champions League team. ""At the moment, there are no consequences for VfL.

The win lifts Moenchengladbach four points above the relegation zone as they win their third straight league match under caretaker coach Andre Schubert. At the Olympic stadium in the capital, Hertha Berlin began brightly against Hamburg where Ivorian striker Salomon Kalou struck his third goal of the season to put the hosts 1-0 up after 17 minutes. The 30-year-old, former Chelsea and Lille marksman has been a key addition since joining Pal Dardai's side in 2014 and helped the club avoid relegation in his first season. Bosnian international Vedad Ibisevic guaranteed maximum points for Hertha when he scored twice in two second-half minutes to make it 3-0 with 11 minutes remaining as the 1999-2000 Champions League qualifiers climbed to fourth spot. Hoffenheim were the only other team to score in the opening 45 minutes of Bundesliga action as they rode a 33rd minute penalty into the break, against Stuttgart, thanks to German international winger Kevin Volland. Second-from-bottom Stuttgart, at the start of the day, got back on level terms with 26 minutes to play thanks to 22-year-old Czech Republic striker Jan Kliment before Volland grabbed his second of the match to put the hosts into a 2-1 lead. However with time running out, Stuttgart snatched a valuable point when Pirmin Schwegler scored in the 90th minute in a match that finished 2-2 but nonetheless left the visitors bottom of the league on goal-difference. Hannover won their first match of the season as they defeated Werder Bremen 1-0 thanks to the only goal of the match on 56 minutes through French-born Senegalese international Salif Sane. Finally, Ingolstadt defeated Eintrach Frankfurt 2-0 with late goals from Pascal Gross and Stefan Lex to take possession of fifth spot in their first season back in the Bundesliga. The match of the weekend, takes place at the Allianz Arena on Sunday, when three-time defending champions Bayern Munich put their four point lead at the top, on the line against Borussia Dortmund, in a battle of unbeaten sides.

Wolfsburg's early goal was cancelled out as Juan Mata scored a penalty , then set up Chris Smalling's goal as United came from behind to deny the battling Germans a win in Group B. But beyond that defeat, Wolfsburg centre-back Dante said the uncertain future facing many of their fans, who work on the production line at Volkswagen's plant in the northern German city, was on his mind. ""I hope that all the people keep their jobs,"" said the Brazilian in Manchester. Wolfsburg's director of sport Klaus Allofs has said the club's future appears to be secure -- for now -- despite the majority of their cash coming from Volkswagen's coffers. But he added it was impossible to ignore the air of uncertainty hanging over the city of Wolfsburg, where the majority of the workers also live. The giant Volkswagen plant is just a few hundred metres from the football stadium. ""I hope a solution will be found,"" said Allofs. ""It's not something which can just pass us by."" Volkswagen, the world's biggest carmaker by sales, has admitted up to 11 million diesel cars worldwide are fitted with devices that can switch on pollution controls when they detect the car is undergoing testing. Since the revelations of the scam broke earlier this month, shares in VW have nose dived. Angela Merkel's German government has given VW until next Wednesday to explain how it will resolve the scandal. The company is bracing itself for a wave of lawsuits from around the world, which could have a knock-on effect for Wolfsburg fans on the Volkswagen production line. Meanwhile, Dante exchanged words with his former Bayern Munich team-mate Bastian Schweinsteiger after the final whistle in Manchester. The Selecao centre-back said he was pleased to see Germany's captain enjoying his time at Old Trafford since quitting Munich in July after 14 years with Bayern. ""We write (text messages) to each other and will always remain friends,"" said Dante. ""It's great to hear that he is very, very happy at United."" Schweinsteiger was involved in both goals and received a standing ovation from the Old Trafford crowd when he was substituted. But Wolfsburg left Manchester under a cloud of disappointment as they failed to back up their opening Champions League win 1-0 at home to CSKA Moscow earlier this month. ""We were punished terribly for any mistakes,"" grumbled coach Dieter Hecking. Wolfsburg's Christian Traesch said the result ""left a bad feeling"" as he got on the team bus. His team are now preparing to face Borussia Moenchengladbach away on Saturday, who lost 2-1 at home to Manchester City in the Champions League on Wednesday."
143,29/09/2015,18:17,Van Gaal hints at delaying 'paradise' for United,Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal has hinted he could stay on at Old Trafford beyond his current contract.,"The Dutchman has previously stated that he will retire from football when his deal with United expires in 2017 to spend more time with his wife Truus at their villa in Portugal. However, when the 64-year-old was asked on the eve of United's Champions League Group B clash with Wolfsburg whether he would walk away he was not so definitive. ""Normally I shall leave after next year but what is normal in our football world?"" Van Gaal said. ""You never know so I cannot answer that question. ""I promised my wife to go with her to our paradise so it shall be very hard for me to deny that promise. ""I was 55 and I go to Bayern Munich and next year I am 65 and say I stay a year longer, it shall be very hard to my wife."" Van Gaal is set to be without defender Antonio Valencia and midfield duo Michael Carrick and Ander Herrera after the trio missed training ahead of the match with knocks. Defender Marcos Rojo is still struggling with a hamstring injury while left-back Luke Shaw is a long-term absentee with a broken leg. The United manager believes that winning the European Cup is a ""realistic"" target during his managerial tenure at United, who lost their Group B opener against PSV Eindhoven a fortnight ago. ""I hope so. It is realistic. Why? Because I did it everywhere,"" Van Gaal added. ""Reaching the final is an aim and winning the final is a little bit luck, I think so it is not only quality, it is also luck and I think Manchester United knows and remembers that fantastically when they win the Champions League in 1999. ""I saw at that time the people of Bayern Munich going downstairs and then they scored in the last minute and then in extra time they scored. ""You can say that is quality but when you see the match you know it is not like that. You need also luck. When you come in the final, it is a fantastic result but in the media it is nothing because second is not the best. That's the only thing that counts. ""For me as a manager, when you reach the final, you have done fantastically and win the final, of course, all the honours is going to your team and yourself but I know better."" United currently sit at the top of the Premier League table and Van Gaal believes he can regularly see the improvement and development of his players. ""We have made progressions in maturity of the team and the balance of the team. We are still improving and I can see that every week,"" Van Gaal said. ""We have improved when we have to compare with the team of last year, and we need still time to improve because we have to improve to win the championship of the Premier League or a competition like the Champions League. ""I think in the Champions League you need to win all your home matches otherwise it shall be very difficult."""
144,29/09/2015,01:50,Man United eager to keep Wolves from the door,"Back on top of the Premier League, Manchester United will attempt to get their Champions League campaign off the ground when they welcome Wolfsburg to Old Trafford on Wednesday.","Domestically, United made a slow start to the season, but the deadline-day arrival of Anthony Martial appears to have inspired Louis van Gaal's side, who have recorded four consecutive three-goal victories against Liverpool, Southampton, Ipswich Town, in the League Cup, and Sunderland. Saturday's 3-0 win over Sunderland took United to the top of the league for the first time since 2013, but having begun the Champions League with a 2-1 defeat at PSV Eindhoven -- a game marred by Luke Shaw's gruesome double leg break -- they are under increased pressure to win their first home game. ""I think in the Champions League you need to win all your home matches, otherwise it shall be very difficult,"" says Van Gaal. ""We have improved when we have to compare with the team of last year, and we need still time to improve because we have to improve to win the Premier League or the Champions League."" Martial, 19, has taken to life in English football more quickly than anyone could have anticipated, scoring four goals in his first five games, and his defence-stretching pace has also benefited the three players playing behind him. Wayne Rooney and Memphis Depay scored their first league goals of the season against Sunderland -- the former ending an 11-game drought -- while Juan Mata has come into his own on the right flank, producing three goals and three assists in his last seven outings. But Michael Carrick and Marcos Rojo will not face Wolfsburg due to injury, while Antonio Valencia and Ander Herrera are doubts. It leaves Van Gaal facing a dilemma at full-back, with Matteo Darmian having switched from right-back to left-back against Sunderland and Valencia having filled in on the right side of the defence. Despite United's recent domestic flowering, they will be aware of the potential cost of failure against Wolfsburg. The last time United failed to win either of their first two group games was in 2011-12, when a 1-1 draw at Benfica was followed by an untidy 3-3 draw at home to Basel. Two and a half months later, they were out. Wolfsburg go into the game beneath a cloud of exhaust fumes emanating from the scandal surrounding longstanding benefactor Volkswagen, the German car giant, which has admitted that 11 million of its diesel cars have passed pollution tests using fraudulent means. While sports director Klaus Allofs is adamant the scandal will have no effect on the club, it has coincided with a sudden downturn in the on-field fortunes of last season's German Cup winners and Bundesliga runners-up. Unbeaten in their first five league games, Wolfsburg found themselves playing the unwitting stooges to Robert Lewandowski's record-breaking five-goal haul in a 5-1 win for Bayern Munich a week ago and then drew 1-1 at home to bottom club Hannover at the weekend. Centre-back Dante has admitted the defeat at Bayern is ""not something you get over quickly"". Wolfsburg are slowly adapting to life without Kevin De Bruyne, Germany's Footballer of the Year last season, and new signing Julian Draxler -- signed to replace the Belgium international, who joined Chelsea -- is still bedding in. The Wolves are also nursing a number of injuries, with Robin Knoche, Vierinha and Koen Casteels all out and Luiz Gustavo a doubt after aggravating a knee problem during the mauling by Bayern. But they hold the upper hand over United ahead of Wednesday's encounter, having opened their Group B campaign with a 1-0 home win over CSKA Moscow. ""United are a top side,"" forward Andre Schuerrle told German football magazine Kicker. ""We are a bit in the underdog role and we'll have to give our all. Then we have a chance."""
145,27/09/2015,16:45,No indication VW scandal will affect Wolfsburg - Allofs,"Wolfsburg official Klaus Allofs says the Bundesliga club has seen no indication their finances could suffer, even though main sponsors Volkswagen face receiving huge fines from the pollution test cheating scandal.","German Cup winners Wolfsburg, who finished second in the league to Bayern Munich least season, are owned by the carmaker and German media estimate Volkswagen invest 100 million euros ($111.9m) into club coffers each season. Volkswagen is braced for fines of up to $18 billion in the United States alone and faces the biggest challenge in it's 78-year history. The carmakers sparked global outrage by admitting 11 million of its diesel cars worldwide are fitted with so-called defeat devices that activate pollution controls during tests, but covertly turn them off when the car is on the road. The VfL Wolfsburg club was formed in 1945 out of a multi-sports club for Volkswagen workers at the city's production plant. Allofs says the emotional link between the car manufacturer and the football team has always been strong and he does not expect their finances to be cut, even if Volkswagen are forced to tighten their belts. ""I can't say anything concrete about the operations at Volkswagen, but in general the signals are clear: as things stand now, nothing will change for VfL,"" Allofs, Wolfsburg's director of sport, told Die Welt on Sunday. ""We don't get direct hand-outs from Volkswagen, but a strategic element. ""We're neither Number One on VW's priority list, nor last, and the financial size of their investment, in terms of the whole VW group, is certainly not small. ""On the other hand, their emotional involvement (in the club) is huge, which is why I am not worried. ""That's not a calming tactic, but what I firmly believe."" Wolfsburg face challenges of their own on the pitch with just one point in their last two league games before travelling to Manchester United in the Champions League on Wednesday. They drew 1-1 with bottom side Hanover on Saturday, which left them fourth in the league, having been routed 5-1 at Bayern last Tuesday when Robert Lewandowski scored five goals in just under nine second-half minutes. The majority of those living in the city are both Wolfsburg fans and Volkswagen employees and Allofs admitted the club's supporters face uncertain times. ""Volkswagen's decision to invest in amateur and professional football, not only in Wolfsburg, was strategic, not personal,"" he said. ""It's important that we recognise that people in the area are worried, which is understandable. ""This is a huge challenge, which those responsible in the corporation now face."""
146,26/09/2015,05:06,Wolfsburg braces for cuts as pollution scandal engulfs VW,What does the massive pollution test cheating scandal engulfing Volkswagen have to do with a football club?,"A great deal, if the team is Wolfsburg. As the carmaker braces for fines of up to $18 billion in the United States alone for the scam, there are fears the club based in the eponymous northern German city where Volkswagen is headquartered may see its financial lifeline dry up. After all, the club is 100 percent owned by the carmaker, which has also been its main sponsor since the 1950s. VW has always been discreet about its investments in the club, but German media estimate that it injects about 100 million euros a year for the team to stay on the top end of the Bundesliga chart, as well as for the VW logo to be carried prominently on the green and white jerseys. And no man is a bigger fan of the team than Martin Winterkorn, whose appointment as chief executive of Volkswagen in 2007 resulted in a rise in sports spending. But Winterkorn was forced to quit at the height of the VW scandal on Wednesday, to the dismay of the Wolves. Coincidence or stress? On the eve of Winterkorn's departure, Wolfsburg was thrashed 5-1 by league champions Bayern Munich. An avid goalkeeper in his youth, Winterkorn has been a regular spectator at Wolfsburg games, wearing the club's scarf around his neck. When it comes to football, the 68-year-old was ""known for being capable of taking decisions that are not always rational"" in terms of sponsoring, said Christoph Breuer, a economist specialising in sports at the University of Cologne. Winterkorn's successor, Matthias Mueller, is also known to be a football buff, having himself once dreamt of going pro. Nevertheless, he is ""better known for his affinity to automobile sports,"" said Breuer. And the financial pressure weighing on Volkswagen from the growing tangle of legal woes could lead to ""calls for a cost-cutting programme"" at the carmaker, said the expert. The question over what Winterkorn brought to the team financially had already been raised earlier this year, during an ugly leadership feud with his former mentor at VW, Ferdinand Piech, the group's patriarch. Then, Germany's influential Bild newspaper said that Volkswagen could slash its sponsorship to Wolfsburg by 30 million euros a year if Winterkorn were to be toppled. A sum of that scale could crimp the capabilities of the 2009 German champions to woo top flight players. The club this year paid 32 million euros ($36 million, 24 million pounds) to bring Andre Schuerrle from Chelsea back to home turf, and another 35 million euros to Schalke 04 for Julian Draxler. Volkswagen's investment is not pure generosity in football-mad Germany. It also aims to ""make the city more attractive"" to its employees and to convince them to work at the headquarters rather than in Berlin, about 200 kilometres away, or in Munich. ""Wolfsburg will not disappear from the football map, but it may only dwindle in the middle of the league table,"" said Breuer. The club itself is putting on a brave face, with its sporting director Klaus Allofs insisting that the scandal will have ""no immediate impact"". Concerns are not limited to Wolfsburg, but also other clubs across several leagues. The Volkswagen group and its subsidiaries are sponsors of 17 professional clubs on the top and second leagues. Its premium carbrand Audi, for instance, is a shareholder of both Bayern Munich and FC Ingolstadt. There are therefore concerns that the scandal could spell ""the end of expansion in football"" by Volkswagen, said the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung daily. Others were less alarmist, noting that as part of damage control to its reputation, Volkswagen can ill afford to pull its sponsorship of these clubs. ""Volkswagen has a lot to do to improve its image"" and regain the public's confidence, said Sascha Gommel, an analyst at Commerzbank. Cutting spending on Wolfsburg or other clubs could prove counterproductive, he said. The analyst believes that Volkswagen has the financial muscle to settle the fines."

""For Luiz Gustavo, it could be tight, even for the match against Manchester,"" admitted Wolfsburg coach Dieter Hecking. The 28-year-old has been suffering from a knee irritation for some time and jarred the joint in a clash with Bayern's Arturo Vidal. Wolfsburg are second in Group B behind leaders PSV Eindhoven after their 1-0 win over CSKA Moscow, while United are third after their 2-1 defeat at the Dutch champions in the opening round of matches."
148,22/09/2015,22:03,Lewandowski hits five to write Bundesliga history,Robert Lewandowski wrote Bundesliga history on Tuesday and sent records tumbling by scoring five goals in just nine minutes in Bayern Munich's 5-1 romp at home to Wolfsburg.,"Bayern were 1-0 down at the break thanks to a goal by Wolfsburg winger Daniel Caligiuri when coach Pep Guardiola opted to swap midfielder Thiago Alcantara for Lewandowski. It proved to be an inspired move which saw Bayern go top of the table from Borussia Dortmund who are at Hoffenheim on Wednesday. <div class=""vine-container""><iframe frameborder=""0"" height=""600"" src=""https://vine.co/v/ePjtYqetBia/embed/simple"" width=""600""></iframe><script src=""https://platform.vine.co/static/scripts/embed.js""></script></div><script src=""https://platform.vine.co/static/scripts/embed.js""></script> The Poland striker scored just six minutes later to start his record-breaking haul as he demolished the Wolfsburg defence in a dazzling display. It was his best haul since scoring all four for ex-club Borussia Dortmund in their 4-1 win over Real Madrid in the 2013 Champions League semi-final. The 27-year-old set the record for the fastest hat-trick, as he needed just three minutes, 19 seconds to hit his first three goals. His five minutes, 42 seconds for the fourth goal was also a Bundesliga record, as was his nine minutes for the fifth. It was the first time five goals have been scored in the Bundesliga since Michael Toennies in August 1991 in a 6-2 win for Duisburg against Karlsruhe. His haul was the first time a player has come off the bench to score five goals in a Bundesliga game. Lewandowski fell just short of matching the record goal-haul for a single Bundesliga match of six achieved by Cologne's Dieter Mueller in their 7-2 win over Werder Bremen in August 1977. A superb goal from right winger Caligiuri gave Wolfsburg the lead on 26 minutes when he drilled his shot inside the near post and past Germany goalkeeper Manuel Neuer after cutting in from the wing. Bayern were dealt an almighty scare and were only saved by the post on 39 minutes. Neuer left his area, but misjudged a clearance near the halfway line and France midfielder Joshua Guilavogui launched a 50 metre shot at the empty goal, but Munich's blushes were spared as it span harmlessly off the left post. The game then changed in dramatic fashion when Lewandowski came off the bench and scored his first when he stabbed the ball home on 51 minutes. The second followed just seconds later when Xabi Alonso, who looked suspiciously offside, headed forward and Lewandowski buried his shot inside the left post with a superb shot. He claimed his hat-trick on 55 minutes when his shot gave Wolfsburg goalkeeper Diego Benaglio no chance before he saved the best two goals until last. On 57 minutes, Lewandowski converted Douglas Costa's cross with a volley at point-blank range, then produced a superb turning volley to claim his fifth on 60 minutes and came within a whisker of his sixth just moments later. It was little surprise that he was named man-of-the-match."

""We need to focus on ourselves. Bayern usually have 70 percent of the ball at home, if we can get 40 or 45 percent, that'll be good, and we can keep them away from our goal."" Wolfsburg have won the last two meetings between the teams -- a 4-1 league trouncing of Bayern in January was followed by a penalty shoot-out victory in August as Wolves lifted the German Super Cup, also at home. Bayern, who have never lost to Wolfsburg in Munich, are second, on goal-difference behind Borussia Dortmund in the table, with their visitors just behind in third. Hecking admits he is no fan of Bayern's Allianz Arena -- ""I prefer other stadiums"" -- but offered a good reason why away teams are usually awarded few penalties at the home of the defending champions. ""That's down to the fact that Bayern normally gets in the opponents' penalty box at least 20 times, while the away team are usually only in their box once or twice,"" he added. Hecking said he regretted his public criticism of Wolfsburg's Bas Dost, who he described as behaving like 'someone took his toys' after being substituted at half-time of their Champions League win over CSKA Moscow last Tuesday. The Dutch striker bounced back from the harsh criticism after coming off the bench to seal a 2-0 win over Hertha Berlin on Saturday. ""I have been working openly with Bas Dost for two-and-a-half years, perhaps I shouldn't have make things public,"" admitted Hecking. Dost is battling with ex-Arsenal forward Nicklas Bendtner for the striker berth. Coach Pep Guardiola will welcome back Poland star Robert Lewandowski after the striker missed Saturday's 3-0 win at Darmstadt, having suffered a minor injury, and he trained on Sunday. But Bayern were giving out mixed messages about the importance of the Wolfsburg clash as they also host Bundesliga leaders Dortmund in a fortnight. ""It's extremely important, but it's also nothing special,"" said Bayern's director of sport Matthias Sammer, while centre-back Jerome Boateng said the defending champions had given no thoughts to revenge. Guardiola rested Philipp Lahm, Xabi Alonso, Thiago Alcantara and Thomas Mueller from the starting side in Darmstadt to keep plenty in reserve for Wolfsburg. ""We will decide the game,"" insisted Boateng. ""There were only a few times after the 4-1 win when they played better, but we always did,"" said Boateng. Wolves' Brazil international Luiz Gustavo and Dante will be returning to the club where they won the 2013 treble of Champions League, Bundesliga and German Cup titles."

Bayern expect to have star striker Robert Lewandowski back after the Poland striker returned to training on Sunday having shaken off an ankle injury which forced him to sit out the 3-0 win at Darmstadt the previous day. Bayern coach Pep Guardiola took the precaution of giving Germany forward Thomas Mueller only the last 22 minutes in Darmstadt. Between them, Lewandowski and Mueller have scored nine goals in five league games this season. Wolfsburg's Dutch striker Bas Dost will need to improve his attitude to face Bayern, despite a match-winning performance off the bench in the 2-0 victory against Hertha Berlin, after falling offside with coach Dieter Hecking. Dost gave Wolfsburg the lead within five minutes of coming off the bench at home to Hertha, but has been reprimanded by Hecking for sulking in training having been substituted in the mid-week Champions League win over Moscow. The Dutchman was behaving ""as if someone had taken away his toys, (that) will not do"", according to Hecking whose side are third in the table. ""That's being selfish and we don't need that. If he thinks that is the way he wants to go, then perhaps he is in the wrong place here in Wolfsburg."" Ex-Arsenal forward Nicklas Bendtner, who started against Hertha, is set to keep his place at the Allianz Arena. Following Lucien Favre's resignation as head coach on Sunday, bottom side Borussia Moenchengladbach host Augsburg on Wednesday looking for their first point of the season after five straight defeats. Despite steering Gladbach to third and Champions League qualification last season, the 57-year-old said in a statement that he feels he is no longer the man for the job. Saturday's 1-0 derby defeat at Cologne was the final straw having lost 3-0 at Seville last Tuesday in the Champions League. At the other end of the table, Bundesliga leaders Borussia Dortmund are at Hoffenheim on Wednesday hunting their 12th straight victory and sixth Bundesliga win as they come into the mid-week games top of the table on goal difference from Bayern. Gabon winger Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang converted a late penalty in Dortmund's 3-0 win over Bayer Leverkusen on Sunday to leave him with six goals in five games to join Mueller as the league's joint top-scorer.

Lewandowski has scored three goals in four league games this season alongside Germany forward Thomas Mueller, who has scored eight goals in all competitions, including six in five league games. Lewandowski scored 17 goals in 31 league games last season to finish as the joint second highest goalscorer in the Bundesliga behind Eintracht Frankfurt's Alexander Meier. Last season's Cup winners Wolfsburg have already beaten champions Bayern this season after winning the German Super Cup on penalties in August."

""I'm pleased for the team that he scored two goals, but the way he has walked around for the last three days, as if someone had taken away his toys, will not do,"" fumed Hecking when asked about Dost's goals. ""That's being selfish and we don't need that. ""If he thinks that is the way he wants to go, then perhaps he is in the wrong place here in Wolfsburg."" Dutch striker Dost came off the bench for former Arsenal forward Nicklas Bendtner against Hertha on 71 minutes, giving Wolfsburg the lead just five minutes later before netting a penalty shortly before the final whistle. But Hecking was far from impressed when Dost reacted badly to being substituted for Bendtner early in the second half of their 1-0 Champions League win over CSKA Moscow last Tuesday. As punishment, Dost started against Hertha on the bench, despite scoring 16 goals in 21 league games last season. Hecking has no intention of smoothing things over with Dost, despite the looming trip to champions Bayern, who have won five out of five in the Bundesliga this season. ""I'll let him have three days now in silence -- just as he has done with the team,"" said Hecking, who coached Wolfsburg to second in the Bundesliga last season before winning the German Cup."

Capacity for European matches is 26,500 and the gate figure was boosted because Wolfsburg had invited 1,200 refugees to watch the match for free. ""I didn't hear the Champions League anthem before the game, because I was busy looking where our fans were,"" fumed Allofs. ""The team doesn't deserve that and we will do everything in our power to change it."" Allofs gave a simple answer when asked where the problem lay, ""in a city of 125,000 inhabitants"", but while the German Cup holders are used to capacity crowds in domestic matches, the visit of CSKA appeared to hold less appeal. A sell-out 30,000 crowd watched their 3-0 Bundesliga win over Shalke on a Friday night a fortnight ago with the capacity set higher for German league matches. There is, however, a very practical explanation to the low crowd. The local Volkswagen car plant is just 500m from the stadium, but the factory's late shift started at 2200 local time (2000 GMT) and the game was due to finish soon after. In 2009, Volkswagen, who sponsor Wolfsburg, changed the shift times so their fans could see their team play in the Champions League.

Wolfsburg face United away in their next Champions League fixture on September 30 as Louis van Gaal's side lost 2-1 at PSV Eindhoven on Tuesday to leave the Dutch champions top of the group. The win over Moscow left Wolfsburg second in the table to Eindhoven on goal difference. This was an impressive display from Draxler, who ran the German's midfield on only his second appearance for Wolfsburg. The 21-year-old opened the scoring on 40 minutes as he proved why Wolves paid Schalke 36 million euros (US40.58 million) for his services. Playing in the attacking midfield role vacated by Kevin de Bruyne's record transfer to Manchester City, Draxler finished off the move he started. After his pass found Max Kruse in space on the right wing, Draxler powered his header at Moscow goalkeeper Igor Akinfeev, but was first to react and stabbed home the rebound. It was no more than the hosts deserved after right winger Daniel Caligiuri had wasted a superb chance just moments before when he took too long with his shot having got in behind the defence. Russian league leaders Moscow had little to offer and Nigeria forward Ahmed Musa was their biggest threat up front, while Serbia left winger Zoran Tosic forced Wolfsburg goalkeeper Diego Benaglio into a diving save with 20 minutes to go. Wolfsburg needed a second goal to make sure of the three points, but the Moscow defence kept frustrating the German Cup winners. Caligiuri had a late chance charged down while his replacement France international Josuha Guilavogui failed to connect a cross with the goal at his mercy. The hosts deserved their win with 21 shots on goal compared to Moscow's eight."
157,14/09/2015,02:15,History repeats as Wolfsburg open against CSKA,"History repeats itself on Tuesday when Wolfsburg return to the Champions League, against CSKA Moscow, following a six-year absence with new signings Julian Draxler and Dante have still struggling to settle.","Wolfsburg kick off only their second Champions League campaign against exactly the same opponents as in 2009 when they beat CSKA 3-1 at the Volkswagen Arena and Brazil striker Grafite claimed a hat-trick. Six years on, Swiss goalkeeper Diego Benaglio is set to be the only survivor to start on Tuesday from the Wolfsburg side which finished third in their group behind Manchester United and CSKA. Once again Wolfsburg face CSKA and United in this season's group stages, with Dutch side PSV Eindhoven joining them in group B, and the Germans face Louis Van Gaal's United away at the end of the month. Having sold playmaker Kevin De Bruyne to Manchester City for a reported record fee of £54 million ($83.6 million, 74 million euros) last month, Wolfsburg signed Germany international Draxler from Schalke to fill the Belgian's attacking midfield role. Wolfsburg have also recruited veteran Brazil centre-back Dante from Bayern Munich, after a frustrating start to the season on the Bavarians' bench, to bolster their defence. But neither new signing impressed in Saturday's goalless draw at newly-promoted Ingolstadt in a below-par team performance. ""There's no point getting carried away, they have only played twice here. They fact that they both started against Ingolstadt shows we have a lot of trust in them,"" said Wolfsburg coach Dieter Hecking. ""I think given that Dante hasn't played much football recently, he played well, but needs more time."" CSKA will provide a stern test for Hecking's Wolfsburg, who are third in the Bundesliga behind leaders Borussia Dortmund and Bayern. The Russian Premier League leaders started their domestic campaign with a club record seven consecutive victories prior to Saturday's 2-2 draw at home to Zenit St Petersburg. Their sole defeat was the 2-1 loss to Sporting Lisbon in the first leg of their play-off tie before they qualified for the Champions League group stages for the third time in succession with a 3-1 win in the return. In each of the past two seasons, they have failed to get out of their group and finished bottom both in 2013 and last term. CSKA have lost all four of their previous visits to Germany, the last of which was a 3-0 defeat at Bayern Munich in December 2014. Wolfsburg's attack can take some heart from the fact CSKA goalkeeper Igor Akinfeev has conceded a goal in each of his last 31 Champions League appearances, qualifying included. His last clean sheet in the competition came when CSKA earned a goalless draw at Arsenal back in November 2006."
158,02/09/2015,16:54,"Schalke bosses lament, defend Draxler's sale","Schalke coach Andre Breitenreiter has bitterly lamented the sale of Germany international Julian Draxler to rivals Wolfsburg, while sports director Horst Heldt has defended the club's record transfer.","The Royal Blues sold their star midfielder to Wolfsburg on Monday for a reported 35 million euros ($39.3m), plus five million in bonuses, as the 21-year-old left the club he joined in 2001 as a child. He played 170 matches for Schalke and scored 30 goals. ""Jule arrived with us for nothing, we educated him and now we've sold him for 40 million,"" Heldt told SID, an AFP subsidiary. ""We have secured the most expensive transfer in the club's history."" But Heldt admits that while Schalke are now flushed with cash, they will be poorer on the pitch. ""There is a loss of quality, as we know,"" Heldt added. The Draxler transfer will help reduce Schalke's debt of 163.9 million euros up until the end of 2014. Wolfsburg bought Draxler to replace Belgian attacking midfielder Kevin de Bruyne, who left for Manchester City, but Breitenreiter regrets selling their best player -- who played against Wolfsburg in Schalke's 3-0 away defeat last Friday. ""In Julian, we have lost our best player, the quality in the squad has dropped,"" fumed Breitenreiter. ""Until last weekend, I thought he was staying. ""If I had known on Thursday that he's going, he wouldn't have played against Wolfsburg on Friday. ""The club and the fans need to ask themselves why Julian left. ""We still have a number of talented players, but we have to be careful."" Breitenreiter, who took charge at the start of the season, also rued the club's decision to drive advertising lorries through Gelsenkirchen and neighbouring Dortmund when Draxler signed a five-year extension in 2013. Alongside the caption ""Julian Draxler: With pride and passion until 2018"" was a giant image of the player in a Schalke strip. ""The club itself raised the hype around him and built him up,"" added Breitenreiter. ""I wouldn't have allowed the lorries to drive around back then."""
159,01/09/2015,15:59,"Wolfsburg's Draxler will ""carry Schalke in heart""","Germany international Julian Draxler admitted he will ""always carry Schalke 04"" in his heart, despite being unveiled as Wolfsburg's replacement for Kevin de Bruyne on Tuesday, alongside Brazil defender Dante.","Having sold De Bruyne to Manchester City on Sunday for a reported record fee of £54 million ($83.6m, 74m euros), Wolfsburg wasted no time by signing centre-back Dante from Bayern Munich and Draxler from Schalke on Monday. Draxler, 21, who like De Bruyne is an attacking midfielder, cost Wolfsburg a reported 35 million euros, while they paid around four million euros for the 31-year-old Dante. After 14 years with Gelsenkirchen's Schalke, Draxler said he needed a change, but admitted it was hard to get used to the green of Wolfsburg after the Royal Blue of Schalke. ""I'll always wear Schalke in my heart,"" he told a press conference on Tuesday. ""The situation is still very unusual. When I walk through the dressing room, everything here is green and not blue, but I needed a change of air."" Schalke fans reacted angrily to his departure. ""Julian is a Schalke boy and should have stayed so! That's why it is all the sadder that he's left,"" fumed one typically disgruntled Schalke fan in German daily Bild. Draxler has not been called into the Germany squad for Friday's key Euro 2016 qualifier against Poland in Frankfurt with Joachim Loew's side second in Group D behind the visitors. After two stagnant years in Schalke, Draxler will make the step up to become the world-class attacking midfielder Wolfsburg need to fulfill their European ambitions as they prepare for their first Champions League campaign since 2009. But Wolfsburg coach Dieter Hecking warned reporters not to compare Draxler to De Bruyne. ""Don't make the mistake of comparing De Bruyne to Draxler, he is a very different type of player,"" said Hecking in an attempt to take some of the expectations off their new signing. Germany coach Joachim Loew backed Draxler's move to Wolfsburg. ""My expectation is that he will play to his class and skills and will be more consisent,"" said the Germany boss. Having won three back-to-back Bundesliga titles and been part of Bayern's treble-winning team in 2013, Brazil's Dante arrives in Wolfsburg with a string of experience and eager to link up with fellow Selecao internationals Luiz Gustavo and Naldo. He admits he was ""sad"" to leave Bayern, but Hecking said he hopes Dante's experience will rub off on his new team-mates. ""We're hoping we can annoy Bayern again with Dante in our team,"" said Hecking, while director of sport Klaus Allofs added: ""He has not only the quality, but also the mentality that you need to succeed."""

Draxler spent 14 years at Schalke and Gelsenkirchen has lost one of its favourite sons. The deal is reported to cost Wolfsburg around 35 million euros ($39.19m) and after Dante cost around four million, Wolfsburg have already spent a good slice of the 79.8m euros they have supposedly received for the De Bruyne transfer. ""Julian has been on our wish list and after the Kevin de Bruyne transfer, we could make it possible,"" said Wolfsburg's director of sport Klaus Allofs. ""We're convinced Julian will develop further with us."" Draxler has won 15 caps for Germany and was a non-playing member of the squad which won the 2014 World Cup in Brazil. He discussed the transfer with national coach Joachim Loew before signing for Wolfsburg. ""Wolfsburg is a new challenge for me and I want to keep playing at the top level,"" said Draxler, who was lured to Wolfsburg by the chance to play Champions League football this season with Schalke in the Europa League. ""I am looking forward to playing in the Champions League with Wolfsburg and want to play for the title here in the coming years,"" said Draxler."
161,31/08/2015,16:27,Wolfsburg sign Belgian teenager from Spurs,VfL Wolfsburg have signed 17-year-old Belgian attacking midfielder Ismail Azzaoui from Tottenham Hotspur's youth side on Monday as they begin the process of replacing Kevin De Bruyne.,"Azzaoui has represented Belgium up to under-17 level, but never played in the Premier League for Spurs and Wolfsburg completed the deal, reported to be around one million euros, less than 24 after selling De Bruyne to Manchester City. Azzaoui has made 26 appearances for Belgium's junior sides and scored eight goals. ""We've been following Azzaoui's progress for a long time now,"" said Wolfsburg's director of sport Klaus Allofs on the club's website. ""He's a young player who has the potential to break into our first team in the near future. ""We will get a more precise and complete picture of his current performance level over the next few weeks and will then decide which of our teams he will start playing in."""

""Manchester City are delighted to announce that Kevin De Bruyne has joined the club on a six-year deal,"" City announced on their website, alongside a picture of De Bruyne holding the number 17 shirt. De Bruyne said: ""I want to reach the highest level possible as a player and I think the most important thing is that at the end of the season we can be happy and maybe have some titles. ""I think this is the most important for the club, the players and for the fans of course."" The deal eclipses the £49 million that City paid Liverpool to secure Raheem Sterling's services and smashes the Bundesliga transfer record of 41 million euros, which Liverpool paid Hoffenheim for Brazil forward Roberto Firmino in July. It also represents a three-fold increase on the fee of £18 million that Wolfsburg paid Chelsea to sign De Bruyne in January 2014. ""We are very happy to have added Kevin to our team and I have no doubt that he will be a big success on his return to the Premier League,"" City manager Manuel Pellegrini told the club website. ""It takes a special footballer to improve our squad and I have no doubt that Kevin is certainly one of those -- he has all of the mental, physical, tactical and technical attributes required to fit straight in. ""We like to play attractive, attacking football and bringing in a player like De Bruyne will only aid us as we fight on four fronts."" As well as Sterling and De Bruyne, City have also signed defender Nicolas Otamendi and midfielder Fabian Delph as they look to reclaim the Premier League title lost to Chelsea last season. De Bruyne is expected to line up on the right-hand side of Pellegrini's attack, alongside Sterling and David Silva and in support of lone striker Sergio Aguero. De Bruyne arrived in England via private jet on Saturday, having sat out Wolfsburg's 3-0 win over Schalke on Friday as speculation that he was on the verge of joining City intensified. He was named German Footballer of the Year last season after scoring 16 goals and providing 29 assists as Wolfsburg won the German Cup and finished runners-up to Bayern Munich in the Bundesliga. De Bruyne began his career in his homeland with Genk and contributed to their 2011 Belgian title success before joining Chelsea in 2012. Chelsea loaned him back to Genk and then to Werder Bremen, where he spent the 2012-13 season, playing 34 times and supplying 10 goals and 10 assists. His displays for Bremen created expectations that he was ready to make an impact at Chelsea, but he failed to impress manager Jose Mourinho, who allowed him to leave for Wolfsburg after only nine appearances. He has played 33 times for Belgium, scoring eight goals, and was a member of the side that reached the quarter-finals at last year's World Cup in Brazil."

""I am looking forward to living in Munich and playing for FC Bayern. I want to take the next step in my career and want to help the club to be successful in the next two years,"" said Coman. The teenager boasts the impressive record of having won three league winners medals in his three years as a pro, with Paris Saint-Germain in 2013 and 2014, then last year with Juventus. The fleet-footed youngster, who can play on either wing, has been signed as cover for Bayern's veteran wingers Arjen Robben and Franck Ribery and the German champions have beaten Arsenal and Liverpool in the race to sign him. On the same day Bayern announced Coman's arrival, so Dante left after winning three league titles in Munich for a reported four million euros. Dante has fallen out of favour with Bayern coach Pep Guardiola due to a lack of pace and the Brazilian, whose full name is Dante Bonfim Costa Santos, has found himself on the bench for Bayern's three league games this season. He made his first Bundesliga appearance of the 2015/16 campaign by playing the last 17 minutes of Bayern's 3-0 home win over Bayer Leverkusen on Saturday which has proved to be his farewell. ""Dante simply wanted the chance to play regularly and we didn't want to hinder his wish,"" explained Bayern chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge in a statement. The defender, who has not made the Brazil squad for their September friendlies against Costa Rica and the United States, was a key factor in Bayern winning the 2013 treble of Champions League, Bundesliga and German Cup titles. Having joined Bayern from Borussia Moenchengladbach in July 2012, Dante has won the Bundesliga title three times in succession and lifted the German Cup twice, as well as the Club World Cup and UEFA Super Cup crowns in 2013. ""We want to thank Dante. FC Bayern experienced a very successful time with him including lots of great moments and titles,"" added Rummenigge. ""In addition, we have got to know Dante as a very pleasant and friendly person. We wish him all the best for the future."" Wolfsburg are poised to sell attacking midfield Kevin de Bruyne to Manchester City and the German Cup holders are set to splash out more cash before the transfer window closes in Germany at 1800 local time (1600 GMT) on Monday.

German broadcaster Sport1 showed De Bruyne boarding a private jet at Braunschweig airport, near Wolfsburg, en route to Manchester shortly before 10am local time (0800). On Friday night, Wolfsburg director of sport Klaus Allofs said there were ""only small details"" left to finalise in the transfer. The deal will smash the Bundesliga transfer record of 41 million euros that Liverpool paid Hoffenheim for Brazil striker Roberto Firmino in July. Reports suggest Wolfsburg could pocket up to 80 million euros, with an extra six million in bonuses, for De Bruyne if the attacking midfielder helps City win this season's Premier League title. Germany's footballer of the year for 2014/15 helped Wolfsburg win the German Cup last season and finish second to Bayern Munich in the Bundesliga, as he scored 16 goals and provided 29 assists in all competitions.

In De Bruyne's absence, Dutch striker Bas Dost gave Wolfsburg an early lead by drilling home a 17th-minute cross before Swiss left-back Ricardo Rodriguez converted a penalty just before the hour mark. Centre half Timm Klose then netted Wolfsburg's third goal with 61 minutes gone as his side bounced back with a convincing win compared to last weekend's uninspired 1-1 draw at Cologne. Wolves' director of sport Klaus Allofs expects the on-going De Bruyne transfer saga to be resolved over the weekend. ""It's all about a few small details.

The deal would be a club record for City, surpassing the £49 million they paid for Liverpool's England midfielder Raheem Sterling, while Wolfsburg paid Chelsea just £17 million for De Bruyne in 2014. But after failing to shine in Wolfsburg's season-opening 2-1 league win over Eintracht Frankfurt last Sunday, De Bruyne put in another below-par performance in Wolfsburg's 1-1 draw at Cologne on Saturday in the Bundesliga. Last season's runners-up needed a late Nicklas Bendtner goal to equalise and Allofs, Wolfsburg's director of sport, said the uncertainty about De Bruyne's future has been a distraction for both the player and the team. ""It's true that we are influenced by it, but we can't complain and we have to learn to deal with such disturbances and distractions,"" said Allofs. ""Kevin's performances has corresponded with that of the team, but that's a good sign that he is still part of the side.

Wolves were rewarded for some patient build-up play as new striker Max Kruse fired in a brilliant cross which Perisic headed home at the far post on 13 minutes. They doubled their lead four minutes later after calamitous Frankfurt defending in the area as Kruse poked the ball across the face of goal and Dost buried his shot from close range. Frankfurt fought back with defensive midfielder Stefan Reinartz taking advantage of some sloppy Wolfsburg defending to pull a goal back for the visitors on 19 minutes. It proved to be the end of the scoring, although both sides had second-half chances as Perisic in particular went close. After Bayern kicked off the new season with a 5-0 hammering of Hamburg on Friday night, Borussia Dortmund threw down the gauntlet to the defending champions with a 4-0 drubbing of Borussia Moenchengladbach on Saturday. New signing Douglas Costa was outstanding on Bayern's left wing and slotted the final goal after Thomas Mueller scored twice, while centre-back Medhi Benatia headed the opening goal in an impressive display. However, Dortmund's new coach Thomas Tuchel began his tenure in emphatic style as his side ran riot at home to Gladbach with left-winger Henrikh Mkhitaryan scoring twice as Marco Reus and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang also netted. Earlier, Bayer Leverkusen had warmed up for their Champions League play-off clash at Lazio on Tuesday with a 2-1 comeback win against Hoffenheim. Leverkusen face Lazio away on Tuesday, with the return on August 26, for a place in the Champions League group stage and 19-year-old Julian Brandt came off the bench to score their winner at home to Hoffenheim. Newly-promoted Ingolstadt celebrated their debut in Germany's top flight with a 1-0 win at Mainz as Austria international Lukas Hinterseer scored their second-half winner. Fellow new boys Darmstadt finished their first game in the Bundesliga for 33 years with a 2-2 draw against Hanover as fleet-footed winger Marcel Heller scored twice and the hosts twice hit the crossbar. Schalke picked up their first win under new coach Andre Breitenreiter with a 3-0 victory at Werder Bremen. The hosts conceded an unlucky first-half own goal when Czech defender Theodor Gebre Selassie beat Schalke striker Klaas-Jan Huntelaar to the ball, only for his clearance to loop over Werder goalkeeper Felix Wiedwald and into his own net. Cameroon striker Eric Choupo-Moting converted a pass from his international team-mate Joel Matip on 68 minutes before Huntelaar finished off a superb counter-attack on 85 minutes by 19-year-old substitute Leroy Sane, who had just come on. Meanwhile, Paraguay striker Raul Bobadilla penned a contract extension at Augsburg until 2018 only to be sent off just 45 minutes into the new Bundesliga season on Saturday in his team's 1-0 defeat at home to Hertha Berlin."

176,14/08/2015,14:26,De Bruyne speculation annoys Wolfsburg boss,"Wolfsburg coach Dieter Hecking says he is irritated by constant media speculation on whether Kevin de Bruyne will sign for Manchester City, with the English giants poised to swoop for the star midfielder.","""It's annoying, because the questions are always the same and we can't give a different answer,"" said Hecking, who steered Wolfsburg to the German Cup last season and this year's Super Cup after beating Bayern Munich on penalties two weeks ago. ""I have no desire to answer these questions anymore. This club has made it's position clear."" De Bruyne was named Germany's player of the season in 2014/15 and has been outstanding for Wolfsburg -- who finished second behind Bayern Munich in the Bundesliga last season -- scoring 20 goals and contributing 38 assists in all competitions since signing from Chelsea in January 2014. Wolfsburg start their season on Sunday at home to Eintracht Frankfurt with the hosts being swarmed by UK media reports stating that City have made an offer worth 66 million euros (£46.9m, US$73.35m) for the Belgium midfielder. ""We can't give a reaction to every story from the Guardian or the Daily Mirror or whatever paper there is in Manchester,"" said the 50-year-old Hecking, who recently extended his Wolfsburg contract until 2018. ""I don't really care for that and as the head coach here, I can't give a report every day on the state of things."" Hecking said De Bruyne is unaffected by the speculation. ""He hasn't given much thought to a change of club,"" insisted Hecking. ""I see a Kevin de Bruyne on the training pitch who is focused on the start of the new season and he certainly wants to play well on Sunday."" Hecking also insists the speculation will have no impact on the Wolves when they kick off against Frankfurt. ""It's not like there is a dark cloud over the team, the squad have registered that there is a player who is being watched by the top teams,"" said Hecking. ""He has developed here, but also because the team has worked hard around him."""
177,09/08/2015,13:53,Wolfsburg coach Hecking extends contract,"Dieter Hecking has signed a two-year contract extension with VfL Wolfsburg, last year's Bundesliga runners-up said Sunday.","The new deal ties the 50-year-old down to the Wolves until June 2018. His previous deal was due to run out at the end of this season. ""I've always said I'd like to remain beyond 2016 at Wolfsburg where I feel I have the full confidence of those in charge,"" said Hecking. He joined the club in December 2012 and last year led them to their best finish since winning the Bundesliga in 2009. They also won the German Cup last season and beat champions Bayern Munich in the German Supercup at the beginning of this campaign."
178,05/08/2015,19:19,Wolfsburg keen to keep De Bruyne despite City interest,"Belgium international playmaker Kevin De Bruyne is all but certain to remain with Wolfsburg next season, sporting director Klaus Allofs said Wednesday amid reports of interest from Manchester City.","De Bruyne starred as Wolfsburg finished second in the Bundesliga and won the German Cup last season and City were reported to be ready to make a blockbuster bid of around £50 million ($77.9m) for the 24-year-old former Chelsea midfielder. But Allofts insisted that Wolfsburg were not dependent on the transfer money although they would study any offers out of respect for the player. ""But the chances that he will stay are 99.9%,"" he added. De Bruyne remained tight-lipped stating it was ""the clubs who decide"" on his future a week before the Bundesliga gets underway. ""I can't say what will happen. I'm not aware of any offer. It's the clubs who decide what will happen. We have to see what Wolfsburg say,"" Bruyne told SID, an AFP subsidiary. ""I'm not the type to say that I'm staying and then to leave two weeks later,"" added the 33-times capped Bruyne, who is under contract until 2019. Wolfsburg open their season at home against Eintracht Frankfurt on August 16."
179,26/07/2015,19:47,Walcott seals Emirates Cup success for Arsenal,Arsenal stepped up their impressive preparations for the new season by winning the Emirates Cup for the first time since 2010 as Theo Walcott's strike clinched a 1-0 win over Wolfsburg on Sunday.,"Walcott's second half goal ensured Arsene Wenger's side took the silverware as they finished above Villarreal, who also won both their matches but had an inferior goals scored record, in the four-team pre-season tournament at their Emirates Stadium. After a swaggering 6-0 rout of Lyon on Saturday, this was a more prosaic performance from the hosts, but there was still plenty to encourage Gunners boss Wenger ahead of their Premier League opener against West Ham on August 9. Former Chelsea goalkeeper Petr Cech, the only major signing made by Wenger since the end of last season, marked his home debut with the kind of composed display that was so often missing during Arsenal's goalkeeping woes in recent years. After starting last season's FA Cup final win against Aston Villa in the central striker's role he has coveted for much of his career, Walcott's cool finish provided further evidence the winger might be ready to make a permanent transition this season. There was also a tantalising glimpse into Arsenal's future as 17-year-old French midfielder Jeff Reine-Adelaide made an eye-catching start 24 hours after an equally effervescent performance from fellow teenager Alex Iwobi. And, having already secured the Asia Trophy earlier this month, the Gunners can now clinch a hat-trick of pre-season trophies if they defeat Chelsea in the Community Shield at Wembley next Sunday. ""Our technical level was good, but it was maybe less spectacular than yesterday because our final ball wasn't at the top level,"" Wenger said. ""We gave them many more problems in the second half because we pushed up more and overall it was two good days."" Despite his long spell with bitter rivals Chelsea, Cech was given a warm welcome by the Arsenal fans in his second appearance for the club. Relieved to see Wenger finally sign a world-class 'keeper, fans greeted 33-year-old Czech's first touch, comfortably holding a Kevin De Bruyne cross, with a standing ovation. Wolfsburg manager Dieter Hecking says the Bundesliga runners-up have been destabilised by speculation that Manchester City are about to make a £50 million ($77.5 million) bid for Belgium playmaker De Bruyne. But they still dominated much of the first half, working opportunities for De Bruyne, who shot well over, then former Arsenal striker Nicklas Bendtner, who narrowly failed to convert a De Bruyne cross. Arsenal were unable to recapture the scintillating form that destroyed Lyon and Walcott wasted one of their few first half chances when he shot straight at goalkeeper Diego Benaglio from a tight angle. Wolfsburg were presented with a golden opportunity to take the lead when Timm Klose, unmarked 10 yards from goal, lashed wildly over from a deflected Andre Schurrle corner. In the end, it took a moment of inspiration from Reine-Adelaide to break the deadlock. Signed from the Lens academy last month after helping France win the European Under-17 Championships, Reine-Adelaide has been hailed by Wenger as ""something special"" and he showed why with a quality contribution to Walcott's 50th minute goal. A deft first touch and nimble turn took the youngster away from his marker and he advanced quickly towards the penalty area before slipping a clever pass through to Walcott, who calmly slotted past Benaglio. Aware of his potential move to rivals City, De Bruyne drew mocking jeers from the Arsenal fans when he miscued a woeful effort well over with his last contribution before being substituted. There was still time for Cech to underline why Wenger paid £11 million to prise him away from Chelsea as he blocked Ricardo Rodriguez's low drive, then got down smartly to keep out Josuha Guilavogui's effort."
180,25/07/2015,17:31,City yet to make bid for Wolfsburg star De Bruyne,Wolfsburg manager Dieter Hecking says his club have yet to receive a formal offer from Manchester City for Belgium playmaker Kevin De Bruyne.,"De Bruyne starred as Wolfsburg finished second in the Bundesliga and won the German Cup last season. City are reported to be ready to make a blockbuster bid of around £50 million for the 24-year-old former Chelsea midfielder, who broke the Bundesliga assists record last term. De Bruyne's agent Patrick De Koster is said to have travelled to London for talks with City director of football Txiki Begiristain this weekend as Wolfsburg are playing in a pre-season tournament at Arsenal's Emirates Stadium. But Hecking, speaking after De Bruyne made a 60-minute appearance for Wolfsburg in their 2-1 defeat against Villarreal in the Emirates Cup on Saturday, insisted City haven't followed up their interest by putting in a formal offer. ""There's no official offer to Wolfsburg. Kevin's been very good with me and that's all there is to say,"" Hecking said. ""I'm not here to talk about contractual matters. He has no (release) clause (in his contract), but that isn't the question for us. ""We have no offer from Manchester City. We have no offer from anybody."" However, with Wolfsburg's Bundesliga opener against Eintracht Frankfurt looming on August 16, Hecking admits the speculation over De Bruyne's future is an unwanted distraction. ""Of course we want to see a conclusion to this situation. We had a great season last year and Kevin De Bruyne played a big role in this,"" Hecking added. ""We want to finish this speculation. It's great for the media of course, but as a coach I have to concentrate on my team."""
181,25/07/2015,17:01,Villarreal make winning start in Emirates Cup,Spanish side Villarreal kicked off the Emirates Cup with a 2-1 win over Bundesliga runners-up Wolfsburg on Saturday.,"Marcelino Garcia Toral's team made a flying start in the opening match of the four-team pre-season tournament thanks to first-half goals from Mario Gaspar and Matias Nahuel Leiva at Arsenal's Emirates Stadium. Villarreal, who finished sixth in La Liga last season, opened the scoring in the eighth minute when Spanish right-back Gaspar seized on Samuel Castillejo's deflected pass into the penalty area and slammed his left-footed strike past Wolfsburg goalkeeper Koen Casteels into the top corner. Dieter Hecking's Wolfsburg were level within two minutes, with Croatia winger Ivan Perisic slotting home at the far post after Daniel Caligiuri's low cross exposed the back-pedaling Villarreal defence. It was the kind of incisive run and finish that showed why Inter Milan are keen to sign the 26-year-old. But Villarreal were back in front in the 17th minute after referee Bobby Madley waved play on following a bone-jarring midfield collision and teenage midfielder Nahuel Leiva took advantage, sprinting clear to stroke a cool finish past Casteels. With Wolfsburg playmaker Kevin De Bruyne showing little of the quality that has made him a Manchester City transfer target, the Belgium international, who had been booked in the first half, was taken off with 30 minutes left. De Bruyne's departure was one of a raft of second half substitutions that included a return to the Emirates for Wolfsburg's former Arsenal striker Nicklas Bendtner, but the Dane couldn't inspire a late equaliser. Later on Saturday, hosts Arsenal face French side Lyon. On Sunday, Villarreal play Lyon and Arsenal take on Wolfsburg."
182,08/07/2015,12:55,Title-hunger drew Kruse from Gladbach to Wolfsburg,Germany striker Max Kruse says a hunger to win titles next season was behind his decision to join Bundesliga runners-up VfL Wolfsburg from fellow Champions League side Borussia Moenchengladbach.,"Both teams have qualified directly for the group stages of the Champions League next season, but Kruse has been lured to Wolfsburg in the quest for more silverware after Wolves won the German Cup last season and finished second to Bayern Munich in the Bundesliga ahead of Gladbach. The 27-year-old wants to add to his tally of 13 caps for world champions Germany by breaking into Joachim Loew's first-choice team and says Wolfsburg's desire to establish themselves as a top European side made the difference. ""At the end of the day, it's not about how popular a club is, but what prospects it has. I want to win titles and Wolfsburg has a better outlook than Gladbach,"" Kruse told Sport Bild magazine. ""In Gladbach, no-one would say 'we have to play for the German title and get into the Champions League'. The attitude there isn't the same as mine,"" added Kruse, who cost Wolfsburg 12 million euros ($12.24m). Kruse is Wolfsburg's main signing so far with the new season set to start on August 14 when Bayern host Hamburg, while Wolfsburg are home to Eintracht Frankfurt the following day."
183,30/06/2015,12:26,"De Bruyne going nowhere, says Wolfsburg boss","Wolfsburg has sent a ""hands off"" signal to the clubs chasing Kevin de Bruyne by insisting their Belgium midfielder is not for sale as they look to improve his contract.","Manchester City, Bayern Munich and Paris Saint-Germain have all been linked to the 24-year-old attacking midfielder who helped steer Wolfsburg to a Champions League place next season and scored in last month's German Cup final win over Borussia Dortmund. De Bruyne has a contract with Wolfsburg until 2019 and Wolfsburg's director of sport Klaus Allofs says they want to sit down and offer him an improved deal to keep him at the Bundesliga's runners-up. ""Kevin has a contract until 2019, so the signal has already been sent out. He will stay with us,"" Allofs told German broadcaster Sport1. ""We've said we will look at his contract. ""The aim is to take into account financially Kevin's extraordinary development and I think we will reach an agreement here very quickly."" The Belgian attracted plenty of attention after scoring 16 goals and setting up 29 more in all competitions in a stellar season after joining from Chelsea where he was given few opportunities by Blues boss Jose Mourinho. Wolfsburg will be back in the Champions League next season for the first time since 2009 having finished second only to Bayern Munich in the German league last season."

A motorcade of vehicles needed nearly two hours to carry the team the three kilometres from the train station to the town hall through streets packed with fans. The convoy stopped repeatedly for players to pose for pictures with fans and show off the trophy. ""We have hardly slept at all, events like this you have to enjoy,"" said Germany winger Andre Schuerrle, while sports director Klaus Allofs added: ""Some of us weren't in bed very long"". Wolves coach Dieter Hecking, celebrating the first title of his career at 50, was the victim of the customary 'beer shower' when four players doused him with enormous glasses of the frothing liquid. ""It's impressive when you see the people here in such a good mood,"" said goal-scorer Dost, who danced to his favourite rap music at the town hall before he also succumbed to a beer shower on his 26th birthday. This is Wolfsburg's second major title in the club's 69-year history having won the 2009 Bundesliga title. Main sponsors Volkswagen threw a huge party in Berlin after the final whistle as the team has also qualified for the Champions League next season for only the second time in the club's history."
185,30/05/2015,23:41,Wolfsburg win was in memory of Malanda - De Bruyne,Goal-scorer Kevin De Bruyne said the tragic death of former team-mate Junior Malanda had helped inspire Wolfsburg's 3-1 victory over Borussia Dortmund in Saturday's German Cup final.,"The junior Belgium international was killed in January in a road accident while en route to joining up with the Wolfsburg squad before their training camp in South Africa. He was just 20 years old. Attacking midfielder De Bruyne said Malanda was never far from his team-mates thoughts as Wolfsburg won the German Cup for the first time having qualified for the Champions League next season. After scoring Wolfsburg's second goal in Berlin, De Bruyne kissed the Number 19 logo -- Malanda's squad number -- which has been printed in a heart on the club's playing shirts since his death. ""I think he helped us a lot in the second-half of the season, his memory played on with us and he will also be in my thoughts,"" said De Bruyne, who had attended Malanda's funeral with the senior Belgium squad. Goals by De Bruyne, defensive midfielder Luiz Gustavo and striker Bas Dost cancelled out Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang's early Dortmund goal as Wolfsburg ruined Jurgen Klopp's final game as Borussia head coach. With his side leading 3-1 at the break, Wolfsburg coach Dieter Hecking said memories of Malanda had featured in his half-time team talk. ""He wasn't just a presence today, he has been with us for the whole of the second half of the season,"" said Hecking. ""I said in the break that we had the strength of a 12th man behind us and he played his part."""

Arsenal, Bayern Munich and Atletico Madrid are also watching his Dortmund teammate Gundogan who refused to sign a new deal. Second-place Wolfsburg could struggle to hold onto Belgian international de Bruyne who has been heavily linked to a return to the English Premier League with Manchester United or Manchester City. He could also tempt Bayern Munich as they rebuild after failing to reach the Champions League final. Wolfsburg and seventh-place Dortmund dispute the German Cup final in Berlin on May 30 but both have unfinished Bundesliga business first. Reus took part in team training on Thursday having missed Saturday's win over Hertha Berlin with a groin injury and could play a part in Borussia's push for a European berth next season at Wolves. Dortmund, who will also lose coach Jurgen Klopp at the end of the season, have risen 11 places since the winter break and a win would be an enormous boost in efforts to claim a Europa League spot. They are currently two points off sixth place Schalke. Klopp stressed how Wolfsburg have won only three points more than Dortmund since the winter break. ""The difference between the two sides isn't as great as it was in the first half of the season,"" said Klopp who insisted the German Cup clash would be ""a completely different contest"". Wolfsburg are also desperate for a win to stay ahead of Borussia Moenchengladbach in the battle for second place in the Bundesliga. And they have not lost a game at home yet this season. Marcel Schafer, Luiz Gustavo and Ivan Perisic are being treated for ""slight knocks"" but manager Dieter Hecking said ""our aim is to end the season unbeaten in our own stadium."" Third place Borussia Monchengladbach, just two points behind Wolfsburg, go to Werder Bremen looking for their first win there in 28 years. Still smarting from their Champions League semi-final exit to Barcelona, champions Bayern Munich are at Freiburg with Pep Guardiola's side now just playing for pride. Their 25th German league title is already won. Freiburg are only out of the relegation places on goal difference and would relish the chance of a rare win over the Bavarian giants however. Guardiola is already reportedly planning to rebuild his squad for September. ""We want to fight back next season. We'll start from the beginning again,"" he said after the Barcelona game. With Dortmund breathing down their neck, Schalke host relegation-threatened Paderborn having shaken up their squad after one win in eight games by releasing Ghana midfielder Kevin-Prince Boateng and Germany winger Sidney Sam. Royal Blues bosses are furious after last Sunday's embarrassing 2-0 defeat at Cologne and are desperate to the defeats which threaten their place in Europe next season. There will also be a battle royal at the bottom of the table as two former Bundesliga giants slug it out when bottom side Stuttgart host Hamburg, also in the danger zone, with just two points separating the bottom sides which also including Paderborn, Freiburg and Hanover."

""Therefore this will be an historic game and the first time in a competitive match where the technology has been used here,"" said DFB general secretary Helmut Sandrock. The top clubs in Germany's first two divisions voted last December in favour of bringing it in in time for next season. Last year's Cup final was won 2-0 by Bayern Munich in extra time against Dortmund, but only after officials failed to spot that a header from Borussia defender Mats Hummels had crossed the line during the 90 minutes. ""The technology can only improve things,"" said Dortmund CEO Hans-Joachim Watzke. ""That was a clear goal -- if it had counted, we would have won the final."""
189,10/05/2015,19:37,Wolfsburg win seals Champions League berth,Dutch striker Bas Dost scored twice as VfL Wolfsburg secured a Champions League berth following a six-year absence with a 3-1 win over relegation-threatened Paderborn on Sunday.,"Dost's double leaves him with 19 goals in all competitions as Wolfsburg went back up to second with just two games left. Wolves picked up their first win in four league games when Swiss defender Timm Klose headed home on 16 minutes before Dost netted nine minutes later by meeting Ivan Perisic's cross at the near post. The 25-year-old showed his predatory skills by pouncing on a parried save eight minutes from time to slot home his second. Paderborn pulled a goal back when midfielder Lukas Rupp hit the top right-hand corner with a speculative shot on the edge of the area just before the whistle. The defeat keeps Paderborn 17th, but with all still to play for as just two points separate the bottom five teams of Hamburg, Freiburg, Hanover 96, Paderborn and bottom side VfB Stuttgart with two games left. Schalke dropped to sixth after their 2-0 defeat at Cologne means Robert di Matteo's side has won just one of their last eight league games and in danger of dropping out of the European places for next season. Schalke are just two points ahead of neighbours Dortmund, who are making a late bid for a Europa League spot after starting February last in the table. Goals by midfielders Marcel Risse and Yannick Gerdhardt confirmed Cologne's survival in the top flight. On Saturday, ten-man Bayern Munich suffered a morale-sapping fourth straight defeat by losing 1-0 to Augsburg ahead of Tuesday's Champions League semi-final, return leg against Barcelona. Augsburg's Paraguay striker Raul Bobadilla followed on from Barcelona's Lionel Messi by inflicting more misery on the Bundesliga champions. Bayern host Barca facing an uphill task having been routed 3-0 in Spain, when Messi scored twice, which followed defeats to Borussia Dortmund in the German Cup semi-final and a league defeat at Bayer Leverkusen. Bayern played nearly 80 minutes with ten men after reserve goalkeeper Pepe Reina was shown a straight red card with just 13 minutes gone. Dutch defender Paul Verhaegh hit the post with the resulting spot-kick. But Augsburg grabbed the winner when Danish midfielder Pierre-Emile Hoejbjerg, on loan from Bayern, put in a cross which Bobadilla deftly back-heeled on 71 minutes. Borussia Moenchengladbach are virtually sure of joining Wolfsburg and Bayern directly in the Champions League next season after their 3-0 win over fourth-placed Bayer Leverkusen. Germany striker Max Kruse, who will play for Wolfsburg next season, Patrick Herrmann and Guinea forward Ibrahima Traore scored Gladbach's goals. Borussia Dortmund enjoyed a 2-0 win at home to Hertha Berlin as goals by defenders Neven Subotic and Erik Durm lifted Dortmund to seventh. Hanover remain third from bottom after their 1-1 draw at home to Werder Bremen while Stuttgart stayed at the foot of the table despite their 2-0 win over Mainz. Mid-table Eintracht Frankfurt enjoyed a 3-1 win over Hoffenheim while Hamburg stayed above the relegation places with a 1-1 draw at home to Freiburg on Friday thanks to Gojko Kacar's 90th-minute equaliser."

""We are delighted that Max Kruse has decided to join us,"" said Wolves' director of football Klaus Allofs. ""He is the type of striker who is missing in our squad and he will raise the quality and variation in our game."" Kruse is reported to have cost Wolves 12 million euros (US$13.5m) and is set to earn five million euros per year with his new club after scoring 25 goals in 75 matches for 'Gladbach since joining from Freiburg in 2013. ""I had two great years at Borussia and it has played an important role in my career,"" said Kruse, who scored his 11th league goal of the season in Saturday's 3-0 win over Bayer Leverkusen. ""Of course I will do my best to make sure we get as much as possible out of the two remaining games."" Wolfsburg's win at Paderborn means they cannot finish lower than third in Germany's top flight this season. It confirmed their automatic Champions League place for next season after a six-year absence from the tournament while Gladbach are poised to join them after their win over Leverkusen left them third in the table with two games left."

Kruse confirmed on Sunday before Borussia's 2-1 away win over Hertha Berlin that he has had a medical with Wolfsburg. ""I haven't signed a contract anywhere and I believe we will slowly come to a solution,"" said Kruse, who has also been linked with Borussia Dortmund, Schalke and Bayer Leverkusen. ""There will be discussions in the coming days and weeks. If there is something to announce, I will."" With Germany's top three teams qualifying directly for the Champions League, both second-placed Wolfsburg and third-placed Gladbach are set to play in European football's top domestic competition League next season. Wolves are reported to have offered him a four-year contract and their coach Dieter Hecking said they are waiting to hear from the player. ""It has become known that we are interested in him,"" Hecking told broadcaster NDR.

Brazil's Luiz Gustavo and Croatia's Ivan Perisic also got on the scoresheet at Bielefeld's sold-out Schuco Arena as the third division leaders were punished for defensive lapses. Wolfsburg, who are destined for the Champions League next season and are second in Germany's top tier, ended Bielefeld's hopes of reaching a first German Cup final. Arminia had claimed the scalps of Hertha Berlin, Werder Bremen and Borussia Moenchengladbach en route to the last four. Arnold put his side ahead on eight minutes with a perfectly-timed run into the box to drill home Daniel Caligiuri's defence-splitting pass. Caligiuri was a constant menace on the left wing and set up three of Wolfsburg's four goals. Defensive midfielder Luiz Gustavo headed home Wolfsburg's second with 32 minutes gone when he got the better of a posse of defenders from a corner. Perisic added the visitors' third on 51 minutes after some good work in the area from Belgium midfielder Kevin de Bruyne and Caligiuri. Arnold grabbed his second and Wolves' fourth four minutes later when he fired home left-footeed from close range after profiting from another Caligiuri pass. Wolfsburg will face Dortmund at Berlin's Olympic Stadium on May 30, with Borussia looking to give Jurgen Klopp a perfect send-off with one last piece of silverware after seven successful years as coach. Dieter Hecking's Wolfsburg, the 2009 German league champions, have never won the domestic cup, while Dortmund will be bidding for their fourth title, having reached their third final in the last four years."

They are just one more upset from a place in the cup final at Berlin's Olympic Stadium on May 30 while holders Bayern Munich host Borussia Dortmund in Tuesday's other semi-final. De Bruyne injured his foot in Sunday's 1-0 league defeat at Borussia Moenchengladbach, but will travel with the squad to Bielefeld having netted 10 goals and provided 18 assists in a stellar season. Wolfsburg are set to finish second in the Bundesliga behind champions Bayern Munich. ""All the players are fit. The cup heals all wounds, so to speak,"" said Wolfsburg coach Dieter Hecking as his side look to bounce back from their Gladbach defeat. Third-division leaders Bielefeld are poised for promotion next season and their penalty shoot-out victory over Gladbach earlier this month means Wolfsburg can ill afford to show a lack of respect. ""We're meeting an opponent who is organised, puts in a lot of running and is combative, but it's in our hands,"" said Hecking. ""We'll need to be patient and calm, Gladbach didn't manage to put tempo in their game (in the quarter-final), which is something we need to avoid."""
194,23/04/2015,23:20,Holders Sevilla through to Europa League semis,Holders Sevilla sealed their place in the semi-finals of the Europa League on Thursday after a dramatic 2-2 draw with Zenit St Petersburg in Russia saw them progress 4-3 on aggregate.,"The Spanish side threw away a commanding lead in the tie by conceding two second-half goals, and the match looked to be heading for extra time until substitute Kevin Gameiro popped up with five minutes remaining. The French striker, whose penalty in the shoot-out against Benfica in last season's final secured the trophy for Unai Emery's side, beat Yuri Lodygin with a crisp strike to silence the Petrovski Stadium and take Sevilla into Friday's draw. Having won 2-1 in the first leg in Spain a week ago, Sevilla were in a fantastic position in the tie after Carlos Bacca converted a penalty in the sixth minute for his 22nd goal of the season after Vitolo went down under the slightest of contact from Luis Neto. Zenit now needed to score twice without reply just to force extra time but they were given hope just after the interval when Jose Rondon netted after Beto fumbled Oleg Shatov's cross. And then Brazil star Hulk squared the tie on aggregate with an incredible strike from 40 yards out wide on the right that hit the underside of the bar and landed just over the line. But Gameiro emerged to send Andre Villas-Boas's Russian Premier League leaders packing from European competition. Italy will have two representatives in the semi-finals after Fiorentina and Napoli both sealed their progress. After scoring a late away goal in Kiev last week to hold Dynamo Kiev to a 1-1 draw, Fiorentina won the return 2-0 against the Ukrainian giants thanks to a goal in each half from Mario Gomez and substitute Juan Manuel Vargas. Vincenzo Montella's side battered the visitors in the opening stages with Gomez having an effort disallowed for offside, Marcos Alonso hitting the bar and Gomez and Mohamed Salah both being denied by Olexandr Shovkovskiy. Dynamo were then reduced to 10 men five minutes before the interval as Dutchman Jeremain Lens was shown a second yellow card after being harshly adjudged to have dived on the edge of the box. Moments after that Gomez diverted a driven ball by Joaquin into the net to score his 40th goal in European competition, one more than his illustrious compatriot Karl-Heinz Rummenigge. Despite their one-man advantage, nerves got the better of Fiorentina in the second half and they had to wait until the fourth minute of added time to make sure of the victory as Peruvian forward Vargas fired home from a tight angle. The Florence outfit are through to a first European semi-final since reaching the last four of the UEFA Cup in 2008 and they are joined by Napoli, whose 2-2 draw at home to Wolfsburg saw them progress 6-3 on aggregate. After a big win in Germany last week, Rafa Benitez's side increased their aggregate lead as Gonzalo Higuain set up Jose Callejon and Dries Mertens to score second-half goals at the San Paolo. Timm Klose and Ivan Perisic scored to earn Wolfsburg a draw on the night and rescue some pride. In Kiev, Dnipro made it through to a first ever European semi-final as a late goal from substitute Yevhen Shakhov sealed a 1-0 win over Club Brugge. After a goalless first leg last week, the tie appeared to be heading for extra time until Shakhov struck in the 82nd minute to inflict a first defeat on the Belgians in 16 games in the competition this season. With Dnipro progressing, Zenit's exit cures something of a headache for UEFA, who have been keeping Russian and Ukrainian sides apart in continental competition ever since the conflict broke out in eastern Ukraine last year."

But Schalke took a spectacular lead against the run of play as Germany under-19 left winger Leroy Sane won the ball on the edge of his own area, then sprinted away before beating two Wolves defenders to fire home on 53 minutes. Having also earlier gone close with a free-kick, Belgium international De Bruyne rescued the hosts when he hit the bottom right-hand corner from 20 metres out to claim his 10th Bundesliga goal of the season on 78 minutes. Wolfsburg could have snatched the three points at the death as France midfielder Joshua Guilavogui blasted a late volley over the bar. Earlier, bottom side Hamburg suffered their fifth straight defeat and are heading towards an historic relegation from Germany's top flight after their 1-0 defeat to Werder Bremen in the north German derby. Bremen's Argentine striker Franco di Santo claimed his 13th goal of the season by netting an 84th-minute penalty just after Hamburg's Swiss midfielder Valon Behrami was sent off -- on his 30th birthday -- for pulling down Werder's Zlatko Junuzovic. Bremen are one of the league's success stories this season having gone from last place in December to finish the weekend four points adrift of a Europa League spot. In contrast, hapless Hamburg have just five games to close the four-point gap to safety as Bruno Labbadia suffered defeat in his first game since being appointed as Hamburg's fourth coach this season on Wednesday.

197,16/04/2015,23:22,Clinical Napoli destroy Wolfsburg in Europa League,Rafa Benitez worked his European magic again on Thursday as a rampant Napoli produced a superb display to beat VfL Wolfsburg 4-1 in Germany in the first leg of their Europa League quarter-final.,"Captain Marek Hamsik scored twice in between strikes by Gonzalo Higuain and Manolo Gabbiadini for the visitors at the Volkswagen Arena, and while Nicklas Bendtner got one back late on, next week's second leg now looks set to be a formality. Benitez has come under increasing pressure for Napoli's faltering domestic form, with a run of just two wins in eight matches in Serie A seeing them slip seven points adrift of third place and a Champions League qualifying spot. That means winning the Europa League -- which now brings with it a berth in the next season's Champions League -- now looks the easiest route into the continent's leading club competition for Napoli. And Benitez, who has won the Champions League, UEFA Cup and Europa League in an impressive managerial career, marked his 55th birthday on Thursday by seeing his side win in some style. There was more than a shade of fortune about the opening goal in the 15th minute, as Higuain clearly controlled a long Dries Mertens ball with his hand before finishing past Diego Benaglio. The 1989 UEFA Cup winners ripped the home defence open again to double their lead midway through the first half, Higuain turning provider this time with a great pass for the unmarked Hamsik to score. Wolfsburg, flying high in second place in the Bundesliga, were stunned but only a great Mariano Andujar save from an Andre Schuerrle shot prevented them from pulling one back. Napoli then increased their lead in the 64th minute when Jose Callejon pounced on a slack pass by Josuha Guilavogui before cutting the ball back for Hamsik to finish. Substitute Gabbiadini then completed the rout when he headed home from a Lorenzo Insigne cross, although Wolfsburg got one back as former Arsenal striker Bendtner tapped in an assist by Ivan Perisic. Gabbiadini crashed a superb shot off the bar late on, but Napoli look to have got the job done. Meanwhile, current trophy holders Sevilla had two substitutes to thank as they came from behind to beat Zenit St Petersburg 2-1 at the Ramon Sanchez Pizjuan. The visitors, coached by Andre Villas-Boas, took the lead in the 29th minute when Aleksandr Ryazantsev rammed the rebound into the roof of the net after his initial shot was blocked by goalkeeper Sergio Rico. Sevilla had gone 33 games at home without losing for over more than a year but that run was under serious threat until they produced an equaliser in the 73rd minute. Aleix Vidal held up a cross from the right and Carlos Bacca, who had come on for Kevin Gameiro a short while before, headed home from close range. And Sevilla claimed a precious lead to take to Russia for the return as Barcelona loanee Denis Suarez, also on as a substitute, volleyed past Yuri Lodygin two minutes from time. Elsewhere, Bacca's old side Club Brugge remain the only team yet to lose in this season's Europa League after a 0-0 draw at home to Dnipro of Ukraine. And Ukrainian league leaders Dyanmo Kiev, conquerors of Everton in the last round, had to settle for a 1-1 draw at home to Fiorentina. Dutchman Jeremain Lens gave the home side the lead in the first half but Khouma Boubacar, the Senegalese striker, produced an acrobatic finish in stoppage time to give La Viola a precious away goal and a draw to take back to Italy for the return next Thursday."

Mainz took a shock seventh-minute lead against Wolfsburg when defender Niko Bungert out-jumped the Wolfsburg defence to head home from a corner. The hosts looked to have doubled their lead but Japan striker Shinji Okazaki's 40th-minute strike was ruled offside. Wolfsburg made their possession count as Brazil midfielder Luiz Gustavo hit the post, then scored their equaliser on 61 minutes. The result left Wolfsburg 10 points adrift of Bayern. On Saturday, Germany winger Karim Bellarabi fired Bayer Leverkusen into the Bundesliga's top three with a 1-0 win at Schalke 04. Having bowed out of the Champions League after suffering the heartbreak of a penalty shoot-out defeat to Atletico Madrid in the last 16, Leverkusen leap-frogged Gladbach into third in Germany's top flight. Bellarabi, who has been linked to Arsenal, grabbed the 35th-minute winner from the tightest of angles with a superb shot across goal. Schalke coach Roberto di Matteo was bitterly disappointed as the defeat left his side five points from a possible Champions League place for next season. Borussia Dortmund also bounced back from their mid-week Champions League exit with a 3-2 win at 10-man Hanover to earn their first victory in four games. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang netted twice as Dortmund picked up valuable league points after goalless draws against Hamburg and Cologne. Borussia took the lead through Aubameyang on 19 minutes, but Hanover hit back when Lars Stindl's weak shot beat the visitors' defence. Dortmund captain Mats Hummels then headed off the line, but the game turned on 55 minutes when ex-Dortmund midfielder Leonardo Bittencourt was sent off for a second yellow card and Borussia made the numerical advantage. Japan midfielder Shinji Kagawa netted his first league goal since September on 57 minutes, then set up Aubameyang for his second goal on 61 minutes before Stindl made it 3-2 with eight minutes left. The win left Borussia tenth with Hanover 14th and two points from relegation. Bremen stay ninth after being held to a 1-1 draw at mid-table Cologne as a first-half goal by Germany Under-19 striker Davie Selke for the visitors was cancelled out by an 88th-minute penalty from Cologne midfielder Matthias Lehmann. Freiburg climbed out of the bottom three with a 2-0 win at home to Augsburg thanks to second-half goals from Jonathan Schmid and Nils Petersen. Paderborn stay second-from-bottom after their goalless draw at home to ten-man Hoffenheim, who had Bosnia defender Ermin Bicakcic sent off for a second yellow card. VfB Stuttgart remain rooted to the foot of the table despite their 3-1 comeback win at home to Eintracht Frankfurt. The result means just two points separate the bottom four teams of Stuttgart, Freiburg, Paderborn and Hamburg in Germany's top flight."

The team are 11 points ahead of third-placed Bayer Leverkusen who cantered past Stuttgart 4-0 on Friday. The final match of the weekend will see Borussia Moenchengladbach host Hanover later Sunday. On Saturday, Bayern Munich put the finishing touches on a perfect week's work as they defeated Werder Bremen 4-0. Pep Guardiola's side made it three wins in seven days, scoring 14 goals and conceding just one, as they kept up their relentless league form but also also qualified for the Champions League quarter-finals. German international striker Thomas Mueller grabbed his fifth goal in a week with a left foot shot past Raphael Wolf to put the champions 1-0 in front on 24 minutes at the Weser-Stadion. Austrian defender David Alaba then scored his second league goal of the season to cushion the advantage before Polish international Robert Lewandowski added the gloss with two late goals to round out the scoring. ""The team maintained total concentration throughout and did very, very well,"" said the Spaniard. ""After the match against Donetsk it wasn't easy adapting to new opponents, but it was one of those days when I'm so proud to be coach of this team."" Elsewhere, Eintracht Frankfurt consolidated their place in the upper half of the table with a routine 4-0 win over third-from-bottom Paderborn. Mainz picked up a crucial 2-0 victory over Augsburg, thanks to a distinctive Asian flavour, as they eased their relegation fears. Shinji Okazaki added to his record as the highest Japanese scorer in Bundesliga history, with the opener on 32 minutes, before former South Korea captain Koo Ja-cheol guaranteed the points in the final minute. Hertha Berlin missed the chance for three valuable points as they were deprived victory in the final minute by a Joel Matip equaliser for Schalke. A see-saw match finished 2-2 in the capital.

But de Bruyne set up Naldo for the German side's first-half equaliser, then with a little help from Inter's stand-in goalkeeper Juan Pablo Carrizo he scored a second-half double. Wolves' record signing from Chelsea should have had a treble only to fire wide with Carrizo's goal at his mercy towards the end. Wolves will now justifiably fancy their prospects of securing a ticket to the last eight in the last 16 second leg at the San Siro next week. Andre Villas-Boas' Zenit St Petersburg also have an option on the next round judged on their 2-0 win over another Italian side, Torino, in St Petersburg.

Wolfsburg had hit the front after 10 minutes. Dost, who found the net four times in a remarkable 5-4 win against Leverkusen last weekend, swept home first-time from inside the box after Andre Schuerrle had flicked on Vieirinha's pass.

Schuerrle screwed a shot over before half-time and in the second half the new signing from Chelsea blazed a close-range volley off target after Dost had nodded the ball back to him. Schuerrle missed two further chances before Dost reacted quickest when Luiz Gustavo's thunderous shot from distance crashed back off the post. His 11th league goal of the season condemned Hertha to a fifth defeat in six matches. Meanwhile, an injury-time goal from substitute Branimir Hrgota earned Borussia Moenchengladbach a 1-1 draw at Hamburg and denied the home team some breathing space in their fight against relegation. A well-taken 73rd-minute strike from Zoltan Stieber looked like it might be enough to move Hamburg four points clear of the drop zone, only for Swedish forward Hrgota to power home a header from a corner. The visitors had been hoping to take a firmer grip on third place after results went their way on Saturday but in the end they were relieved to escape with a point. ""Hamburg were very aggressive,"" Gladbach boss Lucien Favre said. ""We had two very good chances at the start and we didn't take them. ""You have to say too that Hamburg fought very well. Bayern drew 0-0 here, Leverkusen lost 1-0 and Hanover lost 2-1 [in the derby]. It's not easy here."" Hamburg had made seven changes to the team that was hammered 8-0 by Bayern last weekend, with out-of-form captain Rafael van der Vaart left on the bench as Joe Zinnbauer sought a strong reaction. And goalscorer Stieber said it was vital that the home side responded well. ""We knew that last week, it was a very bad day for us,"" he said. ""All week long we showed a lot of concentration in training. ""It's tough to lose points in the last seconds but that's football. Nevertheless, we showed that we're a good team."" Gladbach looked more likely to score early on as Max Kruse fired just wide after a swift break from Patrick Herrmann. Before five minutes were up, Herrmann went even closer -- seeing his deflected close-range strike come back off the post. The game looked to be drifting to a goalless draw in the second period but it exploded into life when Artjoms Rudnevs broke at pace before setting up Stieber. The Hungarian attacker curled home into the bottom corner beyond Gladbach 'keeper Yann Sommer. But Gladbach forced a corner two minutes into stoppage time and substitute Raffael cleverly stepped out of the path of the ball to allow Hrgota's header to nestle in the corner. On Saturday, Bayern enjoyed a 6-0 win at 10-man Paderborn, while Augsburg goalkeeper Marwin Hitz scored a stoppage-time equaliser in a 2-2 draw against Bayer Leverkusen. Robert Lewandowksi's first-half double got Bayern on their way, while Arjen Robben is the league's top scorer after getting his 15th and 16th goals of the season."

The Korean ended up on the losing team as Dutch striker Bas Dost scored four goals, including a 94th-minute winner, as second-placed Wolfsburg remained eight points behind Bundesliga leaders Bayern. Despite his impressive goal haul, Son is only the joint ninth top scorer in the Bundesliga, while Dost is joint fourth, with Bayern Munich's Arjen Robben and Frankfurt captain Alexander Meier setting the pace on 14 goals each. Leverkusen are sixth in the table after their second straight defeat, having been shocked by resurgent Werder Bremen last Sunday. Roger Schmidt's Bayer prepare to host 2014 finalists Atletico Madrid in the last 16, first-leg, of the Champions League in 10 days time, having lost 4-0 at home to Paris St Germain at the same stage last season."

His punishment was for ""unsportsmanlike conduct in the form of crass behaviour,"" said the DFB in a statement. Wolfsburg have 24 hours to appeal and request a hearing in front of the DFB's sports court. De Bruyne's rant was audible on television and the midfielder is reported to want to give the youngster, who plays for Frankfurt's Under-16 team, a signed playing shirt. De Bruyne is having a stellar season for Wolfsburg having scored eight times including the goal in the draw with Eintracht."
209,06/02/2015,02:16,Guardiola shows strain as Bayern head to Stuttgart,Pep Guardiola is showing signs of feeling the pressure as Bundesliga leaders Bayern Munich hunt their first win of the year at strugglers VfB Stuttgart on Saturday.,"Bayern have failed to impress so far in 2015 in their two matches since returning from the Bundesliga's winter break with an 11-point lead. Their shock 4-1 thrashing at second-placed Wolfsburg last Friday was followed by a 1-1 draw at home to Schalke on Tuesday after playing for 70 minutes with ten men. The usually calm and composed Bayern coach sprinted 45 metres to remonstrate with the assistant referee after a Robert Lewandowski goal was disallowed in the 66th minute against Schalke. ""It was an emotional thing to do. I just spoke to him. It was very, very nice,"" said Guardiola tongue-in-cheek after the heated confrontation. But despite his brush-off remark, Guardiola needs an impressive display from Bayern to sooth any jarred nerves after the Wolfsburg defeat. Having steamrollered their domestic rivals before Christmas, Bayern were rattled in Wolfsburg and allowed Schalke to equalise, albeit with a numerical disadvantage following Jerome Boateng's dismissal. The Germany defender is banned for the next three games and misses the Stuttgart trip, plus home matches against Hamburg and away to Paderborn Stuttgart present the ideal chance to get back on track as Huub Stevens side are third from bottom after winning just one of their nine home games this season. Arjen Robben headed Bayern into the lead at the Allianz Arena before Schalke equalised and the Dutch star says they can ill afford similar performances as they bid for silverware. ""Of course, we played with ten men for most of the match, but when you let them equalise, conceding a goal like that can be deadly in the Champions League,"" said the 31-year-old. Bayern have two league games before they face Shakhtar Donetsk in the Ukrainian city of Lviv in the Champions League last 16, first-leg clash. Second-placed VfL Wolfsburg are set to give Andre Schuerrle his debut at home to Hoffenheim after signing the Germany winger from Chelsea on Monday to end his 19-month sojourn in London. Wolves needed a late Kevin de Bruyne goal to scrape a point in their 1-1 draw at Eintracht Frankfurt on Tuesday after their shock win over Bayern. China's Zhang Xizhe is waiting for his debut. Hertha Berlin are at Mainz 05 on Saturday with the capital city club second from bottom and with former player Pal Dardai and ex-assistant coach Rainer Widmayer now in charge. On Thursday, ex-coach Jos Luhukay became the fifth Bundesliga coach to be sacked this season after Wednesday's 1-0 loss at home to Bayer Leverkusen meant three defeats in three games. The Berlin club are battling to avoid their third relegation since 2010. Mainz will have striker Shinji Okazaki back in the side for the first time since his return from the Asian Cup where Japan reached the quarter-finals. Ahead of their trip to face Freiburg, Borussia Dortmund's coach Jurgen Klopp has insisted he will not resign with his side bottom of the table as they bid to avoid a first relegation since 1976. Dortmund will be without Kevin Grosskreutz at Freiburg and the Germany midfielder misses the next six weeks with a torn thigh muscle. He joins Ilkay Gundogan, Erik Durm and Lukasz Piszczek on Borussia's injury list. Roberto di Matteo's Schalke 04, who are sixth, have the chance to climb further up the table when they host third-placed Borussia Moenchengladbach. ""They are a direct competitor for a Champions League place and if we play as well as we did at Bayern, we will make Friday count,"" said Schalke captain Benedikt Hoewedes. Fixtures (all times GMT)"

211,04/02/2015,22:21,Ten-man Augsburg add to Dortmund's relegation woes,Borussia Dortmund's relegation worries deepened on Wednesday after their 11th defeat of the season a 1-0 loss at home to 10-man Augsburg kept the ailing German giants rooted to the bottom of the Bundesliga.,"Raul Bobadilla's second-half goal lifted his team up to fourth in the table but left Dortmund -- who in the past four seasons have won two successive titles in 2011 and 2012 and finish runners-up in the subsequent campaigns -- in serious danger of being relegated for the first time since 1972. Augsburg took a deserved lead when veteran Turkish international striker Halil Altintop managed to get his pass away despite the attentions of a posse of Dortmund defenders to leave Bobadilla free to fire home his third goal in as many games on 50 minutes. To add to Borussia's woes, Kevin Grosskreutz joined their lengthy walking wounded list by limping off with a thigh injury. Augsburg were reduced to ten men on 64 minutes when defender Christoph Janker was shown a straight red for hauling down Dortmund's Gabon winger Pierre-Emerick Aubemayang. But Jurgen Klopp's 2013 Champions League finalists failed to make the numerical advantage count to suffer their fourth home defeat of the season. Italy striker Ciro Immobile squandered a golden chance in added time when he headed straight at Augsburg goalkeeper Alexander Manninger. Dortmund are two points adrift of second-from-bottom Stuttgart after they drew 0-0 with Cologne. Bayer Leverkusen moved up to fifth thanks to a 1-0 win at Hertha Berlin, Stefan Kiessling scored the only goal of the game just after the half-time break at the Olympic Stadium. Hamburg moved up to 13th in the table with their first win in five matches with an emphatic 3-0 victory at home to Paderborn. Their captain and Dutch midfielder Raphael van der Vaart opened the scoring after just two minutes when he converted a penalty as left winger Marcell Jansen was fouled in the area. Former Germany squad member Jansen then made sure of the three points when he fired home on 72 minutes before attacking midfielder Zoltan Stieber added their third in the 91st minute. Hamburg's north German neighbours Werder Bremen continued their eyecatching climb up the table to 11th with their third straight win as they claimed a 2-1 victory at Hoffenheim. Bremen took an early lead when ex-Chelsea striker Franco di Santo scored his third goal in his two matches since a knee injury after just eight minutes. Hoffenheim drew level through a header by defender Ermin Bicakcic, only for Philipp Bargfrede to make it 2-1 when he fired home Di Santo's final pass on 52 minutes. Bayern Munich stayed eight points clear at the top of the table despite playing for 70 minutes with 10 men in their 1-1 draw at home to Schalke 04 on Tuesday. Arjen Robben headed Bayern into a second-half lead before Royal Blues captain Benedikt Hoewedes equalised from a corner five minutes later. Pep Guardiola's defending champions were reduced to ten men when Jerome Boatenng was shown a straight red with only 17 minutes gone for fouling Sidney Sam in the area. Second-placed VfL Wolfsburg missed the chance to close the gap behind Bayern when they needed a late Kevin de Bruyne goal to rescue a point in their 1-1 draw at Eintracht Frankfurt."

""He was all for it. He said he saw this as an excellent step for me. ""So it's nice to have an opinion like that behind me."" Schuerrle, who has 42 caps for Germany, is back in the Bundesliga after 19 months at Stamford Bridge having previously played for Mainz 05 and Bayer Leverkusen in Germany's top flight. News of Schuerrle's possible transfer first broke on Friday, but the deal stalled over the weekend before being finalised on Monday, much to Schuerrle's relief. ""I am happy it worked out,"" said the Germany winger, whose cross led to Mario Goetze scoring the winning goal in July's World Cup final. ""The last few days (before the transfer) were very stressful for me. ""I was sitting on my phone the whole time and was just hoping that the call would come to say I can go back to Germany. ""But I was always sure it would work out."" Having joined Chelsea in June 2013, Schuerrle says he values his time working under Blues boss Jose Mourinho, but became frustrated about the amount of time he spent on the Blues' bench. ""I'd never regret it. It was a great experience and I love this club,"" said Schuerrle. ""I developed myself under Jose Mourinho, which has helped me tremendously. ""I am a different player to the one who went to Chelsea. ""I had a good time there, I was a regular in the team before illness made me take a step backwards. ""Even in December, I thought that I wanted to stay with Chelsea, but in the last month things developed so that I came to the conclusion something had to change. ""Then came the interest from Wolfsburg and I quickly realised that I really wanted to go."" Second-placed Wolfsburg host Hoffenheim in the German league on Saturday and coach Dieter Hecking said Schuerrle will be in the squad, but did not say whether he would start."

His signing comes on the back of Wolfsburg's sensational 4-1 win over German champions Bayern Munich -- their first defeat of the league season -- last Friday which saw them narrow the gap between the two sides to eight points. ""Official! World Champion Andre Schuerrle has signed for Wolfsburg,"" the club announced via its' Twitter account. In a statement later published on its' website Wolfsburg said they were delighted to have reached agreement with Chelsea but added both clubs had decided not to say how much the transfer fee was. Schuerrle, who previously played for Mainz and Bayer Leverkusen in the Bundesliga, failed to cement a first team place at Chelsea appearing just 44 times for them since joining in 2013. The reported fee paid for Schuerrle -- who has scored 17 times in his 42 international appearances -- betters the 22 million euros Wolves paid Chelsea for Belgium midfielder Kevin de Bruyne a year ago."

""Time is running out. The chance of it happening are being reduced from hour to hour. ""It is all hanging on money, but we would like to make it happen."" It appears Jose Mourinho's Chelsea are not happy with the proposed transfer fee of 30 million euros ($33.85m) with Wolves eager to offer the Germany international a four-year contract. Schuerrle even sent Wolves coach Dieter Hecking a text on Friday to congratulate him for their shock 4-1 thrashing of league leaders Bayern as Dutch striker Bas Dost and Belgium's Kevin de Bruyne both scored twice. ""We wrote to each other on Friday evening, he congratulated us for our win,"" revealed Hecking. ""Andre has made it public that he wants to come to us, so you can see where the problem is. ""We have set an upper limit and if we don't reach it, it'll be ok, but we're not hell-bent on making this happen."" Schuerrle was not in the Chelsea squad for Saturday's 1-1 Premier League draw with Manchester City and watched the clash from the stands. Should Wolfsburg and Chelsea agree a fee, he could play make his return to the Bundesliga for Wolfsburg at Eintracht Frankfurt on Tuesday. Bayern's Germany star Bastian Schweinsteiger said Friday's result at Wolfsburg's Volkswagen Arena was a good for the whole German league after Bayern had utterly dominated the first half of the season. ""It's super for the Bundesliga,"" said Bayern's stand-in captain with their lead trimmed to eight points. ""You can tell Friday's result meant something. Of course, Wolfsburg are our rivals."" De Bruyne, who is making a name for himself with five league goals and 11 assists this season, said he would welcome seeing Schuerrle in a Wolfsburg shirt. ""Any strengthening of the squad is welcome,"" said the 23-year-old, who also joined from Chelsea."

According to German daily Bild and magazine Kicker, Wolfsburg have agreed terms with Chelsea and the 24-year-old Schuerrle is set to sign a four-year deal. He will be returning to the Bundesliga after spells at Mainz and Leverkusen. Schuerrle is reported to cost Wolves more than 30 million euros ($33.9m), a new club record to better the 22 million Wolves paid Chelsea for Belgium midfielder Kevin de Bruyne a year ago. Wolfsburg paved the way by selling veteran Croatia striker Ivica Olic back to German league strugglers Hamburg in a deal reported to be worth 1.5 million euros with a contract until June 2016. ""I am glad we have found a solution. I think all parties are satisfied. Now I am looking forward playing for Hamburg, this is a new challenge again,"" Olic told Kicker. The hard-working forward played for Hamburg from 2007 until 2009, then spent three years at Bayern Munich before joining Wolves in 2012 and has scored a total of 70 goals in 211 Bundesliga matches. Olic says he only heard about the deal after training with Wolfsburg on Thursday and could start for his new club at home to Cologne on Saturday.

Striker Max Kruse and defender Oscar Wendt put Gladbach 2-0 up at the break before Bremen's dead-ball specialist Zlatko Junuzovic smashed home a second-half free-kick. But Bremen had Luca Caldirola sent off with an hour gone for a second bookable offence before Christoph Kramer and Swedish striker Branimir Hrgota added Gladbach's goals. Bayer Leverkusen drop to fourth on goal difference despite Stefan Kiessling's goal giving them a 1-0 win at Hoffenheim. Eintracht Frankfurt's Alexander Meier rescued his side with two goals in added time to seal a stunning 4-4 draw at home to Hertha Berlin. Hertha were 4-2 up with 90 minutes played before Meier struck to take his tally to a Bundesliga best 12 goals. Schalke are up to fifth after a 2-1 come-back win at Paderborn. On Tuesday, Bayern beat Freiburg 2-0, Netherlands winger Arjen Robben scoring his 100th goal for the German champions. Only a superb display from Freiburg goalkeeper Roman Burki kept the scoreline respectable as Bayern fired in 31 shots on goal -- a Bundesliga record this season. Goals by Robben and Thomas Mueller sealed Bayern's win ahead of their final match of the year at Mainz on Friday. Victory came at a price with defender Mehdi Benatia ruled out with a groin strain. Striker Robert Lewandowski, midfielder Xabi Alonso and Jerome Boateng are all doubts as well having taken knocks during the game."
222,17/12/2014,18:50,Zhang tipped to be Bundesliga's next Asian star,"Chinese international midfielder Zhang Xizhe, whose transfer to Wolfsburg has attracted huge interest back in China, has been tipped to become the Bundesliga's next big Asian star.","The 23-year-old, who has signed for Wolves until 2017, is set to become the fourth Chinese to play in Germany's top flight and one of his predecessors, Shao Jiayi, insists he has all the talent to become a household name in Europe. Shao, who made 168 appearances in Germany's top two divisions for 1860 Munich and Energie Cottbus, is a former team-mate of Zhang at Beijing Guoan, to whom Wolfsburg paid a reported fee of 750,000 euros (US$935,167). ""On the internet, in the newspapers, you read about his transfer everywhere,"" Shao told Bundesliga.com from Beijing. ""Football fans here are absolutely thrilled. It's been a good long while since a Chinese player played for a top side in a big European league. It's massive news. ""He's a really, really good bloke, I know him well, he's a former colleague and a friend. ""He has a very strong will and always had the wish to transfer to a top European team. ""He asked me about the Bundesliga and I gave him positive feedback. ""Of course, the Bundesliga has a totally different class to Chinese football and it will be a big jump. ""The level in Germany is perhaps the highest in the world, but Xizhe has huge potential. He's dynamic, has good technique and is intelligent. ""I think he has the talent, but he'll need some time to adjust."" Zhang is likely to challenge Belgium's Kevin de Bruyne for a place on the left wing and Shao says he is similar to Borussia Dortmund's ex-Manchester United midfielder Shinji Kagawa. ""Wolfsburg have lots of great players like De Bruyne and Aaron Hunt, but Xizhe is a totally different player,"" added Shao. ""He isn't as physical as De Bruyne, but is just as quick and, from my point of view, he's better. ""He's very clever and he is very similar to Shinji Kagawa. ""He is small, mobile and doesn't just think about attack, but works for the whole team."""

Their 1-0 defeat at Hertha Berlin on Saturday saw them slip back into the relegation places and Wolves' boss Hecking is all too aware that they are desperate to climb up from 16th. ""Dortmund are under a lot of pressure, a wounded boxer is not an easy one to fight,"" said Wolfsburg coach Dieter Hecking ahead of Wednesday's clash at Borussia's Signal Iduna Park. ""We will have to produce a top performance to take anything from Dortmund."" Wolfsburg, the 2009 Bundesliga champions, are second in the Bundesliga only to run-away league leaders Bayern Munich and are on course to qualify for the Champions League next season."

Such is the interest at home that China's state broadcaster CCTV will screen Zhang's first press conference live (1030 local time, 1730 in Beijing) to make use of China's primetime viewing market. ""At the peak, between 40 to 50 million viewers are expected,"" said a Wolfsburg press spokesman. Should Zhang successfully transfer his Chinese Super League form to the Bundesliga, Wolfsburg will have signed a bargain. But he will be given an extended period to adjust to the physicality of German football, the culture and the language. ""He is quick and can play in all the positions behind the strikers,"" said Wolfsburg's coach Dieter Hecking. ""But the boy speaks no English and he has to first of all find his feet with us and get used to the level of training."" Zhang arrived in Germany on Saturday and was in the crowd to watch his new team's 1-1 draw against Paderborn on Sunday which left them second in the Bundesliga behind Bayern Munich. Wolves are on course to play in the Champions League next season and the club's website was launched in Chinese on Monday. Zhang has made 10 international appearances for China and scored his first of two international goals in a 6-1 thrashing of Singapore in September 2013. China's Young Player of 2012 will become the only active Chinese player in the German league, but not the first. He will follow in the footsteps of Hao Junmin, who made 14 league appearances for Schalke 04 in 2010 and 2011; Shao Jiayi, who joined 1860 Munich in 2003, then Energie Cottbus in 2006; and striker Yang Chen, who made 65 Bundesliga appearances for Eintracht Frankfurt up until 2001, scoring 16 goals."

With only details of the 23-year-old's transfer from Beijing Guoan to be finalised Zhang is set to officially become a Wolves player in the coming days. China's Young Player of 2012 will become the only active Chinese player in the German league, but not the first. He will follow in the footsteps of Hao Junmin, who made 14 league appearances for Schalke 04 in 2010 and 2011; Shao Jiayi, who joined 1860 Munich in 2003, then Energie Cottbus in 2006; and striker Yang Chen, who made 65 Bundesliga appearances for Eintracht Frankfurt up until 2001, scoring 16 goals. Zhang has already started learning German. Wolfsburg meanwhile are keeping an eye on other talent in Far East football. ""We've been monitoring the (Chinese) league and national team and there are quite a few interesting players there,"" Wolves' director of sport Klaus Allofs told Bundesliga.com. ""Chinese football is still developing, but I'm pretty certain there are plenty of good footballers there. ""It's something that is going to come on in the future. ""With Xizhe, we'll see how he adapts and settles in, then we will see what being a good player in China can translate to in the Bundesliga."" Zhang is unknown outside China, but Wolfsburg are hoping he will be able to transfer his obvious talent to the Bundesliga. Zhang has carved out a reputation as both a goal-scorer and provider. He scored on his Chinese Super League debut in 2010, managing 11 goals with 12 assists in 30 appearances in the 2013 season. He has made 10 international appearances for China and scored his first of two international goals in a 6-1 thrashing of Singapore in September 2013. Making the grade in Germany's top flight is not always easy as New Zealand's Marco Rojas discovered after the A-League's Young Footballer of 2013 joined Stuttgart, but is currently on loan at second division Greuther Fuerth after an injury-hit couple of seasons. But Wolfsburg insist Zhang will be given time to adjust to German football with the Bundesliga set to break for winter next Sunday until Wolves first game of 2015 at home to Bayern Munich. ""He is a young player with a lot of potential,"" said Allofs. ""Even if the leap from China to the Bundesliga is a big one, we have every faith in him being able to manage it. ""Of course we are going to give him all the time he needs."" Wolves, who are on course to play in the Champions League next season, already have official accounts on Chinese social media channels Sina Weibo, Youku and WeChat and are set to launch the club's website in Chinese on Monday."

Zhang, 23, scored six goals in 29 Chinese Super League games for Beijing last season as an attacking midfielder and has been learning German. He was also named in the Chinese Super League's team of the year for 2013 and 2014. ""I have been in contact with Wolfsburg for more than a year,"" said the China international, who was voted the 2012 young player of the year by the Chinese Football Association. ""I have started to learn German and see it as just a matter of time before things get going."" Zhang is set to become the first Chinese player to sign for Wolfsburg and his arrival will help raise the profile of both his new club and their sponsors, car manufacturers Volkswagen, in the Far East. ""He is a young player with plenty of potential to develop and although the jump from China to play in the Bundesliga is big, we trust him to manage it,"" added Allofs. ""Of course, we will give him time to do that."" Wolfsburg, who play Paderborn on Sunday and are second only to Bayern Munich in the German top flight, will launch the club's website in Chinese on Monday. ""We have many fans in China and we want to make sure that with this new facility, they are well informed about the club,"" explained Allofs. The German club, who are on course to play in the Champions League next season for the first time since 2009/10, already have official accounts on Chinese social media channels Sina Weibo, Youku and WeChat."

The defeat sees Gladbach drop to fifth as Lucien Favre's side suffered their third straight defeat, despite having set a new club record of 18 matches unbeaten at the start of the season. Jurgen Klopp's Dortmund remain at the foot of the table after losing 2-0 at Eintracht Frankfurt as last season's runners-up continue to suffer the worst start to a league season in the club's history. Frankfurt captain Alexander Meier claimed his eighth goal of the season to become the league's top scorer when he fired home with five minutes gone after team-mate Marco Russ split the Dortmund defence with a long-range pass. Then a poorly mis-timed header back from defender Matthias Ginter on 78 minutes compounded Dortmund's problems as it allowed Swiss striker Haris Seferovic to beat Borussia goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller in a sprint to tap the ball home. Dortmund are now the only team in Germany's top flight to have lost eight matches this season while Frankfurt climb to ninth, but Klopp insists he has no thoughts of quitting. ""I can understand journalists have such thoughts, but things aren't going that way, I am responsible for what is going on here,"" a visibly dejected Klopp told Sky. ""If it was only a question of luck and a change of coach would make a difference, you only have to call me and I won't stand in the way. ""But as long as no one comes to me and says 'we have someone who can do better', I simply can't leave. ""I am not standing in the way, but I simply can't go until there is a better solution. The responsibility is too big."" Klopp's Dortmund had dropped back to the bottom of the table on Saturday after both Werder Bremen and Stuttgart picked up wins. Werder Bremen's 4-0 hammering of Paderborn and VfB Stuttgart's 4-1 win at Freiburg on Friday saw them both leapfrog Dortmund. Bremen moved up to 14th as caretaker coach Viktor Skripnik picked up his fourth win in five games since taking over from the fired Robin Dutt as Zlatko Junuzovic, Davie Selke, Fin Bartels and Levent Aycicek scored. Pep Guardiola's Bayern maintained their iron grip on the Bundesliga title with a workmanlike 1-0 win at Hertha Berlin on Saturday to recover from their midweek defeat at Manchester City. Arjen Robben's first-half goal in Germany's capital was enough to give Bayern their 10th league win of the season in 13 games. After suffering their first defeat of the season at Manchester in the Champions League on Tuesday, their first loss in 23 games, the defending champions preserved their unbeaten Bundesliga record with a no-frills performance. With six months left of the season, Bayern's march to their third straight Bundesliga title looks virtually unstoppable once again. Both Schalke and Bayer Leverkusen roared back from midweek Champions League defeats by claiming heavy wins to go sixth and third respectively. Schalke responded to their 5-0 Champions League thrashing by Chelsea with a 4-1 hammering of Mainz at home with Dutch striker Klaas-Jan Huntelaar claiming a hat-trick. Netherlands international Huntelaar fired Schalke into a 2-0 lead after just 25 minutes with two superb goals before Japan striker Shinji Okazaki pulled one back for the visitors. But Schalke made sure of the three points when midfielder Tranquillo Barnetta slotted home on 54 minutes before Huntelaar completed his hat-trick. Bayer Leverkusen put their Champions League defeat at home to Monaco behind them with a 5-1 comeback win at the BayArena against Cologne in the Rhine derby as both Josip Drmic and Karim Bellarabi scored twice. Hakan Calhanoglu added his team's other goal. Hoffenheim went seventh in the table after their seven-goal thriller, a 4-3 win over Hanover 96, who drop to eighth, as Niklas Suele headed what proved to be the home side's winner."

Wolfsburg deserved the win, their first after defeats to Schalke in the Bundesliga and Everton in the Europa League, as veteran striker Ivica Olic went close in the second half while Belgium's Kevin de Bruyne also had a goal ruled offside. The result sees Gladbach drop to fifth as Lucien Favre's side suffered their third straight defeat, despite having set a new club record of 18 matches unbeaten at the start of the season. Before Sunday's result, Pep Guardiola's Bayern had extended their lead to 10 points on Saturday with a workmanlike 1-0 win at Hertha Berlin to recover from their midweek defeat at Manchester City.

At the other end, Borussia Dortmund, who are at Eintracht Frankfurt on Sunday night, dropped back to the bottom of the table after both Werder Bremen and Stuttgart picked up wins. Werder Bremen's 4-0 hammering of Paderborn and VfB Stuttgart's 4-1 win at Freiburg on Friday saw them both leapfrog Dortmund.

229,27/11/2014,23:27,British trio through to Europa League knockout stage,"Premier League duo Everton and Tottenham Hotspur both won to clinch qualification for the knockout phase of the Europa League on Thursday, while Celtic also progressed despite losing at home to Salzburg.","The Toffees secured their place in the last 32 as winners of Group H with an impressive 2-0 victory away to Bundesliga high-fliers VfL Wolfsburg in Germany. Tottenham advanced from Group C thanks to a 1-0 win at home to Serbian league leaders Partizan Belgrade and a 3-1 loss to Salzburg in Glasgow could not prevent Celtic from going through with a game to spare. Everton knew halfway through their own game that they were through to the last 32 as news filtered in that the other match in Group H between FC Krasnodar and Lille in Russia had ended in a 1-1 draw. And goals from Belgian duo Romelu Lukaku and Kevin Mirallas secured a handsome victory for the Blues as they extended their unbeaten run to eight matches and guaranteed top spot in the section. ""It was a perfect away performance. Our counter-attacks were lethal and I thought we were outstanding,"" said Everton manager Roberto Martinez. ""Big credit must also go to the back five because keeping a clean sheet here is a fantastic achievement."" Sylvain Distin hit the bar early on for Everton before Ivan Perisic had the ball in the net at the other end only for a wrong offside call to deny Wolfsburg the goal. The visitors then lost James McCarthy to a hamstring injury after only half an hour but Martinez's side opened the scoring two minutes before the interval with a classic counter-attacking goal following a Wolfsburg corner. Mirallas touched the ball into the path of his compatriot Lukaku, who proved too strong for Junior Malanda and too quick for Perisic before finishing in emphatic fashion. And Everton then increased their advantage 15 minutes from time, Lukaku setting up Mirallas for a brilliantly-taken effort. The result means Wolfsburg will be out if they lose in Lille in their final group game in two weeks. Tottenham recorded their third straight win in Group C, beating Partizan at White Hart Lane in a game that was halted for around 10 minutes in the first half due to three separate pitch invasions. Mauricio Pochettino's side secured European football in the new year thanks to a solitary goal by French midfielder Benjamin Stambouli four minutes into the second half. Stambouli got his first goal since his summer move from Montpellier by stabbing home the rebound after a Roberto Soldado shot hit the post. The London club now know that a draw in Istanbul in two weeks against Besiktas -- who have also qualified -- will see them win the group. In a disastrous start, Celtic fell 2-0 behind inside just 13 minutes against already-qualified Salzburg as Brazilian forward Alan netted a brace. Stefan Johansen soon got one back when he connected first-time with Emilio Izaguirre's cross from the left, but the Scottish champions could not find an equaliser and it was game over when Naby Keita headed home in stoppage time. Nevertheless, Astra Giurgiu's 1-0 win against Dinamo Zagreb means that Celtic qualify from Group D regardless and renders their game in Croatia in two weeks meaningless. Elsewhere, Dinamo Moscow beat Panathinaikos 2-1 to secure qualification for the last 32 as winners of Group E. In the same group, Estoril's game at home to PSV Eindhoven will be completed on Friday after being abandoned at half-time due to torrential rain with the Portuguese side leading 3-2. Inter clinched first place in Group F by coming from behind to beat Dnipro 2-1 at the San Siro and fellow Italian side Napoli are also through to the knockout stage after a 0-0 draw away to Sparta Prague in Group I. Feyenoord beat holders Sevilla 2-0 in Rotterdam to progress from Group G while Dynamo Kiev's 2-0 win at home to Rio Ave secured their qualification from Group J and Trabzonspor are through in Group L after beating Metalist Kharkiv 3-1 in Turkey."

And goals from Belgian duo Romelu Lukaku and Kevin Mirallas secured a handsome victory for the Toffees as they extended their unbeaten run to eight matches and guaranteed top spot in the section. Manager Roberto Martinez made four changes to the team that defeated West Ham United at the weekend, with youngster Luke Garbutt, Muhamed Besic, Samuel Eto'o and Aiden McGeady all starting against the Wolves. The hosts had won eight games in a row prior to a defeat to Schalke at the weekend and they were perhaps a little unlucky to lose the game, even if Sylvain Distin hit the bar early on for Everton. Ivan Perisic then had the ball in the net at the other end only for a wrong offside call to deny Wolfsburg the goal, before the visitors lost James McCarthy to a hamstring injury after only half an hour. Martinez's side then opened the scoring two minutes before the interval with a classic counter-attacking goal following a Wolfsburg corner. Mirallas touched the ball into the path of his compatriot Lukaku, who proved too strong for Junior Malanda and too quick for Perisic before finishing in emphatic fashion. Wolfsburg had another goal ruled out in the second half, this time correctly, when Nicklas Bendtner put the ball in the net at a corner. However, McGeady somehow missed the target with the goal gaping and Everton then increased their advantage 15 minutes from time, Lukaku setting up Mirallas for a brilliantly-taken effort. Maximilian Arnold hit the post for Wolfsburg late on while Ross Barkley, on from the bench, had another effort ruled out for offside as Everton claimed a fine victory. The result means Wolfsburg will be out if they lose in Lille in their final group game in two weeks. Elsewhere, Dinamo Moscow beat PSV Eindhoven to secure qualification for the last 32 as winners of Group E. Napoli are also through to the knockout stage after a 0-0 draw away to Sparta Prague in Group I. Rafael Benitez's side are level on points with Sparta and a point above Young Boys but cannot be overtaken by both teams on the final matchday. Dynamo Kiev's 2-0 win at home to Rio Ave secured their qualification from Group J, while Trabzonspor joined Legia Warsaw in qualifying from Group L by beating Metalist Kharkiv 3-1 in Turkey. However, holders Sevilla will still need a point in their last game at home to Rijeka to advance in Group G after going down 2-0 to Feyenoord in Rotterdam. Tottenham Hotspur and Celtic are among the sides looking to seal their places in the last 32 later on Thursday."

Beijing Guoan finished second in last season's Chinese Super League. ""He is a very interesting player and we have been observing him over an extended period of time,"" Allofs told the Wolfsburger Allgemeinen Zeitung newspaper. ""No decision has yet been made, but it could well be that we sign a Chinese player for the first time."" Wolfsburg are second in the Bundesliga and only four points behind leaders Bayern Munich. But Allofs insists they would not be signing Zhang to boost the profile of main sponsors Volkswagen in the lucrative Chinese market. ""That would not be fair to the players,"" he insisted. ""Everyone who we sign must at least have the potential to be competitive in the squad."""

""We have earned a decent starting position which we want to strengthen,"" said Leverkusen's director of sport Rudi Voeller. ""We can work on that in St Petersburg."" Bayer, sixth in the Bundesliga, suffered a blip on Saturday when they lost for the first time in nine games at Hamburg as Rafael van der Vaart's penalty sealed a 1-0 win in a bad-tempered match which saw nine yellow cards. ""The Champions League is a different competition, so this is a completely different game,"" said Voller. ""St Petersburg play football, which is more than Hamburg did."" Due to the time difference, Leverkusen coach Roger Schmidt held his last training session in Leverkusen before flying to Russia. Bayer expect to have Lars Bender fit despite picking up knee and nose injuries in Hamburg. Brazilian defender Wendell is suspended, having been sent off for a second yellow card in the 2-0 win over Zenit a fortnight ago with Croatia teenager Tin Jedvaj expected to take his place at left back. Unlike Leverkusen, St Petersburg warmed-up for Tuesday's match with a 1-0 victory over Champions League side CSKA on Saturday to go seven points clear in the Russian league thanks to Javi García's winning header. ""That was a fantastic performance by us,"" said Villas-Boas. ""The Champions League is going to be a different competition, but we still have the ability to earn seven points regardless of what happens in the other games."""

The 23-year-old de Bruyne was in the thick of things, providing a free-kick for Robin Knoche to head Wolves into a 2-0 lead at the break after Croatia international Ivan Perisic's opening goal for the guests. Belgium's de Bruyne then scored his first goal of the season when he volleyed home from close range on 48 minutes before robbing Moritz Leitner of possession and providing Perisic with his second goal on 88 minutes. The victory leaves Wolves just a point behind leaders Bayern Munich who host Borussia Dortmund in the evening's key clash with 14 points separating the two teams. Jurgen Klopp's Dortmund started the Allianz Arena match in the relegation places having dropped to 16th. A Rafael van der Vaart penalty sealed Hamburg's 1-0 win at home to Bayer Leverkusen which lifted the hosts out of the bottom three and dropped Dortmund into the relegation spots. Hamburg won a bad-tempered affair which saw nine yellow cards -- six were handed out in the first half alone -- after two separate scuffles broke out. Freiburg, who are at Cologne on Sunday, went bottom of the table after Werder Bremen moved up to 17th as caretaker coach Viktor Skripnikas got their first win of the season with ex-Chelsea and Wigan striker Franco di Santo netting both goals in a 2-1 victory ovber Mainz. Mainz took the lead when Japan's Shinji Okazaki scored his sixth league goal of the season to become the Bundesliga's joint top scorer. But Bremen hit back in their first match since Robin Dutt was sacked as di Santos headed home after his penalty attempt was blocked by Mainz goalkeeper Loris Karius just before the half-time break. The Argentina international then claimed his second of the game and sixth of the season when he netted a final pass from Felix Kroos, younger brother of Real Madrid's Germany international Toni Kroos. Hanover 96 went sixth in the table thanks to an own-goal from Eintracht Frankfurt defender Alexander Madlung just two minutes from time sealed a 1-0 victory. Borussia Moenchengladbach can reclaim second and equal the club's 40-year-old record of 17 games unbeaten when they host Hoffenheim, who have also yet to lose this season, on Sunday. On Friday, Roberto di Matteo picked up his third win in four matches as Schalke 04 coach as Klaas-Jan Huntelaar scored their first-half winner in a 1-0 victory at home to Augsburg. The result masked a poor performance from the Royal Blues who have moved up from 12th to seventh in the table since di Matteo took over from Jens Keller."
234,26/10/2014,17:52,Wolves down Mainz to go second in Bundesliga,VfL Wolfsburg went provisionally second in the Bundesliga as they inflicted Mainz's first defeat of the season with a 3-0 win on Sunday.,"Goals by Naldo, Ivan Perisic and Daniel Caliguri gave the hosts the three points and second spot on goal difference from Hoffenheim -- Borussia Moenchengladbach could regain second with a victory or draw over leaders and defending champions Bayern Munich later on Sunday. Wolfsburg -- for whom Belgian playmaker Kevin de Bruyne was outstanding -- took the lead when Brazilian defender Naldo headed home from a corner after only 15 minutes. Mainz's goalkeeper Loris Karius denied De Bruyne when he pushed the former Chelsea midfielder's fierce strike over the bar on 58 minutes, but Wolves' second goal came from the resulting corner. Naldo was again left unmarked in the area and he headed on for Croatian international Perisic to guide his header past Karius from close range. Caliguri made sure of the win on 87 minutes when he tapped home a cross by Belgium Under-21 international Junior Malanda. On Saturday, Borussia Dortmund's horror run of domestic league results continued as a 1-0 defeat -- their fourth successive loss -- by Hanover 96 left them 15th and just a point above the relegation places. They have the daunting task of facing Bayern Munich next Saturday. Dortmund's terrible domestic form is in stark contrast to their Champions League campaign, where they top their group with three straight wins after Wednesday's impressive 4-0 victory at Galatasaray. In a bid to bring their European form to the Bundesliga, Dortmund even had special permission to face Hanover in their Champions League strip, but to no avail. Roberto di Matteo failed to pick up his third straight win as Schalke 04 coach on Saturday evening as the Royal Blues lost 1-0 at ten-man Bayer Leverkusen in the battle between two of Germany's Champions League sides. Turkey midfielder Hakan Calhanoglu settled the matter with a superbly-struck free-kick on 53 minutes although the hosts suffered a blow with the loss of German international midfielder Stefan Reinartz for three months after fracturing an eye socket. Bottom side Werder Bremen sacked coach Robin Dutt on Saturday, less than 24 hours after his side's 1-0 defeat at home to Cologne. The 49-year-old is the third Bundesliga coach casualty this season after Mirko Slomka (from Hamburg) and Jens Keller (Schalke 04). Bremen's Under-23 coach Viktor Skripnik has been appointed as caretaker coach, with ex-Germany midfielder Torsten Frings during the search for Dutt's successor."
235,21/10/2014,13:53,Wolfsburg defender Felipe reveals mini stroke,VfL Wolfsburg's Brazilian defender Felipe says he is determined to return to top-flight football despite revealing in a report on Tuesday that he has suffered from a minor stroke.,"The 27-year-old says only the quick reactions of Wolfsburg's physiotherapist Michele Putaro saved his life after suffering a Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA), often refered to as a mini-stroke, while at home in July as he watched a World Cup match. ""I felt dizzy and knew something wasn't right,"" he told Bild. Felipe contacted Putaro who drove straight to the defenders home and raised the alarm before the Brazilian was rushed to a specialist clinic. ""You can perhaps say that Michele saved my life,"" said the centre-back who has played in the Bundesliga for both Wolfsburg and Stuttgart after spending five years at Portugal's Nacional. ""I didn't have a clue in that moment what was the matter with me. ""It was only a few days later that we knew what had happened."" The attack, caused by a lack of blood flow in a part of his brain, left Felipe with a weakness on his left side, which has since been cured, but he still has a problem with his left eye. The blood-thinning tablets he currently needs to take means top-level sport is out of the question for the immediate future. ""Of course, it's not good that I have to take a long break from football, but the most important thing is to be healthy,"" he said. ""I am certain that I will return to professional football,"" he said. ""There is no reason for me not to believe in my comeback on the pitch."""
236,05/10/2014,17:37,Wolfsburg down Augsburg to move into top six,Wolfsburg went sixth in the Bundesliga on Sunday after defender Naldo sealed a 1-0 win over Augsburg while ex-Chelsea midfielder Kevin de Bruyne was involved in a bizarre booking.,"A superb strike from 13 metres out from ex-Selecao defender Naldo on 58 minutes sealed Wolves' win which moved Dieter Hecking's side up the table. But the highlight of the first-half was Tobias Werner's bizarre booking on 32 minutes for mimmicking a kick at Wolfsburg's De Bruyne only to earn a yellow card when his right boot flew off and hit the Belgium and former Chelsea midfielder. On Sunday night, Borussia Moenchengladbach host Mainz 05 with both sides battling it out to claim second place behind leaders Bayern Munich, who went four points clear at the top of the table on Saturday with a 4-0 romp against Hanover 96. Striker Robert Lewandowski and Arjen Robben both netted twice and Bayern dominated despite having Thomas Mueller and World Cup winner Mario Goetze on the bench, plus Germany star Bastian Schweinsteiger injured. Pep Guardiola's high-flying Bayern have now gone seven games without conceding a goal. In contrast, Borussia Dortmund's dramatic domestic slump continued as they dropped to 13th in the table after their 1-0 defeat at home to Hamburg and are winless in their last four league games. Along with Schalke and Bayer Leverkusen, Dortmund suffered a Champions League hangover and were a shadow of Wednesday's impressive 3-0 win at Anderlecht in Europe as Hamburg enjoyed only their first victory of the season. This was Hamburg's fourth victory over Dortmund in their last five meetings to leave Klopp's side two points above the relegation zone as Pierre-Michel Lasogga's 35th-minute goal proved to be the winner. Ten-man Schalke also suffered an afternoon to forget after drawing 1-1 with Maribor in the Champions League on Wednesday as they went down 2-1 at Hoffenheim, who moved up to second in the table. Schalke finished with 10 men after Cameroon's Joel Matip was shown a second yellow and subsequent red before Klaas-Jan Huntelaar scored a late consolation goal. Bayer Leverkusen dropped to fourth after drawing 2-2 at home to ten-man Paderborn. Frankfurt moved up to fifth with a 3-2 comeback win at home to Cologne as captain Alexander Maier scored twice before an own goal by Cologne goalkeeper Timo Horn sealed the win which leaves Eintracht unbeaten in their last four games. Werder Bremen took Hamburg's place at the bottom of the Bundesliga in 18th place after being held to a 1-1 draw at home to Freiburg, who are 15th, just out of the relegation places. On Friday, Hertha Berlin enjoyed only their second league win of the season with a 3-2 victory at home to VfB Stuttgart with Ivory Coast's Salomon Kalou scoring twice."
237,22/08/2014,23:33,Bayern enjoy winning start to German title defence,Reigning German champions Bayern Munich got the new Bundesliga season off to a perfect start with a dramatic 2-1 win over VfL Wolfsburg on Friday.,"Pep Guardiola's side looked sluggish early on at the Allianz Arena but took the lead after 37 minutes when Thomas Mueller poked home from Arjen Robben's cross. The home side seemed in control when Robben scored just 67 seconds into the second half before a superb strike from Ivica Olic gave the visitors hope. And Wolfsburg, who finished fifth last season, missed a glorious chance to steal a point when substitute Junior Malanda somehow missed from a yard out with 11 minutes remaining. ""We didn't have the ideal preparation,"" Robben said. ""We had a lot of players at the World Cup until the end, who haven't trained much, and a lot of injuries. ""But that can't be used as an excuse. We have a super squad -- the three points were the most important thing today."" The visitors, who finished fifth last season, left with plenty of regrets. ""To concede the second goal right at the start of the second half was tough,"" Olic said. ""But then we scored and after that I thought we played well. Kevin (De Bruyne) and Junior (Malanda) had really good chances and when you don't take your chances here, you won't get any points."" Guardiola went into the game without injured midfielders Franck Ribery, Bastian Schweinsteiger, Thiago and Javi Martinez as well as suspended defender Jerome Boateng. The Spaniard responded by handing 17-year-old Gianluca Gaudino a first Bundesliga start. Gaudino lined up in central midfield alongside David Alaba, one of only three players who made their league debut for Bayern at a younger age. Former Bayern midfielder Luiz Gustavo started in midfield for the visitors, who handed Bundesliga debuts to new signings Sebastian Jung, Joshua Guilavogui and Aaron Hunt. After a slow start, Mueller and Robben shot straight at visiting goalkeeper Max Grun, who was standing in for Wolfsburg captain Diego Benaglio. Bayern thought they had made the breakthrough 28 minutes in when Robert Lewandowski tapped in from Robben's pass across goal but the Dutch winger was rightly flagged offside. The home side were beginning to get on top and Lewandowski was denied again when Grun recovered well after fumbling Mueller's close-range effort. The Wolves keeper made an even better save moments later. Gaudino's clipped ball into the box was acrobatically steered towards goal by Lewandowksi, but Grun clawed the ball away from the top corner. Wolfsburg were camped in their own half and an inevitable goal for Bayern arrived after 37 minutes. Robben turned Gustavo inside out down the right and his low ball across the face of goal was prodded home by Mueller. Bayern then made a blistering start to the second half when Robben dispossessed Guilavogui. The home team broke at pace, with Mueller and a deft touch from Lewandowski setting Robben free to tuck home from inside the box. After 52 minutes, Wolfsburg pulled a goal back out of the blue. Olic got away from Holger Badstuber on the edge of the box before curling a first-time effort in off the underside of the bar. Lewandowski failed to make the most of a good opening shortly afterwards and Bayern almost got punished towards the end. Substitute Maximilian Arnold delivered a perfect left-wing cross to pick out Malanda, whose goalbound effort was deflected on to the bar by Manuel Neuer. The rebound fell to Malanda, practically on the goal line, but the Belgian midfielder was taken by surprise and shinned the ball wide. Bayern substitute Sebastian Rode had a goal ruled off for offside and Robben hit the bar late on as the two-time defending champions finished strongly."

239,20/08/2014,18:08,Switzerland goalkeeper Benaglio announces retirement,"Switzerland goalkeeper Diego Benaglio announced his international retirement on Wednesday, saying that he wanted to concentrate on his club career with German side Wolfsburg.","""Firstly, at the age of 31, I'm no longer the youngest player and I want to put more focus on my club, and secondly, I want to spend more time with my family,"" Benaglio said in a statement issued by the Swiss Football Association. Benaglio has won up 61 caps since making his debut in 2006, and rapidly earned his berth as first-choice 'keeper after the 2008 retirement of Pascal Zuberbuehler. ""I'm in good shape, but once you're over 30, you need just a little bit more time to recover than you used to,"" said Benaglio, who played at the World Cup in Brazil this summer. Wolfsburg face a match-packed Bundesliga, German Cup and Europa League season. ""This hasn't been an easy decision for me. The Swiss team has developed in fine fashion, and we have a great group with an excellent atmosphere,"" he said. ""But that's also the reason that I don't feel that I'm abandoning the team. Switzerland has a rising generation of quality 'keepers, especially when you look at Swiss goalies in the Bundesliga,"" he added. Among Switzerland's other goalkeepers who ply their trade at German clubs are Augsburg's Marwin Hitz, Freiburg's Roman Buerki, and Yann Sommer of Moenchengladbach. The Swiss have spent the past decade and a half working on a youth development strategy that has won them plaudits and paid dividends. They have put on solid displays on the international stage, most recently at the World Cup, where they reached their target of the round of 16, only exiting due to an extra-time goal by Argentina. They are now eyeing a slot at Euro 2016 in France, and take on England at home in the qualifiers on September 8. Switzerland's new manager Vladimir Petkovic, who took the helm after veteran Ottmar Hitzfeld bowed out after the World Cup, had recently said that Benaglio remained his prime goalkeeping choice. He said that he regretted the player's decision but understood that it had been carefully weighed up. ""Diego has enough experience to know the responsiblity he is taking for his decision. For me, it's now a matter of looking forward. Fortunately, we have other quality alternatives for the position,"" Petkovic said."
240,19/08/2014,02:05,Germany riding crest of wave as Bundesliga begins,The new Bundesliga season gets underway this weekend with German football riding the crest of a wave following the national team's triumph at the World Cup in Brazil last month.,"That thoroughly deserved victory, given to Joachim Loew's side by Mario Goetze's extra-time strike in the final against Argentina, saw a unified Germany crowned as world champions for the first time. But at club level, the Bundesliga has been leading the way for some time. It averaged 3.16 goals per game last season, considerably more than any of its major European counterparts, while average gates were over 42,000, making the German top flight the best attended league anywhere. ""In my opinion, the Bundesliga's the most attractive league in the world,"" Borussia Moenchengladbach coach Lucien Favre told bundesliga.com. ""The hype in Germany is amazing, and now they've won the World Cup so it's not going to tail off in a rush."" Nevertheless, the biggest problem facing the Bundesliga, as ever, is how to counter the dominance of Bayern Munich, who have romped to the title and added the German Cup in each of the last two campaigns. They have seen Toni Kroos and Mario Mandzukic depart and lost Javi Martinez to a serious knee injury in last week's SuperCup defeat to Borussia Dortmund, but the Bavarians remain favourites. And yet the rest can draw some hope from the very fact this is a Bundesliga season immediately following a World Cup, and that has not tended to help Bayern in the recent past. After Germany hosted the 2006 World Cup, Stuttgart went on to win the Bundesliga, while in 2011 Dortmund pipped Bayern to the title. In 2009, after Germany reached the Euro 2008 final, it was Wolfsburg who were champions. Six members of Pep Guardiola's squad played in the World Cup final, including Goetze, while Dante and Arjen Robben were also involved until the latter stages in Brazil. That is why chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge wanted the start of the new season delayed in order to give these players longer to prepare, but that request was unsurprisingly turned down by Bayern's rivals. ""We have to face the fact that the first half of the season will be difficult,"" said Guardiola, who at times had only a skeleton squad in pre-season training. ""We are at least one month behind schedule."" Guardiola has added to his squad with compatriots Juan Bernat from Valencia and Pepe Reina, who will provide competition in goal for Manuel Neuer. But the marquee signing was Robert Lewandowski, a prolific goalscorer for Dortmund in the last four years. However, Dortmund have moved to replace the Pole by signing Italy striker Ciro Immobile from Torino and Colombia's Adrian Ramos from Hertha Berlin. Stability is key at the Signal Iduna Park, where coach Jurgen Klopp, who led Dortmund to back-to-back titles in 2011 and 2012 and a Champions League final defeat to Bayern in 2013, is entering his seventh season in charge. ""We want to establish ourselves further at the top of the league and qualify directly for the Champions League,"" said sporting director Michael Zorc modestly. However, Guardiola knows where the danger lies, saying: ""We may have won the last two league titles, but they clinched the previous two. Our great challenge is to keep up our level to keep them at distance."" Beneath them, Schalke, Bayer Leverkusen and Wolfsburg will again be hoping to contend for Champions League qualification at least. Schalke have kept Klaas-Jan Huntelaar and Julian Draxler, while Sidney Sam has joined from Leverkusen, and few teams can boast a midfield as strong as Wolfsburg, with Kevin de Bruyne, Luiz Gustavo and France's Josuha Guilavogui. Bayer have signed Swiss striker Josip Drmic from Nuremberg and have a new coach in Roger Schmidt, back in his native country after winning the Austrian title with Salzburg. Hamburg will be hoping for a stable campaign after almost being relegated for the first time in their history last season. There are new coaches at Mainz, Eintracht Frankfurt and Stuttgart, who have reappointed Armin Veh, the architect of their 2007 title triumph, while Cologne are back among the elite and Paderborn are in the Bundesliga for the first time."
241,15/08/2014,13:10,Wolfsburg sign up Bendtner,"Danish striker Nicklas Bendtner, released by Arsenal at the end of last season, has joined Wolfsburg, the Bundesliga club announced on Friday.","Bendtner, 26, played only nine games for Arsenal last season after returning to the Premier League club following extended loan spells with Birmingham City, Sunderland and Italian champions Juventus. Capped 56 times by Denmark, Bendtner has scored 24 international goals since making his debut as an 18-year-old in 2006. He becomes Wolfsburg's second major signing of the close season in the last week after the club secured the two-year loan signing of French international midfielder Josuha Guilavogui from Atletico Madrid. Wolfsburg, German champions in 2009, kick off their season away to reigning champions Bayern Munich next week."
242,10/06/2014,03:15,Football: World Cup Group F - keeping up with Argentina,At first glance Group F looks like a one-horse race with Lionel Messi leading Argentina and a competitive challenge for second.,"Argentina have by far the best pedigree with Messi, Gonzalo Higuain, Sergio Aguero and Angel di Maria forming one of the most feared attacks. If anyone can challenge Brazil, it is surely their neighbours who have won the cup twice. They dominated South American qualifying leading up to the Brazil tournament and Messi has now replaced Diego Maradona as his country's leading scorer. Argentina's defence can let them down, the team have not reached the semi-finals since 1990, and World Cups have a habit of uncovering sudden pot-holes. But it would be a major surprise if Alejandro Sabella's team does not win Group F. In their wake, the likes of Nigeria, Iran and debutants Bosnia can all realistically dream of making the knock-out stages. Argentina's World Cups have a habit of uncovering sudden pot-holes, but it would be a major surprise if the twice former winners did not reach the last 16, most probably by winning their group. In terms of ability and recent form, Bosnia would appear to be their prime challengers, boosted by the likes of Manchester City striker Edin Dzeko and Roma playmaker Miralem Pjanic. But this is unchartered territory for the former Yugoslav republic who are competing in their first ever major championship. However, they had been getting mighty close over the last few years, losing a two-legged play-off to Portugal for both the 2010 World Cup in South Africa and the 2012 Euros in Poland and Ukraine. Now they have finally made it to a major tournament, Bosnia have the players to reach the knock-out stages. However, the true question is whether or not they have the experience, confidence and cool heads needed to get a result against the Nigerians and Iran. Nigeria are the most experienced of the trio having qualified for the World Cup all but once (in 2006) since making their bow in 1994 in the United States, where they helped eliminate Argentina in the pool stages before exiting in the last 16. That was their best ever performance alongside a similar showing in France four years later. Like Bosnia, they can count on several players from top European leagues, including Premier League quintet Victor Moses, Peter Odemwingie, John Obi Mikel, Joseph Yobo and Shola Ameobi. And coach Stephen Keshi has stamped his authority on a Nigerian squad long riven by personality clashes. Iran must be viewed as the outsiders as in three previous appearances, they have never made it out of the group stages and have won only one out of nine matches. Coach Carlos Queiroz has also turned to expatriates in European leagues. Ashkan Dejagah last month suffered relegation from the English Premier League with Fulham. Iranian-born but brought up in Germany, Dejagah won the German Bundesliga with VfL Wolfsburg in 2009. The Iranian forward line also includes Reza Ghoochannejhad of Charlton Athletic in England, Alireza Jahanbakhsh of Dutch side NEC and Masoud Shojaei of Las Palmas in Spain."

""We are pleased that we were able to sign an experienced player, who has demonstrated his skills over the last few years in the Bundesliga,"" said Eintracht's director of sport Bruno Huebner. ""We wish him lots of success at the World Cup and that he leads his team as far as possible."" Having switched from VfL Wolfsburg to Nuremberg last September, Hasebe endured an injury-hit single season as Nuremberg failed to escape the drop. He was only able to make 14 appearances for the Franconian club with a knee injury before making his return for the final match of the season. Hasebe has been in the national team since 2006, making 78 appearances for Japan, who are in Group C and open their World Cup campaign against Ivory Coast on Sunday June 15 in Recife."
244,27/05/2014,15:58,Football: Germany midfielder Hunt signs for Wolfsburg,"Germany midfielder Aaron Hunt has joined Europa League side VfL Wolfsburg on a three-year deal after 13 years at Werder Bremen, his new club announced on Tuesday.","The 27-year-old, who has three international caps, signed for Werder as a junior and has switched clubs on a free transfer. ""I was with Bremen for a long time, achieved many things with Werder and had some really great years, but this was the time to try something new,"" said Hunt, with Wolfsburg only 150 kilometres (93 miles) south of Bremen. He is set to link up with Belgium midfielder Kevin de Bruyne and Brazil's Luiz Gustavo as Wolves target a return to the Champions League for 2015/2016 after finishing fifth last season in the Bundesliga and just missing out on a place. Hunt, a defensive midfielder, has not been chosen in Joachim Loew's squad for next month's World Cup. He made his last appearance for Germany in May 2013 on a two-match tour of the USA. He becomes the second Germany international to join Wolves after right-back Sebastian Jung switched from Eintracht Frankfurt last week. ""Despite being only 27 and having collected a lot of experience, Aaron is a player who can improve on the high levels he sets for himself,"" said Wolfsburg's team manager Klaus Allofs. Hunt opted for Wolfsburg despite offers from Italy, England, Russia and Turkey and has scored 46 goals for Werder in 215 Bundesliga appearances."

""Naldo is an absolute top performer and player who leads,"" said Wolfsburg's club manager Klaus Allofs. ""He has shown over the course of the season how important he is to our team. ""With his experience and personality, he is an important contact point for our younger players."" Having finished fifth in the Bundesliga, Wolfsburg will play in the Europa League next season and have ambitions to play in the Champions League again having last qualified in 2009. ""I want to have more success with VfL   Wolfsburg,"" said Naldo, who has made four appearance for Brazil, but has not been included in their 30-man provisional World Cup squad. ""There has been a huge amount of trust shown in me here and I want to reward that with success."""
246,07/05/2014,15:16,Football: Schuster tempted by Frankfurt post,Malaga coach Bernd Schuster has thrown his hat into the ring to take over from Armin Veh as Eintracht Frankfurt coach.,"Schuster was quoted in daily newspaper Bild on Wednesday as saying he would like the job next season. ""Yes, I'm attracted by Frankfurt (but) I don't know if I'm in first, second or third position on the list,"" said the 54-year-old. Schuster is currently under contract with Malaga until 2018 but is believed to have an escape clause. According to Bild, Schuster received a visit from Frankfurt officials on May 1. The former Real Madrid and Barcelona player, who won the European Championships with Germany in 1980, started his managerial career with Cologne before moving to Spain. There he reached the Cup final with Getafe in 2007 before guiding Real to the La Liga crown a year later. Despite that success he lasted only 18 months at Real and managed Besiktas in Turkey for less than a season before re-emerging at Malaga at the start of this campaign. German press believe former Chelsea manager Roberto Di Matteo is another in the reckoning to take over at Frankfurt. Having begun his coaching career at MK Dons and then West Bromwich Albion, Di Matteo guided Chelsea to Champions League and FA Cup trophies in 2012, before being fired later that year. Swiss-born Di Matteo, 43, already speaks German, something Frankfurt owner Heribert Bruchhagen tolds weekly paper Sport Bild was essential. Veh, 53, joined Hamburg in 2011 but has already stated he will leave at the end of the season, with the club sitting 13th, one match from the end of the season. Veh won the Bundesliga with Stuttgart in 2007 and then had spells with VfL Wolfsburg and Hamburg before joining Frankfurt."

248,28/04/2014,14:45,Football: Season over for Leverkusen's Kiessling,Bayer Leverkusen must do without injured striker Stefan Kiessling in their bid to qualify for a place in next season's Champions League after the Germany international tore his left hamstring.,"Kiessling will miss Leverkusen's last two league games of the season with the 'Werkself' holding onto fourth in the league, which carries a Champions League play-off berth, by just a point from VfL Wolfsburg. Bayer crashed out of this season's Champions League with a 6-1 aggregate defeat at the hands of Paris St Germain in the last 16 and fired coach Sami Hyypia earlier this month after a run of defeats in a bid to protect their status in next season's competition. The loss of Kiessling is a blow to their hopes under caretaker coach Sascha Lewandowski with a fortnight left in the season. The 30-year-old suffered the injury in Leverkusen's 2-2 draw at home to second-placed Borussia Dortmund on Saturday and a scan confirmed the worst, meaning he will miss his side's final two matches, at home to Eintracht Frankfurt and away to Werder Bremen. Having made his last international appearance at the 2010 World Cup, Kiessling was the Bundesliga's top-scorer last season with 25 goals in 34 league games and has hit the net 19 times for Bayer this season."
249,27/04/2014,19:31,Football: Defeat leaves Hamburg deep in relegation mire,Former European champions Hamburg remain in danger of being relegated from the Bundesliga for the first time in their history after losing 3-1 away to Augsburg on Sunday.,"They were three goals down inside 42 minutes as Turkey striker Halil Altintop scored a brace and Andre Hahn added another goal for the hosts, and Heiko Westermann's reply just before the interval proved to be a mere consolation for HSV. Hamburg won the European Cup in 1983 but have not won any major honours since 1987, and now their status as the only club in Germany's top flight never to have been relegated is under serious threat with only two games of the season remaining. Mirko Slomka's side lie 16th in the table, only a point clear of the automatic relegation places and with a home game against reigning European champions Bayern Munich and a tricky trip to Mainz still to come. Should Hamburg remain third from bottom, they will earn a reprieve in the form of a two-legged play-off against the side which finishes third in the second tier for the right to play top-flight football next season. Borussia Dortmund, who drew 2-2 with Bayer Leverkusen on Saturday, will finish the season second to Bayern for the second year running after third-placed Schalke lost 1-0 at home to Borussia Moenchengladbach on Sunday. A first-half strike from winger Patrick Herrmann gave Gladbach the win in Gelsenkirchen which left Schalke in third and seven points adrift of neighbours Dortmund with two games left. On Saturday, Bayern Munich warmed up for Tuesday's Champions League semi-final second leg at home to Real Madrid with a 5-2 come-from-behind win against Werder Bremen. Three days after their 1-0 first-leg loss in Madrid, Bayern fell behind twice against Bremen at the Allianz Arena before scoring four second-half goals without reply. The flattering scoreline failed to mask Bayern's woeful first-half defending, which must sound the alarm bells for coach Pep Guardiola given the danger of conceding an away goal to Real. Bayern have conceded the first goal in seven of their nine matches since winning the Bundesliga title late last month with a record seven matches to spare. Once again the Munich defence was left wanting in the first 45 minutes before the reigning European champions roared back. Bayern blasted Werder 7-0 in Bremen last December, but Czech defender Theodor Gebre Selassie fired the visitors into a 1-0 lead after 10 minutes at the Allianz Arena. France winger Franck Ribery equalised before Aaron Hunt capitalised on some poor marking for Bremen's second to make it 2-1 at the break. Bayern equalised again when Thomas Mueller headed on Ribery's corner and Claudio Pizarro was on hand to stab home his shot to make it 2-2 on 54 minutes, then the Peru veteran added his second against his old club four minutes later. Bastian Schweinsteiger then powered home a header on 61 minutes before Arjen Robben hit the top corner of the net to make it 5-2 on 74 minutes, less than 60 seconds after coming off the bench. On Saturday night Dortmund drew 2-2 at fourth-placed Bayer Leverkusen with all four goals coming in the first 45 minutes. Goals by Lars Bender and Gonzalo Castro for the hosts were cancelled out by a header from Dortmund's Oliver Kirch and a Marco Reus penalty following a clear handball from Bayer defender Roberto Hilbert.

Hamburg won the European Cup in 1983 but have not won any major honours since 1987, and now their status as the only club in Germany's top flight never to have been relegated is under serious threat with only two games of the season remaining. Mirko Slomka's side lie 16th in the table, only a point clear of the automatic relegation places and with a home game against reigning European champions Bayern Munich and a tricky trip to Mainz still to come. Should Hamburg remain third from bottom, they will earn a reprieve in the form of a two-legged play-off against the side which finishes third in the second tier for the right to play top-flight football next season. On Saturday, Bayern Munich warmed up for Tuesday's Champions League semi-final second leg at home to Real Madrid with a 5-2 come-from-behind win against Werder Bremen. Three days after their 1-0 first-leg loss in Madrid, Bayern fell behind twice against Bremen at the Allianz Arena before scoring four second-half goals without reply. The flattering scoreline failed to mask Bayern's woeful first-half defending, which must sound the alarm bells for coach Pep Guardiola given the danger of conceding an away goal to Real. Bayern have conceded the first goal in seven of their nine matches since winning the Bundesliga title late last month with a record seven matches to spare. Once again the Munich defence was left wanting in the first 45 minutes before the reigning European champions roared back.

259,19/04/2014,20:42,Football: Below-par Bayern end league slump as Real loom,"Bayern Munich ended a run of three Bundesliga games without victory in Saturday's unimpressive 2-0 win at bottom club Eintracht Braunschweig, four days before their Champions League semi-final at Real Madrid.","Peru veteran Claudio Pizarro, 35, and Croatian striker Mario Mandzukic were on target with late goals in what was only Bayern's third win in their last seven games in all competitions. Despite enjoying their customary 65 percent possession and fielding a near full-strength team, Bayern needed 76 minutes to breach the Braunschweig defence with the hosts battling to preserve their top-flight status. The breakthrough came when Mario Goezte found Pizarro and he scored Bayern's first goal in their last three league games. With the Braunschweig defence tiring, Mandzukic grabbed their second three minutes from time as Bayern won their first league match since winning the title nearly four weeks ago with a record seven games to spare. But just as they were in recent consecutive defeats to Augsburg and Borussia Dortmund, Bayern looked lethargic, despite coach Pep Guardiola's pre-match wish for a polished performance to take a ""good feeling"" to Madrid. ""It's not easy for us after winning the German title, but we fought despite a difficult situation"" said Guardiola. ""Braunschweig fought with heart and passion, which didn't make life easy for us. ""We had the game under more control after the break and I'm happy with the win. ""But we won't reach the Champions League final unless we put in a commanding performance against Real Madrid."" Bayern were without Manchester United-target Toni Kroos and Rafinha, who were both suspended, while left-back David Alaba was missing with a cold. Germany goalkeeper Manuer Neuer sat out the trip to Braunschweig as he recovers from a calf injury with reserve shot-stopper Lukas Raeder stepping in for the third time. The victory leaves Bayern on 81 points and 17 points clear of second-placed Dortmund who picked up their fifth straight win. Borussia enjoyed a 4-2 victory at home to ten-man Mainz 05 as coach Jurgen Klopp faced his former side having coached them from 2001-08. Dortmund took the lead after just six minutes through a curious goal when Milos Jojic's strike went in off the upper arm of Borussia's Oliver Kirch, but despite furious protests the goal stood. Japan striker Shinji Okazaki scored twice for Mainz to make it 2-2, his second after pouncing on a terrible back pass from Dortmund's Nuri Sahin. The Japanese international scoring either side of Bayern-bound Robert Lewandowski's strike for Dortmund. Dortmund made sure of the three points, which confirmed their Champions League direct qualification, with goals by defender Lukasz Piszczek and Germany winger Marco Reus, who converted a penalty 12 minutes from time after Mainz had centre-back Niko Bungert sent off for a handball. Ten-man VfL Wolfsburg took a step towards a Champions League berth with a 3-1 win at relegation-threatened Hamburg to leapfrog Bayer Leverkusen into fourth place. Goals by Ivan Perisic, Kevin de Bruyne and Ivica Olic gave Wolves a 3-0 lead just after the break before Hamburg's Ivo Ilicevic scored a consolation for the hosts who remain third from bottom. Wolves were reduced to ten men when Brazil midfielder Luiz Gustavo was sent off for a second yellow card on 90 minutes. Hamburg have just three games left to escape the bottom three as they face an historic first relegation from Germany's top flight. Leverkusen can regain fourth place when they visit second-from-bottom Nuremberg on Sunday. At the other end of the table, Freiburg are virtually assured of their survival as their 4-2 win at home to ten-man Borussia Moenchengladbach left them eight points above the relegation places with three games left. Likewise, Werder Bremen are set to stay in the Bundesliga as their 3-1 win at home to Hoffenheim lifted them up to 11th and nine points from danger while mid-table Hertha Berlin and Augsburg shared the points in a goalless draw."
260,18/04/2014,02:20,Football: Bayern eager for Real Madrid confidence boost,Bayern Munich need a convincing win at Bundesliga bottom side Eintracht Braunschweig on Saturday to dismiss talk of a mini-crisis ahead of their Champions League semi-final at Real Madrid.,"With only two wins in their last six games, Bayern have suffered a dip since winning the Bundesliga nearly a month ago with a record seven games to spare. Bayern booked their place in next month's German Cup final with a 5-1 drubbing of second division Kaiserslautern in Wednesday's semi-final in Munich. But Munich's director of sport Matthias Sammer said while the scoreline was impressive, the performance was lacking spark. Bayern have lost back-to-back league matches, an obvious concern ahead of Wednesday's Champions League semi-final, first leg at Real Madrid. ""I had the feeling that we're not really running hot at the moment,"" said Sammer, who questioned Bayern's desire to win the Champions League and German Cup finals. ""For the tasks we are facing, that's not enough. We have to ask ourselves if we still want to win these two titles."" On paper, Bayern's trip to Braunschweig looks straightforward, but the hosts have picked up seven points in their last four games to boost their survival bid. Braunschweig are without injured captain and striker Domi Kumbela, a rich source of goals for them in recent weeks, and are just three points from safety. Bayern will be without right-back Rafinha, who is serving a three-match ban after being sent off in last Saturday's 3-0 league defeat at home to Borussia Dortmund. There is also a question mark over Germany goalkeeper Manuel Neuer who missed the mid-week game with a calf strain. It remains to be seen whether coach Pep Guardiola rests his squad or looks for some continuity by naming a strong team four days before the trip to Real. Second-placed Borussia Dortmund host Mainz looking to pick up their fifth straight win having booked their German Cup final berth against Bayern on May 17. Dortmund enjoyed a 2-0 win over Wolfsburg in Tuesday's semi-final but both goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller (groin) and striker Robert Lewandowski (thigh) are carrying knocks. Lewandowski scored his 100th goal for Dortmund against Wolfsburg, but his final match in the black and yellow jersey will be against future employers Bayern in the cup final. Seventh-placed Mainz 05 now find themselves in a Europa League spot due to both cup finalists Dortmund and Bayern having qualified directly for next season's Champions League. A few shock results can be expected in the last four weeks of the season with sides desperate for points in the lower half of the table set to surprise those higher up. A good example is Saturday evening's tie when relegation-threatened Hamburg host VfL Wolfsburg, who are just a point off a Champions League berth for next season. Hamburg are the only team in Germany's top-flight to have never been relegated and have just four games left to escape the bottom three. Hamburg coach Mirko Slomka is without centre-back Heiko Westermann who has a groin injury. Wolves are without defensive midfielder Junior Malanda who tore knee ligaments in Tuesday's cup defeat at Dortmund. There will be a similar points battle when Nuremberg host Bayer Leverkusen on Sunday with the visitors eager to hold off Wolves and stay fourth. Second-from-bottom Nuremberg are two points from safety, but have lost their last three games. Likewise, Leverkusen have fragile confidence with only two wins in their last 13 matches despite their fourth place and fired coach Sami Hyypia a fortnight ago.

Goals by Bastian Schweinsteiger, Toni Kroos, Thomas Mueller, Mario Mandzukic and Mario Goetze saw Bayern go through to the May 17 final at Berlin's Olympic Stadium. Bayern, who wrapped up this season's Bundesliga title with a record seven games to spare, will face Dortmund, who shocked Bayern 3-0 in Munich in the league last Saturday, in a repeat of last season's Champions League final. Pep Guardiola's Bayern had few problems against the 'Red Devils' of Kaiserslautern, but director of sport Matthias Sammer was unimpressed with the performance ahead of next Wednesday's Champions League semi-final at Real Madrid. ""I have the feeling that we're not really burning hot at the moment,"" complained Sammer with Bayern making no secret of their desire to win the German Cup and Champions League to repeat last year's feat of winning a treble of titles. ""For the matches we have coming up, that's not enough. ""We have to ask ourselves whether we really want these two titles."" Bayern needed just 24 minutes to take the lead when Germany midfielder Schweinsteiger headed home an Arjen Robben corner having earlier hit the crossbar. Kroos doubled the hosts' lead at the Allianz Arena on 32 minutes to make it 2-0 at the break. Robben won a penalty five minutes into the second half when he was fouled by Kaiserslautern defender Chris Loewe and Mueller fired home the spot-kick. Kaiserslautern striker Simon Zoller headed a consolation goal on the hour mark, with his side surviving on less than 30 percent possession, before Mandzukic netted the hosts' fourth to end any hopes of a fight-back. The Croatia international, who scored a hat-trick in the 5-0 quarter-final drubbing of Hamburg, converted a Goetze cross on 78 minutes. Goetze then tapped home Bayern's fifth just before the final whistle as the attacking midfielder beat Kaiserslautern's off-side trap. On Tuesday, Poland striker Robert Lewandowski hit his 100th goal for Dortmund as they beat VfL Wolfsburg 2-0 in the other semi-final. The 25-year-old has vowed to leave the club having delivered silverware this season and faces his future employers Bayern in the Berlin final. Lewandowski, who will join the Bavarian giants at the end of the season, scored a hat-trick in the 2012 Cup final when Dortmund routed Bayern 5-2. Dortmund took an early lead against the Wolves when midfielder Henrikh Mkhitaryan cut in from the right and unleashed a superb shot just inside the near post on 12 minutes. With half-time approaching, Belgium Under-21 international Junior Malanda hit the post for Wolfsburg and compatriot Kevin de Bruyne fired the rebound wide for the visitors. It was a costly miss as Dortmund went 2-0 up 72 seconds later when Germany star Marco Reus found Lewandowski unmarked and he slammed his shot into the top left-hand corner to reach his milestone."

The Belgium Under-21 international is expected to be out for six to eight weeks. ""It's a blessing in disguise, at least it's not a torn cruciate ligament,"" said coach Dieter Hecking. ""It's a pity for him, but at least he will be ready to go for it when the new season starts."" Malanda has made a good impression since joining Wolves from Belgium's SV Zulte Waregem in December with two goals and an assist in seven Bundesliga appearances. Wolfsburg, the 2009 German champions, are fifth in the Bundesliga, but just one point from fourth-placed Bayer Leverkusen, who are in the last Champions League place. Wolves have a tricky run-in to the end of the season on May 10.

However, a recurring back injury has destroyed his season. He last played in Germany's 3-3 draw with Paraguay last August shortly after his sole league appearance on the opening day of the season. Dortmund coach Jurgen Klopp has said the eight-times capped Gundogan is not expected to play again this season and had been ruled out of June's World Cup in Brazil. Borussia announced they had extended his contract just before their German Cup semi-final at home to VfL Wolfsburg on Tuesday.

""Kick it like Dortmund and everything will be OK. If only it was that simple,"" said Kaiserslautern coach Kosta Runjaic when asked if Dortmund's victory in Munich gave cause for hope. ""We have to be realistic. Bayern are the best side in the world, they are powerful and the game is theirs to lose. ""We have only a minimal chance, but we will try to take it."" However, it wasn't all doom and gloom from Runjaic. ""We also represent a big club and we're not just going to Munich to swap shirts,"" he added. ""We won't approach the game with fear, but with fun and determination."" Despite Runjaic's heavy dose of realism, Bayern are vulnerable and winless in their last three league games, including defeats to Dortmund, Bavarian neighbours Augsburg and a 3-3 draw at home to Hoffenheim. Bayern could also be without Germany goalkeeper Manuel Neuer, who suffered a calf injury in Saturday's 3-0 defeat at home to Dortmund. ""If the game was yesterday, he couldn't have played. Same today, I hope he can play tomorrow,"" said Bayern coach Pep Guardiola on Tuesday. If Neuer fails to play, the 20-year-old Lukas Raeder will deputise, having conceded a goal just three minutes into his Bundesliga debut against Borussia. The 'Red Devils' of Kaiserslautern were drubbed 4-0 by Bayern in Munich in last season's second round of the cup when the Bavarian giants fielded a weakened side. The semi-final tie also demonstrates the 'haves' and 'have nots' of German football. The four million euros ($5.5 million) Kaiserslautern will earn from the German Football Association (DFB) for making the semi-finals will help reduce the club's financial losses for the season to under a million euros.

It was Bayern's heaviest home league defeat since 2008 and the two Bundesliga giants could meet in this year's final at Berlin's Olympic Stadium on May 17 as Pep Guardiola's Munich host second-division Kaiserslautern in Wednesday's other semi-final. ""We're not thinking about that yet, we have to beat Wolfsburg on Tuesday and we have already seen how strong they are,"" said Dortmund's Germany winger Kevin Grosskreutz. Borussia had to come from a goal down to beat Wolves 2-1 in the league at Dortmund's Westfalenstadion ten days ago in the semi-final dress rehearsal. Klopp's side have a quick turn-around before hosting Wolves, who romped to a 4-1 win at home to Nuremberg on Saturday and are just outside the top four in the league. ""But we'll be putting in another passionate performance like we did against Real and Bayern,"" promised Grosskreutz. Meanwhile Bayern boss Guardiola has demanded an immediate reaction in Wednesday's other semi-final with the Bavarian giants reeling from consecutive league defeats. Bayern face Real Madrid in the Champions League's semi-finals later this month and are bidding to repeat last year's treble of European, league and cup titles. But their shock defeat at home to Dortmund, with a full-strength side, did little to boost confidence. The Bavarian giants are winless in their last three league games since wrapping up the Bundesliga title with a record seven games to spare. ""We want to see the real Bayern Munich again. We need much better performances than against Dortmund,"" said director of sport Matthias Sammer. Giant-killers Kaiserslautern knocked Champions League side Bayer Leverkusen out of the cup in the quarter-finals and Bayern need to be on their guard against the 'Red Devils' who are pushing for promotion to Germany's top flight. Bayern's Germany goalkeeper Manuel Neuer missed the second-half of the Dortmund defeat with a minor calf problem, but expects to play on Wednesday. ""We simply had a bad day at the office, but I'll be fine for Wednesday. It was just a precaution,"" said Neuer. Should Bayern and Dortmund book their Berlin places, the Bavarian giants will be seeking revenge for their 5-2 defeat in the 2012 cup final when Borussia's Robert Lewandowski, who will join Munich at the end of the season, scored a hat-trick."

Ever the diplomat, Bayern coach Pep Guardiola talked up Dortmund, especially following Borussia's 2-0 win over Real Madrid on Tuesday as they bowed out of the Champions League after losing their quarter-final 3-2 on aggregate.

Dortmund face an uphill task at their Westfalenstadion even with Poland striker Robert Lewandowski back in their side after missing the first leg with injury. Last season's finalists geared up for Madrid with a 2-1 come-back win at home to VfL Wolfsburg with goals by Lewandowski and Germany winger Marco Reus after a poor first-half display. Having already lost four of their nine games in Europe this season, Dortmund are looking to bow out with their heads held high, while Real will want to avenge last year's 4-1 semi-final defeat at Dortmund when Lewandowski scored all four.

That was semi-final revenge for the Germans after Real had dumped them out at the same stage 2-0 on aggregate in the 1997/98 season on their way to winning the trophy for the seventh time.

Hanover were reduced to ten men when midfielder Andre Hoffmann was sent off on 62 minutes for a dangerous foul before Jan Hochscheidt scored the hosts' third just before the final whistle. ""That was an important three points and for our fans it's also an important emotional win,"" said Braunschweig's relieved coach Torsten Lieberknecht whose side face champions Bayern Munich in a fortnight. The result leaves Braunschweig unbeaten in their last three games and just two points from safety, while Hanover are two points from the relegation mire after four straight defeats. Later, mid-table Hoffenheim held Hertha Berlin to a 1-1 draw in the capital as Sami Allagui's early goal was cancelled out by Poland international's Eugen Polanski equaliser with half an hour gone. Hoffenheim's Germany hopeful Kevin Volland was only denied the winning goal on the final whistle when his free-kick was palmed over the bar by Hertha goalkeeper Thomas Kraft. On Saturday, champions Bayern Munich suffered their first league defeat since October 2012 as their record 53-match unbeaten run was ended by a 1-0 defeat at Augsburg. Coach Pep Guardiola paid the price for naming a weakened team for the Bavarian derby with one eye on Wednesday's Champions League return leg at home to Manchester United. The Spaniard made seven changes from the side which drew 1-1 at Manchester United last Tuesday in the quarter-final first leg. Guardiola started with three teenagers in Augsburg, giving Bundesliga debuts to reserve team wing-backs Ylli Sallahi and Mitchell Weiser while Pierre-Emile Hoejbjerg was named on the left wing. The gamble backfired when Weiser lost possession to Augsburg's Daniel Baier who fed Sascha Moelders and the  striker blasted his shot past Bayern's goalkeeper Manuel Neuer with 31 minutes gone to claim the winning goal. This was only Bayern's third defeat of the season in all competitions having already been confirmed Bundesliga champions ten days ago with a record seven games to spare. Second-placed Borussia Dortmund earned a morale-boosting 2-1 win at home to VfL Wolfsburg ahead of Tuesday's Champions League quarter-final, second-leg at home to Real Madrid. After Croatia's Ivica Olic gave Wolves an early lead, a Robert Lewandowski header put Dortmund level before Germany winger Marco Reus hit the 77th-minute winner. Borussia face a near-impossible task of overturning a 3-0 defeat from the first leg against Real to reach the Champions League's semi-finals. Schalke 04 are now three points adrift of Dortmund in third as they came from behind to claim a 1-1 draw at Werder Bremen. At the other end of the table, VfB Stuttgart improved their chances of avoiding relegation with a 2-0 win at home to Freiburg to escape the bottom three with goals by Romania's Alexandru Maxim and Austria's Martin Harnik. Nuremberg drop to second from bottom after their 2-0 defeat at home to Borussia Moenchengladbach, who moved up to fourth and into the Champions League places at the expense of Bayer Leverkusen.

272,06/04/2014,17:44,Football: Braunschweig breathe life into survival hopes,Bottom side Eintracht Braunschweig breathed life into their Bundesliga survival hopes as Sunday's 3-0 romp at home to ten-man Hanover 96 means four points now separate the last six sides.,"Congolese-born captain Domi Kumbela gave Braunschweig the lead in the Lower Saxony derby before Norway striker Havard Nielsen made it 2-0 with a superb volley on 21 minutes. Hanover were reduced to ten men when midfielder Andre Hoffmann was sent off on 62 minutes for a dangerous foul before Jan Hochscheidt scored the hosts' third just before the final whistle. The result leaves Braunschweig unbeaten in their last three games and just two points from safety, while Hanover are two points from the relegation mire after four straight defeats. On Saturday, champions Bayern Munich suffered their first league defeat since October 2012 as their record 53-match unbeaten run was ended by a 1-0 defeat at Augsburg. Coach Pep Guardiola paid the price for naming a weakened team for the Bavarian derby with one eye on Wednesday's Champions League return leg at home to Manchester United. The Spaniard made seven changes from the side which drew 1-1 at Manchester United last Tuesday in the quarter-final first leg. Guardiola started with three teenagers in Augsburg, giving Bundesliga debuts to reserve team wing-backs Ylli Sallahi and Mitchell Weiser while Pierre-Emile Hoejbjerg was named on the left wing. The gamble backfired when Weiser lost possession to Augsburg's Daniel Baier who fed Sascha Moelders and the  striker blasted his shot past Bayern's goalkeeper Manuel Neuer with 31 minutes gone to claim the winning goal. This was only Bayern's third defeat of the season in all competitions having already been confirmed Bundesliga champions ten days ago with a record seven games to spare. Second-placed Borussia Dortmund earned a morale-boosting 2-1 win at home to VfL Wolfsburg ahead of Tuesday's Champions League quarter-final, second-leg at home to Real Madrid. After Croatia's Ivica Olic gave Wolves an early lead, a Robert Lewandowski header put Dortmund level before Germany winger Marco Reus hit the 77th-minute winner. Borussia face a near-impossible task of overturning a 3-0 defeat from the first leg against Real to reach the Champions League's semi-finals. Schalke 04 are now three points adrift of Dortmund in third as they came from behind to claim a 1-1 draw at Werder Bremen. At the other end of the table, VfB Stuttgart improved their chances of avoiding relegation with a 2-0 win at home to Freiburg to escape the bottom three with goals by Romania's Alexandru Maxim and Austria's Martin Harnik. Nuremberg drop to second from bottom after their 2-0 defeat at home to Borussia Moenchengladbach, who moved up to fourth and into the Champions League places at the expense of Bayer Leverkusen. Leverkusen sacked coach Sami Hyypia on Saturday less than 24 hours after their 2-1 defeat at strugglers Hamburg which left them facing a battle to qualify for next season's Champions League.

Poland star Robert Lewandowski, who was suspended for the Madrid leg, will be back in the Dortmund team for the return at Borussia's Westfalenstadion. The Polish hot-shot, who scored four goals against Real in last season's Champions League semi-final, got on the board in Saturday's 2-1 come-back league win at home to VfL Wolfsburg. Dortmund found themselves 1-0 down at home to Wolves after Croatia striker Ivica Olic put the guests ahead and punished Borussia's poor first-half display -- one the hosts dare not repeat against Real. ""We have not given up by any stretch of the imagination (against Real),"" said Reus, who scored the 77th-minute winner against Wolves. ""If we play like we did in the first-half (against Wolfsburg), it will be very difficult, but if we play like we did in the second-half, we have a chance in all honesty. ""Either way, it's going to be damned difficult, but we will give it everything."" Last season's finalists Dortmund took a big step towards securing direct qualification for next season's Champions League campaign with three points which kept them second in the table. Dortmund coach Jurgen Klopp produced a spectacular leap of celebration after Reus' winning goal and admitted the victory was a relief, especially as Real's visit preceeds a Bundesliga trip away to Bayern Munich. ""Anyone who saw us celebrate after the game will know what a great relief the victory was,"" said Klopp. ""We needed the win to put some distance between us and the boisterous pack chasing us. ""We will not give anything away on Tuesday. ""We want to play two 45 minutes like we did in the second-half against Wolfsburg and then we'll see how things stand."""

""Sooner or later we had to lose, we accept that and we have to prepare as quickly as possible for Manchester United,"" said head coach Guardiola. ""Next Wednesday is a final for us. It's a matter of life or death."" It was the third game in succession Bayern have fallen behind and Guardiola responded by bringing stars Mario Goetze, David Alaba and Thomas Mueller off the bench. Left-back Alaba hit the post with 68 minutes gone as Bayern pushed in vain for the goal to keep alive hopes of becoming the first team to go through a Bundesliga campaign undefeated.

""We changed our system and in the end we decided the match with our quality and pressure."" Schalke 04 are now three points adrift of Dortmund in third as they came from behind to claim a 1-1 draw at Werder Bremen.

Around 3,000 police officers are expected to be on duty on Tuesday in one of the biggest police operations for a German football match.

""We improved after the break, but it wasn't enough."" The guests took the lead at Leverkusen's BayArena when Bosnia striker Sejad Salihovic netted an early penalty, then Kevin Volland put them 2-1 up just 87 seconds after Stefan Kiessling had levelled for Bayer.

There was more good news for Klopp late on as Marco Reus celebrated his comeback from injury by scoring their third in added time having come off the bench. Schalke 04 bounced back from Tuesday's Champions League exit at Real Madrid with a 3-1 win at home to bottom side Eintracht Braunschweig.

Fifth-placed Wolfsburg are looking to brush off back-to-back defeats when they travel to bottom side Eintracht Braunschweig and keep up the hunt for a Champions League place. At the bottom of the table, VfB Stuttgart's new coach Huub Stevens will be trying to coax their first win in ten matches having taken charge after Thomas Schneider was sacked. Stuttgart are only out of the bottom three on goal difference, while Robin Dutt's Bremen are up to 11th after successive wins over strugglers Hamburg and Nuremberg.

Ribery, UEFA's best player in Europe last season, has not played for Bayern in more than a month after an operation on his buttocks, but made an appearance for France on Wednesday. ""I felt good, those few minutes against the Netherlands were good to get some match practice back. I'm ready,"" said Ribery after France enjoyed a 2-0 win over the Dutch. Bayern are looking to extend their record unbeaten league run to 49 matches and to claim their 11th consecutive victory. Fifth-placed Wolfsburg were hammered 6-2 at Hoffenheim last Sunday and Bayern's director of sport Matthias Sammer expects a backlash at the Volkswagen Arena. ""They suffered a setback in Hoffenheim and they will try and show a reaction, so we must have a few answers to that,"" said Sammer. With a 20-point lead, Bayern could even wrap up the Bundesliga title before the end of the month. Coach Pep Guardiola will want a convincing win before Tuesday's Champions League last 16, second leg at home to Arsenal with the hosts leading 2-0 from the first-leg in London. Second-placed Borussia Dortmund head to Freiburg on Sunday with a shortage of strikers. Poland's Robert Lewandowski sat out Wednesday's international against Scotland with a knee strain and Under-23 striker Marvin Ducksch is out for a fortnight with an ankle injury. It leaves Dortmund coach Jurgen Klopp with only reserve striker Julian Schieber fit, but Germany winger Marco Reus could be switched to play up front.

""My coaching career has not been very long and this is the first time that I'm in such a situation,"" said the 40-year-old ex-Liverpool defender. ""Of course, I have spoken to many people to ask advice on what I could do. ""I want to develop myself and I wouldn't be learning so fast if we weren't in this situation."" Hyypia is hoping to have defensive midfielder Sven Bender back after a dead leg. Schalke 04 are looking to bounce back from successive horror defeats when they host Hoffenheim. The Royal Blues were drubbed 6-1 by Real Madrid in the Champions League, then crashed 5-1 at Bayern last Sunday in the Bundesliga. ""We have to look forward now and give the right response on the pitch against Hoffenheim,"" said coach Jens Keller. Peru winger Jefferson Farfan is doubtful with an inflamed knee while centre-back Kyriakos Papadopoulos is definitely out after being sent off in Munich. At the other end of the table, VfB Stuttgart coach Thomas Schneider must avoid a ninth straight defeat when his side host bottom side Eintracht Braunschweig. Schneider came close to being dismissed after Sunday's 2-1 defeat at Eintracht Frankfurt and another loss would surely mean the 41-year-old being fired, despite having only taken charge in August. Schneider has the fans' backing as the Mercedes Benz Arena will be sold out for only the second time this season.

Dieter Hecking's Wolves had hoped for three points in Hoffenheim to take fourth spot from Schalke 04, who were routed at runaway league leaders Bayern Munich on Saturday. Dutch striker Bas Dost had equalised for Wolves with 15 minutes gone after Roberto Firmino's fourth-minute strike gave Hoffenheim the lead, but the hosts responded with three goals. Hoffenheim led 4-1 at the break as defender Niklas Suele netted before French striker Anthony Modeste scored two goals in four minutes. Croatia forward Ivan Perisic pulled a goal back for Wolves with 15 minutes left. But the visitors had right-back Traesch sent off for a foul in the area and Hoffenheim's Sejad Salihovic netted the penalty before Modeste's replacement Sven Schipplock hit their sixth. Wolfsburg's result leaves them fifth. It means all three teams immediately behind leaders Bayern Munich and second-placed Borussia Dortmund, who beat Nuremberg 3-0 on Saturday, suffered defeats over the weekend. VfB Stuttgart are fourth from bottom after losing 2-1 at Eintracht Frankfurt in what was a club record eighth straight defeat and heaped further pressure on coach Thomas Schneider. Stuttgart striker Martin Harnik's first-half goal was cancelled out by Eintracht midfielder Jan Rosenthal ten minutes from time before captain Alexander Meier hit the 89th-minute winner. On Saturday, an Arjen Robben hat-trick saw Bayern open a 20-point lead at the top of the table with a 5-1 win over ten-man Schalke 04. The Royal Blues suffered a second drubbing in four days after losing 6-1 to Real Madrid in Wednesday's Champions League clash. Bayern extended their record unbeaten league run to 48 matches, dating back to October 2012, and earned their 15th straight league victory. Bayern raced into a 4-0 lead inside half-an-hour as left-back David Alaba netted a free-kick, then Robben scored either side of Mario Mandzukic's header. Schalke were gifted a goal when Jefferson Farfan's corner was turned into his own net by Munich right-back Rafinha, in for captain Philipp Lahm, with 25 minutes left. To compound Schalke's misery, Greece centre-back Kyriakos Papadopoulos was shown a straight red for bringing down Mandzukic in the area. His foul allowed Robben to wrap up his hat-trick with a 77th-minute penalty. Coach Pep Guardiola flippantly told reporters ""don't ask me about the title"" in broken German on Friday, but with 11 league games left, Bayern can wrap up their 24th German league title by the end of March. Dortmund went second after their comfortable win over Nuremberg as Germany defender Mats Hummels netted on his return after four weeks out with a foot injury. Poland star Robert Lewandowski scored his 15th league goal of the season before Henrikh Mkhitaryan netted their third seven minutes from time. Bayer Leverkusen's dreadful form continued with their fourth straight home defeat as they lost 1-0 at home to Mainz, who moved up to sixth with their fifth win in eight games. Cameroon striker Eric Choupo-Moting slammed home the winner past goalkeeper Bernd Leno on 37 minutes as Leverkusen suffered their eighth defeat in ten games to drop to third. Curiously, both goalkeepers scored own goals as Borussia Moenchengladbach, who are winless in their last eight games, were held to a 1-1 draw at bottom side Eintracht Braunschweig."

Their main domestic rivals did little to disprove Guardiola's point as Bayer Leverkusen, Borussia Dortmund and Schalke picked up just a point between them over the weekend. ""It took a while for the players to find their rhythm, but we played well after the first goal,"" said Guardiola. ""We had the opportunity to extend our lead and the boys took it."" The Bavarian giants extended their record unbeaten run to 47 Bundesliga matches, dating back to October 2012, to strengthen their iron grip on what will be their 24th German league title, baring a miracle. Having won last season's league title with a record six games to spare, Bayern are on course to break their own best mark. Hanover offered little resistance as Germany winger Thomas Mueller scored twice while attacking midfielder Thiago Alcantara and Croatia striker Mario Mandzukic also netted. There was more good news for both Bayern and Germany as Bastian Schweinsteiger made his first start since November after an ankle, then knee injury, to partner captain Philipp Lahm in the defensive midfield. ""It was good to start and have no problems, I feel good, even in terms of fitness,"" said Schweinsteiger. ""I still need to get into my rhythm and need some more match practice to get top fit. I just hope things stay positive for me."" Brazil's Rafinha, who took over from Lahm at right-back, strengthened his case for a Selecao place at June's World Cup with two crosses which both led to goals. Mueller set Bayern on the way to their 14th consecutive league win when he headed home Rafinha's cross with 25 minutes gone. Thiago then chested down Schweinsteiger's superb pass and fired home to make it 2-0 after 34 minutes. Mueller profited from a Mandzukic pass to get behind the Hanover defence and score his second on 59 minutes, while Mandzukic then headed home Rafinha's cross for Bayern's fourth, seven minutes later. On Saturday, Borussia Dortmund suffered a shock 3-0 league defeat at strugglers Hamburg ahead of Tuesday's Champions League last-16 clash at Zenit St Petersburg. Hamburg recorded their first league win since November in Mirko Slomka's first match in charge as his side broke their eight-match losing streak, including a club record seven league matches. The result sees Hamburg remain among the relegation places, but move up to 16th, while Dortmund stay third. There was more bad news for Jurgen Klopp on Sunday as defensive midfielder Sven Bender was ruled out for the next 10 weeks with an inflamed pelvis. Second-placed Bayer Leverkusen went down 3-1 at VfL Wolfsburg as Sami Hyypia's side lost for the seventh time in their last nine games. Leverkusen suffered a Champions League hangover, following their 4-0 last-16, first-leg home defeat to Paris Saint-Germain, with another poor display.

Dutch striker Bas Dost put Wolfsburg ahead and while Germany winger Sidney Sam equalised for Leverkusen on the stroke of half-time, Wolves' Brazil midfielder Luiz Gustavo netted their second with half an hour to play. Left-back Ricardo Rodriguez then scored from a penalty at the second attempt with 17 minutes from time, tapping home the rebound after Leverkusen goalkeeper Bernd Leno had saved the initial spot-kick to leave Wolves fifth in the league. European champions Bayern are at Hanover 96 on Sunday evening looking to build on their commanding 16-point lead and extend their record 46-match unbeaten league run. Results on Saturday means the three teams behind the Bavarian giants -- Leverkusen, Dortmund and Schalke -- picked up just one point between them and Guardiola's side can finish the weekend 19-points clear. Braunschweig are now three points adrift at the bottom after their 2-1 defeat at ten-man Nuremberg in a match where three penalties were saved. Borussia Moenchengladbach stay sixth, but are winless in their last seven games after their 2-2 draw at home to Hoffenheim. Augsburg got back to winning ways with a 4-2 victory at Freiburg to bounce back from last weekend's defeat to Nuremberg, their only loss in the last eight games. VfB Stuttgart are just above the bottom three after they suffered their seventh straight defeat at home to Hertha Berlin, who ran out 2-1 winners. Hertha's replacement striker Sandro Wagner headed the winner, three minutes from time, but was then sent off for a second yellow card having only been on the pitch for 12 minutes. Fourth-placed Schalke, who host Real Madrid in Wednesday's Champions League last-16, first-leg clash, stayed fourth after their goalless draw at home to Mainz 05 on Friday."

311,15/02/2014,13:32,Football: Fulham turn to hardman Magath,"Fulham have recruited Felix Magath to preserve their Premier League status, but with a reputation for big spending and tough training methods, he comes with mixed reviews from the Bundesliga.","All of last week, the German media had touted Magath as a replacement for Dutchman Bert van Marwijk at Hamburg, where ex-Germany international Magath won the 1983 European title as a player. Reports suggest struggling Hamburg could not meet the wage demands of Magath, who was soon raving about England's Premier League as a ""fantastic working environment for every coach and footballer"". Having coached eight Bundesliga teams, this is Magath's first managerial sojourn outside of Germany and his first job in 18 months. First, the good news for Fulham supporters. The 60-year-old won three Bundesliga title with two different clubs, leading Bayern Munich to the league and cup double in both 2004-05 and 2005-06, then Wolfsburg to the 2009 Bundesliga title. He is a fitness fanatic who enjoys sending his squads on long runs, preferably up hills, and has the nickname 'Quelix' -- a crude combination of his first name and the German word for torture. As TV pundit and former Norway international Jan Age Fjortoft put it, from their time together at Eintracht Frankfurt, ""I don't know if Magath would have saved the Titanic, but the survivors would have been fit."" Fjortoft took to Twitter on Friday to sing the praises of his time working with Magath, who saved Frankfurt from relegation in 2000: ""I loved it. I was just too tired sometimes. ""Dear Fulham-fans! Never will you say again: - the players didn't run enough, the players don't train enough or the boss is not clear enough."" But there are plenty of Magath detractors after he left both Schalke and Wolfsburg with little success and a huge wage bill. Magath has had his fair share of either keeping teams up through hard work or being relieved of his duties when relegation was imminent and his players close to revolution. Fjortoft's former Frankfurt teammate Bachirou Salou once famously dubbed Magath ""The last dictator in Europe"" after one long run too many. Despite back-to-back doubles, Magath was dismissed by Bayern in January 2007 with his side fourth in the league, outside the Champions League places in those days. ""Felix Magath likes to use pressure,"" summed up Bayern captain Philipp Lahm in his autobiography. ""He leaves many players in suspense as to whether he needs them and uses this method to get the maximum out of them. ""For the players, he is very demanding, and there comes a point where they no longer stand by the coach's side."" The harmonious spell of four titles in two seasons quickly soured when results refused to go Bayern's way. ""It was a logical farewell,"" said Lahm. ""There was a fatigue-based breakdown between the coach and the team."" Magath then masterminded VfL Wolfsburg's stunning run to the 2009 Bundesliga title, including a 5-1 romp at home to his ex-club Bayern. Strikers Edin Dzeko and Brazilian Grafite both scored twice while play-maker Zvjezdan Misimovic ran riot to embarrass the Bavarian giants. Having earned the plaudits, Magath immediately left to take charge at Schalke 04, finishing his first season as runners-up. But things unravelled at the Royal Blues, where Magath was all-powerful as both director of sport and coach, leading to his dismissal the following season with poor results and a huge wage bill. ""I don't ever want to see Felix Magath again, his number has long since been deleted from my phone,"" fumed Schalke midfielder Jermaine Jones. ""Our time shared at Schalke was unbearable."" Having been dismissed by the Royal Blues in March 2011, Magath was out of a job for less than 48 hours as Wolfsburg asked him to step in after ex-England manager Steve McClaren was sacked. But with the 2009 squad dispersed, Magath failed to bring success back to Wolfsburg despite heavy investment. The team finished mid-table in 2011-12 and he left by mutual consent in October 2012 with his enormous squad bottom of the table with five points from eight matches."

Munich will host second-division Kaiserslautern and Dortmund at home to VfL Wolfsburg with the final at Berlin's Olympic Stadium on May 17. Bayern's Croatia international striker Mario Mandzukic scored a hat-trick at Hamburg as the hosts' defence capitulated in what could be coach Bert van Marwijk's last game in charge. After setting an unwanted club record by losing all of their last six league matches, Hamburg were again trounced at their Imtech Arena with Mandzukic, Dante and Arjen Robben scoring Bayern's first three goals. Croatia's Mandzukic then added two more in as many second-half minutes as Bayern finished with a flurry. Having also lost 3-0 at home to Hertha Berlin on Saturday, Hamburg have leaked eight goals without reply in their last two games and are second from bottom in the league. Ex-Holland coach Van Marwijk's position grows every more precarious. ""They overpowered us and were outstanding,"" admitted Hamburg's director of sport Oliver Kreuzer, whose side faces bottom side Eintracht Braunschweig in the league on Saturday. ""I hope we will see a reaction from our team. ""Braunschweig aren't Bayern Munich, but with regard to everything else, I have no idea (what will happen)."" With an internal battle raging behind the scenes between Hamburg's Supervisory and Executive boards, Van Marwijk could well have had his last game in charge having only taken charge in September. Ex-Bayern, Schalke and Wolfsburg coach Felix Magath is widely tipped as the favourite to take over. Bayern were rarely troubled and goalkeeper Manuel Neuer needed 15 minutes to get his first touch of the ball and the opening goal came just six minute later. Germany midfielder Mario Goetze found some space and dribbled to the goal-line, held off his marker and squared for Mandzukic to tap home. Brazil centre-back Dante followed that up with a header four minutes later from a Toni Kroos' corner to give the visitors a 2-0 lead at the break. Holland winger Arjen Robben then chested down a beautiful long ball from Kroos and fired past Hamburg goalkeeper Rene Adler on 54 minutes. Mandzukic made it 4-0 when he profited again from another superb piece of skill from Goetze on 74 minutes, then fired home his third with 76 minutes gone. There was more good news for Bayern as Germany midfielder Bastian Schweinsteiger came on for the last 25 minutes after three months out with an ankle injury. ""Now come the games which will be decided by small things. We have to get through them,"" said Schweinsteiger, with Bayern already looking ahead to Wednesday's Champions League last 16 clash at Arsenal. Bayern will be joined in the draw for April's semi-finals by Borussia Dortmund, VfL Wolfsburg and second-division Kaiserlautern, who inflicted a shock 1-0 defeat on Bayer Leverkusen. A 114th-minute goal from Norway midfielder Ruben Jenssen was enough to see Kaiserlautern into the last four as the soul non-Bundesliga representative. Wolfsburg also booked their place with a 3-2 win at Hoffenheim with Swiss defender Ricardo Rodriguez converting two first-half penalties for Wolves, but was then sent off for a second yellow card after 70 minutes. On Tuesday, 2012 German Cup winners Dortmund booked their semi-final berth with Gabon's Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang heading the winner in their 1-0 victory at Eintracht Frankfurt."

""Despite the injuries, I had no doubts in the team,"" said Klopp. ""We want to go to Berlin (for the Cup final on May 17) and you could see that from the way we played."" Aubameyang's goal seven minutes from time put the 2012 Cup winners through despite missing key first-team players. AMong those missing were injured Germany midfielders Sven Bender and Marco Reus, who both suffered thigh injuries in last Saturday's 5-1 romp at Werder Bremen in the Bundesliga. Centre-back Mats Hummels was out with an ankle knock, while winger Jakub Blaszczykowski and defender Neven Subotic are out for the season with knee injuries.

Left winger Reus suffered a torn right thigh in Saturday's 5-1 Bundesliga hammering of Werder Bremen and will be out for a fortnight, while defensive midfielder Bender has a thigh strain and misses the next week. But Dortmund coach Jurgen Klopp said the Bremen win meant Borussia headed to Frankfurt in buoyant mood after Poland striker Robert Lewandowski and attacking midfielder Henrikh Mkhitaryan both scored twice. ""From the first seconds, we saw what we want to see every week,"" said Klopp, with Dortmund third in the league and set to face Zenit St Petersburg in the last 16 of the Champions League. ""That was a game where there was nothing to criticise."" In a double-header, Frankfurt host 2012 German Cup winners Dortmund in the cup on Tuesday, then travel to Borussia's Westfalenstadion on Saturday for a league match. The double injury blow is more bad news for Klopp who lost Germany defender Mats Hummels last week after the centre-back injured his foot in a friendly and will miss the Frankfurt double-header. Klopp is already without both centre-back Neven Subotic and winger Jakub Blaszczykowski for the rest of the season as the pair have torn knee ligament injuries. Frankfurt also have a few injury concerns with captain Pirmin Schwegler carrying a rib injury and fellow midfielder Johannes Flum, who scored in Saturday's 3-0 win over bottom side Eintracht Braunschweig, has a thigh strain. ""We normally do well against Borussia at home, we lost 2-1 to them earlier this season and drew 3-3 last season, which was a real spectacle,"" said Eintracht midfielder Alexander Maier. ""If we put in our best performance, we make it tough for any team to beat us and we'll try everything to pull off a shock."" European champions Bayern travel to Hamburg in Wednesday's ties while Bayer Leverkusen are home to second division Kaiserslautern, in the only non-Bundesliga clash, and Hoffenhem are home to VfL Wolfsburg. Bayern, who are on a record 45 match unbeaten league run, are peerless in the Bundesliga and are on course to repeat last year's treble of European, league and cup titles. Hamburg are in chaos having been booed by their own fans on Saturday after crashing to a sixth-straight league defeat, a club record, on Saturday as they were routed 3-0 at home by Hertha Berlin. Coach Bert van Marwijk has been given a job guarantee  by director of sport Oliver Kreuzer until at least Saturday's Bundesliga match at bottom side Eintracht Braunschweig, but first come Bayern in the cup. Pep Guardiola's Bayern have already beaten Hamburg 3-1 in Munich last December while the European champions warmed up for their Hamburg Sojourn with a 2-0 win at Nuremberg on Saturday."

The Royal Blues put on a regal performance at Gelsenkirchen's Veltins Arena with Jefferson Farfan tapping home after a superb run from defender Sead Kolasinac on 39 minutes. Teenage wunderkind Max Meyer added a second a minute before the break. ""That was a very good performance we put in,"" enthused Schalke coach Jens Keller, who said defender Atsuto Uchida picked up a leg injury and midfielder Roman Neustadter had a badly cut knee. The defeat ended Hanover's recent form having won their first two games of the year under new coach Tayfun Korkut to leave the guests lying tenth. Earlier, ten-man VfB Stuttgart dropped closer to the Bundesliga's relegation battle after suffering their fifth-straight defeat in a 4-1 rout at home to buoyant Augsburg.

Club chairman Carl-Edgar Jarchow said on Sunday the club will continue to work with ex-Holland coach Van Marwijk, but it is clear that results must improve. A group of players, including captain Rafael van der Vaart, were pelted with eggs, beer cups and lighters when they went to talk to angry fans outside Hamburg's Imtech Arena on Saturday night. A group of 250 fans, shouting ""fucking millionaires"", attacked the players' luxury sports cars and had to be beaten back by police with batons and pepper spray. ""I understand the fans disappointment, but it's not okay when players are attacked. That shakes you to the core,"" said Van der Vaart. Van Marwijk, who only took charge in September, has said he will not quit. ""I will not resign, I'm still one hundred percent positive and convinced that we will not go down,"" said the 61-year-old. Director of sport Oliver Kreuzer has said there is no problem with the coach. He insisted Van Marwijk will be on the bench for Wednesday's German Cup quarter-final at home to champions and holders Bayern Munich, as well as Saturday's league match at bottom side Eintracht Braunschweig. Hamburg's supervisory board are due to meet later on Sunday and Van Marwijk's future is sure to be discussed.

335,23/01/2014,17:44,Football: Wolves set to blood ex-Chelsea star De Bruyne,"VfL Wolfsburg's record signing, Belgium midfielder Kevin de Bruyne, is set to make his Bundesliga debut at home to Hanover 96 on Saturday, just a week after signing from Chelsea.","The 22-year-old became Wolfsburg's most expensive player when he joined the 2009 German champions for 22 million euros (US$30m) last week and is under contract until 2019. ""I see no risk in throwing him straight in,"" said Wolfsburg's coach Dieter Hecking. ""We have already seen in few days with us what quality Kevin has. He is quick with the ball and strong in one-on-ones."" Hecking's only doubt is where to start the attacking midfielder or winger, who has already impressed in the Bundesliga after a loan spell at Werder Bremen where he produced some outstanding performances in a struggling team. De Bruyne was a key part of Belgium's qualification for the 2014 World Cup, scoring four goals during their campaign as they booked their berth at their first major tournament in 12 years. The Belgian will not be the only one making his debut at Wolfsburg on Saturday as new Hanover 96 coach Tayfun Korkut is set to take his bow having replaced Mirko Slomka during the winter break. The 39-year-old is hoping to include Senegal striker Mame Diouf after he struggled with a leg injury in December. Korkut was brought in over the winter break after Slomka was fired having won just one of their last ten league games and suffered nine straight away defeats to drop to 13th in the league."

Neither club confirmed the transfer fee, although German media have suggested that it is in the region of 22 million euros ($29.8m, £18.1m). If true, the deal would constitute a record for Wolfsburg, beating the previous mark of up to 20 million euros paid to Bayern Munich for Brazilian midfielder Luiz Gustavo last summer. ""Kevin always said to us that he wanted to come to Wolfsburg. He is convinced as to his sporting perspectives at the club and has the potential to play a major role in the team,"" declared Wolves sporting director Klaus Allofs. De Bruyne, who trained with his new colleagues on Saturday, will be officially presented on Sunday. He joined Chelsea from Genk in 2012, but after going out on loan to Werder Bremen in the 2012-13 campaign, he was unable to force his way into the first-team picture this season. Chelsea only paid around £7 million to secure his services, but his stock rose in Germany after he scored 10 goals in 34 appearances during his loan spell at Bremen."

""The Belgian joins the Bundesliga club having made five starts for Chelsea, with a further four appearances as a substitute."" Chelsea did not reveal the transfer fee, but reports in the German media have suggested that Wolfsburg were prepared to pay around 20 million euros (£16.5 million, $27.1 million) for the Belgium international.

The Wolfsburger Nachrichten reported the player would have a medical early this week and join his new team mates on a training camp in China. But Wolfsburg manager Klaus Allofs told the local newspaper: ""We're not quite at the stage of confirming the transfer, but the differences with Chelsea are not insurmountable."" Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho confirmed last Friday that two offers had been received for the Belgian international and that one of them could interest both the club and the player. De Bruyne, under contract with Chelsea until 2017, is understood to be keen on a return to Germany, where he spent a successful season on loan at Werder Bremen last year. And for Wolfsburg, he could be the ideal replacement for Brazilian Diego, who is expected to leave the club at the end of the season. He would become ambitious Wolfsburg's second big money signing of the campaign, following the 20 milion euros they shelled out for Brazilian defensive midfielder Luiz Gustavo from Bayern Munich."
339,22/12/2013,18:38,Football: Hard times for Klopp as Dortmund slump again,Borussia Dortmund coach Jurgen Klopp has admitted last season's Champions League's finalists have fallen on hard times after slumping to their third consecutive home defeat in the Bundesliga.,"Hertha Berlin's 2-1 win at Dortmund on Saturday was the third straight home league defeat Borussia have suffered at the Westfalentstadion -- the first time that has happened in 13 years. Dortmund dropped to fourth -- outside the automatic Champions League places -- as Borussia Moenchengladbach drew 2-2 at home to VfL Wolfsburg on Sunday to go eight games unbeaten. ""One must always be grateful and humble in life, these great lads have already written some great stories this year -- today it was different,"" admitted Klopp as the Bundesliga breaks for winter. ""This is a shitty end to 2013."" With the Bundesliga now on a winter break, Dortmund finish the year 12 points behind league leaders Bayern Munich, who have a game in hand. Borussia's current form is a far cry from last season's eye-catching football which carried them through to May's Champions League final where they lost 2-1 to Bayern. Dortmund have suffered five defeats in the first half of the season -- the most in the same period since Klopp took charge five years ago. Having lost at home to Bayern, Bayer Leverkusen and Hertha, Dortmund are already effectively out of the title race. A catalogue of injuries has blighted Klopp of late, especially to his first-choice centre-back pairing of Mats Hummels and Neven Subotic, who is out until May with a torn knee ligament. It has meant 18-year-old Marian Sarr, who made his Dortmund debut in the 2-1 Champions League win at Marseille, has broken into the first team, but it was his mistake which led to Berlin's second goal. After Germany winger Marco Reus gave Dortmund the lead, Colombia striker Adrian Ramos pulled one back, after a mistake from Dortmund left-back Erik Durm, before Hertha took the lead with 45 minutes gone. When Sarr slipped in possession, Tunisia striker Sami Allagui pounced on the error and sprinted around Dortmund goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller to roll the ball into an empty net to Sarr's dismay. Klopp admitted he was looking forward to the winter break, which should see the return of Hummels and midfielder Ilkay Gundogan, as Borussia prepare for their training camp which starts January 5. ""Then we can start from scratch,"" said Klopp, whose side had 18 shots on goal to Berlin's six. ""We had our chances, we just didn't recognise them or use them. ""Today was only our smallest problem, the whole year has been very intense for us, particularly the last third. ""We have set high standards and all the matches we lost this season we didn't need to lose."" The focus now for Klopp is on facing Zenit St Petersburg in the last 16 of the Champions League and the quarter-final of the German Cup -- as well as recapturing last season's form."

344,22/12/2013,02:10,Football: Hard times for Klopp as Dortmund slump again,Borussia Dortmund coach Jurgen Klopp has admitted last season's Champions League's finalists have fallen on hard times after slumping to their third consecutive home defeat in the Bundesliga.,"Hertha Berlin's 2-1 win in Dortmund on Saturday was the third straight home league defeat Borussia have suffered at the Westfalentstadion -- the first time that has happened in 13 years. Dortmund will drop to fourth -- outside the automatic Champions League places -- if Borussia Moenchengladbach pick up just a point at home to VfL Wolfsburg on Sunday to go eight games unbeaten. ""One must always be grateful and humble in life, these greats lads have already written some great stories this year -- today it was different,"" admitted Klopp as the Bundesliga breaks for winter. ""This is a shitty end to 2013."" Borussia's current form is a far cry from last season's eye-catching football which carried them through to May's Champions League final where they lost 2-1 to Bayern Munich. Dortmund have suffered five defeats in the first half of the season -- the most in the same period since Klopp took charge five years ago. Having lost at home to Bayern, Bayer Leverkusen and Hertha, Dortmund finish 2013 effectively out of the title race as they find themselves 12 points behind Munich, who have a game in hand. A catalogue of injuries has blighted Klopp of late, especially to his first-choice centre-back pairing of Mats Hummels and Neven Subotic, who is out until May with a torn knee ligament. It has meant 18-year-old Marian Sarr, who made his Dortmund debut in the 2-1 Champions League win at Marseille, has broken into the first team, but it was his mistake which led to Berlin's second goal. After Germany winger Marco Reus gave Dortmund the lead, Colombia striker Adrian Ramos pulled one back, after a mistake from Dortmund left-back Erik Durm, before Hertha took the lead with 45 minutes gone. When Sarr slipped in possession, Tunisia striker Sami Allagui pounced on the error and sprinted around Dortmund goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller to roll the ball into an empty net to Sarr's dismay. Klopp admitted he was looking forward to the winter break, which should see the return of Hummels and midfielder Ilkay Gundogan, as Borussia prepare for their training camp which starts January 5. ""Then we can start from scratch,"" said Klopp, whose side had 18 shots on goal to Berlin's six. ""We had our chances, we just didn't recognise them or use them. ""Today was only our smallest problem, the whole year has been very intense for us, particularly the last third. ""We have set high standards and all the matches we lost this season we didn't need to lose."" The focus now for Klopp is on facing Zenit St Petersburg in the last 16 of the Champions League and the quarter-final of the German Cup -- as well as recapturing last season's form."

Leverkusen and Dortmund's defeats means Pep Guardiola's Bayern can go ten points clear if they beat VfB Stuttgart in their catch-up fixture on January 29. Second-placed Leverkusen fell to a late goal at strugglers Werder Bremen, whose Argentinian right-back Santiago Garcia stabbed his shot home to give Bremen a first win in six games. ""It's a bit annoying that we go into the winter break on the back of two defeats,"" said Leverkusen coach Sami Hyypia after Bayer were shocked 1-0 by Eintracht Frankfurt last Sunday. ""We controlled the game, but we didn't score a goal and lacked a bit of belief. ""It leaves a bitter taste in the mouth, but all in all we can be happy with the first half of the season.""

""We allowed our opponents to get back in the game and didn't take our chances in the second half,"" lamented Dortmund coach Jurgen Klopp. ""Hertha got brave and realised there was something to be had after the second goal, while we allowed ourselves to become too hectic."" Borussia took an early lead at home when captain Sebastian Kehl put through a superb ball for Marco Reus and with his first touch, the Germany winger put his shot past 18-year-old Hertha goalkeeper Marius Gersbeck, who was making his Bundesliga debut. But Hertha got back on level terms when striker Adrian Ramos hit his 11th goal of the season after Hertha's Sami Allagui put in a cross for the Colombia forward to convert on 23 minutes. Tunisia forward Allagui then gave Hertha the lead by pouncing on a mistake by Dortmund's teenaged centre-back Marian Sarr, rounding Dortmund goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller and firing into an empty net on the stroke of half-time. Klopp substituted the clearly distressed Sarr for the start of the second-half, moving left-back Kevin Grosskreutz into centre-back, but his side failed to grab a precious equaliser despite seven minutes of added time. Dortmund stay third but will drop to fourth if Borussia Moenchengladbach pick up at least a point at home to VfL Wolfsburg on Sunday. Nuremberg finish 2013 as the only team in a major European league without a win so far this season after they were held to a goalless draw at home to Schalke 04. The Royal Blues were without coach Jens Keller, who has been told a decision on his future will be made over the winter break, as the 43-year-old was suffering with flu. The point was enough to see Nuremberg stay 17th, leaving Eintracht Braunschweig bottom on goal difference despite their 1-0 win over Hoffenheim. Freiburg extended Hanover 96's appalling away record to eight consecutive defeats with a 2-1 win to help the hosts in their bid to escape the bottom three.

348,20/12/2013,02:30,Football: Rivals out to attack absent Bayern's lead,"With runaway leaders Bayern Munich involved in Saturday's Club World Cup final, their Bundesliga rivals Borussia Dortmund and Bayer Leverkusen will be aiming to trim the Bavarians' lead.","Munich hold a seven-point lead at the top of the table and are threatening to again run off with the title, unless their rivals can steal a march with Bayern in Morocco. Second-placed Bayer Leverkusen face Werder Bremen away on Saturday with the hosts winless in their last five games. ""It won't be easy for us but we want to make a good impression in our last match before the winter break and take all three points,"" said Bayer coach Sami Hyypia. Leverkusen can set a new club record of 40 points for the first half of the season with a win at Bremen on what will be the final Bundesliga weekend of 2013. But Bayer slumped to a shock defeat at the hands of strugglers Eintracht Frankfurt last weekend and Bremen plan to follow suit. ""Bayer 04 have been in the leading pack for years but we've got a chance in front of our own fans,"" said Bremen midfielder Clemens Fritz. ""Frankfurt showed the way. Football is always capable of springing a surprise."" Werder coach Robin Dutt was so furious after his side's 3-2 defeat at Hertha Berlin last weekend that he sent the squad for a 4am gym session on their return to Bremen. Dutt is waiting on the fitness of captain Aaron Hunt as the veteran midfielder struggles with a calf injury. ""There is a big question mark against him, he would be a big loss,"" said Dutt. Third-placed Borussia Dortmund, who are 12 points behind Bayern and five adrift of Leverkusen, host Hertha Berlin looking for only their second league win in five games. Four points from those five matches has been a poor return and coach Jurgen Klopp is hoping to get some of his stars off the injured list to try to turn things around. Germany left-back Marcel Schmelzer could feature after a calf tear but it is still too early for defensive midfielder Ilkay Gundogan, who has at least trained with the squad this week. The 23-year-old has not played since injuring his back in Germany's friendly draw against Paraguay in August. And Klopp is also without both centre-backs Neven Subotic and Mats Hummels. Yet rather than looking forward to seeing the back of 2013, he remains eager to get their title challenge back on track. ""I'm not ready yet for Christmas,"" he said. ""We have had a great week of training and we could get down to some good work. The team are up for it."" Nuremberg host Schalke 04 on Saturday evening still looking for their first win of the season -- the only team in Europe's major leagues without a victory so far. Should Dortmund falter against Berlin, fourth-placed Borussia Moenchengladbach can usurp them from third when they host VfL Wolfsburg on Sunday.

Freiburg remain third from bottom with a third straight defeat and to make matters worse they had French midfielder Francis Coquelin, on loan from Arsenal, carried off with a suspected broken ankle just after the break. Hertha Berlin stayed seventh and kept hosts Eintracht Braunschweig rooted to the bottom of the table with a 2-0 away win. Colombia striker Adrian Ramos headed Berlin into a first-half lead before 20-year-old midfielder Tolga Cigerci added a late second with his first for the club.

Ribery boosted his claim for the 2013 world footballer of the year award, which will be announced on January 13, by creating two goals and scoring twice in the rout. Bayern, who last lost in the German league in October 2012, produced their biggest win so far under Pep Guardiola, cutting Bremen's defence to tatters.

Bremen coach Robin Dutt kept the team on the pitch for a stern lecture as they dropped to 14th after just two wins in their last 10 games.

South Korea striker Son Heung-Min hit the 18th-minute winner after Leverkusen's attack pounced on a mistake by Dortmund defender Manuel Friedrich for Son to score his fifth goal in his last three games against Borussia. Both sides finished with 10 men in a tense affair. Dortmund lost both defensive midfielders Sven Bender and Nuri Sahin during the match with ankle injuries. Germany's Bender has been ruled out of Wednesday's Champions League game at Marseille with a sprained ankle, while Sahin has a torn ligament and is rated extremely doubtful.

""It was a complicated and difficult game against a defence-minded opponent,"" said Bayern boss Pep Guardiola, who with 12 wins and two draws, has extended his record for the best start by a new Bundesliga coach. ""We dominated possession and, in the first half, we were very strong mentally after (last Saturday's 3-0 win at) Dortmund and the trip to Moscow.

Even with hamstring-victim Philipp Lahm, plus France's Franck Ribery and Germany star Bastian Schweinsteiger on the walking wounded list, Bayern had too much fire-power for Braunschweig. Having warned his side not to underestimate Eintracht, who have never won in Munich, Dutch winger Robben was as good as his word. The Netherlands star put the hosts ahead with a header after just two minutes, then slammed home a 30th-minute shot, but this was not an impressive performance as Bayern barely got out of second gear. Borussia Dortmund picked up their first win in three league games with a hard-fought 3-1 win at ten-man Mainz 05 to stay third and seven points behind Bayern. Dortmund took the lead on 70 minutes when Gabon's Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang fired home a superb free-kick, but the lead lasted just four minutes before Cameroon's Eric Choupo-Moting fired home a penalty. Mainz were reduced to 10 men when Colombia's Elkin Soto was sent off for stopping the ball going into the net with his hand and Poland striker Robert Lewandowski fired home the 79th-minute penalty. Lewandowski then made sure of the points with his second penalty when he converted the 94th-minute spot kick when left-back Erik Durm was up-ended. ""You have to evaluate the win in the context of our situation,"" said Dortmund coach Jurgen Klopp, who lost his entire back four ten days ago through injury. ""There was a very, very good fighting spirit. ""The fact that in certain situations our opponents had their chances to win the game says everything about Mainz's class.""

Bayern, who now have 31 wins in their last 37 Bundesliga matches, were without Germany's Bastian Schweinsteiger, who will miss the forthcoming internationals against Italy and England with an ankle injury. It was Bayern's second milestone of the week after they equalled Barcelona's record from the 2002/03 season of nine consecutive Champions League wins with a 1-0 at Viktoria Pilsen. Breaking records is nothing remarkable for Bayern these days having set or equalled 25 league records under Guardiola's predecessor Jupp Heynckes last season. More importantly, Bayern extended their lead at the top of the table to four points as second-placed Borussia Dortmund went down 2-1 at VfL Wolfsburg. It was Dortmund's second defeat of the week after losing to 1-0 at home to Arsenal in the Champions League. After Germany winger Marco Reus put Dortmund ahead with a thunderbolt of a free kick on the stroke of half-time, Wolves hit back to pick up their fourth straight victory to leave them fourth. Swiss defender Ricardo Rodriguez smashed home a free kick before Croatia striker Ivica Olic hit a great goal in off the far post with 20 minutes left. Third-placed Bayer Leverkusen are level with Dortmund on 28 points after beating Hamburg 5-3 with South Korea's star striker Son Heung-Min scoring a hat-trick. Son scored after nine and 16 minutes before hitting his third on 55 minutes, before setting up Stefan Kiessling for Leverkusen's fourth. Schalke bounced back from their Champions League defeat at Chelsea as they came from behind to beat Werder Bremen 3-1 with Ghana midfielder Kevin-Prince Boateng netting two headers. Hertha Berlin stayed seventh after their 3-2 win at Hoffenheim with Colombia's Adrian Ramos scoring two goals, including the winning goal when he headed the winner six minutes from time."

""It's great to get the hat-trick, but it's more important that things went so well for the team,"" said Lasogga, who claimed the fastest away hat-trick in Bundesliga history. This was only the second game for Van Marwijk, 61, who coached Holland to the 2010 World Cup final. He replaced Thorsten Fink last month after a disastrous start left Hamburg in the relegation places. The Dutchman has promised to tighten Hamburg's defence, but it was their attack which ran riot at Nuremberg. ""I like attacking football, although tactical discipline belongs to that and we still lose the ball too often, but it's getting better,"" said Van Marwijk, whose reign opened with a draw at Frankfurt last week. ""A 5-0 win doesn't happen every week, but it's important to help the self-confidence come back."" Dutch midfielder Rafael van der Vaart opened the scoring with a superb scissor-kick volley on 17 minutes. The Hamburg captain then provided the final passes for Lasogga to fire home his first two goals while the ex-Hertha Berlin forward completed the hat-trick when he pounced on a loose ball and smashed his shot inside the inside post. Midfielder Tolgay Arslan bagged the fifth 16 minutes from time to leave Nuremberg reeling. The rout lifts Hamburg up to 14th, while Nuremberg slip into the bottom three. On Saturday, European champions Bayern Munich went top for the first time under Pep Guardiola after a 1-1 draw at Bayer Leverkusen.

In a high-tempo clash at Leverkusen's BayArena, Germany midfielder Sidney Sam's 31st-minute equaliser for the hosts cancelled out Toni Kroos' opening goal for Bayern. Leverkusen goalkeeper Bernd Leno guaranteed a point for his side by denying Franck Ribery twice in as many second-half minutes, then Mario Goetze, while Thomas Mueller had a penalty appeal turned down. But Guardiola was a picture of frustration, brooding on the Bayern bench and drumming his fingers as Bayern enjoyed 27 shots on goal and 78 percent possession, but managed just a single goal. The point was enough to send Bayern top, with Leverkusen third, behind Borussia Dortmund. Fresh from their impressive 3-0 Champions League win over Marseille, Dortmund were set to claim an away point until a disastrous final 10-minute spell, triggered by Mats Hummels' red card. The Germany defender was sent off on 81 minutes after a reckless challenge on 'Gladbach's Norway midfielder Havard Nordtveit in the area. Germany striker Max Kruse netted the resulting penalty, then Brazilian forward Raffael hit their second four minutes from time to see 'Gladbach move up to fourth. Schalke 04 came from behind to claim a 4-1 win over 10-man Augsburg in Gelsenkirchen to move up to eighth. VfB Stuttgart dropped to seventh after their 1-1 draw at home to Werder Bremen while Hoffenheim stayed 10th with a 2-2 draw at Mainz.

Fresh from their impressive 3-0 Champions League win over Marseille, Dortmund were set to claim an away point until Hummels earned a red-card with a reckless challenge on 'Gladbach's Norway midfielder Havard Nordtveit which left referee Manuel Graefe reaching for the red card. Germany striker Max Kruse netted the penalty, then Brazilian forward Raffael hit their second four minutes from time to see 'Gladbach move up to fourth.

Traore then found acres of space on the left wing and his cross was converted by Austria's Martin Harnik four minutes from time to inflict a sixth defeat from seven games on Braunschweig. Earlier, Werder Bremen and Nuremberg fought out a six-goal thriller with Dutch winger Eljero Elia scoring twice for the hosts for a 3-3 draw. Japan midfielder Hiroshi Kiyotake played a key role in sparking Nuremberg's fight back from 2-0 down with a first-half goal before his superb pass saw Czech midfielder Adam Hlousek hit the equaliser. Bremen raced into a 2-0 lead after Nuremberg defender Berkay Dabanli turned the ball into his own net before Elia bagged his first with a superb shot on 34 minutes. Nuremberg fought back after Kiyotake produced a goal from nothing just before the break, then Josip Drmic made it 2-2 early in the second half. Former Juventus star Elia restored Bremen's lead with a thunderbolt shot from outside the area with 66 minutes gone before Kiyotake's through ball saw Hlousek hit the equaliser to share the points.

Bayern and City are battling for top spot in Group D after winning their opening matches with Munich seeing off CSKA Moscow 3-0 at home and City winning 3-0 at Viktoria Pilsen. But against a dogged Wolfsburg defence Bayern's finishing and passing let them down in a below-par performance. Guardiola took off Arjen Robben, Bastian Schweinsteiger and Mario Mandzukic in the second-half with one eye on the trip to England, but Bayern were far from impressive. They only created 11 shots on goal all game and too many sloppy passes allowed Wolfsburg to contain the European champions for the majority of the match. Germany midfielder Thomas Mueller scored the winner with his first Bundesliga goal of the season when he met Franck Ribery's pass from the left wing at the far post on 63 minutes. ""We presented ourselves well in terms of how we battled away,"" said Mueller. ""Wolfsburg gave us nothing and it was far from a walk in the park for us. They played almost man for man against us, which gave us a few problems and we can be pleased that we won. ""We deserved the win as, apart from a couple of chances, I didn't see much from Wolfsburg.

Pep Guardiola's side go into the weekend's matches in second place in the table, trailing leaders Borussia Dortmund on goals scored before facing the Wolves at the Allianz Arena. Having blitzed Schalke 4-0 in Gelsenkirchen last Saturday in the league and routed Hanover 96 4-1 in the German Cup on Wednesday, Bayern are showing signs of further progress under Guardiola since he succeeded Jupp Heynckes as head coach in June. Bayern saw off Hanover with a side featuring the likes of Diego Contento, Xherdan Shaqiri, Daniel van Buyten and Claudio Pizarro as Guardiola rotated his squad before Saturday's visit of the Wolves and next Wednesday's Champions League clash away to Manchester City. However, the reigning European champions want more silverware and are endlessly looking for ways to improve, so there was a little frustration with the nature of Wednesday's performance. ""We shifted down a gear after going 2-0 up and Hanover were immediately right back in the game, we can't let that happen again,"" said Thomas Mueller, who scored twice in the German Cup second-round win. In contrast, Wolfsburg team manager Mike Schuessler admitted he ""didn't find many weaknesses"" after watching Guardiola's Bayern, while director of sport Klaus Allofs said: ""We'll need a good performance to get a result there."" Ex-Bayern midfielder Luiz Gustavo will be back in the Wolfsburg side after serving a one-match ban while another former Munich star, Ivica Olic, should be able to play despite carrying an ankle injury and Brazilian midfielder Diego should be fit too. Bayern have no new injury concerns with Spain midfielders Javi Martinez and Thiago Alcantara working their way back to fitness after minor operations. Elsewhere, league leaders Dortmund host Freiburg on Saturday with a question mark over left-back Marcel Schmelzer after the Germany defender aggravated a thigh injury in the 2-0 German Cup win over second-division 1860 Munich. Schmelzer is back in training, ""but whether that is enough for Saturday, we'll have to see,"" said coach Jurgen Klopp, whose team face Marseille in the Champions League next Tuesday. Dortmund are definitely without right-back Lukasz Piszczek, who is recovering from hip and groin surgery, midfielder Ilkay Gundogan, who has a back injury, and captain Sebastian Kehl, who has torn ankle ligaments. Dortmund dropped their first points of the season in last Saturday's 1-1 draw at Nuremberg, while Freiburg have yet to win a match this season after three draws and three defeats. Bayer Leverkusen boss Sami Hyypia has said there will be changes to his team on Saturday at fourth-place Hanover 96 ahead of Wednesday's Champions League clash at home to Spain's Real Sociedad. However, Australia's Robbie Kruse is looking to make his second start for the club after netting twice in last Saturday's 4-1 rout of Mainz. Ex-Holland coach Bert van Marwijk has taken charge at struggling Hamburg, and the Hanseatic club are looking for only their second win of the season as they go to Eintracht Frankfurt. HSV are already in the relegation zone after a disastrous start to the season and the 61-year-old van Marwijk was named as Thorsten Fink's successor on Monday after signing a two-year deal worth 1.4 million euros ($1.9 million) a year. ""My mission is to look at the structures in place and clarify the style of play,"" said Van Marwijk, who inherits a side who have been routed 5-1 and 6-2 by Hoffenheim and Dortmund respectively this season. ""We have to leave the bottom of the table as quickly as possible."" Fixtures (kick-offs 1330 GMT unless stated)"

Germany star Thomas Mueller scored twice against Hanover while veteran striker Claudio Pizarro, who netted a first-half goal, said Bayern are hitting form under Guardiola but must keep improving with City looming. ""When we use our chances, we are difficult to stop, but after going 2-0 up against Hanover, we stopped doing that,"" said the 34-year-old. ""It was okay to do that against Hanover but against a bigger team it can be deadly and we mustn't allow that to happen."" Having been 2-1 up at halftime, Bayern pulled away in the second half with a second goal from Mueller before France winger Franck Ribery hit their fourth. Guardiola, who succeeded Jupp Heynckes as Bayern coach in June after the team won the treble of European, league and cup titles last season, said he was pleased to see Munich's fighting spirit come out. ""We played well, although in the last ten to 15 minutes of the first-half we lost our shape,"" said Guardiola. ""But I was surprised how we played in the second half. With our mentality, we started playing forwards again."" With five goals after the first two rounds of the German Cup, Bayern's Mueller again showed lethal finishing against Hanover. ""He is always dangerous, whether he scores with the head, chest or shoulder,"" said Lahm, after Mueller's first goal flew in off his chest."

""We all wish him a speedy recovery and will do everything possible to help with the rehabilitation."" A decision on when the 27-year-old will undergo surgery will be taken later in the week as a 2-0 win over second division Aalen was stained when he went down injured in the 31st minute. ""It's a very difficult moment but I know my family, my teammates and our supporters will give me the support to come back quickly,"" said Vieirinha. The offensive midfielder, who came up through the Porto youth system before making his mark in Greece with PAOK, had played in all six Bundesliga matches this season and scored his first goal during the 4-0 rout of Schalke on matchday two.

Striker Anthony Modeste gave Hoffenheim the lead just before the break, then provided a superb through ball for Volland to pounce on, turn the defence and hit the bottom right-hand corner. ""It was a great pass from Anthony, things are going well for me, I worked hard in pre-season which gave me confidence,"" said the Germany Under-21 skipper. ""I just want to have a good season with Hoffenheim and anything else would just be a bonus,"" he added when asked about a possible call up to Joachim Loew's senior Germany side. Gladbach pulled a goal back when Swedish striker Branimir Hrgota powered through the Hoffenheim defence fifteen minutes from time, but the defeat left Lucien Favre's side in mid-table.

On Saturday, Borussia Dortmund picked up their fifth win to maintain their 100 percent record with a 6-2 romp at home to Hamburg to stay top of the league.

392,15/09/2013,11:10,Football: Bayer's Kruse targets strong start at United,Australia's Robbie Kruse has said Bayer Leverkusen need to hit the ground running at Manchester United's Old Trafford on Tuesday to build some Champions League momentum.,"The 24-year-old joined Sami Hyypia's Leverkusen in July from Fortuna Duesseldorf and admits it would be a dream come true to make his Champions League debut against David Moyes' United. ""We are in a difficult group, it's important to start well and this is a tough test, everyone knows how strong Manchester United are, but we have the talent,"" Kruse told AFP. ""If we stick to the game plan, hopefully we can get a good result."" Having come off the bench in Leverkusen's last two Bundesliga matches, Kruse is eager to play on Old Trafford's hallowed turf and make his Champions League debut at the ""Theatre of Dreams"". ""It'll be wonderful just to be in the stadium and to be on the bench and it'll be excellent if I get the chance to come on,"" he said. United's star strikers Robin van Persie and Wayne Rooney both netted in Saturday's 2-0 league win over Crystal Palace as Moyes earned his first home win since succeeding Alex Ferguson. But Kruse said the Leverkusen squad are relishing the challenge. ""The boys are up for it. We have a great opportunity to show how good Bayer Leverkusen are and hopefully I can be a part of that,"" he said. ""United are an excellent side on paper, it may be a time of adjustment for them with a new manager, but they still have world-class players with plenty of strength up front."" Bayer face Spain's Real Sociedad, then Ukrainian champions Shakhtar Donetsk in consecutive home fixtures next month in Group A and a good result in Manchester would provide momentum. Leverkusen warmed-up for their trip to Manchester with a 3-1 win over 10-man VfL Wolfsburg on Saturday with Germany striker Stefan Kiessling scoring twice as Kruse came off the bench late on. Having been a regular at Duesseldorf last season, Kruse is now battling Germany's Sidney Sam for Leverkusen's right wing berth. With two appearances in Leverkusen's opening five games, Kruse has been described by Hyypia as ""a victim of competition"" in the Bayer squad, but the Socceroos star is biding his time. ""It's been a massive step up, I have gone from knowing I would play every week at Fortuna Duesseldorf to being part of a big squad at Leverkusen,"" said Kruse. ""It's hard to get in and once you're there, you have to play well to keep your place and I have to bide my time. ""It's about being patient and being ready when the chances come."" Kruse describes Bayer boss Hyypia, the ex-Liverpool defender, as a ""wonderful coach"" and is targeting a first-team place to help secure his place with the Australia squad at the Brazil World Cup. Having scored and set up two goals in the 4-0 World Cup qualifier win over Jordan in June, Kruse was in the Australia team humbled 6-0 by hosts Brazil in a friendly earlier this month. The World Cup hosts ran riot in Brasilia on Brazil's independence day, but Kruse said Holger Osieck's Australia team can only learn from the result ahead of next month's friendly with France in Paris. ""Brazil were simply much better than us across the field,"" admitted Kruse. ""It was an embarrassing defeat, but there is no point dwelling on it, we have some games coming up and we still have the World Cup next year. ""They were just better footballers than us and are one of the strongest teams in the world at the moment. ""They picked probably their strongest team, which was playing on their national independence day, we just weren't up to scratch."""

Hamburg responded as defender Zhi-Gin Lam scored his first goal with a thunderbolt from outside the area on 26 minutes, before centre-back Heiko Westermann headed the second on 49 minutes. But Dortmund then hit top gear as Aubameyang grabbed his second by burying Mkhitaryan's pass before the Gabon winger set up Lewandowski for Dortmund's fourth. With Hamburg's defence in disarray, Germany winger Marco Reus slotted past goalkeeper Rene Adler, then Lewandowski compounded the guests' misery when he headed the sixth just shy of the final whistle. Borussia remain the only Bundesliga side with a 100 percent record after five games ahead of Wednesday's trip to Napoli in their Champions League opener. Earlier, second-half goals by Croatia striker Mario Mandzukic and France winger Franck Ribery gave Bayern the three points at Munich's Allianz Arena in their win over Hanover 96. It was the ideal preparation for Pep Guardiola's team who begin their Champions League campaign at home to CSKA Moscow on Tuesday, but director of sport Matthias Sammer was far from happy.

The victory lifts the Royal Blues up to eighth, while Mainz are fifth. Werder Bremen crashed to their third consecutive defeat when they went down 3-0 at home to Eintracht Frankfurt.

The win at Munich's sold-out Allianz Arena in front of 71,000 fans marks the start of a busy seven-day period for Bayern who have an away league game at Freiburg on Tuesday, then travel to Prague for Friday's showdown with Chelsea for UEFA'S Super Cup. Guardiola started with a star-studded attacking midfield with wingers Robben and Ribery either side of Spain's Thiago Alcantara and Germany playmaker Mario Goetze, who made his debut for Bayern after joining from Borussia Dortmund. The hosts rode their luck in the first-half as only the crossbar denied Nuremberg when striker Daniel Ginczek's shot clattered off the underside with Munich goalkeeper Manuel Neuer beaten on 15 minutes. Bayern were awarded a penalty on 33 minutes by referee Christian Dingert when Robben was brought down by Sweden defender Per Nilsson, but the replay showed the Dutchman used his hand to keep the ball from going out. Justice was served when David Alaba's spot kick was saved by Nuremberg goalkeeper Raphael Schaefer. With time running out, Ribery headed home before a crisp shot from Robben on 78 minutes to maintain Bayern's 100 percent record this season in the league. Goal-difference leaves Bayern third behind leaders Borussia Dortmund, who beat Werder Bremen 1-0 at home on Friday, and second-placed Bayer Leverkusen. Schalke, who need to win at Greece's PAOK on Tuesday to progress to the Champions League group stages after drawing 1-1 in Wednesday's play-off first-leg, suffered another confidence-sapping defeat as they lost 2-1 at Hanover 96. The guests had defender Benedikt Hoewedes sent off on 14 minutes for bringing down Hanover striker Mame Diouf with only the goalkeeper to beat and Hungary midfielder Szabolcs Huszti drilled home the penalty. Diouf then headed home three minutes from the break to leave Schalke reeling before striker Adam Szalai pulled one back for Schalke in the second-half. Having also been hammered 4-0 at Wolfsburg last Saturday, Schalke have just one point from their first three games, leaking nine goals and scoring four, leaving them 14th in the table. Another defeat at PAOK will leave coach Jens Keller in a precarious position. Champions League side Leverkusen earned their third straight win with a 4-2 victory at home to Borussia Moenchengladbach with Germany midfielder Sidney Sam scoring twice in front of national coach Joachim Loew. Mainz are the fourth team to maintain a 100 percent record after they enjoyed a 2-0 win at home to VfL Wolfsburg, who had new signing Luiz Gustavo sent off for a second yellow card on just his second appearance since signing from Bayern.

399,22/08/2013,02:04,Football: Dortmund's Klopp wary of 'slumbering' giants Bremen,Coach Jurgen Klopp has admitted he is wary of Friday's opponents Werder Bremen as Borussia Dortmund aim to maintain their 100 percent record to stay top of the Bundesliga.,"Bremen and Dortmund are two of the five German league teams to have won both of their opening games leaving Borussia top of the table only on goal difference. Defending champions Bayern Munich, Champions League side Bayer Leverkusen, who host Borussia Moenchengladbach on Saturday, and Mainz 05, who are home to VfL Wolfsburg the same day, are the other three Bundesliga times with 100 percent records. Bremen have won both their matches under new coach Robin Dutt by with 1-0 victories away against promoted Eintracht Braunschweig and home to Augbsurg respectively having flirted with relegation last season. Bremen last lifted some silverware when they won the German Cup in 2009, but Klopp said their is too much talent in the Bremen team to take them lightly at Dortmund's Westfalenstadion. ""There is a lot of attacking potential slumbering in this Bremen squad, so we have to be very careful,"" said Klopp with Bremen expected to give Argentinian striker Franco di Santo his debut after signing from Wigan Athletic a week ago. Champions League finalists Dortmund have had just four days to prepare for Bremen's visit since their 2-1 home win over promoted Braunschweig last Sunday. Borussia needed 75 minutes before rising star Jonas Hofmann broke the deadlock with a super strike before Germany's Marco Reus netted a penalty to claim the three points. Klopp expects Bremen to have a similar game plan to Braunchweig to defend hard and hit Dortmund on the break whenever possible. ""Bremen have showed they are very patient, it might be that Bremen will have similar match plan as Braunschweig,"" said the 46-year-old. Dortmund's Australian reserve goalkeeper Mitchell Langerak could be set to play with Roman Weidenfeller suffering from gastroenteritis, while Germany midfielder Ilkay Gundogan sits out again with a back injury he aggravated on international duty last week. Defending champions Bayern host Nuremberg on Saturday with Germany midfield star Mario Goetze set to make his league debut since joining from Borussia Dortmund for 37 million euros (US$49.5m). ""Obviously it's going to take a little longer before I recover my rhythm and really get back to 100 percent,"" said the 21-year-old Goetze who has not played since tearing his hamstring in April's Champions League semi-final at Real Madrid for Dortmund. France winger Franck Ribery is out with an ankle injury he suffered in last Saturday's 1-0 win at Eintracht Frankfurt. Javi Martinez, who has yet to lose a league game for Bayern, is in contention for selection again having been left out of the match day squad at Frankfurt after a long flight back from Ecuador after playing for Spain. Hamburg travel to Hertha Berlin on Saturday looking for an improved performance after they were hammered 5-1 at home to Hoffenheim last Saturday. Coach Thorsten Fink was so furious with his team that he gave them two days off, but both midfielder Tomas Rincon and defender Dennis Aogo have been thrown out of the squad for using the time to fly to Mallorca. ""The two days off had been meant to think about what they could do better in future, not to go partying. They couldn't have made a worse decision,"" said Hamburg CEO Carl Jarchow, with the north German team having leaked eight goals in just two games.

The 26-year-old has signed a five-year deal at the Volkswagen Arena as he looks to cement his place in the Brazil squad ahead of next year's World Cup. ""I spoke to (Brazil coach Luiz Felipe) Scolari. He gave me his opinion and that allowed me to come to the right decision,"" Luiz Gustavo said. No transfer fee has been announced, although Allofs described reports that they had agreed to pay 22 million euros ($29.4m) as well as an annual salary of 8 million euros as being ""a long way from the reality"". He had fallen down the pecking order at Bayern during their run to the treble of Champions League, Bundesliga and German Cup last season and the summer arrivals of Mario Goetze and Spain's Thiago Alcantara had even further reduced his chances of making Pep Guardiola's team. Luiz Gustavo first arrived in Germany with Hoffenheim before moving to Bayern in January 2011 for 17 million euros. He made a total of 36 appearances last season for the Bavarians and also helped his country win the Confederations Cup in June. He won his 12th cap in the midweek friendly in Switzerland, which Brazil lost 1-0"

402,16/08/2013,02:15,Football: Robben relaxed as Goetze set for Bayern debut,Arjen Robben has said Mario Goetze's imminent league debut for Bayern Munich can only be a good thing for the defending champions ahead of Saturday's Bundesliga trip to Eintracht Frankfurt.,"Goetze, 21, came off the bench and scored twice for Bayern in Sunday's friendly win at Hungarian champions FC Gyor, his first appearance since tearing a hamstring while playing for previous club Borussia Dortmund in the Champions League semi-finals last season. Having cost Bayern 37 million euros (US$49.2m), Goetze is another top name coach Pep Guardiola needs to accomodate in his star-studded midfield. Goetze is an option alongside Spain Under-21 captain Thiago Alcantara in an attacking midfield role, flanked by France winger Franck Ribery and Germany's Thomas Mueller, leaving Dutchman Robben on the bench. The 29-year-old, who scored Bayern's winning goal in May's Champions League final against Dortmund, only returned to the starting line-up last season after injury to Toni Kroos, but the he said competition for places is a healthy thing in the Bayern ranks. ""It was our strength last season that we never lost our quality, even when players dropped out with injury,"" Robben told German daily Bild. ""You have to trust yourself and not be afraid of the opposition. ""And with a World Cup at the end of the season, even if you sit out the occasional game, it could be a positive thing at the end of the day."" With 10 full international midfielders in the Bayern squad, Brazil's Luiz Gustavo is on the verge of a move to VfL Wolfsburg according to reports while Munich travel to a Frankfurt side who are licking their wounds just now. While Bayern kicked off the season with a 3-1 win over Borussia Moenchengladbach last Friday, Eintracht were hammered 6-1 at promoted Hertha Berlin. And they could be forgiven for feeling a sense of trepidation ahead of this weekend's game, given that Bayern have not lost in any of their last 19 away matches in the Bundesliga. Bayern's Spain star Javi Martinez will also be looking to maintain his remarkable Bundesliga record of having yet to lose a German league match after 25 wins and three draws. Champions League finalists Dortmund host promoted Eintracht Braunschweig on Sunday with Germany midfielder Ilkay Gundogan out for two weeks with a back injury he aggravated playing for his country in Wednesday's 3-3 draw with Paraguay. Dortmund got off to a flying start last weekend when Gabon forward Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang scored a hat-trick on his Bundesliga debut in the 4-0 win at Augsburg. And Poland striker Robert Lewandowski is set to make his 100th league appearance having scored 55 goals in Germany's top flight. Having won promotion, Braunschweig went down to a late goal at Werder Bremen last weekend. Their coach Torsten Lieberknecht and Dortmund boss Jurgen Klopp were teammates at Mainz between 1995 and 2001, while Lieberknecht's last five games for Mainz came with Klopp as coach. Hertha are flying high after their 6-1 victory at home to Frankfurt which went down as the biggest win on the opening day of the season for any newly-promoted club in Germany's top flight. Having spent last season in Germany's second tier, the club from the capital's result left them as the surprise league leaders after the first week. ""The standings are just a snapshot, if we get beaten 6-1 next week, no one will be interested in what happened against Frankfurt anymore,"" said Hertha captain Fabian Lustenberger.

Having made six international appearances, Draxler has been ruled out of Germany's friendly in Kaiserslautern as Germany head coach Joachim Loew prepares for next month's World Cup qualifiers against Austria and the Faroe Islands. ""The injury could quickly get inflamed and turn into a long drawn-out affair, so it makes no sense (for him to play on Wednesday),"" said Schalke team manager Horst Heldt. Heldt said it would be ""tight"" for Draxler to be fit for Schalke's next Bundesliga match against VfL Wolfsburg on Saturday.
