0,13/02/2021,17:38,Haaland spares Dortmund blushes,A late equaliser from Erling Braut Haaland spared Borussia Dortmund's blushes on Saturday as they drew 2-2 at home against Bundesliga rivals Hoffenheim.,"Haaland's 81st minute strike averted a fourth defeat in five Bundesliga games for crisis-hit Dortmund. Yet even a draw leaves Dortmund three points adrift of the Champions League places in sixth, and heaps more pressure on interim coach Edin Terzic. Dortmund have won just four of ten league games since Terzic took the reins from Lucien Favre in December, prompting growing speculation over his future. Yet veteran defender Mats Hummels defended his coach on Saturday and backed Dortmund to revive their season. ""It's never the case that things are exactly how you want them a few weeks after a new coach takes over. That wasn't the case years ago under Jurgen Klopp, and it isn't the case now under Edin,"" Hummels told Sky. ""We're working hard, and success will come,"" he added. England international Jadon Sancho gave Dortmund a perfect start, racing up the left-wing to score his fourth league goal this season on 24 minutes. The lead didn't last long, as Munas Dabbur scuffed a shot past Marwin Hitz to level just seven minutes later. Ihlas Bebou bundled in Hoffenheim's second just after half-time, the ball bouncing off the Togolese and into the goal as Hitz tried to beat away a dangerous cross from the left wing. Haaland had a goal ruled out for offside in the second half before pouncing on a misplaced pass to snatch a crucial late equaliser. Fellow Champions League hopefuls Bayer Leverkusen also dropped points after they conceded two late goals to draw 2-2 with strugglers Mainz. Lucas Alario tapped in a low Moussa Diaby cross to give Leverkusen the lead on 14 minutes. Patrik Schick appeared to have sealed three points with a second on 84 minutes. Yet second-from-bottom Mainz were rewarded for a brave performance as late goals by Robert Glatzel and Kevin Stoeger saved a point and continued their recent revival under new coach Bo Svensson. Elsewhere, Werder Bremen were held to a 0-0 draw at home to Freiburg while Sami Khedira helped rescue a 1-1 draw for Hertha Berlin against boyhood club Stuttgart. ""It was the first time I'd ever played against Stuttgart so it was strange, but it was nice to come back,"" Khedira, who joined Hertha from Juventus in January after a decade abroad, told Sky. Austrian striker Sasa Kalajdzic headed in his ninth goal of the season to give Stuttgart the lead at the end of a scrappy first half. Veteran midfielder Khedira came off the bench in the second-half and set up a late equaliser for 17-year-old Luca Netz to save the capital club from a fifth straight defeat."
1,17/01/2021,17:41,Lewandowski scores record 21st league goal in Bayern win,Robert Lewandowski set a new record for the first half of a Bundesliga season on Sunday by netting his 21st league goal of 2020/21 as leaders Bayern Munich went four points clear with a 2-1 win over Freiburg.,"Lewandowski's early strike was cancelled out by a Nils Petersen equaliser before Thomas Mueller grabbed Bayern's late winner having earlier set up his Polish team-mate's record-breaking goal. The win saw Bayern open a four-point lead as the only top five club to win this weekend. With a game in hand, Lewandowski has broken Gerd Mueller's record of 20 goals in 17 matches for the first half of a German league season, set in 1968/69. Lewandowski, FIFA's best male player of 2020, has now scored nine goals in his last six league games He is on course to also break Mueller's all-time record of 40 goals in a single Bundesliga season from 1971/72. At exactly the same point during his record season, 49 years ago, 'The Bomber' Mueller had scored 17 goals, compared to Lewandowski's 21. Before kick-off, Bayern board member Oliver Kahn said the European champions will not sign any new players in this transfer window. However, Bayern again looked vulnerable and jaded after a league defeat at Moenchengladbach and shock German Cup exit at second division Holstein Kiel. As heavy snow fell in Munich, Lewandowski needed just seven minutes to give Bayern the lead when he fired home Mueller's pass after a Serge Gnabry run. Leroy Sane replaced Gnabry around the half-hour mark after the Germany winger limped off with a thigh strain. Lewandowski hit the post early in the first half and Freiburg goalkeeper Florian Mueller reacted quickly with a low save to deny Leon Goretzka. Petersen grabbed Freiburg's equaliser a minute after coming on as his low diving header hit the net from his first touch of the game on 62 minutes. Mueller restored their lead when he side-footed Sane's attempted volley into the net for the winning goal 16 minutes from the whistle. However the visitors laid seige to the Bayern goal and Petersen nearly grabbed another equaliser in added time when he clattered the Bayern crossbar, which sent snow flying, with Manuel Neuer beaten."
2,16/01/2021,02:45,German football's philosophical coach,"Embattled Bayern Munich face the Bundesliga's longest-serving current coach on Sunday in Christian Streich, the unorthodox trainer who has made buoyant Freiburg a force to be reckoned with, especially in recent weeks.","Freiburg have climbed the German table from 14th to eighth on the back of a club-record five straight league wins. Last Saturday's 5-0 thrashing of Cologne was Freiburg's biggest league victory for more than 20 years. Not that Streich gets excited about such things. ""It's not about records - the important thing is that we keep developing,"" he insisted. In contrast, Bayern are reeling from Wednesday's shock German Cup exit at second division Holstein Kiel and a 3-2 league defeat at Moenchengladbach. ""Bayern led 2-0, then lost 2-3, so you can imagine what's going on in Munich...."" said Streich, who fully expects to feel Bayern's wrath on Sunday. In football's luxury world of five-star hotels and private jets, Streich has both feet planted on the ground. He has a philosophical approach to the enormous transfer fees paid for football players. ""The god of money is getting bigger and bigger,"" he said after Paris Saint Germain paid Barcelona the world-record fee of 222 million euros ($268 million) for Brazil star Neymar in 2017. ""Eventually it will devour everything. But most people will only notice when everything has been devoured."" The 55-year-old encourages his players to talk about politics and current affairs. His press conferences often address issues far beyond football's cloistered world. When chancellor Angela Merkel controversially allowed an influx of refugees to come to Germany during the 2015 crisis, Streich did not hold back in his support of her decision. ""Right now is the time to open up to people, to receive them, to reduce fears,"" Streich said. ""It is often about the fear of others and the fear of strangers. ""It's about getting to know other ways of thinking."" Streich has just passed the milestone of a rare nine years in charge of Freiburg, three times longer than any of his current Bundesliga peers. The father of two lives in Freiburg and has been known to cycle to home games and, like many Germans, he is a self-confessed fan of naturism, known as 'Freikoerperkultur'. ""I'm not exactly your ideal marketing product,"" he said after being appointed Freiburg coach. ""I'm just a normal guy - no tattoos, no piercings."" Since Streich took charge in January 2012, Freiburg's picturesque Schwarzwald Stadion is a notoriously hard place for away teams to win. He has stuck with the club through thick and thin, ensuring Freiburg's return to the Bundesliga in 2016 just a year after relegation. Streich was born in Weil am Rhein, where the French, German and Swiss borders meet. The son of a butcher, he moved to neighbouring Freiburg as an 18-year-old, playing for amateur outfit Freiburger FC, Stuttgart Kickers, the city's main club Freiburg and Homburg. After a broken metatarsal cut short his playing career in 1995, he started coaching Freiburg's junior teams. He won three junior German Cup titles and one national title in charge of Freiburg Under-19s. In the process, Streich developed the talents of would-be future Germany internationals Dennis Aogo, Sascha Riether and Turkey defender Omer Toprak. He insists his home is Freiburg and rejects the idea of moving clubs to enhance his coaching CV. ""I get to go home to my family and friends every day - it's a privilege,"" he said. Streich has never tasted victory over current league leaders Bayern at the Allianz Arena, losing seven times in Munich. His only victory in 15 games against the Bavarian giants is a 2-1 home upset in 2014/15. ""I'm really looking forward to the game, insanely so,"" he said earlier this week. ""Matches against Bayern are always great experiences. ""And if they take us apart because they're so good - then that's the way it is,"" he added."
3,15/01/2021,16:52,Flick under pressure as Bayern Munich face in-form Freiburg after cup crash,Bundesliga leaders Bayern Munich host in-form Freiburg on Sunday under pressure to bounce back from consecutive defeats including their shock midweek German Cup exit.,"Freiburg are on a club record five-game winning streak in the league while Bayern are licking their wounds after crashing out of the German Cup to second-division Holstein Kiel in a penalty shoot-out. ""The team will now have to show the coach that what happened was a hiccup,"" Bayern chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge told Munich newspaper TZ. It was the first time for 20 years that Bayern have exited the cup in the second round to a club outside the Bundesliga and ends any potential repeat of last year's treble haul. The shock defeat left Bayern coach Hansi Flick knowing the European champions ""must do better"" having also thrown away a two-goal lead in last Friday's 3-2 league loss at Moenchengaldbach. ""That's their right,"" Flick said concerning the displeasure of his superiors, ""they are the ones who are in charge at Bayern Munich. ""We have to immediately get back on track,"" he added firmly. Flick is under pressure from all sides. Working as a TV pundit, former Bayern midfielder Bastian Schweinsteiger has criticised the tactic of defending high up the pitch. ""It's unnecessary in my eyes, then you shouldn't complain if your opponent plays the right ball"" behind the defence, Schweinsteiger said. Despite defeat at Gladbach, Bayern keep their two-point lead in the table as Borussia Dortmund were the only top six club to win last weekend with a 3-1 victory at second-placed RB Leipzig. Erling Braut Haaland scored twice at Leipzig to prove he is over a hip injury, while England winger Jadon Sancho has scored in his last two games. At home to Mainz on Saturday, fourth-placed Dortmund are without Belgium midfielder Axel Witsel, who could be sidelined for months by a torn Achilles tendon. In his absence, Emre Can is expected to partner Thomas Delaney in the defensive midfield. After wins over top-six clubs Wolfsburg and Leipzig, Dortmund want a home win over bottom side Mainz to help trim the five-point gap behind Bayern. ""It was a very good step in Leipzig, but it won't do us any good if we don't build on it,"" said Dortmund coach Edin Terzic. Leipzig want to be the first team this season to win at Wolfsburg on Saturday. ""Whether Bayern are currently weak or not has no effect on us,"" said Leipzig head coach Julian Nagelsmann. ""After defeat against Dortmund, we want to keep our good position in the league - that is only possible with a win,"" he added. Third-placed Bayer Leverkusen are at Union Berlin on Friday without new signing Timothy Fosu-Mensah as the ex-Manchester United defender is quarantined after completing his transfer from the UK. The Schalke teenager became the first American to score a Bundesliga hat-trick in last Saturday's 4-0 win at Hoffenheim. The win lifted Schalke off the bottom of the table, but they are six points short of escaping the bottom three. On Sunday, Schalke are away to Eintracht Frankfurt, who have signed Luka Jovic on loan back from Real Madrid after the Serbian striker struggled to adapt in Spain. Likewise, Schalke are reportedly in talks with Klaas-Jan Huntelaar, 37, who they want to sign on loan from Ajax. The Dutch striker scored 126 goals in 240 appearances for the Royal Blues from 2010-17. 21 - minutes 19-year-old Hoppe needed to complete his hat-trick against Hoffenheim on only his fifth Bundesliga appearance. 24 - league goals Bayern have conceded this season, more than any other top six club. 25 - Bundesliga goals Luka Jovic scored in 54 games for Frankfurt before signing a six-year contract with Real Madrid last year in a transfer reportedly worth 60 million euros ($73 million). Fixtures (all times 1430GMT unless stated)"
4,02/01/2021,23:20,Olmo fires RB Leipzig top of Bundesliga ahead of Bayern Munich,RB Leipzig dislodged Bayern Munich at the top of the Bundesliga table Saturday as Dani Olmo's second-half goal was enough to seal a 1-0 win at Stuttgart.,"""It was really good for me and the team to start the year with a win,"" Olmo told DAZN. With European champions Bayern at home to strugglers Mainz on Sunday, Leipzig took the chance to go a point ahead as Olmo fired through the legs of Stuttgart goalkeeper Gregor Kobel. Stuttgart's Swiss shot-stopper had earlier pulled off some heroics by using his foot to save a Emil Forsberg first-half penalty attempt. Leipzig also wasted a golden chance when Amadou Haidara fired wide just after the break. With 23 minutes left, Spain midfielder Olmo finally got the breakthrough, finishing a move he started after Leipzig had moved the ball across the Stuttgart penalty area. ""It feels good to be top,"" admitted Leipzig defender Willi Orban. ""The first half was good, the second was better - we were clearly the dominant team."" Earlier, Bayer Leverkusen blew the chance to take first place after stumbling to a 2-1 defeat at Eintracht Frankfurt which saw them drop to third as the league resumed after a two-week break. ""I have made my feelings clear in the dressing room,"" Leverkusen head coach Peter Bosz told Sky. ""We deserved to lose. Frankfurt had a better claim to the victory."" Leverkusen midfielder Nadiem Amiri scored with a deft back-heel flick to give the visitors the lead after only 10 minutes in Frankfurt. However, Amin Younes equalised to make it 1-1 at half-time before Japan midfielder Daichi Kamada put in a cross which Leverkusen defender Edmond Tapsoba turned into his own net. Before kickoff, Frankfurt director Fredi Bobic confirmed reports his club are interested in Bayern's teenage striker Joshua Zirkzee, 19, after selling Dutch forward Bas Dost to Brugge. Zirkzee could back up Frankfurt's top scorer Andre Silva, who has notched nine league goals this season. Union Berlin rose to fourth - into the Champions League places for the first time in the club's history - after their 2-0 win at Werder Bremen. Liverpool loanee Taiwo Awoniyi, who has scored in his last three league games, capped another impressive display with a goal and assist. After Bremen lost the ball in their own half, the 23-year-old Nigeria international took advantage of a two-on-two situation by drawing the defence and passing to Sheraldo Becker, who fired home on 12 minutes. Awoniyi doubled Union's lead on 28 minutes by tapping the ball over the line, just out of the reach of Bremen goalkeeper Jiri Pavlenka. Bremen had a penalty appeal turned down when a shot by Japan midfielder Yuya Osako clipped the hand of a Union defender, then Romano Schmid had a goal ruled offside. Hoffenheim lost both defender Kevin Akpoguma and Germany midfielder Sebastian Rudy with early leg injuries as they crashed to a 3-1 home defeat to Freiburg. With the hosts struggling to reshuffle, Freiburg were 3-0 up at half-time thanks to a Baptiste Santamaria goal, a Vincenzo Grifo penalty and an own goal by Senegal defender Kasim Adams. Hoffenheim scored a second-half consolation goal through Togo winger Ihlas Bebou. Borussia Moenchengeladbach, who host Manchester City in the first leg of the Champions League last 16 next month, earned their first win in five league games with a 1-0 victory at Arminia Bielefeld. Swiss striker Breel Embolo netted the winning goal just after half-time when he held off a defender and fired home. Mid-table Augsburg rebounded after back-to-back defeats with a 1-0 win at Cologne with Brazilian winger Iago netting the late winner. Bottom side Schalke are now 30 games without a win -- one short of the Bundesliga record -- after a 3-0 defeat away to Hertha Berlin. Former Tottenham manager Christian Gross, installed as Schalke's fourth head coach this season, got off to a losing start as Arsenal loanee Matteo Guendouzi, Colombia striker Jhon Cordoba and his replacement, Poland forward Krzysztof Piatek, scored for Hertha. Having netted two minutes after coming off the bench, Piatek had a second late goal ruled offside."
5,16/12/2020,23:00,Schalke 04 short of the longest winless streak,Robert Lewandowski passed the milestone of 250 Bundesliga goals on Wednesday with both goals in Bayern Munich's 2-1 home win over Wolfsburg to keep the European champions in touch with German league leaders Bayer Leverkusen.,"Lewandowski, who finds out Thursday whether he has been voted FIFA's player of the year having been shortlisted alongside Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi, has scored 18 goals in 17 games for Bayern this season in all competitions. ""I haven't thought about it (the awards), I was just focused on this game - I'm pretty relaxed about it, let's see what happens,"" he told Sky after his two goals. Leverkusen, who host Bayern in Saturday's top-of-the-table clash, remain first in the table - a point ahead of Munich - after a 4-0 romp away to Cologne in the Rhineland derby. Wolfsburg took a shock lead within five minutes at the Allianz Arena when Leroy Sane's error on the edge of the area led to Maximilian Philipp smashing home the loose ball. Wolfsburg's Dutch striker Wout Weghorst then had a goal ruled offside on 17 minutes. However, Lewandowski reached the 250-goal milestone when he headed Bayern's equaliser just before the break. He became only the third to achieve the feat alongside Bayern legend Gerd Mueller and Schalke striker Klaus Fischer. Lewandowski then fired the winner into the bottom corner of the net on 50 minutes. He has now claimed 23 goals in 20 league matches against Wolfsburg. Wolfsburg suffered their first league defeat this season as Bayern got back to winning ways after drawing their two previous league games. In Cologne, Leverkusen remain the league's only unbeaten team after racing into a 2-0 lead on ten minutes thanks to goals by Mitchell Weiser and Moussa Diaby. Czech striker Patrik Schick added Leverkusen's third early in the second half when he buried Diaby's cross before former Cologne player Florian Wirtz grabbed the visitor's fourth. Things remain tight at the top of the table as third-placed RB Leipzig stayed level on 28 points with Bayern with a 1-0 win at Hoffenheim thanks to Yussuf Poulsen's second-half winner. Schalke 04 are three short of matching an unwanted Bundesliga record after their 2-0 home defeat against Freiburg left the league's bottom side without a win in their last 28 games. ""We lose hope too quickly. We must have more belief,"" Schalke defender Benjamin Stambouli told Sky. Schalke are closing in fast on the record, held by Tasmania Berlin who in their one Bundesliga season, went 31 matches without winning in 1965/66. Schalke coach Manuel Baum, who took charge in September after predecessor David Wagner was fired, already has the unwanted club record of being winless in his first 10 games. Freiburg winger Roland Sallai headed the visitors ahead after 50 minutes behind closed doors in Gelsenkirchen, then added a second 18 minutes later when he chipped home a perfectly-timed pass. Having only ended their own nine-match winless streak on Saturday with a 2-0 home victory against Arminia Bielefeld, Freiburg are up to 10th in the table. Schalke have now not won a game since January. With a third of the season gone, they are six points from safety and on course for relegation after 30 unbroken seasons in Germany's top tier. This Saturday, Schalke have their next chance to end their miserable run at home to Bielefeld, who remain in the bottom three after Wednesday's 1-0 home defeat to Augbsurg."
6,28/11/2020,17:41,Lewandowski hits 15th goal of season as Bayern Munich stay top,Robert Lewandowski claimed his 15th goal this season in all competitions as Bundesliga leaders Bayern Munich came from behind to claim a 3-1 win at Stuttgart on Saturday.,"After 19-year-old striker Tanguy Coulibaly gave Stuttgart a shock early lead, Kingsley Coman equalised before Lewandowski drilled home from 20 metres to put Bayern 2-1 up at the break. Brazil winger Douglas Costa, a second-half replacement for Coman, grabbed Bayern's third goal late on to seal the win which leaves the holders two points clear of RB Leipzig. Dortmund are third, four points behind Bayern, after crashing to a shock 2-1 defeat at home to Cologne, as Leipzig climbed above them thanks to a 2-1 home win over Arminia Bielefeld. Cologne avoided a club record 19th match without a win with their first victory in Dortmund since 1991."
7,07/11/2020,18:33,"Leipzig go top in Germany ahead of Bayern, Dortmund showdown",RB Leipzig went back to the top of the Bundesliga table on Saturday with a 3-0 home win over Freiburg before Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund clash in the evening showdown.,"Defender Ibrahima Konate fired home Leipzig's opener before midfielder Marcel Sabitzer added their second goal with a 70th-minute penalty. Manchester City loanee Angelino claimed Leipzig's third with a stunning free-kick which curled over the Freiburg wall just before the final whistle. The home win put Leipzig top, a point ahead of Bayern and Dortmund who meet later at Signal Iduna Park. ""We really deserved the win - we were very, very good in the first-half,"" said Leipzig head coach Julian Nagelsmann. He was especially pleased with Konate's opening goal from a towering cross before winger Christopher Nkunku, who scored in the mid-week win over Paris Saint Germain, won the penalty which Sabitzer converted after the VAR scrutinised the decision. ""We have trained a lot from set pieces,"" said Nagelsmann. ""It certainly wasn't an obvious penalty, but if the VAR says it was, then it must have been,"" he added after Nkunku went down after the slightest of touches from Freiburg defender Nicolas Hoefler. Union Berlin climbed to fourth with a 5-0 home thrashing of strugglers Arminia Bielefeld. Former Germany striker Max Kruse helped set up Union's first three goals, then converted a late penalty. After just three minutes, Japan winger Keita Endo scored his first goal for Union when he swept home Sheraldo Becker's final pass after Kruse's superb long pass. Endo went off with an injury soon after, but Union kept up the pressure as Kruse set up the next two goals for centre-back Robert Andrich and winger Becker. Kruse, 32, capped an outstanding display by converting a penalty before Cedric Teuchert, a right wing replacement for Becker, grabbed Union's late fourth goal. At the other end of the table, bottom side Mainz were held to a 2-2 draw at home to Schalke, who sit one place above them and have now gone 23 games without a league win dating back to January. After Daniel Brosinski and Jean-Philippe Mateta converted penalties for Mainz, Mark Uth pulled a goal back for Schalke who were 2-1 down late on. Schalke took a deserved point back to Gelsenkirchen when Mainz defender Jeremiah St. Juste turned the ball into his own net eight minutes from time. After five games without a win, Hertha Berlin roared back with a 3-0 win in the fog at Augsburg. Forwards Matheus Cunha, Dodi Lukebakio and Krzysztof Piatek, who cost Hertha 24 million euros ($28 million) from AC Milan in January, got on the scoresheet as Augsburg's defence crumbled."
8,01/11/2020,18:16,Alario double guides unbeaten Leverkusen past Freiburg,Argentina striker Lucas Alario continued his fine run of form with two crucial first-half goals as Bayer Leverkusen came from behind to beat Freiburg 4-2 in the Bundesliga on Sunday.,"After a disastrous first half hour for Leverkusen, Alario struck twice before the break to turn the game on its head and fire his team back into the top four. The Argentine now has seven goals from eight games in all competitions, and has found the net in each of his last three league appearances. Leverkusen, meanwhile, remain the only Bundesliga team yet to be beaten after the first six games of the season. Freiburg took the lead after just three minutes, Lucas Hoeler latching onto a 50-yard through ball from Lukas Kuebler and flicking the ball past Leverkusen keeper Lukas Hradecky. Jonathan Schmid doubled the lead with a brilliant volley five minutes later but the goal was annulled after Hoeler was ruled offside in the build-up. Leverkusen were bracing themselves for a long afternoon when Sven Bender was shown the red card for a trip on Hoeler in front of goal, but the decision was reversed by VAR. Having ridden their luck in the first half hour, Leverkusen ruthlessly took their chances from then on, with Alario turning the game on its head with two quick goals before half-time. The Argentine pounced on a misplaced pass from Nicolas Hoefler to slot home the equaliser, before turning in a low cross from Lars Bender to put Leverkusen ahead just minutes before the break. Peter Bosz's side looked to be in the clear when Nadiem Amiri smashed in a third on 65 minutes, but a tap-in from substitute Nils Petersen quickly brought Freiburg back into the game. Yet the home side's revival was short-lived, as centre-back Jonathan Tah rose high at a corner to head in Leverkusen's fourth and seal the three points. While Leverkusen return to the top four, Freiburg now sit just three places adrift of the bottom three, having not won since the opening day of the season."
9,24/10/2020,18:30,Lewandowski hits hat-trick as Bayern Munich rout Frankfurt,Robert Lewandowski took his Bundesliga tally to 10 goals in five games this season with a hat-trick as Bayern Munich thumped Eintracht Frankfurt 5-0 on Saturday.,"Lewandowski has scored nine goals in his last three league games and wrapped up his treble within an hour at the Allianz Arena. Defending champions Bayern have scored 22 goals this term -- 10 more than league leaders RB Leipzig who stayed top with a 2-1 win over 10-man Hertha Berlin. Bayern sit one point behind in second place. In Munich, Leroy Sane marked his return from injury with the fourth goal during a brief cameo, before England Under-17 midfielder Jamal Musiala also came off the bench to net the fifth. However, Bayern's victory could come at a price as Canadian left-back Alphonso Davies was in clear distress after going off early with an ankle injury. Lewandowski underlined his status as one of the world's best strikers last season by scoring a career-best 55 goals in 47 games, including 34 in the Bundesliga. The Polish international opened the scoring on 10 minutes when he fired home after a Thomas Mueller pass. Frankfurt goalkeeper Kevin Trapp couldn't do anything to stop Lewandowski's header from a Joshua Kimmich corner in the 26th minute. Bayern had a penalty appeal turned down when Douglas Costa's cross clipped the hand of Frankfurt's Makoto Hasebe. Lewandowski wrapped up the victory on the hour mark with a clinical finish from another Costa cross. After sitting out the last two games, Sane ghosted past a defender and drove a shot into the bottom corner with 18 minutes to play. Manuel Neuer pulled off a great save to deny Frankfurt striker Bas Dost before Musiala grabbed the final goal as the visitors suffered their first league defeat of the season. Leipzig came from behind to seal a 2-1 win over Hertha, whose Colombian striker Jhon Cordoba scored in the eighth minute. Leipzig drew level when defender Dayot Upamecano fired home from a free-kick on 11 minutes, but Berlin were reduced to 10 men after the break when substitute Deyovaisio Zeefuik was shown two yellow cards within four minutes of coming on. Leipzig made the man advantage count when Marcel Sabitzer converted a penalty with 13 minutes left. Hertha were lucky not to finish with nine men when another sub, Jessic Ngankam, scythed down Leipzig left-back Angelino and the referee changed his decision to a yellow card having initially showed a straight red. Borussia Moenchengladbach warmed up for Tuesday's Champions League game at home to Real Madrid with a 3-2 comeback win at Mainz. Germany midfielder Lars Stindl gave Gladbach an early lead, but the visitors were 2-1 down at half-time after French striker Jean-Philippe Mateta scored twice for Mainz. Gladbach midfielder Jonas Hofmann converted a penalty on 76 minutes, after a shot by replacement Marcus Thuram was blocked by a Mainz hand before Matthias Ginter headed the winner as Gladbach climbed to fifth. Union Berlin were held to a 1-1 draw at home to Freiburg as Vincenzo Grifo's first-half goal was cancelled out two minutes later by Union midfielder Robert Andrich."
10,03/10/2020,17:58,Haaland nets twice as Dortmund run riot,Erling Braut Haaland again demonstrated his deadly finishing by netting twice on Saturday as Borussia Dortmund climbed to second in the Bundesliga table with a 4-0 demolition of Freiburg.,"Dortmund bounced back from last weekend's shock defeat at Augsburg as Haaland shone to leave him on 21 goals in 23 games for Dortmund since his January transfer as the burly Norwegian claimed clinically-taken goals. Having also scored in Wednesday's German Super Cup 3-2 defeat at Bayern Munich, the 20-year-old Haaland has netted five goals in as many games this season. Dortmund were missing England winger Jadon Sancho and goalkeeper Roman Buerki, both recovering from illness having tested negative for the coronavirus. Club captain Marco Reus made his first start for eight months after a groin injury. US teenager Giovanni Reyna, who assisted all three goals, was outstanding alongside Reus in the attacking midfield role for Dortmund. The 17-year-old played Haaland into space for the burly Norwegian to score both his goals, then delivered a pin-point corner for Emre Can's headed goal. Haaland, 19, once again showed dazzling finishing when he fired home from a right angle on 31 minutes. Can then rose highest from a corner and his bullet header put Dortmund 2-0 up two minutes after the break. Reyna and Haaland combined again when they got in behind the defence as the American delayed his pass which the Norwegian hammered into the net on 66 minutes. Winger Felix Passlack claimed his first Bundesliga goal in added time to complete the rout with Haaland providing the final pass. Defending champions Bayern Munich host Hertha Berlin on Sunday out to bounce back from last weekend's shock defeat at Hoffenheim to end their 23-match winning streak. Eintracht Frankfurt top the league table after their 2-1 win over previous leaders Hoffeheim. Croatia striker Andrej Kramaric netted his eighth goal in four games with a superb strike, curled inside the far corner, to give Hoffenheim the lead on 18 minutes. However, Japan midfielder Daichi Kamada turned the game when he tapped home on 54 minutes, then powered through the defence before Bas Dost stabbed the ball over the line on 19 minutes from time. It could have been 3-1 as Frankfurt had a late goal disallowed. Champions League side Moenchenegladbach romped to a 3-1 win at Cologne as Alassane Plea and Stefan Lainer fired home before Lars Stindl added a penalty on 56 minutes. Cologne scored a consolation goal when Elvis Rexhbecaj beat Gladbach keeper Yann Sommer from 20 metres out. Bremen earned a second win in three games when Leonardo Bittencourt's right-footed shot on 27 minutes sealed their 1-0 win at home to new boys Arminia Bielefeld. The hosts survived a late scare as Bielefeld had a goal disallowed just before the whistle. Leverkusen were held to a 1-1 draw at Stuttgart as Patrik Schick's early goal was cancelled out by an equaliser by the hosts' striker Sasa Kalajdzic. On Friday, Union Berlin enjoyed their first win of the season with a 4-0 thumping of Mainz at home as Germany striker Max Kruse scored his first goal for the hosts."
11,19/09/2020,21:15,Haaland and Reyna shine as Dortmund youngsters down Gladbach,Erling Braut Haaland scored twice and 17-year-old Giovanni Reyna shone as youthful Borussia Dortmund swept aside fellow Champions League side Borussia Moenchengladbach 3-0 on Saturday on the opening weekend of the Bundesliga season.,"After holders Bayern Munich had kicked off the 2020/21 campaign on Friday with a record 8-0 thrashing of Schalke, Dortmund's youngsters also dazzled at home to Gladbach. ""It was a really good start to the season. We have a lot of young guys, it's fun to play with guys near my age,"" said USA Under-17 international Reyna. ""This is an exciting group and we have to keep working."" Haaland converted a second-half penalty, then again showcased his clinical eye for goal by finishing a superb counter as Dortmund attacked from their own goal. Coach Lucien Favre banked on youth by starting two 17-year-olds in Reyna and England Under-21 midfielder Jude Bellingham, who made his league debut, with Sancho and Haaland, both 20, leading Dortmund's attack. Reyna, making just his third league start, paid back the faith by scoring the opening goal and winning the penalty Haaland converted. Reyna drilled home Bellingham's superb pass from a tight ankle on 34 minutes, then had his ankle clipped after a darting run into the area to win the penalty for Haaland. Sancho tried to convince Haaland to let him take the spot-kick, but ""I was confident whoever took it, would score, which is the most important thing"" said Reyna. Haaland then stole the show with a stunning end-to-end sprint to support Sancho's break before crashing home Dortmund's third goal on 78 minutes. The towering Norwegian, the first player in Bundesliga history to score a hat-trick from the bench, now has 18 goals in 20 games for Dortmund since his arrival in January. For the first time since March, some German league clubs were able to welcome back limited numbers of fans, depending on permission from local health authorities. The biggest crowd of the day was in Dortmund, as 9,300 cheered the impressive home win. ""It's amazing to have fans back, they support us so much,"" added Reyna. Having finished runners-up to Bayern for the last two seasons, Dortmund are on a collision course with the European champions who they meet in the German Super Cup showdown on September 30 in Munich. Earlier, Hertha Berlin's new-signing Jhon Cordoba scored on his debut in a 4-1 away romp at Werder Bremen as the ambitious capital city club also threw down an early marker. In front of 8,500 in Bremen, Hertha defender Peter Pekarik and Belgian-born winger Dodi Lukebakio scored quick-fire goals at the end of the first half to leave Werder 2-0 down at the break and the hosts were whistled off the pitch by their own fans. Colombia striker Cordoba, signed from Cologne in mid-week, came on to start the move which Brazil Under-23 forward Matheus Cunha finished as Hertha went 3-0 up with an hour gone. Davie Selke scored Bremen's second-half consolation goal before Cordoba capped his debut by tucking home Hertha's fourth goal on 90 minutes. Just like Bayern, Cologne also had to play behind closed doors due to a rising rate of infection for their 3-2 home defeat to Hoffenheim, for whom Andrej Kramaric scored a hat-trick. The Croatia striker put the visitors ahead after three minutes following a mix up in defence, netted a penalty and smashed home the winning goal in added time after Cologne had launched a late fight back. In the capital, playmaker Michael Gregoritsch and winger Andre Hahn scored late goals as Augsburg beat hosts Union Berlin 3-1 in front of 4,600 fans. Newly-promoted Arminia Bielefeld earned a point with a 1-1 draw at Eintracht Frankfurt on their return to the top flight in front of 6,500. Stuttgart, who also came up, gave Freiburg a scare with late goals by Sasa Kalajdzic and Silas Wamangituka as they fought back in a 3-2 defeat in front of 8,000."
12,27/06/2020,18:01,"Bremen snatch play-off survival chance, champions Bayern rout Wolfsburg","Werder Bremen gave themselves hope of avoiding relegation from the German Bundesliga by thrashing Cologne 6-1 to grab a play-off place on the last day of the season, while champions Bayern Munich routed Wolfsburg before lifting the trophy on Saturday.","Japan striker Yuya Osako scored twice as Bremen stole the lifeline of the relegation/promotion play-off place from Fortuna Duesseldorf, who lost 3-0 at Union Berlin and were relegated with Paderborn, finishing one point behind Bremen. Florian Kohfeldt's Werder will face second-tier opponents in either Heidenheim or possibly neighbours, rivals and fellow fallen giants Hamburg in the play-off first leg on Thursday. Bremen have spent more seasons than any other team in the Bundesliga, having only spent one term in the second tier, in 1980-81. A burst of goals from Osako, Milot Rashica and Niclas Fuellkrug -- all in the space of eight minutes -- had Werder 3-0 up at the break against Cologne at the Weserstadion. Former Everton midfielder Davy Klaassen then fired home a rebound just after the break before Osako, facing his old side, added his second and USA international Josh Sargent completed the rout. Dominick Drexler pulled a goal back for Cologne. Werder, the four-time Bundesliga champions, also needed a favour from Berlin and got one as Union beat Fortuna 3-0 with goals from Nigerian duo Anthony Ujah and Suleiman Abdullahi either side of veteran midfielder Christian Gentner's effort. Bremen will find out their play-off opponents on Sunday, with Heidenheim currently in the play-off place ahead of the final round of matches in the second division. At Wolfsburg, Bayern striker Robert Lewandowski scored a penalty for his 34th league goal of the season, finishing as the top scorer for the fifth time. Kingsley Coman, Michael Cuisance and Thomas Mueller also got on the scoresheet as Bayern, champions for the eighth straight season, finished 13 points clear of second-placed Borussia Dortmund. Mueller set up Coman for Bayern's opening goal to finish the campaign with a league record 21 assists, and his goal that rounded out the win was also Bayern's 100th league goal this season -- one short of the Bundesliga record. Wolfsburg captain Josuha Guilavogui was sent off for a second yellow card after fouling Cuisance, leading to Lewandowski's penalty. Meanwhile, Borussia Moenchengladbach and RB Leipzig secured qualification for next season's Champions League after 2-1 wins over Hertha Berlin and Augsburg respectively, as fifth-placed Bayer Leverkusen missed out by two points despite beating Mainz 1-0. Dortmund, who had already wrapped up second place, crashed to a 4-0 home defeat by Hoffenheim, for whom Croatia striker Andrej Kramaric scored all four goals, including one penalty. That result allowed Hoffenheim to leapfrog Wolfsburg and take sixth place, although both sides will go into the Europa League next season along with Leverkusen. Before kick-off in Dortmund, Mario Goetze, whose winning goal sealed Germany's victory in the 2014 World Cup final, was given a send-off by the club. He will leave this summer with his contract having expired, but the 28-year-old attacking midfielder has not announced his future club. Elsewhere, Timo Werner signed off with a brace in RB Leipzig's 2-1 win at Augsburg in what was his final appearance for the club before moving to Chelsea. Schalke's disastrous second half of the season was completed with a 4-0 thrashing at the hands of Freiburg as they finished the season 12th, having been third in December. Eintracht Frankfurt beat bottom side Paderborn 3-2 in Saturday's other game."
13,05/06/2020,22:47,Freiburg hand Gladbach Champions League setback,Borussia Moenchengladbach's push for a Champions League place was stalled by Freiburg who clinched a 1-0 win in the Bundesliga on Friday.,"Gladbach, enjoying their best season since 1984, remain in fourth place - the final Champions League qualifying spot - on 56 points. However, Bayer Leverkusen could replace them on Saturday should they defeat defending champions and league leaders Bayern Munich. With just four games left, Freiburg boosted their Europa League hopes with victory secured by Nils Petersen's goal in the 58th minute. Petersen had only been on the pitch for a minute after replacing Roland Sallai when he powerfully headed home from a free-kick. To make matters worse for Gladbach, their French striker Alassane Plea was red-carded in the second half. French striker Marcus Thuram, who made global headlines last weekend when he took a knee to protest the death of George Floyd, was unable to breakthrough despite his side having the best of the first hour. When Plea was sent-off, Gladbach's sporting director Max Eberl protested too vigorously through his anti-coronavirus face mask and was also dismissed. Plea will now miss next weekend's home clash with Bayern Munich."
14,30/05/2020,21:10,Lewandowski hits brace as Bayern Munich go 10 points clear,Bayern Munich opened a 10-point lead at the top of the Bundesliga on Saturday with a 5-0 drubbing of relegation-threatened Fortuna Dusseldorf behind closed doors with the league's top-scorer Robert Lewandowski scoring twice.,"Duesseldorf defender Mathias Joergensen scored an early own goal before Benjamin Pavard, Lewandowski (2) and Alphonso Davies hit the target. With five games left, Bayern, who have won their last eight league games, are comfortably on course for an eighth straight league title. However, second-placed Borussia Dortmund could trim their lead on Sunday at bottom side Paderborn. Several records fell as Lewandowski now has 43 goals in all competitions, a season's best for the Poland striker with games in hand. Also head coach Hansi Flick claimed his 22nd win in his first 25 games, bettering the start made by Pep Guardiola when he took charge in 2013. ""Statistics and records don't interest me, what's important is to have a successful season,"" said Flick, in his first season since replacing Niko Kovac in November. ""At Bayern Munich, you are expected to win. I am very happy, we were very aggressive and didn't give them any chances."" Lewandowski, who had never previously scored in six games against Duesseldorf, made amends with goals either side of half-time. Fortuna, who were unbeaten in their three games since the league resumed after a two-month coronavirus-enforced hiatus, were humbled at the Allianz Arena where they last poached a 3-3 draw in November 2018. They fell behind on 15 minutes when Joergensen turned the ball into his own net after Pavard mishit his shot. Right-back Pavard then grabbed the second with a powerful header on 29 minutes before Lewandowski made it 3-0 just before the break after being presented with a tap-in by Thomas Mueller. Duesseldorf were floored with two goals in as many minutes as Lewandowski profited again with another poacher's goal after Serge Gnabry's good work. Davies then scored the game's best goal. After some high pressing, the Canadian teen won the ball in the Duesseldorf area, barged past a succession of defenders and fired home to make it 5-0 on 52 minutes. Werder Bremen boosted their survival hopes with a 1-0 win at Schalke, who are winless in 11 games and continue to plummet. Midfielder Leonardo Bittencourt scored a first-half winner. ""This is a very, very important away win,"" said Bremen coach Florian Kohfeldt. ""We have taken seven points from the last three games, but if you look at the table, we are still behind."" Bremen have spent more seasons in the Bundesliga than any other club, but currently sit second from bottom. However, Saturday's victory leaves them just three points from guaranteed safety with six games left. They are two points behind Duesseldorf in 16th, which carries a relegation play-off at the end of the season. Werder could climb out of the relegation places for the first time since December on Wednesday if they beat Eintracht Frankfurt at home. Bittencourt hit a stunning strike from just outside the box which beat Schalke's Bayern-bound goalkeeper Alexander Nuebel on 32 minutes. Schalke succumbed to their fourth straight defeat, piling pressure on head coach David Wagner. In the same game, Schalke's American midfielder Weston McKennie wore a 'Justice for George' armband as part of the growing protests over the death of an unarmed black man during a police arrest in the United States. ""To be able to use my platform to bring attention to a problem that has been going on too long feels good!!!,"" tweeted 21-year-old McKennie. ""We have to stand up for what we believe in and I believe that it is time that we are heard."" George Floyd died in Minneapolis in an arrest by a police officer who pinned him to the ground for several minutes by kneeling on his neck. Hertha remain unbeaten with three wins and a draw since Bruno Labbadia took charge during the lockdown after their 2-0 win at home to Augsburg thanks for goals by Javairo Dilrosun and Krzysztof Piatek. Having routed Leverkusen 4-1 away on Tuesday, Wolfsburg crashed to a 2-1 defeat at home to 10-man Eintracht Frankfurt. Japan midfielder Daichi Kamada scored the winner 10 minutes from time while Frankfurt had replacement midfielder Lucas Torro sent off in the dying stages for a second yellow card. Frankfurt took the lead when striker Andre Silva converted a penalty on 27 minutes, but Wolfsburg equalised when right-back Kevin Mbabu headed home on 58 minutes. Hoffenheim are seventh after their 1-0 win at Mainz thanks to Ihlas Bebou who darted into the area, swept past two defenders, and fired home on 43 minutes. On Friday, Leverkusen went third when Germany midfielder Kai Havertz became the first player in Bundesliga history to score 35 goals before his 21st birthday to seal a 1-0 win at Freiburg."
15,29/05/2020,22:42,Havertz fires Leverkusen third with Freiburg winner,Exciting youngster Kai Havertz broke another Bundesliga record on Friday after scoring the winner in a 1-0 victory at Freiburg which moved Bayer Leverkusen into third place.,"Havertz, 20, became the first player in the history of the league to reach 35 goals before turning 21 years old eight minutes after the break, when he combined with Leon Bailey before squeezing home under intense pressure from Dominique Heintz. The dynamic German was already the youngest player to reach 50 and 100 appearances in the German top flight and became the youngest ever player to score a league goal for Leverkusen in 2017. Havertz's goal was his fifth in his four appearance since the Bundesliga returned from its coronavirus-enforced break and puts Leverkusen a point ahead of fourth-placed RB Leipzig, who travel to Cologne on Monday night. They are also three points ahead of Borussia Moenchengladbach in fifth ahead of their match with Union Berlin on Sunday. Havertz's goal was the first shot on target in a largely drab encounter in which Freiburg could have snatched at least a point. Lucas Hoeler missed a glaring opportunity for the hosts two minutes before the break, pushing wide when sent through one-on-one with Leverkusen stopper Lukas Hradecky. And chasing an equaliser late on, Nils Petersen forced Hradecky to save the three points for Leverkusen with a fine first time strike that the goalkeeper did well to tip away."
16,17/05/2020,21:04,Five things from the Bundesliga comeback,Bayern Munich maintained their four-point lead at the top of the Bundesliga as Germany gave fans across the world their first taste of elite football for two months amid empty stands and stringent hygiene guidelines designed to curtail the spread of the coronavirus.,"AFP looks at the five things we learned from one of oddest weekends in the game's history. The Bundesliga has a head start of at least a month on the other major leagues aiming to restart this summer, and some of strange scenes seen in Germany will become the new normal should football return to England, Italy and Spain. La Liga and Serie A are aiming for mid-June as a potential start date for their suspended seasons, and fans in both countries may have to get used to silent, empty stadiums, socially-distanced goal celebrations, footballers in face masks and the spectre of players catching COVID-19. Italy's clubs for example are debating a medical protocol that currently rules that if a player tests positive for the virus he and anyone who has come into close contact with him must be quarantined for two weeks, in contrast to Germany where only the player is isolated. How Bundesliga teams fare under their hygiene regulations could provide the model for the coming months. Heading into his team's tough trip to giant-killers Union Berlin, Bayern Munich coach Hansi Flick wondered whether his team would be able to last a full 90 minutes after only being given the go-ahead to resume full team training last week. However a dominant display in the German capital, against a team that had already beaten two different league leaders at home this season, showed why they are the strongly-tipped to win their eighth straight league title. Bayern had two thirds of possession at the Alten Foesterei stadium, and once Robert Lewandowski slotted home his 26th league goal of the season from the penalty spot five minutes before the break, the result was never in doubt as the champions went on to claim a 2-0 win. In the aftermath of Dortmund's 4-0 thumping of Ruhr rivals Schalke, teen striking sensation Erling Braut Haaland was a young man of few words with the awaiting media desperate for something from the 19-year-old goal machine. However, according to AFP subsidiary SID, Haaland mumbled a total of eight English words to reporters, including ""Why not?"" and ""Yes"". It didn't really matter, as Haaland had done his talking on the pitch, picking up where he left off before the world went into virus lockdown. The Norwegian, who turns 20 this summer, swept home the opener, the league's first goal of its restart, before laying on the first of Raphael Guerreiro's brace, showing once again that he is Europe's player to watch. He has 41 goals this season in all competitions and 13 for Dortmund in just 12 games since joining in January from Red Bull Salzburg. Specialist website DWDL.de reported on Sunday that over six million people in Germany watched the first top-tier matches in two months, with 3.68 million tuning into broadcaster Sky Germany's subscription channels on Saturday. A further 2.45 million tuned into the 'Konferenz' -- a simultaneous live broadcast of the five afternoon games -- on free-to-air Sports News Channel. Sky Germany had a market share of 27.4 percent on their pay-to-view channels and 18.2 percent on their free channel. The German Football League (DFL) told AFP that matches were televised by more than 70 broadcasters worldwide, all on previously-agreed deals. British newspaper the Daily Mail reports that UK viewers were left frustrated as the BT Sport application showing the matches buckled under the weight of demand from fans. Germany has one of the world's most vibrant football fan cultures, with raucous fans packing stadiums where entrance fees are priced at a fraction of what Premier League fans have to shell out. And while millions tuned in to watch some live football, a significant portion of match-going supporters are livid at the idea of games going ahead without the noisy backdrop provided by German fans. On Saturday Augsburg fans left a banner inside their team's ground which read ""Football gives life -- your business is sick"". St Pauli, meanwhile, on Sunday published a picture on Twitter of a banner that read: ""Football lives through its fans! Without you, it's all nothing!"""
17,16/05/2020,17:36,Leipzig title hopes hit by Freiburg draw on Bundesliga restart,"RB Leipzig were held to a 1-1 draw by Freiburg as the Bundesliga restarted following the coronavirus suspension on Saturday, suffering a further knock to their dwindling title hopes.","Julian Nagelsmann's third-placed side sit four points behind league leaders Bayern Munich ahead of the reigning champions' visit to Union Berlin on Sunday, and it would have been worse if Freiburg midfielder Robin Koch's late effort had not been ruled out by VAR. Leipzig's title dreams had started to slip away before the lockdown started, as back-to-back draws with Bayer Leverkusen and Wolfsburg in March had seen them fall five points off the pace. Players and coaches sitting on the bench wore protective masks in compliance with the stringent safety guidelines implemented to allow the Bundesliga to resume before Europe's other top leagues. The hosts started brightly at an eerily-quiet Red Bull Arena, with Timo Werner and Nordi Mukiele both going close to opening the scoring in the first half an hour. But Freiburg claimed a surprise lead 12 minutes before half-time as Vincenzo Grifo's low corner was diverted in by centre-back Manuel Gulde. Leipzig continued to dominate possession in the second period and wasted a golden chance in the 57th minute as on-loan Everton winger Ademola Lookman volleyed wide when totally unmarked just yards from goal. Freiburg had to rely on their goalkeeper the next time Leipzig carved them open, as Alexander Schwolow stretched out a leg to brilliantly deny Werner a 28th goal of the season. Leipzig gave themselves fresh hope of turning the game around in the 77th minute, though, as Yussuf Poulsen headed past Schwolow. The home side pushed for a winner, as Marcel Sabitzer and Patrik Schick joined Lookman in coming off the bench, but failed to carve out another clear-cut opportunity. Instead, it was Freiburg who thought they had snatched a dramatic injury-time victory, only for Koch's close-range finish to be ruled out for offside following a VAR review."
18,07/05/2020,14:22,Bundesliga moves restart from May 15 to following day,"The German league announced Thursday it has pushed back the planned restart of the Bundesliga from Friday, May 15, until the following day.","German Chancellor Angela Merkel has granted permission for the Bundesliga to resume behind closed doors with strict hygiene measures, plus regular testing of players and backroom staff. Christian Seifert, CEO of the German Football League (DFL), confirmed on Thursday that matches will resume on Saturday, May 16. Second-placed Borussia Dortmund host arch rivals Schalke in the Ruhr derby in the pick of the matches on the first day back. Defending champions Bayern Munich, who sit four points clear of Dortmund, will travel to face Union Berlin on the Sunday. The Bundesliga will be the first of Europe's top leagues to restart since the coronavirus pandemic forced lockdown measures across the continent.

19,05/05/2020,03:15,"In 'weird' times, Freiburg's Schmid prepares for football's restart","Freiburg midfielder Jonathan Schmid said he is ""not at all"" afraid to return to the pitch but acknowledges that a second wave of coronavirus infections would put paid to German football's plans to complete its interrupted season.","""Germany wants to finish their championship,"" the 29-year-old Frenchman told AFP. ""We're training for that. We'll be ready when it resumes."" The German Football League (DFL) wants to restart matches in empty stadiums from May 16, providing it gets the final green light from Chancellor Angela Merkel's government. A decision is expected on Wednesday. Those plans were thrown into question on Monday when the league said its testing of players, coaches and backroom staff had produced 10 positive cases. Three are known to be from top-flight side Cologne. Germany has been less affected by the pandemic than other European countries, an outcome partly attributed to mass testing. Schmid said any signs that football's return had produced a new surge in infections would halt the restart plans. ""If there is a second wave and it affects some clubs, I think the season will be over,"" said Schmid. ""The clubs don't want to risk everything. But it's also important to get back on track for the economic survival of the clubs."" Despite having two children, Schmid said he was not worried about the possibility of infection. ""No, not at all afraid. If we're allowed to do it, then it's safe,"" said Schmid. ""We get tested once a week. If I am positive, I will stay away from my children and my wife. That's the advantage for us, we're being followed."" Most German clubs resumed training on April 7 but put in place stringent social distancing measures. ""At first it was weird. You arrive at the training area already changed and go straight home for a shower. We don't have a lot of time to communicate either. ""We don't shake hands, we greet each other from a distance. It feels weird. The coaches don't want us to get too close to each other. ""But the most important thing is to get back on the pitch... with the ball, doing a few exercises and a fresh environment, it was a change compared to being at home!"" The training is evolving. ""Now we are working in groups of four. Avoiding contact; no tackling."" ""Football is a contact sport. A player needs that,"" Schmid said. ""We're already happy to be back on the pitch, on the ball, and having fun with a few team-mates on the field. ""We're ready to go! We've been training more intensely than we do in the pre-season. There have been a lot of sprints, a lot of changes of direction. ""To avoid injuries that we are training harder. Maybe there will be less training and more games. As a player, I'd rather play lots as they do in England than train for five days!"" If the Bundesliga resumes it will be behind closed doors, with players' voices echoing around empty stadiums. It is not the way Schmid wanted to try to lead his club into a place in European competition next season. ""I've never played behind closed doors. There'll be something missing. With the stadium and the fans behind us, it's tough for away teams to win at Freiburg. It's always a plus,"" said Schmid, who came up through the club's youth system. ""You have to be prepared for that and keep giving it your all."" There has been talk of Bundesliga players wearing masks on the field. ""Walking around with a mask is uncomfortable. I wear one when we go shopping. It's not comfortable to breathe. So playing football...,"" he said, ending with a laugh. Like their Bundesliga counterparts at other clubs, Freiburg players have taken a pay cut. ""The club asked us to lower our salaries to help groundstaff and office workers. We agreed. It was a good thing to do it compared to everything they do for us. ""We wanted to give back something that would allow them to continue to live, because they also have families and rent to pay. It's harder for them than it is for us. A little gesture does good."""

His pace and trickery unsettled Liverpool and he was rewarded with two goals before setting up Troy Deeney for the third. ISMAILA SARR (Watford) The Hornets' record signing was up against his idol Mane and stabbed home the opener at the near post and then showed his pace and poise to chip Alisson Becker for Watford's second. Sarr then turned provider for the third as he teed up Deeney to complete a famous win that lifted Watford out of the bottom three. JORDAN AYEW (Crystal Palace) Ayew scored the only goal as Palace got the better of rivals Brighton to ease any fear of being dragged into a relegation battle. The Ghanaian's strike took his league tally for the season to seven -- matching his best tally for a single campaign in England. MBWANA SAMATTA (Aston Villa) Samatta did Tanzania proud by scoring in the League Cup final against Manchester City, but his diving header at the near post just before half-time was merely a consolation for Villa as City won 2-1 to lift the trophy for a third straight season. YOUSSEF EN-NESYRI (Sevilla) En-Nesyri scored a 93rd-minute winner as Sevilla beat Osasuna 3-2 to move up to third in La Liga. The Moroccan striker, who joined Sevilla from Leganes in January, opened the scoring with a guided shot into the corner before Lucas Ocampos made it two on the stroke of half-time. Osasuna came back in the second half through goals from Aridane and Roberto Torres, only for En-Nesyri to snatch victory for Sevilla in injury-time with a close-range finish. RAMY BENSEBAINI (Borussia Moenchengladbach) Algerian Bensebaini scored a crucial early goal for Moenchengladbach as they beat Augsburg 3-2 to keep pace with the top of the Bundesliga table. Bensebaini, in his first start in 2020 after returning from injury, headed home a cross from Lars Stindl to put the visitors 1-0 up. When asked how it felt to be back in the Foals' line-up after the match, he simply replied ""it was fun"". ACHRAF HAKIMI (Borussia Dortmund) Having made his name as one of Dortmund's best going forward this season, the Real Madrid loanee was called on to do more than his fair share of defending against a stubborn Freiburg side. Working on the edge of a four-man midfield, Hakimi's pace was valuable during the 1-0 win as he snuffed out several Freiburg counter attacks. He did have a shot on goal deflected in the dying stages but was unable to add to his tally of two Bundesliga goals this season. STEPHANE BAHOKEN (Angers) The Cameroon striker was rewarded with a start for his team at Brest after coming off the bench against Montpellier last weekend and scoring the winner a minute later. He delivered again in Brest, although he needed a full 43 minutes to bag the only goal of the match this time. MAX-ALAIN GRADEL (Toulouse) Ivory Coast winger Gradel, 32, returned to the Toulouse starting line-up last weekend for the first time in a Ligue 1 game since early December following injury. He kept his place and wore the captain's armband but could not prevent the division's bottom side from going down 2-0 at home to Rennes. They have now taken just a single point from their last 17 league games and are heading fast towards relegation. KARL TOKO-EKAMBI (Lyon) Cameroon forward Toko-Ekambi, who joined Lyon on loan from Villarreal in January, came off the bench and contributed to their 2-0 win over derby rivals Saint-Etienne. Having earlier had a goal disallowed for offside, he won the late penalty which Moussa Dembele scored to seal the victory. Toko-Ekambi had started the 1-0 Champions League last-16, first leg win over Juventus in midweek and hit the bar in the first half against the Italians."

22,09/03/2019,20:39,'Perfect day' as Bayern return to Bundesliga summit with Liverpool looming,"Bayern Munich warmed up for Liverpool with a ""perfect day"" by knocking Borussia Dortmund from the top of the Bundesliga for the first time since September with a 6-0 thrashing of Wolfsburg on Saturday.","Bayern, who host Liverpool on Wednesday in their Champions League, last 16, return leg clash after a goalless draw at Anfield, went top on goal difference from Dortmund, who needed late goals to win 3-1 at home to Stuttgart. ""I'm very pleased. We want to be just as focused on Wednesday,"" said Bayern head coach Niko Kovac. Bayern ran riot in Munich as Robert Lewandowski scored twice, leaving him with 20 goals in 17 league games against Wolfsburg, while Serge Gnabry, James Rodriguez and Joshua Kimmich also netted. ""We are now where we want to be -- first in the table and that's where we want to stay,"" added Kovac with nine rounds of league games left. Having been told on Tuesday, along with Bayern team-mates Jerome Boateng and Mats Hummels, that his Germany career is over, Mueller took out his frustration, setting up the first goal and scoring Munich's second. ""The three wanted to give a response and they all played well -- it was a perfect afternoon,"" said goal-scorer Kimmich. Gnabry gave Bayern the lead on 34 minutes at the Allianz Arena by tapping home Mueller's cross, then turned provider three minutes later when he served up a simple tap in for Lewandowski to make it 2-0. Rodriguez, thriving in the attacking midfield role, got on the scoresheet when his superb 52nd-minute shot hit the top corner. Having set up the first goal, Mueller showed Germany head coach Joachim Loew what he is missing by wrong-footing Wolfsburg goalkeeper Koen Casteels to score with his heel on 76 minutes. Kimmich scored with a header on 82 minutes and Lewandowski claimed his second by guiding his header into the far corner three minutes later. Lewandowski, the top-scoring foreigner in Bundesliga history with 197 goals, has now scored in each of his last seven games against Wolfsburg, who he single-handedly battered in 2015 with five goals in just nine minutes. In Dortmund, late goals by Paco Alcacer and Chelsea-bound Christian Pulisic saw off dogged Stuttgart, but Borussia are now second after 23 weeks on top. ""I don't care about who is top now,"" said Dortmund captain Marco Reus. ""It only matters who is top at the end and everything is still open."" The win, only Dortmund's second in their last nine games, was vital to stay level on 57 points with Bayern. Despite some dogged Stuttgart defending, Dortmund took the lead at Signal Iduna Park when Reus netted a penalty on 62 minutes. The lead lasted just nine minutes as Stuttgart's Marc-Oliver Kempf headed home unmarked. However, Alcacer calmed nerves when the Spanish striker stabbed home on 84 minutes after a goal-mouth scramble. The third goal came when Axel Witsel beat three defenders, played Mario Goetze into the box to set up Pulisic, who netted in stoppage time. ""They parked a gigantic bus (in front of goal) -- it was hard to find the holes,"" complained Dortmund coach Lucien Favre. ""We tried everything and managed it, we ran a lot and defended a lot, but all in all, the win was deserved."" Third-placed RB Leipzig were held to a goalless draw at home by Augsburg, who beat Dortmund last Friday and went down fighting against Bayern last month. Mid-table Hertha Berlin crashed to a 2-1 defeat at Freiburg after the visitors captain Vedad Ibisevic cancelled out a Nils Petersen goal, but then scored an own-goal by turning the ball into the Berlin net. Later, Borussia Moenchengladbach bounced back from last weekend's 5-1 thumping at home to Bayern with a 1-0 win at mid-table Mainz, thanks to a second-half goal from defender Nico Elvedi. Gladbach stay fourth, level on 47 points with Leipzig, and both clubs lag nine points behind new leaders Bayern and Dortmund."
23,16/02/2019,18:12,Ten-man Schalke draw blank ahead of Man City clash,Schalke 04 warmed-up for the Champions League visit of Manchester City with a goalless draw at home to fellow Bundesliga strugglers Freiburg on Saturday.,"Schalke are winless in their last three Bundesliga games and sit just above the relegation places in 14th spot. Next up is a huge challenge at home to Pep Guardiola's Premier League giants Man City in their Champions League last 16, first-leg tie on Wednesday. In Saturday's bad-tempered clash, both Schalke and Freiburg finished with ten men. The Royal Blues played for nearly 50 minutes without defensive midfielder Suat Serdar, sent off for a first-half foul, while Freiburg defender Christian Guenter was dismissed late on for a second yellow card. Schalke came close to conceding a penalty with 10 minutes left when Spanish midfielder Omar Mascarell was suspected of a handball, but the video assistant referee (VAR) over-ruled the referee's initial decision. Welsh teenage winger Rabbi Matondo, who Schalke signed last month from Man City, struggled to make an impact on only his second Bundesliga appearance, his first over 90 minutes. The 18-year-old had a good chance with 16 minutes left but ballooned his shot over the bar. Freiburg hit the Schalke woodwork twice in the second half through substitutes Jerome Gondorf and Luca Waldschmidt. League leaders Borussia Dortmund are at bottom side Nuremberg on Monday. They are two points ahead of Bayern Munich, who won 3-2 at Augsburg on Friday. RB Leipzig took their chance to stay in the title race as a 3-1 win at Stuttgart left them fourth, just a point behind Borussia Moenchengladbach, who play Sunday at Eintracht Frankfurt. Yussuf Poulsen netted two goals as Leipzig took the three points. The Denmark striker opened the scoring after just six minutes when Leipzig's Germany striker Timo Werner fired in a cross, which clipped a defender's knee for Poulsen to tap home. Steven Zuber equalised from the spot for Stuttgart ten minutes later when the video assistant referee spotted the ball had hit Willi Orban's arm after a Mario Gomez header. However, Leipzig rallied as midfielder Marcel Sabitzer curled home a superb free-kick with 20 minutes left, then Poulsen claimed his second goal soon after, tapping home following an impressive run by US international Tyler Adams. Wolfsburg climbed to fifth with a 3-0 win at Mainz with goals by midfielder Maximilian Arnold, striker Wout Weghorst and defender Robin Knoche. Hoffenheim also moved up after Algeria forward Ishak Belfodil, Brazilian striker Joelinton and Germany midfielder Kerem Demirbay netted in their 3-0 win at second-from-bottom Hanover 96 to go seventh."
24,15/12/2014,17:19,Bullish Freiburg boss aims to tackle Bayern head on,Coach Christian Streich has urged his struggling Freiburg side to tackle run-away Bundesliga leaders Bayern Munich head on in Tuesday's Bundesliga match despite his team losing several key players to injury.,"Freiburg, who are 15th and just above the relegation places, are yet to win at Munich's Allianz Arena having suffered 13 defeats and two draws, coming away with a 4-0 thrashing the last time they played there in February. Streich's side, who have won just two of their 15 league matches this season, have been weakened by injuries to key midfielders Vladimir Darida and Jonathan Schmid. Strikers Philipp Zulechner and Mike Frantz are also ruled out with a cold and a bruised shin respectively. But despite their poor form and missing personnel, Streich dismissed any talk of damage limitation against Bayern who have won 12 of their 15 league games and are nine points clear in the German league table. ""Damage limitation - that's not something we're into,"" said Streich, whose side last won more than a month ago. ""We want to take the bull by the horns. ""We have lost only five of our fifteen games and are unbeaten in the other ten. ""So we're going with lots of energy to Munich."" Bayern's Spanish midfielder Xabi Alonso is their main concern as the 33-year-old has a cold while fellow defensive midfielder Sebastian Rode has a sore toe. Bayern have conceded just three goals all season and last lost to Freiburg in 1996, but their coach Pep Guardiola, as is his custom, said the team must be on their guard against a Freiburg side who play ""with their heads"". Bayern are in the middle of playing three games in six days, they thrashed Augsburg 4-0 away on Saturday, before travelling to Mainz for their final league match of the year on Friday."
25,26/09/2014,09:27,Victory needed by both Schalke and Dortmund in derby,Bayern Munich are right where they want to be atop the Bundesliga after five rounds and ahead of a tough showdown against Cologne this weekend while Schalke and Borussia Dortmund both head into the 145th derby needing a victory.,"Munich head to Cologne on Saturday to face a team which had not conceded a goal in their first four games this season until Hanover scored in the midweek round of games. Bayern are happy about where they are, knowing that the weekend/midweek rhythm is just starting with a match-up against CSKA Moscow coming in the Champions League next week. ""I think we can be satisfied after the first five games. We've picked up 11 out of a possible 15 points, three wins and two draws - that's okay,"" said Munich board chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge after the team's 4-0 victory over the previous surprise leaders SC Paderborn. ""Some people expected a bumpy start after the World Cup. We can be very satisfied with the season to date including the Champions League."" Bayern winger Arjen Robben said the win over Paderborn was important but the Cologne game matched that in their bid to stay atop the Bundesliga. ""It was really important for us to win and lay down a marker. That's what we're aiming for, where we want to be and - much more important - we want to stay there,"" said Robben. The top two challengers at the moment - Bayer Leverkusen and Hanover 96 - both have 10 points and play at teams who have not yet won this season in SC Freiburg and VfB Stuttgart respectively. Stuttgart sit second-to-last with two points after failing to hold a 2-0 lead at Dortmund in a 2-2 draw midweek. Stuttgart's troubles - they had scored just one goal going into the Dortmund match - resulted in the sacking of sporting director Fredi Bobic. ""In the end, we probably have to consider ourselves somewhat fortunate to be taking a point. With this performance, we have certainly taken a step in the right direction,"" said Daniel Didavi, who scored both goals against Dortmund. The Yellow-Blacks actually could have beaten Stuttgart but had a shot blocked at the line in stoppage time. In general, though, Dortmund know they cannot give up two goals every game. ""We need more stability in defence. We have already conceded nine goals in five matches which is not just a poor record, it is a very poor record,"" said captain Mats Hummels, who came on in the second half for his first action this season. ""We need to defend better as a team, and all eleven players have to play their part. If you concede two goals in each game, as has already happened four times this season, it's very hard to win."" And Dortmund need to win, having already dropped four points behind Bayern and three behind Leverkusen and Hanover. Schalke come into the match having finally won their first competitive match of the season - a 3-0 beating of Werder Bremen. The Royal Blues have won just one of the last four derbies at home against Dortmund. Manager Jens Keller knows his team will be well served to put together a string of victories to move back up the table. And Dortmund are a perfect opponent for that. ""We don't need to motivate the players for this match. It's the biggest derby in Germany. We are all excited for the match,"" said Keller, whose team has five points in 13th place.

26,31/08/2014,19:57,Tired Gladbach settle for Freiburg draw,Freiburg missed a penalty but picked up their first point of the new Bundesliga season following a 0-0 draw with Borussia Moenchengladbach on Sunday.,"Swiss attacker Admir Mehmedi scooped a spot-kick high over the bar midway through the second half in a drab encounter at Freiburg's Mage Solar Stadion. Gladbach had beaten FK Sarajevo 7-0 in the Europa League play-offs on Thursday but a fifth competitive match in 16 days looked to be a step too far for the visitors. Freiburg 'keeper Roman Buerki tipped over a shot from fellow Swiss international Granit Xhaka 14 minutes into a game that was desperately short of goalmouth action. Approaching the hour mark, Mehmedi found Jonathan Schmid at the back post but his volley was comfortably turned behind by Gladbach 'keeper Yann Sommer. Freiburg were given a great chance to go in front when Gladbach defender Tony Jantschke chopped down home substitute Maximilian Philipp after 62 minutes. Mehmedi blazed over, however, meaning the home side are still waiting for their first goal of the new campaign. Earlier, Mainz and Hanover 96 also played out a scoreless draw. Mainz had more of the game in the first half but Hanover striker Joselu went closest to scoring before Hiroshi Kiyotake had a shot cleared off the line for the visitors in the second half. Ja-Cheol Koo, who scored an injury-time penalty in Mainz's draw at Paderborn on the opening day, had a decent appeal for another spot-kick turned down on 13 minutes after a challenge from Leonardo Bittencourt. Shinji Okazaki fired wide from a tight angle inside the box and the Japanese striker then had his own appeal for a penalty waved away by referee Sascha Stegemann after going to ground under Hanover defender Marcelo. Hanover, who beat Schalke last weekend, almost broke the deadlock six minutes into the second half after a botched clearance from Stefan Bell fell to Kiyotake. The Japanese midfielder showed good footwork to create some space before drilling a shot towards the corner - Mainz thankful that Moritz was on the line to clear. Joselu had a chance to win it with 13 minutes left but, after Artur Sobiech picked him out in the area, he couldn't direct the ball beyond Karius and both sides had to settle for a point. On Saturday, Xabi Alonso made his Bayern Munich debut and Robert Lewandowski scored his first goal for the club as the defending champions drew 1-1 at Schalke 04. The result means that Bayer Leverkusen sit top of the fledgling table following their 4-2 home win over Hertha Berlin. On Friday, Borussia Dortmund held off a late comeback to beat Augsburg 3-2 in what was their first league win of the new campaign."
27,19/08/2014,02:05,Germany riding crest of wave as Bundesliga begins,The new Bundesliga season gets underway this weekend with German football riding the crest of a wave following the national team's triumph at the World Cup in Brazil last month.,"That thoroughly deserved victory, given to Joachim Loew's side by Mario Goetze's extra-time strike in the final against Argentina, saw a unified Germany crowned as world champions for the first time. But at club level, the Bundesliga has been leading the way for some time. It averaged 3.16 goals per game last season, considerably more than any of its major European counterparts, while average gates were over 42,000, making the German top flight the best attended league anywhere. ""In my opinion, the Bundesliga's the most attractive league in the world,"" Borussia Moenchengladbach coach Lucien Favre told bundesliga.com. ""The hype in Germany is amazing, and now they've won the World Cup so it's not going to tail off in a rush."" Nevertheless, the biggest problem facing the Bundesliga, as ever, is how to counter the dominance of Bayern Munich, who have romped to the title and added the German Cup in each of the last two campaigns. They have seen Toni Kroos and Mario Mandzukic depart and lost Javi Martinez to a serious knee injury in last week's SuperCup defeat to Borussia Dortmund, but the Bavarians remain favourites. And yet the rest can draw some hope from the very fact this is a Bundesliga season immediately following a World Cup, and that has not tended to help Bayern in the recent past. After Germany hosted the 2006 World Cup, Stuttgart went on to win the Bundesliga, while in 2011 Dortmund pipped Bayern to the title. In 2009, after Germany reached the Euro 2008 final, it was Wolfsburg who were champions. Six members of Pep Guardiola's squad played in the World Cup final, including Goetze, while Dante and Arjen Robben were also involved until the latter stages in Brazil. That is why chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge wanted the start of the new season delayed in order to give these players longer to prepare, but that request was unsurprisingly turned down by Bayern's rivals. ""We have to face the fact that the first half of the season will be difficult,"" said Guardiola, who at times had only a skeleton squad in pre-season training. ""We are at least one month behind schedule."" Guardiola has added to his squad with compatriots Juan Bernat from Valencia and Pepe Reina, who will provide competition in goal for Manuel Neuer. But the marquee signing was Robert Lewandowski, a prolific goalscorer for Dortmund in the last four years. However, Dortmund have moved to replace the Pole by signing Italy striker Ciro Immobile from Torino and Colombia's Adrian Ramos from Hertha Berlin. Stability is key at the Signal Iduna Park, where coach Jurgen Klopp, who led Dortmund to back-to-back titles in 2011 and 2012 and a Champions League final defeat to Bayern in 2013, is entering his seventh season in charge. ""We want to establish ourselves further at the top of the league and qualify directly for the Champions League,"" said sporting director Michael Zorc modestly. However, Guardiola knows where the danger lies, saying: ""We may have won the last two league titles, but they clinched the previous two. Our great challenge is to keep up our level to keep them at distance."" Beneath them, Schalke, Bayer Leverkusen and Wolfsburg will again be hoping to contend for Champions League qualification at least. Schalke have kept Klaas-Jan Huntelaar and Julian Draxler, while Sidney Sam has joined from Leverkusen, and few teams can boast a midfield as strong as Wolfsburg, with Kevin de Bruyne, Luiz Gustavo and France's Josuha Guilavogui. Bayer have signed Swiss striker Josip Drmic from Nuremberg and have a new coach in Roger Schmidt, back in his native country after winning the Austrian title with Salzburg. Hamburg will be hoping for a stable campaign after almost being relegated for the first time in their history last season. There are new coaches at Mainz, Eintracht Frankfurt and Stuttgart, who have reappointed Armin Veh, the architect of their 2007 title triumph, while Cologne are back among the elite and Paderborn are in the Bundesliga for the first time."
