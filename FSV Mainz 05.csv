0,29/01/2021,23:18,Wamangituka's stunning solo effort seals Stuttgart win,Congolese winger Silas Wamangituka scored for his fourth consecutive Bundesliga game on Friday as his end-to-end goal after an 80-metre sprint sealed Stuttgart's 2-0 win at home to strugglers Mainz.,"After striker Sasa Kalajdzic gave Stuttgart the lead ten minutes into the second-half, Wamangituka showed his stamina and skill to score with a run from the edge of his own box. With Mainz hunting the equaliser, a charged down shot fell to Wamangituka, who dribbled the length of the pitch before, beating two defenders to fire home 18 minutes from the whistle. The 21-year-old's stunning effort means he has scored 11 times in Germany's top flight this season. The win leaves Stuttgart 10th. Mainz remain second-from-bottom and seven points from escaping the relegation places after failing to build on last weekend's shock 3-2 win over second-placed RB Leipzig. League leaders Bayern Munich hold a seven-point lead before Saturday's home game against mid-table Hoffenheim."
1,23/01/2021,17:52,Leipzig slump to surprise loss at Mainz,US international Tyler Adams scored his first Bundesliga goal Saturday but RB Leipzig suffered a blow to their title hopes with a shock 3-2 defeat away to crisis club Mainz.,"Adams, 21, opened his German league account with a tap-in, pouncing on the rebound after Marcel Sabitzer hit the bar to put Leipzig ahead early on. A rare fumble from goalkeeper Peter Gulacsi allowed Moussa Niakhate to equalise for Mainz, but Marcel Halstenberg quickly restored the lead. Niakhate equalised for a second time shortly before half-time, before Leandro Barreiro turned in a Danny Da Costa cross just after the break to hand second-from-bottom Mainz only their second win this term. League leaders Bayern Munich, who play Schalke on Sunday, can now pull seven points clear at the top after third-placed Bayer Leverkusen also dropped points with a 1-0 defeat to Wolfsburg. Leverkusen started furiously, but Wolfsburg were more clinical and took the lead through a Ridle Baku header on 35 minutes. Manchester United loanee Timothy Fosu-Mensah came on at half-time for Leverkusen to make his Bundesliga debut, but his team remained toothless in the second half. The win saw Wolfsburg break into the top four, leapfrogging both Borussia Dortmund and high-fliers Union Berlin, who fell to their second defeat in a row with a 2-1 loss away to Augsburg. Florian Niederlechner broke his 16-game goal drought to put Augsburg in front on 17 minutes, before Marcus Ingvartsen drew Union level with a precise finish. Niederlechner restored the lead just after half-time, before giving away a penalty with a foul on Grischa Proemel. Yet his blushes were spared by keeper Rafal Gikiewicz, who saved Ingvartsen's spot-kick to deny former club Union a point. Union's defeat allowed in-form Eintracht Frankfurt to jump to sixth with their 5-1 win over Arminia Bielefeld. Andre Silva put Frankfurt ahead on 25 minutes, Filip Kostic doubled the lead with a sumptuous long-range effort two minutes later, and Kostic set up Silva for Frankfurt's third. Bielefeld hit back through a Sergio Cordova header, but an own goal from Joakim Nilsson and a goal from Real Madrid loanee Luka Jovic sealed the win for Frankfurt in the second half. Elsewhere, Freiburg came from behind to beat local rivals Stuttgart at home for the first time since 2012. Congolese winger Silas Wamangituka bundled in an early opener for Stuttgart, but goals from Ermedin Demirovic and Jeong Woo-yeong turned the game on its head to seal a 2-1 win for the hosts."
2,22/01/2021,03:05,Nagelsmann promises Leipzig will 'attack' Bayern in title chase,Julian Nagelsmann says his RB Leipzig team are ready to push Bundesliga leaders Bayern Munich all the way this season as they prepare for Saturday's trip to lowly Mainz.,"""We're still within striking distance (of Bayern) and want to keep attacking,"" said Leipzig coach Nagelsmann. Mainz are second-from-bottom and winless in their last nine games but gave Bayern a huge scare three weeks ago, taking a two-goal lead before losing 5-2 at Munich's Allianz Arena. However, Nagelsmann says his team were ""incredibly mature"" on Wednesday against the stubborn defence of Union Berlin, which eventually cracked in Leipzig's 1-0 home win. Ten minutes into his cameo appearance on Wednesday, Emil Forsberg combined with Dani Olmo to unpick the Union defence with great footwork. Nagelsmann dubbed the pair ""phonebox kickers"" for the close-quarters skills which led to Forsberg's winning goal, and the Swede could feature at the weekend. Bayern meanwhile are at bottom side Schalke on Sunday with goalkeeper Manuel Neuer chasing a league record at his former club. On Wednesday, Neuer equalled Oliver Kahn's record of 196 Bundesliga clean sheets. But Bayern have looked vulnerable in recent weeks. They have won their last two league games, but were lucky to get a 1-0 victory at Augsburg on Wednesday after Alfred Finnbogason hit the post with a late penalty. ""We had to fight tooth and nail at the back,"" admitted Neuer after his first clean sheet in the league since October. Coach Hansi Flick admitted that ""it's been a long time"" since his side has dominated matches as much as last season, when Bayern won the treble of Champions League, Bundesliga and German Cup titles. At the halfway stage of the campaign, Schalke are level on seven points with Mainz, 10 away from the guaranteed safety of 15th place. American striker Matthew Hoppe, 19, will try to test Neuer after grabbing headlines by scoring five goals in his last three games. The Royal Blues have beefed up their attack by bringing back Klaas-Jan Huntelaar. The Dutch veteran, 37, who netted 126 goals for Schalke from 2010 until joining Ajax in 2017, hopes to shake off a calf strain to face Bayern on Sunday. Leverkusen's French winger scored arguably the goal of the midweek round of matches in Tuesday's 2-1 win over Dortmund with a superb finish after Leon Bailey's diagonal pass. Great work by Diaby, 21, then put Florian Wirtz into space to score the winning goal to end Leverkusen's winless run of four league games. 22: Goals Bayern striker Robert Lewandowski has scored in 17 league games this season. At the same point of the 1972/72 season, in which Gerd Mueller set the all-time record of 40 goals, 'The Bomber' had scored 17 times. 422: Matches Bayern goalkeeper Manuel Neuer needed to equal the league record of 196 clean sheets, set by ex-Germany keeper Oliver Kahn, who took 557 games. 4 - At 17 years, 261 days old, Leverkusen midfielder Wirtz, who is still at school, is the youngest player to score four Bundesliga goals, beating the previous records of Kai Havertz and Timo Werner, who are now both at Chelsea.

3,04/01/2021,16:13,"Struggling Mainz hope new boss Svensson can emulate Klopp, Tuchel",Mainz appointed former fan-favourite Bo Svensson as coach on Monday in the hope he can keep them in the Bundesliga to follow in the footsteps of Jurgen Klopp and Thomas Tuchel.,"Svensson, 41, made 122 appearances for the club before retiring in 2014 and takes over from sacked Jan-Moritz Lichte with the side currently second from bottom in the league. His first game in charge will be at home to Eintracht Frankfurt on Saturday. Svensson recently coached Austrian second-division outfit Liefering, but Mainz hope he can become the next Klopp or Tuchel, who both started their coaching careers at the Opel Arena. The ex-Denmark international is the third figure with history at Mainz to return recently after their former bosses Christian Heidel and Martin Schmidt joined the board last month. ""Bo has all the qualities we're looking for in a coach,"" Heidel said. ""He learnt the job from scratch in our youth academy and also played under coaches like Jurgen Klopp and Thomas Tuchel. ""He knows what our football has to feel like."" Like Svensson, current Liverpool boss Klopp finished his playing career at Mainz and coached them from 2001-08. After he left, Klopp won back-to-back Bundesliga title with Borussia Dortmund and reached the 2013 Champions League final before moving to Merseyside in 2015. Liverpool lifted the 2019 Champions League trophy under Klopp and last season ended their 30-year-wait to be crowned English league champions. Tuchel worked at Mainz from 2009 until 2014. He replaced Klopp at Dortmund, winning the German Cup title in 2017 before steering Paris Saint Germain to two French league titles and last season's Champions League final. After playing for Mainz from 2007 to 2014, Svensson coached the club's junior teams from 2015-19 before joining Liefering. His main task is keeping Mainz up after 11 consecutive seasons in the German top-flight, but they currently have six points after 14 games. However, there were glimmers of hope on Sunday as they led European champions Bayern Munich 2-0 at the Allianz Arena before crashing to a 5-2 defeat."
4,24/12/2020,00:25,Bundesliga strugglers Mainz out of German Cup,"Crisis-hit Bundesliga club Mainz crashed out on penalties to second division side Bochum in the second round of the German Cup on Wednesday after Robert Tesche scored a dramatic, stoppage-time equaliser for the underdogs.","Jean-Paul Boetius and Danny Latza gave Mainz a comfortable 2-0 lead, but Bochum fought back through Gerrit Holtmann and a stoppage-time equaliser from Robert Tesche. Despite having goalkeeper Manuel Riemann sent off in stoppage time, the underdogs triumphed 3-0 in the penalty shootout after Mainz missed all their penalties. Defeat crowned a miserable Christmas week for Mainz, who sit second from bottom in the league and parted ways with sporting director Rouwen Schroeder on Tuesday. Elsewhere, Dutch striker Wout Weghorst scored twice as Wolfsburg thrashed second-tier minnows Sandhausen 4-0 in the second round of the German Cup Wednesday, despite losing numerous players to Covid-19 in recent days. With four players having tested positive for coronavirus in the last week and another three self-isolating, Wolfsburg were forced to list two reserve goalkeepers, Lino Kasten and Niklas Klinger, as outfield substitutes. Yet the top-flight side cruised to victory thanks to goals from Yannick Gerhardt, Joao Victor and Weghorst, who has now scored 11 goals in his last 11 games. ""My players showed from the first minute that they weren't going to worry about the difficult conditions and the absentees,"" said Wolfsburg coach Oliver Glasner. In Wednesday's other games, first-half goal from Sasa Kalajdzic saw Stuttgart to a 1-0 win over south-western neighbours Freiburg, while Werder Bremen waltzed to a 3-0 win over Hanover. In-form Rot-Weiss Essen are the last fourth-tier side left in the draw after they stunned second-division local rivals Fortuna Duesseldorf 3-2."
5,07/11/2020,18:33,"Leipzig go top in Germany ahead of Bayern, Dortmund showdown",RB Leipzig went back to the top of the Bundesliga table on Saturday with a 3-0 home win over Freiburg before Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund clash in the evening showdown.,"Defender Ibrahima Konate fired home Leipzig's opener before midfielder Marcel Sabitzer added their second goal with a 70th-minute penalty. Manchester City loanee Angelino claimed Leipzig's third with a stunning free-kick which curled over the Freiburg wall just before the final whistle. The home win put Leipzig top, a point ahead of Bayern and Dortmund who meet later at Signal Iduna Park. ""We really deserved the win - we were very, very good in the first-half,"" said Leipzig head coach Julian Nagelsmann. He was especially pleased with Konate's opening goal from a towering cross before winger Christopher Nkunku, who scored in the mid-week win over Paris Saint Germain, won the penalty which Sabitzer converted after the VAR scrutinised the decision. ""We have trained a lot from set pieces,"" said Nagelsmann. ""It certainly wasn't an obvious penalty, but if the VAR says it was, then it must have been,"" he added after Nkunku went down after the slightest of touches from Freiburg defender Nicolas Hoefler. Union Berlin climbed to fourth with a 5-0 home thrashing of strugglers Arminia Bielefeld. Former Germany striker Max Kruse helped set up Union's first three goals, then converted a late penalty. After just three minutes, Japan winger Keita Endo scored his first goal for Union when he swept home Sheraldo Becker's final pass after Kruse's superb long pass. Endo went off with an injury soon after, but Union kept up the pressure as Kruse set up the next two goals for centre-back Robert Andrich and winger Becker. Kruse, 32, capped an outstanding display by converting a penalty before Cedric Teuchert, a right wing replacement for Becker, grabbed Union's late fourth goal. At the other end of the table, bottom side Mainz were held to a 2-2 draw at home to Schalke, who sit one place above them and have now gone 23 games without a league win dating back to January. After Daniel Brosinski and Jean-Philippe Mateta converted penalties for Mainz, Mark Uth pulled a goal back for Schalke who were 2-1 down late on. Schalke took a deserved point back to Gelsenkirchen when Mainz defender Jeremiah St. Juste turned the ball into his own net eight minutes from time. After five games without a win, Hertha Berlin roared back with a 3-0 win in the fog at Augsburg. Forwards Matheus Cunha, Dodi Lukebakio and Krzysztof Piatek, who cost Hertha 24 million euros ($28 million) from AC Milan in January, got on the scoresheet as Augsburg's defence crumbled."
6,24/10/2020,18:30,Lewandowski hits hat-trick as Bayern Munich rout Frankfurt,Robert Lewandowski took his Bundesliga tally to 10 goals in five games this season with a hat-trick as Bayern Munich thumped Eintracht Frankfurt 5-0 on Saturday.,"Lewandowski has scored nine goals in his last three league games and wrapped up his treble within an hour at the Allianz Arena. Defending champions Bayern have scored 22 goals this term -- 10 more than league leaders RB Leipzig who stayed top with a 2-1 win over 10-man Hertha Berlin. Bayern sit one point behind in second place. In Munich, Leroy Sane marked his return from injury with the fourth goal during a brief cameo, before England Under-17 midfielder Jamal Musiala also came off the bench to net the fifth. However, Bayern's victory could come at a price as Canadian left-back Alphonso Davies was in clear distress after going off early with an ankle injury. Lewandowski underlined his status as one of the world's best strikers last season by scoring a career-best 55 goals in 47 games, including 34 in the Bundesliga. The Polish international opened the scoring on 10 minutes when he fired home after a Thomas Mueller pass. Frankfurt goalkeeper Kevin Trapp couldn't do anything to stop Lewandowski's header from a Joshua Kimmich corner in the 26th minute. Bayern had a penalty appeal turned down when Douglas Costa's cross clipped the hand of Frankfurt's Makoto Hasebe. Lewandowski wrapped up the victory on the hour mark with a clinical finish from another Costa cross. After sitting out the last two games, Sane ghosted past a defender and drove a shot into the bottom corner with 18 minutes to play. Manuel Neuer pulled off a great save to deny Frankfurt striker Bas Dost before Musiala grabbed the final goal as the visitors suffered their first league defeat of the season. Leipzig came from behind to seal a 2-1 win over Hertha, whose Colombian striker Jhon Cordoba scored in the eighth minute. Leipzig drew level when defender Dayot Upamecano fired home from a free-kick on 11 minutes, but Berlin were reduced to 10 men after the break when substitute Deyovaisio Zeefuik was shown two yellow cards within four minutes of coming on. Leipzig made the man advantage count when Marcel Sabitzer converted a penalty with 13 minutes left. Hertha were lucky not to finish with nine men when another sub, Jessic Ngankam, scythed down Leipzig left-back Angelino and the referee changed his decision to a yellow card having initially showed a straight red. Borussia Moenchengladbach warmed up for Tuesday's Champions League game at home to Real Madrid with a 3-2 comeback win at Mainz. Germany midfielder Lars Stindl gave Gladbach an early lead, but the visitors were 2-1 down at half-time after French striker Jean-Philippe Mateta scored twice for Mainz. Gladbach midfielder Jonas Hofmann converted a penalty on 76 minutes, after a shot by replacement Marcus Thuram was blocked by a Mainz hand before Matthias Ginter headed the winner as Gladbach climbed to fifth. Union Berlin were held to a 1-1 draw at home to Freiburg as Vincenzo Grifo's first-half goal was cancelled out two minutes later by Union midfielder Robert Andrich."
7,08/02/2020,19:25,Klinsmann's Hertha slump as Quaison hits hat-trick for Mainz,Sweden striker Robin Quaison hit a hat-trick as Mainz beat 10-man Hertha Berlin 3-1 in the capital on Saturday to push Jurgen Klinsmann's side towards the Bundesliga relegation spots.,"Hertha have just one win in their five games in all competitions in 2020 under ex-Germany and USA head coach Klinsmann, who took charge last November. Klinsmann, 55, blamed the defeat on Hertha's midweek German Cup loss at Schalke, which was marred by alleged racist abuse aimed at Hertha defender Jordan Torunarigha by home fans. ""For us, this is disappointing, but it is understandable - it has been a very intensive week,"" said Klinsmann. ""After ten minutes, I saw that the boys' heads were down. It's all been a bit much in the last few days. ""That's not an excuse. The boys will take two days off and we meet again on Tuesday."" Hertha splashed out 80 million euros ($87.5 million) in the January transfer window on new recruits including strikers Krzysztof Piatek from AC Milan and Matheus Cunha from RB Leipzig. However, Quaison ran riot at Berlin's Olympic Stadium with goals either side of half-time before claiming a hat-trick by converting a late penalty. At the other end, Piatek and his Hertha strike partner Pascal Koepke struggled to create goal chances. Hertha's only consolation was an own goal by Mainz defender Jeffrey Bruma just before Berlin midfielder Marius Wolf was sent off for a second yellow card soon before the final whistle. Having also been drubbed 4-0 by leaders Bayern Munich in January, Hertha are now 14th in the table, two places from the relegation spots. In Gelsenkirchen, Schalke's title aspirations suffered a dent in a 1-1 draw at home to bottom side Paderborn. With league leaders Bayern Munich hosting second-placed RB Leipzig in Sunday's showdown, fifth-placed Schalke are now seven points from top spot. Schalke's arch rivals Borussia Dortmund can climb to second, and draw level with Bayern on 42 points, if they win later at Bayer Leverkusen. Schalke took a second-half lead when youth academy product Ahmed Kutucu, 19, came on as a substitute and fired home from a tight angle. But Paderborn took a point when midfielder Klaus Gjasula equalised with a late header. Werder Bremen are now deep in the relegation places after a 2-0 home defeat to mid-table Union Berlin. Second-half goals by Union winger Marius Buelter did the damage, combined with Mainz's win at Hertha Berlin, to leave Bremen 17th and four points from safety. Bremen's 37-year-old head coach Florian Kohfeldt is under pressure after seven defeats in 10 games. His cause was not helped as Fortuna Duesseldorf picked up a point to move above Bremen by drawing 1-1 at ten-man Wolfsburg. Duesseldorf took an early lead when winger Mathias Zimmermann fired into the bottom corner. Wolfsburg had defender Marin Pongracic sent off just after the break for elbowing Alfredo Morales at a free-kick. Despite being a man down, Wolfsburg drew level three minutes later as midfielder Renato Steffen headed home. Mid-table Freiburg rebounded from back-to-back defeats with a 1-0 win over Hoffenheim, thanks to a first-half penalty by striker Luca Waldschmidt at the Schwarzwald Stadion"
8,16/03/2019,17:29,Kovac urges Bayern to take Liverpool loss out on Mainz,Bayern Munich's under-fire coach Niko Kovac is urging his side to take their Champions League frustrations out on Sunday's opponents Mainz to stay ahead in the Bundesliga title race.,"Bayern are smarting from Wednesday's Champions League exit when Jurgen Klopp's Liverpool earned a 3-1 win at the Allianz Arena to dump the Bavarians out of the last-16 with an aggregate defeat by the same margin. It is the first time in seven seasons that Bayern have failed to make the quarter-finals in Europe. Their priority now is winning a seventh consecutive league title and the German Cup, with a home quarter-final against second-division Heidenheim on April 3. ""We want to win the two remaining competitions,"" said Kovac, who expects Bayern to ""turn the disappointment into many wins"" starting with Mainz at home. Kovac has come in for criticism from the German media since the Liverpool defeat, partly fuelled by striker Robert Lewandowski and defender Mats Hummels complaining that Bayern played too defensively. ""There was nothing negative, if Lewy felt that way, it's okay, it was nothing against me,"" said Kovac. ""The approach was the same as against Gladbach and Wolfsburg, when we scored 11 goals (in 5-1 and 6-0 victories). ""The stats showed we had more possession (against Liverpool), but we couldn't do the right thing with it, because the opponent was better overall."" Bayern started the weekend top of the Bundesliga on goal difference from second-placed Dortmund, who are at Hertha Berlin on Saturday night. Kovac's side have eroded Dortmund's lead to nothing by winning 12 of their last 13 league games. ""At one point we were 10 points behind, we have caught up with them and we can't afford to give anymore points away,"" said Kovac, who expects Mainz to try and catch them cold. ""They know we have gone out (of the Champions League), but we have to break their resistance, no matter how."" Kovac is waiting on the fitness of Javi Martinez, who was injured in a training ground collision with Hummels on Friday. With nine league games left to secure another Bundesliga title, Bayern captain Manuel Neuer has warned his side not to let standards slip, after losing two of their last three games last season following a semi-final defeat to Real Madrid in the Champions League. ""We have to try not to fall in a hole, as happened last year after the semi-final,"" said Neuer, who was at fault for Liverpool's first goal on Wednesday."
9,09/03/2019,20:39,'Perfect day' as Bayern return to Bundesliga summit with Liverpool looming,"Bayern Munich warmed up for Liverpool with a ""perfect day"" by knocking Borussia Dortmund from the top of the Bundesliga for the first time since September with a 6-0 thrashing of Wolfsburg on Saturday.","Bayern, who host Liverpool on Wednesday in their Champions League, last 16, return leg clash after a goalless draw at Anfield, went top on goal difference from Dortmund, who needed late goals to win 3-1 at home to Stuttgart. ""I'm very pleased. We want to be just as focused on Wednesday,"" said Bayern head coach Niko Kovac. Bayern ran riot in Munich as Robert Lewandowski scored twice, leaving him with 20 goals in 17 league games against Wolfsburg, while Serge Gnabry, James Rodriguez and Joshua Kimmich also netted. ""We are now where we want to be -- first in the table and that's where we want to stay,"" added Kovac with nine rounds of league games left. Having been told on Tuesday, along with Bayern team-mates Jerome Boateng and Mats Hummels, that his Germany career is over, Mueller took out his frustration, setting up the first goal and scoring Munich's second. ""The three wanted to give a response and they all played well -- it was a perfect afternoon,"" said goal-scorer Kimmich. Gnabry gave Bayern the lead on 34 minutes at the Allianz Arena by tapping home Mueller's cross, then turned provider three minutes later when he served up a simple tap in for Lewandowski to make it 2-0. Rodriguez, thriving in the attacking midfield role, got on the scoresheet when his superb 52nd-minute shot hit the top corner. Having set up the first goal, Mueller showed Germany head coach Joachim Loew what he is missing by wrong-footing Wolfsburg goalkeeper Koen Casteels to score with his heel on 76 minutes. Kimmich scored with a header on 82 minutes and Lewandowski claimed his second by guiding his header into the far corner three minutes later. Lewandowski, the top-scoring foreigner in Bundesliga history with 197 goals, has now scored in each of his last seven games against Wolfsburg, who he single-handedly battered in 2015 with five goals in just nine minutes. In Dortmund, late goals by Paco Alcacer and Chelsea-bound Christian Pulisic saw off dogged Stuttgart, but Borussia are now second after 23 weeks on top. ""I don't care about who is top now,"" said Dortmund captain Marco Reus. ""It only matters who is top at the end and everything is still open."" The win, only Dortmund's second in their last nine games, was vital to stay level on 57 points with Bayern. Despite some dogged Stuttgart defending, Dortmund took the lead at Signal Iduna Park when Reus netted a penalty on 62 minutes. The lead lasted just nine minutes as Stuttgart's Marc-Oliver Kempf headed home unmarked. However, Alcacer calmed nerves when the Spanish striker stabbed home on 84 minutes after a goal-mouth scramble. The third goal came when Axel Witsel beat three defenders, played Mario Goetze into the box to set up Pulisic, who netted in stoppage time. ""They parked a gigantic bus (in front of goal) -- it was hard to find the holes,"" complained Dortmund coach Lucien Favre. ""We tried everything and managed it, we ran a lot and defended a lot, but all in all, the win was deserved."" Third-placed RB Leipzig were held to a goalless draw at home by Augsburg, who beat Dortmund last Friday and went down fighting against Bayern last month. Mid-table Hertha Berlin crashed to a 2-1 defeat at Freiburg after the visitors captain Vedad Ibisevic cancelled out a Nils Petersen goal, but then scored an own-goal by turning the ball into the Berlin net. Later, Borussia Moenchengladbach bounced back from last weekend's 5-1 thumping at home to Bayern with a 1-0 win at mid-table Mainz, thanks to a second-half goal from defender Nico Elvedi. Gladbach stay fourth, level on 47 points with Leipzig, and both clubs lag nine points behind new leaders Bayern and Dortmund."
10,16/02/2019,18:12,Ten-man Schalke draw blank ahead of Man City clash,Schalke 04 warmed-up for the Champions League visit of Manchester City with a goalless draw at home to fellow Bundesliga strugglers Freiburg on Saturday.,"Schalke are winless in their last three Bundesliga games and sit just above the relegation places in 14th spot. Next up is a huge challenge at home to Pep Guardiola's Premier League giants Man City in their Champions League last 16, first-leg tie on Wednesday. In Saturday's bad-tempered clash, both Schalke and Freiburg finished with ten men. The Royal Blues played for nearly 50 minutes without defensive midfielder Suat Serdar, sent off for a first-half foul, while Freiburg defender Christian Guenter was dismissed late on for a second yellow card. Schalke came close to conceding a penalty with 10 minutes left when Spanish midfielder Omar Mascarell was suspected of a handball, but the video assistant referee (VAR) over-ruled the referee's initial decision. Welsh teenage winger Rabbi Matondo, who Schalke signed last month from Man City, struggled to make an impact on only his second Bundesliga appearance, his first over 90 minutes. The 18-year-old had a good chance with 16 minutes left but ballooned his shot over the bar. Freiburg hit the Schalke woodwork twice in the second half through substitutes Jerome Gondorf and Luca Waldschmidt. League leaders Borussia Dortmund are at bottom side Nuremberg on Monday. They are two points ahead of Bayern Munich, who won 3-2 at Augsburg on Friday. RB Leipzig took their chance to stay in the title race as a 3-1 win at Stuttgart left them fourth, just a point behind Borussia Moenchengladbach, who play Sunday at Eintracht Frankfurt. Yussuf Poulsen netted two goals as Leipzig took the three points. The Denmark striker opened the scoring after just six minutes when Leipzig's Germany striker Timo Werner fired in a cross, which clipped a defender's knee for Poulsen to tap home. Steven Zuber equalised from the spot for Stuttgart ten minutes later when the video assistant referee spotted the ball had hit Willi Orban's arm after a Mario Gomez header. However, Leipzig rallied as midfielder Marcel Sabitzer curled home a superb free-kick with 20 minutes left, then Poulsen claimed his second goal soon after, tapping home following an impressive run by US international Tyler Adams. Wolfsburg climbed to fifth with a 3-0 win at Mainz with goals by midfielder Maximilian Arnold, striker Wout Weghorst and defender Robin Knoche. Hoffenheim also moved up after Algeria forward Ishak Belfodil, Brazilian striker Joelinton and Germany midfielder Kerem Demirbay netted in their 3-0 win at second-from-bottom Hanover 96 to go seventh."
11,03/03/2018,21:16,Three-star Reus targets World Cup after Dortmnd leveller,Marco Reus underlined his brilliant return from a serious knee injury by scoring in his third straight Bundesliga game on Saturday as Borussia Dortmund drew 1-1 at RB Leipzig.,"After eight months sidelined having torn his cruciate knee ligament in last May's German Cup final, Germany winger Reus now has three goals in four games. Having missed Germany's 2014 World Cup victory with torn ankle ligaments and Euro 2016 with a groin injury, the fleet-footed Reus is even more determined to help defend the global title at Russia 2018. ""I'd be lying if I said that I didn't think about the World Cup and really want to be there,"" he told Bundesliga.com before kick-off. ""I won't make a secret of the fact it's a big goal of mine to be there. I know I've got a good chance, if I'm playing well."" Reus was a constant threat on Saturday and involved in the build up when striker Michy Batshuayi tapped home on 16 minutes, but Andre Schuerrle, who supplied the final pass, was offside. Leipzig took the lead when Liverpool-bound Naby Keita, back after a thigh injury, played a pass through Dortmund's defence which Jean-Kevin Augustin tucked away on 29 minutes. Having also had an earlier goal flagged for offside, Reus made no mistake at the second attempt, sprinting onto Batshuayi's well-timed pass and equalised seven minutes from half time. With an hour gone, Batshuayi, on loan from Chelsea, bungled the chance to grab the winner with the goal at his mercy. Leipzig, who picked up a point after three defeats, stay sixth. Dortmund coach Peter Stoeger is unbeaten in his ten league games in charge. ""I am happy with the 90 minutes, we are in the group fighting for Champions League places, it'll stay that way until the end of the season, and our goal is to qualify,"" said the Austrian. The result leaves Dortmund third after Schalke had earlier snatched second spot with a 1-0 home win against Hertha Berlin. Marko Pjaca, on loan from Juventus, claimed his second goal in five league games when Daniel Caligiuri whipped in a cross and Franco di Santo let the ball roll to Pjaca, who scored on 37 minutes. Schalke are 17 points behind runaway leaders Bayern, who play mid-table Freiburg on Sunday. Reports Bayern approached Freiburg boss Christian Streich last month to replace Jupp Heynckes as head coach next season have added extra spice to the game. Eintracht Frankfurt are fourth after their 1-0 win at home to mid-table Hanover as defender Danny da Costa scored their winner. Argentina striker Lucas Alario converted a first-half penalty and Julian Brandt scored with a superb chip as Bayer Leverkusen consolidated fifth place with a 2-1 win at ten-man Wolfsburg. Admir Mehmedi scored the consolation effort for Wolfsburg against his former club. The hosts finished with ten men when Brazilian left-back William was sent off for a second yellow card in added time. It finished goalless, but there was plenty of drama in Hamburg's basement battle at home to Mainz. Hamburg winger Filip Kostic hit the woodwork and had a goal ruled off side in the first half. Mainz had Nigeria defender Leon Balogun sent off for a second yellow card when he fouled Luca Waldschmidt in the area on 61 minutes. The referee pointed to the spot, but Kostic's weak attempt was saved by goalkeeper Florian Mueller on his Bundesliga debut. Hamburg are now seven points behind 16th-placed Mainz and on course for a first relegation in the club's history. ""Giving up is not in my nature, but we need a small miracle,"" admitted Hamburg coach Bernd Hollerbach. Having been booed by his own fans last weekend, the pressure eased on Hoffenheim coach Julian Nagelsmann with a 2-0 win at Augsburg.

That left Hamburg, second from bottom, seven points behind 16th-placed Mainz and looking doomed to suffer a first relegation from the top-fight in the club's history. ""Giving up is not in my nature, but we need a small miracle,"" admitted Hollerbach. ""I am incredibly sorry for the team, and the fans, that we did not get a reward for our effort. ""I saw that we lacked cold-nose finishing in the end, but we had that penalty and nerves certainly played a factor. ""I have to lift the team up again, I can't do any more today -- I have to sleep on it."" There was plenty of drama in Saturday's Bundesliga basement battle as Hamburg picked up only their third point in their last ten league games. They played the last half an hour against ten men, but still could not break the deadlock. Hamburg winger Filip Kostic hit the crossbar, then had the ball in the net in the first half, but the video assistant referee (VAR) ruled the goal offside. Mainz had Nigeria defender Leon Balogun sent off for a second yellow card when he fouled Luca Waldschmidt in the area on 61 minutes. The referee pointed to the spot, but Kostic's weak attempt was saved by Mueller. Hamburg's director of sport Jens Todt was left fuming as they failed to convert any of their 18 chances -- compared to Mainz's five -- and held two thirds possession. ""It is really crazy that we didn't win the game despite gaining superiority, despite better chances and despite numerical superiority,"" said Todt. ""The disappointment is deep and huge -- we are a bit speechless. ""We have to let that sink in first. We are in a very bad situation, which has gotten worse again."" With nine games left, Hamburg face tough forthcoming fixtures against Bayern Munich next Saturday, then Hertha Berlin, Stuttgart and Schalke."
13,23/02/2018,02:10,Five things to look out for in the Bundesliga,"Bayern Munich coach Jupp Heynckes will be chasing a 38-year-old club record when his team host Hertha Berlin on Saturday, but will do so without the injured James Rodriguez.","Heynckes is looking to become the first Bayern coach to win 15 games in a row as his team look to consolidate a commanding 19-point lead at the top of the Bundesliga. Second-place Borussia Dortmund host Augsburg on Monday, with fans from both sides set to boycott the game. Elsewhere, Bruno Labbadia takes charge of Wolfsburg for the first time against Mainz on Friday, while RB Leipzig look set to host Cologne without star midfielder Naby Keita. Here are five things to look out for in this weekend's Bundesliga action: Jupp Heynckes has worked wonders since returning to Bayern Munich, and on Saturday he looks set to break an incredible club record. Heynckes, who has led Bayern to 23 victories in 24 games since October, could now become the first Bayern coach ever to win 15 games in a row. The 72-year-old watched his side romp to victory over Besiktas in midweek to pick up a 14th consecutive win, equalling a club record set under Pal Csernai back in 1980. Bayern are expected to be without James Rodriguez, who was forced to leave the pitch after 44 minutes against Besiktas with a calf problem. A diagnosis on Wednesday confirmed that the Colombian will be out of action for no more than a few days. More fan protests are expected this Monday when Borussia Dortmund take on Augsburg in the Bundesliga's second Monday night fixture. Last week's inaugural Monday game saw fierce protests from Eintracht Frankfurt fans, who blew whistles and held up banners in protest at the new scheduling. This Monday, both Dortmund and Augsburg fan groups are expected to continue protests. Around 300 Dortmund fan clubs have reportedly signed up to a boycott led by the influential fan group ""Suedtribuene Dortmund"". ""We accept every opinion and every protest, as long as it is carried out peacefully,"" said Dortmund CEO Hans-Joachim Watzke. RB Leipzig will be without star midfielder Naby Keita when they host Cologne on Sunday evening. The Guinean midfielder left the field after just an hour in Leipzig's defeat to Frankfurt on Monday, having pulled his hamstring. Captain Willi Orban is also a doubt after suffering a cut to his knee in a collision with Frankfurt's Sebastien Haller on Monday. Coach Ralph Hasenhuettl, though, claimed that the injuries were not a disaster for his team, as Leipzig look to muscle their way back into the top four this weekend. ""We have enough quality to replace both of them,"" insisted Hasenhuettl. Bruno Labbadia takes charge of Wolfsburg for the first time on Friday evening, as the Wolves travel to Mainz for a crucial bottom of the table clash. Labbadia took charge of the struggling Wolves after Martin Schmidt's sudden resignation earlier this week, and is now tasked with leading the club back to safety. ""We have to use every hour available to us,"" said Labbadia. ""I will demand of my players that they invest everything into this fight."" Relegation threatened Hamburg find themselves in last chance saloon ahead of Saturday's visit to arch rivals Werder Bremen. Hamburg have not won in 10 games, and are now six points from safety as they prepare for a must-win game over fellow strugglers Bremen. ""The derby is coming just at the right time,"" said Hamburg's Aaron Hunt. ""It is a great chance for us to turn things around.""

14,05/02/2018,12:11,Five things we learned from the Bundesliga weekend,"Michy Batshuayi made a blistering start to life at Borussia Dortmund on Friday, firing the team back into the top four with two goals on his debut.","The Belgian wasn't the only debutant to make an impact, as 20-year-old English forward Ademola Lookman grabbed a late winner in his first game for RB Leipzig. The goal saw Leipzig move up to third in the Bundesliga, drawing level on points with second-place Bayer Leverkusen. Both Leverkusen and Leipzig are now 18 points behind leaders Bayern Munich, whose victory over Mainz on Saturday was overshadowed by speculation over coach Jupp Heynckes' future. Here are five things we learned from this weekend's Bundesliga action. Who needs Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang when you have Michy Batshuayi? Just three days after joining Dortmund on a six-month loan deal, Batshuayi enjoyed an explosive debut, grabbing two goals and an assist to inspire his new team to a 3-2 victory in Cologne. ""The way the game went for him today was like a dream,"" said coach Peter Stoeger of his new striker. Batshuayi, meanwhile, is already dreaming of big goals for his six-month sojourn in Westphalia. ""I want to get into the Champions League with Dortmund,"" he said. ""I want to win every single game."" Bayern Munich's dominance of the Bundesliga continued at the weekend, but there was more attention paid to Jupp Heynckes' future. The 72-year-old's contract runs until June, and he has repeatedly refused to talk about extending it. ""I can imagine that readers, viewers and listeners are bored of this topic,"" he said on Friday. Since coming out of retirement to take over at Bayern in the autumn, Heynckes has led the team to 14 victories in 15 Bundesliga games, so it is little wonder that the club would like him to stay beyond the end of the season. ""If I stood naked in front of him, I might have a small chance of persuading him to stay,"" joked club president Uli Hoeness earlier in the week. Everton loanee Ademola Lookman grabbed the headlines on Saturday, scoring 12 minutes into his RB Leipzig debut to secure a late victory over Borussia Moenchengladbach. The 20-year-old Englishman might, however, want to invest in a pair of new boots. ""He was lucky that I didn't take him off again straight away,"" admitted Leipzig coach Ralph Hasenhuettl. ""He was just sliding around in the boots he was wearing. They were the only pair he had brought with him from England, and he didn't want to take them off."" Both goalkeepers were left blushing in Gelsenkirchen as Werder Bremen snatched a late 2-1 win over Schalke. Bremen 'keeper Jiri Pavlenka allowed Yevhen Konoplyanka's shot to slip through his fingers in the first half. His error was overshadowed by the woes of opposite number Ralf Faehrmann, however -- he first fumbled a free-kick to gift Bremen an equaliser, before being nutmegged by Zlatko Junuzovic's late winner. ""Ralf said sorry in the dressing room, and I told him he had nothing to apologise for,"" said Schalke coach Domenico Tedesco. Michael Gregoritsch will have enjoyed watching the Super Bowl on Sunday, having secured three points for Augsburg just hours earlier. The Austrian scored Augsburg's second in a 3-0 win over Eintracht Frankfurt, and celebrated by miming a quarterback's throw. ""I will definitely be watching the Super Bowl later,"" admitted Gregoritsch after the game. ""My four best friends are coming over; I never sleep after a game anyway."""
15,03/02/2018,18:24,Ribery among scorers as Bayern march on in Bundesliga,Franck Ribery netted a rare Bundesliga goal as Bayern Munich eased to an eighth consecutive league victory with a 2-0 win over Mainz on Saturday.,"After a sluggish first half-hour, the veteran Frenchman put Bayern ahead on 33 minutes. Picking up a poorly cleared corner at the edge of the box, he released a fizzing half-volley to score only his second league goal of the season. James Rodriguez then doubled the lead just before half-time, elegantly bringing the ball down on his chest before volleying it past Robin Zentner. ""We were exhausted at the end,"" Bayern centre-back Mats Hummels told Sky Sport. ""Mainz passed the ball well, but we deserved to win."" The win saw Bayern extend their lead at the top of the table to 18 points after second-placed Bayer Leverkusen were held to a 0-0 draw in Freiburg. Lucas Alario hit the post for Leverkusen early in the game, but there were more yellow cards than chances, as seven players were booked and Freiburg once again frustrated a top team. ""It was a heated game,"" Leverkusen's Julian Brandt told Sky. ""We knew in advance that it wouldn't be easy to come to Freiburg."" Leverkusen, though, remain in second after Schalke once again dropped points. Both teams profited from goalkeeping errors in Gelsenkirchen, as a late goal saw Werder Bremen snatch a surprise 2-1 victory. A catastrophic mistake from Jiri Pavlenka gifted Schalke the lead on 24 minutes. Yevhen Konoplyanka's speculative effort flew straight at the Bremen goalkeeper, who allowed the ball to slip through his fingers. ""These things happen, it just looks stupid because he is the last man,"" said striker Max Kruse in Pavlenka's defence. ""We all made mistakes on the pitch today."" With 11 minutes to go there was more farcical goalkeeping as Ralf Faehrmann allowed Kruse to equalise for Bremen. After Matija Nastasic was sent off for a second bookable offence, Faehrmann fumbled the resulting free-kick, allowing the ball to bounce out of his hands and into the path of Kruse. It would get worse for Schalke in stoppage time, as Zlatko Junuzovic stabbed a loose ball past Faehrmann to claim a dramatic and invaluable victory for relegation-threatened Bremen. Elsewhere in the lower half of the table, Mario Gomez scored against his former club to rescue a point for VfB Stuttgart, as they welcomed new coach Tayfun Korkut with a 1-1 draw in Wolfsburg. Liverpool loanee Divock Origi put Wolfsburg in front on 24 minutes, curling a long-range shot into the bottom corner. Gomez, who left Wolfsburg for Stuttgart in January, levelled the scores on the hour mark, prodding the ball home from close range. In Saturday's other game, Hoffenheim extended their winless run to five matches after throwing away a 1-0 lead to draw at Hertha Berlin. Andrej Kramaric gave Hoffenheim the lead from the penalty spot on 39 minutes, but Salomon Kalou's header drew the home side level just before the hour mark. On Friday, Michy Batshuayi scored twice on his debut for Borussia Dortmund after joining on loan from Chelsea as his new club won 3-2 at bottom side Cologne."
16,28/01/2018,19:11,Bailey strikes again as Leverkusen go second,Winger Leon Bailey showed why Arsenal and Chelsea are reportedly tracking him with another stunning goal in Bayern Leverkusen's 2-0 win over Mainz on Sunday in the Bundesliga.,"Bailey, 20, gave Leverkusen the lead at the BayArena when he hit the back of the net from 20 metres with a left-footed strike. There was nothing on when Bailey looked up outside the area, but his shot across goal gave Mainz goalkeeper Robin Zentner no chance three minutes into the second half. After also scoring last weekend with an audacious backheel, it was his eighth league goal this season. ""It's crazy how well the boy is playing from week to week,"" said Leverkusen's director of sport Rudi Voeller shaking his head. Leverkusen could ask Chelsea or Arsenal for double the 13.5 million euros ($17.8 million) they paid Belgian club Genk for Bailey in January 2017. However, the player ruled out leaving in January's transfer window and the Jamaican is under contract until June 2022. ""That was a nice goal,"" Bailey said mischievously after his superb strike. ""I can promise I'll stay here for the rest of the season. ""I feel very comfortable in Leverkusen and the chemistry in the team is good. ""We have a great team that can do a lot this season."" It was the latest eye-catching display from Bailey who scored and made a goal in last weekend's 4-1 thrashing of Hoffenheim. ""He was the can opener for us today - the impetus came from Leon,"" said Leverkusen's Germany winger Julian Brandt. Leverkusen made sure of the three points against strugglers Mainz when Brazilian left-back Wendell converted a 68th-minute penalty, after Mainz defender Giulio Donati brought down striker Lucas Alario. The win sees Leverkusen climb to second, 16 points behind runaway league leaders Bayern Munich, who thrashed Hoffenheim 5-2 at home on Saturday. The Bundesliga's top-scorer Robert Lewandowski scored for the 18th time in the league this season as Bayern fought back from two goals down in style. VfB Stuttgart sacked coach Hannes Wolf on Sunday, after Saturday's 2-0 defeat by third-placed Schalke saw them slip to 15th in the table. Leverkusen are above Schalke on goal difference, with Eintracht Frankfurt a point behind in fourth. Borussia Dortmund are sixth after needing a 93rd-minute equaliser by left-back Jeremy Toljan to salvage a 2-2 draw with Freiburg. Arsenal target Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang produced a poor display and was whistled on his return after being dropped for the previous two games. Dortmund were whistled by their own fans and Stoeger admitted he was also unimpressed with what he saw. ""I didn't whistle, but I wasn't happy,"" he quipped."
17,13/01/2018,18:07,No happy Bundesliga return for De Jong,"World Cup finalist Nigel de Jong made an unhappy return to the Bundesliga on Saturday, conceding a first-half penalty as Mainz threw away the lead in a 3-2 defeat at Hanover.","Former Dutch international midfielder De Jong, who played in the 2010 World Cup final defeat by Spain and won the 2012 Premier League title with Manchester City, had an afternoon to forget in Hanover. The 33-year-old defensive midfielder, who made 66 Bundesliga appearances for Hamburg between 2006 and 2009, has signed for Bundesliga strugglers Mainz until the end of the season. It all started so well for Mainz as a goal by Japan striker Yoshinori Muto and Alexander Hack's header put them 2-0 ahead with half an hour gone. But after Hanover striker Niclas Fuellkrug made it 2-1 with a header towards the end of the first half, De Jong brought down midfielder Felix Klaus in the area and the referee pointed to the spot. To De Jong's dismay, Fuellkrug netted the resulting penalty on 38 minutes before banging home the winning goal 15 minutes from time to complete his hat-trick. The defeat leaves Mainz 15th in the table, just a point above the bottom three, while Hanover climb to 10th. There was a happier return for Germany striker Mario Gomez, back at Stuttgart after an eight-year gap, as he helped seal a 1-0 win at home to Hertha Berlin. With time running out, former Bayern forward Gomez was brought down in the area by Hertha's Niklas Stark. While the German international was busy appealing for a penalty, the ball looped off Stark's boot and into the net for the winning own goal on 78 minutes much to Gomez's delight. The result leaves Stuttgart 12th, one place below Hertha, who hit the post through Austria international Valentino Lazaro in the first half. Elsewhere, Augsburg climbed to seventh with a 1-0 win over strugglers Hamburg thanks to a winning header by South Korea international Koo Ja-Cheol just before the half-time whistle. Eintracht Frankfurt blew the chance to jump from ninth to third after French striker Sebastien Haller gave them a lead at home to Freiburg, who equalised through a header by defender Robin Koch in the second half in a 1-1 draw. Werder Bremen and Hoffenheim also shared a point in their 1-1 draw as Czech international Theodor Gebre Selassie's second-half goal for hosts Bremen cancelled out Benjamin Huebner's first-half header. Bundesliga leaders Bayern Munich went 14 points clear on Friday, when the German league resumed after the winter break, with a 3-1 win at Bayer Leverkusen. Second-placed Schalke have the chance to cut the gap when they play RB Leipzig away later on Saturday."
18,16/09/2017,20:30,Lewandowski scores twice in Bayern romp,Robert Lewandowski netted twice on his 100th Bundesliga appearance for Bayern Munich who brushed off their internal strife with a 4-0 hammering of Mainz on Saturday.,"""We played really well and controlled the game from the first minute,"" said Lewandowski. ""Everything worked out like we had planned it. When we're so flexible on the pitch, it makes it hard for any opponent to stop us."" Lewandowski has now netted 82 goals for Munich amidst reports he wants to join Real Madrid next season, but Bayern chairman Uli Hoeness laughed off the claim by Spanish newspaper AS. ""It's not April 1,"" quipped Bayern boss to broadcaster Sport1. The rout left Bayern second in Germany's top flight, a point behind Hanover 96, who claimed the lead after four games with a 2-0 win over Hamburg on Friday. This was a much improved performance from Bayern compared to last Saturday's 2-0 defeat at Hoffenheim and Tuesday's lacklustre 3-0 win at home to 10-man Anderlecht in the Champions League. ""I'm happy. We had good combinations and created good chances. We did well,"" said Bayern coach Carlo Ancelotti. Arjen Robben had slammed Bayern's performance against the Belgians, while Lewandowski had added to the unrest by criticising the club's spending policy. That came after Thomas Mueller had complained about being benched for the 2-0 win at Werder Bremen. However, all three scored against Mainz at Munich's Allianz Arena on Saturday. Mueller opened the scoring after just 11 minutes when he drilled home Robben's pass on Bayern's first attack. The flying Dutch winger added a second on 23 minutes when Joshua Kimmich's pass put him in behind the defence and he drilled his shot home. Lewandowski then doubled the damage with two superb goals. Kimmich released Mueller on the right wing, who put in a superb cross for the Poland striker to convert on 50 minutes. Lewandowski grabbed his second and Bayern's fourth goal when he headed across Mainz's former Germany goalkeeper Rene Adler. Franck Ribery started on Bayern's bench having thrown his shirt away in disgust after being substituted late against Anderlecht. Borussia Dortmund can go top of the table on Sunday if they beat Cologne at home on Sunday. Liverpool-bound Naby Keita was sent off as fifth-placed RB Leipzig twice threw away the lead in their 2-2 draw with Borussia Moenchengladbach. Germany striker Timo Werner scored his fifth goal for Leipzig this season early on before Thorgan Hazard netted a penalty for Gladbach. French forward Jean-Kevin Augustin restored Leipzig's lead when his quick turn put him clear of the defence to fire home, but Lars Stindl equalised. Keita, who will play for Liverpool next season, was sent off on 84 minutes for kicking Christoph Kramer in the face, which left the Germany midfielder with a cut on his face. Germany midfielder Leon Goretzka scored the second-half winner as Schalke went third with a 2-1 win at Werder Bremen. The hosts took an early lead as Lamine Sane slammed home off his left foot on 20 minutes, but Bremen's former Tottenham Hotspur defender Milos Veljkovic then netted an own goal. Goretzka's winning goal left Schalke third in the table with three wins from four games. The defeat was extra bitter for Bremen who will be without Germany striker Max Kruse for the next eight weeks after he went off early with a broken leg. VfB Stuttgart captain Christian Genter had to be stretchered off following a nasty collision with Wolfsburg goalkeeper Koen Casteels late in his team's 1-0 home victory after Chadrac Akolo scored the winner. Casteels's knee caught Gentner in the face and Stuttgart's team doctor reacted quickly on the pitch after the midfielder, whose face was covered in blood, had swallowed his tongue. Brazil midfielder Caiuby scored what proved to be a superb winner with a long-range strike in Augsburg's 2-1 win at Eintracht Frankfurt which moved his team up to sixth."
19,31/05/2017,17:34,Schwarz takes over as Mainz head coach,"Bundesliga club Mainz on Wednesday confirmed former player Sandro Schwarz as their new coach, promoting him from his job in charge of their reserve team.","The 38-year-old was in charge of the club's under-23 team, which has just been relegated from Germany's third division. Schwarz made 100 appearances as a midfielder for Mainz between 1998 and 2002. He replaces Martin Schmidt, who was sacked last week, despite having a year left on his contract, after Mainz finished 15th in the Bundesliga -- only avoiding relegation on goal difference. ""I'm really up for this,"" Schwarz said in his first press conference as head coach. ""I am looking forward to working with the team, bringing on the players and developing a style of football which will be successful and please the fans. ""That's the main part of my job. ""Personally, it's a very emotional step to be able to coach my Bundesliga team in my town."" Mainz have a history of putting inexperienced coaches in charge of their first team. Thomas Tuchel, who has just left Borussia Dortmund, made his breakthrough at Mainz, and twice steered them to the Europa League in his five seasons in charge from 2009-14. Before Tuchel, Jurgen Klopp, a former Mainz player like Schwarz, spent seven years as coach before joining Dortmund in 2008, then Liverpool in 2015. ""I played under 'Kloppo' as a player, which helped shape me,"" said Schwarz. ""He was a big part of developing the game here of defending from the front. ""When I was the under-19 coach here, I had some experience with Tuchel and I took a lot out of it."""
20,29/05/2017,21:32,Mainz to name Schwarz as new coach,"Mainz 05 are set to name their former player Sandro Schwarz as head coach on Wednesday, according to reports in the German media.","Several media outlets claim Schwarz, 38, will be promoted from coaching Mainz's Under-23 team, which has just been relegated from Germany's third division. Schwarz, who made 100 appearances as a midfielder for Mainz between 1998 and 2002, is set to be named in a press conference scheduled for Wednesday as the replacement for Martin Schmidt. The Swiss was sacked last week, despite having a year left on his contract, after Mainz finished 15th in the Bundesliga -- only avoiding relegation on goal difference. Mainz have a history of putting inexperienced coaches in charge of their first team. Thomas Tuchel, currently Borussia Dortmund's head coach, made his breakthrough at Mainz, and twice steered them to the Europa League in his five seasons in charge from 2009-14. Before Tuchel, Jurgen Klopp, a former Mainz player, spent seven years as coach before joining Dortmund in 2008."
21,07/05/2017,18:03,"Hamburg, Mainz draw in relegation scrap",Relegation-threatened Hamburg and Mainz both boosted their Bundesliga survival chances by earning a point apiece in Sunday's goalless draw.,"Mainz had the best chances to take the three points in Hamburg as Spanish midfielder Jairo Samperio came off the bench and twice went close late on. The result leaves both clubs on 34 points, with Hamburg in the relegation play-off place due to their inferior goal difference. However the two sides moved four points clear of second-bottom Ingolstadt with just two games left to play. Hamburg are fighting to preserve their status as the Bundesliga's only ever-present club, having flirted with relegation from Germany's top tier in recent seasons. They remain in 16th place, which would lead to a two-legged play-off at the end of the season against the team that finishes third in the second division in order to stay in the Bundesliga. Bottom side Darmstadt were relegated on Saturday following their 1-0 defeat at Bayern Munich with Mainz, Hamburg and Ingolstadt battling to avoid joining them in the second tier next season. Ingolstadt are four points adrift of safety and must effectively win their final two games -- at Freiburg and home to Schalke -- while hoping Hamburg and Mainz drop points in order to stay up. Mainz host Eintracht Frankfurt and then visit Cologne in their run-in, while Hamburg travel to Schalke before taking on Wolfsburg at home in the final round of matches."
22,02/04/2017,17:54,Ingolstadt down Mainz to revive survival bid,Ingolstadt breathed life into their Bundesliga survival fight on Sunday as goals by defenders Roman Bregerie and Florent Hadergjonaj sealed a crucial 2-1 home win against Mainz.,"It was Ingolstadt's first victory since mid-February to end a five-match winless streak and comes before next week's crucial matches against their relegation rivals. Ingolstadt are second from bottom in Germany's top flight, seven points adrift of Augsburg in 16th place -- which leads to a two-legged play-off to stay up. The timing of Ingolstadt's victory is perfect ahead of Wednesday's crunch match at Augsburg and Saturday's home tie against bottom side Darmstadt. French centre-back Bregerie gave Ingolstadt an early lead with a header after 10 minutes from a corner. Mainz equalised when midfielder Levin Oztunali drilled home a long-range free-kick on 70 minutes, but the scores were level for just three minutes. Swiss winger Hadergjonaj delivered a swift response for Ingolstadt when his intended cross flew over Mainz goalkeeper Jonas Loessl and into the net. ""I am an honest bloke and I just wanted to put in a good cross as I saw one of our players in the middle,"" Hadergjonaj told Sky, after netting his first Bundesliga goal. ""The ball just kept on flying and the fact it was the winning goal just makes it even better. ""We haven't had much luck in the last few weeks, so it was nice that it was on our side for a change."" The defeat dragged Mainz into the relegation battle, leaving them 14th and only clear of the bottom three on goal difference having lost eight out of their last nine away games. At the other end of the table, runaway leaders Bayern Munich remained 13 points clear after their 6-0 thrashing of Augsburg as striker Robert Lewandowski hit his third Bundesliga hat-trick this season. Lewandowski, last season's Bundesliga top scorer, has 24 league goals this campaign, just like Aubameyang, who scored for Borussia Dortmund in their 1-1 draw at Schalke in the Ruhr Valley derby. The Poland international has now scored 36 goals in all competitions for Bayern this season. Lewandowski also proved he can provide goals by setting up Thomas Mueller for Bayern's second, his backheel then let Thiago Alcantara stab home their fourth. Second-placed RB Leipzig bounced back from back-to-back defeats with a 4-0 romp against lowly Darmstadt, who had midfielder Sandro Sirigu sent off. Guinea midfielder Naby Keita, who collapsed after last month's shock 1-0 defeat to Wolfsburg, marked his return with two goals while playmaker Emil Forsberg and captain Willi Orban also scored."
23,29/01/2017,20:02,Shaky Dortmund leak late equaliser,Borussia Dortmund conceded a late goal in Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang's low-key Bundesliga return on Sunday in a 1-1 draw at Mainz which cost them third place in the table.,"Aubameyang, the German league's top scorer with 16 goals, was back in Dortmund's starting line-up following Gabon's group-stage exit from the Africa Cup of Nations, but he had just two shots on goal in Mainz. Dortmund coach Thomas Tuchel had lamented their shaky defence after last Saturday's scrappy 2-1 win at Werder Bremen and they again looked unstable at the back. This was Dortmund's fourth draw in their last five league games. ""If you don't want to defend consistently, then something like that can happen,"" said Dortmund's frustrated captain Marcel Schmelzer. ""We thought we were a step further on, so it is bitter to have let a win slip out of our hands."" Last season's runners up are now fourth -- fourteen points adrift of leaders Bayern Munich, who won 2-1 at Werder Bremen on Saturday thanks to goals by Arjen Robben and David Alaba. Borussia took the lead with just three minutes gone in Mainz. Midfielder Jean-Philippe Gbamin lost possession, which Dortmund's Germany winger Andre Schuerrle snapped up to provide the final pass for Marco Reus to rifle home. Mainz's Japan striker Yoshinori Muto had the ball in the net on 15 minutes, but the goal was ruled offside. The hosts snatched a point seven minutes from time when midfielder Danny Latza was left unmarked to head home a cross at the far post as Mainz pushed for the winner in the frantic final stages. Earlier, midfielder Janik Haberer and ex-Bayern Munich striker Nils Petersen netted for Freiburg in Sunday's shock 2-1 win over Bundesliga high-fliers Hertha Berlin. ""It's unpleasant to play against us,"" said Petersen. ""We defended well and we have the quality up front to use our few chances. ""We're all pulling in the right direction -- big compliment to the team."" Having pushed league leaders Bayern all the way in last weekend's 2-1 home defeat at the Schwarzwald Stadion, hosts Freiburg earned a deserved win on Sunday to climb to eighth in Germany's top flight. Haberer, who had given Freiburg a shock lead against Bayern before Robert Lewandowski netted twice, put the hosts ahead against Hertha when he drilled home Vincenzo Grifo's pass across goal on 39 minutes. Freiburg sealed the win when super sub Petersen netted his sixth goal of the season, all of which have come as a replacement, on 87 minutes when he finished off a move started by his own goalkeeper and beat three defenders. Less than a minute later, Hertha pulled a goal back when ex-Dortmund striker Julian Schieber rifled home. The defeat, Hertha's sixth of the season, leaves Pal Dardai's Berlin sixth in the table. ""We played okay for an away game, but we had no clear chances, just mistakes in their defence,"" said Dardai, whose team has now suffered two straight defeats after their 3-1 loss at Leverkusen. ""We have to improve that."" On Saturday, second-placed RB Leipzig ended 10-man Hoffenheim's unbeaten run this season with a 2-1 comeback win to stay just three points adrift of Carlo Ancelotti's star-studded Bavarians. Hoffenheim were the last undefeated team left in Europe's top leagues before Marcel Sabitzer's 77th-minute winner dealt the visitors their first loss of the campaign after striker Sandro Wagner's dismissal. Meanwhile, Werder confirmed Sunday that a fan died of natural causes in their Weser Stadion ground immediately after Saturday's defeat to Bayern Munich. The man, from East Frisia in north-east Germany, had received emergency treatment for upper body pains and nausea shortly before the final whistle. After an investigation by police, death by natural causes was confirmed. ""The news has very much affected us all,"" said Werder's president Hubertus Hess-Grunewald."

Bayern beat second division Fortuna Duesseldorf in the semi-final 4-1 on penalties with keeper Manuel Neuer saving two spot kicks. ""We have to maintain this rhythm for next week's restart at Freiburg,"" said Ribery. In the Bundesliga, Bayern are leading by three points from promoted RB Leipzig. In the Champions League, they face Arsenal in the last 16."
25,11/12/2016,17:47,Controversy as Gladbach break winless streak,Borussia Moenchengladbach claimed their first Bundesliga win for 11 weeks on Sunday to relieve the pressure on coach Andre Schubert with a controversial 1-0 win at home to 10-man Mainz.,"Danish defender Andreas Christensen netted 'Gladbach's crucial winning goal on 76 minutes when the ball flew his way after captain Lars Stindl's shot cannoned off a Mainz defender and the centre-back stabbed home. Mainz have every reason to feel aggrieved as striker Pablo De Blasis poked his shot into the Gladbach goal on 89 minutes after the ball rolled free of Borussia's goalkeeper Yann Sommer following a save. De Blasis was already off celebrating, but referee Robert Hartmann refused to give the goal, even though replays showed Sommer did not have a glove on the ball when De Blasis kicked it. ""The ball was in my hand, but it all happened very quickly. It was a very difficult decision to make,"" Sommer told Sky after the final whistle. To add insult to injury, Hartmann sent off Mainz midfielder Jean-Philippe Gbamin for a second yellow card on 90 minutes. The result lifts Gladbach up to 12th, a point below Mainz and six from the relegation places, to give them a first Bundesliga win since September 24. After their 4-0 thrashing at Barcelona in mid-week in the Champions League, Gladbach's sports director Max Eberl said their three Bundesliga games against Mainz, Augsburg and Wolfsburg matter more than the Barca defeat. But this was another poor performance from Gladbach, whose defence looked shaky, especially in the controversial scene around the disallowed goal."
26,27/11/2016,20:06,Two-goal Ibisevic sent off as Hertha go third,Vedad Ibisevic scored both goals before being sent off in Hertha Berlin's 2-1 comeback win over Mainz to lift his side to third in the Bundesliga on Sunday.,"Both teams finished with ten men for the final quarter of an hour as Ibisevic was sent off for receiving his second yellow card. His dismissal came after Mainz's defensive midfielder Jean-Philippe Gbamin was also sent for an early shower, also for a second booking. ""We stayed calm despite conceding the early goal, got ourselves level and then created the winner, so we deserved the win,"" said Hertha coach Pal Dardai. Aaron Seydel had given Mainz the lead after 25 minutes at Berlin's Olympic Stadium, but Hertha responded when Salomon Kalou spotted Ibisevic unmarked and the Bosnia forward fired home Berlin's equaliser on 36 minutes. Gbamin was sent off on 62 minutes and his dismissal changed the course of the game. Kalou and Ibisevic combined again for Hertha's second. Ivory Coast international Kalou headed back across goal on 67 minutes for his forward partner Ibisevic to fire home before he was sent off seven minutes later. Hertha climb to third behind leaders RB Leipzig and second-placed Bayern Munich. Earlier, Schalke 04 continued their rise as striker Eric Choupo-Moting atoned for a penalty miss by netting in their 3-1 comeback win against Darmstadt. Having been bottom of the table after losing their first five games -- the worst start to a season in the club's history -- the result left Schalke eighth and unbeaten in their last 11 games in all competitions. ""It's the first time we have turned things around after going behind and we haven't lost for a while now,"" Choupo-Moting told Sky. Markus Weinzierl's side will face a stern test of their renewed form when they visit Bundesliga leaders Leipzig, who won 4-1 at Freiburg on Friday to stay three points clear of Bayern, next weekend. Cameroon's Choupo-Moting showed his class by redeeming himself for a missed first-half penalty. After setting up Schalke's equaliser in the opening period, the 27-year-old made it 2-1 midway through the second half before Alessandro Schoepf grabbed their third on 90 minutes. Darmstadt took the lead at Schalke's Veltins Arena when midfielder Marcel Heller poached the opening goal with just six minutes gone. But Schalke roared back with the equaliser when Darmstadt lost the ball on the edge of their own area and Choupo-Moting fired in a cross which Bosnia defender Sead Kolasinac headed home from close range on 26 minutes. The hosts should have doubled their tally barely a minute later when Germany international Leon Goretzka was fouled in the area, but Choupo-Moting failed with his penalty attempt. He fired his spot-kick at the feet of the diving Darmstadt goalkeeper Michael Esser and the ball rebounded to safety. ""I thought he'd dive to the side, so I hit the ball down the middle, but it didn't work the way I wanted it to,"" Choupo-Moting explained. ""That sort of thing does stay on your mind, but it helps if you score afterwards."" The Cameroon forward then showed lightning reactions to slip his marker when attacking midfielder Max Meyer fired in a cross and Choupo-Moting tapped his shot past Esser on 60 minutes. It was his third league goal of the season and he could have added another when he fired wide of the post with 14 minutes left. Austria's Schoepf added Schalke's third with some good finishing after a chip over the Darmstadt defence from Ukraine international Yevhen Konoplyanka just before the final whistle."
27,06/11/2016,18:07,Leipzig equal record to draw level with Bayern,Bundesliga new boys RB Leipzig drew level on 24 points with Bayern Munich at the top of the table on Sunday with a record-equalling 3-1 win over Mainz.,"Leipzig have now matched Bayern's run of seven wins and three draws from their first ten German league games. They equal the record for a team in their first Bundesliga season, set by MSV Duisburg, who also went ten games unbeaten in the 1993/94 campaign. Timo Werner and Emil Forsberg scored all three Leipzig goals and it threatened to turn into a rout as the hosts wasted four clear chances with the scoreline flattering Mainz, who drop to tenth. After Bayern were held to a 1-1 draw at Munich's Allianz Arena on Saturday, Leipzig seized their chance to match the Bavarian giants' points tally, but stay second on goal difference. Leipzig, who were only founded in 2009, earned their place in Germany's top flight this season with four promotions in seven years. Their pre-Christmas showdown with Bayern at the Allianz Arena on Tuesday December 20 is building to be a top-of-the-table clash. But Leipzig are keeping their feet firmly on the ground, repeatedly rejecting the tag of 'Bayern's Hunters', which the German media is eager to bestow upon them. ""This is a dream, but we won't blow things up to say we're hunting Bayern,"" insisted 20-year-old Werner after his two goals. A falsely triggered fire alarm delayed kick-off by three minutes at Leipzig's Red Bull Arena, but the 43,000 spectators barely had time to find their seats when Werner gave Leipzig the lead. Left winger Forsberg had his shot blocked, but Werner tapped home the rebound for his fourth goal of the season with three minutes gone. Werner returned the favour by out sprinting Mainz's Nigerian defender Leon Balogun and steered the ball into Forsberg's path for the Sweden international to double their lead on 21 minutes. A minute from the break, Forsberg also sprinted past Balogun before squaring for Werner, who fired home off his left foot to make it 3-0 at the break. Mainz coach Martin Schmidt brought on defender Stefan Bell for winger Jairo Samperio for the second half, but Forsberg and Werner both had second-half chances and could have added four more goals. Werner went off to loud applause, making way for Scotland winger Oliver Burke for the final 20 minutes. Mainz pulled a goal back 16 minutes from time when Bell out jumped his marker from a corner and placed his header into the far corner."
28,16/10/2016,17:38,Mainz down Darmstadt in Rheinland derby,Mainz moved up to seventh in the German league table on Sunday with a 2-1 win at home to local rivals Darmstadt in the Bundesliga.,"Just 48 kilometres (30 miles) separates the two clubs in Germany's top flight and while Mainz are knocking on the door of the top six, the result leaves Darmstadt 15th in the table, just above the relegation places. Argentinian striker Pablo De Blasis gave Mainz the lead at the Opel Arena with a brilliant flick after just five minutes to claim his fourth goal in seven league games this season. Darmstadt were awarded a penalty just before the break when Mainz captain Stefan Ball fouled striker Antonio-Mirko Colak, but the Croatian forward had his spot-kicked saved by Mainz's Danish goalkeeper Jonas Loessl. It was a busy first-half as both sides hit the crossbar. Mainz doubled their lead when Turkey international Yunus Malli was brought down by Darmstadt captain Aytac Sulu, but got up to bang home the spot kick on 57 minutes. Darmstadt scored a late consolation goal when Mainz substitute Niko Bungert, who came on in the 90th minute, gave away a penalty for handball which midfielder Jerome Gondorf gratefully converted in the 93rd minute. Bayern Munich remain two points clear top of the Bundesliga table despite their 2-2 draw at Eintracht Frankfurt on Saturday, which left the defending champions winless in their last three matches. On Sunday night, unbeaten RB Leipzig have the chance to claim another big scalp in their debut season in the Bundesliga when they are away to Wolfsburg. Having already beaten Borussia Dortmund and Hamburg, a win could see Leipzig claim second place in the table on goal difference from Cologne, who won 2-1 at Ingolstadt on Saturday."
29,27/08/2016,18:08,Aubameyang nets twice as Dortmund win opener,Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang has resumed his duel with Robert Lewandowski to be the Bundesliga's top scorer by netting twice in Borussia Dortmund's 2-1 win over Mainz on the opening weekend of the new season.,"Aubameyang scored 25 German league goals last season, finishing second to Bayern Munich striker Lewandowski's 30 in the scorers' charts, and the duo look set to lead the way again in 2016/17. Lewandowski scored a hat-trick in Bayern's 6-0 rout of Werder Bremen on Friday and his Dortmund rival Aubameyang opened his account less than 24 hours later. The Gabon star headed in a 17th-minute opener and then added a late penalty before Japan striker Yoshinori Muto pulled one back at the death for the visitors. Dortmund coach Thomas Tuchel was without Marco Reus, who was watching on in the stands as he recovers from a groin injury, but he started with three summer signings in his line-up. He gave Bundesliga debuts to Spanish centre-back Marc Bartra, signed from Barcelona, and 19-year-old French winger Ousmane Dembele, brought in from Rennes, while ex-Bayern midfielder Sebastian Rode also started. Aubameyang was unmarked at the far post to head in the opener from a cross from the left by Germany winger Andre Schuerrle. He then doubled his tally on 89 minutes when Schuerrle was brought down in the area and the Gabon star converted the resulting penalty, before Muto set up a nervous ending with a header in the 92nd minute. ""As far as I know my team, I can only think that they wanted to show everything they can do, which made things a bit nervous and not too tidy in our structure and the way we found space,"" said Tuchel. ""Things were a bit tough, so it was a very laborious victory."" Bayern's rout of Bremen is cause for concern in Germany with German Football League (DFL) president Reinhard Rauball admitting the opening fixture of the season on Friday will have done little to sell the Bundesliga overseas. ""Bayern played some very good football, but I was shocked by how little resistance Werder Bremen offered,"" Rauball told German radio. ""No one can argue that the match was on a knife-edge, but I hope the millions of viewers were pleased with the goals and can take that as some compensation."" Elsewhere, VfL Wolfsburg also got off to a winning start on Saturday with a 2-0 victory at Augsburg. Star off-season signing, Germany striker Mario Gomez -- the Bundesliga's top scorer over the last decade -- was not included in the starting line-up as he regains his fitness after injury at Euro 2016. But his new team-mates picked up three points without him. Wolves took the lead when Dutch striker Bas Dost fired across the face of goal and new signing Daniel Didavi lashed home a shot from the edge of the area on 35 minutes. Swiss international left-back Ricardo Rodriguez then drove in a low free-kick on 89 minutes. Cologne enjoyed a 2-0 win at Darmstadt as Marcel Risse and Anthony Modeste both netted for the hosts. Hamburg were held to a 1-1 draw at home to Ingolstadt as US international Bobby Wood's fine opening goal for the hosts was cancelled out by a late finish from Austria international Lukas Hinterseer. Schalke 04 opened their season with a 1-0 defeat at 10-man Eintracht Frankfurt as captain Alex Meier scored the first-half winner. There was plenty of second-half drama as Meier had a penalty saved before the hosts were reduced to 10 men when their Jamaica international centre-back Michael Hector was sent off for hauling down Schalke's Klaas-Jan Huntelaar, who was through on goal. Later Borussia Moenchengladbach beat Bayer Leverkusen 2-1 at home in a battle of two of Germany's Champions League representatives. Andre Hahn scored for Gladbach just before the half-time whistle, only for Finland's Joel Pohjanpalo to equalise on his debut on 79 minutes, before Lars Stindl hit the winner five minutes from time."
30,07/08/2016,18:42,Liverpool crash on Klopp's Mainz return,Jurgen Klopp's Liverpool suffered a comprehensive 4-0 defeat at Mainz on Sunday in a friendly which exposed some defensive frailties seven days before facing Arsenal in their Premier League opener.,"Having hammered Barcelona 4-0 at Wembley on Saturday, also in a friendly, the Reds were brought crashing back down to earth as guests of honour in the opening of Mainz's new Opel Arena. Klopp, who spent most of his playing career in Mainz, made nine changes from the side which beat Barcelona, but his experimental team was run ragged. Daniel Brosinski's penalty put Mainz in front and Jhon Cordoba, Yunus Malli and Japan striker Yoshinori Muto also netted. ""You could see we were tired from the game against Barcelona,"" said Klopp. ""I'm not annoyed, but we didn't defend well -- we made too many mistakes."" Defender Andre Wisdom's early handball saw Liverpool fall behind when Brosinski converted a 15th-minute penalty. Poor defending by Joel Matip let Colombia forward Cordoba fire home from a tight angle to make it 2-0 to the hosts at the break. There was more bad news for Liverpool as Marko Grujic, who scored against Barcelona with a superb header, limped off with an ankle injury in the first half. Klopp made four changes at the break, but things went from bad to worse for the visitors. Mainz's goal-scoring midfielder Malli pounced on a loose ball in the middle, strode forward and blasted his shot past Liverpool goalkeeper Alex Manninger on 59 minutes before Muto made it 4-0 on 75 minutes. It was an unhappy return to Mainz for Klopp, who played for the German club for 11 years, then took over as coach in 2001, steering them to the Bundesliga before taking charge of Borussia Dortmund in 2008, before joining Liverpool last year. It was a different performance from Liverpool compared to their rout of Barca when Sadio Mane, who cost 34 million pounds ($44.5 million, 40.1 million euros) from Southampton, scored a goal and created another at a sun-soaked Wembley. Elsewhere in Germany, there was better news for Chelsea boss Antonio Conte as the Blues enjoyed a 4-2 friendly win away to Werder Bremen as Eden Hazard, Oscar, Diego Costa and Pedro Rodriguez all netted for the Premier League side."

In January, the Senegal international signed on loan from Chelsea until the end of the season. He could now be banned for their next league game at Borussia Dortmund on April 2 with Bremen battling to avoid relegation. In November 2009, St Pauli forward Deniz Naki made a similar gesture to Hansa Rostock fans during a German league match and received a three-match ban by the DFB. Werder coach Viktor Skripnik says Djilobodji has ""a temper"" and expects there to be consequences for his gesture, adding: ""I'll accept whatever comes"". Bremen's director of sport Thomas Eichin says he will speak to the player. ""I'll have a serious talk to him about it and he won't do it again in the future,"" Eichin told Sky. In the same match, Werder's veteran striker Claudio Pizarro, 37, equalled the club's goal-scoring record after netting for the 101st time in the Bremen shirt, converting a penalty after Julian Baumgartlinger had given Mainz a first-half lead. Pizarro's contract expires at the end of the season, but the Peru hot-shot is set to be offered a contract extension by the man whose record he equalled. ""He's also an important person to have in the dressing room and I would be happy if he'd play another year with us, I think the prospects are good,"" said Werder's chairman Marcus Bode, who had set the record of 101 Werder Bremen goals."

33,13/03/2016,20:20,Fan's death overshadows Dortmund's win,Goal-scorer Marco Reus admitted Borussia Dortmund's 2-0 Bundesliga win over Mainz on Sunday was overshadowed by the death of an 80-year-old fan in the stadium.,"The elderly Dortmund fan collapsed with a suspected heart attack in the south-west stand of Borussia's 81,000 sold-out Signal Iduna Park. A second fan also collapsed, but was revived on the way to hospital. Reus scored on 30 minutes, but it meant the second-half was played in a subdued atmosphere as the news circulated. Japan midfielder Shinji Kagawa netted Dortmund's second on 73 minutes in almost complete silence. ""On the pitch, we had no idea what was going on and were initially irritated by the silence,"" said Reus. ""Straight after the game, our coach (Thomas Tuchel) came to us and explained what had happened. ""It obviously put a shadow over the game and complement to the fans for the way they behaved."" Once the news sank in after the final whistle, the Dortmund team gathered as the home fans sang an emotional rendition of the club's anthem ""You'll Never Walk Alone"". ""I have never experienced something like that where the supporters were united in expressing their grief and respect,"" German FA interim president Reinhard Rauball told Sky. ""I also take my hat off to Mainz for the way they gave their support."" Dortmund's victory leaves them second, five points behind Bayern Munich. Earlier, ten-man Bayer Leverkusen had an own-goal to thank for ending their four-match winless streak in the Bundesliga in a 1-0 victory over Hamburg. Hamburg's Sweden midfielder Albin Ekdal slid the ball into his own net after 18 minutes at the BayArena to hand Leverkusen victory. Leverkusen had Croatia right-back Tin Jedvaj sent off in the dying stages after being shown two yellow cards in quick succession for time wasting, then mocking referee Christian Dingert. On Saturday, Thomas Mueller and Thiago Alcantara netted twice as leaders Bayern warmed up for Wednesday's Champions League last 16 clash at home to Juventus with a 5-0 win over Werder Bremen. With second-placed Borussia Dortmund playing Mainz on Sunday, Pep Guardiola's team took the chance to reopen an eight-point gap at the top. It took Bayern just nine minutes to take the lead at Munich's Allianz Arena as Thiago scored his first league goal since February 2014. Robert Lewandowski, the league's top scorer with 24 goals, came off the bench to claim Bayern's fourth as Bremen were routed. Wolfsburg suffered a Champions League hangover with a 1-0 defeat at relegation-threatened Hoffenheim. Wolfsburg reached the last eight in Europe for the first time in the club's history as Tuesday's 1-0 win at home to Gent sealed a 4-2 win on aggregate in the last 16. But Dieter Hecking's side were stunned by second-from-bottom Hoffenheim as Andrej Kramaric, on loan from Leicester City, scored after just three minutes. It could have been more as Kevin Volland had a second-half penalty saved. The defeat leaves Wolfsburg four points outside the top six while Hoffenheim remain three points from safety. Hoffenheim's win pushed bottom side Hanover 96 closer to relegation as they suffered a 2-0 defeat at home to Cologne with Leonardo Bittencourt scoring both goals. Eintracht Frankfurt's new coach Niko Kovac suffered a 3-0 defeat on his Bundesliga debut at Borussia Moenchengladbach to stay in the relegation places. Gladbach's Lars Stindl, Raffael and Mahmoud Dahoud scored the goals as Gladbach climbed to fourth. A foul on South Korea midfielder Koo Ja-Cheol in the dying stages of Augsburg's 2-2 draw at Darmstadt led to his side converting a penalty to take a crucial point. Augsburg are deep in the relegation battle as one of three teams on 27 points and just above the relegation places. Australia striker Mathew Leckie scored only his second goal of the season as he headed home from close range in mid-table Ingolstadt's 3-3 draw at home to Stuttgart. On Friday, Hertha Berlin cemented third place in the table with a 2-0 win over nearest rivals Schalke thanks to goals from Niklas Stark and Vedad Ibisevic."
34,06/03/2016,17:45,Ten-man Mainz stay on course for Champions League,"Ten-man Mainz failed to back up their mid-week shock win at Bundesliga leaders Bayern Munich, but stay on course for a Champions League place, after drawing 0-0 with Darmstadt on Sunday.","Having become the only team to win at Bayern's Allianz Arena stadium on Wednesday by pulling off a stunning 2-1 win in Munich, fifth-placed Mainz were frustrated by Darmstadt, who are just above the relegation places. Hosts Mainz were reduced to ten men at the Coface Arena when Italian defender Giulio Donati was shown a straight red card on 57 minutes for kicking out at Darmstadt striker Sandro Wagner. The result leaves Mainz just one point from one of Germany's four Champions League places, with Martin Schmidt's team having one of the best seasons in the club's history. On Saturday, Bayern stayed five points clear of nearest Bundesliga rivals Borussia Dortmund after a goalless draw between Germany's top two sides. Despite the lack of goals, the game lived up to its billing as the clash of the teams which have dominated the German league this season at Dortmund's sold-out Signal Iduna Park. The game's best chance came on 64 minutes when Arturo Vidal's shot for Bayern was palmed onto the bar by Dortmund goalkeeper Roman Buerki. Bayer Leverkusen came back from 3-0 down to avoid a fourth straight league defeat in a 3-3 draw at Augsburg. Augsburg's South Korea striker Koo Ja-Cheol scored his first hat-trick in Germany's top flight to put the hosts 3-0 up mid-way through the second-half. But Leverkusen, who play Villarreal in the last 16, first-leg, of the Europa League on Thursday, fought back as Karim Bellarabi netted, then Augsburg's Paul Verhaegh scored an own goal on 80 minutes. In the dying stages, Augsburg defender Jeffrey Gouweleeuw's handball allowed Hakan Calhanoglu to convert a 92nd-minute penalty as Gouweleeuw was sent off. Earlier on Saturday, Wolfsburg warmed up for their Champions League clash at home to Gent on Tuesday with a 2-1 win over Borussia Moenchengladach. The win moved Wolfsburg up to seventh ahead of the visit of Gent on Tuesday, with the Germans leading 3-2 from the last 16, first leg tie. Having shocked Leverkusen 4-1 on Wednesday when Claudio Pizarro scored a hat-trick, Werder Bremen pulled further away from the relegation zone with a 4-1 thrashing of bottom side Hanover 96. The 37-year-old Pizarro claimed his fourth goal in two games, and then provided an assist as Czech international Gebre Selassie added Bremen's third on 56 minutes to leave Werder three points from the relegation spots. Stuttgart are up to mid-table after their 5-1 thrashing of second-from-bottom Hoffenheim, who stay four points from safety, as defender Georg Niedermeier netted twice. Schalke are fourth after their 3-1 win at Cologne thanks to goals from Klaas-Jan Huntelaar, Max Meyer and Argentina striker Franco di Santo."
35,01/03/2016,15:49,Guardiola dismisses Dortmund talk before Mainz,"Bayern Munich could move closer to an historic fourth straight German league title if they win at nearest-rivals Borussia Dortmund in four days, but Pep Guardiola says, for now, it's all about Mainz on Wednesday.","Bayern hold an eight point lead in the table and victory at Dortmund on Saturday would be a significant step becoming the first team to win four straight German league titles. Bayern won 2-0 at Champions League side Wolfsburg last Saturday and now a mouth-watering showdown beckons in Dortmund. Before that however Guardiola insists he is focused on playing resurgent Mainz at Munich's Allianz Arena. ""Everyone is talking about Wolfsburg and Borussia Dortmund, but we are playing against Mainz, who are fifth in the table. ""They are a strong and dynamic team."" The Martin Schmidt-coached Mainz proved just how strong they are in beating Bayer Leverkusen 3-1 at home on Sunday with goal-scoring midfielder Yunus Malli netting twice to leave them fifth and challenging for a Champions League place next season. But Bayern want to secure the league title as soon as possible to allow them to focus on Europe. They set the Bundesliga record for the earliest title win two years ago by wrapping things up with seven games left at the end of March 2014, holding a 22-point gap over second-placed Dortmund at the time. Two years on, Dortmund are making life much harder under coach Thomas Tuchel and Guardiola knows he can ill afford to be distracted by the Champions League or German Cup in his final few months in Munich before coaching Manchester City next season. Tuchel says it is obvious Bayern are eager to win at Dortmund to leave Borussia with only a mathematical chance of winning the title. ""It should be noted that Bayern want to decide things early,"" said Tuchel, ahead of their game on Wednesday's at Darmstadt, who are just above the relegation places. ""Perhaps it's the best outcome (for Bayern) if the eight point gap remains."" Injuries have robbed Guardiola of defenders with centre-backs Jerome Boateng, Javi Martinez and Holger Badstuber sidelined. But in attack, he has all his players fit and is struggling to find a place for Germany's World Cup winner Mario Goetze, who is back from injury. ""He still needs more time and I have seven forwards fit,"" said Guardiola. ""We still have three months left and we need all our players in order to reach our goals. ""Mario is very professional and is important for us."" After ex-Bayern president Uli Hoeness was released from prison after serving 21 months for tax evasion on Monday, Guardiola was tight-lipped on whether he has already spoken to him. ""That's private,"" Guardiola snapped. ""We are happy for him, for Susi (Hoeness' wife) and his family."""
36,26/02/2016,02:15,Wolfsburg aim to stop Lewandowski making more history,Wolfsburg are desperate to stop history repeating itself when they host Bundesliga leaders Bayern Munich on Saturday following Robert Lewandowski's historic five-gaul haul in the reverse fixture.,"The Poland striker came off the bench and sent Bundesliga records tumbling with his nine-minute blitz single-handedly propelling Bayern to a 5-1 thrashing of Wolfsburg at Munich's Allianz Arena last September. Injury and illness mean Wolfsburg have 12 players either ruled out or struggling to be fit to face Pep Guardiola's league leaders at the Volkswagen Arena. Bayern are eight points clear of second-placed Borussia Dortmund -- and a massive 28 ahead of eighth-placed Wolfsburg. Between them Lewandowski and fellow Bayern forward Thomas Mueller have scored a combined tally of 39 Bundesliga goals -- more than the entire Wolfsburg team. Wolfsburg's ex-Bayern defender Dante says the only way to stop Lewandowski is to cut off his supply. ""If we defend as a team and the ball doesn't come to him, then he can't really do anything,"" said the Brazilian. ""We have to really get things going and be up for the game. ""We have to go into each one-on-one with real passion and every pass must hit the target."" Four days after their 2-2 draw at Juventus in the Champions League, Guardiola is set to rotate his Bayern squad, especially with defenders Holger Badstuber, Jerome Boateng and Javi Martinez all sidelined. Winger Franck Ribery could start his first Bundesliga game for a year, while Wolfsburg coach Dieter Hecking could be down to his third-choice goalkeeper with Diego Benaglio injured and Koen Casteels recovering from flu. On Sunday evening, Dortmund host rejuvented strugglers Hoffenheim. Thomas Tuchel's side is a force to be reckoned with and are unbeaten this season at their Signal Iduna Park stadium having picked up 28 points from a possible 30 at home. Second-from-bottom Hoffenheim earned fresh hope in the relegation battle when they claimed a 3-2 win over Mainz last weekend under their 28-year-old coach Julian Nagelsmann. Dortmund will be without Greek centre-back Sokratis, who is sidelined for three weeks with a groin injury, and Neven Subotic is set to take his place. Hertha Berlin are at Cologne on Friday night hoping to end their run of five league games without a win despite staying third in the table. Hertha coach Pal Dardai will be counting on Ivory Coast striker Salomon Kalou to add to his tally of eight goals scored away from home, the most on the road for any Bundesliga player. Bayer Leverkusen will not have coach Roger Schmidt on their bench for Sunday's match at Mainz. The 48-year-old is banned for three league games, and was fined 20,000 euros ($22,031), for refusing a referee's order to leave the touchline during last Sunday's 1-0 league defeat at home to Dortmund. Mainz are up to seventh in the table and are unbeaten in their last five home games, while Leverkusen's defeat to Dortmund broke their six-game unbeaten run.

With Hoffenheim second from bottom, Nagelsmann earned a point on his Bundesliga debut in last weekend's 1-1 draw at Werder Bremen. But he was delighted when his team sealed a comeback win at home to Mainz, even though Spanish midfielder Jairo's late goal for the guests meant a nervous last 12 minutes. ""In the closing stages, I felt like I looked at my wristwatch about 7,000 times, but it didn't go any faster,"" said a visibly-relieved Nagelsmann. The win left Hoffenheim just three points from safety, but facing tough games against Europa League sides Borussia Dortmund and Augsburg in the coming fortnight. ""It's a start and the table looks a little bit nicer,"" said Nagelsmann, whose playing career was ended by a knee injury at just 20. ""Nevertheless, we're still second from bottom and we want to get away from there fast. We need more games like that to collect the points we need."" Nagelsmann has breathed life back into his struggling side, who produced a good attacking display and fought back despite falling behind with just 11 minutes gone. Colombia striker Jhon Cordoba scored for Mainz, but the hosts roared back as Nadiem Amiri levelled, then winger Mark Uth netted twice. Jairo's 78th minute goal made it 3-2, but Hoffenheim held on and Nagelsmann was praised for putting emphasis on attack. ""Everyone here can identify one hundred percent with this style of playing -- it's a style which suits Hoffenheim,"" said Germany winger Kevin Volland, who had his best game for months. ""The coach has played an extremely large part in that. He has given us confidence and courage."""
38,22/01/2016,19:11,Dortmund on the prowl amidst Malli rumours,Coach Thomas Tuchel says Borussia Dortmund are poised for activity in the January transfer window with Mainz's goal-scoring midfielder Yunus Malli rumoured to be set to join the Bundesliga giants.,"Malli, a Turkey international, has scored eight goals in 17 games as a centre forward for Mainz, playing just behind Japan striker Yoshinori Muto, and is reported to be set to cost Dortmund around 11 million euros ($11.9m) from Tuchel's former club. Dortmund are second in the Bundesliga table, eight points adrift of leaders Bayern Munich, ahead of their first league game of 2016 at Borussia Moenchengladbach on Saturday evening, but Tuchel is looking to add to his squad. ""We are definitely looking, but we need patience and optimism,"" he said. ""The decisive factors are the depth in the squad, the competition and a certain class of player. I am an advocate of 17, 18 players, all of whom are at a high level."" Tuchel has a few injury concerns with left-back Marcel Schmelzer out with a leg injury, while midfielder Sven Bender has a foot injury and Nuri Sahin is struggling for fitness after injury. Schmelzer is only expected to feature in Sunday's friendly against second-division Berlin side FC Union. Tuchel admits his side's 4-0 home win over Borussia Monchengladbach last August will have little relevance given Gladbach's resurgence under new coach Andre Schubert. The Foals have lost just one of their 12 league games since Schubert took charge and they are now fourth, having been bottom prior to Schubert's appointment. ""Saturday's game is going to be nothing like the reverse fixture,"" Tuchel said. ""Gladbach have transformed since then, not only but also because of the change in coach. ""They are much more active, aggressive and run more under Schubert, so we expect them to be very courageous."" Only league leaders Bayern Munich have picked up more points than Gladbach in their last 12 matches. Bayern coach Pep Guardiola said in Thursday's press conference that Dortmund are among ""the top five teams in Europe"", something which makes Tuchel wary. ""Praise from Bayern is always a dangerous thing,"" said Tuchel, who said he is more concerned with holding on to second place in the league -- Dortmund are six points ahead of third-placed Hertha Berlin -- than chasing down Bayern. ""Besides, Bayern have a comfortable lead. We are not concerned with that at the moment."""
39,20/12/2015,17:33,Kalou strikes as high-flying Hertha stay third,Hertha Berlin finish 2015 third in the Bundesliga after Ivory Coast striker Salomon Kalou netted in Sunday's 2-0 home win over Mainz to continue their impressive run of results.,"The three points gives capital club Hertha their 10th win from 17 league games this season and leaves them behind only runaway leaders Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund in the Bundesliga table. Hertha took the lead at Berlin's Olympic Stadium when Vladimir Darida fired home off his left boot on 34 minutes. The hosts doubled their tally when a superb diagonal pass from Vedad Ibisevic put Kalou into space and the Ivory Coast striker held off his marker to fire home off his right on 54 minutes for his ninth goal of the season. Earlier in the day, Bayern confirmed Pep Guardiola will leave them at the end of the season, to be replaced by Carlo Ancelotti, as they finished the year with an eight-point lead in the table after their 1-0 win at Hanover on Saturday. Thomas Mueller converted a 40th minute penalty for his 14th league goal of the season after a handball from Hanover captain Christian Schulz as Bayern produced another jaded display, but still managed to claim their 15th win in 17 league games. The defeat left Hanover second from bottom with 11 defeats in their 17 games. Second-placed Borussia Dortmund dropped further behind after crashing to a 2-1 defeat at Cologne as the hosts scored twice in the final 10 minutes. Greece centre-back Sokratis Papastathopoulos headed Dortmund into an 18th minute lead which Thomas Tuchel's side threw away in the closing stages. Cologne took the three points when Simon Zoller fired home from close range on 83 minutes before Anthony Modeste hit the 90th-minute winner. Bayer Leverkusen climbed to fourth in the table with a 1-0 win at Ingolstadt as Mexico striker Javier Hernandez kept up his stunning scoring run. ""Chicharito"" claimed his 17th goal in Leverkusen's last 14 games in all competitions when he stabbed home his 11th league goal of the season since joining from Manchester United. Europa League side Augsburg picked up their third straight win to move away from the relegation places into mid-table with a 1-0 victory at Hamburg thanks to Jan Moravek's headed equaliser. Eintracht Frankfurt picked up their first win in eight matches to move out of the relegation zone when captain Alex Meier and Stefan Aigner scored in their 2-1 win at home to fellow strugglers Werder Bremen. Vfb Stuggart also climbed out of the drop zone on goal difference after a 3-1 home win over Vfl Wolfsburg in Saturday's late game which led to caretaker coach Jurgen Kramny getting the job permanently on Sunday. Schalke are up to fifth in the table thanks to Friday's 1-0 win against bottom-side Hoffenheim when Cameroon forward Eric Choupo-Moting was credited with a goal which deflected off Hoffenheim's Czech defender Pavel Kaderabek."
40,28/11/2015,17:54,Bayern extend Hertha's 38-year wait,Bayern Munich went 11 points clear at the top of the Bundesliga on Saturday with a 2-0 win at home to Hertha Berlin who have now gone 38 years without a win at the German giants.,"With second-placed Borussia Dortmund hosting VfB Stuttgart on Sunday, Bayern took the chance to extend their lead with first-half goals by Germany forward Thomas Mueller and France Under-21 winger Kingsley Coman. Bayern show no signs of loosening their iron-grip on the Bundesliga title as they picked up their 13th win from 14 league games to give them 40 from a possible 42 points. This was the first time in eight home games that Bayern failed to score at least four goals. Bayern coach Pep Guardiola experimented with the starting line-up by pushing Germany centre-back Jerome Boateng into a midfield role, which led to their second goal. They took the lead at Munich's Allianz Arena when Chile midfielder Arturo Vidal's cross found Medhi Benatia, whose shot was heading wide, but Mueller was on hand to head home on 34 minutes. Bayern doubled their lead on 41 minutes when Boateng lobbed the ball into Javi Martinez, whose pass found Coman and the French winger did the rest to make it 2-0 at the break. Hertha, who last won in Munich in 1977, are in fifth place after Borussia Moechengladbach leap-frogged them into fourth with a 3-3 draw at Hoffenheim. Gladbach's head coach Andre Schubert preserved his nine-game unbeaten record in the lead since taking charge two months ago. Borussia took an early lead thanks to USA international Fabian Johnson, who then scored their equaliser to rescue a point. Hoffenheim, chasing their first win since September, took a 3-1 lead just after the break thanks to goals by Steven Zuber, Eugen Polanski and Nadiem Amiri. But Swiss striker Josip Drmic pulled it back to 3-2 for Gladbach before Johnson claimed his second with a superb shot three minutes from time. Hamburg are up to sixth after their 3-1 win at Werder Bremen in the north German derby. Hamburg raced into an early 2-0 lead as Croatia midfielder Ivo Ilicevic scored on their opening attack, then striker Michael Gregoritsch doubled their lead on 26 minutes. Nigeria's Anthony Ujah pulled a goal back for Werder on 62 minutes, then Germany forward Nicolai Mueller made it 3-1 to Hamburg on 68 minutes when Ilicevic's final pass put him in behind the hosts' defence. Hanover eased the pressure on coach Michael Frontzeck with a 4-0 thumping at home to Ingolstadt which lifted them up to 14th and pulled them away from the relegation zone. Japan striker Yoshinori Muto scored his seventh goal of the season in Mainz's 2-1 win at Eintracht Frankfurt. His forward partner Yunus Malli added their second to claim his eighth while Frankfurt had captain Alex Meier sent off for a second yellow card."
41,21/11/2015,17:53,Wolfsburg warm-up for Moscow by hammering Bremen,Germany striker Max Kruse netted twice in Wolfsburg's 6-0 rout of Werder Bremen in the German league on Saturday to warm-up for Wednesday's key Champions League clash in Moscow.,"In Europe, Wolfsburg are third in Group B, but just a point behind leaders Manchester United ahead of their penultimate group game at bottom side CSKA Moscow in the Russian capital on Wednesday. The Germans still have every chance of qualifying for the knock-out stages and consolidated third in the German league table by hammering Bremen. There was a minute's silence at all Bundesliga grounds this weekend -- the players also wore black armbands -- out of respect for the victims of the Paris terror attacks. Stuttgart's 4-0 thumping at home to Augsburg was delayed by 15 minutes due to the tightened security checks at stadiums across the country. There were no such problems at Wolfsburg's Volkswagen Arena as Bremen gifted their hosts the opener when defender Alejandro Galvez slid the ball into his own net on 11 minutes. Kruse put Wolfsburg 2-0 up at the break by heading home a free-kick then Portugal international Vierinha scored from the right wing on 56 minutes. The floodgates opened when French defensive midfielder, on for the injured Brazil star Luiz Gustavo, stabbed home his shot on 67 minutes. Kruse then set up Netherlands striker Bas Dost on 78 minutes before completing the scoring three minutes from time by converting a cross from Germany team-mate Andre Schuerrle to leave him with five league goals for the season. The result leaves Wolfsburg five points behind second-placed Borussia Dortmund who lost 3-1 at Hamburg on Friday night, while leaders Bayern Munich play at Schalke on Saturday evening. Ex-Manchester United star Javier Hernandez now has 12 goals for Bayer Leverkusen in all competitions after scoring twice in their 3-1 win at Eintracht Frankfurt. Christmas came early for 'Chicharito' in Frankfurt when Eintracht centre-back David Abraham allowed a cross to roll between his legs and the grateful Hernandez stabbed home on 11 minutes. The Mexico striker doubled his tally on 39 minutes when a Hakan Calhanoglu pass split the Frankfurt defence. Hernandez did the rest, but it finished 2-1 at the break when Serbian midfielder Slobodan Medojevic slammed in a powerful header on the stroke of half-time. Calhanoglu made sure of the three points by scoring Leverkusen's third on 72 minutes. Augsburg climbed off the bottom of the table with an emphatic 4-0 win at VfB Stuttgart. Woeful defending by the hosts allowed Augsburg to race into an early 2-0 lead with both goals by midfielder Alexander Esswein. Defender Jan-Ingwer Callsen-Bracker grabbed a third before former South Korea captain Koo Ja-Cheol scored Augsburg's fourth when he hit the top right-hand corner from 10 metres out on 54 minutes. The Rhine derby finished goalless as Mainz drew at Cologne as the hosts abandoned plans to play in a special-edition carnival-themed shirt out of respect for those who died in Paris."
42,01/11/2015,13:02,Hat-trick hero Muto targets more Mainz goals,Japan striker Yoshinori Muto was disappointed his Mainz team drew at Augsburg despite his first Bundesliga hat-trick and he wants more goals next Saturday at high-flying Wolfsburg.,"The 23-year-old claimed his first treble in Germany's top flight when he netted all three goals on Saturday in Mainz's 3-3 draw at Bavarian side Augsburg. Muto now has six goals in 11 Bundesliga matches, to make him the club's joint top-scorer since he joined the club at the start of the season from J-League side FC Tokyo. He wants to add to his tally as Mainz bid to pick up their first win in five games at home to third-placed Wolfsburg, who play PSV Eindhoven away in the Champions League on Tuesday. ""I'm really delighted that I have scored three goals in one match, but unfortunately we didn't win the game,"" said Muto, who has made 17 appearances for Japan. ""I hope I score again in the next game and that we win it."" Muto, who chose Mainz over Premier League side Chelsea, gave his side a 2-0 lead at Augsburg before the hosts roared back with three unanswered goals. The Japan international saved his side's blushes with virtually the last kick of the game when he scrambled the ball over the line in the 93rd minute. The result kept Augsburg bottom of the table while Mainz are 13th. The point was a confidence booster after Mainz's shock German Cup exit when they lost 2-1 at home to second-division 1860 Munich on Tuesday."
43,31/10/2015,18:50,Japan's Muto scores first Bundesliga hat-trick,Japan striker Yoshinori Muto scored his first Bundesliga hat-trick on Saturday to rescue a dramatic point for mid-table Mainz in their 3-3 draw at bottom side Augsburg.,"The 23-year-old has now scored six goals in 11 Bundesliga games since signing for Mainz at the start of the season. Muto gave Mainz a 2-0 lead before Augsburg roared back with three unanswered goals, but the Japanese saved his side's blushes with virtually the last kick of the game. Muto, who chose Mainz over Premier League side Chelsea, opened the scoring when Pablo De Blasis picked him out on the edge of the six-yard area to fire home on 18 minutes. The ex-FC Tokyo star, who has made 17 appearances for Japan, made it 2-0 with another close-range finish on the half-hour mark, but Paul Verhaegh's penalty for Augsburg made it 2-1 at half-time. The hosts drew level when South Korea international Koo Ja-Cheol headed home on 50 minutes, then Raul Bobadilla put the hosts ahead with ten minutes left. But Muto bundled home his third with the last kick of the match to earn the visitors a share of the spoils and the result kept Augsburg bottom of the table with Mainz 13th."
44,01/09/2015,13:04,Augsburg return delights Korea's Koo,"South Korea's Koo Ja-Cheol says his move from Mainz back to Bundesliga rivals Augsburg ""feels like coming home"" after signing a two-year deal with the Europa League side.","The 26-year-old winger joined Mainz in January 2014, after spending the 2012/13 season on loan at Augsburg from Wolfsburg and has now returned to the Bavarian team. ""I've always felt comfortable at Augsburg and now have the feeling of coming home,"" said Koo, who passed the medical on Monday before the transfer window closed. ""It's great that it worked out at such short notice. ""Now I am looking forward to being back at the club and I want to help the team achieve their goals in the Bundesliga, cup and Europa League."" After signing his Augsburg contract on Tuesday, Koo, who captained Korea at the 2014 World Cup, flew off to link up with the squad for their Russia 2018 qualifiers at home to Laos on Thursday and away to Lebanon next Tuesday. His new club said they were delighted to have Koo back after the Korean scored eight goals in 36 league games for Augsburg. ""We were in regular contact with Koo Ja-Cheol after his departure and we took the chance to have him back as soon as it emerged,"" said Augsburg's director of sport Stefan Reuter. ""He knows the club, the environment as well as the team and coach, so he won't need much time to settle back in here. ""From a sporting perspective, he will help us in attack to get more width on our game."""
45,29/08/2015,14:58,Dortmund sign South Korea's Park from Mainz,Borussia Dortmund on Saturday confirmed the signing of South Korea international left-back Park Joo-ho from Bundesliga rivals Mainz for a reported 3.5 million euros ($3.9m) on a contract until 2018.,"""As a left-back, Park Joo-ho is the ideal addition to our squad,"" said Dortmund's director of sport Michael Zorc. The 28-year-old has made 26 appearances for Korea and was a late call-up to their 2014 World Cup squad. Park will rival Germany international Marcel Schmelzer for the left-back berth. He has played in the German league since joining Mainz in July 2013 from FC Basel, where he twice won the Swiss league title, and has played in 44 Bundesliga matches. Park leaves Mainz with the Rheinland club's blessing and they have already lined up Gaetan Bussmann from French side FC Metz as Park's replacement. ""The years together with Park Joo-ho will stay with us as very good memories,"" said Mainz's team manager Christian Heidel ""Park approached us with the expressed desire to switch to Borussia Dortmund and once we had reached an agreement with them, we didn't want to stand in his way."" Dortmund host Hertha Berlin on Sunday in the Bundesliga chasing their eighth straight win at the start of the season under new coach Thomas Tuchel and have qualified for the Europa League's group stages."
46,14/08/2015,18:15,Japan star Muto hoping not to trip up in Bundesliga,"Yoshinori Muto, the Bundesliga's latest Japanese import, is hoping to make his debut in Germany's top flight on Saturday -- even if the length of defenders' legs is something new.","The 22-year-old striker signed for Mainz from J-League side FC Tokyo in the off-season to replace Shinji Okazaki, after his compatriot joined Leicester City. With 23 goals in 51 J-league games, Muto arrives with a good pedigree, but admitted he has had a few problems adapting to defences in Germany and hopes to start against Ingolstadt on the opening weekend of the new season. ""During my first training session, I had the impression that the defenders' legs were longer than in Japan,"" he said, admitting he will need to bulk up to cope with Bundesliga defences. ""It was like they were coming from everywhere."" The Japanese is clearly in Germany to make an impression and gave his first press conference last week in a tailored suit and in near-perfect German. He came on for the last 20 minutes of Mainz's 3-0 win at Energie Cottbus in the first round of the German Cup last Sunday. ""I'm going to give everything for Mainz and although German is a tough language, I'm going to learn it,"" said the Japan international, who has made 13 appearances and scored one goal for his country, after making his debut last year. Muto has a tough act to follow in Okazaki, the highest-scoring Japanese player in Bundesliga history after 37 goals in 128 league games. However, the versatile forward is unlikely to slot into his predecessor's role as a genuine striker. ""I've played the last two seasons in Japan as a centre-forward, but although I haven't spoken to (Mainz coach) Martin Schmidt about the details yet, I think I'll be able to play wider here,"" he revealed. Mainz finished 11th in last season's Bundesliga and open their campaign against Ingolstadt, who have are making their debut in Germany's top flight."
47,26/06/2015,21:02,Japanese striker Okazaki joins Foxes,"Japan international Shinji Okazaki has agreed to join Leicester City from Mainz 04 on a four-year deal, the player told his new club's website.","The 29-year-old has yet to gain a work permit but if he does -- with 43 goals in 93 internationals for Japan it should be a formality -- he will become the Foxes' third summer signing after centre-half Robert Huth and left back Christian Fuchs. ""I am very happy to be here. To play in the Premier League is my dream and I will make every effort to help the team here at Leicester City,"" Okazaki told lcfc.com. ""I will do my best to show how I can play and try to make a lot of goals for the supporters. ""I watched every match (last season) in the Premier League not all of them are easy. There were hard games. ""In the last few games the crowd were great and the players responded. It was an amazing result at the end of the season."" Okazaki scored nine times for Mainz last season as they finished 11th."
48,26/06/2015,20:27,Mainz ready to sell Jara after Copa assault,Chilean defender Gonzalo Jara could be dumped by German club Mainz following the storm of controversy which followed his attempt to shove a finger into the backside of an opponent at the Copa America.,"Jara was the subject of widespread revulsion on social media after photos and camera footage clearly showed him jabbing a finger into the back of Uruguay striker Edinson Cavani's shorts during Wednesday's quarter-final, won 1-0 by Chile. The lurid provocation ultimately led to Cavani being sent off after the Paris St-Germain star flicked a retaliatory hand into Jara's face. Mainz boss Christian Heidel said the Bundesliga club was ready to sell the 29-year-old player. ""He knows it -- if we receive an offer, he can leave,"" Heidel told Bild newspaper. Jara joined Mainz from English side Nottingham Forest last year but featured in just 17 games during the season."
49,30/05/2015,16:41,Japanese striker Muto signs with Mainz,"Japanese international striker Yoshinori Muto has signed a four-year deal with Mainz from FC Tokyo, the Bundesliga club confirmed on Saturday.","The 22-year-old, capped 11 times, scored 13 goals in 33 matches for FC Tokyo in his first season to equal a newcomers record in the J-League. ""We have been convinced for a long time that Yoshinori Muto can have the qualities to reinforce our attack and that is why we were so insistent in our negotiations with FC Tokyo,"" said Mainz sporting director Christian Heidel. Muto won his first cap for Japan last year and scored his first international goal in September during a match against Venezuela."
50,23/05/2015,18:46,Champions Bayern sign off with win over Mainz,Champions Bayern Munich ended their three-match losing streak in the Bundesliga with a season-ending 2-0 win over Mainz on Saturday as Hamburg and Stuttgart avoided relegation.,"A Robert Lewandowski penalty and Bastian Schweinsteiger goal saw Bayern bounce back after defeats by Leverkusen, Augsburg and Freiburg since their 25th German league title was confirmed at the end of April. Poland striker Lewandowski converted a 25th minute penalty after a handball by Mainz defender Nico Bungert. Germany captain Bastian Schweinsteiger scored their second just after the break to secure the win to kick-off celebrations in Munich as Pep Guardiola's side was presented with the trophy at the Allianz Arena. At the other end of the table, Freiburg and Paderborn went down as the relegation battle went to the wire. Freiburg's 2-1 defeat at Hanover 96 saw them drop to 17th and out of the league while Paderborn also return to the second division after one season in the Bundesliga with a 2-1 defeat at home to Stuttgart. VfB Stuttgart stayed in the Bundesliga thanks to Daniel Ginczek's winning goal for the visitors. Hamburg's 2-0 win at home to Schalke means they finish 16th thanks to goals by Ivica Olic and Slobodan Rajkovic. It means for the second year in succession, Hamburg face a two-legged relegation play-off against the side which finishes third in the second division, which will be decided on Sunday. Roberto di Matteo's Schalke finish sixth despite a poor end to the season which saw the Royal Blues win just two of their last ten games to miss out on a Champions League place next season. Augsburg's 2-1 win at Borussia Moenchengladbach saw them finish fifth to join Schalke in the Europa League for next season. Borussia Dortmund enjoyed a 3-2 win at home to Werder Bremen on Jurgen Klopp's final home game after seven years in charge amidst emotional scenes at the Westfalenstadion. Dortmund finish seventh, but can still claim a Europa League place under in-coming coach Thomas Tuchel depending on the out-come of next Saturday's German Cup final against Wolfsburg. Japan midfielder Shinji Kagawa profited from a superb pass by Ilkay Gundogan to score Dortmund's first on 15 minutes. Gabon striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang scored the hosts second just two minutes later before Bremen pulled a goal back through midfielder Levin Oztunali on 26 minutes. But Dortmund made sure of the win when Henrikh Mkhitaryan controlled Kagawa's high pass to lob Bremen goalkeeper Koen Casteels just before the break while Czech defender Theodor Gebre Selassie scored Bremen's late second to set up a tense finale. Hertha Berlin finish just above the relegation places after their 2-1 defeat at Hoffenheim while Wolfsburg finished second with a 2-2 draw at Cologne. Bayer Leverkusen finish fourth despite a 2-1 defeat Eintracht Frankfurt as Karim Bellarabi's early goal was cancelled out by goals from Eintracht pair Haris Seferovic and Alexander Madlung."
51,12/05/2015,08:25,Japan's Muto to snub Chelsea for Mainz,"In-form Japan striker Yoshinori Muto is expected to join Germany's Mainz 05 after rejecting an offer from English Premier League champions Chelsea, newspapers said Tuesday.","The Bundesliga team and Muto's current club, FC Tokyo, have reached a basic agreement on the 22-year-old's transfer, Sports Nippon daily said, quoting unnamed Mainz officials. Details of his salary were not made available, but the paper said Mainz are ready to offer 3.0 million euros (402 million yen) as a transfer fee. Nikkan Sports said other Bundesliga clubs were also sounding out the J-league team over a possible swoop. The reports came after Chelsea made a formal offer for Muto worth a reported $5.9 million, which would have been a record transfer from the J-League to an overseas club. But with the English team's depth of talent and experience, particularly up front, there were concerns Muto might struggle to get playing time. The German league, where Japanese players including Shinji Kagawa have thrived, would be likely to offer Muto more opportunities to get off the bench, the Sports Nippon said. An FC Tokyo spokeswoman declined to comment on the reports. Muto began his professional career at FC Tokyo last year, scoring 13 goals in 33 games to match the first-division record for a player in his rookie season. The baby-faced striker also made his debut for Japan in 2014 and bagged his first international goal in a 2-2 draw against Venezuela in September. Muto has eight goals in 11 games this season, helping FC Tokyo move into joint second place in the J-League standings just one point behind leaders Urawa Reds."

54,03/05/2015,18:14,Late strike sees Hamburg escape bottom three,Hamburg escaped the relegation places for the first time since March on Sunday after Gojko Kacar's last-gasp goal sealed a 2-1 win at ten-man Mainz.,"Hamburg were gifted a first-half lead thanks to an own goal when Heiko Westermann's cross clipped Mainz's Julian Baumgartlinger and flew into the net on 37 minutes. Mainz threatened to equalise after the break when South Korea international Joo Ja-Cheol hit the post after some good work by Japan striker Shinji Okazaki on 69 minutes just before the hosts drew level. Spanish midfielder Jairo Bustara put in a cross which Mainz midfielder Yunus Malli fired home. But Hamburg's Serbian international Kacar, who is out of contract at the end of the season, slammed home his shot from just outside the area with 87 minutes gone to give the visitors the three points. Mainz were reduced to ten men on 90 minutes when defender Daniel Brosinski was shown a straight red card for fouling Artjoms Rudnevs who was through on goal. Hamburg are battling to avoid a first relegation as they are the only side in Germany's top flight never to have previously gone down and the win drags them up to 14th while Mainz stay tenth. On Saturday, Bayer Leverkusen fired two goals past Germany's World Cup hero Manuel Neuer to stop the goalkeeper claiming a slice of Bayern Munich history and boost Bayer's Champions League hopes. Neuer went into the game seeking one more clean sheet to beat Oliver Kahn's record of 19 Bayern games in a season without conceding a goal. But Bayern soon regretted fielding a weakened side as they prepare for a Champions League semi-final on Wednesday against Barcelona. Leverkusen's Turkish international Hakan Calhanoglu fired a direct free kick from 25 metres through the Bayern wall and past Neuer. In the second half, Karim Bellarabi tore through the Bayern defence in a brilliant length of the field run before passing to Julian Brandt who claimed an easy goal on his 19th birthday. The result was a new disappointment for Bayern after their midweek loss in the German Cup semi-final, but coach Pep Guardiola already has the Bundesliga title wrapped up and rested key players for the Champions League campaign. The 2-0 win took Leverkusen, now unbeaten in 10 league games, into third place one point ahead of Borussia Moenchengladbach and into one of the three automatic qualifying places for next season's Champions League before Gladbach play at Hertha Berlin later on Sunday. Second placed Wolfsburg gave up a two-goal lead to draw 2-2 at relegation threatened Hanover 96. Wolves' German Cup final opponents Borussia Dortmund also drew 1-1 at Hoffenheim with both sides chasing a Europa League spot for next season, but stay just outside the top six. Fifth place Schalke secured their first win since March with a 3-2 against VfB Stuttgart to keep them on course for next season's Europa League."
55,22/03/2015,17:41,Mid-table Mainz hold high-flying Wolfsburg,Second-placed Wolfsburg were held to a surprise 1-1 draw by mid-table Mainz on Sunday which leaves runaway German league leaders Bayern Munich poised to extend their huge points advantage.,"Pep Guardiola's Bayern host fourth-placed Borussia Moenchengladbach at the Allinanz Arena later on Sunday and a 12th win from 13 home league matches this season would leave the Bavarian giants 13 points clear. Mainz took a shock seventh-minute lead against Wolfsburg when defender Niko Bungert out-jumped the Wolfsburg defence to head home from a corner. The hosts looked to have doubled their lead but Japan striker Shinji Okazaki's 40th-minute strike was ruled offside. Wolfsburg made their possession count as Brazil midfielder Luiz Gustavo hit the post, then scored their equaliser on 61 minutes. The result left Wolfsburg 10 points adrift of Bayern. On Saturday, Germany winger Karim Bellarabi fired Bayer Leverkusen into the Bundesliga's top three with a 1-0 win at Schalke 04. Having bowed out of the Champions League after suffering the heartbreak of a penalty shoot-out defeat to Atletico Madrid in the last 16, Leverkusen leap-frogged Gladbach into third in Germany's top flight. Bellarabi, who has been linked to Arsenal, grabbed the 35th-minute winner from the tightest of angles with a superb shot across goal. Schalke coach Roberto di Matteo was bitterly disappointed as the defeat left his side five points from a possible Champions League place for next season. Borussia Dortmund also bounced back from their mid-week Champions League exit with a 3-2 win at 10-man Hanover to earn their first victory in four games. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang netted twice as Dortmund picked up valuable league points after goalless draws against Hamburg and Cologne. Borussia took the lead through Aubameyang on 19 minutes, but Hanover hit back when Lars Stindl's weak shot beat the visitors' defence. Dortmund captain Mats Hummels then headed off the line, but the game turned on 55 minutes when ex-Dortmund midfielder Leonardo Bittencourt was sent off for a second yellow card and Borussia made the numerical advantage. Japan midfielder Shinji Kagawa netted his first league goal since September on 57 minutes, then set up Aubameyang for his second goal on 61 minutes before Stindl made it 3-2 with eight minutes left. The win left Borussia tenth with Hanover 14th and two points from relegation. Bremen stay ninth after being held to a 1-1 draw at mid-table Cologne as a first-half goal by Germany Under-19 striker Davie Selke for the visitors was cancelled out by an 88th-minute penalty from Cologne midfielder Matthias Lehmann. Freiburg climbed out of the bottom three with a 2-0 win at home to Augsburg thanks to second-half goals from Jonathan Schmid and Nils Petersen. Paderborn stay second-from-bottom after their goalless draw at home to ten-man Hoffenheim, who had Bosnia defender Ermin Bicakcic sent off for a second yellow card. VfB Stuttgart remain rooted to the foot of the table despite their 3-1 comeback win at home to Eintracht Frankfurt. The result means just two points separate the bottom four teams of Stuttgart, Freiburg, Paderborn and Hamburg in Germany's top flight."
56,18/03/2015,14:39,Dortmund plan to recall loaned Germany starlets,"Borussia Dortmund plan on recalling loaned Germany Under-21 internationals Moritz Leitner and Jonas Hofmann for next season, according to director of sport Michael Zorc on Wednesday.","Leitner, 22, has spent the season on loan at VfB Stuttgart, where he has scored one goal in 18 games, while Hofmann, 21, has netted three times in 10 games at Mainz, but both had previously played for Dortmund's senior side and Germany's junior teams. ""Both of them will return at the end of the season, that's how things stand,"" Zorc told German magazine Sport Bild. Zorc also believes Dortmund are moving closer to extending the contract of Germany midfielder Ilkay Gundogan, whose contract expires in June 2016. ""Let me put it in sober terms, I believe that both for him and us a contract extension would make sense,"" Zorc told German daily Bild. The club are hoping Gundogan will follow the lead of Germany team-mate Marco Reus who extended his Borussia stay until 2019 by signing a new deal last month. Dortmund are tenth in the Bundesliga and host Italian champions Juventus on Wednesday in the last 16 of the Champions League, looking to overturn a 2-1 defeat from the first leg in Turin last month."
57,14/02/2015,12:35,Beating Mainz caps Dortmund's red-letter week,"Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang admits Borussia Dortmund's 4-2 win over Mainz, to climb out of the relegation places, was almost as good as hearing Marco Reus had extended his contract earlier in the week.","""That was the best news of the week,"" admitted Gabon goal-scorer Aubameyang after Friday's win at Dortmund's Westfalenstadion. On Tuesday, Germany winger Reus ended weeks of speculation that he was set to quit at the end of the season by announcing he had signed a new contract until 2019. The Mainz victory capped a red-letter week for Borussia, who had climbed off the bottom of the table with a 3-0 at Freiburg last Saturday. Neven Subotic, Nuri Sahin, Reus and Aubemayang scored in the goal-fest against Mainz as Dortmund moved up from 16th to 14th in the table. The manner of the win is an added bonus as Borussia both rediscovered their ability to score goals and secured back-to-back victories for the first time this season. Despite falling behind to Elkin Soto's first-minute goal, Dortmund equalised through Subotic's 50th-minute header before Reus put them 2-1 up with a superb strike just after the break. Yunus Malli levelled for Mainz just two minutes later, but Dortmund proved their attack is back on form when a curling Reus pass off the side of his boot found Aubemayang who beat the goalkeeper and a defender. Sahin then volleyed home their fourth to cap an impressive display. ""The 4-2 is deserved, because we followed it up with fantastic goals,"" enthused Dortmund coach Jurgen Klopp, as Borussia climbed up to just behind 13th-placed Mainz. ""It was a six-point game, because the victory meant we were able to catch up with Mainz. ""Now we need to bring more consistency in our performance. The next games will not be easy."" Dortmund are away at both bottom side VfB Stuttgart on Friday, then Italian league leaders Juventus on February 24 in the Champions League last 16, before hosting Schalke 04 in the Ruhr Valley derby four days later. ""The entire season is an extreme challenge for us,"" added Klopp. ""The early goal we conceded was another comedy of errors, even if Soto did finish well, but we reacted immediately and could have scored straight away through Reus and Shinji Kagawa. ""We know we will have chances if we continue to play like that."" It is hard to overstate the importance of Reus' commitment to Borussia as Dortmund worked hard to keep their star forward after seeing Mario Goetze and Robert Lewandowski leave for Bayern Munich in recent years. ""It was great news for the whole region. Everyone was a bit euphoric today,"" explained Germany midfielder Ilkay Gundogan, as the Mainz victory was the icing on the cake for Dortmund fans."
58,26/10/2014,17:52,Wolves down Mainz to go second in Bundesliga,VfL Wolfsburg went provisionally second in the Bundesliga as they inflicted Mainz's first defeat of the season with a 3-0 win on Sunday.,"Goals by Naldo, Ivan Perisic and Daniel Caliguri gave the hosts the three points and second spot on goal difference from Hoffenheim -- Borussia Moenchengladbach could regain second with a victory or draw over leaders and defending champions Bayern Munich later on Sunday. Wolfsburg -- for whom Belgian playmaker Kevin de Bruyne was outstanding -- took the lead when Brazilian defender Naldo headed home from a corner after only 15 minutes. Mainz's goalkeeper Loris Karius denied De Bruyne when he pushed the former Chelsea midfielder's fierce strike over the bar on 58 minutes, but Wolves' second goal came from the resulting corner. Naldo was again left unmarked in the area and he headed on for Croatian international Perisic to guide his header past Karius from close range. Caliguri made sure of the win on 87 minutes when he tapped home a cross by Belgium Under-21 international Junior Malanda. On Saturday, Borussia Dortmund's horror run of domestic league results continued as a 1-0 defeat -- their fourth successive loss -- by Hanover 96 left them 15th and just a point above the relegation places. They have the daunting task of facing Bayern Munich next Saturday. Dortmund's terrible domestic form is in stark contrast to their Champions League campaign, where they top their group with three straight wins after Wednesday's impressive 4-0 victory at Galatasaray. In a bid to bring their European form to the Bundesliga, Dortmund even had special permission to face Hanover in their Champions League strip, but to no avail. Roberto di Matteo failed to pick up his third straight win as Schalke 04 coach on Saturday evening as the Royal Blues lost 1-0 at ten-man Bayer Leverkusen in the battle between two of Germany's Champions League sides. Turkey midfielder Hakan Calhanoglu settled the matter with a superbly-struck free-kick on 53 minutes although the hosts suffered a blow with the loss of German international midfielder Stefan Reinartz for three months after fracturing an eye socket. Bottom side Werder Bremen sacked coach Robin Dutt on Saturday, less than 24 hours after his side's 1-0 defeat at home to Cologne. The 49-year-old is the third Bundesliga coach casualty this season after Mirko Slomka (from Hamburg) and Jens Keller (Schalke 04). Bremen's Under-23 coach Viktor Skripnik has been appointed as caretaker coach, with ex-Germany midfielder Torsten Frings during the search for Dutt's successor."
59,29/08/2014,17:36,Sevilla's Jairo signs for Mainz,"Sevilla winger Jairo Samperio has signed a four-year deal with Mainz, the German Bundesliga club confirmed on Friday.","Mainz lost two of their attacking stalwarts at the end of last season, with Cameroonian Eric-Maxim Choupo-Moting and Nicolai Müller signing for Schalke 04 and Hamburg respectively. And manager Christian Heidel said they had been impressed by Jairo after he helped Sevilla win the Europa League crown last season and featured for Spain at the under-20 World Cup last year in Turkey. ""Jairo is the player that we've been looking for to bolster our forward line,"" said Heidel of the 21-year-old. ""He is a young player who is constantly evolving but who has already played three years at the highest level in Spain,"" he added of the 21-year-old without giving financial details. Jairo made 25 appearances for Sevilla last season after joining from Racing Santander. However, he missed the Europa League final win against Benfica due to suspension."
60,19/08/2014,02:05,Germany riding crest of wave as Bundesliga begins,The new Bundesliga season gets underway this weekend with German football riding the crest of a wave following the national team's triumph at the World Cup in Brazil last month.,"That thoroughly deserved victory, given to Joachim Loew's side by Mario Goetze's extra-time strike in the final against Argentina, saw a unified Germany crowned as world champions for the first time. But at club level, the Bundesliga has been leading the way for some time. It averaged 3.16 goals per game last season, considerably more than any of its major European counterparts, while average gates were over 42,000, making the German top flight the best attended league anywhere. ""In my opinion, the Bundesliga's the most attractive league in the world,"" Borussia Moenchengladbach coach Lucien Favre told bundesliga.com. ""The hype in Germany is amazing, and now they've won the World Cup so it's not going to tail off in a rush."" Nevertheless, the biggest problem facing the Bundesliga, as ever, is how to counter the dominance of Bayern Munich, who have romped to the title and added the German Cup in each of the last two campaigns. They have seen Toni Kroos and Mario Mandzukic depart and lost Javi Martinez to a serious knee injury in last week's SuperCup defeat to Borussia Dortmund, but the Bavarians remain favourites. And yet the rest can draw some hope from the very fact this is a Bundesliga season immediately following a World Cup, and that has not tended to help Bayern in the recent past. After Germany hosted the 2006 World Cup, Stuttgart went on to win the Bundesliga, while in 2011 Dortmund pipped Bayern to the title. In 2009, after Germany reached the Euro 2008 final, it was Wolfsburg who were champions. Six members of Pep Guardiola's squad played in the World Cup final, including Goetze, while Dante and Arjen Robben were also involved until the latter stages in Brazil. That is why chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge wanted the start of the new season delayed in order to give these players longer to prepare, but that request was unsurprisingly turned down by Bayern's rivals. ""We have to face the fact that the first half of the season will be difficult,"" said Guardiola, who at times had only a skeleton squad in pre-season training. ""We are at least one month behind schedule."" Guardiola has added to his squad with compatriots Juan Bernat from Valencia and Pepe Reina, who will provide competition in goal for Manuel Neuer. But the marquee signing was Robert Lewandowski, a prolific goalscorer for Dortmund in the last four years. However, Dortmund have moved to replace the Pole by signing Italy striker Ciro Immobile from Torino and Colombia's Adrian Ramos from Hertha Berlin. Stability is key at the Signal Iduna Park, where coach Jurgen Klopp, who led Dortmund to back-to-back titles in 2011 and 2012 and a Champions League final defeat to Bayern in 2013, is entering his seventh season in charge. ""We want to establish ourselves further at the top of the league and qualify directly for the Champions League,"" said sporting director Michael Zorc modestly. However, Guardiola knows where the danger lies, saying: ""We may have won the last two league titles, but they clinched the previous two. Our great challenge is to keep up our level to keep them at distance."" Beneath them, Schalke, Bayer Leverkusen and Wolfsburg will again be hoping to contend for Champions League qualification at least. Schalke have kept Klaas-Jan Huntelaar and Julian Draxler, while Sidney Sam has joined from Leverkusen, and few teams can boast a midfield as strong as Wolfsburg, with Kevin de Bruyne, Luiz Gustavo and France's Josuha Guilavogui. Bayer have signed Swiss striker Josip Drmic from Nuremberg and have a new coach in Roger Schmidt, back in his native country after winning the Austrian title with Salzburg. Hamburg will be hoping for a stable campaign after almost being relegated for the first time in their history last season. There are new coaches at Mainz, Eintracht Frankfurt and Stuttgart, who have reappointed Armin Veh, the architect of their 2007 title triumph, while Cologne are back among the elite and Paderborn are in the Bundesliga for the first time."
