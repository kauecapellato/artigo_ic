""He wasn't happy at Bayern,"" said Rummenigge, who also confirmed that Parma had the option to buy Zirkzee outright for 15 million euros ($18 million) should they avoid relegation this season. USA youth international Richards meanwhile joined Bundesliga rivals Hoffenheim on a six-month loan deal. The 20-year-old defender follows a path previously trodden by teammate David Alaba, who spent six months at Hoffenheim in 2011 before breaking into the Bayern first team. Alaba himself looks set to leave Bayern in the summer, with Rummenigge telling Sky that the 28-year-old's departure was ""99.9 percent"" certain. The Bayern CEO also reaffirmed the club's interest in RB Leipzig and France defender Upamecano as a possible replacement for Alaba. Yet he admitted that English Premier League clubs Chelsea and Liverpool were also in the race. ""There are at least two other attractive competitors,"" said Rummenigge. ""When clubs like Chelsea and Liverpool are interested in him, it shows what quality the player has,"" he added."
1,01/02/2021,14:47,"Messi fuels Barcelona revival, Marseille violence, Poch beaten: Talking points from around Europe","Lionel Messi kept up his improved form in La Liga as Barcelona won again amid more controversy about the Catalans' finances, while there was drama on and off the field in France and the Milan clubs continue to fight it out at the top of Serie A.","AFP Sport rounds up some of the main talking points from across the continent: Barcelona have said they will take legal action against Spanish newspaper El Mundo after it published details at the weekend of Lionel Messi's current contract, which it says is worth up to 555 million euros ($674 million) over four years. El Mundo called it the ""colossal contract that ruins Barcelona"", just as the Catalans are wrestling with a dire financial situation, worsened by the pandemic, and with Messi's future currently up in the air. Yet the Argentine underlined his value to Barca by scoring a superb free-kick in their 2-1 win over Athletic Bilbao. Barca are unbeaten in 10 n La Liga, winning eight, with Messi scoring eight times in that run. However, both Barcelona and Real Madrid are 10 points behind leaders Atletico Madrid, who beat Cadiz 4-2 and still boast a game in hand. Marseille's weekend game against Rennes in Ligue 1 was postponed after angry supporters attacked the club's training ground, while the players were there, in what was called ""a frenzy of unjustifiable violence"". Local police said 25 arrests were made and seven officers were injured after several hundred Ultras stormed La Commanderie in a protest against the club leadership and the team's poor recent run of results. Marseille's owner, the American tycoon Frank McCourt, called the protestors ""thugs"" and likened the incidents to last month's storming of the US Congress. The growing crisis comes with the former Champions League winners having slumped to ninth in Ligue 1 and after coach Andre Villas-Boas indicated he will leave at the end of the season. On the pitch in France, the title race is hotting up after reigning champions Paris Saint-Germain suffered their first defeat under new coach Mauricio Pochettino, conceding at the death to lose 3-2 at struggling Lorient despite Neymar scoring two penalties. It was a fifth defeat in Ligue 1 this season for PSG, who are third, three points behind leaders Lille. Lille beat Dijon 1-0, while Lyon are two points off top spot in second after scoring late to beat Bordeaux 2-1. It could even become a four-way fight. Monaco are six points off the lead after winning their last five games. Bayern Munich maintained their seven-point lead at the top of the German Bundesliga by beating Hoffenheim 4-1 as Robert Lewandowski scored his 24th goal of the league campaign. After a mini slump, the Bavarians have now four on the bounce and remain well clear of nearest rivals RB Leipzig. The result against Hoffenheim also allowed Hansi Flick's side to exact perfect revenge for their 4-1 defeat away to the same opponents in September, in what was their only loss in 46 matches in all competitions across a remarkable 2020. The only cloud on Bayern's weekend came as midfielder Corentin Tolisso was dropped and fined for getting a tattoo, therefore falling foul of Covid-19 quarantine regulations. Zlatan Ibrahimovic's spat with Romelu Lukaku dominated the headlines last midweek as Inter beat AC Milan in their Coppa Italia derby. On Saturday Ibrahimovic missed a penalty for the fourth time this season but Ante Rebic followed up to score and Franck Kessie later netted another spot-kick as Milan won 2-1 at Bologna. That result kept the Rossoneri two points clear of Inter at the top of Serie A, as Antonio Conte's side beat Benevento 4-0 with Lukaku scoring a brace at San Siro. The Belgian is on 14 league goals for the season and Inter remain best-placed to overhaul Milan, even if Roma, Juventus, Lazio and Napoli all also won at the weekend."
2,30/01/2021,17:40,Bayern Munich go 10 points clear in Bundesliga,Bayern Munich moved 10 points clear at the top of the Bundesliga on Saturday with a 4-1 victory over Hoffenheim as Robert Lewandowski continued his incredible scoring run with his 24th league goal this season.,"Lewandowski scored for the ninth straight Bundesliga game, while Jerome Boateng, Thomas Mueller and Serge Gnabry also hit the net at the Allianz Arena. Bayern extended their lead over second-placed RB Leipzig, who host Bayer Leverkusen later on Saturday. Elsewhere, England winger Jadon Sancho scored his third goal of 2021 as Borussia Dortmund bounced back from consecutive defeats to go fifth with a 3-1 home win against Augsburg."
3,29/01/2021,03:03,Hoffenheim plot new Bayern shock on Munich return,"As the architect of Bayern Munich's single defeat in 2020, Hoffenheim coach Sebastian Hoeness hopes to again down the European champions in the Bundesliga on Saturday when he returns to his former club.","Bayern host mid-table Hoffenheim at the Allianz Arena seeking revenge for September's 4-1 league defeat - their only loss of 2020 in any competition. The shock win over the European champions ""will certainly still be in our heads,"" admitted Hoeness, ""but we want to use this game to annoy Bayern again"". Bayern hold a seven-point lead in the table and are near full-strength with only Corentin Tolisso and Tanguy Nianzou sidelined. After poor results around Christmas, Hoffenheim are back up to 11th thanks to back-to-back 3-0 wins against strugglers Hertha Berlin and Cologne. However, the European champions are a huge test for Hoffenheim on Hoeness' return to Munich, where the 38-year-old coached the reserves last season having previously worked with Bayern's junior teams. A key factor Saturday is the form of Hoffenheim striker Andrej Kramaric, who has scored twice in each of his last two games. Leading the pack chasing Bayern, RB Leipzig host Bayer Leverkusen on Saturday night with both clubs eager to bounce back from defeats. After crashing 3-2 at second-from-bottom Mainz, Leipzig coach Julian Nagelsmann compared Bayern to Germany's high-speed ICE trains and his team to a regional train, struggling to ""catch up"". In order to get back on track, Leipzig must beat third-placed Leverkusen, who trail them by three points. ""The game has no direct influence on the title race - it's all about qualifying for the Champions League,"" Nagelsmann insisted Thursday. Leipzig welcome back Yussuf Poulsen after a groin injury, but playmaker Emil Forsberg is sidelined by a knee knock. Leverkusen, who crashed at home to Wolfsburg last weekend, are missing midfielders Julian Baumgartlinger, who underwent knee surgery on Monday, and Nadiem Amiri, who is quarantined after testing positive for Covid-19. Having slipped out of the European places to seventh, Dortmund host Augsburg on Saturday chasing a first win in four games. ""We have to correct mistakes from set-pieces,"" said caretaker coach Edin Terzic after Dortmund conceded three goals from deadball situations in a 4-2 defeat at Gladbach. Erling Braut Haaland scored twice in the Gladbach defeat, but Dortmund need him and England winger Jadon Sancho to fire their attack. ""When they (Augsburg) make mistakes, we have to be there - ice-cold,"" added Terzic. Eintracht Frankfurt, who are a point above Dortmund in the table and bouyed by a 5-1 thrashing of Bielefeld, are home on Saturday to Hertha Berlin, where Pal Dardai is back in charge. The 44-year-old replaces Bruno Labbadia, who was sacked following their 4-1 thrashing at home by Werder Bremen. Frankfurt striker Luka Jovic has scored three goals in three appearances off the bench since returning on loan from Real Madrid. Dardai predicts it could be ""5-4 or 6-5"" at Frankfurt, who ""score a lot of goals.... we're going there to score one more"". The Croatia striker scored twice in last September's 4-1 win over Bayern and has also netted two goals in Hoffenheim's recent wins against Hertha and Cologne. He is back in form after contracting Covid-19 on international duty last October which sidelined him for seven games. Kramaric will test Bayern's defence and his four goals in two games, ""speak for themselves,"" said Hoffenheim coach Hoeness. 76 - the minutes Luka Jovic has needed for three goals off the bench having been loaned back to Eintracht Frankfurt after failing to settle at Real. 18 - home league games since Bayern last lost at the Allianz Arena when Leverkusen managed a 2-1 win in November 2019. 1 - the single victory Hoffenheim has managed at the Allianz Arena, poaching a 2-1 win in Munich in October 2019.

4,23/01/2021,15:44,Hoffenheim's Danish winger Bruun Larsen loaned to Anderlecht,"Denmark winger Jacob Bruun Larsen has left Hoffenheim to join Anderlecht on loan until the end of the season, the Belgian club announced Saturday.","Bruun Larsen first arrived in the Bundesliga at Borussia Dortmund in 2015, at the age of 16, before moving to Hoffenheim in January last year. This season, the now 22-year-old, who has one cap for Denmark, has played two Bundesliga matches for Hoffenheim and appeared once in the Europa League."
5,11/01/2021,13:30,Who is Matthew Hoppe? Meet the new Bundesliga star and Schalke hero,Matthew Hoppe earned instant hero status at Schalke with his hat-trick in the 4-0 win over Hoffenheim on Saturday that saved his club from matching the Bundesliga record for the most consecutive games without a win. So who exactly is this latest young American to break through in Germany?,"At Schalke the 19-year-old is following in the footsteps of Texas-born Weston McKennie, who left the Gelsenkirchen club to join Juventus on loan at the start of this season. There was also Christian Pulisic at Borussia Dortmund before he signed for Chelsea, while Hoppe's peers this season include Gio Reyna at Dortmund, Josh Sargent at Werder Bremen, RB Leipzig's Tyler Adams and Chris Richards at Bayern Munich. And then there is Pellegrino Matarazzo, the New Jersey-born coach of VfB Stuttgart. The Bundesliga has been good to American players in recent years and they have been good for Germany's top flight, helping raise its profile across the Atlantic. Hoppe, though, will settle for being revered in the blue half of the Ruhr region. Hoppe is from southern California and joined Schalke in 2019 after playing for the Barcelona Residency Academy USA in Arizona. He scored 29 goals in 23 games in 2018/19 while playing for Barca's USA academy and committed to San Diego State University before being offered a trial with Schalke. After moving to Germany, he did enough to impress in Schalke's reserves last season despite scoring a single goal in 16 games. The first team's dire form and lack of goals created a chance this season for Hoppe as Schalke's other strikers fell by the wayside. Vedad Ibisevic was sacked in November, Goncalo Paciencia picked up a knee injury and Wales forward Rabbi Matondo struggled before being loaned to English second-tier side Stoke City last week. Promoted to the first team in late November, Hoppe started on his Bundesliga debut, a 4-1 defeat at Borussia Moenchengladbach. Christian Gross, Schalke's fourth coach this season, arrived in late December and has clearly spotted Hoppe's talent. The former Tottenham manager selected him for his first two games, including Saturday's thrashing as Schalke ended an astonishing run of 30 games without a win, one shy of the all-time Bundesliga record of 31 set by Tasmania Berlin in the 1960s. ""I have no words,"" Hoppe said after becoming the first American to score a Bundesliga hat-trick on what was just his fifth appearance in the league. ""The first goal was the easiest as it was pure instinct,"" he said of his deft chip which put Schalke on the path to a first league win since January last year. ""I hope the team can keep fighting, stay confident and stay in the league."" Hoppe needed just 21 minutes for his three goals to become the third-youngest player to score a Bundesliga hat-trick. Ironically, Schalke are in their 30th straight season in the Bundesliga. One of Germany's best-supported teams, Hoppe's goals helped lift them off the bottom of the table, although they remain in the relegation zone, six points from outright safety after 15 games. ""He will always remember this day in his career,"" Gross said of Hoppe. The veteran coach described a player who ""doesn't shy away from working extremely hard"" in training and is ""unbelievably ambitious, has tremendous commitment and only thinks about Schalke. ""He wants to do whatever it takes to get us out of this situation. He's still very young and still has lots to learn in order to become a top-rate finisher, but we're working on that."" His hat-trick instantly made Hoppe Schalke's top scorer this season. Bayern are due in Gelsenkirchen in a fortnight, but Hoppe is not assured of his place with the Royal Blues still on the lookout for another striker. ""Nothing has changed. We're working hard to strengthen the squad - especially up front,"" Gross said."
6,11/01/2021,12:35,"Messi on form, a new American star and Bayern beaten: Talking points from around Europe","Lionel Messi is bang in form in the new year, Schalke avoided matching the Bundesliga record for the most consecutive games without a win and there was a very rare defeat for Bayern Munich.","AFP Sport rounds up some of the main talking points from across the continent: Lionel Messi looks like a man on a mission at the start of 2021 and what could be his final six months as a Barcelona player. On Saturday he scored twice -- including direct from a free-kick, one of his late-career specialities -- in a 4-0 win at Granada. That followed a masterful double and two shots off the post in a 3-2 midweek victory at Athletic Bilbao. Before that he provided the assist for Frenkie de Jong's winner at Huesca, and Barcelona have won three out of three since the turn of the year, while Messi is now La Liga's top scorer. Maybe it's not too late for Ronald Koeman's side to challenge for the title: they are third, four points behind leaders Atletico Madrid, albeit having played three games more. Matthew Hoppe is the latest young American to break through in the Bundesliga and he is already a hero for Schalke supporters. The California-born 19-year-old, who made his debut in November, had never scored a senior goal before netting a hat-trick -- the first ever for an American in the Bundesliga -- in the 4-0 defeat of Hoffenheim that rescued the Royal Blues from equalling an unwanted record. Their first win since January 17 last year, after 30 games without, prevented them from matching Tasmania Berlin's infamous German top-flight record of 31 games without a victory set in 1965/66. Hoppe has given hope to a whole club, and suddenly Schalke have new cause for optimism as they bid to beat the drop. They are off the bottom, above Mainz, but they remain in the relegation zone. Bayern Munich had begun to look a little less irresistible on a run of eight straight Bundesliga matches in which they had conceded the opening goal. But they had won five and drawn three of those matches. Then on Friday they were 2-0 up away to Borussia Moenchengladbach only to lose 3-2, just their second Bundesliga defeat since losing at the same ground in December 2019. It is a result that keeps the Bundesliga title race very much alive, although Hansi Flick's team have a winnable run of matches upcoming and they remain top, two points clear of RB Leipzig, who lost 3-1 at home to Borussia Dortmund, for whom Erling Braut Haaland scored twice. Third-placed Bayer Leverkusen are four points off the top after drawing 1-1 with Werder Bremen. Three days after a 3-1 home loss to reigning champions Juventus which ended a 27-game unbeaten run in Serie A stretching back to June, AC Milan bounced back to beat Torino 2-0 at San Siro. With second-placed city rivals Inter drawing at Roma, Milan are now three points clear at the top of the table, and remain seven ahead of Juventus, who are fourth but do have a game in hand. Added good news for Milan came with the return of veteran top scorer Zlatan Ibrahimovic as a late substitute for his first appearance since November 22 after injury. The Swede came on for Rafael Leao, who had earlier scored his third goal in five games. Can Zlatan now fire the Rossoneri to their first Scudetto since 2011? Mauricio Pochettino got his first victory as coach of Paris Saint-Germain, a 3-0 defeat of Brest, but it is Lyon who lead halfway through the Ligue 1 season. They claimed the symbolic title of autumn champions after coming back from 2-0 down to draw 2-2 at Rennes on Saturday with Memphis Depay scoring one fine goal before setting up Jason Denayer's equaliser. Rudi Garcia's team are unbeaten in 16 games although both PSG and Lille are just a point behind, and there is a very long way to go. Ensuring Depay stays to see out the remainder of his contract rather than leaving this month will be crucial."
7,09/01/2021,18:25,Schalke avoid Bundesliga longest winless run after Hoppe hat-trick,Schalke avoided a record-equalling 31st consecutive Bundesliga game without a victory on Saturday as American teenager Matthew Hoppe netted a hat-trick in a 4-0 thrashing of Hoffenheim to lift his side off the bottom of the table.,"After the 30-match run in the league, the Royal Blues enjoyed their first Bundesliga win in just under a year as 19-year-old Hoppe converted three chances created by Morocco's Amine Harit, who scored the fourth goal. ""The relief is big, huge even. But that was only one step. Now we have to move on,"" said sports director Jochen Schneider with his side still four points from guaranteed safety in the table. After his impressive display, Hoppe shyly claimed he had ""no words"" to describe the euphoria. ""I hope we keep fighting,"" he added. Mainz replace Schalke at the bottom of the table after a 2-0 home defeat to Eintracht Frankfurt, while Tasmania Berlin, who went 31 games without a win in the 1965/66 season, keep the Bundesliga record for the longest winless run. After league leaders Bayern Munich crashed to a 3-2 defeat at Borussia Moenchengladbach on Friday, second-placed RB Leipzig can go top with a home win against Borussia Dortmund later on Saturday. In Gelsenkirchen, Hoffenheim were missing 11 players either injured or suspended, while the hosts were captained by Sead Kolasinac, 27, who was making his first Schalke appearance back on loan from Arsenal. Both teams had early chances, but Hoppe got the breakthrough with a deft chip to put Schalke ahead just before the break. The teenager doubled the hosts' lead on 57 minutes when Harit's pass again put him in behind the defence to calmly round Hoffenheim's goalkeeper and fire into an empty net. Hoppe claimed his hat-trick just after the hour mark when put into space by another sublime Harit pass to fire home with another deft chip. Harit then completed the rout by hitting the bottom left-hand corner ten minutes from time. After defeats to Bayern and Eintracht Frankfurt, third-placed Bayer Leverkusen drew 1-1 at home to Werder Bremen as Patrik Schick equalised after Omer Toprak put Bremen ahead from a free-kick with only their second chance of the game. Union Berlin climbed to fourth after a controversial 2-2 draw at home to Wolfsburg, who came from behind after Maximilian Arnold was sent off just after the break. Renato Steffen gave Wolfsburg an early lead with a header, but Union striker Sheraldo Becker equalised with a crisp shot after squandering a clear chance. It was 1-1 at the break, but Arnold was shown a straight red for a nudge on Liverpool loanee Taiwo Awoniyi just outside the area and Union midfielder Robert Andrich fired in the resulting free-kick on 52 minutes. Union had the ball in the net again with an hour played, but the goal was disallowed as the referee judged Awoniyi had fouled Wolfsburg goalkeeper Koen Casteels. Wolfsburg striker Wout Weghorst equalised on 67 minutes by converting a penalty after a handball by Union defender Marcus Ingvartsen. Freiburg set a new club record of five straight league wins, which has seen them climb from 14th to eighth in the table, with a 5-0 romp at home to Cologne."
8,08/01/2021,12:01,Kolasinac back to help Schalke avoid record-equalling 31 winless games,Bundesliga bottom side Schalke welcome back Arsenal loanee Sead Kolasinac on Saturday in their desperate bid to avoid a league-record equalling 31 games without a win.,"Having joined Arsenal in 2017, Kolasinac, a product of Schalke's academy, returns on loan until the end of the season to help the club fight relegation after nearly thirty consecutive years in Germany's top flight. Their last league win was in January 2020 and failure to beat Hoffenheim at home will see Schalke equal the record of Tasmania Berlin, who went 31 games without a win during their single, disastrous Bundesliga season in 1965/66. ""No one should be afraid of this challenge,"" demanded Kolasinac, who made 123 appearances for Schalke from 2012 until 2017. ""I have a strong back, but I can't carry the whole load alone. ""We all have to stick together. We need the fans, the whole club, the supervisory board."" Approaching the halfway point of the season, Schalke are bottom and seven points from 15th which means guaranteed survival. Under Christian Gross, their fourth head coach since September, cash-strapped Schalke need a new forward after Wales striker Rabbi Matondo joined Stoke City on loan. Schalke are desperate to avoid matching Tasmania Berlin, who played in the 1965/66 Bundesliga season as last-minute replacements after Hertha Berlin were thrown out for breaking salary rules. Catapulted up from the regional leagues, Tasmania scored only 15 goals, won two of their 34 games, conceded a league-record 108 goals and were relegated in last place, never to return to the Bundesliga. Despite winning their first game in front of 80,000 at Berlin's Olympic Stadium, heavy defeats saw interest dwindle and just over 800 spectators turned up to one home game. ""It was a suicide mission,"" Hans-Gunter Becker, who captained Tasmania in 1965/66, told AFP subsidiary SID. ""We also had 800 spectators for one game, a record that will never happen again, unless you include the coronavirus era, but there is no need to talk about that."" The 82-year-old still remembers the stress of being branded the league's worst side and has sympathy with Schalke. ""I know from experience about this burden that weighs on the players,"" he added. ""I would really like it if the Schalke players find it in their hearts to say 'Let's leave the record to Tasmania'."""
9,08/01/2021,02:46,Road to nowhere: How bad is Schalke's wait for a win?,"Schalke host Hoffenheim on Saturday needing victory to avoid equalling the all-time Bundesliga record for most matches without a win of 31 games, set by Tasmania Berlin in the 1965/66 season.","Here, AFP Sport takes a look at other miserable winless streaks in Europe's biggest leagues: Derby County: 32 Premier League matches (2007/08) -- Newly-promoted Derby set multiple records in the 2007/08 Premier League, including the lowest points tally of only 11 from their 38 games. The Rams' only league win of the campaign came in their sixth fixture against Newcastle United, but they failed to secure another victory and were relegated in March. Sporting Gijon: 24 La Liga matches (1997/98) -- Sporting set several records in the 1997/98 La Liga season, including the longest winless run of 24 games, although that spanned two terms. They finished bottom of the Spanish top flight with a La Liga record-breaking 13 points, although they did at least win two games after finally snapping the streak on February 8, 1998. Like Derby, they were relegated in March, becoming the first La Liga side to have their fate sealed before April. Ancona: 28 Serie A matches (2003/04); Varese: 28 Serie A matches (1971/72) -- Ancona failed to win a single Serie A game between September 2003 and April 2004, although they did at least manage seven draws in their 28-match winless run. They mustered 13 points over the whole season, which fittingly ended in bankruptcy and relegation to the Italian fourth tier. Their run matches that of Varese, whose ""achievement"" in going 28 matches without a win was arguably even more impressive as it came in a 30-game season, in a 16-team league, in 1971-72. The club from just north of Milan, near the shores of Lake Maggiore, went almost the entire campaign without a victory before breaking their duck in the penultimate round of matches. Needless to say they finished bottom. Arles-Avignon: 23 Ligue 1 matches (2010/11) -- Arles-Avignon ""enjoyed"" a single season in France's top flight in 2010/11. They lost their first eight games in Ligue 1, eventually recording their maiden victory in early November. However that was followed by a miserable sequence of 23 games without tasting another win. By the time they won again, they had already been relegated. In fact their fate was sealed in record quick time, with seven games of the campaign remaining, and they finished 15 points adrift at the foot of the table. In 2015 they dropped down into the amateur ranks and are these days to be found plying their trade in the regional leagues. -- Although far from Europe's top leagues, Scottish outfit Fort William were dubbed the UK's ""worst professional football team"" during a run of 73 games without a win in all competitions. The Highland League outfit finally ended more than 700 days without success in 2019 with a North of Scotland Cup triumph over Nairn County. In the 2018-19 season, Fort William finished bottom of their league with minus seven points following a nine-point deduction, conceding 245 goals in 34 matches."
10,08/01/2021,02:45,Dortmund hunt win at high-fliers Leipzig to rejoin title race,Borussia Dortmund are hunting a win at second-placed RB Leipzig on Saturday to get back in the Bundesliga title race while elsewhere two German league records could be equalled this weekend.,"At the top of the table, Bayern Munich coach Hansi Flick can claim 100 league points in his first 39 games if the league leaders win at Borussia Moenchengladbach on Friday. Pep Guardiola is the only other Bundesliga coach to have reached the milestone in the same number of games after taking charge of Bayern in 2013. At the other end of the table, bottom side Schalke could equal the league record of 31 games without victory if they lose or draw at home to Hoffenheim. In Saturday night's top match, Dortmund head to Leipzig in the ""role of the hunter"", according to sports director Michael Zorc, chasing an away win to trim the eight-point gap behind leaders Bayern. A late Jadon Sancho goal sealed their 2-0 win at home to Wolfsburg last Sunday, but Dortmund are fourth after defeats to Stuttgart and Union Berlin in December dented their title hopes. Dortmund must break their habit of conceding goals at set pieces which has drawn fierce internal criticism. ""Too often we haven't played grown-up football and our style was bound to see us drop points,"" Dortmund defender Mats Hummels fumed in Sport Bild, harsh criticism caretaker coach Edin Terzic regards as ""legitimate and productive"". Up front, Dortmund striker Erling Braut Haaland needs to finish his chances after the 20-year-old fired a blank last Sunday on his return after a hip injury. Haaland's 16-year-old understudy Youssoufa Moukoko is struggling with a knee injury. Dortmund have lost five of their 14 games this season and Terzic can ill-afford to lose at Leipzig, 10 days before facing third-placed Bayer Leverkusen. ""The whole of January will set the tone for the rest of the Bundesliga season,"" Terzic admits. Leipzig are on a nine-match unbeaten run in the Bundesliga, including a thrilling 3-3 draw at Bayern last month, and their defence has only conceded nine league goals all season. Their head coach Julian Nagelsmann is ""already planning"" the club's first win over Dortmund since 2017, ""because we're brave enough, in a very good mood"" and have home advantage. Nagelsmann is missing several players as Christopher Nkunku aggravated an ankle injury in training, while new signing Dominik Szoboszlai is struggling with a groin problem. The Liverpool loanee has scored five goals in his last seven league games which has helped Union Berlin climb to fifth ahead of Saturday's home game against Wolfsburg. With Germany striker Max Kruse recovering from a knee injury, burly 23-year-old Awoniyi spearheaded Union's attack by setting up team-mate Sheraldo Becker before tapping home to seal a 2-0 win at Werder Bremen last Saturday. The Nigerian international is making an impact at Union after seven loan moves in three different countries since joining Liverpool in 2015 after winning the African Under-20 Championships. 19 - the league goals scored by Bayern striker Robert Lewandowski, who netted twice against Mainz last Sunday. Haaland is his nearest rival on 10 goals. 97 - the league points Flick has accumulated as Bayern Munich head coach in his first 38 games with 31 wins, four draws and three defeats since taking charge in November 2019. 31 - Jadon Sancho's goal against Wolfsburg was his 31st in the Bundeliga. The England winger turns 21 in March and no-one else has scored so many German league goals at such a young age. Fixtures (all times 1430GMT unless stated)"
11,02/01/2021,23:20,Olmo fires RB Leipzig top of Bundesliga ahead of Bayern Munich,RB Leipzig dislodged Bayern Munich at the top of the Bundesliga table Saturday as Dani Olmo's second-half goal was enough to seal a 1-0 win at Stuttgart.,"""It was really good for me and the team to start the year with a win,"" Olmo told DAZN. With European champions Bayern at home to strugglers Mainz on Sunday, Leipzig took the chance to go a point ahead as Olmo fired through the legs of Stuttgart goalkeeper Gregor Kobel. Stuttgart's Swiss shot-stopper had earlier pulled off some heroics by using his foot to save a Emil Forsberg first-half penalty attempt. Leipzig also wasted a golden chance when Amadou Haidara fired wide just after the break. With 23 minutes left, Spain midfielder Olmo finally got the breakthrough, finishing a move he started after Leipzig had moved the ball across the Stuttgart penalty area. ""It feels good to be top,"" admitted Leipzig defender Willi Orban. ""The first half was good, the second was better - we were clearly the dominant team."" Earlier, Bayer Leverkusen blew the chance to take first place after stumbling to a 2-1 defeat at Eintracht Frankfurt which saw them drop to third as the league resumed after a two-week break. ""I have made my feelings clear in the dressing room,"" Leverkusen head coach Peter Bosz told Sky. ""We deserved to lose. Frankfurt had a better claim to the victory."" Leverkusen midfielder Nadiem Amiri scored with a deft back-heel flick to give the visitors the lead after only 10 minutes in Frankfurt. However, Amin Younes equalised to make it 1-1 at half-time before Japan midfielder Daichi Kamada put in a cross which Leverkusen defender Edmond Tapsoba turned into his own net. Before kickoff, Frankfurt director Fredi Bobic confirmed reports his club are interested in Bayern's teenage striker Joshua Zirkzee, 19, after selling Dutch forward Bas Dost to Brugge. Zirkzee could back up Frankfurt's top scorer Andre Silva, who has notched nine league goals this season. Union Berlin rose to fourth - into the Champions League places for the first time in the club's history - after their 2-0 win at Werder Bremen. Liverpool loanee Taiwo Awoniyi, who has scored in his last three league games, capped another impressive display with a goal and assist. After Bremen lost the ball in their own half, the 23-year-old Nigeria international took advantage of a two-on-two situation by drawing the defence and passing to Sheraldo Becker, who fired home on 12 minutes. Awoniyi doubled Union's lead on 28 minutes by tapping the ball over the line, just out of the reach of Bremen goalkeeper Jiri Pavlenka. Bremen had a penalty appeal turned down when a shot by Japan midfielder Yuya Osako clipped the hand of a Union defender, then Romano Schmid had a goal ruled offside. Hoffenheim lost both defender Kevin Akpoguma and Germany midfielder Sebastian Rudy with early leg injuries as they crashed to a 3-1 home defeat to Freiburg. With the hosts struggling to reshuffle, Freiburg were 3-0 up at half-time thanks to a Baptiste Santamaria goal, a Vincenzo Grifo penalty and an own goal by Senegal defender Kasim Adams. Hoffenheim scored a second-half consolation goal through Togo winger Ihlas Bebou. Borussia Moenchengeladbach, who host Manchester City in the first leg of the Champions League last 16 next month, earned their first win in five league games with a 1-0 victory at Arminia Bielefeld. Swiss striker Breel Embolo netted the winning goal just after half-time when he held off a defender and fired home. Mid-table Augsburg rebounded after back-to-back defeats with a 1-0 win at Cologne with Brazilian winger Iago netting the late winner. Bottom side Schalke are now 30 games without a win -- one short of the Bundesliga record -- after a 3-0 defeat away to Hertha Berlin. Former Tottenham manager Christian Gross, installed as Schalke's fourth head coach this season, got off to a losing start as Arsenal loanee Matteo Guendouzi, Colombia striker Jhon Cordoba and his replacement, Poland forward Krzysztof Piatek, scored for Hertha. Having netted two minutes after coming off the bench, Piatek had a second late goal ruled offside."

Thuram was sent off after a video review showed him spitting in the face of Stefan Posch of Hoffenheim as the two argued during a Bundesliga match. With Gladbach down to 10 men, Hoffenheim scored a late goal and won 2-1. According to Bild daily, the fine could be in the region of 150,000 euros ($185,796) and constitute a club record sanction. ""Today something took place that is not in my character and must never happen."" Thuram, a 23-year-old France international, posted on Instagram after the game adding that the spit ""occurred accidentally and not intentionally."" ""I apologise to everyone, to Stefan Posch, to my opponents, to my team-mates, to my family and to all those who saw my reaction."" In addition to the club fine, Thuram faces a long ban from the German Football Association. Eberl said he had a ""long discussion"" with Thuram on Sunday morning and that the player was ""devastated"". Thuram ""told me that during a dispute with Stefan Posch, he had unintentionally spat after cursing several times in French in the heat of the moment. ""He knows that this doesn't change anything and that the pictures speak for themselves, and that the sending off was the right call,"" said Eberl. ""I have come to know him as a reflective person with a great demeanour,"" said Eberl. ""He remains the same person we know, and we will stand by him."""
13,19/12/2020,17:57,Gladbach forward Thuram sent off after spitting in opponent's face,Borussia Moenchengladbach forward Marcus Thuram was sent off for spitting in an opponent's face during Saturday's 2-1 home defeat against Hoffenheim in the Bundesliga.,"The French international was shown a straight red card with 11 minutes left, which turned the game after the VAR spotted Thuram spitting at Hoffenheim defender Stefan Posch. The incident happened just after Andrej Kramaric had equalised for Hoffenheim at Borussia Park. Nine minutes after Thuram's dismissal, Tottenham loanee Ryan Sessegnon put Hoffenheim ahead when he tapped in a cross unmarked at the far post. Gladbach, who face Manchester City in the last 16 of the Champions League in February, had gone ahead when their captain Lars Stindl converted a first-half penalty. Having made his France debut in November, this was the first time Thuram - the son of 1998 World Cup winner Lilian Thuram - has been sent off for Gladbach in his two seasons in Germany. Gladbach, winless in their last six games in all competitions, are now eighth in the league while Hoffenheim are up to 11th. With league leaders Bayer Leverkusen hosting European champions Bayern Munich on Saturday night, RB Leipzig missed the chance to go top after being held to a goalless draw at home to Cologne. The point leaves Leipzig second in the table on goal difference, but level on 28 points with Leverkusen. Despite bringing in Dutch veteran Huub Stevens, 67, on Friday as their third coach this season, Schalke are now 29 games without a win after their 1-0 defeat at home to Arminia Bielefeld. Bielefeld, who are also in the bottom three, secured the points thanks to a header from captain Fabian Klos. Schalke are now just two games from the unwanted league record of 31 winless games, set by Tasmania Berlin in 1965/66. Having been recently playing fourth-tier football for their reserves, Werder Bremen's 19-year-old striker Eren Dinkci enjoyed a fairytale Bundesliga debut. He scored their 90th-minute winner with a superb header to seal a 1-0 victory at Mainz just after coming off the bench. Frankfurt stay mid-table after their 2-0 away win at Augsburg as Stefan Ilsanker netted late on after an own-goal by Raphael Framberger for the hosts in Bavaria."
14,13/12/2020,20:48,Bailey fires Leverkusen top as late goal denies winless Schalke,"Jamaica winger Leon Bailey scored twice as Bayer Leverkusen knocked Bayern Munich off the top of the Bundesliga with a 4-1 win against Hoffenheim on Sunday, while bottom side Schalke saw their winless run stretch to 27 games in a dramatic 2-2 draw with Augsburg.","Bailey opened the scoring with a scintillating strike early on against Hoffenheim as in-form Leverkusen picked up their seventh win of the season to leapfrog champions Bayern into top spot. ""The table is only a snapshot, but it's an important one because we know how tough this league can be,"" said midfielder Julian Baumgartlinger after Leverkusen went top for the first time in six years. Hoffenheim's Florian Grillitsch brushed the bar with a header after just 14 seconds, but it was Leverkusen who landed the first blow on four minutes. Playing a quick one-two with Nadiem Amiri from a Leverkusen corner, Bailey curled the ball brilliantly into the top corner from the edge of the penalty area. A misjudged pass from Andrej Kramaric allowed Bailey to double the lead just before the half-hour mark, rounding stranded goalkeeper Oliver Baumann and slotting the ball into the open goal from 20 yards out. Baumann kept his side in the game with a flying save to deny Florian Wirtz just before half-time, and Christoph Baumgartner pulled a goal back with a brilliant long-range strike after the break. Yet Hoffenheim's joy was short-lived, as Wirtz danced through the box and beat Baumann with a dainty chip on 55 minutes. The visitors' fate was sealed when both Grillitsch and Stefan Posch were sent off for second yellow cards within 15 minutes, and Lucas Alario added a fourth for Leverkusen with a stoppage-time penalty. Earlier Sunday, Schalke's hopes of a first win in 27 games were dashed by Marco Richter's stoppage-time equaliser in a 2-2 draw overshadowed by a serious injury to Mark Uth. Richter's late header crowned a heartbreaking evening for Schalke, who remain on course to equal Tasmania Berlin's notorious, 54-year-old Bundesliga record of 31 games without a win. Schalke's misery was compounded by concerns for Uth, who was stretchered from the field unconscious after a clash of heads with Augsburg defender Felix Uduokhai in the 10th minute. The striker was treated on-field for around 15 minutes before being carried from the pitch attached to a drip and wearing a neck brace. Schalke later confirmed that the 29-year-old was ""stable and responsive"" and on his way to hospital, but both sets of players were left visibly shocked by the incident. ""I didn't realise how serious it was at first, but then I saw him lying on the floor. A lot of things go through your head, I was scared and worried. I am so happy that he is ok,"" Uduokhai told Sky. After the game resumed with a 15-minute delay, Augsburg took the lead from a corner in the 32nd minute, Suat Serdar accidentally heading the ball into his own net. Benito Raman levelled the scores with a delicate chip over goalkeeper Rafal Gikiewicz on 52 minutes, before a second yellow card for Florian Niederlechner dealt another blow to Augsburg moments later. Serdar then redeemed himself as he fired a low cross towards Nassim Boujellab, who smashed the ball past Gikiewicz to give Schalke the lead. Yet Richter dashed hopes of a first league win since January 17 when he flicked a Michael Gregoritsch cross past Ralf Faehrmann two minutes from time to save a point for 10-man Augsburg. The draw leaves Schalke bottom of the league, with just four points from 11 games this season."
15,21/11/2020,23:11,Haaland scores four as Dortmund cut Bayern's lead,Erling Braut Haaland netted four goals and Youssoufa Moukoko became the youngest player in Bundesliga history on Saturday as Borussia Dortmund routed Hertha Berlin 5-2 to trim Bayern Munich's lead at the top of the table to just a point.,"It was the first time the 20-year-old Haaland had scored four goals in a game for Dortmund since his January debut, with all of them coming in the second half. ""I drank a Red Bull at half time, I got some wings and everything was good,"" said Haaland. The Norwegian now has 10 goals in seven Bundesliga matches this season to give him a total of 31 goals in 30 games in all competitions for Dortmund. After Matheus Cunha gave Hertha a first-half lead at Berlin's Olympic Stadium, Dortmund roared back. Haaland equalised when he tapped home an Emre Can pass on 47 minutes. He grabbed his second two minutes later with perfect timing to slip his marker and fire in a Julian Brandt pass. Haaland wrapped up his hat-trick on 62 minutes, just before Raphael Guerreiro stabbed the ball home from close range to make it 4-1. Cunha converted a late penalty, but the night belonged to Haaland who finished a move he started with 10 minutes to play. There was still time for history to be made as Moukoko made a late cameo off the Dortmund bench to replace Haaland. One day after his 16th birthday, Moukoko is the youngest player in Bundesliga history. ""He's only just turned 16 -- that is amazing,"" Haaland said of Moukoko. ""He has a big career ahead of him."" Dortmund's romp in Berlin moved them second in the standings, behind defending champions Bayern who stayed top despite a 1-1 home draw with Werder Bremen. Germany goalkeeper Manuel Neuer produced great stops to twice deny US forward Josh Sargent as Bremen earned their first point at Bayern for a decade. ""We had to invest a lot,"" Neuer told Sky. The 34-year-old bounced back after conceding six goals in Germany's crushing defeat by Spain in midweek with two brilliant first-half saves in quick succession. He used a boot to block a Sargent shot, then lunged across goal to save from Ludwig Augustinsson. In the dying stages, Neuer then stood tall to block a shot by Sargent, who had broken clear. Bayern coach Hansi Flick was far from pleased that Bremen took the lead in his 50th game in charge, saying his team ""have to defend better"". Bremen deservedly went ahead just before half-time when midfielder Maximilian Eggestein finished off a superb attack. ""We conceded a very cheap goal, that's how Bremen's plan worked and they defended very well,"" said Bayern forward Thomas Mueller. Kingsley Coman equalised in the 62nd minute at the Allianz Arena by meeting a Leon Goretzka cross at the far post. Bayern forward Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting fired over with the goal at his mercy five minutes from time. However, Neuer's heroics at the other end preserved the draw. Bayer Leverkusen are third after their 2-1 win at strugglers Arminia Bielefeld thanks to Aleksandar Dragovic's late winner. The victory was a relief for Leverkusen goalkeeper Lukas Hradecky, who scored a embarrassing own goal early in the second half. Leverkusen were 1-0 up thanks to a Leon Bailey goal when Hradecky sliced a clearance, which rolled into the empty net behind him. Dragovic stabbed home from close range two minutes from time to spare Hradecky's blushes. RB Leipzig sit fourth after Yussuf Poulsen came off the bench and produced a deft second-half volley in their 1-1 draw at Eintracht Frankfurt after winger Aymen Barkok gave the hosts an early lead. Despite having seven players quarantined with the coronavirus, a depleted Hoffenheim drew 3-3 at home with Stuttgart. Schalke's winless run stretched to 24 league games, dating back to January, after losing 2-0 at home to Wolfsburg. A Daniel Caligiuri equaliser two minutes from time gave 10-man Augsburg a 1-1 draw at Borussia Moenchengladbach."
16,12/11/2020,13:30,Hoffenheim confirm eighth Covid case with squad quarantined,"Hoffenheim on Thursday confirmed an eighth case of coronavirus with the squad already quarantined, putting pressure on the Bundesliga club to control the outbreak ahead of their next game in just over a week.","Training is suspended after the squad was quarantined Wednesday with Hoffenheim due to host Stuttgart in their next German league game on November 21. Defender Kevin Vogt was the latest player to test positive for Covid-19 on Wednesday evening, just as midfielder Sebastian Rudy, forward Ishak Belfodil and a staff member earlier had in the morning's testing. The timing is problematic during the international window as several players have joined up with their national squads since being tested. ""Hoffenheim is in close communication with the players who are currently still with their national teams, as well as with the health authorities,"" said sports director Alexander Rosen. Hoffenheim had two cases of the virus confirmed Tuesday when Denmark winger Robert Skov and Israel striker Munas Dabbur tested positive while on national duty and were sent home. Denmark winger Jacob Bruun Larsen and a member of staff were isolated at the weekend after testing positive. As a precaution, goalkeeper Oliver Baumann and left-back Ryan Sessegnon were both sent home from the senior Germany and England Under-21 squads respectively despite negative tests. Croatia striker Andrej Kramaric and Ghana centre-back Kasim Adams tested positive last month after returning from national duty. Pavel Kaderabek was also quarantined after a family member tested positive, but all three players have since returned to training. Hoffenheim hit the headlines in late September when they stunned European champions Bayern Munich, winning 4-1."
17,11/11/2020,17:23,"Hoffenheim squad quarantined after Covid outbreak, Baumann leaves Germany camp","Bundesliga side Hoffenheim on Wednesday put their squad in quarantine after four players tested positive for the coronavirus in the previous 24 hours, while their goalkeeper Oliver Baumann has left the Germany camp as a precaution, the German FA announced.","""We cannot explain the cluster,"" said Hoffenheim sports director Alexander Rosen. ""We have been meticulously and conscientiously adhering to the hygiene concept for months. ""We came through the pandemic without a single positive case for months, which is now hitting us very hard."" German midfielder Sebastian Rudy and Algerian forward Ishak Belfodil, plus a member of their coaching staff, have tested positive for Covid-19, Hoffenheim said Wednesday. It comes after Israeli striker Munas Dabbur and Danish winger Robert Skov tested positive for the virus on Tuesday with their national teams. In total, Hoffenheim has seven cases of the coronavirus after Danish forward Jacob Bruun Larsen and a club member of staff also tested positive in recent days. Hoffenheim goalkeeper Baumann, due to be a replacement for Germany in Wednesday's friendly against the Czech Republic, has twice tested negative with the national team, but the German FA (DFB) sent him home to be quarantined as a ""precautionary measure"". ""Baumann will not be available for the coming internationals,"" the DFB said in a statement with Germany due to play Ukraine in the Nations League on Saturday, then Spain away next Tuesday. His club Hoffenheim is now in close contact with the local health authorities to contain the outbreak. Last week, Hoffenheim played in the Europa League against Czech club Slovan Liberec, who were missing 15 players sidelined by the coronavirus. Due to the current international break, Hoffenheim's next Bundesliga game is scheduled for November 21 at home to Stuttgart. During October's international break, both Croatia striker Andrej Kramaric and Ghana defender Kasim Adams returned from their national teams with the coronavirus. Hoffenheim's Czech right-back Pavel Kaderabek was quarantined after a positive case in his family, but the trio had all since returned to training. Hoffenheim are the second Bundesliga club to go into quarantine after Werder Bremen's squad were briefly kept at home last month following a single positive test."
18,08/11/2020,17:57,Casteels late penalty save seals Wolfsburg win,"Wolfsburg climbed to sixth in the Bundesliga Sunday after goalkeeper Koen Casteels pulled off a late stunning penalty save to help seal a 2-1 home over Hoffenheim, who have struggled since their shock win over Bayern Munich.","Hoffenheim were awarded a penalty in the fourth minute of injury time, but their Israeli striker Munas Dabbur watched helplessly as Casteels pushed away his spot kick attempt. It was the second late penalty which went begging after Wolfsburg's Dutch striker Wout Weghorst fired his spot-kick attempt wide on 84 minutes. Wolfsburg raced into the lead when Swiss winger Renato Steffen scored after just six minutes, although the VAR needed to check whether there was an offside in the build-up. A superb pass by Wolfsburg midfielder Xaver Schlager then split the defence and put Steffen away with the towering Weghorst scoring on 26 minutes. However, the 1.97m-tall Dutchman squandered the chance to put the result beyond doubt when he fired his late penalty attempt wide. Hoffenheim finished the stronger. When Wolfsburg's US defender John Anthony Brooks failed to connect with a clearance header, Hoffenheim's replacement forward Sargis Adamyan smashed his shot into the net three minutes from time. However, Casteels' goalmouth heroics made sure Wolfsburg took the three points. Since shocking Bayern Munich 4-1 in late September left them briefly top of the table, Hoffenheim have now won just three of their eight games to drop to 13th. Bayern opened a two-point gap over second-placed RB Leipzig on Saturday with a 3-2 win at rivals Borussia Dortmund, who dropped to third."
19,17/10/2020,17:59,"Replacements Haaland, Reus combine to send Dortmund second","Substitutes Erling Braut Haaland and Marco Reus fired Borussia Dortmund into second place in the Bundesliga on Saturday, linking up in the second half to seal a 1-0 win at Hoffenheim.","Dortmund, who had already lost one game this season, looked set to drop further points before youngster Haaland and veteran Reus came off the bench in the second half to breathe new life into a blunt performance. Haaland, 20, surged forward on the break to set up Reus with a tap-in and snatch Dortmund's first away victory over Hoffenheim in eight years. Haaland was initially rested after he played three times for Norway in the previous two weeks, prompting criticism of the busy international schedule. Hoffenheim were also without three first team regulars, as Croatia's Andrej Kramaric, Ghana's Kasim Adams and Czech defender Pavel Kaderabek were all sent into quarantine after their return from international duty. The club confirmed on late on Friday that two of three had tested positive for the coronavirus. ""We need to have a conversation about the international schedule. Normally, we are happy to let players go, but these are unusual times,"" Hoffenheim sporting director Alexander Rosen told Sky. Mijat Gacinovic missed a gilt-edged opportunity for Hoffenheim early on, and both Giovanni Reyna and Thomas Meunier came close for Dortmund. Yet it was Reus who landed the decisive blow, slotting Haaland's square pass into the open net to score his first goal since February. Dortmund now sit one point behind league leaders RB Leipzig, who held onto top spot with a 2-0 win against surprise high-fliers Augsburg. Angelino headed Leipzig in front on the stroke of half-time to score his second goal in two games, before Yussuf Poulsen doubled the lead with a sumptuous volley on 66 minutes. Elsewhere, Lucas Alario's first half header sealed a 1-0 win for Bayer Leverkusen and extended second-from-bottom Mainz's miserable run to four defeats in four games. Promoted side Stuttgart continued their good start to the season with a 2-0 win at Hertha Berlin, while Freiburg and Werder Bremen shared the points in an eventful 1-1 draw in the south-west. Marc Oliver Kempf headed in a Daniel Didavi free kick to give Stuttgart an early lead, and Gonzalo Castro fired in the second with a fizzing long-range effort in the second half. Freiburg took the lead early on through Philipp Lienhart and had a second goal ruled out for offside before Bremen's Niclas Fuellkrug levelled the scores from the penalty spot."

22,03/10/2020,17:58,Haaland nets twice as Dortmund run riot,Erling Braut Haaland again demonstrated his deadly finishing by netting twice on Saturday as Borussia Dortmund climbed to second in the Bundesliga table with a 4-0 demolition of Freiburg.,"Dortmund bounced back from last weekend's shock defeat at Augsburg as Haaland shone to leave him on 21 goals in 23 games for Dortmund since his January transfer as the burly Norwegian claimed clinically-taken goals. Having also scored in Wednesday's German Super Cup 3-2 defeat at Bayern Munich, the 20-year-old Haaland has netted five goals in as many games this season. Dortmund were missing England winger Jadon Sancho and goalkeeper Roman Buerki, both recovering from illness having tested negative for the coronavirus. Club captain Marco Reus made his first start for eight months after a groin injury. US teenager Giovanni Reyna, who assisted all three goals, was outstanding alongside Reus in the attacking midfield role for Dortmund. The 17-year-old played Haaland into space for the burly Norwegian to score both his goals, then delivered a pin-point corner for Emre Can's headed goal. Haaland, 19, once again showed dazzling finishing when he fired home from a right angle on 31 minutes. Can then rose highest from a corner and his bullet header put Dortmund 2-0 up two minutes after the break. Reyna and Haaland combined again when they got in behind the defence as the American delayed his pass which the Norwegian hammered into the net on 66 minutes. Winger Felix Passlack claimed his first Bundesliga goal in added time to complete the rout with Haaland providing the final pass. Defending champions Bayern Munich host Hertha Berlin on Sunday out to bounce back from last weekend's shock defeat at Hoffenheim to end their 23-match winning streak. Eintracht Frankfurt top the league table after their 2-1 win over previous leaders Hoffeheim. Croatia striker Andrej Kramaric netted his eighth goal in four games with a superb strike, curled inside the far corner, to give Hoffenheim the lead on 18 minutes. However, Japan midfielder Daichi Kamada turned the game when he tapped home on 54 minutes, then powered through the defence before Bas Dost stabbed the ball over the line on 19 minutes from time. It could have been 3-1 as Frankfurt had a late goal disallowed. Champions League side Moenchenegladbach romped to a 3-1 win at Cologne as Alassane Plea and Stefan Lainer fired home before Lars Stindl added a penalty on 56 minutes. Cologne scored a consolation goal when Elvis Rexhbecaj beat Gladbach keeper Yann Sommer from 20 metres out. Bremen earned a second win in three games when Leonardo Bittencourt's right-footed shot on 27 minutes sealed their 1-0 win at home to new boys Arminia Bielefeld. The hosts survived a late scare as Bielefeld had a goal disallowed just before the whistle. Leverkusen were held to a 1-1 draw at Stuttgart as Patrik Schick's early goal was cancelled out by an equaliser by the hosts' striker Sasa Kalajdzic. On Friday, Union Berlin enjoyed their first win of the season with a 4-0 thumping of Mainz at home as Germany striker Max Kruse scored his first goal for the hosts."

""It was a really good start to the season. We have a lot of young guys, it's fun to play with guys near my age,"" said USA Under-17 international Reyna. ""This is an exciting group and we have to keep working."" Haaland converted a second-half penalty, then again showcased his clinical eye for goal by finishing a superb counter as Dortmund attacked from their own goal. Coach Lucien Favre banked on youth by starting two 17-year-olds in Reyna and England Under-21 midfielder Jude Bellingham, who made his league debut, with Sancho and Haaland, both 20, leading Dortmund's attack. Reyna, making just his third league start, paid back the faith by scoring the opening goal and winning the penalty Haaland converted. Reyna drilled home Bellingham's superb pass from a tight ankle on 34 minutes, then had his ankle clipped after a darting run into the area to win the penalty for Haaland. Sancho tried to convince Haaland to let him take the spot-kick, but ""I was confident whoever took it, would score, which is the most important thing"" said Reyna. Haaland then stole the show with a stunning end-to-end sprint to support Sancho's break before crashing home Dortmund's third goal on 78 minutes. The towering Norwegian, the first player in Bundesliga history to score a hat-trick from the bench, now has 18 goals in 20 games for Dortmund since his arrival in January. For the first time since March, some German league clubs were able to welcome back limited numbers of fans, depending on permission from local health authorities. The biggest crowd of the day was in Dortmund, as 9,300 cheered the impressive home win. ""It's amazing to have fans back, they support us so much,"" added Reyna. Having finished runners-up to Bayern for the last two seasons, Dortmund are on a collision course with the European champions who they meet in the German Super Cup showdown on September 30 in Munich. Earlier, Hertha Berlin's new-signing Jhon Cordoba scored on his debut in a 4-1 away romp at Werder Bremen as the ambitious capital city club also threw down an early marker. In front of 8,500 in Bremen, Hertha defender Peter Pekarik and Belgian-born winger Dodi Lukebakio scored quick-fire goals at the end of the first half to leave Werder 2-0 down at the break and the hosts were whistled off the pitch by their own fans. Colombia striker Cordoba, signed from Cologne in mid-week, came on to start the move which Brazil Under-23 forward Matheus Cunha finished as Hertha went 3-0 up with an hour gone. Davie Selke scored Bremen's second-half consolation goal before Cordoba capped his debut by tucking home Hertha's fourth goal on 90 minutes. Just like Bayern, Cologne also had to play behind closed doors due to a rising rate of infection for their 3-2 home defeat to Hoffenheim, for whom Andrej Kramaric scored a hat-trick. The Croatia striker put the visitors ahead after three minutes following a mix up in defence, netted a penalty and smashed home the winning goal in added time after Cologne had launched a late fight back. In the capital, playmaker Michael Gregoritsch and winger Andre Hahn scored late goals as Augsburg beat hosts Union Berlin 3-1 in front of 4,600 fans. Newly-promoted Arminia Bielefeld earned a point with a 1-1 draw at Eintracht Frankfurt on their return to the top flight in front of 6,500. Stuttgart, who also came up, gave Freiburg a scare with late goals by Sasa Kalajdzic and Silas Wamangituka as they fought back in a 3-2 defeat in front of 8,000."

Sebastian Hoeness led Bayern's reserves to an unexpected third division title this season. ""Sebastian has impressively proved that he can train young players into a powerful unit and develop them individually. He chose an offensive approach that was not only attractive but also extraordinarily successful,"" Hoffenheim sports director Alexander Rosen said in a statement. Hoeness succeeds Dutchman Alfred Schreuder, who was sacked in June after a series of poor performances for the club owned by billionaire Dietmar Hopp. Under a six-man interim coaching staff, Hoffenheim won their last three games to grab sixth place and a place in the Europa League. Hoeness, who played three games for Hoffenheim when the club was still in the third division, will begin working with the squad when they start pre-season training on August 2. ""Working at Hoffenheim is a great challenge, which I look forward to. The basic philosophy of the club is the same as my idea of football: offensive, courageous, flexible and always active,"" said the new coach, who is bringing in another Bayern coach David Krecidlo as his assistant."

Florian Kohfeldt's Werder will face second-tier opponents in either Heidenheim or possibly neighbours, rivals and fellow fallen giants Hamburg in the play-off first leg on Thursday. Bremen have spent more seasons than any other team in the Bundesliga, having only spent one term in the second tier, in 1980-81. A burst of goals from Osako, Milot Rashica and Niclas Fuellkrug -- all in the space of eight minutes -- had Werder 3-0 up at the break against Cologne at the Weserstadion. Former Everton midfielder Davy Klaassen then fired home a rebound just after the break before Osako, facing his old side, added his second and USA international Josh Sargent completed the rout. Dominick Drexler pulled a goal back for Cologne. Werder, the four-time Bundesliga champions, also needed a favour from Berlin and got one as Union beat Fortuna 3-0 with goals from Nigerian duo Anthony Ujah and Suleiman Abdullahi either side of veteran midfielder Christian Gentner's effort. Bremen will find out their play-off opponents on Sunday, with Heidenheim currently in the play-off place ahead of the final round of matches in the second division. At Wolfsburg, Bayern striker Robert Lewandowski scored a penalty for his 34th league goal of the season, finishing as the top scorer for the fifth time. Kingsley Coman, Michael Cuisance and Thomas Mueller also got on the scoresheet as Bayern, champions for the eighth straight season, finished 13 points clear of second-placed Borussia Dortmund. Mueller set up Coman for Bayern's opening goal to finish the campaign with a league record 21 assists, and his goal that rounded out the win was also Bayern's 100th league goal this season -- one short of the Bundesliga record. Wolfsburg captain Josuha Guilavogui was sent off for a second yellow card after fouling Cuisance, leading to Lewandowski's penalty. Meanwhile, Borussia Moenchengladbach and RB Leipzig secured qualification for next season's Champions League after 2-1 wins over Hertha Berlin and Augsburg respectively, as fifth-placed Bayer Leverkusen missed out by two points despite beating Mainz 1-0. Dortmund, who had already wrapped up second place, crashed to a 4-0 home defeat by Hoffenheim, for whom Croatia striker Andrej Kramaric scored all four goals, including one penalty. That result allowed Hoffenheim to leapfrog Wolfsburg and take sixth place, although both sides will go into the Europa League next season along with Leverkusen. Before kick-off in Dortmund, Mario Goetze, whose winning goal sealed Germany's victory in the 2014 World Cup final, was given a send-off by the club. He will leave this summer with his contract having expired, but the 28-year-old attacking midfielder has not announced his future club. Elsewhere, Timo Werner signed off with a brace in RB Leipzig's 2-1 win at Augsburg in what was his final appearance for the club before moving to Chelsea. Schalke's disastrous second half of the season was completed with a 4-0 thrashing at the hands of Freiburg as they finished the season 12th, having been third in December. Eintracht Frankfurt beat bottom side Paderborn 3-2 in Saturday's other game."
26,12/06/2020,22:38,Olmo double keeps Leipzig on Champions League path,Two goals in two minutes from Dani Olmo gave RB Leipzig a 2-0 win at Hoffenheim on Friday to allow them to close within a point of second-placed Borussia Dortmund in the German Bundesliga.,"Leipzig now have 62 points with three games left although Dortmund, still hopeful of chasing down Bayern Munich for the title, have a game in hand. They face Fortuna Duesseldorf on Saturday. Leipzig remain comfortably on course for a return to the Champions League, having already made the quarter-finals this season, with a six-point cushion over closest pursuers Borussia Moenchengladbach and Bayer Leverkusen who play at the weekend. Spanish midfielder Olmo found the net after nine and 11 minutes while substitute Christopher Nkunku was close to a third in stoppage time when a shot came off the post."
27,09/06/2020,18:36,Coach Schreuder leaves Hoffenhiem due to 'different opinions',Hoffenheim said on Tuesday they had parted company with coach Alfred Schreuder because of differing perspectives with the club two points away from the Europa League places.,"Schreuder, 47, joined the Bundesliga outfit last year from Ajax to succeed RB Leipzig-bound Julian Nagelsmann, and his contract was set to run until 2022. ""We had different opinions on important detailed questions, so that working together beyond the end of the season no longer makes sense,"" Hoffenheim's director of football Alexander Rosen said. The Dutchman's side had lost just once in five games since the Bundesliga returned from its coronavirus-enforced break. ""Unfortunately, we were unable to agree on a common way of how we want to lead Hoffenheim into the future. I regret this development,"" Schreuder said. ""It is not uncommon in professional life to have different opinions. You then have to be honest with each other and draw the appropriate consequences,"" he added. Various coaching staff members including Rosen will take over the role ahead of hosting third-placed Leipzig on Friday. Schreuder's brother and assistant, Dick, will also leave the club."
28,06/06/2020,17:42,Lewandowski scores 30th Bundesliga goal of season as Bayern close on title,Robert Lewandowski scored his 30th league goal of the season on Saturday as Bayern Munich came from behind to claim a 4-2 victory at Bayer Leverkusen and move a step closer to the Bundesliga title.,"After Lucas Alario secured an early lead for the home side, Bayern struck twice in quick succession just before half-time to turn the game in their favour after Kingsley Coman's equaliser. Lewandowski netted in the second half as Bayern established a 10-point lead over title rivals Borussia Dortmund, who host Hertha Berlin later on Saturday. The game also saw Bayern lend their support to protests over the death of black American man George Floyd, with all their players wearing armbands bearing the slogan ""Black Lives Matter"". With their talisman and Bayern transfer target Kai Havertz ruled out with a muscle injury, Leverkusen turned to Alario to lead the line against the champions. The Argentine delivered after just nine minutes, beating the offside trap after a throw-in to slot the ball past Manuel Neuer. A mistake from Moussa Diaby allowed Coman to curl in the equaliser, before a fizzing shot from Leon Goretzka and an elegant lob from Serge Gnabry saw Bayern take a two-goal lead before half-time. Lewandowski finished the job with a well-placed header after the break, reaching the 30-goal mark for only the second time in his Bundesliga career, but there was still time for 17-year-old Florian Wirtz to curl in a consolation goal for Leverkusen before the final whistle. Elsewhere, a late equaliser from Christian Strohdiek gave bottom-of-the-table Paderborn a faint glimmer of hope in the race for survival, as they snatched a 1-1 draw away to RB Leipzig. Chelsea-bound Leipzig striker Timo Werner set up Patrik Schick on 27 minutes to give Leipzig the lead, but they were forced to defend it with 10 men after Dayot Upamecano was booked twice in the first half. Strohdiek's last-minute strike gave Paderborn their fourth draw in five games, though Steffen Baumgart's side remain eight points off Fortuna Duesseldorf who occupy the relegation play-off place. Duesseldorf themselves missed the chance to move towards safety, as they battled to a dramatic 2-2 draw against 10-man Hoffenheim. A headed opener from Rouwen Hennings and a red card for Hoffenheim's Benjamin Huebner put the home side in pole position, but the visitors struck back with goals from Munas Dabbur and Steven Zuber before Hennings saved a point with a late penalty. Uwe Roesler's side remain three points adrift of survival, after goals from Moussa Niakhate and Pierre Kunde Malong gave fellow strugglers Mainz a rare 2-0 win over local rivals Eintracht Frankfurt."
29,30/05/2020,21:10,Lewandowski hits brace as Bayern Munich go 10 points clear,Bayern Munich opened a 10-point lead at the top of the Bundesliga on Saturday with a 5-0 drubbing of relegation-threatened Fortuna Dusseldorf behind closed doors with the league's top-scorer Robert Lewandowski scoring twice.,"Duesseldorf defender Mathias Joergensen scored an early own goal before Benjamin Pavard, Lewandowski (2) and Alphonso Davies hit the target. With five games left, Bayern, who have won their last eight league games, are comfortably on course for an eighth straight league title. However, second-placed Borussia Dortmund could trim their lead on Sunday at bottom side Paderborn. Several records fell as Lewandowski now has 43 goals in all competitions, a season's best for the Poland striker with games in hand. Also head coach Hansi Flick claimed his 22nd win in his first 25 games, bettering the start made by Pep Guardiola when he took charge in 2013. ""Statistics and records don't interest me, what's important is to have a successful season,"" said Flick, in his first season since replacing Niko Kovac in November. ""At Bayern Munich, you are expected to win. I am very happy, we were very aggressive and didn't give them any chances."" Lewandowski, who had never previously scored in six games against Duesseldorf, made amends with goals either side of half-time. Fortuna, who were unbeaten in their three games since the league resumed after a two-month coronavirus-enforced hiatus, were humbled at the Allianz Arena where they last poached a 3-3 draw in November 2018. They fell behind on 15 minutes when Joergensen turned the ball into his own net after Pavard mishit his shot. Right-back Pavard then grabbed the second with a powerful header on 29 minutes before Lewandowski made it 3-0 just before the break after being presented with a tap-in by Thomas Mueller. Duesseldorf were floored with two goals in as many minutes as Lewandowski profited again with another poacher's goal after Serge Gnabry's good work. Davies then scored the game's best goal. After some high pressing, the Canadian teen won the ball in the Duesseldorf area, barged past a succession of defenders and fired home to make it 5-0 on 52 minutes. Werder Bremen boosted their survival hopes with a 1-0 win at Schalke, who are winless in 11 games and continue to plummet. Midfielder Leonardo Bittencourt scored a first-half winner. ""This is a very, very important away win,"" said Bremen coach Florian Kohfeldt. ""We have taken seven points from the last three games, but if you look at the table, we are still behind."" Bremen have spent more seasons in the Bundesliga than any other club, but currently sit second from bottom. However, Saturday's victory leaves them just three points from guaranteed safety with six games left. They are two points behind Duesseldorf in 16th, which carries a relegation play-off at the end of the season. Werder could climb out of the relegation places for the first time since December on Wednesday if they beat Eintracht Frankfurt at home. Bittencourt hit a stunning strike from just outside the box which beat Schalke's Bayern-bound goalkeeper Alexander Nuebel on 32 minutes. Schalke succumbed to their fourth straight defeat, piling pressure on head coach David Wagner. In the same game, Schalke's American midfielder Weston McKennie wore a 'Justice for George' armband as part of the growing protests over the death of an unarmed black man during a police arrest in the United States. ""To be able to use my platform to bring attention to a problem that has been going on too long feels good!!!,"" tweeted 21-year-old McKennie. ""We have to stand up for what we believe in and I believe that it is time that we are heard."" George Floyd died in Minneapolis in an arrest by a police officer who pinned him to the ground for several minutes by kneeling on his neck. Hertha remain unbeaten with three wins and a draw since Bruno Labbadia took charge during the lockdown after their 2-0 win at home to Augsburg thanks for goals by Javairo Dilrosun and Krzysztof Piatek. Having routed Leverkusen 4-1 away on Tuesday, Wolfsburg crashed to a 2-1 defeat at home to 10-man Eintracht Frankfurt. Japan midfielder Daichi Kamada scored the winner 10 minutes from time while Frankfurt had replacement midfielder Lucas Torro sent off in the dying stages for a second yellow card. Frankfurt took the lead when striker Andre Silva converted a penalty on 27 minutes, but Wolfsburg equalised when right-back Kevin Mbabu headed home on 58 minutes. Hoffenheim are seventh after their 1-0 win at Mainz thanks to Ihlas Bebou who darted into the area, swept past two defenders, and fired home on 43 minutes. On Friday, Leverkusen went third when Germany midfielder Kai Havertz became the first player in Bundesliga history to score 35 goals before his 21st birthday to seal a 1-0 win at Freiburg."

31,20/03/2020,12:46,German billionaire Hopp - football villain or virus hero?,"Long despised by German fans as the face of big-money football, billionaire Dietmar Hopp is now being held up by some as a national hero in the coronavirus crisis.","Three weeks ago, the 79-year-old owner of the Hoffenheim club was the subject of nationwide protests in Germany's football stadiums, with fans calling him a ""son of a b***h"" and holding up pictures of his face in crosshairs. This week, Hopp raised hopes of a vaccine for the COVID-19 disease, suggesting a company he owns could develop one as soon as the autumn. Ranked by Forbes as the eighth richest person in Germany, Hopp made his fortune with SAP, the software company he co-founded in 1972. Decades later, he used his wealth to propel Hoffenheim, based near Sinsheim in southwestern Germany, from amateur league anonymity to the top-flight Bundesliga and a place among Europe's elite in the Champions League. That made him a hate figure for football fans across the country. For Germany's ""ultras"", Hopp is a symbol for how wealthy investors hold too much power in football. They see him as a threat to the culture and traditions of the German game, and more specifically to the 50+1 rule, which underpins the considerable influence of supporters in the way German clubs are run. Hopp has also riled fans by taking legal action over insulting chants sung about him by away supporters. A decision by the German Football Association to ban Borussia Dortmund fans from Hoffenheim for two years prompted a flood of protests last month, with fans across the country accusing football authorities of pandering to Hopp's personal wishes. Supporters of clubs such as Bayern Munich, Borussia Moenchengladbach and Union Berlin held up banners insulting Hopp and the DFB, leading in some cases to games being suspended. Three weeks on, the Bundesliga has been suspended due to the coronavirus crisis, but Hopp remains firmly in the headlines. He is now being heralded as a hero in some quarters, after it emerged that one of his companies, biotech firm CureVac, is working on a vaccine for COVID-19. ""We need to do tests on animals first, and then humans. But I think it should be available by the autumn, and that's when the next wave of infections might come,"" Hopp told Sport1 website on Tuesday. CureVac's research, meanwhile, was at the centre of a diplomatic row last weekend. According to a report in Welt newspaper on Sunday, US President Donald Trump offered the company up to a billion dollars to secure exclusive rights to the vaccine research for the United States. CureVac denied the report, while Hopp said such a deal ""would not be an option"". ""It's obvious for me that it can't be the case that a German company develops a vaccine which is then used exclusively in the US,"" he told Sport1. The firm response earned him praise both in the media and among leading German politicians. Football fans, though, remain largely unmoved by Hopp's comments on the vaccine, which he says should be for ""people across the world"". ""It's very nice that a successful businessman is recognising his social responsibility and acting accordingly, but that has nothing to do with his involvement in football,"" said Sig Zelt, a spokesman for the organisation ""Pro-Fans"", on Wednesday. They may be more impressed by his promises to support smaller clubs which face financial problems due to the suspended football season. While Borussia Dortmund CEO Hans-Joachim Watzke controversially ruled out financial aid this week, Hopp took the opposite position, calling for a ""solidarity fund"" for smaller clubs. ""The strong must help the weak,"" he said."
32,06/03/2020,03:35,Irate fans could provide more Bundesliga banner headlines,When Hoffenheim kick off at Schalke in the Bundesliga on Saturday many eyes will be on the fans behind the goals rather than the players on the field.,"Last week, away to Hoffenheim, Bayern fans unveiled a banner with 17 minutes to go which halted the match. When the players returned, they played keep-ball for the rest of the game, which hardly mattered as league leaders Bayern were six goals up. The key word in the banner was the German for ""son of a bitch"" which has become a code for Dietmar Hopp, Hoffenheim's 79-year-old billionaire owner. The majority of Bundesliga clubs are, in theory, fan owned and supporters are hostile to the rich owners who have transformed English, French and Italian football. Bayern fans were showing support for the ultras at their great rival Borussia Dortmund, who used the inflammatory phrase to describe Hopp and were then banned by the German football federation (DFB) from travelling to games away at Hoffenheim. Banners insulting Hopp and criticising the DFB for attacking terrace culture were also unveiled by Cologne and Union Berlin fans. The latter led to their game against Wolfsburg being interrupted. The previous week, the match between Borussia Moenchengladach and Hoffenheim was halted when home fans unveiled a banner showing Hopp in rifle crosshairs. On Wednesday, when Schalke hosted Bayern in the German Cup, home fans unfurled a banner asking their opponents if they tried the same insult ""will you stop playing so we'll get a penalty shootout?"" Bayern won 1-0. Fans of second-division Bochum, a neighbour of both Schalke and Dortmund, moved the debate in a fresh direction in their draw with Sandhausen. After Arsenal loanee Jordi Osei-Tuti scored they revealed a banner that said: ""A son of a bitch is insulted: all of Germany is shocked - Racism on a daily basis: nothing happens."" In February, Hertha's Jordan Torunarigha was sent off after throwing bottles in rage after being racially abused in a German cup game, at Schalke. On its website, explaining to Hoffenheim fans, who have chanted their support for their owner with often robust language, how to get to Veltins Arena, Schalke made clear banners would be allowed. ""Fans do not require permission to bring flags with a pole that is up to two metres in length or fence banners."" Schalke are enduring another season of unfulfilled promised, mired in sixth but already 10 points off the Champions League places. Hoffenheim are two points and two places further back, heights that would have been unthinkable 15 years ago. Many will be anticipating the banners more than the mid-table action. Borussia Dortmund have won four games in a row while conceding just one goal - scored by Neymar. They warm up for the return against Paris Saint-Germain with a potentially pivotal visit to Moenchengladbach. Dortmund are third in the Bundesliga and 'Gladbach are just behind in fourth. Last weekend, with one teenage sensation, Erling Braut Haaland, ill and on the bench against Freiburg, Jadon Sancho hit the only goal, scoring for the seventh straight home game and the 11th time in 13 games. At a club which only lists two strikers - Haaland and Marco Reus - the contribution of the English winger, who is Dortmund's league leader in goals and assists (14 in both), remains crucial. 8 - Bayern's unbeaten run, including 7 wins, since the winter break 6 - Goals Bayern scored in 73 minutes in their first game without Robert Lewandowski 22 - Goals Augsburg, Bayern's opponents, have conceded in last eight games"
33,20/12/2019,22:56,Late Hoffenheim comeback condemns Dortmund to defeat,Sergis Adamyan and Andrej Kramaric scored late goals as Hoffenheim fought back for a 2-1 win to stop Borussia Dortmund from moving within a point of Bundesliga leaders RB Leipzig on Friday.,"Adamyan and Kramaric responded following the break after Mario Goetze, who was making his first start in over a month, opened the scoring in the first half. Dortmund remain in fourth, four points behind Leipzig and second-placed Borussia Moenchengladbach, while Hoffenheim jump to sixth with the German top flight heading into a month-long winter break after this weekend. ""I'm not going to die from this game now. But every defeat hurts,"" Dortmund's Julian Brandt told broadcaster ZDF. ""If you have as many chances as that in the second half, it's hard to digest,"" he added. With club captain Marco Reus ruled out until January with a muscular problem Dortmund coach Lucien Favre named Goetze in attack. The hosts made four changes from the midweek victory at Union Berlin, a first win in five games, as Norway's Havard Nordtveit made his first start for the club in more than a year at centre-back. Dortmund led after 16 minutes of play as Achraf Hakimi found acres of space down the right wing. The Morocco wing-back, on loan from Real Madrid, pulled back a low cross into the box and Goetze tapped home from short range despite Sebastian Rudy's goal-line efforts. With six minutes left of the half Thorgan Hazard was denied a chance to double Dortmund's lead following a superb Oliver Baumann save. Despite Dortmund dominating the game and having 10 shots on goal, Hoffenheim were level with 11 minutes to play. Manuel Akanji made a messy attempt at a clearance and Armenia winger Adamyan equalised. The unexpected comeback was complete when Kramaric beat Roman Buerki with a spinning header four minutes from time. On Saturday, Leipzig host Augsburg and third-placed Bayern welcome Wolfsburg, before Gladbach head to a rejuvenated Hertha Berlin."
34,24/11/2019,23:08,Hoffenheim waste chance to go fourth after Mainz hammering,"Hoffenheim missed out on an opportunity to move into the Bundesliga's top four on Sunday, suffering a heavy 5-1 home defeat by a Mainz side playing under newly appointed coach Achim Beierlorzer.","The hosts failed to win for the first time in five games as the visitors moved out of the relegation zone to 13th spot with only their third victory of the campaign. Beierlorzer, who was sacked by struggling Cologne nine days before taking over at the Opel Arena on November 18, started his reign successfully despite Ridle Baku's first-half red card as Cameroon midfielder Pierre Kunde Malong scored twice to open his account for the season. Levin Oeztunali claimed the first goal of proceedings on 33 minutes before his midfield partner Baku was dismissed seconds before the break for a studs-up challenge on the home side's Sebastian Rudy. Mainz continued to attack in the second half, peppering the Hoffenheim box until an own goal from Pavel Kaderabek in the 52nd minute doubled their lead. Kunde tapped in for his first of the season 10 minutes later before Andrej Kramaric claimed a consolation effort for the home side in the 83rd minute. Jean-Paul Boetius snuffed out any chance of a comeback in the 90th minute, however, scoring on the break to make it 4-1 and Kunde added his second two minutes later to complete the rout. Mainz coach Beierlorzer praised sacked former boss Sandro Schwarz, dedicating the victory to him. ""It was an amazing achievement,"" Beierlorzer said. ""Sandro deserves a very, very large share of it. It's guaranteed that the team fought for him today and brought home the victory."" Earlier on Sunday, goalkeeper Rune Jarstein was sent off as Hertha Berlin continued to stutter, losing 4-0 at Augsburg. Hertha lost a fifth straight game and slid below Augsburg after Philipp Max, Sergio Cordova, Andre Hahn and Florian Niederlechner scored for the hosts. Hertha are just a point above the relegation zone. Left-back Max opened the scoring for the Bavarians in the 18th minute with a free-kick but the turning point came 10 minutes later. Jarstein earned a red card with a studs-up challenge on Niederlechner. Cordova claimed the home side's second in the process. Substitute Hahn added a third in the 52nd minute with a superb curling strike from the edge of the box. Niederlechner bagged his side's fourth in the 79th minute. ""The disappointment is understandably big, we have to digest that first,"" said Hertha captain Niklas Stark. ""There were so many things we did which you just can't do while playing away in the Bundesliga. ""We simply have to do better."" Earlier on Sunday, Borussia Dortmund's squad were booed and jeered when they appeared at the side's annual general meeting, with fans screaming ""shame on you"". Coach Lucien Favre is under pressure as Dortmund, expected to challenge for the title after an ambitious close-season recruitment drive, languish in sixth after a draw to lowly Paderborn on Friday. On Saturday, managerless Bayern Munich closed the gap at the top of the table to just a point with a 4-0 romp at Fortuna Duesseldorf as leaders Borussia Moenchengladbach suffered a shock 2-0 loss at Union Berlin."
35,09/11/2019,15:07,Struggling Cologne sack coach and sports director,Bundesliga strugglers Cologne have sacked both sports director Armin Veh and head coach Achim Beierlorzer following their eighth league defeat in 11 games.,"Sports director Veh was dismissed immediately after the final whistle of Friday's 2-1 defeat, thanks to a late penalty at home to Hoffenheim, which left Cologne second from bottom. Then coach Beierlorzer, who had only been in charge for 132 days, was shown the door on Saturday. ""I regret that we are forced to take this step. However, the hoped-for success has failed to materialise and it's our task to ensure that FC (Cologne) achieves its goals,"" said club official Frank Aehlig. Veh, who coached Stuttgart to the 2007 Bundesliga title, was due to leave next May, but was sacked after Hoffenheim converted a penalty in the eighth minute of injury time to seal Friday's result. With Veh gone, it fell to Aehling, a senior member of the backroom staff, to cancel Saturday's training session and speak to the players after confirming Beierlorzer's departure. Caretaker coaches have been appointed to prepare for their next game against high-flying RB Leipzig in a fortnight. Cologne are working on ""finding a new head coach"" who will ""make a new start with our team"" to try to lift them in the table, added Aehlig. After the club secured promotion last season, Beierlorzer took charge in July, but was sacked after just five months. He is the second Bundesliga head coach fired this week after defending champions Bayern Munich dismissed Niko Kovac."
36,08/11/2019,22:41,Locadia's late penalty sends Hoffenheim second in Bundesliga,Hoffenheim moved to second place in the Bundesliga on Friday as they beat Cologne 2-1 for a club record sixth straight victory in all competitions thanks to Juergen Locadia's injury time penalty.,Jhon Cordoba opened the scoring for the hosts before Sargis Adamyan and Locadia's second half efforts lifted Alfred Schreuder two points below leaders Borussia Moenchengladbach. Schreuder made one change from last weekend's victory over Paderborn with Stefan Posch taking Kevin Akpoguma's place in defence. Achim Beierlorzer's outfit remain in 17th spot with only two wins all season despite handing attacker Cordoba just his second league start of the season. Colombian Cordoba repaid the faith shown in him by the Billy Goats' coach Beierlorzer to claim his second goal in three appearances. Attacking midfielder Louis Schaub laid-off to Cordoba at the edge of the box and the 26-year-old struck home. In-form Hoffenheim responded three minutes into the second-half. Defensive midfielder Sebastian Rudy chipped the ball to the path of Adamyan inside the penalty area and the Armenia winger side-footed on the volley to equalise. Hoffenheim's winner came after seven minutes of additional time as Dutch youth international Locadia scored his third goal of the season with a penalty after referee Robert Kampa had checked the decision with VAR. Saturday's action sees managerless Bayern Munich host Borussia Dortmund in the champions first league game since Niko Kovac was sacked last weekend's 5-1 drubbing at Eintracht Frankfurt. League leaders Moenchegladbach welcome Werder Bremen on Sunday with French forward Marcus Thuram looking to score for a fifth straight match after netting an injury-tme winner in the Europa League against Roma midweek.
37,20/10/2019,20:36,Schalke blow chance to top Bundesliga as Kramaric strikes on return,Schalke blew their chance to move to the top of the Bundesliga on Sunday as Andrej Kramaric scored on his first appearance of the season in Hoffenheim's 2-0 victory.,"David Wagner's side would have moved above the likes of champions Bayern Munich and leaders Borussia Moenchengladbach with three points at the PreZero Arena. Schalke's influential young midfielders Suat Serdar and Weston McKennie, who scored the United States' quickest ever hat-trick earlier this month, missed the match with injuries. Croatia's Kramaric, who was a World Cup runner-up last year, opened the scoring in the 72nd minute having missed the start of the campaign with a knee injury. ""It was a special moment after five months to play again, to take the first steps in the field and then score a goal, that's an absolutely incredible feeling,"" Kramaric told Hoffenheim's website. ""I have to be honest, Schalke were the better team, but we still managed to win,"" he added. Togo international Ihlas Bebou made sure of the win with five minutes remaining. Hoffenheim followed up their 2-1 victory over Bayern before the international window to go level on 11 points with Hertha Berlin in 11th place. Kramaric's effort came after substitute Bebou's shot was parried poorly by the hosts' goalkeeper Alexander Nubel. Bebou then beat Nubel at his near-post to claim his second goal of the season. Earlier on Sunday Cologne moved out of the relegation places with a 3-0 defeat of bottom-placed Paderborn. Simon Terodde netted after nine minutes before Louis Schaub and Sebastiaan Bornauw helped Cologne to their first home three points of the campaign. Paderborn remain last with only one point from their first eight games of the season. On Saturday, leaders Moenchengladbach lost 1-0 to Borussia Dortmund, who dropped England's Jadon Sancho for returning late from international duty, and Bayern drew 2-2 at Augsburg."
38,05/10/2019,17:54,Bayern Munich crash to first defeat of the season,"Five days after thrashing Tottenham in Europe, Bayern Munich suffered their first loss this season with a shock 2-1 home defeat by Hoffenheim in the Bundesliga on Saturday.","Second-half goals by Armenian forward Sargis Adamyan sealed Hoffenheim's first-ever win in Munich as Bayern suffered a Champions League hangover after their 7-2 romp at Tottenham on Tuesday. It was Bayern's first home defeat in the league for almost a year. Robert Lewandowski equalised at the Allianz Arena with his 11th Bundesliga goal this season, scoring for the seventh straight league game, but Adamyan clinched the win with his second. Bayern kept first place in the Bundesliga on goal difference ahead of Leipzig, Leverkusen and Freiburg, with four teams on 14 points at the top. Schalke can take over as shock leaders if they beat strugglers Cologne later on Saturday. Borussia Moenchengladbach could also go top by beating mid-table Augsburg on Sunday."
39,28/09/2019,21:00,Lewandowski hailed for 'extreme goals quota' as Bayern go top,"Record-breaking Bayern Munich striker Robert Lewandowski was hailed for his ""extreme quota of goals"" on Saturday as the defending German champions warmed up for their European duel against Tottenham with a nervy win at strugglers Paderborn which took them to the top of the Bundesliga.","Lewandowski became the first player in Bundesliga history to score 10 goals in the first six games to seala 3-2 victory at bottom club Paderborn. While Bayern squeezed past Paderborn, Leipzig were shocked 3-1 at home to Schalke to surrender top spot. Bayern took full advantage to claim first place before Tuesday's key Champions League clash at Spurs, but not before conceding two second-half goals. Philippe Coutinho, who is rebooting his career on loan in Munich after an unhappy stint at Barcelona, played a key role by setting up Serge Gnabry's opening goal with a sublime first-half pass. Having scored his first Bayern goal the week before in a rout of Cologne, the Brazilian playmaker tapped home Gnabry's neat pass after the break before substitute Kai Proeger pulled a goal back for Paderborn. With time almost up, Lewandowski showed great finishing prowess to put away a Niklas Suele pass and make it 3-1, becoming the first Bayern player to score in each of the first six matches of the season. He is also the first Bundesliga player to reach 10 goals after the first six games. ""It's an extreme quota, which helps when they decide games like that,"" said midfielder Joshua Kimmich of Lewandowski's goal haul. ""To have ten already is something else."" There were, however, nervous looks in Bayern's ranks during the final ten minutes after Paderborn defender Jamilu Collins beat Germany goalkeeper Manuel Neuer from 30 metres out. ""We didn't finish them off,"" admitted Gnabry. ""In the second half, we had so many goal opportunities to decide the game, but our finishing was missing. ""Tottenham will be a completely different game and, of course, we must improve, but I think we can do well there."" In Leipzig, Morocco international midfielder Amine Harit inspired Schalke to an impressive away win, winning and drilling home a penalty, then setting up a first Bundesliga goal for Welsh teenager Rabbi Matondo. The Royal Blues raced into a 2-0 lead with first-half goals as Senegalese centre-back Salif Sane headed home from a corner on 29 minutes before Harit's penalty. The referee took a long look at the replays after Harit went down after the faintest of contact from Mali defender Amadou Haidara. Schalke, under ex-Huddersfield coach David Wagner, made sure of the three points when Matondo claimed his first Bundesliga goal since joining from Manchester City. Harit again did the damage, punishing a mistake in midfield then putting in a well-timed pass which sent Liverpool-born Matondo away to fire home on 58 minutes. Emil Forsberg's consolation goal came too late for Leipzig. The shock result shook up the table with Bayern now top, Leipzig drop to second and Schalke jumped from fifth to third. Questions about Borussia Dortmund's mentality will again be raised after more defensive lapses in their 2-2 draw at home to Werder Bremen left them seventh. Milot Rashica gave Bremen an early lead at Signal Iduna Park, but Germany pair Mario Goetze and Marco Reus both scored with headers to put Dortmund 2-1 up at half-time. However, Werder claimed a point when Marco Friedl poked the ball home ten minutes into the second half. The disappointing draw comes after Dortmund skipper Reus was left fuming after his side leaked a late own goal in last Sunday's 2-2 at mid-table Eintracht Frankfurt. ""We should have had a third goal and conceding their final goal really hurts. We didn't play well,"" said Reus after the Bremen defeat. Borussia Moenchengladbach went fourth as goals from French strikers Alassane Plea and Marcus Thuram sealed a 2-0 victory at Hoffenheim. Bayer Leverkusen are just behind them in fifth thanks to late goals from forwards Kevin Volland and Kai Havertz that added to a Florian Niederlechner's first half own goal in a 3-0 win at Augsburg."
40,15/09/2019,17:51,Freiburg crush Hoffenheim to leapfrog Bayern,"Freiburg midfielder Janik Haberer hailed a ""great day"" for the Bundesliga minnows as they beat neighbours Hoffenheim 3-0 to continue their dream start to the season.","""It is a great day for us and our fans, it is always special to win a derby,"" said Haberer, who joined Nils Petersen and Christian Guenter on the scoresheet as Freiburg crushed Hoffenheim. The win leaves Freiburg in third and sees them leapfrog perennial champions Bayern Munich, who were held to a 1-1 draw at league leaders RB Leipzig on Saturday. Christian Streich's side have now won three of their opening four games, with only Bayern and Borussia Dortmund having scored more goals so far. ""Our primary goal is still just to avoid relegation, but it is a great feeling to be so high up the table,"" Haberer told Sky. Freiburg were ruthless in the first half and deserved their two-goal lead at the break. Guenter swept in the opener after a darting run in from the left wing on 11 minutes, and Petersen had a goal ruled out for offside shortly before the half hour mark. Haberer doubled the lead on 38 minutes, picking out the bottom corner brilliantly from the edge of the area. Hoffenheim, who had shown only flashes of danger in the first half, were caught napping when an unmarked Petersen poached the third goal on the hour mark. In Saturday's later game, promoted side Paderborn look to pick up their first win of the season when they host David Wagner's Schalke."
41,31/08/2019,19:14,Perisic opens Bayern account in Mainz thrashing,Bayern Munich new boy Ivan Perisic bagged his first goal for the Bundesliga champions as they romped to a 6-1 win over a hapless Mainz at the Allianz Arena on Saturday.,"Bayern showcased their attacking brilliance throughout, with six different players getting on the scoresheet. Robert Lewandowski scored his sixth of the season in just three games, while Benjamin Pavard, David Alaba, Kingsley Coman and Alphonso Davies also scored. Mainz took a shock early lead when Jean-Paul Boetius finished a superb sixth-minute counter attack, giving the visitors hope that they might be able to pick up their first point of the season. However Pavard equalised for the hosts half-an-hour later through an expertly taken volley which recalled his stunning 2018 World Cup strike against Argentina. Alaba gave Bayern the lead with a brilliantly taken free kick just before the break, and the rout was completed in the second half. The win sees Bayern move up the table to equal second, behind leaders RB Leipzig whose 3-1 win over Borussia Moenchengladbach on Friday means they have won three out of three. In Freiburg, Cologne's Ellyes Skhiri scored the winner in second-half injury time to secure the visitors a 2-1 victory. Freiburg hit the lead in the 40th minute through an own goal by Rafael Czichos, before Cologne fan favourite Anthony Modeste equalised in the 52nd minute. Schalke picked up their first win of the season over a disappointing Hertha Berlin at Gelsenkirchen's Veltins Arena. Berlin scored own goals either side of half time through Niklas Stark and Karim Rekik. English defender Jonjoe Kenny added a third in the 86th minute to make it 3-0 -- the first goal by a Schalke player this season -- to put the game beyond doubt. Wolfsburg and Paderborn fought out a firey 1-1 draw at the Volkswagen Arena. Newly-promoted Paderborn went ahead through Cauly Souza in the 12th minute, before Josip Brekalo equalised in the 56th minute. At the BayArena, visitors Hoffenheim ended Bayer Leverkusen's 100 per cent start to the season as the sides fought out a 0-0 draw. The visitors had to endure a six-minute spell of injury time but held firm against a luckless Leverkusen attack. While Leipzig's win over Gladbach saw them secure outright first on the table, Dortmund have the chance to snatch it back when they take on Union Berlin later on Saturday."
42,29/08/2019,17:46,Hoffenheim sign striker Locadia from Brighton on loan,"Striker Jurgen Locadia has joined Hoffenheim on a season-long loan from Premier League outfit Brighton and Hove Albion, the Bundesliga side announced on Thursday.","The 25-year-old moves to Germany for an undisclosed fee and will link up with Hoffenheim head coach Alfred Schreuder after the pair previously worked together at PSV Eindhoven, where he had acored 62 times in 176 appearances before being snapped up by Brighton in January 2018. ""He quickly attracted attention there (in Brighton) because of his goal-scoring ability and has been on the fringes of the Netherlands squad,"" said boss Schreuder. Locadia made an impact in England by scoring on his first two appearances, but his early days were hampered by injury. Despite limited opportunities, the Dutchman scored goals in back-to-back games last December, helping the club to a 1-1 draw with Arsenal and 1-0 win over Everton. In total, Locadia made 43 appearances for Brighton and the last of his six goals came in last season's FA Cup quarter-final win at Millwall in March. Hoffenheim badly need reinforcements up front after selling burly Brazilian striker Joelinton to Newcastle United and Hungary international Adam Szalai to Mainz, while Croatia striker Andrej Kramaric has been dogged by injury."
43,18/08/2019,18:06,Hinteregger claims Frankfurt victory,A Martin Hinteregger strike after 36 seconds was enough to see Eintracht Frankfurt to a narrow 1-0 victory over TSG Hoffenheim on Sunday in their opening game of the new Bundesliga season.,"After winning an early corner in the opening 10 seconds, the Hoffenheim defence was caught off guard when Japan midfielder Daichi Kamada played it short to winger Filip Kostic played who curled it to the waiting Hinteregger who volleyed into the top of the net. Scored after less than a minute, Hinteregger's goal was the fastest Hoffenheim had conceded in Bundesliga history. Florian Niederlechner's effort to put Augsburg 1-0 up against Borussia Dortmund on Saturday, scored after 31 seconds, remains however the fastest goal of the opening round. Kostic was a constant threat throughout for the home side, vindicating Frankfurt's decision to make his loan deal permanent during the summer. Hoffenheim thought they had equalised on two separate occasions - through Dennis Geiger in the 45th minute and again through Ishak Belfodil during second-half injury time - but both goals were ruled out for offside. Despite the loss, the visitors put in a strong performance under new coach Alfred Schreuder, showing promise as the side enters the post-Julian Nagelsmann era. Later on Sunday Nagelsmann's new club RB Leipzig travel to Union Berlin in the capital city outfit's first fixture in the German top-flight."
44,11/05/2019,18:02,Dortmund take title race to wire as Bayern held,Bayern Munich missed the chance to wrap up a seventh successive Bundesliga title as they were held to a goalless draw at RB Leipzig on Saturday and rivals Borussia Dortmund edged a nervy 3-2 win over Fortuna Duesseldorf.,"Chelsea-bound US international Christian Pulisic found the net in his final home game for Dortmund, helping them to battle back to within two points of league leaders Bayern ahead of the final round of games next weekend. Bayern can now secure the title with a win at home to Eintracht Frankfurt next Saturday, while Dortmund must win at Borussia Moenchengladbach. Dortmund, who looked dead and buried after slipping four points behind last week, enjoyed the rub of the green as they stumbled to victory over Duesseldorf. Pulisic, who will join Chelsea next season, bid an emotional farewell to the Dortmund fans before the game and then opened the scoring on 41 minutes. A howler from stand-in goalkeeper Marwin Hitz allowed Oliver Fink to equalise, but Thomas Delaney restored the lead for Dortmund. Hitz then gave away a penalty with a foul on Dodi Lukebakio, but the Belgian dragged the ball wide from 12 yards. Mario Goetze appeared to seal the win for Dortmund on 90 minutes, but Dawid Kownacki pulled one back for Duesseldorf minutes later to make it a nerve-jangling finish for the hosts. In Leipzig, Leon Goretzka's stylish scissor-kick sent Bayern into ecstasy after half-time, but the goal was ruled out by VAR. Serge Gnabry hit the bar later in the second half, but Bayern could not force the winner. At the other end of the table, Nuremberg and Hanover were finally relegated as Stuttgart secured the relegation play-off place with a 3-0 win over Wolfsburg. Hanover went down fighting as goals from Waldemar Anton, Ihlas Bebou and Walace saw them beat Freiburg 3-0. Yet Anastasios Donis, Gonzalo Castro and Daniel Didavi were on the mark for Stuttgart to condemn Hanover and Nuremberg to the drop. Nuremberg, meanwhile, suffered a 4-0 defeat to Borussia Moenchengladbach thanks to an own-goal from Lukas Muehl and strikes from Thorgan Hazard, Denis Zakaria and former Nuremberg man Josip Drmic. The thumping win sees Gladbach go fourth overnight, leapfrogging both Eintracht Frankfurt and Bayer Leverkusen, who were held to a 1-1 draw at home to Schalke, Guido Burgstaller cancelling out Kai Havertz's opener. Frankfurt have the chance to break back into the top four with a win over Mainz on Sunday. Werder Bremen also kept their European hopes alive with a 1-0 win over Hoffenheim, and Hertha Berlin snatched a late 4-3 victory away to Augsburg. Johannes Eggestein's first-half goal condemned RB Leipzig-bound coach Julian Nagelsmann to defeat in his last home game in charge of Hoffenheim. Andre Hahn and Michael Gregoritsch put Augsburg ahead three times but goals from Marvin Plattenhardt and Marko Grujic kept Hertha in the game before a late brace from Salomon Kalou secured three points."
45,04/05/2019,21:00,Dortmund collapse leaves Bayern on brink of seventh successive title,Borussia Dortmund coach Lucien Favre defended goalkeeper Roman Buerki after his second-half howler saw Dortmund throw away a two-goal lead to draw 2-2 with Werder Bremen and left Bayern Munich on the brink of a seventh successive Bundesliga title.,"""I am not going to talk about Roman. Whatever happens, he has had a fantastic season and has saved us a lot of points in the past,"" Favre told Sky. Buerki's error and a goal from Claudio Pizarro all but ended Dortmund's title challenge and sealed a perfect afternoon for Bayern, after club stalwarts Franck Ribery and Arjen Robben earlier returned from injury to help them to a 3-1 victory over bottom club Hanover. Dortmund, who were nine points ahead of Bayern in December, must now make up a four-point deficit in the last two games of the season. ""We have to win our last home game next week, that is our only hope,"" said Favre. Christian Pulisic opened the scoring for Dortmund after just six minutes with a brilliant solo goal, before Paco Alcacer doubled the lead with a fizzing free-kick. With Dortmund in full control on 70 minutes, Buerki allowed Bremen back into the game when he let Kevin Moehwald's tame shot through his legs, and former Bayern star Pizarro scored a shock equaliser moments later. ""If we can help Bayern, why not?"" a smiling Pizarro told Sky. In Munich, Robben and Ribery, both of whom are set to leave Bayern at the end of the season, came off the bench to make their first appearance together in 2019. Ribery scored what may be his last ever goal at the Allianz Arena, while Robben, who had not played since November, told Sky that his cameo appearance was not the end of his Bayern journey. ""I always said I didn't want to come back just to wave to the fans and say goodbye. There are two games left and the German Cup final, so there is more to come,"" he said. Hanover kept Bayern at bay for nearly half an hour before Robert Lewandowski headed the hosts ahead from close range and Leon Goretzka curled the second in off the post. The visitors hit back after half-time with a Jonathas penalty, the result of a highly controversial handball decision from VAR against Jerome Boateng. Ribery secured the win with a deflected shot six minutes from time. Bayern now need just one win from their last two games against top four sides RB Leipzig and Eintracht Frankfurt. Elsewhere, Borussia Moenchengladbach and Hoffenheim both stumbled in the race for the top four, as they shared the points in a 2-2 draw. Matthias Ginter cancelled out Pavel Kaderabek's opener, before Nadiem Amiri restored the lead with a fine volley. Josip Drmic saved Gladbach's Champions League hopes with a late equaliser. Wolfsburg also remain in the hunt for a top four place after goals from Felix Klaus and Marcel Tisserand saw them beat second-from-bottom Nuremberg 2-0. Both Nuremberg and Hanover were spared relegation for at least another week, however, as Hertha Berlin won 3-1 at home to Stuttgart, who remain in the relegation play-off place. Goals from Vedad Ibisevic, Ondrej Duda and Salomon Kalou sealed the win for Hertha, despite a late consolation header from Mario Gomez."
46,28/04/2019,17:42,Weghorst double and Baumann mistakes see Wolfsburg beat Hoffenheim,Hoffenheim goalkeeper Oliver Baumann fluffed two routine saves as his side lost 4-1 to Wolfsburg and missed the chance to move within a point of the top four.,"The usually reliable Baumann made his mistakes in the second half to hand Wolfsburg victory and end a six-game unbeaten run for Hoffenheim. ""It is really annoying because I saved pretty much everything else,"" Baumann told Sky. The defeat is a blow to Hoffenheim's hopes of European qualification. Julian Nagelsmann's side remain on course for a Europa League berth in seventh, but are four points adrift of the top four. ""If we are no longer favourites for the Champions League, then that is probably deserved after today,"" said Baumann. Adam Szalai found the net at the end of slick counter-attack to put Hoffenheim in front on nine minutes. Andrej Kramaric then missed a penalty for the hosts, before Wolfsburg's William curled in a superb equaliser just before half-time. Despite having made several fine saves in the first half, Baumann gifted Wolfsburg the lead with 20 minutes to go when he let Wout Weghorst's soft header slip through his fingers at the near post. The Hoffenheim keeper was beaten at his near post again by a fierce shot from Maximilian Arnold. Weghorst struck again in the 89th minute. The puts Wolfsburg move a point behind Hoffenheim in eighth. Bayern Munich have the chance to go four points clear at the top of the table when they face Nuremberg in Sunday's late match."
47,14/04/2019,15:37,Reiss Nelson fires Hoffenheim back into Europa League spot,Arsenal loanee Reiss Nelson scored his first goal since November on Sunday as Hoffenheim secured a 2-0 win over Hertha Berlin to climb back into the Bundesliga top six.,"Nelson, 19, out with a thigh injury in recent weeks, marked his return in style. The English youngster came off the bench to add to Nadiem Amiri's first-half opener and seal three crucial points in the race for European qualification. Only two points separate sixth-place Hoffenheim from Wolfsburg in ninth, with Werder Bremen and Bayer Leverkusen also in the running for a Europa League spot. Hoffenheim were utterly dominant first 20 minutes, but somehow conspired not to score, twice hitting the woodwork and missing several chances from point-blank range. Amiri broke the deadlock after half an hour, smashing the ball in off the post with his side's 14th shot on goal. Hoffenheim were twice denied by goalie Rune Jarstein in the second-half, before Nelson headed in the second goal of the day on the counter-attack. The goal, which was given by VAR after being initially ruled out for offside, was Nelson's first since his explosive run of form at the beginning of the season."
48,11/04/2019,06:12,Rising star Nelson hopes to emulate Henry after Hoffenheim success,"English teenager Reiss Nelson remembers driving up the leafy road towards the training ground of Bundesliga club Hoffenheim for the first time and thinking: ""Where am I going?""","The 19-year-old English winger has made quite an impact since arriving at the club on a year-long loan from Arsenal, becoming the latest English youngster after Jadon Sancho to shine in Germany. Now he feels ready to return to North London and walk in the footsteps of his boyhood idol Thierry Henry. Yet for a young man who grew up on the gritty estates of South London, it was something of a culture shock to land in the idyllic, green surroundings of Hoffenheim after his loan deal was signed last August. The club's training ground is in sleepy Zuzenhausen, a small village nestled in the hills near Heidelberg. ""It's a long drive coming up to the training ground and you are surrounded by all these trees,"" Nelson told AFP. ""I was like: 'where am I going?' Then I got into the changing room and all the guys were speaking German and I thought 'what are they talking about?'"" Nelson quickly integrated into the squad, however, scoring six goals in his first seven appearances. He formed a close group with teammates Ishak Belfodil, Kasim Adams Nuhu and Joshua Brenet. Germany international Nico Schulz also took Nelson under his wing, nicknaming him ""little brother"". ""Me, Ishak, Josh and Kasim are the ones who can't really speak German so we stay together,"" said Nelson, who is set to return to Arsenal at the end of the season. ""I've got a lot of close friends here and I will keep in contact with a lot of them."" One of several young Englishmen to have tried their luck in the Bundesliga, Nelson has not made quite the same impact as close friend Sancho, who broke into the England team this season. But having emerged at Arsenal under then manager Arsene Wenger, Nelson said he has learned plenty from Hoffenheim's 31-year-old coach Julian Nagelsmann. ""Arsene watched me grow up, he gave me my Premier League debut, and I think he developed me into a good young man as well,"" said Nelson. ""Julian is different. He likes to analyse the opposition and he is very tactical."" Nelson was an Arsenal fan as a boy and joined the club aged eight. He grew up idolising French striker Henry, who later coached him at under-19 level for the Gunners. ""Thierry used to give me a lot of advice, he was such a great guy,"" said Nelson. ""He told me to stay grounded, because a lot of kids start to get flashy when they get to 18 or 19, and they forget the basics of being a professional."" Nelson is learning his lessons the hard way -- he was dropped for a game against Nuremberg last month after turning up late for training. However, he says that in general, his spell in Germany has helped him stay on the straight and narrow. ""I live in Heidelberg, and there is not much going on,"" he says. The sleepy student town is a far cry from South London's Aylesbury Estate, where Nelson learned to play football. ""There were dangerous things happening around me growing up, but as long as I had my ball with me, I felt safe,"" he said. Nelson said his family made sacrifices back then, and have supported him during a frustrating second half of the season at Hoffenheim. The teenager has appeared in only five of Hoffenheim's last ten games as they try to secure a place in European competition next season. He has been nursing a thigh injury in recent weeks but hopes to return to action against Hertha Berlin this weekend, then end his Bundesliga season on a high and return to fight for his place at Arsenal, this time under Spanish manager Unai Emery. ""I just want to play football, and as long as I am given the opportunity to do my things, I think I can end my season very strongly,"" he said. ""If I wasn't aiming to break into the Arsenal first team, that wouldn't be the right mindset. ""My year in Germany has had its ups and downs, but I am going to be ready for next season."""
49,07/04/2019,17:38,Hoffenheim keep European dream alive with Augsburg win,Julian Nagelsmann's hopes of leaving Hoffenheim with European qualification were given a boost on Sunday as his side thrashed Augsburg 4-0 to stay within a point of the top six.,"A second-half hat-trick from Ishak Belfodil left Hoffenheim just one point behind the Europa League places, hot on the heels of Wolfsburg and Borussia Moenchengladbach. Coaching prodigy Nagelsmann, 31, has repeatedly spoken of his desire to guide the club back into European competition before he leaves them for RB Leipzig this summer, and Belfodil's star performance moved Hoffenheim a step closer to their goal on Sunday. ""We still need to win all our games because the teams above us have been unbelievably consistent this year,"" Nagelsmann told Sky. Andrej Kramaric scored his 15th goal of the season to give the visitors an early lead, sweeping the ball in on the rebound after Belfodil had forced a save from Augsburg goalkeeper Gregor Kobel. Kobel later denied Kramaric with a stunning reflex save, but he could do nothing to stop Belfodil's diving header just after the hour mark. Belfodil added another on 74 minutes, breaking away on the counter-attack and finding the bottom corner with a smart finish. The Algerian completed his hat-trick with an almost identical goal eight minutes from time."
50,09/02/2019,18:26,Dortmund surrender three-goal lead in Hoffenheim draw,"Despite a dazzling display from Jadon Sancho, Bundesliga leaders Borussia Dortmund threw away a three-goal lead at home on Saturday as Hoffenheim's stunning late fightback forced a 3-3 draw.","Dortmund could have gone 10 points clear of Bayern Munich, who host Schalke later on Saturday, with victory. Sancho opened the scoring, set up two goals and hit the post as the hosts dazzled over 70 minutes at Signal Iduna Park. However, with the leaders cruising at 3-0 up thanks to goals by Sancho, Mario Goetze and Raphael Guerreiro, Hoffenheim came off the ropes with Algeria forward Ishak Belfodil netting twice. Despite the draw, Dortmund are eight points clear at the top of the table. The result will give Mauricio Pochettino food for thought before his Tottenham team host Dortmund on Wednesday at Wembley in the Champions League, last 16, first leg. In the absence of top-scorer and playmaker Marco Reus, sidelined with a thigh injury, Sancho stepped up with one of his best performances since joining Dortmund from Manchester City in August 2017. The 18-year-old looked to have scored a fortuitous opener when the ball bounced off him and into Hoffenheim's net with 11 minutes gone, but the video assistant referee spotted the ball had hit his upper arm. Undeterred, Sancho scored on 32 minutes, taking a return pass from Lukasz Piszczek and fired home from a tight angle. He helped double Dortmund's lead two minutes before the break when Axel Witsel found him with a long-range pass and although Sancho's shot was parried, Goetze tapped in the rebound. The pair combined for Dortmund's third, Goetze sprinting after Sancho's audacious backheel to square for Guerreiro to make it 3-0 on 67 minutes. However, just after Sancho then hit the post, Hoffenheim fought back, Belfodil tapped home his first goal from a cross by Pavel Kaderabek. The Czech midfielder made it 2-0 with a bullet header eight minutes from time. Belfodil completed the comeback and claimed a point for Hoffenheim when he launched himself at a free-kick and his header beat goalkeper Roman Burki on 87 minutes. Elsewhere, Borussia Moenchengladbach slipped to third after losing 3-0 at home by Hertha Berlin as Salomon Kalou, playmaker Ondrej Duda and Davie Selke scored. In the basement battle, Hanover climbed off the bottom with a 2-0 home win at Nuremberg, who took their place as last in the table, with former Germany striker Nicolai Mueller scoring both goals. Fourth-placed RB Leipzig were held to a goalless draw at home by Eintracht Frankfurt, who are just one place behind them. Mid-table sides Freiburg and Wolfsburg shared a point in an entertaining 3-3 draw as Gian-Luca Waldschmidt equalised for hosts Freiburg two minutes from time as his side came back from 2-1 down."
51,26/01/2019,20:34,Dortmund go nine points clear of Bayern Munich by thumping Hanover,Marco Reus shone as Borussia Dortmund opened a nine-point lead over Bayern Munich at the top of the Bundesliga table with a 5-1 rout of strugglers Hanover on Saturday.,"With defending champions Bayern hosting Stuttgart on Sunday, Dortmund grabbed the chance to thump second-from-bottom Hanover with Reus causing havoc on his return from an ankle injury. ""We took our time to find the gaps, but after we changed ends and went 2-0 up it was much easier,"" said Dortmund coach Lucien Favre after his side floored Hanover with three goals in seven minutes. Achraf Hakimi, on loan from Real Madrid, Reus, Mario Goetze and Raphael Guerreiro scored Dortmund's goals to keep them on course for their first Bundesliga title since 2012. The rout piles pressure on Hanover coach Andre Breitenreiter, but his side showed spirit when Marvin Bakalorz scored a late consolation against his former club before Witsel grabbed Dortmund's fifth goal on 90 minutes. ""It's up to others in the club to decide now where we go from here,"" said Breitenreiter, who helped Hanover win promotion back to the Bundesliga last season. ""This isn't about me -- it's about staying up."" Hanover started brightly at Dortmund's Signal Iduna Park when forward Henrick Weydandt forcing an early save, but it was one-way traffic thereafter as Reus hit the post on 23 minutes. Soon after, Dortmund left-back Hakimi swapped passes with Guerreiro on the edge of the area and curled his shot inside the post for the opening goal. Reus had an injury scare just before the break, clashing heads with Danish midfielder Thomas Delaney as both charged into a challenge. However, the pair shook off the collision and Reus was instrumental in a flurry of goals just after the hour mark. It started with text book counter-pressing when Hakimi robbed Hanover defender Miiko Albornoz on the edge of the box and squared to Reus who fired home his 12th league goal in 18 games. Mario Goetze claimed his second goal of the season when a sublime pass from Jadon Sancho found the Dortmund striker was unmarked to fire home. Reus set up Dortmund's fourth, cutting through the Hanover defence and passed to Guerreiro who netted with the defence cut to ribbons. The game had already turned into a rout even before a glove from Hanover goalkeeper Michael Esser denied Reus, then Sancho in quick succession. Bakalorz scored Hanover's consolation before Witsel found a gap in the defence and his shot went in off the post for his second goal in a week after netting the winner at Leipzig last weekend. Borussia Moenchengladbach joined Bayern on 39 points, but went second on goal difference with a 2-0 win at home to Augsburg. Gladbach midfielder Jonas Hofmann, linked with a move to Tottenham Hotspur, had a penalty saved just before the break before Oscar Wendt and Patrick Herrmann scored second-half goals. Bayer Leverkusen claimed their first win under new coach Peter Bosz when Germany internationals Kai Havertz, Kevin Volland and Julian Brandt netted their goals in a 3-0 victory at Wolfsburg. Hoffenheim moved into the top six with a 4-2 win at Freiburg as Andrej Kramaric scored twice while mid-table Mainz won 2-1 at home to bottom side Nuremberg with Sweden striker Robin Quaison scoring the winner. On Saturday night, Eintracht Frankfurt climbed into the top four with a 2-2 draw at Werder Bremen as striker Sebastian Haller equalised with a second-half penalty for the visitors. RB Leipzig can regain fourth place by avoiding defeat at Fortuna Duesseldorf on Sunday evening."
52,12/12/2018,23:55,Sane double secures Champions League top spot for Man City,Manchester City survived a sloppy start to secure top spot in Champions League Group F by coming from behind to beat Hoffenheim 2-1 thanks to Leroy Sane's double on Wednesday.,"Andrej Kramaric's penalty put the Germans deservedly in front on 16 minutes as another much-changed City side struggled to get up to speed. However, Pep Guardiola's men found their feet as the first half wore on and were level just before the break courtesy of a brilliant Sane free-kick. Guardiola was frustrated by his side's wastefulness in front of goal in the second period, but Sane did at least secure victory by converting Raheem Sterling's pass on the hour mark. ""We started flat because this team is so demanding in terms of how they attack the space, their physicality, they are stronger than us,"" said Guardiola. ""After that we created an incredible amount of chances, but the result is good. ""We are in the best 16, now we are going to see the draw and especially try to arrive in the right moment."" City made life difficult for themselves in the group with a flat performance in losing at home to Lyon in their opening group game and were similarly caught cold having already secured their place in the last 16. Kramaric had fired a warning shot inches over before Ederson produced an incredible finger-tip stop to turn another curling effort from the Croatian behind. However, Kramaric's luck was in third time round from the penalty spot after Aymeric Laporte was punished for hauling down Benjamin Hubner. All of City's best efforts before the break came from set-pieces as Gabriel Jesus and Nicolas Otamendi struck the woodwork. But the hosts were finally level in spectacular fashion when Sane curled a free-kick into the top corner from 30 yards out. Hoffenheim needed to win just to have a chance of qualifying for the Europa League knockout stage in third, but in their desperation to chase a winner left themselves hopelessly exposed to the pace of Sane and Sterling after the break. ""I don't think three points sums up our position completely. We would have gone further if we had got the points we should have done,"" said Hoffenheim boss Julian Nagelsmann, who will leave to join RB Leipzig next season. ""As newcomers to this competition, we have learnt a lot, we have played well in the tournament and come back several times in games. We have done a lot for this club and hope there will be more of this in the future."" Sane was guilty of overplaying as City incredibly spurned a three-against-one when Sterling fed the German, who tried to tee up the surprised Bernardo Silva rather than going for goal himself and Baumann saved the Portuguese's shot. ""We are young. I have that feeling. The people in front are 21, 22 years old we need to be more calm in these positions,"" added Guardiola. However, the City boss reserved special praise for 18-year-old Phil Foden on his first Champions League start of the season just days after signing a new five-and-a-half-year contract. ""He is an amazing player. His mentality, he can score goals, he is a fighter, his control in tight positions, he is a master. ""We didn't have any doubts he is ready to play in a top level with us."" Sterling has been in the news for bravely speaking out about the alleged racist abuse he suffered in defeat at Chelsea on Saturday and news coverage he has received in the past. However, the England international showed little sign of letting it disrupt his fine form on the pitch as he teed up Sane to round Baumann and slot home the winner. Next up the competition favourites will face one of Atletico Madrid, Schalke, Ajax or Roma in Monday's draw."

""It was hard in difficult conditions. We gave ourselves a fright and it's a pity we didn't kill off the game in the first half,"" Lyon midfielder Houssem Aouar told RMC Sport. ""The main thing is that we've qualified."" Shakhtar forged ahead midway through the opening period with what proved their only shot of the first half, just seconds after Lyon forward Bertrand Traore had been denied by Andriy Pyatov when clean through one-on-one with the goalkeeper. The Burkina Faso international was made to pay for his profligacy, as Junior Moraes slotted home after being picked out by Ismaily. Lyon continued to dominate, though, and finally equalised in the 65th minute as Nabil Fekir hammered a left-footed strike into the top corner following excellent play by Memphis Depay. Man City wrapped up top spot in the group by coming from behind to beat Hoffenheim 2-1 at the Etihad Stadium. Andrej Kramaric gave Hoffenheim a surprise 16th-minute lead from the penalty spot, although Leroy Sane levelled on the stroke of half-time with a magnificent free-kick. City wasted a host of chances, with away goalkeeper Oliver Baumann in inspired form, but Sane grabbed his second just after the hour mark to complete the turnaround. Bayern Munich went into their game at Ajax just needing a point to beat their opponents to first place in Group E, and Niko Kovac's men did just that in a thrilling 3-3 draw. The game burst into life in the second half when Dusan Tadic equalised Robert Lewandowski's early opener just after the hour mark, with Ajax defender Maximilian Woeber sent off in the 67th minute for a dangerous lunge on Leon Goretzka. But Bayern were also reduced to 10 men only eight minutes later, as Thomas Mueller was given his marching orders for planting his studs into the head of Nicolas Tagliafico. Ajax briefly moved top of the live standings when Jerome Boateng carelessly conceded a penalty, which was dispatched emphatically into the roof of the net by Tadic. But Tagliafico brought down Thiago Alcantara, with Lewandowski slotting in the spot-kick, before Kingsley Coman looked to have settled matters with a wonderful 90th-minute strike. Tagliafico went up the other end to equalise again, but Ajax failed to find a winner as Bayern just about held on. ""That was an advert for football,"" smiled Kovac. ""The most important thing was to finish top of the group and with 14 from 18 points we are happy."" Juventus finished at the Group H summit ahead of Manchester United despite slumping to a 2-1 defeat by Young Boys in Bern, as Jose Mourinho's Premier League giants lost at Valencia. United had to beat Valencia and hope Juve failed to win in Switzerland, but Carlos Soler and a comical Phil Jones own goal did the damage for the visitors, with Marcus Rashford scoring a late consolation. ""I didn't learn anything at all,"" Mourinho said. ""Nothing surprised me at all."" Guillaume Hoarau netted twice to help Young Boys end their European campaign on a high note. CSKA Moscow stunned a much-changed Real Madrid with a 3-0 victory at the Santiago Bernabeu, but still finished bottom of Group G as Viktoria Plzen beat Roma. The Russian side, who also downed Real 1-0 in the reverse fixture, had to better Plzen's result to finish third and qualify for the Europa League. But Plzen edged out Roma 2-1 in the Czech Republic to render CSKA's famous victory ultimately meaningless, despite inflicting the heaviest ever European home loss on the record 13-time champions. ""It's sad to say the least to beat Real Madrid, earn seven points, but finish bottom and get eliminated from Europe,"" said CSKA coach Viktor Goncharenko. Holders Real had already progressed to the last 16 as group winners, with Roma through in second place. Home coach Santiago Solari boosted CSKA's hopes before kick-off by making seven changes to his starting XI, and goals from Fedor Chalov, Georgiy Schennikov and Arnor Sigurdsson gave CSKA a comprehensive win."
54,11/12/2018,18:25,City down to 15 players for Hoffenheim clash: Guardiola,"Injury-hit Manchester City have just 15 senior players fit for Wednesday's Champions League tie against Hoffenheim, boss Pep Guardiola revealed on Tuesday.","David Silva and Fernandinho have joined an injury list at City that already featured Sergio Aguero, Kevin De Bruyne, Danilo, Benjamin Mendy and Claudio Bravo. ""We have 15 players available so I cannot do too much,"" Guardiola told reporters when asked if he would make changes against Hoffenheim. City are already through to the Champions League last 16, but they need at least a point to be sure of finishing as Group F winners, which could ensure an easier draw in the first knockout round. ""We are going into a really tough game. We are in the next stage and that's important but we want to go through finishing first. ""If you finish first or second the last 16 is tough but to play at home (in the second leg) is a small advantage."" Guardiola's injury problems come after City suffered their first Premier League defeat of the season at Chelsea on Saturday, a setback that saw Liverpool move above them into top spot in the table. Spanish midfielder Silva was substituted at Chelsea with a hamstring injury and Guardiola said he faces ""a few weeks"" out. Argentina forward Aguero, who has missed three games with a groin problem, could return to face Everton on Saturday."
55,01/12/2018,20:41,Bayern up to third with first league win for a month,"Bayern Munich earned their first Bundesliga win for a month as Serge Gnabry scored twice in Saturday's 2-1 win at Werder Bremen, but the defending champions remained nine points behind leaders Borussia Dortmund.","Bayern's victory lifted them two places in the table to third, but they will drop back to fifth if Eintracht Frankfurt earn a fifth straight win at home to Wolfsburg on Sunday and RB Leipzig beat second-placed Moenchengladbach. Bayern built on their 5-1 midweek thrashing of Benfica in the Champions League, but still lag well behind Dortmund, who also won 2-0 at home against Freiburg. ""We know about the situation in the table - every game is important to get the three points and reduce the gap in the table,"" said Bayern goal-scorer Gnabry. ""The victories ensures a good mood and gives us confidence for our next game (against Nuremberg next Saturday). ""We didn't give much away - that gives us confidence."" The last time Bayern were so far behind in the table was in 2010/11, when Dortmund won the title, and their bid for a seventh straight Bundesliga crown is in danger after only their third win in their last nine league games. Gnabry, who started for Arjen Robben, put Bayern ahead on 20 minutes in Bremen after Joshua Kimmich's chip into the area shortly after the visitors had a penalty appeal turned down. Thomas Mueller then fired wide with the goal at his mercy, but Bayern's defensive frailties returned to haunt them as Bremen equalised 14 minutes later. Centre-back Jerome Boateng was out-leapt by Japan forward Yuya Osako after a pin-point accurate cross as Bremen drew level after midfielder Nuri Sahin had gone close. It was 1-1 at the break, but Bayern grabbed the winner five minutes into the second period when Mueller delayed his pass into the box for Gnabry to deflect the ball into the net. Bremen finished with 10 men when Niklas Moisander was sent off just before the final whistle for a second yellow card. However, there was more good news for Bayern as winger Kingsley Coman came on for his first appearance since tearing ankle ligaments on the opening day of the season in August. Likewise, Thiago Alcantara played the last 10 minutes after a month out with injury. In Dortmund, Paco Alcacer continued his phenomenal scoring run by netting his 10th goal of the season to become the league's top scorer. The Spaniard also equalled the Bundesliga record for most goals by a substitute in a season -- just 13 matches into the 2018/19 campaign -- with his ninth goal off the bench in his eighth league game. The ex-Barcelona forward has so far averaged a goal for Dortmund every 28 minutes. Dortmund went ahead when England teenager Jadon Sancho was brought down and Marco Reus hit his penalty attempt into the middle of the goal five minutes before half-time. Alcacer came on in the 70th minute and tapped home a minute into added time after brilliant play by Sancho and Lukasz Piszczek. ""It was logical that this would be a tough game for us, as Freiburg picked up a point (against Bayern) in Munich,"" said Dortmund coach Lucien Favre. ""They were very organised and compact, making it hard for us to find the holes, but luckily we were patient."" Hertha Berlin picked up their first win since stunning Bayern in September with a 2-0 win at Hanover. Berlin's captain Vedad Ibisevic heading home in the second-half after centre-back Jordan Torunarigha put them ahead in the first-half. Stuttgart moved off bottom place with a 1-0 win over mid-table Augsburg after striker Anastasios Donis scored their first-half winner. In the evening's game, Schalke, who qualified for the last 16 of the Champions League in midweek, moved up three places to 11th with a 1-1 draw at Hoffenheim. Andre Kramaric's penalty for Hoffenheim in the second half was cancelled out by a spot-kcik from Schalke's Nabil Bentaleb 17 minutes from time."
56,13/09/2017,18:50,Ancelotti cool over Nagelsmann's Bayern 'dream',"Amidst rising tension in Bayern Munich's ranks, Carlo Ancelotti reacted calmly on Wednesday to Hoffenheim boss Julian Nagelsmann's comments that he wants to eventually coach the Bavarians.","""It's quite normal that a young and good coach such as Julian dreams of training a very high level club,"" Bayern manager Ancelotti told broadcaster Eurosport. The 30-year-old Nagelsmann, voted Germany's coach of the year in 2016, stirred rumours that he has been ear-marked as a future Bayern coach by revealing he is building a house in Munich, where his wife's parents live. ""FC Bayern is a big part of my dream,"" said Nagelsmann, who steered Hoffenheim from the verge of relegation in 2015/16 to finish fourth in Germany's top flight last season. ""I am very happy with my life and FC Bayern will bring me a little more happiness, but it's not like my life depends on FC Bayern."" Nagelsmann's comments do little to help Ancelotti's position with the Italian facing rising tensions in his star-studded squad. The mood has been low since Bayern crashed to a shock 2-0 defeat at Hoffenheim on Saturday which left them sixth in the German league table. Franck Ribery was the latest big name to break ranks by hurling his shirt at the Bayern bench in Tuesday's 3-0 home win against 10-man Anderlecht after being hauled off with 12 minutes left in the Champions League game. Ribery's tantrum came after Robert Lewandowski criticised Bayern's spending police in an interview, saying the Bavarian giants risk being left behind by Europe's top clubs unless they spend more. That came after Bayern stalwart Thomas Mueller complained about being left on the bench at Werder Bremen a fortnight ago - he has struggled for form since Ancelotti took charge at the start of last season. Another Bayern star Arjen Robben was unhappy with the team display on Tuesday as the Germans dropped the pace against a stubborn Anderlecht, who played nearly 80 minutes with just ten men. After Lewandowski's early penalty, Bayern only made sure of the win when Thiago Alcantara and Joshua Kimmich scored second-half goals. ""What would have happened if we had just kept hitting the post?"" said Robben. ""The fans deserve more. ""You have to be satisfied with 3-0, but with all due respect, you should normally knock a team off the park 5-0 (with the numerical advantage). ""We need to question ourselves and show more ambition as a team to create goals. ""We must try to stick together and get along better."""
57,10/09/2017,12:46,Ancelotti rues 'little details' in shock loss,"Carlo Ancelotti admitted Bayern Munich were caught cold in their 2-0 loss at Hoffenheim on Saturday that left them fifth in the Bundesliga, their lowest position since 2014.","Striker Mark Uth scored both Hoffenheim goals as Bayern head coach Ancelotti paid the price for rotating his squad ahead of Tuesday's Champions League match at home to Anderlecht. Defending champions Bayern stumbled to defeat despite 72 percent possession and 23 shots on goal, while Hoffenheim scored twice from just six efforts. ""Little details have made the difference and we went behind because we didn't concentrate,"" fumed Ancelotti. ""It was the same for the second goal, which made things difficult. ""We had a lot of opportunities, but we could not make use of them and did not concentrate 100 percent. ""Hoffenheim only got into the box three times and scored from two of them, the other chance was saved by Manuel Neuer."" Ancelotti's decision to start Arjen Robben and Franck Ribery on the bench backfired as Thomas Mueller had a poor game on his 400th appearance for the club. Bayern fell behind on 27 minutes after the defence was slow to react to a quick throw-in from Andrej Kramaric which led to Uth firing past Neuer. ""We didn't behave well after going 1-0 down,"" said Neuer. ""We had Hoffenheim completely under control, but we didn't take the lead, that is the problem."" Uth drilled home a second on 51 minutes as the hosts registered back-to-back wins over the Bavarian giants, who had been unbeaten in the league since losing 1-0 at Hoffenheim in April. ""We are happy that we won today, we were worse in all the stats but that does not matter,"" said 30-year-old Hoffeheim coach Julian Nagelsmann. ""Bayern came out quite differently from the way they played last season."" The fast reactions of a Hoffenheim ball-boy, who quickly gave Kramaric a ball in the build-up to Uth's first goal, helped the hosts' cause but Nagelsmann defended the youngster. ""We have a policy in training that the the ball-boys get the ball back into the game as quickly as possible,"" said Nagelsmann. ""Besides, they have learned from the best at Bayern Munich and Manuel Neuer often gets the ball quickly at the Allianz Arena before the opposition has had time to react."""
58,23/08/2017,22:39,Can double gets Liverpool back into big time,Emre Can struck twice as Liverpool convincingly defeated Hoffenheim 4-2 at Anfield on Wednesday to reach the Champions League group phase for only the second time since 2010.,"Germany midfielder Can found the net twice in the opening 21 minutes, either side of Mohamed Salah's first Anfield goal following his move from Roma, before substitute Mark Uth replied for the visitors. Hoffenheim old boy Roberto Firmino netted a fourth goal in the second half and Sandro Wagner's late header proved anecdotal as Jurgen Klopp's men completed a 6-3 aggregate victory. Now unbeaten in 15 home games against German teams, Liverpool will learn their group-stage opponents in Thursday's draw in Monaco, which will feature five English clubs for the first time. Liverpool join Chelsea, Tottenham Hotspur and Manchester City, who qualified via the Premier League, and Manchester United, who engineered their own Champions League return by winning last season's Europa League. Liverpool will be making their first appearance in the Champions League proper since 2014-15, when they were eliminated in the group stage. Klopp was once again without Barcelona target Philippe Coutinho, who is both ill and nursing a sore back, but the sizzling interplay of Firmino and Sadio Mane meant he was not missed. The five-time European champions took a 10th-minute lead against continental first-timers Hoffenheim courtesy of the first of several delightful interchanges between their forward players. Firmino's delicately weighted through-ball freed Mane and he back-heeled the ball into the path of Can, whose shot found the net via a heavy deflection off the sliding Havard Nordtveit. Egyptian winger Salah struck in the 18th minute, tapping in from close range after Georginio Wijnaldum's shot from Firmino's left-wing cut-back bounced back off the right-hand post. Three minutes later another Mane back-heel yielded another goal, the Senegal winger's touch releasing Firmino, whose cross was adroitly volleyed home by Can. Hoffenheim coach Julian Nagelsmann took swift action, sending on forward Uth for defender Nordtveit, and four minutes later Dejan Lovren's loose pass allowed the substitute to reduce the arrears with an angled drive. After Wijnaldum and Mane had gone close, Liverpool added a fourth in the 63rd minute when skipper Jordan Henderson robbed his Hoffenheim counterpart Kevin Vogt and charitably teed up Firmino for a tap-in. Wagner completed the scoring with a header from Andrej Kramaric's left-wing cross, but by then all hope of a Hoffenheim comeback had vanished. Sporting Lisbon thrashed Romanian outfit FCSB 5-1 in Bucharest as the visitors scored four second-half goals after Seydou Doumbia's 13th-minute opener was cancelled out by home defender Junior Morais. Marcos Acuna, Gelson Martins, Bas Dost and Rodrigo Battaglia were all on target for Sporting who blew their opponents in Romania away following last week's 0-0 draw in the Portuguese capital. Dino Ndlovu grabbed the vital goal as Qarabag became the first team from Azerbaijan to reach the group stage, qualifying on away goals despite a 2-1 defeat away to FC Copenhagen. Georgi Schennikov and Alan Dzagoev scored as CSKA Moscow downed Switzerland's Young Boys 2-0 in Russia to wrap up a 3-0 aggregate victory, while APOEL of Cyprus progressed 2-0 overall a following goalless stalemate at Slavia Prague."
59,22/08/2017,12:44,Hoffenheim out to make history at Anfield,"Hoffenheim head to Jurgen Klopp's Liverpool bidding to make history by overturning a 2-1 deficit in Wednesday's Champions League second-leg, play-off to become the first German club to win at Anfield.","Liverpool looked to have planted one foot in the group phase after going 2-0 up in last week's first leg in Germany, only for Mark Uth's 87th-minute reply to bring Hoffenheim right back into the tie. The Germans are bidding to reach the Champions League's group stage for the first time in the club's history. Liverpool though have yet to lose at home to German opposition in 14 matches at home in European competition with 11 wins and three draws. ""There is always the first time, we want to win the game, but there is the additional attraction of writing our own success story,"" Hoffenheim's 24-year-old Germany midfielder Kerem Demirbay told German daily Bild. ""It's a great time to write history."" Although they need to score at least twice, Demirbay insists the Germans will not be intimidated by Anfield, but are full of respect for Klopp's side. ""One has to say, they are simply a good team, but we are also good,"" said Demirbay. ""We're not Liverpool, but we can go there with our heads held high and play without fear. ""We're good enough to survive there too and score at least two goals."" Demirbay says the novelty of playing in the electric atmosphere of Anfield will motivate the Germans. ""It can also give us a push, because none of us have experienced an atmosphere like Anfield. ""I won't be intimidated, quite the opposite. ""I think it's great when you come across a mood like that in a stadium. It's inspiring."""
60,21/08/2017,01:45,Liverpool out to complete Hoffenheim mission,Jurgen Klopp's Liverpool will attempt to clinch their place in the lucrative Champions League group stage this week as they take a 2-1 lead into their play-off second leg against Hoffenheim.,"Trent Alexander-Arnold's free-kick and a second-half own goal handed the Reds a commanding advantage in Germany, but Mark Uth's late strike provided Hoffenheim with a glimmer of hope ahead of the return at Anfield. Klopp rotated his squad for Saturday's 1-0 victory over Crystal Palace in the Premier League, making five changes to the team with Wednesday's European encounter weighing heavily on his mind. It is three years since the Anfield outfit, five times European champions, last graced the group stage of the continent's elite club competition. ""The performance and the result were not perfect, far from it. We still have much to do in this tie,"" Klopp said in Liverpool's matchday programme at the weekend. The club have also rejected a third bid from Barcelona for star playmaker Philippe Coutinho, turning down a reported offer worth around £114 million ($146.5 million, 124.7 million euros). The 25-year-old Brazilian has submitted a transfer request, but Liverpool have publicly stated Coutinho, currently sidelined by a back problem, is not for sale at any price. Hoffenheim started the new Bundesliga campaign with a 1-0 victory at home to Werder Bremen, and Germany midfielder Kerem Demirbay still harbours hope of stunning Liverpool in the second leg. ""We could achieve something extraordinary there. We could turn it around. We will give everything to do that,"" said Demirbay, who was part of Germany's Confederations Cup-winning side in Russia. Scottish champions Celtic are all but assured of a return to the group phase following a 5-0 demolition of Astana in last week's first leg in Glasgow. Brendan Rodgers' side stretched their unbeaten domestic run to 52 matches with Saturday's 2-0 victory at Kilmarnock and have conceded just once in nine matches this season. James Forrest struck the Hoops' opener at Rugby Park but insists Celtic cannot afford to be overconfident ahead of their 6,000km trip to Kazakhstan. ""We just can't get complacent, we need to make sure we start the game well and start positive and hopefully get a positive result,"" said Forrest. Nice face a monumental task to overturn a 2-0 deficit against Napoli on Tuesday, but the French side will be boosted by the presence of Mario Balotelli and new recruit Wesley Sneijder. The Dutchman, a Champions League winner with Inter Milan in 2010, played 85 minutes in his debut on Saturday as Nice downed Guingamp 2-0 for their first points of the season. ""I feel good, especially with a win, you feel really good. As for my performance, I know I can do better,"" Sneijder, who joined on a free transfer following his exit from Galatasaray, told Canal+. ""It was my first match so I need to get to know the guys. The second half was better than the first but I still need time."" Balotelli also made his first appearance of the league season after coming on a second-half substitute following his return from injury. Sevilla will fancy their chances of qualifying for a third straight group stage campaign as they hold a 2-1 edge over Turkey's Istanbul Basaksehir, who have never won away from home in Europe."
61,03/04/2016,17:41,Gladbach rout Hertha to climb into Champions League berths,Borussia Moenchengladbach climbed into the Bundesliga's Champions League places on Sunday with a 5-0 hammering of Hertha Berlin as Andre Hahn scored his first goal since his horror injury.,"Gladbach routed third-placed Hertha 4-1 in Berlin last October and again ran riot at Borussia Park as Edin Hazard scored twice with Germany winger Patrick Hermann and Ibrahima Traore joining Hahn on the scoresheet. The result sees Gladbach climb from seventh to fourth and are now just three points behind Hertha with Andre Schubert's team hunting a return to the Champions League next season with their highest league win for five years. Gladbach took the lead when Hertha's goalkeeper Rune Jarstein made a hash of his clearance kick on 14 minutes. Borussia's Mahmoud Dahoud intercepted the ball and his pass found Hazard, who fired home. Gladbach doubled their tally with an hour gone when Hahn marked his first start in five months with a superb individual effort. Having received the ball with his back to goal, Hahn made enough space to turn and hit the top left-hand corner. It marked his sweet return to Gladbach's starting line-up after a horror tackle by Schalke's Johannes Geis left him with a fractured leg and torn knee ligament last October. The floodgates opened in the last 15 minutes as Herrmannn finished a move he started with Hazard on 76 minutes before the Belgian claimed his second on 80 minutes. With the Hertha defence in disarray, Ibrahima Traore replaced Hazard and scored two minutes after coming off the bench to claim Gladbach's fifth. On Saturday, Franck Ribery's spectacular bicycle kick sealed Bayern Munich's 1-0 win over Eintracht Frankfurt to keep Pep Guardiola's side five points clear. With six games left, the Bavarians remain on track to become the first German club to win four straight Bundesliga titles. Second-placed Borussia Dortmund later came from behind to seal a dramatic 3-2 win over Werder Bremen as super subs Shinji Kagawa and Adrian Ramos scored the hosts' goals which confirms their Champions League place for next season. South Korea international Koo Ja-Cheol netted for relegation-threatened Augsburg as his club lost 4-2 at Mainz. Augsburg stay clear of the relegation places on goal difference and are level on 27 points with Frankfurt and Hoffenheim, who host Cologne on Sunday evening. Bottom side Hanover 96 are ten points from safety with six league games left after losing 3-0 at home to Hamburg. Schalke dropped to seventh, and risk losing their Europa League place for next season, after their 3-0 drubbing at Ingolstadt. Darmstadt pulled themselves two points away from the relegation battle with a 2-2 draw at home to Stuttgart. On Friday, Wolfsburg were hammered 3-0 at Bayer Leverkusen in a poor build-up to Wednesday's Champions League quarter-final, first leg at home to Real Madrid."
62,29/03/2016,13:46,German league's record-holder Hildebrand retires,"Timo Hildebrand, who holds the Bundesliga record for a goalkeeper of 885 minutes without conceding a goal, confirmed Tuesday he is retiring at the age of 36.","""Every goodbye is difficult. With your support it will be easier for me. I want to thank every single fan, club and companion in my last 17 years as a professional footballer,"" Hildebrand wrote on his Facebook page. The ex-Germany shot-stopper is without a club and has decided to hang up his gloves after a move to an MLS club in the United States fell through. Hildebrand set the German league record in nine games, bridging the 2002/03 and 2003/04 seasons. ""This record was part of an outstanding team performance. If anyone manages to beat it, it will be Bayern and Manuel,"" Hildebrand magazine Kicker. Bayern Munich's Manuel Neuer came closest to beating Hildebrand's figure in 2011 when he went 770 minutes unbeaten in the German league. Hildebrand won the last of his seven caps for Germany in 2007 and made 301 appearances in the Bundesliga for VfB Stuttgart, Hoffenheim, Schalke 04 and Eintracht Frankfurt. He also had spells at Valencia and Sporting Lisbon after winning the Bundesliga title with Stuttgart in the 2006/07 season. He last played in Germany's top flight for Frankfurt in December 2014 and has decided to retire after a long recovery period following a hip operation in April 2015. ""I love football, but I am at an age when one is allowed to stop,"" he added. ""Apart from that, my health is important to me and I want to be able to have a bit of a kick around with my son."" Hildebrand has signed up to study for his coaching licence and says he may well work for VfB Stuttgart in the future. ""I am rooted to the club and can well imagine doing something at VfB in the future. I have good contacts,"" he said. For now he is busy with projects in sports business and event management and is a partner in a supermarket chain of vegan food."
63,12/03/2016,17:49,Wolfsburg suffer Euro hangover at Hoffenheim,Wolfsburg suffered a Champions League hangover on Saturday with a 1-0 defeat at relegation-threatened Hoffenheim in the Bundesliga as Andrej Kramaric scored a third-minute winner.,"Wolfsburg reached the last eight in Europe on Tuesday for the first time in the club's history as their 1-0 win at home to Gent sealed a 4-2 win on aggregate in the last 16. But Dieter Hecking's side were stunned by second-from-bottom Hoffenheim in Sinsheim as Kramaric, on loan from Leicester until the end of the season, scored after just three minutes for his third goal in the Bundesliga. Hoffenheim should have scored a second as Germany forward Kevin Volland had a penalty saved after Wolfsburg goalkeeper Koen Casteels brought down Kramaric in the area. Volland had demanded to take the second-half spot-kick, which Kramaric had wanted to attempt himself, but held his head in his hands when Casteels palmed his effort away This was Wolfsburg's first defeat in four games since going down 2-0 to league leaders Bayern Munich at the end of last month. The defeat leaves Wolfsburg outside the top six while Hoffenheim remain two points from safety. Hoffenheim's win pushed bottom side Hanover 96 closer to relegation as they suffered a 2-0 defeat at home to Cologne with Leonardo Bittencourt scoring both goals. Eintracht Frankfurt's new coach Niko Kovac suffered a 3-0 defeat on his Bundesliga debut as his side were humbled at Borussia Moenchengladbach to stay in the relegation places. Kovac, who coached Croatia to the 2014 World Cup and took over after Armin Veh was sacked last Sunday, made four changes to the starting line-up, but it did little to stop Frankfurt going eight games without a win. Hanover's Lars Stindl opened the scoring by drilling in his shot on 36 minutes and the hosts doubled their lead when Raffael casually curled home a clearance kick from Frankfurt goalkeeper Lukas Hradecky on 53 minutes. Gladbach's Syria-born midfielder Mahmoud Dahoud added Gladbach's third 11 minutes from time after a mistake from Frankfurt midfielder Stefan Reinartz. A foul on South Korea midfielder Ja-Cheol Koo in the dying stages of Augsburg's 2-2 draw at Darmstadt led to his side taking a crucial point. Darmstadt took a 2-0 lead through Sandro Wagner and Mario Vrancic before Augsburg hit back with goals from Markus Feulner and a penalty by Alfred Finnbogason after Koo was fouled with a minute left to play. Things remain tight in the relegation battle with three points now separating five teams. Australia striker Mathew Leckie scored only his second goal of the season as he headed home from close range in mid-table Ingolstadt's 3-3 draw at home to Stuttgart. German league leaders Bayern Munich host Werder Bremen on Saturday night while second-placed Borussia Dortmund host Mainz on Sunday. On Friday, Hertha Berlin cemented third place in the table with a 2-0 win over nearest rivals Schalke thanks to goals from defender Niklas Stark and striker Vedad Ibisevic."
64,28/02/2016,19:49,Aubameyang seals Dortmund's late fightback win,Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang netted again as Borussia Dortmund scored three goals in the final ten minutes for a dramatic 3-1 comeback win over ten-man Hoffenheim on Sunday in the Bundesliga.,"Hoffenheim captain Sebastian Rudy gave his side the lead in Dortmund before being sent off and the hosts were just ten minutes from their first home defeat of the season. The game turned when Rudy was shown a straight red card -- on his 26th birthday -- for bringing down Aubameyang, who was through on goal, on 58 minutes. Winger Henrikh Mkhitaryan spared Dortmund's blushes with an 80th-minute equaliser before substitute Adrian Ramos headed Lukasz Piszczek's cross home on 85 minutes. Mkhitaryan then laid on the third when he sprinted clear, drew Hoffenheim keeper Oliver Baumann and passed for Aubameyang to tap home in the second minute of stoppage time. It was the 22nd goal of the season for the Gabon striker, who is one behind the league's top scorer, Bayern Munich's Robert Lewandowski. The win allows second-placed Borussia to trim Bayern's lead at the top of the table to eight points before next Saturday's top of the table clash against Pep Guardiola's Bavarians in Dortmund. Hoffenheim remain second from bottom and four points from safety. Borussia Moenchengladbach went fourth after a fightback earned a 2-2 draw at Augsburg. Brazilian striker Raffael had sent Gladbach into a half-time lead before the game exploded into life with three goals in five second-half minutes. Despite their midweek Europa League exit at the hands of Liverpool, Augsburg, who are 13th, roared back with two goals in quick succession. Iceland striker Alfred Finnbogason thumped a header home on 50 minutes, his first goal since joining from Olympiakos, before Brazil winger Caiuby slotted neatly home just three minutes later. Gladbach's American winger Fabian Johnson gave the perfect response as he smashed home his shot on 55 minutes to make it 2-2. The visitors should have won as Sweden's Oscar Wendt fired wide late on while only a Marwin Hitz save denied Borussia captain Granit Xhaka. Mainz warmed up for Wednesday's league game at Bayern by moving up to fifth with a 3-1 win at home to Bayer Leverkusen. Mainz's Yunus Malli and Jhon Cordoba netted first half goals, then Malli netted a second-half penalty, before Javier Hernandez pulled a goal back. On Saturday, Bayern continued their seemingly unstoppable march to an historic fourth consecutive league title with a 2-0 win at Wolfsburg. Guardiola's outfit now have 62 points out of a possible 69, their tally exactly double that of Wolfsburg, who are eighth. A tight struggle was settled by second-half goals from Kingsley Coman and Lewandowski, who netted his 33rd goal in all competitions. Elsewhere, bottom side Hanover gained ground in the relegation battle with a shock 2-1 win at Stuttgart after an eight-match losing streak. Japan midfielder Hiroshi Kiyotake capped his first start since November after injury by setting up both goals for defender Christian Schulz. It means just four points separate the bottom three sides, but Hanover remain five points from safety. Hamburg drew 1-1 at home to Ingolstadt while Werder Bremen are deep in the relegation battle despite their 2-2 draw at home to Darmstadt. On Friday, Hertha Berlin strengthened their grip on third place with a 1-0 victory at Cologne as Vedad Ibisevic scored the winner to break their run of six games without a win."
65,26/02/2016,02:15,Wolfsburg aim to stop Lewandowski making more history,Wolfsburg are desperate to stop history repeating itself when they host Bundesliga leaders Bayern Munich on Saturday following Robert Lewandowski's historic five-gaul haul in the reverse fixture.,"The Poland striker came off the bench and sent Bundesliga records tumbling with his nine-minute blitz single-handedly propelling Bayern to a 5-1 thrashing of Wolfsburg at Munich's Allianz Arena last September. Injury and illness mean Wolfsburg have 12 players either ruled out or struggling to be fit to face Pep Guardiola's league leaders at the Volkswagen Arena. Bayern are eight points clear of second-placed Borussia Dortmund -- and a massive 28 ahead of eighth-placed Wolfsburg. Between them Lewandowski and fellow Bayern forward Thomas Mueller have scored a combined tally of 39 Bundesliga goals -- more than the entire Wolfsburg team. Wolfsburg's ex-Bayern defender Dante says the only way to stop Lewandowski is to cut off his supply. ""If we defend as a team and the ball doesn't come to him, then he can't really do anything,"" said the Brazilian. ""We have to really get things going and be up for the game. ""We have to go into each one-on-one with real passion and every pass must hit the target."" Four days after their 2-2 draw at Juventus in the Champions League, Guardiola is set to rotate his Bayern squad, especially with defenders Holger Badstuber, Jerome Boateng and Javi Martinez all sidelined. Winger Franck Ribery could start his first Bundesliga game for a year, while Wolfsburg coach Dieter Hecking could be down to his third-choice goalkeeper with Diego Benaglio injured and Koen Casteels recovering from flu. On Sunday evening, Dortmund host rejuvented strugglers Hoffenheim. Thomas Tuchel's side is a force to be reckoned with and are unbeaten this season at their Signal Iduna Park stadium having picked up 28 points from a possible 30 at home. Second-from-bottom Hoffenheim earned fresh hope in the relegation battle when they claimed a 3-2 win over Mainz last weekend under their 28-year-old coach Julian Nagelsmann. Dortmund will be without Greek centre-back Sokratis, who is sidelined for three weeks with a groin injury, and Neven Subotic is set to take his place. Hertha Berlin are at Cologne on Friday night hoping to end their run of five league games without a win despite staying third in the table. Hertha coach Pal Dardai will be counting on Ivory Coast striker Salomon Kalou to add to his tally of eight goals scored away from home, the most on the road for any Bundesliga player. Bayer Leverkusen will not have coach Roger Schmidt on their bench for Sunday's match at Mainz. The 48-year-old is banned for three league games, and was fined 20,000 euros ($22,031), for refusing a referee's order to leave the touchline during last Sunday's 1-0 league defeat at home to Dortmund. Mainz are up to seventh in the table and are unbeaten in their last five home games, while Leverkusen's defeat to Dortmund broke their six-game unbeaten run.

With Hoffenheim second from bottom, Nagelsmann earned a point on his Bundesliga debut in last weekend's 1-1 draw at Werder Bremen. But he was delighted when his team sealed a comeback win at home to Mainz, even though Spanish midfielder Jairo's late goal for the guests meant a nervous last 12 minutes. ""In the closing stages, I felt like I looked at my wristwatch about 7,000 times, but it didn't go any faster,"" said a visibly-relieved Nagelsmann. The win left Hoffenheim just three points from safety, but facing tough games against Europa League sides Borussia Dortmund and Augsburg in the coming fortnight. ""It's a start and the table looks a little bit nicer,"" said Nagelsmann, whose playing career was ended by a knee injury at just 20. ""Nevertheless, we're still second from bottom and we want to get away from there fast. We need more games like that to collect the points we need."" Nagelsmann has breathed life back into his struggling side, who produced a good attacking display and fought back despite falling behind with just 11 minutes gone. Colombia striker Jhon Cordoba scored for Mainz, but the hosts roared back as Nadiem Amiri levelled, then winger Mark Uth netted twice. Jairo's 78th minute goal made it 3-2, but Hoffenheim held on and Nagelsmann was praised for putting emphasis on attack. ""Everyone here can identify one hundred percent with this style of playing -- it's a style which suits Hoffenheim,"" said Germany winger Kevin Volland, who had his best game for months. ""The coach has played an extremely large part in that. He has given us confidence and courage."""

Despite the draw, Hoffenheim remain six points from safety, and second from bottom, as they look to avoid relegation after eight years in Germany's top flight. After his predecessor Huub Stevens stood down on Wednesday with heart problems, Nagelsmann was handed a contract until June 2019 and tasked with keeping Hoffenheim up.

In his absence, Mkhitaryan showed superb individual skill for the winner at Dortmund's Signal Iduna Park. With Marcel Schmelzer screaming up in support on his left, Mkhitaryan cut back inside and curled his right-footed shot around Hanover's Germany goalkeeper Ron-Robert Zieler on 57 minutes. With Pep Guardiola's Bayern at Augsburg on Sunday, Dortmund remain second while Hanover are rooted to the bottom, seven points from safety. Wolfsburg warmed up for Wednesday's Champions League, last 16, first-leg at Ghent with a 2-0 win at home to Ingolstadt to pick up their first victory since knocking Manchester United out of Europe in December. Dieter Hecking's Wolfsburg won for the first time in six games but stay eighth after first-half goals goals by Germany midfielder Julian Draxler and defender Robin Knoche. Bayer Leverkusen moved up from seventh to third as they bounced back from their shock German Cup exit at the hands of Werder Bremen in mid-week with a 2-1 comeback win at Darmstadt. On a heavy pitch, Sandro Wagner stabbed the ball home to give Darmstadt an early lead, despite Leverkusen goalkeeper Bernd Leno catching him around the throat with his forearm. Leverkusen drew level when Darmstadt defender Aytac Sulu headed into his own net on 62 minutes. The visitors then took the lead with a sweeping move which went the length of the pitch. From a Darmstadt corner, junior Julian Brandt started the move he finished by tapping home Kevin Kampl's final pass for the winner on 77 minutes. VfB Stuttgart's impressive form continued as they picked up their fifth-straight league win to go ninth with a 2-0 win at home to Hertha Berlin. A long-range strike from Ivory Coast defensive midfielder Serey Die and a second-half goal from left-wing Filip Kostic sealed the hosts' win. Hertha suffered their first defeat in nine games since losing 2-0 at Bayern in November to drop to fourth. The youngest manager in Bundesliga history made his debut when Julian Nagelsmann, 28, was on Hoffenheim's bench for their 1-1 draw at Werder Bremen in the basement battle. Nagelsmann took over after predecessor Huub Stevens resigned on Wednesday due to heart problems. Despite Hoffenheim taking the lead on 10 minutes through Croatia striker Andrej Kramaric, Werder hit back three minutes later as former Chelsea defender Papy Djilobodji scored his first Bremen goal.

Nagelsmann was due to take charge for the 2015-16 season, but circumstance led to his promotion having coached Hoffenheim's successful Under-19 team. With his new team second from bottom of the table, Nagelsmann took Hoffenheim's training on Thursday for the first time knowing defeat in Bremen will dent their hopes of staying up.

Hoffenheim are second from bottom of the table and in serious danger of being relegated after eight seasons in Germany's top flight. The club has already appointed youth team trainer Julian Nagelsmann as head coach of the senior side for next season and, if the club stays up, he will become the youngest coach in Bundesliga history at just 28 years of age. Their 2-0 defeat at home to Darmstadt on Sunday was the final straw for Stevens. The 62-year-old Dutchman, who only had a contract until the end of the season, had forged a reputation for keeping struggling teams up after rescuing Stuttgart last season. He only took over from Markus Gisdol in October with the club, backed by billionaire software mogul Dietmar Hopp, in their current league position of 17th."

The Poland striker gave Bayern the lead at Munich's Allianz Arena after blasting home Douglas Costa's low cross on 32 minutes. He doubled his tally with some clinical finishing after a superb through ball from Bayern captain Philipp Lahm on 64 minutes. It could have been three as Chile midfielder Arturo Vidal hit the post. Hoffenheim remain second from bottom as they failed to secure their maiden win over Bayern at the 16th attempt. There was bad news for Bayern coach Pep Guardiola before kick-off as Javi Martinez dropped out with a knee injury. It forced Guardiola into playing a three-man defence leaving Holger Badstuber as their only fit centre-back with Jerome Boateng and Medhi Benatia currently sidelined. Their Champions League last 16, first-leg clash at Juventus is just three weeks away with the return leg in Munich on March 16. Meanwhile, Wolfsburg remain winless in their four games since beating Manchester United in the Champions League after being held to a 1-1 draw at home to Cologne. Wolfsburg face Belgian side Gent in the away leg of their last-16 tie in Europe on February 17. But Dieter Hecking's side have now lost two and drawn two in their last four games since knocking United out of the Champions League with a 3-2 win last December. The hosts went ahead when right-winger Vieirinha fired in a cross, which found Julian Draxler unmarked for the Germany international to fire home on 67 minutes. Cologne equalised eight minutes later when Anthony Modeste curled his shot around Wolves 'keeper Diego Benaglio. The result left Wolfsburg seventh -- outside the European places for next season -- and Cologne ninth. On Saturday, Dortmund enjoyed a 2-0 win over Ingolstadt to go ten points clear of third-placed Hertha Berlin. Dortmund could consider themselves fortunate though as captain Mats Hummels escaped a red card for a foul in the area. He then scored a second-half own-goal, which the referee refused to award to Ingolstadt after a foul in the build-up, before Aubameyang struck twice. Hertha threw away a 2-0 lead as hosts Werder Bremen roared back with three goals in ten second-half minutes to claim a point in a 3-3 draw. Ivory Coast veteran Salomon Kalou struck Berlin's third goal to leave Hertha 3-1 up in Bremen with 20 minutes left. Then Bremen veteran Claudio Pizarro netted a penalty before defender Santiago Garcia fired in a shot which was later credited to Pizarro, who nudged the ball over the line to level the scores. Bayer Leverkusen climbed to fourth with a 3-0 win at Hanover 96, who dropped to the bottom, with Javier Hernandez scoring twice in the romp. 'Chicharito' converted a penalty, then drilled home his 13th league goal in 16 matches. Schalke had youth to thank for their 2-0 win at Darmstadt as dynamic midfielders Max Meyer and Leroy Sane, who are both 20, scored either side of half-time. The win left the Royal Blues fifth in the table. Schalke and Leverkusen's wins meant Borussia Moenchengladbach slid from fourth to sixth after Friday's 1-0 defeat to mid-table Mainz. Mid-table sides Augsburg and Eintracht Frankfurt fought out a goalless draw in Bavaria. Strugglers Stuttgart are two points clear of the relegation places after their dramatic 2-1 win at home to mid-table Hamburg thanks to a late goal from new signing Artem Kravets."
72,29/01/2016,02:01,Bayern host Hoffenheim amidst reports of unrest,"Bayern Munich host strugglers Hoffenheim for Sunday's league match in rude health atop the table, but with cracks apparently appearing behind the scenes.","Kicker has reported a member of Bayern's squad has broken ranks by admitting the atmosphere is ""not good"" in the squad as coach Pep Guardiola tightens control. The mole has told the German magazine that the squad is unhappy after being sent an email, which says they must now officially register their movements on days off to avoid any meaningless travel. The Spaniard, who will quit in June, is also said to have told his players he expects more professionalism from them and has even discussed introducing a curfew. Guardiola is said to be increasing the pressure as he strives to sign off his three years in Munich with the treble of Champions League, Bundesliga and German Cup titles. Bayern are suffering from what forward Thomas Mueller has described as 'disease of the boot' after Jerome Boateng became the 14th player to be injured this season. The Germany defender is out indefinitely with a groin injury, leaving Guardiola with Javi Martinez and Holger Badstuber as his only fit centre-backs. Second-from-bottom Hoffenheim are desperate for points under caretaker coach Huub Stevens and have managed just six from a possible 15 in their last five games. The Sinsheim-based club are four points adrift of the first non-relegation spot in the Bundesliga table and have never beaten Bayern in any of their 15 matches with 11 wins for the Bavarians and four draws. Nevertheless, the weekend promises to see Bayern's Robert Lewandowski and Borussia Dortmund's Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang resume their battle to be the league's top scorer. Lewandowski scored twice in Bayern's 2-1 win at Hamburg last Friday to move within a goal of Aubameyang's 18 goals in 18 league games. Second-placed Dortmund host mid-table Ingolstadt with Aubameyang looking to get back to goal-scoring ways after a series of misses last time out. Dortmund's dynamic midfield trio of Marco Reus, Henrikh Mkhitaryan and Ilkay Gundogan were superb in last Saturday's 3-1 win at Borussia Moenchengladbach. With 17 goals and 13 assists between them, the trio have conspired to be involved in an impressive 60 per cent of Dortmund's 50 league goals so far this term. Each player capped impressive individual displays in Gladbach with a goal and an assist while Aubameyang had a rare off night. Borussia have won all seven games in which the 25-year-old Reus has found the net in this season's Bundesliga. Mkhitaryan has been a revelation on the right wing this season, weighing in with 12 assists and seven league goals for a haul of 16 goals and 20 assists in all competitions. Germany international Gundogan is back to his best after a chronic spinal problem restricted him to just one game in the 2013/14 season. But visitors Ingolstadt have said they will not be intimated by the atmosphere at Dortmund's 80,000-capacity Signal Iduna Park stadium. So far, 12 of their 23 points have come on the road after earning draws at both Schalke and Gladbach, while they lost only 2-0 at Bayern in December. ""Anyone who knows us, and has seen our away statistics, knows the higher the pressure, the cooler and more successful we are,"" insisted Ingolstadt coach Ralph Hasenhuettl. Third-placed Hertha Berlin need points to close the eight-point gap behind Dortmund at Werder on Saturday after being held to a goalless draw by Augsburg last weekend. Bremen are 16th, amidst the relegation places, but were buoyed by a 3-1 win at Schalke last Sunday when captain Clemens Fritz, 35, rolled back the years with a goal and two assists.

Bayern show no signs of loosening their iron-grip on the Bundesliga title as they picked up their 13th win from 14 league games to give them 40 from a possible 42 points. This was the first time in eight home games that Bayern failed to score at least four goals. Bayern coach Pep Guardiola experimented with the starting line-up by pushing Germany centre-back Jerome Boateng into a midfield role, which led to their second goal. They took the lead at Munich's Allianz Arena when Chile midfielder Arturo Vidal's cross found Medhi Benatia, whose shot was heading wide, but Mueller was on hand to head home on 34 minutes. Bayern doubled their lead on 41 minutes when Boateng lobbed the ball into Javi Martinez, whose pass found Coman and the French winger did the rest to make it 2-0 at the break. Hertha, who last won in Munich in 1977, are in fifth place after Borussia Moechengladbach leap-frogged them into fourth with a 3-3 draw at Hoffenheim. Gladbach's head coach Andre Schubert preserved his nine-game unbeaten record in the lead since taking charge two months ago. Borussia took an early lead thanks to USA international Fabian Johnson, who then scored their equaliser to rescue a point. Hoffenheim, chasing their first win since September, took a 3-1 lead just after the break thanks to goals by Steven Zuber, Eugen Polanski and Nadiem Amiri. But Swiss striker Josip Drmic pulled it back to 3-2 for Gladbach before Johnson claimed his second with a superb shot three minutes from time. Hamburg are up to sixth after their 3-1 win at Werder Bremen in the north German derby. Hamburg raced into an early 2-0 lead as Croatia midfielder Ivo Ilicevic scored on their opening attack, then striker Michael Gregoritsch doubled their lead on 26 minutes. Nigeria's Anthony Ujah pulled a goal back for Werder on 62 minutes, then Germany forward Nicolai Mueller made it 3-1 to Hamburg on 68 minutes when Ilicevic's final pass put him in behind the hosts' defence. Hanover eased the pressure on coach Michael Frontzeck with a 4-0 thumping at home to Ingolstadt which lifted them up to 14th and pulled them away from the relegation zone. Japan striker Yoshinori Muto scored his seventh goal of the season in Mainz's 2-1 win at Eintracht Frankfurt.

Hertha profited most from the winter weather when Hoffenheim defender Eugen Polanski got a slight touch on the ball, which he headed into his own net on 30 minutes when trying to clear a free-kick. The pitch was cleared of snow during the break and the result masked a poor result for Berlin, who managed just a single shot all game, while the defeat leaves Hoffenheim at the foot of the table. On Saturday, Javi Martinez scored his first goal since August 2013 for Bayern Munich as their 3-1 win at Schalke 04 opened an eight-point lead in the table. After second-placed Borussia Dortmund's shock 3-1 defeat at Hamburg on Friday, Pep Guardiola's Bayern took their chance to extend their lead. David Alaba's early goal was cancelled out by Schalke's Max Meyer before Martinez, then Thomas Mueller struck for Bayern. Germany striker Max Kruse netted twice in Wolfsburg's 6-0 rout of Werder Bremen, who gifted the opener when defender Alejandro Galvez slid the ball into his own net on 11 minutes. Kruse put third-placed Wolfsburg 2-0 up at the break by heading home a free-kick then Portugal international Vierinha netted on 56 minutes. The floodgates opened when France midfielder Josuha Guilavogui, on for the injured Brazil star Luiz Gustavo, stabbed home his shot, Kruse then set up Netherlands striker Bas Dost on 78 minutes. He completed the scoring three minutes from time by converting a cross and the result leaves Wolfsburg five points behind Dortmund. Borussia Moenchengladbach are fifth as Andre Schubert celebrated his first match in charge as head coach with a 2-1 win at home to Hanover 96 thanks to goals by forwards Ibrahima Traore and Raffael.

Augsburg climbed off the bottom of the table with an emphatic 4-0 win at VfB Stuttgart as woeful defending by the hosts allowed the visitors to take an early 2-0 lead with both goals by midfielder Alexander Esswein. Defender Jan-Ingwer Callsen-Bracker grabbed a third before former South Korea captain Koo Ja-Cheol scored Augsburg's fourth when he hit the top right-hand corner from 10 metres out on 54 minutes.

And rising talent Nagelsmann has been entrusted with the head coach's job from the start of July 2016, with his three-year contract set to start just before his 29th birthday. He will continue coaching the club's Under-19 side for the rest of this season. ""This is the most logical and consistent decision,"" said Hoffenheim's multi-millionaire backer Dietmar Hopp. ""We want to continue to set standards in our youth teams' work and the same goes for our coaches."" It is a sign of Nagelsmann's prowess that Bayern Munich tried to poach him to coach their Under-17 team after he steered Hoffenheim's Under-19 team to the 2013/14 German title. ""I am looking forward to this exciting task and I'm grateful in advance for the trust placed in me and for this opportunity,"" said Nagelsmann, who has said he will give no further interviews until taking over from Stevens. The self-declared perfectionist has just qualified with the highest possible mark in earning his senior coaches licence. To ensure Nagelsmann has the chance to make Bundesliga history, Stevens has been tasked with keeping Hoffenheim in Germany's top flight after they have taken just six points from their first 10 games. Having previously saved Hamburg and Stuttgart from relegation during his career, the 61-year-old took charge of training at Hoffenheim on Tuesday. ""I don't believe the team belongs down there,"" said Stevens when asked about relegation. ""If we come together, we have the chance to come away from the bottom places.""

Dortmund had their 11-match winning run ended as they failed to match the Bavarians' six straight wins, giving Pep Guardiola's side a psychological advantage for the Dortmund-Bayern clash in Munich on Sunday week. Second-placed Dortmund found themselves 1-0 down at Hoffenheim when Germany international Sebastian Rudy netted just before the break. But Dortmund coach Thomas Tuchel brought on defensive midfielder Ilkay Gundogan and Henrikh Mkhitaryan and the equaliser followed soon after. Midfielder Gonzalo Castro chested down Mats Hummels pass and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang stabbed home his seventh goal in six league games on 55 minutes. It was the perfect time to score just moments after Hoffenheim's Chile international Eduardo Vargas had hit the post after beating Dortmund goalkeeper Roman Buerki, but Borussia could not force a winner. Ex-Manchester United striker Javier Hernandez scored his first goal in the Bundesliga with the winner for his new club Bayer Leverkusen to seal their 1-0 win over Mainz. It ended his side's three-match losing streak in the German league. Having already scored for Leverkusen in the Champions League, 'Chicharito' produced a superb solo effort with a darting run before showing clinical finishing on 69 minutes. The Mexican made way for Stefan Kiessling soon afterwards, but ex-Dortmund midfielder Kevin Kampl hit the post as Leverkusen came within a whisker of a second in the final ten minutes. Schalke are third after Cameroon centre-back Joel Matip headed home from a corner, then Leroy Sane scored late on, his second in as games, to seal their 2-0 home victory against Eintracht Frankfurt, fortheir third consecutive win. Borussia Moenchengladbach climbed off the bottom of the league with their first win after five straight defeats with a 4-2 victory over Augsburg under caretaker coach Andre Schubert, following Lucien Favre's shock resignation.

85,23/03/2015,13:01,Concussed Kim misses out on South Korea duty,"Hoffenheim's South Korean left-back Kim Jin-Su has been ruled out of international duty with concussion, his Bundesliga club said Monday, but Korean coach Uli Stielike is demanding a doctor's note.","Kim, 22, is said to have suffered the injury in Saturday's goalless draw with Paderborn, but managed to complete the full 90 minutes of the German league match. He will miss South Korea's internationals against Uzbekistan on March 27 in Daejeon and against New Zealand in Seoul on March 31. Hoffenheim initially requested Kim not be selected for the matches as the club wanted to keep the defender in Germany after he had missed most of January while on Asian Cup duty and he has already played eight league matches in 2015. But the the request was turned down and Korea's German coach Stielike has said he wants to see a doctor's certificate confirming Kim's injury. ""We will request a medical certificate and ensure our people talk directly with him,"" Stielike told German magazine Kicker. Hoffenheim coach Markus Gisdol had previously attacked Stielike on Friday when he said: ""It's crazy, I am sure there are a few other defenders in South Korea who could play in the friendlies."" Stielike had called up five South Korean internationals from the Bundesliga including Kim, Son Heung-Min from Bayer Leverkusen, Koo Ja-Cheol and Park Joo-Ho from Mainz 05 and Ji Dong-Won from Augsburg."

87,21/12/2014,17:49,Hertha's Brooks endures Hoffenheim horror,Hertha Berlin defender John Brooks had a Bundesliga afternoon to forget after giving away his side's first two goals in their 5-0 thrashing at home to Hoffenheim on Sunday.,"The USA international turned the ball into his own net on 23 minutes at Berlin's Olympic Stadium, then gave away a penalty three minutes later when he fouled Hoffenheim striker Sven Schipplock. Bosnia midfielder Sejad Salihovic drilled home the penalty, but things went from bad to worse for Berlin. Brook's team-mate Nico Schulz was unlucky to concede a penalty after nudging Hoffenheim captain Andreas Beck who dropped to the pitch on 39 minutes and Salihovic converted his second spot-kick. Hertha failed to put up a fight in the second-half as Schipplock added to the hosts' misery when he walked the ball into an empty net on 74 minutes after Hoffenheim ripped the Berlin defence to pieces on a counter-attack. Germany international Sebastian Rudy then came off the Hoffenheim bench to grab their fifth goal. This was seventh-placed Hoffenheim's biggest victory in their seven years in Germany's top flight while Hertha, 13th, have now leaked nine goals in their last two games after drawing 4-4 at Eintracht Frankfurt on Wednesday. On Saturday, Borussia Dortmund's Bundesliga crisis deepened as they suffered their tenth defeat of the season in losing 2-1 at fellow strugglers Werder Bremen to drop to second from bottom. Bremen's 19-year-old striker Davie Selke curled in a superb early goal from 15 metres out, then Bremen midfielder Fin Bartels converted Selke's cross on 62 minutes. Dortmund's Mats Hummels pulled a goal back when he headed home unmarked at a corner, but it was no more than a consolation. Second-placed Wolfsburg fought back to claim a 2-1 home win against mid-table Cologne later which trimmed Bayern Munich's lead at the top of the table back to 11 points. Defender Dominic Maroh gave Cologne a shock lead after just 11 minutes before Dutch striker Bas Dost equalised five minutes later. Brazil defender Naldo, who scored Wolfsburg's equaliser in their 2-2 draw at Dortmund on Wednesday, then headed the winner from a corner 12 minutes from time. Bayer Leverkusen stay third after coming from behind for a 1-1 draw at home to Eintracht Frankfurt. Eintracht captain Alexander Meier converted a penalty to make him the league's top scorer with 13 goals in 16 games before Leverkusen's Germany winger Karim Bellarabi equalised seven minutes from time. Roberto di Matteo's Schalke 04 stay fifth after being held to a goalless draw at home to Hamburg. Stuttgart remain above the bottom three places after their goalless draw at home to Paderborn. Augsburg fought back for a 2-1 win at home to Borussia Moenchengladbach, who took the lead after only two minutes when Max Kruse converted a penalty before midfielder Markus Feulner and striker Raul Bobadilla scored either side of half-time. On Friday, Bayern broke more league records as Bastian Schweinsteiger and Arjen Robben scored in their 2-1 comeback win at Mainz after Colombia midfielder Elkin Soto had given the hosts' a shock first-half lead. The Mainz result saw Bayern claim new records for the fewest goals conceded in the first-half of a Bundesliga season and their 11-point lead after 17 games is also a new best mark."
88,03/12/2014,16:40,Hoffenheim showdown is Dortmund's 'High Noon',"Borussia Dortmund coach Jurgen Klopp says Friday's clash with Hoffenheim is a ""High Noon"" showdown for the Bundesliga's bottom side to prove they can turn around their dire league form.","Dortmund are enduring the worst start to a league season in their history and last Sunday's 2-0 loss at Eintracht Frankfurt was their eighth defeat in 13 league games. But Klopp says his side must show their mettle and has threatened to make changes against seventh-placed Hoffenheim with Dortmund having claimed only 11 from a possible 39 points. ""Friday is our High Noon. We have to show what we are made of,"" Klopp said in Wednesday's press conference. ""We are trying to find out in training who can withstand this situation and will make our selection accordingly."" With Dortmund already through to the Champions League's last 16, Klopp admits his side's problem comes down to attitude having lost to the likes of Hamburg, Cologne, Hanover 96 and Frankfurt, who Borussia would have comfortably beaten last season. Klopp is hoping to have his options boosted by the possible return of Poland winger Jakub Blaszczykowski and Dortmund captain Mats Hummels from a knee and sprained ankle injury respectively. Klopp has been given a job guarantee by Dortmund chief executive Hans-Joachim Watzke until his contract expires in 2018. The 47-year-old, who led Dortmund to the Bundesliga title in 2011 and 2012, as well as the 2013 Champions League final, has said he is 'responsible' for getting Borussia out of trouble and has vowed not to quit."
89,19/10/2014,17:41,Hoffenheim miss out on second in Hamburg draw,Hoffenheim missed out on reclaiming second in the Bundesliga after Sunday's 1-1 draw at strugglers Hamburg while leaders Bayern Munich finish the weekend four-points clear after hammering Werder Bremen.,"Hoffenheim took an early lead as Anthony Modeste coolly slotted home in the 15th minute, but hosts Hamburg, who are third from bottom, hit back when Pierre-Michel Lasogga showed superb finishing on 34 minutes. The former Germany Under-21 international had several chances in the second-half and clipped the crossbar with 10 minutes left to leave Hoffenheim, Bayern, Mainz and Moenchengladbach as the league's only unbeaten teams. The point lifts Hamburg up to 16th in the table, while Hoffenheim are third after Borussia Moenchengladbach moved up to second with Saturday's 3-0 win at Hanover 96 when Germany striker Max Kruse scored twice."
90,19/08/2014,02:05,Germany riding crest of wave as Bundesliga begins,The new Bundesliga season gets underway this weekend with German football riding the crest of a wave following the national team's triumph at the World Cup in Brazil last month.,"That thoroughly deserved victory, given to Joachim Loew's side by Mario Goetze's extra-time strike in the final against Argentina, saw a unified Germany crowned as world champions for the first time. But at club level, the Bundesliga has been leading the way for some time. It averaged 3.16 goals per game last season, considerably more than any of its major European counterparts, while average gates were over 42,000, making the German top flight the best attended league anywhere. ""In my opinion, the Bundesliga's the most attractive league in the world,"" Borussia Moenchengladbach coach Lucien Favre told bundesliga.com. ""The hype in Germany is amazing, and now they've won the World Cup so it's not going to tail off in a rush."" Nevertheless, the biggest problem facing the Bundesliga, as ever, is how to counter the dominance of Bayern Munich, who have romped to the title and added the German Cup in each of the last two campaigns. They have seen Toni Kroos and Mario Mandzukic depart and lost Javi Martinez to a serious knee injury in last week's SuperCup defeat to Borussia Dortmund, but the Bavarians remain favourites. And yet the rest can draw some hope from the very fact this is a Bundesliga season immediately following a World Cup, and that has not tended to help Bayern in the recent past. After Germany hosted the 2006 World Cup, Stuttgart went on to win the Bundesliga, while in 2011 Dortmund pipped Bayern to the title. In 2009, after Germany reached the Euro 2008 final, it was Wolfsburg who were champions. Six members of Pep Guardiola's squad played in the World Cup final, including Goetze, while Dante and Arjen Robben were also involved until the latter stages in Brazil. That is why chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge wanted the start of the new season delayed in order to give these players longer to prepare, but that request was unsurprisingly turned down by Bayern's rivals. ""We have to face the fact that the first half of the season will be difficult,"" said Guardiola, who at times had only a skeleton squad in pre-season training. ""We are at least one month behind schedule."" Guardiola has added to his squad with compatriots Juan Bernat from Valencia and Pepe Reina, who will provide competition in goal for Manuel Neuer. But the marquee signing was Robert Lewandowski, a prolific goalscorer for Dortmund in the last four years. However, Dortmund have moved to replace the Pole by signing Italy striker Ciro Immobile from Torino and Colombia's Adrian Ramos from Hertha Berlin. Stability is key at the Signal Iduna Park, where coach Jurgen Klopp, who led Dortmund to back-to-back titles in 2011 and 2012 and a Champions League final defeat to Bayern in 2013, is entering his seventh season in charge. ""We want to establish ourselves further at the top of the league and qualify directly for the Champions League,"" said sporting director Michael Zorc modestly. However, Guardiola knows where the danger lies, saying: ""We may have won the last two league titles, but they clinched the previous two. Our great challenge is to keep up our level to keep them at distance."" Beneath them, Schalke, Bayer Leverkusen and Wolfsburg will again be hoping to contend for Champions League qualification at least. Schalke have kept Klaas-Jan Huntelaar and Julian Draxler, while Sidney Sam has joined from Leverkusen, and few teams can boast a midfield as strong as Wolfsburg, with Kevin de Bruyne, Luiz Gustavo and France's Josuha Guilavogui. Bayer have signed Swiss striker Josip Drmic from Nuremberg and have a new coach in Roger Schmidt, back in his native country after winning the Austrian title with Salzburg. Hamburg will be hoping for a stable campaign after almost being relegated for the first time in their history last season. There are new coaches at Mainz, Eintracht Frankfurt and Stuttgart, who have reappointed Armin Veh, the architect of their 2007 title triumph, while Cologne are back among the elite and Paderborn are in the Bundesliga for the first time."
91,17/08/2014,18:39,"Holders Bayern claim Cup win, Hoffenheim hit nine",Bayern Munich began their defence of the German Cup with a comfortable 4-1 first-round win away to third-tier side Preussen Munster on Sunday.,"Pep Guardiola's starting line-up was deprived of the injured Bastian Schweinsteiger and there was no Franck Ribery, but it did feature five members of the Germany side that won the World Cup five weeks ago. The man who scored the winning goal against Argentina at the Maracana, Mario Goetze, opened the scoring for Bayern with a header from a Robert Lewandowski cross, before Thomas Mueller doubled their lead. David Alaba and Claudio Pizarro added further efforts in the second half but Lewandowski, chasing his first goal for the club since his move from Borussia Dormtund, had a late penalty saved. Four days after losing Spanish international Javi Martinez to a serious knee injury in their German SuperCup defeat to Borussia Dortmund, Guardiola handed a start in defence to Holger Badstuber, who has been out injured for the last 20 months. Meanwhile, Hoffenheim won 9-0 away to fifth-tier amateurs Paloma in Hamburg, with Sven Schipplock scoring five of the goals. However, Werder Bremen required extra time before winning 3-2 away to fifth-tier opposition in Illertissen. Dortmund and Bayer Leverkusen also progressed this weekend, but top-flight sides Mainz and VfB Stuttgart fell by the wayside."
