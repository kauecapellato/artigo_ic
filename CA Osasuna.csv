0,11/01/2021,17:03,Real Madrid finally leave Pamplona after snow disruption,Real Madrid's players were finally able to leave Pamplona on Monday after being stuck in the Spanish city for three nights due to the heavy snowstorm that hit the country over the weekend.,"The team flew straight to Malaga, without returning to their homes in Madrid, to get ready for Thursday's Spanish Super Cup semi-final against Athletic Bilbao. Madrid's players arrived in Pamplona on Friday for their La Liga game against Osasuna on Saturday, which finished 0-0. But the dreadful weather conditions meant travel links were disrupted and they were unable to return to the capital either after the game or on Sunday. Real Madrid departed on Monday morning and landed in Malaga, where they will have a light training session on Monday night, the first of three sessions before the game on Thursday. But the preparation is far from ideal for Zinedine Zidane's side, whose draw against Osasuna meant they missed the chance to overtake Atletico Madrid at the top of La Liga. Zidane complained about the state of the pitch at the El Sadar stadium, where a light dusting of snow made playing conditions difficult. ""For me this was not a football match,"" said Zidane, who was convinced the fixture should have been called off. Goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois criticised La Liga for allowing the game to go ahead. ""They need to realise that footballers are human beings,"" said Courtois. ""We travelled to the stadium with the motorway deep in snow. You have to think about people's safety. All of us have families who worry about us."" Schools were closed throughout Madrid on Monday, where between 20 and 30 centimetres of snow fell on Saturday, the heaviest snowfall in the city since 1971."
1,10/01/2021,12:20,'That's not football': Zidane blasts snow-hit pitch as Real Madrid held,"Zinedine Zidane said Real Madrid's goalless draw with Osasuna on Saturday was ""not a football match"" and should have been called off after Spain was hit by a snowstorm.","Madrid missed the chance to overtake Atletico Madrid at the top of La Liga and allowed Barcelona to creep closer after Lionel Messi scored twice in a 4-0 victory over Granada. Atletico's match at home to Athletic Bilbao earlier on Saturday was postponed due to the snow, meaning Diego Simeone's side are top with three games in hand over their rivals. Osasuna's pitch in Pamplona was certainly affected by the snowfall, especially in the middle third, but large parts were green and the referee decided the game should go ahead. ""We played the game because they told us to play the game but the conditions were very difficult,"" said Zidane. ""For me this was not a football match. In the end we played, and that's it."" Real Madrid are due to play Athletic Bilbao in Malaga on Thursday in the Spanish Super Cup semi-finals. ""We don't know what we're going to do now, whether we stay here tomorrow or if we're going to travel on Monday, we'll see."" Zidane added: ""It is not an excuse. What everyone wants to see is a football match and today the conditions were not met to see a football match."" Messi scored twice against Granada to make it four goals in three matches for him since the turn of the year and his resurgence has coincided with an upturn for the team too, this victory Barca's third on the bounce. ""We are calmer,"" said Barca coach Ronald Koeman. ""We have to stay humble, to keep working and winning."" Messi's double, the second a sweetly-struck free-kick, came between two strikes from Antoine Griezmann, who is also enjoying a revival after a disappointing 18 months at Camp Nou. Some had wondered if Messi would ever get back to his best following an underwhelming start to the season but his latest contribution makes him the league's top scorer on 11 goals, five months after he tried to leave. ""From day one, my interactions with Leo have been good,"" said Koeman. ""We're used to this, if there are a couple of games where he doesn't score, there will be a couple of people who will be unhappy, but not me, never."" Koeman deserves credit for the rejuvenation of players like Griezmann, Ousmane Dembele and Frenkie de Jong, all of whom have improved significantly in recent matches. Barcelona's recovery has a long way to run, with unresolved issues on and off the pitch likely to resurface before the end of the season. Yet Koeman will hope a corner has been turned and at a good time, with the Champions League last 16 tie against Paris Saint-Germain to come next month and a large chunk of the league calendar still remaining. Barca's first goal was fortunate, after Roberto Soldado's lashed clearance saw the ball sliced backwards to Griezmann, who touched and shot past Rui Silva. Griezmann was the instigator for the second too, the Frenchman driving forward to the edge of the area before transferring inside to Messi. Messi was given the yard he needed to shift onto his left foot and curl home. Messi made it three from a similar position, just on the edge of the box, this time with a free-kick, which he harpooned into the corner. Griezmann added a fourth by firing in a scooped pass from Dembele on the turn. Messi went off with almost half an hour left, his work already done, while Granada's Jesus Vallejo was sent off late on. Granada was spared the awful conditions that swept across much of the country, with the snowfall in Madrid on Friday the heaviest since 1971. In Pamplona, Real Madrid struggled to break down a determined Osasuna defence. Karim Benzema went closest after he scrambled the ball in, only to be called offside. Atletico's game at home to Athletic Bilbao was postponed after Bilbao's players were unable to land and returned to Bilbao early on Friday evening. Sevilla were able to play against Real Sociedad and won a five-goal thriller 3-2, with Youssef En-Nesyri grabbing a hat-trick at the Ramon Sanchez Pizjuan. Defeat means Real Sociedad have won only one of their last six matches. They drop to fifth, level on points with Sevilla."

""He's negative and the league have given him their okay,"" the source told AFP. Real Madrid are second in La Liga after a run of seven wins in eight games, including a crucial win over leaders Atletico Madrid who are two points ahead with two games in hand."
3,07/01/2021,17:31,Real Madrid coach Zidane self-isolating,"Zinedine Zidane tested negative for Covid-19 Thursday morning but is self-isolating as a precaution after contact with someone who is confirmed to have the virus, a source at Real Madrid told AFP.",The Frenchman is now awaiting a result from the more accurate PCR test with the hopes of overseeing Real's game at Osasuna on Saturday.
4,29/11/2020,17:20,"Messi, Barcelona remember Maradona in winning style",Barcelona on Sunday followed the advice of coach Ronald Koeman and paid tribute to their former player Diego Maradona with an emphatic return to form in La Liga and a 4-0 victory over Osasuna.,"Maradona, who played two seasons for Barca, died on Wednesday aged 60. Before the match, the club played 'The Song of the Birds' by Catalan cellist Pablo Casals as the teams stood around the centre circle where a Maradona shirt was laid on the centre spot. Lionel Messi, who has inherited Maradona's legendary Argentina number 10 shirt, bowed his head. Flags at the Camp Nou flew at half mast, Maradona's image was displayed on every screen and digital advertising hoardings while a club official held a framed Maradona Barcelona shirt. The Catalans have been struggling in La Liga and started the game 14th. On Friday, Koeman said the best tribute his team could pay Maradona was to ""show what we can do on the pitch"". He recalled Messi and Frenkie de Jong, who were not in the squad for Tuesday's 4-0 Champions League win at Dynamo Kiev, and also started Antoine Griezmann, who was on the bench in Ukraine. Barcelona took the lead after 29 minutes when the ball lobbed into the net off Martin Braithwaite's knee following a scramble in front of goal. Messi seemed to be attempting a tribute to Maradona's famous 'Hand of God' goal against England in 1986 as he leapt after the floating ball stretching his left arm toward it but the referee deemed he did not make contact. It was Braithwaite's first goal at the Camp Nou and followed the Denmark forward's midweek strike in Kiev. Griezmann scored with a powerful left-foot volley from outside the box in the 42nd minute. The France World Cup winner then passed up a shooting chance in the 56th minute to roll a pass across the goal and set up a tap-in for Philippe Coutinho. As Barcelona rediscovered their cutting edge, Ousmane Dembele had a strike ruled out for offside. Messi got his goal in the 74th minute with a dazzling strike. He picked up the ball in midfield, danced past two defenders and smashed a rising left-foot shot into the top far corner. He celebrated by pulling off his Barcelona shirt to reveal a vintage Newell's Old Boys jersey from Maradona's one season with the club in Rosario, Argentina. ""It was a great moment,"" said Koeman. ""Leo's goal, his gesture dedicated to Maradona."" ""It was something very big. We Europeans don't realise how big Maradona is in Argentina."" Earlier this week, Newell's tweeted a photograph from Maradona's debut showing a six-year-old local prodigy, in the same black and red shirt, doing ball tricks for the crowd at half-time. That boy was Messi. Barcelona climbed to eighth, still nine points behind leaders Real Sociedad, who play later, and Atletico Madrid."
5,21/06/2020,22:19,Guedes shines as Valencia keep top four hopes alive,Goncalo Guedes scored a mesmerising solo goal as Valencia stayed in touch with the Champions League qualification places by beating Osasuna 2-0 on Sunday.,"Guedes picked the ball up in his own half and surged past four Osasuna players before completing his stunning run with a driven shot into the top corner. Rodrigo Moreno made it two at Mestalla and while Osasuna had chances in the second half, Valencia secured a comfortable win to keep their fading hopes alive of finishing in the top four. Valencia stay eighth but reduce the gap behind Sevilla in the last Champions League spot to six points. Osasuna, who were expected to be among the teams most affected by empty stadiums given their passionate local support, drop to 12th. They have now taken just one point from their three matches since the restart, this defeat coming on the back of a 5-0 loss at home to Atletico Madrid. Games against Alaves, Leganes and Eibar - opponents all currently beneath them in the table - should decide whether they get dragged into a relegation scrap during the run-in. Osasuna might wonder how Guedes managed to carry the ball through two thirds of the pitch without being stopped but the Portuguese should take full credit for what is surely a contender for goal of the season. After a superb first year on loan from Paris Saint-Germain, Valencia paid 40 million euros to sign Guedes permanently in 2018 but the 23-year-old has struggled to deliver on his early promise. Yet this was a timely reminder of what his talent, a fabulous goal coming before a pin-point pass that allowed Rodrigo to make it two. Guedes' moment came after he intercepted Inigo Perez's cross-field ball and began driving forward. He advanced over the half-way line before slaloming around Oier, tumbling past Unai Garcia but getting up quick to nick the ball ahead of Raul Navas. Into the penalty area, Guedes finally cut inside David Garcia before dummying a shot and then curling into the net. Guedes turned provider soon after, collecting a poor pass from David Garcia and setting free Rodrigo, who prodded home his second goal in three games. Osasuna's next opponents will be Alaves, who earlier suffered a crushing 6-0 defeat away at fellow strugglers Celta Vigo. Alaves were reduced to 10 men after 27 minutes when Martin Aguirregabiria was sent off and Celta capitalised, scoring four in the first half and adding two more late on."
6,02/03/2020,12:30,African players in Europe: Sarr sparkles as Watford stun Liverpool,Ismaila Sarr overshadowed fellow Senegalese Sadio Mane by scoring twice as lowly Watford won 3-0 to end the 44-match unbeaten Premier League streak of runaway leaders Liverpool.,"Mane has been among the key figures as the Reds march toward a first league title in three decades, but he had to take a back seat at Vicarage Road as Sarr blossomed. His pace and trickery unsettled Liverpool and he was rewarded with two goals before setting up Troy Deeney for the third. ISMAILA SARR (Watford) The Hornets' record signing was up against his idol Mane and stabbed home the opener at the near post and then showed his pace and poise to chip Alisson Becker for Watford's second. Sarr then turned provider for the third as he teed up Deeney to complete a famous win that lifted Watford out of the bottom three. JORDAN AYEW (Crystal Palace) Ayew scored the only goal as Palace got the better of rivals Brighton to ease any fear of being dragged into a relegation battle. The Ghanaian's strike took his league tally for the season to seven -- matching his best tally for a single campaign in England. MBWANA SAMATTA (Aston Villa) Samatta did Tanzania proud by scoring in the League Cup final against Manchester City, but his diving header at the near post just before half-time was merely a consolation for Villa as City won 2-1 to lift the trophy for a third straight season. YOUSSEF EN-NESYRI (Sevilla) En-Nesyri scored a 93rd-minute winner as Sevilla beat Osasuna 3-2 to move up to third in La Liga. The Moroccan striker, who joined Sevilla from Leganes in January, opened the scoring with a guided shot into the corner before Lucas Ocampos made it two on the stroke of half-time. Osasuna came back in the second half through goals from Aridane and Roberto Torres, only for En-Nesyri to snatch victory for Sevilla in injury-time with a close-range finish. RAMY BENSEBAINI (Borussia Moenchengladbach) Algerian Bensebaini scored a crucial early goal for Moenchengladbach as they beat Augsburg 3-2 to keep pace with the top of the Bundesliga table. Bensebaini, in his first start in 2020 after returning from injury, headed home a cross from Lars Stindl to put the visitors 1-0 up. When asked how it felt to be back in the Foals' line-up after the match, he simply replied ""it was fun"". ACHRAF HAKIMI (Borussia Dortmund) Having made his name as one of Dortmund's best going forward this season, the Real Madrid loanee was called on to do more than his fair share of defending against a stubborn Freiburg side. Working on the edge of a four-man midfield, Hakimi's pace was valuable during the 1-0 win as he snuffed out several Freiburg counter attacks. He did have a shot on goal deflected in the dying stages but was unable to add to his tally of two Bundesliga goals this season. STEPHANE BAHOKEN (Angers) The Cameroon striker was rewarded with a start for his team at Brest after coming off the bench against Montpellier last weekend and scoring the winner a minute later. He delivered again in Brest, although he needed a full 43 minutes to bag the only goal of the match this time. MAX-ALAIN GRADEL (Toulouse) Ivory Coast winger Gradel, 32, returned to the Toulouse starting line-up last weekend for the first time in a Ligue 1 game since early December following injury. He kept his place and wore the captain's armband but could not prevent the division's bottom side from going down 2-0 at home to Rennes. They have now taken just a single point from their last 17 league games and are heading fast towards relegation. KARL TOKO-EKAMBI (Lyon) Cameroon forward Toko-Ekambi, who joined Lyon on loan from Villarreal in January, came off the bench and contributed to their 2-0 win over derby rivals Saint-Etienne. Having earlier had a goal disallowed for offside, he won the late penalty which Moussa Dembele scored to seal the victory. Toko-Ekambi had started the 1-0 Champions League last-16, first leg win over Juventus in midweek and hit the bar in the first half against the Italians."
7,13/02/2020,17:02,Hazard returns for Real as Barcelona struggle to keep their sparkle,"Real Madrid could welcome back their priciest Galactico this weekend at home against Celta Vigo, while Barcelona must adjust to life without yet another of the most expensive members of their squad as they entertain Getafe.","Eden Hazard cost Real 100 million euros ($108.4 million) last summer, eclipsing the initial fee paid for Gareth Bale. So far, Real have not got much for the money they paid Chelsea. The Belgian started the season with a hamstring problem, then broke a bone in his foot against Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions League in late November. He has not played since. He is expected to be on the bench against Celta. The Galicians climbed out of the relegation places last Saturday with a home win over Sevilla. But Celta's victory was their only win in six games while Real, on a run of five straight wins, are the hottest team in league. For Hazard, and for Real, Celta are not the target, nor are mid-table Levante who they face next Saturday. The date ringed on their calendars will be February 26 when they face Manchester City in the first leg of their Champions League last-16 tie. After a difficult autumn, Zinedine Zidane has his team purring and the endless questions over Bale's role are a sideshow he can ignore. The other team in what is turning into a traditional Spanish two-horse race are looking less comfortable. Barcelona were top as recently January 25. Now they trail Real by three points. They also face a traditional also-ran at home this weekend. But Getafe are the surprise of the Spanish season and have won four straight matches to climb to third and can cut the gap to second to four points with a first league victory away to Barcelona. ""Everything is possible,"" said Getafe defender Allan Nyom. Last week, against Real Betis, Lionel Messi assisted all three goals, setting up midfielders Frenkie de Jong and Sergio Busquets and defender Clement Lenglet. ""When he doesn't score he gives assists,"" said Nyom. Of the players Barcelona have bought to provide creativity and goals alongside Messi, only Antoine Griezmann, who started on Sunday is available. Philippe Coutinho is on loan to Bayern Munich, Luis Suarez is recovering from a knee injury and the club confirmed this week that Ousmane Dembele is out for the season. Lenglet will be missing too. Seven minutes after scoring his second league goal of the season he was sent off. He also picked up a red when Barcelona won at Getafe in a bad-tempered match in September. While Barcelona and Real have another week to prepare for their return to the Champions League, Atletico Madrid host Liverpool next Tuesday and Valencia play Atalanta in Milan on Wednesday. Conveniently they were scheduled to meet this weekend in Valencia and La Liga has brought the game forward to Friday. Their Champions League opponents are both playing league matches on Saturday. If they want to return to the competition next year, Friday's meeting could prove crucial. Atletico are clinging onto the fourth Champions League place only on goal difference from Sevilla while Valencia are just two points back in seventh. Barcelona are making noises about asking for an exemption to buy a striker because of their injury problems. Real Sociedad's Willian Jose, a 28-year-old Brazilian who has gone from journeyman to must-have striker in the last month, and Moron, a 26-year-old who has only established himself in the Betis team in the last 18 months, are reportedly top of the list. They can improve their value by adding to their modest eight league goals each this season on Sunday. Willian's Real Sociedad make the short trip to Eibar and Betis visit Leganes. 14: Lionel Messi is the top scorer in La Liga 11: Lionel Messi is the top assist provider in La Liga 75: Yellow cards Getafe have accumulated, most in La Liga. They collected four against Barcelona in September, but Barcelona edged them with four yellows and a red"
8,09/02/2020,18:15,Bale returns as Madrid come from behind to beat Osasuna,Gareth Bale came back into the team and Real Madrid came back to beat Osasuna on Sunday as a 4-1 victory in Pamplona strengthened their hold on top spot in La Liga.,"Bale had been left out completely for Madrid's previous four matches but the Welshman returned to the squad and the starting line-up at El Sadar, in a surprise show of faith from coach Zinedine Zidane. A fortuitious deflection meant Bale assisted Isco's equaliser too before Sergio Ramos put Madrid in front after Unai Garcia had given Osasuna an early lead. Substitutes Lucas Vazquez and Luka Jovic then scored from late breaks as Madrid pulled six points clear of Barcelona, who play away at Real Betis later on Sunday. Barca's exit in the Copa del Rey overshadowed Madrid's own shock defeat at home to Real Sociedad in the quarter-finals, a loss that brought a dramatic end to their 21-match unbeaten run. But Zidane will be relieved to see his team swiftly back on track with a performance full of the kind of resilience that Madrid's rivals have so lacked in recent weeks. Bale also keeps coming back under Zidane and the 30-year-old had chances to add a goal to a spirited display before going off to a decent reception from the away support in the second half. This was only his third appearance since the turn of the year. Osasuna were the better side in the early stages and took a deserved lead when Unai put his head in front of Casemiro's dangling foot and steered the ball into the corner. But Madrid improved as the half wore on and Isco volleyed in an equaliser after Bale attempted to divert Ferland Mendy's cross, with the ball deflecting kindly into the Spaniard's path. Ramos was lucky to escape a red card after sliding in on Ruben Garcia with a high foot and Madrid's captain took full advantage of his reprieve as he nodded in Casemiro's looping header to the back post. Luka Modric had a strong claim for a penalty after he nipped the ball away from Pervis Estupinan in the area before Osasuna enjoyed their most threatening spell. Inigo Perez's shot whistled just over and Ruben dragged wide from Nacho Vidal's pull-back after making space with a neat dummy past Ramos. Bale went off to applause from the small number of away fans, and Vazquez came on to add a third. Osasuna's defence were occupied by a Karim Benzema burst and he fed right for Vazquez to drive in. Jovic smashed in a fourth in injury-time."
9,24/11/2019,23:17,Banega penalty sends Sevilla third in La Liga,Ever Banega's first-half penalty proved enough to seal Sevilla a 1-0 win at Real Valladolid on Sunday as Julen Lopetegui's men jumped to third in the Liga table.,"Sevilla are unbeaten in six league matches since a 4-0 thrashing at Barcelona last month and trail the reigning champions and Real Madrid by only one point, although they have played a game more. A tight encounter was settled by the only goal in the 13th minute, as Javi Moyano brought down former Manchester City winger Nolito and Argentinian international Banega dispatched the resulting spot-kick. Lucas Ocampos of Sevilla was sent off late on after receiving a second yellow card for time wasting, but the visitors held on to continue their excellent start to the season under former Spain and Real Madrid coach Lopetegui. Barcelona lead the table on goal difference ahead of Real Madrid after beating Leganes on Saturday. Earlier on Sunday, substitute Kenan Kodro scored a late winner as Athletic Bilbao claimed a 2-1 victory at Osasuna to move fifth. The Basque side have taken 10 points from their last four league games and sit only two points behind fourth-placed Atletico Madrid. Inaki Williams put the visitors ahead in the 21st minute with his third goal of the season, but Argentinian Ezequiel Avila levelled for Osasuna with 14 minutes to play. Inly three minutes later, Bosnian Kodro sealed all three points for Bilbao on only his second appearance this term. Chinese forward Wu Lei scored his first league goal of the campaign to help Espanyol secure a 1-1 draw against Getafe. The 28-year-old was prolific in China for Shanghai SIPG, but has struggled since moving to Spain in January. Former Newcastle United striker Joselu scored twice late on as Alaves won 2-0 at Eibar to take his Liga tally to six goals since leaving St James' Park in the close season. Iago Aspas netted a double to help struggling Celta Vigo to a 3-1 victory at Villarreal."
10,26/09/2019,00:07,Real Madrid and Atletico warm up for city derby with victories,Real Madrid's crisis has been averted for the time being at least after they beat Osasuna 2-0 on Wednesday without Eden Hazard and Gareth Bale to go top of La Liga.,"Hazard and Bale were among a number of players rested by coach Zinedine Zidane, with Real facing seven games in 21 days, the next of them against city rivals Atletico Madrid on Saturday. Vinicius Junior, who has endured a difficult few months, filled the void, bending a shot into the top corner before crying tears of what presumably were a mixture of joy and relief. This time last year the 19-year-old exploded onto the scene but injury and then a dip in form saw him drift, with this a chance to reassert himself in a much-rotated line-up. If Vinicius was Madrid's Brazilian sensation 12 months ago, Rodrygo might be one for the present. The 18-year-old, who was bought from Santos in 2018 but joined last summer, added a superb second goal, and his first for the club, just one minute after coming off the bench for a remarkable debut. ""I'm glad for them,"" said Zidane. ""Sometimes we forget they are 18 (and 19) years old. We have seen the emotion they felt about scoring at the Bernabeu. I liked Rodrygo's goal but I liked the control even more."" Earlier, Atletico's Alvaro Morata made a swift impact too but with less positive results after he was sent off eight minutes after being introduced as a substitute against Real Mallorca. Atletico were already 2-0 up thanks to goals from Diego Costa and Joao Felix but Morata will now be suspended for the derby at the Wanda Metropolitano. The Spaniard's dreadful night got worse as he also appeared to engage in a heated exchange with a fan as he later left the stadium. A week ago it would have been almost unthinkable that Atletico would play their rivals in a contest of first against second in La Liga but that could now be the setting this weekend, depending on Sevilla and Real Sociedad's results on Thursday. La Real beat Atletico, who were then held to a goalless draw by Celta Vigo, but by far the deeper sense of gloom had engulfed Zidane's side, after they were humbled 3-0 by Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions League. That was Real's worst defeat under Zidane as coach and prompted questions about the Frenchman's future, with Jose Mourinho available and seemingly waiting in the wings. Instead, back-to-back victories for the first time since Zidane came back in March have lifted the malaise and offered hope there is still life in this Madrid squad, despite the lack of change since the summer. ""We believe in what we do,"" Zidane said. ""With humility and work you achieve a lot. This is just the start."" The only disappointment might have been the lack of a goal for Luka Jovic, who missed some excellent chances and then did score, only to have it ruled out by VAR. Vinicius had started the first two games of the season but none since, while he was without a goal himself in seven months. His first under Zidane was a peach, coming in the 36th minute, a curling effort that took the slightest of deflections on its way into the top corner. Jovic saw a smart finish ruled out and then watched as Rodrygo scored almost instantly after coming on. The teenager cushioned Casemiro's crossfield pass beautifully before nipping inside Osasuna defender Lillo and banging the ball low and into the net. Atletico's players might have been keeping tabs on their way home from Mallorca but their job was already done after Costa and Felix finally got the goals to suggest they might form a potent partnership together. Costa's was simple, as Mallorca failed to clear Koke's cross and the striker nipped in to head past goalkeeper Manolo Reina. Felix's was more complex but owed something to fortune too. The Portuguese did brilliantly to bring a looping ball down but his finish on the turn took a cruel deflection before spinning up and into the far corner. Morata's moments of madness, that included two bookings in as many minutes after an argument with Mallorca's Xisco Campos, should mean Costa and Felix reunite this weekend."
11,22/09/2019,23:39,Benzema ensures Madrid bounce back with impressive win over Sevilla,Real Madrid eased the pressure on Zinedine Zidane and delivered a resounding response to their loss to Paris Saint-Germain by winning 1-0 away at high-flying Sevilla in La Liga on Sunday.,"Karim Benzema headed in the decisive goal at the Ramon Sanchez Pizjuan to secure an impressive victory against a Sevilla side that were unbeaten and hoping to return to the top of the table. Instead, it is Madrid that go level on points with Athletic Bilbao in first place after a controlled and determined performance that was by some distance their best since Zidane's return as coach in March. ""We have had a quite difficult time but the players reacted,"" Zidane said. His position had come under scrutiny after Madrid's woeful 3-0 defeat by PSG in the Champions League on Wednesday, a result that continued their bumpy start to the season, following a turbulent summer in the transfer market. But this win should do wonders for belief and leaves Barcelona as Spain's chief club in crisis, with Ernesto Valverde under pressure after they were beaten 2-0 by Granada on Saturday. Madrid are now four points clear of the Catalans after five games played. ""I am very happy as people have been questioning us a lot,"" said Zidane. ""But we don't think much about that. We played 90 minutes at a very high level in a difficult stadium. We must congratulate all the players."" Not for the first time this season, Zidane singled out Gareth Bale for praise. ""Today hard work was the key,"" he said. ""The effort made by James, Gareth, all of them."" Sevilla's newly-installed coach Julen Lopetegui was sacked by Madrid 11 months ago, 139 days after taking the job that cost him the chance to lead Spain at the World Cup. He insisted on Saturday there was no desire for revenge but it is hard to imagine victory would not have brought a little extra satisfaction. Zidane was asked about his own future as well, several times, and while he maintained he still feels the full backing of the club, there was a warning too. If support dwindles, he said, ""then it would probably be best to leave"". But for all the problems -- a dreadful pre-season, signings and sales missed, poor performances against Real Valladolid, Villarreal, Levante and PSG -- Madrid now sit second, buoyed by a display that may yet prove a springboard for games to come. A frantic opening half an hour made for an engrossing contest but there were few chances, as Lopetegui earned himself a booking for beckoning Gareth Bale to be shown a yellow card. Real Madrid probably just shaded the first period and had its two best chances as Eden Hazard was slipped in by Benzema, only to be denied by Tomas Vaclik on the angle, before Dani Carvajal was sent clear by James Rodriguez but this time Vaclik's right foot blocked the defender's finish. There was little in it, as Bale's excellent cross almost found James at the back post shortly after half-time while Luuk de Jong went close with a header, prompting Carvajal to hack the ball clear at the far post. Still, Madrid looked more likely and so it proved as Raphael Varane won back possession high up, allowing Bale to thread Carvajal in behind. He dug out a cross, which Benzema met brilliantly, rising high to head home his fifth goal of the season. Sevilla might have equalised but De Jong headed wide under pressure from Carvajal and then Javier Hernandez did score, in the 87th minute, poking in at the near post, only for the assistant to raise his flag. Bale could have made it two late on but hit the side-netting from an acute angle. One was enough."
12,26/02/2019,15:06,EU court cancels state aid ruling against four Spanish football clubs,"An EU court delivered a legal win for Barcelona, Real Madrid and two other top Spanish clubs Tuesday, cancelling a 2016 ruling by Brussels that had penalised them over tax breaks.","The General Court of the European Union, the bloc's second highest tribunal, said the European Commission had ""erred in its assessment of the facts"" when it ruled that the tax arrangements amounted to illegal state aid to the clubs. Tuesday's ruling means the clubs do not have to repay millions of euros to the Spanish authorities, as they had been ordered to do in the 2016 decision. After a two-and-a-half year probe, the commission, which acts as the EU's anti-trust enforcer, ruled that tax arrangements Spain gave four clubs -- Real, Barca, Athletic Bilbao and Osasuna -- breached the bloc's rules on state aid. But after a challenge by Barcelona, the Luxembourg-based General Court said that the commission had ""not shown to the requisite legal standard that the measure at issue conferred an advantage on its beneficiaries"" and threw out the 2016 decision. Under European Union anti-trust rules, governments are not allowed to provide state aid to commercial enterprises if it distorts market competition. The commission ruling said the four clubs were treated as non-profit organisations, which pay a lower tax rate than other professional clubs registered as limited liability companies. A commission spokeswoman told AFP that it would ""take note of the decision by the EU court"". ""The Commission will carefully study the judgement and reflect on the next steps,"" she said. This is the second time in two weeks that the European Commission, the guardian of competition in the EU, has suffered a reverse in the court. On February 14 it overturned a Commission decision deeming Belgium's tax policy toward multinationals as ""state aid"". When the investigation opened in December 2013, Florentino Perez, the Real Madrid president, denounced ""a campaign against Spanish football"". The president of the Spanish Sports Council, Miguel Cardenal, had also defended the four clubs. ""The image of Spanish football and Spanish sport has been seriously tarnished, that's the reality,"" he said. ""It is foolish to believe that there is state aid."""
