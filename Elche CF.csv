0,28/12/2020,16:03,Real resume Atletico chase as Messi absent for Barca,Real Madrid will attempt to sign off the year with a sixth win on the bounce as Zinedine Zidane's in-form side continue their pursuit of La Liga leaders and city rivals Atletico Madrid on Wednesday.,"Defending champions Real are level on 32 points with Atletico but have played two games more than Diego Simeone's men ahead of their trip to Elche. Karim Benzema has been the driving force behind Real's excellent December run, claiming key goals in wins over Athletic Bilbao, Eibar and Granada after securing the club a spot in the Champions League knockout phase. Eden Hazard is also in line to feature after recovering from his latest injury setback. The Belgian was an unused substitute in last week's victory over Granada and has made just three league starts this campaign. Real coach Zinedine Zidane hopes the short festive break afforded to his players over Christmas will not interrupt the momentum built over a domestic five-game winning streak. ""We're going to keep working hard. We have an awful lot of games, we should be pleased with what we're doing,"" said Zidane. ""We're going to lose games again, but we're going to try to win as many as possible. From time to time it's inevitable."" Atletico have responded well to the 2-0 defeat by Real earlier this month that snapped their 26-match unbeaten league run. However, the loss of Kieran Trippier is a substantial blow to a defence that has conceded just five goals in 13 matches, easily the fewest in the division. The England defender, an ever-present for Atletico in La Liga and Europe this term, was recently hit with a 10-week ban for breaching betting rules and will be unavailable until March. The club is said to be considering an appeal. Diego Costa has reportedly asked to terminate his contract for family reasons, having just returned from a blood clot that sidelined the Brazil-born Spain international for a month. Joao Felix is expected to return after missing the 2-0 win at Real Sociedad, although the Portuguese star hasn't scored in the league since November 7. Barcelona will bid to end a turbulent 2020 on a winning note at home to Eibar, but Ronald Koeman's side will be without Lionel Messi after the Argentine was granted an extended break as he recovers from an ankle knock. The six-time Ballon d'Or winner admitted his aborted departure in the summer had affected him at the start of the season, but stressed he felt ""excited"" to play under Koeman. ""Barca is my life, I'm in love with the club. And the city, my children were born here,"" Messi said in an interview with Spanish TV channel La Sexta broadcast on Sunday. ""I feel good right now, ready to fight for everything."" The Celta Vigo forward, the leading Spanish scorer in La Liga three of the past four years, has inspired a turnaround at Balaidos after the team won just one of their first 10 matches. The 33-year-old Aspas, who in November became the club's all-time leading scorer in the top flight, has netted eight times in 15 appearances this term and led Celta back into the top half following four wins in five games before Christmas. Much like with Real and Benzema, who is level at the top of the scoring charts with Aspas, Celta's success in 2021 could heavily rely on the former Liverpool attacker. 500 - Diego Simeone will take charge of his 500th match as Atletico boss against Getafe on Wednesday. He has won 300 games since his appointment in December 2011. 35 - Lionel Messi has been involved in more La Liga goals than any other player this year. The Argentine has scored 19 times and provided 16 assists. 9 - the number of games without a win for Real Sociedad across all competitions. Two weeks ago the Basques held top spot, but three successive defeats have dropped Imanol Alguacil's side six points off the pace."
1,19/12/2020,16:21,Suarez double fires Atletico clear at La Liga summit,Luis Suarez scored twice from close range in a 3-1 victory for Atletico Madrid against Elche on Saturday to move Diego Simeone's side three points clear at the top of La Liga.,"In a tight first half at the Wanda Metropolitano, Atletico wasted a clear chance to take the lead when France forward Thomas Lemar drove the ball straight at Elche 'keeper Edgar Badia as the defence opened up. Suarez was far more clinical in the 41st minute as the Uruguay forward got the slightest of touches to steer Kieran Trippier's cross past Badia to take the lead. The former Barcelona and Liverpool attacker then stretched to poke a cross into the net in the 58th minute. Lucas Boye's powerful header gave Elche hope in the second half but substitute Diego Costa fired in a penalty with ten minutes remaining to wrap up the three points for Atletico. Atletico have 29 points, three more than Real Sociedad who visit Levante later Saturday, while Barcelona host Valencia. Champions Real Madrid play Eibar away on Sunday."
2,12/03/2020,11:11,EU court annuls order for Spanish clubs to repay state aid,"A European court on Thursday overturned an order that two Spanish football clubs, Valencia and Elche, must repay millions of euros in public subsidies.","In July 2016, after concluding an investigation into alleged breaches of EU state aid rules, the European Commission had demanded the clubs repay Spain. La Liga outfit Valencia was supposed to refund 20.4 million euros ($22.9 million) and second division Elche 3.7 million euros. But the General Court of the European Union has now found that the commission, the EU's executive arm, had made a ""manifest error of assessment"" in issuing the order. The EU had argued that loan guarantees provided to the clubs by public bodies had allowed them to obtain finance at unfairly advantageous rates. But the court ruled that Brussels' calculations were off and cancelled the order."
3,05/06/2015,13:49,Spain's Elche relegated over tax debt,"Mid-table finishing Spanish La Liga outfit Elche are to be relegated to the second division for unpaid tax, a Spanish football league judge decided on Friday.","""AS of today Elche's debts are still outstanding and no guarantee has been offered,"" a La Liga statement explained. As a result Basque outfit Eibar, who finished third from bottom, will now be handed a reprieve and see Elche, who ended 13th on 41 points, go down a division instead of them. Elche were also hit with a 180,303 euros ($202,000 dollars) fine. On Wednesday Elche president Juan Anguix had promised to settle their 4.3 million euros ($4.8 million) debts by August 1. ""Few clubs can say they have zero debt,"" Anguix said in his club's defence."
4,20/03/2015,23:14,Valencia maintain title push with Elche thrashing,Valencia moved to within five points of La Liga leaders Barcelona with a 4-0 rout of Elche on Friday.,"Andre Gomes pounced after Przemyslaw Tyton could only parry Sofiane Feghouli's driven cross a minute before half-time to put the visitors in front. Paco Alcacer then responded to the disappointment of being left out of Vicente del Bosque's Spain squad earlier in the day with a poacher's finish from Gomes's cross for his seventh goal of the season to put the result beyond doubt after the break. An Enzo Roco own goal and Nicolas Otamendi's stoppage time header rounded off the scoring as Los Che moved four points clear of fourth-placed Atletico Madrid. Atletico are in action when they face Getafe on Saturday, whilst the top two go head-to-head on Sunday as Barcelona host Real Madrid at the Camp Nou."
5,28/11/2014,22:44,Vela hat-trick gives Moyes winning home start,Former Arsenal winger Carlos Vela scored a hat-trick to give new Real Sociedad coach David Moyes a winning home start in La Liga with a 3-0 victory over Elche on Friday.,"Former Everton and Manchester United manager Moyes had seen his team draw 0-0 at Deportivo in the Scot's first game in charge last weekend. Any worries he had over his home debut at the Anoeta stadium were eased after just three minutes when Mexico international Vela found the target with a powerful header. Vela made it 2-0 on the half-hour mark with a calm, incisive finish following a superb Xabi Prieto ball and he completed his hat-trick eight minutes into the second half by stabbing into the net at the far post after latching onto a Carlos Martinez pass. Vela now has five goals for the season while the win, just a third in La Liga for the San Sebastian side, took Moyes's new charges into 12th place in the table."
6,22/08/2014,01:45,Revitalised Barca aiming for a flying start,Barcelona will be looking to put a disastrous end to last season behind them when they open their new La Liga campaign at home to Elche on Sunday.,"Former Barca captain Luis Enrique will take charge of his first competitive game after replacing Gerardo Martino in the dugout, but many of the new faces in the playing staff are unlikely to feature. Marc-Andre ter Stegen and Thomas Vermaelen are both sidelined by injury, while Luis Suarez continues his four-month ban for biting Italian defender Giorgio Chiellini during the World Cup. Claudio Bravo and Ivan Rakitic are expected to make their competitive debuts, however, while Lionel Messi and Neymar will feature after both scored on their return from World Cup duty in Barca's 6-0 thrashing of Mexican side Club Leon on Monday. Barca also lost the experience of goalkeeper Victor Valdes and Carles Puyol over the close season, but another veteran, right-back Dani Alves, believes he can see similarities in Luis Enrique's early days in charge to those of Pep Guardiola which reaped such success. ""It is a pleasure to work with someone like Luis Enrique, he demands a lot from us and in the end that is what makes us excited,"" Alves said on Thursday. ""We are working well and demanding a lot of ourselves. The target this year is a marvellous one. ""I think the teams that want to keep winning titles always have to be in evolution. We have the principal thing, which is clear ideas that are accepted by everyone. All that we need to do now is execute them."" Elche provided a major stumbling block between Barcelona and the Liga title last season as they held Martino's men 0-0 at their own Martinez Valero Stadium in the penultimate game of the campaign. And defender David Lomban believes his side can take heart from that result to the Camp Nou. ""There is never a good time to face Barcelona, but it also wasn't a good time towards the end of last season and we managed to get a draw,"" he said. Champions League finalists Atletico Madrid and Real Madrid don't get their league campaigns underway until Monday night as they face off in the second leg of the Spanish Super Cup on Friday. La Liga champions Atletico have a tricky start as they travel across Madrid to take on a Rayo Vallecano side that produced a stunning late run last season to secure their survival in the top flight for another year. Real, meanwhile, will also be looking to make amends as they crumbled in the final weeks of the league season in May before going on to claim a tenth European Cup by beating Atletico in Lisbon. They begin their league campaign at home to newly-promoted Cordoba. There will be an early indication of Sevilla and Valencia's chances of competing for Champions League football when the two most improved squads outside the big three face off at the Sanchez Pizjuan on Saturday. Europa League winners Sevilla have compensated for the loss of captain Rakitic with the arrivals of Gerard Deulofeu on loan from Barca, Argentine international Ever Banega and Iago Aspas from Liverpool amongst others. Meanwhile, Valencia's immediate financial troubles have been eased as Singaporean entrepreneur Peter Lim has taken charge and revitalised the squad. German World Cup-winner Shkodran Mustafi has replaced Barcelona-bound Jeremy Mathieu at the heart of the defence, Manchester City's newest midfield signing Bruno Zuculini has joined on loan for a year and prolific Spanish under-21 international Rodrigo has bolstered new coach Nuno Espirito Santo's attacking options.

7,03/01/2014,02:15,"Football: Barca, Atletico jostle for position, Basque derby on cards","After a short winter break, Spain's top-flight clubs are back in action this weekend with Barcelona and Atletico Madrid jostling for position at the top of the table and a Basque derby also on the cards.","Reigning champions Barcelona and Diego Simeone's Atletico are level on points at the top and are due to face each other in a mouthwatering fixture in Madrid next weekend. Prior to that, though, Atletico go to Malaga on Saturday and Barcelona entertain Elche on Sunday before both sides have Copa del Rey ties to think about in midweek. Atletico, who have signed Argentine midfielder Jose Ernesto Sosa on loan from Metalist Kharkiv until the end of the season, will face a Malaga side who won their last two league games of 2013 to climb up into mid-table. Brazilian full-back Filipe Luis insists that the Rojiblancos are fully focused on their trip to La Rosaleda as they look to keep the pressure on Barcelona. ""Knowing the coach and the squad, nobody is thinking about the Barcelona game. Maybe the supporters are, but we all know that the Malaga match is vital,"" he said. ""We have not won there in two or three years and it is a difficult venue for us."" Both Atletico and Barca have enjoyed stunning starts to the campaign, winning 15 and drawing one of 17 games in La Liga, but the Catalans have not always performed convincingly since Gerardo Martino took over as coach in the summer. Nevertheless, the champions have been boosted by the return to the squad of goalkeeper Victor Valdes after injury, while Lionel Messi is also edging closer to a comeback. Barca midfielder Andres Iniesta is hoping a win against Elche - who sit just two points above the drop zone - can set his team up for a successful 2014. ""A good new year for us means winning everything"" said the man who scored Spain's World Cup-winning goal in 2010. ""When you have the chance to reach the top, you have to fight hard, and that's the kind of ambition that we hope will take us into April and May in contention. The team is playing well, and we need to grow from here."" Real Madrid, who sit third in the table, five points adrift of the top two, are in action on the Monday Three Kings Day holiday with a home fixture against Celta Vigo at the Santiago Bernabeu. The extra time to prepare for that game was used up playing in a glamour friendly against Paris Saint-Germain in Qatar on Thursday, which Carlo Ancelotti's team won 1-0 thanks to a first-half goal from young striker Jese. ""We are coming from behind but we have the whole second half of the season to come back and win the league,"" Ancelotti said. The first weekend of the New Year features the enticing prospect of a Basque derby between fifth-placed Real Sociedad and Athletic Bilbao at Anoeta. Athletic sit four points clear of their neighbours in the final Champions League qualifying position and have lost just one of their last 10 Liga games. Meanwhile, la Real, who finished fourth last season, have doubts over several players for the game, including the influential Xabi Prieto. That is not the only derby on the cards, with Valencia entertaining city rivals Levante at the Mestalla in what will be their first game since the appointment of Argentine-born former Barcelona and Spain striker Juan Antonio Pizzi as coach. Pizzi, who led San Lorenzo to the Argentine Torneo Inicial title last month, has replaced the sacked Miroslav Djukic in charge of Los Che, who sit level on points with Levante coming into their first game of 2014.

8,02/01/2014,22:35,Football: Barcelona's Valdes declared fit to play,"Doctors have declared Barcelona goalkeeper Victor Valdes fit and ready to play after 44 days on the sidelines with a right calf strain, the Spanish club said on Thursday.","""It is a day of good news for Barcelona's first team. After a training session on Thursday afternoon, doctors gave keeper Victor Valdes the all clear,"" the club said in a statement. The 31-year-old could be part of coach Gerardo Martino's side for Barcelona's league match at home to Elche on Sunday. Valdes sustained the injury during Spain's 1-0 defeat to South Africa in a friendly on November 19 in Johannesburg, the site of their 2010 World Cup final victory. The player, who has revealed plans to leave the Spanish champions when his current contract expires at the end of this season, has been replaced in the starting line-up in recent weeks by Jose Manuel Pinto."

There will be four ties between top-flight sides, including Malaga against Osasuna and Celta Vigo against Athletic Bilbao. Each side's path through to the latter stages was decided too, and Barcelona cannot meet Madrid until the final, although Atletico could come up against their city rivals in the last four. Atletico beat Real in their own Santiago Bernabeu stadium to win last season's final.

10,25/08/2013,00:20,"Football: Barca without injured Messi, Real wait on Bale",World Player of the Year Lionel Messi will miss Barcelona's trip to Malaga on Sunday as he continues to recover from a thigh injury as Real Madrid remained poised to welcome Gareth Bale.,"Messi was substituted at half-time in Barca's 1-1 draw with Atletico Madrid on Wednesday and Barca boss Gerardo Martino confirmed the 25-year-old had not been included in his squad as a precaution. ""He is developing well,"" Martino told a press conference on Saturday. ""It is just a precaution. We are optimistic, but it is just three days since the injury occurred and it would be risky to play him, especially so early in the season."" Messi's absence should mean a start for Cesc Fabregas in the false nine role he often occupies for Spain. However, Martino was tight-lipped on whether or not Neymar would be handed his first start for the club after coming off the bench to net his first Barca goal on Wednesday. ""Just because Messi isn't there doesn't mean Neymar has to take the reigns,"" said the coach. ""Neymar is improving all the time, but we need to take things bit by bit to ensure everything goes well in the end. My intention is that when he plays he is able to show all that he can do."" Real Madrid meanwhile aren't in action until Monday night when they travel to face Granada. However, it is looking increasingly unlikely that they will travel to Andalusia with Bale amongst their ranks as there was still no confirmation of his move from Spurs on Saturday. Spanish media reported that the 24-year-old had already arrived in Spain and is waiting in Marbella for the world record deal to be completed before flying to Madrid to be presented to the fans and the media in the coming days. Real will be without Xabi Alonso for up to three months after he broke a bone in his foot earlier this week and minor injuries to Sami Khedira and Asier Illarramendi mean manager Carlo Ancelotti's midfield options are limited. Meanwhile the Italian also has to decide whether to stick with Diego Lopez in goal or recall club captain Iker Casillas after he was surprisingly benched for Real's 2-1 win over Real Betis last weekend. In the night's action on the field, Real Sociedad failed to make it three wins in a week as they were held 1-1 by promoted Elche. The Basques took a huge step towards qualifying for the Champions League group stages for the first time in a decade in midweek as they won 2-0 away to Lyon. However, they were on the back foot straight away in Alicante as Ferran Coro scored the hosts first goal in the top-flight for 24 years. Sociedad improved mightily after the break though and were deservedly level 16 minutes from time when Carlos Vela turned home Xabi Prieto's cross. Espanyol moved alongside Sociedad on four points after two games as they came from behind to beat Valencia 3-1. Helder Postiga scored his first goal for Valencia against the run of play after just 10 minutes. However, David Lopez's equaliser ensured Javi Aguirre's men went in level at half-time and second-half goals from Cristian Stuani and Thievy Bifouma rounded off a fine victory for the Catalans."
