""Poland is a country of football and I am sure with your enthusiasm, giving us the strength and support and belief of the national football team, together we will be able to fight for the next European championships."" Sousa, 50, will replace Jerzy Brzeczek, whose dismissal was announced this week, a decision that came as a surprise as he helped the team qualify for Euro 2020, delayed until this year because of the coronavirus pandemic. Brzeczek had been in charge since July 2018 and had extended his contract in November. But Boniek said there was ""discouragement"" in the team under the 49-year-old Brzeczek, adding: ""With this format, the team could not move forward"". Sousa, a Champions League winner with Juventus and Borussia Dortmund as a player, left French Ligue 1 club Bordeaux last year after overseeing a disappointing 2019-2020 season in which Bordeaux finished 12th. bo-dt//gj <org>BORUSSIA DORTMUND</org> <org>JUVENTUS FOOTBALL CLUB</org>"
1,17/01/2021,23:44,Metz end Lyon's run as PSG take Ligue 1 lead,Lyon slumped to a shock 1-0 home defeat to Metz on Sunday that ended a long unbeaten run and allowed Paris Saint-Germain to stay top of Ligue 1.,"Rudi Garcia's side had come into Sunday's late match on the back of 16 league games without defeat, knowing that a win would have put them back in the lead of France's top flight. However Aaron Leya Iseka struck in the final minute to snatch the points for resilient Metz, who had to withstand a second-half onslaught before finally prevailing and moving ninth. ""We pushed, they pushed, and we were rewarded for our efforts. We knew that we would have little of the ball and that we would have to counter well, and that's what we did,"" said Belgian Leya Iseka. The loss leaves Lyon third, two points behind PSG and Lille, whose own late goal from Jonathan David secured a 2-1 win over Reims. Lyon should have taken the lead six minutes before the break when Karl Toko Ekambi was fed by Tintotenda Kadewere on a breakaway attack. Cameroonian Ekambi, who had forced a good save from Alexandre Oukidja three minutes earlier, successfully cut inside to fashion himself a shooting opportunity but could only blast over. Three minutes later Metz twice came close to taking a shock lead, first hitting the post following a Farid Boulaya cross before Marcelo charged back to block Lamine Gueye's shot on the line. With 16 minutes remaining Ekambi slammed home what he thought was the opener when the ball fell to him after fine play between Memphis Depay and Thiago Mendes. However after a long VAR review the goal was ruled out for Houssem Aouar straying offside when Mendes shot and then pressuring Metz defender Fabien Centonze, who had nodded the ball out to Ekambi. Islam Slimani had the perfect chance to win the match with seven minutes left of his Lyon debut but he shanked his shot, and Oukidja then did brilliant to keep out Aouar's close range effort after fine work from Memphis Depay. That allowed Leya Iseka to claim a shock win for Metz. Earlier David pounced in the first minute of stoppage for Lille to tap home after Xeka's powerful low drive was spilled by Reims goalkeeper Predrag Rajkovic to put Lille on 42 points, equal with champions PSG. Jonathan Bamba's long-range leveller two minutes after the break gave Lille a chance to snatch the win after Arber Zeneli had given Reims a 35th-minute lead with a cross that bamboozled home stopper Mike Maignan. Monaco are six points off the lead in fourth after Wissam Ben Yedder's brace gave them a 3-2 win over Montpellier on Friday. The Principality club are level on 36 points with fifth-placed Rennes, who earlier on Sunday fought back from going a goal down after just three minutes at Brest to win 2-1. Saint-Etienne are just four points above the relegation zone after a 1-0 defeat at Strasbourg. The 10-time French champions are 16th and winless in five league matches thanks in part to a missed 10th-minute penalty from Ryad Boudebouz. Ludovic Ajorque scored the winner for the team from Alsace just before the half-hour mark. Nantes are hovering above the drop zone after drawing 1-1 at home with Lens, with Gael Kakuta's 81st-minute leveller for the away side denying Raymond Domenech a first win in charge of the hosts. The former France coach has guided Nantes to three straight draws since his much-derided appointment last month, with his team battling a run of games without a win that stretches back to early November. Bordeaux strolled to a thumping 3-0 win at Nice, who are also without a win in five."
2,01/11/2020,19:14,Volland off the mark as Monaco thump Bordeaux,Germany international Kevin Volland scored his first goals for Monaco since joining the club in September as Niko Kovac's side thrashed Bordeaux 4-0 in Ligue 1 on Sunday.,"Monaco struck three times in as many minutes through Wissam Ben Yedder, Gelson Martins and Volland in the first half to take control at the Stade Louis II. Volland then grabbed another in the second half as Monaco won for just the second time in six matches to climb up to seventh place. France forward Ben Yedder crashed home a spot-kick on 27 minutes after his header was handled by Pablo, with a penalty awarded despite the ball looping over Benoit Costil and into the net following the deflection. Martins grabbed his first goal since serving a six-month ban for pushing a referee last season when he lunged at the far post to poke in a Ruben Aguilar cross. And former Bayer Leverkusen forward Volland promptly headed in from a Ben Yedder delivery to end his drought following his 11 million-euro ($13 million) move from Germany. The 28-year-old tapped in a second on 57 minutes as Martins slid the ball across goal for his unmarked team-mate. Nice moved up to fourth as Patrick Vieira's team extended their unbeaten domestic run to five games with a 3-0 victory at Angers. Rony Lopes put Nice ahead on 11 minutes and Pierre Lees-Melou added a second from the spot. Hicham Boudaoui came off the bench to net a third as Nice stayed four points behind leaders Paris Saint-Germain. Metz continued their fine recent form with a 1-0 win at Nimes while Montpellier defeated Saint-Etienne by the same scoreline courtesy of a goal from Englishman Stephy Mavididi. Reims beat Strasbourg 2-1 while Dijon remain the only team without a victory following a goalless draw at home to Lorient. Lille put their undefeated record on the line in Sunday's late game when they host a resurgent Lyon. Christophe Galtier's Lille have won five and drawn three of their opening eight games. They could go back level on points with PSG at the top with victory."
3,21/08/2020,21:25,Marseille confirm fifth COVID-19 case as Ligue 1 starts under virus cloud,"Marseille have found a fifth asymptomatic case of coronavirus in their squad, a club spokesperson told AFP on Friday, on the same day the new French Ligue 1 season kicked-off under an increasingly darkening COVID-19 cloud.","Andre Villas Boas' squad had been scheduled to open the French season later in the day at home to Saint-Etienne but the game was cancelled after the four earlier positive tests. The club have not revealed the names of the players but said they are in isolation at home. The rest of the Marseille squad were given the weekend off ahead of next Sunday's game at Brest. Hours later, Saint-Etienne said one of their players had also tested positive. Nantes' trip to Bordeaux was moved from Saturday to replace the season-opening fixture at the Velodrome. It proved little comfort as the game, the first in the competition in 166 days following the coronavirus lockdown and played behind closed doors, ended in a tame 0-0 draw. Nantes had a one-man advantage for more than an hour after a 20th-minute red card for Mehdi Zerkane. The Bordeaux player was punished after a VAR consultation for an ugly lunge into the leg of Nicolas Pallois. Earlier on Friday, Nice coach Patrick Vieira said he was concerned about the impact two coronavirus cases could have on his club. Nice said a pair of players had been held out of training and placed in quarantine after contracting the virus. ""I felt on the pitch the rest of the squad is worried. I am too, for the match against Lens on Sunday and for what happens next,"" Vieira told a press conference. ""It complicates the planning. We'll have to put up with it and be very responsible at home."" Newly-promoted Lens are awaiting the results of further tests after defender Jonathan Clauss returned a positive sample earlier in the week. ""I hope we will play. If we start by postponing the first weekend, we'll get nowhere,"" said Lens boss Franck Haise. ""I think we need to play as much as we can when it's possible otherwise we're going to finish the season in 2023."" Meanwhile, Nimes announced a fourth coronavirus case within their squad putting Sunday's fixture against Brest at risk. ""I hope we can play it, I think we can play it,"" the southern side's coach Jerome Arpinon said. According to a club source captain Anthony Briancon and striker Nolan Roux are among those to have tested positive for the illness. Brest also recorded a case, saying the individual had been placed in isolation while the rest of the squad and the coaching staff have tested negative. A 57-page medical and health protocol set up by the French league is designed to limit stoppages and reduce contamination as much as possible. Players will be tested two to three days before each match and a game will be postponed as soon as four cases are found at the same club within an eight-day period."
4,10/08/2020,17:20,Bordeaux bring back Jean-Louis Gasset as new coach,French Ligue 1 club Bordeaux appointed veteran French coach Jean-Louis Gasset on a two-year deal after parting ways earlier Monday with Paulo Sousa.,"Gasset was assistant to Laurent Blanc when Bordeaux won the French top flight in 2009. Gasset, 66, was also head coach at Montpellier in 2017 then at Saint Etienne 2017-2019. ""The chance to return to a club where I experienced so many great moments makes me extremely happy,"" Gasset said. The club also announced the return of former player Alain Roche as director of football. Sousa oversaw a disappointing 2019-2020 season when Bordeaux finished 12th after the campaign was halted as coronavirus spread across Europe, and later declared over."
5,06/07/2020,12:36,One coronavirus case at Ligue 1 club Bordeaux,French club Bordeaux announced on Monday a squad member had tested positive for coronavirus but his name had been kept private for medical confidentiality reasons.,"The first tests carried out when the players originally returned to training on June 22 all showed up negative. ""After becoming aware of the result, the player concerned was isolated and placed in quarantine,"" a statement said. ""The club remain vigilant and continue to attentively monitor the players and staff,"" it added. Other Ligue 1 sides, 2017 champions Monaco, Montpellier and Dijon, have also said they have recorded positive cases over the past few weeks. Former Portugal midfielder Paulo Sousa resigned as Bordeaux coach last week after over a year in charge and leading them to a modest 12th place as the season was declared over early due to the COVID-19 outbreak."
6,09/03/2020,14:50,"African players in Europe: Salah, Mane rescue Liverpool","Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mane were the African stars in Europe at the weekend, with both scoring as Premier League leaders Liverpool snapped a mini all-competitions slump by beating Bournemouth 2-1 at Anfield.","Reigning African Footballer of the Year Mane netted the winner after Salah cancelled out an early opener for the relegation-threatened visitors. In Germany, Moroccan Achraf Hakimi grabbed the decisive goal for Bundesliga title challengers Borussia Dortmund in a 2-1 victory over Borussia Moenchengladbach. SADIO MANE/MOHAMED SALAH (Liverpool) Mane and Salah got Liverpool back to winning ways with both on target in a 2-1 win over Bournemouth. Egyptian Salah marked his 100th Premier League game for the Reds with his 70th goal courtesy of a trademark low left-foot finish from Mane's pass. The Senegalese then calmly slotted home his 18th goal of the season to move Liverpool to within six points of the title. JORDAN AYEW (Crystal Palace) Ayew's blistering strike from outside the area earned Palace a 1-0 win over Watford and ensured the Ghana international his best goal tally for a Premier League season with eight. ACHRAF HAKIMI (Borussia Dortmund) Hakimi was crucial for Borussia Dortmund against Borussia Moenchengladbach, scoring the winner in a 2-1 victory that kept his side in touch with Bundesliga leaders Bayern Munich. He was in the right place at the right time to collect Jadon Sancho's assist and guide the ball past Yann Sommer in the 71st minute. It was his third Bundesliga goal of the season as Dortmund moved within four points of Bayern. AMINE HARIT (Schalke) Harit came off the bench in Schalke's 1-1 home draw against Hoffenheim as the Royal Blues went for a killer blow. While his speed was noticeable against a tiring Hoffenheim defence, he was unable to add to his six goals or four assists this season. JOSH MAJA (BORDEAUX) England-born Nigerian international Maja scored his eighth goal of the season as Bordeaux drew 1-1 at Saint-Etienne. The 21-year-old former Sunderland forward met a loose ball inside the box to fire a low shot into the net. JOHN BOYE (METZ) The experienced Ghana centre-back scored a late winner as Metz claimed a crucial 2-1 win over struggling Nimes to move seven points clear of the Ligue 1 bottom three. The 32-year-old Boye, capped 67 times by Ghana, netted in the 81st minute, having also scored the winner against Strasbourg in January."
7,24/02/2020,00:16,Neymar sent off as PSG beat Bordeaux in seven-goal thriller,"Edinson Cavani scored his 200th Paris Saint-Germain goal and Marquinhos netted twice as the Ligue 1 leaders bounced back from their Champions League defeat by Borussia Dortmund to beat Bordeaux 4-3 on Sunday, but their victory was marred by Neymar's late sending-off.","After losing 2-1 in Germany in their Champions League last 16 first leg in midweek, PSG's defensive weaknesses were again exposed as South Korean international Hwang Ui-jo gave Bordeaux the lead at the Parc des Princes. PSG turned it around thanks to goals by Cavani and Kylian Mbappe either side of a Marquinhos brace, but at the other end there was a bizarre goal credited to the Brazilian defender Pablo and a Ruben Pardo strike had the home side hanging on at the finish. The evening concluded with Neymar being sent off in stoppage time for a second yellow card for grappling with Bordeaux's Yacine Adli, leaving the world's most expensive player facing a suspension. Along with the shortcomings at the back, it is another problem for coach Thomas Tuchel to think about, even if his team are now 13 points clear atop Ligue 1 from Marseille, who lost 3-1 to Nantes on Saturday. ""He is human too and he was angry. The guy who fouled him just before was not even booked, so it was a bit bizarre,"" said Tuchel of Neymar's sending-off. ""We have let in seven goals in the last two league games and that is not normal. It is difficult to get back confidence, but the best thing for us was to win. That gives us a base to build on."" Another domestic title has looked inevitable for some time, although it will all feel rather hollow should the Qatar-owned club fail to turn around the Dortmund tie when the sides meet again on March 11. Tuchel came in for criticism after Tuesday's game, including veiled criticism from Neymar over the handling of his latest injury. Tuchel also admitted he was less than impressed at his squad after videos appeared on social media of them out partying on Thursday night to celebrate the birthdays of Cavani, Angel di Maria and Mauro Icardi. A banner at one end of the Parc des Princes on Sunday asked the players if they ""deserved to wear the colours. Find out on March 11"". They endured a bad start against mid-table Bordeaux, with skipper Thiago Silva going off hurt just before Hwang put the away side in front on 18 minutes, heading in a corner for his sixth Ligue 1 goal. PSG were level in the 25th minute, though, as Di Maria's cross was headed in by Cavani, allowing the Uruguayan to reach a double century of PSG goals. He then hit the post from close range before Marquinhos put Paris in front in first-half stoppage time, using his shoulder to covert Di Maria's free-kick. Nevertheless, there was still time for Bordeaux to equalise at 2-2 before the interval. Selected ahead of Keylor Navas in goal, Sergio Rico's clearance from a Marco Verratti back-pass struck Pablo and the Spaniard looked on in horror as the ball ricocheted back into the net. However, Marquinhos netted from close range for his second of the night in the 63rd minute to make it 3-2. Then, when Ruben Pardo lost possession, Cavani set up Mbappe to score PSG's fourth, and his 16th in the league this season. Pardo made some amends with a stunning strike for Bordeaux's third, and the ninth goal Paris have conceded in three games altogether. Icardi then had another goal disallowed before Neymar was sent off for his second yellow at the death. ""They have had quite a difficult week in terms of results and their confidence has taken a knock too,"" said Bordeaux's Laurent Koscielny of PSG. ""When you lose points and games then your confidence can quickly disappear but they are great players and they are capable of overcoming that."" Earlier on Sunday, Rennes reclaimed third place from Lille by coming from behind to beat Nimes 2-1 as M'Baye Niang scored twice."
8,21/02/2020,14:09,Distracted PSG seek to rouse themselves against Bordeaux,"Paris Saint-Germain go into Sunday's home game with Bordeaux with a comfortable 10-point lead in Ligue 1, but life has been anything but comfortable for the French champions over the last week.","Club president Nasser Al-Khelaifi was indicted on Thursday in a Swiss corruption investigation, which does not directly involve PSG but is, however it turns out, a distraction. Meanwhile, the future commitment of the club's star striker is again in doubt, after Lionel Messi said in an interview published in Spain on Thursday that Neymar ""really wants to return to Barcelona"". On the field, PSG threw away points in their last league match with a bizarre 4-4 draw at Amiens last Saturday. PSG fell behind 3-0, fought back with four goals in 29 minutes and then conceded an equaliser in added time. Perhaps that distracted display could be excused because the club was facing a much more meaningful test on Tuesday away to Borussia Dortmund in the Champions League. It is a competition the squad has been built to win, but they have lost in the first knockout round the last three seasons. ""This is not life or death, it's a game of football,"" Sporting director Leonardo said before the match. Yet the reactions after PSG lost, 2-1, their first defeat in any competition since losing in the league at Dijon on November 1, suggested not everyone agreed with Leonardo. Coach Thomas Tuchel rested Neymar for the two Ligue 1 outings in the run-up to Tuesday and, while he scored in Dortmund, the Brazilian complained after the game. ""I understand the club's fear, because I missed the last 16 in each of the last two years,"" he said. ""I respect the decisions, but it can't be that way, because it is the player who ends up suffering."" ""It was very difficult to play a game of that intensity,"" he added. ""If I were in a better condition physically then I definitely would have played better."" Neymar seemed to have discovered his intensity and rhythm by Thursday night. Videos showed him dancing topless at a party to celebrate the birthdays of team-mates d'Angel Di Maria, Mauro Icardi and Edinson Cavani. Dortmund do not visit Paris until March 11. Next Wednesday PSG face old enemies Lyon in a French Cup semi-final. Bordeaux are unbeaten in their last five games, but three of those were draws and they are trudging along in mid-table. The question is whether they present enough of a challenge to force PSG to rediscover their intensity or will they give another distracted display? Toulouse need a miracle. Their captain is their best hope, and he knows it. Toulouse are eight points adrift of Amiens and 13 points away from 18th and potential safety as they travel to fourth-place Lille on Saturday evening. The 32-year-old Ivorian came off the bench after two months out with 25 minutes left and Toulouse down a goal and a man against Nice. The hosts had a second man sent off, but Gradel still won a 90th minute penalty, which Aaron Leya Iseka missed and Nice added a second goal. ""If I didn't really believe in the game, I wouldn't have taken the risk of coming back so quickly,"" said Gradel, whose four goals this season make him joint-leading scorer at the club. ""If we saves ourselves, it will be all of us together,"" he said. ""Nobody believes in us, but we have to take it as a challenge, and for me it's this kind of battle that motivates me."" ""I'm a leader, I'm the captain and I'm going to do everything I can to be decisive.""

9,26/01/2020,19:09,Toko Ekambi scores on Lyon debut as clubs remember Sala,"Karl Toko Ekambi scored on his Lyon debut Sunday in a 3-0 victory over bottom club Toulouse while Nantes and Bordeaux paid tribute to their former striker Emiliano Sala, a year after his death in a plane crash.","Ivory Coast international Maxwel Cornet opened the scoring on the half-hour for Lyon before Moussa Dembele prodded in a second on 71 minutes at Groupama Stadium. Cameroon striker Toko Ekambi, who joined on loan this week from Villarreal until the end of the season, sealed the victory six minutes later as Lyon climbed up to fifth in Ligue 1. Toko Ekambi came on as a first-half substitute after a scary incident involving France Under-21 forward Martin Terrier. Terrier was stretchered off after fainting on the pitch, but Lyon said at half-time that the player had regained consciousness. Sixteen-year-old Rayan Cherki also made a brief appearance off the bench, having scored twice and provided two assists in a 4-3 French Cup win over Nantes last weekend. Nantes and Bordeaux honoured Argentine forward Sala before an emotional Derby de l'Atlantique at the Stade de la Beaujoire. Bordeaux won 1-0 courtesy of a late goal by Jimmy Briand as Nantes played most the second half with 10 men after the dismissal of Andrei Girotto. The 28-year-old Sala was killed last January when the small plane taking him to join Cardiff City after being bought from Nantes for £15 million ($19.5 million, 17.6 million euros) crashed off the Channel island of Guernsey. Nantes wore a special white and pale blue shirt inspired by Argentina while Bordeaux's kit featured an Argentine flag beneath the club crest flanked by the player's initials. Proceeds from the sales of the strips will go to the two Argentine clubs Sala played for in his youth. A portrait of Sala was also displayed in the centre circle during the warm-up and there was a minute's applause ahead of kick-off. Supporters laid flowers outside the ground and broke out into a song commemorating Sala in the ninth minute, representing the shirt number worn by the player which has since been retired by Nantes. Sala left his homeland to join Bordeaux in 2012 and then played for Nantes between 2015 and 2019. League leaders Paris Saint-Germain visit last year's runners-up Lille in Sunday's late game. PSG could stretch their advantage over Marseille to 10 points with victory, although Thomas Tuchel's side lost 5-1 on their last trip to Lille in April. That remains PSG's worst league defeat since 2000."
10,25/11/2019,00:04,Marseille retake second place in Ligue 1 with Toulouse win,Marseille reclaimed second spot in Ligue 1 when they won 2-0 at 10-man Toulouse who cracked in the final 15 minutes.,"Earlier on Sunday, Bordeaux edged in-form Monaco 2-1 at home to briefly climb into third and Saint-Etienne drew 0-0 at home against Montpellier. In Toulouse, the home team were reduced to 10 men when right back Steven Moreira drove his studs into Bouna Sarr's knee and received a red card after a video review. Marseille dominated a scruffy match but struggled to break down Toulouse. The home team defended in depth and even had a chance to take the lead in the 70th minute but goalkeeper Steve Mandanda saved Ibrahim Sangare's header with his foot. Marseille responded with a decisive moment of inspiration in the 76th minute. Dimitri Payet drew defenders then threaded a clever reverse pass to the darting Dario Benedetto who danced past Baptiste Reynet and coolly slid the ball into the goal. Three minutes later, Toulouse presented Marseille with a second. Left-back Issiaga Sylla drove a clearance into Valere Germain. The ball bounced to Nemanja Radonjic, who advanced into the penalty area and curled a shot into the net. ""We played a good game and the victory is deserved,"" said Marseille coach Andre Villas-Boas. Toulouse ""closed up the game after the red card,"" said Villas-Boas. ""Don't forget Mandanda's decisive save before we opened the scoring. We knew that the first goal would be very important. ""We keep our second place and we have to keep going like this."" Marseille climbed to 25 points from 14 matches, eight behind leaders Paris Saint-Germain but one ahead of Angers. Bordeaux and Saint-Etienne are fourth and fifth on 22. Toulouse remain second from bottom. Depleted Bordeaux, already deprived of defenders Mexer and Vukasin Jovanovic who were both suspended, midfielder Youssef Ait Bennasser, who could not play because he is on-loan from Monaco, lost centre-back Laurent Koscielny to injury on Sunday morning and winger Jimmy Briand during the warm-up. Monaco, who had climbed away from the relegation zone with three victories in their previous four league games, took the lead against Bordeaux with a goal by Islam Slimani on 15 minutes. After that, even though the hosts' fans fell silent in the first half as part of a protest against their owners, the visitors failed to exploit the makeshift home defence. Instead, Brazilian Pablo levelled with a powerful header from a corner after 29 minutes. In the 67th minute, Slimani handled while standing in the wall at a free kick, conceding a penalty and incurring his second yellow card. Nicolas de Preville converted the spot-kick to give Bordeaux victory. ""There were a lot of players from the starting XI who were not here,"" Bordeaux midfielder Aurelien Tchouameni said. ""This shows the strength of character of our team. Some of them didn't have much playing time this season. They stood up."" Later on Sunday, Saint-Etienne drew 0-0 at home against Montpellier as the sides managed just two shots on target."
11,28/09/2019,22:17,"'I'll give my life to PSG,' says Neymar","Brazilian superstar Neymar pledged Saturday to ""give my life to PSG"" after his goal kept the French giants top of Ligue 1 with a 1-0 win at Bordeaux.","Neymar, the world's most expensive footballer, had been strongly linked to a return to Barcelona over a tumultuous summer. However, in an attempt to win over PSG fans, many of whom have become unconvinced by the player's attachment to the French capital, Neymar has looked a rejuvenated figure, scoring for a third time this season. ""I'm very happy to be able to help PSG, it's better with the fans,"" he said. ""It's like with your girlfriend, one moment you're bad, but with hugs and a lot of love, it's better. ""I am here to give my life to PSG. They are my team, my goal is to help my club, to continue to score goals."" On Saturday, Kylian Mbappe and Neymar played together for the first time this season and combined for the only goal in Bordeaux. Mbappe, who had been out injured since August 25, started on the bench but, with PSG struggling for a breakthrough, came on after an hour. The Parisian attack immediately gained a more menacing edge. Both Mbappe, with a shot, and Neymar, with a header, went close before combining to open the scoring for the game's only goal in the 70th minute. Mbappe outpaced the Bordeaux defence on the right. His precise low cross presented Neymar with a tap in at the far post. ""The most important thing is that these goals are decisive, in tight matches, that's why I'm here,"" added Neymar. ""It's obviously a pleasure to link up with Kylian again. He came back with his smile and with his football talent,"" he added. French World Cup winner Mbappe said he was delighted to link-up again with Neymar although he admits their partnership remains a work in progress. ""There are things that have been said, but we have always had a relationship based on honesty and admiration,"" said Mbappe. The last time Mbappe and Neymar had appeared together was in the French Cup final last April, a match which ended in defeat. As Bordeaux pressed, Mbappe and PSG began to carve open the home defence. He burst through on his own, but goalkeeper Benoit Costil anticipated the chip. Then Costil again reacted quickly, diving at Angel Di Maria's feet as the Argentine ran onto Mbappe's angled through ball. PSG, who had suffered a shock 2-0 loss to Reims on Wednesday, survived a late video review for a potential Bordeaux penalty to recapture first place. Angers are second in the table after a 1-1 draw with Amiens. Nantes, also two points off the pace, had briefly moved to the top when they won 1-0 win at Lyon earlier in the day. Lyon had the best of the chances but conceded the only goal in freakish fashion just before the hour. As Samuel Moutoussamy broke into the home area, left-back Fernando Marcal slid in and attempted to poke the ball out for a corner. Instead, it struck his other leg and looped over goalkeeper Anthony Lopes and into the goal. As the home fans whistled their team, the Lyon players appeared increasingly lost, although the brilliance of Nantes goalkeeper Alban Lafont was a major factor in their failure. For Nantes, it was a first win at Lyon since December 1996. Monaco's revival continued when a 4-1 home win over Brest allowed them to move into 12th spot. Monaco have now taken seven points from their last three league games."
12,31/08/2019,22:10,Ten-man Lyon slip up with home draw against Bordeaux,Ten-man Lyon dropped points in Ligue 1 for the second straight match as Sylvinho's side were held to a 1-1 draw at the Groupama Stadium by Bordeaux.,"A busy transfer window and thumping victories in their opening two games of the season had raised hopes that Lyon could challenge reigning champions Paris Saint-Germain for the title. But the midweek 1-0 loss to Montpellier was followed with another disappointing performance, as Jimmy Briand grabbed Bordeaux a point midway through the second half after Memphis Depay's opener and Thiago Mendes' sending off. ""The sending off of Thiago Mendes penalised us. It seemed to me that it was an exaggerated (fall),"" said Sylvinho, who replaced Bruno Genesio as Lyon coach in May. ""I am sad about the result and the sending off."" Depay fired the hosts into a 32nd-minute lead with a low, left-footed strike after racing away from the visiting defence and has now scored four league goals in as many games this season. But the dismissal of Mendes, a close-season signing from Lille, for a second yellow card changed the match and Briand equalised in the 67th minute after a goalmouth scramble. ""It's very hard to digest, clearly two points lost, but the good thing is that we did not lose,"" said Lyon goalkeeper Anthony Lopes. ""We lacked focus and maturity to finish the game XI against XI."" Rennes will put Ligue 1's last 100 percent record on the line against Nice on Sunday, but only need a point to retake top spot from PSG, who beat Metz 2-0 on Friday. Elsewhere on Saturday, promoted Brest suffered their first defeat of the season with a 3-0 loss at Nimes, while Angers moved into third by beating pointless Dijon 2-0."
13,06/08/2019,16:53,Wantaway Koscielny departs Arsenal for Bordeaux,Arsenal captain Laurent Koscielny completed a return to France on Tuesday after agreeing a reported three-year deal with Ligue 1 club Bordeaux.,"The French international, 33, made clear his desire for a move last month when he refused to travel on Arsenal's pre-season tour of the United States. His standoff with the club reportedly came after the Gunners rejected his request to be released from the final year of his contract. Koscielny was understood to be keen to move back to his homeland after nine seasons with Arsenal, having joined the Gunners in 2010 from Lorient. ""The club is delighted to be able to count on a player with such experience at the highest level,"" Bordeaux said in a statement, after paying a fee believed to be worth between five and six million euros for Koscielny. He played 353 games for Arsenal, winning the FA Cup three times, and was named club captain at the start of last season following the retirement of Per Mertesacker. ""We thank Laurent for his contribution to the club and wish him all the best for the future,"" Arsenal said in a statement. Koscielny made just 17 league appearances last term after sitting out the first half of the campaign as he recovered from a ruptured Achilles tendon. The centre-back missed France's 2018 World Cup triumph after sustaining the injury just before coach Didier Deschamps named his squad. Koscielny earned the last of his 51 France caps in March 2018. He said in October he had intended to retire from international duty after the tournament in Russia."

15,12/05/2019,23:33,Lille on verge of Champions League as Marseille fans revolt,"Loic Remy scored for the third game running as Lille all but secured a place in next season's Champions League group stage, while Marseille fans vented their anger towards players in a dismal 3-0 home defeat by Lyon.","Former France forward Remy smashed in a volley from a clever free-kick on 27 minutes to hand Lille a 1-0 win over Bordeaux and keep them six points clear of Lyon with two games to play. Christophe Galtier's team are virtually guaranteed second place owing to a far superior goal difference, a remarkable turnaround after the club narrowly avoided relegation last season. Bordeaux's turbulent end to the campaign will see them finish with their lowest points total since 2004-05 as they suffered a fifth successive defeat. Lyon's team bus was pelted with stones upon its arrival in Marseille, while home supporters displayed a series of banners lambasting the club's failures this season as Rudi Garcia's side were eliminated from European contention in abject fashion. ""You don't have the shoulders or the balls to wear the shirt, get lost"" read one banner at the Stade Velodrome, where Marseille fell behind to a Maxwel Cornet goal in the 25th minute. The mood soured further when Duje Caleta-Car was dismissed on 67 minutes after hauling back Martin Terrier as the Lyon forward skipped clear of the defence. Moussa Dembele doubled Lyon's lead on 84 minutes and Cornet added his second shortly after, prompting calls for Garcia and other club officials to resign as a section of home fans tried to invade the pitch. Lyon pulled four points clear of bitter regional rivals Saint-Etienne in third, and could qualify directly for the Champions League if Chelsea win the Europa League final against Arsenal on May 29. Earlier on Sunday, Guingamp's six-year stint in the top flight came to an end after Marcus Thuram missed a stoppage-time penalty in a 1-1 draw at Rennes."

""It's too early to know if he'll play against Barcelona. He has a little issue with his hamstring. We'll do everything we have to so he plays, but we have to wait until Sunday,"" Genesio told Canal+. Genesio added he plans to talk to the club's doctor after extra tests are carried out on the centre-back on Sunday. Moussa Dembele scored twice for Lyon at the Stade de la Meinau before Ludovic Ajorque claimed a double of his own in the space of 60 seconds during the second half. Club skipper Nabil Fekir, forward Bertrand Traore, attacker Memphis Depay as well as midfielder Tanguy Ndombele started on the bench as Genesio attempted to rest the influential four as the French club eye a first quarter-final in Europe's top-tier competition since 2010. Fekir and Traore were brought on during the last quarter of an hour looking for a late winner but their efforts were in vain. Lyon remain in third place in the table, four points behind Lille who travel to Saint Etienne on Sunday. Elsewhere big-spending Monaco dropped down to 17th place after a 1-1 draw against Bordeaux as 10-man Amiens beat mid-table Nimes 2-1 to move to 16th and Dijon rose out of the automatic relegation places with a 1-1 stalemate against Reims."
17,15/02/2019,02:35,Bucking the trend: Maja has stars in his eyes as he swaps League One for Ligue 1,"Josh Maja is different to most young English footballers -- at barely 20, he has already been a star on Netflix and has now chosen to join the restricted group of Brits looking to further their careers abroad.","The striker, who featured prominently in the streaming service's 'Sunderland 'Til I Die' documentary last year, had been linked with a move to the Premier League before signing for Ligue 1 outfit Bordeaux in January on a four-and-a-half-year deal. In doing so, he bucked the trend, with players moving across the English Channel usually going the other way. ""I just felt I'd get more opportunities abroad, so that was the main reason I left and I thought in France, at Bordeaux, I'd get an opportunity to make a name for myself and go from there,"" the Londoner told AFP. Bordeaux are not rushing to throw in the youngster, but he is hoping to make his debut in French football when his new club host Toulouse this Sunday. In the meantime, Maja -- who is exactly one week younger than Kylian Mbappe -- got his first sample of Ligue 1 last weekend as an unused substitute when American-owned Bordeaux lost 1-0 to Paris Saint-Germain. ""If he judged that by coming here he would have more opportunities to play, I think he made the right choice,"" said Bordeaux's former French international forward Jimmy Briand. Having played his last game for Sunderland in a 1-1 draw at Scunthorpe United in the English third-tier League One last month, being in Paris was quite a change of surroundings for Maja. As he spoke at the Parc des Princes, Gianluigi Buffon gave him a passing tap on the shoulder and a smile. ""I'm around probably the biggest names in world football, so that is just a blessing. I'm grateful,"" he said. Maja was with Sunderland in the Premier League two seasons ago, but it was their relegation to the Championship in 2017 that paved the way to the first team for him. He scored on his league debut, but a difficult campaign ended with the Black Cats being relegated again. Netflix's insight into the club's continued descent down through the divisions was gripping, but was it not all a little uncomfortable for Maja? ""I didn't really take notice of it. Obviously they had a job to do, and I wasn't really bothered with the cameras around,"" he says. Maja scored 15 goals in the first half of this season in a Sunderland side now fighting to win promotion. However, Bordeaux's reported offer of four million euros ($4.56 million) for a player out of contract at the end of the campaign was too good to refuse. His new life offers plenty of challenges, but his early impressions of life in south-west France are good. Bordeaux, he says, is ""a beautiful city, with nice food, nice people, very historic."" His family will soon join him as he settles and learns a new language. ""I've got four and a half years here, so I've got all that time to settle in and make a name for myself, develop, improve as a player and a person, and that's why I'm pleased to be here."" Jadon Sancho's success at Borussia Dortmund has shown what young English players can achieve abroad, and Maja has joined a small sprinkling of English players in France, including teenagers Reo Griffiths at Lyon and Jonathan Panzo at Monaco. He knows that Ligue 1 could serve as a stepping stone for an eventual move to the Premier League. And Maja, raised in Pimlico in central London, admits the prospect of one day playing for his boyhood heroes Arsenal might be too good to refuse. ""Yeah obviously that is a dream, that is the team I support, so it would be a great opportunity to play there."" Ligue 1 weekend fixtures (GMT)"
18,05/02/2019,22:36,Marseille earn first home win in three months at empty Velodrome,Marseille won for the first time at home since November as they beat Bordeaux 1-0 behind closed doors in Ligue 1 on Tuesday.,"The fixture was played at an empty Stade Velodrome as the hosts were punished by the French football league (LFP) for crowd trouble during the January defeat to Lille. The home side's Europa League tie against Eintracht Frankfurt in September was also played in an empty Velodrome due to supporter behaviour. Coach Rudi Garcia was absent from the touchline after he was suspended for two matches by the LFP for his behaviour towards the referee after the Lille clash. Garcia complained about the lack of fans in the 60,000 capacity ground. ""It's bad, these matches behind closed doors are horrible. I said it the first time and it was horrible again this time,"" he said. ""It's not football without supporters in the stadium. My suspension is also difficult but the most important thing was the absence of the fans."" Garcia was without six of his first-choice players including transfer window signing Mario Balotelli and had to rely on Boubacar Kamara's goal for a first home win since beating Dijon on November 11. Bordeaux played with 10 men for more than an hour of play as Samuel Kalu was shown a red card for a reckless tackle on Lucas Ocampos. The Nigerian dived in with both feet and caught Ocampos on his shin with a badly-timed tackle. The clearest opportunity in the opening half-hour for Marseille came as Hiroki Sakai's header was tipped over the bar by Benoit Costil. Sakai was making his first Marseille appearance since returning as a runner-up in the Asian Cup. Teenager Kamara's first league goal of his career came three minutes before the break. Valere Germain deflected Bouna Sarr's corner across goal and Kamara was free to head in an easy finish at the back post with the players' celebrations echoing around the empty Velodrome. In the second half, Jimmy Briand went close for Bordeaux on 56 minutes with a powerful half-volley which Steve Mandanda guided away from danger with their most promising opportunity of the match. Germain wasted a chance to double the lead with a quarter of an hour of play remaining as his glancing header flew past Costil's post following Nemanja Radonjic's low cross from the right. Marseille climb to seventh place in the table ahead of travelling to Dijon on Friday, and Bordeaux stay in 12th before heading to champions Paris Saint-Germain on Saturday."

Jardim, who led Monaco to the French title in 2017, is returning to the club only three months after he was dismissed following a dreadful start to the season. His first game back in charge will be Tuesday's League Cup semi-final against Guingamp, as Henry's former assistant Franck Passi oversaw the trip to fellow strugglers Dijon. The abject nature of this latest defeat further emphasised Monaco's perilous position in the table where they remain second from bottom, a point above last-placed Guingamp. ""We're giving everything but it's not enough,"" said Monaco captain Radamel Falcao. ""Each player has to continue to give more, all of us together. We're all in the same boat. ""We didn't manage to change things with Thierry Henry and now we must carry on with a better spirit and all fight together."" Dijon's Kwon Chang-hoon notched his first league goal since May, having recently returned from an Achilles injury, with a calm finish on 24 minutes after a static Naldo played the South Korean onside. Monaco were reduced to 10 men on the hour when Brazilian Naldo saw red for a clumsy challenge on Julio Tavares, and another defensive lapse allowed Naim Sliti to wrap up what was just Dijon's second league win since August. It was Naldo's second red card in a week after he was also dismissed in the 5-1 loss to Strasbourg last Saturday. ""We had chances just like in the past four of five matches but we always make a mistake that kills us,"" said Passi, who refused to be drawn on his own future. ""We let the other team go ahead and we're chasing after the result and that obviously makes it harder,"" he added. ""These players have the quality. They have what it takes to stay up but they just need for things to click and for it to happen quickly."" Youcef Atal and Allan Saint-Maximin scored for Patrick Vieira's Nice in a 2-0 home win over Nimes, while Kenny Lala fired home a sweet half-volley with practically the final kick to give Strasbourg a 1-0 victory over Bordeaux.

21,13/12/2018,21:52,"Bordeaux owner ready to take on PSG ""bullies""","Bordeaux's new American owners have branded Ligue 1 rivals Paris Saint-Germain the ""bullies"" of French football and are ready to ""go to war"" in a bid to wrestle the championship from their grasp.","Last month, the six-time champions -- who last won the title in 2009 -- were purchased by GACP Sports, a division of Miami-based, private-equity firm General American Capital Partners (GACP), after finally agreeing to a $114 million deal with M6 Group, who have been in charge since 1999. Bordeaux are currently languishing in 12th place in Ligue 1, a whopping 23 points adrift of leaders PSG, who are 13 points clear of their nearest rivals. But GACP's CEO and co-founder, Joseph DaGrosa, does not fear PSG and is determined to establish a more level playing field while acknowledging Bordeaux cannot compete with the Qatar-backed club's wealth. ""It's not easy,"" DaGrosa told AFP when asked about how Bordeaux could loosen PSG's grip on French football. ""We can't compete toe-to-toe against PSG, dollar-for-dollar. It's insane. I mean, I don't have oil in my backyard, so at the end of the day, we have to find a different way to compete, and we think that means getting to young talent first. ""Let them pay the big money for the big players. We want to be first to attract the best players in France, who have been producing some of the best talent in the world."" DaGrosa declined to be drawn on the controversy over PSG's alleged breaches of financial fair play rules, but said Bordeaux would not be afraid of battling PSG. ""I'm putting aside the issue of whether PSG played fairly -- and I have different views on that, which I'll express on a different day,"" he said. ""But, in general, everyone is scared to death of PSG. I view them as the bullies of the league. ""That's how I view them. We're here to win. It may take us a while, but we're here to win. ""You have to adapt to the warrior within. It's a war."" DaGrosa, a keen supporter of the New York Mets baseball team, looked at investing in the English Premier League and Spain's La Liga before eventually setting his sights on Bordeaux. He aims to spend a majority of the season in Bordeaux and, unlike fellow American owners such as Stan Kroenke at Arsenal and the Glazer family at Manchester United, the native New Yorker aims to be an accessible, fan-friendly custodian of the team. ""The fans want a championship team. They want it all,"" said DaGrosa, who was speaking at the recent US conference for London-based SoccerEx, in which his company also made a strategic investment. ""I remember when I was young, I was a fan of the New York Mets baseball team,"" DaGrosa said. ""If I ever in my life had the opportunity to talk to the owner of the Mets, I'd say we want to win at whatever cost, whatever you need to do, just do it. ""I mean, the average fan doesn't really think about the economics. ""The fans are working all week. They have to pay the bills. Sports is entertainment and our job is to deliver an entertaining product."" No stranger to turning things around, DaGrosa's previous restructuring missions saw him resuscitate nearly 250 struggling Burger King restaurants in the United States. However, the 54-year-old investor and entrepreneur readily admits that attempting to restore Bordeaux to the apex of French football is a completely different task. ""This is certainly more fun,"" he said. ""I love people, I love engaging with fans, and I love their passion for the sport. I love it all."""
22,02/12/2018,23:52,Neymar injury concern after Bordeaux end PSG's flawless run,Paris Saint-Germain are again sweating on Neymar's fitness on Sunday after the superstar attacker left the field at Bordeaux clutching his groin before Andreas Cornelius' late header ended the French champions perfect start to the Ligue 1 season.,"Brazilian Neymar was substituted 57 minutes into the hugely entertaining 2-2 draw the Matmut Atlantique stadium, in which he had opened the scoring and had looked in great form before having to head to the dressing room with what looks to be an injury to the same adductor muscle that nearly stopped him from scoring the decisive goal in Wednesday's huge 2-1 win over Liverpool. ""I don't know at all (what his injury is). We have to be careful, he said it was not a problem to play tonight but the pitch was hard and I hope he will be in good shape after Strasbourg,"" said PSG coach Thomas Tuchel, referring to his side's must-win final Champions League group game at Red Star Belgrade in nine days' time. The Ligue 1 leaders, who had won all 14 of their league matches going into Sunday's pulsating clash, had to wait until the last minute to see if Neymar and strike partner Kylian Mbappe would be ready for the win over the Reds, who now face an uphill battle for qualification to the Champions League last 16 thanks to Neymar's first-half winner last week. The pair twice put PSG in front on Sunday, but Jimmy Briand and Cornelius ensured that Bordeaux became the first French team to stop the runaway leaders this season. However the result is unlikely to slow down PSG's march to the title, as they still stand 14 points ahead of nearest challengers Montpellier, who took advantage of Lyon drawing 2-2 at Lille to sneak into second with a 2-1 win at Thierry Henry's struggling Monaco on Saturday. PSG's arch rivals Marseille failed to make the most of their fellow Champions League chasers dropping points after a goalless draw at Reims on Sunday. Rudi Garcia's side stay fifth. Meanwhile mid-table Toulouse drew 2-2 with with fellow relegation rivals Dijon and Strasbourg routed Rennes 4-1. Neymar's opener for PSG came after a spell of concerted Bordeaux pressure and at the end of a superb exchange with countryman Dani Alves, who on his first start of the season flashed in a powerful cross that was crashed home first-time by number 10. His 11th league goal of the season took some time to be awarded however, as the VAR dithered over whether Mbappe was offside and interfering with the play as he flashed a leg at Neymar's shot. That goal looked to have broken Bordeaux, and Angel Di Maria, who had fluffed a golden chance laid on for him by Neymar earlier in the half, then struck the post in first-half stoppage time as the home side rocked under pressure. However the hosts fought back again after the break, and they got their first reward when Briand slotted home a fine cross from the lively Yann Karamoah. Neymar was substituted shortly afterwards and Bordeaux smelled blood, but Mbappe turned the match in PSG's favour, latching on to Julian Draxler's through ball before crashing home what looked to be the winner and almost immediately asking to be substituted with an apparent muscle problem. Tuchel didn't remove the 19-year-old however, and he was there to see Cornelius meet Maxime Poundje's cross with such force that PSG keeper Alphonse Areola couldn't stop his header from crossing the line and ending PSG's 100 percent start."
23,12/11/2018,00:10,Cavani bags hat-trick as perfect PSG leave Henry's Monaco down and out,Thierry Henry's disastrous start as coach of Monaco continued on Sunday as Edinson Cavani's VAR-assisted hat-trick helped Paris Saint-Germain to an easy 4-0 win in the principality that saw them extend their perfect record in Ligue 1 this season.,"Neymar netted a penalty to complete PSG's victory, as they made it 13 wins from 13 league games under Thomas Tuchel, further stretching their start to the season that is a record in France and in Europe's so-called big five leagues. The result for them came after a week marred by revelations from French investigative website Mediapart that youth scouts at PSG had subjected potential signings to racial profiling over several years. But while they go 13 points clear of second-placed Lille at the Ligue 1 summit, the club who have been their main challengers in recent seasons continued their deeply worrying slump, with Henry again left to look on helplessly from the touchline. Champions in 2017, Monaco are in the relegation zone and five points away from outright safety having failed to win in six matches in all competitions since the Arsenal and France great took charge. They have now gone 16 games without a win altogether, with this result following a 4-0 home reverse against Club Brugge which knocked them out of the Champions League. Monaco are on their worst run in France's top flight in 32 years, at a time when Football Leaks claims about their Financial Fair Play breaches and the arrest of their Russian billionaire owner Dmitry Rybolovlev on corruption charges have cast a further shadow over the club. ""We are playing for survival, nothing else,"" said Henry, who has picked up a squad cursed by injuries. Here he was missing a dozen players due either to injury or suspension at kick-off, while both Belgian international Nacer Chadli and his replacement Jordi Mboula had to come off hurt. ""We lost two more players tonight, so it is starting to become a lot,"" he said, adding: ""I am staying positive because even with all that we managed to create chances against PSG."" The average age of his bench here was under 19, while his starting line-up featured a 17-year-old debutant in defence in Benoit Badiashile. It was little wonder that PSG -- themselves showing six changes following their Champions League draw at Napoli -- found the going so easy. They went ahead in the fourth minute when Neymar drove the ball across goal for Cavani to convert. The goal was initially disallowed before being given by the Video Assistant Referee, and the same thing happened in the 11th minute when Cavani turned the ball in again after the flag was wrongly raised for an offside against Moussa Diaby. In contrast to those two goals, a fine Julian Draxler finish in first-half stoppage time was initially given before being disallowed on review. However, Diaby squared for Cavani to complete his hat-trick in the 54th minute, and Neymar then rolled in a penalty after Kylian Mbappe had been fouled by France teammate Djibril Sidibe. ""I am very satisfied with the result, and with the fact we showed the hunger to win a 13th straight game. That is extraordinary,"" said Tuchel. ""Monaco and Henry are in a very difficult situation with lots of players out injured. This wasn't the night for Monaco to challenge us. They can do that if they have all their players back but not today."" Elsewhere on Sunday, Lucas Ocampos and Adil Rami scored as Marseille bounced back from a run of four straight defeats to beat Dijon 2-0 on an emotional afternoon at the Velodrome. A minute's silence was held before kick-off in memory of the eight people killed when two buildings collapsed in the southern French city on Monday. The result lifted Marseille up to sixth, back to within three points of third-placed Montpellier, who beat them 3-0 last weekend. Bordeaux were held to a goalless draw by Caen, while Rennes drew 1-1 with local rivals Nantes."
24,23/10/2018,13:08,French club Bordeaux's sale to US fund on hold,"The sale of French Ligue 1 club Bordeaux to US investment fund General American Capital Partners (GACP), expected Tuesday, has been put back 15 days, the club announced.","French media group M6, owners of the club since 1999, were expected to sign over ownership to GACP at a meeting in Paris in a deal worth 75 million euros ($86.6 million). ""The 15-day delay is due to an administrative problem,"" Bordeaux president Stephane Martin told AFP without going into detail. Local newspaper Sud Ouest reported that the hold up was linked to a ""delay in the placement of funds"" required for the acquisition by the buyers. Nicolas De Tavernost, the M6 CEO, said the delay was of no concern and the sale was assured. ""There is no reason to be concerned,"" he said, referring to ""a technical matter"" related to the financial structuring of the deal. Local French officials removed the last obstacle to the sale on October 12 when the city's municipal council voted overwhelmingly to approve the American takeover. The deal comes two years after Ligue 1 rivals Marseille were bought by US real estate magnate Frank McCourt, the former Los Angeles Dodgers owner, for 45 million euros. The council vote officially authorised the transfer of rental obligations for the club's Matmut Atlantique ground, owned by the city, from M6 to the US fund. Bordeaux are among the most successful French clubs, winning the Ligue 1 title six times. Currently they stand eighth in the table"
25,22/10/2018,00:06,Vieira's Nice continue to struggle with Marseille loss,Patrick Vieira's Nice slumped to a fourth defeat in five home league games this season as Morgan Sanson's first-half strike fired Marseille to a 1-0 win in Ligue 1 on Sunday.,"It was a laboured performance from Nice, who sit 14th in the table and only two points above the relegation play-off spot, eight points adrift of fourth-placed Marseille. Vieira may need a good run of results if he is to keep his job long enough to take on former Arsenal and France teammate Thierry Henry when his side visit Monaco on December 8. ""Unfortunately, tonight's match reflects our other home games,"" said Vieira. ""(Forwards) Allan (Saint-Maximin), Mario (Balotelli) and Myziane (Maolida) have not been successful. In the last 30 metres there has been a lack of quality, we haven't always made the right choices."" For Marseille, all eyes will now be on next Sunday's clash with arch rivals and runaway league leaders Paris Saint-Germain at the Velodrome. The hosts went into the match having mustered only seven goals in nine league games this season, and Vieira responded by handing Mario Balotelli just his third start of the campaign up front. The first decent chance at the Allianz Riviera fell to the Italy international, but after latching onto a long ball forward from Dante his well-struck volley was kept out by the legs of Marseille goalkeeper Steve Mandanda. A clever dummy from Balotelli created space for Allan Saint-Maximin, but his shot was tame and easily gathered by Mandanda. The away side grabbed the lead in the 42nd minute, though, as full-back Bouna Sarr skipped clear down the right-hand side and crossed for Sanson to smartly turn and fire into the bottom corner. Nice plugged away in search of an equaliser but never looked like having the quality to break through, with centre-back Dante's looping volley onto the roof of the net the best effort Vieira's men could muster. Balotelli, who was strongly linked with Marseille during the close-season before opting to stay at Nice, has failed to score this term after netting 43 goals over the last two campaigns. ""Mario? He was just like the team -- very good in the first half, then he wasn't as good. He still has to work,"" said Vieira. Earlier on Sunday, Montpellier moved into third as goals from Gaetan Laborde and Andy Delort sealed a 2-0 win over Bordeaux, while Saint-Etienne drew 1-1 against Rennes. Henry suffered a miserable return to French football on Saturday as Monaco lost at Strasbourg in his first match as a head coach, while PSG thrashed Amiens to make it 10 successive wins to start the season."

Ricardo, a central defender, played 45 times for Brazil. Since first moving to management at Paris Saint-Germain in 1999, he has coached Monaco, eight clubs in his native Brazil and the national Olympic team. He was sporting director at Santos before accepting the Bordeaux offer. Former Arsenal striker and current Belgium assistant coach Thierry Henry came close to taking the post last week but backed out because the club were in the process of being sold. Former coach Gustavo Poyet was sacked by Bordeaux two weeks ago, following a public row with the board over the sale of striker Gaetan Laborde to Ligue 1 rivals Montpellier against Poyet's wishes."
27,28/08/2018,10:07,Henry not joining Bordeaux as talks break down,"Thierry Henry will not be the next coach of Bordeaux, with the French club's president confirming to AFP on Tuesday that negotiations had broken down.","""Yes, we can confirm the end of those negotiations,"" Stephane Martin told AFP, following earlier reports in France and England that Henry had turned the job down. Sky Sports, the channel for whom Henry worked as a pundit for four years before quitting last month, said late on Monday that he had refused the offer to take his first managerial role since retiring as a player. According to French sports daily L'Equipe, Henry felt that he had not been given sufficient guarantees by General American Capital Partners (GACP), the American consortium expected to take over Bordeaux at the end of September from current owners, the media conglomerate M6. Despite his lack of experience as a coach, appointing the 41-year-old would have been a remarkable coup for Bordeaux, the six-time French champions. They are looking for a replacement for the Uruguayan Gustavo Poyet, whose departure from the club is expected to be made official later on Tuesday. Poyet was only appointed in January and led the club to European qualification at the end of last season, but he was suspended earlier this month after a very public outburst at directors over transfer policy. Henry, who had been working as an assistant coach to the Belgian national team, met GACP in New York at the end of last week having come to an initial agreement with M6. According to reports, however, Bordeaux were surprised by his salary demands given his lack of experience as a coach. Reports say he also wanted three new signings before the transfer window closes at the end of this week. Bordeaux had already been turned down by former coach Laurent Blanc and Remi Garde, another ex-Arsenal player who is now at Montreal Impact in Major League Soccer. As their search for a successor to Poyet goes on, interim coach Eric Bedouet is set to take charge of the team in their next game, the Europa League play-off, second leg at home to Belgian club Gent on Thursday."
28,27/08/2018,00:21,Bordeaux beat Monaco and say Thierry Henry could still come,Bordeaux grabbed their first points of the season as they beat Monaco 2-1 at home on Sunday and the club's owner insisted Thierry Henry could still join as coach.,"Francois Kamano's superb curled finish in second-half injury time added to the Guinean's 48th-minute penalty for Bordeaux at the Matmut Atlantique. That spot-kick had been cancelled out by Pietro Pellegri's 63rd minute finish for Monaco but after Kamano's late piece of brilliance they slipped to their first defeat of the season. At the Velodrome, a spectacular headed own goal by Ramy Bensebaini rescued Marseille after they fell behind to Rennes. The match ended 2-2. Nicolas de Tavernost, the owner of Bordeaux until the end of September, said ""all options are open"" following French media reports Sunday that former Monaco and Arsenal great Henry had turned down an offer to become coach. The club is in the process of firing previous manager Gus Poyet. ""No decision until next week,"" de Tavernost said. ""We are working day and night to have the best coach possible."" ""It's not easy."" Earlier in the day Paris Match magazine said 41-year-old Henry intended to say 'no' to Bordeaux at the start of next week because of the ""lack of certainty over the club's future"". French TV station Canal Plus also reported that Henry would rebuff the approach. De Tavernost's TV station M6, which has owned Bordeaux since 1999, has agreed to sell the club to US investment fund GACP. Poyet was suspended by Bordeaux last week following a public row with the board over transfer dealings, and on Friday morning, the Uruguayan met president Stephane Martin at the club's Chateau du Haillan base. On the Cote d'Azur, Marseille were ragged in the first half as World Cup winner Adil Rami conceded a penalty converted by Benjamin Bourigeaud and reserve goalkeeper Yohann Pele then spilled the ball into the path of Ismaila Sarr. Argentinian winger Lucas Ocampos pulled one back in the 54th minute before Algerian international defender Bensebaini directed a header into his own net, giving Marseille a share of the points. Marseille look set to be boosted by the arrival of Dutch midfielder Kevin Strootman from Roma after the Italian club's coach Eusebio Di Francesco said Sunday that ""negotiations are in progress"" with the Ligue 1 club."
29,23/08/2018,23:59,Henry fever grips France amid Bordeaux links,"Thierry Henry is the name on everybody's lips in France just now, with the Arsenal legend tipped to return to his home country as the next coach of Bordeaux.","The south-western club's start to the season has been marred by a public row between Uruguayan coach Gustavo Poyet and the board over transfers. Poyet, who took over in January and led Bordeaux to European qualification, was suspended for a week and now looks set to be shown the door. In the meantime, media reports in France say Henry, 41, is keen on the idea of succeeding Poyet at a club who are set to be taken over by American investors. Henry, France's all-time record goal-scorer, retired as a player in 2014 and has worked as an assistant coach for the last two years with Belgium. Lyon coach Bruno Genesio this week likened Henry's coaching trajectory to that of his former France teammate Zinedine Zidane, an ex-Bordeaux player. ""Henry's path is similar. He has done his training, taken different jobs where he has had experience of working with a group of players,"" said Genesio. If Henry does arrive, he would follow in the footsteps of another 1998 World Cup winner -- Patrick Vieira took over at Nice in the close season. Genesio added: ""They are former players who have had a big impact on the French game. They bring a lot of media interest and I think it's good for French football."" Bordeaux have had a terrible start to the campaign, losing their opening two games, including a 2-1 defeat at Toulouse last weekend under interim coach Eric Bedouet. They took on Gent in Belgium in the Europa League on Thursday and on Sunday will face Monaco, Henry's first club. There is already a familiar name at the top of Ligue 1, with champions Paris Saint-Germain having maximum points after Kylian Mbappe came off the bench to score twice in a 3-1 win at Guingamp last weekend. That was Mbappe's first appearance since starring in France's World Cup triumph, and the 19-year-old will hope to start alongside Neymar when PSG host Angers. Newly-promoted outfits Reims and Nimes have also won both games so far, as have Dijon, who go to Vieira's Nice. Nice are still without the suspended Mario Balotelli, but at least the Italian striker is staying with the club after the collapse of a move to Marseille. Balotelli had been keen to leave, but Nice claimed Marseille refused to meet their asking price of five million euros ($5.8m). Nice president Jean-Pierre Rivere then revealed that the former Manchester City and Liverpool player informed the club of a change of heart this week. ""Mario told us he wanted to stay for another season. We never forced Mario to stay. In his mind he is 100 percent with us,"" Rivere told L'Equipe. For Marseille, losing out on Balotelli followed a chastening 3-1 defeat at Nimes. The news that Serbian winger Nemanja Radonjic is set to join from Red Star Belgrade is a boost ahead of their game against Rennes, however. After winning the World Cup with France, the 25-year-old Fekir was given time off by Lyon and so did not play in their opening two league games. But after a summer also marked by the collapse of a transfer to Liverpool, the Lyon skipper is back and set to play against Strasbourg on Friday. ""What happened was difficult for him to digest,"" coach Genesio said of his aborted transfer. ""But he is at Lyon, his home, and in the Champions League. It could be worse."""
30,22/08/2018,19:07,Henry linked with Bordeaux after Poyet suspension,France's leading international goalscorer Thierry Henry was Wednesday being touted as the next coach of Bordeaux who suspended Gustavo Poyet after just one league game of the season.,"Henry, a member of the 1998 World Cup winning team and who was part of Roberto Martinez's coaching staff with Belgium at the World Cup, was emerging as the overwhelming favourite after a fevered round of speculation which had linked Laurent Blanc, Jurgen Klinsmann and Claudio Ranieri with the job. According to RMC Sport, Henry would say 'yes' if approached while the 20 Minutes outlet claimed the former Arsenal striker will Thursday travel to the United States to meet the GACP group, the American investors who will officially take over the Ligue 1 club on September 28. However, the club refused to comment on reports linking 41-year-old Henry with the coaching hotseat especially with Poyet officially still the man in charge. Poyet was suspended last Friday for a week after an angry outburst at club bosses over their transfer policy. ""Technically everything is possible,"" said club president Stephane Martin in reference to Poyet's future, with a sacking looking a distinct possibility. The decision to suspend the Uruguayan comes after he launched a furious tirade at the Bordeaux board over their decision to sell the striker Gaetan Laborde to Ligue 1 rivals Montpellier."
31,17/08/2018,14:26,Bordeaux suspend coach Poyet after angry outburst,"Bordeaux have suspended coach Gustavo Poyet for a week after his angry outburst at club bosses over their transfer policy, the French side announced on Friday.","""Technically everything is possible,"" said club president Stephane Martin in reference to Poyet's future beyond next week, with a sacking looking a distinct possibility. The decision to suspend the Uruguayan comes after he launched a furious tirade at the Bordeaux board over their decision to sell the striker Gaetan Laborde to Ligue 1 rivals Montpellier. Poyet had hoped to have Laborde available for Thursday night's the second leg of their Europa League third qualifying round tie away to Mariupol of Ukraine, which his team won 2-1 to progress to the play-off round 5-2 on aggregate. ""This is my worst day at the club. What the club have done with Gaetan Laborde is a disgrace,"" an angry Poyet said at his post-match press conference. ""I told the club not to let him go as long as we haven't signed someone else."" Eric Bedouet, one of his assistants, will prepare the team for Sunday's derby match at Toulouse, and Bordeaux are also due to go to Belgium to face Genk in the Europa League next Thursday. Poyet was only appointed by the south-western side in January and he roused them to European qualification with six wins in their final seven games last season. However, the 50-year-old former Sunderland, AEK Athens, Betis and Shanghai Shenhua coach has regularly criticised the club for a lack of transfer activity over the summer. The six-time French champions had already sold Brazilian winger Malcom to Barcelona for 41 million euros ($48 million) before Laborde's departure. On Thursday they completed the loan signing of Barcelona B full-back Sergi Palencia. It now seems that he may not play under Poyet, who also ran into trouble at one of his previous clubs. In 2013, he was suspended for an alleged breach of contract and later fired by English side Brighton and Hove Albion. The latest difficulty comes with Bordeaux expected to be sold to an American consortium in the coming weeks."
32,24/07/2018,19:24,Barcelona sign Malcom from Bordeaux after Roma drama,Spanish champions Barcelona announced on Tuesday they have signed Brazilian winger Malcom from French side Bordeaux on a five-year deal for 41 million euros ($48 million).,"The signing comes after Bordeaux blocked the transfer of the 21-year-old to Italian giants Roma following a last-minute bid from the Catalan side on Monday. ""FC Barcelona and Girondins de Bordeaux have reached an agreement for the transfer of the player Malcom Filipe Silva de Oliveira. The operation will cost 41 million euros and 1 million in variables,"" Barcelona said in a statement. ""The player will sign with the club for the next five seasons, until the end of the 2022/23 season."" Malcom had been expected to arrive in Rome on Monday night for a medical on Tuesday before joining his future teammates on their pre-season tour of the United States the following day, but had his flight cancelled by the Ligue 1 outfit at the last moment. Barcelona made contact with Bordeaux following the failure to sign Brazil international Willian from Chelsea and, according to Italian media reports, made a bid larger than the reported fee of 38 million euros agreed with Roma. Malcom had been a reported target for several European clubs including Premier League sides Arsenal and Tottenham, but English clubs may have been put off from making a bid as he needed a UK work permit to play in the Premier League. He scored 12 goals in 35 league games for Bordeaux last season. Malcom, yet to be capped at senior level by Brazil, will arrive in Barcelona on Tuesday and undergo a medical the following day before joining the team on their US tour. Barcelona praised him as a ""daring, pacey forward with an ability to shoot from distance"" who has ""a great future ahead of him"". ""He stands out due to his electrifying pace and his technique with the ball at his feet,"" the club added. ""Aside from his speed, he also has great technical ability and links up well with his team-mates, one of the main aspects of Barca's football."" His signing leaves Ernesto Valverde's side well stocked across the forward line with Lionel Messi, Luis Suarez, Ousmane Dembele and now Malcom all competing for a place in the attack. Malcom is Barcelona's second Brazilian summer signing after Gremio midfielder Arthur, 21, joined in a 31-million-euro deal. Arthur was a star turn with Gremio as the Porto Alegre side lifted the Copa Libertadores, and was named as man of the match in the second leg of their final win over Argentina's Lanus."
33,05/05/2018,02:10,Five things to watch out for in Ligue 1 this weekend,"Fresh from becoming the first French side to reach a European final since 2004 with their Europa League victory over Salzburg, Marseille turn their attentions back to the fight for a top-three spot in Ligue 1 this weekend.","Rudi Garcia's men are locked in a fight with Lyon and Monaco for the two Champions League spots behind champions Paris Saint-Germain, with just two points separating the three clubs. Here are five things to watch out for in Ligue 1 this weekend: Monaco will have to make do without injured captain Radamel Falcao as they bid to end a three-match winless streak which has dragged them into the battle for the top three. Falcao will sit out Sunday's visit to Caen with a thigh injury, while Leonardo Jardim is also missing Keita Balde, Stevan Jovetic and Adama Diakhaby. Those injury woes could mean a full debut for 18-year-old Moussa Sylla in one of Monaco's biggest games of the season after a dreadful run which was kicked off by the calamitous 7-1 thrashing by PSG. The player to watch in Ligue 1 at the moment is undoubtedly Lyon's Memphis Depay. The Dutch forward had an up-and-down start to the season but has exploded into life since scoring a dramatic late winner against Marseille in March. The 24-year-old, who struggled after a big-money move to Manchester United three years ago, has now scored seven goals and assisted six in his last six league matches. A goal against relegation-threatened Troyes on Sunday would take him to 20 in all competitions for the season for the first time since his last campaign at PSV Eindhoven in 2014/15. Garcia's revolution is well underway at Marseille, with the former European champions on the brink of a return to the continent's premier competition. Victory in the Europa League final over Atletico Madrid in Lyon on May 16 would secure a Champions League spot for next season, but Monaco's recent slump has also boosted their chances of qualifying through Ligue 1. Marseille have not played in the Champions League since losing all six of their group-stage matches in 2013, but Rolando's extra-time strike in Salzburg on Thursday kept them fighting on two fronts, and they host Nice in the pick of the weekend's matches on Sunday. Like Marseille, Lille went into this season expecting a revival after an influx of new players under Marcelo Bielsa, but instead face the ingnominy of dropping out of the top flight for the first time since being promoted in 2000. Argentinian Bielsa has been locked in a bitter legal battle with the club since being sacked last December, while the team has never managed to get out of trouble. Christophe Galtier's side head to fellow strugglers Toulouse knowing that defeat would leave their fate out of their own hands. Lille sit second-bottom in the table, two points adrift of 17th-placed Toulouse and behind Troyes, who occupy the relegation play-off place, on goal difference. In February Saint-Etienne were fighting to avoid the drop, but head into their clash with Bordeaux in fifth place and leading Nice and Rennes by one point in the race for the Europa League. They are unbeaten in 13 league matches, having won just once in their previous 13 outings. Ligue 1 fixtures on Sunday (all times GMT) Saint-Etienne v Bordeaux (1300), Lyon v Troyes (1430), Caen v Monaco, Dijon v Guingamp, Metz v Angers, Nantes v Montpellier, Rennes v Strasbourg, Toulouse v Lille (all 1500), Marseille v Nice (1905)"
34,22/04/2018,23:13,Lo Celso hits late winner for champions PSG,Giovani Lo Celso's late goal gave champions Paris Saint-Germain a hard-earned 1-0 win at Bordeaux in Ligue 1 on Sunday as they stayed on course to finish their season with a clutch of records.,"Argentine playmaker Lo Celso scored twice in last week's 7-1 demolition of Monaco that secured a fifth title in six seasons for PSG, and he smashed in the only goal of the game in Bordeaux with 14 minutes remaining. A corner came off Edinson Cavani and fell to Lo Celso, who drove a low, left-footed strike into the net from 20 yards to sink the home side. With Neymar still nowhere near a return from a foot operation, Paris also needed goalkeeper Alphonse Areola to be in inspired form at times to stave off Gustavo Poyet's Bordeaux, for whom the defeat all but ends their chances of qualifying for the Europa League. With 90 points, PSG are on course to break their own Ligue 1 points record of 96 set two years ago under Laurent Blanc, and they could yet become the first team to reach 100 points in the French top flight. They could also still beat RC Paris' record of 118 goals in a single season dating back to 1960, although they have 104 to their name and just four matches remaining. Elsewhere on Sunday, Robert Beric scored a second-half brace as Saint-Etienne came from behind to beat Troyes 2-1, continuing their remarkable revival since the turn of the year. Adama Niane had given relegation-threatened Troyes the lead early on at the Stade Geoffroy-Guichard, but Beric headed in the home side's equaliser in the 69th minute. The Slovenian striker, who had been introduced as a half-time substitute, then turned in a low centre by Romain Hamouma six minutes later to make it 2-1. That was his seventh league goal since being recalled from a loan spell at Anderlecht in January, and the win allowed Les Verts to extend their remarkable unbeaten run to 12 games. The turnaround at the 10-time former champions coincided with the appointment of veteran Jean-Louis Gasset as head coach. He has taken a team who were 16th in the table less than three months ago, up to sixth, just a point off a Europa League berth with four matches remaining. Nice are fifth after beating Montpellier 1-0."
35,03/03/2018,22:35,Di Maria on the mark as PSG turn focus to Real,"Angel Di Maria kept up his irresistible form as a Paris Saint-Germain side missing Neymar, Edinson Cavani and Kylian Mbappe defeated Troyes 2-0 ahead of their Champions League showdown with Real Madrid.","The Argentine notched his 13th goal in 14 starts this year during Saturday's visit to the Stade de l'Aube, which coincided with Neymar successfully undergoing an operation to repair a broken bone in his right foot. Academy product Christopher Nkunku marked his first start of the season with his first goal this term 13 minutes from time to complete a victory that left PSG 14 points clear of defending champions Monaco at the top of Ligue 1. ""Ahead of a big match and after (league and French Cup wins over) Marseille, I'm very happy because we kept up our level of play,"" PSG coach Unai Emery said. ""I want the players to be ready (against Real). The players all want to play and that makes the decision tougher for me, but it's better like that."" With a 3-1 deficit to overcome in the second leg of their last-16 tie against Real on Tuesday, Emery refused to risk Cavani while Mbappe stayed in Paris to continue treatment on an ankle injury sustained against Marseille in midweek. Marco Verratti was also rested for Saturday's trip, as Di Maria again took full advantage of the opportunity presented to several members of PSG's expensively assembled squad in the wake of Neymar's injury. Di Maria himself was feted as the player to turn PSG into genuine Champions League contenders when he signed from Manchester United for 63 million euros ($78 million) in 2015, and the 30-year-old has arguably been their best performer of late. ""Angel is an important player who has the quality to make the difference,"" Emery said. ""He's got both the confidence and the desire. We want the players to be at their best level on Tuesday, and for some like Angel, it will be a special moment."" Troyes goalkeeper Erwin Zelazny produced a series of saves to deny Di Maria, and then Giovani Lo Celso twice in the first half, but the home goal was breached after a defensive lapse on 47 minutes. A poor clearance followed by further miscommunication in the Troyes backline gifted Julian Draxler the opening to slide in Di Maria and the Argentine masterfully dinked the ball over an advancing Zelazny. Twenty-year-old Nkunku sealed the win on 77 minutes, picking out the far corner of the net after gathering a threaded pass from Dani Alves as the linesman's flag controversially stayed down. Troyes boss Jean-Louis Garcia and his assistant were both ordered to the stands after protesting the decision to allow the goal, with replays indicating Nkunku had strayed marginally offside. Emery then handed a first-team debut to Timothy Weah, as the son of former PSG star, and current Liberian president, George Weah replaced Lo Celso for the final few minutes. The 18-year-old US youth international, whose father won the 1995 Ballon d'Or, nearly bagged a debut goal in stoppage time after racing clear of the Troyes defence before being foiled by Zelazny. Goals from Wahbi Khazri and Ismaila Sarr propelled Rennes up to fifth courtesy of a 2-0 victory at Amiens, while Slovenia forward Robert Beric netted twice for Saint-Etienne in a 2-2 draw with Dijon. Angers pulled clear of the relegation zone with a 3-0 home win over Guingamp, but Metz remain firmly rooted to the bottom after conceding a late equaliser in a 1-1 draw against fellow strugglers Toulouse. On Friday, Rony Lopes scored his sixth goal in seven games as Monaco came from behind to beat Bordeaux 2-1 to tighten their grip on second place, with Marseille and Lyon not in action until Sunday."
36,18/02/2018,22:13,Netflix-funded banner sparks row at Marseille game,Plans for a group of Marseille supporters to unfurl a giant banner at Sunday's French league game at home to Bordeaux were scrapped after rival fans objected to Netflix financing its production.,"The global streaming service giant reportedly stumped up between 20,000 and 30,000 euros ($25,000-$37,000) to cover the costs while seeking to promote the second season of its ""Marseille"" television series. ""It's ruined, this tifo,"" Michel Tonini, leader of the fan group that commissioned the banner, told AFP. ""It's ridiculous. At the end of the day it's created the opposite effect when we just wanted to liven up the stadium."" He added: ""We prepared it ourselves, there's nothing to do with Netflix in it. They're just happy to have a tifo the day of their promotion."" But other fan groups were strongly opposed to the collaboration, with the head of another supporters' club notably unhappy with the way Marseille is portrayed in the series. ""I don't like it at all, it's already a crap series that sinks Marseille more than it shows it off,"" said Christian Cataldo. ""Bandits, drugs, they are in other places than just Marseille. I don't want to be associated with this series."" Faced with the controversy, Netflix decided to pull all advertisements inside the ground promoting the show featuring French actor Gerard Depardieu. The 69-year-old, who plays the city's mayor in the series, had been expected to take part in a ceremonial kick-off before the match, but those plans were also shelved due to fears over a negative crowd reaction."
37,28/01/2018,23:47,"Fabinho grabs Monaco point at Marseille, Bordeaux stun Lyon","Fabinho struck to secure French champions Monaco an entertaining 2-2 draw at southern rivals Marseille on Sunday, while Malcom was at the centre of a penalty controversy as Bordeaux stunned Lyon.","Both teams at the Stade Velodrome missed the chance to take second place from Lyon, with Paris Saint-Germain now 11 points clear at the Ligue 1 summit. Keita Balde gave the visitors a fourth-minute lead, but Marseille centre-back Adil Rami quickly levelled with a close-range header. The hosts moved in front shortly after half-time as Valere Germain headed in against his former club. But Fabinho waltzed through the hapless home defence to equalise for Monaco, denying Marseille a seventh straight win in all competitions and extending his team's unbeaten league run to eight matches. ""Fabinho played a big match today, not only for the goal but for his defensive quality and ability to break the line,"" said Monaco coach Leonardo Jardim. The chase for the Champions League places remains wide open in France, with Lyon, Marseille and Monaco separated by just one point in the hunt for the second and third spots behind PSG. ""One point each was fair. In the war for second place there are no easy games, and it will continue like this until May,"" Jardim added. Senegal striker Balde, a close-season signing from Lazio, pounced on a loose ball to race clear and clip home his sixth league goal for Monaco and give them the perfect start. But the lead lasted less than three minutes, as Monaco shot themselves in the foot. A low cross from Valere Germain caused havoc and Florian Thauvin put pressure on right-back Almamy Toure, who saw his clearance deflected straight into the air for Rami to nod in his first league goal for Marseille. The game settled down after its frenetic start, but Rudi Garcia's hosts should have forged ahead in the 27th minute when Dimitri Payet blazed over with the goal at his mercy. Marseille completed the turnaround in the 47th minute, as Payet whipped in a free-kick and Germain stooped to send a diving header past away goalkeeper Danijel Subasic. It was the 27-year-old's 12th goal for OM since joining from Monaco last July. The champions hit back four minutes later, though, as Brazilian midfielder Fabinho strolled straight through the middle of the Marseille backline and slotted the ball in off the post. Monaco thought they had retaken the lead, but Jemerson's header was ruled out by the linesman's flag, despite the defender not being one of two visiting players in an offside position when Rachid Ghezzal swung in a free-kick. Both sides had chances to snatch all three points, with Marseille keeper Steve Mandanda denying Ghezzal and Germain volleying agonisingly wide, but neither could find the winner they needed to go second. Brazilian star Malcom appeared to dive for a crucial penalty as 10-man Bordeaux upset high-flying Lyon 3-1 to give new coach Gustavo Poyet a winning start in Ligue 1. Malcom, the 50 million-euro ($62m, £44m) rated winger who has been linked with Arsenal, also scored the 27th-minute penalty to give Bordeaux a shock 2-0 lead. Poyet had already seen Nicolas De Preville put the home side in front in south-western France, with Gaetan Laborde scoring another penalty for the hosts after Marcelo had pulled one back for Lyon. Bordeaux had another Brazilian, Otavio, sent off after the break but they held on to make it two wins from two games since previous coach Jocelyn Gourvennec was sacked. The result was a big blow to Lyon, who had beaten PSG at home last weekend and then won at Monaco in the French Cup on Wednesday. PSG beat Montpellier 4-0 on Saturday, with Neymar scoring twice and Angel Di Maria also on target after Edinson Cavani got the opener to take him to a club record 157 goals in all competitions."
38,18/01/2018,16:45,Struggling Bordeaux sack coach Gourvennec,"Crisis-hit French Ligue 1 strugglers Bordeaux have fired their coach Jocelyn Gourvennec and cancelled the contract of captain Jeremy Toulalan, the club said on Thursday.","The move follows a 2-0 home defeat against Caen on Tuesday and the club have won just twice in 14 games since they were thrashed 6-2 by Paris Saint-Germain in September. They have lost nine of those games and are just two points above the bottom three, making 45-year-old Gourvennec's position untenable. The club have also been eliminated from both domestic cup competitions, having gone out of the Europa League in the third qualifying round in August. However, the move did not go down well with Bordeaux captain Toulalan, who has left the club out of solidarity with the former coach. Bordeaux said they had accepted a request from the former French international midfielder to be released from his contract which was due to expire at the end of this season. Toulalan, 34, had joined the club from Monaco in 2016 at the same time as Gourvennec arrived from a successful six-year stint at Brittany side Guingamp. Brazilian winger Malcom has been one of the few bright spots of Bordeaux's season but the 20-year-old is currently the target of transfer speculation, with Arsenal thought to be in prime position to clinch a deal worth around 50 million euros ($61.3 million). The six-time French champions have been playing to ever-decreasing crowds in their cavernous Matmut Atlantique stadium, completed just before Euro 2016. One of Gourvennec's assistants, Eric Bedouet, has been put in temporary charge. Reports in Belgium say former Belgian international goalkeeper Michel Preud'homme is the favourite to take the job."

They are just four points above the relegation zone and on a miserable run of form, with the 1-0 win at Troyes on Saturday just their second success in 13 games, a run that started with a 6-2 hammering by Paris Saint-Germain in late September."
42,30/09/2017,19:23,Neymar sparkles as PSG thrash Bordeaux,"Neymar scored twice, including a first-half penalty, and created another goal as Paris Saint-Germain hammered previously unbeaten Bordeaux 6-2 in Ligue 1 on Saturday.","The Brazilian curled in a brilliant 30-yard free-kick after just five minutes at the Parc des Princes before sliding in Edinson Cavani to double the lead seven minutes later. Thomas Meunier's excellent side-footed finish made it 3-0 to PSG on 21 minutes, but Bordeaux hit back on the half hour as Younousse Sankhare applied the final touch to a slick team move. PSG were then awarded a penalty, the first since a row between Neymar and Cavani over spot-kick duties overshadowed a 2-0 win against Lyon a fortnight ago, with Neymar this time stepping up to convert. ""For me the important thing with penalties is to score them,"" said PSG coach Unai Emery. ""The main thing is the two of them see the opportunity and they both can take penalties. The decision is down to those two. We've already spoken about it internally."" Julian Draxler volleyed in a superb fifth before half-time and Kylian Mbappe added another on 58 minutes, while Malcom scored a late penalty for Bordeaux, as PSG pulled three points clear of defending champions Monaco at the top. ""It was a good win against a team that was still undefeated,"" said Mbappe. ""We don't need to send a message, we're just concentrating on ourselves. We could still do better, we're not going to be picky, but there's still room for a bit more."" Emery rested captain Thiago Silva for the visit of third-place Bordeaux, who arrived in the capital trailing PSG by just four points after seven matches. The hosts brushed aside five-time European champions Bayern Munich 3-0 in midweek and the gap in class on Saturday was evident from the start against Jocelyn Gourvennec's team. With Monaco dropping points in Friday's 1-1 draw at home to Montpellier, PSG immediately signalled their intent as three quick-fire goals left Bordeaux seeking to limit the damage. Neymar struck early as his magnificent free-kick flashed beyond a helpless Benoit Costil, with the Brazilian then playing in Cavani to poke in his eighth league goal of the season on 12 minutes. PSG were further in front when Yuri Berchiche's cross from the left skipped past Mbappe but Meunier ran onto it and the Belgian international steered masterfully past Costil. Bordeaux replied on 31 minutes after Theo Pellenard demonstrated remarkable composure to thread in Nicolas de Preville who squared for Sankhare to tap into an empty net. But a senseless handball from Otavio gifted PSG a penalty and Neymar, rather than Cavani whose effort in the Lyon win on September 17 was saved, tucked away the spot-kick for his sixth league goal. Draxler made it five in style on the stroke of half-time when he fired in from Mbappe's floated cross, and the French teenager notched a goal of his own on 58 minutes after he was released in behind the defence by the German. Bordeaux substitute Alexandre Mendy smacked the outside of the post on 69 minutes, while Neymar nearly completed his hat-trick when his shot whistled just wide after a clever exchange with Draxler. Brazilian Malcom, who extended his contract with Bordeaux until 2021 this week, netted a consolation in the final minute after Jonathan Cafu was fouled in the area by Meunier."

His dynamic midfield performances in the Belgian top flight last season saw him earn his first cap with Denmark last week in a 1-1 draw with Germany."
44,31/07/2016,20:39,Menez to join Bordeaux from AC Milan,"France international Jeremy Menez is set to join Bordeaux from Italian giants AC Milan, pending a medcial, the Ligue 1 club announced on Sunday.","Menez would be Bordeaux's third signing ahead of the new season following the arrivals of veteran midfielder Jeremy Toulalan and Guinea striker Francois Kamano. The 29-year-old spent the past two seasons in Italy after joining Milan from Paris Saint-Germain, making an instant impression with 16 league goals in 33 appearances during the 2014-15 campaign. But the winger struggled with injury last term as Milan limped to a disappointing seventh-place finish in Serie A. Menez has been capped 24 times at international level but last played for France in 2013. Bordeaux had been looking to reinforce their attack after losing Mali striker Cheick Diabate, the club's leading scorer last season, to Turkish side Osmanlispor."
45,27/05/2016,17:32,Gourvennec quits Guingamp for Bordeaux,"Jocelyn Gourvennec has quit his coaching job at Guingamp and agreed terms instead with Ligue 1 rivals Bordeaux, the two clubs said on Friday.","""Guingamp confirms it has agreed terms with Bordeaux for the transfer of coach Jocelyn Gourvennec, and given them permission to negotiate,"" Guingamp said. Bordeaux sacked coach Willy Sagnol in March and replaced him with an interim boss, their former goalkeeper Ulrich Rame, and said they had now agreed terms with Gourvennec. ""Welcome Jocelyn,"" Bordeaux said on their Twitter page. Gourvennec led Guingamp out of the second tier two years ago and qualified them for the Europa League last season, before finishing this term just five points above the relegation zone. Former France coach Raymond Domenech is thought to be in the frame to take over the Guingamp hot seat."
46,11/05/2016,22:35,Bordeaux come from behind to hold PSG,Bordeaux recovered from falling behind to a Zlatan Ibrahimovic goal to hold champions Paris Saint-Germain to a 1-1 draw in a rearranged game in Ligue 1 on Wednesday.,"Ibrahimovic had put the visitors in front with his 36th league goal of a remarkable campaign just before the hour mark, but Nicolas Pallois equalised for Bordeaux shortly after. With PSG having been crowned champions in record quick time two months ago and Bordeaux safely in mid-table after pulling clear of trouble, this match had a distinct end-of-season feel to it. The draw takes PSG's all-time record points tally to 93, some 28 ahead of Lyon in second, but they were some way short of their irresistible best in the absence of the likes of Blaise Matuidi, Javier Pastore, Marco Verratti and Edinson Cavani. Paris should have been in front late in the first half but Lucas Moura somehow contrived to miss with just the goalkeeper to beat. Alone six yards out, the Brazilian only needed to help an Ibrahimovic shot into the net but instead barely made contact with the ball, allowing Jerome Prior to save. At the other end, Kevin Trapp saved well from Jaroslav Plasil and Diego Rolan in the first half, before Ibrahimovic struck on 59 minutes. Angel Di Maria crossed from the right and the Swede peeled away from Brazilian defender Pablo to head home. Named France's player of the year for the third time in four seasons at the weekend, Ibrahimovic now has 46 goals in all competitions for the campaign. His league tally leaves him just one away from equalling Argentine striker Carlos Bianchi's club record of 37 in a top-flight campaign, set back in 1978. Bordeaux were level just seven minutes later, though, as the giant Malian Cheick Diabate headed on a corner for Pallois to lash home at the back post. Shortly after that, Ibrahimovic came off with what looked like a minor calf knock, but he will hope to be fit in time for Saturday's final league game of the season against Nantes at the Parc des Princes."
47,01/04/2016,22:52,Bordeaux slow Monaco Champions League charge,Monaco's march towards Champions League qualification in Ligue 1 was slowed on Friday as they slumped to a 2-1 defeat at home to struggling Bordeaux at the Stade Louis II.,"Goals in each half from Thomas Toure and Adam Ounas were enough for the away side before a Frederic Guilbert own goal gave Monaco a late consolation in the principality. Monaco had looked certainties to finish second and secure automatic qualification for next season's Champions League thanks to an eight-game unbeaten run that included a 2-0 win away to champions Paris Saint-Germain in their last outing. However, this first home league defeat since September means third-placed Nice can close to within two points if they can win at PSG on Saturday, while fourth-placed Lyon will also hope to put the pressure on when they visit Lorient on Sunday. Bordeaux took the lead in stoppage time at the end of the first half when Fabinho inadvertently helped on a corner at the near post and the unmarked Toure lashed the ball into the roof of the net at the back post. An almost identical goal allowed Bordeaux to double their lead before the hour mark as a corner came all the way to the back post where Ounas was this time unmarked and stabbed past goalkeeper Danijel Subasic. Monaco had a chance to get one back in stoppage time when they were awarded a penalty for a Cedric Yambere foul on Guido Carrillo. Vagner Love stepped up to take it but saw his effort saved, and although he converted the follow-up, the goal was disallowed, apparently for encroachment into the area by one of his team-mates. The hosts did get one back, though, with Jerome Prior saving a Carrillo header only for the ball to rebound in off Guilbert. Nevertheless, Bordeaux were not to be denied a first win in six games and a third victory against Monaco this season that allows Ulrich Rame's team to move nine points clear of the relegation zone."
48,14/03/2016,19:37,Bordeaux dismiss ex-France defender Sagnol,"Bordeaux dismissed former France defender Willy Sagnol as coach of the Ligue 1 side on Monday, just two days after suffering a heavy 4-0 defeat at struggling Toulouse.","Sagnol, who took over at the start of last season, will be replaced by long-time former Bordeaux goalkeeper Ulrich Rame. Bordeaux have won just one of their past seven league games and are 14th in the table, just five points above the relegation zone. Sagnol's departure is the 10th coaching change in the French top flight this season, equalling the record from the 2004-05 campaign."
49,10/03/2016,17:57,Bordeaux coach Sagnol handed three-game ban,"Bordeaux coach Willy Sagnol has been given a three-match ban from the touchline and all game-day functions for his behaviour during a recent cup tie, the Ligue 1 club announced on Thursday.","Former France international full-back Sagnol was punished following an incident during Bordeaux's French Cup defeat to Nantes last month and will begin his suspension at Saturday's league match at Toulouse. In his second season in charge of Bordeaux, Sagnol is under pressure with his side languishing in the bottom half of the Ligue 1 table and leaking goals at an alarming rate in recent weeks."
50,19/02/2016,23:31,Nice maintain European push with Bordeaux stalemate,Nice underlined their European aspirations with a goalless draw at Bordeaux on Friday which consolidated their third place in Ligue 1.,"The Riviera side, 6-1 winners at home against Bordeaux last September, quickly doused any hopes of revenge Willy Sagnol's side might have had. Lacking inspiration in front of goal, it was a disappointing result for Bordeaux who missed the chance to move to within one point of Nice. Nice have 41 points from 27 games, 29 points behind leaders Paris Saint-Germain who host struggling Reims on Saturday, with Bordeaux sitting ninth, four points behind their visitors. ""You have to admit that Nice are a great team who aren't on the foot of the podium (third) for nothing and who will be in the reckoning until the end of the season,"" said Sagnol. Without top scorer Hatem Ben Arfa, Claude Puel's side had few early opportunities apart from a header on seven minutes by defender Paul Baysse following a freekick by Ivorian Jean Michael Seri. But Nice goalkeeper Yoan Cardinale was made to work over the next half hour with a wave of pressure from the hosts lead by Argentine midfielder Valentin Vada. Mali forward Cheick Diabate, so prolific in January, missed two chances either side of the break, with Bordeaux's Ivorian striker Thomas Toure having no more success. Bordeaux's France international fullback Mathieu Debuchy, on loan from Arsenal, was forced off after 82 minutes with a hamstring injury. ""It doesn't seem serious but we'll need 48 hours to give a more precise diagnosis,"" said Sagnol with the player set to play with France in two pre-Euro 2016 friendlies against the Netherlands and Russia next month."
51,01/02/2016,21:55,Bordeaux sign Debuchy on loan from Arsenal,"Right-back Mathieu Debuchy has joined Bordeaux on a six-month loan deal from Arsenal, the Ligue 1 side said on Monday.","The 30-year-old France international defender has only started 12 Premier League matches since joining the Gunners from Newcastle United 18-months ago, having also spent 10 years and played 301 games at Lille. ""It's hard to imagine it. Bordeaux signing a France international from the Premier League,"" Bordeaux president Jean-louis Triaud said after the signing. Debuchy was part of the Euro 2012 and World Cup 2014 squads for France, for whom he last played in September 2015 in a 2-1 win over Serbia, at Bordeaux's magnificent brand new stadium, built for the 2016 Euro."

Khazri moved to Bordeaux in 2014 after six years with Bastia. Capped 22 times the Tunisian has scored 14 goals in Ligue 1 with 11 assists. Relegation-threatened Sunderland have already been active in Ligue 1, Sam Allardyce's side signing Ivory Coast defender Lamine Kone from Lorient on Wednesday."
53,26/01/2016,23:11,Lille punish Bordeaux to make first League Cup final,Lille eased past an error-strewn Bordeaux 5-1 on Tuesday to secure their first ever appearance in a French League Cup final.,"Their opponents in the April 23 final at the Stade de France will be the winner of Wednesday's semi-final between Paris Saint-Germain and Toulouse. Three-time winners Bordeaux were the form side going into the last four tie at Lille's Stade Pierre-Mauroy. Willy Sagnol's team arrived unbeaten in 11 matches in all competitions after a late show rescued an unlikely point against Nantes at the weekend. In contrast Lille had seen their recent resurgence under new coach Frederic Antonetti stutter. They were dumped out of the French Cup by fourth-tier Trelissac and suffered the ignominy of becoming the first team to lose to Troyes in the league this term. But it was Lille who raced into a seventh minute lead when after good work by Florent Balmont on the left Djibril Sidibe crossed to Yassine Benzia who capitalised on a collision between Diego Contento and goalkeeper Jerome Prior to score from six yards. On 23 minutes, Lille had the ball in the back of the net again only for Sidibe's effort to be ruled offside. Bordeaux drew back level ten minutes later after Lille defender Bakary Soumaoro lost possession, with Clement Chantome arriving quickly on the scene to fire between the legs of Vincent Enyeama. Bordeaux were without injured first choice keeper goalkeeper Cedric Carrasso, but back-up stopper Prior performed wonders to deny Rony Lopes's left-footed shot on 36 minutes. Lille, who had fallen at this stage in 2013 to Saint-Etienne and last season to PSG, wrapped up the tie as half-time approached. First Bordeaux defender Ludovic Lamine Sane inadvertently put them back in front when he lobbed helpless Prior shortly after replacing Andre Biyogo Poko. Then Soumoaro connected with Renato Civelli's header following a free kick to send Lille heading for the final. Eric Bautheac added the fourth near the hour mark with Soufiane Boufal putting the finishing touches to a memorable night for the hosts in the third minute of injury time. On Wednesday, PSG continue their quest for a domestic treble when they meet Toulouse for the third time in just eleven days. Having already knocked Dominique Arribage's men out of the French Cup and beaten them in the league in the last fortnight, PSG will be looking to complete a quick-fire hat-trick of wins in their League Cup semi-final at the Parc des Princes. Laurent Blanc's side are going for a third successive League Cup success and with the league title all but sealed already, they can afford to focus on the three cup competitions."
54,18/01/2016,19:00,Bordeaux fans banned from Nantes trip,"Bordeaux supporters have been banned from Saturday's trip to Nantes in Ligue 1 because of the risk of violence, government officials in the Loire-Atlantique region announced on Monday.","""The sale and purchase of tickets is prohibited for any Bordeaux supporters and from 0800 to midnight, it will be forbidden from anyone claiming to be a Bordeaux fan to enter the stadium,"" read an official statement. The decision, taken a day after Sunday's Rhone-Alpes derby between Saint-Etienne and Lyon for which travelling fans were also unable to attend, comes with France still under a state of emergency following the Paris terror attacks on November 13. Nantes fans were ordered to stay away from the Nouveau Stade de Bordeaux in the first meeting between the sides in August, following trouble between the rival sets of supporters in 2014."
55,11/01/2016,16:04,Newcastle swoop for Bordeaux's Saivet,"Newcastle have signed Senegal midfielder Henri Saivet from French club Bordeaux, the Premier League strugglers confirmed on Monday.","Saivet has moved to St James' Park for a reported fee of around £5 million ($7.2 million, 6.6 million euros). The 25-year-old, who was Bordeaux's captain, agreed a five-and-a-half-year contract and is Newcastle's first signing of the January transfer window. ""I am very happy to be here at Newcastle. I am really proud to be able to play for this club, and I am really excited at the challenge that lies ahead,"" Saivet told Newcastle's website. ""St James' Park is a really impressive and special stadium. In France, there is nothing that compares to this, and I can't wait to get out there with my new team-mates and help the team climb the table."" Saivet joins a Newcastle team in the midst of a relegation battle, with Steve McClaren's side 18th place in the Premier League having lost their last four games in all competitions 1-0. ""Henri is someone the club has been watching for a while, and he has developed into an excellent player at Bordeaux,"" McClaren said. ""This is someone with a very good mentality, who is a tough player and a winner. Those are key qualities you need in the Premier League and we are looking forward to seeing him pulling on the Newcastle United shirt."" Saivet came through the ranks at Bordeaux, making his senior debut at the age of 17 and going on to score 23 goals in 178 appearances."

Bordeaux captain Henri Saivet headed in a third two minutes from time to seal just a second win for Willy Sagnol's men in their last eight matches. Bordeaux won the last of their League Cup titles in 2009 under then-coach Laurent Blanc and also went on to claim the Ligue 1 crown that same season. Later on Wednesday, holders and record five-time winners Paris Saint-Germain start their defence against 2013 winners Saint-Etienne at the Parc des Princes. Lyon will bid farewell to the Stade de Gerland when they host second-division Tours ahead of moving into their new 59,000-capacity stadium in January, while Marseille visit Bourg en Bresse."
57,26/11/2015,23:22,Liverpool into last-32 as Celtic crash,Liverpool reached the Europa League last 32 on Thursday while Scottish interest in continental competition came to another sobering end when Celtic were knocked out.,"Jurgen Klopp's Liverpool defeated Bordeaux 2-1 at Anfield having endured the worst possible start when injury-plagued England striker Daniel Sturridge's comeback from a knee injury stalled when he hurt his foot in the warm-up. The English side then fell a goal down in the Group B clash in bizarre fashion after 33 minutes when goalkeeper Simon Mignolet was penalised for time-wasting. Henri Saivet buried the free-kick but Liverpool were level just five minutes later when James Milner scored from the penalty spot after Ludovic Sane fouled Christian Benteke. Belgian star Benteke then hit what proved to be the winner in first-half injury time with a rasping right-footed drive. Scottish champions Celtic slumped to a 10th consecutive Europa League game without a win - a 2-1 loss at home to Ajax in Group A. Callum McGregor had given Celtic a fourth-minute lead at Parkhead but Arkadiusz Milik levelled in the 21st minute for the Dutch side. Ajax substitute Vaclav Cerny scored the late winner just two minutes from time to keep his team's qualification hopes alive while Celtic's fate was sealed when Fenerbahce defeated already-qualified Molde 2-0. Elsewhere, Russian side Krasnodar ran out 1-0 winners over already-qualified Borussia Dortmund to go through from Group C. Also through were Spaniards Villarreal courtesy of Viktoria Plzen's 1-0 loss to Minsk. Swiss champions Basel drew 2-2 with 10-man Fiorentina to go through from Group I while Sporting Lisbon boosted their prospects of escaping from Group H with a 4-2 win at Lokomotiv Moscow. Lazio continued their Europa League campaign with 3-1 win over Dniepropetrovsk while Sporting Braga went through from Group F thanks to a last-minute winner in a 2-1 home win against Slovan Liberec."
58,07/10/2015,12:31,Goalkeeper Dropsy dead at 63,"Former France international goalkeeper Dominique Dropsy has died from leukaemia at the age of 63, his former club Bordeaux announced on Wednesday.","Capped 17 times for his country between 1978 and 1981, Dropsy also won three French league titles (two with Bordeaux and one with Strasbourg) and two French Cups (both with Bordeaux.) He was diagnosed with having leukaemia in March 2011. Dropsy began his career at Valenciennes in northeast France in 1970 and was called up by the France youth team in 1972. He then transferred to Strasbourg following Robert Domerque, who had been his coach at Valenciennes, and was part of the league-winning side in 1979. Dropsy then moved to Bordeaux in 1984 and went on to win French league titles in 1985 and 1987 before calling a halt to his career in 1990. When he retired he had played 596 first division games - a record at that time subsequently beaten by Jean-Luc Ettori (602) and Mickael Landreau (618). For France, Dropsy played one game in the 1978 World Cup finals in Argentina - a 3-1 win over Hungary when the French had already been eliminated."
59,23/09/2015,21:50,Ben Arfa at double as Nice hit Bordeaux for six,"Hatem Ben Arfa inspired Nice to a come-from-behind 6-1 victory over Bordeaux on Wednesday, scoring twice in a performance that should help bury his recent tussles with footballing red tape.","Jaroslav Plasil had finished off a neat Bordeaux build-up on six minutes as the visitors looked firmly on top, but Nice soon pulled ahead thanks to Ben Arfa's industry and imagination. Goals from Valere Germain and then Mikael Le Bihan, who tapped in a rebound from a long range shot from Ben Arfa, had Nice 2-1 ahead at half-time. From the restart things got even worse for Bordeaux with a red card for Enzo Crivelli after 50 minutes and then an own-goal by Nicolas Pallois a minute later. Ben Arfa then crowned a magnificent personal performance with a brace of goals on 68 and 74 minutes, one a tap in after a lightning breakaway, the other a flashing shot after a mazy run. Alexandre Mendy added the sixth in the 84th minute. Ben Arfa had been set to join Nice during the last winter break but was caught up in an administrative mix-up before FIFA and the French football governing body stepped in to block the transfer. He had played a game with Newcastle's reserves during the summer of 2014 before being loaned out to Hull City, meaning he was prevented from joining Nice due to a rule that a player can only play for two clubs in a single season. Earlier this week, he lost his appeal against the ruling and where he had been trying to recover the earnings he lost during the time he was sidelined. Saint Etienne needed an own goal in a 1-0 win against plucky newcomers Troyes, which came when Thomas Ayase tried to keep track with the onrushing striker Romain Hamouma only to turn the ball into his own goal. Christophe Galtier's team came fifth last season but are now sitting pretty in second, just a point behind Paris Saint Germain who beat Guingamp 1-0 on Tuesday. Elsewhere, Lyon beat Bastia 2-0, Lorient beat Caen by the same score and tiny Gazalec Ajaccio of Corsica got their first home points in Ligue 1 with a 1-1 draw with Rennes."
60,20/09/2015,16:29,Bordeaux leave it late to force draw against Toulouse,Enzo Crivelli scored a minute from time to salvage a 1-1 draw for Bordeaux against ten-man Toulouse in Ligue 1 on Sunday.,"Willy Sagnol's men, who drew against Liverpool 1-1 in the Europa League on Thursday, were heading towards defeat before 20-year-old substitute striker Crivelli bundled the ball home with his chest as time was running out. Moroccan midfielder Adrien Regattin smashed home the opening goal for the visitors in the 23rd minute but the straight red card shown to Oscar Trejo with 13 minutes left hampered their chances of holding on for maximum points. The draw lifts Bordeaux up to 11th in the table while Toulouse are fifth from bottom and three points above the relegation zone. Playing later on Sunday, Monaco host Lorient at the Louis II stadium while Saint-Etienne are at home to Nantes and Lyon travel to the Velodrome where Mathieu Valbuena returns to his old club to face Marseille. On Saturday, Edinson Cavani kept Paris Saint-Germain's unbeaten start to the season intact as he equalised late on at Reims in a 1-1 draw. Brittany side Rennes are their closest challengers and one point back after coming from behind to draw 1-1 at home to Lille on Friday evening. Surprise package Caen are third and two points back after defeating 2012 champions Montpellier 2-1, Reims are fourth and promoted Angers complete the top five, just behind on goal difference after edging Troyes 1-0."
61,11/09/2015,22:43,Trapp nightmare as PSG held by Bordeaux,Paris Saint-Germain goalkeeper Kevin Trapp endured a nightmare evening as the reigning French champions saw their perfect start to the season ended in a 2-2 draw with 10-man Bordeaux on Friday.,"PSG had looked set to make it five straight Ligue 1 wins to start the campaign thanks to an Edinson Cavani first-half brace either side of Henri Saivet's equaliser. However, German goalkeeper Trapp, who had already been at fault at the first goal, was caught in possession in the box by Wahbi Khazri with 11 minutes left, allowing the Bordeaux player to snatch a point for his side. It was a sweet result for the visitors, who had been forced to take the metro earlier in the day when their bus broke down and were reduced to 10 men shortly before their second goal when skipper Saivet was sent off. And the result denied PSG what would have been a record-equalling 14th successive win in France's top flight. Ironically, that record is still held by the 2009 Bordeaux side coached by current Paris boss Laurent Blanc, and Les Girondins were the last team to take anything from the capital club in the league back in March. That day, their 3-2 victory in south-western France was overshadowed by an extraordinary rant by Zlatan Ibrahimovic at the match officials. And Bordeaux's performance here was overshadowed by the disastrous display by Trapp, who had previously not conceded a goal since signing in the summer from Eintracht Frankfurt to usurp Salvatore Sirigu. ""He is a goalkeeper who takes lots of risks. I ask him to take risks. I hope next time things will turn out better for him, but he won't change his way of playing,"" said Blanc. ""That's football. We could have played the same game and won, but it wouldn't change my analysis. We were not good enough in lots of areas."" Bordeaux coach Willy Sagnol added: ""The players showed great spirit and never gave up but both goalkeepers gave out gifts today. It was German goodwill (from Trapp) to help with his adaptation in France."" Ibrahimovic was not involved here, the Swede resting after suffering an abdominal injury on international duty and eager to return against his old club Malmo in the Champions League next Tuesday. However, Angel di Maria made his first PSG start, lining up on the right of a front three also featuring Cavani and Lucas. Di Maria was lively, constantly weaving his way into central positions from the right flank, but it was Cavani who opened the scoring just past the midway point in the first period after a moment Bordeaux goalkeeper Cedric Carrasso will want to forget. When he fumbled a harmless ball inside the area, Cavani pounced, controlling and volleying high into the net. The former Marseille shot-stopper was taunted by the PSG fans, but Bordeaux were back level on the half-hour mark courtesy of more suspect goalkeeping, this time from Trapp. Khazri's left-wing corner was helped on by Saivet at the near post, but it was Trapp who got the decisive final touch, fumbling the ball over the line when he really should have saved. Nevertheless, the match quickly swung back the home side's way, and Cavani restored their lead on 34 minutes, his 25-yard free-kick not right in the corner but leaving Carrasso rooted to the spot regardless. Carrasso then redeemed himself for his earlier error with a crucial save to deny Di Maria a first goal in French football just before the interval after Nicolas Pallois had been caught in possession by Lucas. And Trapp then made up for his mistake at the equaliser by getting a vital touch to a net-bound Enzo Crivelli header and taking the ball away from debutant Brazilian defender Pablo, who was arriving at the back post. Bordeaux's hopes appeared to have gone when Saivet was sent off for a second yellow card shown for a foul on Marco Verratti 13 minutes from the end. But almost immediately the visitors were level, Khazri charging down Trapp and stealing the ball off the German's toe to stab into an empty net."

It was German goodwill (from Trapp) to help with his adaptation in France."" Ibrahimovic was not involved here, the Swede resting after suffering an abdominal injury on international duty and eager to return against his old club Malmo in the Champions League next Tuesday. However, Angel di Maria made his first PSG start, lining up on the right of a front three also featuring Cavani and Lucas. Di Maria was lively, constantly weaving his way into central positions from the right flank, but it was Cavani who opened the scoring just past the midway point in the first period after a moment Bordeaux goalkeeper Cedric Carrasso will want to forget. When he fumbled a harmless ball inside the area, Cavani pounced, controlling and volleying high into the net. The former Marseille shot-stopper was taunted by the PSG fans, but Bordeaux were back level on the half-hour mark courtesy of more suspect goalkeeping, this time from Trapp. Khazri's left-wing corner was helped on by Saivet at the near post, but it was Trapp who got the decisive final touch, fumbling the ball over the line when he really should have saved. Nevertheless, the match quickly swung back the home side's way, and Cavani restored their lead on 34 minutes, his 25-yard free-kick not right in the corner but leaving Carrasso rooted to the spot regardless. Carrasso then redeemed himself for his earlier error with a crucial save to deny Di Maria a first goal in French football just before the interval after Nicolas Pallois had been caught in possession by Lucas. And Trapp then made up for his mistake at the equaliser by getting a vital touch to a net-bound Enzo Crivelli header and taking the ball away from debutant Brazilian defender Pablo, who was arriving at the back post. Bordeaux's hopes appeared to have gone when Saivet was sent off for a second yellow card shown for a foul on Marco Verratti 13 minutes from the end. But almost immediately the visitors were level, Khazri charging down Trapp and stealing the ball off the German's toe to stab into an empty net."
63,15/08/2015,19:05,Bordeaux strike late to deny Saint-Etienne,A stoppage-time free-kick by stand-in captain Henri Saivet gave Bordeaux a 1-1 draw with Saint-Etienne at the Stade Geoffroy-Guichard in the early Ligue 1 game on Saturday.,"Beaten 2-1 at Toulouse in their opening league match last weekend, Saint-Etienne looked set for all three points when Fabien Lemoine set up Romain Hamouma for a low finish across stand-in Bordeaux goalkeeper Jerome Prior and in on 58 minutes. However, they had taken the lead in Toulouse before conceding twice from direct free-kicks and it was a dead ball that did for Les Verts again this time. The match was in stoppage time when the visitors won a free-kick in a central position 20 yards out, and the wall opened up to let Senegal international Saivet's low shot through to ensure a share of the points. Later on Saturday, last season's runners-up Lyon go to Guingamp with Mathieu Valbuena set to make his debut after the France international playmaker signed from Dynamo Moscow in midweek. The pick of the other matches sees promoted Angers, top of the table after the opening weekend, entertain derby rivals Nantes. On Sunday, Marseille go to Reims in their first game since the shock resignation of coach Marcelo Bielsa, while champions Paris Saint-Germain are at home to newly-promoted Corsican minnows Gazelec Ajaccio. On Friday, Monaco warmed up for their Champions League play-off first leg against Valencia by drawing 0-0 at home to Lille."
64,09/08/2015,19:24,"Saint-Etienne, Bordeaux lose as Bielsa fallout continues",Bordeaux and Saint-Etienne both suffered Ligue 1 opening day defeats on Sunday as French football was still suffering the shockwaves of Marcelo Bielsa's resignation as Marseille coach.,"At the Nouveau Stade de Bordeaux, Willy Sagnol's men were 10 minutes from victory before Nicolas De Preville cancelled out Wahbi Khazri's 41st minute opener and Theoson Jordan Siebatcheu grabbed a dramatic 88th minute winner for Reims. At Toulouse, Loic Perrin gave Saint-Etienne a 17th minute lead before the home side turned matters around. Martin Braithwaite levelled the match 10 minutes after Perrin's opener before star striker Wissam Ben Yedder put away the winner, eight minutes into the second half. Toulouse finished the match with 10 men when Aleksandar Pesic was shown a straight red card with four minutes left. Meanwhile, Bielsa's shock exit at Marseille after Saturday's opening 1-0 defeat at home to Caen sparked a bitter war of words between the Argentine and his former employers. Former European champions Marseille accused the Argentine of trying to hold them hostage over his new contract. A strongly-worded club statement claimed: ""Marseille possess a sufficiently rich history to refuse to surrender to the rule of one man"". The French giants insisted they wouldn't be ""held prisoner by a man who places his personal interests high above those of the club"". The attack on the man known as 'El Loco' (the mad man) came less than 24 hours after he had delivered what captain Steve Mandanda described as his ""hammer blow"". Bielsa blamed last minute changes to his contract for the decision which left Marseille president Vincent Labrune dumbfounded. ""I am, like all the supporters, dazed by Marcelo Bielsa's shock decision,"" Labrune declared in a statement. ""However, we take note of this decision which places the club in a difficult place having started the new season with a home defeat."" He confirmed that one of Bielsa's assistants, Franck Passi, would step up as caretaker coach pending a permanent replacement. The club and owner Margarita Louis-Dreyfus assured fans they would ""take all necessary measures in the coming days to enable Marseille to enjoy a season to the height of its expectations"". Bielsa, who had been in charge since May 2014, wrote in his resignation letter: ""I am sad and frustrated. ""I cannot accept the situation of instability at the club. ""We had reached an agreement on a contract extension for 2016-2017, which was missing just a signature."" Bielsa said he had met Wednesday with the club's chief executive Philippe Perez and Igor Levin, Louis-Dreyfus's lawyer. ""They wanted to change the contract,"" he complained. ""I took this final decision as working together requires a minimum of trust, which we do not have."" Bielsa, who guided Chile to the last 16 at the 2010 World Cup, was at pains to point out his abrupt exit had nothing to do with money, revealing he had turned down a new deal multiplying his salary threefold. And he said he'd been patient with the club, despite uncertainty in the way they had conducted themselves in the close-season transfer market. Champions Paris Saint-Germain opened the Ligue 1 season on Friday with a hard fought 1-0 win at Lille."
65,19/04/2015,16:10,Lille keep European hopes alive with Bordeaux win,Nolan Roux was on target as Lille grabbed their third consecutive Ligue 1 victory with a 2-0 win over Bordeaux on Sunday to close on European places.,"The 27-year-old forward headed in his fifth goal of the season, benefiting from an incisive run by Sofiane Boufal and a defensive mistake by Mariano after just 13 minutes of play. Boufal was once again key in the dying minutes of the game, the young midfielder picking off Bordeaux on the break and playing in Adama Traore to calmly slot home. It was Bordeaux's second league defeat since January 16, a 12-game run that includes triumphs over PSG and Marseille. In-form Lille leapfrog Montpellier into seventh place, just four points behind Bordeaux and six behind Saint-Etienne, who currently occupy the fifth and final European football spot on offer to French clubs. On Saturday, Paris Saint-Germain bounced back from their Champions League humbling against Barcelona by beating Nice 3-1 in their bid for a hat-trick of Ligue 1 titles. PSG temporarily moved a point ahead Lyon at the top of the table ahead of Sunday's derby against Saint-Etienne. Monaco remain in third place as they refocus on overturning a 1-0 first-leg deficit at home to Juventus in the second leg of their Champions League quarter-final in midweek. But crucially, they failed to fully exploit fourth-placed Marseille's continued slump as Marcelo Bielsa's side went down to a 1-0 defeat at Nantes on Friday night."
66,12/04/2015,23:45,Marseille title hopes dented by Bordeaux,Marseille missed the chance to close to within two points of Paris Saint-Germain at the top of Ligue 1 after slipping up 1-0 at Bordeaux in Sunday's late game.,"Defender Cedric Yambere's 61st-minute goal, less than a minute after coming off the bench, sank Marseille, now fourth, and dealt their title hopes a massive blow. In a game dominated by the visitors, Michy Batshuayi had the ball in the back of the Bordeaux net with 15 minutes left but the young Belgium forward's effort was correctly flagged for offside. Marseille have not triumphed at the Stade Chaban-Delmas since 1977 and have picked up just four victories in 51 attempts against Les Girondins in the top flight. With six games to go, the south coast side find themselves five points behind leaders PSG and four adrift of second-placed Lyon, with both teams having a game in hand. ""We're in an uncomfortable situation,"" said Marseille coach Marcelon Bielsa. ""But we retain the strength to change that and we hope that our league table position will be what we deserve. We will fight for every point. ""Obviously we did not expect this slip-up and I don't think we deserve to be out of the top three now."" Bordeaux now sit on sixth and are in contention to qualify for the Europa League with their fourth win in the past five games. Earlier Sunday, there was a hint of nostalgia in Ligue 1 as Saint-Etienne beat Nantes 1-0, the two clubs having won 15 league titles between them in a 20-year stretch up to the early 1980's. On an afternoon of glorious sunshine, thousands of fans went bare-chested in the stands at a packed and boisterous Geoffroy-Guichard stadium, where Franck Tabanou's thunderbolt free kick on 18 minutes was enough to give three precious points to Europe-chasing Saint-Etienne. Between 1964 and 1983, the two clubs won 15 titles between them, nine going to Saint Etienne (Marseille and Monaco got two each and Strasbourg the other), as they dominated the French scene. Saint-Etienne are currently fifth and eyeing Europa League qualification, but to avoid disruptive early qualifying rounds in August they are targeting a fourth-place finish, which they also managed last season. Sunday's win also helped them get over the disappointment of Wednesday's 4-1 defeat to PSG in the French Cup semi-finals. Nantes, for their part, have re-established themselves as a mid-table side after promotion two seasons ago, their last French title coming in 2001. Monaco beat Caen on Friday to climb up to third on 58 points, holding onto the third and final Champions League qualifying spot. French football is on something of a high right now with Paris hosting Barcelona on Wednesday in a glamour Champions League quarter-final first-leg after a 'generational' victory over Chelsea in the last-16. Meanwhile, Monaco are also in the last eight and travel to Italian giants Juventus on Tuesday in confident mood having won their last four away games in Ligue 1 and beating Arsenal in the last round. PSG's defence of their League Cup title on Saturday, which featured doubles from Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Edinson Cavani, means their League game with Metz, originally scheduled for this weekend, will now be played on April 28th, while Lyon's game with Bastia will be played this Wednesday. Elsewhere on Sunday the 19-year-old rookie striker Said Benrahma's 4th minute strike was enough to give Nice a 1-0 at Reims, while Lille grabbed a 1-0 win at Evian after a generously awarded penalty, converted by Sofiane Boufal. Relegation-threatened Toulouse won 1-0 at home over Montpellier, bottom side Lens slugged out a 0-0 draw with Lorient while in the Brittany derby Rennes beat 10-man Guingamp 1-0."

When Mariano broke the deadlock going into the last 10 minutes, it looked like Lens would once again rue missed chances. But Pablo Chavarria fired Lens' hopes of Ligue 1 survival with a fine finish just three minutes from time. Maurice-Belay, however, came off the bench to grab the winner in injury time after pouncing on an Ahmed Kantari mistake. The defeat leaves Lens bottom, nine points from safety and one point behind Metz, who beat Toulouse 3-2 on Saturday to record their first victory since November thanks to a Modibo Maiga hat-trick. Elsewhere on Sunday, Caen moved six points clear of the relegation zone after coming from behind to win 2-1 at Nantes. Alejandro Bedoya put the Canaries ahead early on but Emiliano Sala levelled with a penalty 10 minutes from time and a Thomas Lemar free-kick evaded everyone to end up in the net in stoppage time as the Normandy side claimed a first win in four. On Saturday, Lyon reclaimed top spot in Ligue 1 with a 3-1 win at 10-man Guingamp, putting the pressure on fellow challengers Paris Saint-Germain and Marseille before they meet on Sunday. Lyon, who won the last of their seven Ligue 1 titles in 2008, now have 61 points from 31 games, two ahead of champions Paris, with Marseille another two points back in third. The Parisians can strike a major blow in the title race by continuing their impressive recent record at the Stade Velodrome. Laurent Blanc's side have dominated the fixture known as 'Le Classique' in recent years, with their 2-0 win at the Parc des Princes in November their sixth in a row against Marseille."

Zlatan Ibrahimovic had equalised twice for Laurent Blanc's side, who remain in the hunt for four trophies, but Diego Rolan popped up in the 89th minute to steer the ball home when the central defence collapsed. Sweden's Ibrahimovic took exception to some of the decisions made by referee Lionel Jaffredo and cut a furious figure at the final whistle when he stormed down the tunnel. ""In 15 years, I have never seen such a referee. In this shit country, this country does not deserve PSG."" the striker blasted in English at the final whistle. Blanc meanwhile said his side had struggled for fitness and motivation after their efforts in West London. ""We did something special on Wednesday and everyone is talking about it which is normal but to play 10 against 11 for 90 minutes against a team like Chelsea leaves its mark,"" said the coach who led Bordeaux to the 2009 French title. ""It's always difficult to get back into league matches after the Champions League and today we didn't have the capacities to win, mainly because we were not fresh. ""We're used to playing teams who produce their best matches and have extra motivation. They would have watched our match on Wednesday and waited for today's match to try and beat a team who achieved something special which is normal."" It is only the third defeat of the season for PSG who remain one point behind leaders Lyon who are in action later on Sunday in the final match of the weekend at third-placed Marseille. Bordeaux took the lead during a first-half in which they controlled the tempo and went ahead from a corner on 18 minutes. Senegalese international Lamine Sane rose highest to meet a cross into the heart of the area and sent a glancing header past the despairing dive of PSG's Italian 'keeper Salvatore Sirigu. There was more concern for Blanc and his defending champions when star defender David Luiz pulled up lame clutching his hamstring and came off immediately just before half-time. Ibrahimovic then poached his 13th league goal of the season following a goalkeeping howler from Cedric Carasso five minutes after the break. The Sweden captain, who was shown a controversial straight red card against Chelsea, used his striking instincts to flick the ball past Carasso after the 'keeper and Portuguese defender Thiago Ilori made a botched job of clearing a bouncing ball in the box. Bordeaux then took the lead again when Wahbi Khazri found himself completely unmarked inside the area and was able to place his header past the helpless Sirigu with 20 minutes left. Ibrahimovic equalised again with a penalty with five minutes left as the match appeared heading for a draw but Rolan became Bordeaux's hero with his last-gasp winner. Earlier on Sunday, Belgian teenager Divock Origi, who hadn't scored for six months, helped himself to a hat-trick in Lille's 3-0 mauling of Rennes. The win lifts Rene Girard's side up to eighth place while Rennes slip into the lower half of the table. On Saturday, Saint-Etienne kept up their bid for European football next season and added to relegation fears for Metz with a 3-2 victory in northeastern France. At Lens, the 1998 French champions gave themselves a glimmer of hope of staying in Ligue 1 with a vital 1-0 home win over Toulouse. Brittany club Lorient also picked up three crucial points to move five points above Toulouse and the final relegation spot with a 2-1 win over Caen. Finally, Montpellier climbed back into European contention with a 3-1 home win over Reims."

He becomes Bordeaux's second signing during the winter break, following the arrival of Swedish international striker Issac Kiese Thelin from Malmo, and could make his debut at home to Guingamp on Sunday. Chantome joined PSG as a teenager in 2000 and came up through the ranks to make 162 first team appearances, scoring five goals. He spent last season on loan at Toulouse scoring twice in 23 appearances. Bordeaux confirmed a six-month loan deal with Caen on Thursday when they off-loaded Argentine striker Emiliano Sala to the Normandy club."

Bordeaux are looking for a striker to plug the considerable gap left by the loss of giant Malian Cheick Diabate, the club's leading scorer who requires knee surgery and will be out for four months. Arsenal would reportedly prefer that Sanogo is loaned to a club in England but the player himself may be keen on joining Bordeaux having worked under Sagnol with the France under-21 side. Sanogo started his career at Auxerre in the second tier in France before moving to Arsenal in the summer of 2013. However, he has yet to score in 11 Premier League appearances and has one goal in four Champions League matches, against Borussia Dortmund earlier this season."
73,13/12/2014,22:56,"Lucky Nantes down Bordeaux, Bastia beat Rennes","A freak own goal helped Nantes to a 2-1 win over Bordeaux, struggling Bastia beat Rennes and a brace from Brazilian Diego Rigonato helped Reims past Evian in Ligue 1 action on Saturday.","Nantes ended their three-match losing run thanks to Jordan Veretout's opener, cancelled out by Kian Hansen's own goal. In the 66th minute Bordeaux's young Slovenian reserve keeper Azbe Jug haplessly scored the decider when the ball, rebounding off a post, struck him on the head and ended up in his own net. Nantes remain seventh with Bordeaux in fifth, on 31 points, one behind Saint-Etienne who face Nice on Sunday. Also on Sunday Paris Saint-Germain are at lowly Guingamp and leaders Marseille are at south coast rivals Monaco. Sixth-placed Rennes were thwarted 2-0 at Bastia, playing much of the game a man down after Fallou Diagne's 26th minute red card. A first half stoppage time goal from Ryad Boudebouz and Yannick Cahuzac's effort nine minutes from time earned Bastia a precious fourth win of the season. They climbed one place into third from bottom, on 17 points, one behind Guingamp. Reims' Brazilian midfielder Rigonato scored either side of the break in Reims' pulsating defeat of Evian, while on a high-scoring day in the French top flight Lens came from behind to salvage a 3-3 draw at Montpellier. On Friday, Ligue 1's leading scorer Alexandre Lacazette grabbed a brace as Lyon beat bottom club Caen 3-0 to make it eight consecutive home wins."

Gignac's clinical strike was his 11th goal of the season and lifts him joint top of the scoring charts with Lyon's Alexandre Lacazette. Michy Batshuayi wrapped up the scoring in the final minute after Mario Lamina had cancelled out Thomas Toure's opener for Bordeaux. ""It was a tough match right to the end but it's a positive result for us and a great evening,"" said Marseille's French international Dimitri Payet who set up the equaliser. ""I was able to recover and get some rest during the international break which helped me to work on other aspects of my game. I'm just happy my work has paid off."" The game took a turn for the worse for the home side when Marseille defender Benjamin Mendy was left with egg on his face in the 55th minute as his defensive howler led to Bordeaux's goal. The 20-year-old defender tried to dribble his way out of trouble before playing the ball straight to the feet of Bordeaux's Nicolas Maurice-Belay who was in perfect position to attack. The former Monaco winger raced at the outnumbered Marseille defence before laying the ball to the wide open Toure who had the simple task of placing the ball past Steve Mandanda. The lead was short-lived as a fine cross five minutes later from Payet on the right flank was met by Lamina and his firm header left Bordeaux 'keeper Cedric Carrasso rooted to his line. It was the 21-year-old Gabonese-born midfielder's first goal in Ligue 1. Then came Gignac's moment of magic and his first goal in three games to ignite the victory. Earlier this week, Gignac inadvertently found himself at the centre of controversy when it was revealed his transfer from Toulouse to Marseille in 2010 was being investigated as part of a fraud probe. Around 15 club officials, including president Vincent Labrune and two former presidents, were arrested. Sources close to the investigation said gangland figures were suspected of receiving commission from several major transfers, including that of Gignac and Senegalese international Souleymane Diawara. In the weekend curtain raiser on Friday, champions PSG defeated Metz 3-2 as star forward Zlatan Ibrahimovic made his first start in two months and temporarily lifted the champions top of the league for the first time this season. Argentines Javier Pastore and Ezequiel Lavezzi scored either side of a Gaetan Bussman own goal for the visitors, who remain unbeaten this season. A pair of Modibo Maiga penalties had briefly brought Metz level early in the second half after turning around 2-0 down at the break, but they couldn't hold out. In earlier matches on Sunday, fifth-placed Nantes maintained their one point advantage in the standings over Saint-Etienne as the two teams battled to a 0-0 stalemate at La Beaujoire stadium in Brittany. The Canaries had chances to snatch maximum points, notably from set-pieces, but French international 'keeper Stephane Ruffier denied efforts from Olivier Veigneau, Etay Schecter and Georges-Kevin Nkoudo to preserve his clean sheet. Elsewhere, 2012 champions Montpellier eased four points above the relegation zone with a 2-0 victory over Toulouse. Former Lyon and Nice midfielder Anthony Mounier was quickest to pounce on a loose ball in the box after 37 minutes and beat Ali Ahamada in the away goal and put Montpellier 1-0 in front. Senegal striker Souleymane Camara then made sure of the points with three minutes remaining with an angled shot that again Ahamada failed to keep out. On Saturday, Lyon extended their unbeaten Ligue 1 streak to ten matches with a hard-fought 0-0 draw at Bastia while Monaco failed to make up ground on the front-runners when they were held 2-2 at home by Caen."
75,08/11/2014,20:49,Jeers turn to tears as Sagnol's Bordeaux beat Lens,"In a week he faced claims of racism, Bordeaux coach Willy Sagnol was moved to tears in Ligue 1 on Saturday when African striker Cheick Diabate hugged him after sealing a 2-1 win at Lens.","The victory lifts Bordeaux to third position, level on 24 points with second-placed Paris Saint-Germain but trailing on goal difference, while PSG host Ligue 1 leaders Marseille on Sunday. Lens are fourth from bottom with three wins from 13 games. Sagnol had been forced to apologise this week after appearing to suggest African players may be lacking in ""discipline"" and ""intelligence"" in a newspaper interview. The former French international was also mercilessly whistled by home fans as he walked onto the Lens pitch. So when 26-year-old Malian striker Diabate scored Bordeaux's second goal just before half-time and ran over to hug Sagnol, the gesture left the coach wiping tears from his eyes. Wahbi Khazri opened Bordeaux's account with a powerful shot on 24 minutes before Diabate rounded the 'keeper to double the tally on 41 minutes. A Yoann Touzghar penalty gave Lens hope and brought the score back to 2-1 with 15 minutes to play, setting up a nervy closing spell. Diabate refused point blank to be drawn of the subject. ""I didn't see that (the crying). I'm just focussed on winning the game and getting the points,"" he told French television at half-time. Bordeaux 'keeper Cedric Carrasso said the coach had always had the support of the dressing room. ""The team believes in the coach and the team believes in the man. But he is only human and he can cry if he wants too,"" he said. Lens coach Antoine Kombouare, a Kanak from New Caledonia, shook Sagnol's hand before the game as fans at the Stade Felix-Bollaert subjected the Bordeaux coach to a barrage of jeers. ""We spoke on the phone and he heard me out and now the debate is closed. He must be suffering so we should all move on now,"" said Kombouare, who described himself as hurt and humiliated by what Sagnol had said earlier in the week. Sagnol himself also refused to go back over the racism debate or comment on the tears, only saying that the win had done him good after a hard week. He preferred instead to look ahead to the next match, a trip to Ligue 1 leaders Marseille. ""The players can now go away and concentrate on their international games and come back ready to turn in a performance at Marseille, where we will go to win,"" he said. Rennes, meanwhile, are comfortably settled in the top third of the table after edging lowly Lorient 1-0 in the Brittany derby on Friday evening. Later Saturday, Bastia start life without sacked coach Claude Makelele by hosting Montpellier, high-flying Nantes travel to Normandy outfit Caen, Evian host Nice and Toulouse take on Metz. The focus will be on Parc des Princes on Sunday where Paris Saint-Germain host arch-rivals Marseille, who are currently four points clear at the top of the table and will benefit from their extra rest this week as they are taking no part in European competition. On form Lyon will target a home victory over 16th-placed Guingamp also on Sunday as they too jostle for a position near the top of the table. Saint-Etienne face Monaco who were beaten 1-0 by Benfica in the Champions League in midweek. Lille will be looking to shake off a hangover from their 3-0 Europa League defeat at Everton when they face a potentially less complicated trip to Reims."
76,06/11/2014,20:46,Sagnol apologises for African player comments,"Bordeaux coach and former French international Willy Sagnol on Thursday apologised for his controversial comments about African players, saying he was sorry if some people were ""offended, humiliated or hurt"".","Sagnol had already insisted earlier in the week that his comments had been misinterpreted despite anti-racism campaigners calling for action to be taken against him. Sagnol, the former Monaco, Bayern Munich and France full-back, had indicated that African players lacked ""intelligence"" and ""discipline"" in an interview with the Bordeaux newspaper Sud-Ouest. He also declared that the scheduling of the Africa Cup of Nations puts him off signing players from the continent. But at a press conference on Thursday, he read a prepared statement ""to avoid any misinterpretation of my words"". ""If through my lack of clarity and my imperfect semantics, I caused people to be offended, humiliated or hurt, then I am sorry,"" said Sagnol. ""The interpretation made by some people does not reflect my own thoughts and especially my humanistic convictions."" He added that his comments were made in a ""sporting context and were neither political nor social"". ""When I spoke of Africans being cheap and ready to fight I just wanted to talk of the younger players who arrive in Europe with a desire to succeed and with the will to escape precarious situations. ""And when I talked of intelligence, I was talking of tactical intelligence obviously. In no way was I talking about intelligence in the usual sense of the term, that of individuals."" Sagnol also blasted critics who condemned his remarks as being racist. ""I am 37 years old. Thirty-two of those have been spent in football dressing rooms. I have never had a problem with this before,"" he added. For the players of Bordeaux, ""the subject is closed which indicates that there is no problem with them."""
77,04/11/2014,18:04,Bordeaux boss calls for fewer African players,"Bordeaux coach Willy Sagnol has courted controversy by labelling African players as ""cheap"" as he declared that the scheduling of the Africa Cup of Nations puts him off signing players from the continent.","Sagnol, the former Monaco, Bayern Munich and France full-back who took over as coach of Bordeaux in the summer, also indicated that African players lack ""intelligence"" and ""discipline"" in an interview with the Bordeaux newspaper Sud-Ouest. ""We deal with it one game at a time, but yes it's a problem,"" said Sagnol when asked how he would deal with losing players to Cup of Nations duty early in the new year. ""As long as I remain coach of Bordeaux there will be far fewer African players coming to Girondins de Bordeaux, because I don't fancy seeing 12 players clearing off for two months every two years."" Sagnol, a former France international who won 58 caps and was an integral part of the side that reached the 2006 World Cup final, then gave a rather blunt assessment of the qualities of the ""typical African player"". ""These are criteria to take into account when it comes to signing players,"" said the 37-year-old, who also won the 2001 Champions League trophy with German side Bayern Munich. ""The advantage of what I would call the typical African player is that they are cheap, ready to fight, always what you would call powerful on the pitch. ""But football is not just about that, it is about technique, intelligence, discipline, so you need everything. ""The Nordics as well, the Nordics are good. They have a good mentality. A football team is a mixture, it's like life, it's like France. You have defenders, attackers, midfielders, fast ones, big ones, small ones and technical ones."" Bordeaux have several African stars in their squad, including captain Lamine Sane of Senegal, Gabon midfielder Andre Biyogo Poko, Tunisia winger Wahbi Khazri and Mali duo Cheick Diabate and Abdou Traore. The Africa Cup of Nations, held every two years, is set to be held in Morocco between January 17 and February 8."
78,25/10/2014,22:47,Classy PSG make Bordeaux pay penalty,Two penalties by Lucas Moura and a clever chip by Ezequiel Lavezzi helped champions Paris Saint Germain beat Bordeaux 3-0 in Ligue 1 on Saturday and put pressure on leaders Marseille.,"Resurgent Marseille have 25 points ahead of their game on Sunday at Lyon, where they can clinch a club record 10th straight league win. PSG are second with 21 having played a game more. In later matches, eight-times former champions Nantes, back in the top flight since last year, climbed to third on 19 points after their 1-1 home draw with Reims. And last season's runners-up Monaco beat Bastia 3-1 away to climb to sixth on 17 points despite a long injury list. Bordeaux coach Willy Sagnol had promised to take the game to the champions and his outfit went into the game level on points with the Parisians. But with Brazilian international centre-back pair Thiago Silva and David Luiz holding firm, Paris always looked superior in that part of the pitch. With Edinson Cavani suspended and Zlatan Ibrahimovic injured, PSG coach Laurent Blanc started with a makeshift front three of Javier Pastore, Lucas and speedy youngster Jean-Christophe Bahebeck. Bordeaux had reason for early cheer on 27 minutes when Gregory van Der Wiel delivered a wild studs-up kick to Wahbi Khazri's heel with the ball gone and the referee right behind him. He was sent off, but the numerical advantage would last a mere ten minutes. Andre Poko's complete miss as he swung at a stray ball would have been comical if the Bordeaux midfielder hadn't ended up connecting with Marco Verratti's knee, and while he was unfortunate, he had to walk too. Sagnol was furious with the red card decision against Poko. ""If that was a red card then maybe (instead of playing football) we should dance or do figure skating. The referee had the red card out before Veratti even hit the deck,"" he complained. Blanc agreed with Sagnol suggesting neither foul had been worth a straight red. ""The sending off motivated the team, but I'd have liked to see 11 against 11. There is such a thing as a yellow card, and both players who were fouled were able to play on. This is a contact sport,"" he explained. With Bordeaux deflated PSG went on the offensive. From the ensuing free-kick Luiz was already turning to celebrate a goal but saw his thunderous shot come back off the post with the wall and 'keeper well beaten. PSG then spurned a series of chances before Verratti was brought down in the area as the pressure mounted. With Ibrahimovic and Cavani absent penalty duty fell to Lucas, who stepped up in his pink boots and sent Stephane Carrasso the wrong way, his spot-kick ripping into the opposite corner. Five minutes into the second-half Lucas himself was brought down as he beat the offside trap and PSG were awarded another penalty. The Brazilian coolly planted his second spot-kick in the other corner, Carrasso diving the right way but unable to deal with the venom of the shot. Lavezzi, who was returning after being out injured for a month, completed the scoring nine minutes from time when his close-range chip took a deflection off defender Maxime Poundje on its way into the net. Elsewhere Caen notched up their first home points after four straight defeats in their own stadium with a 2-1 win over Lorient, and Reims scored a last minute goal to beat Montpellier 1-0."
79,03/10/2014,22:52,Bordeaux miss chance to go top,Bordeaux failed to take the chance to go provisionally top of the Ligue 1 table on Friday as they slumped to a 1-0 defeat away to struggling Reims.,"Willy Sagnol's side had enjoyed a fine start to the campaign and had scored in every game before travelling to Champagne country to face a Reims side with the worst defensive record in the division. However, Les Girondins were poor and remain without a win in the top flight at Reims since December 1962. The only goal at the Stade Auguste-Delaune came in bizarre fashion in the 32nd minute, when a cross from the right flank by Cape Verde winger Odair Fortes appeared to take a deflection off Julien Faubert and flew into the net, catching 'keeper Cedric Carrasso off his line. Bordeaux remain two points behind leaders Marseille, who can extend their lead on Saturday when they go to Caen chasing a seventh successive victory. Meanwhile, Reims move three points clear of the relegation zone with a win that eases the pressure on coach Jean-Luc Vasseur, who was only appointed in the summer but looked at risk of losing his job after following a 5-0 defeat to Marseille with a 3-0 reverse at Metz. The game of the weekend in Ligue 1 is on Sunday, when champions Paris Saint-Germain, looking to build on their midweek Champions League win over Barcelona, entertain last season's runners-up Monaco at the Parc des Princes."
80,28/09/2014,19:24,Bordeaux keep pressure on Marseille,"Bordeaux went provisionally back to the top of the Ligue 1 table on Sunday, striking late to beat Rennes 2-1 and leapfrog leaders Marseille.","Willy Sagnol's side have surprised many with their excellent start to the campaign, although it looked like they would have to settle for a point when Wahbi Khazri's opener for the hosts was cancelled out by a Habib Habibou equaliser with just 10 minutes remaining. However, youngster Thomas Toure, who until three days ago had not started a Ligue 1 game, scored his first goal at the highest level in style in the third minute of added time to give Bordeaux the points. The six-time champions move a point clear of Marseille, although Marcelo Bielsa's side will have the chance to regain first place when they host Saint-Etienne later on Sunday. ""The players never gave up. They were cooked at the end, but they kept looking for the winner into the final minutes,"" said a delighted Sagnol. ""They can be proud but they also know that there is work to be done in terms of the performance."" Elsewhere, Lyon made it four games unbeaten but threw away the lead in a 1-1 draw away to Nantes at the Stade de la Beaujoire. Burkina Faso defender Bakary Kone headed in Alexandre Lacazette's free-kick to put OL ahead six minutes into the second half, but he then shoved Georges-Kevin Nkoudou to the ground inside the box, allowing Jordan Veretout to level from the penalty spot in the 72nd minute. Sunday's other game saw Lens draw 0-0 with fellow promoted club Caen at their temporary home in Amiens. On Saturday, Paris Saint-Germain were held to a 1-1 draw at Toulouse, their fourth draw in their last five matches meaning that they will not go into Tuesday's Champions League showdown with Barcelona in the best shape. France's other Champions League group stage representative Monaco suffered a fourth loss in just eight league games this season, falling 1-0 at home to Nice in the Cote d'Azur derby, while there were wins for Lille, Metz, Montpellier and Evian."
81,14/09/2014,19:16,Bordeaux defeat allows Lille to go top,"Bordeaux suffered their first defeat of the new Ligue 1 season at Guingamp on Sunday to lose top spot in the table to Lille, who beat Nantes earlier in the day.","First-half goals from Moustapha Diallo and Christophe Mandanne, the latter from a penalty, condemned Willy Sagnol's Bordeaux to a 2-1 defeat, with a late Cheick Diabate strike proving to be a mere consolation for the visitors in Brittany. Lille had gone clear at the summit earlier in the day thanks to a 2-0 victory against Nantes in the far north, with Divock Origi scoring one goal and then setting up another for Portuguese youngster Rony Lopes. Rene Girard's side, who will face the Russians of FC Krasnodar in the Europa League on Thursday, are a point ahead of both Bordeaux and Saint-Etienne, with champions Paris Saint-Germain a further point adrift in fourth. Diallo headed home a free-kick from on-loan Newcastle United midfielder Sylvain Marveaux to put Guingamp ahead after 26 minutes, and Mandanne netted from the spot eight minutes later after Gregory Sertic had brought down Jeremy Pied inside the box. French Cup holders Guingamp, who go to Fiorentina in the Europa League on Thursday, then held on after giant Malian Diabate had reduced the arrears in the 83rd minute, sweeping home first-time from a Thomas Toure cutback. Lille continued their unbeaten start to the season as two goals in the first four minutes of the second period did for Nantes at the Stade Pierre-Mauroy. After a goalless first half in which Jordan Veretout hit the post for the visitors, Origi opened the scoring within a minute of the restart, heading home a cross from Florent Balmont. Three minutes later, the Belgian international, who was bought by Liverpool in the summer before being loaned back to LOSC, provided the pass for Lopes to apply the finish. It was a first goal for the Portuguese midfielder since he moved to Lille on loan from Manchester City in the summer transfer window. Marseille visit Evian in the day's late kick-off, while Saint-Etienne beat Caen 1-0 on Saturday as champions Paris drew 1-1 at Rennes, despite Zoumana Camara giving them a first-half lead."
82,17/08/2014,23:05,Monaco blown away by Bordeaux comeback,Monaco suffered a second defeat in as many games this season as Bordeaux came from behind to beat the principality club 4-1 in Ligue 1 on Sunday.,"Dimitar Berbatov gave the visitors the lead at the Stade Chaban-Delmas just before half-time, but having lost at home to Lorient last weekend, Leonardo Jardim's side collapsed in the face of a brilliant Bordeaux second-half performance. Two goals from Uruguayan striker Diego Rolan and penalties from Emiliano Sala and Wahbi Khazri made it two wins out of two for Les Girondins, who are top of the fledgling table with a maximum six points after a fine start under their new coach Willy Sagnol. Radamel Falcao was again left on the bench at kick-off for Monaco, although Jardim did make five changes to his team, including recalling Jeremy Toulalan in midfield. Goalkeeper Danijel Subasic had to beat away a Khazri free-kick, but Monaco took the lead in the final minute of the opening period when Valere Germain's right-wing cross was headed into the net at the far post by Bulgarian striker Berbatov. Sagnol, who played in the last Monaco side that won the title in 2000, reshuffled his tactical set-up at the break and Bordeaux required only three minutes to draw level, Rolan turning the ball in after Julien Faubert's cross had been headed back across goal by former Bayern Munich full-back Diego Contento. Argentine striker Sala, making his first Ligue 1 start, then scored from the penalty spot after Aymen Abdennour was harshly adjudged to have fouled his fellow Tunisian Khazri inside the area. Monaco sent on Falcao but they fell further behind in the 65th minute when Rolan, in an offside position, converted after Lamine Sane had headed on a free-kick. And there was worse to come with quarter of an hour remaining as Khazri scored from the spot after drawing a foul from Subasic just inside the box as the Monaco defence imploded. Saint-Etienne are the only other side to have won their opening two matches after they also came from behind to beat Reims 3-1 at the Stade Geoffroy-Guichard. Loic Perrin deflected a Benjamin Moukandjo shot into his own net to give Reims -- who held champions Paris Saint-Germain last week -- an interval lead, but Max-Alain Gradel, Kevin Monnet-Paquet and Mevlut Erding all found the net in the second half for Les Verts. However, like Jardim, new Marseille coach Marcelo Bielsa is finding the adaptation to life in Ligue 1 something of a challenge. After OM threw away a two-goal lead to draw 3-3 in Bastia last week, his first home game at the helm ended in a chorus of jeers after a deflating 2-0 defeat to southern rivals Montpellier, whose goals came from Anthony Mounier and Morgan Sanson. The Stade Velodrome was holding its first game since work finished on a new main stand, completing the refurbishment done for Euro 2016, which France will host, and the game was watched by a crowd of more than 50,000. ""I am not satisfied. One point out of six against opponents who are expected to finish in the bottom half is not a very good outcome,"" admitted Bielsa, although he added: ""I think there were more things of value in the match than things that we need to fix."" On Saturday, PSG brushed aside SC Bastia 2-0 with Lucas and Edinson Cavani on target, but their win was overshadowed by the early loss of Zlatan Ibrahimovic due to a side strain and an after-match incident in the tunnel which saw Bastia's Brazilian striker Brandao headbutt Thiago Motta, leaving the PSG player with a fractured nose."

84,11/08/2014,19:47,Bordeaux sign defender Contento from Bayern,"Bordeaux have signed defender Diego Contento from German champions Bayern Munich on a four-year contract, the French club announced on Monday.","Contento, 24, had spent his entire career at Bayern having coming up through the club's youth system before making his first-team debut in 2010. During his time at Bayern Contento, primarily a left-back, was part of a squad that won the Bundesliga three times as well as the German Cup on three occasions and the 2013 Champions League. He found himself stuck behind Philipp Lahm, David Alaba and Rafinha in the pecking order at Bayern though and made just 49 league appearances over the past five seasons at the Allianz Arena. His arrival at Bordeaux will help fill the void left by the departure of Argentine defender Lucas Orban who moved to Spanish side Valencia on a five-year deal earlier on Monday. Bordeaux, who are now coached by former France defender Willy Sagnol, are also hoping to complete a loan deal for Liverpool's Portuguese centre-back Tiago Ilori."

Khazri represented France at U21 level before switching to play for Tunisia. He has played 61 Ligue 1 matches the past two seasons, scoring 13 goals. He becomes Bordeaux's second recruit after the arrival of central defender Nicolas Pallois from Niort. Bastia, meanwhile, announced the signing of striker Christopher Maboulou from Ligue 2 Chateauroux on a three-year deal. The 24-year-old's signing follows that of Ivorian striker Junior Gadji Tallo."
