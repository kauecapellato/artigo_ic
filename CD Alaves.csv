0,13/02/2021,23:14,Messi leads Barca to thumping Alaves win,Barcelona might not be able to catch Atletico Madrid but they may fancy their chances against Paris Saint-Germain after Lionel Messi scored twice in a 5-1 thrashing of Alaves on Saturday.,"Messi fired in two sensational long-range efforts and would have had a hat-trick at Camp Nou had a dubious VAR decision in the first half not ruled Antoine Griezmann offside. He did tee up a second of the night for the 21-year-old Francisco Trincao and was instrumental in Junior Firpo adding a fifth too, a flamboyant scoop freeing Griezmann to send a pass to Firpo at the back post. Victory means Barca trail Atletico Madrid by eight points again after Atletico had temporarily pulled 11 clear thanks to a hard-fought 2-1 win over Granada earlier on Saturday. Barcelona and Real Madrid have both played a game more than Atleti, with Zinedine Zidane's side facing Valencia at home on Sunday. Atletico's win was a significant psychological boost on the back of slipping up for the first time in nine games at home to Celta Vigo earlier this week. Their advantage may prove too large to close but Barcelona's tie against PSG in the Champions League, which looked to have the French side as firm favourites when the draw was made in December, now feels harder to call. Mauricio Pochettino's side will probably be favourites ahead of the first leg at Camp Nou on Tuesday but Barca have certainly found form in recent weeks, and Messi looks close to his lethal best. The question is whether a free-flowing attack, full of talent and orchestrated by Messi, can hurt PSG enough to make up for what remains a shaky defence, depleted by injuries and vulnerable to the counter-attack. With Gerard Pique and the emerging Ronald Araujo both out injured, Frenkie de Jong filled in again in central defence, although the Dutchman has arguably been Barcelona's most improved player this year in the midfield three. Instead there was a start for Ilaix Kourouma in midfield, the 18-year-old academy product who assisted Trincao's opening goal but whose misplaced pass led to Luis Rioja briefly giving Alaves hope. After Trincao had swept home, Messi thought he had made it two, pouncing on a rebound after Griezmann missed but the goal was ruled out, even though replays suggested Griezmann was onside. Messi made amends soon after, latching onto a Sergio Busquets pass, darting in-field and ripping a shot in off the post. Rioja capitalised on Ilaix's mistake just before the hour but Barca pulled away with three goals in six minutes. Pedri's pass freed Messi but he failed to round Fernando Pacheco and instead the ball spilled out for Trincao to score his second. Messi slammed a stinging strike into the top corner from 25 yards to make it 4-1 before perhaps the goal of the night came last, Messi scooping over for Griezmann, who volleyed to the back post where Firpo could not miss. Atletico had earlier swerved a second consecutive slip by squeezing past Granada at Los Carmenes, a victory secured by Angel Correa's fortuitous winner in the second half. There was a hint of luck in Granada's equaliser too, Yangel Herrera's shot deflecting off Marcos Llorente, who had himself put Atletico in front only three minutes earlier. ""The most important thing today was the fight and the energy of the team,"" said Simeone afterwards. At the full-time whistle, he shook his fists and sprinted down the tunnel, his relief evident at the end of a game that could easily have seen more points dropped for his side. Luis Suarez had scored in six of the previous seven games but for once the 34-year-old was not the matchwinner, with Llorente and Correa -- two unsung heroes this season -- instead proving the difference. Llorente's goal was his seventh of the season while his lay-off for Correa was his sixth assist. ""As coaches trophies are wonderful because they fill you with excitement and glory,"" Simeone said of Llorente. ""But when you work with a footballer and see them grow, you feel even more joy and more enthusiasm to keep doing what you're doing."""
1,23/01/2021,23:48,Hazard leads Real Madrid to Alaves rout to relieve pressure on Zidane,"Eden Hazard scored one goal and set up another as Real Madrid thrashed Alaves 4-1 on Saturday to ease the pressure on their coach Zinedine Zidane, who was absent after testing positive for Covid-19.","Zidane's position has come under scrutiny again after Wednesday's defeat by third-tier side Alcoyano in the Copa del Rey but Madrid responded at Mendizorroza without their coach, or their captain Sergio Ramos, who was out with a knee injury. Goals from Casemiro, Karim Benzema and Hazard put Madrid three up at half-time and while Alaves briefly threatened a fightback when Joselu headed in, Benzema added a second to put the result beyond doubt. The victory is only Real Madrid's second in six matches and leaves them four points behind Atletico Madrid, who have two games in hand and play Valencia at home on Sunday. ""The goals are good for the confidence, for everyone,"" said Benzema. ""It's been a tough week for us because we always have to win, always have to be on the up. There's always pressure. Today it went well, not just for me, for everyone."" Zidane was confirmed to have tested positive on Friday, leaving his assistant David Bettoni to take charge in the dug-out, although Bettoni was pictured on the telephone in the second half. ""He was very happy with the attitude of the team,"" said Bettoni when asked what Zidane had told him after the game. ""He told me to congratulate the players, as he would have done if he was with us."" Bettoni took off Hazard as Alaves were gaining belief early in the second period but the Belgian enjoyed a positive outing overall that Zidane will hope is the start of a revival. The 29-year-old has had a nightmare year and a half in Spain, with this only his third goal in La Liga and his first in the league away from home since joining from Chelsea for 100 million euros. ""We have to have more patience, it's true that at Real Madrid patience is difficult,"" said Bettoni. ""I think the best version of Hazard has been seen a little today and that every game we'll see it a bit more."" Benzema was the chief beneficiary as Madrid forgot their recent woes in attack. There were strong performances too from Toni Kroos, Casemiro and Luka Modric in midfield, the latter providing a handful of supreme passes, one of which led to Benzema's second and Madrid's fourth. Madrid's first half was probably their best of the season, prompted by an early goal from Casemiro to boost confidence, the Brazilian heading Kroos' corner inside the post. Hazard scuffed a chance wide but was involved in the second as he tried to flick Lucas Vazquez's pass into Benzema but feathering it was enough, with Benzema given space to fire into the top left-hand corner. Hazard made it three four minutes later. Kroos looked up and as Alaves pushed out, Hazard surged in behind, the ball looping over for him to control and finish past Fernando Pachecho. Alaves pushed hard after half-time and were given hope when Joselu headed in from Lucas Perez's free-kick. Yet the comeback was short-lived as Benzema raced onto another curling Modric pass out to the left, nipped inside and stroked into the far corner. Earlier, Youssef En-Nesyri scored his second hat-trick in four games as Sevilla dispatched Cadiz 3-0 to move up to third. The Moroccan striker's treble takes him level with Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez at the top of the league's scoring charts with 11 goals and makes it seven for him in the last four matches. Cadiz, meanwhile, slip to ninth, below Real Betis, who came from behind to salvage a 2-2 draw at Real Sociedad by scoring twice in the last five minutes. Real Sociedad drop to sixth, three points adrift of Barca in fourth. Betis climb to eighth."
2,22/01/2021,03:15,"Zidane, Villas-Boas under the cosh, Zlatan boosts Milan - what to watch in Europe this weekend","Real Madrid hope to put an embarrassing midweek cup exit behind them, while Andre Villas-Boas's future is under scrutiny at Marseille and AC Milan look to keep their rivals in the rearview mirror with Zlatan Ibrahimovic back from injury.","AFP Sport selects some of the standout football action in Europe this weekend: Alaves v Real Madrid, Saturday 2000 GMT After successive defeats in the Spanish Super Cup and Copa del Rey, the second a shock loss to third-tier Alcoyano, Real Madrid will try to reignite their La Liga title challenge away to Alaves. Zinedine Zidane's side are playing catch up to Atletico Madrid, despite having played a game more, after draws against struggling Elche and Osasuna, two of the league's bottom three, in recent weeks. Alaves beat Madrid 2-1 in the capital in late November but have won just once in eight matches since, their slide into a relegation scrap costing coach Pablo Machin his job last week with former Spain international Abelardo Fernandez returning to take charge. AC Milan v Atalanta, Saturday 1700 GMT Zlatan Ibrahimovic wasted little time shaking off any rust accrued while sidelined by a muscle injury as he scored twice against Cagliari on Monday, in his first Serie A start in two months. The 39-year-old Swede has scored 12 goals in just seven starts this season, second only to Cristiano Ronaldo in the league, and Milan this week strengthened their attack with the signing of ex-Juventus striker Mario Mandzukic on a free transfer. ""Zlatan and I have a lot of experience. In football, it's important to instill fear in your opponents, to fight and to protect your team,"" said Mandzukic, who could make his debut against an Atalanta side that arrives in Milan unbeaten in nine league outings. Monaco v Marseille, Saturday 2000 GMT Marseille are reeling after two straight defeats followed a draw at lowly Dijon, a run that has shattered any fanciful Ligue 1 title dreams and cast considerable doubt over the future of coach Andre Villas-Boas. ""I am at the service of the board. I am not here to cause problems. If they decide that I am not up to it in terms of results, then it will be the time to leave. If a change is needed, I am at their service,"" Villas-Boas said following Wednesday's 1-0 home loss to Lens. Club president Jacques-Henri Eyraud blasted the players as ""not fit to wear the shirt"" in the wake of last weekend's defeat by bottom side Nimes. A trip to Niko Kovac's in-form Monaco could spell further trouble at the Velodrome. Schalke v Bayern Munich, Sunday 1430 GMT With their 30-match winless run finally over, Schalke will want no reminding of what happened when they met Bayern Munich on the opening day of the season -- a crushing 8-0 defeat setting the tone for a disastrous first half of the campaign. In 19-year-old US forward Matthew Hoppe, Schalke have found a ray of hope in their fight against relegation, but the Royal Blues are eight points from potential safety at the halfway stage. Bayern have clawed out tough wins over Freiburg and Augsburg in their two previous games to regain control atop the Bundesliga, sending a ""signal to the rest of the chasing pack"" their hunger remains strong despite a recent dip, says Manuel Neuer. Sporting v Braga, Saturday 1945 GMT Having sparred with their rivals off the pitch over the handling of Covid-19 cases, Sporting Lisbon got the better of Porto in Tuesday's semi-final thanks to two late goals from Cape Verde-born Jovane Cabral. A day later, Braga overcame their ""outrage"" at Benfica's efforts to seek a postponement of their tie, booking a place in the final in Leiria with a 2-1 victory over an opposing side hit by a raft of coronavirus infections. Sporting and Braga have combined to win each of the past three editions of the Portuguese League Cup, the former lifting the trophy in 2018 and 2019 before Braga defeated Porto in last year's final under current Sporting boss Ruben Amorim."
3,19/01/2021,23:59,Suso cracker lifts Sevilla past Alaves,A magnificent long-range strike from Suso secured Sevilla a 2-1 victory at Alaves on Tuesday that sent them up to fourth in La Liga and within a point of Barcelona.,"Moroccan striker Youssef En-Nesyri, a reported January transfer target for West Ham, turned in a Jesus Navas cross to give Sevilla the lead on three minutes. Edgar Mendez soon levelled for the hosts but a thunderous 30-yard drive from Suso put Sevilla back in front on the half-hour, with goalkeeper Bono saving a stoppage-time penalty from Joselu to preserve the win. Julen Lopetegui's side moved up two spots ahead of a favourable run of matches against clubs largely in the bottom half of the table. Real Valladolid recovered from two goals down to draw 2-2 at home to Elche while Cadiz and Levante also ended two apiece. Leaders Atletico Madrid can extend their cushion at the top when they visit Eibar on Thursday. Diego Simeone's side are four points clear of Real Madrid with two games in hand."
4,12/01/2021,16:36,"La Liga strugglers Huesca, Alaves sack coaches","La Liga's bottom side Huesca dismissed coach Michel Sanchez on Tuesday after a run of just one win in 18 games, while Alaves sacked Pablo Machin with the club barely above the relegation zone.","Huesca have lost four of their last five matches to fall six points adrift of safety following their promotion to Spain's top division for just the second time. Alaves parted ways with Machin following a poor series of results to leave the club in 16th place and only two points clear of the bottom three. Machin oversaw a 2-1 victory over champions Real Madrid in November, but his team has won just once in seven games since and only four times in the league all season. The former Sevilla and Espanyol boss had been lined up to take over at Qingdao Huanghai in China in July but pulled out for personal reasons, reportedly after one of his relatives contracted Covid-19. Alaves appointed Abelardo Fernandez as Machin's successor, the ex-Spain international returning to the club he coached from 2017 to 2019."
5,10/01/2021,19:09,Negredo leads Cadiz to victory over 10-man Alaves,Alvaro Negredo helped Cadiz register their first victory in five games on Sunday as they defeated 10-man Alaves 3-1.,"A red card for Alaves defender Alberto Rodriguez proved pivotal in the second half, with Antony Lozano and Negredo each scoring soon after to seal the win for Cadiz. Alaves had earlier pulled level through a Joselu penalty after Alex put Cadiz in front. The win ends a barren spell for Cadiz, who take one step closer to safety after being promoted last term. They climb to ninth while Alaves sit 14th. Earlier, Levante had also moved into the top half of the table by coming from behind to beat Eibar 2-1, Gonzalo Melero and Jose Luis Morales scoring the goals for them in the second half."
6,28/11/2020,23:03,Real Madrid lose at home to Alaves in La Liga,Real Madrid slumped to a 2-1 loss at home to Alaves in La Liga on Saturday as Zinedine Zidane's side suffered a third defeat in 10 matches in Spain this season.,"Lucas Perez scored a fifth-minute penalty at Alfredo di Stefano stadium and Joselu added a second just after half-time following an awful mistake by goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois. Casemiro gave Real a lifeline on 86 minutes but Alaves held on for a victory that lifted them to ninth. Madrid remain fourth, six points behind leaders Real Sociedad and city rivals Atletico."
7,31/10/2020,23:02,Barcelona held by 10-man Alaves to extend winless streak in La Liga,"Barcelona made it four La Liga games without a win on Saturday after failing to beat 10-man Alaves, a 1-1 draw leaving Ronald Koeman's side sitting 12th in the table.","Luis Rioja put Alaves in front at Mendizorrotza after an error from Barca goalkeeper Neto, with Antoine Griezmann equalising in the second half, a minute after Jota Peleteiro was sent off. But with almost half an hour left and a extra man, Barcelona were still unable to find a winner, instead settling for a draw to go with recent defeats by Getafe and Real Madrid, and another draw against Sevilla. It means Madrid, who had earlier won 4-1 at home to Huesca, now sit eight points clear of their Catalan rivals while Atletico are six ahead after they beat Osasuna 3-1. Atletico will go top if they win a game in hand."
8,19/07/2020,19:31,Messi scores twice as Barca finish with five-goal rout over Alaves,Lionel Messi should claim a record seventh La Liga golden boot after scoring twice in a 5-0 win over Alaves on Sunday as Barcelona ended their disappointing season on a more positive note.,"Messi's double takes his league tally to 25 goals for the season and puts him four clear of Karim Benzema in the race for the 'Pichichi Trophy' ahead of Real Madrid's last game later on Sunday against Leganes. Ansu Fati, Luis Suarez and Nelson Semedo also chipped in for an emphatic victory against an Alaves side who looked off the pace after guaranteeing survival earlier in the week. Barca had their fate confirmed on Thursday too, when defeat to Osasuna handed Real Madrid the title and brought scrutiny on all areas of the club, including the future of Quique Setien as coach. Messi delivered a stinging assessment after the game but Setien said on Saturday he still believes Barcelona, at their best, can win the Champions League next month. ""Today was very different,"" said Messi. ""We have taken an important step in terms of attitude and commitment and things can follow on from that. We have shown we can change."" Unless Benzema runs riot against Leganes, Messi will finish as La Liga's top scorer for a seventh time, pulling clear of Telmo Zarra's six while playing for Athletic Bilbao in the forties and fifties. This sparkling attacking display certainly gave a glimpse of what is possible when Messi, Suarez, Fati and the promising Riqui Puig find their rhythm but Napoli in the last 16, and potentially Bayern Munich in the quarter-finals, will offer a completely different test. There could be fitness concerns for Setien too. Clement Lenglet hobbled off with what looked like a groin problem, with Antoine Griezmann and Samuel Umtiti already out injured. Suspensions for Gerard Pique, Junior Firpo and Ivan Rakitic meant Setien was able to name only three outfield players on his bench. But Setien has increasingly been putting his faith in youth and the 20-year-old Puig impressed again in midfield while 21-year-old Ronald Araujo gave a composed, albeit largely unchallenged, performance in defence. Barcelona were three goals up before half-time and could have had more. They hit the woodwork three times in the first 15 minutes as Puig and Arturo Vidal both rattled the crossbar before Messi's curling shot hit the post. Fati finally opened the scoring when Messi's deflected cross looped up to the near post, where the 17-year-old was quickest to react. Suarez spurned a one-on-one after a brilliant Puig pass and Puig was also involved in the second, weaving inside and teeing up Messi to stride through and finish. Vidal went close with a flicked header from Messi's cross before Suarez capped a superb move by heading in his 17th league goal after Jordi Alba had volleyed Messi's pass across. Another Puig through ball just before the hour allowed Semedo to lash in a fourth, only for Messi to have the last word with a smart finish on the half-volley."
9,11/07/2020,00:55,Real Madrid in sight of title after beating Alaves,Real Madrid could win La Liga on Monday after a routine 2-0 win over Alaves on Friday put them within touching distance of the title.,"With suspended skipper Sergio Ramos sitting in the stands, Karim Benzema took over the armband and then penalty duties, firing in from the spot before teeing up Marco Asensio to add a second at the Alfredo di Stefano Stadium. After restoring their four-point advantage at the top of the table, the pressure is back on Barcelona. If Barca fail to win away at Real Valladolid on Saturday, Madrid will clinch the title with two games to spare by beating Granada on Monday at Los Carmenes. Yet even if Madrid have to wait, it seems inevitable they will hoist the trophy given they also boast the superior head-to-head record against Barcelona with three games left. Madrid can afford to draw two of those, even if Barcelona manage three victories out of three. ""We still don't know what is going to happen,"" said Real coach Zinedine Zidane. ""La Liga is very hard and we have three finals still to go."" ""We have to stay focused,"" added Raphael Varane. After sacking their coach Asier Garitano last week following five consecutive defeats Alaves never looked likely to cause an upset. This loss in Juan Ramon Lopez Muniz's first game in charge leaves them hovering above the relegation zone, only three points ahead of Real Mallorca, who have hope after their win over Levante on Thursday. Zidane will be relieved all the same, particularly as he had to do without a string of key players. Ramos and Dani Carvajal were both banned while Marcelo was injured, taking out three of Madrid's regular back four. Eden Hazard was unable to start but came on in the second half to ease concerns about niggling problems with his ankle. A makeshift defence, including Lucas Vazquez at right-back, chalked up another clean sheet, Madrid's fifth in a row for the first time in 12 years. It is also their sixth in eight gams since the restart. Alaves might have broke that run in the first few minutes as Joselu headed against the crossbar and Lucas Perez's follow-up had to be cleared off the line by Varane. Eder Militao then had to make a perfectly timed challenge to prevent Perez going clear. But Madrid survived and then took the lead in the 11th minute, Ferland Mendy driving to the line and going down under the sliding tackle of Ximo Navarro, who caught him with his trailing leg. Benzema scored the penalty for his 23rd goal of the season. Oliver Burke twice caused Madrid problems with weaving runs forward before Benzema hurt his neck from an awkward fall on the stroke of half-time. Benzema was able to continue but injured referee Gil Manzano was replaced by Rodriguez Carpallo, whose first big decision was to allow Madrid's second goal. Rodrygo did well to muscle his way through midfield before freeing Benzema, who looked offside but sped forward and side-footed for Asensio to tap in. Replays showed Benzema had timed his run and the goal stood. Thibaut Courtois had to make two smart saves but Madrid were cruising by the end. Rodrygo and Vinicius Junior should have made it three when queueing up at the back post but two was enough."
10,13/06/2020,20:01,'Decisive' Wu leads Espanyol to win after coronavirus recovery,"Chinese striker Wu Lei, who tested positive for coronavirus in March, scored on his first game back on Saturday as Espanyol sealed a morale-boosting 2-0 win over Alaves in La Liga.","Espanyol looked doomed to relegation as they restarted six points adrift of safety after three months away but Wu's excellent performance has given them renewed hope of survival. It marks a particularly impressive return for the 28-year-old, who was one of six Espanyol players to be diagnosed with the virus in March, with the Chinese football federation confirming Wu had ""mild symptoms"". But he looked sharp at the empty RCDE Stadium. He hurried Alaves goalkeeper Fernandes Pacheco into a mistake in the 19th minute when, under pressure from Wu, he handled outside the box and was sent off. Wu then had a goal ruled out for handball himself before applying a cool finish from a one-on-one early in the second half. In between, Bernardo Espinosa put Espanyol in front just before the break. ""He was decisive,"" said Espanyol coach Abelardo Fernandez when asked about Wu afterwards. ""He caused the sending off and he scored the second goal. He did everything we asked him to do, he stretched their defence. He did his job perfectly."" Wu joined Espanyol from Shanghai SIPG in January last year, when he said he wanted to prove China's best players could deliver at the highest level. He has already scored 10 goals this season for the Catalonia-based club and in January became the first Chinese player to score against Barcelona in a 2-2 draw with the reigning Spanish champions. The state-run China Global Television Network said Wu's goal heralded ""a new chapter"" for football in the country."
11,21/12/2019,18:20,Messi shines in sparkling Barcelona Christmas stroll,Barcelona go into the brief Spanish winter break on top of La Liga after a glittering show from Lionel Messi helped the defending champions beat Alaves 4-1 on Saturday.,"Real Madrid, who drew 0-0 in Barcelona in the midweek Clasico, can draw level top on 39 points but behind on goal difference if they win at home to Atletico Bilbao on Sunday. Seville are assured third place over Christmas on 34 points after their 2-0 win in Mallorca. French star Antoine Griezzman put Barca ahead with a lovely snap-shot from outside the area after a slick exchange with Messi on 14 minutes. ""I needed to score a goal before the holidays, now I can go into them happy with myself,"" said the French World Cup winner who has scored just seven goals since his summer move. ""We have a great team with some of the best players around and when we don't click, well, there's always Messi."" Messi had already had a better strike ruled out by a harsh VAR decision, while Mohican-haired Chilean forward Arturo Vidal had tried a dramatic overhead effort that the Alaves 'keeper just about stopped with his feet. Vidal bagged a second just before half-time when put into open space on the right as Barcelona overwhelmed the visitors, but they should have gone into the break more than 2-0 ahead. Pere Pons pulled one back on 56 minute for Alaves with neither Gerard Pique nor the returning Samuel Umtiti on hand as his header flew home from close range. Even with four defenders around him, Messi was unstopabble on 69 minutes as he unleashed a trademark left foot strike from outside the box. The goal illustrated why the diminutive attacker recently won a sixth Ballon d'Or. A sweetly-struck Luis Suarez penalty made it 4-1 on 75 minutes."
12,30/11/2019,15:24,Madrid go top with gutsy win at Alaves,Sergio Ramos scored a goal and conceded a penalty as Real Madrid battled past Alaves on Saturday to go top of La Liga before Sunday's game between Barcelona and Atletico Madrid.,"Barca and Atletico face off at the Wanda Metropolitano and Madrid did all they could to take advantage, with Dani Carvajal the unlikely matchwinner in a gritty 2-1 victory over Alaves. ""We know at these grounds that teams give everything against Madrid,"" said Marcelo. ""It's in these matches that leagues are won."" ""We fought until the end,"" added Madrid coach Zinedine Zidane. Ramos had headed them in front shortly after half-time only to concede a needless penalty for throwing his arm across Joselu, which Lucas Perez converted before Carvajal poked in. Madrid pull three points clear of Barcelona and six ahead of Atletico, who have played a game more than the top two. Sevilla, in third, host Leganes on Sunday. Alaves stay 13th. A 1-0 defeat at Mendizorrotza 13 months ago came three weeks before Julen Lopetegui was sacked as coach but this time Madrid showed the kind of steel that was so painfully lacking last season. On a wet and windy afternoon in the Basque country, Zidane's side never showed the verve and creativity that was so impressive in the draw against Paris Saint-Germain on Wednesday. But this was a gutsy performance that means they have now won six and drawn two of their last eight matches in all competitions, with the Clasico against Barcelona next month fast approaching. ""A few weeks ago people were saying a lot about this team,"" said Zidane. ""But we have to stay the same, stay calm and keep working because this is just the start."" Gareth Bale made his first Madrid start since October 5 after recovering from a calf injury and his first too since his controversial celebration with Wales earlier this month, which sparked anger among his club's supporters. Bale hit the post in the first half but faded and was replaced by Rodrygo after Alaves' equaliser. With Eden Hazard out injured, Isco also kept his place while Alphonse Areola was given a rare outing in goal ahead of the rested Thibaut Courtois. Madrid were lucky not to concede another penalty early on as Aleix Vidal slalomed inside Ramos and then Eder Militao, whose dangling leg caught Vidal's foot. Referee Guillermo Cuadra felt the fall was exaggerated. At the other end, Bale hit the post with a header and Karim Benzema latched onto a quick throw but instead of shooting, hooked the ball back for Isco whose effort was saved. Alaves grew in confidence as the rain grew heavier yet Madrid regrouped at half-time and took the lead soon after as Ramos was given a free header to glance in Toni Kroos' crossed free-kick. But after scoring his sixth goal of the season, Ramos gifted Alaves an equaliser in the 66th minute by outmuscling Joselu in the penalty area, only to throw an arm across the forward's chest. Perez made no mistake. Bale went off for Rodrygo and Alaves might have been able to build on their momentum if they had consolidated. Instead, parity lasted three minutes as Isco met Luka Modric's cross at the back post and while Pacheco did brilliantly to save, Carvajal reacted faster than Victor Laguardia to the rebound. Perez almost drove in a late equaliser but Marcelo made a diving block and Ximo Navarro's header had to be clawed away by Areola as Madrid held on."
13,15/09/2019,18:30,Jordan free-kick fires Sevilla to top of La Liga,Sevilla moved to the top of the early La Liga table on Sunday as Joan Jordan's brilliant free-kick helped them seal a 1-0 win at Alaves.,"Julen Lopetegui's side continued their excellent start to the campaign, remaining unbeaten and moving a point clear of Atletico Madrid, who lost 2-0 at Real Sociedad on Saturday, at the summit. Sevilla host Real Madrid next Sunday in a meeting of two sides yet to taste defeat. ""That means nothing (being top),"" said Sevilla coach Lopetegui, whose team next face a marathon trip to Baku to play Qarabag in their Europa League opener on Thursday. ""The only thing that (being top) tells me is that the team is doing things well. We have to keep improving before going to Baku, where they will make it very difficult for us."" It was a first defeat of the season for Alaves, who slipped to 11th in the standings. Lopetegui, who joined Sevilla for his first job since being sacked in quick succession by both Spain and Real Madrid, saw one of his close-season signings produce the game's defining moment. Midfielder Jordan, who arrived at Sevilla from Eibar for a reported 14 million euros ($15.62 million), curled home a wonderful free-kick in the 37th minute which flew into the top corner to give him his second goal of the season. The visitors comfortably saw out the match to claim their third league win this term, as Alaves failed to muster a shot on target. Elsewhere on Sunday, Robert Ibanez's 81st-minute equaliser kept Osasuna unbeaten after a 1-1 draw at Valladolid, while Granada moved up to seventh with a 2-0 success at nine-man Celta Vigo and Espanyol won at Eibar. Real claimed a 3-2 win over Levante at the Santiago Bernabeu on Saturday, when reigning champions Barcelona eased to a 5-2 victory against Valencia, with 16-year-old Ansu Fati scoring inside two minutes."
14,24/04/2019,00:18,Messi rested as win over Alaves edges Barca closer to the title,Barcelona will win La Liga on Wednesday if Atletico Madrid lose to Valencia after a 2-0 victory over Alaves gave them a 12-point lead at the top of the table.,"Lionel Messi started on the bench at Mendizorrotza on Tuesday in a move that made clear just how comfortable Barca are in this title race, its conclusion surely now only a matter of when rather than if. Should Atletico avoid defeat to Valencia at the Wanda Metropolitano, the Catalans will still be crowned champions on Saturday at the Camp Nou with a victory over Levante. They could even have it wrapped up before kick-off on Saturday if Atletico fail to take at least four points from Valencia and Real Valladolid, the latter whom they face a few hours earlier on Saturday. ""It's an incredibly valuable win,"" coach Ernesto Valverde said. ""In the end however much as people say the league is won, it has to be achieved on the field. ""We are at the gates now, needing three points more with four games ahead. It is an immense joy to be in this position after so many months of work."" Real Madrid, who play their game in hand against Getafe on Thursday, sit 16 points adrift in third. Alaves stay eighth, their hopes of a Europa League spot fading fast. Messi came on as a substitute in the 61st minute shortly after his team had scored twice, Carles Alena guiding one into the corner before Luis Suarez, in Messi's absence, took and dispatched a penalty. Valverde leaving out his captain and star player, presumably with an eye on next week's Champions League semi-final against Liverpool, was a luxury Barcelona have earned and can afford. Liverpool, still jostling with Manchester City in the Premier League, are unlikely to feel the same sort of confidence when they face Huddersfield on Friday. ""The idea at half-time was to play Leo because the result was not clear,"" Valverde said. ""But regarding the Golden Boot and that sort of thing, we are only focused on what we have to do to win. ""Leo has a lot of individual challenges ahead but today it was time to rest."" Other players were preserved too. Jordi Alba, Clement Lenglet and Arthur Melo all began on the bench, allowing Samuel Umtiti more minutes as he recovers from a knee injury, while the struggling Philippe Coutinho started in a front three with Ousmane Dembele and Suarez. Alena, the 21-year-old Spaniard, scored his second La Liga goal and showed again why many believe he could be a key figure for Barcelona in the years to come. Suarez's goal, meanwhile, was his 21st in the league and marks the fourth consecutive season in which he has passed the 20 mark for Barca. He might have scored earlier but shot straight at Fernando Pacheco when sent clear in the opening stages, while Coutinho followed up but his rebound was blocked. Sergi Roberto fired over from inside the area but it was his run down the right that created Alena's opener in the 54th minute. After a neat exchange with Arturo Vidal, Sergi played inside, through the legs of Suarez and to the feet of Alena. He controlled and placed the ball coolly into the corner. Six minutes later, and one before the introduction of Messi, Suarez doubled the lead from the spot. Umtiti bundled in on the line and as VAR checked him for offside, Alaves' Tomas Pina was shown to have handballed moments before. Suarez made no mistake. Messi hit the woodwork, his shot well saved by Pacheco, and Coutinho drove wide late on. Two was enough for the win and, possibly, the title."
15,04/04/2019,22:06,Sevilla back into European contention,Goals from Roque Mesa and Pablo Sarabia lifted Sevilla back into European contention on Thursday with a crucial 2-0 win over Alaves.,"The Basque side moved up from seventh to sixth, displacing Alaves to go level on points with fifth-placed Valencia who downed Real Madrid 24 hours earlier. Mesa put Sevilla into a 41st minute lead with a perfectly weighted rising shot from the right that dipped over keeper Fernando Pacheco and into the far corner of the net. With Alaves struggling to make an impact the home side doubled their advantage when Sarabia's skimming shot flashed past the hapless Pacheco and into an empty net with 10 minutes remaining. For Sevilla this was a vital three points after Valencia had inflicted Zinedine Zidane's first defeat since returning as Real boss on Wednesday. Valencia's 2-1 home success moved them to within a point of La Liga's top four, on 46 points, only ahead now of Sevilla on goal difference."
16,06/10/2018,22:18,Lopetegui dismisses uncertain future after Madrid hit 33-year drought,Julen Lopetegui insisted it is too early to be questioning his future despite Real Madrid suffering a shock defeat by Alaves on Saturday to make it four games without a victory.,"It is four games without a goal too for the European champions, their longest scoring drought since 1985, as Manu Garcia headed home in the 95th minute to send the Mendizorrotza Stadium wild. It is the first time they have beaten Madrid at home in 87 years. Alaves fans ran onto the pitch to celebrate their stunning 1-0 win and the chants continued long after the final whistle. For Real, this was another body blow and to make matters worse, Gareth Bale and Karim Benzema, their chief attacking threats, were both forced off injured. Bale had missed the Champions League loss to CSKA Moscow on Tuesday with a groin strain. It means Barcelona can go three points clear if they win their game in hand against Valencia on Sunday while Alaves' excellent start to the season continues. They move up to third, level on points with Real. Lopetegui had been asked on Friday if he felt under pressure at the club he left Spain for on the eve of the World Cup and the question was put to him again after the match here. ""It interests you but is not a question that concerns me,"" Lopetegui said. ""We know what the life of a coach is, especially at Real Madrid, but we also know it is October and you have to keep perspective and stay calm."" Captain Sergio Ramos was more emphatic. ""It's other people who make those decisions but it's never good to have a change of coach,"" he said. ""It would be crazy."" Talk of change feels premature but it will increase if Madrid fail to find fluency soon and, in particular, if Barca pull away. The Clasico at the Camp Nou looms at the end of the month. ""We are disappointed,"" Lopetegui added. ""In the end, defeat is a harsh punishment."" Thibaut Courtois took over from Keylor Navas in goal and was at fault for Alaves' winner. The Belgian edged out but failed to claim a cross, leaving Garcia to head into any empty net. Supporters behind that goal had unfurled three banners during the match that read: 'A club is not made great by its titles but by its people'. Some of the 19,000 fans here might have seen their team beat Madrid at the Santiago Bernabeu in 2000, but not at home. It was 1931 when that last happened. There was a UEFA Cup final too in 2001, which they lost to Gerard Houllier's Liverpool, but recent years have been tough, with three seasons spent in the third tier. Alaves climbed their way back up and reached the final of the Copa del Rey in 2017. But for drama, this will be hard to beat. ""I feel very proud,"" Garcia said. ""It is the most beautiful day of my sporting life."" Bale had been passed fit to start while Luka Modric and Ramos returned after being rested against CSKA. Ramos clattered Jonathan Calleri early on and then elbowed the Alaves striker in the face. The referee deemed it accidental but Calleri responded with a clip on the defender's leg. Bale span in behind and backheeled to Benzema, who teed up Dani Ceballos to shoot. Benzema had a header volleyed off the line by Victor Laguardia. But Alaves grew into the half and it took Raphael Varane's diving header to prevent Ibai Gomez from tapping in at the back post. Benzema was replaced at half-time by Mariano Diaz, who instantly looked more dangerous. The rain came down and the whistles grew louder as Madrid dominated the ball but their opponents could have won it sooner when Jony sprinted clear, only to drag his finish wide. Bale trudged off and another Alaves chance arrived in injury time. Courtois came for the cross but failed to gather and Ruben Sobrino sent the ball to the back post. Garcia was perfectly placed."
17,06/10/2018,20:47,Real Madrid slip to shock Alaves defeat,Real Madrid sank to a shock 1-0 defeat by Alaves on Saturday after a 95th-minute winner from Manu Garcia consigned the European champions to a fourth game without victory.,"It is four games without a goal too for Julen Lopetegui's side, their longest scoring drought since 1985, as Garcia headed home to send the Mendizorrotza Stadium wild. Alaves fans ran onto the pitch to celebrate their famous win and the chants continued long after the final whistle blew. For Madrid this was another body blow and to make matters worse, Gareth Bale, their chief forward threat, had hobbled off injured late on. He missed the Champions League loss to CSKA Moscow on Tuesday with a groin strain. Karim Benzema, out of form and bereft of confidence, was off too after being substituted at half-time but it was Thibaut Courtois at fault for the goal. He came for the cross but failed to claim. It means Barcelona can go three points clear if they win their game in hand against Valencia on Sunday while Alaves' excellent start to the season continues. They move up to third, level on points with Real. Lopetegui had been asked on Friday if he felt under pressure at the club he left Spain for on the eve of the World Cup. Talk of change is perhaps premature but it will certainly increase if Madrid cannot find fluency soon and, in particular, if Barca pull away. The Clasico at the Camp Nou looms at the end of the month. Bale had been passed fit to start while Luka Modric and Sergio Ramos returned after being rested against CSKA. Courtois took over from Keylor Navas in goal. The first half was a fight, full of heavy touches, tussles and collisions but largely vacant of clear-cut chances. Ramos was at the heart of the battle as he clattered Jonathan Calleri and then elbowed the Alaves striker in the face. The referee deemed it accidental but Calleri clearly did not and responded soon after with a late clip on the defender's leg. Bale span in behind, backheeled to Benzema who teed up Dani Ceballos to shoot, before Benzema had a header volleyed off the line by Victor Laguardia. But Alaves grew into the half and it took Raphael Varane's diving header to prevent Ibai Gomez from tapping in at the back post. Benzema was hauled off at half-time and Mariano Diaz instantly looked more dangerous. Only a dangling Laguardia leg ended his weaving run in the penalty area while Real right-back Alvaro Odriozola was slipped in behind but failed to find a team-mate with the pull-back. Lopetegui threw his arms up in frustration. The rain came down, the whistles grew louder as Madrid dominated possession but Alaves could have won it sooner when Jony sprinted clear, only to drag his finish wide. Bale went off and another Alaves chance came in injury time. Courtois came for a cross but failed to gather, allowing Garcia to head in a dramatic winner."
18,20/08/2018,14:06,African players in Europe: Iwobi goal in vain as Arsenal flop again,"Nigeria and Arsenal winger Alex Iwobi opened his 2018/2019 English Premier League goal account at the weekend, but could not prevent a 3-2 loss at London rivals Chelsea.","The Gunners might have avoided a second straight league defeat had 2015 African Footballer of the Year Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang from Gabon not fluffed several scoring chances. Algerian Riyad Mahrez, who succeeded Aubameyang as African Footballer of the Year, made an impressive but goalless home debut for Manchester City in a 6-1 rout of Huddersfield. ALEX IWOBI (Arsenal) Iwobi scored with a clinical close-range finish, but missed a chance to put the Gunners ahead and Chelsea took full advantage. Marcos Alonso's late winner left Arsenal to rue a second successive defeat under new boss Unai Emery. PIERRE-EMERICK AUBAMEYANG (Arsenal) The striker endured a dismal afternoon at Stamford Bridge as his misses contributed to Arsenal's defeat. Aubameyang should have equalised after Chelsea's opening goal, but fluffed his lines with a woeful close-range miss. After Arsenal had battled back to 2-2 from two goals down, Aubameyang misfired again from close-range. RIYAD MAHREZ (Manchester City) The Algeria winger made his home debut for the Premier League champions in their demolition of Huddersfield. Mahrez arrived from Leicester in a £60 million (67 million euros, $76.5 million) move in the close season and made his first appearance in the Community Shield win over Chelsea at Wembley. Mahrez finally got to play in front of the City faithful at Eastlands when he came off the bench as a 64th-minute substitute against Huddersfield. Although he did not get on the scoresheet, he impressed for dominant City. MUBARAK WAKASO/PATRICK TWUMASI (Alaves) Ghana internationals Wakaso and Twumasi were both in the squad for Alaves' tricky trip to Barcelona for the La Liga season opener. Wakaso was part of a four-man midfield as the visitors attempted to snuff out Barcelona's attacking threat and it worked for over an hour until Lionel Messi inspired a 3-0 win. Wakaso had one shot blocked while winger Twumasi, signed from Astana, had to watch from the bench as an unused substitute. SEKO FOFANA (Udinese) Ivorian midfielder Fofana got his first goal of the season, scoring the equaliser as Udinese completed a comeback from two goals down to draw 2-2 at promoted Parma. Fofana, 23, scored four minutes after teammate Rodrigo De Paul had pulled the northeastern side, who narrowly avoided relegation last season, back into the game. It was his ninth league goal in his third season with the club. KWADWO ASAMOAH (Inter Milan) Ghana midfielder Asamoah began life as an Inter Milan player with a 1-0 defeat to Sassuolo after six years at Turin giants Juventus. The 29-year-old had appeals for a spot-kick waved away after being brought down by Francesco Magnanelli. KEVIN-PRINCE BOATENG (Sassuolo) Boateng played an important role in his new centre-forward role after moving to Sassuolo from Germany during the close season. ""Proud of my team and so happy to be back,"" tweeted the 31-year-old former AC Milan player after the win over Inter Milan. Boateng thought he had made it 2-0 for the side from Modena after 65 minutes but his effort bounced off the post. DENIS BOUANGA (Nimes) The Le Mans-born Gabon winger scored his first goal for Nimes since arriving from Lorient last month and the first for his new employers in the top flight at home since 1993 in the 3-1 defeat of Marseille. He also had a decisive role in the counter-attack that led to the second goal."
19,19/08/2018,14:21,Messi 'sees things others don't' says Barcelona coach,Barcelona coach Ernesto Valverde has heaped praise on Lionel Messi's start to the Liga season after the Argentine bounced back from a disappointing World Cup with two goals against Alaves.,"Messi sent an audacious second-half free-kick under the jumping wall and into the net for the opener, and Barca's 6,000th La Liga goal, at the Camp Nou on Saturday before slotting in his second in injury-time after Philippe Coutinho had also scored in the 3-0 win. ""With Messi, you can expect absolutely anything,"" Valverde said. ""He sees things that others don't see on the pitch. ""Sometimes we get too used to seeing it, he does things like he did today and we want him to pull a rabbit of the hat every time. ""He's a genius and we're lucky to be able to see him play every day."" Messi has been left out of Argentina's squad for the first post-World Cup friendlies following reports that the five-time Ballon d'Or winner asked to be excused from the four games. He was unable to prevent a shambolic Argentina side from being knocked out of the World Cup in the last 16 stage in a 4-3 defeat to eventual winners France."
20,19/08/2018,00:25,"Messi, Coutinho get Barcelona off to winning start",Two goals from Lionel Messi either side of a Philippe Coutinho strike allowed Barcelona to start their defence of the Spanish title with a 3-0 win over Alaves at the Camp Nou on Saturday night.,"Wearing the captain's armband following the departure of Andres Iniesta to Japan, Messi stepped up to send a cheeky second-half free-kick under the jumping wall and into the net for the opener, and Barca's 6,000th La Liga goal. Coutinho, who had come off the bench, lashed in the second goal before Messi added gloss to the scoreline in stoppage time, with the clock having ticked past midnight in Catalonia. While they took their time to get going, it was an ideal opening result for Ernesto Valverde's side, who are hoping to once again see off the challenges of Real Madrid and Atletico Madrid in the battle for the title. While Cristiano Ronaldo has left Real for Juventus, Messi remains as the figurehead at Barcelona and he won his 33rd trophy with the club in the Spanish Super Cup victory over Sevilla last weekend. The 31-year-old will be aiming to put behind him the desperate disappointment that was Argentina's World Cup campaign, and he was unlucky not to get a hat-trick here. Messi saw a free-kick crash back off the bar late in the first half after going over the wall, so when he was handed another chance from a similar position in the 64th minute, he changed tack. This time, 22 yards out, he surprised the jumping Alaves defenders by going underneath and giving Fernando Pacheco in goal no chance. He then sent another curling effort off the post soon after. Coutinho started the match on the bench alongside summer signings Arthur, Malcom, Clement Lenglet and Arturo Vidal. However, he was sent on at the start of the second half and his goal seven minutes from the end effectively killed the game. The Brazilian had just squandered one chance after being played in by Messi when he picked up a pass from compatriot Arthur before lashing in, ensuring victory on the opening weekend for Barca for the 10th consecutive season. Messi, the top scorer in La Liga last season, then controlled a ball into the box on his chest before slotting in his second and his team's third in stoppage time. After the departures of Ronaldo and Zinedine Zidane, Real play their first league game under new coach Julen Lopetegui on Sunday night when they entertain near neighbours Getafe. Last season's runners-up Atletico, fresh from beating Real 4-2 after extra time in the UEFA Super Cup in Tallinn in midweek, start at Valencia on Monday. Elsewhere on Saturday, former Arsenal midfielder Santi Cazorla played his first competitive game in almost two years following a nightmare time with injuries. The 77-times capped Spanish international, who is now 33, suffered a serious Achilles injury playing for Arsenal in the Champions League in October 2016. After eight operations, the little attacking midfielder suffered a serious infection in the tendon that almost led to an amputation. But he fought back and recently returned to Villarreal, seven years after his departure for Malaga. Cazorla started in Villarreal's season-opener at home to Real Sociedad, as his side took a first-half lead through Gerard Moreno. However, the visitors fought back to win 2-1 with goals from Willian Jose and Juanmi, giving the Basque club's new coach Asier Garitano the perfect start. The other winners so far on the opening weekend are Levante, who triumphed 3-0 at Betis on Friday."

22,22/04/2018,21:14,Las Palmas relegated from La Liga after Alaves hammering,Las Palmas had their relegation from La Liga confirmed on Sunday following an emphatic 4-0 defeat at home to Alaves.,"The club from Gran Canaria needed a win to keep alive their slim hopes of staying in Spain's top flight for a fourth straight season. However, they suffered a fifth successive defeat in front of a sparse crowd on a wet Sunday in the Canary Islands, with Barcelona loanee Munir El Haddadi's second-half brace having Alaves in control before Alvaro Medran and Ruben Sobrino added late goals. The appointment of Paco Jemez as coach midway through the season failed to improve the fortunes of the struggling side, who have now gone 12 games without a win. They are the second team to be relegated from La Liga after bottom club Malaga's fate was sealed in midweek."
23,17/03/2018,23:06,"Rodrigo, Zaza send Valencia third in Spain",Rodrigo and Simone Zaza scored for Valencia in a 3-1 win over Alaves on Saturday that lifted them above defending champions Real Madrid and into third place in La Liga.,"Italy international Zaza teed up Rodrigo to open the scoring on 19 minutes at Mestalla as the latter found the net for the fourth time in three games. Zaza doubled the advantage just past the half hour when he bundled in a cross for his 12th goal of the season, but Ruben Sobrino cut the deficit for Alaves early in the second half. An own goal from centre-back Victor Laguardia on 54 minutes sealed a sixth league win in seven for Marcelino's Valencia, who climbed two points above Real ahead of their home game against Girona on Sunday. ""The team played well, an extraordinary first half, then the goal just as the second half began gave us some doubts in defence, but we recovered quickly with the third,"" said Marcelino. Real Betis climbed to within a point of a potential Europa League spot with a 3-0 home win over Espanyol, while Getafe are one point further back after coming from behind to claim a 2-1 victory at Real Sociedad. Deportivo La Coruna and Las Palmas remain mired in deep trouble in the relegation zone following a 1-1 draw. Former Barcelona starlet Alen Halilovic fired Las Palmas ahead after just three minutes in northwest Spain, but hosts Deportivo levelled through Raul Albentosa. The result favoured neither side with Deportivo's winless run stretching to 14 matches and leaving them seven points from safety, while Las Palmas are six points adrift of 17th-placed Levante. Leaders Barcelona host Athletic Bilbao on Sunday as second-placed Atletico Madrid, who are eight points behind, travel to Villarreal. Sevilla, fresh off their shock elimination of Manchester United in the Champions League last 16, return to domestic duty away to Leganes."
24,23/02/2018,02:05,Bale blues cloud Real Madrid's return to form,"Talk of a crisis at Real Madrid is over for now, but the form of Gareth Bale remains a cause of concern ahead of this weekend's meeting with Alaves in La Liga.","The Welshman was back on the bench for Wednesday's 3-1 victory at Leganes, his involvement restricted to a late cameo as Zinedine Zidane's side claimed a fourth consecutive win. Bale had started in last weekend's 5-3 success at Betis but failed to impress, having also been left out of the line-up for the 3-1 Champions League win against Paris Saint-Germain. He has not completed 90 minutes since September due to injury and poor form, and the Madrid media appear to have made their minds up -- ""Bale's credit has run out"", said the headline in one piece in sports daily Marca on Thursday. When Zidane was asked if Bale had been left out in Leganes to protect him, the Frenchman's response hinted all is not well. ""It was a little bit of everything. I am happy with Gareth, but we need to go little by little with him,"" he said. ""We want him to find his best form, then we'll see what we do in the coming games. We are playing well at the moment and I am going to need everyone."" Cristiano Ronaldo was rested at Leganes but could return as Madrid look to extend a run that has seen them take 16 points from a possible 18. That form has lifted them into the top three, although they remain 14 points behind leaders Barcelona. ""I never look back the way. Now we have recovered third place, we need to keep going until we get second and on until the end,"" added Zidane, who nevertheless has considerable selection issues. Sergio Ramos is suspended against Alaves, while Marcelo, Toni Kroos and Luka Modric are all fighting to shake off injuries ahead of the PSG second leg on March 6. Alaves could be dangerous opponents too, thanks to a stunning turnaround under new coach Abelardo that has lifted them 10 points clear of the relegation zone. Following their 1-1 Champions League draw at Chelsea, Barcelona host Girona looking to extend their unbeaten run in La Liga to 32 matches. That would be a new club record, after their 2-0 win at Eibar last weekend saw them match the previous mark of 31 games set under Pep Guardiola in 2010/11. Seven points behind Barcelona in second, Atletico Madrid face a tough trip to Sevilla, who were unfortunate not to beat Manchester United in the Champions League in midweek. Saturday's Catalan derby at the Camp Nou will see two Uruguayan strikers in prolific form go up against one another. Barca's Luis Suarez has scored 17 La Liga goals this season, with 14 in his last 13 games. Meanwhile, his compatriot Stuani -- his first name is indeed written that way -- is in the form of his life at Girona since returning to Spain from Middlesbrough. The 31-year-old ex-Espanyol player has 13 in 20 La Liga appearances this season, including one in last week's win over Leganes. He has formed a fine partnership in the newly-promoted side's attack with nine-goal Portu. Stuani and Suarez have been joined by another Uruguayan, Celta Vigo's 12-goal Maxi Gomez, near the top of the scorers' charts. ""Seeing so many Uruguayans up there is very important for us, a source of pride,"" Stuani said this week. Fixtures (all kick-offs GMT)"
25,10/02/2018,15:04,Villarreal miss chance to put pressure on Real Madrid,"Villarreal squandered an opportunity to climb above Real Madrid in La Liga, for a few hours at least, as they lost 2-1 at home to Alaves on Saturday.","The visitors were seeking to continue their improvement since former Barcelona and Spain defender Abelardo was appointed coach in December. They went in front six minutes before half-time when Alfonso Pedraza returned the ball into the box and Rodrigo Ely nodded home. Pedraza, who is on loan from Villarreal, missed a glorious chance to double the away side's lead early in the second half. However, John Guidetti set up substitute Ibai Gomez to make it 2-0 in the 71st minute. Carlos Bacca pulled one back for the hosts at the Estadio de la Ceramica with the aid of a huge deflection, but Villarreal could not find an equaliser, with Enes Unal hitting the bar late on. Villarreal's second straight defeat leaves them fifth in the table, two points behind Real Madrid in fourth, having played two games more. Zinedine Zidane's side entertain Real Sociedad later on Saturday. Villarreal face Lyon in the Europa League next week."
26,28/01/2018,23:47,Messi strikes late to down tough Alaves,Barcelona escaped a scare on Philippe Coutinho's first start as Lionel Messi struck with a trademark free-kick to drag the La Liga leaders back from a goal down to beat Alaves 2-1 and restore their 11-point lead at the top.,"Messi whipped home a beautiful free-kick six minutes from the end to down resilient Alaves, who are just two points from the drop zone in 17th despite John Guidetti silencing the Camp Nou with a shock breakaway opener in the 23rd minute. Luis Suarez had broken the away side's tough resistence with a sweet volley from Andres Iniesta's cross 18 minutes from the end, setting the stage for Messi's dramatic and stylish winner. The Argentine's strike ensures that Barca stay unbeaten in the league, and keeps Atletico Madrid 11 points back despite their 3-0 hammering of Las Palmas earlier. Barca coach Ernesto Valverdes said he was happy with Coutinho who had started Thursday's Copa del Rey clash with Valencia on the bench before making a second-half appearance. ""Players are not machines who can fit in at once, like a new part,"" said Valverde. ""He did well, he wanted the ball. This is one more step for him. The other day, he played 25 minutes, this time a little more, he will integrate little by little."" With Diego Costa out injured, Atletico took a while to get going and had to wait until the 61st minute to open the scoring, Antoine Griezmann latching on to Juanfran's fine ball down the right flank before dinking neatly over Las Palmas stopper Leandro Chichizola. ""The first half was not very good but the coach gave us a good talking to at half-time, and we responded well,"" said Griezmann, whose goal was just his seventh in the league this season but his fourth in league and cup since the turn of the year. ""I feel good, I've started the year well and I hope to continue the goals and assists."" Frenchman Griezmann started the move that led to Atletico's second, intercepting a loose pass and setting Angel Correa free to scamper down the pitch and feed Fernando Torres, who shifted the ball onto his right foot and lashed home just his second goal of the season, the 600th scored by Atletico in all competitions during Diego Simeone's seven-year reign as coach. An easy tap-in from Thomas Partey after great work from Yannick Carrasco two minutes from time completed the second-half rout of a desperate Las Palmas, who remain second from bottom and five points from safety. Sevilla were denied the chance to close within three points of Real Madrid and the Champions league places after Angel Rodriguez scored a controversial equaliser deep in stoppage time to snatch a 1-1 draw for Getafe at the Roman Sanchez Pizjaun stadium. Luis Muriel had slid in a 72nd-minute opener for hosts but with seconds to spare Juan Cala challenged Sevilla keeper Sergio Rico for a hopeful high ball, and with the Sevilla fans and players clamouring for a free-kick, Angel lashed home the leveller and celebrated under a hail of whistles and boos."
