0,24/01/2021,23:17,Suarez strikes again as Atletico march on with Valencia win,Luis Suarez scored a brilliant team goal as Atletico Madrid came from behind to beat Valencia 3-1 on Sunday and move seven points clear at the top of La Liga.,"After Real Madrid thrashed Alaves on Saturday, Barca had earlier followed suit with a scrappy victory over Elche. But Atletico were undeterred in the capital, as their considerable advantage was restored again, with a game in hand. ""We don't get carried away or think too far ahead, we think about getting better,"" said Atletico coach Diego Simeone. Suarez finished off a flowing move that had started almost on Atletico's goal-line before substitute Angel Correa capped another slick string of passes to end Valencia's resistance. The visitors had taken an early lead in stunning fashion, Uros Racic curling into the top corner from 35 yards but Joao Felix equalised and Atletico came back, in a way that has begun to feel expected. Felix was replaced by Correa after an hour by Simeone after assisting Suarez and scoring a goal for himself that should send a message to his coach, who has handed the 21-year-old a spell on the bench in recent weeks. ""It's not written that footballers have to play 90 minutes,"" said Simeone. ""Joao scored a goal, made an assist, he came off and on came Correa, who scored a goal and was close to another. The competition is healthy."" Simeone knows the pressure will mount as the La Liga trophy comes more into view, yet his team are showing an assuredness now that is offering little encouragement for Barcelona and Real Madrid. They had hope when Valencia took the lead on 11 minutes, Racic running onto Jose Gaya's pass and wrapping his left foot around the ball to send it bending into the top right-hand corner. He celebrated by seeking out his under-pressure coach Javi Gracia, but the advantage was short-lived as Felix stabbed in on the volley at the back post after holding off his marker Thierry Correia from a corner. With the more attacking Renan Lodi and Yannick Carrasco playing left and right wing-back in the second half, Atletico opened up Valencia twice with two superb, sweeping moves. The first started in their own right corner with Stefan Savic, the ball played across the back and into midfield where Mario Hermoso drove a searching pass forward to Felix on the left. He slipped in Suarez, who opened his body and finished from the angle. It was no fluke because the third goal was almost as good, some slick passing through midfield freeing Marcos Llorente down the right and he pulled back for Correa to sidefoot in. Barcelona won again without the suspended Lionel Messi as goals from Frenkie de Jong and Riqui Puig were enough to secure a scruffy 2-0 win over Elche. De Jong poked the ball over the line just before half-time at the Martinez Valero, which would have proved a suitably scrappy winner before Puig came off the bench to head in a second late on. Despite an uninspiring performance, Ronald Koeman will be relieved to see Barca make it two consecutive victories without Messi and since their loss in the Spanish Super Cup final last weekend to Athletic Bilbao, after an extra-time Copa del Rey victory over Cornella in midweek. Messi is still serving his punishment for being sent off in Seville but the Argentinian will be available again for Wednesday's cup tie at Rayo Vallecano. In his absence, De Jong stepped up, continuing his own resurgence in recent weeks with one of the simplest goals he will ever score and then an assist, following a more impressive run and cross for Puig. ""We are better this year. We've had to play all our games away and in La Liga we have won all of them so I think we have done well,"" said De Jong. ""For me, playing better is not just about goals and assists but I'm happy of course to score and assist today."""
1,19/12/2020,17:22,Messi equals Pele's record of goals for a single club,Lionel Messi scored his 643rd goal for Barcelona on Saturday to equal Pele's record of goals for a single club as the Spanish giants were held 2-2 by Valencia.,"Messi headed in from Jordi Alba's cross after his first-half penalty was saved to equal the mark set by the Brazilian great for Santos. But Messi was left frustrated as a dogged Valencia forced a draw that leaves Barcelona eight points behind leaders Atletico Madrid, who beat Elche 3-1 earlier in the day. Barcelona started slowly and went a goal behind to Mouctar Diakhaby's unchallenged header from a corner after half an hour. Antoine Griezmann earned the penalty that led to Messi's record-equalling goal when the Frenchman was nudged over by Jose Gaya. Messi's spot-kick was saved by Jaume Domenech but the ball rebounded and from Alba's dinked cross, the Argentine headed the ball into the net to draw level with Pele. Barcelona went ahead thanks to a superb scissor kick from Uruguayan Ronald Araujo. But Valencia's pressure was rewarded when Maxi Gomez got in front of Barca central defender Oscar Mingueza to turn in a cross and equalise. Philippe Coutinho drove a shot just wide with 12 minutes remaining and Messi curled a free-kick wide but Barcelona were forced to share the points."
2,28/11/2020,19:42,Atletico beat Valencia to move level with leaders Sociedad,Atletico Madrid moved level with La Liga leaders Real Sociedad on Saturday after edging a tight contest at Valencia 1-0 that extends their domestic winning streak to six matches.,"Diego Simeone's side stay second but are equal on 23 points with Sociedad with a game in hand on the leaders thanks to Toni Lato's own goal 11 minutes from time. Stingy Atletico have conceded just twice in their nine league matches so far this season and have only scored two less than La Liga top scorers Sociedad, who host third-placed Villarreal on Sunday. ""We have made huge progress since April, since that wonderful match at Liverpool,"" said Simeone, referring to the Champions League last 16 tie his team won 4-2 on aggregate. ""The return to La Liga (after the first lockdown) was very good and the team was already starting to show encouraging signs. This is the result of the progression of all of the players."" Simeone offered a round of applause to his former teammate and friend Diego Maradona following the iconic Argentine's death on Wednesday, while both teams held a minute's silence before kick-off. Atleti's win at the Mestalla puts them four ahead of Villarreal and six in front of reigning champions Real Madrid, who face Alaves in Saturday's late match. It came without a host of absences, including Luis Suarez following the striker's positive Covid-19 test earlier this month, and Simeone said he would have an update on the Uruguayan's condition on Sunday. ""I spoke with him (Suarez) on the phone, he really wants to come back. The team needs him, and I hope he will come back in the best possible way,"" said Simeone. Fellow traditional title rivals Barcelona are 12 points back in 13th place, although they host Osasuna in Sunday's early match and will still have two games in hand on Sociedad come the end of the weekend. Atletico will face European champions Bayern Munich in the Champions League on Tuesday hoping to reach the knockout stages with a match to spare. In the early match, newly-promoted Elche and Cadiz shared the spoils in a 1-1 draw which continues their surprise starts to the season."
3,03/11/2020,14:30,Atletico sign Kondogbia from Valencia,"Atletico Madrid have signed midfielder Geoffrey Kondogbia from Valencia, the two clubs announced on Tuesday.","Kondogbia, who has played internationally for France and the Central African Republic, has signed a contract until 2024, Atletico said in a statement. La Liga rules allowed Atletico to buy outside the transfer window after Arsenal activated Thomas Partey's 50 million euro ($58 million) release clause on the last day of the summer transfer window. Kondogbia will cost Atletico around 10 million euros, according to reports in the Spanish press, with a further 2 million euros due in variables. Valencia will also take 10 per cent of any future sale. ""A talented and strong midfielder joins Atletico Madrid,"" the club said. ""His physical presence, defensive solidity and striking ability from distance make him an all-round player in central midfield."" Thomas had been one of Atletico's most important players but the club have attempted to fill the void with the signing of Kondogbia, as well as Arsenal's Lucas Torreira who joined on loan. Valencia, though, will not be able to replace Kondogbia and letting the 27-year-old go continues the club's drastic selling policy, which has been hugely unpopular with the fans. In a statement issued in August, Valencia owner Peter Lim said: ""We need to reduce the cost of our team. First, for the obvious reason that we are not in the Champions League. We only have La Liga in which to compete, and we will need fewer players."" ""A bankrupt club is not a better club,"" he added. Valencia's new coach Javi Gracia has already complained publicly about the club failing to replace players sold and the team have endured a poor start to the season in La Liga, sitting 13th, three points above the relegation places. A brief statement, titled 'So Long, Geoffrey Kondogbia' on social media, read: ""Valencia CF have formalised an agreement with Atletico Madrid for the permanent transfer of Geoffrey Kondogbia."""
4,18/10/2020,20:59,Parejo sinks former club Valencia as Villarreal go top,"Dani Parejo came back to haunt Valencia on Sunday by scoring the winner in a 2-1 victory for Villarreal, who moved to the top of La Liga.","After making 363 appearances for Valencia, many of them as captain, Parejo was one of a handful of key players allowed to leave the club in the summer. His deflected shot in the 69th minute was a reminder of what they were missing as Villarreal held on to go one point above Real Madrid. Despite a 4-0 thrashing at the hands of Barcelona last month, it has been an encouraging start for Unai Emery, who was appointed coach of Villarreal in July. They have 11 points from their first six games and lead the table after capitalising on inconsistent starts for La Liga's title favourites. Madrid and Barca lost to Cadiz and Getafe respectively on Saturday. Valencia sit 12th, having won just once in their last five matches, with the future of coach Javi Gracia still uncertain. Gracia was critical of the club after Valencia sold the likes of Parejo and Francis Coquelin to Villarreal, as well as Rodrigo and Ferran Torres to Leeds and Manchester City but failed to make a single addition in the summer transfer window. Emery was also once at Valencia and so was Villarreal's Paco Alcacer, who opened the scoring with a penalty before Goncalo Guedes levelled shortly before half-time. Yet Parejo had the last word, receiving a pass from Takefusa Kubo and curling in after his shot deflected off Mouctar Diakhaby. Villarreal had to play the last few minutes with 10 men, with Kubo sent off in the 90th minute after coming on in the 64th."
5,29/09/2020,21:45,Valencia edge Real Sociedad to go top in Spain,Valencia opened the fourth round of Liga matches on Tuesday with a 1-0 away win at Real Sociedad to move to the top of the Spanish table.,"Real Sociedad would also have gone top with a victory and while they dominating play were however frustrated by an impressive display from the visiting goalkeeper Jaume Domenech. The hosts lost their fluency after changing four attacking players in a mass switch in the 67th minute. Maxi Gomez finished off a rare Valencia counter-attack to score the winning goal from close range after 75 minutes. Valencia had been under pressure after a draw at home to Huesca on Saturday came on the back of a surprise loss away at Celta Vigo. New coach Javi Gracia has already expressed disappointment with the club's summer transfer dealings. But his side now top the standings with seven points after four games albeit with five teams in action this week who are within three points, including Real Madrid who welcome Valladolid on Thursday. The midweek round ends with Celta, who could also end up in first place, hosting Barcelona, who have only played one match, on Thursday."
6,13/09/2020,23:20,Valencia fight back to win six-goal thriller against Levante,"Valencia twice came from behind to beat local rivals Levante 4-2 on Sunday, a welcome boost to morale following a turbulent summer for the club.","Manu Vallejo scored the decisive late goals in a goal-fest at Mestalla after Jose Luis Morales's double for Levante had been cancelled out by Gabriel Paulista and the excellent Maxi Gomez. The victory was Javi Gracia's first since being appointed Valencia coach in July and gets the team off to a positive start in La Liga, despite simmering tensions off the pitch. Manuel Pellegrini also enjoyed a successful start in charge of Real Betis after they won 1-0 away at Alaves. But Unai Emery's first game as coach of Villarreal ended in a 1-1 draw at home to newly-promoted Huesca. Valencia would hope to be challenging the likes of Villarreal for a place in the top four this season but several key players have been sold, with unpopular owner Peter Lim determined to improve the club's financial situation. Gracia said on Friday he felt ""sad"" because the squad had been ""weakened"", a brave move given the board's impatience with previous coaches. Yet this was a gutsy performance that Gracia could have been proud of, even if Valencia were behind after just 37 seconds, Morales weaving his way through four defenders before poking in. Gabriel pulled Valencia level when his header crept inside the near post from a corner but Levante scored again, Morales driving into the top corner after more sloppy Valencia defending. But Valencia came back again, Maxi sliding a shot into the far corner and then Yunus Musah, the 17-year-old who left Arsenal's academy last year, clipped the crossbar with a shot in the second half. Valencia looked more likely to snatch a third and Vallejo kept a cool head when it mattered, tucking a finish into the corner after a smart dummy by Maxi. There was time even for a fourth in injury-time as Maxi pulled clear on the break and when his shot cannoned back off the post, Vallejo was perfectly placed."
7,12/08/2020,14:49,Ex-Arsenal midfielder Coquelin leaves Valencia for Villareal,"Former Arsenal midfielder Francis Coquelin has joined Villarreal from Valencia on a four-year deal, both Spanish clubs announced on Wednesday.","Local media reported the deal for the 29-year-old, who left the Premier League side in 2018 after a decade-long spell, is worth eight million euros ($9.42 million). Villarreal will feature in next season's Europa League under the guidance of former Sevilla and Paris Saint-Germain coach Unai Emery. Coquelin was part of the Valencia team that finished ninth in La Liga after a miserable season for the club, during which supporters grew increasingly disillusioned with the ownership of Singaporean businessman Peter Lim."
8,11/08/2020,15:32,"Valencia, Espanyol, Mallorca confirm positive tests for coronavirus","Valencia, Espanyol and Real Mallorca all reported positive cases for coronavirus on Tuesday, as Spanish clubs begin returning for pre-season.","Valencia confirmed two individuals have been infected while tests at Espanyol and Mallorca, who have both been relegated to the second division, revealed one positive case each. The identities of the individuals have been kept anonymous. They are all isolating at home and the Spanish health authorities have been notified.

11,04/08/2020,21:15,Manchester City sign winger Ferran Torres from Valencia,Manchester City have announced the signing of Valencia winger Ferran Torres on a five-year deal as Pep Guardiola looks to bolster his attacking options.,"The 20-year-old Spaniard, City's first signing of the summer transfer window, has penned a five-year contract for a reported initial fee of £20.9 million ($27 million). ""I am so happy to be joining City,"" Torres told the Premier League club's website. ""Every player wants to be involved in attacking teams and Manchester City are one of the most attacking in world football. ""Pep encourages a really open, aggressive style, which I love, and he is a manager with a proven track record of improving players. To have him overseeing my development is a dream."" Guardiola is keen to strengthen his squad following the loss of their Premier League title to Liverpool -- they have also agreed a £41 million fee for Bournemouth defender Nathan Ake. ""We have followed Ferran's progress closely and have been very impressed,"" said City director of football Txiki Begiristain. ""He is young and still developing, but his technical qualities are exactly what we are looking for in a winger. He is quick, direct, can create space with one movement and is capable of producing match-winning moments."" Torres can play on either wing and operate through the middle, with pace and an ability to beat players his main attributes. He made 44 appearances for Valencia last season, scoring six goals. Valencia tweeted: ""You arrived at our Academy at 7 years old. We have been by your side through all this time seeing you grow as a footballer and as a person. At this point you have decided to separate our paths. @FerranTorres20 , we wish you the best with @ManCity."" Two-time defending champions City finished 18 points behind Jurgen Klopp's Liverpool, who were crowned champions in June after a three-month hiatus due to the coronavirus."
12,27/07/2020,20:03,Valencia name Gracia as new coach,"Valencia have appointed former Watford and Malaga boss Javi Gracia as their new coach on a two-year deal, the La Liga club announced on Monday.","The 50-year-old becomes Valencia's third full-time manager since the start of the recently-concluded La Liga season, after the sackings of Marcelino in September 2019 and Albert Celades last month. ""Valencia CF have reached an agreement with Javi Gracia, who has been appointed as first team coach as of Monday, on a two-year deal through to June 30, 2022,"" the club said in a brief statement. Gracia was dismissed by Watford, who were relegated from the English Premier League on Sunday, last September after a poor start to the campaign, just four months after taking the Hornets to only the second FA Cup final in their history, where they lost 6-0 to Manchester City. His list of former teams also includes Russian outfit Rubin Kazan and Spanish sides Malaga, Osasuna and Almeria. Valencia finished ninth in La Liga this season, missing out on qualification for Europe, and were knocked out of the Champions League in the last 16 by Italian club Atalanta."
13,05/07/2020,00:26,Valencia pegged back by late Granada equaliser,Valencia's disappointing end to the season continued on Saturday as they conceded an 86th-minute equaliser to draw 2-2 away at Granada in La Liga.,"Three goals in seven second-half minutes sparked a thrilling contest at Los Carmenes and Valencia had the better of them, with Manu Vallejo and Goncalo Guedes overturning Carlos Fernandez's penalty for Granada. But Fede Vico's late free-kick found its way through a gap in the Valencia wall to salvage a deserved point for Granada, who stay level on points with their opponents after only being promoted last season. Valencia are still searching for their first victory since sacking coach Albert Celades on Tuesday. Voro Gonzalez, in his sixth spell in temporary charge, oversaw defeat on Wednesday by Athletic Bilbao. One win in seven games since La Liga restarted on June 11 have extinguished Valencia's hopes of qualifying for the Champions League but even making the Europa League next season looks increasingly unlikely. They sit ninth, five points adrift of Getafe in sixth, having played a game more. Granada are one place below in 10th. The home side took the lead in the 61st minute, winning a penalty after Fernandez beat Francis Coquelin to a pull-back to the edge of the area. Fernandez scored the penalty but Granada's lead lasted only two minutes, Vallejo latching on to Denis Cheryshev's lifted pass through and whipping the ball first time into the corner. Five minutes later, Valencia pulled ahead in stunning fashion as Guedes' rocket from 25 yards flew into the top corner off the hand of Rui Silva. But Granada hit back again, Vico's driven free-kick flying through a gap in the middle of Valencia's wall with four minutes left. Roberto Soldado could have won it for Granada in injury-time but Jasper Cillessen made the stop. Earlier, Celta Vigo's emergency signing Nolito scored his second goal since returning to the club last month but it was not enough for victory against Real Betis. Nolito's free-kick set Celta up for a valuable home victory at Balaidos only for Zouhair Feddal to smash in a Betis equaliser 11 minutes from the end to seal a 1-1 draw. It represents a missed opportunity for Celta to move further away from the relegation zone but they should still have enough for survival. They sit 17th, six points ahead of Real Mallorca, with four games left. Betis will be satisfied with a point too as they are now nine points clear of the bottom three. Valladolid climbed a point above Betis after they beat Alaves 1-0, Fernandez Moreno grabbing an 88th-minute winner to all-but guarantee their safety."
14,29/06/2020,22:22,Valencia sack coach Celades after Villarreal loss,Valencia fired coach Albert Celades on Monday after a run of bad results culminated with a defeat by the La Liga club's bitter local rivals Villarreal at the weekend.,"Valencia have picked up a meagre four points from a possible 15 since the restart following the coronavirus lockdown, dropping to eighth in the league, eight points off the Champions League qualifying spots. ""Valencia have informed Albert Celades of his immediate release,"" a club statement said. Former caretaker coach Voro has been called in again as a temporary replacement for the sixth time. Celades took over at the Mestalla last September after the surprise sacking of previous boss Marcelino, who had led the club to back-to-back fourth-placed finishes. But Celades has failed to last the season after Sunday's 2-0 loss at Villarreal left Valencia with just two wins in 13 matches in all competitions. Valencia were also knocked out of the Champions League by Atalanta in March after an 8-4 aggregate defeat in the last 16."
15,25/06/2020,22:01,"Valencia top-four bid ""impossible"" after Eibar defeat",Valencia's chances of making La Liga's top four appear to be over after they were beaten 1-0 away at relegation battlers Eibar on Thursday.,"Geoffrey Kondogbia's own-goal after 16 minutes gave Eibar the lead at Ipurua, where they were the better side in a victory that could prove crucial to their survival. Valencia could have no complaints and defeat leaves them eighth in the table, seven points adrift of Sevilla in fourth. Since La Liga restarted, they have won only once in four matches. They squeezed into the Champions League last year on the final day of the season but another rescue act looks unlikely, with defender Jose Luis Gaya admitting after the game that finishing in the top four feels ""impossible"". ""We knew what to expect here on this pitch, we knew once Eibar get in front it's very difficult,"" Gaya said. ""It feels impossible to qualify for the Champions League now. ""We're far behind and it's going to be very hard now to recover. It's very difficult, we're really frustrated because we haven't taken our opportunity."" Victory for Eibar moves them six points clear of Real Mallorca in the relegation zone, a significant advantage even with seven games still to play. After restarting with a loss and two draws, Eibar had been sucked into the battle at the bottom but this win puts them in a strong position to guarantee top-flight status for a seventh consecutive year. Their goal was fortunate as Valencia failed to clear a routine corner and as Kondogbia turned his back the ball rebounded off his leg and flew in. ""We weren't playing well before,"" said Eibar's Pedro Leon. ""We had a lost a bit of rhythm but now we feel like we're on the right path again."""
16,21/06/2020,22:19,Guedes shines as Valencia keep top four hopes alive,Goncalo Guedes scored a mesmerising solo goal as Valencia stayed in touch with the Champions League qualification places by beating Osasuna 2-0 on Sunday.,"Guedes picked the ball up in his own half and surged past four Osasuna players before completing his stunning run with a driven shot into the top corner. Rodrigo Moreno made it two at Mestalla and while Osasuna had chances in the second half, Valencia secured a comfortable win to keep their fading hopes alive of finishing in the top four. Valencia stay eighth but reduce the gap behind Sevilla in the last Champions League spot to six points. Osasuna, who were expected to be among the teams most affected by empty stadiums given their passionate local support, drop to 12th. They have now taken just one point from their three matches since the restart, this defeat coming on the back of a 5-0 loss at home to Atletico Madrid. Games against Alaves, Leganes and Eibar - opponents all currently beneath them in the table - should decide whether they get dragged into a relegation scrap during the run-in. Osasuna might wonder how Guedes managed to carry the ball through two thirds of the pitch without being stopped but the Portuguese should take full credit for what is surely a contender for goal of the season. After a superb first year on loan from Paris Saint-Germain, Valencia paid 40 million euros to sign Guedes permanently in 2018 but the 23-year-old has struggled to deliver on his early promise. Yet this was a timely reminder of what his talent, a fabulous goal coming before a pin-point pass that allowed Rodrigo to make it two. Guedes' moment came after he intercepted Inigo Perez's cross-field ball and began driving forward. He advanced over the half-way line before slaloming around Oier, tumbling past Unai Garcia but getting up quick to nick the ball ahead of Raul Navas. Into the penalty area, Guedes finally cut inside David Garcia before dummying a shot and then curling into the net. Guedes turned provider soon after, collecting a poor pass from David Garcia and setting free Rodrigo, who prodded home his second goal in three games. Osasuna's next opponents will be Alaves, who earlier suffered a crushing 6-0 defeat away at fellow strugglers Celta Vigo. Alaves were reduced to 10 men after 27 minutes when Martin Aguirregabiria was sent off and Celta capitalised, scoring four in the first half and adding two more late on."
17,19/06/2020,01:08,Benzema and Asensio volleys fire Madrid to Valencia victory,Karim Benzema's volley could well be La Liga's goal of the season and Marco Asensio's was his first touch in over a year as Real Madrid stormed past Valencia 3-0 on Thursday.,"Two brilliant strikes helped Madrid to a convincing win at the empty Alfredo di Stefano Stadium, where Benzema continued his excellent form with a brace after putting his team in front thanks to another combination with Eden Hazard. Valencia had been the better side in the first half when Rodrigo Moreno hit the post and then had a goal controversially ruled out after referee Jose Sanchez consulted VAR. Yet Madrid found a different gear after the break to carve out an impressive victory that reduces their deficit to two points behind Barcelona, who play away at Sevilla on Friday. Benzema's stunning second goal that saw him take the ball out of the air with one foot and then volley home with the other was a breathtaking moment that came shortly after a dramatic one for Asensio too. Asensio has not played since June 10 last year after suffering an anterior cruciate ligament injury but the 24-year-old announced his return in style, volleying in with his first touch, 31 seconds after coming on. ""It's been many months of hard work and I'm very happy to play again and to score,"" he said afterwards. ""I feel a lot of emotion, satisfaction. A lot of work has gone into this."" ""It means a lot to him,"" said coach Zinedine Zidane. ""We're just happy to see him on the pitch again."" But with nine games to go in the title race, Benzema appears key, particularly as his partnership with the resurgent Hazard continues to flourish. This was his 243rd goal for Real Madrid in all competitions, putting him above Ferenc Puskas into fifth in the club's all-time list. ""Benzema's goal was truly an amazing,"" Zidane said. ""The volley, the way the ball fell, with his left foot...I'm happy for him."" In fact, he twice looked for Hazard in the first half too keenly, the first time on the break when he played back inside with Fede Valverde was free outside him. After a strong start, Madrid faded and Valencia came on strong. They hit the post when Maxi Rodriguez's pass sent Rodrigo clear, his shot was diverted by the fingertips of Thibaut Courtois. Valencia then thought they had scored as Carlos Soler's pass to the back post beat both Maxi and his marker Raphael Varane to find Rodrigo, who tapped in. But VAR persuaded Sanchez that Maxi's heel was offside and also that the ball had feathered his foot on its way through. Rodrigo opened the palms of his hands in disbelief. Benzema tried to nod down for Hazard when he would have been better going for goal but Madrid had lost their purpose and were grateful for half-time. They were better in the second half, with more control. Kevin Gameiro came on for Valencia and his first touch was a costly one, a loose pass to Hazard setting Madrid away. Hazard played a one-two with Luka Modric and pushed the ball across for Benzema to finish. Asensio came on in the 74th minute after a hug and a smile with Zidane. His first touch was a glorious one as Ferland Mendy beat Daniel Wass to the line and chipped a pass back to his teammate, who punched a superb volley into the net with his left foot. An incredible moment could only be surpassed by something special, which Benzema delivered. Asensio crossed and Benzema lifted the ball in the air over Hugo Gillamon with his right foot and then with his left, banged it into the top corner. Valencia were dead and buried and Lee Kang-In was sent off after three frustrated hacks on Sergio Ramos. He departed with one minute left."

Valencia looked to have grabbed a later winner themselves at an empty Mestalla when Rodrigo Moreno diverted in at the near post in the 89th minute. But Mouctar Diakhaby pulled down Ruben Vezo deep into injury-time and Gonzalo Melero made no mistake, equalising for Levante from the spot. The visitors also had Roger Marti sent off for a second yellow card in the 74th minute. Granada, also playing behind closed doors at Los Carmenes, scored in the 70th and 79th minutes as a Djene Dakonam own-goal and Carlos Fernandez's finish wiped out Getafe's lead, given to them in the first half by David Timor. Defeat means Getafe stay fifth, handing Atletico the chance to overtake them if they can win away at Athletic Bilbao on Sunday. Valencia remain seventh, three points of adrift of Real Sociedad, who are at home on Sunday to Osasuna. Granada, who were only promoted last season, move up to eighth, with the Europa League places now in sight while Levante edge up to 12th. La Liga became the second of Europe's five major leagues after the German Bundesliga to resume on Thursday, when Sevilla overcame Real Betis 2-0 in the division's first match since March 10. League leaders Barcelona play away at Real Mallorca on Saturday before Real Madrid, two points behind in second, return at home to Eibar on Sunday."
19,24/03/2020,17:58,Feverish fans fuelled virus at Italy Champion's League match,"Ecstatic fans cheering and hugging at the Champion's League game between Atalanta and Valencia in February boosted the spread of the coronavirus, the mayor of the worst-hit Italian city said Tuesday.","Bergamo, in the northern Lombardy region, is now Italy's worst-hit province, with nearly 6,728 infections. Its football team Atalanta had been having a stellar season, with a historic Champions League qualification. Its game against Spanish rival Valencia on February 19 at the San Siro stadium in Milan had been feverishly awaited by fans. Atalanta pulled off a stunning 4-1 victory -- each goal met with shouts of glee, fans clutching at each other in excitement. Bergamo Mayor Giorgio Gori told foreign journalists the match was ""among the sad explanations"" for the high infection rate in the city and wider province. ""Some 40,000 Bergamo inhabitants went to Milan to watch the game. Others watched it from their homes, in families, in groups, at the bar,"" he said. ""It's clear that evening was a situation in which the virus was widely spread,"" he added. But Gori said he didn't think it was ""the starting point"". Instead he believed Bergamo's troubles began when a patient at the Fenaroli Hospital in Alzano was admitted with coronavirus but it went undetected, allowing him to infect others. Two weeks after the historic match in Milan the curve of the number of those infected in Bergamo began to rise steeply and the town has become the epicentre for the pandemic in Europe. Some 4,178 people have died so far in Lombardy, out of a total of over 6,820 in Italy. Gori said he thought the statistics failed to represent the real toll on Bergamo and the surrounding region because ""there are certainly many elderly people who died at home, without it having been possible to take them to hospital"". ""These people are not included in the official statistics. No tests have been done on them either before or after death"". Spanish club Valencia have said that 35 per cent of their team and staff have tested positive for coronavirus, following the trip to Milan. Atalanta on Tuesday confirmed that goalkeeper Marco Sportiello, who played in Valencia on March 10 as the Italian club qualified for the Champions League quarter-finals, had become their first player to test positive for COVID-19. ""Marco is currently asymptomatic,"" the team said in a statement. ""The preventive quarantine, to which Marco and all the members of the first team had been subjected, will end on March 27."""
20,16/03/2020,23:35,Valencia confirm over third of squad has coronavirus,"Valencia, the first Spanish football club to report coronavirus infections, said Monday that 35 percent of players and staff members have tested positive for the disease.","The club said the virus spread among the squad following last month's trip to Milan, ""an area confirmed as 'high risk' by the Italian authorities days afterwards"", for the first leg of their Champions League last-16 tie against Atalanta. ""Despite the strict measures adopted by the club"" after the match, ""these latest results show that the exposure inherent to such matches has caused a positive test rate of around 35%,"" Valencia said in a statement. ""All cases are asymptomatic and those involved are currently isolated at home, receiving medical assessment and carrying out their scheduled training plan."" On Sunday, Valencia announced that five of the club's players and staff had tested positive for COVID-19, including Argentine defender Ezequiel Garay. Spain is the second worst affected country by the virus in Europe, with more than 9,100 confirmed cases and 309 deaths."
21,15/03/2020,20:36,Atalanta in quarantine after Valencia coronavirus cases,"Atalanta players and staff are self-isolating after five of their Champions League opponents Valencia's players tested positive for coronavirus, the Serie A club announced on Sunday.","Gian Piero Gasperini's side beat Valencia 4-3 at the Mestalla last week to advance to the Champions League quarter-finals 8-4 on aggregate, and Argentina defender Ezequiel Garay is among the La Liga outfit's players to have since tested positive for COVID-19. As a result Atalanta said in a statement they would be ""self-isolating at home in compliance with hygiene rules"". All sports in Italy have been suspended until April 3, but Atalanta had been due to resume training on Monday. They will now be stopped until March 24. On Saturday Atalanta forward Josip Ilicic donated the ball with which he scored all four of his team's goals against Valencia to a hospital in Bergamo, which is at the centre of Italy's coronavirus drama. The northern Lombardy region in which Bergamo is situated has reported 1,218 deaths of the total in Italy of 1,809 -- the most of any nation outside China."
22,15/03/2020,14:31,"Valencia confirm five positive tests for coronavirus, among them Garay","Valencia confirmed on Sunday five of the club's players and staff have tested positive for coronavirus, including Argentinian defender Ezequiel Garay.","Valencia said all those affected were ""now at home, in good health and obeying self-isolation measures."" Garay, who was set to miss the rest of the season with a knee injury, became the first player in La Liga to confirm a positive test earlier on Sunday. ""Clearly I've got off on the wrong foot in 2020,"" Garay wrote on social media. ""I've tested positive for the coronavirus, I'm fine and now just listening to the health authorities, at the moment in isolation."" Valencia confirmed more cases shortly after Garay's announcement. ""Valencia CF confirm five positive cases of the COVID-19 coronavirus have been detected amongst first team staff and players. ""All of these persons are now at home, in good health and obeying self-isolation measures."" Valencia played behind closed doors on Tuesday in the Champions League against Atalanta, the Serie A team based in Lombardy, one of Italy's worst-hit regions by the virus. After playing the first leg away at Atalanta on February 19 without restrictions to supporters, Valencia was one of the first Spanish clubs to take precautions. The club announced on February 28 they would be suspending all non-sporting activity with the first-team after a journalist attending the opening game against Atalanta was confirmed to have tested positive. All engagement with the media before and after subsequent matches against Real Betis on February 29 and Alaves on Friday was cancelled, while a tribute to the club's former player David Villa was also called off. La Liga have since suspended all league fixtures for two weeks while clubs have closed down their training grounds and instructed players to train alone from home. An unnamed Real Madrid basketball player tested positive for coronavirus on Thursday. Serious doubts remain about whether the current season can be finished, with La Liga understood to be in favour of extending the campaign into the summer and postponing Euro 2020 until either later this year or 2021. UEFA will hold a video conference on Tuesday, where football's response to the virus will be discussed, along with the status of Euro 2020, the Champions League and the Europa League."
23,12/03/2020,11:11,EU court annuls order for Spanish clubs to repay state aid,"A European court on Thursday overturned an order that two Spanish football clubs, Valencia and Elche, must repay millions of euros in public subsidies.","In July 2016, after concluding an investigation into alleged breaches of EU state aid rules, the European Commission had demanded the clubs repay Spain. La Liga outfit Valencia was supposed to refund 20.4 million euros ($22.9 million) and second division Elche 3.7 million euros. But the General Court of the European Union has now found that the commission, the EU's executive arm, had made a ""manifest error of assessment"" in issuing the order. The EU had argued that loan guarantees provided to the clubs by public bodies had allowed them to obtain finance at unfairly advantageous rates. But the court ruled that Brussels' calculations were off and cancelled the order."

""We will all celebrate together in June,"" Gasperini promised the housebound fans. ""Everyone united, we will beat this virus."" Going through 8-4 on aggregate, Atalanta's players held up a t-shirt to the TV camera after the game in an empty Mestalla Stadium, urging: ""Bergamo, it's for you. Don't give up!"" The Lombardy region in northern Italy has been hardest-hit by coronavirus epidemic which has killed 631 people in the country, where over 10,000 have been infected. Over 40,000 Atalanta fans -- a third of Bergamo's population -- had travelled to the San Siro to see the team win the first leg 4-1 on February 19 before the virus swept through Italy. But they were forced to watch on TV on Tuesday night, with fans heeding the club's appeal not to gather at the airport, or in downtown Bergamo. Supporters also opted to forego their reimbursements for the game in Spain, asking that the money, estimated at 60,000 euros ($68,000), be donated to a local hospital. The party, however, went ahead on social networks, with fans cheering behind closed doors with the team's colours flying from windows. ""It was the only thing we could do, win and give a smile in such a difficult moment for Italy and for my city,"" wrote defender Mattia Caldara on Instagram. ""We are in the quarter-finals of the Champions League, congratulations to all."" ""Thanks you, Dea (Goddess),"" wrote daily Gazzetta Dello Sport, using the club's nickname. ""Historic joy for Bergamo in the darkest hours."" It was stunning individual display by Ilicic, nicknamed 'granny', who has had the best season of his career aged 32 years, a decade after arriving in Serie A at Palermo. He joined Atalanta in 2017 from Fiorentina. ""The older I get, the better I play it's true,"" said the Slovenian international who overtakes Zlatan Ibrahmovic as the oldest player to score a Champions League hat-trick away. Ilicic has scored 21 goals in 29 appearances in all competitions this season. And having also scored in the first leg he joins Ballon d'Or winners Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo as the only players to score five or more goals over two legs of a Champions League knockout tie. ""Already after the match in Milan I said that Atalanta is no longer a surprise,"" said Ilicic. ""We want to continue like this. Our goal is to show that we deserve where we are now."" The team's stunning run comes despite losing their opening three Champions League group games, including 4-0 away to Dinamo Zagreb before a 5-1 loss at Manchester City. But a 1-1 draw against City at the San Siro sparked a revival that led to them finishing seven points behind the Premier League side in second to reach the knockout stage. Fourth in Serie A, Atalanta will now have to wait before returning to the pitch with all sport in Italy suspended until April 3 in an attempt to halt the spread of the virus."
25,11/03/2020,00:02,Four-goal Ilicic guides Atalanta into Champions League quarters,Atalanta's fairytale Champions League run continued inside an empty stadium on Tuesday as Josip Ilicic scored four times in a 4-3 win over Valencia that sent his team into the quarter-finals 8-4 on aggregate.,"A frantic contest inside an echoing Mestalla stadium was the first of several in the competition to be played behind closed doors due to the coronavirus, with 55,000 vacant seats creating a surreal atmosphere that was never likely to deliver a momentous Valencia comeback. They had been tasked with overturning a 4-1 defeat from the opening game in Italy and any hopes were all-but dashed inside 90 seconds when Mouctar Diakhaby conceded the first of two penalties, each converted by Ilicic. In between, Kevin Gameiro had levelled for Valencia and then scored again shortly after half-time before Ferran Torres lobbed in to leave the hosts needing three in just over 20 minutes. Yet any chance of a revival was quickly snuffed out as Ilicic completed his hat-trick and added a fourth to ensure Atalanta ended a strange evening with their names in the draw on March 20. The Slovenia international also became the first player to score four times away from home in a Champions League knockout match. Atalanta's progress remains the greatest surprise of this year's tournament, in which they lost all three of their opening group games and are featuring for the first time in the club's 113-year history. ""After a difficult start to this competition, we got the hang of it,"" said coach Gian Piero Gasperini afterwards. All the more the shame then that their advance on the back of two brilliant victories over Valencia was overshadowed by the sight of a Champions League knock-out tie being played with only a handful of stadium staff in the stands. The shouts of the players were audible throughout while in the first half Valencia seemingly projected crowd noise through a sound system, although it was later turned off when hopes of a comeback had disappeared. Valencia's supporters had gathered outside the stadium before kick-off to welcome the team bus but none were allowed inside. Atalanta are based in Bergamo in northern Italy, one of the worst-hit regions in a country that has had 631 people killed by the virus so far. After the final whistle, the players held up a shirt to a television camera that had the message, ""Bergamo, this is for you!"" written across the front. ""We are very happy with how we have represented a region that suffers so much,"" said Gasperini. Spain announced on Monday that all schools in the Madrid area will close on Wednesday while La Liga had confirmed earlier on Tuesday that all matches in the top two divisions will be played behind closed doors for two weeks at least. The sense of deflation at not having any fans on hand was impossible to ignore because before even two minutes were up, Valencia were behind. Diakhaby slid in to block Ilicic's dummy-shot and scythed down the striker as he turned back. Ilicic drove the penalty down the middle for his 18th goal of the season. Valencia equalised after Atalanta conceded possession cheaply in midfield and Rodrigo slid in Gameiro to finish, but Ilicic converted a second penalty before half-time, after Diakhaby feathered the ball with his hand. Gameiro made it 2-2 by heading in Torres' cross and then Torres found the net himself, lifting the ball over Marco Sportiello to give Valencia some hope with 23 minutes left. But four minutes later, Ilicic completed his treble with a driven shot into the corner and with progress secured, he grabbed the win too when the ball spilled out to him at the back post and he guided it into the top corner."
26,09/03/2020,15:54,Valencia to attempt Atalanta comeback in empty stadium due to coronavirus,Valencia will attempt an unlikely comeback without their fans on Tuesday when they play Atalanta in the Champions League behind closed doors due to the outbreak of the coronavirus.,"Retrieving a 4-1 defeat from the first leg in Italy was always going to be a formidable task for Valencia but looks even more so after UEFA instructed their home tie at Mestalla be played in an empty stadium to limit the spread in Spain. Atalanta are based in Bergamo in the Lombardy region of northern Italy, one of the worst-hit areas in the country. Italy had registered more than 7,000 cases of coronavirus on Monday. Spain has been less affected so far, with just under 1,000 confirmed cases on Monday and 37 in the Valencian Community, which includes Castellon, Valencia and Alicante. Valencia announced on February 28 they would be suspending all non-sporting activity with the club's first team players after a journalist attending the opening fixture against Atalanta on February 19 was confirmed to have been infected. It meant all engagement with the media before and after subsequent matches against Real Betis on February 29 and Alaves on Friday was cancelled, while a tribute to the club's former player David Villa was also called off. But the last-16 meeting with Atalanta will be Valencia's first to be contested behind closed doors and, in theory, puts them at a significant disadvantage in their bid to reach the Champions League's quarter-finals. Valencia captain Dani Parejo expressed anger last week at what he perceives as inconsistency in the approach of the authorities to football matches. ""I am the first to be concerned about the crisis and that is why I am also first to feel indignant when I see the measures taken are not consistent,"" Parejo said. ""I don't understand how a global crisis can be managed in Spain depending on the region in which you live."" Parejo added: ""If it's dangerous for people to attend Mestalla, it's also dangerous at the Parc des Princes, at Anfield, at the Red Bull Arena, at the Etihad [Stadium], at Camp Nou, at the Allianz [Stadium] in Turin and at the Allianz [Arena] in Munich."" Despite heavy restrictions on travel in and out of northern Italy, Atalanta were able to fly to Spain on Monday morning although media events usually scheduled for the day before a Champions League fixture were cancelled. Atalanta have played only once since their thumping first-leg victory over Valencia, a 7-2 win on March 1 away at Lecce, who are based in southern Italy. Atalanta fans attending the game underwent medical checks before entering the ground. Only five Serie A matches were staged on Sunday, with all of the games played in front of empty stands. Italian sports minister Vincenzo Spadafora has insisted matches should be suspended completely and accused Serie A of being ""irresponsible"" for allowing some to go ahead."

""The decision of the authorities is that these matches are to be played behind closed doors,"" Illa told reporters. Illa said ""a large gathering of fans"" needed to be avoided for both matches as Valencia look to overturn a 4-1 first-leg deficit at the Mestalla stadium on March 10. A Spanish sports journalist who covered the first match at the San Siro on February 19 was diagnosed with coronavirus on his return home. The Spanish government has made the decision to close the match to supporters due to the ""large presence of fans"" from area of northern Italy most affected by the coronavirus outbreak, said Illa. Atalanta are based in Bergamo in Lombardy, the region that has so far been worst hit in Italy by an epidemic that has killed 79 people and infected more than 2,500. Up to now 150 cases of coronavirus have been detected in Spain according to the latest official figures. Basketball matches between Spanish teams and clubs in northern Italy have also been affected, with Valencia v Olimpia Milan on March 5 in the men's EuroLeague and Girona v Venezia in the Women's Eurocoupe on March 19 closed off to supporters."
28,29/02/2020,18:22,Valencia get back to winning ways with victory over Betis,Valencia stopped the rot by securing their first win in six matches on Saturday as Kevin Gameiro and Dani Parejo scored in a 2-1 victory over Real Betis.,"Gameiro's curling shot flew in off the post at Mestalla before Parejo added a late second to give Valencia a much-needed boost in their pursuit of La Liga's top four. Loren Moron fired in a consolation for Betis deep in injury-time. Valencia had also been disrupted by the spread of coronavirus after a sports journalist covering the team was confirmed last week to have contracted the illness, prompting the club to cancel all press activity before and after the game. The result lifts Albert Celades' side to seventh in La Liga while Betis drop to 13th, their own sticky patch extended to seven matches without a win. After being thrashed 4-1 by Atalanta to leave them on the brink of being knocked out of the Champions League last 16, Valencia were beaten 3-0 by fellow top-four hopefuls Real Sociedad last weekend. Celades will hope a determined performance against Betis can kickstart a recovery with winnable games up next in the league against Alaves and Levante, with the second leg at home to Atalanta coming in between. Betis might have taken the lead had the lively Nabil Fekir taken advantage of Parejo giving the ball away early in his own box. Valencia's Jose Gaya then hit the crossbar with a effort from distance that almost dropped in. All three goals came after half-time. Fekir skimmed the bar after meeting a cut-back from Joaquin and then Valencia took the lead, Gameiro pushing the ball into space on the edge of the area before curling in off the far post. They gave themselves some breathing space when Parejo was allowed to take a touch and steer in a second, which was needed, as Moron banged home for Betis from close range in the 93rd minute."
29,20/02/2020,00:08,Atalanta thrash Valencia on night to 'remember forever',"Atalanta coach Gian Piero Gasperini hailed a performance his club will ""remember forever"" after the Italian side crushed Valencia 4-1 on Wednesday to take a giant step closer to reaching the Champions League quarter-finals for the first time.","Dutch wing-back Hans Hateboer scored twice on 16 and 62 minutes, sandwiching goals from Josip Ilicic and Remo Freuler. ""This is an evening that we'll remember forever,"" said Gasperini. ""It's an amazing result, full of emotion."" It was an extraordinary night for the side from Bergamo who travelled to the San Siro with over 40,000 of their fans as their home stadium 55km away does not meet UEFA regulations. Denis Cheryshev pulled one back for Valencia in the first leg of the last-16 tie at the San Siro, the same stadium where the Spanish side lost the 2001 final to Bayern Munich on penalties. Valencia, seventh in La Liga, had finished top of their group after away wins over Ajax and Chelsea but were missing several key players through injury and suspension. ""It certainly complicates things a bit, it's a pretty overwhelming result, this 4-1,"" said Valencia coach Albert Celades. ""In the end it doesn't reflect much what we saw on the pitch."" Atalanta's run comes despite losing their opening three Champions League group games, before finishing second behind Manchester City. ""Three goals ahead is a nice reward,"" added Gasperini. ""But there were a lot of dangerous situations, these are things we'll need to improve in Valencia. ""We are satisfied with this victory and above all with this advantage. ""Yesterday I would have signed to go to Valencia in the return game with a three-goal lead."" The tournament debutants dominated the first half with Mario Pasalic having their first chance on eight minutes, but Valencia goalkeeper Jaume Domenech pushed the ball over the bar at full stretch. Hateboer opened the scoring just after quarter of an hour, though, meeting a low Gomez cross to poke past Domenech for his first goal of the season. Ferran Torres struck the post for Valencia on the half-hour mark, before Eliaquim Mangala missed a chance to connect with Goncalo Guedes' shot across the face of goal. Marten de Roon and Gomez both fired over before Ilicic collected Pasalic's pass and drilled a powerful right-footed strike into the top corner three minutes before half-time. Gasperini's side put the result on the night beyond any doubt 12 minutes after the break as Freuler curled in a magnificent third from the edge of the box. Hateboer completed his brace five minutes later, ensuring that Atalanta's 12 goals in their first Champions League campaign have been scored by 10 different players. Maxi Gomez had a golden chance to pull a goal back on the hour mark for the visitors but his weak effort was brilliantly saved by Pierluigi Gollini in the Atalanta goal. Cheryshev came off the bench and immediately scored in the 66th minute, pouncing on a poor Jose Luis Palomino pass to give Valencia an away goal and a glimmer of hope to take into the second leg on March 10 at the Mestalla. ""We had opportunities and we didn't finish them,"" said Celades. ""The result is clear enough today, but it's not impossible (to turn around). Let's see what happens at Mestalla, let's play well in our stadium."""

""We have already played many important games, we will have to draw on our experience of those games here."" The Spanish club have been depleted for various reasons and are missing six players including injured Ezequiel Garay and suspended fellow central defender Gabriel Paulista, with midfielder Alessandro Florenzi down with chicken pox. ""It doesn't make me think it will be easier,"" said Gasperini. ""When a team plays in the Champions League they have an extensive squad and those who play give the maximum. ""Valencia represent an elite of Spanish football. They came first in a very difficult group winning against Ajax and Chelsea."" The match in Atalanta's first campaign in the top-tier of European football will be played at the 80,000-seater San Siro, home to Inter Milan and AC Milan, as Gasperini's side's own Gewiss Stadium 55km away does not meet UEFA requirements. ""This is our first great success, moving so many people, we have never played with such a big crowd,"" added Gasperini. ""But we mustn't get carried away by the euphoria of it."" The visitors' coach Albert Celades warned despite their injury woes his outfit were ready to defuse the free-scoring Italians, who are fourth in Serie A but lead the way with 63 goals in 24 games. ""Atalanta are a goal bomb. We will try to use our available weapons to defuse them,"" said Celades. ""We are facing a really attacking team, that has scored the most goals in Serie A. Their season is impressive, they are an uninhibited team that goes on the pitch to have fun. ""They love to go forward.

""This is a game that we have been waiting months for,"" said Gasperini. ""Being able to play on front of so many of our fans at a venue like San Siro is a beautiful achievement that we have been waiting a long time for. ""The Champions League is a dream which we'll try to carry forward as much as possible. ""The whole city of Bergamo is practically travelling to Milan."" The team's stunning run comes despite losing their opening three Champions League group games, including 4-0 away to Dinamo Zagreb before a 5-1 loss at Manchester City. But a 1-1 draw against Man City in the San Siro sparked the revival of 'La Dea' (The Goddess) who finished seven points behind the Premier League side in second to reach the knockout stage. Atalanta's confidence has been further boosted after seeing off AS Roma 2-1 in a cauldron atmosphere on front of their home crowd at their Atleti Azzurri d'Italia stadium on Saturday. The victory consolidated fourth place in Serie A, six points ahead of the side from the capital and bolstered their hopes of Champions League next season. ""This victory gives us confidence for the next games, it was a fundamental clash to be won,"" said Mario Pasalic who came off the bench and hit the match winner 19 seconds later. Their current form is a remarkable achievement for a club with a modest budget compared to rivals Juventus, Inter Milan and AC Milan. Their transformation follows the arrival of Gasperini in the summer of 2016 from Genoa. The 62-year-old previously coached Crotone, Palermo and briefly Inter Milan, where he was sacked after a run of five winless Serie A games and just one point. The team -- founded 113 years ago by a group of students from a local school and named after Atalanta, a huntress in Greek mythology -- had been relegated in 2003, 2005 and 2010. Gasperini guided them to a fourth-place finish in his first season to qualify for the Europa League. Last season they finished third, powered by Colombian Duvan Zapata's 23 league goals, and qualified for the Champions League for the first time. ""I think there are a series of elements that now allow this team to chase after the dream,"" said Gasperini. ""We have been playing at a very high level for three or four years. ""It's an extraordinary period of Atalanta."" Atalanta have the best attack in the league with 63 goals scored -- 17 more than Cristiano Ronaldo's Juventus. Zapata's three-month injury absence did not hurt the team. ""It gave us the opportunity to experiment with other solutions and it gives the opposition defence few reference points,"" explained Gasperini. Luis Muriel was supported up front by Pasalic and Ruslan Malinovskyi. Slovenian Josip Ilicic, 32, has already outperformed his pervious best season in Serie A with 14 goals in 20 games, including a hat-trick and three braces. Colombian Muriel has scored 12 goals, with Zapata on eight, followed by Robin Gosens (7) and Papu Gomez (6) and Pasalic (5). Despite 32 goals conceded in 24 league games, Gasperini sees this defensive weakness as a motivator. ""When we are under, we play better because we remove every inhibitor brake,"" said Gasperini. The Italian upstarts are hoping to mete out more pain on their rivals. ""Playing Atalanta is like going to the dentist, it's really, really tough,"" said Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola after being held 1-1 in the San Siro."
33,14/02/2020,23:47,Atletico held at Valencia as Liverpool loom,Atletico Madrid were twice pegged back in Friday's 2-2 draw at Valencia to keep Diego Simeone's side in fourth in La Liga ahead of Liverpool's visit next week.,"Atletico host the runaway Premier League leaders at the Wanda Metropolitano in the Champions League last 16 first leg on Tuesday. Twenty four hours later Valencia are in Italy to take on Atalanta in Milan. Atletico's Real Madrid recruit Marcos Llorente right-footed the visitors' into an early lead before a close range header from Gabriel Paulista got Valencia back level five minutes before the break. Three minutes later Ghanaian midfielder Thomas Partey had Atletico back in front only for Geoffrey Kondogbia to earn Valencia a share of the points off a set piece after the restart. This was Atletico's 10th stalemate of the season and it left them on 40 points, with Valencia in sixth, two points adrift. ""We're on the right path. It was an important match with lots of goal-scoring chances for both sides,"" commented Simeone, La Liga conveniently brought the game forward to Friday with their Champions League opponents both playing league matches on Saturday. Barcelona, trailing Real by three points, host Getafe, the surprise occupants of third place, on Saturday. Real are in action Sunday against Celta Vigo."
34,09/02/2020,00:09,"Atletico get timely victory, Getafe make top-four statement","Atletico Madrid won for the first time in four games on Saturday thanks to a 1-0 win over Granada that moved them into fourth place in La Liga, as Getafe continued their surprising charge towards Champions League football.","Argentinian forward Angel Correa scored Atletico's only goal in the sixth minute at the Wanda Metropolitano, netting for the fifth time in nine matches. Atletico had goalkeeper Jan Oblak to thank for preserving the three points with a superb save from Roberto Soldado's crafty second-half backheel. Diego Simeone's side could be overtaken on Sunday by Sevilla, who visit Celta Vigo, but the coach welcomed the return to form for a side who must face holders Liverpool in the last 16 of the Champions League later this month. ""We needed to win. Our stadium's support was extraordinary, we needed that energy,"" Simeone said. Getafe took another step towards Champions League qualification as Jorge Molina scored twice in a sensational 3-0 win over fellow top-four contenders Valencia. The 37-year-old Molina capped a storming performance with two goals in the second half before Jaime Mata added a third with three minutes left, after Valencia's Alessandro Florenzi had been sent off. Getafe stay third, three points ahead of Atletico and Sevilla. Up next for Jose Bordalas' side is a trip to Barcelona next weekend but on this evidence, it will be the stumbling Catalans feeling nervous ahead of that game. Getafe face La Liga's defending champions on the back of four consecutive victories, in which they have scored nine goals and conceded none. They bullied Valencia from start to finish, faster to the ball and hungrier in the tackles with all three goals coming from Getafe's players reacting quicker than their opponents. ""It was all shit, in defence and in attack,"" said Valencia's Gabriel Paulista. ""We have to change today's attitude. They have been more like men."" After Barca, they will play Ajax in the Europa League. Valencia, meanwhile, have won only four out of nine games since the turn of the year, with their own Champions League last 16 tie against Atalanta fast approaching. Getafe had to wait until 13 minutes into the second for Molina's opener. He slid the ball to Mata and then beat two Valencia defenders to the rebound from Jaume Domenech's save. Dani Parejo was at fault for the second as he gave the ball away in midfield and one pass set Molina free. He had three defenders to beat but somehow bundled through, a final pirouette making space for a smart finish. Florenzi was sent off with 12 minutes left for a frustrated spear tackle from behind on Marc Cucurella before Mata made it three. Villarreal were held to a 1-1 draw by Real Valladolid as well-travelled French forward Hartem Ben Arfa made his debut as a second-half substitute."
35,25/01/2020,19:01,Barca beaten by Valencia in early blow for Setien,Quique Setien's honeymoon period lasted less than a fortnight as he tasted his first Barcelona defeat on Saturday in his second La Liga game in charge after a 2-0 loss to Valencia.,"A Jordi Alba own goal and Maxi Gomez's strike at Mestalla raised early doubts about Setien's appointment and gave Real Madrid the chance to move three points clear at the top of the table when they visit Real Valladolid on Sunday. Sevilla jumped into third, above Atletico Madrid and five points behind the top two, after they beat Granada 2-0. Barcelona had most of the ball but Valencia had the best chances as Gomez missed a penalty and also hit the crossbar in the first half. Gabriel Paulista saw a third goal ruled out late on. While performances under previous coach Ernesto Valverde were stodgy and familiar failings went unresolved, he left a side in first place. Setien promised a new style but few will cheer a team that loses. Despite dominating possession, Barcelona did little with it and as Valencia grew in confidence, they ceded control too. ""There are things they have not understood or maybe we have not have explained ourselves well,"" Setien said afterwards. ""In the first half, quite frankly, we were bad."" The question is whether Setien is trying to impose too much too soon and perhaps whether this group are even well-suited his ideas. ""The players have to adapt to the coaching staff to understand,"" said Sergio Busquets. ""There were some good things but we have to improve."" Valencia climb to fifth and continue to improve under Albert Celades. This success came without their captain Dani Parejo and, largely, without star striker Rodrigo Moreno, who has been linked with a January move to Barcelona. The hosts hardly touched the ball for the first six minutes, their fans whistling as they urged a more aggressive approach. But the plan was to sit and absorb and it worked, with Barcelona unable to cut through or create a single clear chance. And when Valencia did intervene, they were more dangerous too. With their first attack they won a penalty as Jose Gaya slipped past Gerard Pique and would surely have scored from eight yards before being brought down. Pique was booked and, with Parejo absent, Gomez stepped up, only for his driven shot to be well saved by Marc-Andre ter Stegen, albeit with the help of half a yard's headstart off his line. Barca were riding their luck. Sergi Roberto's header cannoned off Pique but fell just close enough for Ter Stegen, who parried a Gomez shot onto the crossbar and almost spilled another to Kevin Gameiro. Referee Gil Manzano puts his hands together as if to apologise after failing to play advantage when Ferran Torres was clear but the frustration of Valencia's fans turned to ecstasy shortly after half-time. Pique's flicked header landed at the feet of Gomez, whose driven effort took a cruel deflection off Alba and flew in. Setien traded the patience of Arthur Melo for the physicality of Arturo Vidal and Rodrigo came on to a rousing reception. Barcelona exerted some pressure and Lionel Messi led the way, hauled to the ground by Francis Coquelin and then denied by a brilliant Gabriel tackle. He fired past the post, headed wide and saw a curling free-kick saved. Yet just as a Barcelona equaliser began to feel inevitable, Valencia struck again. A quick throw caught Alba out of position and Torres did well to cut inside and switch to Gomez. He took a touch and curled into the corner. Gabriel thought he had a third after volleying in from a corner but VAR persuaded Manzano there had been a push. When Messi ballooned a late free-kick and threw his arms up in despair, Valencia knew their win was secure. Sevilla celebrated the club's 130th anniversary by brushing aside Granada as Luuk de Jong met Jesus Navas' cross to put them in front while Nolito's subtle finish made it two before half-time. ""It was a complete performance,"" said Sevilla coach Julen Lopetegui."
36,08/01/2020,22:54,Kroos stunner helps Real Madrid through to Spanish Super Cup final,Toni Kroos scored a wonder goal straight from a corner as Real Madrid beat Valencia 3-1 on Wednesday to reach the final of the controversial Spanish Super Cup in Saudi Arabia.,"Kroos caught Valencia goalkeeper Jaume Domenech napping with a brilliant, instinctive strike before Isco made it two and Luka Modric added a classy third from a curling finish with the outside of his foot. After two superb goals, the only shame was more fans were not there to see them given the King Abdullah Sports City stadium appeared only a little more than half full. The official attendance was given as 40,877 out of a capacity of 62,345. Dani Parejo scored a late Valencia penalty but Madrid advance to Sunday's final where they will meet the winner of Thursday's second semi-final between Barcelona and Atletico Madrid. ""I'm happy with the whole performance,"" said Madrid coach Zinedine Zidane. ""For the goal of Isco, because maybe he needed that, the genius of Kroos and then something that only Modric can do. But it is a semi-final, we haven't won anything yet."" Barca coach Ernesto Valverde had said earlier on Wednesday that he preferred the traditional format of this competition, that pitted the La Liga champions against the winners of the Copa del Rey in a match in Spain in August. Under those rules, Real Madrid, who finished third in the league last term and failed to reach the final of the cup would not even have qualified but they now have the chance to win their first trophy of the season, possibly against Barca in a Clasico final. But it is the new location that has grated most, because of the lack of consideration for Spanish fans and the implications of associating with a country that has been heavily criticised for its treatment of women and record over human rights. In one of the more unusual aspects of the night, a giant banner of the King and Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia were hung in the centre of the pitch during half-time. Either side of the interval, Real Madrid were too strong, extending their unbeaten run to 15 matches with another performance to suggest they are La Liga's form team ahead of the second half of the season. Valencia had to cope without star player Rodrigo Moreno due to a knee injury while Madrid were also without their own top scorer in Karim Benzema, who has a hamstring strain, as well as Gareth Bale, who has a throat infection. Zidane did not rule out Bale joining up with the squad for the final but said the Welshman has not trained all week. In their absence, Kroos stepped up with a goal of which both Benzema and Bale would have been proud. Madrid won the corner in the 15th minute and with Domenech out of his goal, instructing Francis Coquelin, Kroos nipped around the flag and bent the ball towards the net. Domenech saw it coming but too late, and he could only succeed in punching the ball into the inside of his own goal. Valencia wanted a penalty when Casemiro nudged Carlos Soler in the back and Kevin Gameiro should have done better than blast over after he did well to wriggle through. But Madrid were the dominant force and Isco doubled the lead before the break. Fede Valverde pulled back for Modric and while his shot was blocked, Isco fired in the follow-up. Luka Jovic's struggles continued as he struck the post from close range before Modric added a final flourish, selling Gabriel Paulista with a stepover left before guiding the ball into the far corner with the ouside of his right foot. Sergio Ramos handballed late on and Parejo scored the penalty but for Valencia the game was already up."
37,07/01/2020,22:02,"'We're not here for a walk', Zidane says of Super Cup",Real Madrid coach Zinedine Zidane said his team is solely focused on lifting the Spanish Super Cup trophy ahead of this week's revamped four-team competition taking place in Saudi Arabia.,"""We're not coming here for a walk,"" Zidane said at a news conference Tuesday, on the eve of his team's semi-final against Copa del Rey holders Valencia in Jeddah. ""It's the first edition in Saudi Arabia and the competition is a great hope. It's an important competition and we want to give our all to play a good match tomorrow (Wednesday),"" said Zidane. ""It's a one-off match. It's not like playing in La Liga. We're both playing away and it's just one match. Everything changes but our mentality, it doesn't change."" Real and Valencia will be joined by Barcelona and Atletico Madrid in Saudi Arabia, amid controversy over a tournament held far from home in a country long-condemned for its record on human rights. Spanish media reported only nine percent of the 12,000 tickets set aside for the four competing clubs had been purchased. However, the three fixtures at the 62,000-capacity King Abdullah Stadium are expected to be sold out. Barcelona play Atletico on Thursday with the winners of the two semi-finals to meet Sunday in the final. Real will be without the injured Eden Hazard, while neither Karim Benzema, their top scorer, nor Gareth Bale have made the trip due to fitness problems. ""There are no favourites. The four teams which are here are the four favourites to win it,"" said Zidane. ""The only thing I'm thinking about is our match tomorrow. It's a semi-final, but for us, it will be a final."" Luka Jovic has scored just once for Real since his move from Eintracht Frankfurt in July but the Serbian forward is set to lead the attack in the absence of Benzema. ""Luka Jovic, he's the future. You have to take it slowly with him,"" said Zidane. ""He's a young player who wants to learn and play. He can score goals, but what interests me is the complete player he can become. ""He's only been with us for five or six months, so a bit of calm is needed."""

The duo will not travel to Saudi Arabia, where Madrid face Valencia in the semi-finals of a revised four-team tournament on Wednesday, after being left out of a squad list released by the club on Monday. The winner will face either Barcelona or Atletico Madrid in the final in Jeddah on Sunday. Real coach Zinedine Zidane said on Friday that he will also be without Eden Hazard as the Belgian has failed to recover from an ankle fracture. The decision in November to hold a four-team Super Cup in Saudi Arabia in the European winter for the next three years caused controversy. Spain's public broadcaster RTVE refused to bid for the rights to the due to it being held in a country where ""human rights are not respected""."

But Zidane has confirmed Hazard will miss Madrid's La Liga game against Getafe on Saturday and will not travel to Saudi Arabia, where his team face Valencia in the Spanish Super Cup semi-finals on Wednesday before a potential final against either Barcelona or Atletico Madrid four days later. ""He is 100 per cent out of the Super Cup,"" said Zidane in a press conference. ""He is not travelling, he is recovering and we hope that just after the Super Cup, little by little, we could see him with us again."" If Hazard returns against Sevilla in La Liga on January 18 he will have been out for almost eight weeks. The 28-year-old, who joined Real Madrid for 100 million euros from Chelsea last summer, also missed three matches at the start of the season with a thigh strain. He has scored one goal in 13 appearances for his new club so far. Madrid found form without him before Christmas but trail Barcelona by two points in the table after consecutive draws in the Clasico at Camp Nou and then at home to Athletic Bilbao. They play sixth-placed Getafe this weekend at the Coliseum Alfonso Perez, where Zidane's team were held to a goalless draw in April. Marcelo and Lucas Vazquez are available again after recovering from injuries but Sergio Ramos is suspended, meaning Eder Militao is likely to play in central defence. Zidane also suggested some fringe players could be allowed to leave in the January transfer window. Striker Mariano Diaz is among those that could depart.

41,16/12/2019,00:18,Benzema salvages draw at Valencia with Clasico looming,Real Madrid missed the chance to replace Barcelona at the top of La Liga ahead of Wednesday's Clasico but salvaged a 1-1 draw against Valencia as Karim Benzema scored a dramatic injury-time equaliser on Sunday.,"Madrid goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois ventured up for a final corner at Mestalla and it was his header that caused panic in the Valencia box, before the ball fell perfectly for Benzema to strike in the 95th minute. ""Opponents can get a little nervous if I go up,"" said Courtois. ""Toni (Kroos) hit the corner to the near post and I just saw the ball was at my height and I caught it well."" Madrid coach Zinedine Zidane said: ""He decided to go up and that shows we want more, than we never give up. The draw is a reward for the effort we made, which was a lot. This is Real Madrid, a team that never gives up."" Valencia looked set for an impressive victory after Carlos Soler had put them ahead in the second half but both sides had to settle for a point at the end of a compelling contest between two of the league's form teams. It means Barcelona remain top of the table but in front of Madrid only on goal difference, after they were also held to a 2-2 draw away at Real Sociedad on Saturday. Madrid were celebrating at the final whistle but the result completes a strong week for Valencia, who won away at Ajax on Tuesday to go through as group winners to the Champions League last 16. They stay eighth, now three points adrift of the top four. Real Madrid have been on a good run too, now 10 matches unbeaten to crank up the pressure on Barca and leave behind their early-season stumbles that had put Zidane's future in doubt. Zidane had said on Saturday nobody at the club would be looking ahead to the Clasico prematurely and while the draw against Valencia may mean an opportunity was missed, their late show still sends them to Camp Nou with a spring in their step. ""The team keeps up the unbeaten run and the boost to the mood from today is fantastic,"" said defender Dani Carvajal. ""Now we have to win at Camp Nou to go into the break at the top."" Benzema, in particular, will be a key threat. The Frenchman had Courtois to thank for his latest effort but he now has 15 goals already this season and nine in his last eight games. Zidane left Casemiro on the bench, with the Brazilian one yellow card away from a suspension. Gareth Bale also started as a substitute but came on in the second half, putting him in contention for a start in midweek. Madrid had the better of the early stages as Benzema rose to meet Nacho Fernandez's cross but headed wide before Rodrygo peeled free at the back post but nodded into the hands of Jasper Cillessen. Valencia grew in confidence as the half wore on, with Ferran Torres testing Courtois and then almost racing clear after a slip by Sergio Ramos, only for Courtois to intercept just in time. The contest remained in the balance early in the second period as Madrid shaded possession but Valencia looked dangerous on the break. Both teams fancied a winner as Celades brought on another forward in Manu Vallejo while Zidane threw on Bale and Vinicius Junior for Rodrygo and Isco with just over 20 minutes left. Valencia thought they had snatched it as Nacho was beaten in the air and Daniel Wass skipped free down the right. His pull-back was just angled enough to evade the stretching leg of Raphael Varane and find Soler, who smashed in. But Madrid poured forward late on. Luka Jovic, on as a substitute, poked in but was ruled out for offside. Then in the last play of the game, Courtois marauded up for a corner and it was his head that first met Toni Kroos' cross. Cillessen palmed away but Valencia failed to clear and in the scramble, Benzema struck."
42,10/12/2019,23:56,Ajax crash out of Champions League,Ajax's hopes of another fairytale run in the Champions League were dashed on Tuesday as a 1-0 defeat at home to Valencia sent them crashing out and the Spaniards through to the last 16.,"Rodrigo Moreno's 24th-minute strike proved the winner at the Johan Cruyff Arena and enough to flip the top three in Group H, with Valencia advancing in first place along with Chelsea, who beat bottom club Lille 2-1. ""Time puts everyone in their place,"" said Rodrigo afterwards. ""We made a huge effort against Chelsea and it wasn't to be but this team never tires of miracles and this is another one."" Ajax were arguably the story of the competition last season when their youthful team went all the way to the semi-finals but there will be no repeat this year. Gabriel Paulista was sent off in injury-time but even against 10 men, they could not find the equaliser they needed. Instead, Valencia not only progress but have earned themselves the best chance of a kind draw when the knock-out stage is decided in Nyon on December 16. It seemed unlikely after they missed a series of golden opportunities to beat Chelsea earlier this month but a 2-2 draw still left them with a chance, even if the odds were not in their favour. They knew they either had to beat Ajax, against whom they had lost 3-0 at home in October, or at least match the result of Chelsea, who always seemed likely to win against Lille at Stamford Bridge. Ajax, meanwhile, began the night two points clear at the top of the group and needed only a draw to go through. Valencia coach Albert Celades, who made his La Liga debut as a player under Cruyff, was now in the dugout of the stadium named after the iconic Dutchman and this will be a major boost for his side, who are eighth in La Liga after a rocky start to the season on and off the pitch. ""It's a huge reinforcement for us,"" said Celades. Ajax sit three points clear at the top of the Eredivisie but last year's heroics in the Champions League, and their heartbreaking defeat to Tottenham, meant they had European ambitions too. Rodrigo headed wide from a corner early on but after a frantic start, the game settled, with Ajax dominating possession and Valencia trying to counter-attack. Against the run of play, Valencia took the lead as Rodrigo's bending run in behind was picked out by a Ferran Torres pass. Rodrigo controlled with his left and fired the ball with his right into the roof of the net. Ajax had to wait until the end of the half for their best chance as Donny van de Beek latched onto Hakim Ziyech's pass and lifted the ball over Jaume Domenech, only for Jose Gaya to make a brilliant clearance off the line. Rodrigo might have made it two at the other end but it was Ajax that were pushing for an equaliser after the restart as Valencia retreated. Ziyech should have levelled but fluffed his finish at the near post before 20-year-old Noa Lang hooked over from inside the box. Lille pulled a goal back away at Chelsea to give Ajax further hope and they were almost gifted an equaliser by Valencia's Daniel Wass, who chested the ball away from his own goalkeeper. Ziyech went close with a shot towards the near post and, three minutes into injury time, Gabriel was sent off for thrusting his head into Dusan Tadic. It left Valencia to defend two minutes, and a corner, with 10 men but Ajax could not find a way through."
43,10/12/2019,23:09,Chelsea edge past Lille and into Champions League last 16,Chelsea booked their place in the last 16 of the Champions League as first-half goals from Tammy Abraham and Cesar Azpilicueta sealed a 2-1 win over a much-changed Lille at Stamford Bridge.,"Victory for Valencia over Ajax in the other game in Group H means Frank Lampard's men go through behind the Spaniards with last season's semi-finalists relegated to the Europa League. Chelsea knew victory would take them into the knockout stages no matter what the outcome was in Amsterdam and did their job early on against a Lille side with just one point to show for their return to the Champions League for the first time in seven years. Simple finishes from Abraham and Azpilicueta were just reward for a dominant first-half display, but Chelsea were forced to hold on in the final stages after Loic Remy halved Lille's deficit against his old club 12 minutes from time. The visitors were already sure to finish bottom of the group and coach Christophe Galtier showed his priority is trying to secure a return to the Champions League next season by finishing in the top three of Ligue 1 as he made seven changes to the side that beat Brest on Friday. Chelsea had won just one of their previous five games after a great start to life under Lampard and the Blues boss responded by adding a little more experience to what has been a very young side so far this season. Antonio Rudiger returned from injury to make just his second start of the campaign at centre-back, while Jorginho was restored in midfield to the side that lost 3-1 to Everton on Saturday. Up front, Abraham was again flanked by Christian Pulisic and Willian, and all three combined to open the scoring on 19 minutes. Pulisic unselfishly played in Willian on the right instead of opting to go for goal himself and the Brazilian's driven cross was tapped in by Abraham for his 13th goal of the season. Lille have been the whipping boys in a three-way shootout for two places in the last 16 and showed why 10 minutes before half-time when Azpilicueta was left completely unmarked to head home Emerson's corner from close range. Mike Maignan in the Lille goal kept his side in the game with a fine double save from Pulisic and Willian at the start of the second half. However, Chelsea took their foot off the gas as Lampard replaced Pulisic and Abraham ahead of a busy festive period in the Premier League. And the hosts had to suffer a nervy final dozen minutes when Remy fired in off the underside of the bar. Remy was a peripheral figure during three seasons at Chelsea between 2014 and 2017, but nearly came back to haunt his old employers only to fire weakly into the arms of Kepa Arrizabalaga in stoppage time. Instead, Chelsea saw the game out to mark another impressive milestone in Lampard's first season in charge."
44,17/05/2019,02:15,Valencia seek perfect end to remarkable recovery in La Liga,Valencia lost to Arsenal in the Europa League semi-finals but hold pole position for La Liga's last Champions League spot as the race for the top four reaches its climax on Saturday.,"Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang's hat-trick ended Valencia's hopes of qualifying by lifting a trophy and their chances looked slim in the league too, when they trailed Getafe by three points ahead of the penultimate weekend. But a 3-1 win over Alaves, combined with Getafe losing away to a wounded Barcelona, means it is Valencia with their fate in their own hands, as they prepare to face Real Valladolid at Jose Zorrilla. A superior head-to-head over Getafe means they need only match the result of Jose Bordelas' side, who host a Villarreal team sitting 14th and with little left to play for. Yet Valladolid's position appears in Valencia's favour too. Victory away at Rayo Vallecano last weekend means their safety is already secured. Win, and Valencia will be guaranteed Champions League football in consecutive seasons for the first time in seven years, a feat that not too long ago seemed almost unthinkable. After five games, they were 15th and still to win. After 10, they were 14th, having won once and scored seven goals. After 15 games, they had won three but were back in 15th, ground to a halt by nine draws. When Marcelino was appointed in 2017, he was the club's 12th coach in five years and only one of them -- Nuno Espirito Santo -- had overseen enough matches to make even one full league season. Most waited for the trigger to click but Marcelino stayed and after 10 draws in 13 games, they won, coming from behind in the Copa del Rey to beat Segunda B side Ebro, who had a man sent off after 29 minutes. ""There was this click,"" said striker Kevin Gameiro in an interview with AFP this month. ""And there was also a bit of luck."" Defeats by Girona, Juventus and Real Madrid tempered hopes of a recovery but in between came three victories in a row and after, five games unbeaten, including a Champions League win over Manchester United. Eighth in the table at the start of the year, Valencia then surged through March and April, 10 wins thrusting them within sight of the top four. ""The word surrender does not exist in my vocabulary,"" said Marcelino. They stumbled again, twice, defeated last month by Atletico Madrid and Eibar, the resurgence almost evaporating in the space of four days. But their rivals wobbled too as Getafe lost their nerve and Sevilla faded, the bounce from bringing in Joaquin Caparros to replace Pablo Machin proving short-lived. Sevilla's decision to act has them lying sixth, needing to win at home to in-form Athletic Bilbao on Saturday and needing both Valencia and Getafe to lose. Valencia's decision to persevere may be about to pay off, a top-four finish the perfect boost ahead of the Copa del Rey final on May 25 against Barcelona, who will be without Luis Suarez and perhaps goalkeeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen. ""The spirit of the team has merged with the spirit of Valencia, which is always: never give up,"" said striker Rodrigo earlier this month. For Getafe, the Europa League would be a disappointment, even for a team who were promoted to the top flight only two years ago and whose annual wage bill is more than ten times less than Real Madrid, the club they hope to finish one place behind. ""Everything can still happen,"" said Bordalas. Getafe have a chance, which is perhaps more than can be said for Girona, whose players and coach Eusebio Sacristan conceded their loss at home to Levante last weekend had been decisive in the fight against relegation. ""All that's left is to say sorry,"" said an emotional Eusebio afterwards. ""I was convinced I could do it but I failed."" They are 18th, needing to make up three points and a six-goal deficit in goal difference to overtake Celta Vigo on the final day. Celta have the added advantage of hosting already-relegated Rayo Vallecano while Girona play at Alaves. Barcelona's title-winning campaign will end away at Eibar on Sunday just as Real Madrid's miserable season finishes at home to Real Betis."
45,08/05/2019,02:25,"Arsenal lean on Lacazette, Aubameyang to save their season",Arsenal's collapse at the business end of the Premier League season means the success or failure of Unai Emery's first campaign now solely depends on lifting the Europa League and as a result sealing Champions League football.,"The Gunners travel to Emery's old club Valencia on Thursday defending a 3-1 semi-final, first leg lead given to them by star strikers Alexandre Lacazette and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang at the Emirates last week. Arsenal's awful record on the road this season will give the Spanish side plenty of encouragement that they can overturn a two-goal deficit. Emery's men conceded three times in losing at Wolves and Leicester in their last two away league games and were also defeated at BATE Borisov and Rennes before turning Europa League ties around at the Emirates. Attack may therefore be the visitors' best form of defence in the cauldron of the Mestalla and Arsenal are at least getting what they paid for from Lacazette and Aubameyang. ""We played against two strikers that are very good which is why they cost the millions that they did,"" said Valencia coach Marcelino Garcia Toral. ""With the slightest error they punish you."" Arsenal have taken one point from their last four Premier League games to realistically end their chances of a top-four finish and the first leg against Valencia could easily have gone the same way as Marcelino's men scored an early away goal and led the Gunners to a merry dance for the first 20 minutes. However, one moment of magic turned the tie as Lacazette played in Aubameyang, who paused, left Neto, Ezequiel Garay and Facundo Roncaglia on the floor before squaring for his strike partner to roll into an empty net. Lacazette added his second eight minutes later and Aubameyang's late strike gave Arsenal the two-goal cushion they may well need. The Londoners' first season without Arsene Wenger for 22 years has been dogged by many of the same defensive problems suffered by the Frenchman towards the end of his reign. But Wenger's final two big signings have come good as club record fees were paid for Lacazette in the summer of 2017 and Aubameyang in January 2018. After a difficult first six months in England, many thought Aubameyang's arrival was ominous for Lacazette's longevity at the club, but the two have formed a fine partnership on and off the field. Only Liverpool's Mohamed Salah has scored more Premier League goals than Aubameyang's 20, but it is Lacazette who won the club's player of the year prize for his all round contribution with 18 goals and 12 assists. Those figures are all the more impressive as they have often had to battle for just one starting spot. Both players have voiced their displeasure at Emery's reluctance throughout the campaign to play with two strikers. ""You know that I like to play with two strikers but I don't want to say it,"" admitted Aubameyang, while Lacazette conceded to French television station RMC he ""could be even happier"" if he started more regularly. ""Every player wants to play each match for 90 minutes, but as a manager I need to use the player in the best moment,"" said Emery in defence of his decisions throughout the season. ""Sometimes our performances are better with both, but sometimes our big performances are better with only one, and after they make an impact replacing another striker."" Given the problems Emery is trying to patch up at the other end, the Gunners are likely to need the firepower of both to ensure they make it to Baku to try and save their season next month."
46,02/05/2019,22:58,Arsenal strike late to edge towards Europa League final,"Arsenal took a huge step towards the Europa League final as a double from Alexandre Lacazette and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang's late strike earned a 3-1 semi-final, first leg win over Valencia on Thursday.","The Spanish side's bright start was rewarded with Mouctar Diakhaby's away goal, but Lacazette quickly turned the game around with two goals in eight minutes before Aubameyang's late intervention gave the Gunners a two-goal advantage to defend at the Mestalla on May 9. Arsenal boss Unai Emery is a Europa League specialist having won the competition three times when in charge at Sevilla. And the Spaniard's decision to start Lacazette and Aubameyang together against his former side was richly rewarded despite a terrible start from the hosts. Arsenal are desperate not just for silverware in Emery's first season but the guarantee of Champions League qualification for next season that winning the Europa League would bring. A run of three straight Premier League defeats has left Emery's men needing more favours from Chelsea or Tottenham to stand any chance of a top-four Premier League finish. The Gunners had conceded three times in all three of those defeats to Crystal Palace, Wolves and Leicester and the same defensive deficiencies cost them again early on. Valencia had already missed a glorious chance to take the lead when Ezequiel Garay somehow turned Rodrigo's driven cross over the bar from point-blank range. However, the hosts did not learn their lesson and from another set-piece, Valencia took the lead when Diakhaby got the final touch at the back post to force home Rodrigo's header across goal. Emery has been reticent to start Lacazette and Aubameyang together up front, but the game turned on one moment of magic from Arsenal's two prolific strikers. Lacazette played in Aubameyang and the Gabon international left his marker and Valencia goalkeeper Neto on the ground before squaring for his strike partner to roll into an empty net. Seven minutes later, Arsenal led as terrible defending allowed Lacazette a free header from Granit Xhaka's cross and a weak hand from Neto could not prevent the ball crossing the line. The chances continued to come for Arsenal's front two as Aubameyang volleyed into the ground and over just before the break. Lacazette then had two glorious opportunities to complete his hat-trick as he firstly failed to connect with an inch-perfect Aubameyang cross before Neto made a brilliant save at his near post to keep the Spanish side in the tie. At the other end Petr Cech also had to make a smart stop as he raced from his goal to deny substitute Kevin Gameiro. The veteran stopper has announced he will retire at the end of the season. And Cech's final game could well be against his former club Chelsea in next month's final as the Blues secured a 1-1 draw away at Eintracht Frankfurt in the first leg of the other semi-final. Arsenal still have work to do with their terrible away record this season likely to give Valencia plenty of encouragement. However, they moved much closer to booking their place in Baku when Aubameyang turned home at the back post in the final minute."
47,02/05/2019,03:00,Gameiro to torment Arsenal in Emery reunion,Kevin Gameiro has knocked Arsenal out of one Europa League semi-final and now he wants to do it again.,"Gameiro helped Atletico Madrid end Arsene Wenger's hopes of a glorious finale last season, a 2-1 aggregate win sending them through to the final, where they would sail past Marseille. Twelve months on, it is Unai Emery in charge of Arsenal and Gameiro leading the line for Valencia who, like their opponents, may well need to win the Europa League to play in the Champions League next term. ""It's going to be a different game to last year, they have a new coach and he has brought his own style to the Arsenal team,"" Gameiro told AFP Sport. ""We will have to be aware of all their strengths and weaknesses because they play a fast game, they control the ball and have players who can break quickly. It will need us to give everything to win."" If Gameiro knows Arsenal, he knows Emery too, having played under the Spaniard at Sevilla, where together they won the Europa League three times on the bounce in 2014, 2015 and 2016. In the first final, Gameiro owned the decisive touch, his winning penalty in the shoot-out giving Sevilla victory over Benfica. In the third, he scored again, a tap-in turning the tide against Liverpool in a 3-1 win in Basel. ""We haven't kept in touch but I saw Unai again when Atletico played a friendly against Arsenal in Singapore and it will nice to see him again,"" Gameiro said. ""He is a great motivator. In these big games and big moments, he knows how to get the best out of his players. He has won this competition three times, he knows how it works. But we both want to be in this final."" This season, Gameiro has scored six goals since the turn of the year after managing only two before it, a trajectory similar to his team, who have recovered well from a painfully slow start. After 12 games, Valencia had managed only two La Liga victories and sat 15th in the table but a second-half surge has seen them move to within three points of the top four. ""It was a complicated start to the season with a lot of draws but after Christmas there was this click,"" Gameiro said. ""We had a bit of luck and suddenly started to believe we could win matches again. We just needed our confidence back because we have a very talented squad."" Marcelino, appointed in May 2017, came under pressure but Valencia held their nerve. ""He continued in the same way and stayed loyal to his beliefs,"" Gameiro said. ""There were a lot of late signings last summer and they maybe needed a bit of time to acclimatise to the club and the coach. I think I was the same, I needed slightly longer to adapt than I expected. ""I questioned myself and realised I needed to change to succeed here. You'd rather start slowly and finish fast than the other way round."" With a Copa del Rey final against Barcelona still to come next month, Valencia are fighting on three fronts for what could be a spectacular end to the season. But if overcoming Sevilla and Getafe to take fourth seems unlikely, breaking Barca's four-year hold on the Copa del Rey seems an even more formidable task. Beating Arsenal, and then either Chelsea or Frankfurt in the final, seems Valencia's best hopee. ""There will be a lot of pressure and it is good for us to play the first game in London,"" Gameiro said. ""We know they are strong at home but if we can manage the difficult moments, we can capitalise in the second leg."""
48,01/05/2019,02:25,Emery turns to Europa League once more to salvage Arsenal's season,Unai Emery's first season in charge at Arsenal is in danger of imploding unless the Spaniard can again prove himself to be a Europa League specialist and cover up an alarming dip in the Gunners' Premier League form.,"Arsenal have lost four of their past five league games to Everton, Crystal Palace, Wolverhampton Wanderers and Leicester City to slip down to fifth and relying on more favours from Chelsea or Tottenham to have any chance of a top-four finish. However, winning the Europa League would also offer a much-needed return to the Champions League next season after a two-year absence. For 20 years under Arsene Wenger, Arsenal enjoyed the riches and the glamour of the Champions League and the impact of missing out has had serious implications on the budget Emery has had to work with. In January, he revealed the club could not afford to make any permanent signings. Emery is a specialist in Europe's second-tier competition, winning it three times when at Sevilla, and he is also well acquainted with Arsenal's semi-final opponents, Valencia, who he managed between 2008 and 2012. Emery also did a stellar job at the Mestalla, leading Valencia to three consecutive third-placed finishes behind dominant Barcelona and Real Madrid sides managed by Pep Guardiola and Jose Mourinho. ""Emery was inducted into the Valencia hall of fame as one of the managers to have spent most time at Valencia, qualifying the team for the Champions League and performing well in it,"" Valencia-based journalist Luis Cortes told AFP. However, doubts remain over his ability to lead Arsenal's rebuild back to the heights they once enjoyed under Wenger. The same defensive issues that haunted the Frenchman's final years in charge have been in evidence in recent weeks, conceding three times in three consecutive league defeats for the first time since 1967. Emery has constantly changed personnel and formations, but is yet to find the right balance with one of his two star forwards Alexandre Lacazette and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang often left out. Yet, there have been notable successes. Top-four rivals Tottenham, Chelsea and Manchester United were all beaten at the Emirates this season and Emery's men won home and away to Napoli in the Europa League quarter-finals. Arsenal go into the final two games of the league season just two points off the top four, compared to languishing 12 points behind in Wenger's final season. ""At the beginning of the season we knew it was going to be very difficult (to finish in the top four),"" said Emery after the weekend's chastening 3-0 defeat at Leicester. ""We will continue, we will not look at the table, the Europa League is a big motivation for us."" Valencia find themselves in a similar situation to Arsenal in looking at the Europa League to save a disappointing domestic season. A shock 1-0 home defeat to Eibar on Saturday leaves Los Che sixth in La Liga and three points outside the top four with three games left. Former Arsenal defender Gabriel Paulista will return to the Emirates on Thursday and wants to mark Valencia's centenary year in style. ""I want to be in the history of Valencia,"" said the Brazilian. ""It is the year of the centenary and in 100 years' time I want people to remember that Gabriel Paulists won the Europa League with Valencia,"" he told the club's website."
49,24/04/2019,21:33,Atletico edge five-goal thriller with Valencia to delay Barca celebrations,Atletico Madrid delayed Barcelona winning La Liga by a few days at least after Alvaro Morata and Antoine Griezmann each scored in a 3-2 victory over Valencia on Wednesday.,"Defeat at the Wanda Metropolitano would have crowned Barca kings of Spain for a 26th time in their history, with the Catalans now set to celebrate at their own Camp Nou on Saturday instead. A Barcelona win there over Levante will wrap up their fourth league triumph in five years and they could even be home and dry before kick-off, if Atletico fail to take a point at home to struggling Real Valladolid earlier in the day. Regardless, success for Ernesto Valverde's side is surely now only a matter of timing given Atletico remain nine points behind the leaders with four games left to play. Real Madrid, who visit Getafe on Thursday, are 16 adrift. If Getafe win, they will also move five points ahead of Valencia, whose chances of snatching fourth place and Champions League qualification would now appear remote. But there will be some satisfaction at least for Atletico in making Barcelona win it on their own terms while also avoiding the embarrassment of conceding the title with a loss in front of their home fans. Angel Correa's stunning strike in the 81st minute proved the winner after Valencia had fought back, Kevin Gameiro and a Dani Parejo penalty twice pulling them level after goals from Morata and Griezmann. Morata's early strike continued his excellent form since his move to Atletico in January, his finish at the back post taking his tally to six goals in 13 games for the club. Griezmann, meanwhile, back from suspension, now has 25 goals in all competitions this season, an impressive return, particularly in a side not renowned for its creativity. Atletico were ahead inside 10 minutes as Juanfran's cross met the outstretched foot of Morata at the back post. It was no less than they deserved for an aggressive opening but Valencia grew into the half and equalised shortly before half-time. Francis Coquelin's crossfield pass picked out Carlos Soler, who cushioned inside to Santi Mina. Mina flicked the ball brilliantly between Diego Godin and Stefan Savic before squaring to Gameiro, who had time to pick his spot. Atletico regrouped during the interval and were back in front four minutes after, Griezmann jumping ahead of Jose Gaya to nod in Thomas Lemar's cross. But Valencia came again and a chaotic contest took another twist when Gameiro's shot was shown by VAR to have been blocked by the arm of Saul Niguez. Parejo powered into the corner. The game was in the balance as Griezmann glanced a header wide before Correa, on as a substitute, provided the winning touch. Thomas Partey played into his feet but Correa did the rest, turning, twisting and then bending the ball inside Neto's left-hand post. Barca will have to wait."
50,04/04/2019,00:08,'It hurts': Valencia inflict first defeat on Zidane's new Madrid,Zinedine Zidane dropped Gareth Bale and endured his first defeat since returning to Real Madrid as his side were deservedly beaten 2-1 by a resurgent Valencia on Wednesday.,"The last time Zidane left Bale on the bench, the Welshman proved a spectacular substitute against Liverpool in the Champions League final 10 months ago but there was to be no rescue act at Mestalla. Instead, Valencia surged to a convincing victory, Goncalo Guedes and Ezequiel Garay scoring in each half to leave Marcelino's team within a point of La Liga's top four. Karim Benzema headed in a late consolation in injury-time. ""We lacked a bit of spark up front,"" Zidane said. ""I am not going to criticise my players. They have tried and we played a good team. But losing always hurts."" After a miserable start to the season, Valencia could yet enjoy a barnstorming finish. Champions League qualification is now within touching distance while a Copa del Rey final against Barcelona and Europa League last 16 tie against Villarreal still await. ""The game played out how we hoped,"" said Marcelino. ""It was a complete performance."" For Zidane, after two opening victories, this was perhaps something of a reality check, even if Madrid's reappointed coach has insisted he is under no illusions regarding the task ahead. They now trail leaders Barcelona by 13 points, the exact same margin they were behind the Catalans under Zidane at this stage last season. This was reminiscent too of the limp displays that have undone Madrid in recent months, blunt in the final third, overly-generous in defence and bereft of either snap or spark in midfield. Bale had started each of Zidane's first two games, offering hope there might yet be a future for him in the new era, but his relegation to the bench suggests the Frenchman's old doubts may linger. Zidane's press conference on Tuesday had been littered with questions about players' futures but Raphael Varane and Marcelo both started in defence, as did Keylor Navas, restored in goal ahead of Zidane's son Luca and the injured Thibaut Courtois. Valencia were far superior in the first half and the only surprise was that it took 35 minutes for them to score. Navas punched a corner to the edge of the box where Guedes bounced the ball off Carlos Soler, stopped it and curled between the goalkeeper's right hand and the near post. Valencia unleashed a series of efforts in search of a second. Kevin Gameiro headed wide, Geoffrey Kondogbia half-volleyed over and Rodrigo's bending shot whistled inches past the post. Madrid had barely featured as Bale came on for Marco Asensio in the 64th minute, along with Isco, who replaced the quiet Toni Kroos. Bale might have had an equaliser shortly after had it not been for Dani Parejo's sliding block and then the he sent a sumptous pass to the far post, but it was cleared away from the waiting Benzema. Valencia should have wrapped it up with 15 minutes left as five sprawled forward on the break but Rodrigo miscontrolled while his cutback was flicked by Soler, harmlessly into the hands of Navas. If Madrid were more threatening they might have capitalised but there was no counter and instead victory was secured when Garay headed in Parejo's cross with seven minutes left. Sergio Ramos had a late penalty taken off him, ruled out by VAR, before Benzema nodded in a consolation in added time. It was too little too late."
51,31/03/2019,18:23,Valencia stay in Champions League hunt,Valencia maintained their hopes of a place in next season's Champions League after Daniel Parejo's penalty on the stroke of half-time gave them a vital 1-0 victory at Sevilla on Sunday.,"Parejo's spot-kick, which came after Ever Banega brought down Jose Gaya, extended Valencia's unbeaten run to nine matches and moves them up to sixth, level on 43 points with Sevilla and just three back from the final Champions League spot. That place is occupied by Getafe, who fell 2-0 at home to mid-table Leganes on Saturday and have to play the league's top three -- leaders Barcelona, Atletico Madrid and Real Madrid -- and Sevilla in their final nine games. Despite a slightly simpler league fixture list Marcelino's Valencia however have an all-Spanish Europa League quarter-final tie with Villarreal to contend with, as well as the Copa Del Rey final against Barcelona between now and the end of the season. Both teams are way behind Real Madrid, who are third and host bottom club Huesca later on Sunday hoping to keep the pressure on neighbours Atletico Madrid in the fight for second after Diego Simeone's side hammered fifth-placed Alaves 4-0 on Saturday. Barcelona are 10 points clear of Atleti and heavy favourites to retain their La Liga after Lionel Messi fired them to their sixth league win on the bounce, 2-0 at home to local rivals Espanyol."

The Premier League giants are bidding for a first trophy under the Italian after losing last month's English League Cup final to Manchester City, and hoping to secure qualification for next season's Champions League. ""We started very well. We wanted to start in this way,"" Sarri told BT Sport. ""We played a wonderful first half and managed the game in the second half."" Giroud, who is yet to start in the Premier League in 2019 after the signing of Gonzalo Higuain, netted a first-half double, before Marcos Alonso slid home a third on the stroke of half-time. Frenchman Giroud completed his first Chelsea hat-trick by heading home Willian's free-kick just before the hour mark and is now the leading scorer in this year's competition with nine goals. Teenage winger Callum Hudson-Odoi continued his own fine Europa League form, slotting in his fourth goal of the tournament after racing clear with 12 minutes remaining. But Sarri reserved special praise for England midfielder Ruben Loftus-Cheek, who also impressed after being given a rare start. ""His potential as a player is very, very, high,"" he said. ""Physically, technically and tactically he is improving. He can become one of the best midfielders not only in England but in Europe."" Elsewhere, Napoli wrapped up a 4-3 aggregate victory over last season's semi-finalists Salzburg despite a 3-1 second-leg loss in Austria. Arkadiusz Milik scored a crucial away goal in the 14th minute to all but end the tie, leaving Salzburg needing five unanswered goals to progress. Munas Dabbur and Fredrik Gulbrandsen struck to give the hosts a glimmer of hope, but Christoph Leitgeb's injury-time third goal was only enough to secure a consolation win on the night. Russian outfit Krasnodar suffered heartbreak in the other early game, as Goncalo Guedes scored a dramatic injury-time equaliser to send Valencia through 3-2 on aggregate after a 1-1 second-leg draw. The 19-year-old Magomed-Shapi Suleymanov's 85th-minute effort looked set to dump out the Spaniards on away goals, but Portugal international Guedes came off the bench to send Valencia through. Marcelino's men have recovered well from a slow start to the season, having also reached the Copa del Rey final and stepped up their bid for a top-four place in La Liga."

58,02/02/2019,20:57,Messi double earns Barca a point in thriller with Valencia,"Lionel Messi scored for a ninth consecutive match, but his latest double on Saturday was only enough to earn Barcelona a 2-2 draw against Valencia.","Kevin Gameiro and Dani Parejo's penalty gave Valencia a surprise two-goal lead but Messi pulled one back with his own spot-kick before curling in a brilliant equaliser with 26 minutes left. After their stunning comeback against Sevilla in midweek, Barca looked destined to again finish the job, but Valencia held on for a point after a breathless contest at the Camp Nou. Messi's 20th and 21st league goals of the season left Barca six points clear of Atletico Madrid, who could cut the gap to three by beating Real Betis on Sunday, with Real Madrid, 11 points back, at home to Alaves. After eight consecutive Barcelona wins in La Liga, this result perhaps offered the chasing pack a little encouragement at the start of a testing month for the Catalans. Real could inflict further disruption themselves. They play Barca in the first leg of the Copa del Rey semi-finals on Wednesday, in what will be the first of three Clasicos in a month. The latter two will be back-to-back, within four days. But with Messi in this sort of form, any confidence from Real comes with an asterisk. His 12 goals in his last nine games is the same number the whole Valencia squad managed in their first 15 league matches. Valencia were 15th in December, with only three wins, and their coach Marcelino was under pressure, just six months after propelling them back into the Champions League. The club kept faith and results have improved. They have now lost only one of their last seven matches and are within sight of the top four. Valencia deserved their first-half lead and could have scored sooner, Parejo drawing a smart save from Marc-Andre ter Stegen before Denis Cheryshev lashed the rebound off the far post. The visitors rode their luck as two decisions went their way in a matter of minutes. First, Barca could have had a penalty when Gabriel Paulista blocked Nelson Semedo's shot with his hand. Then the home team should have had a free-kick as Messi was bundled over by Parejo. The latter proved key, with Valencia sprawling forward on the counter-attack. Rodrigo carried the ball 40 yards before slipping a cute reverse pass behind Vermaelen. Gameiro banged in the finish. Valencia's penalty was clear after Sergi shoved Daniel Wass in the back, with Parejo whipping the ball into the corner to make it two. Barca looked shell-shocked but the third goal in 15 minutes was theirs. Semedo beat Toni Lato to Arturo Vidal's pass and tumbled after a clip on his shin. Messi slammed the loose ball into the top corner but the whistle had blown. He rolled in the penalty instead. Sergi's shot crashed against the post and Barca were dominant after half-time. Messi and Carles Alena had shots saved, and Messi headed over. At the other end, on a rare Valencia break, Rodrigo should have made it three but, on the stretch, put it over from six yards. That was in the 63rd minute, and in the 64th, Barcelona were level. Vidal teed up Messi, who teed up his own left foot and curled the ball inside the post. The teams, and the crowd, seemed to take a breath, in anticipation of a late push, but it never came. The draw was a fair result."
59,30/01/2019,20:09,Korea's Lee Kang-in joins Valencia first team,"Valencia have promoted South Korean teenager Lee Kang-in to their Liga first team, the Spanish club announced on Wednesday.","Lee, who turns 18 next month, will make the step-up after playing for Valencia's reserve team, VCF Mestalla. ""Valencia CF have registered Kang-in Lee on Wednesday as a new player of the first team squad,"" a club statement read. ""The young Korean footballer will wear the number 16 shirt."" After joining Valencia's youth set-up in 2011, Lee signed a permanent contract last summer until 2022. He made his senior debut in October, in a 2-1 win over CD Ebro in the Copa del Rey, and then appeared in La Liga earlier this month, against Real Valladolid and Villarreal, both times as a substitute. He will now join Marcelino's squad on a regular basis as Valencia, sitting seventh, look to break into the Champions League qualification places."
60,30/01/2019,00:27,Rodrigo treble inspires stunning Valencia Copa del Rey fightback,Rodrigo scored a hat-trick as Valencia staged a stunning late fightback at the Mestalla to stun ten-man Getafe 3-2 on aggregate to reach the Copa del Rey semi-finals on Tuesday.,"Valencia went into the game looking to fight back after a 1-0 first-leg defeat and keep alive their hopes of winning a first major title since lifting the Copa del Rey 11 years ago. And Rodrigo's treble, including two injury-time strikes, sent Marcelino's men into a semi-final clash with either Real Madrid and Girona after a thrilling 3-1 second-leg victory. ""We have shown impressive character,"" Rodrigo told BeIN Sports. ""We believed until the end, because of the support of the fans and because we were superior on the pitch, which is where football matters."" The home side's hopes were dashed inside the very first minute as Jorge Molina, who scored the only goal of the first game last week, put the visitors ahead. Needing to win by two clear goals to progress, Valencia gave themselves hope of a comeback as Rodrigo levelled just after the hour mark, before Getafe centre-back Djene Dakonam was dismissed for a second yellow card with 16 minutes still to play. Spain striker Rodrigo was on a one-man mission to pull Valencia through, netting again in the 92nd and 93rd minutes to stun Getafe. The match dragged into a ninth minute of added time, but Valencia held on to close out a barely believable win. ""It's a great night for Valencia,"" said Marcelino, whose side have recovered from a poor start to the season and now sit seventh in La Liga. ""We pinned the opposition back in the first half and continued it in the second."" On Wednesday, holders Barcelona host last season's runners-up Sevilla looking to overturn a 2-0 first-leg deficit, before Real Madrid take a 4-2 lead to Girona on Thursday."
61,20/12/2018,20:43,Barcelona sign Colombian defender Murillo on loan,"Barcelona have signed Colombian international centre-back Jeison Murillo on loan from Valencia until the end of the season, the two clubs announced on Thursday.","The La Liga leaders have struggled defensively this season, conceding 19 goals in 11 league games before a run of three consecutive clean sheets, while also losing defenders Samuel Umtiti and Thomas Vermaelen to injuries. Barcelona said that they will have an option to make the deal for Murillo permanent in June for 25 million euros ($28.7 million). Spanish media reported that Barca coach Ernesto Valverde had made a special request for the club to sign Murillo, despite the 26-year-old having played only one La Liga match all season. Murillo has played 27 times for Colombia and has previously spent two years at Inter Milan."
62,13/12/2018,00:09,Manchester United through as runners-up after limp defeat to Valencia,Manchester United squandered the chance to win their Champions League group on Wednesday after a lacklustre display got what it deserved in a 2-1 defeat to Valencia.,"Already through to the last 16, Jose Mourinho made eight changes at the Mestalla, including a return for Paul Pogba, but United were largely outplayed by their Spanish opponents, who sit 15th in La Liga. After the game, Mourinho seemed to aim a dig at those players to have come in. ""Nothing surprised me at all,"" he said. Carlos Soler's driven shot and a Phil Jones own-goal put Valencia two up early in the second half before United came alive in the final minutes after Marcus Rashford's header gave them brief hope. Perhaps Mourinho and his players had assumed Juventus would win away at Young Boys but the Italians' surprise 2-1 loss meant United had first place within their grasp. Instead, they go through as runners-up into Monday's draw for the last 16, with Real Madrid, Barcelona, Bayern Munich, Paris Saint-Germain, Borussia Dortmund and Porto all potential opponents. As group winners, they would have had Atletico Madrid, Roma, Schalke, Ajax or Lyon. ""Apart from a couple of clubs that are clearly much better than the others, I don't think the draw will be significantly different,"" Mourinho said. ""There are teams that finish second that the ones that finish first will not be happy to play against."" Porto would probably be the favoured pick but on this evidence, they might feel the same about United. After all, Valencia also made changes, eight of them, with their fate resigned to dropping into the Europa League. Valencia had failed to score in six of their previous eight Champions League games while poor form in La Liga has their coach Marcelino fighting for his future. After drawing against Sevilla last weekend, their fans swung white handkerchiefs in the air to demonstrate their dissatisfaction. ""We needed this winning feeling back in our game,"" said Marcelino afterwards. Pogba, left out against Arsenal and Fulham, started here but contributed little, save for a glaring miss in the first half. Eric Bailly also came in but his partnership with Jones was rocky all night. United made Valencia look like world-beaters in the opening 45 minutes. They were slow in possession and just as sluggish out of it. Frustration bubbled and burst, as a handful of tackles flew in and missed. Valencia were excellent. Geoffrey Kondogbia and Dani Parejo both went close early on before another pinball session in the penalty area saw the ball land at the feet of Soler. He looked up, picked his spot and drove into the far corner. Michy Batshuayi should have made it two but headed over and Mouctar Diakhaby could have had a penalty when denied a simple finish by the clambering Marouane Fellaini. United had the occasional opening, the best of them falling to Pogba, who somehow stabbed wide after Fellaini's header offered him a tap-in from two yards at the back post. Jones marched off at half-time shaking his head, having berated his midfield for failing to track back, but the interval brought no relief. Almost as soon as they restarted, Romelu Lukaku misread a Bailly pass. Just as others had before, Bailly threw his arms up in frustration. Soon after it was two, Soler's pass landing between Sergio Romero and Jones, with Batshuayi on the chase. Jones panicked, met the ball on the slide, and pushed it past his approaching goalkeeper and into his own net. There were 43 minutes left but a United comeback never looked likely until Rashford, on as a substitute, headed home in the 87th minute. Jesse Lingard had done well to keep the ball alive before Ashley Young supplied the cross. Juan Mata could even have equalised. Pogba's scooped ball over the top left him alone in front of goal but he missed the ball as he tried to volley on the turn. A point would have been more than United deserved."
63,13/12/2018,00:08,Mourinho says 'nothing' surprised him about Valencia defeat,"Jose Mourinho said ""nothing surprised"" him about Manchester United's miserable performance against Valencia on Wednesday but dismissed the potential impact of them finishing second in their group.","United were beaten 2-1, a result made all the more disappointing given they could have gone through top of Group H following Juventus' surprise loss to Young Boys. Defeat, however, was nothing more than Mourinho's side deserved, as a line-up that included eight changes and a return for Paul Pogba delivered a sluggish display at Mestalla. ""I didn't learn anything at all,"" Mourinho said. ""Nothing surprised me at all."" United go through as runners-up into Monday's draw for the last 16, with Barcelona, Borussia Dortmund, Paris Saint-Germain, Porto, Real Madrid and Bayern Munich their potential opponents in the next round. Finishing first would have earned them a tie against one of Atletico Madrid, Roma, Schalke, Ajax and Lyon. ""I think to qualify in this group is a success, never a failure. To finish second in this group is always a success,"" Mourinho said. ""Before the game I told the players if we win and Juve win, we did our job. If we don't win and Juve don't win we can blame ourselves. ""Apart from a couple of clubs that are clearly much better than the others, I don't think the draw will be significantly different. ""There are teams that finish second that the ones that finish first will not be happy to play against."" Mourinho said his team only improved after he made three changes he ""didn't want to make"", as Marcus Rashford, who scored United's goal, Jesse Lingard and Ashley Young were all introduced in the second half. Sergio Romero, Antonio Valencia, Eric Bailly, Marcos Rojo, Marouane Fellaini, Andreas Pereira, Fred and Pogba were the eight players to come into the starting line-up. Jones scored an own-goal just after the break to double Valencia's lead after Carlos Soler had put the home side ahead in the 17th minute. Rashford gave United hope with an 87th-minute header but it proved too little too late. Mourinho said injuries forced him into all his changes, except for the decision to rest David de Gea and Nemanja Matic. ""If I play to win the group, I would have played a similar team,"" said Mourinho, who added that Rashford, Lingard and Young will all start against Liverpool in the Premier League on Sunday."
64,12/12/2018,19:44,Valencia forward Guedes faces surgery and lengthy absence,"Portugal and Valencia forward Goncalo Guedes will have surgery on a groin injury on Friday and could be out of action for up to two months, the La Liga club announced on Wednesday.","The 22-year-old, who joined Valencia from Paris Saint-Germain in the close-season after a successful campaign on loan at the Mestalla last season, has been struggling with a pubalgia, commonly known as a sports hernia. His form has dipped this term, failing to score in 14 appearances. Marcelino's Valencia have been disappointing so far this season, having finished fourth in La Liga to qualify for the Champions League seven months ago. They sit 15th in the Spanish top flight after winning just three of 15 matches, and will drop into the Europa League last 32 after a Champions League group-stage elimination."
65,12/12/2018,00:14,"Lyon reach Champions League last 16, Bayern top group","Lyon clinched the final Champions League last-16 place as Nabil Fekir's second-half strike grabbed a 1-1 draw against Shakhtar Donetsk in a snowy Kiev on Wednesday, while Bayern Munich pipped Ajax to top spot in Group E.","Bruno Genesio's Lyon needed to avoid defeat against Shakhtar to progress from Group F with Manchester City, and a fifth successive draw in the competition achieved that aim. ""It was hard in difficult conditions. We gave ourselves a fright and it's a pity we didn't kill off the game in the first half,"" Lyon midfielder Houssem Aouar told RMC Sport. ""The main thing is that we've qualified."" Shakhtar forged ahead midway through the opening period with what proved their only shot of the first half, just seconds after Lyon forward Bertrand Traore had been denied by Andriy Pyatov when clean through one-on-one with the goalkeeper. The Burkina Faso international was made to pay for his profligacy, as Junior Moraes slotted home after being picked out by Ismaily. Lyon continued to dominate, though, and finally equalised in the 65th minute as Nabil Fekir hammered a left-footed strike into the top corner following excellent play by Memphis Depay. Man City wrapped up top spot in the group by coming from behind to beat Hoffenheim 2-1 at the Etihad Stadium. Andrej Kramaric gave Hoffenheim a surprise 16th-minute lead from the penalty spot, although Leroy Sane levelled on the stroke of half-time with a magnificent free-kick. City wasted a host of chances, with away goalkeeper Oliver Baumann in inspired form, but Sane grabbed his second just after the hour mark to complete the turnaround. Bayern Munich went into their game at Ajax just needing a point to beat their opponents to first place in Group E, and Niko Kovac's men did just that in a thrilling 3-3 draw. The game burst into life in the second half when Dusan Tadic equalised Robert Lewandowski's early opener just after the hour mark, with Ajax defender Maximilian Woeber sent off in the 67th minute for a dangerous lunge on Leon Goretzka. But Bayern were also reduced to 10 men only eight minutes later, as Thomas Mueller was given his marching orders for planting his studs into the head of Nicolas Tagliafico. Ajax briefly moved top of the live standings when Jerome Boateng carelessly conceded a penalty, which was dispatched emphatically into the roof of the net by Tadic. But Tagliafico brought down Thiago Alcantara, with Lewandowski slotting in the spot-kick, before Kingsley Coman looked to have settled matters with a wonderful 90th-minute strike. Tagliafico went up the other end to equalise again, but Ajax failed to find a winner as Bayern just about held on. ""That was an advert for football,"" smiled Kovac. ""The most important thing was to finish top of the group and with 14 from 18 points we are happy."" Juventus finished at the Group H summit ahead of Manchester United despite slumping to a 2-1 defeat by Young Boys in Bern, as Jose Mourinho's Premier League giants lost at Valencia. United had to beat Valencia and hope Juve failed to win in Switzerland, but Carlos Soler and a comical Phil Jones own goal did the damage for the visitors, with Marcus Rashford scoring a late consolation. ""I didn't learn anything at all,"" Mourinho said. ""Nothing surprised me at all."" Guillaume Hoarau netted twice to help Young Boys end their European campaign on a high note. CSKA Moscow stunned a much-changed Real Madrid with a 3-0 victory at the Santiago Bernabeu, but still finished bottom of Group G as Viktoria Plzen beat Roma. The Russian side, who also downed Real 1-0 in the reverse fixture, had to better Plzen's result to finish third and qualify for the Europa League. But Plzen edged out Roma 2-1 in the Czech Republic to render CSKA's famous victory ultimately meaningless, despite inflicting the heaviest ever European home loss on the record 13-time champions. ""It's sad to say the least to beat Real Madrid, earn seven points, but finish bottom and get eliminated from Europe,"" said CSKA coach Viktor Goncharenko. Holders Real had already progressed to the last 16 as group winners, with Roma through in second place. Home coach Santiago Solari boosted CSKA's hopes before kick-off by making seven changes to his starting XI, and goals from Fedor Chalov, Georgiy Schennikov and Arnor Sigurdsson gave CSKA a comprehensive win."
66,11/12/2018,21:07,Mourinho calls on Pogba to lead by example in Valencia,Jose Mourinho has called on Paul Pogba to show what he is capable of on his return to the Manchester United side for Wednesday's Champions League trip to Valencia.,"It is a sign of the French World Cup winner's fall from grace in a difficult season for United that Mourinho confirmed he will start among a much-changed side at the Mestalla with qualification for the last 16 already assured for the visitors. Pogba has been dropped by Mourinho for United's last two Premier League games as a frosty relationship between the pair has sparked speculation over both mens' futures at United. ""I'm looking for him to play well and to have a good impact in the game and a good impact in the team - a team with many players that don't have many miles in their legs,"" said Mourinho on Monday. ""A team with some players that are not playing a lot, so I hope that people like Paul and a couple of others that are normally in the team and they have that number of miles that players need to be at that top level, I hope he can have a good impact on the team."" However, Mourinho turned on reporters when asked why he has failed to get the best out of Pogba -- who cost United a then world record £89 million in 2016. ""I don't think your question goes in the direction of what I want to answer or listen (to),"" Mourinho added. ""I don't like your question. ""You can put the question from another direction, I don't like the direction."" Mourinho named teenagers Mason Greenwood and James Garner among his squad that travelled to Spain. But the Portuguese coach confirmed neither would start. ""The kids won't start the match. Garner will be on the bench, and Mason is the protection player, in case we have any injuries,"" he added."
67,01/12/2018,22:54,Madrid back to winning ways under Solari after Valencia victory,Real Madrid's revival under Santiago Solari appears to be back on track after they moved up to fifth in La Liga with a 2-0 win over Valencia on Saturday.,"An own-goal from Valencia's Daniel Wass gave Madrid an early lead before Lucas Vazquez added a late second to wrap up their sixth win in seven games under their new coach. The 3-0 thrashing by Eibar last weekend, in Solari's first official game in charge, had placed the depth of the recovery in doubt but this was another assured display to back up an impressive Champions League win over Roma in midweek. Madrid move two points behind Barcelona and only three adrift of leaders Sevilla, albeit with both still to play on Sunday. Valencia stay 13th. Marcelino's side, attempting a comeback of sorts themselves after a poor start to the season, offered disappointingly little, save for a 20-minute spell at the start of the second half. Otherwise, Madrid controlled the contest and while Gareth Bale's league drought stretched to 10 games, his longest ever, the Welshman played a lead role in an energetic and fluid team performance. The Santiago Bernabeu was almost packed out, eight days before Boca Juniors and River Plate are due to play here in the postponed second leg of the Copa Libertadores final. With La Liga still pushing for Barcelona's game against Girona to be staged in Miami, there was perhaps something to be savoured in two Spanish teams, in a Spanish competition, playing in a Spanish stadium. Isco is one of Spain's primary talents but is still to be picked in a starting line-up by Solari. This was the midfielder's seventh consecutive game out of the side and while he came on to cheers, 10 minutes with Madrid already ahead were only crumbs for comfort. Bale seemed more pinned to the left wing than he has been for a long time and he rolled back the years with a straight run down the line before whipping in an early cross. Karim Benzema's ambitious volley sailed just wide. Madrid had made much the better start and in the eighth minute, took the lead. Wass headed into his own net but Dani Carvajal led the celebrations. He kept the ball alive before rummaging past Gabriel Paulista and Jose Gaya. The flicked cross gave Wass too little time to react. Valencia made hardly any impact on the half, pressed and harried into submission. Neto skewed a clearance under pressure to Dani Ceballos, whose shot was blocked, but then made up for his error by denying Bale from close range. Fortunate only to be one behind, Valencia improved after the break. Santi Mina blazed over with only Thibaut Courtois to beat. Gaya's cutback was slightly misplaced. Paulista volleyed over on the stretch from three yards. Bale was replaced by Marco Asensio and, once on the bench, seemed to signal some discomfort with his right thigh. After some slick exchanges down the right, Asensio should have given Madrid breathing space but his finish was blocked by Ezequiel Garay. Isco came off the bench in the 80th minute and played a part in the second goal. Carvajal was again the instigator, however, setting off on a barnstorming break forward before exchanging with Isco and crossing. Benzema did well to pick out Vazquez, who poked home to complete a convincing win."
68,28/11/2018,05:06,Ronaldo hits 100 Champions League wins as Juventus soar into last 16,Juventus coach Massimiliano Allegri hailed the impact Cristiano Ronaldo was having on the Italian champions as the Portuguese star became the first player to achieve 100 Champions League wins in Tuesday's 1-0 success over Valencia that clinched their passage to the knockout rounds.,"""Ronaldo gives us a sense of security and confidence,"" said Allegri of the beaten finalists in two of the last four editions of the elite European competition. ""The team is essentially the same as last season. We've grown, become faster in playing the ball, but then of course, there is Cristiano Ronaldo. ""This team is constantly improving - they're passing and putting play together more quickly."" Ronaldo -- who joined Juventus last summer from Real Madrid -- is targeting a sixth Champions League title to add to his four with the Spanish team and one with Manchester United. The Italian team are looking for their third European title and first since 1995. Last season they exited in the quarter-finals to Ronaldo's Real Madrid. The 33-year-old played a key role against Valencia providing the assist on 59 minutes which Croatian Mario Mandzukic tapped in for his third goal in as many matches. Juventus had needed just a point to ensure qualification. Their win combined with Manchester United's late 1-0 win over Young Boys at Old Trafford means Valencia crash out of the competition. Allegri's side will now have to wait to see whether they top Group H when they play their final group game mid-December in Bern against Young Boys. Ronaldo came out firing on all cylinders after his controversial red card during his first Champions League game for Juventus in Valencia back in September, which Allegri's side still won 2-0. The five-time Ballon d'Or winner had two chances within the first three minutes to add to his record tally of 121 Champions League goals. Valencia had their best chance before the break when Mouctar Diakhaby's header off a corner was punched out with one hand by Juventus goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny. Just before the hour mark, Ronaldo broke free of Valencia defender Gabriel and with some fancy footwork fired low across the face of the goal leaving Mandzukic to finish off. Valencia thought they had scored the equaliser two minutes later but Diakhaby's header was ruled to have come off his hand. Valenica goalkeeper Neto kept out a late goal-bound header from Ronaldo, who rose to meet Paulo Dybala's out-swinging corner. ""You can see how united we are including the forwards,"" said Juventus captain Giorgio Chiellini. ""All three of them - Ronaldo, Mandzukic and Dybala, really put themselves about today. If we scrap like that, with the skill we have in the side, it makes everything much easier. ""We have to turn the page now - we'll start thinking about the Champions League again in February. We must focus on Serie A because we have a tough month ahead,"" added the defender as the league leaders target an eighth consecutive domestic title. ""The match was decided by great play by Cristiano,"" said Valencia coach Marcelino Garcia, ""but out team gave everything, showing great spirit against one of the best teams in Europe."""
69,07/11/2018,23:16,Mina scores twice as Valencia beat Young Boys for rare home win,Valencia kept the pressure on Manchester United in Champions League Group H by beating Young Boys 3-1 on Wednesday as the Spanish side registered their first home win of the season.,"Carlos Soler, the talented 21-year-old, teed up two Santi Mina strikes in the first half before finding the net himself to seal a rare win for a team whose season has so far been ravaged by draws. Young Boys levelled when Roger Assale drove into the corner but parity lasted only five minutes, as Mina restored Valencia's lead towards the end of the first half. Any faint hopes of a Swiss comeback were dashed when Sekou Sanogo was sent off with 13 minutes remaining for a wild challenge on Francis Coquelin. It was the culmination of a feisty encounter that featured five yellow cards in the first half alone, a record in this year's tournament. For Valencia, victory was all-important to their hopes of reaching the knock-out stage as they now sit two points behind United, who later snatched a shock 2-1 win over Juventus in Turin. That trip awaits Valencia next but they have the advantage of hosting Jose Mourinho's side at the Mestalla in the final group game, if they can stay in touch that long. ""We wanted to keep alive our chance of continuing in this tournament and for that we had to win,"" coach Marcelino said. ""It is wonderful to see the players laugh again."" After clinching fourth place in La Liga last season, victories and goals have both been hard to come by for Valencia this term. They sit 15th in the league, with eight draws from 11 games, while in Europe, they had managed just one goal from 42 shots coming into this match. It was the first time they had scored three goals in a game since March. Young Boys, however, were generous in defence, while Soler and Mina showed the sort of ruthlessness up front that has been so lacking in recent weeks. Solari, a former youth player at Valencia, said: ""When I was aged about 11, I helped take the UEFA symbol out to the centre circle and shake it during the anthem. I dreamed I'd play here and score in this competition - now I have."" The first goal came after 14 minutes as the lively Rodrigo Moreno picked out Soler's darting run in behind. Soler did brilliantly to chip the goalkeeper but there was a hint of fortune in the ball rebounding back off the far post and landing perfectly for Mina to bundle home. Young Boys looked dangerous on the break and Assale missed an excellent chance before taking a far more difficult one in the 37th minute. He rolled his studs over the ball before drilling it through the legs of Gabriel Paulista and into the far corner. Valencia quickly restored their advantage. Soler's first-time cross caught the Young Boys defence by surprise and Mina poked into the net on the stretch. The visitors should have pulled level again but Moumi Ngamaleu sidefooted high when free at the back post and Valencia made them pay after the interval. Soler skipped free after a neat one-two with Rodrigo and with no challenge, drove into the box, before unleashing a shot into the corner. Valencia were home and dry but Sanogo made sure with a rash tackle on Coquelin that was high and mistimed. Coquelin was eventually able to continue as Valencia held on to sustain their hopes of reaching the last 16."
70,23/10/2018,21:36,Young Boys pick up first point in Valencia draw,Guillaume Hoarau's second-half penalty earned Young Boys their first Champions League point on Tuesday after a 1-1 draw with Valencia in Bern.,"Michy Batshuayi gave Valencia the lead on 26 minutes in the Group H clash, but former France striker Hoarau converted from the spot as Young Boys also scored their first goal in the competition. The Swiss champions nearly snatched victory late on at the Stade de Suisse but Valencia goalkeeper Neto pulled off a superb save to divert Sekou Sanogo's header onto the post. Young Boys remain at the bottom of the group, while Valencia's bid to qualify for the last 16 ahead of Manchester United or Juventus suffered a blow with the Spanish club on two points after three games. Valencia, now with just eight goals in 12 matches this term, were unable to fully exploit a Young Boys defence featuring 36-year-old Champions League debutant Marco Wolfli in goal and missing the suspended Mohamed Ali Camara. Marcelino's side moved in front when Chelsea loanee Batshuayi gathered a pass from Carlos Soler and rounded Wolfli to slot home his second goal for Valencia. Young Boys right-back Kevin Mbabu dragged an effort narrowly wide of the right upright minutes into the second half, with Christian Fassnacht then unable to generate enough power in his header to beat Neto. The Swiss side's sustained pressure paid off though as they were awarded a penalty on 55 minutes when Valencia captain Dani Parejo brought down Djibril Sow in the area. It was the second spot-kick conceded by Parejo in three games in Europe, and after Hoarau fired the hosts level only the brilliance of Neto allowed a struggling Valencia to hold on for a draw. The Brazilian turned behind a low strike from Fassnacht shortly after the Young Boys equaliser, but saved his best for last with a marvellous fingertip stop to deny Sanogo before he smothered the rebound at the feet of Roger Assale."
71,07/10/2018,23:44,Barcelona held at Valencia as Sevilla go top in Spain,Sevilla are the surprise leaders in La Liga after Lionel Messi could only rescue a draw for Barcelona away to Valencia on Sunday.,"Barca started the day at the top of the pile and then Atletico Madrid enjoyed a couple of hours at the summit after edging past Real Betis at the Wanda Metropolitano. Sevilla, however, usurped them both by beating 10-man Celta Vigo and Barca were unable to reclaim the lead in the late kick-off, held by Valencia to a 1-1 draw at the Mestalla. It means Ernesto Valverde's side are a point behind Sevilla and without a league victory now in four matches, a dip that comes in stark contrast to their enthralling triumph over Tottenham in the Champions League on Wednesday. Messi, mesmeric at Wembley, was on target again, his driven shot into the corner cancelling out a bizarre opener for Valencia, scored after just 78 seconds. Ezequiel Garay claimed the final touch but Daniel Parejo's corner had been flicked on by Geoffrey Kondogbia, missed by Thomas Vermaelen and skimmed through off Gerard Pique's back. Philippe Coutinho should have won it for Barcelona in the second half but took too long to pull the trigger and Jose Gaya was able to make the block. ""When we don't win we always think of it as two points lost,"" Valverde said. ""After Leo's goal, we tried everything but they defended well and we couldn't get the goal we wanted."" For Valencia, now unbeaten in six, this was another step in the right direction, even if they are finding it difficult to turn draws into wins. They move up to 14th. ""Leaving Barca for 90 minutes practically without a chance means that we have worked very well,"" Valencia coach Marcelino said. Atletico and Sevilla's success also pushed struggling Real Madrid down to fourth. Julen Lopetegui's side endured a shock defeat away by Alaves on Saturday. For all the talk of crisis at the top two clubs, however, this was Sevilla's day. Pablo Sarabia headed in to open the scoring at the Ramon Sanchez Pizjuan before Celta defender Nestor Araujo was sent off for picking up two yellow cards in as many minutes. Wissam Ben Yedder doubled the lead and while substitute Sofiane Boufal pulled one back for Celta, it proved too little to late. The victory is Sevilla's fourth on the bounce in the league. ""At the the moment we are playing with a lot of confidence,"" Ben Yedder said. ""We are showing we can be consistent."" Atletico had earlier continued their own strong run after Angel Correa's goal proved decisive in an untidy 1-0 win over Real Betis. Atletico sat seven points behind Real and Barca after winning only one of their opening four league games but as their rivals have stumbled, Diego Simeone's side have sprung into form. ""We look at everything quietly and continue to improve,"" Simeone said. ""We have grown."" Simeone can take some of the credit too for the latest victory, after throwing on both Correa and Thomas Partey as substitutes in the second half. Thomas provided the assist. ""When the players respond, the coaches look better,"" Simeone said. ""The teams that challenge up the top of the table are there because of the players they can bring off the bench."" The contest was billed as a classic clash of styles, with Atletico's stubborn defence up against the free-flowing Real Betis, who lit up the league last season with their flurry of goals. ""A great coach once said, the best Plan B is always to do Plan A better,"" said Betis coach Quique Setien. They could also have gone top with a win, such is the scrunched nature of the top half, but instead Betis slip to eighth. ""We have less points than our performances deserve,"" Setien added."
72,02/10/2018,23:11,Mourinho's Man Utd misfire once more in Valencia stalemate,Manchester United failed to relieve the mounting pressure on manager Jose Mourinho with another insipid attacking display in a 0-0 draw at home to Valencia in the Champions League on Tuesday.,"Already nine points adrift of Premier League leaders Manchester City and Liverpool after three defeats in seven league games, Mourinho was hoping for a reaction from Saturday's dreadful display in losing 3-1 to West Ham United. Instead, his side again looked devoid of ideas and invention to draw a blank and fall two points behind Group H leaders Juventus with two games against the Italian champions to come. A point does at least consolidate United's position three points ahead of Valencia in second place, with Swiss champions Young Boys looking like the whipping boys of the group after a second 3-0 defeat in two games, this time against Juventus earlier on Tuesday. Kick-off was delayed by five minutes as United were held up by traffic that meant Mourinho's men didn't arrive at the stadium until less than 45 minutes ahead of the planned 8pm (1900GMT) start time. However, it took far longer for the game to come alive after a drab first half that summed up both sides' struggles so far this season. Mourinho recalled Alexis Sanchez, who hadn't even made the bench for Saturday's defeat, among four changes from the weekend. But it was Marcus Rashford on the opposite flank who was United's biggest threat as the Chilean again disappointed before being replaced 15 minutes from time. Rashford fired wide from the edge of the area and had another long-range effort comfortably handled by Neto early on. In a recurring theme of United's decline over the past few months, though, there seemed little cohesive attacking plan other than a series of long balls hurled towards Romelu Lukaku. Valencia registered their first win of the Spanish season at the seventh attempt at Real Sociedad on Saturday, but the Spaniards' struggles to score goals were also obvious despite enjoying plenty of possession. Goncalo Guedes enjoyed most of Valencia's openings, but the Portuguese has still yet to score since making his loan move from Paris Saint-Germain permanent in August. Guedes fired off target when well-placed on the edge of the area either side of half-time as Valencia started the second half brightly. That prompted chants of ""attack, attack, attack"" from a disgruntled home faithful. United duly responded as Paul Pogba's shot was deflected wide before a free-kick from the Frenchman finally forced Neto into his first serious save. Valencia failed to take advantage of Cristiano Ronaldo's early red card in losing 2-0 to Juventus on matchday one and could yet regret not cashing in with all three points against a misfiring United side. Michy Batshuayi blasted the visitors' best chance over from close range, before Guedes miscontrolled when clean through on goal. At the other end Neto did well to turn a Lukaku effort behind before Sanchez's lack of confidence was laid bare when he took a touch too many inside the Valencia box and was crowded out. That was his last involvement as Mourinho's decision to replace the former Arsenal forward with Anthony Martial was cheered by the United fans. Rashford came closest to breaking the deadlock with a free-kick from a narrow angle that clipped the crossbar, but a winner would have been more than either side deserved."
73,02/10/2018,20:20,Mourinho recalls Sanchez for Valencia showdown,Under-fire Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho recalled Alexis Sanchez among four changes to the side that slumped to a 3-1 defeat at West Ham United for Wednesday's Champions League clash against Valencia.,"Sanchez didn't even make the bench at the London Stadium on Saturday as he paid for failing to score so far this season and for a poor return of just three goals in 23 games since joining United in January. However, Anthony Martial is dropped after failing to take his chance to impress as Sanchez and Marcus Rashford return in attack alongside Romelu Lukaku. Paul Pogba keeps his place despite being substituted at the weekend and his ongoing feud with Mourinho, but Ashley Young, Scott McTominay and Victor Lindelof also drop out to make way for Antonio Valencia and Eric Bailly. Chelsea loanee Michy Batshuayi starts alongside Spanish international Rodrigo in attack for Valencia as the Spaniards try to pile more misery on Mourinho and make amends for opening their Champions League campaign with a 2-0 defeat against 10-man Juventus."
74,01/10/2018,17:35,Some 'care more than others' about Man Utd crisis - Mourinho,"Under-fire Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho believes some of his misfiring squad ""care more than others"" as speculation mounts over whether the Portuguese coach's time in charge at Old Trafford is coming to an end.","A third defeat in seven Premier League games at West Ham on Saturday saw United fall nine points adrift of leaders and fierce rivals Manchester City and Liverpool. Ahead of Tuesday's Champions League clash with Valencia, Mourinho insisted he doesn't fear for his job but refused to state whether he had met with the club's executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward in the past few days. Mourinho also defended his players from accusations of not trying hard enough, but believes some are taking a slump in form more to heart than others. ""I think that some care more than others,"" said Mourinho. ""After 20 years of football, I'm still the kid I was. I'm still naive, but I still don't believe that a player is not honest. ""Until somebody that was a big professional player says 'I was a dishonest player', I will always believe the players are honest players and want to give their best."" Mourinho also laughed off speculation he has been contacted by former Real Madrid boss Zinedine Zidane, the favourite to replace him in the Old Trafford hot seat if Mourinho is dismissed. A report in The Sun newspaper on Monday claimed Zidane had phoned Mourinho to reassure him the Frenchman isn't plotting to take his job. When asked about the story, Mourinho turned the tables on the journalist who wrote the story by telling reporters to ask him whether the story was true and joked his phone had been bugged. Zidane resigned as Madrid coach in June after leading the Spanish giants to three consecutive Champions League titles. United left-back Luke Shaw said the players have to take more responsibility for a poor start to the campaign, rather than Mourinho proving to be the fall guy. However, Mourinho accepted his share of the blame as a switch to a back three with midfielder Scott McTominay operating as a central defender backfired at West Ham. ""The performance on the pitch in my opinion is the consequence of many factors,"" added Mourinho. ""Luke Shaw for example said something I agree (with), but don't agree totally (with) because I am part of it and other persons are part of it: 'We players on the pitch we have to perform, we have to give more'. ""I like that perspective but I don't agree totally. It's all of us, everybody has a role to play. ""When we lose, the responsibility is the responsibility of everyone. I will improve things that depend from me and my work."" Mourinho's public spat with star midfielder Paul Pogba has been another sideshow to a stuttering season. Pogba was stripped of the vice-captaincy last week, but one of Mourinho's most trusted lieutenants, Nemanja Matic, believes leadership is about how you perform on the pitch, rather than wearing the armband. ""For me if you talk in the dressing room it doesn't mean anything,"" said the Serb, who followed Mourinho from Chelsea to United. ""The most important (thing) is what you show on the pitch."" And Matic admitted he too fell well below his normal standards at the weekend. ""For me, I played one of the worst games since I signed for Man Utd. I look in the mirror at my mistakes and want to do better."""
75,20/09/2018,22:48,Can sorry for 'we're not women' blast over Ronaldo red card,"Juventus midfielder Emre Can apologised on Thursday after saying ""we're not women, let's play football"" in response to teammate Cristiano Ronaldo being sent off in the Champions League win at Valencia.","Portuguese star Ronaldo was left in tears after receiving a red card for clashing with defender Jeison Murillo in the 29th minute of Wednesday's game which the Italian champions eventually won 2-0. Speaking to DAZN sports streaming network, 24-year-old Can was quoted as saying: ""I just found out it (the red card) was because he pulled Murillo's hair. We're not women, let's play football."" Can issued a statement Thursday, insisting the remarks were not meant to be derogatory. ""I would like to take a moment to clear the air regarding the comments I made after last night's game. My response after seeing the video footage of Cristiano's sending off seemed to have caused some commotion,"" the German international wrote on Twitter. ""I would like to state that the comments made were never focused on nor meant to degrade women, women's football or equality in any form. Everyone who knows me knows about my respect for women, equality and respect. ""My intention was to stick up for my teammate regarding a wrong decision which could have affected our game. I sincerely apologise if any of the comments I made have caused any harm."""
76,20/09/2018,19:15,Ronaldo red card to be reviewed by UEFA next week,"UEFA have opened a disciplinary case over Cristiano Ronaldo's red card in the Champions League which will be assessed on September 27, European football's governing body said Thursday.","Ronaldo was sent off in the 29th minute of Wednesday's 2-0 win away to Valencia after a tussle with defender Jeison Murillo, with the former Real Madrid star leaving the pitch in tears. The Portugal captain fell to the ground in disbelief and then yelled into the air in frustration, although Juventus overcame his dismissal thanks to a pair of Miralem Pjanic penalties. It was the 11th red card of Ronaldo's career, but first in the Champions League, and will see him miss Juve's next group game against Swiss side Young Boys in Turin. He will find out next week whether his one-match ban is extended. An increase would also rule him out of a return to Old Trafford to face former club Manchester United. Ronaldo's arrival at Juventus has raised expectations of a first Champions League title since 1996, with share prices peaking at a record 1.8046 euros on the stock market Thursday before closing at 1.581 euros. It represented an increase of more than 180% since late June when rumours began circulating of Ronaldo's arrival at the club, with shares then trading at 0.64 euros."
77,19/09/2018,23:09,Ronaldo sent off but 10-man Juventus ease past Valencia,"Juventus believe they can win the Champions League with Cristiano Ronaldo, but they had to start by beating Valencia 2-0 without him after he was controversially sent off on his debut in the competition for the Italian champions on Wednesday.","A tearful Ronaldo left the pitch in disbelief in the 29th minute, having aimed a petulant, but seemingly harmless, kick at Valencia defender Jeison Murillo, prompting referee Felix Brych to brandish the red card. Ronaldo dropped to the floor like the entire tournament was lost but Juve showed more composure, Miralem Pjanic scoring twice from the penalty spot to clinch a comfortable win. Valencia were even awarded a third spot-kick of the match deep into injury-time but Daniel Parejo missed. It remains to be seen how UEFA judge Ronaldo's offence, and dissent, but he is set to miss the next European game at home to Young Boys on October 2. After that comes the more threatening double-header against Manchester United. Valencia's fans celebrated Ronaldo's dismissal at the Estadio Mestalla like a goal had been scored but, in truth, their team missed a golden chance to gain a foothold in Group H. Instead, Ronaldo's absence had little effect. The Italians won and won with ease. ""Come on Cristiano, give us Europe,"" read the headline in Gazzetta dello Sport. ""You could say he's increased the players' desire to prove themselves,"" Massimiliano Allegri said. ""He's raised the bar for everybody."" They proved themselves here. Juventus have claimed seven Serie A titles in a row but the Champions League is the one they want. They last won that in 1996 when Ronaldo was 11 and still playing youth football for Nacional. Allegri is no stranger to this tournament either, with 77 games on the touchline, 77 more than Marcelino, who has given Valencia fans something to cheer again during his 14 months as coach. They lined the streets outside just to witness the buses pull in, booing the visitors and Ronaldo, in particular. They jeered him during the warm-up too. Ronaldo replied by banging a ball into the open net from two yards. After all, Valencia's last game in the Champions League was Gary Neville's first as manager and there have been four more in charge since. Jose Gaya and Parejo were the only players left here from that night but change has not yet bridged the gap with Europe's elite. That much was clear. Ronaldo started brightly, with an ambitious shot from distance, and then had a hand in teeing up two glorious chances, crossing for Federico Bernardeschi to set up Sami Khedira, before misfiring into the path of Mario Mandzukic six yards out. Each fluffed their lines. Valencia had openings too but lacked punch. Michy Batshuayi, on his first start for the club, twisted round Giorgio Chiellini but was denied at the near post. Then the moment the match will be remembered for. Ronaldo let frustration get the better of him and Murillo made the most of it, falling instantly. Brych was convinced. But instead of capitalising, Valencia twice capitulated. First, Parejo missed a high ball and kicked Joao Cancelo before Murillo took a risk by bundling down Leonardo Bonucci. Pjanic stepped up for both spot-kicks and scored both, the first on the stroke of half-time, the next six minutes after. Valencia probed but even when Daniele Rugani collided with Gabriel for a third penalty, Parejo's shot was saved by Wojciech Szczesny. There was never any hint of a comeback."
78,18/09/2018,20:04,"Stopping Ronaldo 'big step' towards victory, says Valencia's Marcelino","Valencia head coach Marcelino says that stopping Cristiano Ronaldo would a ""big step"" towards beating Juventus when his side meet the Serie A giants in Wednesday's Champions League opener.","Ronaldo, who won the competition in four of the last five seasons with Real Madrid, joined Juve for 100 million euros ($117 million) from Real in July. The Portuguese striker has also scored a record 120 Champions League goals, 19 clear of his nearest rival, Lionel Messi. Marcelino insisted that his side are not frightened of Ronaldo, despite knowing his importance to Juventus. ""We have often faced Ronaldo, and often we have faced his presence,"" the 53-year-old said on Tuesday. ""But the word 'fear' is not appropriate, we all have fears in life, but not in our work and in what we want to do. ""We will be vigilant about Ronaldo, try to make sure that he has as little possession as possible and try to limit his impact on the match. If we succeed in that, we'll have taken a big step towards victory."" Valencia are playing in the tournament for the first time since being knocked out in the 2015-16 group stage after finishing fourth in La Liga last season, but captain Dani Parejo isn't worried about going up against the 33-year-old Ronaldo. ""Cristiano is a very important player for them, but let's not focus on his return (to Spain),"" said Parejo. ""We will try to limit their strengths and amplify ours. We know the quality of Cristiano, his way of playing, but for us, it's not important."""
79,13/09/2018,18:52,Russia's Cheryshev cleared of wrongdoing by anti-doping agency,"Spain's anti-doping agency said Thursday it has closed its probe into Valencia's Russian striker Denis Cheryshev, one of the revelations of the 2018 World Cup, after it found no evidence he used a banned substance.","The investigation stemmed from an interview which the player's father, Dmitri Cheryshev, gave to Russian publication Sport Weekend in June 2017 in which he said his son had received growth hormone injections when he played at Spanish side Villarreal. Cheryshev, 27, shared a letter from Spain's anti-doping agency on his official Twitter account which said that ""an investigation was carried out and closed after no signs of irregular conduct were found."" Contacted by AFP, a spokesman for the agency confirmed they sent the letter. Cheryshev, who scored four goals in five World Cup games for Russia as they reached the quarter finals, had denied any wrongdoing. His father said his statements had been twisted by reporters. Without a medical exemption, the use of growth hormones is considered doping and is punishable with a ban of up to four years. Cheryshev joined Valencia in August on a season-long loan from Villarreal."
80,21/08/2018,00:24,Rodrigo strikes as Atletico held by Valencia in La Liga opener,"Atletico Madrid failed to get their La Liga title bid off to a winning start, as Rodrigo earned Valencia a 1-1 draw at the Mestalla Stadium on Monday.","Angel Correa gave Diego Simeone's visitors a 26th-minute lead, but Rodrigo struck in the second half for the home team and last season's runners-up Atletico failed to find a winner. There are high hopes at the Wanda Metropolitano that Atletico can muster a serious title challenge, after keeping their key players in the close season and claiming an impressive extra-time win over city rivals Real Madrid in the UEFA Super Cup last week. But they were given a tough test to start the campaign at a strong Valencia outfit who will be playing in the Champions League this season for the first time since 2015 after finishing fourth. ""It's a shame because we wanted to bring the win home and we didn't manage it,"" the 23-year-old Correa, who also scored in Atletico's opening league game 12 months ago against Girona, told BeIN Sports Spain. ""The effort we put in for the Super Cup isn't an excuse for us, we know how to repeat that kind of effort. There is a long way to go before talking about it (the title), we must continue to work."" Simeone gave a La Liga debut to Thomas Lemar, who joined from Monaco for 72 million euros ($84 million) in July, but the French World Cup winner struggled to make an impression and was hauled off in the 63rd minute. Atletico moved ahead midway through the first period with a wonderfully-crafted goal. Antoine Griezmann showed great skill to cut inside and slip a defence-splitting reverse pass to Correa, which Argentinian winger collected in his stride before firing low past home goalkeeper Neto. Saul Niguez wasted an excellent chance to make it two shortly after half-time when he shot wide, and in the 56th minute when Rodrigo lashed home right-footed after controlling Daniel Wass's looping header on his chest. The 27-year-old scored 19 goals for Valencia last season to earn a Spain call-up for the World Cup and his club will need him to continue that form after sending Italian striker Simone Zaza on loan to Torino. Valencia had opportunities to snatch all three points, but the closest they came to a second goal was when former Arsenal centre-back Gabriel's header hit the post with 23 minutes remaining. ""We proved that we're at a very high level against a great opponent and even if there is still some way to go, that's what we'll need this season,"" said Rodrigo. Later on Monday, Iker Muniain scored in the third minute of injury time to give Athletic Bilbao a 2-1 win over Leganes at the San Mames, after Jonathan Silva had equalised for the visitors following Peru Nolaskoain's 27th-minute opener. Reigning champions Barcelona got their title defence off to a strong start with a 3-0 win over Alaves on Saturday, before Gareth Bale scored as Champions League holders Real Madrid beat Getafe 2-0 on Sunday."

Cheryshev moved to Spain as a child and came up through the Real Madrid academy before joining Villarreal on a five-year deal in 2016 after a series of loan spells. He will again link up with Valencia coach Marcelino, after playing under him at Villarreal in 2014-15. Cheryshev provides another attacking option to a club that has brought in Michy Batshuayi, who is on loan from Chelsea, and former Atletico Madrid striker Kevin Gameiro in the close season."

Valencia's place in the top four was guaranteed even before kick-off after Real Betis had earlier lost to Athletic Bilbao. Villarreal's victory means they will be guaranteed to finish in La Liga's top seven if Getafe, in eighth, fail to beat Las Palmas on Sunday. This season, the team that finishes seventh in the table will also qualify for the Europa League, as well as fifth and sixth, after Barcelona won the Copa del Rey. Valencia had the better of the chances in the first half but Santi Mina missed a one-on-one with Sergio Asenjo and they were made to pay the price. Trigueros swung in a cross from the left and Gaspar rose highest at the front post, flicking the ball with his head into the far corner. Villarreal could still finish fifth after Athletic Bilbao beat Betis thanks to two goals in the final 15 minutes from Iker Muniain and Aritz Aduriz. Celta Vigo's chances of playing European football next seasona are all-but over after they were held to a 1-1 draw by already-relegated Deportivo La Coruna. Girona's hopes were also diminished by a 4-1 defeat at home to Eibar."
85,14/04/2018,18:26,Barca set new La Liga record after 39 games unbeaten,Barcelona set a new La Liga record by extending their unbeaten run to 39 games with a 2-1 victory over Valencia on Saturday.,"Luis Suarez and Samuel Umtiti were both on target as Barca passed the 38 matches Real Sociedad managed without defeat between 1979 and 1980. Dani Parejo gave Valencia brief hope with an 87th-minute penalty. The win at the Camp Nou, which was more comfortable than the scoreline suggested, also eases fears that Tuesday's Champions League collapse against Roma could affect Barcelona's march to the league title. Ernesto Valverde's side are now 14 points clear at the top of the table, before second-placed Atletico Madrid play their game in hand against Levante on Sunday. Valencia stay third, one point ahead of Real Madrid, who are also in action on Sunday, away to Malaga. There is no doubt Barca's shock defeat in Italy still lingers, and may still, even if the Catalans secure the first part of an expected domestic double by winning the Copa del Rey next weekend. But it should take little away from their faultless form in the league, which means the last time they tasted defeat outside a cup competition was against Malaga just over 12 months ago. This was already a club record run, now eight games better than the 31 unbeaten Pep Guardiola's brilliant team strung together in the season of 2010-11. It would now seem only the home Clasico against Real Madrid on May 6, and perhaps an awkward trip to Celta Vigo on Tuesday, stand in the way of Barcelona finishing the league campaign as invincibles. Despite their exertions in Rome, Valverde resisted the temptation to rest key players, with Philippe Coutinho and Paulinho coming in for Ivan Rakitic and Nelson Semedo. Barca showed few signs of lost confidence early on and after 15 minutes they took the lead, Coutinho drifting in from the right and, after spotting Suarez's angled run, poking a superb pass in behind. Suarez took the finish first time and swept the ball inside the near post. Valencia, however, found a foothold and arguably were the better side by the end of the half. Pique, already booked, endured a difficult 45 minutes and as he and Marc-Andre ter Stegen dallied at the back and the latter's skewed pass fell to Carlos Soler. Soler played in Rodrigo Moreno but Ter Stegen made up for his mistake by pushing the shot onto the bar. Barcelona started the second half like they began the first though and five minutes after the restart, they doubled their advantage. Umtiti beat Gabriel Paulista to Coutinho's corner and while his header was parried by Neto, Valencia's goalkeeper could only push it in off the post. Valencia's belief was dwindling and two acrobatic volleys, from Lionel Messi and then Andres Iniesta, almost added a spectacular third, as the first flew just over and the second was parried by Neto. There was time for a tense finish after substitute Ousmane Dembele brought down Jose Gaya in the area and Parejo's feeble penalty squirmed under the body of Ter Stegen. But Barca's morale-boosting win was never really in doubt."
86,17/03/2018,23:06,"Rodrigo, Zaza send Valencia third in Spain",Rodrigo and Simone Zaza scored for Valencia in a 3-1 win over Alaves on Saturday that lifted them above defending champions Real Madrid and into third place in La Liga.,"Italy international Zaza teed up Rodrigo to open the scoring on 19 minutes at Mestalla as the latter found the net for the fourth time in three games. Zaza doubled the advantage just past the half hour when he bundled in a cross for his 12th goal of the season, but Ruben Sobrino cut the deficit for Alaves early in the second half. An own goal from centre-back Victor Laguardia on 54 minutes sealed a sixth league win in seven for Marcelino's Valencia, who climbed two points above Real ahead of their home game against Girona on Sunday. ""The team played well, an extraordinary first half, then the goal just as the second half began gave us some doubts in defence, but we recovered quickly with the third,"" said Marcelino. Real Betis climbed to within a point of a potential Europa League spot with a 3-0 home win over Espanyol, while Getafe are one point further back after coming from behind to claim a 2-1 victory at Real Sociedad. Deportivo La Coruna and Las Palmas remain mired in deep trouble in the relegation zone following a 1-1 draw. Former Barcelona starlet Alen Halilovic fired Las Palmas ahead after just three minutes in northwest Spain, but hosts Deportivo levelled through Raul Albentosa. The result favoured neither side with Deportivo's winless run stretching to 14 matches and leaving them seven points from safety, while Las Palmas are six points adrift of 17th-placed Levante. Leaders Barcelona host Athletic Bilbao on Sunday as second-placed Atletico Madrid, who are eight points behind, travel to Villarreal. Sevilla, fresh off their shock elimination of Manchester United in the Champions League last 16, return to domestic duty away to Leganes."

They remain second, seven points behind unbeaten league leaders Barcelona, who won 2-0 at Eibar on Saturday ahead of their Champions League last 16, first leg away to Chelsea. Former Chelsea striker Costa returned for Atletico at the Wanda Metropolitano after injury prevented him from taking part in their 4-1 Europa League win over FC Copenhagen in Denmark on Thursday. Atletico created little in the first half to get the crowd of just over 60,000 out of their seats. However, they livened up after the restart, and in particular after Gameiro was sent on for Koke just before the hour mark. It was Atletico's French connection that led to the opening goal midway through the second half, with Antoine Griezmann setting up Gameiro, who took a touch before firing low past Kepa Arrizabalaga and into the far corner for his fifth league goal of the season. Gameiro then turned provider with a fine through ball for Costa, who fired home to secure the points with 10 minutes remaining, the goal his second in La Liga since returning to Spain. ""We are not stopping, we are playing well at the moment, and we are enjoying ourselves,"" said Gameiro when asked about his team's pursuit of Barcelona at the top of the table. Atletico, who have conceded a paltry nine goals in 24 La Liga games this season, will hope to stay within striking distance of Barcelona before going to the Camp Nou in a fortnight. Simeone's side are also nine points clear of third-placed Valencia, who came from behind to win 2-1 at bottom club Malaga on Saturday. Real Madrid, in fourth, are at Betis on Sunday evening.

They did not say how long he would be absent. Godin was cleaned out by Neto as the two went up for a high ball following an Antoine Griezmann free-kick. He was taken off bleeding heavily after the incident, which happened early in the second half. Angel Correa scored the goal for Atletico, who are second in La Liga, nine points behind leaders Barcelona."

Orellana joined Valencia at the end of the January transfer window earlier this year from Celta Vigo after a falling out with then coach Eduardo Berizzo. However, he made just 17 appearances for Los Che and hasn't played a single minute since Marcelino Garcia Toral took charge this season. Orellana will have to wait until the new year to make his Eibar debut once the transfer window reopens in January. Eibar look well set to retain their top-flight status for a fifth straight season as three consecutive wins have taken them up to 13th, seven points clear of the drop zone."

Here, AFP Sport looks at five things to look out for in La Liga this weekend. Gareth Bale's emergence off the bench to save a faltering young Real side from embarrassment against third-tier Fuenlabrada in the Copa del Rey earned the Welshman rave reviews in the Spanish press on Wednesday. Marca declared Bale had been handed a ""fresh start"" after a year dogged by a series of injuries. Yet, he could be absent again at San Mames due to a niggling calf problem having missed training for the past two days. Unlike Bale, Keylor Navas didn't help Madrid on his return to action after six weeks out by turning Fuenlabrada's opener into his own net in midweek. Kiko Casilla was also at fault for Malaga's second goal at the Bernabeu last weekend, intensifying Real's search for a new goalkeeper. According to reports, the new man will be Athletic's Kepa Arrizabalaga, who has been one of few shining lights in a hugely disappointing season for Bilbao. Arrizabalaga didn't feature as the Basques did suffer Cup humiliation at the hands of tiny islanders Formentera on Wednesday, edging coach Jose Angel Ziganda closer to the sack. Unzue returns to the Camp Nou hoping to continue Celta's record of beating Barca once in each of the three previous seasons when he was assistant to Luis Enrique. Celta's daring approach against the Catalans in recent years has though had mixed success. Whilst they have twice hit Barca for four at home, in their last two visits to the Catalan capital Celta have been smashed 6-1 and 5-0. Las Palmas are looking for already their third coach of the season after Pako Ayestaran was sacked on Thursday. Ayestaran was only appointed in September when Manuel Marquez resigned. How the Islanders must wish they had held on to the man they will face this weekend back when Quique Setien brings Real Betis to the Canary Islands. Setien not only kept Las Palmas up in the previous two seasons, but did so thanks to some thrilling attacking football. That has continued at Betis, whose 13 La Liga games this season have produced 50 goals. However, contractual differences with the board saw Setien walk out in the summer and left Las Palmas in the lurch. Valencia kept their unlikely title challenge alive by holding Barca at home last weekend. That point came at a cost, thought, as PSG loanee Goncalo Guedes suffered a broken toe that is expected to keep the Portuguese winger out for the rest of the year. Guedes's three goals and five assists have played a huge part in Valencia's revival. However, a kind fixture list during Guedes's absence offers Valencia hope with a visit to Getafe on Sunday followed by Celta, Eibar and Villarreal before the winter break."
91,19/11/2017,18:30,Record-breaking Valencia maintain Barca chase,Valencia maintained their pursuit of Barcelona to remain four points off the La Liga leaders thanks to second-half goals from Geoffrey Kondogbia and Santi Mina to beat a luckless Espanyol 2-0 on Sunday.,"A club record eighth straight La Liga win for Valencia moves Marcelino Garcia Toral's men six points clear of Real Madrid in third and sets up a mouthwatering top of the table showdown at home to Barcelona next Sunday. ""We want to beat Barcelona to be as high in the table as we can, but we still can't talk about being candidates to win the title yet,"" insisted Valencia assistant coach Ruben Uria, who faced the media after Marcelino was sent to the stands in the second half. However, the visitors had fortune on their side as Espanyol dominated for large spells and hit the woodwork twice. ""In the first half they got the better of us, but the team knew how to resist, stay compact, suffer and compete,"" Mina told BeIN Sports Spain. ""The big teams also win like this. The important thing was to win."" Marcelino surprisingly left top scorer Simone Zaza and on-loan Paris Saint-Germain forward Goncalo Guedes on the bench and that decision nearly backfired as Valencia struggled to gain a foothold in the first hour. Gerard Moreno and Sergi Darder both struck the post for the hosts in a six-minute spell just before half-time. Valencia's goalkeeper Neto also had to show smart reactions to deny Sergio Garcia and Moreno once more as Espanyol looked the more likely side to make the breakthrough. The pressure Valencia were under was seen on the sidelines as Marcelino was sent to the stands for his protests towards the officials and is now likely to be banned from the touchline against Barca. However, a moment of magic from Kondogbia swung the game Valencia's way 23 minutes from time as he curled home a wonderful strike from 25 yards. And Mina pounced on Victor Sanchez's short back-pass to calmly side-foot past Pau Lopez on the volley to secure all three points. At the other end of the table, Malaga came from behind to edge a five-goal thriller against Deportivo la Coruna 3-2 to move off the bottom of the table. Borja Baston's first goal for the club six minutes from time saw Malaga leapfrog Las Palmas and Alaves to close within a point of safety."
92,04/11/2017,15:03,Free-scoring Valencia put pressure on Barca,Valencia swept aside Leganes 3-0 on Saturday to continue their stunning form with an eighth straight win to close to within a point of La Liga leaders Barcelona.,"Marcelino Garcia Toral's side also moved ahead of Barca as the league's top scorers with 30 goals in their first 11 games as Dani Parejo, Rodrigo and Santi Mina found the net. Barca can reopen a four-point gap at the top of the table when they host Sevilla later on Saturday (1945 GMT) at the Camp Nou. Parejo has been one of many players rejuvenated by Marcelino's arrival at Mestalla after two seasons in the doldrums for Valencia. The captain's clever free-kick that skidded underneath the Leganes wall got Valencia off to a perfect start on 14 minutes. Leganes had only conceded five goals in their 10 previous La Liga games to climb into seventh. However, the Madrid side's lack of cutting edge up front was exposed as they went on to enjoy the better of the first-half but failed to take their chances as Claudio Beauvue blazed over and Javier Eraso fired too close to Neto in the Valencia goal. On loan Paris Saint-Germain winger Goncalo Guedes has been Valencia's star performer in recent weeks and the Portuguese was inches away from his fourth goal of the season when he struck the post early in the second period. The hosts had to wait until 19 minutes from time to seal the points with a blistering counter-attack that ended with Spanish international Rodrigo heading home Manchester United loanee Andreas Pereira's cross. And the team-spirit in this Valencia side was demonstrated when habitual penalty taker Parejo let Mina take responsibility from the spot eight minutes from time to round off the scoring."
93,08/09/2017,02:00,"Dembele debuts, Atletico face resurgent Valencia",The most expensive player in Barcelona's history will take to the field for the first time on Saturday as Ousmane Dembele debuts in a Catalan derby against Espanyol.,"Atletico Madrid travel to a revitalised Valencia in the headline clash of the weekend, whilst there is an early start for champions Real Madrid. Here, AFP Sports looks at five things to watch from the La Liga weekend. The arrival of the 105-million-euro ($125 million) Frenchman is a much-needed tonic for Barca in the midst of continuing institutional chaos with ongoing public clashes between the board and leading players. President Josep Maria Bartomeu claimed new contracts for Lionel Messi and Andres Iniesta, whose deals expire next summer, were a matter of time on Tuesday only for Iniesta to flatly deny that claim a day later. On the field Barca need to ensure they don't suffer their habitual hangover from international breaks known locally as the ""FIFA virus"". This time last year Barca suffered a shock 2-1 home defeat to Alaves as Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez started on the bench following their international commitments. With Messi and Suarez only arriving back in the Catalan capital on Thursday after two crucial World Cup qualifiers in South America, Espanyol will rarely have a better chance for a first win at the Camp Nou since 2009. It has been a highly promising week for Atletico as inspirational coach Diego Simeone extended his contract till 2020, whilst the pitch was laid among finishing touches to the club's new 68,000 capacity stadium. Since Simeone took charge in 2011, Valencia have had 11 coaches. However, their latest hire in Marcelino finally appears to putting Los Che back on the right track. Valencia took a point from a thrilling 2-2 draw away to Real Madrid before the international break and have since been further boosted by the arrivals of Goncalo Guedes and Andreas Pereira on loan from PSG and Manchester United. Should Atletico emerge unscathed from the Mestalla not having lost ground on Real after three away games to start their season, a serious title challenge is realistic. La Liga president Javier Tebas has continued his war against PSG's free-spending since snatching Neymar away from Barcelona, accusing the Parisians and Manchester City of ""peeing into the pool"" in their disrespect for financial fair play. Tebas' concerns arise from his ambition for La Liga to rival the Premier League's interest around the world and getting television rights deals to match. With that in mind, kick-off times in Spain have become gradually earlier in recent years with an eye on Asian markets. Real's kick-off against Levante at 1300 local time (1100 GMT) on Saturday will go head-to-head with City's blockbuster clash against Liverpool. Overshadowed by the wealth and glamour of Real and Atletico, two of Madrid's more modest sides Leganes and Getafe have fought out their own rivalry in the lower divisions. However, they clash for the first time ever in the top flight on Friday night at Leganes' 11,500 capacity Butarque with the hosts even having the chance to leapfrog Barcelona to the top of the table after two wins from their opening two games. Exactly a year from the day he left, Lucas Perez returned to Deportivo la Coruna from Arsenal on the final day of the transfer window. ""Money doesn't make me happy. I move for emotions, for the feelings that I have,"" said Perez, claiming he had turned down more lucrative offers to force through a return to his native Galicia. Perez scored 17 goals in the 2015/16 season before his move and will need to fire if Depor are to avoid another year of battling relegation, starting with the visit of Real Sociedad on Sunday."

He passed a medical on Tuesday and will be unveiled as Marseille's sixth summer signing on Wednesday. He was not the only player moving from Spain to France on Tuesday as Barcelona loaned young defender Marlon Santos to Nice. Nice confirmed the arrival of the Brazilian, 21, without specifying the length of the loan agreement."
95,28/08/2017,00:11,Real streak halted by Valencia draw,Real Madrid needed a late strike from Marco Asensio to prevent a shock defeat but still saw their relentless winning streak ended by Valencia in a thrilling 2-2 draw at the Santiago Bernabeu on Sunday.,"Asensio had got the hosts off to the perfect start after just 10 minutes, but Carlos Soler rounded off an excellent Valencia team move to level shortly after. Valencia stunned the Bernabeu when Geoffrey Kondogbia, who joined the club this week on a season-long loan from Inter Milan, swept home Rodrigo's cross from the edge of the area. However, like on so many ocassions last season, Madrid had a late reply as Asensio curled home a free-kick seven minutes from time. The Madrid fans had plenty to cheer before kick-off as Real were finally given the chance to lift the Liga trophy they won four months ago. Captain Sergio Ramos and Cristiano Ronaldo joined the parade of the Liga, Spanish Super Cup and UEFA Super Cup trophies but both were suspended for the game, forcing coach Zinedine Zidane into a tactical reshuffle. Casemiro deputised as an auxiliary centre-back, whilst Asensio came into the side in the only change from last weekend's 3-0 win at Deportivo la Coruna. And the Spanish international made an instant impact as he pounced on a slack pass by Kondogbia before slotting into the far corner on his favoured left foot. Valencia have endured two dreadful years, finishing 12th for the past two seasons, but there were encouraging signs of a revival under new coach Marcelino Garcia Toral in their response to going behind. A fine team move cut open the Madrid defence down Valencia's left and Toni Lato's cross was turned in by Soler. Only an excellent save from Valencia goalkeeper Neto kept the scores level at half-time as Madrid broke at frightening pace from a Valencia corner before Karim Benzema's shot was turned behind. Isco and Benzema twice then passsed up huge chances with just Neto to beat as Real ended the half firmly on top. Madrid's pressure continued after the break as Casemiro and Luka Modric saw long-range efforts tipped wide by the impressive Neto. However, Valencia were also posing a threat on the counter-attack as Simone Zaza headed over a golden chance when unmarked 10 yards out before Keylor Navas produced a stunning save from Dani Parejo's free-kick. Valencia thought they had secured their their first win at the Bernabeu since 2008 when Kondogbia swept home Rodrigo's cross from the edge of the area 13 minutes from time. But Asensio rescued Madrid when his free-kick wrong-footed Neto. And they should have snatched all three points when Benzema fired wide from point-blank range. Elswhere on Sunday, there was a trio of 1-0 away wins for Sevilla, Leganes and Athletic Bilbao. Sevilla got their first league victory of the season thanks to Paulo Henrique Ganso as his sensational flicked finish with the outside of his left foot saw off Getafe. Leganes moved up to fourth with a surprise win at Espanyol thanks to Martin Mantovani's solitary goal. And veteran striker Aritz Aduriz edged a Basque derby Athletic's way at Eibar."

As part of the agreement, Valencia right-back Joao Cancelo is expected to go the other way to join the Italian giants on loan for the season. Kondogbia already has La Liga experience after a stellar season in 2012/13 with Sevilla before moving to Monaco. After helping the French side to the Champions League quarter-finals, Kondogbia joined Inter for a reported 40 million euros in 2015. Kondogbia could make his debut when Valencia visit European champions Real Madrid at the Santiago Bernabeu on Sunday. Valencia began their La Liga campaign and new coach Marcelino García Toral's reign in charge with a 1-0 win over Las Palmas on Friday."

Sevilla's best effort saw Stevan Jovetic hit the post early on, but Jorge Sampaoli's men have now won just one of their last eight games in all competitions. A point means Sevilla trail third-placed Atletico Madrid by three points in the battle for automatic Champions League qualification. However, they enjoy a comfortable eight-point lead over fifth-placed Villarreal, who travel to Alaves on Monday.

A disciplinary committee of the Spanish Football Federation fined the home side 1,500 euros ($1,600) and said a repeat could result in a stadium closure. But it also had harsh words for Barcelona, accusing some of their players -- without giving names -- of ""reproachable behaviour"" as they celebrated close to the touchline. However, the Federation stressed that ""nothing, absolutely nothing justifies a violent public reaction"". In response, Barcelona issued a statement calling the criticism of their players ""totally reproachable"".

Will we sign anybody before the end of the transfer window? I am 99 percent confident."" Should both players complete their transfers, Arsenal's spending for the close season will be close to 100 million pounds. They have already signed Swiss international Granit Xhaka from Borussia Moenchengladbach and young pair Rob Holding and Takuma Asano. Wenger has come under pressure from the club's fans to bring in new players, with supporters chanting ""Spend some money!"" during last weekend's 0-0 draw at Leicester City. But Wenger said he would not be influenced by the fans' demands. ""I'm happy when our supporters are happy, but my job is to make the right decisions,"" the Frenchman told reporters at Arsenal's London Colney training centre.

Singapore's Lim is one of a growing number of Asian owners of European clubs including Leicester City's Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha and Tony Xia, who this week agreed to buy Aston Villa. ""It is not easy because there is a cultural difference,"" Chan told reporters in Singapore, during a visit by Valencia players. ""Spanish people are more expressive. But as Singaporeans, we are more reserved, so direct and every thing is short and sweet,"" she said. ""Such culture differences can sometimes cause a little bit of misunderstandings. They may feel that we are being cold."" But Chan believes more Asians and in particular Chinese owners will continue to invest in European football clubs, whose attractions include their TV revenues and huge popularity in the region. ""Now there is a kind of political direction in China about using football. I'm sure there will be more Chinese companies or businessmen looking to buy European clubs,"" she said. Lim has come under fire from Valencia fans for his stewardship of the club, especially his appointment of the untried Neville. The former Manchester United defender and TV pundit won just three of 16 La Liga games before being sacked after four months in charge. ""I think the biggest issue with Gary was because of language barrier,"" said Chan. ""It didn't work (that well) because for the Spanish culture, they also need to feel a lot of -- because they are very expressive -- warmth and sometimes all these can lose out from a translator,"" she added. Clubs in England, Spain and Italy have all lured Asian investors, with Thai tycoon Vichai the biggest success story after Leicester's stunning Premier League title win this year. Barcelona-based Espanyol were taken over in January by with Chinese entertainment company Rastar Group, while Chinese conglomerate Wanda bought a 20 percent stake in 10-time Spanish champions Atletico Madrid last year.

First-half goals from Samuel Garcia and Adrian Lopez - who also struck the stoppage time winner in the 1-0 frist leg success over Liverpool - moved Villarreal six points clear of Athletic Bilbao with two games to play. However, Marcelino's men cannot be overtaken by the Basques due to their superior head-to-head record. Athletic leapfrogged Celta Vigo into fifth as they came from behind to beat the Galicians 2-1 earlier on Sunday. Fabian Orellana opened the scoring for Celta before Aritz Aduriz equalised with his 34th goal of the season from the penalty spot. Gustavo Cabral was then sent-off for kicking Aduriz in the head and Athletic made the man advantage count when Raul Garcia struck the winner 18 minutes from time. At the bottom of the table, Getafe gave their chances of survival a huge boost with a 2-0 win at 10-man Deportivo la Coruna thanks to goals from Pedro Leon and Carlos Vigaray. Getafe are now tied with Sporting Gijon and Rayo Vallecano on 35 points, but remain in the bottom three due to their inferior head-to-head record against Rayo.

109,15/04/2016,02:15,Barcelona seek reaction to alarming slide,Barcelona host Valencia on Sunday desperately in need of a win to arrest a slide of three defeats in four games and prevent losing their grip on the La Liga title race.,"The Catalans still lead Atletico Madrid by three points with six games remaining, but were dumped out of the Champions League by Atletico on Wednesday as their quest to deliver a second consecutive treble was killed off. ""It is clear we are not in our best moment of the season,"" said Barca defender Gerard Pique. ""In the world of football perfect seasons don't exist. ""We need to keep going in the two competitions we have still in play."" Barca in particular need a reaction from their star front three of Lionel Messi, Neymar and Luis Suarez, who have gone off the boil at the business end of the season. Messi hasn't netted for five games, whilst Neymar has also failed to score from open play as Barca have won just once in their last five matches. ""We need to lift ourselves because we still have two very attractive goals to obtain,"" added Barca coach Luis Enrique. However, Barca's only change from the 11 that started at the Calderon in midweek is likely to come in goal where Claudio Bravo will replace Marc-Andre ter Stegen. Valencia can also approach the game in a much more relaxed state after Alvaro Negredo's last minute winner against Sevilla last time out moved them nine points clear of the relegation zone in Pako Ayestaran's first home game in charge since replacing the sacked Gary Neville. The visitors also have revenge in mind having been thrashed 7-0 on their last visit to the Camp Nou during Neville's reign in February. ""Barcelona aren't the same as when we played against them and, with our strengths, we will try to get a good result,"" said defender Jose Luis Gaya. Atletico could even draw level with Barca at the top of the table before kick-off at the Camp Nou as they host relegation threatened Granada at the Vicente Calderon. Diego Simeone's men have the most favourable run-in with four of their remaining six games at home. However, they still need Barca to drop points in at least two games due to their inferior head-to-head record with the Catalans. Fernando Torres will return to the Atletico line-up after being suspended for the Barcelona return leg after scoring in each of his last three appearances. Real Madrid also booked their place in the last four of the Champions League in midweek thanks to Cristiano Ronaldo's hat-trick to overturn a 2-0 first leg deficit against Wolfsburg. And Zinedine Zidane's men can close to within one point of Barcelona when they travel across the Spanish capital to face struggling Getafe. Former Argentine international Juan Eduardo Esnaider will take charge of Getafe for the first time as Fran Escriba was sacked on Tuesday after a 12-game winless run saw Los Azulones drop into the relegation zone. ""The Real Madrid game is fundamental for us. They will arrive here euphoric fancying their chances in La Liga and the Champions League, but I want to take the game to them,"" said Esnaider. At the bottom, Levante realistically have to beat Espanyol on Friday if they are to have any chance of beating the drop.

The poor defending that underminded Neville's reign cost the hosts once more five minutes from time, though, when Sevilla substitute Kevin Gameiro swept home Michael Krohn-Dehli's pass to equalise. However, Negredo pounced on a loose ball inside the area in stoppage time to the relief of 50,000 fans at the Mestalla, to move Valencia up to 13th and nine points clear of the relegation zone with six games remaining. Sevilla are now 12 points adrift of Villarreal in fourth after the Yellow Submarine strengthened their hold on the final Champions League spot with a comfortable 2-0 win over relegation-threatened Getafe. Denis Suarez got Villarreal off to a perfect start with the opener on 15 minutes before the on-form Cedric Bakambu sealed the points with his 20th goal of the season. Earlier, Celta Vigo remained eight points off Villarreal in fifth as Nolito's second-half strike earned a hard-fought 1-0 win at Sporting Gijon. Athletic Bilbao moved three points clear of Sevilla in sixth thanks to Inaki Williams's solitary goal in a 1-0 win over Rayo Vallecano."
111,31/03/2016,16:49,Results not all Neville's fault - Valencia director,Valencia sporting director Jesus Garcia Pitarch has admitted Gary Neville is far from the only figure to blame for the Spanish side's terrible season a day after the English coach was sacked.,"Neville was released of his duties after just three wins in 16 La Liga games during an ill-fated four-month spell in Spain to be replaced by one of his assistants, Pako Ayestaran. ""I want to thank Gary and his coaching team for their dedication and hard work. The results are not just theirs, but belong to many people,"" Pitarch said as Ayestaran was unveiled on Thursday. Neville's close relationship with the club's Singaporean owner Peter Lim, with whom he shares a stake in English non-league club Salford City, was a major factor in landing the former Manchester United captain his first senior managerial role. And Pitarch revealed Ayestaran has travelled to Singapore in the past week to met Lim. ""We had a number of days to analyse the situation we found ourselves in and we wanted to resolve it. ""When we took the decision to replace Gary Neville with Pako we asked for Gary's permission to start the process, which Gary gave us. ""We invited Pako to Singapore and he met with Peter to evaluate the situation, so that Peter could get to know him and Pako could transmit what he could bring to the club."" Valencia sit just six points above the relegation zone and face a difficult run in with trips to Barcelona and Real Madrid to come in the final eight games of the season. Relegation would be a financial nightmare for Lim's Meriton investments group, who have invested over 500 million euros ($566 million) in the club since completing a takeover in 2014. ""I would like to take this opportunity to say to everyone at the club and our fans that we are going through a difficult time,"" added Valencia president Lay Hoon Chan. ""We are not going to take this bad moment lightly. The team has to give the maximum level of commitment along with all those that love Valencia."""
112,31/03/2016,09:01,Neville's Valencia voyage of discovery doomed to fail,Gary Neville's unhappy tenure at Valencia was brought to a sudden halt on Wednesday as the Spanish club announced he had been sacked after just four months in charge.,"Neville's first foray into senior management after limited experience as an assistant to Roy Hodgson with England was a risky one from the day the shock announcement of his appointment was made in early December. On the back of a hugely successful 20-year playing career with Manchester United, Neville had gained widespread praise for his astute analysis as a Sky Sports pundit in his homeland before taking up the challenge offered by Valencia's Singaporean owner, his business partner and friend Peter Lim. The hiring of an untried coach who didn't speak Spanish and the close personal relationship between Lim and Neville raised suspicions straight away in Valencia. ""I would question it as a neutral observer,"" Neville said himself on the day he was presented as the club's new coach. ""I'd be sceptical and I would want to be proved otherwise. Anyone who has any doubts, concerns, reservations, they'll only be removed if we win football matches."" Ultimately, he didn't win enough even to see out his short-term contract until the end of the season. ""I would have liked to have continued the work I started but understand that we are in a results business and in the 28 games (W10, D7, L11) they have not been to my standards or to those which are required by this club,"" Neville said in a statement after his dismissal. Even those statistics are padded by three wins in Cup ties against third-tier Barakaldo and struggling Granada, as well as a 10-0 aggregate rout of Rapid Vienna in the Europa League. Neville won just three of 16 La Liga games in charge to see Los Che tumble from four points off the Champions League places when he arrived, to six points above the relegation zone with a tough final eight games of the season to come. Cup runs briefly prolonged his stay, yet even they ended in major disappointment. The 7-0 thrashing at the hands of Barcelona in the first leg of the Copa del Rey semi-final was described by sporting director Jesus Garcia Pitarch as one of the worst results in the club's history. Elimination from the Europa League at the hands of a fellow La Liga side with far fewer resources in Athletic Bilbao earlier this month closed the door to any salvation for a miserable season at the Mestalla. Neville will be succeeded for the remainder of the season by Pako Ayestaran. The hiring of Rafael Benitez's former assistant to translate Neville's ideas to the squad in February coincided with Valencia's only upturn in form in recent months. ""I'm the head coach of Valencia, I will be the head coach of Valencia for the rest of this season. If I leave, Pako will leave,"" Neville said at the time of suggestions Ayestaran had been hired with eyes to replacing him. Neville's trust in Ayestaran, his old friend Lim and his own ability to turn around a sinking ship in Spain was ultimately misplaced."

With your support it will be easier for me. I want to thank every single fan, club and companion in my last 17 years as a professional footballer,"" Hildebrand wrote on his Facebook page. The ex-Germany shot-stopper is without a club and has decided to hang up his gloves after a move to an MLS club in the United States fell through. Hildebrand set the German league record in nine games, bridging the 2002/03 and 2003/04 seasons. ""This record was part of an outstanding team performance. If anyone manages to beat it, it will be Bayern and Manuel,"" Hildebrand magazine Kicker. Bayern Munich's Manuel Neuer came closest to beating Hildebrand's figure in 2011 when he went 770 minutes unbeaten in the German league. Hildebrand won the last of his seven caps for Germany in 2007 and made 301 appearances in the Bundesliga for VfB Stuttgart, Hoffenheim, Schalke 04 and Eintracht Frankfurt. He also had spells at Valencia and Sporting Lisbon after winning the Bundesliga title with Stuttgart in the 2006/07 season. He last played in Germany's top flight for Frankfurt in December 2014 and has decided to retire after a long recovery period following a hip operation in April 2015. ""I love football, but I am at an age when one is allowed to stop,"" he added. ""Apart from that, my health is important to me and I want to be able to have a bit of a kick around with my son."" Hildebrand has signed up to study for his coaching licence and says he may well work for VfB Stuttgart in the future. ""I am rooted to the club and can well imagine doing something at VfB in the future. I have good contacts,"" he said. For now he is busy with projects in sports business and event management and is a partner in a supermarket chain of vegan food."

""You'll report it as panic, but it is not panic, it is something that's important,"" said Neville. ""I have just spoken to Roy Hodgson and I am going to stay back in Valencia. The players train Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday this week. I feel it's the right thing to do. ""Obviously it's not an ideal situation. I'm the assistant coach for the national team of England, with 60 million people, but I understand the two or three million people in Valencia need my attention this week."" England travel to world champions Germany on Saturday before hosting the Netherlands on March 29 as they step up their preparations for this year's European Championship in France. ""The game is on Saturday, so I will go on Thursday afternoon. I think it's right that I support the players and coaches here for these three days."" Neville has now won just three of 16 league games in charge to leave Valencia six points above the relegation zone in 14th with eight games to go. However, Los Che could yet be dragged into a relegation battle as they are still to face four of the top six in Barcelona, Real Madrid, Villarreal and Sevilla. ""We must focus on the last eight games of the season,"" added Neville. ""From my point of view, the situation is not good and the results not good enough. The fans are rightly frustrated, as am I."""

Despite criticism from the local press in Valencia, Neville has insisted he will meet up with the England squad later this week for friendlies against Germany and the Netherlands in the build-up to Euro 2016. The former Manchester United captain publicly lambasted his players' attitude in losing 1-0 to local rivals Levante last weekend. Valencia responded with one of their best displays of the season to beat Athletic Bilbao 2-1 in the Europa League on Thursday, but still bowed out of the competition on away goals to end any hopes of qualifying for European competition next season."

Daniel Sturridge and Roberto Firmino scored as Jurgen Klopp's side dominated the first European meeting between the two Premier League giants, and Sturridge says Liverpool's mindset won't change despite their healthy advantage. ""We'll approach the second leg exactly the same as we did the first leg. That's the only way we know,"" Sturridge told the Liverpool Echo. ""The Liverpool way is to win games so we will go into the second leg and be positive. ""The confidence is there within the camp and we are just looking forward to every game. We are mentally prepared for every job we have ahead of us."" United face a tough task to turn things around as Liverpool have kept four straight clean sheets in Europe and are unbeaten in nine games in this season's competition. However, Juan Mata insists there is still hope for United as they bid to keep alive their quest to become just the fifth club to land all three major European trophies. ""We need to have a good start on Thursday, with intensity. It's like a final for us. We need a comeback and I'm sure that the atmosphere in Old Trafford will take us closer to that goal. I'm sure it's possible,"" said the Spaniard, who missed Sunday's 1-1 draw against West Ham in the FA Cup through suspension. Borussia Dortmund will seek to protect a 3-0 lead as they head to Tottenham Hotspur on the back of their biggest win against an English side. Spurs paid the price for resting Harry Kane and leaving Mousa Dembele and Erik Lamela on the bench as they were outclassed by Thomas Tuchel's German title challengers. However, Mauricio Pochettino's men are undefeated in nine European home games, winning their last two at White Hart Lane by three-goal margins, although the Bundesliga giants represent a step up in class from previous opponents. Gary Neville's Valencia must overcome a 1-0 deficit at home to fellow Spanish outfit Athletic Bilbao. The former Manchester United and England defender was furious after his side crashed to a 1-0 defeat against local rivals and La Liga's bottom side Levante over the weekend. ""We have to pick ourselves up immediately. Our attitude has to change, simple as that. We're not playing like that on Thursday night,"" Neville told reporters. ""The very least you will get on Thursday will be a Valencia team running around like crazy and fighting for every single ball."" Holders Sevilla return to Spain following a goalless draw against Swiss champions Basel, whose St-Jakob Park will stage this year's final, as they continue their quest for a fifth title in the past decade. Villarreal go to Bayer Leverkusen with a 2-0 advantage from the first leg, while 2009 champions Shakhtar Donetsk head to Anderlecht following a 3-1 victory in Ukraine. Fenerbahce take a narrow 1-0 lead to Portuguese side Braga, while Lazio, who were charged by UEFA for racist chanting after last week's 1-1 draw in the Czech Republic, return home for their second leg against Sparta Prague."

Neville has now won just three of 15 La Liga games in charge with Valencia rooted in mid-table mediocrity in 12th, just eight points above the relegation zone. Former Manchester United striker Giuseppe Rossi's solitary goal revitalised Levante's chances of beating relegation as they moved to within three points of safety despite remaining bottom of the table. ""I take responsibility for the defeat, but that was an indefensible performance, unacceptable and not good enough,"" said Neville. ""I apologise to the fans of Valencia because the very basic premise of a football match is that you run, fight and tackle as hard as the opposition."" Valencia's season now hinges upon overturning a 1-0 first-leg deficit at home to Athletic Bilbao in the Europa League on Thursday. Rossi hit the post, whilst Diego Alves made fine saves from Deyverson and Zouhair Feddal as Levante dominated the first-half. The second-half was shorter on goalmouth action, but despite Neville's pre-match warning that they had to improve, Valencia were made to pay once more for poor defending at set-pieces as Rossi swivelled to volley a long-throw into the far corner 25 minutes from time. Neville also insisted before the game that he will fulfil his duties as an England coach during a 10-day international break later this month. That decision is likely to come under further scrutiny in the coming week with his future at the Mestalla far from secure. At the other end of the table, Sevilla moved to within five points of Villarreal in fourth as they came from behind to register a 16th straight win at home. Vicente Iborra finished off a brilliant counter-attack to give Seville the lead. However, Cedric Bakambu continued his fine form with a double to give Villarreal a 2-1 half-time lead. Victor Ruiz's own goal restored parity for the hosts before Yehven Konoplyanka's stunning long-range strike regained the lead. Sevilla had to see out the final 10 minutes with 10 men as Ever Banega was shown a second yellow card.

Victory revitalises Levante's chances of beating relegation as they remain bottom of the table but move to within three points of safety. Valencia's season now hinges upon overturning a 1-0 first-leg deficit at home to Athletic Bilbao in the Europa League on Thursday. Despite making five changes from the side that lost in the Basque country in awful weather conditions in midweek, Valencia looked weary from their European exploits as Levante should have had just their sixth win of the season sewn up before half-time. Rossi hit the post, whilst Diego Alves made fine saves from Deyverson and Zouhair Feddal. Sofiane Feghouli also had the visitors' two best chances before half-time, but was firstly denied by Diego Marino and then curled wide.

Valencia set the record for an aggregate win in the Europa League with a 10-0 thrashing of Rapid Vienna on Thursday, whilst victories over Espanyol and Granada had allayed any fears of a relegation battle. However, they have been drawn against Athletic in the last 16 of the Europa League and they will face a much tougher test to make it into the quarter-finals against a side who moved up to seventh in La Liga with three goals in seven second-half minutes at Mestalla. Sabin Merino was the Basques' hero as they saw off Marseille in midweek and he continued his goal-scoring form with a bullet header from Mikel San Jose's cross. Iker Muniain then doubled the visitors' lead from Mikel Rico's pass to register his first goal in 18 months. And Aritz Aduriz compounded a miserable afternoon for Neville by rising highest to head home Benat Extebarria's corner for his 27th goal of the season. Villarreal also ousted Napoli in Europa League action on Thursday, but showed no ill effects as goals from Leo Baptistao and Samu Castillejo put them 2-0 up inside half an hour against Levante. Adrian Lopez added a third with his first goal for the club just after the break. And Levante's miserable day was completed when captain David Navarro was sent off for a second bookable offence, meaning he will miss the visit of Real Madrid on Wednesday. A fourth defeat in five games leaves Levante still four points off safety in 19th. At the very least, Villarreal now look assured of a return to the Champions League next season after opening up an 11-point lead on fifth-placed Sevilla.

""It is a game we need to win,"" Ronaldo told Madrid's website. ""It is an important game at home, in front of our fans and against a very strong team that defends well. ""We know that (winning) La Liga will be difficult, but we need to fight until the end. Football is box full of surprises and anything can happen."" Real are expected to once again be without Gareth Bale as the calf injury that was initially expected to keep the Welsh star out for three weeks in mid-January drags on. Karim Benzema is likely to return having missed the 1-1 draw at Malaga last weekend, whilst James Rodriguez could start after being left on the bench by Zinedine Zidane at La Rosaleda. Zidane's record at the Bernabeu since taking over has been impeccable with four wins and 20 goals from four games. However, Atletico's rock-solid defence will pose a much more difficult obstacle to break down. Simeone's men recorded their 24th clean sheet in 38 games this season in a 0-0 draw at PSV Eindhoven in the Champions League in midweek. However, goals at the other end of the field has been the major problem for Atletico with just one in their last three games. ""The goal will come. We need to keep going and, if we have to be patient, I'll be the first to wait,"" said Simeone. Stefan Savic misses out through injury, so Jose Maria Gimenez will come into the Atletico defence. Meanwhile, Fernando Torres is likely to earn a recall to the starting line-up unless Yannick Carrasco recovers in time from an ankle ligament injury. Barca can maintain their stranglehold on the title race when Sevilla visit the Camp Nou on Sunday. The Andalusians' charge for a top-four finish has been maintained by their brilliant home form as they still haven't won away in the league all season. That run seems highly unlikely to chance as Barca seek to extend a 33-game unbeaten run in all competitions. However, the last time the European champions tasted defeat it was to Sevilla in October. ""Stats are there to be broken,"" said Barca's top scorer Luis Suarez. ""We are dedicated to playing well and getting good results."" With three La Liga games to come in seven days, Barca boss Luis Enrique is likely to rotate with the likes of Arda Turan and Sergi Roberto in line to start. Similarly with Sevilla aiming to catch Villarreal, who they trail by eight points, in fourth, coach Unai Emery may prioritise more winnable clashes with Eibar and Getafe in the next week. However, Villarreal are strong favourites to stretch their commanding lead over the Europa League holders to 11 points when they host Levante on Sunday. Gary Neville's upturn in fortunes as Valencia boss continued with a 4-0 win over Rapid Vienna on Thursday to seal a remarkable 10-0 aggregate win and a fourth consecutive victory in all competitions.

Neville has failed to win in nine La Liga games since taking charge in December, form that has seen his Valencia side plummet from five points off the top four to just four points above the relegation zone. Only an estimated 10,000 fans turned up to see Valencia's fate sealed in the second leg of the Copa del Rey semi-finals on Wednesday with a 1-1 draw against a much-changed Barcelona coming after they were thrashed 7-0 in the first leg a week before. ""I am aware of the right of the fans not to come and to say and do what they want,"" said Neville. ""I think the stadium on Saturday will be full and an electric atmosphere. We and the team need the fans more than ever on Saturday."" Neville's friendship with Valencia's Singaporean owner Peter Lim played a big part in him taking his first managerial role at the Mestalla, and has helped the England coach remain in the job despite widespread criticism in the Spanish media and by some sections of the club's support. However, another defeat against an Espanyol side who have also not won in nine games and lost 5-0 at home to Real Sociedad on Monday is expected to see Neville's time in Spain come to an abrupt conclusion. Espanyol coach Constantin Galca's job is also on the line just two months after taking charge with the club's new Chinese owners -- who have targeted Champions League football within three years -- not expected to show patience with the Romanian. ""They are only three points above us and if we win we put them in trouble as well,"" said Espanyol midfielder Victor Sanchez. ""Hopefully we don't start like the other day and make the game as long as possible for them. There are no more excuses and we need to produce this week."" At the other end of the table, Zinedine Zidane faces his toughest test since becoming Real Madrid coach as Athletic Bilbao visit the Santiago Bernabeu on Saturday. Real's title hopes hang by a thread as they are four points adrift of leaders Barcelona, who also have a game in hand. Zidane will also get his first taste of Champions League action as a coach later in the week as Madrid travel to Roma, but Cristiano Ronaldo insists they are not ready to give up on the league to focus on Europe yet. ""The players are going to give everything on the field to try and win the title and the Champions League,"" he told the club's website. Madrid have injury worries as their only specialised left-back Marcelo is sidelined by a dislocated shoulder, whilst Gareth Bale remains out with a calf injury. Athletic also have key players missing as Inaki Williams and Mikel San Jose are both suspended. Barcelona look to continue a club record 29 games unbeaten when they host Celta Vigo on Sunday. Coach Luis Enrique left all 11 that are expected to start out of his squad for the formality of the second leg against Valencia in midweek. Lionel Messi is fit after having treatment on a kidney stone problem earlier in the week, whilst La Liga's top goalscorer Luis Suarez and Neymar also return. Atletico Madrid remain Barca's closest challengers, three points adrift of the European champions having also played a game more. Diego Simeone can welcome back three quarters of his defence in Filipe Luis, Diego Godin and Juanfran from suspension as Atletico have the opportunity to move level at the top for a couple of hours at least when they make the short trip across the capital to face Getafe on Sunday.

I have to work out how we can get in a positive frame of mind on Sunday."" Neville insisted he wouldn't quit in the face of persistent questioning in midweek, however the club's sporting director Jesus Garcia Pitarch refused to give his backing to the former Manchester United captain. Madrid sports daily AS reported on Thursday that Valencia had already sounded out former coach Rafael Benitez - who won two La Liga titles in three years at the Mestalla between 2001 and 2004 - as Neville's replacement for next season. Valencia's overall winless streak of 11 league games has left them just five points above the relegation zone. However, luckily for Neville's men, Betis are also mired in crisis, three points adrift of Valencia and also without a win in nine games. At the top of the table, Barcelona, Atletico Madrid and Real Madrid are heavy favourites to pick up wins in the title race. Barca's 2-1 win over Atletico last weekend opened up a three-point lead at the top with Real a point further adrift. Barca also have a game in both clubs from the capital. The 7-0 rout of Valencia in midweek also took the European champions to within a game of matching a club record 28-game unbeaten run set by Pep Guardiola's Barca in 2010/11 ahead of their trip to bottom side Levante. ""After the run and number of games we have had until now, we have to congratulate them to be able to see that fluidity and confidence,"" said Barca boss Luis Enrique. ""We have unique players, that is evident and we still have many things to achieve."" Enrique is likely to recall Javier Mascherano and Dani Alves after they were rested in midweek, whilst the deadly trio of Lionel Messi, Luis Suarez and Neymar will continue up front. Atletico have a defensive crisis as they host free-scoring Eibar to the Vicente Calderon. Filipe Luis, Diego Godin and Juanfran are all suspended, whilst Stefan Savic is struggling with a thigh strain. Atletico are also a striker down having sold Jackson Martinez to Chinese side Guangzhou Evergrande for 42 million euros on Wednesday, but Luciano Vietto is expected to return to accompany Antoine Griezmann in attack. Eibar's biggest threat won't be unknown to Diego Simeone's men as Borja Baston is on loan from Atletico, but is free to face his parent club and is the top scoring Spaniard in La Liga with 15 goals this season. Real Madrid look to continue their positive start to life under Zinedine Zidane when they travel to Granada on Sunday. Zidane may be able to recall Gareth Bale after three weeks out with a calf injury. Madrid have scored 16 goals in winning their three home games with ease since Zidane took charge, but slipped up in their only other away trip so far with a 1-1 draw at Betis two weeks ago.

It could have been even worse for Valencia as Neymar hit the post from the penalty spot after Shkodran Mustafi was sent-off for bringing down Messi inside the area. However, Messi and Suarez both added two more after the break to make next week's second-leg at the Mestalla a formality. The Cup had been Neville's one refuge during a winless run of eight league games since taking charge in December, but Valencia were blown away by a Barca side back to their best and on the verge of a fifth final in six seasons. Neymar had made headlines earlier in the week as he was quizzed by a judge in Spain's top court over the murky transfer deal which brought him to Barca in 2013 amidst corruption and fraud allegations. However, he showed his performances continue to be unaffected by off-field problems as he drove at the Valencia defence before playing in Suarez to fire across Australian international Matt Ryan into the far corner. Aleix Vidal then cut-back Sergio Busquets's ball over the top of the Valencia defence for Suarez to slam home his 33rd goal of the season five minutes later. Messi was left with the simple task of slotting in his first of the evening from close range after great work by Andres Iniesta and Suarez just before the half-hour mark. Valencia were happy to get to the break just three down as Messi then hit the bar from Suarez's brilliant low cross before the Argentine was clipped by Mustafi as he bore down on goal. Neymar was over-confident with his one-step run-up, though, as his penalty came back off the post. Gerard Pique, Busquets and Messi all fired just off target as Barca continued to run riot after the break. However, the biggest cheer of the night from the home fans was reserved for on-loan Real Madrid winger Denis Cheryshev's introduction as a substitute on his Valencia debut. Cheryshev's inclusion when he should have been suspended saw Madrid thrown out of the competition in December. Messi latched onto Suarez's lovely backheel to make it 4-0 and then completed his hat-trick with a fierce effort that Ryan was disappointed to see slip through his grasp. Suarez rounded off the scoring as he powered home a header from Adriano's cross and fired in a low shot at the near post two minutes from time."

A first defeat at home in La Liga since November 2014, 1-0 against Sporting Gijon on Sunday, stretched Neville's winless streak in La Liga to eight games and left Valencia just five points above the relegation zone. Neville's men face the most daunting task possible if they are to reach the final for the first time since 2008 against a Barca side that hasn't lost in 26 matches in all competitions. However, Neville insists he is embracing the challenge of returning to the scene of one of his greatest triumphs where as a player he won the Champions League with Manchester United back in 1999. ""I can't wait for Wednesday night, and I think the players will be the same. These are the moments you live for as a coach and a player,"" he said. One of Neville's boldest moves has been to name top scorer Paco Alcacer captain in place of Dani Parejo and he is hopeful the Spanish international will be fit to feature after two weeks out with an ankle injury. ""By Tuesday we'll have a full complement of players, Paco is looking good and is back running again."" The visitors could also hand debuts to Denis Cheryshev and Guilherme Siqueira after they sealed loan deals from Real Madrid and Atletico Madrid respectively until the end of the season.

However, he is free to feature at the Camp Nou. ""Barcelona are a great opponent, but Valencia also can also do some damage,"" said the Russian international. Barcelona boss Luis Enrique has a fully-fit squad to choose from and is likely to rotate after his side showed growing signs of fatigue from their demanding January schedule in edging past nine-man Atletico Madrid 2-1 on Saturday. ""It suits us to have four days rest before hosting Valencia,"" said defender Javier Mascherano. ""We have managed to keep winning and we're in an ideal situation, but in any moment it can slip away so we have to keep going.""

Celta caused the shock of the quarter-finals by knocking out Atletico Madrid and will be boosted by the return of Spanish international Nolito. The former Barcelona forward played since December due to a hamstring injury and was strongly linked with a return to Barca, but the move was scuppered by the tight financial restrictions on Barca to comply with financial fair play. ""We always knew Nolito's intention was to stay here,"" said Celta captain Hugo Mallo. ""We are waiting for him with open arms because he is a player that can decide games."""

Cheryshev made just six appearances for Real this season since returning from a successful loan spell at Villarreal last season. However, his most telling contribution saw Madrid thrown out of the Copa del Rey for fielding Cheryshev against Cadiz when he was suspended due to an accumulation of yellow cards from his time at Villarreal. ""He is a kid that works very hard, but he needs time and I wish him the best,"" Real Madrid coach Zinedine Zidane said on Sunday. Cheryshev is the second addition to Neville's squad is as many days as full-back Guilherme Siqueira has also joined on loan until the end of the season from Atletico Madrid. Valencia haven't won in La Liga since early November, including in eight games since Neville took charge, to fall to within five points of the relegation zone. However, they have reached the Copa del Rey semi-finals where they face holders Barcelona in the first-leg on Wednesday. And despite Madrid's elimination from the Cup, Cheryshev will be free to play as his suspension is deemed to have been served. ""It is true that the team is going through a difficult time, but with hard work everything is possible,"" added Cheryshev. ""Barcelona are a great opponent, but Valencia also can also do some damage."""

Real Madrid's expulsion from the competition for fielding an ineligible player against Cadiz could open the door for a winner outside Spanish football's dominant top three of Real, Barcelona and Atletico Madrid for the first time since 2010. And Neville has targeted winning one of the Cup or the Europa League as one of his prime targets in his short stint at Valencia between now and the end of the season. ""Valencia have to win trophies,"" he told the club's website. ""The players have to experience the medal round their neck to give them confidence and belief."" Holders Barcelona have already assured their place in the last 16 with a 6-1 thrashing of Villanovense. And, aside from Madrid's monumental error in fielding Russian international Denis Cheryshev when he was suspended due to an accumulation of yellow cards last season, there was little drama in the fourth round first legs as almost all of La Liga's big guns look on course to progress. Atletico moved joint top of La Liga with an eighth consecutive victory in all competitions against Athletic Bilbao at the weekend and should make it nine when Reus visit the Vicente Calderon. Diego Simeone's men hold a 2-1 advantage from the first leg despite naming a much changed side and a number of fringe players will get another chance to impress on Thursday. Villarreal are one of the few top sides with work to do as they seek to overturn a 3-2 first leg deficit when they host second division Huesca fresh from beating Real Madrid. La Liga strugglers Granada and Malaga trail Leganes and Mirandes 2-1 respectively. And despite their great start to the league season, Eibar have an even more difficult task as they trail Ponferradina 3-0. Meanwhile, last season's beaten finalists Athletic Bilbao, Sevilla, Celta Vigo and Deportivo la Coruna are all well set to progress as they hold comfortable leads against lower league opposition with the home leg to come."
130,10/12/2015,01:50,Neville seeks fresh Valencia after poor start,Valencia boss Gary Neville believes his side suffered from their exertions in holding Barcelona at the weekend as they crashed out of the Champions League with a 2-0 home defeat to Lyon on Wednesday.,"The Spanish side needed to win and hope Gent dropped points at home to Zenit St Petersburg to qualify for the last 16, but they were stunned by an already eliminated Lyon side, who picked up their first European win of the season thanks to goals either side of half-time by Maxwel Cornet and Alexandre Lacazette. Neville watched on the from the stands as a depleted Valencia battled back to seal a point against the European champions on Saturday thanks to Santi Mina's late equaliser. However, they didn't reach the same heights in Neville's debut as a head coach as Lyon's pace tore the hosts apart on the counter-attack. ""When you have 10 injuries and the same players play every three days, particularly these type of games -- Sevilla, Barca, tonight versus Lyon -- you get a deterioration of sharpness,"" he said. ""One or two percent goes each time. I know from my own playing career that to have the same level of energy every three days is difficult. ""The effort against Barca was immense, out of this world, but today that same level of sharpness was just missing. It's not a fitness problem but a concern. We need to get players back and more freshness into the squad. ""We must take the defeat on the chin and realise it is unacceptable to lose at Mestalla. It's not something we can take lightly."" The outcome could have been very different had Shkodran Mustafi's early headed goal not been controversially ruled out, but Neville accepted his side had been second best rather than point the finger at Slovenian referee Matej Jug. ""I've not seen the Mustafi goal yet, but players thought it was not a foul,"" he added. ""I can sit here and say if that counts, of course it is a different game. We can sit back and then counter. They scored first, which was important, it allowed them to counter on us rather than vice-versa. ""From that point of view, I used to whinge a lot as a player, but I wont blame refs as a manager unless I feel I have to and tonight I don't have to as Lyon did well in the game, so I won't create headlines about the ref."" A third-place finish in Group H means Valencia drop into the Europa League, just as Manchester United did 24 hours earlier. Neville won 20 trophies with United over a 19-year playing career, but insisted a reunion with the Red Devils was the furthest thing from his mind ahead of his first La Liga game in charge away to Eibar on Sunday. ""We will take the competition seriously number one. Who we draw, and whether we play Man Utd, is the last thing on my mind at moment. ""I'm thinking about recovering for Sunday's league game. At this moment I couldn't care whether we play Man Utd or someone else in the Europa League. I have to think of tomorrow, the next day, and preparing players for Sunday."""
131,09/12/2015,22:51,Lyon consign Neville to nightmare Valencia start,Gary Neville endured the worst possible start to his managerial career as Valencia crashed out of the Champions League due to a 2-0 home defeat to the already eliminated Lyon on Wednesday.,"Goals either side of half-time by Maxwel Cornet on his first Champions League start and Alexandre Lacazette handed the French side their first European win of the season. Belgian champions Gent beat Zenit St Petersburg 2-1 to seal their place in the last 16 behind the Russians in Group H. England coach Neville was set for a baptism of fire after his surprise appointment last week with Valencia needing to win and Gent to drop points to seal their place in the last 16 for the first time in three years. The former Manchester United defender made just two changes from the side that held European champions Barcelona to a 1-1 on Saturday with Joao Cancelo returning from suspension and Shkodran Mustafi fit again to take his place at the heart of the defence. And Mustafi was desperately unlucky not to get Neville off to a flying start inside 10 minutes as he thundered a header off the post and was then penalised for a foul when he did find the net from Valencia's next corner. Lyon were already eliminated from all European competitions and hadn't won any of their last five games in all tournaments. However, the visitors produced an impressive display and Valencia had to count on goalkeeper Jaume Domenech to keep them in the game. Domenech's first fine save came on 11 minutes when he turned Cornet's effort to safety as the 19-year-old bore down on goal. Valencia started the evening without eight first team players through injury and they suffered another setback when Argentina international Enzo Perez hobbled off to be replaced by Javi Fuego. Domenech had to come to Valencia's rescue twice more in quick succession as he denied Corentin Tolisso and Rafael da Silva. At the other end, Lyon 'keeper Anthony Lopes showed he was just as capable of pulling off a big save as he flew to his left to parry Paco Alcacer's header. However, Lyon were handed the half-time lead they deserved by Cornet's stunning solo effort nine minutes before the break as he cut inside before firing into the top corner via a slight deflection off Aymen Abdennour. Neville made a bold move at the start of the second period by throwing on Alvaro Negredo for his first appearance in over two months in place of the more defensively minded Danilo. Yet, despite the home fans roaring on their side with encouragement after Zenit briefly restored parity against Gent, it was Lyon who again posed the greater threat after the break on the counter-attack. Lacazette blasted over from close range before he played in Sergi Darder with a wonderfully timed pass, but the former Malaga midfielder was denied by another fine stop from Domenech. There was nothing the Valencia stopper could do 15 minutes from time, though, as Lacazette was released in behind the defence and the French international sprinted beyond Abdennour before slotting home his second Champions League goal of the season."

""I'm focusing on staying calm. It's impossible to get everything into the players in the next 48 hours. ""We worked on things yesterday and this morning, but it's the simple things that hopefully we can see tomorrow night in the game."" Valencia need to win and hope Belgian champions Gent fail to beat the already qualified Zenit St Petersburg to qualify for the last 16 for the first time in three years. ""Not everything is in our hands, but we have to focus on what we do control. ""If we don't have the result in the other game we want, that's life. The most important thing for us is focusing on our players, our direct opponent."" Neville was hired until the end of the season last week after a series of disappointing results let to Nuno Espirito Santo's departure from the club. However, he watched on from the stands as a revitalised Valencia battled back from a goal down to salvage a 1-1 draw against European champions Barcelona on Saturday. And Neville has his sights set on not just reaching the knockout stages of the Champions League, but a return to the competition next year by finishing in the top four of La Liga. ""We have to aim for the Champions League qualification and we have to try and win all the Cup games. The reality in football, though, is it doesn't always go the way you want,"" he added. ""We're here to win football matches, we're here to entertain starting tomorrow night. ""Lyon is a big game, it sets the benchmark straight away. It gives me an immediate understanding of what our mentality is like."" Neville has already made a good impression with the Valencia fans as he opened up his first full training session to the supporters on Monday with thousands in attendance. ""I was amazed when I was out there,"" he added. ""It's the right thing to do to invite the fans, they get to know the players more. ""From the players' point of view there is maximum intensity when the fans are there because they always want to impress."" The former Manchester United and England full-back has also offered a fresh start to his players with former Manchester City striker Alvaro Negredo returning to the squad for the first time in over two months. Negredo was discarded by Nuno after a disagreement between the two before suffering appendicitis three weeks ago. ""I explained to them that every single player has an opportunity to play. I will treat no player differently than any other. ""I explained to Alvaro he's not played for two or three months and he's had the operation. In my view he's part of the squad, he's in there against Lyon. ""We will try and to build up his match fitness over the next couple of weeks."""

Real Madrid are now just four points behind Barca as they bounced back from their embarrassing elimination from the Copa del Rey for fielding an ineligible player in midweek with Karim Benzema, Gareth Bale and Cristiano Ronaldo all on target in their 4-1 thrashing of Getafe. However, Real remain third, two points behind Atletico Madrid, after goals from Diego Godin and Antoine Griezmann handed Diego Simeone's men a 2-0 win at Granada. Neville doesn't officially take charge until Sunday, leaving Valencia in the hands of caretaker boss Voro and his brother Phil Neville and the depleted hosts put up a brave fight against the superior quality of the European champions. Barcelona should have had the game wrapped up by half-time, but the star front three of Lionel Messi, Neymar and Suarez were uncharacteristically wasteful in front of goal. Messi spooned the first chance over from Neymar's fine cross before the latter ballooned the ball into the stands with just Jaume Domenech to beat. More brilliance on the left wing from Neymar teed up Messi once more, but on his weaker right foot he fired straight at Domenech. Suarez then fluffed his lines when he tried to square for Neymar when clean through only to overhit his cross and see the ball fly to safety. Moments later Suarez was denied a tap-in as Aderlan Santos got just enough of a deflection on Jordi Alba's cross to take the ball away from Suarez. Valencia claimed Suarez was lucky to stay on the field at the start of the second period as he appeared to stamp on Aymen Abdennour's foot after a heated exchange between the two. And Valencia felt even more hard done by when it was Suarez who finally opened the scoring as he squeezed the ball in at Domenech's near post despite latching onto Messi's pass from an offside position. Yet, they made Barca pay for their profligacy when Paco Alcacer held up a long ball over the top and laid the ball perfectly into Mina's path to slam home his first goal for the club. At the Bernabeu, any sign of the fans' frustration at the club's latest gaffe in being eliminated from the Cup due to an administrative error was eased when Benzema fired home from Pepe's fine cross after just five minutes. That was the Frenchman's first goal since being charged in a blackmail scandal involving international teammate Mathieu Valbuena. And he looked back to his best as he doubled Madrid's advantage on 16 minutes when he slotted into the bottom corner from Bale's headed cut-back after Ronaldo appeared to have been fouled inside the area. The one-way traffic continued as Bale showed great composure to finish from Ronaldo's knockdown and score for a second consecutive league game for the first time since January. Ronaldo finally got in on the act three minutes later at the end of a devastating counter-attack as he latched onto Toni Kroos's fine through ball to register his 17th goal of the season. ""To get the three points playing very well in the first half means that these players, who we know are very important, once they get up to speed can cause a lot of damage to any defence,"" said Madrid coach Rafael Benitez. ""The fact Benzema scored those two goals and contributed so much to the team going forward reinforces even more what I have said before that he is a very important player for us and makes those around him play better."" Atletico remained in front of their city rivals thanks to another solid display as they recorded their sixth clean sheet in seven games to extend their winning run in all competitions to six games. Godin powered home the opener from Koke's corner after 20 minutes to give the visitors the perfect start. Griezmann made the game safe in spectacular fashion 14 minutes from time as the French international blasted high into the roof of the net from Oliver Torres's clever through ball."
134,03/12/2015,17:42,"I have got to prove myself, admits Neville",Gary Neville on Thursday said he could not turn down the opportunity to strike out on his own in coaching with La Liga club Valencia but said any doubts about his appointment would be understandable.,"The Manchester United legend has been working as part of Roy Hodgson's backroom staff with the England national team but the 40-year-old has now agreed to take over at the Mestalla until the end of the season, giving up his work as a leading and often outspoken pundit for British broadcaster Sky. ""If I'd turned down this job I could have said goodbye to my credibility,"" Neville told a press conference on Thursday, a day after his appointment was announced by Valencia, who lie ninth in La Liga. Neville admitted that, in his role as a pundit in England, he would have been surprised to see a leading club appoint a foreign coach with no experience of managing at the top level. ""I would be sceptical and want to be proven otherwise. I want to show to the players I am capable of doing this job,"" said Neville, who succeeds Nuno Espirito Santo, the Portuguese who was dismissed after a 1-0 defeat at Sevilla on Sunday. ""The doubts and concerns will only be wiped out by winning football matches. I won't shy away from the direct approach I had on television. ""I have got to prove myself, turn the doubters. I have to provide the answers on football pitch in coming months."" Neville will be assisted by his younger brother Phil and former Valencia player Miguel Angel Angulo and will rely on them for help with the language. ""My biggest challenge will be learning Spanish. I'll need help in that regard. I have to pick up some key phrases as early as possible and learn as quickly as possible,"" he said. Neville said that he sees no reason why he cannot combine the job with his commitments as part of the England coaching staff going into Euro 2016, with friendly matches against Germany and the Netherlands to come in March. ""In terms of the FA, when I spoke to Roy he was incredibly supportive and positive and enthusiastic for me,"" he said. ""He understood completely the opportunity for myself. He was behind me 100 percent. ""We have two games in March in the international break and I want to complete the job through to the European Championship. ""Valencia will be my priority for 95 to 99 percent of the time, apart from those games in March."" The 85-times capped Neville enjoyed a glittering playing career at United under Alex Ferguson and he admitted he had discussed the move with his former mentor. ""I didn't consult Sir Alex but I did speak to him. He offered words of encouragement and support. I would be stupid not to accept that support."" Valencia play Barcelona at home on Saturday but Neville will not take charge of the team until after that match, explaining that he wanted the team's preparations for facing the European champions to be ""consistent"" throughout the week.

""Neville will officially begin his work on Sunday, December 6 ahead of the Champions League match against Lyon which will take place at Mestalla on Wednesday, December 9."" Neville's brother Phil has been at the club since the start of the season, working as an assistant to Nuno Espirito Santo before he left the club after a poor run of results on Sunday. ""I am very excited and feel very proud to have received this great opportunity with Valencia,"" Neville told the club's website. ""It is a huge club of immense prestige and I remember well from my time as a player the great passion and loyalty of their fans."""

Former player Salvador Gonzalez will take charge of the team, assisted by Nuno's assistant, the former Manchester United player Phil Neville, until a permanent appointment is made. Having qualified the team for this season's Champions League, the Portuguese coach leaves with Valencia down in ninth in the table having lost eight of 20 matches this season in all competitions. They also need to beat Lyon in their final Champions League group game to have any chance of reaching the knock-out stages. They host leaders and champions Barcelona this coming weekend in La Liga. Spanish press have touted a number of names as possible replacements including former Argentina coach Alejandro Sabella, former Barca boss Frank Rijkaard, Dane Michael Laudrup and even former Real Madrid, Chelsea and AC Milan coach Carlo Ancelotti."

Zenit, who had won their opening group match 3-2 in Valencia, sat back from the kick-off, giving up possession and threatening on the counter-attack. In the 15th minute, Dzyuba received Hulk's pass from the left and helped the ball on to Shatov, who escaped the offside trap before shooting home from close range. Valencia, who could have secured a last 16 spot with victory, poured forward in search of an equaliser. However, the visitors lacked accuracy in picking out striker Paco Alcacer with long-range passes. After the interval Zenit, spurred on by a capacity 21,000 crowd, moved up a gear pinning Valencia back. Argentinian full back Ezequiel Garay missed a clear chance to increase Zenit's lead in the 58th minute when he headed inches wide from Hulk's corner. Valencia's second-half substitute Santi Mina had the ball in the net in the 67th minute but his strike was ruled out for offside. In the 74th minute, Zenit skipper Miguel Danny played a one-two with Shatov before finding the unmarked Dzyuba, who found the back of the net to secure victory. Valencia's slight hopes to save the day went up in smoke with 10 minutes to go when their Portuguese full back Ruben Vezo was sent off for a professional foul on Shatov."

Victory takes Valencia up to sixth, three points behind Celta in third. Celta had started the day with the chance to move level with Real Madrid and Barcelona at the top of the table. By contrast, Valencia travelled to Galicia with rumours surrounding Nuno's future after a dreadful performance in losing 1-0 to Gent in the Champions League on Wednesday. True to form, Celta dominated the majority of the match, but they suffered just their second defeat of the season thanks to some brilliant Valencia finishing and comical defending from the hosts. Alcacer had once again been named in Vicente del Bosque's Spain squad on Friday despite scoring just once from open play all season. However, he justified the former Real Madrid coach's faith by sweeping home Parejo's pass for the opener on 12 minutes. Celta were deservedly level 11 minutes later when Augusto Fernandez headed home from close range. The home side were then outraged when they had the ball in the net again moments later, but referee Inaki Vicandi Garrido had already blown for a Celta free-kick on the edge of the area. Parejo turned the game on its head just before half-time with a stunning free-kick that found the top corner. Seconds into the second-half it was 3-1 as Alcacer pounced on a short back-pass from Jonny to coolly slot home his second of the afternoon. Alcacer then turned provider for Parejo to score the fourth before Mustafi added a fifth from a corner 13 minutes from time. League leaders Real Madrid and Barcelona are both in action on Sunday in their final match before they clash in El Clasico on November 21. Madrid travel to Sevilla, whilst Barcelona host fifth-placed Villarreal at the Camp Nou."
139,07/11/2015,02:20,Asian tycoons frustrated in hunt for glory,East Asian tycoons are digging deep into their pockets for European football glory but have not got the dividends yet.,"The move by Chinese toys and game video group Rastar this week to take control of heavily indebted Spanish La Liga side Espanyol is the latest example of what experts say are often vanity purchases. The Asian magnates are jostling with Russian oligarchs, oil-fuelled Arab states and American sports groups for control of European teams. ""Some may doubt the economic rationale of certain investments in football,"" said Raffaele Poli, director of the Football Observatory at the International Centre for Sports Studies (CIES) at Neuchatel in Switzerland. ""There may be image questions for these very rich personalities, its a kind of 'folie de grandeur' to want to invest in a sector that is very popular in Asia,"" added the analyst. Espanyol has welcomed Rastar's owner Chen Yansheng as a saviour however. Former club president, Daniel Sanchez Llibre, who was among a group who will receive up to 17.8 million euros ($19.6 million) for up to 56% of the club stock, said Rastar has agreed to pay the club's debts to the Spanish tax man. The sale ""was an opportunity we couldn't miss"", he added. Rastar could inject up to 45 million euros more in the club who live in the shadow of glitzy city neighbours Barcelona. Other Asian tycoons have also ploughed hundreds of millions of dollars into clubs ranging from Indonesian billionaire Erick Thohir at Inter Milan to Singapore tycoon Peter Lim at Valencia. Chinese figures are taking an increasingly strong role. Wang Jianlin, head of the Wanda property giant and a fervent football fan, spent 44 million euros this year on a 20% stake in Atletico Madrid. Even lower level clubs are of interest. A Thai consortium led by businessman Dejphon Chansiri took over English Championship side Sheffield Wednesday this year. Ledus, a lighting company based in Guangzhou province, has bought French second division team Sochaux. French economist Bastien Drut said Spanish and Italian clubs are much more attractive for the Asian tycoons. ""The financial situation of these clubs is bad, they have heavy debts,"" he said. Many might want to get their hands on an English Premier League side. Of the current top four, Manchester City are Abu Dhabi-owned, Arsenal are controlled by American Stan Kroenke, Leicester City by Thai tycoon Vichai Raksriaksorn and Manchester United by the American Glazier family. But the league's television riches and global popularity has put the 20 clubs largely out of reach of an easy takeover, according to Rob Wilson, football finance expert at Sheffield Hallam University in England. He added that UEFA's financial fair play rules could deter the huge investment needed to buy an English club. ""I think potential investors are looking for better value now -- that will come from large clubs that have fallen from prestigious positions in any of the major European leagues,"" said Wilson. Singapore businessman Lim took control of financially-stricken Valencia in October last year, paying an estimated 420 million euros, and bank-rolled a return to the Champions League for the first time in three years. Lim's Meriton group announced last month that it would inject another 100 million euros into Valencia, who are not yet qualified for the Champions League final 16. Italian media said Thohir paid more than 300 million euros for 70% of Inter Milan. The fallen Italian giants have not won the domestic title since 2010 and not been in the Champions League since 2012. Last month they announced another 74 million euro loss. A Thai businessman, Bee Taechaubol, had been in talks for a major stake in city neighbours AC Milan. But the deal with Silvio Berlusconi seems deadlocked. Thohir said that revenues are improving but Inter and Italian football need to compete with the Premier League. ""We need to do more to get a greater visibility for the whole of Serie A in Asia and in the United States,"" he said."

""Rodrigo suffered a partial tear in the posterior cruciate ligament in his left knee,"" a Valencia statement confirmed. Valencia lost 2-1 at Atletico on Sunday and are currently ninth in La Liga. They are however second in Champions League Group H, but Rodrigo will miss their three remaining games against leaders Zenit, Belgians Gent and France's Lyon."
141,19/10/2015,15:36,Valencia boss drops Negredo for Gent visit,Valencia coach Nuno Espirito Santo has left former Spanish international Alvaro Negredo out of his squad for the Champions League visit of Belgian champions Gent on Tuesday as a fall-out between the two escalated.,"Negredo, who played a vital role in getting Valencia back into the group stages for the first time in three years with his away goal in a 4-3 aggregate win over Monaco in the playoffs, was also left out of the squad for Saturday's 3-0 win over Malaga. The former Manchester City striker claimed in an interview with Madrid sports daily Marca last week that the poor return from all of Valencia's forwards this season may be because the coaching staff are asking them to play too far away from goal. ""All the decisions we take for the squad are based in sporting motives,"" Nuno said on Monday. ""We are looking for the best for the team. This is a long year and everyone will be important."" Despite his goal against Monaco, Negredo has failed to live up to his 30 million euro ($34 million) price tag since joining from City at the start of last season. ""I believe in all the players in this squad and it is my obligation as a coach to get the best performance out of every player,"" added Nuno. Victory at the weekend was just Valencia's third in eight league games this season, but a 1-0 win at Lyon last time out in the Champions League has kept them on course to qualify for the last 16. ""It is fundamental to consolidate the sensations and performances from the game against Malaga, but it is a different opponent and a different competition. ""We think we are well-placed in the Champions League, we have two games at home and away to go that will decide our fate."" Australian goalkeeper Matt Ryan again missed out on the squad as he continues to recover from knee surgery, whilst Tunisian international Aymen Abdennour is also absent through injury."

The 23-year-old missed Australia's World Cup qualifying victories against Bangladesh and Tajikistan, as well as Valencia's opening Champions League defeat to Zenit St Petersburg. Ryan could return to action as early as Tuesday when Valencia travel to Lyon in the Champions League."
143,16/09/2015,22:48,Hulk-powered Zenit win at Valencia,Two stunning strikes from Brazilian international Hulk guided Zenit St Petersburg to a 3-2 win at Valencia on Wednesday despite a spirited fightback by the Spanish side.,"Hulk thumped home two powerful efforts to give the Russians a 2-0 half-time lead before Joao Cancelo and Andre Gomes hauled Valencia level after the break. However, the home side's good work was undone when Axel Witsel struck the winner moments later to give Andres Villas-Boas's men the perfect start in Group H. Zenit lead Gent and Lyon by two points after the Belgians salvaged a point with nine men in a 1-1 draw in the other match in the group. Valencia had started the stronger as a Cancelo drive from distance deceived Yuri Lodygin and came back off the post. However, the hosts were stung after just seven minutes by a flowing counter-attack from the Russian champions as Hulk received the ball on his favoured left foot and arrowed a shot into the far corner. The Spanish side were dominant in possession but struggling to create clear-cut chances and were left frustrated when Scottish referee Craig Thomson turned down a strong penalty appeal for a handball by Javi Garcia. Zenit then doubled their advantage in spectacular fashion just before half-time when Hulk took aim from 25 yards and thumped the ball past the helpless Jaume Domenech. Valencia boss Nuno Espirito Santo made a double substitution at the break as Paco Alcacer and Gomes were introduced and both made their presence felt as the hosts roared back in the second-half. Alcacer had a goal narrowly ruled out for offside before Cancelo did half the arrears with an intelligent hit from a narrow angle which caught Lodygin by surprise. Gomes pulled a volley wide from the edge of the area as the pressure from Valencia continued to build. And the Portuguese midfielder then levelled 17 minutes from time with a neat turn and shot that Lodygin should have made a better fist of keeping out. Yet, just when it seemed Valencia were in pole position to complete a famous comeback, Zenit struck the winner as Witsel was left unmarked on the edge of the area and his low drive found the net via the inside of the far post."
144,30/08/2015,01:20,Abdennour swaps Monaco for Valencia,"Tunisian international defender Aymen Abdennour has joined Valencia from Monaco for an undisclosed fee, the Spanish club has confirmed.","""Valencia Football Club has reached an agreement with AS Monaco for the signing of central defender Aymen Abdennour,"" Valencia said in a statement on their website. The deal comes just four days after Valencia dumped Monaco out of the Champions League to qualify for the group stages for the first time in three years. According to reports in the Spanish press, Los Che will pay up to 25 million euros for the 26-year-old. ""Valencia is a big club in Spain and in Europe, I didn't have any doubts,"" said Abdennour. ""I am happy to be here in a serious and ambitious project."" Abdennour will replace Nicolas Otamendi at the heart of the Valencia defence after the Argentine left to join Manchester City earlier this month."
145,25/08/2015,23:01,Valencia survive Monaco comeback to reach Champions League group stage,"Valencia held off Monaco in their Champions League play-off tie to qualify for the group stages, despite a 2-1 second-leg defeat at the Stade Louis II on Tuesday as they progrssed 4-3 on aggregate.","The Spanish side -- two-time runners up in the competition having lost the 2000 and 2001 finals to Real Madrid and Bayern Munich respectively -- held a 3-1 advantage from the first leg and Alvaro Negredo's early second-leg goal proved the difference against the principality club. Valencia started superbly and -- clearly buoyed by Sofiane Feghouli's late third goal in the first leg last Wednesday at the Mestalla -- took a deserved lead when Monaco defender Fabinho gave the ball away and former Manchester City striker Negredo flighted a sumptuous chip over home 'keeper Danijel Subasic from the left side of the penalty box in the fourth minute. Last season's quarter-finalists Monaco had no answer to Valencia's verve and swagger early on and Negredo should have made it two only to blaze over when unmarked in the area after another fine team move. But despite being on the backfoot, Leonardo Jardim's side levelled after 17 minutes. Australian international goalkeeper Mathew Ryan's unconvincing punch fell kindly to Andrea Raggi and the Italian full-back's superb swivel and shot flew into the bottom corner. The La Liga club were all of a sudden looking nervous with Monaco looking stronger and stronger as the first period progressed without properly testing Ryan in the visiting goal. Monaco continued to press and the Ligue 1 side -- 2004 runners-up when they lost 3-0 to Jose Mourinho's Porto -- scored a second after 75 minutes to re-ignite their hopes of progressing. Ryan could only palm a free-kick against the chest of Monaco substitute Guido Carrillo who inadvertantly teed up fellow substitute Elderson with the Nigerian international poking in from a yard out. Monaco huffed and puffed but they couldn't find the third goal which would've forced extra-time. Nuno Espirito Santo's Valencia side came through 4-3 to maintain their record of never having lost a European qualifying tie over two legs. The Spanish side are back in the group stages after a two-year absence, while Monaco fail to reach the group stages for the tenth time in 12 seasons since reaching the final in 2004."
146,21/08/2015,02:05,"Aussie stopper Ryan desperate to face Messi, Ronaldo","The thought of it would cause most goalkeepers nightmares, but Australia and now Valencia's number one Matthew Ryan has waited patiently for the chance to try his hand at stopping the likes of Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi.","Ryan, 23, has taken an unusual route to arrive at one of the world's top leagues having swapped the A-league with Central Coast Mariners for Club Brugges two years ago. A brilliant spell in Belgium allied to being the rock behind Australia's Asia Cup triumph earlier this year brought interest from around Europe, but it was Valencia's ambitious project to be back challenging amongst the elite in the Champions League that attracted Ryan. That ambition remains on track after he played a starring role in a 3-1 win over last season's quarter-finalists Monaco in the first leg of their playoff in midweek with one particular save from Bernardo Silva making a fine first impression on the Mestalla faithful. ""It was a very nice feeling to be honest. I think any young player coming into a team wants to justify himself as quickly as possible and I think that save was a nice confidence booster to feel important within the team,"" he told AFP. ""It's always good to make a save like that where you sort of surprise yourself."" Ryan's move to Valencia has been hailed by Australia's national coach Ange Postecoglou as he aims for more Socceroos to end up at the top level in Europe, but it also comes with a risk. Diego Alves had been one of La Liga's top goalkeepers in recent seasons until he ruptured cruciate ligaments on the final day of last season, leaving Valencia looking for a new 'keeper. Ryan has filled that void for now, but knows he has plenty of hard work ahead of him to keep the Brazilian international on the sidelines when he is fit come the new year. ""I knew my next stop after Brugges I wanted to go somewhere where it is more competitive for spots,"" he added. ""I always wanted to get to the bigger and better leagues to challenge myself, no matter where I would have liked to end up after Brugges I knew I was going to go somewhere where there would be a lot of competition. ""Some of the individual talent in the squad is the best I've been in contact with on a regular basis. I am really enjoying being here and continuing to learn. ""I've got my foot in the door now and hopefully will not give the coach a reason to take me out of the team."" As well as the internal competition Ryan is tasked with stopping an array of the deadliest strikers in world football. The dates with Messi and Ronaldo have been put on the back burner for now, though, as Valencia travel to Rayo Vallecano for their season opener on Saturday. And he believes they can draw inspiration from Atletico Madrid's title triumph two years ago to challenge Real Madrid and Barcelona for silverware come the end of the campaign. ""It's obviously my first time in one of the premier leagues in world football. I'm not expecting any easy games in such a league,"" added Ryan. ""The club is very ambitious. The owners have stated they want to win things in the coming years that is why I play the game. You play to win games, to win silverware and create memories that will remain for the rest of your life. ""Atletico surprised everyone a couple of years ago and won the league. To those sorts of teams we are an underdog but we want to get on a level where we're seen as on a par with those sorts of teams."" Ryan isn't just learning on the pitch with Spanish lessons also high on the agenda to help him communicate with his new teammates. For now he has Valencia's new English assistant manager Phil Neville for company, although he admits to avoiding the former Manchester United man after taking some flak for Australia's defeat in the Ashes. ""There isn't much I can say so I am trying to steer clear of him at the moment until I can get my own back."" Unlike the Aussie batsmen, Ryan is at least one sportsman from Down Under who appears to be thriving in Europe this summer."
147,20/08/2015,11:40,Otamendi signs on for Manchester City,"Argentina defender Nicolas Otamendi has signed for Manchester City, the Premier League side announced on Thursday after a deal was agreed with his current side Valencia.","The 27-year-old has signed a five-year contract although no financial details of the transfer were released. Otamendi will bolster central defensive ranks at City that include two familiar faces in former Porto team-mate Eliaquim Mangala and international colleague Martin Demichelis, as well as captain Vincent Kompany. Otamendi told the club's website, www.mcfc.co.uk: ""I am here to give my best, to fight game by game and push City to the highest peaks for as long as possible, and I wish we will be able to win several cups and titles. ""That's most important. To be here inside a club that looks so wonderful from the outside is a dream."" Valencia were believed to be hoping to use the sale of the player to write off part of the fee they still owe City for striker Alvaro Negredo. Otamendi joined the Spanish club from Porto just a year ago. Initial reports at the weekend claimed Valencia wanted to offset his loss by signing Mangala on loan in exchange but City had no intention of allowing the Frenchman to leave Eastlands. City manager Manuel Pellegrini said: ""Nicolas Otamendi was arguably the best defender in La Liga last season and so naturally I'm delighted to have added a player of his quality. ""He is an established international for one of the best nations in world football and I have no doubt that he has the right mentality to fit into a squad where he will find many familiar faces, including Eliaquim and Fernando who he played alongside in Portugal. Otamendi has 25 caps for Argentina and was a member of the side that reached the Copa America final in the summer alongside new City team-mates Demichelis, Sergio Aguero and Pablo Zabaleta."
148,19/08/2015,22:42,Valencia punish defenceless Monaco,"Goals from Rodrigo, Dani Parejo and Sofiane Feghouli handed Valencia a 3-1 advantage going into the second leg of their Champions League play-off against Monaco at the Mestalla on Wednesday.","The Spanish side got off to the perfect start when Rodrigo tapped home the opener after only four minutes, but Monaco rallied and levelled early in the second-half through Mario Pasalic. However, last season's quarter-finalists were undone by poor defending as Parejo's deflected effort and a late strike from Feghouli put Valencia in the driving seat for a return to the group stages for the first time in three years. The sides will meet again in the principality next Tuesday. Monaco were without the influential Joao Moutinho and Layvin Kurzawa through injury and Kurzawa's replacement Elderson endured a torrid time as Valencia got off to a flying start. The Nigerian allowed Feghouli in behind to head a cross from the left back across goal and that left Rodrigo with the easiest of finishes to put the hosts in front. The visitors had a great chance to strike back almost immediately in an open start to the game, but Anthony Martial failed to connect and the ball was gratefully clutched by Matthew Ryan. Valencia's speed in the wide areas was a constant danger as Feghouli just failed to pick out Paco Alcacer with another burst past Elderson before the Spanish international couldn't stretch far enough to touch home a wonderful delivery from Jose Gaya. Monaco are a much-changed side from the one which reached the last eight last season, but they grew into the game as the first-half wore on and were unfortunate not to be level at the break. Ryan enjoyed his first big moment in a Valencia shirt just after the half hour mark as the Australian international turned Bernardo Silva's drive onto the post from a narrow angle. Martial did find the net moments later, but he was flagged for offside. The French side's persistence was rewarded just four minutes into the second period when a powerful run and cross by Martial was only partially cleared and Pasalic timed his run into the box perfectly to slot home the rebound. Ryan had to be alert once more minutes later to divert another Martial effort to safety. Valencia boss Nuno Espirito Santo introduced Pablo Piatti for Rodrigo de Paul in a bid to turn the tide and the Argentine winger set up Valencia's second with virtually his first touch. Piatti turned a looping cross from the right back into the danger zone and Parejo's deflected effort left Danijel Subasic helpless. Valencia were coping well with the relentless tempo of the game given it was their first competitive match of the season and Parejo could have doubled his tally at the end of a flowing counter-attack, but he fired Feghouli's cross into the stands. The Algerian international made no such mistake four minutes from time, though, when he slammed a loose ball home from just inside the area."
149,18/08/2015,13:23,Monaco more important than Otamendi for Valencia boss,Valencia coach Nuno Espirito Santo insists his side cannot be distracted by the imminent departure of Nicolas Otamendi as they prepare for the first leg of their Champions League playoff against Monaco on Wednesday.,"The Argentine centre-back was Los Che's player of the year last season as they moved to the brink of a return to the Champions League after a three-year absence. However, reports in Spain suggest the 27-year-old is on the verge of a move to Manchester City. ""The most important thing is the game tomorrow,"" said Nuno at his pre-match press conference on Tuesday. ""We have known for some time that we are going to prepare for this game without the option of Otamendi, but the important thing is that we are going to play a fundamental match for us."" A meeting with last season's quarter-finalists was the most difficult tie on offer to Valencia as a seeded side as they hope to make it a record five Spanish teams into the group stages. And Nuno believes it is the most evenly balanced of the qualifiers to be played this week. ""Clearly it is the most balanced playoff. We are two teams with a clear intention of qualifying taking into account the quality of our squads."" Monaco, though, are also hampered by the absence of key players with the influential trio of Joao Moutinho, Layvin Kurzawa and Aymen Abdennour missing out through injury. ""Monaco are a very good team with a lot of variety and players of great quality,"" added Nuno. ""We know that they won't be at full strength, but we can't think that is going to make it easier."""
150,18/08/2015,02:25,Otamendi-less Valencia desperate for CL return,Valencia will have to cope without Argentine international Nicolas Otamendi as they attempt to move a step closer to ending a three-year absence from Champions League group action when they host Monaco on Wednesday.,"Otamendi is expected to complete a lucrative move to Manchester City in the coming days, the timing of which is far from ideal for Nuno Espirito Santo's men as they prepare for two games against last season's quarter-finalists that could make or break their season. ""We are concentrated on the game against Monaco. What happens with Otamendi is out of our control,"" Valencia defender Antonio Barragan admitted on Monday. ""We need to go through. It hasn't crossed our minds we won't go through the qualifier."" Otamendi's departure is the latest episode of an unsettling summer for Valencia which was compounded by drawing the toughest opponents they could have faced at this stage in Monaco. Hampered by financial fair play regulations and a number of compulsory purchase agreements on loan deals agreed for players last summer, Nuno hasn't been able to significantly improve the squad that pipped Sevilla to a top four finish on the final day of the La Liga season. Australian international Matthew Ryan is expected to make his debut in goal for the Spaniards with Diego Alves ruled out for the rest of the year due to cruciate ligament damage. Santi Mina and Zakaria Bakkali could also make their competitive bows, but both are likely to start on the bench. Monaco's preparations for the tie have also been far from smooth after suffering a double injury blow in a disappointing 0-0 draw at home to Lille on Friday. Portuguese midfielder Joao Moutinho will miss both legs after being ruled out for four to six weeks with ankle ligament damage, whilst Lavyin Kurzawa is a doubt as he too suffered an ankle knock. In contrast to Valencia, Monaco are also a much changed side from the one that surprisingly reached the last eight last season. The likes of Yannick Ferreira-Carrasco and Geoffrey Kondogbia were sold on with eight new players coming in. Ivan Cavaleiro is one of the new recruits who has experience of facing Valencia from his time at Deportivo la Coruna last season and knows what a tough task the French side face to make it back into the group stages. ""Valencia are a great team. They had a great season last year and that is where they are in the position to play for a place in the Champions League,"" he told the club's website. ""They have great players and it will be a very tough tie for us."""

Valencia president Layhoon Chan, who has been in charge since Amadeo Salvo stepped down on July 1, said it hadn't been easy finding a goalkeeper who could meet the challenges of the Champions League. However, Chan said Ryan -- who played 58 times for Bruges last season as they finished second in their league race -- fitted the bill. ""Matthew maybe young, but he is ambitious and has great potential,"" Chan was quoted as saying on the club's website. ""What is more he has experience at both European and international level, notably at last year's World Cup finals."""
152,18/07/2015,16:10,Mueller Bayern's hero as Germans win in China,"Thomas Mueller put Bayern Munich on their way to a comfortable 4-1 victory over Valencia in a friendly in Beijing Saturday, with two stunning first half goals for the German champions.","The German World Cup winning striker struck twice against the Spaniards to give Bayern fans a huge lift following the departure of midfielder Bastian Schweinsteiger to Manchester United last Monday. Mueller opened the scoring on 16 minutes, collecting the ball from captain Philipp Lahm before twisting his body and smashing home with his right foot on the edge of the penalty area. Valencia equalised ten minutes later when Rodrigo nodded in from close range, but it was a another link up between Lahm and Mueller which put the Germans ahead again. Lahm found Mueller in space after the powerful striker cleverly moved away from his markers. Mueller then stroked home with his left foot to reclaim the lead for the Bundesliga side moments before half time. Spaniard Thiago Alcantara extended Bayern's lead before Valencia could get into their stride following the break, sliding onto a low cross on 54 minutes. Polish striker Robert Lewandowski then put the game out of reach with a curling shot mid-way through the half. Bayern's victory at the Bird's Nest -- the main venue for the 2008 Olympic Games -- was their first match of a three game tour of China. They will meet Italian side Internazionale in the commercial hub of Shanghai on Tuesday before heading into a clash with Chinese champions Guangzhou Evergrande in the country's south on Thursday. The team arrived in China without a handful of stars, including French winger Franck Ribery, Dutch midfielder Arjen Robben, and Brazilian defender Dante, who are all injured. Schweinsteiger, who had been a constant in the success of Bayern over recent years, moved to United for a reported £14m (19.47m euros, $21.72m)."

""I am very young and it is a big step for me to join a club with the tradition and qualities of Valencia CF, in such an attractive and competitive league,"" said Bakkali, who had turned down a new contract with PSV and had been wanted by Celtic. ""I had decided a while ago that I wanted to continue my career away from Eindhoven and I had many options from which to choose."" Bakkali, who started out as a youth at Standard Liege, made his full international debut for Belgium against Wales in a World Cup qualifier in October 2013.

That point was enough to ensure Atletico go straight into next season's Champions League group stages in third, whilst Valencia twice came from behind to win 3-2 at Almeria and secure fourth. Eibar's remarkable first season in the top flight didn't have fairy tale ending as they were relegated despite just a second win in 20 matches 3-0 at home to Cordoba Athletic Bilbao also secured European football for next season in the Europa League thanks to a 4-0 thrashing of Villarreal."
158,27/04/2015,22:58,Valencia move past Sevilla into fourth,Valencia moved into Champions League contention on Monday with a 4-0 win at home against relegation-threatened Granada.,"Javi Fuego's header and Faniel Parejo's penalty had the hosts well in command at the break, with late efforts from Sofiane Feghouli and Alvaro Negredo completing the scoring. Valencia's 20th La Liga win of the campaign lifted them two points clear of Sevilla and into fourth and contention for a place in the Champions League play-offs next season. The next instalment in the battle for the final Champions League spot sees Europa League holders Sevilla on the road at Eibar on Wednesday with Valencia at Rayo Vallecano 24 hours later. On Sunday, Javier Hernandez struck twice as Real Madrid kept the pressure on Barcelona at the top of La Liga by reducing the Catalans' lead to two points with a 4-2 win at Celta Vigo. While Real must still face Valencia and Sevilla, Barca have a more comfortable run-in to the end of the season, starting with the visit of Getafe on Tuesday."
159,18/04/2015,20:51,Scrappy win huge boost for Barca - Luis Enrique,Barcelona boss Luis Enrique hailed his players efforts despite a far from convincing display in a 2-0 win over Valencia on Saturday.,"Goals in the first minute from Luis Suarez and last minute from Lionel Messi, his 400th for the club, bookended a match in which Valencia enjoyed the majority of the chances and were left to rue Dani Parejo's missed penalty in the first-half. However, Enrique was quick to highlight the merit in Barca ending Valencia's 10-game unbeaten run in La Liga just four days after all but sealing their place in the Champions League quarter-finals with a 3-1 victory away to Paris Saint-Germain. ""It is a great result and a day to congratulate the players, who gave everything, and the fans who were immense,"" said Enrique. ""It was a complete day, we did the job and now the pressure is on others. Barca come out of the game greatly strengthened."" Seeing Paco Alcacer miss a hat-trick of good chances on top of Parejo's missed penalty, Enrique introduced Ivan Rakitic for Adriano at half-time in a tactical rejig that restricted the visitors to far fewer chances after the break. ""It was a different game to all those we have played at the Camp Nou. We had a marvellous start with the goal, and then we had a lot of problems overcoming their pressing. ""We committed errors that we don't normally and they had a lot of chances and deserved a bit more. ""In the second-half we made a change because Adriano had a yellow card and it went well, the game was more like what we wanted."" Valencia boss Nuno Espirito Santo, meanwhile, was left to reflect on what might have been after dominating the first 45 minutes. ""We played very well in the first-half and had a lot of good chances,"" he said. ""We go away hurt, sad and angry because we wanted to win. In the first-half we had too many chances to end up with this result."" Defeat leaves Valencia now four points adrift of third-placed Atletico Madrid and just three ahead of Sevilla, who play their game in hand against Granada on Sunday. ""We are proud but not satisfied because playing so well doesn't mean anything when you lose. ""We have an important objective but we need to keep picking up points."""
160,20/03/2015,23:14,Valencia maintain title push with Elche thrashing,Valencia moved to within five points of La Liga leaders Barcelona with a 4-0 rout of Elche on Friday.,"Andre Gomes pounced after Przemyslaw Tyton could only parry Sofiane Feghouli's driven cross a minute before half-time to put the visitors in front. Paco Alcacer then responded to the disappointment of being left out of Vicente del Bosque's Spain squad earlier in the day with a poacher's finish from Gomes's cross for his seventh goal of the season to put the result beyond doubt after the break. An Enzo Roco own goal and Nicolas Otamendi's stoppage time header rounded off the scoring as Los Che moved four points clear of fourth-placed Atletico Madrid. Atletico are in action when they face Getafe on Saturday, whilst the top two go head-to-head on Sunday as Barcelona host Real Madrid at the Camp Nou."
161,02/02/2015,22:45,Malaga condemn 10-man Valencia to defeat,Valencia missed the chance to move back up into fourth in La Liga as they suffered a 1-0 defeat away to Malaga on Monday.,"Samu Casillejo's flicked header to register his first La Liga goal on 25 minutes was enough to move Malaga back to within three points of the European places in seventh. Hopes of a Valencia comeback were hampered 16 minutes from time when Joao Cancelo was dismissed for a second bookable offence. However, they were desperately unlucky not to snatch a point in stoppage time when Rodrigo de Paul's deflected effort flashed inches wide with Malaga 'keeper Carlos Kameni stranded. Sevilla lead Valencia by a point in the race for the fourth and final Champions League spot and can extend that advantage should they avoid defeat when they travel to face Real Madrid at the Santiago Bernabeu on Wednesday."
162,17/01/2015,22:00,Negredo winner lifts Valencia up to third,Former Manchester City striker Alvaro Negredo came off the bench to score the winner as Valencia moved into third in La Liga thanks to a thrilling 3-2 win over Almeria on Saturday.,"The hosts went in front twice in the first-half through captain Dani Parejo and Rodrigo, but on both occasions the lead lasted barely a few minutes as Tomer Hemed's double sent the sides in level at half-time. However, Almeria couldn't respond after Negredo powered home Jose Gaya's cross seven minutes from time to secure all three points. Victory moves Valencia above champions Atletico Madrid on goal difference, but Diego Simeone's men can retake third place should they avoid defeat against struggling Granada on Sunday. Valencia had been surprisingly dumped out of the Copa del Rey by Espanyol in midweek, but seemed on course to make amends when Parejo played a neat one-two with Antonio Barragan before slotting in at the near post. However Hemed responded with a near post finish of his own from Arsenal loanee Wellington Silva's cross. Rodrigo restored Valencia's lead with a tap in from Paco Alcacer's scuffed shot, but Hemed levelled again when his header deflected in off Andre Gomes. Negredo was introduced by Nuno Espirito Santo just before the hour mark and nearly made an immediate impact as he bullied two defenders out the way only to see his headed effort saved by Julian Cuesta. Alcacer then smashed a shot off the underside of the bar as the home side continued to push for a winner, and they were rewarded seven minutes from time when Negredo's towering back post header left Cuesta with no chance. Villarreal remained just three points adrift of Valencia with a 2-0 win over Athletic Bilbao at El Madrigal. Real Madrid loanee Denis Cheryshev opened the scoring with a neat finish from a narrow angle two minutes before half-time. Bruno Soriano then sealed the win from the penalty spot after Oscar de Marcos had been harshly penalised for handball seven minutes from time. Earlier, David Moyes's unbeaten home record as Real Sociedad boss came to an end as former Manchester United striker Manucho handed Rayo Vallecano a 1-0 win at Anoeta on Saturday. In a game of few clear-cut chances, the Angolan rose highest to power home Roberto Trashorras's corner 10 minutes from time. Despite beating Barcelona earlier this month, Moyes has now overseen just two wins in eight league games since taking charge in November. ""I think the disappointment has been that we had the chance to move into the top half of the table, but now we have to look below us,"" said Moyes. ""Until today we had only lost once and today we didn't deserve to lose."" Defeat leaves Sociedad still just three points off the relegation zone in 13th, whilst Rayo move up to ninth."
163,04/01/2015,19:55,Madrid not affected by Valencia shock - Ancelotti,Real Madrid boss Carlo Ancelotti insists his side's confidence will not be shaken after Valencia came from behind to end the European champions' 22-game winning streak on Sunday with a 2-1 win at Mestalla.,"Defeat leaves Los Blancos just a point ahead of title rivals Barcelona and Atletico Madrid with a visit to Atletico in the Copa del Rey to come on Wednesday. Cristiano Ronaldo had fired the visitors into an early lead from the penalty spot, but Ancelotti was left to bemoan key missed chances by the Portuguese and Gareth Bale either side of Antonio Barragan's equaliser for Valencia as Nicolas Otamendi headed home the winner 25 minutes from time. ""I don't think we deserved to lose because we just didn't have the luck to score when we had the chances to make it 2-0, then to go ahead 2-1 and finally at the end when we had many chances to make it 2-2,"" said the Italian. ""There were important points of the match where we didn't take our chances, but as I've said in football this happens. You can't always be efficient up front. ""I think we worked hard and had chances. We were always dangerous but we didn't score. ""I don't think it will affect the team. As I said it has happened after 22 victories. The season is very long and we are well-positioned in La Liga and have a lot of competitions. This won't affect us because we know all the things we have done well until now."" Ancelotti surprisingly withdrew the star trio of Bale, James Rodriguez and Karim Benzema in the search for an equaliser in the second-half. However, the 55-year-old denied he is concerned about the physical condition of his squad ahead of a demanding January schedule which could see Real face Atletico and Barca four times in the Cup, as well as Liga encounters with Espanyol, Getafe, Cordoba and Real Sociedad. ""We knew what the schedule would be and that Valencia are a strong team, above all this year. We prepared well for the game and we played well. We congratulate Valencia, who played well, and now we have to prepare for the next game. ""For the game on Wednesday we need to think how to play better to win the game. I think physically the team showed it is in good shape, especially in the final part of the game."" Sergio Ramos also pleaded for calm after a glorious run and end to 2014 which saw Madrid win four trophies in the same year for the first time. ""I'm hurt by the loss of three points and the end of the run, but there is a long way to go in the league. We didn't brag about our victories before the match nor will we throw the towel in on La Liga now. ""If anything has characterised this group it is the humility and work and this will not change that. It will make us stronger. We will continue to grow as a team for sure."""

166,30/11/2014,23:56,Busquets grabs last-gasp victory,Barcelona snatched a vital 1-0 win away to Valencia on Sunday thanks to Sergio Busquets's volleyed winner deep into stoppage time.,"The Spanish international pounced after Diego Alves had made a great save from Neymar's header to ensure Barca close to within two points of leaders Real Madrid. And on a day overshadowed by the death of a Deportivo la Coruna fan in violent clashes before Atletico Madrid's 2-0 win over the Galicians, there were more unsavoury scenes at Mestalla as Lionel Messi was struck on the head by a plastic bottle thrown from the crowd with Barca celebrating the winner. A first home defeat of the season means Valencia remain nine points off the top in fifth. ""We were lucky to score in the last minute. These are three points that will give us a huge boost,"" Busquets told Canal Plus. ""We never settle for a draw, we tried in every way possible and in the end it came from a corner. We had been attacking them for a few minutes and when the ball fell to me from Alves I gave it everything I had."" Valencia boss Nuno Espiritu Santo, meanwhile, was left to lament the chances his side failed to convert in the second-half. ""We had good moments in the match and very clear opportunities to score. Barca also had chances to give them their due,"" he said. ""But we had such clear chances and could easily have won."" Barca boss Luis Enrique signalled how exacting a test he expected his side to face by naming Javier Mascherano alongside Busquets in midfield for the first time in his tenure. However, they struggled to control the game in the early stages as Rodrigo forced Claudio Bravo into an early save with a rasping drive. Barca slowly grew into the game, but their better chances arrived via long balls towards Neymar, while Luis Suarez ought to have put the visitors in front on 14 minutes. Neymar laid Gerard Pique's pass from the back into the path of the Uruguayan, but he fired straight at Alves with just the Brazilian goalkeeper to beat. Barca were then fortunate not to be reduced to 10 men when Neymar appeared to headbutt Nicolas Otamendi, but the incident went unseen by referee Fernandez Borbalan. Andre Gomes twice came close to giving Valencia a half-time lead as he curled a shot from the edge of the area just wide before firing into the side-netting from a narrow angle after rounding Bravo. The hosts also started the brighter after the break, but Rodrigo failed to connect with a volley when well-placed inside the area. Suarez passed up another great chance when he anticipated Otamendi's header back to Alves and robbed the ball ahead of the keeper, but then shot into the side-netting with the goal gaping. Moments later it was Valencia who came close as the game swung from one end to the other, Pique clearing Rodrigo's drive off his own goalline. Suarez's frustrating night continued as he was wrongly flagged offside when he did finally find the net from Dani Alves's cross. Yet, in their push for a winner, Barca were opened up on the counter-attack and had Bravo to thank for making a fine save to prevent Sofiane Feghouli from opening the scoring. The Chilean keeper had to be at his best again 12 minutes from time to beat Alvaro Negredo's sweetly struck volley to safety. And those interventions were to prove crucial as three minutes into stoppage time Alves parried Neymar's header from Messi's tempting cross and Busquets was on hand to force the ball home despite the goalkeeper's best efforts to keep it out."
167,04/10/2014,18:57,Valencia move top with early blitz of Atletico,Valencia moved top of La Liga with three goals in the opening 13 minutes to beat champions Atletico Madrid 3-1 at the Mestalla on Saturday.,"Atletico paid for their efforts in beating Italian champions Juventus in midweek as Miranda gifted the hosts the opener with a comical own goal before Andre Gomes and Nicolas Otamendi rounded off a dream start for Los Che. Mario Mandzukic reduced the arrears on the half hour mark, but any hopes of an Atletico comeback were halted when Diego Alves saved Guillherme Siqueira's tame penalty just before half-time and they ended the match with 10 men as substitute Alessio Cerci was sent-off in stoppage time. Valencia move three points ahead of third-placed Atletico and a point clear of Barcelona, but the Catalans can reclaim top spot should they avoid defeat at Rayo Vallecano later on Saturday. ""Valencia started very strongly and we made mistakes that we don't usually make,"" said Atletico boss Diego Simeone. ""After that Atletico played very well and they didn't have any more chances. If we had scored the penalty, perhaps it would have been different."" Valencia coach Nuno Espirito Santo refused to specify what would classify as a success for his side come the end of the season, but believes they can get even better with star summer signing Alvaro Negredo set to return from injury after the upcoming international break. ""Our objective is to keep growing and keep improving as individuals and as a team. ""Today is a great day for us, but I am very optimistic and I think we will improve."" Miranda inexplicably tried to intercept Shkodran Mustafi's cross which was sailing easily into the arms of Atletico 'keeper Miguel Angel Moya and only succeeded in turning the ball into his own net after just six minutes. A minute later things got even worse for Miranda as Gomes turned the Brazilian as he rampaged through the heart of the Atletico defence before smashing the ball low past the helpless Moya. Atletico were even struggling at their normal forte of set-pieces as Otamendi then rose unchallenged to power home the third from Pablo Piatti's corner. The visitors showed some heart to end the half the stronger and were back in the game when Alves could only parry Tiago's powerful effort and Mandzukic was on hand to nod home his fourth goal of the season. And Simeone's men could even have got back to 3-2 before the break as Jose Gaya was harshly penalised for a handball inside his own area, but Alves continued his fine penalty saving record with a comfortable stop from Siqueira's weak effort. That save punctured Atletico's momentum and Valencia were able to keep Los Rojiblancos at bay in a far less eventful second-half. Indeed the best chance fell to Valencia as Spanish international Paco Alcacer fired just over at the near post as he latched onto Gaya's low cross. Atletico's bad day was rounded off in injury time as Cerci had a goal ruled out and was shown a second yellow card for deliberate handball meaning he will miss Espanyol's visit to the Vicente Calderon in two weeks' time."
168,03/10/2014,02:14,New-look Valencia face toughest test yet in Atletico,Valencia's fine early season form will be put to the test when they host champions Atletico Madrid in the game of the La Liga weekend on Saturday.,"Los Che sit just two points adrift of leaders Barcelona in second after an unbeaten start to life under new boss Nuno Espirito Santo after six games. However, they will face their toughest test of the campaign to date as Atletico visit fresh from beating Italian champions Juventus in the Champions League in midweek. And in-form striker Paco Alcacer, who has scored four times already this season, is hoping Diego Simeone's men will suffer a hangover from their efforts on Wednesday. ""We have prepared very well all week. It is clear that Atletico played a very hard game in the Champions League and could be a little tired,"" said the Spanish international. Alcacer, though, is aware of the challenge that faces his side as they aim to compete with Atletico to challenge the traditional powers of Barca and Real Madrid at the top of La Liga. ""We have already seen last year what Atletico can do. They won the league and got to the final of the Champions League. ""The numbers are in their favour and they are the favourites, but we are playing at home and have to go for it."" Valencia will again have to do without big money summer signing Alvaro Negredo, as he now hopes to make his debut for the club after the international break in two weeks' time. Atletico should have captain Gabi back fit after he missed out in midweek with an ankle injury and Simeone could hand starts to Antoine Griezmann and Alessio Cerci as he looks to freshen up his starting line-up. A win for Valencia would take them temporarily at least back to the top of the table as Barca are in action later on Saturday away at Rayo Vallecano. The Catalans were beaten for the first time this season away to Paris Saint-Germain and also saw their run without conceding a goal come to an end in a 3-2 defeat. Claudio Bravo will return in goal, whilst Gerard Pique and Marc Bartra are expected to come back into the centre of defence after Javier Mascherano and Jeremy Mathieu were found wanting in Paris. The positives for Barca from that match came from Lionel Messi and Neymar as both scored excellent goals to continue their fine form so far this season. And Messi believes their on the field relationship will flourish during the Brazilian's second season in Barcelona. ""It's the second season that we're playing together and we're starting to know each other better,"" Messi said on Thursday. ""Also this season the Barca strikers are playing more in the middle of the pitch so we can pick each other out more and find connections. It's a pleasure to play with him."" Despite a run of three consecutive league wins, Real Madrid are still languishing down in sixth, four points behind Barca. Los Blancos could be even further adrift by the time they host struggling Athletic Bilbao at the Santiago Bernabeu on Sunday. Athletic finished fourth last season to qualify for the Champions League for the first time in 16 years, but are currently only out of the relegation zone on goal difference. Real boss Carlo Ancelotti handed a rest from the start to Dani Carvajal, Toni Kroos, James Rodriguez and Karim Benzema in Wednesday's 2-1 win over Ludogorets Razgrad. The latter three were all needed though as they were introduced before Benzema struck a late winner in Bulgaria and will return to the starting line-up on Sunday. Fixtures (all times GMT)"

Dani Parejo then doubled the hosts' advantage just after the hour mark and Paco Alcacer rounded off his fine week after scoring on his competitive international debut for Spain against Macedonia when he made it 3-0 17 minutes from time. A Sergio Garcia penalty in stoppage time was all Espanyol could muster as they remain without a win so far this season. Sevilla also moved onto seven points from three games with a 2-0 win over Getafe at the Sanchez Pizjuan. Colombian international Carlos Bacca converted from the penalty spot a minute before half-time and Aleix Vidal sealed the three points late on. Valencia sit second on goal difference ahead of Sevilla with champions Atletico Madrid in fourth also just two points adrift of Barcelona. Granada also remain unbeaten on five points after they played out a 0-0 draw at home to Villarreal. And Elche edged Rayo Vallecano 3-2 in the day's early game to move into the top half of the table with their first victory of the new campaign."

""Valencia football club have reached a agreement with Manchester City for the loan, with obligatory option to buy, of the Spanish international striker Alvaro Negredo,"" said a statement on Valencia's website. Negredo joined City from Sevilla last year for a reported fee of £16 million ($27.3 million, 20.3 million euros) and played a major role in Manuel Pellegrini's side's Premier League and League Cup success last season. The 29-year-old scored 23 goals in 49 appearances in all in England, but was hampered in the second-half of the season by injury, which led to him being excluded from Vicente del Bosque's World Cup squad. Negredo hasn't yet featured this season after breaking a bone in his foot during a pre-season friendly in July and is expected to return to action in October. The deal seals a busy final day of the transfer window for Los Che as they also signed Brazilian midfielder Filipe Augusto on loan from Rio Ave. Veteran Portuguese international Helder Postiga meanwhile had his contract with the club rescinded to sign a one-year deal with Deportivo la Coruna and Jonathan Viera has joined Standard Liege"
173,12/08/2014,22:56,Van Gaal victorious in Old Trafford opener,Louis van Gaal's first match at Old Trafford as Manchester United manager ended in victory after Marouane Fellaini's injury-time goal sealed a 2-1 friendly win over Spanish side Valencia on Tuesday.,"The Dutch boss, who took over after leading the Netherlands to third place at the World Cup last month, was left with plenty to ponder ahead of Saturday's Premier League opener against Swansea. Wayne Rooney, captain for the night, missed a penalty but Darren Fletcher drove in United's opener shortly after the interval only for Rodrigo to equalise in the 71st minute before Fellaini scored his first goal in United colours. Van Gaal, given the task of returning United to winning ways after David Moyes, Alex Ferguson's chosen successor was sacked towards the end of a season where the club finished seventh in the Premier League, received a huge cheer as he emerged from the tunnel to supervise the warm-up. He also endeared himself to the United fans by greeting lots of them at the front of the South Stand as he made his way to the dug-out after half-time. With Robin van Persie, Danny Welbeck, Jonny Evans, Antonio Valencia, Nani, Anderson and Wilfried Zaha, as well as the injured Michael Carrick, among those watching from the stands, van Gaal selected a makeshift side. Defender Tyler Blackett, who has featured regularly throughout pre-season, started as one of three centre-backs, with Ashley Young and Reece James playing as wing-backs. Although under less pressure, the defence retained the ball far better than in their recent 3-1 friendly win over Liverpool. Ander Herrera, making his first home appearance since joining from Athletic Bilbao, impressed with his willingness to dictate play sitting in front of the back four. But van Gaal will want to see much more from his new team when the competitive action starts on Saturday. Nuno Santo's Valencia do not begin their La Liga campaign until they face Sevilla on August 23 but they started with the greater impetus, midfielder Sofiane Feghouli driving over from distance in the early stages. The visitors looked sharp on the break and after Herrera was robbed by Feghouli, Rodrigo's clever pass put the midfielder through only for Feghouli to shoot straight at David de Gea. United had the chance to move in front when a great ball from Herrera picked out Young and the wing-back's first time cross looked set to be headed in by Rooney only for the forward to go down dramatically under Antonio Barragan's challenge. The England striker struck the spot-kick against the post but United took the lead three minutes into the second half. Young's corner was flicked on by Mata and Fletcher's deflected effort from the edge of the area beat goalkeeper Diego Alves. Valencia almost drew level when Rodrigo found space behind the United defence but defender Phil Jones pulled off an impressive sliding challenge to divert the ball. But with just under 20 minutes remaining, the visitors did manage an equaliser when Tom Cleverley, one of several United substitutes on just after the hour mark, failed to deal with a whipped Pablo Piatti free-kick that Rodrigo turned in at the far post. Valencia should have had a second goal when Piatti turned the ball past the near post after getting on the end of Rodrigo's cross. United substitute Adnan Januzaj opened up the Valencia defence with a sliding pass only for Rooney to lift his shot over from 20 yards. Fellaini is reportedly facing an uncertain future at United, a year after he joined from Everton, but he controlled a long ball forward from Blackett before rolling his shot into an empty net."
174,21/07/2014,22:23,Valenica release Ricardo Costa,Valencia said Monday it has released Portugual's World Cup defender Ricardo Costa a year before the end of his contract.,"The Spanish side reached an ""amicable"" agreement with the 33-year-old defender who moved to Valencia in 2010, it said in a statement. Costa made his name in a seven season spell at FC Porto where he won the Champions League in 2004. He moved to Wolfsburg in Germany in 2007 and following five months with Lille in early 2010 signed for Valencia. Monday's accord allows Costa, reportedly the highest paid member of the Valencia squad and its captain last season, to find a new side with a free transfer. ""These have been years of great happiness where I felt the support of the fans through the good and bad times,"" Costa said on the club website. Meanwhile, Serbian goalkeeper Branimir Aleksic has moved from Spartak Subotica to Greek Super League side Kalloni. Aleksic, 23, played once for the Serbian national team in 2012.

175,02/07/2014,18:52,Valencia fire coach after half season,"Six-time Spanish champions Valencia have sacked coach Juan Antonio Pizzi after just six months in the job, the club announced on Wednesday.","Valencia, who finished eighth in the first division last season, said they fired the 46-year-old Argentinian to give ""stability to the future sporting plans"" of the team, which has been sold to Singapore businessman Peter Lim. ""The Valencia board, after analysing all the possibilities at this complex and crucial point of time for shareholders, has taken the decision to dispense with the services of Juan Antonio Pizzi as coach,"" the club said in a statement. ""Valencia Football Club wish the best of luck to Pizzi and his coaching staff, who have worked with the team with professionalism and dedication."" Pizzi, a former striker with Valencia, was only appointed to the coaching job on December 26 to replace Serbian Miroslav Djukic, who also survived just six months before being axed. Singapore's Lim took a controlling stake of the financially-stricken club after his bid to buy a 70 percent stake was unanimously accepted in May by the club's foundation. Valencia bosses had been looking for investors since principal creditor Bankia refused back in December to refinance the combined 306 million euro ($530 million) debt the club and its foundation had with the bank.

Fans applauded Real goalkeeper and captain Iker Casillas as, following tradition, he leant over the side of the bus and wrapped a Madrid insignia and club scarf around the statue of the Roman goddess that adorns a fountain in the square. The victory bus drove three times around the fountain as fans twirled Real scarves in the air and took photos of the players. ""Winning the cup is fantastic, winning against Barcelona is even better,"" said Ezequiel Munoz, a 20-year-old student who came to the  square with a group of friends after the match. ""We are going to celebrate all night long,"" added Munoz, who wore a black and white Real jersey with the name of the club's defender Sergio Ramos on its back. Gareth Bale scored a stunning individual goal five minutes from time to secure Real Madrid's 19th Copa del Rey at the Mestalla in Valencia on Wednesday. The jubilant crowd had started gathering around the stage set up by the fountain in the middle of the square as soon as the final whistle blew on Real Madrid's win. The celebrating fans included large groups of teenagers, fathers with their young sons, elderly couples and a few people with dogs wearing Real scarves around their necks. Fans chanted, set off firecrackers and danced in the streets while they waited for the players to arrive, as images of a football and a trophy along with the word ""champions"" were beamed onto the walls of city hall. ""I am very happy. I had no doubts that they were going to win because I saw that Madrid's defence was very tight and the counter attack was very well studied,"" said Juan Moreno, a 61-year-old Venezuelan plumber who waved a large Real Madrid flag. After failing to win the cup competition between 1993 and 2011, Real Madrid have now won it twice in the last four years. ""Real Madrid is the best club in the world, they deserve this win, they are playing very well,"" said Adel Aboukar, 24, sporting a black blazer and jeans as he joined the celebrations with a friend after watching the match in a nearby bar. Madrid city hall deployed 170 police to monitor the celebrations. Emergency services said they treated 16 people for dizziness, anxiety attacks and minor injuries, mainly cuts and bruises due to falls. Real Madrid's win made the front pages of Spain's newspapers on Thursday. ""Bale's Cup,"" wrote centre-right daily El Mundo on its front page while top-selling daily newspaper El Pais wrote ""A ray from Bale decides the Cup"" below a photo of Casillas raising the trophy in the air."

178,03/02/2014,02:06,Football: Ancellotti unhappy at Ronaldo red card,Real Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti accused Athletic Bilbao's Carlos Gurpegi of exaggerated theatrics in the action that led to Cristiano Ronaldo's sending off in a 1-1 draw on Sunday.,"The recently crowned Ballon d'Or winner was given his marching orders 15 minutes from time, with the score already at 1-1, for appearing to hit out at Gurpegi after having a penalty appeal turned down. The away draw leaves Real three points behind La Liga leaders Atletico Madrid, who moved to the top of the table with a 4-0 win over Real Sociedad earlier on Sunday. Ronaldo is now likely to be banned for another crucial league encounter against Villarreal next weekend and Ancelotti wasn't convinced his star man deserved to see red. ""I think it is difficult for me to judge because I wasn't there, but the images show that it was an exaggerated reaction,"" said the Italian. Brazilian defender Marcelo was stronger in his criticism of the decision. ""It is hard when you lose a player in an unjust manner. It is obvious that the decision wasn't fair and that made it very difficult, although our intention is to win every game,"" he told Spanish TV station Canal Plus. ""Athletic are a very good team, but we had bad luck today."" After withstanding some intense pressure from Athletic in the opening 45 minutes, Madrid looked set for an 11th consecutive victory in all competitions as Ronaldo's cross was turned home by Jese Rodriguez. However, a stunning strike from Ibai Gomez brought the hosts level before Ronaldo clashed with Gurpegi. Madrid then had Diego Lopez to thank for salvaging a point as the keeper tipped over another dipping effort from Gomez before denying Aritz Aduriz late on. ""The game was difficult for both teams,"" added Ancelotti. ""In the first-half Athletic pressed a lot and that made it difficult to play the ball on the ground so we played more on the counter-attack. ""In the second-half, the intensity of their pressure dropped a bit and we played better in possession, we scored and had good control of the game. ""Bilbao scored a fantastic goal, but in general I personally am satisfied with how Real Madrid played."" Following Barcelona's shock 3-2 defeat at home to Valencia on Saturday, Atletico took advantage of the Catalans slip up to become outright leaders for the first time since they won the league in 1996. On an emotional evening at the Vicente Calderon as former players and the paid homage to former Spain and Atletico player and manager Luis Aragones, who died on Saturday, David Villa settled the early nerves as he turned home the opener eight minutes form half-time. And after a spirited challenge from Sociedad after the break, three late goals from Diego Costa, Miranda and Diego Ribas propelled the hosts into top spot. Coach Diego Simeone, however, continued to deflect attention from Los Rojiblancos' chances of going all the way in the title race, preferring to concentrate instead on his side's meeting with Real Madrid in the Copa del Rey on Wednesday. ""The objective is clear: the next game. Now we have the Copa del Rey on Wednesday. ""We need to recover and see how far we can go.

180,03/01/2014,02:15,"Football: Barca, Atletico jostle for position, Basque derby on cards","After a short winter break, Spain's top-flight clubs are back in action this weekend with Barcelona and Atletico Madrid jostling for position at the top of the table and a Basque derby also on the cards.","Reigning champions Barcelona and Diego Simeone's Atletico are level on points at the top and are due to face each other in a mouthwatering fixture in Madrid next weekend. Prior to that, though, Atletico go to Malaga on Saturday and Barcelona entertain Elche on Sunday before both sides have Copa del Rey ties to think about in midweek. Atletico, who have signed Argentine midfielder Jose Ernesto Sosa on loan from Metalist Kharkiv until the end of the season, will face a Malaga side who won their last two league games of 2013 to climb up into mid-table. Brazilian full-back Filipe Luis insists that the Rojiblancos are fully focused on their trip to La Rosaleda as they look to keep the pressure on Barcelona. ""Knowing the coach and the squad, nobody is thinking about the Barcelona game. Maybe the supporters are, but we all know that the Malaga match is vital,"" he said. ""We have not won there in two or three years and it is a difficult venue for us."" Both Atletico and Barca have enjoyed stunning starts to the campaign, winning 15 and drawing one of 17 games in La Liga, but the Catalans have not always performed convincingly since Gerardo Martino took over as coach in the summer. Nevertheless, the champions have been boosted by the return to the squad of goalkeeper Victor Valdes after injury, while Lionel Messi is also edging closer to a comeback. Barca midfielder Andres Iniesta is hoping a win against Elche - who sit just two points above the drop zone - can set his team up for a successful 2014. ""A good new year for us means winning everything"" said the man who scored Spain's World Cup-winning goal in 2010. ""When you have the chance to reach the top, you have to fight hard, and that's the kind of ambition that we hope will take us into April and May in contention. The team is playing well, and we need to grow from here."" Real Madrid, who sit third in the table, five points adrift of the top two, are in action on the Monday Three Kings Day holiday with a home fixture against Celta Vigo at the Santiago Bernabeu. The extra time to prepare for that game was used up playing in a glamour friendly against Paris Saint-Germain in Qatar on Thursday, which Carlo Ancelotti's team won 1-0 thanks to a first-half goal from young striker Jese. ""We are coming from behind but we have the whole second half of the season to come back and win the league,"" Ancelotti said. The first weekend of the New Year features the enticing prospect of a Basque derby between fifth-placed Real Sociedad and Athletic Bilbao at Anoeta. Athletic sit four points clear of their neighbours in the final Champions League qualifying position and have lost just one of their last 10 Liga games. Meanwhile, la Real, who finished fourth last season, have doubts over several players for the game, including the influential Xabi Prieto. That is not the only derby on the cards, with Valencia entertaining city rivals Levante at the Mestalla in what will be their first game since the appointment of Argentine-born former Barcelona and Spain striker Juan Antonio Pizzi as coach. Pizzi, who led San Lorenzo to the Argentine Torneo Inicial title last month, has replaced the sacked Miroslav Djukic in charge of Los Che, who sit level on points with Levante coming into their first game of 2014.

""He is developing well,"" Martino told a press conference on Saturday. ""It is just a precaution. We are optimistic, but it is just three days since the injury occurred and it would be risky to play him, especially so early in the season."" Messi's absence should mean a start for Cesc Fabregas in the false nine role he often occupies for Spain. However, Martino was tight-lipped on whether or not Neymar would be handed his first start for the club after coming off the bench to net his first Barca goal on Wednesday. ""Just because Messi isn't there doesn't mean Neymar has to take the reigns,"" said the coach. ""Neymar is improving all the time, but we need to take things bit by bit to ensure everything goes well in the end. My intention is that when he plays he is able to show all that he can do."" Real Madrid meanwhile aren't in action until Monday night when they travel to face Granada. However, it is looking increasingly unlikely that they will travel to Andalusia with Bale amongst their ranks as there was still no confirmation of his move from Spurs on Saturday. Spanish media reported that the 24-year-old had already arrived in Spain and is waiting in Marbella for the world record deal to be completed before flying to Madrid to be presented to the fans and the media in the coming days. Real will be without Xabi Alonso for up to three months after he broke a bone in his foot earlier this week and minor injuries to Sami Khedira and Asier Illarramendi mean manager Carlo Ancelotti's midfield options are limited. Meanwhile the Italian also has to decide whether to stick with Diego Lopez in goal or recall club captain Iker Casillas after he was surprisingly benched for Real's 2-1 win over Real Betis last weekend. In the night's action on the field, Real Sociedad failed to make it three wins in a week as they were held 1-1 by promoted Elche. The Basques took a huge step towards qualifying for the Champions League group stages for the first time in a decade in midweek as they won 2-0 away to Lyon. However, they were on the back foot straight away in Alicante as Ferran Coro scored the hosts first goal in the top-flight for 24 years. Sociedad improved mightily after the break though and were deservedly level 16 minutes from time when Carlos Vela turned home Xabi Prieto's cross. Espanyol moved alongside Sociedad on four points after two games as they came from behind to beat Valencia 3-1. Helder Postiga scored his first goal for Valencia against the run of play after just 10 minutes. However, David Lopez's equaliser ensured Javi Aguirre's men went in level at half-time and second-half goals from Cristian Stuani and Thievy Bifouma rounded off a fine victory for the Catalans."

183,12/08/2013,02:30,"Football: Gap widens as Barca, Real spend and rest sell","Looking at the Spanish sports pages over the typically baking summer months, it would appear the Spanish game was in rude health both on and off the pitch.","In Catalonia, Neymar has dominated attention after his 57 million euro ($74 million, £48.7 million) move from Santos to Barcelona was confirmed in June, whilst, in the capital, Real Madrid backed up their 69 million euro investment in the young Spanish duo of Isco and Asier Illarramendi with an on-going pursuit of the 100 million euro rated Gareth Bale in a saga that looks set to run well into the final days of the transfer window. But beneath the big two, the game in Spain has continued to reflect the general ailing Spanish economy with even clubs in the Champions League forced to sell their best players. As a result, the already colossal gap between Real and Barca and the rest continues to increase as do fears that by continuing to use an unbalanced TV deal that greatly favours the big two, La Liga descends further into a turgid two-horse race. However, whilst both Barca and Real have been active in the transfer market, there are concerns that both have so far failed to bring in the type of players they really needed after falling at the semi-final stage of the Champions League last season. Neymar's arrival should certainly ease the scoring burden that Lionel Messi has carried almost single-handedly for the past two seasons, but the Catalans still look very threadbare at the back with captain Carles Puyol having undergone two operations during the close season and not due back till at least September. Real meanwhile have bolstered an already strong midfield, but haven't so far replaced Gonzalo Higuain after he joined Napoli last month leaving only Karim Benzema and youngster Alvaro Morata to fill the lone striker's position. There is though already a great deal more calm around Los Blancos following the departure of Jose Mourinho with the management team of Carlo Ancelotti and Zinedine Zidane highly-respected by the squad and the players themselves coming together as a unit following the public clashes and fallouts that marked the Portuguese's final season at the Bernabeu. That greater unity should mean Real push Barca a great deal closer than they did last season, but the title will again be defined by small margins. Such is their dominance that firstly Real and then Barca amassed 100 points in winning the title in the past two seasons and with the gap only set to widen between them and the rest, it is highly likely whoever becomes champions will need to register a century of points once more. In the battle for Champions League places, Atletico Madrid seem the best set despite losing star man Radamel Falcao to Monaco. Atletico have arguably done the best business in terms of value for money as they replaced the 60 million euro Colombian with David Villa for an inital fee of just 2.1 million euros. Continuing an uncharacteristic period of stability since Diego Simeone took charge of the club in December 2011, Atletico are only the only club to finish in the top six last season that haven't changed manager over the close season and they are heavy favourites to be the best of the rest once more. Further down, Valencia, Sevilla, Real Betis and Real Sociedad are all likely to be in the mix for the European places despite all losing key players in recent months. Valencia have replaced new Spurs signing Roberto Soldado with a former Spurs player, Helder Postiga, for a tenth of the price they sold Soldado, whilst Sevilla have also seen two Spanish internationals depart as Jesus Navas and Alvaro Negredo have joined Manchester City. However, they will still most likely battle it out for the final Champions League place as last season's surprise package Sociedad haven't invested heavily in their squad despite the 39 million euro windfall they received from Illarramendi's departure. Betis have lost their key creative lynchpin in Benat Extebarria after he rejoined Athletic Bilbao and the Basques themselves will be hoping for a far more successful campaign than their 12th-placed finish last season following the appointment of the highly-rated Ernesto Valverde as manager."
184,10/08/2013,20:56,Football: Soldado finds target on Spurs debut,Spain striker Roberto Soldado claimed a debut goal as Tottenham Hotspur completed their pre-season preparations with a 1-1 draw against Spanish side Espanyol at White Hart Lane on Saturday.,"Welsh winger Gareth Bale, strongly linked with Real Madrid, was absent from the Tottenham squad with a foot injury, but manager Andre Villas-Boas was able to hand debuts to both Soldado and Brazil midfielder Paulinho. After narrowly missing out on Champions League qualification last season, Spurs have spent an estimated £50 million ($77.5 million, 58.1 million euros) to improve their squad during the close season, including a club-record £26 million to prise Soldado from Valencia. Soldado told ITV: ""Of course, it's always what a striker wants to do, score goals, and hopefully this is the first of many more to come."" Paulinho, a £17 million capture from world champions Corinthians, thought he had made a perfect start to his debut, but his sixth-minute header from Gylfi Sigurdsson's free-kick was ruled out for a marginal offside. Soldado threatened with a flicked header, before opening his Spurs account from the penalty spot in the 29th minute after left-back Danny Rose had been sent flying by Javi Lopez. The home side could not hold out until half-time, however, as the unmarked David Lopez headed in a near-post equaliser from Pizzi's right-wing corner in the 44th minute. Both teams made multiple substitutions in the second period, before Diego Colotto came close to giving the visitors the lead when he headed over from a Juan Fuentes corner. Spurs' best chance fell to midfielder Andros Townsend, so impressive on loan at Queens Park Rangers last season, but after cutting in from the right, his left-foot shot curled narrowly wide of the far post. Tottenham open their Premier League campaign at promoted London rivals Crystal Palace on August 18, while Espanyol's Liga season begins with a trip to Celta Vigo the following day."
