0,17/01/2021,23:44,Metz end Lyon's run as PSG take Ligue 1 lead,Lyon slumped to a shock 1-0 home defeat to Metz on Sunday that ended a long unbeaten run and allowed Paris Saint-Germain to stay top of Ligue 1.,"Rudi Garcia's side had come into Sunday's late match on the back of 16 league games without defeat, knowing that a win would have put them back in the lead of France's top flight. However Aaron Leya Iseka struck in the final minute to snatch the points for resilient Metz, who had to withstand a second-half onslaught before finally prevailing and moving ninth. ""We pushed, they pushed, and we were rewarded for our efforts. We knew that we would have little of the ball and that we would have to counter well, and that's what we did,"" said Belgian Leya Iseka. The loss leaves Lyon third, two points behind PSG and Lille, whose own late goal from Jonathan David secured a 2-1 win over Reims. Lyon should have taken the lead six minutes before the break when Karl Toko Ekambi was fed by Tintotenda Kadewere on a breakaway attack. Cameroonian Ekambi, who had forced a good save from Alexandre Oukidja three minutes earlier, successfully cut inside to fashion himself a shooting opportunity but could only blast over. Three minutes later Metz twice came close to taking a shock lead, first hitting the post following a Farid Boulaya cross before Marcelo charged back to block Lamine Gueye's shot on the line. With 16 minutes remaining Ekambi slammed home what he thought was the opener when the ball fell to him after fine play between Memphis Depay and Thiago Mendes. However after a long VAR review the goal was ruled out for Houssem Aouar straying offside when Mendes shot and then pressuring Metz defender Fabien Centonze, who had nodded the ball out to Ekambi. Islam Slimani had the perfect chance to win the match with seven minutes left of his Lyon debut but he shanked his shot, and Oukidja then did brilliant to keep out Aouar's close range effort after fine work from Memphis Depay. That allowed Leya Iseka to claim a shock win for Metz. Earlier David pounced in the first minute of stoppage for Lille to tap home after Xeka's powerful low drive was spilled by Reims goalkeeper Predrag Rajkovic to put Lille on 42 points, equal with champions PSG. Jonathan Bamba's long-range leveller two minutes after the break gave Lille a chance to snatch the win after Arber Zeneli had given Reims a 35th-minute lead with a cross that bamboozled home stopper Mike Maignan. Monaco are six points off the lead in fourth after Wissam Ben Yedder's brace gave them a 3-2 win over Montpellier on Friday. The Principality club are level on 36 points with fifth-placed Rennes, who earlier on Sunday fought back from going a goal down after just three minutes at Brest to win 2-1. Saint-Etienne are just four points above the relegation zone after a 1-0 defeat at Strasbourg. The 10-time French champions are 16th and winless in five league matches thanks in part to a missed 10th-minute penalty from Ryad Boudebouz. Ludovic Ajorque scored the winner for the team from Alsace just before the half-hour mark. Nantes are hovering above the drop zone after drawing 1-1 at home with Lens, with Gael Kakuta's 81st-minute leveller for the away side denying Raymond Domenech a first win in charge of the hosts. The former France coach has guided Nantes to three straight draws since his much-derided appointment last month, with his team battling a run of games without a win that stretches back to early November. Bordeaux strolled to a thumping 3-0 win at Nice, who are also without a win in five."
1,20/12/2020,23:18,Lille reclaim top spot with PSG stalemate,Lille moved back top of Ligue 1 on Sunday after holding Paris Saint-Germain to an uninspiring goalless draw which failed to live up to its pre-match billing.,"Lille take first place in the French top flight from Lyon on goal difference after a match which saw just a handful of shots on target and very little in the way of incident. PSG are a point back in third after failing to create anything from their territorial dominance, shorn of attacking inspiration without Neymar and Mauro Icardi, among others, while Kylian Mbappe started on the bench as he reportedly struggles with a thigh knock. Marseille meanwhile are five points behind the leaders after their 1-1 draw with Reims on Saturday, although Andre Villas-Boas' side do have two games in hand on their title rivals. PSG were the stronger side in a dismal first half which didn't see a shot on target until Moise Kean's weak flicked header was easy collected by Mike Maignan in the 42nd minute. Lille, who on Friday were sold to Callisto, a subsidiary of the Merlyn Partners investment fund, struggled to get a foothold in the biggest match of their league campaign so far. PSG's dominance continued in the second period but they were lacking their usual creative spark, and the highlight of the latter stages was Presnel Kimpembe's superb tackle on Burak Yilmaz with Lille charging towards goal on the break. Kimpembe appeared to injure a hamstring as he charged across to make the goal-saving tackle with 12 minutes remaining, and limped off soon afterwards. Mbappe had been brought on a minute before Kimpembe's challenge but did very little in the time afforded him, and the curtain was soon brought down on a forgettable encounter between two tired-looking teams. Germany striker Kevin Volland scored his sixth Ligue 1 goal as Monaco battled to a 1-0 win at bottom club Dijon to snap a three-match losing streak. Their win moved the seventh-placed principality club within seven points of Lille and Lyon. Former Bayer Leverkusen forward Volland slotted in the only goal on 15 minutes, with both sides seeing later efforts ruled out by VAR. ""After four straight wins and then three defeats on the bounce, the most important thing was to win,"" said coach Niko Kovac. ""It was not the best Monaco but we showed lots of character and that's the best way to move forward."" Rennes are two points ahead of Monaco in fifth after strolling to a 3-0 win at Lorient, who sit second-from-bottom after their 11th defeat of the season. Damien Da Silva opened the scoring with a deflected close-range effort midway through the first half, and Benjamin Bourigeaud doubled the away side's lead with a fine first-time strike with 20 minutes remaining. Martin Terrier completed the scoring six minutes later when he cut in from the left before curling home past Paul Nardi. Rennes are level with Marseille on 28 points, five behind Lille. One point ahead of Lorient in 18th place are Nimes, who came away from Saint-Etienne with a 2-2 draw. Elsewhere, Montpellier missed the chance to move into fourth as they were held to a 2-2 draw at Brest."
2,18/12/2020,03:25,PSG wait on Neymar return ahead of Lille showdown,"Paris Saint-Germain are hoping to have Neymar back in time for their top-of-the-table clash at Lille on Sunday, as the Brazil superstar looks to have recovered quicker than expected from what looked like a bad ankle injury.","Coach Thomas Tuchel said ""for Neymar we will do everything"" after Wednesday's 2-0 win over struggling Lorient, which put the champions second and keeps them just a point behind Ligue 1 leaders Lille. Neymar had already revealed the injury, which came after a rough Thiago Mendes tackle during last weekend's 1-0 home loss to Lyon, was not as bad as initially thought. However such a speedy return still seemed unlikely until Tuchel revealed he could yet feature at the Stade Pierre Mauroy. ""I can't say 'No, he's not playing against Lille'. It is possible. We can try, we will try everything,"" Tuchel said. His return would be a huge boost to PSG's morale after a strife-ridden opening few months of the season which has led to speculation over Tuchel's future. A win on Sunday would put the capital city side back on top of the pile after they moved above Lyon in the midweek round of fixtures, with a five-match winning-streak for Rudi Garcia's side coming to an end with a dramatic 2-2 draw with Brest. PSG's other major title rivals Marseille host Reims on Saturday as they lurk five points back but with a game in hand. Fourth-placed Marseille go into the weekend having lost ground in the title race following a 2-1 defeat at Rennes, who have won two on the bounce after a miserable run in which they lost seven of their previous eight in all competitions. There appears to be some tension in the Marseille camp after coach Andre Villas-Boas launched an attack on a journalist at French newspaper La Provence. According to witnesses the Portuguese boss targeted the reporter with threats of ""I'll get you"" and criticised their work during the post-match press conference. The row, apparently over an article which slammed Villas-Boas' career record in the Champions League following their dismal effort in this year's competition, then carried on outside Rennes' Roazhon Park as the reporter and coach faced each other down. Lille, meanwhile, seem confident they can maintain their slight hold on the summit and make this a true title race in a league now used to PSG dominance. The northern outfit seem to be unworried by a potential change in ownership, with president Gerard Lopez saying he would ""completely withdraw"" from the club if a bid from a Luxembourg investment fund is accepted. ""Both teams are tired, Paris might have more quality but in one game everything is there to play for,"" said coach Christophe Galtier. Turkey's Yazici continued his impressive recent form on Wednesday when he scored the opening goal in Lille's 2-0 win at Dijon. The 23-year-old showed the composure that has seen him score five times in just three Ligue 1 starts, and six in as many Europa League appearances, when he slotted home Zeki Celik's cutback in the 19th minute. Yazici signed for Lille in the summer of 2019 but this has become the attacker's breakout season, his two hat-tricks at Sparta Prague and AC Milan helping his side reach the Europa League last 32, where they will face four-time European champions Ajax. 5 - goals that Yusuf Yazici has scored this Ligue 1 season 12 - the number of games Lyon have played since last losing 4 - PSG have already lost to Lens, Marseille, Monaco and Lyon so far this season"
3,29/11/2020,23:54,Lille held as Ligue 1 top five separated by two points,"Lille stuttered to a 1-1 draw at struggling Saint-Etienne on Sunday to miss the chance to draw level on points with Paris Saint-Germain at the top of Ligue 1, but the rest of the chasers took advantage of the defending champions' latest slip-up.","Lille sit second in the table, two points behind PSG -- who drew 2-2 with Bordeaux on Saturday -- and above Lyon, Monaco and Montpellier on goal difference. Lyon continued their fine form with a 3-0 win over Reims, while Monaco beat Nimes by the same scoreline to also move within two points of PSG, while Montpellier edged out Lorient. Lille would have hoped to take all three points from a Saint-Etienne side on a seven-match losing streak in the league before kick-off. But Christophe Galtier's team fell behind to a controversial first-half penalty from Tunisian Wahbi Khazri and needed a second-half strike from Jonathan Ikone to rescue a draw. Galtier was left frustrated by the decision to award Khazri the spot-kick, after the former Sunderland winger appeared to fall over Domagoj Bradaric in a vain attempt to reach the ball before Lille goalkeeper Mike Maignan. ""The penalty was a clear refereeing error,"" he said. ""Wahbi Khazri comes with a lot of experience onto my player Domagoj Bradaric. ""With video and professional referees this shouldn't happen. It doesn't take away from our bad first half, but it was an important moment of the game."" Karl Toko Ekambi, Bruno Guimaraes and Moussa Dembele scored for Lyon as they made it 16 points from their last six matches. ""We must continue in this vein and look upwards. We must put a run of victories together,"" said Lyon coach Rudi Garcia. ""This is the first time that we have won three times in a row. As in Angers (last week), we had an opportunity to (move up the) table. We seized it."" PSG gave the chasing pack a chance to cut the gap with a 2-2 home draw against Bordeaux on Saturday, having blown a two-goal lead to lose to Monaco last week. Reims, who had Moreto Cassama sent off on 33 minutes, remain fourth from bottom and look destined for a relegation dog-fight. Monaco eased to victory over Nimes to notch their fourth straight league win. Young midfielder Sofiane Diop gave the hosts an early lead at the Stade Louis II, before Gelson Martins and Kevin Volland struck in the second half to see off Nimes, who had Lucas Deaux dismissed in the 69th minute. Germany striker Volland has scored five Ligue 1 goals for Monaco since his close-season move from Bayer Leverkusen. The principality outfit have finished ninth and 17th in the last two seasons and coach Niko Kovac was eager to play down any thoughts of a repeat of their shock 2017 title triumph. ""The title? Not after 12 games, we're not there, no,"" said the Croatian. ""It's a good period for us, we have to keep working, we are a young team. We will also lose matches."" Fifth-placed Montpellier also extended their winning streak to four matches as Petar Skuletic scored late on to grab a 1-0 win at Lorient, despite midfielder Teji Savanier's missed penalty in the first half. Marseille, who have also won four league matches on the spin, are only four points behind PSG in sixth, with two games in hand."
4,23/11/2020,16:30,Evergreen Ibra out for 10 days with thigh injury: source,Zlatan Ibrahimovic will miss AC Milan's Europa League clash at Lille after a source at the Italian club told AFP that the in-form veteran will be out for at least 10 days with a thigh injury.,"Ibrahimovic, 39, kept Milan top of Serie A with a brace in a 3-1 win at Napoli on Sunday but left the field shortly before the end of play at the Stadio San Paolo with a left thigh knock. The source told AFP that tests on Monday morning revealed damage to the hamstring muscle in Ibrahimovic's left thigh, and that the Serie A top scorer would undergo new tests in 10 days' time. As well as missing Thursday's Group H match at Lille, the former Inter Milan, Juventus, Barcelona and Paris Saint-Germain forward will also be unavailable for Milan's next league match with Fiorentina and the visit of Celtic early next month. The Swede's absence is a big blow to Milan coach Stefano Pioli, whose team have been galvanised by their ageing frontman since his return to the seven-time European champions in January. Milan are top of Serie A and unbeaten in domestic competition so far this season, with Ibrahimovic scoring 10 of their 19 league goals. The 'Rossoneri' are also second in Group H heading into Thursday's match, one point behind Lille who are the only team to have beaten Milan this campaign after romping to a 3-0 win at the San Siro before the international break."
5,01/11/2020,23:56,Unbeaten Lille held by stubborn 10-man Lyon,Lille lost ground on Ligue 1 leaders Paris Saint-Germain after a 1-1 draw at home to 10-man Lyon on Sunday but kept their unbeaten record this season intact.,"Jonathan Bamba curled in a fine 20-yard strike to give Lille the lead but Zeki Celik's own goal just before half-time brought Lyon level. The visitors played most of the second half a man down after Brazilian defender Marcelo was shown a second yellow card for a foul on Bamba but Lille could not take advantage. ""The first yellow was very harsh,"" said Lyon coach Rudi Garcia. ""Quite frankly, it killed the match. I would like to have seen 95 minutes against Lille with 11 against 11. I'm not going to say what I think... I'm very annoyed because it became difficult afterwards."" Lille stayed second but fell two points back of PSG while Lyon moved up to sixth after a fifth draw in nine outings this term. Bamba notched his fourth goal of the campaign with a terrific first-time effort after an inviting lay-off from Turkey international Burak Yilmaz. The goal came moments after Mike Maignan stood tall at the other end to deny Karl Toko Ekambi after the Cameroon striker was played clean through. Lyon goalkeeper Anthony Lopes pawed away a long-range shot from Yilmaz and Bamba then fizzed just over, but OL equalised when Houssem Aouar's drive smacked Celik in the chest and flew past Maignan. The dismissal of Marcelo five minutes into the second half prompted Garcia to withdraw Aouar for centre-back Djamel Benlamri, the Algerian Africa Cup of Nations winner who joined Lyon last month on a free transfer. Lille were unable to transform their sustained pressure into a winning goal and were held to a second consecutive draw. Earlier, Germany international Kevin Volland scored his first goals for Monaco since signing for the club in September as Niko Kovac's side thrashed Bordeaux 4-0. Monaco struck three times in as many minutes through Wissam Ben Yedder, Gelson Martins and Volland in the first half to take control at the Stade Louis II. Volland then grabbed another in the second half as Monaco won for just the second time in six matches to climb up to eighth place. France forward Ben Yedder crashed home a spot-kick on 27 minutes after his header was handled by Pablo, with a penalty awarded despite the ball looping over Benoit Costil and into the net following the deflection. Martins grabbed his first goal since serving a six-month ban for pushing a referee last season when he lunged at the far post to poke in a Ruben Aguilar cross. And former Bayer Leverkusen forward Volland promptly headed in from a Ben Yedder delivery to end his drought following his 11 million-euro ($13 million) move from Germany. The 28-year-old tapped in a second on 57 minutes as Martins slid the ball across goal for his unmarked team-mate. Nice moved up to fourth as Patrick Vieira's team extended their unbeaten domestic run to five games with a 3-0 victory at Angers. Rony Lopes put Nice ahead on 11 minutes and Pierre Lees-Melou added a second from the spot. Hicham Boudaoui came off the bench to net a third as Nice stayed four points behind PSG. Metz continued their fine recent form with a 1-0 win at Nimes while Montpellier defeated Saint-Etienne by the same scoreline courtesy of a goal from Englishman Stephy Mavididi. Reims beat Strasbourg 2-1 while Dijon remain the only team without a victory following a goalless draw at home to Lorient."
6,19/10/2020,00:01,Lille thrash nine-man Lens to go top of Ligue 1,Lille grabbed top spot in Ligue 1 on Sunday by thrashing newly-promoted Lens 4-0 in France's northern derby as the ill-disciplined visitors had two players sent off.,"Lens had a chance to go top in France for the first time in 16 years but their defensive frailties were ruthlessly exposed by Lille who move two points ahead of defending champions Paris Saint-Germain. Burak Yilmaz's low shot put the home side ahead in the echoing, empty Stade Metropole after 11 minutes. Lens hung on till the second half when Jonathan Bamba scored Lille's second before first Jonathan Gradit and then substitute Clement Michelin were shown red cards as Lens fell apart. Jonathan Ikone and Yusuf Yazici completed the job for Lille. ""Tonight was a perfect match,"" said Lille striker Luiz Araujo. ""This start to the season is the result of the hard work we do every day. We are very serious and ready to do a great job but we haven't won anything yet. ""We have to keep our feet on the ground and stay focused on the next game."" PSG had also won 4-0 on Friday with Kylian Mbappe scoring twice at Nimes. Lyon coach Rudi Garcia said his team had ""turned the page"" after captain Memphis Depay set up three goals in Sunday's 3-2 win at Strasbourg to claim their first victory since August. The Dutch attacker, who was linked with a move to Barcelona during the transfer window, was the provider for Zimbabwe international forward Tino Kadewere and repeated the feat twice for Karl Toko Ekambi in the first half. Habib Diallo and Jean-Eudes Aholou scored for the hosts but Lyon hung on and move up to ninth with their first three points since August. ""The win was more than deserved. This team had the capacity to admit they had to turn the page,"" Garcia said. ""The answer was on the pitch, three Depay assists and three goals in open play."" Kadewere opened the scoring after 15 minutes, firing home first time from Depay's long ball. Depay then combined twice with Toko Ekambi before the 42-minute mark to make it 3-0. The hosts fought back as Senegal's Diallo cut the deficit just over a minute later. Ivory Coast midfielder Aholou, on loan from Monaco, scored with a left-footed volley 10 minutes into the second half. Patrick Vieira's Nice side eased to a 3-1 win at Saint-Etienne to move up to fourth, joining Lens on 13 points. Pierre Lees-Malou opened the scoring for Nice before 20-year-old Amine Gouiri added a second before half-time. Adil Aouchiche pulled a goal back for Saint-Etienne on 57 minutes but Myziane Maolida sealed the points for the southerners. On Saturday, Marseille warmed up for their return to the Champions League next week with a 3-1 victory over Bordeaux."
7,04/08/2020,12:05,Osimhen's Napoli transfer will lift Nigeria - Amuneke,Former Barcelona winger Emmanuel Amuneke has said the record-breaking transfer of Victor Osimhen from Lille to Napoli will inspire more top transfers to the benefit of Nigeria.,"Osimhen, 21, has joined Napoli on a five-year contract with an option for another year in a deal worth up to 80 million euros ($94.4 million), making him the most expensive African player ever. Amuneke selected Osimhen for the 2015 Under-17 FIFA World Cup in Chile where he finished record top scorer with 10 goals to attract interest from several top European clubs before he eventually signed for Bundesliga club Wolfsburg. The former Barcelona winger says he believes the Super Eagles will compete more favourably when other players also step up to the big clubs in Europe. ""His transfer is good for Nigeria and I hope other players make it to the big stage, that will be how we can aspire to win something,"" said Amuneke, the hero when Nigeria won a historic Olympic gold in 1996 and who scored twice in the 1994 Africa Cup of Nations final. ""For Nigeria to achieve anything meaningful, we need a strong team, which is not just about two or three players. ""We need top players in all departments as well as those on the bench. That way at any given time anyone can play."" Amuneke said Osimhen represents a bright future for three-time African champions Nigeria, whose last major achievement was winning the 2013 Africa Cup of Nations. ""He is now the future of Nigeria at only 21, he has a great attitude,"" he said. ""We already have a young team with the likes of Wilfred Ndidi, Kelechi Nwakali, Samuel Chukwueze and Orji Okwonkwo and Osimhen is very much part of this team."" Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari was among several personalities who have congratulated Osimhen on his transfer to Napoli."
8,01/08/2020,14:08,Lille sign veteran Turkish striker Yilmaz,"Lille have signed Turkish striker Burak Yilmaz from Besiktas on a free transfer, one day after selling Victor Osimhen to Napoli, the Ligue 1 club announced on Saturday.","The 35-year-old Yilmaz has spent most of his career in Turkey and is one of a select few to have played for Fenerbahce, Besiktas and Galatasaray. ""The experienced and prolific striker and Turkish football idol has signed a two-season contract with the Lille club,"" Lille said in a statement. Yilmaz has scored 24 goals in 59 international matches for Turkey and netted 13 times in 25 league games for Besiktas last season. ""I want to write a new chapter with Lille. I don't want to disappoint myself or Lille who trust me,"" he said. Lille sold Nigerian forward Osimhen to Napoli on Friday for a fee which could rise to 80 million euros ($94.6 million), while former France striker Loic Remy also left the club at the end of his contract. The club were fourth in Ligue 1 when the 2019-20 season was halted with 10 games remaining due to the coronavirus pandemic, missing out on a Champions League place to Rennes by one point. bur-av/chc/jc/dmc <org>BESIKTAS FUTBOL</org> <org></org>"
9,31/07/2020,18:23,Nigeria's Osimhen joins Napoli for up to 80 million euros,Victor Osimhen has signed for Napoli after the Serie A side splashed out a club record fee of up to 80 million euros ($94.6 million) to sign the Nigeria forward from French outfit Lille.,"A source from Lille who was familiar with the transfer had told AFP that the Ligue 1 team would receive 70 million euros with add-ons potentially worth 10 million euros. That figure was then confirmed by Napoli president Aurelio De Laurentiis to the Gazzetta dello Sport, who also report the movie mogul as saying that Osimhen had signed a five-year deal with the Italian club. ""It's 70 million euros to be paid over five years and 10 million euros of bonuses according to certain results,"" the Gazzetta reported De Laurentiis as saying. ""His contract will begin at four million euros a year and will progressively increase to 4.5 million euros by the end of the contract."" The total fee would make Osimhen, 21, one of the most expensive players in Serie A history, and is almost double Napoli's previous club record of around 40 million euros paid for Gonzalo Higuain in 2013 and Hirving Lozano last year. His move to Napoli had been widely reported for weeks, but De Laurentiis told Gazzetta that the transfer had been held up by Osimhen firing his two agents and hiring a new one. Osimhen scored 18 times last season and was one of the revelations of France's curtailed campaign with 13 Ligue 1 goals as Lille finished fourth. The transfer will see Lille again make a huge profit for a player after taking £72 million off Premier League team Arsenal for Nicolas Pepe, with Osimhen arriving at the club in northern France for 12 million euros from Belgian club Charleroi last summer. Napoli go into their final match of the season against Lazio knowing they will finish seventh in Serie A. They have qualified for the group stage of the Europa League by virtue of winning the Italian Cup."
10,18/07/2020,21:50,Lille coach says three players have tested positive for COVID,"Lille midfielders Renato Sanches, Jonathan Ikone and Jonathan Bamba have tested positive for COVID-19, coach Christophe Galtier said on Saturday, calling for more firmness in enforcing social distancing.","All three tested positive last Monday, Galtier said after a 2-1 friendly win at Belgian first-division club Mouscron. He said Sanches, a Euro 2016 winner, had returned to Portugal during a week off and there shown symptoms and tested positive. ""Renato is still in Portugal and he cannot travel yet because he has to pass two negative tests,"" Galtier said. He said Ikone, a French international, and Bamba, a France under-21 player, had been confined to their homes but ""should come back to training on Monday"". Galtier urged the French to follow the rules on social distancing. ""I've had eight days off and I've seen how we behave,"" he said. ""Let's continue like this and we'll all be reconfined and it'll be a mess. It's up to the state to be firm. ""If we continue like this, we won't be able to avoid a second wave."""

The 33-year-old Remy scored 14 goals in 30 appearances for Lille this season before the campaign was ended early due to the coronavirus pandemic in April. Remy has won 31 caps for France and played for 11 different clubs across spells in France, England and Spain. He will link up with World Cup winner Filippo Inzaghi at Benevento after the former Italy striker guided the club to promotion in his first season in charge."
12,29/06/2020,14:24,Lille's Osimhen collects top Ligue 1 African honour,Lille's Nigerian striker Victor Osimhen was on Monday named the top African player in France's coronavirus-curtailed Ligue 1 season.,"At 21 the Lagos-born forward is the youngest ever recipient of the Prix Marc Vivien-Foe, named in honour of the late Cameroon player who died aged 28 in 2003. With 13 goals in the 2019-20 campaign Osimhen beat off opposition led by Monaco's Islam Slimani of Algeria and Moroccan Yunis Abdelhamid who plays for Reims. Osimhen succeeds Nicolas Pepe, who moved from Lille to Arsenal last summer. Like Pepe, the sought-after Osimhen is expected to be lured to a new club next season. ""I have planned for some time that Victor will no longer be here next season,"" conceded Lille coach Christophe Galtier this month. Osimhen has not resumed training with his current side as he is in Nigeria following the death of his father. He was voted top African in Ligue 1 by a panel of 100 journalists, announced the award's organisers RFI radio and France 24. Lille finished fourth in the 2019/2020 campaign which in contrast to other major European leagues was ended in April due to the COVID-19 pandemic."
13,17/02/2020,13:53,African players in Europe: Mane moves Liverpool closer to title,Reigning African Footballer of the Year Sadio Mane scored the goal that brought Liverpool victory at Norwich and moved the Reds closer to a first English league title in 30 years.,"The 27-year-old Senegalese came off the bench to strike on 78 minutes and break the resistance of the gallant home side in the lively top-versus-bottom clash. Gabonese Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Ivorian Nicolas Pepe of Arsenal were other African scorers in the Premier League at the weekend. PIERRE-EMERICK AUBAMEYANG/NICOLAS PEPE (Arsenal) Pepe teed up Aubameyang for his 17th goal of the season with a towering header to open the floodgates in Arsenal's 4-0 win over Newcastle. The Ivorian then found the net himself with a trademark left-foot finish and set up another goal late on for Alexandre Lacazette as the Gunners returned to winning ways after four straight draws. SADIO MANE (Liverpool) Mane scored the only goal in Liverpool's 1-0 win at Norwich to continue their relentless run towards the Premier League title. He was making his comeback from a hamstring injury, but showed no signs of rustiness by controlling Jordan Henderson's through ball with his right foot then firing home with his left. JOSEPH AIDOO (Celta Vigo) Ghanaian Aidoo found himself lined up against a stellar cast of strikers as he played on the right side of Celta Vigo's back three at Real Madrid. Real recalled Eden Hazard and Gareth Bale but Aidoo and the defence conceded only two goals to earn a draw in Madrid and keep just above the relegation zone. Aidoo came within a finger nail of making an even bigger splash. In the final minute of the first half he outjumped the Real defence at a corner and smashed a header toward the far corner of the goal, only to be denied by a world-class save from Thibaut Courtois. GERVINHO (Parma) Ivorian forward Gervinho returned for Europa League hopefuls Parma, tapping in on 25 minutes in a 1-0 victory over Sassuolo, for his fifth goal this season. The 32-year-old had been exiled from the first team and dropped for four games after trying to force a move to Al Sadd, the Qatari club coached by former Barcelona star Xavi. ACHRAF HAKIMI (Borussia Dortmund) The Morocco wing-back again proved why he is one of Dortmund's most potent forces going forward with two assists in a 4-0 drubbing of Eintracht Frankfurt. The 21-year-old, on loan from Real Madrid, spotted captain Lukasz Piszczek free on the edge of the area to give Dortmund a first-half lead. Hakimi then claimed his ninth league assist this season just after the break, getting in behind the defence to square for Norwegian teenager Erling Braut Haaland to score his ninth goal in six games. JAMILU COLLINS (Paderborn) The Nigeria defender failed to stop bottom side Paderborn losing 2-1 at home to Hertha Berlin after deflecting a shot by Brazilian striker Matheus Cunha into the net. At 1-1 in the second half, Collins was on the goalline when Cunha hit a shot with the side of his foot, which cannoned off the defender. VICTOR OSIMHEN (LILLE) Nigerian international Osimhen gave Lille a 51st-minute lead against second-placed Marseille, pouncing onto Jonathan Bamba's pass to beat goalkeeper Steve Mandanda for his 13th goal of the season, the same number as PSG's Brazilian superstar Neymar. However, their Champions League rivals hit back with two goals in two second-half minutes to earn the three points."
14,26/01/2020,22:40,Neymar dedicates PSG goal to Kobe Bryant,"Neymar dedicated his second goal in Paris Saint-Germain's 2-0 win at Lille to basketball legend Kobe Bryant, whose death in a helicopter crash earlier on Sunday shocked the world, as his double shot the French champions 10 points clear at the top of Ligue 1.","The world's most expensive player slotted home the 52nd-minute penalty and went over to television cameras by the side of the Stade Pierre Mauroy pitch to make the number 24 with his fingers in honour of Bryant's shirt number. ""It's deeply saddening for the world of sport and for all of us,"" said Neymar to Canal+ after the win, which put PSG 10 points clear at the top of the league. ""Not just for basketball fans, but for everything he did for sport."" He had already put his side ahead with a fine strike in the first half before putting the game out of reach and increasing the gap between them and second-placed Marseille. His 12th league goal of the season tipped the balance in the Parisians' favour after a positive start for the home side, who were unbeaten at home ahead of the match. The Brazilian almost immediately slipped through Mbappe but the onrushing Mike Maignan stopped the France World Cup winner from clinching his 14th top-flight effort of the campaign. Mbappe was stopped again by Maignan when he got his body in the way of a fierce close-range effort, but the away side were given a penalty soon after for a clear Gabriel handball just before the forward's shot. Neymar squeezed his spot-kick just beyond Maignan, who got his hand to the shot but looked on in horror as it made its way in off the post. ""We deserved to win, I think we played well,"" said PSG coach Thomas Tuchel. ""We controlled the match and counter-attacks and this is not easy to do against a good team like Lille."" Lille stay seventh after the defeat, two points away from the European places. Neymar's tribute came on what was already an emotional day in French football, with Nantes and Bordeaux also honouring their former striker Emiliano Sala, a year after his death in a plane crash. The clubs remembered Argentine forward Sala before the Derby de l'Atlantique at the Stade de la Beaujoire. Bordeaux won 1-0 courtesy of a late goal by Jimmy Briand as Nantes played most the second half with 10 men after the dismissal of Andrei Girotto. The 28-year-old Sala was killed last January when the small plane taking him to join Cardiff City after being bought from Nantes for £15 million ($19.5 million) crashed off the Channel island of Guernsey. Nantes wore a special white and pale blue shirt inspired by Argentina while Bordeaux's kit featured an Argentine flag beneath the club crest flanked by the player's initials. Proceeds from the sales of the strips will go to the two Argentine clubs Sala played for in his youth. A portrait of Sala was also displayed in the centre circle during the warm-up and there was a minute's applause ahead of kick-off. Supporters laid flowers outside the ground and broke out into a song commemorating Sala in the ninth minute, representing the shirt number worn by the player which has since been retired by Nantes. Sala left his homeland to join Bordeaux in 2012 and then played for Nantes between 2015 and 2019. Earlier Karl Toko Ekambi scored on his Lyon debut Sunday in a 3-0 victory over bottom club Toulouse. Cameroon striker Toko Ekambi, who joined on loan this week from Villarreal until the end of the season, sealed the win six minutes later as Lyon climbed up to fifth in Ligue 1. Toko Ekambi came on as a first-half substitute after a scary incident involving France Under-21 forward Martin Terrier. Terrier was stretchered off after fainting on the pitch, but Lyon said at half-time the player had regained consciousness."
15,09/12/2018,19:39,PSG cruising after Lille held by Reims,Lille missed the chance to close the yawning gap between them and Paris Saint-Germain after needing a penalty in the dying moments to snatch a 1-1 Ligue 1 draw at home to mid-table Reims.,"Nicolas Pepe salvaged a point for the hosts when he slotted home what appeared to be a soft spot-kick five minutes into injury time, leaving Christophe Galtier's side 13 points behind runaway leaders PSG. The equaliser came when Romain Metanire was judged to have tripped Fode Ballo-Toure as he raced into the box, just as the away side thought Remi Oudin's 64th-minute strike would be enough for the three points. PSG were one of a host of French teams to have their matches postponed for security fears ahead of a weekend of fierce protests from ""gilet jaune"" demonstrators. Lille are two points ahead of Montpellier, who were set to take on Thomas Tuchel's champions in Paris on Saturday before the match was moved to next month, while Lyon are a further point back in fourth after their trip to Toulouse was also put back to January. Earlier on Sunday, Strasbourg were stopped from following up a midweek draw with PSG with a win over relegation strugglers Caen when Saif-Eddine Khaoui struck with 10 minutes remaining to grab a precious away point."
16,01/12/2018,23:25,Henry laments Monaco's 'fear of winning' after latest loss,A week that started brightly for Thierry Henry and Monaco ended in disappointment as they let in two late goals to lose 2-1 at home to rising Montpellier in Ligue 1 on Saturday.,"Youri Tielemans gave Monaco the lead in the 42nd minute, but Andy Delort levelled after 81 minutes and Petar Skuletic hit the winner with four minutes left. Monaco remain mired in 19th place in the 20-team division. Last weekend Henry eked out his first victory as Monaco manager at Caen, but on Wednesday his side lost away to Atletico Madrid, a defeat that ensured they will finish last in their Champions League group. Against Montpellier, Monaco had a chance to double their lead in the 54th minute when Tielemans, faced with an open goal, passed to Aleksandr Golovin, who hit the bar. After that the visitors took control ""You've got to shoot into the empty net,"" said Henry after the match. Asked if the match was a disaster, Henry answer: ""Yes!"" ""We talk about the fear of losing, but the fear of winning also exists,"" he said. ""We gave a good performance for 54 minutes....but that's not enough."" The victory lifts Montpellier to second. They are 13 points behind Paris Saint-Germain, who round off the weekend's matches in Bordeaux on Sunday evening, but are just one point ahead of Lyon and two clear of Lille. Those two met on Saturday and drew 2-2. In Lille, the home team raced into a two goal lead with goals by Loic Remy, after 17 minutes, and Nicolas Pepe, after 28 minutes. Lyon, who drew by the same score against Manchester City on Tuesday to remain on course for the last 16 of the Champions League, by Bertrand Traore after 63 minutes and Moussa Dembele with four minutes to play. ""There is automatically a feeling of frustration among the players,"" said Christophe Galtier, the Lille coach. ""In the end, I'm happy with this point."" The Lyon president, Jean-Michel Aulas, also said he was happy with a point in the battle to finish second. ""A draw away against a direct opponent for the European places is a good result,"" Aulas said. ""We saw a good match and a very good Olympique Lyonnais (performance)."""
17,07/11/2018,16:03,Anelka becomes advisor to Lille's apprentice strikers,Former Arsenal and France international Nicolas Anelka has taken a first step towards a potential coaching role after agreeing to advise Lille's up-and-coming strikers.,"Anelka, 39, ""will work at Lille's youth academy advising the apprentices, in particular focusing on the work and specific role of strikers,"" the club said in a statement. Lille president Gerard Lopez told AFP Anelka will ""work with players ranging from 14 years old up to the reserve team"". Described as a future star of the France team when he made his professional debut with Paris Saint-Germain in 1996, Anelka went on to enjoy a globe-trotting career that took him from Arsenal to Mumbai via some of the biggest clubs in Europe including a stint at Real Madrid. After a return to PSG (2000-2002) he went on loan to Liverpool before joining Manchester City (2002-2005), Fenerbahce, Bolton and Chelsea, where he played his last meaningful campaigns in 2008-2012. At the 2010 World Cup in South Africa Anelka's France career came to an abrupt and controversial end. He was handed an 18-match ban by the French Football Federation (FFF) after insults aimed at coach Raymond Domenech sparked the now infamous Knysna players' strike. Anelka ended his playing career in 2015 after 13 games with Mumbai City in the Indian top flight, whom he also briefly coached. Lille coach Christophe Galtier said Anelka, now 39, was happy to cut his coaching teeth ""out of the spotlight"". ""Nicolas is really enthusiastic. He wants to stay out of the spotlight and bring some of his striking expertise and know-how to our young players,"" said Galtier. ""But for the moment he does not want to get involved with the professionals."""
18,02/11/2018,23:47,"Mbappe, Neymar steer PSG to new win record on troubled day",Kylian Mbappe and Neymar scored late goals to give Paris Saint-Germain a 2-1 win over nearest challengers Lille on Friday as the French champions extended to 12 games their perfect start to the season at the end of a troubled day for the club.,"The Qatari-owned club were forced to release a statement shortly before kick-off to deny allegations made by a Football Leaks investigation that they had worked with UEFA to cover up breaches of their Financial Fair Play (FFP) rules. However Mbappe restored smiles at the Parc des Princes with a magnificent strike from just outside the box 20 minutes from time, and Neymar gave PSG a two-goal buffer before Nicolas Pepe pulled one back for the away side from the penalty spot. PSG extend their lead at the top of Ligue 1 to 11 points after a 12th straight league win that means they have now beaten Tottenham Hotspur's old record for consecutive wins at the start of a season. Spurs emerged victorious from their opening 11 matches in their double-winning 1960-61 season, a performance that had stood since as a record in Europe's so-called big five leagues -- Spain, England, Italy, Germany and France. The result is a boost for PSG ahead of their crucial Champions League trip to Italy to face Napoli next Tuesday, when a defeat could leave Thomas Tuchel's side on the brink of an early exit. ""We deserved the result and the win record. Ligue 1 is not that easy. It is down to our hard work. We give everything on the field,"" skipper Thiago Silva told Canal Plus. Mbappe was back in the PSG starting line-up after being left on the bench against Marseille last weekend for arriving late for the pre-game team talk, only to come on and score the opener in a 2-0 win. Marco Verratti also started, despite PSG confirming earlier on Friday that the Italian had been caught drink driving overnight Tuesday to Wednesday on the ring road around the French capital. ""He told me before training on Wednesday. It was on Tuesday night, it is not possible to do that two days before a match. It is not good what he did but it is something for the club to sort out,"" Tuchel said, adding that Verratti was ""lucky"" the incident did not happen closer to the game. PSG needed to put the off-field noise behind them but also try to break down a Lille side enjoying their best start to a season in 66 years. Christophe Galtier's side have been excellent in this campaign, but their lively attack did not give Gianluigi Buffon much to worry about on his return to the PSG line-up. With Edinson Cavani not involved as he struggles to shake off a thigh injury, Mbappe and Neymar were the biggest threats to Lille throughout, after arriving at the stadium disguised as characters from the Netflix show Money Heist. Neymar almost scored direct from a corner five minutes before half-time, with Lille goalkeeper Mike Maignan doing well to get his body in the way of the ball and divert it onto the woodwork. Mbappe had a shot deflected just wide as PSG stepped up the pressure after the break, and it was the 19-year-old who broke the deadlock in the 70th minute, beating Maignan after Neymar's pass was kindly deflected into his path by Jose Fonte. That was his 11th goal in eight Ligue 1 games since winning the World Cup with France, and Neymar then got his ninth in the league this season to seal the win. The Brazilian played a one-two with Mbappe before firing home from 18 yards with six minutes left, before Lille reduced the arrears in stoppage time, Pepe converting a penalty awarded for a Thilo Kehrer handball. Montpellier can leapfrog Lille and go second if they beat Marseille on Sunday."
19,30/09/2018,23:18,Bamba double leads Lille to victory over Marseille,Jonathan Bamba hit a second-half penalty and struck at the death as Lille stunned Marseille 3-0 on Sunday to move up to second place in France's Ligue 1.,"Marseille travelled north hoping to close the 11-point gap to arch-rivals Paris Saint-Germain after the capital club tightened their grip on the lead with a 3-0 win at Nice on Saturday. But Marseille coach Rudi Garcia, who famously led Lille to a rare league and Cup double in 2011, was sent back to the drawing board after a mediocre performance by the southerners left them in sixth place. Lille, in second, are now eight points behind PSG with Montpellier one point further behind in third after a trouble-hit 3-0 win over Nimes earlier on Sunday. Marseille showed little attacking flair in a balanced first half in Lille. And Garcia's men were made to pay for their lack of creativity when Nicolas Pepe got up from a foul just after the hour mark to send 'keeper Steve Mandanda the wrong way from the spot. The hosts doubled their lead on 86 minutes when Bamba, from an almost carbon copy foul, got up to beat Mandanda. Lille completed the win in some style, Fode Ballo-Toure barging Japan defender Hiroki Sakai off the ball to set up Bamba for an easy tap-in from close range in the closing minutes. Earlier, former champions Montpellier risked losing all three points due to unruly fans who forced two stoppages in their 3-0 win over local rivals Nimes. The first 'Languedoc derby' in 25 years had promised plenty of drama, but neither players nor officials were quite ready for the incidents that threatened its cancellation and the points to be awarded to struggling Nimes. Dominant from the outset, Montpellier had taken their lead to 3-0 by the 79th minute thanks to goals from Ambroise Oyongo, Andy Delort, who scored a penalty 10 minutes into first-half stoppage time, and Gaetan Laborde. But virtually claiming all three points wasn't enough for some of the rowdier fans in the crowd who -- following an initial seven-minute interruption when a barrier caved in -- then climbed the barriers to run on to the pitch. French riot police quickly restored order, while Montpellier president Laurent Nicollin intervened in a bid to restore calm. The incidents could lead to sanctions for Montpellier, who are now nine points behind runaway leaders and champions Paris Saint-Germain, who saw Neymar hit a brace Saturday in a 3-0 win at Nice. ""I can understand the fans, but they should also control their behaviour,"" said Montpellier coach Michel Der Zakarian. ""The club will be heavily sanctioned, we will pay fines, and maybe they will close that part of the stadium. ""Everyone will be sanctioned,"" added Der Zakarian, who was quick to praise his players. ""You can't take anything away from the players, we dominated them (Nimes) from start to finish."""

""I want to thank all the coaches who helped me since I was a kid,"" Mavuba said in a message posted on Twitter. Despite earning only 13 caps for France, Mavuba underlined having ""fulfilled one of my biggest dreams, of playing at the World Cup 40 years after (my) Dad, in 2014"". ""My career is ending, but not my life. I hope to see you all soon,"" added Mavuba, who also played for Villarreal in Spain and Sparta Prague, his final professional club."
21,30/08/2018,21:26,New French leave for Bafana Bafana's Lebo Mothiba,"South African international striker Lebo Mothiba has signed up for a second stint of French leave after swapping Lille for Strasbourg, his new club announced Thursday.","The 22-year-old had arrived in the eastern city Wednesday for a medical ahead of inking a three-year contract for a four million euro ($4.4 million) deal which includes a buyback clause valid for two years, a source said. Cash-strapped Lille, who Mothiba helped keep afloat last season in the top flight, notably with a final-day brace against Dijon, would also take half the transfer fee were Strasbourg to move him on during that time, the source told AFP. Mothiba, on the South African Olympic squad in 2016, joined Lille in 2014 from the Diambars academy in Johannesburg and had a successful stint with second tier Valenciennes early last year to earn a place at Lille. His early season form earned him a call-up to Bafana Bafana full squad this month but Lille chairman Gerard Lopez said the club was obliged to trim its squad."
22,20/07/2018,21:31,Euro 2016 winner Fonte joins Lille from Dalian Yifang,Portugal's veteran central defender Jose Fonte has joined French Ligue 1 outfit Lille after a brief spell in China which followed a decade in the English Premier league.,"The 34-year-old, who played 35 times for Portugal, enjoyed six seasons at Southampton, three at Crystal Palace and also had a spell with West Ham. He was on the pitch when Portugal won the Euro 2016 tournament and was also in their World Cup squad this year. ""Lille are happy to announce a deal with Jose Fonte until 2020,"" Lille said on Friday. Lille ended a nightmare 2017-2018 season clinging on to top flight football with a late rally of results after going into the campaign tipped to do well."
23,18/07/2018,12:30,Brighton sign Bissouma from Lille,"Brighton have signed 21-year-old midfielder Yves Bissouma from Lille on a five-year deal, the Premier League club announced.","The Mali international capped 13 times for his country has joined for an undisclosed fee and becomes the club's sixth summer signing. Manager Chris Hughton told the club's website he was looking to strengthen his midfield ahead of the new term and Bissouma ""will add to our options in this area."" Bissouma began his senior career with Malian side AS Real Bamako before joining Lille in 2016. He made 55 appearances and scored four goals for the French club and helped them stay in Ligue 1 last season."
24,13/07/2018,21:15,Former France striker Remy signs for Ligue 1 side Lille,"Former Chelsea forward Loic Remy has returned to his native France by signing a two-year deal with Lille, the Ligue 1 club announced on Friday.","The 31-year-old joined Lille after spending two seasons in Spain with Las Palmas, although he had a spell on loan with Getafe last term. Remy first left France in 2013 when he signed for then-Premier League outfit Queens Park Rangers from Marseille. ""It makes me really happy to come back to France, in a league which I've missed and to sign with Lille, a really big French club,"" he said. Remy has scored seven international goals for France in 31 appearances, but hasn't played for the national side since 2014. He netted 12 times for Chelsea despite mainly only featuring as a substitute, having impressed with 14 Premier League goals in the 2013-14 campaign while on loan at Newcastle United from QPR. Lille are hoping to rebuild in the upcoming season after a dreadful year which saw them only narrowly avoid relegation in May."
25,05/05/2018,02:10,Five things to watch out for in Ligue 1 this weekend,"Fresh from becoming the first French side to reach a European final since 2004 with their Europa League victory over Salzburg, Marseille turn their attentions back to the fight for a top-three spot in Ligue 1 this weekend.","Rudi Garcia's men are locked in a fight with Lyon and Monaco for the two Champions League spots behind champions Paris Saint-Germain, with just two points separating the three clubs. Here are five things to watch out for in Ligue 1 this weekend: Monaco will have to make do without injured captain Radamel Falcao as they bid to end a three-match winless streak which has dragged them into the battle for the top three. Falcao will sit out Sunday's visit to Caen with a thigh injury, while Leonardo Jardim is also missing Keita Balde, Stevan Jovetic and Adama Diakhaby. Those injury woes could mean a full debut for 18-year-old Moussa Sylla in one of Monaco's biggest games of the season after a dreadful run which was kicked off by the calamitous 7-1 thrashing by PSG. The player to watch in Ligue 1 at the moment is undoubtedly Lyon's Memphis Depay. The Dutch forward had an up-and-down start to the season but has exploded into life since scoring a dramatic late winner against Marseille in March. The 24-year-old, who struggled after a big-money move to Manchester United three years ago, has now scored seven goals and assisted six in his last six league matches. A goal against relegation-threatened Troyes on Sunday would take him to 20 in all competitions for the season for the first time since his last campaign at PSV Eindhoven in 2014/15. Garcia's revolution is well underway at Marseille, with the former European champions on the brink of a return to the continent's premier competition. Victory in the Europa League final over Atletico Madrid in Lyon on May 16 would secure a Champions League spot for next season, but Monaco's recent slump has also boosted their chances of qualifying through Ligue 1. Marseille have not played in the Champions League since losing all six of their group-stage matches in 2013, but Rolando's extra-time strike in Salzburg on Thursday kept them fighting on two fronts, and they host Nice in the pick of the weekend's matches on Sunday. Like Marseille, Lille went into this season expecting a revival after an influx of new players under Marcelo Bielsa, but instead face the ingnominy of dropping out of the top flight for the first time since being promoted in 2000. Argentinian Bielsa has been locked in a bitter legal battle with the club since being sacked last December, while the team has never managed to get out of trouble. Christophe Galtier's side head to fellow strugglers Toulouse knowing that defeat would leave their fate out of their own hands. Lille sit second-bottom in the table, two points adrift of 17th-placed Toulouse and behind Troyes, who occupy the relegation play-off place, on goal difference. In February Saint-Etienne were fighting to avoid the drop, but head into their clash with Bordeaux in fifth place and leading Nice and Rennes by one point in the race for the Europa League. They are unbeaten in 13 league matches, having won just once in their previous 13 outings. Ligue 1 fixtures on Sunday (all times GMT) Saint-Etienne v Bordeaux (1300), Lyon v Troyes (1430), Caen v Monaco, Dijon v Guingamp, Metz v Angers, Nantes v Montpellier, Rennes v Strasbourg, Toulouse v Lille (all 1500), Marseille v Nice (1905)"
26,01/04/2018,23:01,Crisis deepens as Lille lose again in empty stadium,Crisis-hit Lille plunged closer to relegation from Ligue 1 on Sunday with a 1-0 home loss to Amiens at an empty Stade Pierre-Mauroy.,"Ordered to play behind closed doors after a violent pitch invasion last month, Lille's season took another turn for the worse as they lost to their fellow strugglers to miss the chance to move out of the bottom two. Lille brought in Argentine coach Marcelo Bielsa in August in an attempt to return to Europe after a drop in fortunes since a French double in 2011, but the partnership went sour as Bielsa sued the club after being sacked due to a dreadful start to the campaign. Bielsa brought in a number of new players, but won only three of his first 14 games and current coach Christophe Galtier saw a transfer ban imposed on the club in December for poor finances. This was their eighth game without a win and they are second-bottom with seven games to go, one point adrift of Troyes, who occupy the relegation play-off place in 18th. Lille have lodged charges against ten of their own fans for ""aggravated violence, criminal damage and death threats"", while Ligue 1 authorities will rule on Thursday what further sanctions the northern club will face for the crowd trouble. Coach Galtier said he would make ""strong decisions"", but insisted he wouldn't resign. ""Match after match the situtation doesn't improve,"" he said. ""We'll make sure we fix it and if we can't change it in 24 hours then I may have to take strong decisions. ""Mistakes are one thing, behaviour and investment is another. We give up too quickly."" Later on Sunday, Lyon moved back to within two points of Marseille in the race for the third and final Champions League spot as Memphis Depay continued his hot streak of goalscoring form with a double in a 2-0 win over Toulouse. The Dutchman, who grabbed a crucial last-gasp winner at Marseille before the international break, swept home from the edge of the area to give Lyon a 23rd-minute lead after Houssem Aouar's quick feet opened up the away defence. Midfielder Tanguy Ndombele won a penalty shortly before half-time, and Depay stepped up to score his 12th league goal of the season. After being in and out of the Lyon side earlier in the campaign, the former Manchester United flop has rediscovered his best with four goals in as many games for club and country. Montpellier beat Caen 3-1 and Nice saw off Troyes 2-0 as both clubs drew level on points with fifth-placed Rennes in the fight for the Europa League places. Second-placed Monaco travel to Rennes on Wednesday after losing 3-0 to Paris Saint-Germain in the League Cup final on Saturday. Lucas Ocampos and Dimitri Payet struck in the final minutes as Marseille claimed a precious 3-1 win at Dijon in Ligue 1 on Saturday."
27,18/02/2018,19:43,Lyon lose more ground in Champions League race,Bertrand Traore struck twice but Lyon fell further behind their rivals for a Champions League berth in France after surrendering a two-goal lead in Sunday's 2-2 draw at struggling Lille.,"Burkina Faso forward Traore, who joined from Chelsea last July, scored twice in the first half as Lyon looked on course for a welcome victory following three successive defeats in Ligue 1. But goals after the break from Nicolas Pepe and Brazilian striker Luiz Araujo earned Christophe Galtier's side a point that left Lille just one place above the relegation zone. Lyon looked the side most capable of troubling Paris Saint-Germain after beating the league leaders in January, but a subsequent rotten run of form means they could finish the weekend six points adrift of third-placed Marseille. Rudi Garcia's men host in-form Bordeaux later on Sunday at the Velodrome. Earlier, Nice captain Dante scored his first Ligue 1 goal for the club in a 1-1 draw with Claudio Ranieri's Nantes to snap a four-match losing run. The result bumped Nantes back up to fifth, while Mario Balotelli's Nice -- who lost 3-2 to Lokomotiv Moscow in the Europa League on Thursday -- are ninth after halting their recent slide. Nantes goalkeeper Ciprian Tatarusanu had a busy and effective afternoon but Dante got a toe to a loose ball in a scramble to give last season's third-place finishers a fifth-minute lead at the Allianz Riviera. The 34-year-old Dante joined Nice from Wolfsburg in 2016 and this was his first strike for them in 55 league games. The equaliser for Ranieri's visitors came courtesy of an Emiliano Sala penalty on 27 minutes as the Argentine striker netted his 11th goal of the campaign. Atlantic coast outfit Nantes appointed Ranieri, who won the Premier League with Leicester, just ahead of the current campaign when Sergio Conceicao quit to join Porto. PSG defeated Strasbourg 5-2 on Saturday to remain perfect at home this campaign, while second-placed Monaco thumped Dijon 4-0 on Friday."
28,05/02/2018,00:09,Lopes caps rousing Monaco comeback win over Lyon,Rony Lopes struck a dramatic late winner as Monaco recovered from two goals down and overcame the first-half dismissal of Keita Balde to stun Lyon 3-2 in Ligue 1 on Sunday.,"Mariano Diaz scored a 12th-minute opener for Lyon at the Stade Louis II as his deflected shot from distance deceived Monaco goalkeeper Danijel Subasic, who hobbled off injured after tangling with the net. Lyon doubled their lead before the half-hour as Bertrand Traore, making his first league start since early November, volleyed in at the near post past replacement keeper Seydou Sy. But Senegal international Balde held off a succession of defenders before rifling in a low angled drive to halve the deficit just three minutes later. Radamel Falcao then equalised on 36 minutes when he converted the rebound after seeing his penalty, awarded for a foul on Kamil Glik, saved initially by Anthony Lopes. It took the Colombian to 17 league goals for the season -- trailing only Paris Saint-Germain duo Edinson Cavani (21) and Neymar (18). But Monaco were reduced to 10 men on the stroke of half-time as Balde, booked moments earlier for kicking away the ball in frustration, was shown a second yellow card for a nasty foul on Ferland Mendy. The hosts then lost captain Falcao to a thigh injury 10 minutes into the second half, but it was his replacement Stevan Jovetic who set up Portugal international Lopes for the winning goal a minute from time. Lyon conceded possession cheaply inside their own half, and the Montenegrin striker rolled the ball into the path of Lopes who drilled into the far corner to complete a sensational turnaround and help avenge last month's 3-2 loss in the French Cup. ""It was a very tough match. We conceded two goals far too early, we lost two players to injury and had a man sent off, everything was against us,"" Lopes said. ""But we showed we are a strong team and we deserved to win on the basis of the second half. It's our best match in terms of solidarity, but not in quality. We showed that we're a real team."" The result bumped Monaco up to third, one point behind Marseille, while Lyon finished the weekend a point outside the Champions League places in fourth after dropping from second. ""It was a sin not to have won tonight,"" Lyon coach Bruno Genesio said. ""Even worse to lose after the way we started. We had a really good start but then we practically stopped playing when we were 2-0 ahead."" Earlier, Claudio Ranieri's Nantes slumped to a 3-2 defeat at Caen as Damien Da Silva scored twice for the hosts, including an 80th-minute winner, after Yacine Bammou had grabbed a brace for the Canaries. Yeni Ngbakoto's stoppage-time goal at Roazhon Park edged Guingamp to a 1-0 victory at Rennes. A superb Neymar free-kick helped PSG to a 3-0 win at troubled Lille on Saturday as the Ligue 1 leaders began a decisive month as they mean to go on. The world's most expensive player netted the second goal at the Stade Pierre-Mauroy after Yuri Berchiche had opened the scoring just prior to half-time. Giovani Lo Celso's delightful chip secured the victory late on, with PSG now 11 points clear of Marseille at the top of the table. Marseille climbed to second on Friday as Florian Thauvin tormented Metz by hitting a hat-trick in a 6-3 rout of the league's basement side."
29,28/01/2018,23:47,"Fabinho grabs Monaco point at Marseille, Bordeaux stun Lyon","Fabinho struck to secure French champions Monaco an entertaining 2-2 draw at southern rivals Marseille on Sunday, while Malcom was at the centre of a penalty controversy as Bordeaux stunned Lyon.","Both teams at the Stade Velodrome missed the chance to take second place from Lyon, with Paris Saint-Germain now 11 points clear at the Ligue 1 summit. Keita Balde gave the visitors a fourth-minute lead, but Marseille centre-back Adil Rami quickly levelled with a close-range header. The hosts moved in front shortly after half-time as Valere Germain headed in against his former club. But Fabinho waltzed through the hapless home defence to equalise for Monaco, denying Marseille a seventh straight win in all competitions and extending his team's unbeaten league run to eight matches. ""Fabinho played a big match today, not only for the goal but for his defensive quality and ability to break the line,"" said Monaco coach Leonardo Jardim. The chase for the Champions League places remains wide open in France, with Lyon, Marseille and Monaco separated by just one point in the hunt for the second and third spots behind PSG. ""One point each was fair. In the war for second place there are no easy games, and it will continue like this until May,"" Jardim added. Senegal striker Balde, a close-season signing from Lazio, pounced on a loose ball to race clear and clip home his sixth league goal for Monaco and give them the perfect start. But the lead lasted less than three minutes, as Monaco shot themselves in the foot. A low cross from Valere Germain caused havoc and Florian Thauvin put pressure on right-back Almamy Toure, who saw his clearance deflected straight into the air for Rami to nod in his first league goal for Marseille. The game settled down after its frenetic start, but Rudi Garcia's hosts should have forged ahead in the 27th minute when Dimitri Payet blazed over with the goal at his mercy. Marseille completed the turnaround in the 47th minute, as Payet whipped in a free-kick and Germain stooped to send a diving header past away goalkeeper Danijel Subasic. It was the 27-year-old's 12th goal for OM since joining from Monaco last July. The champions hit back four minutes later, though, as Brazilian midfielder Fabinho strolled straight through the middle of the Marseille backline and slotted the ball in off the post. Monaco thought they had retaken the lead, but Jemerson's header was ruled out by the linesman's flag, despite the defender not being one of two visiting players in an offside position when Rachid Ghezzal swung in a free-kick. Both sides had chances to snatch all three points, with Marseille keeper Steve Mandanda denying Ghezzal and Germain volleying agonisingly wide, but neither could find the winner they needed to go second. Brazilian star Malcom appeared to dive for a crucial penalty as 10-man Bordeaux upset high-flying Lyon 3-1 to give new coach Gustavo Poyet a winning start in Ligue 1. Malcom, the 50 million-euro ($62m, £44m) rated winger who has been linked with Arsenal, also scored the 27th-minute penalty to give Bordeaux a shock 2-0 lead. Poyet had already seen Nicolas De Preville put the home side in front in south-western France, with Gaetan Laborde scoring another penalty for the hosts after Marcelo had pulled one back for Lyon. Bordeaux had another Brazilian, Otavio, sent off after the break but they held on to make it two wins from two games since previous coach Jocelyn Gourvennec was sacked. The result was a big blow to Lyon, who had beaten PSG at home last weekend and then won at Monaco in the French Cup on Wednesday. PSG beat Montpellier 4-0 on Saturday, with Neymar scoring twice and Angel Di Maria also on target after Edinson Cavani got the opener to take him to a club record 157 goals in all competitions."
30,12/12/2017,20:57,Struggling Lille hit with transfer ban,"Ligue 1 strugglers Lille, who recently suspended coach Marcelo Bielsa, have been slapped with a transfer ban, the French league (LFP) announced on Tuesday.","A brief statement said that Lille were ""banned from recruiting"" following a hearing before French football's financial watchdog, the DNCG, in Paris into their financial situation. While the length of the ban was not made public, it does at least mean Lille will be unable to strengthen in the January transfer window. That is a major blow to a club who currently lie in the relegation play-off place in France's top flight. Bought earlier this year by Gerard Lopez, a Luxembourg-born businessman of Spanish origin, the 2011 French league and cup double winners spent big in the last close season and appointed Bielsa as coach in the hope of challenging towards the top of the table again. But the enigmatic Argentine was suspended by the club last month in the wake of a poor start to the campaign. Lille are hoping to sack Bielsa for serious misconduct and the two parties are presently locked in a battle over financial compensation due to the former Marseille coach."
31,09/12/2017,20:52,PSG sink managerless Lille to halt slide,Runaway leaders Paris Saint-Germain shook off the absence of the suspended Neymar on Saturday to end their recent wobble with a 3-1 win over managerless Lille in Ligue 1.,"Angel Di Maria nodded in a cross from Kylian Mbappe on 28 minutes at a chilly Parc des Princes, with Javier Pastore powering in a second just after half-time. Anwar El Ghazi gave Lille, who suspended manager Marcelo Bielsa last month and replaced him with a team of four interim coaches, a glimmer of hope by pulling a goal back four minutes from time. But with goalkeeper Mike Maignan up for a last-gasp corner, Mbappe burst free of the Lille backline after the ball was cleared upfield to dribble in a third as PSG ended a run of back-to-back defeats. ""We needed this win after the last two defeats to get our rhythm back and regain confidence,"" PSG defender Presnel Kimpembe told Canal Plus. ""We've done that today and we're very pleased. ""Criticism in football is normal. Everyone is used to these kinds of things and it drew a reaction from us."" The win provisionally moved Unai Emery's team 12 points clear of Lyon, Monaco and Marseille at the top and ensured PSG will head into the new year in first place in France. ""There's still a long way to go, and the most important thing will be after 38 matches,"" added Kimpembe. ""I'm happy with the display,"" said Emery, who remains unbeaten at home since taking over as PSG coach in June of last year. ""We controlled the match better than in our last two league games, against Troyes and Strasbourg."" Defeat snapped a two-match winning run for Lille and left them just two points clear of the relegation zone ahead of Saturday's later games. France paid a ""national homage"" to late rock star Johnny Hallyday, known as the French Elvis, on Saturday with a procession down the Champs Elysees. The French league is also honouring Hallyday, who died aged 74 on Wednesday after a battle with lung cancer, at grounds around the country this weekend, with some of his most famous songs played before kick-off in Paris. PSG were looking to end their worst week of the season, after a 2-1 defeat at Strasbourg last weekend was followed by a 3-1 reverse away to Bayern Munich in the Champions League. It was the first time in three years that PSG had lost successive games, but the capital club set about righting the ship as Di Maria headed in an Mbappe cross -- the flag staying down despite the Frenchman straying marginally offside. PSG lost midfielder Adrien Rabiot to an apparent hamstring injury at the break, but Pastore doubled the hosts' advantage by blasting past Maignan after Marco Verratti robbed Ibrahim Amadou of possession deep in Lille territory. Mbappe nearly added a third when his low strike was awkwardly tipped onto the post by Maignan, but Lille received a lifeline when Giovani Lo Celso's sliding challenge inadvertently set up substitute El Ghazi. Edinson Cavani was denied a league-leading 18th goal of the campaign as Maignan plunged down low to his right to superbly deny the Uruguayan, but the Lille keeper was nowhere to be seen when Mbappe sealed victory in the closing seconds."
32,23/11/2017,00:31,Bielsa suspended by struggling Lille,"Argentine coach Marcelo Bielsa was suspended by Lille on Wednesday after a dreadful start to the French season, the struggling Ligue 1 club announced.","Lille are second from bottom after just three wins in 13 matches under Bielsa, with the 62-year-old ""suspended momentarily as coach"" pending further announcement, according to a statement on the Lille website. Bielsa was due to hold a press conference on Thursday ahead of Saturday's trip to Montpellier, but there was no confirmation from the club whether it would go ahead as planned. According to French sports daily L'Equipe, Lille club officials met in London on Wednesday and reached a decision to part ways with Bielsa. But reports in South America claimed Bielsa had left for Chile to be at the bedside of cancer-stricken former assistant Luis Maria Bonini, prompting his suspension. The Argentine returned to France this summer for a second spell in Ligue 1, following a previous stint at Marseille between 2014 and 2015, but has failed to deliver results at Lille despite the club investing over 60 million euros ($70.9 million) in the transfer market. Lille appeared to have halted their plight with back-to-back wins over Metz and Saint-Etienne, but Monday's alarming 3-0 defeat at newly-promoted Amiens plunged them back into the automatic relegation places. ""As for my job, this result increases my share of the responsibility because the difference in quality between the two sides was clearly in our favour,"" Bielsa said after the loss to Amiens. ""If the team with less talented players wins 3-0 against us, it is my responsibility."" Lille hired the enigmatic Argentine to front an ambitious project under new owner Gerard Lopez, but their latest loss sent the 2011 champions back 19th in the table with just 12 points from 13 matches. He said this month he ""would not resign from Lille for any reason"", but his future looks in serious doubt, with the club also set to go to third-placed Lyon next weekend, ahead of a trip to leaders Paris Saint-Germain on December 9."

The travelling supporters who filled the same section of Amiens' Stade de la Licorne on Monday saw their side slump to a heavy loss with Harrison Manzala starting the rout by scoring either side of half-time for the hosts. Senegalese forward Moussa Konate then made it 3-0 five minutes from the end, and it would have been worse for Lille had Emmanuel Bourgaud's late free-kick not thumped the post. ""I don't want to divert attention because the less good team beat the better side 3-0 and it was a deserved result,"" Bielsa said. ""As for my job, this result increases my share of the responsibility because the difference in quality between the two sides was clearly in our favour. ""If the team with less talented players wins 3-0 against us, it is my responsibility."" Lille, who hired enigmatic Argentine coach Bielsa in the close season to front an ambitious project under new owner Gerard Lopez, had won their previous two outings against bottom side Metz and Saint-Etienne. But this loss sent the 2011 champions back to second-bottom spot with just 12 points from 13 matches. And they have away matches at Montpellier and third-placed Lyon coming up next, with a trip to leaders Paris Saint-Germain also looming next month."

Saint-Etienne stay sixth in the table, after losing their first game under new coach Julien Sable since Oscar Garcia quit this week. Lille forward Nicolas Pepe leapt highest at the back post to open the scoring in the 20th minute at the Stade Pierre-Mauroy with his third goal in two matches. Jonathan Bamba fired home a penalty on the stroke of half-time to equalise for the visitors, but the hosts retook the lead in the 71st minute. Brazilian Thiago Mendes proved the difference, as the 25-year-old midfielder curled into the bottom corner from outside the area to score his second goal for Lille since joining from Sao Paulo in the close season. Striker Ezequiel Ponce added some gloss to the scoreline with a minute of normal time to play as he slotted in his first goal since signing on loan from Roma."

The 20-year-old played three times as Brazil won the 2016 Olympic gold medal on home soil, alongside the likes of Paris Saint-Germain defender Marquinhos and Barcelona star Neymar, who has been linked with a move to the French capital. ""I've worked hard since I was a little boy to be able to one day realise this dream of coming to play in Europe,"" Maia said in a statement on the Lille website. Maia joins his compatriots Luiz Araujo and Thiago Mendes in signing for Lille since former Marseille coach Bielsa took over in June. Lille finished 11th in the French top flight last season, and will be hoping that Argentinian Bielsa can help them return to the Champions League for the first time since the 2014-15 season, when they lost in the play-off round."

Lille director general Marc Ingla confirmed that Corchia was set to undergo a medical in Spain before signing his contract with Sevilla. Corchia joined Lille from Sochaux in 2014 and has appeared in several France squads, winning his first and only cap to date in a friendly against the Ivory Coast last November. Sevilla finished fourth in La Liga last season to qualify for the Champions League and have since named Eduardo Berizzo as coach to replace the departing Jorge Sampaoli. Lille, who have appointed the enigmatic Argentine Marcelo Bielsa as coach, had already moved to cover his departure by signing another right-back, Kevin Malcuit from Saint-Etienne."
39,19/02/2017,12:41,Lille lure Bielsa back to France,"Iconic Argentinian coach Marcelo Bielsa, known as 'el Loco' for his intense 'all in' style, will be back in France as manager of Lille as of July, the newly bought out Ligue 1 club said on Sunday.","""Lille and the Argentine coach have signed a two years deal which comes into effect in July,"" Lille announced. Rumours had been ripe that Bielsa, who handled Argentina and Chile before succesful stints at Atletico Bilbao and Marseille, would join the struggling northerners who were French champions in 2011. Bielsa is known for cranking up the pressure and squeezing the most out of modest formations, taking Athletic Bilbao to a Europa League final in 2012, and coming close to a French title with Marseille. He left Marseille in a blaze of fury one game into the 2015-2016 season, before a two day stint at Italian side Lazio. Lille are 14th in Ligue 1, and were taken over three weeks ago by Luxembourg-Spanish businessman Gerard Lopez, a colourful tycoon and former owner of Formula One team Lotus. Earlier this week Lopez recruited Franck Passi who was Bielsa's assistant at Marseille, to oversee the rest of the season."
40,26/01/2017,17:25,Tycoon takes over at French strugglers Lille,A colourful tycoon under whom the Formula One team Lotus went bankrupt on Thursday officially became the new owner of debt-ridden French Ligue 1 club Lille.,"Luxembourg-Spanish businessman Gerard Lopez, who has also been linked with a takeover of Premier League Hull City, acquired a 95-percent stake in Lille for 80 million euros ($85 million) including the club's debts. Currently a lowly 14th in Ligue 1, Lille won a league and cup double in 2011, kick-starting the careers of Eden Hazard, Mathieu Debuchy and Yohan Cabaye. The 45-year-old Lopez -- said to have extensive business interests in Russia -- takes over as club president with the deal set to be rubber-stamped by French financial watchdog, the DNCG, on Friday. Lopez made a fortune in the field of technology but has already been involved in sport -- under his leadership Lotus went bust, before being bought for a symbolic euro by Renault. Lille said that interim coach Patrick Collot, who took over from Frederic Antonetti in November, will likely stay on until the end of the season. The 49-year-old steadied the side after they tumbled as low as 19th in the league, but Collot has never qualified for the Ligue 1 coaching certificate, triggering a 25,000 euro fine for every game he oversees. ""They've told me I'm keeping the job for the moment, if the results go well I'm staying in the job until the end of the season,"" Collot said.

42,29/08/2016,13:40,Southampton make club record swoop for Boufal,Premier League club Southampton smashed their transfer record on Monday to swoop for Lille's Morocco international midfielder Sofiane Boufal.,"Boufal, 22, agreed a five-year contract with the Saints and is reported to have cost £16 million ($20 million/ 18 million euros). Southampton's previous record signing was Dani Osvaldo, who cost £15 million from Roma in 2013. ""I'm very, very happy to sign for Southampton and I am really excited to play in St Mary's Stadium in front of the fans,"" Boufal told Southampton's website. ""Southampton showed big interest in signing me, and I can see that this club is the best place for me to continue my progression as a footballer. ""I hope I can achieve many great things with Southampton. It is a very good club, with excellent facilities, and I feel it is the perfect environment to continue my development."" Lille said earlier that only the medical visit could hold up the transfer. Boufal underwent surgery in Qatar in May on his right knee cartilage. He will not be available to play until at least the end of the September. Lille's deputy general manager Jean-Michel Vandamme told AFP: ""We have been very transparent. ""They know everything and if they hire him it is on that basis,"" the Lille official added. Boufal became one of the most highly-rated youngsters in France after moving from Angers in January 2015. He attracted Southampton's interest after scoring 12 goals in all competitions last season to help Lille finish fifth in Ligue 1 and qualify for the Europa League, while also reaching the Coupe de la Ligue final. ""Sofiane is a player we have watched develop closely over the last few years, and we're thrilled to have him join the club ahead of what promises to be a very exciting season, with Europa League football on the horizon,"" Southampton's executive director of football Les Reed said. ""His excellent campaign with Lille last season meant a number of clubs were pursuing him to secure his services, but we're delighted that Sofiane sees Southampton as the best place for him to continue his development. Claude Puel, who took over as Saints manager during the close-season, had plenty of chances to watch Boufal up close after spending the last four years as boss of Ligue 1 side Nice. Boufal is Southampton's latest expensive recruit. They spent £10 million to sign Nathan Redmond from Norwich and £12 million on Bayern Munich's Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg. Puel had been looking to add more firepower to his squad after Saints sold last season's top scorers Sadio Mane and Graziano Pelle."

In conceding just 27 goals, Lille enjoyed the league's second best defence after runaway champions Paris Saint-Germain. Enyeama retired from international duty last year after having won a Nigerian record 101 caps."

45,23/04/2016,23:25,PSG beat Lille to retain French League Cup,Ten-man Paris Saint-Germain beat Lille 2-1 in the French League Cup final at the Stade de France on Saturday to remain on course for a domestic clean sweep of titles.,"The Ligue 1 champions took the lead five minutes before half-time in contentious circumstances, with Javier Pastore's shot passing through the legs of an offside Layvin Kurzawa on its way into the net. But Lille hit back shortly after the restart when Djibril Sidibe fired a free-kick through the wall and into the net. The capital city side were dealt a huge blow when Adrien Rabiot was shown a second yellow card for a cynical foul on the impressive Sofiane Boufal with 20 minutes remaining. But a moment of madness from Lille goalkeeper Vincent Enyeama allowed Angel Di Maria to roll in the winner with 16 minutes to play for his 15th goal of the season. Laurent Blanc's men now have three trophies this term with a French Cup final against Marseille to come, as they look to ease the pain of their Champions League quarter-final defeat to Manchester City. ""My players, even at 10 against 11, wanted to win that game,"" coach Blanc told television channel France 2, after his team won the final for the third year in a row. ""We have a season to finish in the league and the French Cup on May 21, when we can end on a good note. ""Now we have already won the League Cup, I hope my players will be focused and motivated for the French Cup."" PSG thrashed Bastia 4-0 12 months ago to seal a record fifth League Cup title, while Lille were playing in the final of the competition for the first time. Blanc opted to play Lucas Moura alongside Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Di Maria up front, leaving Edinson Cavani on the bench, while the returning Marco Verratti was named among the substitutes. PSG should have taken the lead just 21 seconds in, but after being set up by Ibrahimovic, Di Maria drilled his shot from only 10 yards out straight at Enyeama, who made an excellent save. Lille, who came into this match on a six-game winning streak, grew into the contest and PSG goalkeeper Salvatore Sirigu had to be alert to prevent Marquinhos from putting through his own net after Mounir Obbadi's pass caused panic in the defence. The holders though broke the deadlock when a corner was only cleared as far as Pastore. The Argentine's scuffed volley took a wicked deflection to beat Enyeama, whose furious appeals that Kurzawa was interfering with play from an offside position were waved away. Enyeama had to be dragged away from the officials at the interval, but Lille channelled their frustrations perfectly by levelling in the 49th minute. Sirigu, who has only been first-choice keeper in the cup competitions in his final campaign in France, was left apoplectic at his defenders after full-back Sidibe grabbed his sixth goal of the season with a low free-kick that split the wall in two. Things went from bad to worse for PSG when they were reduced to ten men after Rabiot hacked down the marauding Boufal. The deciding goal was one of the most bizarre of the season, and Nigerian keeper Enyeama was at fault. A long clearance from Sirigu was nodded through for Di Maria by Lille's Adama Soumaoro, but despite having defenders covering, Enyeama raced 30 yards out of his goal to give the PSG forward the simple task of knocking the ball past him and into a gaping net. Frederic Antonetti's Lille had chances to equalise, with Soumaoro heading wide from a free-kick and Obbadi seeing his volley bounce agonisingly past the post, but PSG held on."
46,22/04/2016,20:24,PSG wary of in-form Lille in League Cup final,Paris Saint-Germain coach Laurent Blanc knows Lille pose a serious threat to his side's chances of completing another clean sweep of the domestic trophies as the teams prepare to clash in Saturday's French League Cup final.,"With the Ligue 1 title and the season-opening Champions Trophy already in the bag, PSG are bidding to win the League Cup for the third year on the bounce before returning to the Stade de France for a French Cup final against Marseille next month. However, Lille have found form at the right time, with six straight victories lifting them up to sixth in Ligue 1 and ensuring they head to the national stadium full of confidence. ""They are the form team of the moment but the context is always a bit unusual in a final,"" Blanc said at a press conference on Friday. ""Lille, physically, will oblige us to be really very strong. They are on form and still fresh physically, which is maybe not the case with us."" PSG rebounded from the enormous disappointment of their Champions League quarter-final exit to Manchester City by beating Caen 6-0 last weekend and then defeating Lorient 1-0 in the French Cup semi-final with a Zlatan Ibrahimovic winner. ""At the start of the season the objective was to win one cup and we are in the final of both. We want to win the two cups. If we don't win them then clearly we will not have fulfilled our objective,"" admitted Blanc. The coach also revealed that Italian playmaker Marco Verratti is fit and could make his first appearance in two months after a groin injury. ""He is fit. That has not always been the case. All going to plan Marco Verratti will be in the squad so I am happy,"" he said. Lille have not lifted any silverware since winning the Ligue 1 and French Cup double in 2011. Then, they secured the title against PSG at the Parc des Princes and also beat the capital club in the cup final. They have never won the League Cup, and coach Frederic Antonetti is hoping it will be fourth time lucky after being a beaten finalist with Bastia in 1995, Nice in 2006 and Rennes in 2013. ""I said to myself the other day, the first final (a 2-0 defeat to PSG with Bastia) took place in 1995 and I am here again 21 years later to talk about it. That's already not bad,"" he said."

Morgan Amalfitano had resurgent Lille in front at the break before a dramatic second half saw both sides reduced to 10 men, Renato Civelli's red card for the hosts being followed by Elderson Echiejile's dismissal for Monaco. Eder, Mounir Obbadi and Djibril Sidibe added further goals for Lille before Fares Bahlouli netted a consolation for a well beaten Monaco side. Even third spot is far from secure for Monaco with not only Nice but Rennes and Saint-Etienne on 51 points, and even Lille in sixth on 49 points still in contention. As Monaco slide Nice are now on form and their star striker Ben Arfa in inspirational mood in their comfortable victory over fellow European hopefuls Rennes. But Monaco coach Leonardo Jardim insists his side are not looking at the teams queueing up behind them, but at catching Lyon in second. ""This is a bad day. There was physical and mental fatigue,"" Jardim said. ""We have lost our advantage, but there are still 15 points to play for so it's still possible to finish second. We will work hard to achieve that goal."" Lille have been transformed from relegation contenders into European hopefuls under Frederic Antonetti and they are seventh after claiming a fifth consecutive win. Amalfitano had hit the post before he controlled an Eder knockdown and fired into the roof of the net on 37 minutes at the Stade Pierre-Mauroy. Lille had Civelli sent off shortly after the restart after the Argentine shoved Ricardo Carvalho to the floor off the ball, but Echiejile followed on 63 minutes for a reckless challenge on Sebastien Corchia. The hosts doubled their lead soon after that, with Portugal forward Eder stroking a shot low into the bottom-left corner to mark an impressive display with a goal. Sofiane Boufal then set up Obbadi for the third goal and Junior Tallo picked out Sidibe to make it four with a finish through the legs of Monaco goalkeeper Danijel Subasic. Substitute Bahlouli netted at the death for Jardim's side, who are now in real danger of missing out on the Champions League. Nice bounced back from defeat at PSG last weekend by cruising to their fourth win in five matches. Ben Arfa opened the scoring from the penalty spot in the 33rd minute with his 14th league goal of the season, before coolly finishing from Vincent Koziello's excellent through ball shortly before half-time. The 29-year-old completed the first hat-trick of his career in the second half with the best goal of the bunch, carrying the ball from inside his own half before drilling an unstoppable shot into the far corner. There was crowd trouble as struggling giants Marseille drew 0-0 at home to Bordeaux as the pressure eased slightly on under pressure home coach Michel. Instead fans angry the side has failed to win at home since September targetted the club's owner Margarita Louis-Dreyfus, who inherited Marseille from her late husband with banners in the stands reading ""Go back to your real job, housewife"" and ""Rich, incompetent heiress"". The former European champions should now avoid relegation however being six points above relegation with four games to go. But fans got so out of hand police fired tear-gas into a tribune in time added on at Sunday's late game, sending many players back to the dressing room with watering eyes. Lyon won 2-0 at Montpellier on Friday thanks to a Maxwell Cornet brace while Saint-Etienne were 1-0 winners against already-relegated Troyes. Paris Saint-Germain warmed up for their Champions League showdown with Manchester City by winning 2-0 at Guingamp on Saturday with a shadow line-up and Lucas Moura scoring both goals."
48,21/02/2016,23:08,Nine-man Lyon slump to defeat at Lille,"Nine-man Lyon missed the chance to move into the third and final Champions League place in France as they lost 1-0 at Lille on Sunday, while Michy Batshuayi rescued a 1-1 draw for Marseille against Saint-Etienne.","Sofiane Boufal scored the only goal of the game at Lille in the 28th minute, as a desperately poor Lyon saw their run of three consecutive wins come to an end. After Saint-Etienne's draw, Lyon knew three points would move them into the coveted third place, but they failed to take their chance. Boufal has been the only stand-out performer in a lifeless Lille attack this season, and he opened the scoring at the Stade Pierre-Mauroy with his eighth goal this term. His free-kick from the left wing evaded everyone in the middle, including a leaden-footed Lyon goalkeeper Anthony Lopes, as it bounced into the net. After scoring 10 goals in a run of three comprehensive victories, Bruno Genesio's Lyon would have been confident going into this encounter. But they created very little in a drab first half display and shortly after the restart they were lucky to see Lille striker Yassine Benzia drag a shot hopelessly wide when in on goal. On the hour mark any fading hopes the visitors had of moving into the Champions League spots were all but ended, when right-back Christophe Jallet saw a second yellow card for holding back Eric Bautheac. Lille have the second-worst attack in the division but the second-best defence, so perhaps it was no surprise that Lyon struggled to create chances. A miserable outing for Lyon was ended as Clement Grenier's elbow into the face of Florent Balmont left them with only nine men. At the Velodrome OM's Belgian forward Batshuayi had come off the bench 15 minutes from the end and headed home a Romain Alessandrini free-kick in the fifth minute of injury-time. That was a 13th league goal of the season for Batshuayi, putting him behind only Zlatan Ibrahimovic in the Ligue 1 goalscoring charts. It was only five minutes from time that St Etienne thought they had scored the potentially winning goal that would have sent them above Nice into third place in Ligue 1. Kevin Monnet-Paquet shot home left-footed from Romain Hamouma's pass. ""Nothing we saw was new -- we created chances, we were close to scoring, we got back into the match just like against Lille (a 1-1 draw), we fought to the end and there was a lot of courage,"" said Marseille coach Michel. The draw barely helps either side as St Etienne stay behind Nice on goal difference, while Marseille are 10th and still five points behind in the tight race to qualify for Europe's premier club competition. Asked if he feared for his job, Michel said: ""I don't think about that, never. I think about doing my job and going forwards."" Caen ended a three-match losing streak, as a first goal in French football for Burundian midfielder Saidi Ntibazonkiza saw off Rennes. The 28-year-old has broken into the first team in recent weeks and took his chance with a fine second half finish, moving Caen above their opponents and to within two points of the top three. For Rennes though the pressure continues to build, they are now lower in the table than they were a month ago when they sacked former manager Philippe Montanier and brought in Rolland Courbis. There was one positive for Courbis as midfielder Yoann Gourcuff made his first start since rejoining the club in the summer, being withdrawn in the 59th minute. On Saturday, Paris Saint-Germain maintained their 24-point lead with a 4-1 victory over lowly Reims as Ibrahimovic scored a brace. They now need only three more wins and a draw from their final 11 matches to win the Ligue 1 title. Monaco remain second after a 3-1 win over rock-bottom Troyes sent them eight points clear of Nice, who drew 0-0 at Bordeaux on Friday."
49,13/02/2016,19:02,PSG warm up for Chelsea clash with Lille draw,A much-changed Paris Saint-Germain warmed up for their Champions League showdown with Chelsea with a low-key goalless draw at home to struggling Lille at the Parc des Princes on Saturday.,"Edinson Cavani had the best chance for the runaway Ligue 1 leaders but somehow missed the target with the goal gaping in the second half. The result ended a run of 16 consecutive wins in all competitions but it did allow Laurent Blanc's side to extend their record-breaking unbeaten run in Ligue 1 to 35 matches and left them still undefeated domestically since March last year. Lille will be delighted with a point that boosts their fight against relegation, but this was a Paris side missing top scorer Zlatan Ibrahimovic, captain Thiago Silva, Thiago Motta and Maxwell. That quartet were all rested with one eye on Tuesday's last-16, first leg at home to an improving Chelsea, and Blanc made eight changes altogether to the side that beat Lyon 3-0 in the French Cup in midweek. Of the likely starting line-up against the Premier League side, only goalkeeper Kevin Trapp, David Luiz, Blaise Matuidi and Angel Di Maria started, while Marco Verratti was back on the bench after being troubled by injury recently. Lille, meanwhile, were without their biggest creative threat Sofiane Boufal due to suspension and Portugal striker Eder, freshly arrived on loan from Swansea City, was absent due to injury. It was always going to be a backs to the wall job for the away side but they have the meanest defence in the division after their opponents and were rarely troubled in the first half. Vincent Enyeama saved well from young forward Jean-Kevin Augustin and Layvin Kurzawa saw his header cleared off the line in a first period low on excitement. Verratti, the Italy midfielder whose presence is seen as critical against Chelsea, replaced the disappointing Javier Pastore at the start of the second half and Paris passed up a glorious chance to open the scoring in the 56th minute. Nigerian keeper Enyeama dropped a cross from the PSG left and the ball fell to Cavani, who somehow contrived to blast the ball high and wide despite being left with a gaping goal. Enyeama then saved from a deflected shot by Lucas, who had come on for Di Maria, as Lille held out for the first goalless draw at the Parc des Princes in Ligue 1 since December 2014. PSG are still a huge 25 points clear at the top of the table from Monaco, who visit Saint-Etienne on Sunday. Nice, in third, host Marseille on Sunday when Lyon are at home to Caen."

Reaching the last four of Europe's premier club competition is the principal objective for PSG this season, but on Thursday Blanc received the Qatari owners' unequivocal backing after penning a contract extension until 2018. ""I'm very happy, also for my staff. A coach is nothing without his staff. For us, continuing the adventure is a show of faith but also a big responsibility,"" Blanc said of his renewal. ""The club has ambitions both nationally and in Europe, and we'll do all we can to reach those objectives."" PSG president Nasser Al-Khelaifi insisted he never had any doubts that the former France coach was the right man to take the club forward. ""I always had confidence in Laurent Blanc, I never thought about appointing another coach,"" said Al-Khelaifi, adding he had ""always believed in (Blanc's) ability to take the team to a higher level each season"". PSG are well on course to sew up a fourth successive league title, with a huge 24-point lead over nearest rivals Monaco, but Saturday's match at the Parc des Princes is the seventh in an eight-game series in little over three weeks. ""The calendar can't get any tighter than that. If you talk to me about the fixture list, I get heated, so it's better to avoid it,"" Blanc said after Wednesday's 3-0 victory over Lyon sent holders PSG through to the quarter-finals of the French Cup. ""As of Sunday, we'll start preparing for the game against Chelsea. The game against Lille, with all respect to Lille, is badly timed."" Second-place Monaco can widen the gap between themselves and the chasing pack in the race for France's other automatic Champions League qualifying spot when they visit Saint-Etienne, who are six points adrift in fourth, on Sunday. Third-place Nice, above Saint-Etienne on goal difference, host Marseille although Claude Puel's Champions League hopefuls will be without leading scorer Hatem Ben Arfa after the France international was ruled out for around a month with a hamstring injury. Lyon have forced their way back into European contention with successive 3-0 wins over Bordeaux and Angers, and Bruno Genesio's side will seek to bounce back from their cup exit at home to Caen. ""We've shown we have the quality to compete at the top of the table from here until the end of the season,"" Genesio said following the defeat in Paris, with teenage striker Maxwell Cornet adding to that sentiment. ""We've managed to pick ourselves up in the league. We have to continue to work hard ahead of Sunday's match,"" said Cornet, who was disappointed Lyon were unable to build on a promising start again PSG in midweek. Slumping Angers, losers of five of their past seven matches, will aim to arrest their slide and reignite an unlikely European challenge away to Rennes on Friday. Nantes and Lorient, who both progressed to the last eight of the French Cup on Wednesday, meet in a Brittany derby on Saturday, while Montpellier host fellow strugglers Toulouse with both sides bidding to avoid relegation.

51,01/02/2016,18:39,Lille sign Portugal striker from Swansea,"Portuguese international striker Eder has joined Lille on a six-month loan from English Premier League outfit Swansea, the French club said on Monday.","The powerful 28-year-old scored 26 goals in 60 games with Braga in Portugal between 2012-2015, as he also broke into the national side and played twice for Portugal at the 2014 World Cup. But he failed to nail a first team place in the Premier League after joining Swansea in 2015, playing second fiddle to French target man Bafetimbi Gomis. And with Euro 2016 in mind the Guinea-Bissau born centre-forward wanted more game time. ""I'm impressed with the set up here, the training ground and stadium and I was very well received by the Lille management, so I'm very happy to be here,"" the dread-locked striker told the press whilst sporting the red Lille shirt. ""Now I'm raring to get training with my new teammates,"" he said. Eder's new side have scored just 18 goals in 23 Ligue 1 games this season and coach Frederic Antoetti described the forward as exactly what he had been looking for."
52,26/01/2016,23:11,Lille punish Bordeaux to make first League Cup final,Lille eased past an error-strewn Bordeaux 5-1 on Tuesday to secure their first ever appearance in a French League Cup final.,"Their opponents in the April 23 final at the Stade de France will be the winner of Wednesday's semi-final between Paris Saint-Germain and Toulouse. Three-time winners Bordeaux were the form side going into the last four tie at Lille's Stade Pierre-Mauroy. Willy Sagnol's team arrived unbeaten in 11 matches in all competitions after a late show rescued an unlikely point against Nantes at the weekend. In contrast Lille had seen their recent resurgence under new coach Frederic Antonetti stutter. They were dumped out of the French Cup by fourth-tier Trelissac and suffered the ignominy of becoming the first team to lose to Troyes in the league this term. But it was Lille who raced into a seventh minute lead when after good work by Florent Balmont on the left Djibril Sidibe crossed to Yassine Benzia who capitalised on a collision between Diego Contento and goalkeeper Jerome Prior to score from six yards. On 23 minutes, Lille had the ball in the back of the net again only for Sidibe's effort to be ruled offside. Bordeaux drew back level ten minutes later after Lille defender Bakary Soumaoro lost possession, with Clement Chantome arriving quickly on the scene to fire between the legs of Vincent Enyeama. Bordeaux were without injured first choice keeper goalkeeper Cedric Carrasso, but back-up stopper Prior performed wonders to deny Rony Lopes's left-footed shot on 36 minutes. Lille, who had fallen at this stage in 2013 to Saint-Etienne and last season to PSG, wrapped up the tie as half-time approached. First Bordeaux defender Ludovic Lamine Sane inadvertently put them back in front when he lobbed helpless Prior shortly after replacing Andre Biyogo Poko. Then Soumoaro connected with Renato Civelli's header following a free kick to send Lille heading for the final. Eric Bautheac added the fourth near the hour mark with Soufiane Boufal putting the finishing touches to a memorable night for the hosts in the third minute of injury time. On Wednesday, PSG continue their quest for a domestic treble when they meet Toulouse for the third time in just eleven days. Having already knocked Dominique Arribage's men out of the French Cup and beaten them in the league in the last fortnight, PSG will be looking to complete a quick-fire hat-trick of wins in their League Cup semi-final at the Parc des Princes. Laurent Blanc's side are going for a third successive League Cup success and with the league title all but sealed already, they can afford to focus on the three cup competitions."

Amalfitano won one cap for France, against Germany in 2012 when he was playing for Marseille. He spent time on loan at West Bromwich Albion before a spell of just over a year at West Ham. Lille have also brought the young Portuguese midfielder Rony Lopes back to the club for a second loan spell. Lopes, 20, has joined from Monaco for the rest of the campaign after a successful stint last season when he belonged to Manchester City."

Striker Eric Bautheac opened the scoring for Lille with a fine header on 28 minutes and doubled the tally with a tap in on 56 minutes before Djibril Sidibe ended any suspense on six minutes from time. With the attention of the football world fixed on the Euro 2016 draw, the day's Ligue 1 programme featured none of the major teams. Runaway leaders Paris Saint Germain are 15 points clear at the top and host Lyon on Sunday evening as second placed Angers entertain Bordeaux earlier in the afternoon. Elsewhere on Saturday evening, bottom side Troyes earned just their seventh point of the season with a 1-1 draw at home to Bastia. Second from bottom Toulouse got a point at Nantes with a 1-1 draw while Montpellier came from behind to beat Guingamp 2-1. Nice started the season well but gave up a late 1-1 draw at Reims to extend their winless run to four league games. After three matches without a goal, at least Claude Puel's men raced into a lead from their first real attack with a towering header from striker Valere Germain. It was his eighth league goal of the season. Nice were guilty however of sitting back on their single goal lead and conceded a penalty under pressure, converted with 15 minutes to go by Diego Rigonato. In Friday's games Rennes and Caen shared the spoils after a 1-1 draw that kept Caen third ahead of Monaco's chance to climb above them on Sunday when they host Saint Etienne. Laurent Blanc's PSG will look to continue a stunning start to their campaign that has seen them drop just six points. Paris have not lost a domestic game since March and a fourth straight title already appears a formality. Elsewhere, Marseille can continue their mini-revival at home to Corsican side Gazelec Ajaccio with the top three just six points above them."

Earlier, on Thursday the 33-year-old Lille goalkeeper, who has been Nigeria skipper since Joseph Yobo quit international football last year, vowed ""not to walk out on Nigeria"". But later Thursday, Enyeama announced via Instagram he has quit the country's team. ""I have fought a good fight for more than 13 years.

58,14/08/2015,22:29,Monaco top despite dull draw at home to Lille,Monaco took a brief hold on top spot in the French league after just two games despite being held to a drab goalless draw at home by Lille on Friday night.,"But their stay is unlikely to last 24 hours as Saturday night's fixtures seem sure to see them overhauled. An error-ridden match yielded few chances, although Monaco had the visitors pegged back in their own for virtually the first half-hour but were unable to capitalise on some swift running down the left by Portuguese winger Ivan Cavaleiro. In the end it was Lille who finished the stronger but neither side ever seriously threatened to break the deadlock. Having allowed a few early careless tackles to pass unpunished, referee Benoit Millot had no hesitation in reaching into his pocket for the first yellow card of the evening 24 minutes in after Lille defender Sebastien Corchia went in late on Cavaleiro with a crude challenge. Corchia's interest in the game ended shortly afterwards, however, when he was involved in a clash of heads with Cavaleiro as they both went up for a cross in the area and he was laid out before being hauled off and taken to hospital as a precaution. Monaco should probably have taken the lead a minute before the interval when Joao Moutinho struck a perfect free kick which Lille's Nigerian international goalkeeper Vincent Enyeama scrambled behind for a corner after Argentina defender Renato Civelli had got himself booked for a late challenge on Jeremy Toulalan. Lille's first real chance came just after the restart when Baptiste Guillaume slipped in behind the home defence and clipped a Sofiane Boufal pass straight at goalkeeper Danijel Subasic. The 'keeper had to be at his sharpest again two minutes later to clear a second Guillaume shot with his feet after he was put through again by the lively Boufal down the left. Former Monaco midfielder Mounir Obbadi appeared to receive his marching orders for a foul on Fabinho with a quarter of an hour left, but the referee changed his mind after consulting the linesman and booked Boufal instead. From the resulting free kick, Ricardo Cavalho rose smartly to flick on a header which Eyneama had to be at full stretch to save."

In addition, this week has seen them agree a deal to bring long-time target Angel di Maria to Paris from Manchester United -- the 27-year-old Argentina winger will be unveiled on Thursday after he passed a medical and the clubs agreed a fee of 63 million euros (£44m, $68.9m). Di Maria, who had a long summer break after helping Argentina to the Copa America final, will have to wait to make his debut and the game at the Stade Pierre-Mauroy will also go ahead without Zlatan Ibrahimovic. The Swede, beginning the final season of his contract at PSG, is sidelined after hurting his right knee against Lyon, so Javier Pastore could start for the visitors. Otherwise, coach Laurent Blanc is likely to stick with the same team that outclassed Lyon, meaning German goalkeeper Kevin Trapp, a new recruit from Eintracht Frankfurt, will again start and Ivorian powerhouse Serge Aurier should get the nod after an outstanding display last week. ""He has had a great pre-season, he is full of motivation and has learned from last season, which was chaotic with all his injuries,"" said Blanc of the defender. For Lille, it is the start of a new era after Renard -- who coached Aurier and the Ivory Coast to Africa Cup of Nations glory in February - was appointed to succeed Rene Girard in the dugout. It has been a trying summer for Renard with defender Simon Kjaer, midfielder Idrissa Gueye and forward Nolan Roux all leaving the club and Lille losing out to Aston Villa in their attempts to sign Lorient's Jordan Ayew, but the 46-year-old is looking forward to the game. ""It is a great occasion to open the season. Is it a good thing to host PSG so early? I can't answer that,"" he said. ""With PSG you never know, if their machine is well-oiled or they are on top form it becomes more and more difficult. But the important thing for us is to focus on ourselves and be ready to play well and make as few mistakes as possible."" Fresh from beating Swiss side Young Boys 7-1 on aggregate in the Champions League third qualifying round, Monaco make the short trip to Nice for a Cote d'Azur derby. The principality club, who finished third last season largely thanks to their watertight defence, have sold Geoffrey Kondogbia and Yannick Ferreira Carrasco to Inter Milan and Atletico Madrid this summer but have reinvested much of the money raised into improving their attack. The early signs are good, with new boys Guido Carrillo, Ivan Cavaleiro and Stephan El Shaaraway all scoring against Young Boys. ""The objective is the podium. Paris are a long way ahead of everyone else. But there's no reason why we can't try to finish second,"" said the Moroccan Nabil Dirar. ""We are better than at the same stage last year. And the team is progressing. August will be very important."" Elsewhere on Saturday, a new-look Marseille entertain Caen after a summer which has seen Andre-Pierre Gignac, Dimitri Payet, Andre Ayew, Giannelli Imbula, Jeremy Morel and Rod Fanni all leave the Stade Velodrome. A host of new faces have come in, including injury-prone former Arsenal midfielder Abou Diaby, for whom this match will come too soon.

""This is very good news for me to join a club like Lille. I have known Herve Renard for a long time, his presence here was an important element in making my decision to commit myself to Lille. He is like a father to me,"" added Sunzu. The 26-year-old was snapped up by Sochaux in January 2014, with Renard in charge, but Sunzu opted for a move to Shanghai after just one year.

His arrival may be in part to offset the likely departure of club captain Fabian Delph to Manchester City, this despite the former Leeds midfielder having signed a new four-and-a-half year contract contract with Villa in January and declared then 'there was no way I'm going to bail out, this is my club'. Aston Villa manager Tim Sherwood claimed he had beaten several rivals to secure Gueye's signature. ""He's been one of the best young midfielders in France for the last few seasons. A lot of clubs were trying to sign him,"" said Sherwood. ""I believe we are signing a player who is hungry to succeed, is entering what should be his best years and is perfectly suited to the Premier League."" Gueye, who played 134 times for Lille since joining them in 2010, joins winger Scott Sinclair and defender Micah Richard as new signings, the latter two having arrived from Manchester City. Sherwood will be looking to them to help Villa avoid another relegation battle -- they finished only three points above the drop last term."

He will become the first signing made by Lille since they appointed the Ivory Coast's Africa Cup of Nations-winning coach Herve Renard as their new boss."
63,15/06/2015,13:48,Lille forced to pay compensation over Origi transfer,"French side Lille must pay compensation of 300,000 euros ($336,000, 217,000 pounds) to Belgian club Genk in relation to the signing of Divock Origi, the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) ruled on Monday.","The decision made at CAS' headquarters in Lausanne, Switzerland, overrules a previous verdict by football's governing body FIFA in February 2014 which refused Genk's demands for compensation. Belgian international Origi -- now on Liverpool's books -- was trained by Genk before leaving at the age of 15 to sign a professional contract with Ligue 1 outfit Lille. FIFA's dispute resolution chamber originally denied Genk a ""training compensation"" fee as they had not offered a contract to Origi -- now aged 20 -- before he left for northern France. But Genk successfully argued to CAS that they couldn't offer Origi a contract at the time as Belgian law prohibits the employment of minors under the age of 16 as paid athletes. Origi, who was part of Belgium's World Cup squad in Brazil last summer, joined Liverpool for £10 million (13.8m euros) after the tournament and was loaned back to the French club last season."
64,25/05/2015,17:26,African champion Renard named as Lille coach,Lille on Monday named two-time African Cup of Nations-winning coach Herve Renard to replace Rene Girard as manager of the French Ligue 1 club on a three-year deal.,"Renard, 46, led Ivory Coast to Africa's showpiece football title in February 2015 and three years previously also famously guided Zambia to the same crown. ""It's an honour to come to a club as prestigious as Lille,"" said Renard, whose contract with the Ivory Coast officially terminated on Friday. ""I said to myself after the Cup of Nations success it would be hard to do better and I would need other challenges,"" added Renard. ""A very exciting challenge is on the horizon and I'm counting on rising to it with ambition."" Renard also coached then-Ligue 1 club Sochaux during the 2013-2014 season, battling unsuccessfully in their bid to avoid relegation to Ligue 2. Lille last week revealed it would be parting ways with Girard. The northern France club, who notably suffered a 6-1 rout away at champions Paris Saint-Germain last month, finished the season in eighth spot in Ligue 1. It means the club will miss out on European football next season, Girard having led them to a third-placed finish last season. Renard will be joined by his current assistant Patrice Beaumelle in Lille on a deal which runs until 2018, the club said. Lille president Michel Seydoux said club officials had been ""won over ... by how his ideas fit in with Lille's plans, along with his desire to join us to write another page in our history"". The club previously approached Renard last December when they were struggling with 13 matches without a win. Renard has already started work on his new team requesting that captain Rio Mavuba's contract be extended."
65,19/04/2015,16:10,Lille keep European hopes alive with Bordeaux win,Nolan Roux was on target as Lille grabbed their third consecutive Ligue 1 victory with a 2-0 win over Bordeaux on Sunday to close on European places.,"The 27-year-old forward headed in his fifth goal of the season, benefiting from an incisive run by Sofiane Boufal and a defensive mistake by Mariano after just 13 minutes of play. Boufal was once again key in the dying minutes of the game, the young midfielder picking off Bordeaux on the break and playing in Adama Traore to calmly slot home. It was Bordeaux's second league defeat since January 16, a 12-game run that includes triumphs over PSG and Marseille. In-form Lille leapfrog Montpellier into seventh place, just four points behind Bordeaux and six behind Saint-Etienne, who currently occupy the fifth and final European football spot on offer to French clubs. On Saturday, Paris Saint-Germain bounced back from their Champions League humbling against Barcelona by beating Nice 3-1 in their bid for a hat-trick of Ligue 1 titles. PSG temporarily moved a point ahead Lyon at the top of the table ahead of Sunday's derby against Saint-Etienne. Monaco remain in third place as they refocus on overturning a 1-0 first-leg deficit at home to Juventus in the second leg of their Champions League quarter-final in midweek. But crucially, they failed to fully exploit fourth-placed Marseille's continued slump as Marcelo Bielsa's side went down to a 1-0 defeat at Nantes on Friday night."
66,28/02/2015,19:09,Lille stun Lyon and give PSG massive boost,"Ligue 1 leaders Lyon suffered their first defeat in 12 matches on Saturday, going down 2-1 at Lille to leave second-placed Paris Saint-Germain trailing by just two points with a game in hand.","Hubert Fournier's side broke the deadlock after just three minutes when Corentin Tolisso converted a Nabil Fekir corner. However, Idrissa Gueye clawed back an equaliser in the second half after a clever one-two with Rony Lopes. And four minutes later, right on the hour mark, Manchester City loanee Lopes completed the turnaround with a nice strike from outside the box. ""A game is 90 minutes long. We can have regrets though, especially after our quality first half,"" coach Fournier said. ""We could have been more ambitious instead of sitting back. ""It's a big blow and I am angry because we missed a great opportunity. Every time we have the chance to widen the gap between us and the teams below us in the table, we slip up. I just hope we won't regret it in the coming weeks."" Tolisso's chance was Lyon's first attempt on target but it seemed to force the Ligue 1 leaders into a coma. The young midfielder netted his fifth of the season when he fired low past Vincent Enyeama following Fekir's corner, but the Nigerian goalkeeper was never really troubled after that. Meanwhile, LOSC never seemed able to trouble the leaders themselves in the first half as they looked to improve on a run of just one win in their last six league outings. However, the second half saw a complete turnaround with Gueye sparking the hosts into life by stabbing the ball past Anthony Lopes in the Lyon goal after a quick one-two with Rony Lopes inside the area. The Lyon 'keeper was once again beaten soon after when his fellow countryman curled a superb shot low into the net from just outside the area. Henri Bedimo and Christophe Jallet were both denied by Enyeama in the latter stages as Lyon pushed forward in search of an equaliser. Their defeat gives Paris the chance to climb above OL into top spot if they can win at in-form Monaco on Sunday night. OL remain four points ahead of third-placed Marseille, who suffered a shock 3-2 defeat at home to Caen on Friday after leading 2-0. Meanwhile, Lille move provisionally up to eighth before the rest of the weekend's games."
67,02/02/2015,14:15,Lille recall hot-shot Mali striker Diaby,"Lille have called back the Mali striker Abdoulay Diaby from a loan with Belgians Mouscron and offered the 23-year-old a deal that runs to June 2019, the French club said on Monday.","Diaby has been on a hot run of form scoring 12 goals in 20 games for Mouscron in the Belgian top flight this season, and was top of the scorers rankings before joining Mali's African Cup of Nations campaign in Equatorial Guinea. Lille by contrast are the lowest scoring team in France's top flight on 18 goals scored form 23 league games, as regular striker Belgian World Cup star Divock Origi has bagged just three goals so far this season. Lille, who own a majority shareholding in Mouscron, made the Champions League qualifying round after finishing third in France last season, but have slumped to a current lowly 13th. It was also announced by Lille that another striker on their books, the 25-year-old Ronny Rodelin, who has failed to score in 15 league games this season, would be joining Mouscron on loan."
68,01/02/2015,14:37,Palace move for Senegal defender Souare,Crystal Palace announced via their website on Sunday that they have signed Senegal left-back Pape Souare from French side Lille on a three-and-a-half-year contract for an undisclosed fee.,"The 24-year-old graduated from Lille's youth academy and represented Senegal at the Africa Cup of Nations in Equatorial Guinea. His arrival is contingent on the granting of a work permit. Souare becomes Palace's fourth signing of the January transfer window after midfielder Jordon Mutch, former Newcastle United striker Shola Ameobi and striker Yaya Sanogo, who has joined on loan from Arsenal. Alan Pardew's Palace are in 13th place in the Premier League table, four points above the relegation zone, after losing 1-0 at home to Everton on Saturday."

Players of both teams on Wednesday wore black armbands. ""Following the horror of the gun attack at Charlie Hebdo, Michel Seydoux (Lille president) and Lille football club express their fright and deep sadness,"" read a club statement. Lille midfielder and captain Rio Mavuba tweeted: ""Where is the world going? A thought for the victims and their loved ones."" Twelve people, including two policemen, were shot dead by heavily armed gunmen at the offices of the satirical weekly magazine Charlie Hebdo in central Paris on Wednesday morning. Three men are being hunted after they stormed the paper's offices shouting Islamist slogans with witnesses hearing the attackers shout ""we have avenged the prophet"" and ""Allahu akbar"" (God is greatest). Four people remain critically injured and the capital placed under the highest alert status following the attack, the country's deadliest in decades."
70,03/01/2015,22:51,Lille out of French Cup at first hurdle,Lille suffered more disappointment in a frustrating season on Saturday as they were knocked out of the French Cup at the first hurdle by Ligue 1 rivals Bastia.,"A first-half brace by Floyd Ayite gave the hosts a 2-0 victory in Corsica and sent Lille, already eliminated from Europe and languishing in the bottom half in the league, packing. Rene Girard's side were not the only top-flight team to be knocked out in the round of 64 on Saturday, with Nice being beaten 2-0 at Ligue 2 Valenciennes on the day they announced an agreement to sign France winger Hatem Ben Arfa. Meanwhile, Lorient were beaten 1-0 away at third-tier side Avranches in Normandy, but Evian, Reims and Nantes all won against opponents from the sixth tier. Nantes emerged 4-0 winners at home against Club Franciscain, who were attempting to become the first side from the French Caribbean island of Martinique to reach the last 32. Ligue 1 leaders Marseille go to fourth-tier Grenoble on Sunday night, while Lyon are at Lens, Monaco go to Ligue 2 Nimes and holders Guingamp take on Brittany neighbours Dinan-Lehon. Paris Saint-Germain are in action on Monday away to Montpellier, who won 2-1 when the teams met at the Parc des Princes in the last 32 a year ago."
71,21/12/2014,16:14,Batshuyai ensures Marseille finish year top of the table,Belgian striker Michy Batshuyai repaid Marseille coach Marcelo Bielsa's faith in giving him his first start by scoring the decider in the 2-1 win over Lille on Sunday to guarantee they top the table going into the New Year.,"Marseille, who last won the title in 2010 when coached by Didier Deschamps, lead defending champions Paris Saint Germain -- who drew 0-0 with Montpellier on Saturday -- and five ahead of Lyon, who play Bordeaux later on Sunday. Batshuyai -- who had had to bide his time to get a start since signing from Standard Liege in the close season -- had got the nod when Bielsa according to media reports told regular starter Dimitri Payet he could go on holiday as he would not be playing after failing to impress in training this week. The Belgian Under-21 international did not let the mercurial Argentinian coach down even though it was in front of a record Velodrome attendance of 62,048 spectators. Andre-Pierre Gignac had a superb chance in the 12th minute as a weak defensive header fell to him inside the penalty area but he sent his shot well wide of the post. Batshuyai went close to breaking the deadlock in the 27th minute as he created space for himself and unleashed a fine curling effort that went just wide of the post. The hosts went 1-0 up in the 32nd minute in the most unfortunate circumstances for Lille as Nolan Roux tried to put out a poor corner by Florian Thauvin but it flashed off his boot and beat Enyeama at the near post. Marseille had other chances including one for Andre Ayew, but the Ghanaian star's shot was cleared off the line by Simon Kjaer. Lille were fortunate not be reduced to 10 men 10 minutes into the second-half as Idrissa Gueye flashed out his arm and caught Mario Lemina full in the face but despite a harsh talking to by the referee he didn't receive even a booking. He made the most of his good fortune by levelling in the 61st minute, his shot from the edge of the area taking a deflection before rolling past Steve Mandanda. However, the hosts sent the massed ranks of Marseille fans -- many in Santa Claus hats -- into ecstasy in the 69th minute as Batshuyai turned his marker and let fly with a super right-footed effort that gave Enyeama no chance. Marseille were regiswtering their ninth successive home win."
72,19/12/2014,17:54,Origi set to leave Lille for Liverpool in January,"Belgian forward Divock Origi will cut short a season-long loan at Lille in January to return to parent club Liverpool, who will pay six million euros ($7.3m, £4.7m) for the privilege, according to a source close to the deal.","The 19-year-old, who was bought by Liverpool from Lille in the summer for a reported £10 million after impressing for Belgium at the World Cup, was immediately loaned back to the Ligue 1 side for the duration of this season. However, the loan agreement included a clause allowing Liverpool to take Origi back in the January transfer window for six million euros if they needed attacking reinforcements. And with Mario Balotelli struggling to make an impact at the Anfield club and Brendan Rodgers's side enduring a difficult campaign, it now appears that they will move to boost their attack in January. Lille coach Rene Girard had on several occasions denied reports that Origi was on his way out of the club despite rumours to the contrary, but the French side could not refuse such an offer as they are currently struggling financially. Origi was a surprise call-up to the Belgium squad for the World Cup and shone on their run to the quarter-finals in Brazil. However, he has scored only four goals in all competitions this season, two from penalties."
73,03/12/2014,22:58,PSG held by Lille after Sirigu own goal,An own goal by Paris Saint-Germain keeper Salvatore Sirigu held the French champions to a 1-1 draw at Lille on Wednesday in a stalemate that kept Marseille atop Ligue 1 by a single point.,"Edinson Cavani put PSG, who were without star striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic, into a 29th minute lead, after good work from Ezequiel Lavezzi down the right. That left Laurent Blanc's unbeaten side provisionally overtaking Marseille, who were held by the same scoreline by Lorient 24 hours earlier. But in the 42nd minute Lille were back level after Sirigu's attempt to punch away a corner did not have the desired effect as the ball hit the bar and went into his net. The match was at Lille's Metropole stadium which staged last month's Davis Cup tennis final. Earlier, Saint Etienne climbed into third on the back of a 2-0 win at Montpellier with the first half goals scored by defenders Florentin Pogba and Paul Baysse. ""It's a good week so far,"" said Saint-Etienne coach Christophe Galtier ahead of the upcoming derby with Lyon. ""I don't know how far back we'd need to go to have 29 points after 16 games."" In Corsica, Bastia fans took direct action to show their displeasure after the club's 2-1 home loss to Evian, with a group of around 50 supporters blocking the players and officials' exit. This eighth loss of the season left them propping up the table on goal difference with 14 points. On Tuesday, Lorient's Ghana international Jordan Ayew scored a penalty to cancel out Dimitri Payet's opener and salvage a 1-1 draw against his former club Marseille. Toulouse saw off hosts Nantes 2-1, while Dimitar Berbatov was on the scoresheet as Monaco shrugged off being reduced to 10 men to beat Lens 2-0."
74,23/10/2014,21:20,Everton held by Lille but remain top in Europa League,Everton retained top spot in Group F on Thursday as they battled to a 0-0 draw at Lille in Europa League action following a day of trouble and fighting in the city centre between fans and police ahead of the tie.,"The Merseysiders, who last won their only continental trophy in 1985 when they lifted the now defunct Cup Winners' Cup, enjoyed the lion's share of possession but lacked a cutting edge up front as Nigerian number one Vincent Enyeama kept the visitors at bay. The stalemate lifts Roberto Martinez's team up to five points from three matches with Germany's Wolfsburg alone in second on four after they defeated Krasnodar 4-2 in Russia. ""I knew it would be a tough game against a good Lille side but I was a bit disappointed with the pitch,"" said Martinez. ""People might not have been able to see on television but the pitch was very difficult and we couldn't get on the ball as much as we'd have liked,"" added the Spaniard. ""It's another very good away performance and a good away point so I'm happy with the result."" Earlier in the day and the night before the match, fans from both sides were involved in a series of street battles as police were forced to step in with tear gas. There were a handful of minor injuries. Lille remain third after three straight draws with Krasnodar dropping to the bottom on two. It was Wolfsburg's first win of the campaign after a draw and a defeat in their earlier two outings. An own-goal from Swedish defender Andreas Granqvist after 37 minutes handed the 2009 German champions the initiative before former Chelsea midfielder Kevin de Bruyne doubled their lead just after half-time. Granqvist helped repair his earlier blunder when he converted from the penalty spot five minutes later but Luiz Gustavo restored Wolfsburg's two goal advantage with a 64th minute strike. Belgian international De Bruyne grabbed his second of the match with 10 minutes left as Wolfsburg gave themselves a cushion before Brazilian Wanderson closed out the scoring with a late consolation goal. In Group J, northern Danish side Aalborg shook up the pool as they defeated previously unbeaten Dynamo Kiev of Ukraine 2-0 while Romanian hopefuls Steaua Bucharest hung on to defeat Rio Ave of Portugal 2-1. Thomas Enovoldsen put the Danes in front after just 11 minutes before Nicolaj Thomsen wrapped up the points just before half-time. Croatian outfit Rijeka were too strong for former Dutch champions Feyenoord in Group G as they dragged themselves back into contention with a 3-1 home win. All the goals came in the last 27 minutes as Rijeka climbed into second spot on four points alongside Standard Liege with defending champions Sevilla top of the pile on five after a 0-0 draw in Belgium. In Switzerland, Young Boys stunned former UEFA Cup winners Napoli 2-0 thanks to goals from former Paris Saint-Germain striker Guillaume Hoarau and Leonardo Bertone. The win takes Young Boys top of Group I on goal difference ahead of Napoli while Sparta Prague can draw level on six points with a win at Slovan Bratislava in a match yet to be completed following crowd trouble in Slovakia. Fiorentina are in full command of Group K as they made it three wins from three with a 1-0 success in Greece at PAOK, who remain on three points and in third spot. French side Guingamp are alone in second on four points after holding Dinamo Minsk 0-0 as the Belarus club picked up their first point. Twelve matches are slated for later on Thursday with Ligue 1 club Saint-Etienne taking some 10,000 supporters to Inter Milan, Tottenham at home to Greek side Asteras Tripolis and Scottish champions Celtic at home to Astra Giurgiu of Romania."
75,23/10/2014,17:06,French police fight Everton fans,"French police fired tear gas at Everton fans Thursday amid rising tensions ahead of the English side's Europa League game against Lille, officials said.","Police also fired tear gas on Wednesday night to clear the English supporters after masked French fans attacked a group from Everton in a city bar. At least one English fan was injured, the prefecture in Lille said. Everton said in a statement on its website that it had heard of two fans with slight injuries. Everton also advised fans to stay away from Lille's main square where the latest troubles erupted. Hundreds of English fans gathered in bars and cafes in the centre of the northern French city where many stores closed fearing trouble. French officials said the trouble started when a British police officer spotted one Everton fan who is a known hooligan and another man with a record for dealing drugs. French police wanted to arrest the two but were threatened by English supporters and took refuge in a book store. Riot police then fired tear gas and some English fans hurled beer cans and other projectiles. The atmosphere calmed when police withdrew. Everton fans complained about police action on Wednesday night when more than 40 masked Lille fans attacked a bar where Everton supporters had gathered. The French supporters fled and the riot squad used tear gas to disperse about 100 English fans who also rushed to the scene, prefecture officials said. More than 800 police are on duty for the match in Group H of the Europa League."
76,24/09/2014,21:22,Lille slump to first defeat of season,"Lille slumped to their first Ligue 1 defeat of the season on Wednesday, shattering their hopes of moving into second place in the table behind leaders Marseille.","It was Lille's first away defeat since February when Nice also got the better of them, also by a single goal. On Wednesday, it was their former player Mathieu Bodmer who secured Nice's third home win of the season with a 41st minute header from a corner. Lille remain fourth in the table, four points off the lead, but they can be overtaken later in the evening when champions Paris Saint Germain go to Caen. Lyon, the seven-time champions, were the night's biggest winners with a 4-0 home win against Lorient. Nabil Fekir scored twice with Alexandre Lacazette and 21-year-old Clinton N'Jie also on target. Highly-rated Cameroon star N'Jie had earlier signed a new five-year deal with Hubert Fournier's side and marked the occasion in style with his first goal for the club. Monaco, last season's runners-up, recorded their third win in three games to shake off their early season slump which had seen them slip to bottom place. After a Champions League win over Leverkusen and a 1-0 win against Guingamp, Monaco needed a stoppage time winner from substitute Valere Germain to beat Montpellier. Monaco are now comfortably in mid-table with 10 points from seven games. On Tuesday, Marseille picked up their fifth straight victory as top scorer Andre-Pierre Gignac claimed a brace in a 5-0 thrashing of Reims. Gignac could even afford the luxury of a missed eighth-minute penalty, before scoring two first-half goals while Ghana international Andre Ayew also struck twice at the Stade Auguste Delaune. The win took Marcelo Bielsa's side three points clear at the top of the French table ahead of Saint-Etienne and Bordeaux who meet on Thursday. ""It's very satisfying to get five wins in a row and we did it in style as well,"" said Gignac, who also scored twice in the 3-0 win over Rennes at the weekend. ""Obviously it's been a good day and now we can look forward to a big match against Saint-Etienne on Sunday."""

Mavuba, a member of the France team that took part in the World Cup in Brazil, will miss at least three Ligue 1 matches, against Nice, Bastia and Lyon, as well as a Europa League game against Wolfsburg. Mavuba will also be unavailable for France's two next matches, home against Portugal on October 11 and away to Armenia three days later."

79,14/09/2014,19:16,Bordeaux defeat allows Lille to go top,"Bordeaux suffered their first defeat of the new Ligue 1 season at Guingamp on Sunday to lose top spot in the table to Lille, who beat Nantes earlier in the day.","First-half goals from Moustapha Diallo and Christophe Mandanne, the latter from a penalty, condemned Willy Sagnol's Bordeaux to a 2-1 defeat, with a late Cheick Diabate strike proving to be a mere consolation for the visitors in Brittany. Lille had gone clear at the summit earlier in the day thanks to a 2-0 victory against Nantes in the far north, with Divock Origi scoring one goal and then setting up another for Portuguese youngster Rony Lopes. Rene Girard's side, who will face the Russians of FC Krasnodar in the Europa League on Thursday, are a point ahead of both Bordeaux and Saint-Etienne, with champions Paris Saint-Germain a further point adrift in fourth. Diallo headed home a free-kick from on-loan Newcastle United midfielder Sylvain Marveaux to put Guingamp ahead after 26 minutes, and Mandanne netted from the spot eight minutes later after Gregory Sertic had brought down Jeremy Pied inside the box. French Cup holders Guingamp, who go to Fiorentina in the Europa League on Thursday, then held on after giant Malian Diabate had reduced the arrears in the 83rd minute, sweeping home first-time from a Thomas Toure cutback. Lille continued their unbeaten start to the season as two goals in the first four minutes of the second period did for Nantes at the Stade Pierre-Mauroy. After a goalless first half in which Jordan Veretout hit the post for the visitors, Origi opened the scoring within a minute of the restart, heading home a cross from Florent Balmont. Three minutes later, the Belgian international, who was bought by Liverpool in the summer before being loaned back to LOSC, provided the pass for Lopes to apply the finish. It was a first goal for the Portuguese midfielder since he moved to Lille on loan from Manchester City in the summer transfer window. Marseille visit Evian in the day's late kick-off, while Saint-Etienne beat Caen 1-0 on Saturday as champions Paris drew 1-1 at Rennes, despite Zoumana Camara giving them a first-half lead."

McGregor, enjoying a fine start to his debut season with the Glasgow giants, pounced on a rebound after Jo Inge Berget was initially denied by Maribor goalkeeper Jasmin Handanovic to fire home his fourth goal in seven matches. However, Ronny Deila's men were pegged back just before the quarter-hour as Zeljko Filipovic thread the ball through to Damjan Bohar who held his composure to calmly steer beyond Celtic 'keeper Craig Gordon. Filipovic then came to his side's rescue to clear Charlie Mulgrew's header off the line before Celtic midfielder Stefan Johansen unwittingly got in the way of team-mate Virgil Van Dijk's goalbound effort. Maribor, whose lone appearance in the Champions League group stage came 15 years ago, kept Gordon on his toes with a pair of long-range attempts with Celtic proving far more resolute defensively than they were in the previous round against Legia. Johansen squandered a golden chance to put the Scottish champions in the driving seat midway through the second half as he lost his balance having escaped clear of the Maribor defence but Celtic will remain confident of completing the job in Tuesday's return leg at Parkhead. ""I think we were closer to winning the game than they were,"" Celtic boss Deila told SkySports afterwards. ""The performance was good, I'm pleased and it's going to be very exciting to play them at Celtic Park next week."" Two-time former European champions Porto will take a 1-0 advantage into next week's second leg against Lille in Portugal. Mexico international Hector Herrera popped up with the game's lone goal on 61 minutes at the Stade Pierre-Mauroy to leave Porto on the cusp of a fourth straight group stage appearance. Oleg Shatov's 16th-minute strike put Zenit St Petersburg in control of their tie as Andre Villas-Boas' men secured a 1-0 win at Belgium's Standard Liege. Slovan Bratislava striker Robert Vittek equalised 10 minutes from time in a 1-1 draw at home to Belarusian outfit BATE Borisov to leave the Slovak title-holders in with a fighting chance of the reaching the group stage for the first time. APOEL Nicosia, surprise quarter-finalists in the 2011-12 competition, secured a vital away goal courtesy of Brazilian midfielder Vinicius as the Cypriot champions recovered to earn a 1-1 draw at Danish side Aalborg."
81,15/08/2014,23:13,Controversial penalty hands Lille victory,"A highly contentious penalty award allowed Lille to claim their first win of the Ligue 1 season on Friday, Divock Origi's spot-kick sealing a 1-0 victory against newly-promoted Caen.","Rene Girard's side finished third last season to qualify for the Champions League, their success based first and foremost on a watertight defence. And they have yet to concede a goal in the new Ligue 1 campaign, following up a 0-0 draw at home to Metz on the opening day by edging out another of the division's new boys to set themselves up for next Wednesday's Champions League play-off first leg at home to Portuguese giants FC Porto. The game, played 160 kilometres away from Caen in Le Mans because the Normandy side's own stadium is being used for the World Equestrian Games, appeared to be heading for a stalemate until referee Sebastien Desiage's decision to award a penalty in the 69th minute. Origi saw his charge towards goal ended by a superbly-timed challenge from Dennis Appiah just inside the box, but Caen were stunned to see the referee point to the spot and show a straight red card to the unfortunate defender. There was no appeal from young Belgian forward Origi, who was signed by Liverpool last month and then loaned back to Lille for the season after impressing at the World Cup. However, he got up to score from 12 yards, and Lille held on as Rio Mavuba cleared a last-minute Fode Koita header off the line. That made it a frustrating evening for Caen, who marked their return to Ligue 1 after a two-year absence by beating Evian 3-0 last weekend but lost influential striker Mathieu Duhamel to an ankle injury early in the second half on Friday. ""It was not a good match. We didn't deserve to lose but we didn't deserve to win either,"" Girard told beIN Sports. ""We didn't take much pleasure from this game but I'm not worried. We had a difficult start to last season as well. There is work to be done but now we have a very important match on Wednesday.""

However, any hopes of a remarkable turnaround were effectively extinguised when Daniel Pavlovic was dismissed with 20 minutes left for a poor challenge on Sebastien Corchia as Lille ultimately advanced 3-1 on aggregate.
