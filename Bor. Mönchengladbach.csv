0,08/02/2021,20:23,Gladbach v Man City Champions League match moved to Budapest,"Manchester City's first leg of their Champions League last-16 tie against Borussia Moenchengladbach will be played in Budapest due to strict coronavirus entry rules imposed by Germany, UEFA announced Monday.","The switch of venue comes 24 hours after Liverpool's match against Leipzig next week was also relocated to Budapest for the same reason. Pep Guardiola's City will play Gladbach at the Puskas Arena on February 24. ""We have to presume that the travel ban for passengers from the UK to Germany, which is currently in place until 17th February, will be extended and that the Manchester City team will not be granted special permission to travel to Moenchengladbach,"" said Borussia CEO Stephan Schippers. ""We have come to this decision based on several conversations with the relevant authorities, politicians, the DFL and UEFA over the past week."" UEFA's regulations stipulate the home side must find a way of hosting the match or risk forfeiting it as a 3-0 defeat. Introduced late last month the new German rules, slated to last until at least February 17, ban travellers from countries hit by new, more contagious Covid-19 variants such as the one found in Britain. Though there are some exceptions for medical workers and others in key professions the new protocol contains no special provision for professional sportspeople. ""UEFA's regulations state that as the home side we are required to find an alternative venue. For several reasons, we have decided to play the game at the Puskas Arena in Budapest,"" said Schippers. ""We would like to thank UEFA and the Hungarian FA for their support regarding this matter. ""A last-16 Champions League tie is a huge event for Borussia Moenchengladbach, which we now cannot play in our own ground or with any fans in attendance. Nevertheless, we're pleased that we can play the game at all and we are conscious of the overall situation."""
1,07/02/2021,22:26,Leipzig face in-form Wolfsburg in Cup quarters,"RB Leipzig will face Wolfsburg in the quarter-finals of the German Cup after Sunday's draw, while Borussia Moenchengladbach will host Borussia Dortmund in the other all-Bundesliga tie.","Leipzig are second in Germany's top division while Wolfsburg are third and on a run of five straight wins in league and cup. The other top flight side left in the competition, Werder Bremen, will travel to second-tier Jahn Regensburg as clubs eye a cup that looks much more winnable with Bayern Munich out of the way. Bayern's conquerers at the last-32 stage Holstein Kiel have been rewarded for their penalty shootout win over Darmstadt in the last 16 with a trip to Rot-Weiss Essen, who play in the fourth division. Essen will likely be no pushover however after having knocked out Bayer Leverkusen, Arminia Bielefeld and second division team Fortuna Duesseldorf in previous rounds. Quarter-final draw, matches to be played March 2 and 3: RB Leipzig v Wolfsburg Borussia Moenchengladbach v Borussia Dortmund Jahn Regensburg v Werder Bremen Rot-Weiss Essen v Holstein Kiel"
2,22/01/2021,22:43,Gladbach end losing streak against Dortmund to climb to fourth,Defender Nico Elvedi netted twice as Moenchengladbach ended their six-year wait to beat Dortmund when their 4-2 home win on Friday lifted the Foals to fourth in the Bundesliga table.,"Two goals by Dortmund striker Erling Braut Haaland were bookended by Elvedi netting from set-pieces in the action-packed opening 32 minutes. Algeria left-back Ramy Bensebaini restored Gladbach's lead early in the second half before substitute Marcus Thuram headed the hosts' fourth. After home wins over league leaders Bayern and second-placed RB Leipzig already this season, Gladbach claimed another big-name Bundesliga scalp. It was also a significant win for their coach Marco Rose, who the German media are tipping to replace caretaker boss Edin Terzic at Dortmund next season. After 12 straight defeats to Dortmund, Gladbach earned their first win over the Black-and-Yellows since April 2016. Since their impressive 3-1 win at RB Leipzig at the start January, Dortmund drop to fifth after failing to win their last three games. In the other direction, Gladbach are up to fourth after taking 13 points from a possible 15 in 2021. They are eight points behind leaders Bayern, who are at bottom side Schalke on Sunday. Breel Embolo came on for Gladbach in the second-half despite police claims, which the Swiss striker denies, that he attended a party in Essen last Saturday that broke Germany's lockdown rules. Dortmund made a lethargic start at Borussia Park and a Gladbach goal inside the opening 60 seconds was ruled out after a lengthy VAR review. However, the hosts took the lead with 11 minutes gone when Lars Stindl's curling free-kick dropped in behind the defence to be headed home by Elvedi. Dortmund roared back with two goals inside six minutes, both created by Sancho for Haaland, who fired home his first from a tight angle on 22 minutes. After Jude Bellingham won the ball back for Dortmund, great footwork by Sancho then again unpicked Gladbach's defence for Haaland to blast his side 2-1 ahead on 28 minutes. However, another Stindl free-kick on 32 minutes could only be parried by Roman Buerki and Elvedi tapped home the rebound from close range to make it 2-2 at the break. Gladbach regained the lead five minutes into the second-half when Bensebaini swung in a shot which curled outside Buerki's grasp. Dortmund conceded their third goal of the night from a set-piece when Thuram headed home a Florian Neuhaus corner 11 minutes from the whistle. It was the France forward's first appearance after suspension for a spitting at an opponent last month."
3,11/01/2021,12:35,"Messi on form, a new American star and Bayern beaten: Talking points from around Europe","Lionel Messi is bang in form in the new year, Schalke avoided matching the Bundesliga record for the most consecutive games without a win and there was a very rare defeat for Bayern Munich.","AFP Sport rounds up some of the main talking points from across the continent: Lionel Messi looks like a man on a mission at the start of 2021 and what could be his final six months as a Barcelona player. On Saturday he scored twice -- including direct from a free-kick, one of his late-career specialities -- in a 4-0 win at Granada. That followed a masterful double and two shots off the post in a 3-2 midweek victory at Athletic Bilbao. Before that he provided the assist for Frenkie de Jong's winner at Huesca, and Barcelona have won three out of three since the turn of the year, while Messi is now La Liga's top scorer. Maybe it's not too late for Ronald Koeman's side to challenge for the title: they are third, four points behind leaders Atletico Madrid, albeit having played three games more. Matthew Hoppe is the latest young American to break through in the Bundesliga and he is already a hero for Schalke supporters. The California-born 19-year-old, who made his debut in November, had never scored a senior goal before netting a hat-trick -- the first ever for an American in the Bundesliga -- in the 4-0 defeat of Hoffenheim that rescued the Royal Blues from equalling an unwanted record. Their first win since January 17 last year, after 30 games without, prevented them from matching Tasmania Berlin's infamous German top-flight record of 31 games without a victory set in 1965/66. Hoppe has given hope to a whole club, and suddenly Schalke have new cause for optimism as they bid to beat the drop. They are off the bottom, above Mainz, but they remain in the relegation zone. Bayern Munich had begun to look a little less irresistible on a run of eight straight Bundesliga matches in which they had conceded the opening goal. But they had won five and drawn three of those matches. Then on Friday they were 2-0 up away to Borussia Moenchengladbach only to lose 3-2, just their second Bundesliga defeat since losing at the same ground in December 2019. It is a result that keeps the Bundesliga title race very much alive, although Hansi Flick's team have a winnable run of matches upcoming and they remain top, two points clear of RB Leipzig, who lost 3-1 at home to Borussia Dortmund, for whom Erling Braut Haaland scored twice. Third-placed Bayer Leverkusen are four points off the top after drawing 1-1 with Werder Bremen. Three days after a 3-1 home loss to reigning champions Juventus which ended a 27-game unbeaten run in Serie A stretching back to June, AC Milan bounced back to beat Torino 2-0 at San Siro. With second-placed city rivals Inter drawing at Roma, Milan are now three points clear at the top of the table, and remain seven ahead of Juventus, who are fourth but do have a game in hand. Added good news for Milan came with the return of veteran top scorer Zlatan Ibrahimovic as a late substitute for his first appearance since November 22 after injury. The Swede came on for Rafael Leao, who had earlier scored his third goal in five games. Can Zlatan now fire the Rossoneri to their first Scudetto since 2011? Mauricio Pochettino got his first victory as coach of Paris Saint-Germain, a 3-0 defeat of Brest, but it is Lyon who lead halfway through the Ligue 1 season. They claimed the symbolic title of autumn champions after coming back from 2-0 down to draw 2-2 at Rennes on Saturday with Memphis Depay scoring one fine goal before setting up Jason Denayer's equaliser. Rudi Garcia's team are unbeaten in 16 games although both PSG and Lille are just a point behind, and there is a very long way to go. Ensuring Depay stays to see out the remainder of his contract rather than leaving this month will be crucial."
4,08/01/2021,22:47,Bayern Munich squander two-goal lead to lose at Moenchengladbach,European champions Bayern Munich suffered only their second Bundesliga defeat of the season on Friday after throwing away a two-goal lead and crashing to a 3-2 loss at Borussia Moenchengladbach.,"The away defeat means second-placed RB Leipzig can wipe out Bayern's two-point lead and top the Bundesliga table if they beat Borussia Dortmund at home on Saturday. Bayern were cruising at 2-0 up after 26 minutes thanks to a Robert Lewandowski penalty and a superb Leon Goretzka goal at Borussia Park. However, Gladbach roared back as midfielder Jonas Hofmann scored twice to make it 2-2 at the break, then set up Florian Neuhaus who scored what proved to be the winner for the hosts just after the break. ""We're delighted, it was a hard fight. I don't think many people had thought we could do it, but we scored our first two goals exactly as planned,"" Hofmann told DAZN. ""We knew Bayern defend high. We made life hard for ourselves at the start, but it was great that we could take the lead straight after the break."" Bayern were punished for repeatedly losing the ball in their half as Gladbach took the chances which came their way. Bayern started brightly, ending their curious run of conceding the first goal in their previous eight league games when Neuhaus reached down and brushed the ball with the back of his hand on the edge of the area. After a long VAR review, the referee awarded a penalty and Lewandowski slotted home his 20th league goal this season. Bayern were 2-0 up when Goretzka superby won the ball back in Gladbach's half, traded passes with Leroy Sane and hit the net with a great finish. However, the scores were level at the break as the hosts fought back. In the pre-match build-up, Gladbach coach Marco Rose had highlighted Bayern's tendency to defend high up the pitch, which created space for opponents to attack, and his team ruthlessly exploited the weakness. A superb pass by Lars Stindl split the Bayern defence, Hofmann darted onto the ball and fired it past Manuel Neuer on 36 minutes. The second goal was almost identical. Stindl's long-range pass released Hofmann, who sprinted clear of Bayern's scrambling defence to again fire past Neuer just before half-time. Then when Niklas Suele gave away possession to Hofmann, the midfielder dribbled on the edge of the area and passed to Neuhaus, who made amends for the first-half penalty with a brilliant finish four minutes after the break. Gladbach defender Matthias Ginter was floored and needed medical treatment after blocking a Sane shot with his face. In a bid to raise the tempo, Bayern head coach Hansi Flick brought on Kingsley Coman, whose goal decided the Champions League final in August, for the final 22 minutes but to no avail as Gladbach held on."
5,08/01/2021,02:45,Dortmund hunt win at high-fliers Leipzig to rejoin title race,Borussia Dortmund are hunting a win at second-placed RB Leipzig on Saturday to get back in the Bundesliga title race while elsewhere two German league records could be equalled this weekend.,"At the top of the table, Bayern Munich coach Hansi Flick can claim 100 league points in his first 39 games if the league leaders win at Borussia Moenchengladbach on Friday. Pep Guardiola is the only other Bundesliga coach to have reached the milestone in the same number of games after taking charge of Bayern in 2013. At the other end of the table, bottom side Schalke could equal the league record of 31 games without victory if they lose or draw at home to Hoffenheim. In Saturday night's top match, Dortmund head to Leipzig in the ""role of the hunter"", according to sports director Michael Zorc, chasing an away win to trim the eight-point gap behind leaders Bayern. A late Jadon Sancho goal sealed their 2-0 win at home to Wolfsburg last Sunday, but Dortmund are fourth after defeats to Stuttgart and Union Berlin in December dented their title hopes. Dortmund must break their habit of conceding goals at set pieces which has drawn fierce internal criticism. ""Too often we haven't played grown-up football and our style was bound to see us drop points,"" Dortmund defender Mats Hummels fumed in Sport Bild, harsh criticism caretaker coach Edin Terzic regards as ""legitimate and productive"". Up front, Dortmund striker Erling Braut Haaland needs to finish his chances after the 20-year-old fired a blank last Sunday on his return after a hip injury. Haaland's 16-year-old understudy Youssoufa Moukoko is struggling with a knee injury. Dortmund have lost five of their 14 games this season and Terzic can ill-afford to lose at Leipzig, 10 days before facing third-placed Bayer Leverkusen. ""The whole of January will set the tone for the rest of the Bundesliga season,"" Terzic admits. Leipzig are on a nine-match unbeaten run in the Bundesliga, including a thrilling 3-3 draw at Bayern last month, and their defence has only conceded nine league goals all season. Their head coach Julian Nagelsmann is ""already planning"" the club's first win over Dortmund since 2017, ""because we're brave enough, in a very good mood"" and have home advantage. Nagelsmann is missing several players as Christopher Nkunku aggravated an ankle injury in training, while new signing Dominik Szoboszlai is struggling with a groin problem. The Liverpool loanee has scored five goals in his last seven league games which has helped Union Berlin climb to fifth ahead of Saturday's home game against Wolfsburg. With Germany striker Max Kruse recovering from a knee injury, burly 23-year-old Awoniyi spearheaded Union's attack by setting up team-mate Sheraldo Becker before tapping home to seal a 2-0 win at Werder Bremen last Saturday. The Nigerian international is making an impact at Union after seven loan moves in three different countries since joining Liverpool in 2015 after winning the African Under-20 Championships. 19 - the league goals scored by Bayern striker Robert Lewandowski, who netted twice against Mainz last Sunday. Haaland is his nearest rival on 10 goals. 97 - the league points Flick has accumulated as Bayern Munich head coach in his first 38 games with 31 wins, four draws and three defeats since taking charge in November 2019. 31 - Jadon Sancho's goal against Wolfsburg was his 31st in the Bundeliga. The England winger turns 21 in March and no-one else has scored so many German league goals at such a young age. Fixtures (all times 1430GMT unless stated)"
6,07/01/2021,16:29,Gnabry doubtful for Bayern as Flick looks to equal Guardiola's record,Germany winger Serge Gnabry remains doubtful for Bayern Munich ahead of Friday's Bundesliga clash at Borussia Moenchengladbach where head coach Hansi Flick can join Pep Guardiola as the quickest to claim 100 league points with the European champions.,"Gnabry took a painful blow to the shin in last Sunday's 5-2 win at home to Mainz when lethargic defending left Bayern two-goals down before roaring back for a win which kept them two points clear. Should Gnabry miss out, his place on the wing will go to Kingsley Coman, who is back after a thigh strain. Victory at Borussia Park would leave Flick on 100 points from 39 league matches, equalling Guardiola who became the first Bundesliga coach to reach the milestone with 101 points from his first 39 games in charge of Bayern. Of a bigger concern to Flick is Bayern's habit of conceding the opening goal in their last eight league games, fighting back each time for five wins and three draws. ""I don't like falling behind - we need a different attitude from the start,"" Flick admitted in Thursday's press conference. He wants to see ""a different dynamic, more intensity, more conviction"" because Bayern ""can't just let the opponent run and then hope"" goalkeeper Manuel Neuer will make a save. The Bundesliga leaders have conceded 21 goals in 14 league games this season - more than any other top six club. The tally is not to Flick's liking, but Moenchengladbach coach Marco Rose sees chances for his side, who have won two of the last four meetings with Bayern. ""Bayern like to defend very high because it helps them up front,"" said Rose. ""That creates chances in other spaces to hit the opponent (on the break). It's an open secret."" Flick pulled Joshua Kimmich out of midfield at half-time against Mainz to shore up the defence, which turned the game for Bayern. Kimmich is set to face Gladbach back in the defensive midfield with Niklas Suele expected to take his place at right-back."
7,06/01/2021,02:45,Flick turns up volume as Bayern bid to break bad habit,"Bayern Munich head to Borussia Moenchengladbach for Friday's Bundesliga match aiming to end their current trend of conceding the opening goal, which has angered head coach Hansi Flick into shouting fits in the dressing room.","""I can also get loud -- no problem -- that's something you learn over the years,"" said Flick after giving his players a half-time roasting last Sunday against Mainz before they came roaring back to win 5-2 from two goals down. ""It's sometimes all part of saying, quite clearly, what's going on."" Bayern head to Borussia Park unbeaten in their last 20 games in all competitions. Yet buried in that run are two revealing statistics. Flick's team have conceded the first goal in their last eight league games, but fought back on all eight occasions for five wins and three draws. Sloppy passes and ""negligent"" tackling led to them again trailing relegation candidates Mainz. Flick insists Bayern's first-half performance was ""not what you expect from a top team"". After his sharp words in the dressing room, he switched Joshua Kimmich to right-back with Leon Goretzka shoring up midfield. The effect was almost instantaneous as Kimmich scored their first goal, then set up Leroy Sane for the second as Mainz's lead was wiped out in 11 minutes at the start of the second half. ""The important thing is not to just scream blue murder, but to give the players something they can use to do better,"" Flick said. ""It's great to know that we can fight back, but our goal has to be that we take the lead,"" said Kimmich, back after knee surgery last November. Moenchengladbach, who face Manchester City in the Champions League last 16 next month, are one of Bayern's oldest Bundesliga rivals. They last beat Bayern 2-1 at Borussia Park in December 2019 when Algerian free-kick specialist Ramy Bensebaini scored both goals. After suffering from Covid-19 in November, the 25-year-old defender made a brief comeback on Saturday when he helped protect a slender 1-0 lead at Arminia Bielefeld. Head coach Marco Rose has said Bensebaini could feature on Friday. Saturday's victory, thanks to Breel Embolo's second-half goal, ended Gladbach's run of four league games without a win. ""Bayern Munich are probably the best team in the world right now, it's going to be a highlight,"" said Gladbach midfielder Florian Neuhaus."
8,02/01/2021,23:20,Olmo fires RB Leipzig top of Bundesliga ahead of Bayern Munich,RB Leipzig dislodged Bayern Munich at the top of the Bundesliga table Saturday as Dani Olmo's second-half goal was enough to seal a 1-0 win at Stuttgart.,"""It was really good for me and the team to start the year with a win,"" Olmo told DAZN. With European champions Bayern at home to strugglers Mainz on Sunday, Leipzig took the chance to go a point ahead as Olmo fired through the legs of Stuttgart goalkeeper Gregor Kobel. Stuttgart's Swiss shot-stopper had earlier pulled off some heroics by using his foot to save a Emil Forsberg first-half penalty attempt. Leipzig also wasted a golden chance when Amadou Haidara fired wide just after the break. With 23 minutes left, Spain midfielder Olmo finally got the breakthrough, finishing a move he started after Leipzig had moved the ball across the Stuttgart penalty area. ""It feels good to be top,"" admitted Leipzig defender Willi Orban. ""The first half was good, the second was better - we were clearly the dominant team."" Earlier, Bayer Leverkusen blew the chance to take first place after stumbling to a 2-1 defeat at Eintracht Frankfurt which saw them drop to third as the league resumed after a two-week break. ""I have made my feelings clear in the dressing room,"" Leverkusen head coach Peter Bosz told Sky. ""We deserved to lose. Frankfurt had a better claim to the victory."" Leverkusen midfielder Nadiem Amiri scored with a deft back-heel flick to give the visitors the lead after only 10 minutes in Frankfurt. However, Amin Younes equalised to make it 1-1 at half-time before Japan midfielder Daichi Kamada put in a cross which Leverkusen defender Edmond Tapsoba turned into his own net. Before kickoff, Frankfurt director Fredi Bobic confirmed reports his club are interested in Bayern's teenage striker Joshua Zirkzee, 19, after selling Dutch forward Bas Dost to Brugge. Zirkzee could back up Frankfurt's top scorer Andre Silva, who has notched nine league goals this season. Union Berlin rose to fourth - into the Champions League places for the first time in the club's history - after their 2-0 win at Werder Bremen. Liverpool loanee Taiwo Awoniyi, who has scored in his last three league games, capped another impressive display with a goal and assist. After Bremen lost the ball in their own half, the 23-year-old Nigeria international took advantage of a two-on-two situation by drawing the defence and passing to Sheraldo Becker, who fired home on 12 minutes. Awoniyi doubled Union's lead on 28 minutes by tapping the ball over the line, just out of the reach of Bremen goalkeeper Jiri Pavlenka. Bremen had a penalty appeal turned down when a shot by Japan midfielder Yuya Osako clipped the hand of a Union defender, then Romano Schmid had a goal ruled offside. Hoffenheim lost both defender Kevin Akpoguma and Germany midfielder Sebastian Rudy with early leg injuries as they crashed to a 3-1 home defeat to Freiburg. With the hosts struggling to reshuffle, Freiburg were 3-0 up at half-time thanks to a Baptiste Santamaria goal, a Vincenzo Grifo penalty and an own goal by Senegal defender Kasim Adams. Hoffenheim scored a second-half consolation goal through Togo winger Ihlas Bebou. Borussia Moenchengeladbach, who host Manchester City in the first leg of the Champions League last 16 next month, earned their first win in five league games with a 1-0 victory at Arminia Bielefeld. Swiss striker Breel Embolo netted the winning goal just after half-time when he held off a defender and fired home. Mid-table Augsburg rebounded after back-to-back defeats with a 1-0 win at Cologne with Brazilian winger Iago netting the late winner. Bottom side Schalke are now 30 games without a win -- one short of the Bundesliga record -- after a 3-0 defeat away to Hertha Berlin. Former Tottenham manager Christian Gross, installed as Schalke's fourth head coach this season, got off to a losing start as Arsenal loanee Matteo Guendouzi, Colombia striker Jhon Cordoba and his replacement, Poland forward Krzysztof Piatek, scored for Hertha. Having netted two minutes after coming off the bench, Piatek had a second late goal ruled offside."
9,20/12/2020,19:24,Gladbach fine Thuram month's wages after spitting at opponent,"Borussia Moenchengladbach fined striker Marcus Thuram one month's salary, to be paid to a charity, on Sunday for spitting on an opponent the previous day.","""Marcus has accepted this and has also offered to engage with this social cause on his own behalf,"" the club's sporting director Max Eberl said in a statement. Thuram was sent off after a video review showed him spitting in the face of Stefan Posch of Hoffenheim as the two argued during a Bundesliga match. With Gladbach down to 10 men, Hoffenheim scored a late goal and won 2-1. According to Bild daily, the fine could be in the region of 150,000 euros ($185,796) and constitute a club record sanction. ""Today something took place that is not in my character and must never happen."" Thuram, a 23-year-old France international, posted on Instagram after the game adding that the spit ""occurred accidentally and not intentionally."" ""I apologise to everyone, to Stefan Posch, to my opponents, to my team-mates, to my family and to all those who saw my reaction."" In addition to the club fine, Thuram faces a long ban from the German Football Association. Eberl said he had a ""long discussion"" with Thuram on Sunday morning and that the player was ""devastated"". Thuram ""told me that during a dispute with Stefan Posch, he had unintentionally spat after cursing several times in French in the heat of the moment. ""He knows that this doesn't change anything and that the pictures speak for themselves, and that the sending off was the right call,"" said Eberl. ""I have come to know him as a reflective person with a great demeanour,"" said Eberl. ""He remains the same person we know, and we will stand by him."""
10,19/12/2020,17:57,Gladbach forward Thuram sent off after spitting in opponent's face,Borussia Moenchengladbach forward Marcus Thuram was sent off for spitting in an opponent's face during Saturday's 2-1 home defeat against Hoffenheim in the Bundesliga.,"The French international was shown a straight red card with 11 minutes left, which turned the game after the VAR spotted Thuram spitting at Hoffenheim defender Stefan Posch. The incident happened just after Andrej Kramaric had equalised for Hoffenheim at Borussia Park. Nine minutes after Thuram's dismissal, Tottenham loanee Ryan Sessegnon put Hoffenheim ahead when he tapped in a cross unmarked at the far post. Gladbach, who face Manchester City in the last 16 of the Champions League in February, had gone ahead when their captain Lars Stindl converted a first-half penalty. Having made his France debut in November, this was the first time Thuram - the son of 1998 World Cup winner Lilian Thuram - has been sent off for Gladbach in his two seasons in Germany. Gladbach, winless in their last six games in all competitions, are now eighth in the league while Hoffenheim are up to 11th. With league leaders Bayer Leverkusen hosting European champions Bayern Munich on Saturday night, RB Leipzig missed the chance to go top after being held to a goalless draw at home to Cologne. The point leaves Leipzig second in the table on goal difference, but level on 28 points with Leverkusen. Despite bringing in Dutch veteran Huub Stevens, 67, on Friday as their third coach this season, Schalke are now 29 games without a win after their 1-0 defeat at home to Arminia Bielefeld. Bielefeld, who are also in the bottom three, secured the points thanks to a header from captain Fabian Klos. Schalke are now just two games from the unwanted league record of 31 winless games, set by Tasmania Berlin in 1965/66. Having been recently playing fourth-tier football for their reserves, Werder Bremen's 19-year-old striker Eren Dinkci enjoyed a fairytale Bundesliga debut. He scored their 90th-minute winner with a superb header to seal a 1-0 victory at Mainz just after coming off the bench. Frankfurt stay mid-table after their 2-0 away win at Augsburg as Stefan Ilsanker netted late on after an own-goal by Raphael Framberger for the hosts in Bavaria."
11,15/12/2020,20:54,Gladbach snatch late draw as Stindl claims hat-trick,Borussia Moenchengladbach captain Lars Stindl claimed a hat-trick with an equaliser in the fifth minute of added time to snatch a Bundesliga point in Tuesday's 3-3 draw at Eintracht Frankfurt.,"Stindl's late heroics saved a point at Frankfurt, but Gladbach, who have drawn Manchester City in the last 16 of the Champions League, are winless in their last five games in all competitions. After Stindl opened the scoring by curling in a14th minute free-kick, Frankfurt roared back with three unanswered goals including two by Portugal striker Andre Silva. Leading 3-1, Frankfurt played the last 10 minutes with ten men after captain David Abraham was sent off for a second booking. With 90 minutes almost up, Gladbach won a penalty and Stindl stepped up to convert. Then he netted a last-gasp header to seal the draw. The point leaves Gladbach seventh in the table, seven points behind leaders Bayer Leverkusen, who are at Cologne on Wednesday. Eintracht goalkeeper Kevin Trapp suffered a heavy blow to the head early on after colliding with his own defender. Moments later, Gladbach went ahead when Stindl's superb free-kick went over the wall and outside Trapp's out-stretched glove. Frankfurt responded by pressuring Gladbach, whose defender Stefan Lainer conceded a penalty when he blocked a shot with his hand. Silva converted on 22 minutes. He added a second two minutes later when midfielder Aymen Barkok floated the ball over the defence which Silva brought down with a great first touch and fired past goalkeeper Yann Sommer. Silva then turned provider when he laid the ball off for Barkok who beat two defenders and coolly rolled the ball home on 32 minutes to make it 3-1 at the break. Frankfurt had a penalty awarded, then changed to a free kick by the VAR, when Denis Zakaria tripped Eintracht's Dominik Kohr on the edge of the area. After Abraham was sent off, Gladbach kept pushing and were rewarded as Stindl brought his side level with two late goals."
12,08/12/2020,18:49,Gladbach out to wreck Real Madrid's last 16 hopes,Borussia Moenchengladbach are out to wreck Real Madrid's hopes of reaching the Champions League last 16 on Wednesday as the German visitors look to pull off one of their best results in Europe since their glory days in the late 1970s and early 1980s.,"Heading into the last round of matches, Gladbach are surprise leaders in Group B, a point ahead of both Shakhtar Donetsk and Real, who are third. Real must beat the Germans in Madrid to guarantee a last-16 berth, although a draw would see both sides advance should Shakhtar lose away to Inter in Milan. Madrid have made it out of the Champions League group stage in every season since missing out on the competition in 1996/97, but a defeat will spell elimination for Zinedine Zidane's side. ""We have the best starting position of all the teams in the group and we have earned it thanks to our efforts,"" Gladbach midfielder Christoph Kramer said Tuesday before flying to Spain. Gladbach will qualify as group winners with a victory, but will also go through with a draw or even a defeat if Inter and Shakhtar draw in Wednesday's other Group B game. The Germans got to the European Cup final in 1977, losing to Liverpool who then beat them in the following season's semi-finals. However their more recent forays into the modern Champions League have seen them bow out in the group stage in 2015/16 and again in 2016/17. ""We have a 'final' in front of us,"" said coach Marco Rose. ""We're all looking forward to it, but we know how difficult the task will be. ""We will have to defend with zeal and passion, but with our qualities, we will have opportunities to score."" Gladbach's attack will be spearheaded by their French duo of Marcus Thuram and Alassane Plea. Thuram scored twice in the 2-2 home draw against Real, while Plea has scored five Champions League goals, including a hat-trick in the 6-0 demolition of Shakhtar. Gladbach are without defender Tony Jantschke, who has a hip injury, left-back Ramy Bensebaini, quarantining with the coronavirus, and attacking midfielder Jonas Hofmann, out with a leg injury."
13,08/12/2020,16:00,Real Madrid and Zidane brace for crucial European night,"Real Madrid value success in the Champions League above all else, but the 13-time champions head into Wednesday's game against Borussia Moenchengladbach with their qualification hopes hanging by a thread.","Should they suffer a humiliating group stage exit, ending their remarkable run as the only team to ever avoid elimination at this phase, coach Zinedine Zidane's future will be at risk. A win for either side in the Spanish capital will guarantee them passage through to the last 16 from Group B. If Madrid draw and Shakhtar win or draw with Inter Milan in the other group match, the Spanish giants will be out. Reports in the Spanish capital have linked Madrid with former Tottenham coach Mauricio Pochettino, currently without a club, should they part ways with Zidane, while Real Madrid Castilla coach Raul Gonzalez, a prolific striker for the club in the past, has been touted as a 'plan B'. ""I'm not thinking about that at all, I'm only thinking about winning and finishing top of the group,"" Zidane told reporters on Tuesday when asked about the speculation. ""This match is important for the team to show what it's made of. This club, these players are all used to playing matches under pressure ... we know what we're playing for."" The Frenchman's predecessor Santiago Solari was sacked after the humiliating last-16 exit against Ajax in the Champions League in 2019, paving the way for him to return just 10 months after his sudden departure. Last season's elimination at the same phase by Manchester City was mitigated by the team's strong domestic performance, as they ground their way to the Spanish title, but another early failure in Europe may prove to be the final straw for trigger-happy president Florentino Perez. ""He has written the history of this club and he's still writing it now. Last season he won two trophies for us,"" Casemiro told reporters. ""Often poeple forget what he has done and what he is continuing to do for this club. The team is 100 percent behind the coach."" However, despite his success during two stints in charge, winning three Champions League trophies, two La Liga titles and two Club World Cups among other silverware, and his fine history as a player, a defeat could make Zidane Madrid's eighth managerial casualty in 10 years. He is at least boosted by the return of captain Sergio Ramos and right back Dani Carvajal. The Spanish duo are important parts of Madrid's defence. Ramos in particular is essential, with Madrid having lost eight of their last 10 European games in which the 35-year-old has not played, including the Ajax and Manchester City eliminations. ""Just talking about Sergio is a honour for me. He's our leader, our captain,"" said Casemiro. ""He is one of the best players of all time, we are very happy he is back in the dressing room with us."" Zidane got a boost after a narrow 1-0 victory over Sevilla on Saturday, Real's first Liga win since October. Madrid almost fell to defeat in Germany in October but last-gasp goals from Karim Benzema and Casemiro helped them earn a 2-2 draw after Marcus Thuram's double put Gladbach ahead. A pair of wins against Antonio Conte's underwhelming Inter Milan got Madrid back on track but a dismal 2-0 away defeat by Shakhtar Donetsk at the start of December left Zidane desperately needing a victory this week. Madrid then host league leaders Atletico Madrid in a derby clash on Saturday, another crucial match in a week which could define the Spanish champions' season, and their coach's future. After the Shakhtar defeat Zidane insisted he had no intention of resigning, but if the team stumble against Marco Rose's Gladbach, that decision may be taken out of his hands."
14,21/11/2020,23:11,Haaland scores four as Dortmund cut Bayern's lead,Erling Braut Haaland netted four goals and Youssoufa Moukoko became the youngest player in Bundesliga history on Saturday as Borussia Dortmund routed Hertha Berlin 5-2 to trim Bayern Munich's lead at the top of the table to just a point.,"It was the first time the 20-year-old Haaland had scored four goals in a game for Dortmund since his January debut, with all of them coming in the second half. ""I drank a Red Bull at half time, I got some wings and everything was good,"" said Haaland. The Norwegian now has 10 goals in seven Bundesliga matches this season to give him a total of 31 goals in 30 games in all competitions for Dortmund. After Matheus Cunha gave Hertha a first-half lead at Berlin's Olympic Stadium, Dortmund roared back. Haaland equalised when he tapped home an Emre Can pass on 47 minutes. He grabbed his second two minutes later with perfect timing to slip his marker and fire in a Julian Brandt pass. Haaland wrapped up his hat-trick on 62 minutes, just before Raphael Guerreiro stabbed the ball home from close range to make it 4-1. Cunha converted a late penalty, but the night belonged to Haaland who finished a move he started with 10 minutes to play. There was still time for history to be made as Moukoko made a late cameo off the Dortmund bench to replace Haaland. One day after his 16th birthday, Moukoko is the youngest player in Bundesliga history. ""He's only just turned 16 -- that is amazing,"" Haaland said of Moukoko. ""He has a big career ahead of him."" Dortmund's romp in Berlin moved them second in the standings, behind defending champions Bayern who stayed top despite a 1-1 home draw with Werder Bremen. Germany goalkeeper Manuel Neuer produced great stops to twice deny US forward Josh Sargent as Bremen earned their first point at Bayern for a decade. ""We had to invest a lot,"" Neuer told Sky. The 34-year-old bounced back after conceding six goals in Germany's crushing defeat by Spain in midweek with two brilliant first-half saves in quick succession. He used a boot to block a Sargent shot, then lunged across goal to save from Ludwig Augustinsson. In the dying stages, Neuer then stood tall to block a shot by Sargent, who had broken clear. Bayern coach Hansi Flick was far from pleased that Bremen took the lead in his 50th game in charge, saying his team ""have to defend better"". Bremen deservedly went ahead just before half-time when midfielder Maximilian Eggestein finished off a superb attack. ""We conceded a very cheap goal, that's how Bremen's plan worked and they defended very well,"" said Bayern forward Thomas Mueller. Kingsley Coman equalised in the 62nd minute at the Allianz Arena by meeting a Leon Goretzka cross at the far post. Bayern forward Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting fired over with the goal at his mercy five minutes from time. However, Neuer's heroics at the other end preserved the draw. Bayer Leverkusen are third after their 2-1 win at strugglers Arminia Bielefeld thanks to Aleksandar Dragovic's late winner. The victory was a relief for Leverkusen goalkeeper Lukas Hradecky, who scored a embarrassing own goal early in the second half. Leverkusen were 1-0 up thanks to a Leon Bailey goal when Hradecky sliced a clearance, which rolled into the empty net behind him. Dragovic stabbed home from close range two minutes from time to spare Hradecky's blushes. RB Leipzig sit fourth after Yussuf Poulsen came off the bench and produced a deft second-half volley in their 1-1 draw at Eintracht Frankfurt after winger Aymen Barkok gave the hosts an early lead. Despite having seven players quarantined with the coronavirus, a depleted Hoffenheim drew 3-3 at home with Stuttgart. Schalke's winless run stretched to 24 league games, dating back to January, after losing 2-0 at home to Wolfsburg. A Daniel Caligiuri equaliser two minutes from time gave 10-man Augsburg a 1-1 draw at Borussia Moenchengladbach."

The 28-year-old Alario is the league's second highest scorer behind Bayern Munich striker Robert Lewandowski, who has 11. In an action-packed first-half, Gladbach took an early lead. Gladbach captain Lars Stindl converted a penalty after only 18 minutes when Leverkusen goalkeeper Lukas Hradecky upended striker Breel Embolo in the area. Alario levelled by curling in a superb shot into the top far corner on 27 minutes. Stindl grabbed his second when he snapped up a stray Leverkusen pass in the area and fired home with a half an hour gone. Gladbach had clear first-half chances as defender Ramy Bensebaini clattered the post and forward Marcus Thuram had a shot saved. Alario equalised for the second time when he outleapt his marker and his header flew past Gladbach goalkeeper Yann Sommer, who mistimed his clearance, to make it 2-2 at the break. Leverkusen sealed the win when Bailey fired home from a tight angle, then Baumgartlinger finished off a flowing move eight minutes from time. Arguably the best goal of the game came in the 90th minute when Gladbach replacement forward Valentino Lazaro used the back of his heel to volley a spectacular shot. Earlier, Wolfsburg climbed to sixth after goalkeeper Koen Casteels pulled off a late stunning penalty save to help seal a 2-1 home over Hoffenheim, who have struggled since their shock win over Bayern Munich. Hoffenheim were awarded a penalty in the fourth minute of injury time, but their Israeli striker Munas Dabbur watched helplessly as Casteels pushed away his spot kick attempt. It was the second late penalty which went begging after Wolfsburg's Dutch striker Wout Weghorst fired his spot-kick attempt wide on 84 minutes. Wolfsburg raced into the lead when Swiss winger Renato Steffen scored after just six minutes, although the VAR needed to check whether there was an offside in the build-up. A superb pass by Wolfsburg midfielder Xaver Schlager then split the defence and put Steffen away with the towering Weghorst scoring on 26 minutes. However, the 1.97m-tall Dutchman squandered the chance to put the result beyond doubt when he fired his late penalty attempt wide. Hoffenheim finished the stronger. When Wolfsburg's US defender John Anthony Brooks failed to connect with a clearance header, Hoffenheim's replacement forward Sargis Adamyan smashed his shot into the net three minutes from time. However, Casteels' goalmouth heroics made sure Wolfsburg took the three points. Since shocking Bayern Munich 4-1 in late September left them briefly top of the table, Hoffenheim have claimed just one point in their last five leage games to drop to 13th. Bayern opened a two-point gap over second-placed RB Leipzig on Saturday with a 3-2 win at rivals Borussia Dortmund, who move down to third."

17,03/11/2020,21:14,"Gladbach hammer Shakhtar, Atletico held in Champions League","Alassane Plea scored a hat-trick as Borussia Moenchengladbach romped to a 6-0 win at Shakhtar Donetsk in the Champions League on Tuesday, while Atletico Madrid were held to a 1-1 draw by Lokomotiv Moscow.","As well as Plea's goals, a Valeriy Bondar own goal and counters from Ramy Bensebaini and captain Lars Stindl gave Gladbach their finest European victory since their 1970s glory days. After being pegged back to draw 2-2 in their first two outings in Group B, away to Inter Milan and at home to Real Madrid, the victory moves Marco Rose's Gladbach to the top of the section, one point above Shakhtar. It is the Ukrainian champions worst defeat in a home game in Europe, although they are currently hosting matches in Kiev having been exiled from Donetsk since 2014 when conflict broke out in the east of the country. French forward Plea met Stefan Lainer's low cross with a first-time finish to put the visitors in front in the eighth minute, before a horror show from Bondar allowed them to double their lead. First his miskick gifted the ball to Plea, and then Christoph Kramer's shot took a huge deflection off the Shakhtar defender on its way in. Plea's superb strike into the top-left corner made it 3-0 in the 26th minute, and Algerian defender Bensebaini got the fourth from close range just before the break. Stindl's goal to make it 5-0 arrived with 11 minutes left, and there was still time for Plea to make it six after being played in by Marcus Thuram for a goal that was given after a VAR review confirmed he was onside. The result is a bitter setback for Shakhtar after they began their campaign by beating Real Madrid 3-2 in Spain and then held Inter last week. Real and Inter meet in Madrid later on Tuesday. Meanwhile Atletico were left frustrated in Moscow as their second-half pressure failed to produce a winner against Lokomotiv in Group A in a rare European game this season to be played before a sizeable crowd. Atletico beat the Russians home and away in the group stage last season and went ahead in the 18th minute here when Hector Herrera's cross was headed in by Jose Maria Gimenez. However, Lokomotiv were given the chance to equalise shortly after when Herrera was penalised for a handball in the box following a VAR review. Anton Miranchuk converted the spot-kick to get the railway-backed club back on track. They then soaked up pressure, as Angel Correa's long-range shot struck the bar before the interval and Guilherme saved superbly from Joao Felix after the restart. Substitute Koke also headed against the woodwork for Atletico before Luis Suarez converted the rebound only to be flagged offside. The result means Lokomotiv have now gone eight Champions League games without winning, and reigning champions Bayern can go five points clear of Atletico at the top of Group A if they beat Salzburg later."
18,27/10/2020,23:26,Real fight back for dramatic draw at Gladbach,Casemiro scored a last-gasp equaliser as Real Madrid fought back from two goals down to snatch a 2-2 draw at Borussia Moenchengladbach on Tuesday and avoid a second straight loss in the Champions League.,"Marcus Thuram's double put Gladbach on course for a famous victory, but Real roared back with late efforts from Karim Benzema and Casemiro -- three minutes into added time -- to salvage a point. But Real remain at the bottom of Group B after their shock 3-2 home defeat by a depleted Shakhtar Donetsk side in last week's opener. Shakhtar sit three points clear at the top of the early table after a goalless draw with Inter Milan in Tuesday's earlier Group B encounter. Despite having more than 60 percent possession, Real rarely troubled Gladbach goalkeeper Yann Sommer until the frantic final scenes. Benzema had two early half-chances at Borussia Park, before Gladbach struck in style just after the half-hour mark. A bad pass by Germany star Toni Kroos put the Spanish giants under pressure in their own half. Gladbach midfielder Jonas Hofmann snapped up the loose ball and fed Alassane Plea, whose pin-point low pass to Thuram was buried into the back of the net. Real have now kept clean sheets in just two of their last 13 Champions League games. Thuram, the son of French 1998 World Cup winner Lilian Thuram, pounced to score his second in the 58th minute. When Plea's fierce shot was saved by Real goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois, Thuram was on hand to tap home the rebound from close range and leave the 13-time European champions reeling. It could have been 3-0 a few moments later when Plea was denied when through on goal by Courtois. Zidane threw on Luka Modric and Eden Hazard for the final 20 minutes in an attempt to avoid a damaging defeat. Hazard released Benzema, who hit the side netting as Real desperately hunted for a goal. With time almost up, Casemiro headed the ball back into play from a deep cross and Benzema diverted the ball in from point-blank range. With Real attacking in waves, Modric clipped a cross to the far post, Sergio Ramos leapt highest and Casemiro drove the ball into the roof of the net."
19,26/10/2020,20:18,Hazard back in squad as Real seek Champions League rebound,"Eden Hazard has travelled with Real Madrid to Germany and could return from injury against Borussia Moenchengladbach in the Champions League, coach Zinedine Zidane said on Monday.","""That's good news,"" said Zidane, looking forward to Tuesday's Champions League game. ""We're all pleased he's with us and we'll see how we use him tomorrow,"" Zidane said, speaking from Borussia Park. ""The important thing is that he's back and that's a big positive for us."" Hazard's last appearance came in the Champions League round-of-16 second-leg loss at Manchester City on August 7 at the end of a first season in Madrid undermined by ankle injuries. The 29-year-old Belgian went off in the 83rd minute in Manchester and has not played since, victim of a muscular injury to his right thigh. Real lost their Champions League opener 3-2 at home to Shakhtar Donetsk last Wednesday. They bounced back with a 3-1 Liga victory at Barcelona on Saturday. ""We want to perform as we did in El Clasico and take the points,"" said Zidane. ""The performance we delivered in El Clasico is exactly the kind of display we need to produce tomorrow (Tuesday). We played well, fought as a team and the most important thing is that we try and do that tomorrow."" German midfielder Toni Kroos said Real cannot afford to start the Champions League group stage with losses. ""We know how important this match is after the defeat against Donetsk,"" Kroos told the press conference. ""We already have pressure on us. This match is nothing but a final."" ""We have to change this situation,"" Kroos said. ""There are only six games in the group."""

""There are always bad spells,"" said Sergio Ramos. ""Hopefully this one has only lasted a week."" But the effects of the implosion against Shakhtar, who had 10 first team players missing due to coronavirus infections, still linger, with Madrid sitting bottom of Group B. A win away to Borussia Monchengladbach on Tuesday would limit the damage, especially after Monchengladbach's draw with Inter Milan kept the group tight. And Zidane will know a convincing performance in Germany should suspend talk of a crisis and dispel doubts about his future, at least for now. Even for Real Madrid, two defeats seemed scant ammunition for the uncertainty around their coach that followed. Some reports in the Spanish press were even discussing the arrival of Mauricio Pochettino if mistakes were not rectified at Camp Nou. ""I have always been critical of myself, it is what drives you to improve,"" said Zidane. ""After a loss, as a coach, most of the criticism comes at me and that's normal."" The quickness to question the Frenchman has become a regular feature of his tenure, even while the players sing his praises and the trophies have poured in. It was only three months ago Real Madrid were winning their second La Liga title of his three full seasons in charge, to go with three triumphs in the Champions League. Success, though, has never been enough for Zidane. His reputation as a man-manager has always been a back-handed compliment, even if getting the best out of good players is surely the key to being the coach of a team like Real Madrid. Barcelona wanted a return to the club's DNA by putting Quique Setien and now Ronald Koeman in charge - but few could argue they are not worse off now than under the more pragmatic Ernesto Valverde. The decision to sack Valverde was ""not coherent or logical"", Gerard Pique told Catalan newspaper La Vanguardia on Friday. If capitulation has become Barca's recurring flaw, it is inconsistency that undermines Zidane's Madrid. When they stormed to the title during the 11-game run-in last season, it was with no other distractions and a trophy in sight. With a less immediate prize and against lesser opponents, like Cadiz and Shakhtar Donetsk, the suspicion is those players Zidane trusts completely become unreliable. ""I have won many things with these players,"" Zidane said. ""I will always be with them until the end."" Zidane routinely sidesteps the issue of his future, which creates a nervousness after he resigned so unexpectedly after winning the Champions League in 2018. And perhaps that contributes to the sense of short-termism, an ageing team managed by a coach that seemingly refuses to look beyond the end of the week. Every slip-up is projected as a slump and any doubts feed the idea Zidane might suddenly depart. ""Nothing changes,"" he said. ""Last year? The same. In my first spell? The same. What I have to do is do my job."" Anything but a win on Tuesday and the cycle begins again."

22,26/10/2020,02:20,"Thuram destined to follow in father's footsteps, despite case of mistaken identity","Marcus Thuram is slowly emerging from his famous father's shadow, even if an incident last week in Milan suggested Borussia Moenchengladbach's French forward is not yet a household name everywhere.","The 23-year-old son of 1998 World Cup winner Lilian Thuram is making a name in his own right in the Bundesliga and the Champions League, in which Gladbach host Real Madrid on Tuesday. Lilian Thuram is France's most-capped player, best remembered on the field for his double against Croatia in the 1998 World Cup semi-final as Les Bleus went on to win the trophy on home soil. Marcus therefore has a long way to go to match the achievements of his father, and is clearly not yet as famous as his old man. The day before Gladbach's 2-2 Champions League draw at Inter Milan, a San Siro steward reportedly refused to let Thuram into a press conference where he was due to address media. Wearing a face mask due to the coronavirus pandemic, Thuram had to prove his identity by using Google on his smartphone to convince the suspicious staff member. The next day the forward, who played for Sochaux and Guingamp before going to Germany last year, made sure Inter fans knew who he was as he won a second-half penalty which was converted by Ramy Bensebaini. Unlike the Milan steward, former Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger has certainly heard of the France Under-21 international, who reminds him of a certain Thierry Henry. ""Technically, he (Henry) could do everything, however there is one player in the Bundesliga who reminds me of him -- Marcus Thuram at Borussia Moenchengladbach,"" Wenger told magazine Spiegel. There are certainly few excuses for not recognising Thuram. In May, pictures of him were beamed around the world after he became the first footballer in Germany to take a knee in protest following the death of the 46-year-old African American George Floyd in police custody in Minneapolis. Taking Thuram's lead, players at Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund later also took a knee as part of the ""Black Lives Matter"" protests. ""Of course, as a young black player, the issue concerns me,"" Thuram told AFP in an interview last December, well before the wave of protests last summer sparked by the killing of Floyd. His father runs the Lilian Thuram Foundation which aims to educate young people about racism and why it is wrong. The young Thuram added: ""We have to fight."" On the field he has so far scored 15 goals and created 13 more in 46 games for Gladbach since arriving in July last year following Guingamp's relegation from Ligue 1. He is versatile, having played half of his Gladbach games as a centre forward, the rest mostly on the left wing with the occasional cameo on the right. Gladbach coach Marco Rose knows Thuram ""would like to become a complete striker"", but for now the Frenchman gives his club lots of options. Thuram's pace has seen him win penalties in his last four games. His mazy runs worry defenders, forcing opponents to make mistakes in the area in Gladbach's matches against Cologne, Wolfsburg, Inter and then Mainz on Saturday, when team-mate Jonas Hofmann converted a spot-kick in a 3-2 fightback win. With his side 2-1 down, Rose brought on Thuram and another trusted French forward in Alassane Plea to provide the necessary impetus. Thuram forced Mainz to give away a penalty for handball, Hofmann equalised and then Matthias Ginter scored the winner. That win gave Gladbach a timely confidence boost before facing Real, who beat Barcelona 3-1 in Saturday's Clasico after crashing to a shock 3-2 defeat at home to a depleted Shakhtar Donetsk side last Wednesday. Thuram and Plea are likely to start against Real having forged a partnership which yielded 24 goals between them last season."
23,24/10/2020,18:30,Lewandowski hits hat-trick as Bayern Munich rout Frankfurt,Robert Lewandowski took his Bundesliga tally to 10 goals in five games this season with a hat-trick as Bayern Munich thumped Eintracht Frankfurt 5-0 on Saturday.,"Lewandowski has scored nine goals in his last three league games and wrapped up his treble within an hour at the Allianz Arena. Defending champions Bayern have scored 22 goals this term -- 10 more than league leaders RB Leipzig who stayed top with a 2-1 win over 10-man Hertha Berlin. Bayern sit one point behind in second place. In Munich, Leroy Sane marked his return from injury with the fourth goal during a brief cameo, before England Under-17 midfielder Jamal Musiala also came off the bench to net the fifth. However, Bayern's victory could come at a price as Canadian left-back Alphonso Davies was in clear distress after going off early with an ankle injury. Lewandowski underlined his status as one of the world's best strikers last season by scoring a career-best 55 goals in 47 games, including 34 in the Bundesliga. The Polish international opened the scoring on 10 minutes when he fired home after a Thomas Mueller pass. Frankfurt goalkeeper Kevin Trapp couldn't do anything to stop Lewandowski's header from a Joshua Kimmich corner in the 26th minute. Bayern had a penalty appeal turned down when Douglas Costa's cross clipped the hand of Frankfurt's Makoto Hasebe. Lewandowski wrapped up the victory on the hour mark with a clinical finish from another Costa cross. After sitting out the last two games, Sane ghosted past a defender and drove a shot into the bottom corner with 18 minutes to play. Manuel Neuer pulled off a great save to deny Frankfurt striker Bas Dost before Musiala grabbed the final goal as the visitors suffered their first league defeat of the season. Leipzig came from behind to seal a 2-1 win over Hertha, whose Colombian striker Jhon Cordoba scored in the eighth minute. Leipzig drew level when defender Dayot Upamecano fired home from a free-kick on 11 minutes, but Berlin were reduced to 10 men after the break when substitute Deyovaisio Zeefuik was shown two yellow cards within four minutes of coming on. Leipzig made the man advantage count when Marcel Sabitzer converted a penalty with 13 minutes left. Hertha were lucky not to finish with nine men when another sub, Jessic Ngankam, scythed down Leipzig left-back Angelino and the referee changed his decision to a yellow card having initially showed a straight red. Borussia Moenchengladbach warmed up for Tuesday's Champions League game at home to Real Madrid with a 3-2 comeback win at Mainz. Germany midfielder Lars Stindl gave Gladbach an early lead, but the visitors were 2-1 down at half-time after French striker Jean-Philippe Mateta scored twice for Mainz. Gladbach midfielder Jonas Hofmann converted a penalty on 76 minutes, after a shot by replacement Marcus Thuram was blocked by a Mainz hand before Matthias Ginter headed the winner as Gladbach climbed to fifth.

But Lukaku had the last word sending the ball in from close range in the final minute. ""For me today's result is not a good one, because we can do better. We must continue to work and be strong mentally,"" said Lukaku. ""It is not an easy time for us, but we must keep believing in our quality. ""We have to be stronger and in defence we have to do better too. We conceded two goals because of our mistakes, we wasted many chances. In games like today, you pay."" Earlier, in the same Group B, Shakhtar Donetsk went top after shocking Real Madrid 3-2 in Spain. Inter are third in the group behind Borussia Moenchengladbach. Antonio Conte's depleted Inter side had been looking to bounce back from a 2-1 derby defeat to AC Milan at the weekend, but were struggling with five players missing through coronavirus. Full-back Achraf Hakimi was ruled out hours before the game, joining four other Inter players unavailable due to positive tests -- Milan Skriniar, Roberto Gagliardini, Andrei Radu and Ashley Young. Hakimi joined former three-time Champions League winners Inter from Real Madrid in the summer and had impressed in his opening matches. ""It was not easy today to receive the news at 5pm that Hakimi was positive,"" said Conte. ""He trained with us until this morning, we had prepared. But I told the lads to face this situation head on. ""We played well against a team that has great potential. ""I don't remember any Handanovic saves while we had chances to win the game. I have nothing to criticise the lads for."" Matteo Darmian took the place of Moroccan international Hakimi with Dane Christian Eriksen starting behind Lukaku and Alexis Sanchez, who was favoured to start over Lautaro Martinez. Alessandro Bastoni returned to the group after recovering from the coronavirus, and came off the bench in the second half. Borussia coach Marco Rose opted for Breel Embolo, Hofmann and Marcus Thuram to support Alassane Plea. Inter had the best of the first half with Lukaku missing a chance just before the break, connecting with a Sanchez cross, only to send the ball across the face of goal. Lautaro replaced Sanchez for the second half with the Argentine striker nodding wide, before Lukaku broke through amid a scramble in front of goal. But Moenchengladbach pulled level from the spot after 63 minutes when an Arturo Vidal foul on Thuram was confirmed after a VAR review. Bensebaini stepped up to leave Samir Handanovic in the Inter goal with no chance. Lautaro rattled the post, but it was the Bundesliga side that grabbed the second when Hofmann connected with a Florian Neuhaus cross. The former two-time UEFA Cup winners thought they had done enough but Lukaku came through with the last-gasp equaliser for his sixth goal in five games this season. ""Overall we made the most of our opportunities even if you can see we still lack a bit of experience,"" said Rose ahead of their next game against Real Madrid. ""Real Madrid will be angry, but we take away only positive things from Milan, even if after all these years without Champions League we may not be at the top right away."""

26,03/10/2020,17:58,Haaland nets twice as Dortmund run riot,Erling Braut Haaland again demonstrated his deadly finishing by netting twice on Saturday as Borussia Dortmund climbed to second in the Bundesliga table with a 4-0 demolition of Freiburg.,"Dortmund bounced back from last weekend's shock defeat at Augsburg as Haaland shone to leave him on 21 goals in 23 games for Dortmund since his January transfer as the burly Norwegian claimed clinically-taken goals. Having also scored in Wednesday's German Super Cup 3-2 defeat at Bayern Munich, the 20-year-old Haaland has netted five goals in as many games this season. Dortmund were missing England winger Jadon Sancho and goalkeeper Roman Buerki, both recovering from illness having tested negative for the coronavirus. Club captain Marco Reus made his first start for eight months after a groin injury. US teenager Giovanni Reyna, who assisted all three goals, was outstanding alongside Reus in the attacking midfield role for Dortmund. The 17-year-old played Haaland into space for the burly Norwegian to score both his goals, then delivered a pin-point corner for Emre Can's headed goal. Haaland, 19, once again showed dazzling finishing when he fired home from a right angle on 31 minutes. Can then rose highest from a corner and his bullet header put Dortmund 2-0 up two minutes after the break. Reyna and Haaland combined again when they got in behind the defence as the American delayed his pass which the Norwegian hammered into the net on 66 minutes. Winger Felix Passlack claimed his first Bundesliga goal in added time to complete the rout with Haaland providing the final pass. Defending champions Bayern Munich host Hertha Berlin on Sunday out to bounce back from last weekend's shock defeat at Hoffenheim to end their 23-match winning streak. Eintracht Frankfurt top the league table after their 2-1 win over previous leaders Hoffeheim. Croatia striker Andrej Kramaric netted his eighth goal in four games with a superb strike, curled inside the far corner, to give Hoffenheim the lead on 18 minutes. However, Japan midfielder Daichi Kamada turned the game when he tapped home on 54 minutes, then powered through the defence before Bas Dost stabbed the ball over the line on 19 minutes from time. It could have been 3-1 as Frankfurt had a late goal disallowed. Champions League side Moenchenegladbach romped to a 3-1 win at Cologne as Alassane Plea and Stefan Lainer fired home before Lars Stindl added a penalty on 56 minutes. Cologne scored a consolation goal when Elvis Rexhbecaj beat Gladbach keeper Yann Sommer from 20 metres out. Bremen earned a second win in three games when Leonardo Bittencourt's right-footed shot on 27 minutes sealed their 1-0 win at home to new boys Arminia Bielefeld. The hosts survived a late scare as Bielefeld had a goal disallowed just before the whistle. Leverkusen were held to a 1-1 draw at Stuttgart as Patrik Schick's early goal was cancelled out by an equaliser by the hosts' striker Sasa Kalajdzic. On Friday, Union Berlin enjoyed their first win of the season with a 4-0 thumping of Mainz at home as Germany striker Max Kruse scored his first goal for the hosts."
27,19/09/2020,21:15,Haaland and Reyna shine as Dortmund youngsters down Gladbach,Erling Braut Haaland scored twice and 17-year-old Giovanni Reyna shone as youthful Borussia Dortmund swept aside fellow Champions League side Borussia Moenchengladbach 3-0 on Saturday on the opening weekend of the Bundesliga season.,"After holders Bayern Munich had kicked off the 2020/21 campaign on Friday with a record 8-0 thrashing of Schalke, Dortmund's youngsters also dazzled at home to Gladbach. ""It was a really good start to the season. We have a lot of young guys, it's fun to play with guys near my age,"" said USA Under-17 international Reyna. ""This is an exciting group and we have to keep working."" Haaland converted a second-half penalty, then again showcased his clinical eye for goal by finishing a superb counter as Dortmund attacked from their own goal. Coach Lucien Favre banked on youth by starting two 17-year-olds in Reyna and England Under-21 midfielder Jude Bellingham, who made his league debut, with Sancho and Haaland, both 20, leading Dortmund's attack. Reyna, making just his third league start, paid back the faith by scoring the opening goal and winning the penalty Haaland converted. Reyna drilled home Bellingham's superb pass from a tight ankle on 34 minutes, then had his ankle clipped after a darting run into the area to win the penalty for Haaland. Sancho tried to convince Haaland to let him take the spot-kick, but ""I was confident whoever took it, would score, which is the most important thing"" said Reyna. Haaland then stole the show with a stunning end-to-end sprint to support Sancho's break before crashing home Dortmund's third goal on 78 minutes. The towering Norwegian, the first player in Bundesliga history to score a hat-trick from the bench, now has 18 goals in 20 games for Dortmund since his arrival in January. For the first time since March, some German league clubs were able to welcome back limited numbers of fans, depending on permission from local health authorities. The biggest crowd of the day was in Dortmund, as 9,300 cheered the impressive home win. ""It's amazing to have fans back, they support us so much,"" added Reyna. Having finished runners-up to Bayern for the last two seasons, Dortmund are on a collision course with the European champions who they meet in the German Super Cup showdown on September 30 in Munich. Earlier, Hertha Berlin's new-signing Jhon Cordoba scored on his debut in a 4-1 away romp at Werder Bremen as the ambitious capital city club also threw down an early marker. In front of 8,500 in Bremen, Hertha defender Peter Pekarik and Belgian-born winger Dodi Lukebakio scored quick-fire goals at the end of the first half to leave Werder 2-0 down at the break and the hosts were whistled off the pitch by their own fans. Colombia striker Cordoba, signed from Cologne in mid-week, came on to start the move which Brazil Under-23 forward Matheus Cunha finished as Hertha went 3-0 up with an hour gone. Davie Selke scored Bremen's second-half consolation goal before Cordoba capped his debut by tucking home Hertha's fourth goal on 90 minutes. Just like Bayern, Cologne also had to play behind closed doors due to a rising rate of infection for their 3-2 home defeat to Hoffenheim, for whom Andrej Kramaric scored a hat-trick. The Croatia striker put the visitors ahead after three minutes following a mix up in defence, netted a penalty and smashed home the winning goal in added time after Cologne had launched a late fight back. In the capital, playmaker Michael Gregoritsch and winger Andre Hahn scored late goals as Augsburg beat hosts Union Berlin 3-1 in front of 4,600 fans. Newly-promoted Arminia Bielefeld earned a point with a 1-1 draw at Eintracht Frankfurt on their return to the top flight in front of 6,500. Stuttgart, who also came up, gave Freiburg a scare with late goals by Sasa Kalajdzic and Silas Wamangituka as they fought back in a 3-2 defeat in front of 8,000."
28,27/06/2020,18:01,"Bremen snatch play-off survival chance, champions Bayern rout Wolfsburg","Werder Bremen gave themselves hope of avoiding relegation from the German Bundesliga by thrashing Cologne 6-1 to grab a play-off place on the last day of the season, while champions Bayern Munich routed Wolfsburg before lifting the trophy on Saturday.","Japan striker Yuya Osako scored twice as Bremen stole the lifeline of the relegation/promotion play-off place from Fortuna Duesseldorf, who lost 3-0 at Union Berlin and were relegated with Paderborn, finishing one point behind Bremen. Florian Kohfeldt's Werder will face second-tier opponents in either Heidenheim or possibly neighbours, rivals and fellow fallen giants Hamburg in the play-off first leg on Thursday. Bremen have spent more seasons than any other team in the Bundesliga, having only spent one term in the second tier, in 1980-81. A burst of goals from Osako, Milot Rashica and Niclas Fuellkrug -- all in the space of eight minutes -- had Werder 3-0 up at the break against Cologne at the Weserstadion. Former Everton midfielder Davy Klaassen then fired home a rebound just after the break before Osako, facing his old side, added his second and USA international Josh Sargent completed the rout. Dominick Drexler pulled a goal back for Cologne. Werder, the four-time Bundesliga champions, also needed a favour from Berlin and got one as Union beat Fortuna 3-0 with goals from Nigerian duo Anthony Ujah and Suleiman Abdullahi either side of veteran midfielder Christian Gentner's effort. Bremen will find out their play-off opponents on Sunday, with Heidenheim currently in the play-off place ahead of the final round of matches in the second division. At Wolfsburg, Bayern striker Robert Lewandowski scored a penalty for his 34th league goal of the season, finishing as the top scorer for the fifth time. Kingsley Coman, Michael Cuisance and Thomas Mueller also got on the scoresheet as Bayern, champions for the eighth straight season, finished 13 points clear of second-placed Borussia Dortmund. Mueller set up Coman for Bayern's opening goal to finish the campaign with a league record 21 assists, and his goal that rounded out the win was also Bayern's 100th league goal this season -- one short of the Bundesliga record. Wolfsburg captain Josuha Guilavogui was sent off for a second yellow card after fouling Cuisance, leading to Lewandowski's penalty. Meanwhile, Borussia Moenchengladbach and RB Leipzig secured qualification for next season's Champions League after 2-1 wins over Hertha Berlin and Augsburg respectively, as fifth-placed Bayer Leverkusen missed out by two points despite beating Mainz 1-0. Dortmund, who had already wrapped up second place, crashed to a 4-0 home defeat by Hoffenheim, for whom Croatia striker Andrej Kramaric scored all four goals, including one penalty. That result allowed Hoffenheim to leapfrog Wolfsburg and take sixth place, although both sides will go into the Europa League next season along with Leverkusen. Before kick-off in Dortmund, Mario Goetze, whose winning goal sealed Germany's victory in the 2014 World Cup final, was given a send-off by the club. He will leave this summer with his contract having expired, but the 28-year-old attacking midfielder has not announced his future club. Elsewhere, Timo Werner signed off with a brace in RB Leipzig's 2-1 win at Augsburg in what was his final appearance for the club before moving to Chelsea. Schalke's disastrous second half of the season was completed with a 4-0 thrashing at the hands of Freiburg as they finished the season 12th, having been third in December. Eintracht Frankfurt beat bottom side Paderborn 3-2 in Saturday's other game."

The Frenchman's return for the club's two final games of the season, at Paderborn on Saturday and at home against Hertha Berlin on June 27 was ""very doubtful"", according to Gladbach coach Marco Rose. Plea's fellow Frenchman Thuram, who has also notched up 10 goals in this coronavirus-interrupted season, turned an ankle against Bayern Munich and will not play again this season. ""The season's over for Marcus. We're even considering an operation,"" Rose said. Gladbach sit fifth in the Bundesliga, a point behind fourth-placed Bayer Leverkusen. Only the top four teams will qualify for the 2020-2021 Champions League, with the fifth-placed team taking part in the Europa League."
30,16/06/2020,20:58,Gladbach brush aside Wolfsburg to boost Champions League hopes,Borussia Moenchengladbach stayed in the hunt for a Champions League berth with an emphatic 3-0 Bundesliga home win over Wolfsburg on Tuesday as midfielder Jonas Hofmann scored twice.,"After consecutive defeats by Freiburg and Bayern Munich, who can win an eighth straight league title later on Tuesday with victory at Werder Bremen, Gladbach raced into a two-goal lead after half an hour at Borussia Park. Hofmann scored twice before Germany international Lars Stindl swept a third into the net following a second-half counter-attack. Gladbach moved back into the fourth and final Champions League spot, two points ahead of Bayer Leverkusen, who host Cologne on Wednesday in their game in hand. Bayern and Borussia Dortmund have already qualified for next season's group stage, while RB Leipzig sit third, five points clear of Leverkusen. Gladbach took the lead on 11 minutes when Swiss forward Breel Embolo sidestepped a defender and played the ball into Hofmann, who fired past Wolfsburg goalkeeper Koen Casteels. The hosts doubled their lead when a long ball into the box was headed down by 2014 World Cup winnner Matthias Ginter into the path of Hofmann, who made no mistake from close range. Gladbach put the result to bed when a wayward pass from Wolfsburg defender John Brooks was snapped up by winger Ibrahima Traore, whose pass picked out Stindl to fire home 25 minutes from the final whistle. The defeat leaves Wolfsburg sixth, which carries a Europa League place next season. The result was all the more impressive as Gladbach eased to victory without injured French forwards Marcus Thuram and Alassane Plea. Marco Rose's Gladbach face bottom side Paderborn on Saturday, then mid-table Hertha Berlin on the final day of the season, while Leverkusen face Hertha and Mainz in their last two games."
31,13/06/2020,20:41,Goretzka winner puts Bayern within one victory of Bundesliga title,Bayern Munich moved to within just one win of an eighth straight Bundesliga title as a late Leon Goretzka goal sealed a 2-1 victory over Borussia Moenchengladbach at the Allianz Arena on Saturday.,"Teenage striker Joshua Zirkzee put Bayern ahead before Benjamin Pavard's own goal levelled for Gladbach, but Goretzka netted his third goal in five league games with four minutes remaining. Even without the suspended Robert Lewandowski and Thomas Mueller, Bayern earned their 13th straight win in all competitions to re-establish their seven-point lead over Borussia Dortmund at the top of the table with three matches left. Victory at relegation-threatened Werder Bremen on Tuesday will confirm Bayern as German champions for the 30th time in Hansi Flick's first season in charge. ""I'm happy that the team got the job done with some hard work -- those were three important, 'big' points,"" said Flick. Second-placed Dortmund had earlier trimmed Bayern's lead to four points when Erling Braut Haaland's last-gasp header grabbed a dramatic 1-0 win at Fortuna Duesseldorf. Bayern had to dig deep again, having also laboured to victory by the same margin in Wednesday's German Cup semi-final win over Eintracht Frankfurt. Gladbach made a fast start but were denied an early lead as Jonas Hofmann's strike was ruled out for offside. But visiting goalkeeper Yann Sommer gifted Bayern a 26th-minute advantage when his dreadful pass across the edge of his area was met by the 19-year-old Zirkzee, who coolly found the net to score his fourth Bundesliga goal from just eight appearances. Gladbach deservedly drew level though when Pavard turned Patrick Herrmann's cross into his own net eight minutes before the break. Both sides had second-half chances, but Goretzka settled matters when he turned home Pavard's low cross. Earlier, Dortmund were heading towards a frustrating draw at relegation-threatened Fortuna when Haaland headed home centre-back Manuel Akanji's cross in the 95th minute. ""It's a bit of a lucky thing that we were able to walk away with the win today,"" admitted Dortmund goalkeeper Roman Buerki. With time almost up, Haaland, who returned from injury as a second-half substitute, flicked a header into the bottom corner for his 14th goal in 15 games since joining Dortmund from Salzburg in January. Dortmund had endured a nervous final 10 minutes as Duesseldorf substitute Steven Skrzybski twice hit the post and fired wide before Haaland struck. Haaland's goal, coupled with Bayern's win, ensured Dortmund qualified for next season's Champions League group stage. Duesseldorf, who occupy the relegation play-off spot, are now only ahead of second-bottom Werder Bremen on goal difference following their 5-1 thumping of Paderborn. Bremen, who have spent more seasons in the Bundesliga than any other club, responded to back-to-back home defeats with an emphatic away victory in pouring rain as Davy Klaassen netted either side of a goal by Japanese forward Yuya Osako in the first half. Maximilian Eggestein made it four with only an hour gone, after Bremen forward Milot Rashica also had a penalty saved, before Abdelhamid Sabiri scored a consolation for rock-bottom Paderborn. Bremen substitute Niclas Fuellkrug capped a fairytale return from a serious knee injury when he slotted home the fifth goal late on. Paderborn are now mathematically certain to finish in the bottom three. Ten-man Hertha Berlin suffered a 4-1 thrashing at home by Eintracht Frankfurt after defender Dedryck Boyata was sent off on the stroke of half-time for bringing down Bas Dost. Krzysztof Piatek gave Hertha an early lead, but Frankfurt roared back with a goal from Dost, two from Portuguese forward Andre Silva and one for French defender Evan N'Dicka. Freiburg came from two goals down to earn a 2-2 draw at Wolfsburg in a game which saw the hosts' striker Wout Weghorst have two goals disallowed by VAR. Union Berlin pulled away from the relegation places with their first victory since February, winning 2-1 at Cologne."

Sancho scored a hat-trick in a 6-1 win over Paderborn and revealed a ""Justice for George Floyd"" T-shirt Sunday.

""Statistics and records don't interest me, what's important is to have a successful season,"" said Flick. -- Dynamo Dresden remain rock bottom of Bundesliga 2 after a 2-0 defeat to fallen giants Stuttgart. Dresden had to delay their return from the coronavirus suspension earlier this month after two members of staff tested positive. That put the entire squad into a 14-day quarantine. Before their game at the weekend, fans staged a spectacular firework display with an accompanying banner which read: ""Together against the rest of the world."" Sadly, such enthusiasm was absent on the pitch as the team's 84 days without football showed. ""We come from the balcony. We trained for two weeks in the living room and on the balcony,"" said despondent coach Markus Kauczinski."

Union's Swedish striker Sebastian Andersson pulled one back early in the second-half after being left unmarked. However, Gladbach pulled away when Thuram added his second after pressing the Union defence. The 22-year-old French striker then took a knee on the Borussia Park turf, imitating NFL star Colin Kaepernick. It was the latest show of Bundesliga solidarity with the current protests sweeping the United States. Schalke's US midfielder Weston McKennie wore an armband in Saturday's defeat to Werder Bremen bearing the words ""Justice for George"". George Floyd, 46, died in Minneapolis in an arrest by a police officer who pinned him to the ground for several minutes by kneeling on his neck. On Sunday, Alassane Plea grabbed a goal of his own for Gladbach, having set up Thuram's first, when he fired home off his left foot on 81 minutes to beat Union goalkeeper Rafal Gikiewicz. After a 3-1 defeat to Leverkusen last weekend, and a goalless draw with relegation-threatened Werder Bremen on Tuesday, this was an important win for Gladbach. It lifted them to third in the table, but RB Leipzig can take their place if they win at Cologne on Monday. On Saturday, reigning champions Bayern Munich opened a 10-point lead with a 5-0 thrashing of Fortuna Duesseldorf with the league's top-scorer Robert Lewandowski netting twice. Later Sunday, second-placed Borussia Dortmund can trim Bayern's lead if they win at bottom side Paderborn."

On the second weekend since the Bundesliga restarted, the figures were spread out around the Gladbach stadium along with banners, some of which were protesting against games behind closed doors. Visitors Leverkusen also got in on the act with a handful of away supporters having paid 19 euros ($20.72) to have their cut-outs appear in the away end. However, the cut-outs couldn't inspire the hosts as rising Germany star Kai Havertz, 20, netted an early goal for Leverkusen and converted a second-half penalty. Gladbach forward Marcus Thuram pulled a goal back for the hosts but defender Sven Bender put the result beyond doubt when a late free-kick struck his shoulder but flew into the net. The result allowed Leverkusen to claim third place while Gladbach dropped to fourth in the table."

Yet at fourth-placed Gladbach, fans now have the option to order a ""life-size cardboard cut-out"" of themselves -- complete with photos of their faces -- to occupy their usual spot on the terraces. ""This way, we will be the first club to bring a bit of life back to our stadium, even if fans actually have to watch from home,"" wrote supporter organisation Fanprojekt Moenchengladbach (FPMG) in an online statement on Wednesday. For 19 euros ($21), Gladbach fans can buy the cardboard cut-out, which FPMG said would actually be made of ""weather-proof plastic"". The proceeds would help to keep FPMG's seven employees in a job, with some of the money also donated to good causes close to the club, organisers said. The figures themselves, meanwhile, are to be produced by two small firms in Moenchengladbach which have been forced to close during the crisis. ""We won't be making any profits, and when the 'war' is won, everyone can take home their doppelganger as a reminder of these curious times,"" said FPMG.

Bayern has a massive wage bill which reached 336 million euros (364 million dollars) last year, almost half of club turnover. Players at Borussia Moenchengladbach were the first in the Bundesliga to propose a pay cut, followed by others at Werder Bremen and Schalke 04. Borussia Dortmund and Bayer Leverkusen players are in talks over pay cut proposals with management. At Dortmund -- second in the Bundesliga -- coach Lucien Favre has made a personal offer to take a pay cut while players are negotiating a 20 percent salary reduction if the season does not restart or a 10 percent cut if play resumes behind closed doors, when clubs will at least earn income from TV rights."

An own goal from visiting defender Jorge Mere doubled the advantage 20 minutes from time, and despite a late strike from Cologne forward Mark Uth, Gladbach held on to bounce back from last Friday's 2-1 loss to second-placed Borussia Dortmund.

Oscar Wendt added a second in first half injury time, pouncing on a poor defensive error from Frankfurt's Martin Hinteregger. Danny Da Costa's 59th-minute goal brought Frankfurt back into the match, with the visitors dominant until Nico Elvedi silenced the away fans with a superb headed goal against the run of play. Hinteregger and Denis Zakaria added one goal a piece for each team in the dying stages, with the home side holding on to a comfortable two-goal advantage. The win lifts them onto 19 points, one ahead of Bayern Munich, while Frankfurt are back in ninth. 'Gladbach coach Rose said that his side's lofty standing was no fluke. ""We deserved to win. We consistently tried to build pressure and be brave in pushing for more goals,"" he said. ""For us, the Bundesliga is about gradually improving our game and getting better."" Earlier, a late VAR intervention cost Wolfsburg the chance to go top with Joao Victor's 84th-minute goal disallowed in a goalless draw against Augsburg. Wolfsburg celebrated what they thought was a victory after Tin Jedvaj's cross was tapped home by Victor before referee Tobias Stieler overturned the strike for offside. The visitors started on top, dominating the first period. Augsburg striker Florian Niederlechner had a number of chances, going close in the 17th minute with a close range shot. Niederlechner had another chance to open the scoring in the 50th minute, but again failed to convert. Brazilian defender William was the home side's best player, probing and asking constant questions of the Augsburg defence. It was a rare offensive stalemate for Wolfsburg, who had scored in every Bundesliga game so far this season. They are now fourth, level on 17 points with Freiburg. Wolfsburg remain the Bundesliga's only unbeaten side, while Augsburg finish the weekend in 17th after chalking up their fourth draw of the season. Wolfsburg coach Oliver Glasner said that he was not disappointed with his charges. ""We have to live with a point. The championship lead would have been a nice snapshot. Even so, the table is pretty pleasing to look at."" The stalemate highlighted the congested nature of the 2019-20 Bundesliga campaign, with only four points separating leaders Bayern Munich from 10th-placed Hoffenheim."

Of the eight who have played so far this weekend, only Eintracht Frankfurt and Dortmund have won. Gladbach remained top, ahead of Wolfsburg, who drew 1-1 at RB Leipzig, on goal difference. Both have 16 points from eight games. Bayern, Dortmund and Leipzig are all one point behind. Then come four teams on 14 points, including Freiburg, who could have gone top but lost 2-0 at Union Berlin, and Bayer Leverkusen, who could also have taken over first, but lost at Frankfurt on Friday. Schalke have a chance to seize top spot when they visit Hoffenheim on Sunday. In Dortmund, Thorgan Hazard's first-half strike for the home team against his former club was ruled out by VAR for a tight offside call. Hazard then found a sprinting Marco Reus with a perfect through ball in the 58th minute. Reus slotted home for the only goal of the game. Even though another Dortmund strike was erased by VAR in the 85th minute, the home team finished the game hanging on, adopting a back-five and even a back-six in added time to end a run of three successive draws. Dortmund started without 19-year-old attacker Jadon Sancho who was dropped for ""disciplinary reasons"". ""Jadon is a great kid, but he is still very young,"" Dortmund director of football Michael Zorc told German television before kick-off. ""The decision was not easy, but there was no other choice. The suspension is only active for today."" German media reported Sancho had returned late from England duty. Reigning champions Bayern, meanwhile, slipped up for the second league match in succession, having lost 2-1 at home to Hoffenheim before the international break. Augsburg grabbed a rapid lead -- just as they had in the corresponding fixture last year -- when Marco Richter found the net with a sweetly-struck volley just 30 seconds after kick-off, the fastest goal of the season so far. Bayern replied as Robert Lewandowski stretched his scoring streak to eight games in the 14th minute from a Serge Gnabry cross. After a host of missed chances, former Arsenal winger Gnabry then put Bayern 2-1 ahead after 49 minutes. But a strong run in injury time by Sergio Cordova set up Alfred Finnbogason, who finished past Manuel Neuer to earn a point for Augsburg, and put another early dent in Bayern's title defence. Thomas Mueller missed two chances after coming on as a late substitute after a week of controversy over the fact he has not started a game since September. Timo Werner scored his first goal in five games for Leipzig in a tight tussle against Wolfsburg at the Red Bull Arena. It was not enough. Wolfsburg scored a late equaliser when Dutch striker Wout Weghorst finished a William cross to keep the race at the top close. Wolfsburg are the only unbeaten team in the division. At the Weserstadion, Werder Bremen opened the scoring at home against Hertha Berlin as Josh Sargent's strike took a deflection on its way into the net in the seventh minute. Dodi Lukebakio hit back in the 70th minute for Hertha to secure a 1-1 draw. He beat three defenders, including Theodor Gebre Selassie twice, in a mazy run from the wing. Union Berlin claimed just the second win of their debut top-flight season by beating Freiburg at a bouncing Stadion an der Alten Foersterei."
49,18/10/2019,03:01,Kovac tells Bayern to dig in after Hoffenheim slump,Niko Kovac says Bayern Munich need to prove their shock defeat to Hoffenheim was only a Champions League hangover in their bid to reclaim top spot in the Bundesliga Saturday.,"Bayern followed up their 7-2 thrashing of Tottenham in the Champions League by crashing to a 2-1 loss in the Bundesliga a fortnight ago when mid-table Hoffenheim earned their first win at the Allianz Arena. In the process, Moenchengladbach topped the table and Bayern dropped to third with five other teams all within two points of first place. Now Kovac wants a win this weekend at Augsburg, where Bayern conceded a first-minute Leon Goretzka own-goal and needed two Kingsley Coman goals to earn a 3-2 win in February. ""There are teams all over Europe who have problems in their league after Champions League games,"" said Kovac on Thursday. ""Hoffenheim were better than their place in the table (12th) suggested - the same goes for Augsburg (14th). ""We know that is a hard place to win, we were a goal down after 10 seconds there last season. ""I expect a game in which we will have to hang in there and make the most of our opportunities."" Fresh from scoring a hat-trick for Poland, and helping them qualify for the Euro 2020 finals, Bayern striker Robert Lewandowski can equal the league record by scoring at Augsburg to continue his run of a goal in each of the first eight games. The 31-year-old is in blistering form with 15 goals, including 11 in the Bundesliga, so far in 11 matches in all competitions. Kovac said Germany winger Serge Gnabry, who had a leg knock, and French defender Lucas Hernandez (knee) were both ""ready to play"". Things are so tight in the top half of the table that seventh-placed Bayer Leverkusen could move into first place by beating Eintracht Frankfurt on Friday night. ""It's striking that the league is divided into two parts,"" acknowledged Kovac. ""Many of the top teams play in Europe, but I think that Leipzig, Dortmund and Leverkusen will stay at the top for a long time."" Despite Kovac's confidence in Bayern's rivals Dortmund, Lucien Favre's team must end their run of three consecutive 2-2 league draws -- in which they have thrown away the lead on each occasion -- at home to current leaders Gladbach on Saturday. On Thursday, Dortmund extended the contract of Euro 2016 winner Raphael Guerreiro until 2023, but Favre says it is still ""too early"" for striker Paco Alcacer, who has an Achilles tendon injury. Favre says Dortmund must improve ""five to ten percent"" to beat Gladbach and close the four-point gap behind the leaders. The 2014 World Cup winner has started Bayern's last six games on the bench -- ""a trend that doesn't make (him) happy"" -- with Kovac preferring Philippe Coutinho in the attacking midfielder role behind Lewandowski. Mueller could start at Augsburg after Coutinho endured a mammoth round-trip to Singapore, on duty with Brazil, for internationals against Senegal and Nigeria. On Thursday, Kovac admitted he ""made a mistake"" by saying the 30-year-old Mueller, who has made 495 appearances for Bayern and helped them win eight Bundesliga title, will only be called upon off the bench ""in case of emergencies"" and held clear-the-air talks. 1.57 - the number of goals Lewandowski has scored on average per Bundesliga game this season. 52 - his projected goal tally for 34 matches in the 2019/20 season if he maintains his present average. It would beat the record of 40 Gerd Mueller set in 1971/72. 88 &amp; 90 - the minutes in which Dortmund have conceded own-goals in two of their last three matches - all of which ended in 2-2 draws.

50,28/09/2019,21:00,Lewandowski hailed for 'extreme goals quota' as Bayern go top,"Record-breaking Bayern Munich striker Robert Lewandowski was hailed for his ""extreme quota of goals"" on Saturday as the defending German champions warmed up for their European duel against Tottenham with a nervy win at strugglers Paderborn which took them to the top of the Bundesliga.","Lewandowski became the first player in Bundesliga history to score 10 goals in the first six games to seala 3-2 victory at bottom club Paderborn. While Bayern squeezed past Paderborn, Leipzig were shocked 3-1 at home to Schalke to surrender top spot. Bayern took full advantage to claim first place before Tuesday's key Champions League clash at Spurs, but not before conceding two second-half goals. Philippe Coutinho, who is rebooting his career on loan in Munich after an unhappy stint at Barcelona, played a key role by setting up Serge Gnabry's opening goal with a sublime first-half pass. Having scored his first Bayern goal the week before in a rout of Cologne, the Brazilian playmaker tapped home Gnabry's neat pass after the break before substitute Kai Proeger pulled a goal back for Paderborn. With time almost up, Lewandowski showed great finishing prowess to put away a Niklas Suele pass and make it 3-1, becoming the first Bayern player to score in each of the first six matches of the season. He is also the first Bundesliga player to reach 10 goals after the first six games. ""It's an extreme quota, which helps when they decide games like that,"" said midfielder Joshua Kimmich of Lewandowski's goal haul. ""To have ten already is something else."" There were, however, nervous looks in Bayern's ranks during the final ten minutes after Paderborn defender Jamilu Collins beat Germany goalkeeper Manuel Neuer from 30 metres out. ""We didn't finish them off,"" admitted Gnabry. ""In the second half, we had so many goal opportunities to decide the game, but our finishing was missing. ""Tottenham will be a completely different game and, of course, we must improve, but I think we can do well there."" In Leipzig, Morocco international midfielder Amine Harit inspired Schalke to an impressive away win, winning and drilling home a penalty, then setting up a first Bundesliga goal for Welsh teenager Rabbi Matondo. The Royal Blues raced into a 2-0 lead with first-half goals as Senegalese centre-back Salif Sane headed home from a corner on 29 minutes before Harit's penalty. The referee took a long look at the replays after Harit went down after the faintest of contact from Mali defender Amadou Haidara. Schalke, under ex-Huddersfield coach David Wagner, made sure of the three points when Matondo claimed his first Bundesliga goal since joining from Manchester City. Harit again did the damage, punishing a mistake in midfield then putting in a well-timed pass which sent Liverpool-born Matondo away to fire home on 58 minutes. Emil Forsberg's consolation goal came too late for Leipzig. The shock result shook up the table with Bayern now top, Leipzig drop to second and Schalke jumped from fifth to third. Questions about Borussia Dortmund's mentality will again be raised after more defensive lapses in their 2-2 draw at home to Werder Bremen left them seventh. Milot Rashica gave Bremen an early lead at Signal Iduna Park, but Germany pair Mario Goetze and Marco Reus both scored with headers to put Dortmund 2-1 up at half-time. However, Werder claimed a point when Marco Friedl poked the ball home ten minutes into the second half. The disappointing draw comes after Dortmund skipper Reus was left fuming after his side leaked a late own goal in last Sunday's 2-2 at mid-table Eintracht Frankfurt. ""We should have had a third goal and conceding their final goal really hurts. We didn't play well,"" said Reus after the Bremen defeat. Borussia Moenchengladbach went fourth as goals from French strikers Alassane Plea and Marcus Thuram sealed a 2-0 victory at Hoffenheim. Bayer Leverkusen are just behind them in fifth thanks to late goals from forwards Kevin Volland and Kai Havertz that added to a Florian Niederlechner's first half own goal in a 3-0 win at Augsburg."

""In the first half, we didn't really know how we were ahead,"" admitted Werner, a few days after extending his contract with the club until 2023. ""We were a bit lucky, but it was good to score the second goal at the very beginning of the second half."" Leipzig, who were drawn in Champions League Group G alongside Zenit Saint-Petersburg, Benfica and Lyon on Thursday, had beaten Union Berlin and Eintracht Frankfurt in their first two games. They continued their strong form as Werner latched onto Emil Forsberg's through ball to slip a shot between the legs of Gladbach goalkeeper Yann Sommer and give the visitors a 38th-minute lead at Borussia Park. Leipzig caught their hosts cold less than two minutes into the second period, as Yussuf Poulsen sent Werner racing in on goal again, and the 23-year-old made no mistake. He made it five goals in just three league appearances in the final minute of added time after Breel Embolo had briefly given the home fans some hope, slotting calmly into the bottom corner after a poor back-header by Matthias Ginter. A first defeat of the season leaves Gladbach seventh on four points. Last season's runners-up Borussia Dortmund will have an opportunity to retake top spot when they visit promoted Union Berlin on Saturday, while reigning champions Bayern Munich host Mainz."
52,18/05/2019,20:59,'Like champions' - Dortmund put brave face on title misery,"Borussia Dortmund CEO Hans-Joachim Watzke has said his team played ""like champions"" after they narrowly missed out on the Bundesliga title on Saturday.","Dortmund beat Borussia Moenchengladbach 2-0, but finished two points behind champions Bayern, who sealed the title with a 5-1 win over Eintracht Frankfurt. It was a bitter end to a brilliant season for Dortmund, who led Bayern by nine points back in December. ""If we had won one more game, we would have been champions,"" said Watzke, and insisted that young stars such as Jadon Sancho can still hope to win trophies at Dortmund. ""This is only the beginning of our development, we saw today how much potential this team has."" ""We will try to keep the pace with Bayern in the coming years."" Captain Marco Reus, meanwhile, could not hide his disappointment. ""We really felt we could win the title today, but Bayern deserved it in the end,"" he said. ""They were a bit better because they have more experience and showed a different mentality on the pitch."" Dortmund picked up their third highest points tally ever in the Bundesliga this season, and coach Lucien Favre said that his team could be ""satisfied"", despite their disappointment. ""It was a very good season with a lot of exciting games,"" he said. ""We conceded some unnecessary goals which proved to be costly, but everything was possible until the end. Players' director Sebastian Kehl also put a positive spin on Dortmund's title anguish. ""We have achieved more than we could have dreamed of at the start of the season,"" he said."
53,18/05/2019,04:30,Five historic last-day Bundesliga title battles,"The Bundesliga title race has gone down to the wire this year, with Bayern Munich just two points ahead of Borussia Dortmund going into the final round of games on Saturday.","Bayern need just a point to seal a seventh straight league crown, but after the twists and turns of recent weeks, Dortmund are hoping to spring one final surprise. It is the first time in ten years that the title race has been decided on the last weekend, as Bayern have dominated the last decade. Yet the Bundesliga has had its fair share of final day drama over the years. Bayern will be crowned German champions for the 29th time if they win on Saturday, but ahead of the final day in 1971, both they and Borussia Moenchengladbach were targeting only a second ever Bundesliga title. Much like this year, Bayern topped the table going into the last day, but Franz Beckenbauer and company succumbed to a shock 2-0 defeat to mid-table Duisburg. Gladbach, meanwhile, beat Frankfurt 4-1 thanks to a brace from future Bayern coach Jupp Heynckes, and became the first team to defend the Bundesliga title. Even if they don't win the title, Dortmund will be hoping to avoid a repeat of the last day in 1978 when they face Gladbach on Saturday. On that day, Gladbach thrashed Dortmund 12-0 as they attempted to overcome a huge goal difference deficit to local rivals and league leaders Cologne. Even that wasn't enough, as Cologne won 5-0 at St. Pauli and took the title by a margin of three goals. In one of the closest title races of all time, three teams were level on points going into the final day in 1992. Eintracht Frankfurt threw away their chance with 2-1 defeat away to Hansa Rostock, while Dortmund were on course to edge it as they led Duisburg 1-0 with five minutes to go. Guido Buchwald's late header in Leverkusen, however, gave Stuttgart a 2-1 victory and the title on goal difference. Bayer Leverkusen came close to a first Bundesliga title themselves eight years later, but lost out to Bayern in the cruellest of circumstances. Three points up and needing only a draw at mid-table Unterhaching, Leverkusen went behind early on thanks to an own-goal from Michael Ballack. They eventually lost 2-0, and Ballack cried his eyes out as Bayern won 3-1 in Bremen to snatch the title from Leverkusen. Few final days have been as emotional as 2001, when Schalke celebrated the title for four minutes, only to have it wrenched away from them by an indirect free-kick. Schalke, who had not won the title since 1958, needed Bayern to lose in Hamburg and to win against Unterhaching in the last ever game at their old Parkstadion. Sergej Barbarez put Hamburg 1-0 up in the 89th minute, and having won 5-3 themselves, Schalke fans stormed the pitch believing they had been crowned champions. Yet minutes later, Patrik Andersson smashed in after an indirect free-kick with the last kick of the game to draw Bayern level, keep the title in Munich and break thousands of Schalke hearts."
54,17/05/2019,16:12,'A lot of unrest' - Leipzig coach Rangnick hoping Bayern lose title,RB Leipzig coach Ralf Rangnick has said that his team will benefit if Bayern Munich surrender the Bundesliga title to Borussia Dortmund on Saturday.,"Bayern go into the final round of games two points ahead of Dortmund, and hope to wrap up a seventh straight title before they face Leipzig in the German Cup final in Berlin next weekend. ""If Bayern were to lose out on the title from the good position they are in, then it would lead to a lot of unrest,"" Rangnick told AFP subsidiary SID on Friday. ""In terms of preparation for the cup final, that certainly wouldn't be an advantage for them."" Bayern will be crowned champions unless they lose at home to Frankfurt and Dortmund beat Borussia Moenchengladbach on Saturday. Leipzig, meanwhile, hope to ruin Bayern's domestic double hopes and secure the first major trophy of their 10-year history in Berlin on May 25."
55,17/05/2019,02:10,"Favre, Kovac face old friends as Bundesliga finale grips Germany",Bayern Munich coach Niko Kovac and his Borussia Dortmund counterpart Lucien Favre both face a trip down memory lane on Saturday as the Bundesliga braces itself for the most nail-biting season finale in years.,"Both Kovac and Favre will face their former clubs on a much-anticipated final day, as the title race goes down to the last weekend of the season for the first time since 2010. Bayern currently sit two points ahead of Dortmund, and can claim a seventh straight league crown if they avoid defeat at home by Kovac's old club Eintracht Frankfurt on Saturday. Dortmund, meanwhile, travel to Favre's old hunting ground at Borussia Moenchengladbach, knowing that they can only be crowned champions if they win and Bayern lose. ""We need to focus on our game,"" said Favre on Thursday, adding that Dortmund needed to be prepared for all eventualities against Gladbach, whom he coached between 2011 and 2015. ""They play well on the counter-attack, but they can also press high up the pitch, and they need to win too,"" he said. There is more than the title at stake on Saturday, with both Gladbach and Frankfurt still in the running for Champions League qualification. Dortmund sporting director Michael Zorc joked on Thursday that he would not send Frankfurt a crate of beer if they beat Bayern. ""They have something to play for, so they don't need any extra motivation,"" he said. Zorc admitted that Bayern were in ""pole position"", but confirmed that the club were making plans for a potential title celebration in the Dortmund town centre. ""We are hugely looking forward to the game, and the excitement will rise when we are on the way to the stadium, those are nice moments,"" he said. Bayern coach Kovac said on Thursday that he was proud to be on the verge of the title, having trailed Dortmund by nine points in December. ""In winter, we just hoped we would have any chance at all on the final day, and now we are in the comfortable situation of having it in our own hands,"" he said. The Croatian said he was expecting an emotional afternoon on Saturday, when his old club Frankfurt come to Munich. Bayern have not won the title in front of their own fans since 2000, and are preparing to bid farewell to club icons Arjen Robben and Franck Ribery. ""There hasn't been a situation like this in Munich for a while, and we want to bring the fans with us on Saturday,"" he said. Kovac, who steered Frankfurt away from relegation in 2016 before leading them to glory in the German Cup last season, said that the pressure to win the title was nothing compared to a relegation fight. ""When you are fighting for your existence, that is something different,"" he said. Yet the under-fire coach knows that Saturday's meeting with his Frankfurt past could yet define his Bayern future. Rumours that Kovac is on the verge of the sack have increased in the build-up to the Frankfurt game, but the Croatian was philosophical on Thursday. ""I like the job but I am also independent. I have always been a fighter and have never given up,"" he said. With Saturday's title decider and next weekend's German Cup final against RB Leipzig, Kovac has two chances to win silverware in the next week, and is determined to take both of them. ""We must win trophies,"" he said."
56,16/05/2019,13:39,'Everything is possible' - Dortmund boss Favre,"Borussia Dortmund coach Lucien Favre says ""everything is possible"" as his side prepare to make one desperate final bid for the Bundesliga title against Borussia Moenchengladbach on Saturday.","Dortmund are two points behind league leaders Bayern Munich ahead of the last day of the season, and can only be crowned champions on Saturday if they beat Gladbach and Bayern lose at home to Eintracht Frankfurt. Gladbach and Frankfurt also have much to play for, with both clubs still in the race for Champions League qualification. ""The league is exciting until the end this year, and that is good for the Bundesliga,"" said Favre at the pre-match press conference on Thursday. ""Everything is possible but I don't want to talk about (our title chances). We have to concentrate on our game."" Sporting director Michael Zorc said that Dortmund were proud to have kept the title race alive until the last day, but admitted that his team had only an outside chance of snatching the title. ""We know that Bayern are in pole position,"" he said."
57,11/05/2019,18:02,Dortmund take title race to wire as Bayern held,Bayern Munich missed the chance to wrap up a seventh successive Bundesliga title as they were held to a goalless draw at RB Leipzig on Saturday and rivals Borussia Dortmund edged a nervy 3-2 win over Fortuna Duesseldorf.,"Chelsea-bound US international Christian Pulisic found the net in his final home game for Dortmund, helping them to battle back to within two points of league leaders Bayern ahead of the final round of games next weekend. Bayern can now secure the title with a win at home to Eintracht Frankfurt next Saturday, while Dortmund must win at Borussia Moenchengladbach. Dortmund, who looked dead and buried after slipping four points behind last week, enjoyed the rub of the green as they stumbled to victory over Duesseldorf. Pulisic, who will join Chelsea next season, bid an emotional farewell to the Dortmund fans before the game and then opened the scoring on 41 minutes. A howler from stand-in goalkeeper Marwin Hitz allowed Oliver Fink to equalise, but Thomas Delaney restored the lead for Dortmund. Hitz then gave away a penalty with a foul on Dodi Lukebakio, but the Belgian dragged the ball wide from 12 yards. Mario Goetze appeared to seal the win for Dortmund on 90 minutes, but Dawid Kownacki pulled one back for Duesseldorf minutes later to make it a nerve-jangling finish for the hosts. In Leipzig, Leon Goretzka's stylish scissor-kick sent Bayern into ecstasy after half-time, but the goal was ruled out by VAR. Serge Gnabry hit the bar later in the second half, but Bayern could not force the winner. At the other end of the table, Nuremberg and Hanover were finally relegated as Stuttgart secured the relegation play-off place with a 3-0 win over Wolfsburg. Hanover went down fighting as goals from Waldemar Anton, Ihlas Bebou and Walace saw them beat Freiburg 3-0. Yet Anastasios Donis, Gonzalo Castro and Daniel Didavi were on the mark for Stuttgart to condemn Hanover and Nuremberg to the drop. Nuremberg, meanwhile, suffered a 4-0 defeat to Borussia Moenchengladbach thanks to an own-goal from Lukas Muehl and strikes from Thorgan Hazard, Denis Zakaria and former Nuremberg man Josip Drmic. The thumping win sees Gladbach go fourth overnight, leapfrogging both Eintracht Frankfurt and Bayer Leverkusen, who were held to a 1-1 draw at home to Schalke, Guido Burgstaller cancelling out Kai Havertz's opener. Frankfurt have the chance to break back into the top four with a win over Mainz on Sunday. Werder Bremen also kept their European hopes alive with a 1-0 win over Hoffenheim, and Hertha Berlin snatched a late 4-3 victory away to Augsburg. Johannes Eggestein's first-half goal condemned RB Leipzig-bound coach Julian Nagelsmann to defeat in his last home game in charge of Hoffenheim. Andre Hahn and Michael Gregoritsch put Augsburg ahead three times but goals from Marvin Plattenhardt and Marko Grujic kept Hertha in the game before a late brace from Salomon Kalou secured three points."
58,04/05/2019,21:00,Dortmund collapse leaves Bayern on brink of seventh successive title,Borussia Dortmund coach Lucien Favre defended goalkeeper Roman Buerki after his second-half howler saw Dortmund throw away a two-goal lead to draw 2-2 with Werder Bremen and left Bayern Munich on the brink of a seventh successive Bundesliga title.,"""I am not going to talk about Roman. Whatever happens, he has had a fantastic season and has saved us a lot of points in the past,"" Favre told Sky. Buerki's error and a goal from Claudio Pizarro all but ended Dortmund's title challenge and sealed a perfect afternoon for Bayern, after club stalwarts Franck Ribery and Arjen Robben earlier returned from injury to help them to a 3-1 victory over bottom club Hanover. Dortmund, who were nine points ahead of Bayern in December, must now make up a four-point deficit in the last two games of the season. ""We have to win our last home game next week, that is our only hope,"" said Favre. Christian Pulisic opened the scoring for Dortmund after just six minutes with a brilliant solo goal, before Paco Alcacer doubled the lead with a fizzing free-kick. With Dortmund in full control on 70 minutes, Buerki allowed Bremen back into the game when he let Kevin Moehwald's tame shot through his legs, and former Bayern star Pizarro scored a shock equaliser moments later. ""If we can help Bayern, why not?"" a smiling Pizarro told Sky. In Munich, Robben and Ribery, both of whom are set to leave Bayern at the end of the season, came off the bench to make their first appearance together in 2019. Ribery scored what may be his last ever goal at the Allianz Arena, while Robben, who had not played since November, told Sky that his cameo appearance was not the end of his Bayern journey. ""I always said I didn't want to come back just to wave to the fans and say goodbye. There are two games left and the German Cup final, so there is more to come,"" he said. Hanover kept Bayern at bay for nearly half an hour before Robert Lewandowski headed the hosts ahead from close range and Leon Goretzka curled the second in off the post. The visitors hit back after half-time with a Jonathas penalty, the result of a highly controversial handball decision from VAR against Jerome Boateng. Ribery secured the win with a deflected shot six minutes from time. Bayern now need just one win from their last two games against top four sides RB Leipzig and Eintracht Frankfurt. Elsewhere, Borussia Moenchengladbach and Hoffenheim both stumbled in the race for the top four, as they shared the points in a 2-2 draw. Matthias Ginter cancelled out Pavel Kaderabek's opener, before Nadiem Amiri restored the lead with a fine volley. Josip Drmic saved Gladbach's Champions League hopes with a late equaliser. Wolfsburg also remain in the hunt for a top four place after goals from Felix Klaus and Marcel Tisserand saw them beat second-from-bottom Nuremberg 2-0. Both Nuremberg and Hanover were spared relegation for at least another week, however, as Hertha Berlin won 3-1 at home to Stuttgart, who remain in the relegation play-off place. Goals from Vedad Ibisevic, Ondrej Duda and Salomon Kalou sealed the win for Hertha, despite a late consolation header from Mario Gomez."
59,13/04/2019,17:38,Raffael puts Gladbach back in the race for top four,A second-half winner from Brazilian striker Raffael gave Borussia Moenchengladbach a 1-0 win over Hanover on Saturday and fresh hope of a top four finish in the Bundesliga.,"Gladbach have endured a turbulent few weeks of late, having dropped out of the top four and announced the impending departure of coach Dieter Hecking. The win over Hanover, only their second victory in nine games, marked a timely change in fortunes and keeps Gladbach in the race for Champions League football. They now sit in fifth, a point behind Eintracht Frankfurt, who play Augsburg on Sunday. Raffael grabbed the winner just after half-time, flicking a loose ball over the head of Hanover keeper Michael Esser. Bottom-of-the-table Hanover created little more than a handful of half-chances on the counter-attack, and failed to add to their meagre tally of 11 home goals this season. RB Leipzig, meanwhile, strengthened their grip on third with a comfortable win over Wolfsburg. Kevin Kampl curled in the opener on 16 minutes, before Timo Werner headed in a second to notch his third goal in four games. Defeat is a setback for Wolfsburg, whose fellow European hopefuls Bremen and Leverkusen both won on Saturday. Bremen snuck into a Europa League place thanks to a 2-1 win over Freiburg. Late headers from in-form Dutch midfielder Davy Klaassen and Theodor Gebre Selassie sealed the three points for the home side, despite Luca Waldschmidt's even later consolation goal for Freiburg. Leverkusen, meanwhile, battled to a 1-0 victory over relegation-threatened Stuttgart. Stuttgart keeper Ron-Robert Zieler kept out Kevin Volland with a brilliant reflex save before half-time, but could not stop Kai Havertz's coolly taken penalty just after the hour mark. Tempers flared late on as Stuttgart's Santiago Ascacibar clashed with Havertz and was sent off. Leverkusen sit between Bremen and Wolfsburg in seventh in what is proving to be a thrilling race for Europe. A single point separates Bremen in sixth from ninth-placed Hoffenheim, who play Hertha Berlin on Sunday."
60,10/04/2019,14:31,Salzburg coach Marco Rose to join Gladbach for next season,Red Bull Salzburg coach Marco Rose has announced that he will leave the club at the end of the season to take over German Bundesliga side Borussia Moenchengladbach.,"The German coach confirmed that he would sign a three-year contract at Gladbach, who announced the imminent departure of current coach Dieter Hecking last week. Rose, 42, had been linked with several Bundesliga clubs in recent months, with Gladbach and Wolfsburg foremost among them. ""I didn't just get one request, I got quite a few,"" he admitted at a press conference on Wednesday. ""I have decided to take on a new challenge in the Bundesliga, which I am really looking forward to. ""Borussia is a great club with big ambitions and a great fan culture. Those are all things which attracted me."" Rose has been in charge of the first team at Salzburg since 2017, winning the Austrian league and cup double and reaching the semi-finals of the UEFA Europa League in his first season. Previously, he was in charge of the club's Under-18 team. ""Marco Rose has done incredible work at Salzburg in the last six years, and we are happy that he will join us next season,"" said Gladbach sporting director Max Eberl. At a press conference last week, Eberl announced that Gladbach would be parting ways with Hecking as coach after a poor run of form saw the club drop out of the Bundesliga top four."
61,07/04/2019,20:20,Klaassen equaliser deepens Gladbach gloom,Davy Klaassen's late equaliser rescued a 1-1 draw for Werder Bremen at Borussia Moenchengladbach on Sunday as Bremen extended their unbeaten run to 11 league games.,"The Dutch midfielder's 79th minute header was a cruel blow for Gladbach, who had looked on track to end their recent run of poor form with a hard-fought win. ""It was important to bring a bit of emotion onto the pitch today, and we did that and got the fans behind us,"" Gladbach midfielder Christoph Kramer. ""A point is no use to us really, but the way we played was a good sign after our bloodless performances in recent weeks."" Gladbach dropped out of the top four last weekend, after which it was announced that coach Dieter Hecking would leave the club at the end of the season. They have won just one of their last seven games, and are three points adrift of fourth-placed Eintracht Frankfurt in the chase for a Champions League spot. Florian Neuhaus' opener just after half-time breathed life into what had been a dreary game. A mistake by Bremen captain Max Kruse allowed Gladbach to counter-attack, and the 22-year-old rounded the goalkeeper and finished from a tight angle. Yet with 11 minutes to go, Yuya Osako picked out Klaassen, who sent a powerful header past Gladbach goalkeeper Yann Sommer. The draw crowns a successful week for Bremen, who won their German Cup quarter-final in midweek to set up a semi-final tie with Bayern Munich later this month. They are eighth in the Bundesliga, one point behind Hoffenheim, who thrashed Augsburg 4-0 in Sunday's early game. A second-half hat-trick from Ishak Belfodil left Hoffenheim just one point behind the Europa League places, hot on the heels of Wolfsburg and Borussia Moenchengladbach. Coach Julian Nagelsmann, 31, has repeatedly spoken of his desire to guide the club back into European competition before he leaves for RB Leipzig this summer, and Belfodil's star performance moved Hoffenheim a step closer on Sunday. ""We still need to win all our games because the teams above us have been unbelievably consistent this year,"" Nagelsmann told Sky. Andrej Kramaric scored his 15th goal of the season to give the visitors an early lead, sweeping the ball in on the rebound after Belfodil had forced a save from Augsburg goalkeeper Gregor Kobel. Kobel later denied Kramaric with a stunning reflex save, but he could do nothing to stop Belfodil's diving header just after the hour mark. Belfodil added another on 74 minutes, breaking away on the counter-attack and finding the bottom corner with a smart finish. The Algerian completed his hat-trick with an almost identical goal eight minutes from time."
62,02/04/2019,15:44,Moenchengladbach coach Hecking to leave club in summer,"Borussia Moenchengladbach head coach Dieter Hecking will step down at the end of this season, the club announced on Tuesday.","""We will go into the 2019/20 season with a new head coach,"" the club announced in a statement on its website. Hecking, 54, has won just one of his last seven games in charge of Gladbach, in a run of poor form which has seen them drop out of the top four. He said that he had been informed of the club's decision on Monday, two days after a humiliating 3-1 defeat to local rivals Fortuna Duesseldorf. ""I was very disappointed yesterday, and I still am today,"" he said at a press conference on Tuesday. ""As a coach, you know that there will be days when everything looks great and the sun is shining. Today is a rainy day."" Hecking has been in charge of Gladbach since December 2016, and led them to ninth-place finishes in each of his first two seasons. After some brilliant early-season performances, Gladbach had spent much of the current campaign in the top three, but a recent run of bad form has seen them drop to fifth. Yet Gladbach sporting director Max Eberl insisted that the decision had been made with the club's long term strategy in mind, rather than on the basis of bad results. ""It was very, very hard for me to inform Dieter of our decision,"" he said. Eberl refused to speculate on who would replace Hecking at the end of the season amid reports that Red Bull Salzburg coach Marco Rose may be in line to take the reins. ""I have an idea in the back of my mind, clearly,"" said Eberl. ""We are in talks, but there is no final agreement yet. We will let you know when we have an announcement to make."" In the meantime, Hecking will stay at Gladbach for the last seven games of the season as the club bid to get back into the top four. ""I would be very happy if I could leave the club in the Champions League,"" he said."
63,15/03/2019,22:43,Gladbach suffer setback in Champions League quest,Borussia Moenchengladbach suffered another setback in their bid to qualify for next season's Champions League as they were held to a 1-1 home draw by Freiburg on Friday.,"Dieter Hecking's side had been on the heels of leaders Borussia Dortmund and Bayern Munich before the winter break, but have now failed to win in five of their last six matches. The point does take Gladbach back above RB Leipzig, who visit struggling Schalke on Saturday, into third. But Eintracht Frankfurt are only four points behind the Foals in fifth, with Bayer Leverkusen one further back and both teams still to play this weekend. Gladbach fell behind early against Freiburg as Italian midfielder Vincenzo Grifo gave the visitors a 10th-minute lead. Former Nice striker Alassane Plea equalised just six minutes later with his 14th goal of the season, but Gladbach needed a fine save from goalkeeper Yann Sommer to deny Grifo to secure only a point. Dortmund visit Hertha Berlin on Saturday, looking to retake top spot from their title rivals Bayern Munich after the Bavarians moved ahead on goal difference last weekend."
64,09/03/2019,20:39,'Perfect day' as Bayern return to Bundesliga summit with Liverpool looming,"Bayern Munich warmed up for Liverpool with a ""perfect day"" by knocking Borussia Dortmund from the top of the Bundesliga for the first time since September with a 6-0 thrashing of Wolfsburg on Saturday.","Bayern, who host Liverpool on Wednesday in their Champions League, last 16, return leg clash after a goalless draw at Anfield, went top on goal difference from Dortmund, who needed late goals to win 3-1 at home to Stuttgart. ""I'm very pleased. We want to be just as focused on Wednesday,"" said Bayern head coach Niko Kovac. Bayern ran riot in Munich as Robert Lewandowski scored twice, leaving him with 20 goals in 17 league games against Wolfsburg, while Serge Gnabry, James Rodriguez and Joshua Kimmich also netted. ""We are now where we want to be -- first in the table and that's where we want to stay,"" added Kovac with nine rounds of league games left. Having been told on Tuesday, along with Bayern team-mates Jerome Boateng and Mats Hummels, that his Germany career is over, Mueller took out his frustration, setting up the first goal and scoring Munich's second. ""The three wanted to give a response and they all played well -- it was a perfect afternoon,"" said goal-scorer Kimmich. Gnabry gave Bayern the lead on 34 minutes at the Allianz Arena by tapping home Mueller's cross, then turned provider three minutes later when he served up a simple tap in for Lewandowski to make it 2-0. Rodriguez, thriving in the attacking midfield role, got on the scoresheet when his superb 52nd-minute shot hit the top corner. Having set up the first goal, Mueller showed Germany head coach Joachim Loew what he is missing by wrong-footing Wolfsburg goalkeeper Koen Casteels to score with his heel on 76 minutes. Kimmich scored with a header on 82 minutes and Lewandowski claimed his second by guiding his header into the far corner three minutes later. Lewandowski, the top-scoring foreigner in Bundesliga history with 197 goals, has now scored in each of his last seven games against Wolfsburg, who he single-handedly battered in 2015 with five goals in just nine minutes. In Dortmund, late goals by Paco Alcacer and Chelsea-bound Christian Pulisic saw off dogged Stuttgart, but Borussia are now second after 23 weeks on top. ""I don't care about who is top now,"" said Dortmund captain Marco Reus. ""It only matters who is top at the end and everything is still open."" The win, only Dortmund's second in their last nine games, was vital to stay level on 57 points with Bayern. Despite some dogged Stuttgart defending, Dortmund took the lead at Signal Iduna Park when Reus netted a penalty on 62 minutes. The lead lasted just nine minutes as Stuttgart's Marc-Oliver Kempf headed home unmarked. However, Alcacer calmed nerves when the Spanish striker stabbed home on 84 minutes after a goal-mouth scramble. The third goal came when Axel Witsel beat three defenders, played Mario Goetze into the box to set up Pulisic, who netted in stoppage time. ""They parked a gigantic bus (in front of goal) -- it was hard to find the holes,"" complained Dortmund coach Lucien Favre. ""We tried everything and managed it, we ran a lot and defended a lot, but all in all, the win was deserved."" Third-placed RB Leipzig were held to a goalless draw at home by Augsburg, who beat Dortmund last Friday and went down fighting against Bayern last month. Mid-table Hertha Berlin crashed to a 2-1 defeat at Freiburg after the visitors captain Vedad Ibisevic cancelled out a Nils Petersen goal, but then scored an own-goal by turning the ball into the Berlin net. Later, Borussia Moenchengladbach bounced back from last weekend's 5-1 thumping at home to Bayern with a 1-0 win at mid-table Mainz, thanks to a second-half goal from defender Nico Elvedi. Gladbach stay fourth, level on 47 points with Leipzig, and both clubs lag nine points behind new leaders Bayern and Dortmund."
65,02/03/2019,20:43,Bayern blitz Gladbach to draw level with Dortmund in title race,Defending champions Bayern Munich drew level at the top of the Bundesliga on points alongside leaders Borussia Dortmund on Saturday with a 5-1 thrashing of Borussia Moenchengladbach.,"After Dortmund stumbled to a shock 2-1 defeat at Augsburg on Friday, Bayern seized their chance as Robert Lewandowski scored twice with Javi Martinez, Thomas Mueller and Serge Gnabry also netting. This was Bayern's 11th win in 12 league games, a run which has allowed them to erode the nine-point lead Dortmund held in December with only a goal difference of two now separating the sides, both on 54 points. Despite illness and injury hitting their squad, Bayern needed just two minutes to take the lead at Borussia Park when midfielder Martinez headed home from a corner. Mueller made it 2-0 after 11 minutes by tapping home a Gnabry cross. Gladbach briefly rallied when their captain Lars Stindl pulled a goal back eight minutes from the break after Thorgan Hazard poked the ball through Niklas Suele's legs for his skipper to fire home. However, Lewandowski made sure of the win after he converted a dream pass from Thiago Alcantara to smash the ball high into the net on 47 minutes. Gnabry added Bayern's fourth before Lewandowski netted a late penalty for his 195th Bundesliga goal -- making him the league's joint top-scoring foreign player alongside Werder Bremen's 40-year-old Peru striker Claudio Pizzaro. The result avenged Bayern's shock 3-0 defeat to Gladbach in Munich in October. Earlier, Schalke crashed 4-0 at home to Fortuna Duesseldorf to increase pressure on head coach Domenico Tedesco, who insisted - ""I'm not one to just piss off"". Director of sport Christian Heidel resigned after last weekend's 3-0 defeat at Mainz and the first job of his replacement Jochen Schneider, who starts work Tuesday, could be to sack Tedesco. ""The sports director has not started yet, he will say something on Tuesday,"" said Schalke chairman Clemens Toennies after defeat at the Veltins Arena left them 14th -- seven points from the relegation places. Schalke face Manchester City away on March 12 in the Champions League last 16 looking to overturn a 3-2 defeat from the first leg, but Tedesco could be gone before then following their 13th defeat in 24 league games. Duesseldorf ran riot as their Polish striker Dawid Kownacki scored his first two goals in only his third Bundesliga match. Elsewhere, RB Leipzig squeezed past bottom side Nuremberg with a 1-0 away win to move up to third. Leipzig knocked Gladbach down to fourth after surviving a first-half scare at Nuremberg, whose midfielder Hannes Behrens hit the crossbar with a penalty attempt before defender Lukas Klostermann scored RB's winnner from a corner. Eintracht Frankfurt, who face Inter Milan in the last 16 of the Europa League on Thursday, moved up to fifth with a 3-2 win at home to ten-man Hoffenheim thanks to a headed 96th-minute goal by substitute striker Goncalo Paciencia. The Portugal forward came on with 10 minutes left to break the hearts of Hoffenheim, who had been 2-1 up before playing the last 25 minutes with ten men after Ghana defender Kasim Adams received a second yellow card. Frenchman Sebastian Haller headed Frankfurt level on 89 minutes before Paciencia's dramatic late winner. Defender Niklas Stark made amends for an own goal just after the break against Mainz to net Hertha Berlin's winning goal in their 2-1 home victory after Marko Grujic, on loan from Liverpool, had equalised at the Olympic Stadium. Bayer Leverkusen climbed to sixth, among the Europa League places, after running out 2-0 winners over mid-table Freiburg thanks to goals by Chile's Charles Aranguiz and Jamaica winger Leon Bailey."
66,01/03/2019,17:35,Injury-hit Bayern lack the joy of six at Gladbach,Bayern Munich's strength in depth will be tested at Borussia Moenchengladbach this Saturday with six of their star-studded squad sidelined.,"There is some good news for second-placed Bayern, who are three points behind leaders Borussia Dortmund after winning 10 of their last 11 league games as captain and goalkeeper Manuel Neuer and defender Mats Hummels have shaken off illness. However, David Alaba and Leon Goretzka both dropped out on Friday with leg injuries, joining Franck Ribery, Arjen Robben, Kingsley Coman and Corentin Tolisso on the casualty list. At most other clubs, six players out would be classed an 'injury crisis', but Bayern have the personnel to absorb the casualties and look for revenge at Borussia Park, having lost 3-0 at home to Gladbach in October. ""We are in a good phase, but we have to defend well and also react up front,"" said head coach Niko Kovac, who took the mounting injuries in his stride and has promoted three members of the reserves including 19-year-old Jeong Woo-yeang. The South Korean junior international could make his Bundesliga debut at Gladbach having already made his Champions League debut as a replacement in last November's 5-1 thumping of Benfica. Kovac wants a win at fourth-placed Gladbach to keep the pressure on Dortmund, who play at Augsburg on Friday, ""we definitely need the three points"", but the hosts have injury woes of their own with forwards Ibrahima Traore and Josip Drmic ruled out. After nine straight wins at home this season, Moenchengladbach have suffered 3-0 home defeats at Borussia Park to both Hertha Berlin and Wolfsburg in their last three games. However, Kovac is taking nothing for granted, ""we won't underestimate them, everyone picks up a few dents"". Gladbach last tasted victory with a 2-0 win at Schalke at the start of February, but are refusing to panic. ""There are such phases, we have no need to be unsure of ourselves or to act defiantly,"" said Gladbach's 54-year-old head coach Dieter Hecking. ""We don't have to question everything now, we need to keep calm and remain convinced of what we are doing."""

They were made to pay for their wastefulness when Frankfurt, also chasing European football next season, went in at the break with a 1-0 lead. Frankfurt launched a counter in injury time, catching Gladbach off guard from a corner. After receiving the ball on the edge of the box, Jonathan de Guzman miscued a shot on goal. The ball, however, was collected by Danny da Costa who hammered home from close range. The second half looked much like the first, with Gladbach pressing and Hazard spurning chance after chance. But they finally broke through in the 82nd minute, with Denis Zakaria latching on to a 30-metre Tobias Strobl pass to score past the outstretched hands of Frankfurt keeper Kevin Trapp. Frankfurt, who looked clearly fatigued after a mid-week trip to Ukraine in the Europa League, were fortunate to hold on and grab a valuable point in the closing stages."

""We took our time to find the gaps, but after we changed ends and went 2-0 up it was much easier,"" said Dortmund coach Lucien Favre after his side floored Hanover with three goals in seven minutes. Achraf Hakimi, on loan from Real Madrid, Reus, Mario Goetze and Raphael Guerreiro scored Dortmund's goals to keep them on course for their first Bundesliga title since 2012. The rout piles pressure on Hanover coach Andre Breitenreiter, but his side showed spirit when Marvin Bakalorz scored a late consolation against his former club before Witsel grabbed Dortmund's fifth goal on 90 minutes. ""It's up to others in the club to decide now where we go from here,"" said Breitenreiter, who helped Hanover win promotion back to the Bundesliga last season. ""This isn't about me -- it's about staying up."" Hanover started brightly at Dortmund's Signal Iduna Park when forward Henrick Weydandt forcing an early save, but it was one-way traffic thereafter as Reus hit the post on 23 minutes. Soon after, Dortmund left-back Hakimi swapped passes with Guerreiro on the edge of the area and curled his shot inside the post for the opening goal. Reus had an injury scare just before the break, clashing heads with Danish midfielder Thomas Delaney as both charged into a challenge. However, the pair shook off the collision and Reus was instrumental in a flurry of goals just after the hour mark. It started with text book counter-pressing when Hakimi robbed Hanover defender Miiko Albornoz on the edge of the box and squared to Reus who fired home his 12th league goal in 18 games. Mario Goetze claimed his second goal of the season when a sublime pass from Jadon Sancho found the Dortmund striker was unmarked to fire home. Reus set up Dortmund's fourth, cutting through the Hanover defence and passed to Guerreiro who netted with the defence cut to ribbons. The game had already turned into a rout even before a glove from Hanover goalkeeper Michael Esser denied Reus, then Sancho in quick succession. Bakalorz scored Hanover's consolation before Witsel found a gap in the defence and his shot went in off the post for his second goal in a week after netting the winner at Leipzig last weekend. Borussia Moenchengladbach joined Bayern on 39 points, but went second on goal difference with a 2-0 win at home to Augsburg. Gladbach midfielder Jonas Hofmann, linked with a move to Tottenham Hotspur, had a penalty saved just before the break before Oscar Wendt and Patrick Herrmann scored second-half goals. Bayer Leverkusen claimed their first win under new coach Peter Bosz when Germany internationals Kai Havertz, Kevin Volland and Julian Brandt netted their goals in a 3-0 victory at Wolfsburg. Hoffenheim moved into the top six with a 4-2 win at Freiburg as Andrej Kramaric scored twice while mid-table Mainz won 2-1 at home to bottom side Nuremberg with Sweden striker Robin Quaison scoring the winner. On Saturday night, Eintracht Frankfurt climbed into the top four with a 2-2 draw at Werder Bremen as striker Sebastian Haller equalised with a second-half penalty for the visitors. RB Leipzig can regain fourth place by avoiding defeat at Fortuna Duesseldorf on Sunday evening."
70,19/01/2019,17:55,Gladbach stay in Bundesliga title race with win at Leverkusen,Borussia Moenchengladbach kept pace with Borussia Dortmund and Bayern Munich in the Bundesliga title race on Saturday with Alassane Plea netting in their 1-0 win at Bayer Leverkusen.,"Defending champions Bayern halved Dortmund's lead to three points on Friday with an impressive 3-1 win at Hoffenheim before Dortmund face a tricky away clash at fourth-placed RB Leipzig later Saturday. Third-placed Gladbach, who are enjoying one of their best seasons, deserved their win at Leverkusen, whose coach Peter Bosz took charge of his first Bundesliga game after replacing Heiko Herrlich last month. On the first weekend of the Bundesliga after the winter break, Gladbach breached Leverkusen's defence when captain Lars Stindl split the defence with a superb pass before Plea fired home his tenth goal this season eight minutes before the break. Leverkusen had second-half chances as their Germany teenage international Kai Havertz fired wide, Karim Bellarabi hit the post and Jamaica winger Leon Bailey had a penalty appeal turned down. Plea, 25, has been a revelation on the road for Gladbach since joining from Nice last July with eight of his league goals so far having been scored away from home. The away win leaves Gladbach three points behind Bayern and six adrift of Dortmund. Elsewhere, Eintracht Frankfurt climbed to fifth, a point from the Champions League berths, with a 3-1 win at home to Freiburg as striker Luka Jovic claimed his 13th goal this season to become the league's top-scorer. A header by Sebastian Haller gave Frankfurt the lead on 34 minutes before the hosts pulled away with two superb goals. Croatia forward Ante Rebic beat three defenders with a dramatic change of direction, which created space to curl his shot into the goal on 40 minutes. Jovic, who scored five goals in one league game in October, added Frankfurt's third just before the break before Nils Petersen pulled a goal back from Freiburg in the second half. Werder Bremen climbed to eighth with a 1-0 win at Hanover as Kosovo striker Milot Rashica scored the winner by finishing off a move started by captain Max Kruse. Stuttgart remain in the relegation places after a 3-2 defeat at home to Mainz. Mainz built up a 3-0 lead with an own goal by Stuttgart defender Santiago Ascacibar before striker Jean-Philippe Mateta and defender Alexander Hack netted. However, Stuttgart roared back with two goals in the final seven minutes from Nicolas Gonzalez and Marc Oliver Kempf before Anastasios Donis hit the post in a dramatic finish. Fortuna Duesseldorf, who last month stunned Dortmund 2-1 and drew 3-3 at Bayern, are now six games unbeaten after a 2-1 win at Augsburg with Benito Raman scoring the winning goal in the 90th minute."

An examination has revealed torn ligaments in the left ankle, ruling him out of the finals in Russia, which kick-off on June 14. ""To injure yourself so badly at this time is very hard,"" said Stindl on crutches in Moenchengladbach with his foot in a cast on Sunday. ""For one thing, I can't help the (Moenchengladbach) team in an important part of the season, on the other, it is bitter that my World Cup dream is over."" Stindl, who scored the winning goal in last July's Confederations Cup final in St Petersburg, is the latest Germany international to have had his World Cup dreams dashed. Hoffenheim's ex-Arsenal winger Serge Gnabry was also ruled out on Friday after tearing his groin against Hanover. While Stindl and Gnabry are out of World Cup contention, Bayern Munich stars Manuel Neuer and Jerome Boateng are battling to be fit. Boateng picked up a groin injury against Real Madrid last Wednesday, while Neuer has missed the last seven months recovering from a fractured metatarsal. Head coach Germany Loew will name Germany's World Cup squad on May 15. Loew has said he is planning on Neuer, Germany's captain and star goalkeeper, being involved for their pre-World Cup camp from May 23 to June 7 in northern Italy. ""Of course he will have to catch up a bit,"" commented Loew, with Neuer having last played in September. Germany begin their defence of the World Cup title against Mexico in Moscow on June 17."

""I think it's a torn ligament,"" Stindl told broadcaster Sport1 before heading to hospital. Gladbach sporting director Max Eberl was, however, more optimistic after the X-ray. ""At least he hasn't broken anything,"" he said. ""Lars' injury was bitter, because he's a really important player for us,"" said teammate Matthias Ginter. Stindl, 29, has made 11 appearances for world champions Germany since making his debut last June, and was hoping to be included in the squad which national team coach Joachim Loew will announce on May 15. He now joins Bayern Munich stars Manuel Neuer and Jerome Boateng on a growing injury list for Loew and Germany. Boateng picked up a groin injury against Real Madrid last Wednesday, while Neuer has missed the last seven months recovering from a fractured metatarsal. They and Stindl now face a race against time to be fit for Germany's World Cup opener against Mexico in Moscow on June 17."
73,14/04/2018,20:51,Treble-chasing Bayern thrash Gladbach,Sandro Wagner netted twice as treble-chasing Bundesliga champions Bayern Munich ran riot in a 5-1 win at home to Borussia Moenchengladbach on Saturday.,"After securing a sixth straight German league title last weekend and booking a Champions League semi-final place in midweek, this was another dominant display from Bayern, who have a German Cup semi-final at Leverkusen on Tuesday. Jupp Heynckes' Bavarians are the only top European team who can still win the treble this season. Gladbach, who beat Bayern 2-1 at Borussia Park last November, silenced the crowd when Josip Drmic cut inside defender Niklas Suele to fire home with nine minutes gone. Conceding an early goal at Munich's Allianz Arena is like a red rag to the bull for Bayern. Wagner tapped home their opening goal after good work from Thomas Mueller on 37 minutes, then added a second with a superb header four minutes later. Wagner, the back-up at Bayern for star striker Robert Lewandowski who was on the bench, has scored seven goals in his last eight games. Bayern promptly increased their lead on 51 minutes as Thiago Alcantara drilled home the rebound after Gladbach goalkeeper Yann Sommer blocked an attempt from Wagner. Gladbach had appeals for a penalty turned down when Juan Bernat brought down Denis Zakaria in the area. Left-back David Alaba, returning from a back injury, scored Bayern's fourth from outside the area on 67 minutes with a fierce shot off his right foot. Not to be outdone Lewandowski, sporting a black eye from Wednesday's Champions League clash against Sevilla, came on for Wagner to score Bayern's fifth. The Poland striker hit his 36th goal this season by burying Joshua Kimmich's cross into the bottom corner eight minutes from time. The emphatic victory leaves Bayern a massive 23 points clear in the table with second-placed Schalke hosting Borussia Dortmund on Sunday in the Ruhr derby. Earlier, Niko Kovac insisted Eintracht Frankfurt won't use his appointment as Bayern coach for next season as an excuse, despite their 4-1 thrashing at Bayer Leverkusen. Frankfurt's plans for next season were thrown into chaos on Friday when Bayern confirmed Kovac, 46, will join them to replace Heynckes as coach in 2018/19. ""Trainers and players come and go, my team will not use this as an excuse,"" said Kovac. ""Everyone is professional enough, because we know we can achieve a European place next year - I am convinced of that."" However, the performance at the BayArena did not back up Kovac's words as Frankfurt's Champions League hopes suffered a heavy blow. This was the first time this season Frankfurt have conceded four goals. Germany hopeful Kevin Volland boosted his chances of making Joachim Loew's World Cup squad, to be named on May 15, with a hat-trick for Leverkusen. The thrashing left Frankfurt sixth, five points from fourth-placed Leverkusen -- and a Champions League place -- with four games left. Germany international Julian Brandt headed Leverkusen ahead on 20 minutes. Frankfurt drew level three minutes later through Mexico midfielder Marco Fabian, but the floodgates opened as Volland hit his treble in 17 second-half minutes. The win cements Leverkusen's grip on fourth place and gives them a five-point cushion over Hoffenheim, in fifth, and Frankfurt, who are in the Europa League places. Elsewhere, the bottom two clubs Hamburg and Cologne suffered defeats to edge closer towards relegation. Bottom side Cologne suffered a 2-1 away defeat to mid-table Hertha Berlin at the Olympic Stadium. Leon Bittencourt gave Cologne the lead, but Hertha came back with two goals as Davie Selke netted twice in the second half. Hamburg stumbled to a 2-0 defeat at Hoffenheim as Serge Gnabry and Adam Szalai netted first-half goals in Sinsheim. Hanover 96 snatched a point at Stuttgart as striker Niclas Fuellkrug equalised in the 91st minute after Erik Thommy gave the hosts the lead just after the break."

Wolfsburg had the better of the first half, with chances falling to Daniel Didavi and Maximilian Arnold. Awarded a penalty with 15 minutes to go, the home side missed the chance to snatch a first win in seven games, as Paul Verhaegh failed to beat Ralf Faehrmann from 12 yards. They paid a heavy price when Schalke snatched a winner on 86 minutes, Knoche deflecting Breel Embolo's cross into his own net. ""We played well, but to miss a penalty and concede a goal like that is typical of our current situation,"" Knoche told Sky. ""It's obviously frustrating, and I'm sorry for the team."" At the other end of the table, crisis-stricken Hamburg were trying for a fresh start under new coach Christian Titz, but Kalou's second-half winner stretched their winless run to 14 games, and they remain on course for a first relegation in their history. ""It seemed like we ran out of bravery in the second half,"" Titz told Sky. ""In the first half, we showed what this team is capable of."" Hamburg started brightly, and took the lead on 25 minutes after Douglas Santos broke away on the counter-attack. At the other end, several smart saves from Julian Pollersbeck kept the lead in tact until half-time. Hertha finally broke through ten minutes into the second half, Valentino Lazaro turning in Marvin Plattenhardt's cross to level the scores. Minutes later, Kalou popped up in the box to stab home the winner for Hertha. ""Hamburg started well and had a good first 45 minutes,"" said Kalou. ""We were a stronger in the second half."" Hamburg's defeat keeps them second from bottom, seven points behind Mainz, who were outclassed in a 3-0 defeat to local rivals Eintracht Frankfurt. Frankfurt took the lead six minutes in, Kevin-Prince Boateng's volley slipping through the fingers of goalkeeper Florian Mueller. Luka Jovic then doubled the lead on 22 minutes, before Ante Rebic made it three just before half-time. Elsewhere, Werder Bremen moved further away from the bottom three with a clinical 3-1 win over Augsburg, while Matthias Ginter saved a late point for Borussia Moenchengladbach in a six-goal thriller with Hoffenheim. Two strikes from Ishak Belfodil gave Bremen a two-goal lead at half-time, the Algerian firing in a well-angled opener after five minutes, and adding a second minutes before the break. Rani Khedira pulled a goal back for Augsburg with a powerful header in the second half, but Max Kruse's curling strike secured victory for Bremen ten minutes from time. In Moenchengladbach, Benjamin Huebner headed Hoffenheim in front on 13 minutes, before Josip Drmic levelled the scores before half-time. After Andrej Kramaric had restored the lead from the penalty spot, Gladbach equalised again through Lars Stindl on 72 minutes, only for Fabian Grillitsch to fire in Hoffenheim's third moments later. With just minutes to play, Ginter swept in a third equaliser to rescue a point for Gladbach."

Bayern are 20 points clear at the top of the table and will hope to extend that lead with an eighth consecutive victory over crisis-stricken Hamburg. Among the chasing pack are Borussia Dortmund, who face surprise packages Eintracht Frankfurt in a key clash in the race for Europe. Elsewhere, Leon Bailey is expected to return to action for Bayer Leverkusen, while Schalke sporting director faces an emotional homecoming when his side travel to former club Mainz. Bayern Munich's clash with Hamburg on Saturday looks set to be overshadowed by talk of who will succeed Jupp Heynckes. In an interview with SportBild magazine this week, Heynckes appeared to confirm that he will not stay on as Bayern head coach beyond this summer. ""I will be 73 in the summer, and you never know how much more time you have,"" said Heynckes. While Bayern could have the Bundesliga title wrapped up in a matter of weeks, Hamburg are staring down the barrel of a first relegation in their history. With the club seven points adrift of safety, sporting director Jens Todt and chairman Heribert Bruchhagen were fired this week. Eintracht Frankfurt are looking to muscle in on the Bundesliga's elite as they prepare to face top six rivals Borussia Dortmund. Frankfurt were relegation candidates when coach Niko Kovac took over two years ago, but are now firmly in the race for Champions League qualification ahead of this weekend's clash with Dortmund. ""We have the potential to be a really big club,"" said Frankfurt midfielder Makoto Hasebe this week. Leon Bailey is expected to return to action for Bayer Leverkusen when they host Borussia Monchengladbach. The Jamaican starlet was left on the bench during Leverkusen's win over Wolfsburg last weekend, after struggling with a thigh strain earlier that week. He is set to return to the starting line-up on Saturday, however, as fifth-placed Leverkusen look to break back into the Champions League spots. It will be a painful homecoming for sporting director Christian Heidel when Schalke travel to Mainz. Heidel spent 24 years as Mainz's director of sport before moving to Schalke in 2016. He now returns to face a Mainz side who are struggling to move off the relegation play-off place. ""This will be my most difficult homecoming,"" Heidel told Bild.

Second-place Borussia Dortmund host Augsburg on Monday, with fans from both sides set to boycott the game. Elsewhere, Bruno Labbadia takes charge of Wolfsburg for the first time against Mainz on Friday, while RB Leipzig look set to host Cologne without star midfielder Naby Keita. Here are five things to look out for in this weekend's Bundesliga action: Jupp Heynckes has worked wonders since returning to Bayern Munich, and on Saturday he looks set to break an incredible club record. Heynckes, who has led Bayern to 23 victories in 24 games since October, could now become the first Bayern coach ever to win 15 games in a row. The 72-year-old watched his side romp to victory over Besiktas in midweek to pick up a 14th consecutive win, equalling a club record set under Pal Csernai back in 1980. Bayern are expected to be without James Rodriguez, who was forced to leave the pitch after 44 minutes against Besiktas with a calf problem. A diagnosis on Wednesday confirmed that the Colombian will be out of action for no more than a few days. More fan protests are expected this Monday when Borussia Dortmund take on Augsburg in the Bundesliga's second Monday night fixture. Last week's inaugural Monday game saw fierce protests from Eintracht Frankfurt fans, who blew whistles and held up banners in protest at the new scheduling. This Monday, both Dortmund and Augsburg fan groups are expected to continue protests. Around 300 Dortmund fan clubs have reportedly signed up to a boycott led by the influential fan group ""Suedtribuene Dortmund"". ""We accept every opinion and every protest, as long as it is carried out peacefully,"" said Dortmund CEO Hans-Joachim Watzke. RB Leipzig will be without star midfielder Naby Keita when they host Cologne on Sunday evening. The Guinean midfielder left the field after just an hour in Leipzig's defeat to Frankfurt on Monday, having pulled his hamstring. Captain Willi Orban is also a doubt after suffering a cut to his knee in a collision with Frankfurt's Sebastien Haller on Monday. Coach Ralph Hasenhuettl, though, claimed that the injuries were not a disaster for his team, as Leipzig look to muscle their way back into the top four this weekend. ""We have enough quality to replace both of them,"" insisted Hasenhuettl. Bruno Labbadia takes charge of Wolfsburg for the first time on Friday evening, as the Wolves travel to Mainz for a crucial bottom of the table clash. Labbadia took charge of the struggling Wolves after Martin Schmidt's sudden resignation earlier this week, and is now tasked with leading the club back to safety. ""We have to use every hour available to us,"" said Labbadia. ""I will demand of my players that they invest everything into this fight.""

There were chances for both Lars Stindl and Raul Bobadilla early on, but the pitch remained the focus of attention, as Andre Schuerrle appeared to slip and hurt himself. Schuerrle recovered to set up Reus as Dortmund took the lead against the run of play on 32 minutes. Picking up a pinpoint long pass from Mario Goetze, Schuerrle squared the ball to Reus, whose dipping shot glanced off the crossbar on its way in. ""I actually wanted to hit it further to the left,"" Reus told Sky. ""But the main thing is that the ball went in. We had to scrap today, and we have a lot of work ahead of us."" Reus has missed most of the current campaign with a cruciate ligament tear, and had not been on the scoresheet for Dortmund since scoring a brace on the final day of last season. Jannik Vestergaard found the net for Gladbach just before half-time, but was judged to be offside by the video assistant referee. Thorgan Hazard should have equalised moments later, darting into the box from the left wing before slicing the ball wide. Gladbach continued to push forward after the break, chances falling to both Denis Zakaria and Matthias Ginter before Sokratis denied Bobadilla with a goal-line clearance on 55 minutes. As the second half wore on, Roman Buerki was forced into a string of saves, denying Stindl, Bobadilla and Nico Elvedi to keep Dortmund ahead. At the other end, Reus saw his fizzing half-volley beaten away by Yann Sommer. Earlier in the day, Mario Gomez's goal was enough to secure a first away win of the season for Stuttgart, and inflict a first home defeat since October on Augsburg. The veteran striker gave Stuttgart the lead just before the half-hour mark. After Erik Thommy's free-kick was blocked by the defensive wall, Gomez pounced on the loose ball and swept it into the bottom corner. Michael Gregoritsch appeared to equalise for Augsburg ten minutes later, but he too was correctly ruled offside after a two-minute long consultation with the video assistant referee. Only a superb save from Marwin Hitz stopped Stuttgart from doubling the lead on 65 minutes, the Augsburg goalkeeper denying Gomez from point blank range. ""We should really have won by three or four goals today,"" Gomez told Sky. ""But we showed amazing character, and we're going in the right direction."" The win lifts Stuttgart four points clear of the bottom three, while Dortmund move into second ahead of RB Leipzig's visit to Eintracht Frankfurt on Monday."

Werder finished the weekend three points above the relegation zone in 15th with Stuttgart a point and a place above that. Swedish defender Ludwig Augustinsson headed Bremen into an early lead before Austrian international Kainz curled a long-range shot inside the far post on 40 minutes at Bremen's Weser Stadion. Wolfsburg captain Paul Verhaegh gave the visitors hope by converting a penalty early in the second half. However, Bremen sealed the win after midfielder Maximilian Eggestein won possession and striker Max Kruse sent Kainz in behind the defence, the Austrian slotting an ice-cool finish past ex-Bremen goalkeeper Koen Casteels with 18 minutes left. The win leaves Bremen unbeaten in their last seven homes games in all competitions, while Wolfsburg are 13th, but only four points from danger. Earlier, Stuttgart got their first victory under new coach Tayfun Korkut as striker Daniel Ginczek netted the only goal of the game. Korkut, 43, a German-born former Turkey international, was brought in as head coach a fortnight ago to stop Stuttgart's slide after predecessor Hannes Wolf was sacked following a run of seven defeats in eight league games. After overseeing Stuttgart's 1-1 draw at Wolfsburg last weekend, Korkut got off to a winning start at Stuttgart's Mercedes Benz Arena. Just five minutes in, veteran Germany striker Mario Gomez threaded a pass between two defenders for Ginczek to sprint onto and cooly slot home his fourth league goal of the season. Gladbach had their chances as Josip Drmic, Brazil forward Raffael and Germany striker Lars Stindl all went agonisingly close for the visitors, who have now suffered three straight league defeats. This was only Stuttgart's fifth league win since October. Erratic Moenchengladbach drop to tenth despite being the only team other than Hoffenheim to beat runaway leaders Bayern Munich in the Bundesliga this season. On Saturday, Bayern's Robert Lewandowski scored for the 11th straight home league match, equalling the Bundesliga record, with Thomas Mueller also netting in a 2-1 win over Schalke that left Munich 18 points clear."

After overseeing Stuttgart's 1-1 draw at Wolfsburg last weekend, Korkut got off to a winning start at home as Ginczek scored the winner at Stuttgart's Mercedes Benz Arena with just five minutes gone. Veteran Germany striker Mario Gomez threaded a pass between two defenders for Ginczek to sprint onto and then cooly slot home his fourth league goal of the season. Gladbach had their chances as Josip Drmic, Brazil forward Raffael and Germany striker Lars Stindl all went agonisingly close for the visitors who have now suffered three straight league defeats. This is only Stuttgart's fifth league win since October as they remain 14th, still in the relegation battle and just four points from the bottom three. Erratic Moenchengladbach drop to tenth despite being the only other team alongside Hoffenheim to beat runaway leaders Bayern Munich in the Bundesliga this season. On Saturday, Bayern's Robert Lewandowski scored for the 11th straight home league match, equalling the Bundesliga record, as Thomas Mueller also netted as the 2-1 win over Schalke which left Munich 18 points clear."
80,05/02/2018,12:11,Five things we learned from the Bundesliga weekend,"Michy Batshuayi made a blistering start to life at Borussia Dortmund on Friday, firing the team back into the top four with two goals on his debut.","The Belgian wasn't the only debutant to make an impact, as 20-year-old English forward Ademola Lookman grabbed a late winner in his first game for RB Leipzig. The goal saw Leipzig move up to third in the Bundesliga, drawing level on points with second-place Bayer Leverkusen. Both Leverkusen and Leipzig are now 18 points behind leaders Bayern Munich, whose victory over Mainz on Saturday was overshadowed by speculation over coach Jupp Heynckes' future. Here are five things we learned from this weekend's Bundesliga action. Who needs Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang when you have Michy Batshuayi? Just three days after joining Dortmund on a six-month loan deal, Batshuayi enjoyed an explosive debut, grabbing two goals and an assist to inspire his new team to a 3-2 victory in Cologne. ""The way the game went for him today was like a dream,"" said coach Peter Stoeger of his new striker. Batshuayi, meanwhile, is already dreaming of big goals for his six-month sojourn in Westphalia. ""I want to get into the Champions League with Dortmund,"" he said. ""I want to win every single game."" Bayern Munich's dominance of the Bundesliga continued at the weekend, but there was more attention paid to Jupp Heynckes' future. The 72-year-old's contract runs until June, and he has repeatedly refused to talk about extending it. ""I can imagine that readers, viewers and listeners are bored of this topic,"" he said on Friday. Since coming out of retirement to take over at Bayern in the autumn, Heynckes has led the team to 14 victories in 15 Bundesliga games, so it is little wonder that the club would like him to stay beyond the end of the season. ""If I stood naked in front of him, I might have a small chance of persuading him to stay,"" joked club president Uli Hoeness earlier in the week. Everton loanee Ademola Lookman grabbed the headlines on Saturday, scoring 12 minutes into his RB Leipzig debut to secure a late victory over Borussia Moenchengladbach. The 20-year-old Englishman might, however, want to invest in a pair of new boots. ""He was lucky that I didn't take him off again straight away,"" admitted Leipzig coach Ralph Hasenhuettl. ""He was just sliding around in the boots he was wearing. They were the only pair he had brought with him from England, and he didn't want to take them off."" Both goalkeepers were left blushing in Gelsenkirchen as Werder Bremen snatched a late 2-1 win over Schalke. Bremen 'keeper Jiri Pavlenka allowed Yevhen Konoplyanka's shot to slip through his fingers in the first half. His error was overshadowed by the woes of opposite number Ralf Faehrmann, however -- he first fumbled a free-kick to gift Bremen an equaliser, before being nutmegged by Zlatko Junuzovic's late winner. ""Ralf said sorry in the dressing room, and I told him he had nothing to apologise for,"" said Schalke coach Domenico Tedesco. Michael Gregoritsch will have enjoyed watching the Super Bowl on Sunday, having secured three points for Augsburg just hours earlier. The Austrian scored Augsburg's second in a 3-0 win over Eintracht Frankfurt, and celebrated by miming a quarterback's throw. ""I will definitely be watching the Super Bowl later,"" admitted Gregoritsch after the game. ""My four best friends are coming over; I never sleep after a game anyway."""
81,20/12/2017,20:46,Bailey sends Leverkusen into Cup quarters,Leon Bailey netted the winner as Bayer Leverkusen beat Borussia Moenchengladbach 1-0 to reach the quarter-finals of the German Cup on Wednesday.,"Goalless until the 71st minute, the game burst into life when Bailey broke down the left to pick up Kevin Volland's through ball and fire past Yann Sommer. Werder Bremen joined Leverkusen in the last eight by beating Freiburg 3-2. After goals from Ishak Belfodil and Florian Kainz had put Bremen two goals up within 20 minutes, Nils Petersen pulled a goal back from the penalty spot just before the half-hour mark. With 20 minutes to play, Philipp Bargfrede swept the ball in for Bremen's third, the referee overruling the linesman's offside flag. A late goal from Yoric Ravet proved too little for Freiburg."
82,07/12/2016,14:34,Schubert under pressure at Gladbach,Andre Schubert is in danger of becoming the sixth Bundesliga coach fired this season with Borussia Moenchengladbach winless in their last eight games following their 4-0 trashing at Barcelona.,"Gladbach are in freefall down the German league table, they are currently 13th -- five points from the relegation places -- and their last Bundesliga win was at the end of September. Despite a string of changes, Barcelona strolled past Gladbach at the Camp Nou as Arda Turan netted a hat-trick in 17 second-half minutes while Lionel Messi scored his 10th Champions League goal of the season. Director of sport Max Eberl says Gladbach's next three Bundesliga games, against bottom-half clubs Mainz, Augsburg and Wolfsburg matter more than the Barcelona defeat, but the lack of confidence is clear. ""Barcelona are not a team to use as a yardstick, they play no role in my evaluation,"" said Eberl. ""What matters for us is the next three Bundesliga games."" Gladbach finished the Champions League's pool games third in their group to progress to the knock-out stages of the Europa League. But reversing the run of poor results and preserving their Bundesliga status is now top priority. ""We clearly have too few points,"" said Eberl, with Gladbach having taken 13 points from 13 league games. ""We all know we're lagging behind, we will try to change that."" A victory at Mainz on Sunday is now compulsory, a situation Schubert is all too mindful of. The 45-year-old says the team is missing a leader, like Swiss midfielder Granit Xhaka who was sold to Arsenal in the off season. ""A vocal leading player like Granit Xhaka is not there at he moment,"" said Schubert. ""We are in a points situation which causes unrest. ""We have to take the situation in hand and attack."" Schubert replaced Lucien Favre in September 2015 and impressively turned five straight Bundesliga defeats into a 10-match unbeaten run, guiding the team to fourth last season to qualify for the Champions League. Now, he is currently the hot favourite to follow the fate of Norbert Meier, who was sacked by Darmstadt on Monday. Viktor Skrypnyk (Werder Bremen), Bruno Labbadia (Hamburg), Dieter Hecking (Wolfsburg) and Markus Kauczinski (Ingolstadt) have all been dismissed by Bundesliga teams since September."
83,22/11/2016,02:00,Top spot at stake as Arsenal host PSG,"worldfootball looks ahead to Wednesday's Champions League action with Arsenal v Paris Saint-Germain the plum tie while Barcelona, Manchester City and Bayern Munich all face challenging away games (kick-offs 1945 GMT unless stated):","<strong>Group A</strong> at London Arsenal (ENG) v Paris Saint-Germain (FRA) The Gunners will be out to put one over the French champions, whom they held 1-1 in Paris, as both struggle for top spot in Group A, the pair having already booked passage to the knockout phase. The Londoners could look to Olivier Giroud, who rescued a point from the bench at Old Trafford, to spearhead their attack after Alexis Sanchez played through hamstring trouble. As Arsenal drew with Manchester United to leave them fourth in the Premier League, PSG warmed up for Wednesday with a fourth straight win, 2-0 over Nantes, as they chase down French leaders Nice. PSG's Old Trafford misfit Angel Di Maria scored against Nantes but came off in the first half with a thigh injury, albeit not one expected to keep him out. Argentine playmaker Javier Pastore is set to miss the trip to London with a knee problem. Ludogorets (BUL) v Basel (SUI) at Sofia Bulgarians Ludogorets and Basel have proved the makeweights in Group A with both garnering a solitary point to date. A Europa League spot is the consolation prize that awaits the side that can cement third place. The two parted 1-1 in the first meeting in Switzerland. Previous encounters saw the Swiss win handsomely in a two-leg playoff three years ago. Ludogorets will be slight favourites, courtesy of home advantage, and they gave Arsenal a brief scare in their last outing, but let slip a two-goal lead to succumb 3-2. <strong>Group B</strong> Napoli (ITA) v Dynamo Kiev (UKR) at Naples Napoli might just about top the group but they are locked in a three-way struggle with Benfica and Besiktas for two places in the last 16. They came from behind to see off Kiev in Ukraine in the reverse fixture and badly need three points here. Their weekend 2-1 win at Udinese kept them in touch with the top four in Serie A, though prolific striker Arkadiusz Milik is still out injured. Lorenzo Insigne grabbed a brace at Udinese and the Italians will be looking to him and Jose Callejon to fire them past Dynamo, the whipping boys of the group with just one point. Besiktas (TUR) v Benfica (POR) at Istanbul (Kick-off at 1745 GMT) Benfica, level on points with Napoli, travel to Turkey's still-unbeaten Besiktas, who are just a point adrift of the top pair. A Benfica victory will take the two-time champions, top in the Portuguese league, through to the knock-out phase. But they cannot afford to be complacent against a Besiktas side which held them to a draw in Lisbon. The Turkish champions are looking to get out of the pool phase for the first time in six attempts and their fans are sure to give Benfica a hostile reception. <strong>Group C</strong> Celtic (SCO) v Barcelona (ESP) at Glasgow Top spot is still up for grabs in Group C as Barcelona, two points clear of Manchester City, travel to a Celtic side they squashed 7-0 at the Camp Nou. A win for Lionel Messi and Co. -- he is set to return after a sickness bug at the weekend -- will see the Spanish champions into the last 16, though a draw might also do it depending on the other game. Luis Suarez will be back from suspension, which is bad news for a Celtic side who are two points adrift at the bottom of the group. The Scottish giants warmed up for Barca with a 1-0 win over Kilmarnock which left them 13 points clear in their domestic league. Borussia Moenchengladbach (GER) v Manchester City (ENG) at Moenchengladbach, Germany City's Yaya Toure-inspired weekend win at Crystal Palace keeps them a point off leaders Chelsea in the Premier League. But it is at the back that they have worries, particularly the fitness of talisman centre-back Vincent Kompany, who suffered a head injury in a collision with keeper Claudio Bravo at Palace. Victory in Germany for Pep Guardiola's side will see them into the next round. The home side look on course for a Europa League slot and need to pull off a surprise win if they are to have any hope of making further progress in this competition. On current form that looks a tall order after successive domestic losses, to Cologne and Hertha Berlin, sent them into the bottom six in the Bundesliga. <strong>Group D</strong> Rostov (RUS) v Bayern Munich (GER) at Rostov, Russia (Kick-off 1700 GMT) Five-time European champions Bayern head to Russia's Rostov for their Group D clash licking their wounds after being knocked from the top of the Bundesliga. Their 1-0 defeat at Dortmund on Saturday allowed RB Leipzig to finish the weekend top of the German league table. Bayern are already into the last 16 but need a win at Rostov to stay in touch with group leaders Atletico Madrid, who they host on December 6 for a potential top-spot decider. Bayern will be without injured keeper Manuel Neuer, meaning Sven Ulreich will deputise. Rock-bottom Rostov and PSV have a single point each so are locked in a struggle for a Europa League place only. The Russians have a solid home record and held Rubin Kazan to a goalless draw on Friday. Atletico Madrid (ESP) v PSV Eindhoven (NED) at Madrid Atletico might already be through and top of the group, but they are on a poor run in the Spanish league. Beaten finalists in two of the last three editions of the Champions League, the Spaniards will qualify as group winners if they win and Bayern do worse. Coach Diego Simeone seems to be losing his iron grip a tad and success built on a rock-solid defence appears to be slipping. Phillip Cocu's PSV will be massive underdogs nonetheless and they only drew 0-0 at lowly Willem II at the weekend in domestic action, with their Dutch championship hopes evaporating slowly."
84,02/11/2016,12:52,'Wouldn't happen to Bayern' fumes Gladbach boss,"Borussia Moenchengladbach have accused Bundesliga bosses of favouritism towards Bayern Munich as they face a successive Friday night match, three days after a mid-week game in Europe.","Gladbach were held to a 1-1 draw home to Celtic in the Champions League on Tuesday and play Hertha Berlin away in a key Bundesliga match on Friday. It is the second time in quick succession Gladbach have been given a short turn-around by the German Football League (DFL) after they drew 0-0 with Frankfurt last Friday -- three days after a German Cup win home to Stuttgart. Borussia, 11th in Germany's top flight, are struggling for form and are winless in their last four German league games. ""I have to say, what were the league thinking giving a Champions League side a game directly on a Friday?"" Max Eberl, Gladbach's director of sport, asked magazine Kicker. ""That would never happen to Bayern Munich. I have never heard of Bayern playing on a Friday after a Champions League game. ""They always play on Saturdays and Sundays. Borussia Moenchengladbach must now run out at Hertha Berlin. I find that extremely unfortunate."" Following their Champions League draw Gladbach remain third in Group C, three points behind Manchester City, who they host in three weeks' time in a must-win clash. Eberl is realistic about his side's chances of progressing to the knock-out stages with Pep Guardiola's City and Barcelona in pole position to reach the last 16. But the Germans are still mathematically in contention and third at least carries automatic qualification for the Europa League, if it comes to that. ""We still have matters in our own hands and can go into the winter break (in January) in the Europa League,"" said Eberl. ""Bold fans have dreamt of 'a final' against Manchester City, but that was not in our heads against Celtic."""
85,31/10/2016,16:15,Misfiring Gladbach seek Celtic win to go second,Misfiring Borussia Moenchengladbach are looking to complete a Champions League double over Celtic on Tuesday and victory could see them knock Manchester City out of second place in Group C.,"Gladbach beat Brendan Rodgers' Celtic in Glasgow 2-0 a fortnight ago thanks to goals by Lars Stindl and Andre Hahn and another win would put them second if City lose at home to Barcelona. The Germans earned their first points in the group by beating Celtic, who are bottom of the table with one point. If Rodgers' side lose again, and City avoid defeat against Barcelona, the Scottish champions' slim chance of a last-16 spot will be over. But Borussia's goalless draw at home to Eintracht Frankfurt on Friday meant they failed to score in all four Bundesliga matches in October and coach Andre Schubert is under pressure to get his team firing again. Gladbach welcome Celtic, then Pep Guardiola's Manchester City, to Borussia Park in the next fortnight. ""Celtic and City have to get by us at Borussia Park and a few teams have had a problem there,"" said Gladbach winger Hahn. Schubert says his side are ""in the race -- nothing more, nothing less"". The last few weeks have not been easy for Schubert, who has just the win at Celtic and a 2-0 German Cup win at second-division VfB Stuttgart to show after 374 minutes without a goal in the German league. ""I understand that people always expect champagne football from us, but we're not capable of that at the moment,"" said Schubert following the draw with Frankfurt. Gladbach are 11th in Germany's top flight while runaway Scottish league leaders Celtic have won their last five domestic games. Rodgers has been dealt a major blow with three more players out of their trip to Gladbach with striker Leigh Griffiths ill, plus defenders Jozo Simunovic and Kolo Toure ruled out by injury. Centre-backs Toure and Simunovic stayed in Glasgow to work on their fitness while left-back Kieran Tierney was already ruled out through injury. Schubert is confident Brazilian forward Raffael will play at least some part against Celtic, even if only off the bench, having missed the draw with Frankfurt. Thorgan Hazard, brother of Chelsea star Eden, is out with a knee problem sustained in the closing stages of Gladbach's 4-0 defeat to Schalke at the beginning of October. Guinea winger Ibrahima Traore is also out with a thigh injury."
86,22/10/2016,21:04,Bayern break Gladbach jinx to go three clear,Bayern Munich broke their Borussia Moenchengladbach jinx on Saturday as Arturo Vidal and Douglas Costa netted in a 2-0 home win to put the champions three points clear on Saturday.,"First-half goals by Bayern's Chile and Brazil internationals gave Carlo Ancelotti's Munich a first win over Gladbach in five German league matches after Borussia claimed home and away league victories in 2015. After back-to-back draws in the league the win caps a good week for Bayern, who enjoyed a 4-1 romp against PSV Eindhoven in the Champions League on Wednesday. ""The first half was perhaps our best of the whole season,"" said Ancelotti. ""The second wasn't quite so good and I told the players to be careful at the break as the energy wasn't 100 percent after the PSV game. ""They learnt the lesson from last weekend's draw with Frankfurt."" Ancelotti rested Germany forward Thomas Mueller from the starting line-up, but after Robert Lewandowski hit the post early on, Bayern went ahead after 16 minutes when Chile's Vidal headed home Rafinha's cross. Winger Costa's 31st-minute shot doubled the lead at Munich's Allianz Arena, while Gladbach's best chance came when winger Andre Hahn hit the post on 71 minutes. Hertha Berlin went second with a 2-1 home win over Cologne, who lost their unbeaten record. Hertha took the lead in the capital when Mitchell Weiser broke clear and his pass found Vedad Ibisevic, who netted his sixth goal in eight league games on 13 minutes. Cologne's French striker Anthony Modeste, the league's top scorer, levelled with his eighth goal in eight games on 65 minutes, but Hertha defender Niklas Stark headed the winner six minutes from time. Cologne's Simon Zoller hit the post in the dying stages, then replacement Artjoms Rudnevs had a goal disallowed and the result leaves their side fourth. Borussia Dortmund are three Bundesliga games without a win, although they fought back from two goals down to draw 3-3 at Ingolstadt and sit sixth. Dortmund were 2-0 down as Israel international Almog Cohen and Paraguay's Dario Lezcano netted for Ingolstadt. Cohen wriggled free of his marker from a free-kick before Lezcano looped his header into the top corner. Borussia hit back when Mario Goetze set up Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang to head home his seventh goal in his seven league games on 59 minutes, only for Lezcano to net Ingolstadt's third less than 60 seconds later to make it 3-1. Dortmund dominated the final quarter as Adrian Ramos pulled a goal back on 69 minutes and Christian Pulisic scored the crucial equaliser in stoppage time. The draw saw Ingolstadt climb off the bottom above Hamburg, who lost 3-0 to Eintracht Frankfurt on Friday. Bayer Leverkusen slumped to a 3-0 defeat at home to Hoffenheim after playing virtually the entire match with 10 men. Kevin Volland earned the fastest red card of the season with just six minutes gone for bringing down Kerem Demirbay, who was through on goal. Demirbay, Sandro Wagner and Swiss midfielder Steven Zuber netted the visitors' goals. Bayer coach Roger Schmidt was sent to the stands in the wake of the second goal and faces a lengthy ban for his second dismissal this year. Ten-man Wolfsburg dropped to 15th after their 3-1 defeat at Darmstadt left them seven games without a win. Frenchman Valerien Ismael was appointed Wolfsburg's new head coach on Monday after Dieter Hecking was sacked. Freiburg were 2-1 winners at home to Augsburg as they claimed a fourth victory in as many matches in front of their own fans."
87,21/10/2016,02:10,Stumbling Bayern hunt rare win over Gladbach,Carlo Ancelotti's Bayern Munich bid to claim a rare win over Borussia Moenchengladbach on Saturday as the Bundesliga leaders look to get back to winning ways in Germany's top flight.,"Having won their first eight games under Ancelotti in all competitions, Bayern then went three matches without a win but got back on track with a 4-1 thumping of PSV Eindhoven on Wednesday in the Champions League. The Bavarians now return to domestic business, where they have slipped up in recent weeks with draws against Cologne and Eintracht Frankfurt. Bayern are two points clear at the top of the table but need to build on their emphatic win over PSV when Arjen Robben was outstanding with two assists and a goal. ""I think we absolutely took a step forward, and we have to build on that,"" skipper Philipp Lahm said after Wednesday's match. Bayern have failed to beat Borussia in their last four meetings and Gladbach claimed home and away league wins over the Bavarian giants in 2015. Gladbach are buoyed by their 2-0 Champions League win at Celtic which Andre Schubert's side needed after their 4-0 thrashing by Schalke and frustrating goalless draw with Hamburg, when they missed two penalties. ""Bayern are a very different team to Celtic, you can't compare them with each other,"" Gladbach's Danish defender Jannik Vestergaard told the club's website. ""Bayern have a world-class team so we need to work really hard again, but we have to try to play the way we like to, otherwise it's going to be a long 90 minutes."" Moenchengladbach no longer enjoy the same rivalry with Bayern as they did in the 1970s, when the clubs shared nine straight Bundesliga titles between them. But the Foals still present a challenge having only lost once at the Allianz Arena in the last five years. A battle royale beckons in the capital on Saturday when fourth-placed Hertha Berlin host unbeaten Cologne. Pal Dardai's Hertha are enjoying their best start to a campaign for 46 years and have lost only to Bayern this season, while second-placed Cologne are unbeaten in nine away games and are one of only four teams still undefeated in the Bundesliga. The goals could well flow as Cologne's Anthony Modeste is the league's top scorer so far with seven, while Hertha's Vedad Ibisevic is just behind with five. Injury-hit Borussia Dortmund are eager to pick up a first Bundesliga win in four weeks at bottom club Ingolstadt on Saturday -- Thomas Tuchel's men had nine players out for Tuesday's 2-1 win at Sporting Lisbon in the Champions League. Meanwhile, Eintracht have been boosted ahead of their trip to Hamburg on Friday after defender Marco Russ, 31, was given the green light to return to training. Russ has not played since being diagnosed with testicular cancer in May this year. ""It's wonderful. He has the doctors' permission to pursue his career once more and will now start with a programme of rehabilitation,"" said coach Niko Kovac. ""To start with, he needs to work on his fitness. But he'd like to be as close to the team as possible, and wants to make the trip to Hamburg with us."" Ex-Bayern defender Valerien Ismael makes his debut as a Bundesliga coach on Saturday when he takes Wolfsburg to Darmstadt with both teams just above the relegation places. Wolfsburg sacked Dieter Hecking as coach on Monday after six games without a win and Frenchman Ismael has been promoted as coach from the Under-23 team. Results in the coming weeks will dictate whether he gets the job permanently. Fixtures (all times 1330 GMT unless stated)"
88,19/10/2016,23:44,Celtic's Euro hopes in tatters after Toure blunders,Celtic's Champion League hopes were in tatters on Wednesday as Borussia Monchengladbach produced a clinical performance to inflict a 2-0 home defeat on the Scottish champions.,"The Germans arrived in Glasgow with a horrendous injury list and struggling for form following defeats by Manchester City and Barcelona in their opening Group C fixtures. However, the Bundesliga side dominated the match from the start as they played with the kind of intensity that had helped Celtic claim a thrilling 3-3 draw with Manchester City on match day two. Following a goalless first half, captain Lars Stindl rifled his side into a deserved lead in the 57th minute after a mistake from veteran defender Kolo Toure. The former Liverpool defender was caught out again 20 minutes later as Andre Hahn pounced to grab the second and inflict only Celtic's fourth home defeat in 26 Champions League games. Monchengladbach move to within one point of Manchester City in second, who lost 3-0 to Group C leaders Barcelona thanks to a Lionel Messi hat-trick on Pep Guardiola's return to the Nou Camp, while Celtic are rooted to the bottom on one point. Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers said he had no complaint about the result. ""The best team won -- I don't think there is any argument about that,"" Rodgers said. ""My players gave everything but tonight they were up against a top side and the only disappointment was the manner of the two goals."" Monchengladbach coach Andre Schubert was delighted to see his side pick up their first points. ""I am extremely happy to get the win and it gives us more security in the group,"" Schubert said. ""We still have to prove our quality at home but we have taken our first steps and gained our first three points."" Much was made of the visitors' injury problems with key forwards Raffael, Thorgan Hazard and Josip Drmic missing, but their replacements were impressive as twice within the opening minutes the Celtic defence was torn apart. Only a last-ditch block from Toure prevented a Hahn shot from reaching Craig Gordon, but the 'keeper didn't have to wait long to be tested. Ibrahima Traore's effort had the Hoops stopper at full-stretch to make a fingertip save before he smothered the danger as Hahn looked to pounce on the loose ball. The Bundesliga side seemed to cut through Celtic with ease and Jonas Hoffman was next to try his luck but his rising shot failed to trouble Gordon. The Hoops looked to be in trouble as Stindl latched on to a poor backward header by Bitton, but the Foals' captain over hit his pass to Hahn whose shot from a tight angle was tipped over by Gordon. The Celtic fans, who seemed to drive their side forward against Man City with their raucous support, were silenced as their side struggled to cope with the relentless pressure from the Germans. However, they came alive again just before the break as Rogic's clever pass behind the Borussia defence played in Sinclair but the English forward sent his effort sailing over the bar. The home support tried their best to rouse their side at the start of the second half but the Germans' slick one-touch passing play stifled their opponents. The visitors took a deserved lead in bizarre circumstances. Toure was caught trying to usher the ball out inside the six-yard box but Hahn's perseverance allowed him to dig the ball back into ball for the advancing Stindl who lashed the ball through the legs of Gordon. Another costly mistake from Toure allowed the visitors to increase their advantage. The experienced defender was caught dithering on the ball by Hahn who robbed him of possession near the halfway line and raced away to blast a strike into the top right-hand corner of Gordon's net."

Johnson has a cold, Christensen has a glute injury, Hazard has a knee problem and Raffael has a leg injury. ""The number of injuries hurt us, of course, but our squad is big enough to cope. Now, other players have to jump into the breach,"" said director of sport Max Eberl. The two clubs will meet again at Gladbach's Borussia Park stadium in a fortnight. The game has been dubbed 'the battle for third place' in Group C with both teams behind giants Manchester City and Barcelona, who play each other at the Camp Nou on Wednesday."

Andre Schubert's Gladbach, who fell to Man City (0-4) and Barcelona (1-2), are sitting bottom of the group. They return to a city where they endured their heaviest European defeat, an 8-0 loss to Rangers in the 1960/61 European Cup Winners' Cup, but boosted by the knowledge that Celtic are traditionally beaten by German opponents. Celtic are unbeaten at home in 21 games and manager Brendan Rodgers is counting on the crowd again to lift his side whose hopes of qualifying for the last 16 looked to be over after a 7-0 mauling at the Nou Camp. Another mismatch of epic proportions looked on the cards when Pep Guardiola's City visited Celtic Park looking for their 11th straight victory. However, the critics were made to eat their words as City were forced to come from behind on three occasions to grab a point following a thrilling 3-3 draw in Glasgow. ""Our objective was to look to be in Europe after Christmas,"" Rodgers said. ""We felt it would be great if we could do that from such a strong group. ""The home games are very important for us so this game against Borussia will be vital. ""If we can come out of the back-to-back games with four points it would put us in a great position."" The Scottish champions have a formidable home record in Europe's elite competition. In 25 Champions League group stage games at Celtic Park, the Hoops have lost just three, drawn six and won 16. And having achieved his primary aim of restoring his side to the group stages of the competition, Rodgers now has his sights on further progression in Europe. ""They'll be tough and it will be a rollercoaster but, being realistic, that is what you have to aim for. You look to win your home game and get something away from home, though it is not a disaster if you don't. ""You have to earn every single point in the Champions League. We are delighted to be in this competition and will try to rinse everything we can out of it."""

But goals in the final 25 minutes, from Arda Turan and Gerard Pique, sealed Barcelona's second Group C win after their 7-0 hammering of Celtic at the Camp Nou a fortnight ago. ""They scored with the only chance they had in the first half, but the game is 90 minutes long and they put in a huge effort,"" said match-winner Pique. ""They didn't have the same legs in the second half and we made fewer mistakes in midfield. ""By losing possession less and them running less they had fewer counter-attacks and it was more difficult for them. ""Overall, I think we were better and it is a deserved result."" Barca fought back when Neymar shook off his marker to float a pass over the top of the Gladbach defence and Turan won the race to the ball before drilling his shot home on 65 minutes. The winning goal came just nine minutes later. Neymar's corner was deflected into the path of Suarez, who was unmarked in the area. He slammed in a powerful shot which was blocked by goalkeeper Yann Sommer, but Pique was on hand to tap home the loose ball from close range. ""It was a set-piece, I was set up to block and I went for the rebound. I saw the 'keeper was a bit unsure and I managed to score the goal,"" explained Pique. Barca coach Luis Enrique cut a relieved figure after the final whistle at Borussia Park. ""We created chances in the first half too, but they are on a great run and it showed,"" he said. ""We weren't totally clear in our play in the first half, but they took their chance and we didn't. ""We were much better in the second half and got the victory that helps us a lot."" Gladbach saw an 11-match winning streak at home come to an end as they were left with nothing to show for an impressive display in which they refused to be overawed by the Spanish giants. ""The team gave it everything and came out of this with some credit. We can be proud,"" said Gladbach's sporting director Max Eberl. Gladbach did much better than in their 4-0 loss at Manchester City last time out, but winger Patrick Herrmann admitted it was hard to put the brakes on the Spanish giants. ""We did brilliantly to go 1-0 up, but Barcelona are such a quality side -- you have to stay focused for the entire 90 minutes,"" he said. ""If you don't, they take full advantage. We wanted to win the game and it was a close-run affair in the end, but not the result we wanted."" Gladbach's next Champions League outing is away at Celtic next month, while Barcelona prepare for a home clash with City as Pep Guardiola returns to the Camp Nou."
92,28/09/2016,22:53,Messi-less Barca fight back to down Gladbach,Barcelona proved they can win away in Europe even without Lionel Messi as they posted a 2-1 comeback victory at Borussia Moenchengladbach in the Champions League on Wednesday.,"Thorgan Hazard -- the younger brother of Chelsea midfielder Eden -- gave Gladbach a shock, yet deserved first-half lead. But goals in the final 25 minutes, from Arda Turan and Gerard Pique, sealed Barcelona's second Group C win after their 7-0 hammering of Celtic at the Camp Nou a fortnight ago. ""They put in a huge effort in the first-half, but overall I think we were better and it is a deserved result,"" said match-winner Pique. Gladbach winger Patrick Herrmann admitted it was hard to put the brakes on the Spanish giants. ""We did brilliantly to go 1-0 up, but Barcelona are such a quality side -- you have to stay focused for the entire 90 minutes,"" he said. ""If you don't, they take full advantage. We wanted to win the game and it was a close-run affair in the end, but not the result we wanted."" With Messi out due to a groin injury, Barca coach Luis Enrique opted to start Spain international Paco Alcacer in the superstar's place alongside Neymar and Luis Suarez. But as Gladbach coach Andre Schubert had predicted in the pre-match press conference, the hosts refused to be overawed by their illustrious opponents. Neymar and Suarez were rarely allowed more than a split-second on the ball. Gladbach had the better of the opening exchanges at Borussia Park and fulley merited their lead. Referee Damir Skomina missed a handball in the area when the ball clipped Gerard Pique's arm from Hazard's cross in the first five minutes, but then Gladbach took the lead with their first dangerous attack. Raffael dispossessed Sergio Busquets and broke into the Barca half before feeding Mahmoud Dahoud, who timed his pass into the box perfectly, flicking the ball into Hazard's path. The midfielder stabbed his shot past goalkeeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen on 34 minutes, to the delight of the home fans and Enrique's horror. It was clearly not the homecoming ter Stegen had envisaged, having left Gladbach in 2014 for Barca after 18 years with the Bundesliga club. Gladbach managed to disrupt Barcelona's game until just after the hour mark. Germany midfielder Christoph Kramer was subduing Neymar while Dahoud was the creative spark in midfield. Turan came on for Ivan Rakitic on the hour mark and it proved to be an inspired switch as he scored five minutes later. Neymar finally shook off Kramer to float a pass over the top of the Gladbach defence. Turan won the foot race to the ball and drilled his shot past Gladbach goalkeeper Yann Sommer on 65 minutes The winning goal came just nine minutes later. Neymar's corner was deflected into the path of Suarez, who was unmarked in the area. He slammed in a powerful shot, which was blocked by Sommer, but Pique was on hand to tap home the loose ball from close range, to Enrique's delight."
93,27/09/2016,19:52,Enrique expects Barca to be tested at Gladbach,"Luis Enrique has warned Barcelona to take nothing for granted when the Spanish giants, minus injured Lionel Messi, face Borussia Moenchengladbach on Wednesday in the Champions League.","""Above everything else, Gladbach inspire awe at home. They aren't just dangerous with the ball, they also attack early and high up the pitch,"" said Barca's coach in Tuesday's press conference. ""We'll have to play like we always do, we'll have to position ourselves well and deal with them quickly."" The Barca boss was talking up the hosts' chances at Borussia Park, but Gladbach will struggle to contain the Spaniards, even without groin-injury victim Messi. Barcelona opened their Group C campaign a fortnight ago with a 7-0 drubbing of Celtic at the Camp Nou, while the Germans suffered a 4-0 defeat at Pep Guardiola's Manchester City. Messi missed Saturday's 5-0 thrashing away to Sporting Gijon and is due to also sit out their forthcoming Spanish league match at Celta Vigo. In his absence, Luis Suarez and Neymar came to the fore at Gijon, who played the final 10 minutes with 10 men, as Suarez opened the scoring before Neymar netted twice in the closing stages. Javier Mascherano, Jordi Alba, Ivan Rakitic and Andres Iniesta were all rested at Sporting and the quartet are expected to return in Germany. With Rakitic and Iniesta returning to the midfield, Turkey international Arda Turan is likely to move forward to accompany Suarez and Neymar. ""It is important from the outset to be focused, to build confidence in our own strengths and to unsettle the opponent at the same time,"" added Enrique. ""This is especially important against Gladbach, they have incredible statistics at home."" Gladbach have won all three home games this season in Germany's top flight and they can expect passionate support at Borussia Park. It will be an emotional homecoming for ex-Gladbach goalkeeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen, who left for Barca in 2014 after 18 years. ""Ter Stegen has improved in every respect, both in personal and footballing terms,"" said Enrique. ""He speaks Spanish and even understands a little Catalan. ""He has accepted the challenge to move to Barca and face the competition."" Ter Stegen has already lifted the Champions League title, after Barca won the 2015 final in Berlin, and the Germany goalkeeper is relishing his Gladbach return. ""It was a pleasure to spend 18 years here, but since the transfer, everything changed for me,"" he said. ""Barca has been a good experience and I still have a lot of years in front of me here. ""It's of course very special to be here and to see lots of friends again."" Like Enrique, ter Stegen was predicting a busy night for Barca against a Gladbach team which likes to counter-attack. ""Gladbach exerts pressure very high up, we need to control the game and circulate the ball quickly,"" said the 24-year-old. ""We are prepared and want to win. We know it'll be a tough game."""
94,27/09/2016,12:33,Gladbach extend with Schubert ahead of Barca clash,"Borussia Monchengladbach have extended the contract of coach Andre Schubert until 2019 as his side prepare to face Barcelona, albeit minus Lionel Messi, in the Champions League on Wednesday.","Barcelona opened their Champions League campaign a fortnight ago with a 7-0 drubbing of Celtic at the Camp Nou while Gladbach suffered a 4-0 defeat at Pep Guardiola's Manchester City. Nevertheless, Schubert was on Tuesday rewarded with a new deal in recognition of steering Gladbach from bottom of the Bundesliga when he took over in September 2015 to Champions League qualification by finishing fourth. ""Andre is doing a very good job,"" said Gladbach's director of sport Max Eberl. ""He has led the team to the Champions League and in the 34 Bundesliga games under him, we have taken 65 points. ""That is an exceptional balance."" The show of faith in the 45-year-old coach is a timely boost ahead of the visit of Luis Enrique's Barcelona, who are without groin-injury victim Messi. The 29-year-old missed Saturday's 5-0 thrashing away to Sporting Gijon and is due to also sit out their forthcoming Spanish league match at Celta Vigo. In Messi's absence, Luis Suarez and Neymar came to the fore at Gijon, who played the final ten minutes with ten men, as Suarez opened the scoring before Neymar netted twice in the closing stages. Javier Mascherano, Jordi Alba, Ivan Rakitic and Andres Iniesta were all rested at Sporting and the quartet are expected to return in Germany. With Rakitic and Iniesta returning to the midfield, Turkey international Arda Turan is likely to move forward to accompany Suarez and Neymar. For the German hosts, Brazilian forward Raffael and winger Patrick Herrmann are expected to return after recent injuries. Both Tobias Strobl (thigh) and Alvaro Dominguez (back) will be absent, but there are no fresh injury concerns for Gladbach's coach Schubert. Barca goalkeeper Marc Andre ter Stegen will keep his place on his return to the club where he started his career before joining the Spanish giants in 2014. ""Borussia is my first love and that will always be the case. My farewell really was overwhelming,"" said the 24-year-old Germany shot-stopper, who won the 2015 Champions League with Barca in Berlin. ""My return to Gladbach has definitely come sooner than expected, and I absolutely cannot wait for it. ""I had a great time there, and spent my entire career there apart from the last two years. ""I think that the fans know just how much I took this club to heart and that I've always given everything for the club. ""But Barcelona was one of the few clubs I just couldn't turn down. I'm sure the Borussia fans can understand the decision that I made."""
95,14/09/2016,22:48,Aguero triple gives Man City belated lift-off,Sergio Aguero scored a hat-trick as Manchester City outclassed Borussia Moenchengladbach 4-0 in their rearranged Champions League opener at the Etihad Stadium on Wednesday.,"The game had been carried over from Tuesday due to a thunderstorm and Aguero made up for lost time with his second treble of the campaign after his hat-trick against Steaua Bucharest in the play-off round. Aguero, currently serving a domestic ban, struck twice in the first half and once in the second before giving way to Kelechi Iheanacho, who netted City's fourth. It gave Pep Guardiola a handsome victory in his first group-phase game as City manager. With his former club Barcelona, as well as Celtic, lying in wait in Group C, Guardiola had warned his players that a strong start in the competition was imperative. City reached the semi-finals for the first time last season, while Guardiola, who has won all seven of his games at the helm to date, is bidding to win the tournament for a third time. It was a third successive defeat against City for Andre Schubert's Gladbach, who lost twice to the English side in last season's group stage. After Tuesday's postponement, Gladbach left tongue-in-cheek letters of apology to the bosses of the fans who stayed on in Manchester for an extra day on the seats in the away section. The only change to the two teams announced for Tuesday's game was City's inclusion of Ilkay Gundogan in place of David Silva, who was rested ""as a precautionary measure"". Having been sidelined by a knee injury since signing from Borussia Dortmund for 20 million pounds ($26.5 million, 23.5 million euros), it was Gundogan's first outing in a City shirt. City attacked the game in a manner akin to their slick first-half display in Saturday's 2-1 win at Manchester United and it took them less than nine minutes to go in front. Aleksandar Kolarov fizzed a cross into the box from the left and Aguero darted in front of Andreas Christensen to stab home and end a five-game Champions League scoring drought. Visiting goalkeeper Yann Sommer saved sharply from Gundogan after an incisive move involving Fernandinho, Kevin De Bruyne and Aguero, while Fernandinho shot narrowly wide. Gundogan won the penalty that brought City's second goal when he was caught on the back of the leg by Christoph Kramer, although contact may have occurred just outside the box. Aguero sent Sommer the wrong way, taking his tally for the campaign to eight goals in all competitions. Sommer also had to beat away a shot from Gundogan, but Gladbach improved after Schubert sacrificed Kramer for Julian Korb and switched from a back three to a back four. A spectator up to that point, City goalkeeper Claudio Bravo got down smartly just before half-time to parry a crisp Lars Stindl effort. City initially had to work a bit harder for their chances in the second half. But the hosts raised their level with 15 minutes remaining and after Sommer had pulled off sharp saves to thwart Raheem Sterling and Aguero, the pair combined for City's third in the 77th minute. Sterling's pass down the inside-left channel took Korb out of the game and Aguero rounded Sommer before rolling in his hat-trick goal. Leroy Sane came on for his home debut and made a quick impression by teeing up Iheanacho to smash home in stoppage time."

Gladbach wanted the rescheduled game to take place at 6:00 pm local time on Wednesday, but City did not have enough staff members available at that time. ""We asked UEFA and Manchester City to play at six o'clock tomorrow because for sporting reasons we wanted to fly back to Germany (after the game),"" Gladbach spokesman Markus Aretz told reporters. ""But City could not make that possible. I don't know the reasons why. ""We're not happy with that. I think it's always a disadvantage when you have to stay one day longer than everything is planned."" All tickets for the match are still valid, but Gladbach expect that only between 400 and 500 of the estimated 1,600 away fans who travelled to the Etihad on Tuesday will be able to attend. ""With an away team it's a disadvantage, without fans,"" Aretz added. The game had been due to take place at 1845 GMT on Tuesday, but was called off 20 minutes earlier as a summer thunderstorm battered Manchester. It rained heavily in the city for several hours prior to the scheduled kick-off time and there was thunder and lightning overhead as fans made their way to the stadium. A group of UEFA officials carrying blue umbrellas performed a pitch inspection around 45 minutes prior to the scheduled kick-off time. Manchester City's goalkeepers Claudio Bravo and Willy Caballero had come out to warm up, but were ushered inside. The rain eased off as kick-off approached and the pitch appeared playable, but City announced at 1825 GMT that the match had been called off ""on safety and security grounds"". Conditions outside the ground were treacherous. Several hundred visiting Gladbach fans, many of them shirtless, remained in their seating section singing after the postponement was announced. Gladbach's players, wearing green and black club tracksuits, came out to salute them before returning to their changing room. City's German midfielder Ilkay Gundogan tweeted: ""What a pity #MCFCBMG couldn't take place. We're all looking forward to get the #UCL started. But it wasn't meant to be."" Manchester's Metrolink tram system had to be temporarily suspended due to the rain and photographs circulating on social media showed huge puddles in city centre streets. In the day's other Group C game, Barcelona crushed Celtic 7-0. Both teams are in league action on Saturday, City hosting Bournemouth in the Premier League and Gladbach entertaining Werder Bremen in the Bundesliga."

""Torrential rainfall across Manchester throughout the evening led to flooding in the areas around the ground, which forced the decision on safety and security grounds."" It had rained heavily in Manchester for several hours prior to the game's scheduled 1845 GMT kick-off and there was thunder and lightning overhead as fans made their way to the stadium. UEFA's rules state that if a match in the competition is postponed, a decision on when it will take place must be taken within two hours of the postponement. The match must either be played the following day or on a reserve date. UEFA's Champions League Twitter account wrote: ""Further information on the rearranged fixture will be provided in due course."" A group of UEFA officials carrying blue umbrellas performed a pitch inspection around 45 minutes prior to the scheduled kick-off time. Manchester City's goalkeepers Claudio Bravo and Willy Caballero had come out to warm up, but were ushered inside. The rain eased off as kick-off time approached, but with conditions outside treacherous, the decision to call the game off was made shortly before 1830 GMT. Several hundred visiting Gladbach fans, many of them shirtless, remained in their seating section singing after the postponement was announced. Gladbach's players, wearing green and black club tracksuits, came out to salute them before returning to their changing room. Manchester's Metrolink tram system had to be temporarily suspended due to the rain and photographs circulating on social media showed huge puddles in city centre streets. The match is due to be City manager Pep Guardiola's first group-stage game with the club. City and Gladbach met in last season's group phase, with the English club winning both games en route to the semi-finals."
98,12/09/2016,17:51,Guardiola challenges Man City ahead of Gladbach opener,Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola warned on Monday that his players have not yet met his expectations ahead of their opening Champions League group game at home to Borussia Moenchengladbach.,"City have won all six of their matches in all competitions this season and moved clear at the top of the Premier League with a slick 2-1 derby win at Manchester United on Saturday. It has raised hope among City's fans that Guardiola is already on course for glory, but he says his team must raise their level if they are to finish the season with silverware. ""We are first after four games in the Premier League, but the way we have played until now will not be enough to win the Premier League,"" he said. ""We have to improve to win the Premier League. Of course we are so happy for the results, for the numbers, for the way we are playing after two months. ""But it is not enough to win the Premier League or to achieve big targets in the Champions League."" Guardiola is a two-time Champions League winner and has never failed to reach the semi-finals in his seven seasons coaching in the tournament with Barcelona and Bayern Munich. City broke new ground in the competition last season under Guardiola's predecessor Manuel Pellegrini, reaching the last four for the first time before losing 1-0 on aggregate to eventual winners Real Madrid. Once again they find themselves in an arduous pool, with Barcelona and Scottish giants Celtic completing Group C. City beat Gladbach twice in last season's group phase, but needed a 90th-minute Sergio Aguero penalty to win in Germany and a late salvo of goals from Raheem Sterling and Wilfried Bony to prevail at home. With a trip to Celtic to follow, and then an emotional double-header against his former club Barcelona, Guardiola knows City cannot afford to make a sluggish start at the Etihad Stadium on Tuesday. ""They are a brave team, (with a) brave coach -- one of the best teams in Europe,"" Guardiola told his pre-match press conference at the City Football Academy training complex. ""They have a lot of quality. The draw was difficult for us. Barcelona was there, especially with Gladbach."" Aguero is available for City despite currently serving a three-game domestic suspension and has shaken off a calf problem that forced him to withdraw from international duty with Argentina. Close-season signing Ilkay Gundogan, the Germany midfielder, could make his debut after overcoming a knee problem, while captain Vincent Kompany is close to a return after thigh surgery. After 37 years during which they did not play a single game in Europe's top club competition, Gladbach are appearing in the Champions League group phase for the second season running. Fourth in the Bundesliga last season, 33 points below Guardiola's Bayern, they reached the group stage in impressive fashion by crushing Swiss side Young Boys 9-2 on aggregate in the play-off round. Andre Schubert's men face a battle to avoid a second successive group-stage elimination, but American midfielder Fabian Johnson believes they can pull off an upset against City. ""I don't think there is a team in the world that cannot be got at,"" he told the Bundesliga website. ""Obviously City have an outstanding squad with many world-class players. They've also made an impressive start to the season. ""So we respect them, but we don't fear them. We know what we are capable of and showed that last season -- against Man City, too."" Gladbach opened their league campaign by beating Bayer Leverkusen 2-1, but went down 3-1 at Freiburg on Saturday. Alvaro Dominguez and Josip Drmic are long-term absentees for the Foals, while Marvin Schulz and Mamadou Doucoure are yet to feature this season due to groin and muscular injuries respectively."
99,08/06/2016,13:54,Kramer leaves Leverkusen for Moenchengladbach,"German international Christoph Kramer has left Bayer Leverkusen to rejoin Borussia Moenchengladbach, the buying club said in a statement released on Wednesday.","The 25-year-old midfielder has signed a five-year contract tying him to Gladbach until June 2021. He previously spent two years at Gladbach from 2013 to 2015, on loan from Leverkusen. ""A year ago we regretfully let Christoph return to Leverkusen and we are even more delighted now that he can come back to Moenchengladbach,"" said sports director Max Eberl. Kramer was part of the Germany squad that won the World Cup in Brazil in 2014 during his previous spell at Moenchengladbach but wasn't picked for Euro 2016. He played 73 times for Borussia during his previously spell while he also went on loan to Bochum in the German second division after originally breaking into the Leverkusen reserve side in 2010. He played 28 times in the league for Leverkusen last season but his position in the side was set to come under threat from Charles Aranguiz and new-signing Julian Baumgartlinger. Leverkusen finished third in the Bundesliga, one place above Gladbach. Kramer will fill the void created at Gladbach by Switzerland international Granit Xhaka's move to Arsenal."

Nordtveit has been capped 28 times by Norway and can also play in central defence. He will officially become a West Ham player on July 1. ""It has always been a dream for me to play in the Premier League and now I have a big opportunity to do that for West Ham. I cannot wait to start,"" he told West Ham's official website. ""This team has something special, a spirit in the team that I can fit into. I will work hard and hopefully I can get some good moments at this club. ""I'm a player who can play many roles on the pitch, but I'm from Norway so maybe a little bit more running, tackles and try to spread a few balls around me.

101,29/04/2016,02:05,Bayern poised to make history despite Atletico distraction,"Pep Guardiola's Bayern Munich can become the first club to win a fourth consecutive Bundesliga title by beating Borussia Moenchengladbach on Saturday, amidst the distraction of their Champions League semi-final.","Bayern hold a seven-point lead and with three games left, a win over Gladbach at Munich's Allianz Arena will confirm a fourth straight German league title, a feat no other team has achieved before. But Bayern are still smarting from Wednesday's 1-0 Champions League defeat at Atletico Madrid. Guardiola has been criticised by the German media (""Has Pep mullered Bayern's final chances?', asked Bild""), plus ex-Bayern coach Ottmar Hitzfeld (""the tactic didn't work""), for his selection. Thomas Mueller, Bayern's top-scorer in Europe, and Franck Ribery both started on the bench leaving Bayern with it all to do in Tuesday's return leg in Munich. Guardiola scoffed when asked if he would rest some of his stars against Gladbach. ""We still need another win, we only have a few days to prepare and then we face Atletico three days later,"" he said. ""We have to win against Gladbach first."" In the wake of the Atletico defeat, only their fifth of the season, Bayern are feeling the pressure in their bid for a repeat of the 2013 treble. ""We would make a mistake if we quarrel now, I want to go to Milan,"" said chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge as the Champions League final will be held in the Italian city on May 28. Guardiola is likely to start with Germany's World Cup winner Mario Goetze up front against Gladbach. Defender Jerome Boateng could well play his first minutes since suffering a groin injury in January. Having beaten Munich 3-1 at Borussia Park in December, Gladbach are chasing a rare home-and-away double but will be without US international Fabian Johnson, who has a leg injury. Should Gladbach shock Bayern, Borussia Dortmund will look to delay the Munich title party with victory over last season's runners up VfL Wolfsburg at the Signal Iduna Park. Dortmund are set to lose their third star player to Bayern in three years after captain and defender Mats Hummels announced he wants to join the Bavarian giants next season. Dortmund have said they will accept only ""an exceptional offer"" for the World Cup-winner, who has a market value of 32 million euros ($36.32m). Should he leave with a year left on his contract, Hummels will follow Goetze, who left for Bayern in 2013 for 37m euros, and striker Robert Lewandowski, who signed on a free transfer in 2014. Dortmund have won their last three games by a 3-0 scoreline and have already qualified for the Champions League. Despite reaching the quarter-finals of the Champions League, Wolfsburg have lost their Bundesliga bite in 2016 and are now 10th, six points away from the European places. Their 2-0 defeat to Augsburg last Saturday meant they have dropped 16 points in their previous six games. Bayer Leverkusen could take a big step towards a direct Champions League berth when they host fellow European aspirants Hertha Berlin on Saturday. Leverkusen have won their last six, conceding just two goals in the process, and could secure their place in the Champions League's group stage with a win. Fourth-placed Hertha have not won since March. There will be a crunch clash on Monday in the relegation battle when Werder Bremen host VfB Stuttgart. Stuttgart, who are 15th, are only two points clear of Werder and a win would see Bremen climb out of the relegation play-off spot with two games left. ""We're fully aware of how crucial this game is. We're going to do all we can to claim the points, I can guarantee that,"" said Bremen's Senegal international Papy Djilobodji. Fixtures (all times 1330 GMT unless stated)"

The result keeps Andre Schubert's Gladbach fifth in the Bundesliga table, but just one point from fourth, which carries a Champions League's qualifier place. Gladbach took the lead at Borussia Park on seven minutes when Hoffenheim defender Jeremy Toljan beat Andre Hahn to the ball, but stabbed it into his own net. Gladbach doubled their tally when Brazilian forward Raffael's shot was blocked by Hoffenheim goalkeeper Oliver Baumann, but Mahmoud Dahoud slammed home the loose ball just before the break. Hoffenheim's Croatia striker Andrej Kramaric, on loan from Leicester City, pulled a goal back after the Gladbach defence was pressed into a mistake on 54 minutes.

The result sees Gladbach climb from seventh to fourth and are now just three points behind Hertha with Andre Schubert's team hunting a return to the Champions League next season with their highest league win for five years. Gladbach took the lead when Hertha's goalkeeper Rune Jarstein made a hash of his clearance kick on 14 minutes. Borussia's Mahmoud Dahoud intercepted the ball and his pass found Hazard, who fired home. Gladbach doubled their tally with an hour gone when Hahn marked his first start in five months with a superb individual effort. Having received the ball with his back to goal, Hahn made enough space to turn and hit the top left-hand corner. It marked his sweet return to Gladbach's starting line-up after a horror tackle by Schalke's Johannes Geis left him with a fractured leg and torn knee ligament last October. The floodgates opened in the last 15 minutes as Herrmannn finished a move he started with Hazard on 76 minutes before the Belgian claimed his second on 80 minutes. With the Hertha defence in disarray, Ibrahima Traore replaced Hazard and scored two minutes after coming off the bench to claim Gladbach's fifth. On Saturday, Franck Ribery's spectacular bicycle kick sealed Bayern Munich's 1-0 win over Eintracht Frankfurt to keep Pep Guardiola's side five points clear. With six games left, the Bavarians remain on track to become the first German club to win four straight Bundesliga titles. Second-placed Borussia Dortmund later came from behind to seal a dramatic 3-2 win over Werder Bremen as super subs Shinji Kagawa and Adrian Ramos scored the hosts' goals which confirms their Champions League place for next season. South Korea international Koo Ja-Cheol netted for relegation-threatened Augsburg as his club lost 4-2 at Mainz. Augsburg stay clear of the relegation places on goal difference and are level on 27 points with Frankfurt and Hoffenheim, who host Cologne on Sunday evening. Bottom side Hanover 96 are ten points from safety with six league games left after losing 3-0 at home to Hamburg. Schalke dropped to seventh, and risk losing their Europa League place for next season, after their 3-0 drubbing at Ingolstadt. Darmstadt pulled themselves two points away from the relegation battle with a 2-2 draw at home to Stuttgart. On Friday, Wolfsburg were hammered 3-0 at Bayer Leverkusen in a poor build-up to Wednesday's Champions League quarter-final, first leg at home to Real Madrid."
105,28/02/2016,18:01,Gladbach in thrilling fightback at Augsburg,Borussia Moenchengladbach climbed to fourth in the German league table on Sunday after a pulsating fightback earned them a 2-2 draw at Augsburg.,"The Brazilian striker Raffael had sent Gladbach into a half-time lead before the game exploded into life with three goals in five second-half minutes. Despite their midweek Europa League exertions and exit at the hands of Liverpool, Augsburg, who are 13th, roared back with two goals in quick succession. Iceland striker Alfred Finnbogason thumped a header home on 50 minutes, his first goal since joining from Olympiakos, before Brazil winger Caiuby slotted neatly home just three minutes later. Gladbach's American winger Fabian Johnson however gave the perfect answer as he smashed home his shot on 55 minutes to make it 2-2. The visitors should have won as Sweden's Oscar Wendt fired wide late on with the goal at his mercy while only a Marwin Hitz save denied Borussia captain Granit Xhaka. Gladbach could be usurped from fourth if Bayer Leverkusen win later on Sunday at Mainz. Also playing later Sunday are second-placed Borussia Dortmund, who are hosting second-bottom Hoffenheim. Meawhile it was back to business for Bayern Munich after their midweek Champions league drtaw at Juventus, they racked up yet another win on Saturday. Robert Lewandowski scored his 23rd league goal of the season as Bayern went 11 points clear with a 2-0 win at Wolfsburg. Pep Guardiola's outfit now have 62 points out of a possible 69, their tally exactly double that of Wolfsburg, who are eighth. Bayern could effectively wrap up the league title with two victories in the coming week, at home to Mainz on Wednesday and then at Dortmund in next Saturday's key match. A tight struggle in Wolfsburg was settled by second-half goals as Kingsley Coman scored for the first time since November before Lewandowski netted for the 33rd time this season in all competitions. Elsewhere, bottom side Hanover gained ground in the relegation battle with a shock 2-1 win at Stuttgart after an eight-match losing streak. Japan midfielder Hiroshi Kiyotake capped his first start since November after injury by setting up both goals for defender Christian Schulz. It means just four points separate the bottom three sides, but Hanover remain five points from safety. Swiss striker Josip Drmic scored his first goal for Hamburg in their 1-1 draw at home to Ingolstadt, whose striker Lukas Hinterseer headed an equaliser. Both sides are in mid-table, but Werder Bremen are deep in the relegation battle despite their 2-2 draw at home to Darmstadt. Anthony Ujah's early opener was cancelled out by Darmstadt's Sandro Wagner, and Aytac Sulu headed Darmstadt ahead on 82 minutes before Claudio Pizarro gave Bremen a 90th-minute equaliser. On Friday, Hertha Berlin strengthened their grip on third place with a 1-0 victory at Cologne as Vedad Ibisevic scored the winner to break their run of six games without a win."
106,19/02/2016,02:10,Bayern eye club record at home to Darmstadt,Bayern Munich could make club history on Saturday as a clean sheet against Darmstadt in the Bundesliga would see Pep Guardiola's side go a record six home games without conceding a goal.,"Arsenal were the last club to score against Bayern at Munich's Allianz Arena back in November when Olivier Giroud scored the Gunners' consolation in a 5-1 loss. Since that Champions League group game, Bayern have won all five of their home games in all competitions without conceding a single goal and hold an eight-point lead at the top of the Bundesliga. Guardiola's team are in no mood to give Darmstadt any hope of a first win in Munich in their final match before their Champions League last 16, first-leg clash at Juventus next Tuesday. Especially as Darmstadt have picked up 17 of their 24 points this season away from home. ""They will play very deep and very compact,"" said Bayern midfielder Xabi Alonso. ""We will have to be patient and it'll be important to get the first goal. ""It's all about Darmstadt for now, we want to keep our eight-point lead. Only afterwards will we think about Juventus."" With 21 goals to his credit, Bayern striker Robert Lewandowski has scored almost as many goals as the 22 the entire Darmstadt team has managed. The visitors' cause is not helped by a raft of suspensions. Peter Niemeyer, Jerome Gondorf, Aytac Sulu, Marcel Heller and Konstantin Rausch are all banned after each picked up yellow cards in last Saturday's 2-1 defeat to Bayer Leverkusen. ""We have registered that. However, I believe that no one wants to miss this chance to play in front of an audience of millions,"" said Darmstadt coach Dirk Schuster confidently. Guardiola hopes to have centre-backs Medhi Benatia and Serdar Tasci fit as he was unable to play a single central defender in last weekend's win at Augsburg after Holger Badstuber fractured an ankle. Dortmund will be looking to make it nine games undefeated at Leverkusen on Sunday. Thomas Tuchel's Dortmund are in impressive form as last Saturday's 1-0 win over bottom side Hanover 96 left them 13 points clear of third-placed Bayer. Having sat out the Hanover win, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang will be looking to add to his 20 goals in as many league games to rival Lewandowski. The last time Leverkusen beat Dortmund at the BayArena was in May 2007, but Roger Schmidt's men have picked up 14 of a possible 18 points and are undefeated in their last six games. Leverkusen will again be without striker Javier Hernandez after the Mexican tore a buttock muscle in their German Cup defeat to Werder Bremen 10 days ago. Cologne fans plan a protest before kick-off of Saturday's match at Borussia Moenchengladbach over the restricted number of away fans allowed. Gladbach will be without centre-back Martin Stranzl, who tore his right calf in training on Wednesday as they look to bounce back from Sunday's shock defeat to Hamburg. Fresh from their Champions League last 16, first-leg win at Gent, Wolfsburg are at Hertha Berlin on Saturday without defender Sebastian Jung. The right-back tore the cruciate ligament in his left knee in Belgium and is expected to miss the rest of the season after limping out of Wolfsburg's 3-2 victory.

107,14/02/2016,17:44,Hamburg shock Glad to break winless streak,Hamburg pulled clear of the Bundesliga's relegation battle on Sunday with a shock 3-2 comeback win at home to Borussia Moenchengladbach to end their six-game winless streak.,"Bruno Labbadia's Hamburg won for the first time since the end of November to climb from 13th to 11th, but more importantly, are now six points above the relegation zone. Gladbach took the lead through US international Fabian Johnson on 14 minutes, but hosts Hamburg bludgeoned their way back. Lewis Holtby squandered a golden chance on 18 minutes when the Hamburg midfielder opted to pass with the goal at his mercy. Then Gladbach defender Martin Hinteregger stabbed the ball into his own net from a corner on 38 minutes to put Hamburg 1-0 up. And just three minutes later, Artjoms Rudnevs landed another blow by gathering Rene Adler's long-ball from the Hamburg goal and beating Oscar Wendt to make it 2-1 at the break. Midfielder Ivo Ilicevic extended Hamburg's lead when he headed home from a corner with ten minutes to go. But Gladbach's Brazilian striker Raffael gave his side brief hope by netting a late goal to make it 3-2 on 88 minutes. With Bayern Munich at Augsburg on Sunday, Henrikh Mkhitaryan's second-half goal sealed Borussia Dortmund's 1-0 win over Hanover 96 on Saturday to trim the champions' lead to five points. Dortmund were without injured star striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, who missed his first league match of the season after netting 20 goals in as many Bundesliga games. Wolfsburg warmed up for Wednesday's Champions League, last 16, first leg at Gent with a 2-0 win at home to Ingolstadt. It was their first victory since knocking Manchester United out of the Champions League in December. Dieter Hecking's Wolfsburg won for the first time in six games but stay eighth after first-half goals by Germany midfielder Julian Draxler and defender Robin Knoche. Bayer Leverkusen moved up from seventh to third as they bounced back from their shock German Cup exit at the hands of Werder Bremen in mid-week with a 2-1 comeback win at Darmstadt. On a heavy pitch, Sandro Wagner stabbed the ball home to give Darmstadt an early lead, despite Leverkusen goalkeeper Bernd Leno catching him around the throat with his forearm. Leverkusen drew level when Darmstadt defender Aytac Sulu headed into his own net on 62 minutes before Julian Brandt started the move he finished by tapping in the winner on 77 minutes. VfB Stuttgart's impressive form continued as they picked up their fifth straight league win to go 10th with a 2-0 win at home to Hertha Berlin. A long-range strike from Ivory Coast defensive midfielder Serey Die and a second-half goal from left winger Filip Kostic sealed the hosts' win. Hertha suffered their first defeat in nine games since losing 2-0 at Bayern in November to drop to fourth. The youngest manager in Bundesliga history made his debut when Julian Nagelsmann, 28, was on Hoffenheim's bench for their 1-1 draw at Werder Bremen in a basement battle. Nagelsmann took over after predecessor Huub Stevens resigned on Wednesday due to heart problems. The result leaves both teams in the bottom three. Eintracht Frankfurt remain just above the relegation places after their 3-1 defeat at Cologne. Midfielder Yannick Gerhardt, defender Dominique Heintz and striker Anthony Modeste scored the hosts' goals."
108,04/02/2016,13:47,Gladbach out to beat Bremen with the 'ketchup effect',Borussia Moenchengladbach hope a home win over Werder Bremen on Friday will give them the necessary 'ketchup effect' to turn results around after the bitter taste of successive Bundesliga defeats.,"Gladbach started the year fourth in the table, but January defeats at home to Borussia Dortmund and away to Mainz saw Andre Schubert's side drop to sixth and in danger of slipping out of the European places. They were bottom of the table when Schubert took over in September after five straight defeats, but rocketed up the table by going unbeaten in Schubert's first 10 league games from mid-September to December. ""Our recent games have gone very differently to how things went in the first half of the season,"" admitted sports director Max Eberl, with Gladbach having won just one of their last six games since their stunning 3-1 home win against leaders Bayern Munich in early December. Gladbach lost 1-0 away to Mainz in Germany's top flight last Friday after wasting a string of chances while the hosts scored on a rare foray into the Borussia half. ""If we're being honest, we have to talk about having had 'a false start',"" goalkeeper Yann Sommer said about Gladbach's two defeats at the start of 2016. Norwegian defender Havard Nordtveit used an unusual phrase to explain that if Gladbach put in the same effort against Bremen as they did at Mainz, they stand a good chance of getting back to winning ways. ""If we again work hard, then we'll have the 'ketchup effect' against Bremen,"" he said. ""That's when everything all comes out at once. ""I am sure we will take the three points from the game against Bremen."" Viktor Skripnik's Bremen are third from bottom, but have shown plenty of fight in the relegation battle. Werder returned from the winter break by beating Schalke 3-1 away, then fought back with two late goals from Peru veteran Claudio Pizarro to earn a 3-3 draw at home to third-placed Hertha Berlin last Saturday. And Bremen have nothing to fear having already beaten Gladbach 2-1 at home last August in the league, then enjoying a dramatic 4-3 win at Borussia Park in the last 16 of the German Cup in December. ""They will certainly respect us, as we have beaten them twice this season already,"" said Bremen midfielder Fin Bartels. ""Let's see if we can't present something new there."""
109,28/01/2016,14:00,Gladbach out to patch up leaky defence at Mainz,Borussia Moenchengladbach coach Andre Schubert admits his side must fix their leaking defence if they are to make a repeat appearance in the Champions League next season.,"Gladbach finished bottom of their Champions League group this term, but are currently fourth in the Bundesliga table, amongst the European places, despite last Saturday's 3-1 defeat at home to Borussia Dortmund. Schubert has pulled Gladbach up the table from bottom after five straight defeats at the start of the season under predecessor Lucien Favre. But the recent horror record of 24 goals conceded in their last eight games in all competitions tells it's own tale. The Foals need to stop the rot at mid-table Mainz on Friday night with only strugglers Stuttgart having leaked more goals this season in Germany's top flight. Schubert points to missing stars, injured centre-back Alvaro Dominguez, plus the suspension of tough-tackling Swiss captain Granit Xhaka, for their recent poor defensive record. ""We want to attack and play offensively, and, of course, concede fewer goals, because that increases the probability of picking up points,"" said Schubert. ""The time is now to find solutions, so we can defend better with the players available to us without neglecting our strengths in attack."" Eighth-placed Mainz are winless in their last three games, but in Turkey international Yunus Malli, they have a dangerous goal-scoring midfielder, who Borussia Dortmund has tried to buy this January. ""Although Mainz has failed to score in their last three games, we meet a team who can be dangerous,"" warned Schubert. ""They are very compact, are good at switching to attack and have scored a lot of goals on the counter-attack and are physically very strong. ""Moreover, in Yunus Malli they have a high-quality attacker, who roams behind the striker, repeatedly goes deep and is a threat to goal."""
110,23/01/2016,20:27,Dortmund see off Gladbach to trim Bayern's lead,Borussia Dortmund consolidated second place in the Bundesliga on Saturday with a convincing 3-1 win at Borussia Moenchengladbach to trim Bayern Munich's runaway lead in the table.,"Goals by Dortmund's Marco Reus, Henrikh Mkhitaryan and Ilkay Gundogan, with a consolation from Gladbach's Raffael, sealed the win which left Dortmund both eight points behind Bayern and eight points ahead of third-placed Hertha Berlin. Dortmund took the lead at Moenchengladbach's Borussia Park when Gundogan's superb pass in behind the hosts' defence allowed Reus to rifle his shot across the face of the goal into the far corner on 41 minutes. It could have been 2-0 at the break when Mkhitaryan fired wide with the goal at his mercy. With 50 minutes on the clock, Reus turned goal provider by picking out Mkhitaryan unmarked inside the area to fire home. Brazilian striker Raffael trimmed the lead by pulling one back for Gladbach seven minutes later before Mkhitaryan's pass found Gundogan in space to flicked his deft shot into the net with 15 minutes left. This was only Gladbach's second league defeat since Andre Schubert took charge last September with the team bottom of the table. They stay fourth. On Friday, Bayern kicked-off the second half of the season with a 2-1 win at Hamburg thanks to Robert Lewandowski's two goals. At the other end of the table on Saturday, veteran Portugal striker Hugo Almeida marked his debut for relegation-threatened Hanover 96 with a goal. But he was unable to prevent their 2-1 defeat at home to Darmstadt as Sandro Wagner scored both of the visitors' goals. The defeat left Hanover bottom as ex-Bremen coach Thomas Schaaf took charge of his first game since replacing Michael Frontzeck over the winter break while Darmstadt are 12th. Third-placed Hertha missed their chance to close the gap behind Dortmund with a goalless draw at home to mid-table Augsburg at Berlin's Olympic Stadium in wintry conditions. Stuttgart pulled themselves away from the relegation places with a 3-1 win at Cologne to move up to 14th as Jurgen Kramny picked up his second straight win having been given the head coach role full-time. Stuttgart finished 2015 with a shock win over Wolfsburg and backed it up by bouncing back despite Anthony Modeste converting an early penalty for Cologne. Stuttgart roared back with goals from Daniel Didavi, Timo Werner and Christian Gentner. Bayer Leverkusen stay fifth after their 1-1 draw at Hoffenheim as Jiloan Hamad's goal for the hosts was cancelled out by Leverkusen captain Omer Toprak's late strike to rescue a point for the visitors as the hosts climbed off the bottom. Ingolstadt, who are in their first season in Germany's top flight, earned a 1-0 win at home to Mainz through a Moritz Hartmann penalty to go tenth in the table. Champions League side Wolfsburg, who have drawn Ghent in the last 16, are at Eintracht Frankfurt on Sunday, while Schalke are at home in the evening against strugglers Werder Bremen."
111,08/12/2015,22:52,Birthday boy Sterling sends Man City top,Raheem Sterling marked his 21st birthday with a decisive brace as Manchester City secured top spot in Champions League Group D by overpowering in-form Borussia Moenchengladbach 4-2 on Tuesday.,"With 10 minutes left City trailed, goals from Julian Korb and Raffael having cancelled out David Silva's 16th-minute opener, but a stunning late surge by the hosts saw Sterling strike twice in two minutes to put City in charge before substitute Wilfried Bony added a fourth. It lifted Manuel Pellegrini's side above Juventus, beaten 1-0 by Sevilla in Spain in the other group game, and meant that Gladbach missed out on even the consolation of a Europa League berth. City's failure to secure top spot in the group cost them dearly in the past two seasons, when they lost twice to Barcelona in the last 16, but they will now approach Monday's draw safe in the knowledge that neither Barcelona, Real Madrid nor Bayern Munich will await in the next round. Gladbach had beaten Bayern 3-1 on Saturday, becoming the first team to do so in the Bundesliga this season, but three days on they find themselves out of all European competition after the first defeat of coach Andre Schubert's 13-game reign. With Sergio Aguero still nursing a heel problem and Bony starting on the bench, Sterling led the line for City at the Etihad Stadium and after an early scare when Korb shot over, he created the game's opening goal. Receiving the ball on the left-hand corner of the area, Sterling released Silva with a cunning back-heel and the Spaniard lashed the ball high past Yann Sommer at the near post for his first goal since August 10. But it took the visitors just three minutes to draw level as Fabian Johnson swapped passes with Lars Stindl before driving into the box and squaring for Korb, who bludgeoned home right-footed. Fabian Delph gave City a chance to restore their lead with an inviting cross from the right, but it evaded Sterling at the far post and a minute later Gladbach were in front, albeit in slightly fortuitous circumstances. Oscar Wendt's pull-back from the left was mishit by Johnson, but Raffael, ambling across the ball's trajectory, managed to nudge it past Joe Hart with his knee. City made a slow start to the second half, but before long the visitors' goal was under siege. Nico Elvedi's attempt to chest Fernandinho's cross back to Sommer almost let Sterling in, obliging the Swiss goalkeeper to block with his legs. Sommer also fielded shots from Silva and Sterling, before a crisp volley from the latter obliged him to spring to his left and produce a fine one-handed save. Pellegrini introduced Bony and Jesus Navas for Delph and Kevin De Bruyne and after Nicolas Otamendi had headed over, Sterling equalised, finishing coolly with his left foot after Gael Clichy had wriggled to the byline and crossed. In a flash City were in front, Silva improbably flicking on a high ball for Bony, who nutmegged Elvedi and teed up Sterling to sweep an assured finish inside the right-hand post from the edge of the box. Four minutes later it was all over, Bony finishing at the second attempt after his initial shot was blocked by Havard Nordveit, and Hart's save from Thorgan Hazard's deflected shot spared the home fans an anxious final few minutes."
112,07/12/2015,02:10,Man City seek consolation against storming Gladbach,"Beaten and bruised, Manchester City entertain a revitalised Borussia Moenchengladbach on Tuesday looking for a restorative victory that could yet yield a first-place finish in Champions League Group D.","City conceded top spot in the Premier League following a 2-0 defeat at Stoke City on Saturday and must now contend with a Gladbach team revelling in the feat of becoming the first team to defeat Bayern Munich in this season's Bundesliga. City must win and hope that group leaders Juventus lose away to Sevilla if they are to finish first in the group, but with a place in the last 16 already secure and a glut of injuries to occupy his thoughts, manager Manuel Pellegrini is not putting any pressure on his players. ""A lot of people were disappointed not to be top of the group, but it is not finished,"" said Pellegrini, whose side lost 1-0 at Juventus in their previous group fixture. ""We have to play one game more and Juventus have to go to Sevilla. Sevilla are fighting for the Europa League and we play here against Borussia. If you ask me, I prefer to be qualified. ""We are supposing that if we finish second we will have a bad draw, but maybe this year we can have a bad draw if we finish top of the group. There are a lot of things in the future we are not thinking about."" City were deservedly beaten at the Britannia Stadium, where a slick Stoke side prevailed courtesy of an early Marko Arnautovic brace and could conceivably have won more comfortably. The visitors' disappointment was compounded when Fernando limped off with a hamstring injury late on, exacerbating the injury glut that has ripped the core from Pellegrini's team. Centre-back and captain Vincent Kompany, midfielder Yaya Toure and attacking figurehead Sergio Aguero are all expected to miss Tuesday's game at the Etihad Stadium, while Pablo Zabaleta and Samir Nasri remain sidelined. But Pellegrini can at least call upon playmaker David Silva, who made his first league start in nine weeks at Stoke following an ankle injury. ""I always say in this team we don't depend on one or two players, but of course this team plays better, and in the style I like to play, with Silva in the starting line-up,"" said Pellegrini. ""He can change the way we play because everyone tries to link with him and he makes the tempo of the game, and he has the most accurate passing in the last third for our team."" Gladbach can no longer reach the knockout phase, but they will go into the Europa League if they match or better Sevilla's result against Juventus. Saturday's 3-1 win at home to Pep Guardiola's Bayern extended Gladbach's unbeaten run under new coach Andre Schubert to 10 league games and having risen from bottom of the table to third, they travel to Manchester brimming with belief. ""We want to continue playing in Europe and this gave us a lot of confidence to keep working hard,"" said Swedish left-back Oscar Wendt, who opened the scoring at Borussia Park. Schubert changed tack by adopting a three-man defence for the visit of the champions-elect and winger Fabian Johnson said the outcome of the match proved that his side can beat any opponent. ""Even though we were up against possibly the best team in the world, we went out there determined to win,"" said the United States international, who scored Gladbach's third. ""The fact it went so well, perhaps we didn't even expect that. That makes the win all the sweeter. We were brave and unlike a lot of other teams, we didn't sit back. That paid off in the end."""
113,05/12/2015,17:30,Bayern suffer first Bundesliga defeat of season,"Bundesliga leaders Bayern Munich lost their unbeaten record in Germany's top tier this season in emphatic style on Saturday, going down 3-1 away to Borussia Moenchengladbach.","It is only the second time Pep Guardiola's Bayern have lost this season after they went down 2-0 at Arsenal in the Champions League in October. Gladbach coach Andre Schubert praised his side's 'sensational performance' while Pep Guardiola said Bayern must learn from their mistakes. ""We lost our control after they went 1-0 up and they started to couter-attack,"" said the Spaniard. ""We have to be able to learn from this game that we should never allow that to happen."" It was also Bayern's first Bundesliga defeat since losing 2-1 at Freiburg last May as second-half goals by Oscar Wendt, Lars Stindl and Fabian Johnson left the Bavarian giants reeling. Franck Ribery scored Bayern's late consolation goal on his return after nearly nine months out with injury. ""It's a pity, but it's our own fault,"" admitted Ribery. ""We will concentrate on the next game and hope to win,"" he added as Ingolstadt can expect a Bayern backlash in Munich next Saturday. Bayern's eight-point lead at the top of the table will be cut if second-placed Borussia Dortmund win later at Wolfsburg. Gladbach took a deserved lead when Raffael gave a return pass to Wendt and the Swedish international fired past Bayern goalkeeper Manuel Neuer on 54 minutes. The hosts doubled their lead when Stindl volleyed home on 66 minutes. There were scenes of pure joy amongst the home fans at Borussia Park when Bayern centre-back Jerome Boateng was caught out of position and Johnson sprinted away to launch a shot past Neuer on 71 minutes. Bayern pulled a goal back nine minutes from time when Ribery marked his 300th game in the famous red shirt by scoring off the bench to celebrate his first game in 269 days following a persistent ankle injury. This is the first time Bayern have conceded three goals since losing 3-0 at Barcelona in the first leg of last season's Champions League semi-finals. And their defeat leaves French champions Paris Saint-Germain as the only remaining unbeaten club in any of Europe's traditional big five leagues. For Gladbach, the victory continues their fairytale rise from bottom of the table to third as they remain unbeaten after 10 Bundesliga games under new coach Andre Schubert. Ten-man Bayer Leverkusen warmed-up for their home clash with Champions League holders Barcelona on Wednesday by losing 2-1 at Hertha Berlin in the capital as Javier Hernandez netted what proved to be a consolation goal. 'Chicharito' scored his seventh goal in 12 league games for Leverkusen to cancel out Vladimir Darida's early opening goal for Hertha at Berlin's Olympic Stadium. Leverkusen were reduced to 10 men when centre-back Sebastian Boenisch was shown a straight red card with just 17 minutes gone for a brutal sliding tackle on Hertha's 19-year-old left-back Yanni Regaesel. Hertha scored their second through USA international John Anthony Brooks and the win left them fourth as Leverkusen drop to eighth. Mainz are seventh after their 3-1 win at Hamburg while Mark Uth's 96th-minute goal rescued a 1-1 draw for struggling Hoffenheim at Ingolstadt. Augsburg escaped the bottom three with a 1-0 win at Cologne as Paraguay striker Raul Bobadilla fired in a second-half free-kick. On Friday, Schalke broke their five-match winless streak with a 3-1 victory over Hanover 96 which left them sixth in the table. The Royal Blues won their first league game since downing Hertha in mid-October with goals by Johannes Geis, from a penalty, Klaas-Jan Huntelaar and Franco di Santo."

""It's clear Bayern are at a different level at the moment, where, if we're being honest, no other team in Europe or the world is at,"" the Swiss midfielder told German Sky Sports. ""But Bayern are also beatable. Every team is beatable, you just have to find the right solutions to break them down. ""On Saturday, we will of course try everything to be successful and above all else, we are a power at home."" In-form Gladbach want to become only the second team this season to take German league points off Bayern. Pep Guardiola's Munich are running away with the Bundesliga title after taking 40 from a maximum 42 points with 13 wins from 14 matches and only a goalless draw at Eintracht Frankfurt in October blots their league copybook. Gladbach are unbeaten in their last nine league games under head coach Andre Schubert and worked hard to protect their record by fighting back from 3-1 down at bottom side Hoffenheim last Saturday to claim a 3-3 draw. Schubert says his side have nothing to fear from taking on all-conquering Bayern, who have lost just once this season when Arsenal beat them 2-0 in London in the Champions League. ""Of course, we will try and find the right solutions against Bayern,"" said Gladbach's head coach. ""We have the necessary fitness, the huge desire and the heart. It will be exciting to see if we can surprise them."" Bayern have just five games left before the winter break starts and Germany forward Thomas Mueller has scored in each of his last five games in the famous red shirt. Director of sport Matthias Sammer has described him as 'irreplaceable' amidst to UK media reports Chelsea want to sign him to potentially replace Diego Costa. Munich were buoyed by the news both France winger Franck Ribery and Spain midfielder Thiago are back in training, but neither will be fit for the Gladbach game. Second plays third on Saturday evening when Borussia Dortmund are at Wolfsburg with Gabon striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang looking to add to his tally of 17 goals as the league's top scorer. The Dortmund star has only failed to score in two of his 14 league games so far this season and has 25 goals in all competitions. There will be plenty of attention on Dortmund captain Mats Hummels, who started on the bench in last Sunday's 4-1 trouncing of strugglers Stuttgart. Wolfsburg will want a good result to prepare for Tuesday's crunch Champions League clash at home to Manchester United when Germany captain Bastian Schweinsteiger plays his first game on home soil since leaving Bayern Munich.

115,02/12/2015,12:57,Buoyant Gladbach out to topple runaway Bayern,In-form Borussia Moenchengladbach are hoping to become only the second team this season to take German league points off Bayern Munich when the sides meet on Saturday.,"Pep Guardiola's Bayern are running away with the Bundesliga title after taking 40 from a maximum 42 points with 13 wins from 14 matches this season and only a goalless draw at Eintracht Frankfurt in October blots their copybook. Gladbach are unbeaten in their last nine league games under head coach Andre Schubert and worked hard to protect their record by fighting back from 3-1 down at bottom side Hoffenheim last Saturday to claim a 3-3 draw. ""We are unbeaten in nine games, our run should have caught Bayern's attention,"" said USA international Fabian Johnson, who scored twice against Hoffenheim. Gladbach's stars are relishing the prospect of testing themselves against Germany's top team at Borussia Park with their side fourth in the table while Bayern are already eight points clear with less then half of the season gone. ""Bayern are obviously a big team, but so are Juventus and Manchester City and they are teams we could have beaten in the Champions League,"" said Gladbach's captain Granit Xhaka. ""If we play better at the back than we did in Hoffenheim, then we definitely have a chance."" A factor which may count against Gladbach is that when Bayern feel under pressure, as they have done at home to Dortmund, Wolfsburg and Arsenal this season, on each occasion they handed out a 5-1 pounding. ""Never give up -- that is our mentality. When the game starts, it will be 0-0 against Bayern and we have become a force,"" said Gladbach striker Josip Drmic. Schubert says his side has nothing to fear from taking on all-conquering Bayern, who have lost just once this season when Arsenal beat them 2-0 in London in the Champions League. ""Of course, we will try and find the right solutions against Bayern,"" said Gladbach's head coach. ""We have the necessary fitness, the huge desire and the heart. It will be exciting to see if we can surprise them."""
116,28/11/2015,17:54,Bayern extend Hertha's 38-year wait,Bayern Munich went 11 points clear at the top of the Bundesliga on Saturday with a 2-0 win at home to Hertha Berlin who have now gone 38 years without a win at the German giants.,"With second-placed Borussia Dortmund hosting VfB Stuttgart on Sunday, Bayern took the chance to extend their lead with first-half goals by Germany forward Thomas Mueller and France Under-21 winger Kingsley Coman. Bayern show no signs of loosening their iron-grip on the Bundesliga title as they picked up their 13th win from 14 league games to give them 40 from a possible 42 points. This was the first time in eight home games that Bayern failed to score at least four goals. Bayern coach Pep Guardiola experimented with the starting line-up by pushing Germany centre-back Jerome Boateng into a midfield role, which led to their second goal. They took the lead at Munich's Allianz Arena when Chile midfielder Arturo Vidal's cross found Medhi Benatia, whose shot was heading wide, but Mueller was on hand to head home on 34 minutes. Bayern doubled their lead on 41 minutes when Boateng lobbed the ball into Javi Martinez, whose pass found Coman and the French winger did the rest to make it 2-0 at the break. Hertha, who last won in Munich in 1977, are in fifth place after Borussia Moechengladbach leap-frogged them into fourth with a 3-3 draw at Hoffenheim. Gladbach's head coach Andre Schubert preserved his nine-game unbeaten record in the lead since taking charge two months ago. Borussia took an early lead thanks to USA international Fabian Johnson, who then scored their equaliser to rescue a point. Hoffenheim, chasing their first win since September, took a 3-1 lead just after the break thanks to goals by Steven Zuber, Eugen Polanski and Nadiem Amiri. But Swiss striker Josip Drmic pulled it back to 3-2 for Gladbach before Johnson claimed his second with a superb shot three minutes from time. Hamburg are up to sixth after their 3-1 win at Werder Bremen in the north German derby. Hamburg raced into an early 2-0 lead as Croatia midfielder Ivo Ilicevic scored on their opening attack, then striker Michael Gregoritsch doubled their lead on 26 minutes. Nigeria's Anthony Ujah pulled a goal back for Werder on 62 minutes, then Germany forward Nicolai Mueller made it 3-1 to Hamburg on 68 minutes when Ilicevic's final pass put him in behind the hosts' defence. Hanover eased the pressure on coach Michael Frontzeck with a 4-0 thumping at home to Ingolstadt which lifted them up to 14th and pulled them away from the relegation zone. Japan striker Yoshinori Muto scored his seventh goal of the season in Mainz's 2-1 win at Eintracht Frankfurt. His forward partner Yunus Malli added their second to claim his eighth while Frankfurt had captain Alex Meier sent off for a second yellow card."
117,25/11/2015,22:49,Gladbach run riot to end Sevilla hopes,Borussia Moenchengladbach enjoyed an historic first Champions League win on Wednesday as their 4-2 home victory over Sevilla ended the Spaniards' hopes of reaching the knock-out phase.,"A brace by Lars Stindl, plus goals from Fabian Johnson and Raffael capped Gladbach's win which lifted them off the bottom of Group D in an impressive display. Manchester City and Juventus have wrapped up the last-16 qualifying spots from the group. Bottom side Sevilla had needed a win at Borussia Park to keep alive their faint hopes of reaching the last 16 but left only with two late consolation goals from Vitolo and an Ever Banega penalty. Borussia, who are in the Champions League for the first time, enjoyed their first home win in Europe since 1978 in the now defunct European Cup. Stindl, in the attacking midfielder role, was outstanding all evening with two goals and an assist for Raffael's final goal. Gladbach are now in pole position to finish third in the group and qualify for the Europa League, but need at least a point in their final game at Manchester City in two weeks. The victory came at a price as Guinea winger Ibrahima Traore limped off after only 13 minutes with a suspected hamstring injury from taking a corner. Gladbach broke the deadlock on 29 minutes when captain Granit Xhaka fired in a low shot, which skidded wide, and Stindl tapped it past stranded Sevilla goalkeeper Sergio Rico. The hosts doubled the lead when USA international Johnson curled his shot across the face of the goal, around Rico and into the far corner on 68 minutes. Raffael then added the third when Stindl drew two defenders and slipped the ball through the backline to the Brazilian, who was clinical in his finishing on 78 minutes. Sevilla enjoyed a brief moment of hope on 82 minutes when Fernando Llorente flicked a pass over the defence and right winger Vitolo lobbed Gladbach goalkeeper Yann Sommer. Gladbach extended their lead within a minute when Stindl blasted in his shot from 20 metres out with a superb strike for his third European goal. Gladbach captain Xhaka gave away a late penalty when he fouled Grzegorz Krychowiak on the edge of the area and Banega blasted home the spot kick."
118,24/11/2015,01:37,Sevilla chase Gladbach win to keep hopes alive,Sevilla need a victory at winless Borussia Moenchengladbach on Wednesday to keep alive their faint hopes of progress to the Champions League's knockout stage in the Group D basement battle.,"A win at bottom side Gladbach is the only way third-placed Sevilla will still have any hope of reaching the last 16, when they host Juventus on December 8. Victory at Borussia Park would guarantee them at least a place in the Europa League, which they have won for the last two years running. With Gladbach's Champions League exit already confirmed, defeat would confirm the Germans will finish bottom of the group, but they want to knock Sevilla from third to advance to the Europa League. ""We need to be courageous and play our own game, like we did against Juventus,"" said Gladbach's Guinea winger Ibrahima Traore. ""Our confidence is high, we are in good shape and our goal is third place to qualify for the Europa League."" Gladbach are buoyed by their German league form which has seen them climb from bottom to fourth with seven wins and a draw in their eight Bundesliga games since Andre Schubert took charge in September. ""We have to go to our absolute limit and give it everything we have,"" said Schubert, whose side sealed a 2-1 win over Hanover on Saturday in his first game as head coach, with a contract until 2017, after two months as caretaker boss. ""We aren't under any pressure, but we do have a duty to give it our all."" Having drawn 1-1 last time out at home to Juventus, Gladbach want another strong performance. Schubert has breathed life back into Gladbach with a consistent team selection policy, bringing in talented teenagers Andreas Christensen and Mahmoud Dahoud and tightening the defence. He has also given Swiss defensive midfielder Graint Xhaka the captaincy and the 23-year-old, who has been linked to a big-money move to Liverpool, has revelled in the role. The Foals are nine unbeaten since losing at home to Manchester City at the start of September and had few problems beating mid-table Hanover on Saturday with goals by Traore and Brazilian striker Raffael. Sevilla are 11th in the Spanish league. They inflicted a first defeat of the season on La Liga giants Real Madrid with a 3-2 home win three weeks ago when ex-Borussia Dortmund striker Ciro Immobile scored his maiden goal for the club. But on Saturday, they crashed 2-0 at Real Sociedad, who were playing their first match since David Moyes was sacked after a run of six defeats in nine games. Portugal goalkeeper Beto (knee injury), Gaeel Kakuta (thigh) and defender Daniel Carriço (hamstring) will all miss the game with injury."
119,21/11/2015,20:10,Traore moves family from Paris after terror attacks,Guinea midfielder Ibrahima Traore has temporarily moved his family to Germany from Paris in the wake of the recent terror attacks.,"The France-born Borussia Moenchengldbach winger scored in his side's 2-1 home win over Hanover 96 on Saturday, which moved them up to fifth in the table, then revealed the strain his family has been under. ""It has been hard. After what happened in my city (Paris), I just wanted to play football and forget about the day,"" the 27-year-old told German Sky. ""My brother went through some really bad days and my mother no longer felt safe there anymore. ""When they are here, I don't have to worry anymore. I can switch off and just concentrate on my football. I just wanted to forget."" Traore, who grew up in France, explained why he moved his close family members -- his mother Maniera and brother Hamidou -- from Paris to Moenchengladbach. ""Paris is my city, I grew up there -- only 10 minutes from where the attacks took place,"" he told German daily Bild. ""I often visited the place and my family were still living there. He (his brother) was out and about that night, only four streets from where the attacks took place. ""He wasn't allowed to go home afterwards and had to spent the night at a friend's place. ""That is why they have come to be with me. My house is big enough and they will stay here until the situation in Paris has calmed down."" There was a minute's silence at all Bundesliga grounds this weekend and the players, including Troare, wore black armbands to pay respect to the 130 victims who died."
120,21/11/2015,17:53,Wolfsburg warm-up for Moscow by hammering Bremen,Germany striker Max Kruse netted twice in Wolfsburg's 6-0 rout of Werder Bremen in the German league on Saturday to warm-up for Wednesday's key Champions League clash in Moscow.,"In Europe, Wolfsburg are third in Group B, but just a point behind leaders Manchester United ahead of their penultimate group game at bottom side CSKA Moscow in the Russian capital on Wednesday. The Germans still have every chance of qualifying for the knock-out stages and consolidated third in the German league table by hammering Bremen. There was a minute's silence at all Bundesliga grounds this weekend -- the players also wore black armbands -- out of respect for the victims of the Paris terror attacks. Stuttgart's 4-0 thumping at home to Augsburg was delayed by 15 minutes due to the tightened security checks at stadiums across the country. There were no such problems at Wolfsburg's Volkswagen Arena as Bremen gifted their hosts the opener when defender Alejandro Galvez slid the ball into his own net on 11 minutes. Kruse put Wolfsburg 2-0 up at the break by heading home a free-kick then Portugal international Vierinha scored from the right wing on 56 minutes. The floodgates opened when French defensive midfielder, on for the injured Brazil star Luiz Gustavo, stabbed home his shot on 67 minutes. Kruse then set up Netherlands striker Bas Dost on 78 minutes before completing the scoring three minutes from time by converting a cross from Germany team-mate Andre Schuerrle to leave him with five league goals for the season. The result leaves Wolfsburg five points behind second-placed Borussia Dortmund who lost 3-1 at Hamburg on Friday night, while leaders Bayern Munich play at Schalke on Saturday evening. Ex-Manchester United star Javier Hernandez now has 12 goals for Bayer Leverkusen in all competitions after scoring twice in their 3-1 win at Eintracht Frankfurt. Christmas came early for 'Chicharito' in Frankfurt when Eintracht centre-back David Abraham allowed a cross to roll between his legs and the grateful Hernandez stabbed home on 11 minutes. The Mexico striker doubled his tally on 39 minutes when a Hakan Calhanoglu pass split the Frankfurt defence. Hernandez did the rest, but it finished 2-1 at the break when Serbian midfielder Slobodan Medojevic slammed in a powerful header on the stroke of half-time. Calhanoglu made sure of the three points by scoring Leverkusen's third on 72 minutes. Augsburg climbed off the bottom of the table with an emphatic 4-0 win at VfB Stuttgart. Woeful defending by the hosts allowed Augsburg to race into an early 2-0 lead with both goals by midfielder Alexander Esswein. Defender Jan-Ingwer Callsen-Bracker grabbed a third before former South Korea captain Koo Ja-Cheol scored Augsburg's fourth when he hit the top right-hand corner from 10 metres out on 54 minutes. The Rhine derby finished goalless as Mainz drew at Cologne as the hosts abandoned plans to play in a special-edition carnival-themed shirt out of respect for those who died in Paris."
121,03/11/2015,23:10,Lichtsteiner nets on return as Juve draw at Gladbach,Ten-man Juventus took a step towards the Champions League's knock-out phase with a 1-1 draw at Borussia Moenchengladbach on Tuesday as Stephan Lichtsteiner scored on his return from heart surgery.,"The Swiss defender netted just before the half-time break to cancel out Fabian Johnson's 18th-minute opener for the visitors. It was Lichtsteiner's first match since the 31-year-old wing-back had an operation to fix an irregular heartbeat after coming off during a match in September with breathing difficulties. Juventus played the last 35 minutes with ten men after their Brazilian midfielder Hernanes was sent off for a late tackle on Gladbach's Alvaro Dominguez, just as the visitors were starting to take control of the game. Despite the point, Juventus remain unbeaten in Europe, but dropped to second in Group D with Manchester City going top by virtue of their 3-1 away win at Sevilla, in so doing qualifying for the last 16. Gladbach remain bottom of the group with just two points from four games and probably need to beat Sevilla in their next home Champions League match later this month just to qualify for the Europa League's knock-out phase as third in the group. ""We're all very disappointed, we controlled the game and had the better chances,"" Gladbach's Guinea international Ibrahima Traore told Sky. ""Unfortunately all that was missing at the end was a goal."" After their teenage defensive midfielder Mahmoud Dahoud hit the crossbar with a curling long-range shot, the hosts took a deserved lead at Borussia Park. Juve's Giorgio Chiellini failed to clear a low cross into the box, Brazilian striker Raffael collected the loose ball and played in US international Johnson, who slotted his shot past the Italian goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon. Having been named in the starting line-up, Lichtsteiner showed he is back to his best when Paul Pogba lifted a superb pass over the Gladbach defence and the Swiss smashed the ball past his national team-mate Yann Sommer on the volley on 44 minutes. It was 1-1 at the break but the game's tempo changed when Dutch referee Bjorn Kuipers showed Hernanes a straight red card on 55 minutes, although replays showed both he and Dominguez went fully committed into a challenge for the loose ball. However, the few clear chances Gladbach carved out were expertly saved by the impressive Buffon. With time almost up, Juventus's veteran goalkeeper kept his side in the game when the 37-year-old palmed Thorgan Hazard's shot over the bar with a reflex save. Gladbach's caretaker coach Andre Schubert has yet to secure a contract despite winning six straight Bundesliga games. His record in Europe is now two draws and a defeat after his side earned a point in the away match in Turin a fortnight ago and lost at home to Manchester City."
122,02/11/2015,18:35,"I'm no Harry Potter, says Gladbach's Schubert",Borussia Moechengladbach's caretaker coach Andre Schubert says there is no magic secret to his side's remarkable revival as he laughed off a comparison to the fictional wand-waving character Harry Potter.,"Gladbach host Juventus on Tuesday in the Champions League needing a win to keep alive their faint hopes of reaching the knock-out phase after two defeats, plus a draw at Juventus a fortnight ago. Schubert took charge of Gladbach at the end of September when Lucien Favre walked out with the team bottom of the Bundesliga after five straight league defeats. He has hauled them up to fifth with a Bundesliga record-equalling six consecutive victories, which led to an Italian journalist asking if he is the 'Harry Potter of Moenchengladbach' in a reference to the central character of the JK Rowling novels. ""I have no magic wand, but fortunately I do have a few wizards out on the pitch,"" quipped Schubert. ""We'll try and present the opponents with a challenge and, of course, we want to win. ""Juve are a strong side, but we have an idea how to face them and we'll see if it is a good idea."" Gladbach are bottom of Group D with just a point after defeats away to Sevilla, home to Manchester City and a goalless draw in Turin a fortnight ago, while Juve are top. But the draw away to the 2015 Champions League finalists has instilled further confidence in a Gladbach team buoyed by their recent victories. ""In Turin, we played very well defensively, but we didn't attack as well as we do in the Bundesliga,"" said Gladbach midfielder Ibrahima Traore. ""Maybe we were lacking a bit of courage, but we want to do things differently at home (against Juventus),"" said the Guinea international. ""We need a win to keep alive our hopes of progressing, that's why I believe that we will play differently, with more courage. ""From day one, the new coach has given us a lot of confidence, which we were lacking after five straight league defeats. ""The most important thing, however, was regaining the confidence -- he told us that we were very good footballers and capable of winning against any team."" Despite turning Gladbach's fortunes around after just 40 days in charge, Schubert has yet to be offered a full-time contract and is waiting for Borussia to make a decision on his future. Juventus coach Massimiliano Allegri said he is impressed by what Schubert has achieved, but said his side can ill afford to show Gladbach too much respect. ""Gladbach are currently on a good run, they have six straight wins in the league. We have not managed two wins in a row this season,"" he said. ""There are always changes to a team, whether it is the personnel or tactics. ""It is not so much a question of tactics, but of attitude on the pitch. We have made changes too, but not so many of them. ""The Champions league is the highest level there is in football. ""In the league, you always have the possibility to correct a bad patch, but in the Champions League, every game is like a final, lose and you are out quickly."""

Schubert's six wins on his first stint in the Bundesliga equals the record Willi Entenmann achieved with VfB Stuttgart in 1986. To give that context, Bayern Munich's coach Pep Guardiola won only his opening three games in his first Bundesliga season in 2013/14. But Borussia are bottom of Group D in Europe after losing their opening two games: 3-0 at Sevilla and 2-1 at home to Manchester City before drawing at Juventus a fortnight ago. Gladbach's 4-1 Bundesliga win at Hertha Berlin on Saturday was a timely booster after holding Juventus to a goalless draw in Turin. Gladbach need to beat Juventus to keep alive their faint hopes of reaching the knock-out stages. Since Schubert took charge, after Lucien Favre's shock resignation in September, Gladbach have only lost once -- when Manchester City secured a 2-1 comeback win at Borussia Park in the Champions League. Gladbach have never lost to Serie A opposition in six games at this level, but this is their first year they are playing in Europe since the 1977/78 season. Unbeaten in Europe, Juventus will secure qualification for the last 16 if they beat Gladbach and Sevilla lose at Manchester City on Tuesday. Juve will be without Germany midfielder Sami Khedira who tore his calf early in Saturday's 2-1 win at Torino and came off after ten minutes. ""He told me he had a problem, but I risked him and used him in the game,"" said Juventus coach Massimiliano Allegri. Juventus have had a disappointing start to the season and are tenth in the Italian league, but top Group D after wins over City and Sevilla before drawing with Gladbach. The Germans are relishing taking on last season's finalists again and right-back Havard Nordveit, who scored their fourth goal in Berlin, says there will be a special atmosphere.

Schubert has now hauled Gladbach up to fourth and his six wins on his first stint in the Bundesliga equals the record Willi Entenmann achieved with VfB Stuttgart in 1986. To give Schubert's remarkable run context, Bayern Munich's coach Pep Guardiola won only his opening three games in his first Bundesliga season in 2013/14. ""We're all just caretaker coaches -- I don't even have a contract,"" said Schubert of his backroom staff. Gladbach host last seasons finalists Juventus in the Champions League on Tuesday.

Swiss international Granit Xhaka said the team want Schubert, who was promoted from Gladbach's youth team coach, to keep the job. ""When you win so much and pick up so many points, then that is also down to the coaches,"" said Xhaka. ""We would like to keep him. ""We can only put in our performances on the pitch, the board has to decide everything else."" In his nine games and 40 days in charge, Schubert has lost just once, 2-1 at home to Manchester City in the Champions League. They have won seven matches, including knocking Schalke out of the German Cup and earned a Champions League point with a goalless draw at Juventus. Schubert is the coach of Germany's Under-15 team and had only previously worked in the second division at Paderborn and St Pauli at senior level. But his Gladbach side is playing with confidence as they blitzed Hertha with two goals in as many first-half minutes at Berlin's Olympic Stadium. Left-back Oscar Wendt put them ahead, then a solo effort from Brazil striker Raffael made it 2-0 after 28 minutes. Gladbach grabbed a third when Xhaka drilled home a penalty on 55 minutes after Ivory Coast winger Ibrahima Traore was fouled in the area.

126,22/10/2015,02:15,Allegri slams 'selfish' Juventus players,Juventus coach Massimiliano Allegri slammed the selfish players whose misses heaped unwelcome pressure on the Italian champions following a scoreless draw with Champions League rivals Borussia Monchengladbach on Wednesday.,"After beating Manchester City (2-1) away and dominating Sevilla in a 2-0 win last time out, Juve, last season's beaten finalists, were fully expected to claim their third consecutive win to keep City at arm's length. But a determined performance from the revived Bundesliga side, City's last-gasp 2-1 win over Sevilla at the Etihad Stadium and a string of misses in Turin means Juve's lead on Manuel Pellegrini's side at the top of Group D has been cut to just one point. After frustrating the Bianconeri in Turin, Andre Schubert's side will fancy causing an upset when the Italian champions visit in their next Champions League outing next month. Certain to be given a tough game by City in Turin in their penultimate game before Juventus then travel to Sevilla, it is a prospect Allegri appears to have already considered when he emerged angry and pointing the finger at unnamed players after Wednesday's fixture. ""We had three situations in which we had players that were better placed in goalscoring positions,"" said Allegri, who in an earlier interview with Mediaset claimed some players ""made the wrong choices because they were selfish"". He added: ""Maybe they didn't see they were there, but these are things we have to improve on. We had to deal with a lot of counter attacks, and then if you make a bundle of errors, winning becomes difficult. ""We're making too many mistakes in the final 30 metres of the pitch and not scoring enough."" It is the second successive game Juve have failed to find the net, following a scoreless draw in the 'Derby d'Italia' away to Inter Milan at the San Siro on Sunday. It was not for a lack of trying, but the Italian champions struggled to find a way past Gladbach goalkeeper Yann Sommer to clinch the win that would have given them an element of comfort ahead of their remaining three group games. Allegri had used some of his pre-match conference on Tuesday to call on misfiring midfielder Paul Pogba to lift his flagging game, and the Frenchman responded positively. Pogba produced a number of chances, mostly from distance, in either half but failed to break down a stubborn visitors' backline. Allegri did not name names and despite the 22-year-old saying he had taken his coach's advice on board, Pogba insisted he would not change the fundamentals of his game, telling Premium Sport: ""I always listen to what Allegri says and I always give 100 percent on the pitch. ""I should always do what he says, but I also have to play football the way I know how. I have to be patient and maybe the goals will come."" Juve's Spanish striker Alvaro Morata had been bidding for his sixth consecutive goal in a Champions League game, having pulled level with the club record of Alessandro Del Piero last time out. But the Spaniard was frustrated throughout and replaced in the latter stages by Paulo Dybala. Juve had late penalty claims waved away when Mario Mandzukic fell as he tried to run past Dominguez and on to Sami Khedira's through ball. Allegri's frustration grew and minutes later Mandzukic was replaced by Simone Zaza, while Morata later made way for Paulo Dybala. Their arrivals injected some pace and vibrancy into Juve's attack, but were not sufficient to stop Gladbach from claiming a first point that could prove useful in the event they end up battling for a third place finish for which the reward is a place in the Europa League. ""This time last season we had three points,"" added the Juve boss. ""It's wide open. We have to keep going like this in terms of our defence but start scoring goals."" Schubert said: ""It's great to be coach of this side and I'm proud of the fact we snatched our first point from Juventus. ""I don't know how our next games will go but what is important is how we play, not where we finish in the group."""
127,20/10/2015,20:59,Allegri calls out misfiring Pogba on eve of Gladbach clash,Juventus coach Massimiliano Allegri has called on under-fire Paul Pogba to defy his critics when the Italian champios host Borussia Monchengladbach looking to edge closer to the Champions League last-16 on Wednesday.,"France midfielder Pogba is routinely touted as one of the most sought-after players in the world, but the Juventus midfield star has failed to live up to expectations so far this season. His case has not been helped by the summer departures of former midfield companions Andrea Pirlo and Arturo Vidal, and the arrival of Sami Khedira among other new recruits to Juve's new-look side. Pogba was virtually invisible during the first half of Sunday's 'Derby d'Italia' away to Inter Milan, re-emerging into focus during an improved second half before the match finished scoreless. A win at home to Gladbach would make it three out of three for Allegri's men in Turin on Wednesday, following victories away to Manchester City (2-1) and at home to Sevilla (2-0). But Pogba, unlike Germany star Sami Khedira, is keeping Allegri occupied. ""During the first half (last weekend) Pogba didn't play well, then he did. He's going through a period in which he needs to find himself again and start doing the things he knows how to,"" Allegri told reporters. ""He needs to give a lot, and I expect it. Pogba has a lot of room for improvement and has to start asking questions of himself."" Juventus start as favourites despite Andre Schubert's side recently overturning their poor start to the campaign with a run of five league wins, including a 5-1 thrashing of Eintracht Frankfurt last weekend. Similarly, Juve's Champions League form has been at odds with their Serie A results. An underwhelming start has left the champions just four points above the relegation zone and nine points behind leaders Fiorentina after eight games. But in true Jekyll and Hide style, Juve -- last season's beaten finalists -- appear to transform when the challenge of Europe's premier club competition looms. They are among only six teams with maximum points from their first two games and on Sunday, at a sold-out San Siro, played with a swagger on their way to earning a deserved point. Part of Juve's revival is down to Khedira, the Germany international who has only recently returned to the fray following a more than two-month injury absence. While Pogba is giving Allegri food for thought, Khedira is making him purr. ""He's among the best in Europe. On Sunday, along with (Andrea) Barzagli, he had an amazing game,"" said Allegri. ""He makes few mistakes and is always in the right place at the right time. And he's not reched full fitness yet."" Khedira accepted the plaudits gracefully, saying: ""I feel right at home here."" Allegri has left doubts over who will start up front, hinting that Mario Mandzukic or even Simone Zaza could partner Alvaro Morata, who has scored in Juve's five past Champions League outings, in place of Paulo Dybala. ""Zaza is doing really well and he showed that on Sunday, whereas Dybala has to be left in peace to come into his own, just as we did with Morata last year."" Schubert earlier promised his ""aggressive"" side would be pressing Juve hard for the win and Allegri expects a harder challenge than last time out when Sevilla failed to spark in Turin. ""It will be decisive if we win, but it will be different to what we faced against Sevilla,"" added Allegri. ""They're coming here with good form, they've won the last five Bundeliga games. Given that it's decisive if one of us wins, we have to play this as a totally one-off game."""
128,20/10/2015,19:27,Bullish 'Gladbach primed for Juve,Borussia Monchengladbach will use their new-found confidence to press Juventus in aggressive fashion in a bid to stun the Serie A giants in their Champions League clash in Turin on Wednesday.,"Andre Schubert's side travel to Italy buoyed by a string of positive results that have restored confidence and pride following a dismal start to the Bundesliga season. Juventus, last season's beaten finalists, will take a significant step towards the last 16 if they claim their third successive win after beating Manchester City and Sevilla. But Schubert expects his side to play their game with a swagger,keep the pressure on Juventus throughout and create their own chances to claim their first win in Group D. ""We've been really focusing on details lately and we've been playing a bit more aggressively. We like to pressure high up the pitch and win the ball back quickly,"" Schubert said in Turin on Tuesday. ""These are the fundamentals of football and we're looking to exploit that game by game. Our situation has changed dramatically from the start (of the season). ""Tomorrow we'll what it brings."" Much like Juve's poor start to the Serie A campaign, Gladbach have also endured a Jekyll and Hyde season so far. The Germans suffered five straight league defeats and lost 3-0 to Sevilla in Europe, leaving them bottom of Germany's top flight and prompting coach Lucien Favre's shock resignation in mid-September after four successful years at the helm. Schubert was installed only as caretaker coach, but the change was immediate. The Foals went on to win four league games on the trot and although a 2-1 defeat to City has left them bottom of the group, defender Oscar Wendt said their 5-1 away thrashing of Eintracht Frankfurt on Saturday has removed any fear of Juventus. ""We've got respect for Juventus but we don't fear them. We'll give everything we've got to win tomorrow,"" said Wendt. ""Juve are favourites for tomorrow but we gave a good account of ourselves in our last Bundesliga game."" Juventus will take a major step towards the last 16 with a win on Wednesday, while defeat for Gladbach would virtually torpedo their hopes. Schubert will be without fleet-footed winger Patrick Herrmann (knee) while Swiss defensive midfielder Granit Xhaka is doubtful with an ankle knock. Asked if those absences were a problem, he said: ""I don't see it like that. The lads that are here have done well. The fact we have some (players) missing won't be decisive. Schubert said it's up to the players he does have available to go out and show they deserve to sit among such prestigious company. ""The important thing will be to win tomorrow. City are the favourites in the Premier League, Juve played in the final and Sevilla are the Europa League champions,"" he said. ""But we're not afraid. We have to play with courage, we have to play as we have been doing lately by playing high up the pitch and creating our own chances. ""We'll play our game, we won't be sitting back defending."""
129,03/10/2015,17:59,Gladbach return to winning ways as Hertha go fourth,Borussia Moenchengladbach bounced back from their midweek Champions League defeat against Manchester City with two second half goals to sink Wolfsburg 2-0 in Bundesliga action on Saturday.,"While the big guns in Germany's top flight are not in action til Sunday, the pick of the ties was at Borussia-Park, where Norwegian Haavard Nordtvelt and French-born Guinean winger Ibrahima Traore did the damage against a Wolfsburg side who drop to seventh place. The win lifts Moenchengladbach four points above the relegation zone as they win their third straight league match under caretaker coach Andre Schubert. At the Olympic stadium in the capital, Hertha Berlin began brightly against Hamburg where Ivorian striker Salomon Kalou struck his third goal of the season to put the hosts 1-0 up after 17 minutes. The 30-year-old, former Chelsea and Lille marksman has been a key addition since joining Pal Dardai's side in 2014 and helped the club avoid relegation in his first season. Bosnian international Vedad Ibisevic guaranteed maximum points for Hertha when he scored twice in two second-half minutes to make it 3-0 with 11 minutes remaining as the 1999-2000 Champions League qualifiers climbed to fourth spot. Hoffenheim were the only other team to score in the opening 45 minutes of Bundesliga action as they rode a 33rd minute penalty into the break, against Stuttgart, thanks to German international winger Kevin Volland. Second-from-bottom Stuttgart, at the start of the day, got back on level terms with 26 minutes to play thanks to 22-year-old Czech Republic striker Jan Kliment before Volland grabbed his second of the match to put the hosts into a 2-1 lead. However with time running out, Stuttgart snatched a valuable point when Pirmin Schwegler scored in the 90th minute in a match that finished 2-2 but nonetheless left the visitors bottom of the league on goal-difference. Hannover won their first match of the season as they defeated Werder Bremen 1-0 thanks to the only goal of the match on 56 minutes through French-born Senegalese international Salif Sane. Finally, Ingolstadt defeated Eintrach Frankfurt 2-0 with late goals from Pascal Gross and Stefan Lex to take possession of fifth spot in their first season back in the Bundesliga. The match of the weekend, takes place at the Allianz Arena on Sunday, when three-time defending champions Bayern Munich put their four point lead at the top, on the line against Borussia Dortmund, in a battle of unbeaten sides. Third-placed Schalke 04, who come into the weekend with five wins from seven outings, host mid-table Cologne while Bayer Leverkusen await relegation-threatened Augsburg. On Friday, Mainz evened their record at four wins and four defeats in a thrilling 3-2 victory at promoted Darmstadt. Mainz are now sixth and in touch of the European places while Darmstadt suffer only their second defeat of the eight-game season and lie 10th."
130,29/09/2015,13:07,Gladbach confirm interest in Augsburg's Weinzierl,"Borussia Moenchengladbach sports director Max Eberl has confirmed approaching Markus Weinzierl, coach of their Bundesliga rivals Augsburg, following Lucien Favre's shock resignation.","Gladbach host Manchester City in the Champions League on Wednesday. They have won their last two games under caretaker coach Andre Schubert after Favre resigned ten days ago in the wake of five straight league defeats which left Borussia bottom of the Bundesliga. Weinzierl, 40, has forged a good reputation in Germany having steered Bavarian side Augsburg to finish fifth last season -- the best placing in the club's history -- to qualify for this season's Europa League. ""In football everything is possible and we have been thinking in all directions,"" Eberl, 42, said on Monday at a sponsors event when asked about Markus Weinzierl. ""I am pleased with the way things have gone for him, he has not only been consistent, but also successful."" Weinzierl has a contract at Augsburg until 2019, but Eberl says he is not deterred. On Sunday, Augsburg president Klaus Hofmann said they had already been approached about their coach. ""I can't forbid Gladbach to talk to Markus Weinzierl,"" Hofmann told Sky. ""We already had a discussion in May and June with Schalke, but he decided to stay with Augsburg despite a huge offer. ""I believe the situation will stay that way until 2019."" Eberl and Weinzierl used to play against each other as youth team players in Bavaria. ""He was a much better footballer than me,"" said Eberl. ""But in football, you can always meet again."""
131,29/09/2015,01:47,Resurgent Gladbach out to claim City scalp,Borussia Moenchengladbach are out to prove back-to-back victories under caretaker coach Andre Schubert are no fluke as they host Manchester City on Wednesday looking to create a Champions League upset.,"Both Gladbach and City are hunting their first points in Europe after the Germans lost 3-0 at Sevilla last time out in Group D while Manuel Pellegrini's 'Citizens' crashed 2-1 a fortnight ago at home to last season's finalists Juventus. Gladbach started the season in freefall with five straight Bundesliga defeats, plus the loss against Sevilla, which saw Lucien Favre resign as coach, despite steering them to third in the Bundesliga and Champions League qualification. Schubert has come in and made an immediate impact as head coach with Gladbach romping to a 4-2 win against Augsburg last Wednesday, before claiming a 3-1 victory at Stuttgart on Sunday. In sharp contrast, City hit the ground running, winning their first five league games and scoring 11 goals without conceding, but have lost three of their four matches in all competitions since their Juventus defeat. The pressure is now on Pellegrini's side to get their European campaign back on track in Germany as they lie second in the Premier League table, one point behind neighbours Manchester United, after crashing 4-1 at Tottenham Hotspur on Saturday. ""It's a must-win game,"" said City's Argentina defender Nicolas Otamendi. ""When you look at the quality and standard of players at this club it's almost demanded of us to be competing in Europe at the highest level. ""We're under no illusions that the only option we've got is to go out and get three points."" City have significant injury concerns as captain Vincent Kompany has missed the last three matches with a calf problem, goalkeeper Joe Hart sat out the Spurs defeat with a back problem and midfielder Yaya Toure was forced off with a hamstring injury and is doubtful. In contrast, Gladbach have few injury worries and want to add to City's poor record away to Bundesliga sides after just two wins in Germany against six defeats. This will be Gladbach's first home game at this level for 37 years, having reached the final of the old European Cup in 1977, beaten by Liverpool, and this is the first time Champions League football has been played at Borussia Park. Having pulled Gladbach up from the bottom of the Bundesliga to 14th with two wins, club bosses are delighted with Schubert and claiming City's famous scalp would enhance his chances of getting the head coach job permanently. Having been hastily promoted from Gladbach's under-23 team after Favre quit, Schubert was happy to reveal he already has experience of playing a City side -- albeit their youth team. ""We're looking forward to the match, it will be a great challenge,"" said Schubert, whose coaching CV includes second division sides St Pauli and Paderborn. ""We want to try and get something on Wednesday and I am unbeaten against Manchester City,"" he added with a smile. ""We drew 1-1 against their youth side with our U23s in the Premier League International Cup most recently. ""I have taken over the team in the middle of a season and am dependent on the coaching staff and my colleagues. ""You can only be successful in football if everyone pulls together. I am enjoying it a lot at the moment. ""We have picked ourselves up and kept playing our football. The boys have done excellently so far."""
132,22/09/2015,15:26,Gladbach hunt to replace Favre with 'perfect' coach,Borussia Moenchengladbach admit the hunt to find a 'perfect' new coach could take weeks amidst the chaos caused by Lucien Favre's shock resignation and next week's visit of Manchester City.,"Favre dropped a bombshell on Gladbach on Sunday by resigning as head coach, 24 hours after the club's 1-0 defeat at Cologne left them bottom of the Bundesliga without a point from their first five games. They host Augsburg in the Bundesliga on Wednesday and Andre Schubert has been promoted from Gladbach's reserve team as caretaker, but the ex-Paderborn and St Pauli coach could get the job permanently if successful in the coming games. The departure of Favre, who spent four years in charge and achieved Champions League qualification last season, has shocked Gladbach, who play Stuttgart away on Sunday, then City at home next Wednesday in the Champions League. Former Borussia Dortmund coach Jurgen Klopp has already been ruled out of the running to replace Favre and Gladbach's sporting director Max Eberl admits the hunt to find a replacement could last weeks. ""It may be that it will take until the winter. This we cannot, and will not, rule out,"" said Eberl on Tuesday. ""We must try and find a perfect new coach, but we don't want a Lucien Favre clone."" Schubert is now tasked with dragging Gladbach up the league table and avoiding humiliation against City, who lost 2-1 at home to Juventus the same night Gladbach were beaten 3-0 at Sevilla on September 15. Eberl admitted Schubert could find himself in the job permanently if things go well. ""I've learnt that it's difficult to make concrete statements in football,"" added Eberl, when asked if Schubert, who also coaches Germany's Under-15 team, will definitely be replaced. Markus Weinzierl, who took charge of mid-table Augsburg in 2012 and, after Favre's departure, is now the longest-serving Bundsliga coach, expects Gladbach to come out fighting on Wednesday. ""Basically, Gladbach are a very, very good team, who have a lot of quality and lots of potential,"" said Weinzierl. ""(Andre Schubert) is a good man who has an insight into the team and brings influences from outside. ""This makes the game all the more dangerous."""
133,21/09/2015,13:21,"Klopp won't take over at Gladbach, says club","Jurgen Klopp will not take over at Borussia Moenchengladbach, both Klopp's agent and the Bundesliga club confirmed Monday, as Gladbach hunt for Lucien Favre's replacement following his shock resignation.","""Jurgen Klopp will not be the Borussia Moenchengladbach coach,"" Klopp's agent Marc Kosicke told magazine Sport Bild. After losing their opening five Bundesliga matches to go bottom of the Bundesliga, Champions League side Gladbach need a new coach after Favre abruptly resigned on Sunday in the wake of his team's 1-0 defeat at Cologne the day before. In a statement, Favre, 57, said he no longer felt like ""the perfect coach for Gladbach"" and quit after four years in charge, having steered them to third in the Bundesliga last season to earn a Champions League berth. But the Swiss' abrupt exit has left the club high and dry as Gladbach host Augsburg on Wednesday looking for their first league point of the season, then travel to play Stuttgart on Saturday. ""The players were just as surprised by the news,"" admitted Gladbach's director of sport Max Eberl in Monday's press conference, who confirmed there has been no offer made to Klopp. ""We will be looking at lots of names over the next few days."" While Gladbach hunt for Favre's replacement, Andre Schubert, 44, who also coaches the Germany Under-15 side, has been promoted from reserve team coach to take charge. ""The footprints Lucien Favre has left are very large,"" added Eberl, who said the details of Favre's exit is now a matter for the club's laywers. Favre's timing could not be worse as, following their two imminent Bundesliga matches, Gladbach host Manchester City in their second Champions League game having already lost 3-0 away to Sevilla last Wednesday. Having walked away from Dortmund at the end of last season to take a self-imposed coaching sabbatical, Klopp is weighing up his options after winning the German league titles in 2011 and 2012. The 48-year-old Klopp was at his former club Mainz on Friday to see their 3-1 win over Hoffenheim. ""I know that one day I'll talk to other clubs, if I get the right feeling then we'll get things moving,"" he said over the weekend at a car show in Frankfurt. ""It might be a club that's competing for titles, it could also be an up and coming team."" Although ex-Germany coach Berti Vogts has said Klopp would be a good fit at Gladbach, experienced coaches Jos Luhukay, Mirko Slomka, Thomas Schaaf and Horst Steffen have all been linked to the club as Favre's possible replacement."
134,20/09/2015,21:05,Favre's resignation leaves Gladbach in chaos,Lucien Favre resigned as Borussia Moenchengladbach coach on Sunday to leave the club in chaos after losing all of their opening five league games to go bottom of the Bundesliga.,"Gladbach's 1-0 defeat at Cologne on Saturday was the final straw for the 57-year-old after four years in charge. Gladbach, who won the last of their five Bundesliga titles in the 1970s, have yet to accept his resignation, but Favre is set to be the first German league coach to part company with his team this season. ""We are totally stunned,"" Gladbach's vice-president Rainer Bohnhof told SID, an AFP subsidiary. ""We have talked about this all day and rejected his offer to resign, because we were of the opinion that we could succeed together, but then he went out on his own (and announced his resignation)."" Gladbach face two league games this week at home to Augsburg on Wednesday then away to VfB Stuttgart, who are also winless, on Saturday and it is unclear who will now coach the team. The Swiss steered Gladbach to third in the Bundesliga last season to qualify for the Champions League, where they lost their opening game 3-0 at Seville last Tuesday. They have conceded 12 goals in this season's Bundesliga, scoring just twice. ""After careful consideration and thorough analysis, I have come to the conclusion... to resign from my position as head coach of Borussia Moenchengladbach,"" said Favre in a statement. ""I no longer have the feeling of being the perfect coach for the club."" Gladbach's director of sport Max Eberl has said they will try to convince Favre to stay as the team face Manchester City at Borussia Park in ten days in the Champions League, then German Cup winners Wolfsburg in the Bundesliga. ""We are still totally convinced that Lucien is the perfect coach for Borussia and we will survive together with him in this very difficult current situation,"" said Eberl in a club statement. Favre spent two years at Hertha Berlin from 2007-09 having won the Swiss league title with FC Zurich in 2006 and 2007 and was voted Germany's manager of the year in 2009."
135,14/09/2015,02:16,Winless Sevilla seek Champions League refuge,Confidence will be in short measure when Sevilla take on Borussia Moenchengladbach in their Champions League opener on Tuesday with both sides still searching for their first win of the season.,"Sevilla have taken just two points from their opening three La Liga fixtures as well as losing out to Barcelona 5-4 after extra time in a remarkable UEFA Super Cup final last month. However, the Spanish side could have a psychological edge after beating Moenchengladbach in both legs to win 4-2 on aggregate on their way to winning the Europa League last season. Another busy summer of comings and goings at the Sanchez Pizjuan has been pinpointed as one of the reasons for a slow start to the campaign by Unai Emery's men. However, the Andalusians have also been hamstrung by a series of injuries. Goalkeeper Beto became the latest player forced onto the sidelines as he suffered a sprained lateral ligament in his right knee that is expected to keep him out for up to six weeks in a 1-1 draw at Levante on Friday. Defenders Adil Rami, Nico Pareja and Daniel Carrico will all miss out through injury. Moenchengladbach's start to the Bundesliga season has been even more disastrous as they sit bottom of the table having lost all four opening games for the first time in their history. ""Our situation in the Bundesliga is unusual and uncomfortable for us, so it's hard to talk about Sevilla,"" midfielder Andre Hahn said to the Moenchengladbach website. ""I think the game could be a nice break from the league. It's also perhaps an advantage for us that we don't have too much time to dwell on the Hamburg game. ""In any case, we're going into it with a lot of excitement. We worked hard last season to earn ourselves this chance, so we're looking forward to finally getting to hear the Champions League anthem."" Swiss international Granit Xhaka is suspended for the visitors after being sent-off in the second-leg of last season's tie against Sevilla. Meanwhile, captain Martin Stranzl is out after suffering a fractured cheekbone in Friday's 3-0 home defeat to Hamburg."
136,12/09/2015,00:00,Lasogga on double as Hamburg humiliate 'Gladbach,Hamburg's Pierre-Michel Lasogga scored a double in a 3-0 win which condemned Borussia Moenchengladbach to a fourth straight Bundesliga defeat on Friday just days before their Champions League group opener at Sevilla.,"The 23-year-old Lasogga opened after 11 minutes and added his second just before the break with Nicolai Mueller getting a third on 52 minutes to give Hamburg their second win of the season to move provisionally up to seventh. Tailenders 'Gladbach, struggling without injured midfield duo Patrick Herrmann and Granit Xhaka, have gotten off to their worst ever start to the season just three months after their third-place finish. ""I said from the outset that it would be a very difficult season and the injuries haven't helped,"" said the club's Swiss coach Lucien Favre, who insisted the Bundesliga campaign was ""more important than the Champions League"". The former five-time German champions, beaten at home for the first time by Hamburg since December 2010, have already conceded 11 goals in four games -- one more than in 13 games last season. Hamburg were gifted the first goal following a sloppy clearance by 'Gladbach defender Martin Stranzl with Lasogga winning a duel with goalkeeper Yann Sommer. Lasogga doubled his account a minute before the break heading in an Ivo Ilicevic corner. And seven minutes after the break the visitors sealed victory following a long clearance by goalkeeper Jaroslav Drobny which was picked up by Mueller who lobbed over the outrushing Sommer. Borussia Dortmund, the league's early pacesetters, travel to Hanover on Saturday as Bayern Munich, second on goal difference, host FC Augsburg."

Bayern began their quest for an historic fourth successive title when they routed Hamburg 5-0 at home on Friday, but 2012 German champions Dortmund suggested Pep Guardiola's Bavarians may not have it all their own way this season by hammering Gladbach, who finished third last season. Dortmund took the lead after just 15 minutes when Germany winger Reus hammered home Shinji Kawaga's pass, while Aubameyang added their second when he headed home Marcel Schmelzer's pin-point cross six minutes later. To the delight of the home supporters in the 81,359-strong crowd, Dortmund made it 3-0 at half-time when Mkhitaryan slotted home on 33 minutes after Aubameyang had torn the Gladbach defence to pieces. The Armenia international added Dortmund's fourth and his second on 50 minutes when he drilled home Reus' final pass with Aubameyang also waiting to score. It could have been five as Kagawa, who was outstanding in the attacking midfield, hammered his shot just wide of the post soon after. Earlier, Bayer Leverkusen warmed up for their Champions League play-off clash at Lazio on Tuesday with a 2-1 comeback win against Hoffenheim. Leverkusen face Lazio away on Tuesday, with the return on August 26, for a place in the Champions League group stage and 19-year-old Julian Brandt came off the bench to score their winner at home to Hoffenheim. Newly-promoted Ingolstadt celebrated their debut in Germany's top flight with a 1-0 win at Mainz as Austria international Lukas Hinterseer scored their second-half winner. Fellow new boys Darmstadt finished their first game in the Bundesliga for 33 years with a 2-2 draw against Hanover in an action-packed match. Schalke picked up their first win under new coach Andre Breitenreiter with a 3-0 victory at Werder Bremen. The hosts conceded an unlucky first-half own goal when Czech defender Theodor Gebre Selassie beat Schalke striker Klaas-Jan Huntelaar to the ball, but his clearance looped over Werder goalkeeper Felix Wiedwald and into his own net. Cameroon striker Eric Choupo-Moting converted a pass from his international team-mate Joel Matip on 68 minutes before Huntelaar finished off a superb counter-attack on 85 minutes by 19-year-old substitute Leroy Sane, who had just come on. Meanwhile, Paraguay striker Raul Bobadilla penned a contract extension at Augsburg until 2018 only to be sent off just 45 minutes into the new Bundesliga season on Saturday in his team's 1-0 defeat at home to Hertha Berlin. Last season's runners-up Wolfsburg are at home to Eintracht Frankfurt on Sunday, while Stuttgart are at home to Cologne."

The 27-year-old wants to add to his tally of 13 caps for world champions Germany by breaking into Joachim Loew's first-choice team and says Wolfsburg's desire to establish themselves as a top European side made the difference. ""At the end of the day, it's not about how popular a club is, but what prospects it has. I want to win titles and Wolfsburg has a better outlook than Gladbach,"" Kruse told Sport Bild magazine. ""In Gladbach, no-one would say 'we have to play for the German title and get into the Champions League'. The attitude there isn't the same as mine,"" added Kruse, who cost Wolfsburg 12 million euros ($12.24m).

Lucien Favre-coached Gladbach went back up to third after Bayer Leverkusen had briefly usurped them by beating newly-crowned champions Bayern Munich 2-0 on Saturday with goals by Hakan Calhanoglu and Julian Brandt. With Leverkusen now two points behind Moenchengladbach, the sides will square off at Gladbach's Borussia Park on Saturday in a key clash with the top three in Germany qualifying directly for the Champions League. ""Now we're looking forward to playing Leverkusen, we really want to win that to achieve our goal of direct Champions League qualification,"" said Gladbach's defensive midfielder Granit Xhaka. Hamburg escaped the relegation places for the first time since March after Gojko Kacar's last-gasp goal sealed a 2-1 win at 10-man Mainz. Hamburg were gifted a first-half lead thanks to an own goal when Heiko Westermann's cross clipped Mainz's Julian Baumgartlinger and flew into the net on 37 minutes. Mainz threatened to equalise when South Korea international Joo Ja-Cheol hit the post after some good work by Japan striker Shinji Okazaki on 69 minutes just before the hosts drew level. Spanish midfielder Jairo Bustara put in a cross which Mainz midfielder Yunus Malli fired home. But Hamburg's Serbian international Kacar, who is out of contract at the end of the season, slammed home his shot from just outside the area on 87 minutes to give the visitors the three points. ""It's simply now the case that the players believe they can win, we'll celebrate now, but tomorrow we start preparing for Friday's game against Freiburg,"" said Bruno Labbadia, Hamburg's fourth coach this season. Mainz were reduced to 10 men on 90 minutes when defender Daniel Brosinski was shown a straight red card for fouling Artjoms Rudnevs who was through on goal. There was more bad news for Mainz as veteran Colombia midfielder Elkin Soto, 34, was stretchered off after dislocating his knee in a challenge with Hamburg captain Rafael van der Vaart and will miss the rest of the season. ""I am really sorry, I couldn't do anything about it, I was just going for the ball,"" said Van der Vaart. Hamburg are battling to defend a proud record as the only side in Germany's top flight never to have been relegated. The win drags them up to 14th while Mainz stay tenth. On Saturday, second-placed Wolfsburg gave up a two-goal lead to draw 2-2 at relegation threatened Hanover 96. Wolves' German Cup final opponents Borussia Dortmund also drew 1-1 at Hoffenheim with both sides chasing a Europa League spot for next season, but stay just outside the top six. Fifth place Schalke secured their first win since March with a 3-2 against VfB Stuttgart to keep them on course for next season's Europa League."

Bielefeld held their nerve to win the penalty shoot-out 5-4 as it finished 1-1 after extra-time. Arminia took the lead at their sold-out Schueco-Arena after midfielder Manuel Junglas fired home with 26 minutes gone. But Gladbach, who are third in the Bundesliga table, drew level six minutes later when striker Max Kruse converted a penalty. With the scores level after extra time, Brazilian forward Raffael got Gladbach off to a bad start, with Bielefeld already 1-0 up, when he pushed their first spot-kick around the left post. With the scores poised at 4-3 to Arminia, their midfielder Marc Lorenz had his penalty saved by Gladbach goalkeeper Yann Sommer. But Gladbach's Guinea midfielder Ibrahima Traore had his shot parried by the hosts' goalkeeper Alexander Schwolow to put Bielefeld through. After beating Hertha Berlin and Werder Bremen in the previous rounds, third-division leader Bielefeld will pick up at least two million euros ($2.1m) for reaching the semi-finals on April 28 and 29 with the final in Berlin on May 30. Holders Bayern Munich are at Bayer Leverkusen in the last quarter-final tie with the draw for the semi-finals to be made at 2300 local time (2100 GMT). On Tuesday, a thunderbolt of a shot from veteran midfielder Sebastian Kehl sealed Borussia Dortmund's 3-2 extra-time win over Hoffenheim to book their place in the last four. The 35-year-old Kehl's speculative half-volley flew perfectly off his boot and into the Hoffenheim net on 107 minutes to put Dortmund in the semi-finals for the third time in four years. Dortmund had taken an early lead but Neven Subotic's 19th-minute goal was cancelled out by Hoffenheim's Kevin Volland just 102 seconds later. Brazil international Roberto Firmino put Hoffenheim 2-1 up at half-time before Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang equalised midway through the second-half as it stayed 2-2 at the end of normal time. Wolfsburg took a step towards their first silverware since winning the 2009 Bundesliga title when a Ricardo Rodriguez penalty sealed their 1-0 quarter-final win at home to Freiburg."

The Bundesliga's top three qualify automatically for the Champions League and with seven games now left, Gladbach's win keeps them two-points clear of Leverkusen, who posted a 4-0 win over hapless Hamburg. Hosts Hoffenheim took the lead at home to Gladbach when forward Sven Schipplock enjoyed a simple tap-in after a final pass from Brazil striker Roberto Firmino with 17 minutes gone. But Gladbach proved their mettle with three goals in ten first-half minutes. First Germany striker Max Kruse drilled home a penalty, then Patrick Herrmann added a second before Brazilian striker Raffael added their third on 36 minutes to make it 3-1 at the break. Herrmann claimed his tenth goal of the season when he netted after a quick thrown on from Kruse with 51 minutes gone. ""We wanted the three points and deserved the win over the 90 minutes,"" said Gladbach coach Lucien Favre. ""We scored at just the right time to make it 4-1 and it was a good performance from us."" Fourth-placed Leverkusen also underlined their Champions League pedigree by putting Hamburg to the sword. ""We wanted to send a signal that we will fight for a Champions League place for the last seven games,"" said Leverkusen coach Roger Schmidt. With the team third from bottom and on course for a first relegation from Germany's top flight, Hamburg sacked Joe Zinnbauer ten days ago, but his successor Peter Knaebel could only watch as his team was thrashed. Midfielder Gonzalo Castro gave Leverkusen the lead at the BayArena by firing into an empty net after Germany winger Karim Bellarabi had pulled the Hamburg defence apart with only seven minutes gone. A diving header from Leverkusen striker Stefan Kiessling just before half-time gave Roger Schmidt's Bayer a 2-0 half-time lead before Kiessling added their third after a goal-mouth scramble with the Hamburg defence pulled to pieces on 56 minutes.

Freiburg find themselves three-points clear of the relegation zone after their 1-0 win at home to Cologne while Hanover dropped to just above the bottom three with a 2-2 draw at Eintracht Frankfurt. Hanover's Ivory Coast striker Didier Ya Konan rescued his team with a late equaliser, his first for the north German club since his six month sojourn at Saudi Arabian side Al Ittihad Jeddah."

""I decided not to renew my contract with Hanover and to leave for Moenchengladbach this summer,"" Stindl wrote in a letter posted on Twitter, adding that he wished ""to take on a new challenge at Borussia."" He chose Gladbach -- who won 2-0 at Bayern Munich at the weekend -- despite interest from fellow Champions League chasers Bayer Leverkusen.

Following a defeat to Manchester City in the Champions League's group stages in November and a 4-1 thrashing at Wolfsburg in the Bundesliga in January, it was only Bayern's third defeat in all competitions this season. Despite the defeat, Champions League quarter-finalists Bayern still hold a ten-point lead at the top of the table and are on course for a third straight league title. Raffael, who turns 30 next Saturday, profited from a rare mistake by Germany goalkeeper Manuel Neuer, who failed to block the Brazilian's long-range shot which rolled into the Munich goal with half an hour gone. Gladbach claimed their second on 77 minutes when Germany midfielder Christoph Kramer squared for Raffael to fire his second past Neuer. There was more bad news for Bayern coach Pep Guardiola as Dutch winger Arjen Robben was forced off in the first-half and taken to hospital -- he also missed last week's win at Werder Bremen with a trapped nerve. Earlier, second-placed Wolfsburg were held to a surprise 1-1 draw at mid-table Mainz after the hosts took a shock seventh-minute lead when defender Niko Bungert out-jumped the visiting defence to head home from a corner. Wolfsburg made their possession count as Brazil midfielder Luiz Gustavo hit the post, then scored their equaliser on 61 minutes. On Saturday, Germany winger Karim Bellarabi kept Bayer Leverkusen fourth in the table with a 1-0 win at Schalke 04. Bellarabi, who has been linked to Arsenal, grabbed the 35th-minute winner from the tightest of angles with a superb shot across goal. Schalke coach Roberto di Matteo was bitterly disappointed as the defeat left his side five points from a possible Champions League place for next season. Borussia Dortmund bounced back from their midweek Champions League exit with a 3-2 win at 10-man Hanover to earn their first victory in four games. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang netted twice as Dortmund picked up valuable league points after goalless draws against Hamburg and Cologne. The win left Borussia tenth with Hanover 14th and two points from relegation. Bremen stay ninth after being held to a 1-1 draw at mid-table Cologne as a first-half goal by Germany Under-19 striker Davie Selke for the visitors was cancelled out by an 88th-minute penalty from Cologne midfielder Matthias Lehmann. Freiburg climbed out of the bottom three with a 2-0 win at home to Augsburg thanks to second-half goals from Jonathan Schmid and Nils Petersen. Paderborn stay second-from-bottom after their goalless draw at home to ten-man Hoffenheim, who had Bosnia defender Ermin Bicakcic sent off for a second yellow card. VfB Stuttgart remain rooted to the foot of the table despite their 3-1 comeback win at home to Eintracht Frankfurt. The result means just two points separate the bottom four teams of Stuttgart, Freiburg, Paderborn and Hamburg."
150,21/03/2015,14:37,Football: Favre's Gladbach to test 'near perfect' Bayern,Borussia Moenchengladbach's Lucien Favre plans to attack the weaknesses in the 'near perfect' defence of Bundesliga leaders Bayern Munich for Sunday's clash at the Bavarians' seemingly impregnable Allianz Arena fortress.,"Bayern have won 11 of their 12 league games at home this season with just one draw, but Favre says third-placed 'Gladbach can unpick the lock on Bayern's defence, which has leaked just four goals at home this season in the Bundesliga. ""I prepare for every game for us to be able to win it, regardless of whom we're playing,"" said Gladbach coach Favre. ""Every team has their little weak spots. Perfection is impossible in football -- even if Bayern sometimes get close to it. ""There are details in each game which not everyone sees. ""We aren't afraid, it is possible to pick up points in Munich. ""We have always done well there, but we have to play fast and think fast."" Gladbach have lost and drawn their last two matches at the Allianz Arena since earning a shock 1-0 win there in August 2011. They may be third in Germany's top flight but Gladbach are already a massive 20 points adrift of Guardiola's Bavarian giants, who are on course for a third straight league title. ""We have always tried to play them at their own game, but we need to hold our own in terms of possession,"" added Favre. Gladbach are on course to claim one of Germany's three automatic Champions League places next season and defender Alvaro Dominguez says they can join Wolfsburg in becoming the only domestic sides to beat Bayern this season. ""We can beat anyone, including Bayern,"" said the 25-year-old Spaniard. ""We mustn't allow ourselves to have any fear, if we try to play them at their own game, we'll have lost already."" As Germany's sole representative in the Champions League's quarter-finals, where they face FC Porto home and away next month, Bayern are focused on building on their 11-point lead going into the weekend. ""I have only Borussia Moenchengladbach in my head: first against third, it will be an exciting duel,"" said Bayern's director of sport Matthias Sammer after Friday's Champions League draw in Nyon. Bayern are set to welcome back Dutch winger Arjen Robben, who has scored 17 goals in 20 games this season, after missing their last game with a trapped nerve. But France winger Franck Ribery is struggling to be fit in time after struggling with an ankle injury. ""I am doing all I can, but it looks as though I won't be able to play,"" the Frenchman told German daily Bild."

Winger Herrmann was unlucky not to finish with two goals after his shot hit the post just before the final whistle having come on for the last 25 minutes. Gladbach are now four points clear of the chasing pack in third while Paderborn, with just one win in their last ten matches, drop to third from bottom. Second-placed Wolfsburg are at resurgent Werder Bremen in Sunday's top clash with both teams unbeaten in 2015. Bremen are on a fairytale run of five wins and a draw which has taken them from bottom of the league in December to the verge of a European place. On Saturday, Gabon's Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang played Borussia Dortmund's 'superhero' by scoring their opening goal in a 3-0 home win over Schalke 04 in the Ruhr Valley derby. Dortmund climbed to tenth in the table after picking up their fourth consecutive league win after starting February bottom of the table. Aubameyang -- who had compared winning the derby to 'an orgasm' in midweek -- pounced on a mistake in the visitors' defence to roll the ball home on 78 minutes. It was his fifth goal in as many league games and the 25-year-old celebrated by donning a 'Batman' hat, playing up to his 'caped crusader' nickname, which earned him a booking. His team-mate Marco Reus wore a 'Robin' mask to play his side-kick as it emerged Aubameyang's translator Massimo Mariotti had hidden the costumes behind the Schalke goal. Henrikh Mkhitaryan and Reus added Dortmund's goals in a deserved win as Borussia created 31 shots on goals compared to Schalke's meagre three. The defeat drops Schalke, who were missing several stars with injury, to fifth while neighbours Dortmund are now just eight points adrift of a Champions League place for next season. Bayer Leverkusen built on their shock Champions League win over Atletico Madrid on Wednesday with a 1-0 win at home to strugglers Freiburg to go fourth. Veteran midfielder Simon Rolfes, who will retire at the end of the season, grabbed a first-half winner to give Leverkusen their first league win in four games. Augsburg dropped to sixth after their 1-0 defeat at Hertha Berlin as ex-Chelsea striker Salomon Kalou scored a late winner at the Olympic Stadium to claim his sixth goal of the season. Stuttgart stay bottom after their 1-1 draw at Hanover 96 while Hoffenheim are just two points short of the European places for next season after their 2-0 win at home to Mainz. Ten-man Hamburg drop back to just above the relegation places after their 2-1 defeat at Eintracht Frankfurt. On Friday, Bayern Munich celebrated their 115th birthday with a 4-1 win over Cologne to go 11 points clear at Munich's Allianz Arena. Arjen Robben netted his 17th goal in 19 league matches this season with a crisp header with 20 minutes left to remain the league's top scorer. Captain Bastian Schweinsteiger gave hosts Bayern an early lead and Franck Ribery added a second inside 10 minutes. Cologne fought back when Nigeria international Anthony Ujah scored just before half-time but Bayern roared back as Robben then Poland striker Robert Lewandowski extended their lead."
152,22/02/2015,18:01,Gladbach strike late to salvage draw in Hamburg,An injury-time goal from substitute Branimir Hrgota earned Borussia Moenchengladbach a 1-1 draw at Hamburg in the German Bundesliga on Sunday and denied the home team some breathing space in their fight against relegation.,"A well-taken 73rd-minute strike from Zoltan Stieber looked like it might be enough to lift Hamburg four points clear of the drop zone, only for Swedish forward Hrgota to power home a header from a corner. The visitors had been hoping to take a firmer grip on third place after results went their way on Saturday but in the end they were relieved to escape with a point. Hamburg had made seven changes to the team that was hammered 8-0 by Bayern Munich last weekend, with out-of-form captain Rafael van der Vaart left on the bench as Joe Zinnbauer sought a strong reaction. It was Gladbach who looked more likely to score in the hectic opening minutes however and Max Kruse fired just wide after a swift break from Patrick Hermann. Before five minutes were up, Hermann went even closer -- seeing his deflected close-range strike come back off the post. Gladbach had the chance to move four points clear of fourth-placed Schalke but they had to withstand plenty of pressure in the first half. The game looked to be drifting to a goalless draw in the second period but it exploded into life when Artjoms Rudnevs broke at pace before setting up Stieber. The Hungarian attacker curled home into the bottom corner beyond Gladbach 'keeper Yann Sommer. Rudnevs wasted a chance to put the result beyond doubt before Kruse failed to take what seemed set to be Gladbach's last opportunity. But they forced another corner two minutes into stoppage time and substitute Raffael cleverly stepped out of the path of the ball to allow Hrgota's header to nestle in the corner. On Saturday, Bayern Munich stretched their lead at the top to 11 points following a 6-0 win at Paderborn, while Augsburg goalkeeper Marwin Hitz scored a stoppage-time equaliser against Bayer Leverkusen. Robert Lewandowksi's first-half double on his return to the starting line-up got Bayern on their way, while Arjen Robben is the league's top scorer after getting his 15th and 16th goals of the season. Franck Ribery and Mitchell Weiser also netted as the defending champions scored four times in the second half after the home team had Florian Hartherz sent off. Meanwhile, there was late drama in Augsburg as Hitz stabbed home to salvage a 2-2 draw against Bayer Leverkusen. He is the first goalkeeper to score a Bundesliga goal from open play since Frank Rost for Werder Bremen in March 2002. Bremen are still unbeaten in 2015 after Sebastian Proedl got an injury-time equaliser for a 1-1 draw at Schalke, while Martin Schmidt got off to a winning start as manager of Mainz 05 as they beat Eintracht Frankfurt 3-1. Anthony Ujah scored Cologne's first goal at home in 363 minutes of football as they hit back for a share of the points against Hanover while third-bottom Freiburg also shared the points in a 1-1 draw against Hoffenheim. On Friday, Borussia Dortmund won their third league game in a row with a 3-2 success at bottom club VfB Stuttgart."

154,10/12/2014,14:00,Rising Germany star raring for Leverkusen return,"World Cup winning midfielder Christoph Kramer is keen to get back to Bayer Leverkusen as soon as his loan to Borussia Moenchengladbach ends this summer, German daily Bild reported Wednesday.","""I'm going back (to Leverkusen) this summer and not because I have to, but because I fully believe in their project,"" said the 23-year-old who was in the starting line-up for the 2014 World Cup final. Kramer is under contract with Leverkusen until 2017 but joined Moenchengladbach for a two-years loan in 2013 after two previous seasons on loan at second tier club Vfl Bochum. Leverkusen sports director Rudi Voller has also confirmed that Kramer would be back with the club for the start of the 2015-2016 campaign. Kramer had a memorable World Cup final as he was called into the starting line up after a last minute injury in the warm up to Sami Khedira. The defensive midfielder was then substituted with suspected concussion after a clash of heads led him to ask the referee if the game he was playing in was the World Cup final. Leverkusen are currently fourth in the German league on 23 points, while Moenchengladbach are sixth, also on 23 points."
155,30/11/2014,17:32,Wolfsburg down Gladbach to trim Bayern's lead,Second-placed VfL Wolfsburg trimmed Bayern Munich's lead at the top of the Bundesliga back to seven points on Sunday with a 1-0 win at home to Borussia Moenchengladbach.,"Centre-back Robin Knoche netted what proved to be the 12th-minute winner following a goalmouth scramble. Wolfsburg deserved the win, their first after defeats to Schalke in the Bundesliga and Everton in the Europa League, as veteran striker Ivica Olic went close in the second half while Belgium's Kevin de Bruyne also had a goal ruled offside. The result sees Gladbach drop to fifth as Lucien Favre's side suffered their third straight defeat, despite having set a new club record of 18 matches unbeaten at the start of the season. Before Sunday's result, Pep Guardiola's Bayern had extended their lead to 10 points on Saturday with a workmanlike 1-0 win at Hertha Berlin to recover from their midweek defeat at Manchester City. Arjen Robben's first-half goal in Germany's capital was enough to give Bayern their 10th league win of the season in 13 games. After suffering their first defeat of the season at Manchester in the Champions League on Tuesday, their first loss in 23 games, the defending champions preserved their unbeaten Bundesliga record with a no-frills performance. With six months left of the season, Bayern's march to their third straight Bundesliga title looks virtually unstoppable once again. At the other end, Borussia Dortmund, who are at Eintracht Frankfurt on Sunday night, dropped back to the bottom of the table after both Werder Bremen and Stuttgart picked up wins. Werder Bremen's 4-0 hammering of Paderborn and VfB Stuttgart's 4-1 win at Freiburg on Friday saw them both leapfrog Dortmund. Bremen moved up to 14th as caretaker coach Viktor Skripnik picked up his fourth win in five games since taking over from the fired Robin Dutt as Zlatko Junuzovic, Davie Selke, Fin Bartels and Levent Aycicek scored. Both Schalke and Bayer Leverkusen roared back from midweek Champions League defeats by claiming heavy wins to go sixth and third respectively. Schalke responded to their 5-0 Champions League thrashing by Chelsea with a 4-1 hammering of Mainz at home with Dutch striker Klaas-Jan Huntelaar claiming a hat-trick. Netherlands international Huntelaar fired Schalke into a 2-0 lead after just 25 minutes with two superb goals before Japan striker Shinji Okazaki pulled one back for the visitors. But Schalke made sure of the three points when midfielder Tranquillo Barnetta slotted home on 54 minutes before Huntelaar completed his hat-trick. Bayer Leverkusen put their Champions League defeat at home to Monaco behind them with a 5-1 comeback win at the BayArena against Cologne in the Rhine derby as both Josip Drmic and Karim Bellarabi scored twice. Hakan Calhanoglu added his team's other goal. Bellarabi, Huntelaar and Okazaki, along with Eintracht Frankfurt's Alexander Meier and Bayern Munich's Mario Goetze, are all tied as the league's top scorers with seven goals. Hoffenheim went seventh in the table after their seven-goal thriller, a 4-3 win over Hanover 96, who drop to eighth, as Niklas Suele headed what proved to be the home side's winner."

But both Dortmund goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller and winger Reus are struggling to be fit having been laid low with gastroenteritis. ""And the inflammation is very bad,"" added Dortmund coach Jurgen Klopp. Kruse, Weidenfeller and Reus, who has scored five goals in all competitions so far this season, were included in the Germany squad for next Friday's Euro 2016 qualifier against Gibraltar on November 14 and the friendly away to Spain four days later. Dortmund are looking to transfer their excellent European form to their dire Bundesliga campaign after four straight wins in the Champions League compared to just two wins in 10 domestic league matches and seven points from a possible 30. Klopp says he wants another performance like Tuesday's 4-1 win over Galatasaray in Europe and less like Dortmund's below-par showing in league defeats to Hamburg, Cologne, Hanover and Schalke in recent weeks. ""We're planning on not showing so much of a difference, we want to build on Tuesday's performance,"" explained the 47-year-old. Gladbach coach Lucien Favre has included Kruse after the striker who sat out Thursday's Europa League win at Cyprus' Apollon Limassol with a leg knock. The guests are looking to set a new club record of 18 matches unbeaten since the start of the season. ""Dortmund are still a great team, even if they currently aren't getting good results in the league,"" said Swiss coach Favre. Both attacking midfielders Andre Hahn and Patrick Hermann, who scored their late second goal in the 2-0 win at Apollon, are fit having scored three goals between them in last Sunday's 3-1 league win over Hoffenheim."

Favre turns 57 on Sunday, but Gladbach's Swiss coach says all he wants is to see his team break down the compact Hoffenheim defence to stay hot on the heels of Pep Guardiola's league leaders Bayern. ""My birthday isn't important, the only thing that matters is the game against Hoffenheim,"" he said, having seen his side beat Hamburg 2-0 last year on his birthday. Along with Bayern, Gladbach and Hoffenheim are the only teams still unbeaten in the Bundesliga after nine matches. Favre has fashioned Gladbach into a compact side who like to counter-attack using the pace of wingers Andre Hahn and Patrick Herrmann. Meanwhile, Germany's Christoph Kramer and Switzerland's Granit Xhaka, who misses the Hoffenheim game with an ankle injury, have formed a strong midfield partnership. But having held Bayern to a goalless draw last Sunday, Favre expects another tough task against Hoffenheim. ""They have a very good team and they strengthened well before the season. They're solid at the back and don't concede many goals,"" said the Swiss. ""For me, it's no real surprise that they're currently where they are in the league. They are a team with a lot of potential."" Hoffenheim's Roberto Firmino has just been called up to the Brazil squad, while attacking midfielder Kevin Volland, 22, has already won his first cap for Germany and scored the winner in their 1-0 victory over Paderborn last time out."
158,26/10/2014,19:39,Leaders Bayern drop points at plucky Gladbach,Leaders Bayern Munich dropped their first Bundesliga points for over a month after being held to a goalless draw at second-placed Borussia Moenchengladbach in Sunday's high-tempo clash.,"Gladbach threatened to inflict a first defeat of the season on Pep Guardiola's Bavarians despite less than 30 percent possession, counter-attacking relentlessly. The hosts' tactics were to soak up Bayern's pressure and hit the league leaders on the counter in an intense game and it nearly paid off. Bayern goalkeeper Manuel Neuer had a busy night to deny Gladbach forwards Raffael, Max Kruse and Patrick Herrmann, while at the other end Munich's David Alaba hit the post in the first-half. Poland striker Robert Lewandowski also fired wide for Bayern while replacement Claudio Pizarro squandered a chance in the dying stages. Bayern drew for only the third time this season after six consecutive wins -- including Tuesday's stunning 7-1 thrashing of Roma in the Champions League -- but stay four points clear of second-placed Gladbach. Earlier, VfL Wolfsburg moved up to third after inflicting Mainz's first defeat of the season on their guests with a 3-0 win. Goals by Naldo, Ivan Perisic and Daniel Caliguri gave the hosts the three points. Wolfsburg -- for whom Belgian playmaker Kevin de Bruyne was outstanding -- took the lead when Brazilian defender Naldo headed home from a corner after only 15 minutes. Mainz's goalkeeper Loris Karius denied De Bruyne when he pushed the former Chelsea midfielder's fierce strike over the bar on 58 minutes, but Wolves' second goal came from the resulting corner. Naldo was again left unmarked in the area and he headed on for Croatian international Perisic to guide his header past Karius from close range. Caliguri made sure of the win on 87 minutes when he tapped home a cross by Belgium Under-21 international Junior Malanda. ""You could see that we were really on top of things. Mainz started strongly, but we showed our potential,"" enthused Wolves' coach Dieter Hecking. ""The way we played, Mainz couldn't take anything off us and they were really a class below us."" On Saturday, Borussia Dortmund's horror run of domestic league results continued as a 1-0 defeat -- their fourth successive loss -- by Hanover 96 left them 15th and just a point above the relegation places. They have the daunting task of facing Bayern next Saturday in Munich. Dortmund's terrible domestic form is in stark contrast to their Champions League campaign, where they top their group with three straight wins after Wednesday's impressive 4-0 victory at Galatasaray. In a bid to bring their European form to the Bundesliga, Dortmund even had special permission to face Hanover in their Champions League strip, but to no avail. Roberto di Matteo failed to pick up his third straight win as Schalke 04 coach on Saturday evening as the Royal Blues lost 1-0 at ten-man Bayer Leverkusen in the battle between two of Germany's Champions League sides. Turkey midfielder Hakan Calhanoglu settled the matter with a superbly-struck free-kick on 53 minutes although the hosts suffered a blow with the loss of German international midfielder Stefan Reinartz for three months after fracturing an eye socket. Bottom side Werder Bremen sacked coach Robin Dutt on Saturday, less than 24 hours after his side's 1-0 defeat at home to Cologne. The 49-year-old is the third Bundesliga coach casualty this season after Mirko Slomka (from Hamburg) and Jens Keller (Schalke 04). Bremen's Under-23 coach Viktor Skripnik has been appointed as caretaker coach, with ex-Germany midfielder Torsten Frings during the search for Dutt's successor."
159,31/08/2014,19:57,Tired Gladbach settle for Freiburg draw,Freiburg missed a penalty but picked up their first point of the new Bundesliga season following a 0-0 draw with Borussia Moenchengladbach on Sunday.,"Swiss attacker Admir Mehmedi scooped a spot-kick high over the bar midway through the second half in a drab encounter at Freiburg's Mage Solar Stadion. Gladbach had beaten FK Sarajevo 7-0 in the Europa League play-offs on Thursday but a fifth competitive match in 16 days looked to be a step too far for the visitors. Freiburg 'keeper Roman Buerki tipped over a shot from fellow Swiss international Granit Xhaka 14 minutes into a game that was desperately short of goalmouth action. Approaching the hour mark, Mehmedi found Jonathan Schmid at the back post but his volley was comfortably turned behind by Gladbach 'keeper Yann Sommer. Freiburg were given a great chance to go in front when Gladbach defender Tony Jantschke chopped down home substitute Maximilian Philipp after 62 minutes. Mehmedi blazed over, however, meaning the home side are still waiting for their first goal of the new campaign. Earlier, Mainz and Hanover 96 also played out a scoreless draw. Mainz had more of the game in the first half but Hanover striker Joselu went closest to scoring before Hiroshi Kiyotake had a shot cleared off the line for the visitors in the second half. Ja-Cheol Koo, who scored an injury-time penalty in Mainz's draw at Paderborn on the opening day, had a decent appeal for another spot-kick turned down on 13 minutes after a challenge from Leonardo Bittencourt. Shinji Okazaki fired wide from a tight angle inside the box and the Japanese striker then had his own appeal for a penalty waved away by referee Sascha Stegemann after going to ground under Hanover defender Marcelo. Hanover, who beat Schalke last weekend, almost broke the deadlock six minutes into the second half after a botched clearance from Stefan Bell fell to Kiyotake. The Japanese midfielder showed good footwork to create some space before drilling a shot towards the corner - Mainz thankful that Moritz was on the line to clear. Joselu had a chance to win it with 13 minutes left but, after Artur Sobiech picked him out in the area, he couldn't direct the ball beyond Karius and both sides had to settle for a point. On Saturday, Xabi Alonso made his Bayern Munich debut and Robert Lewandowski scored his first goal for the club as the defending champions drew 1-1 at Schalke 04. The result means that Bayer Leverkusen sit top of the fledgling table following their 4-2 home win over Hertha Berlin. On Friday, Borussia Dortmund held off a late comeback to beat Augsburg 3-2 in what was their first league win of the new campaign."
160,19/08/2014,02:05,Germany riding crest of wave as Bundesliga begins,The new Bundesliga season gets underway this weekend with German football riding the crest of a wave following the national team's triumph at the World Cup in Brazil last month.,"That thoroughly deserved victory, given to Joachim Loew's side by Mario Goetze's extra-time strike in the final against Argentina, saw a unified Germany crowned as world champions for the first time. But at club level, the Bundesliga has been leading the way for some time. It averaged 3.16 goals per game last season, considerably more than any of its major European counterparts, while average gates were over 42,000, making the German top flight the best attended league anywhere. ""In my opinion, the Bundesliga's the most attractive league in the world,"" Borussia Moenchengladbach coach Lucien Favre told bundesliga.com. ""The hype in Germany is amazing, and now they've won the World Cup so it's not going to tail off in a rush."" Nevertheless, the biggest problem facing the Bundesliga, as ever, is how to counter the dominance of Bayern Munich, who have romped to the title and added the German Cup in each of the last two campaigns. They have seen Toni Kroos and Mario Mandzukic depart and lost Javi Martinez to a serious knee injury in last week's SuperCup defeat to Borussia Dortmund, but the Bavarians remain favourites. And yet the rest can draw some hope from the very fact this is a Bundesliga season immediately following a World Cup, and that has not tended to help Bayern in the recent past. After Germany hosted the 2006 World Cup, Stuttgart went on to win the Bundesliga, while in 2011 Dortmund pipped Bayern to the title. In 2009, after Germany reached the Euro 2008 final, it was Wolfsburg who were champions. Six members of Pep Guardiola's squad played in the World Cup final, including Goetze, while Dante and Arjen Robben were also involved until the latter stages in Brazil. That is why chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge wanted the start of the new season delayed in order to give these players longer to prepare, but that request was unsurprisingly turned down by Bayern's rivals. ""We have to face the fact that the first half of the season will be difficult,"" said Guardiola, who at times had only a skeleton squad in pre-season training. ""We are at least one month behind schedule."" Guardiola has added to his squad with compatriots Juan Bernat from Valencia and Pepe Reina, who will provide competition in goal for Manuel Neuer. But the marquee signing was Robert Lewandowski, a prolific goalscorer for Dortmund in the last four years. However, Dortmund have moved to replace the Pole by signing Italy striker Ciro Immobile from Torino and Colombia's Adrian Ramos from Hertha Berlin. Stability is key at the Signal Iduna Park, where coach Jurgen Klopp, who led Dortmund to back-to-back titles in 2011 and 2012 and a Champions League final defeat to Bayern in 2013, is entering his seventh season in charge. ""We want to establish ourselves further at the top of the league and qualify directly for the Champions League,"" said sporting director Michael Zorc modestly. However, Guardiola knows where the danger lies, saying: ""We may have won the last two league titles, but they clinched the previous two. Our great challenge is to keep up our level to keep them at distance."" Beneath them, Schalke, Bayer Leverkusen and Wolfsburg will again be hoping to contend for Champions League qualification at least. Schalke have kept Klaas-Jan Huntelaar and Julian Draxler, while Sidney Sam has joined from Leverkusen, and few teams can boast a midfield as strong as Wolfsburg, with Kevin de Bruyne, Luiz Gustavo and France's Josuha Guilavogui. Bayer have signed Swiss striker Josip Drmic from Nuremberg and have a new coach in Roger Schmidt, back in his native country after winning the Austrian title with Salzburg. Hamburg will be hoping for a stable campaign after almost being relegated for the first time in their history last season. There are new coaches at Mainz, Eintracht Frankfurt and Stuttgart, who have reappointed Armin Veh, the architect of their 2007 title triumph, while Cologne are back among the elite and Paderborn are in the Bundesliga for the first time."

He will miss Gladbach's trip to fourth-tier Homburg in the first round of the German Cup on Saturday as well as the first leg of the Europa League play-off tie against Sarajevo on August 21 and the Bundesliga curtain-raiser at home to Stuttgart three days later."
