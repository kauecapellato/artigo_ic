0,09/01/2021,23:11,Pochettino gets first win with PSG but Lyon stay top of Ligue 1,"Mauricio Pochettino celebrated his first victory as Paris Saint-Germain coach on his home debut on Saturday as Moise Kean set the reigning champions on their way to a 3-0 win over Brest, but Lyon remain top of Ligue 1 after drawing at Rennes.","Substitutes Mauro Icardi and Pablo Sarabia added late goals for PSG who would have gone top on goal difference had Lyon not recovered from 2-0 down to earn a point in Rennes and extend their unbeaten run to 16 games. PSG are second at the season's halfway stage, a point behind the leaders and ahead on goal difference of third-placed Lille, who triumphed 1-0 at Nimes. With Neymar still missing, it was not a vintage performance from PSG on a freezing Parisian night in an empty stadium -- supporters are still barred from games in France with a nighttime curfew in place nationwide as part of the fight against coronavirus. That meant it was never going to be the return to the Parc des Princes that Pochettino -- who was a popular player for PSG two decades ago -- would have liked. Nevertheless the Argentine will be relieved to have his first win in charge after his first game ended in a 1-1 draw at Saint-Etienne in midweek. He could now get his first piece of silverware when PSG play Marseille on Wednesday in the Champions Trophy, the French equivalent of a Super Cup that in normal times is the curtain-raiser to the season. It remains to be seen if Neymar, after four weeks on the sidelines, will be fit for that game, while defender Thilo Kehrer will be sidelined after news of his positive coronavirus test fell shortly before kick-off against Brest. Pochettino again started playmaker Marco Verratti in an advanced role behind central striker Kean, with the latter opening the scoring in the 16th minute. Captain Marquinhos headed Angel di Maria's corner against the post and Kean was on hand to nod in the rebound from barely a metre out. It was his 11th goal, and his ninth in Ligue 1, since signing on loan from Everton in October. Brest, who sit in mid-table and are one of the best sides to watch in France, could have scored before that but Keylor Navas clawed away Romain Faivre's early effort for the visitors. It was only in the final 10 minutes that PSG ran away with the game, as Kylian Mbappe set up Icardi -- on in place of Kean -- to get the second before Sarabia fired in to make it 3-0. Lyon's long unbeaten streak looked set to end as they found themselves two goals down in Rennes, with Clement Grenier and Benjamin Bourigeaud scoring for the home side. However, Memphis Depay pulled one back with his 11th goal of the season on 79 minutes and Jason Denayer equalised shortly after. Lille bounced back from a shock midweek home defeat by Angers to win at Nimes thanks to a first-half goal by veteran Turkish striker Burak Yilmaz. The draw for Rennes, and a goalless draw for Marseille at Dijon, allowed Monaco to move up to fourth spot as they beat Angers 3-0 with German international Kevin Volland grabbing his ninth Ligue 1 goal in between efforts from Guillermo Maripan and Stevan Jovetic. There were also wins for Bordeaux, Reims and Strasbourg."
1,08/01/2021,17:39,Neymar will miss Pochettino's home PSG bow,"Neymar will again be missing when Paris Saint Germain face Brest in Ligue 1, manager Mauricio Pochettino said on Friday.","Absent since being stretchered off in the defeat against Lyon in December, Neymar has not fully recovered from his ankle injury. ""He will be evaluated today, and we will work out a strategy from there,"" said Pochettino, who took over on January 2 and has yet to put out a team including the club's biggest star. Saturday's game will be Pochettino's first at home since taking charge. ""We will have a better idea if he can resume with the group, we are waiting for the results."" Neymar's absence casts doubt on whether he can play in the French Champions Trophy against bitter rivals Marseille on Wednesday. Saturday's games take Ligue 1 to the halfway point. Paris can still take the honorary title of 'autumn champions', if they beat Brest and Lyon lose at Rennes."
2,08/01/2021,03:00,Pochettino looking for lift-off with PSG,"Mauricio Pochettino described getting the job as Paris Saint-Germain coach as a gift from Father Christmas, but his first game in charge, with Neymar absent, indicated that not everything will be straightforward for the Argentine.","Pochettino's first home game as coach comes on Saturday when PSG take on Brest following their 1-1 draw with Saint-Etienne in midweek, a result which left the reigning champions three points behind leaders Lyon at the top of Ligue 1. Absent since being stretchered off in the defeat against Lyon in December, Neymar could return this weekend, although PSG have other injury problems to contend with and currently look some way short of being genuine contenders to win the Champions League. As well as the world's most expensive player, PSG were without the likes of Presnel Kimpembe, Juan Bernat, Alessandro Florenzi, Leandro Paredes, Danilo Pereira and Mauro Icardi in midweek. By the time PSG play Barcelona in the Champions League last 16, first leg on February 16, Pochettino will hope to have the majority of his other crocked players available again, and he will hope to have stamped his mark on his new side. ""A point is not enough, but in the circumstances we have to settle for it,"" said the former Tottenham Hotspur coach at the end of his first game after more than a year out of football. ""There are a lot of aspects we need to work on if we want to achieve great things in Paris. ""I am not worried. We don't have much time, but there is lots of quality in the team."" During his time out of the game, Pochettino had been linked in the English media with a possible move to one of the Premier League's giants were a job to become available, such as at Manchester United. But his past as a player at PSG, coupled with a reputation that has remained sky-high during his time out of the limelight, made it no great surprise to see him end up at the Parc des Princes. ""I am happy after 14 months without anything,"" he said after making his return to a dugout, albeit in these stark times of football without fans due to the coronavirus pandemic. ""It is also a bizarre feeling without supporters. It was strange. I had never experienced that before. There is much less warmth."" There is still a chance that Depay will leave Lyon before the January transfer window closes. A move to Barcelona fell through in October and he is out of contract at the end of the season, but Lyon fans will be hoping he stays until then to continue leading their title bid. With the captain's armband on, the Dutchman scored twice in Wednesday's 3-2 win over Lens which left OL three points clear of PSG at the top of the table. He has scored 10 times this season, and afterwards he said: ""Let's just make the most of my presence here, maybe until the end of the season. We have a great team. That's all I have to say."" Lyon go to fourth-placed Rennes on Saturday. 15 - League leaders Lyon are unbeaten in 15 matches and have won 10 of their last 12. 10 - Mauricio Pochettino is the 10th man to coach PSG having previously played for the club. The last was Antoine Kombouare, who was also the first of the Qatar era but was sacked in December 2011, within six months of the takeover. 10 - The number of seconds required by Monaco's Aleksandr Golovin to score against Lorient on Wednesday having come off the bench for his first appearance since August after injury. Saturday (All kick-offs 2000 GMT) Bordeaux v Lorient, Dijon v Marseille, Lens v Strasbourg, Metz v Nice, Monaco v Angers, Montpellier v Nantes, Nimes v Lille, Paris Saint-Germain v Brest, Reims v Saint-Etienne, Rennes v Lyon"
3,30/08/2020,23:33,Thauvin lifts virus-afflicted Marseille to win at Brest,Florian Thauvin marked his first start in 15 months with a goal and two assists as Marseille beat Brest 3-2 on Sunday in their opening game of the Ligue 1 season.,"World Cup winner Thauvin missed all but 20 minutes of the coronavirus-shortened 2019-20 season with an ankle injury as Marseille came a distant second to Paris Saint-Germain, the club's best finish in seven years. Coach Andre Villas-Boas hopes the return to full fitness of Thauvin can help the team close the gap on bitter rivals PSG, who start their campaign on September 10 and host Marseille three days later. ""I'm really happy to have scored. It was a very long time out, the first long injury of my career,"" Thauvin told Telefoot. ""I admit I went through a difficult period but I worked a lot and I'm proud because I didn't give up."" ""I think I'm at 70 or 80 percent,"" he added. ""But if you had told me after so long without playing I was going to be at this level, I would have signed right away."" Marseille's scheduled opener last weekend was postponed after they suffered five cases of Covid-19. Dimitri Payet, Bouna Sarr and Alvaro Gonzalez were notable absentees for the trip to Brest as the club reported three further infections this week. However, goalkeeper Steve Mandanda and left-back Jordan Amavi were cleared to play after stints in quarantine, while Argentine defender Leonardo Balerdi made his Marseille debut after signing on loan from Borussia Dortmund. Thauvin needed just 20 minutes to fire Marseille in front, gathering possession on the right and slashing inside in trademark style before sweeping home on his left foot via a telling deflection that lifted the ball over Gautier Larsonneur's despairing dive. His free-kick picked out Duje Caleta-Car to volley in a second on 27 minutes, the goal belatedly awarded after a lengthy VAR review overturned an initial offside decision. Romain Faivre smashed in his first Brest goal just before half-time as Marseille's vulnerability in their first competitive match since March 6 continued to give the home side reason to believe. A Gaetan Charbonnier strike was ruled out for offside and the forward then sliced wide of an open goal before Marseille restored their two-goal advantage when another Thauvin free-kick was headed in by Croatian centre-back Caleta-Car. Charbonnier stabbed beyond Mandanda a minute from time to set up a nervy finish but Marseille clung on as Brest captain Jean-Kevin Duverne's last-gasp header landed on the roof of the net. Niko Kovac earned his first Ligue 1 victory as Monaco coach earlier on Sunday as his side won 1-0 at Metz. Teenage centre-back Benoit Badiashile scored for the second game in a row and Monaco held on despite playing almost half the match a man down following the dismissal of Youssouf Fofana. ""It was a very difficult match, especially in the second half with a player less. The reaction of the team, down to 10, was very good just like last week when they came back from 2-0 down,"" said Kovac, whose opening game in charge against Reims ended in a 2-2 draw. ""I'm happy to have won, particularly as Monaco's last win came back in February."" Jonathan Bamba continued to rediscover his scoring touch with Lille winning 1-0 at Reims. Lille winger Bamba, who scored only one goal in 26 league appearances last season, hit his second in two games of the new campaign in the 32nd minute of a dour game. Bamba crossed his arms across his chest after scoring, dedicating his goal to actor Chadwick Boseman, who played the superhero from ""Black Panther"" and died on Friday at the age of 43. Bordeaux are in second place, two points behind leaders Nice, after a 2-0 triumph at Angers courtesy of goals from Nigeria international Josh Maja and Toma Basic. Nantes are one of five sides on four points, along with Rennes, Lille and Monaco, as they defeated Nimes 2-1 despite finishing the game with just nine men. Romain Hamouma netted twice for Saint-Etienne in a 2-0 win over promoted Lorient as last season's French Cup runners-up also made a belated start to the new campaign."
4,02/03/2020,12:30,African players in Europe: Sarr sparkles as Watford stun Liverpool,Ismaila Sarr overshadowed fellow Senegalese Sadio Mane by scoring twice as lowly Watford won 3-0 to end the 44-match unbeaten Premier League streak of runaway leaders Liverpool.,"Mane has been among the key figures as the Reds march toward a first league title in three decades, but he had to take a back seat at Vicarage Road as Sarr blossomed. His pace and trickery unsettled Liverpool and he was rewarded with two goals before setting up Troy Deeney for the third. ISMAILA SARR (Watford) The Hornets' record signing was up against his idol Mane and stabbed home the opener at the near post and then showed his pace and poise to chip Alisson Becker for Watford's second. Sarr then turned provider for the third as he teed up Deeney to complete a famous win that lifted Watford out of the bottom three. JORDAN AYEW (Crystal Palace) Ayew scored the only goal as Palace got the better of rivals Brighton to ease any fear of being dragged into a relegation battle. The Ghanaian's strike took his league tally for the season to seven -- matching his best tally for a single campaign in England. MBWANA SAMATTA (Aston Villa) Samatta did Tanzania proud by scoring in the League Cup final against Manchester City, but his diving header at the near post just before half-time was merely a consolation for Villa as City won 2-1 to lift the trophy for a third straight season. YOUSSEF EN-NESYRI (Sevilla) En-Nesyri scored a 93rd-minute winner as Sevilla beat Osasuna 3-2 to move up to third in La Liga. The Moroccan striker, who joined Sevilla from Leganes in January, opened the scoring with a guided shot into the corner before Lucas Ocampos made it two on the stroke of half-time. Osasuna came back in the second half through goals from Aridane and Roberto Torres, only for En-Nesyri to snatch victory for Sevilla in injury-time with a close-range finish. RAMY BENSEBAINI (Borussia Moenchengladbach) Algerian Bensebaini scored a crucial early goal for Moenchengladbach as they beat Augsburg 3-2 to keep pace with the top of the Bundesliga table. Bensebaini, in his first start in 2020 after returning from injury, headed home a cross from Lars Stindl to put the visitors 1-0 up. When asked how it felt to be back in the Foals' line-up after the match, he simply replied ""it was fun"". ACHRAF HAKIMI (Borussia Dortmund) Having made his name as one of Dortmund's best going forward this season, the Real Madrid loanee was called on to do more than his fair share of defending against a stubborn Freiburg side. Working on the edge of a four-man midfield, Hakimi's pace was valuable during the 1-0 win as he snuffed out several Freiburg counter attacks. He did have a shot on goal deflected in the dying stages but was unable to add to his tally of two Bundesliga goals this season. STEPHANE BAHOKEN (Angers) The Cameroon striker was rewarded with a start for his team at Brest after coming off the bench against Montpellier last weekend and scoring the winner a minute later. He delivered again in Brest, although he needed a full 43 minutes to bag the only goal of the match this time. MAX-ALAIN GRADEL (Toulouse) Ivory Coast winger Gradel, 32, returned to the Toulouse starting line-up last weekend for the first time in a Ligue 1 game since early December following injury. He kept his place and wore the captain's armband but could not prevent the division's bottom side from going down 2-0 at home to Rennes. They have now taken just a single point from their last 17 league games and are heading fast towards relegation. KARL TOKO-EKAMBI (Lyon) Cameroon forward Toko-Ekambi, who joined Lyon on loan from Villarreal in January, came off the bench and contributed to their 2-0 win over derby rivals Saint-Etienne. Having earlier had a goal disallowed for offside, he won the late penalty which Moussa Dembele scored to seal the victory. Toko-Ekambi had started the 1-0 Champions League last-16, first leg win over Juventus in midweek and hit the bar in the first half against the Italians."
5,08/01/2020,20:55,Lyon sweep into French League Cup semi-finals,Lyon eased into the semi-finals of the French League Cup on Wednesday with a 3-1 victory at home to Brest.,"Moussa Dembele scored the opening goal on 19 minutes and Houssem Aouar added a second shortly after half-time for Rudi Garcia's side. Samuel Grandsir gave Brest hope with a tidy finish five minutes from time but Jean Lucas made sure Lyon joined Reims in the last four with a firm 20-yard drive in stoppage time. Reims eliminated holders Strasbourg on Tuesday after winning 4-2 on penalties following a goalless draw. Record eight-time champions Paris Saint-Germain host Saint-Etienne later on Wednesday while Lille take on Amiens. The competition, which includes all the clubs from France's top two divisions and a handful of teams from the third tier, will be suspended indefinitely at the end of this season. The draw for the last four takes place on Thursday."
6,09/11/2019,22:10,Icardi strikes again to edge PSG past Brest,Mauro Icardi came off the bench to score a late winner as Paris Saint-Germain extended their Ligue 1 lead to nine points despite another unconvincing performance in a 2-1 victory at Brest on Saturday.,"The reigning French champions, who were beaten by then-bottom club Dijon last week before scraping past Club Brugge in the Champions League, needed Icardi's ninth goal in eight games to secure the three points. ""We can't score four goals each time,"" said PSG coach Thomas Tuchel. ""I'm very happy. It's five wins in six games. I didn't expect us to have our best match, but we had to be calm and fight."" Brest, promoted from the second tier last season, caused PSG problems throughout and had levelled with 18 minutes remaining through Samuel Grandsir. Second-placed Angers missed the chance to cut the gap to seven points as they were held to a goalless draw at Reims. Tuchel saw his long injury list extended before kick-off as goalkeeper Keylor Navas pulled out of the game after suffering a thigh problem in the warm-up. The Costa Rican joined Neymar, Kylian Mbappe, defenders Thomas Meunier and Thilo Kehrer and midfielder Ander Herrera on the sidelines. Edinson Cavani made his first start since August, but struggled in front of goal. ""For Edi (Cavani), it wasn't easy because he's lacking rhythm,"" added Tuchel. ""He has to manage his competition with Icardi. He is full of confidence."" The visitors claimed a 39th-minute lead as Angel Di Maria raced clear before clipping a chipped finish over Brest goalkeeper Gautier Larsonneur to score his eighth goal of the campaign. His effort survived a VAR review for offside to send PSG into the interval ahead. Cavani wasted two clear-cut chances in the space of three minutes just after the hour mark, and Brest made him pay. Substitute Grandsir collected the ball inside the area and fired a low effort through goalkeeper Sergio Rico, making his Parisian debut after signing on-loan from Sevilla. But the Spaniard redeemed himself shortly afterwards, keeping out Haris Belkebla's long-range strike. On-loan Inter Milan striker Icardi had the final say, though, pouncing inside the six-yard box in the 85th minute to scramble the ball over the line after Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting's cross was only partially cleared. Later on Saturday, last season's runners-up Lille were held to a 0-0 draw by Metz at the Stade Pierre Mauroy to end a disappointing week on a low note. Lille, who were knocked out of the Champions League by a 4-1 loss at Valencia in midweek, sit third, already 11 points behind PSG. Monaco made it three wins in four league games to move into the top half of the table as Aleksandr Golovin's first-half strike was enough to edge out struggling Dijon 1-0. On Sunday, unpopular Lyon coach Rudi Garcia takes his new side to their rivals and his former club Marseille."
7,08/11/2019,02:35,PSG hail Navas as bitter rivals Marseille and Lyon clash,"If Paris Saint-Germain have been held back in recent years by their lack of a truly top-class goalkeeper, Keylor Navas showed just why they were so keen to bring him to the French capital with his midweek performance in the Champions League.","The Costa Rican joined PSG in September from Real Madrid as Alphonse Areola moved in the other direction, and on Wednesday his late penalty save helped secure a 1-0 win over Club Brugge that clinched his side's place in the last 16. The last line of defence for Real as they won three successive Champions Leagues between 2016 and 2018, Navas is yet to concede a goal in Europe since arriving in Paris. Indeed, the 32-year-old has let in only five goals in 12 matches for Thomas Tuchel's side. ""He is an extraordinary goalkeeper. He won three Champions Leagues with Real Madrid in a competition where goalkeeper is such an important position. They can change the outcome of a game,"" remarked midfielder Marco Verratti after Wednesday's game, in which Mauro Icardi scored the winner. ""He will bring so much experience and calmness to the side,"" said sporting director Leonardo. Leading sports daily L'Equipe on Thursday gave over its front page to the goalkeeper with a headline referencing 1982 Jean-Paul Belmondo action comedy The Ace of Aces. And yet less than a week ago it is true that Navas hardly covered himself in glory as PSG suffered a shock 2-1 defeat at Dijon. Then again, neither did any of his teammates, and Europe is where this team will really be judged. A trip to Real Madrid later this month, when Neymar should be fit again, could be revealing. In Ligue 1, PSG have lost three of their opening 12 games and yet they are already seven points clear of Angers at the top. They travel to face Brest on Saturday where Tuchel will again have to decide whether to leave the club's all-time top goal-scorer, Edinson Cavani, on the bench. Icardi has been preferred to the Uruguayan recently and has now scored eight times in the last seven matches. Few tears were shed among Marseille fans when Garcia left his job as coach at the Velodrome at the end of last season. In contrast, there was plenty of unrest in the Lyon support when the 55-year-old was appointed as successor to the sacked Sylvinho last month. Garcia's recent past with Marseille was always going to be difficult to swallow for Lyon fans given the frankly bitter rivalry that has developed between the clubs. On Sunday, Garcia heads back to Marseille with his new team for the 'Olympico' as the sides jostle for position in a packed table behind PSG. Lyon are 10th but sit just four points behind Marseille in fourth and have won their last three games, including a precious 3-1 defeat of Benfica in the Champions League in midweek. Garcia has been dealt a major blow, though, with the news that Memphis Depay -- scorer of 11 goals in 14 games this season -- will miss the match with a hamstring injury. 8 - The number of goals scored by Mauro Icardi in PSG's last seven matches. 5 - Lyon have won their last five Ligue 1 meetings with Marseille and are unbeaten in 10 encounters since a 4-2 defeat in May 2014. 10 - Lille are unbeaten in their last 10 home league games, a record they will hope to extend as they entertain Metz on the rebound from a 4-1 loss at Valencia which eliminated them from the Champions League."
8,31/05/2019,13:54,Dall'Oglio named new coach of promoted Brest,"Ligue 1 side Brest have named Olivier Dall'Oglio as their new coach after his dismissal by Dijon in December, the newly-promoted outfit announced on Thursday.","In a statement, Brest announced that Dall'Oglio has been given a two-year contract with an option to extend. ""Dall'Oglio's main mission will be to keep the club in Ligue 1 and help it adapt to this level of football after six seasons spent in Ligue 2,"" Brest continued. The 55-year-old was sacked by Dijon at the end of last year after more than six years at the club with the team in the league's relegation play-off place. Dijon finished where Dall'Oglio left them, and host Lens in the decisive second leg of the play-off on Sunday with the tie locked at 1-1."
9,03/01/2014,02:20,"Football: PSG, Monaco begin Cup quest with awkward away ties","Barely 72 hours after facing Real Madrid in a glamour friendly in Qatar, Paris Saint-Germain return to domestic action on Sunday with a trip to Ligue 2 side Brest in the last 64 of the French Cup.","Laurent Blanc's PSG side are top of Ligue 1 halfway through the season and on course to retain the title, but they are bidding for success on all fronts and so will send out a strong team for the encounter in Brittany against a Brest side struggling in the second tier since their relegation last season. PSG concluded their winter training camp with a 1-0 defeat to Real Madrid in Doha on Thursday, but Blanc declared himself satisfied with his team's showing against the Spanish giants as they prepare for the second half of the campaign and their entry into the national knockout competition. ""We were as good as them, if not better, in many areas. The work we have done here has been very hard but very good,"" said Blanc of the Madrid clash. ""We have been very demanding with the players and they have responded well."" Blanc will start with a strong side against Brest, although Christophe Jallet has a back problem that may require surgery. The capital club, who have won the French Cup eight times, are not the only leading name faced with a tie against lower-league opposition in Brittany this weekend. Monaco, who sit second in the top flight, travel to third-tier strugglers Vannes with the focus on whether Colombian striker Radamel Falcao will start a game for the first time since November 24. The former Atletico Madrid man made his comeback after a thigh complaint as a substitute in the shock 2-1 home defeat to Valenciennes just before Christmas. Bordeaux travel to amateur outfit Raon l'Etape, a team they beat on penalties on the way to winning the competition last season, while elsewhere there are a number of ties between Ligue 1 sides. Rennes entertain Valenciennes on Saturday, before Nantes face Nice and Bastia take on last season's runners-up Evian on Sunday with France international striker Djibril Cisse declaring himself ready to play for the Corsicans for the first time after signing on an 18-month deal. ""I last played on December 12. I will need to do a little bit of work with the team but I will be operational as of Sunday,"" declared Cisse at his unveiling. Marseille, one of Cisse's old clubs, also face top-flight opposition in the shape of Reims, who will be hoping for a repeat of their 3-2 triumph at the Stade Velodrome in the league in late October.
