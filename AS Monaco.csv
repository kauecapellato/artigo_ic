0,24/01/2021,00:36,Villas-Boas optimistic Marseille will overcome troubles,Andre Villas-Boas said he was confident Marseille will emerge from their turbulent run after his team slid to a third successive Ligue 1 defeat following Saturday's 3-1 loss at Monaco.,"""There is no crisis. The mindset was good, the players were concentrated and focused. I think we'll come through this because the guys are giving everything,"" said Villas-Boas. Nemanja Radonjic skipped clear of the home defence to give Marseille the lead on 12 minutes at the Stade Louis II, but Monaco equalised early in the second half through Guillermo Maripan's header. Aurelien Tchouameni's first goal in the French top-flight put Monaco ahead before Stevan Jovetic's thumping free-kick in stoppage time sealed a fifth victory in six games for Niko Kovac's resurgent team. ""The goal at the start of the second half really hurt us,"" said Villas-Boas. ""We lost confidence. We conceded three goals from set-pieces even though we've been solid in that area. The first half was good, the second not very good."" Arkadiusz Milik made his Marseille debut off the bench after signing on an 18-month loan from Napoli, but the Polish striker was unable to arrest his new club's slump as they lost a third league game in a row for the first time since April 2015. They remain sixth and 13 points behind leaders Paris Saint-Germain, while Monaco are closing in on the top three with just a point separating them and Lyon. While Villas-Boas refuses to give up the fight, a tough run of fixtures threatens to plunge Marseille into deeper trouble as a return to Europe fades from view. His side return home to face Rennes next weekend, with a second meeting against Lens in a fortnight preceding the visit of bitter rivals PSG to the Velodrome on February 7. Villas-Boas also confirmed midfielder Morgan Sanson was set to complete a move to Aston Villa after he was left out of the squad against Monaco. ""Sanson didn't have his head in the right place to play, seeing as the club has decided to let him leave,"" he explained. The 26-year-old is expected to join Villa for an initial fee of 15 million euros ($18.3 million). Earlier on Saturday, Nice won for just the second time in 11 outings as Youcef Atal's second-half goal was enough for a 1-0 victory at Lens."

Zinedine Zidane's side are playing catch up to Atletico Madrid, despite having played a game more, after draws against struggling Elche and Osasuna, two of the league's bottom three, in recent weeks. Alaves beat Madrid 2-1 in the capital in late November but have won just once in eight matches since, their slide into a relegation scrap costing coach Pablo Machin his job last week with former Spain international Abelardo Fernandez returning to take charge. AC Milan v Atalanta, Saturday 1700 GMT Zlatan Ibrahimovic wasted little time shaking off any rust accrued while sidelined by a muscle injury as he scored twice against Cagliari on Monday, in his first Serie A start in two months. The 39-year-old Swede has scored 12 goals in just seven starts this season, second only to Cristiano Ronaldo in the league, and Milan this week strengthened their attack with the signing of ex-Juventus striker Mario Mandzukic on a free transfer. ""Zlatan and I have a lot of experience. In football, it's important to instill fear in your opponents, to fight and to protect your team,"" said Mandzukic, who could make his debut against an Atalanta side that arrives in Milan unbeaten in nine league outings. Monaco v Marseille, Saturday 2000 GMT Marseille are reeling after two straight defeats followed a draw at lowly Dijon, a run that has shattered any fanciful Ligue 1 title dreams and cast considerable doubt over the future of coach Andre Villas-Boas. ""I am at the service of the board. I am not here to cause problems. If they decide that I am not up to it in terms of results, then it will be the time to leave. If a change is needed, I am at their service,"" Villas-Boas said following Wednesday's 1-0 home loss to Lens. Club president Jacques-Henri Eyraud blasted the players as ""not fit to wear the shirt"" in the wake of last weekend's defeat by bottom side Nimes. A trip to Niko Kovac's in-form Monaco could spell further trouble at the Velodrome. Schalke v Bayern Munich, Sunday 1430 GMT With their 30-match winless run finally over, Schalke will want no reminding of what happened when they met Bayern Munich on the opening day of the season -- a crushing 8-0 defeat setting the tone for a disastrous first half of the campaign. In 19-year-old US forward Matthew Hoppe, Schalke have found a ray of hope in their fight against relegation, but the Royal Blues are eight points from potential safety at the halfway stage. Bayern have clawed out tough wins over Freiburg and Augsburg in their two previous games to regain control atop the Bundesliga, sending a ""signal to the rest of the chasing pack"" their hunger remains strong despite a recent dip, says Manuel Neuer. Sporting v Braga, Saturday 1945 GMT Having sparred with their rivals off the pitch over the handling of Covid-19 cases, Sporting Lisbon got the better of Porto in Tuesday's semi-final thanks to two late goals from Cape Verde-born Jovane Cabral. A day later, Braga overcame their ""outrage"" at Benfica's efforts to seek a postponement of their tie, booking a place in the final in Leiria with a 2-1 victory over an opposing side hit by a raft of coronavirus infections. Sporting and Braga have combined to win each of the past three editions of the Portuguese League Cup, the former lifting the trophy in 2018 and 2019 before Braga defeated Porto in last year's final under current Sporting boss Ruben Amorim."
2,16/01/2021,00:01,Ben Yedder double edges Monaco past Montpellier,Captain Wissam Ben Yedder scored twice as Monaco avoided a late fightback in Friday's 3-2 win at Montpellier in Ligue 1.,"Kevin Volland and Ben Yedder netted within an hour before Elye Wahi and Andy Delort clawed Montpellier back into the game but the Principality outfit moved three points off Lille in third with the victory. ""We showed solidarity and intensity. We know at Montpellier it's always difficult to win,"" Ben Yedder's team-mate Djibril Sibide told Telefoot. ""To make the difference in the match we had to be focused from the first to the last minute,"" he added. The hosts made four changes from last weekend's draw at Nantes as captain Hilton was named on the bench. Wing-back Ruben Aguilar and defender Oliveira Silva came into the visitors' starting lineup as Caio Henrique and Gelson Martins dropped out from last Saturday's home win over Angers. Volland opened the scoring on 25 minutes after Ben Yedder was denied by the crossbar with an acrobatic overhead kick as the former Bayer Leverkusen forward volleyed home the rebound. Ben Yedder was on the scoresheet nine minutes later to claim his first goal in five matches as he headed in Henrique's cross from the left at the front post. The 30-year-old claimed his second of proceedings to take his season tally up to eight just after the hour mark. He converted from the spot after teenager Wahi had taken Volland out in the box. The 18-year-old made up for his error three minutes later by celebrating his second senior appearance with his maiden goal with a side-footed finish. Algeria forward Delort then cut the deficit to one after 69 minutes by beating Benjamin Lecomte with a flick of his left heel for his 10th of the season, only trailing Boulaye Dia and Kylian Mbappe. Despite their late efforts the home side were unable to find an equaliser and stay in eighth place to go six games without a win for the first time since 2016. On Saturday, Paris Saint-Germain will be without coach Mauricio Pochettino for the trip to Angers after he tested positive for Covid-19. Dijon's visit to Lorient on Sunday has been called off after a virus outbreak among the hosts. The postponement of Sunday's game is the first in Ligue 1 since Marseille's meeting with Nice on November 17 was shelved. Saint-Etienne's match with Strasbourg is also under threat after several players members of Les Verts' players and members of the management team contracted the illness"
3,20/12/2020,17:15,"Volland helps Monaco end losing streak, Rennes move level with Marseille",Germany striker Kevin Volland scored his sixth Ligue 1 goal as Monaco battled to a 1-0 win at bottom club Dijon on Sunday to snap a three-match losing streak.,"Successive defeats by Lille, Marseille and Lens had seen Monaco slip nine points behind previous leaders Lille heading into the weekend. Their win on Sunday moved the seventh-placed principality club within seven points of current leaders Lyon, although Lille and Paris Saint-Germain will both be eyeing top spot when they meet later in the day. Former Bayer Leverkusen forward Volland slotted in the only goal on 15 minutes, with both sides seeing later efforts ruled out by VAR. ""After four straight wins and then three defeats on the bounce, the most important thing was to win,"" said coach Niko Kovac. ""It was not the best Monaco but we showed lots of character and that's the best way to move forward."" Rennes are two points ahead Monaco in fifth after strolling to a 3-0 win at Lorient, who sit second-from-bottom after their 11th defeat of the season. Damien Da Silva opened the scoring with a deflected close-range effort midway through the first half, and Benjamin Bourigeaud doubled the away side's lead with a fine first-time strike with 20 minutes remaining. Martin Terrier completed the scoring six minutes later when he cut in from the left before curling home past Paul Nardi. Rennes are level with Marseille on 28 points, five behind Lyon, although they have played two games more than the team from the south coast. One point ahead of Lorient in 18th place are Nimes, who came away from Saint-Etienne with a 2-2 draw. Elsewhere, Montpellier missed the chance to move into fourth as they were held to a 2-2 draw a"
4,12/12/2020,19:38,Marseille start fast to beat Monaco and rise to second,Marseille climbed to second in Ligue 1 on Saturday after scoring twice in the first 13 minutes and resisting late pressure to beat Monaco 2-1.,"Marseille slumped out of Europe on Wednesday after a disastrous Champions League campaign but this was their sixth straight Ligue 1 victory. With coach Andre Villas-Boas absent, suspended after receiving a red card on the bench in the game against Nimes last Friday, Marseille pounced on two early turnovers by Monaco. After Monaco gave the ball away on the edge of their box in the fifth minute, Dario Benedetto burst down the left edge of the penalty area and chipped the ball to the far post where Florian Thauvin headed in. Eight minutes later, after Marseille won the ball back in the Monaco half, Thauvin returned the favour. He swung in a left-foot cross from the right which Argentine Benedetto, running in unmarked, volleyed home. As Monaco pressed in the second half, Thauvin dropped into his own penalty and conceded a 78th minute penalty with a dangerous high challenge on Wissam Ben Yedder. Ben Yedder sent Steve Mandanda the wrong way from the spot kick, but the Marseille goalkeeper dealt serenely with Monaco's desperate attempts in the closing minutes. Marseille leapfrogged Lille and Lyon to move into second, one-point behind Paris Saint-Germain. On Sunday, PSG entertain Lyon after Lille host Bordeaux, but Marseille will end the weekend with two games in hand on all three."
5,21/11/2020,00:05,Monaco come back to stun PSG after Mbappe double,Cesc Fabregas scored a late winner from the penalty spot as Monaco came from two goals down to stun reigning champions Paris Saint-Germain 3-2 in Ligue 1 on Friday.,"Kylian Mbappe had netted a first-half brace, including a penalty, against his former side, taking him to 99 goals for PSG and leaving his current team seemingly on course for a ninth consecutive league win. But German international Kevin Volland struck twice for Monaco after the break and Fabregas converted from 12 yards in the 84th minute after Abdou Diallo had been sent off for conceding the all-important penalty. PSG remain clear at the top of Ligue 1, but this result is a major setback for Thomas Tuchel's team before a crucial Champions League tie against RB Leipzig next week. ""I am more surprised than I am angry,"" said Tuchel, who was also disappointed to see further first-half goals for Mbappe and Moise Kean disallowed. ""I saw two totally different halves. First of all we completely controlled the game...and then the second half was completely different. I can only say it is our responsibility."" Niko Kovac's Monaco climb up to second in the table, four points behind PSG, but Lille can reclaim second spot and move to within two points of the leaders if they beat Lorient on Sunday. ""If you come back from two down to win 3-2 it is for sure something special, but I don't want to glorify it too much,"" said ex-Bayern Munich coach Kovac. ""We cannot stop and say everything is done. It was a big victory but nothing more."" PSG have been severely handicapped by injuries and suspensions this season, and Neymar was only deemed fit enough for a place on the bench at kick-off at the Stade Louis II after missing Brazil's World Cup qualifiers over the last week due to fitness problems. Mbappe was back in the starting line-up, however, after missing his club's last two outings prior to the international break with a hamstring injury. Facing his former club, with whom he won the Ligue 1 title in 2017, Mbappe burst through to put Paris in front in the 25th minute after being released by Angel Di Maria. He then found the net again in the 37th minute, converting a penalty awarded for a foul on Rafinha by Youssouf Fofana. His ninth goal of the season leaves him just one away from a century of goals in a PSG shirt since his arrival from Monaco at the start of 2017/18 in a 180 million-euro ($213m) deal. He even had another goal disallowed just before half-time. Without their French international striker Wissam Ben Yedder after he tested positive for coronavirus, it was a long way back for Monaco but they reduced the deficit seven minutes after half-time when Gelson Martins set up Volland to score from close in. Volland then equalised with a tap-in after Fabregas, on as a substitute, had beaten goalkeeper Keylor Navas to a cross. Worse was to come for the visitors, as Diallo -- another former Monaco player -- clumsily conceded a penalty and was shown a red card after the referee opted to review the images. Fabregas made no mistake from the spot, as PSG lost a Ligue 1 game after leading by two goals for just the second time since the Qatari takeover of the club in 2011. Earlier Rennes warmed up for their Champions League rematch with Chelsea in the worst possible fashion, going down to a 1-0 home defeat at the hands of Bordeaux. Hatem Ben Arfa scored the only goal of the game against his old club, as Rennes slip to fifth before entertaining Chelsea in a game they realistically need to win to keep any hopes of reaching the Champions League last 16 alive."
6,20/11/2020,03:10,"Huge tests for Real, Barca, a milestone for Flick - what to watch in Europe this weekend","Real Madrid and Barcelona's stuttering starts to the season could continue, while AC Milan's unbeaten record in Serie A is in danger and Bayern Munich coach Hansi Flick is aiming to continue his astonishing record.","AFP Sport previews the standout football action on the continent this weekend: Monaco v Paris Saint-Germain, Friday 2000 GMT PSG are five points clear at the top of Ligue 1 and chasing a ninth straight win when they face Monaco, the only other club to have won the title in the past eight seasons. Paris have won 4-1 and 4-0 on their last two visits to the principality but they might find things harder this time, not least because coach Thomas Tuchel is without a host of injured players, while Neymar is a doubt. The game has a German accent to it, with Monaco looking to return to the upper echelons of the French game under new Croatian coach Niko Kovac, who was born and raised in Germany. Ex-Borussia Dortmund boss Tuchel has been full of praise ahead of the game for Kovac, who he came up against when the latter was at Eintracht Frankfurt. Kovac is looking to relaunch his career after being sacked by Bayern Munich. Bayern Munich v Werder Bremen, Saturday 1430 GMT Kovac was replaced in the dugout in Bavaria by Hansi Flick, who went on to win the Champions League, Bundesliga and German Cup treble last season and has added the UEFA and German Super Cups this season. On Saturday Flick takes charge of Bayern for the 50th time when they host Werder Bremen. Flick's record is astonishing. He has overseen 45 wins, one draw and just three defeats, with Bayern averaging 3.3 goals a game in the Bundesliga. Bayern sealed the title with a 1-0 win in Bremen in June. Werder only just stayed up last season and lost 6-1 on their last trip to Munich. A similar outcome is quite possible this time. Villarreal v Real Madrid, Saturday 1515 GMT Zinedine Zidane's Real have had two weeks to stew on a 4-1 hammering at Valencia and could find the going tough again this weekend when they make another trip to Spain's east coast to play Villarreal. Unai Emery's side are undefeated in six La Liga games and are second in the table, two points behind leaders Real Sociedad and two above Real, who have a game in hand. While Madrid are without talisman Sergio Ramos after he suffered a hamstring injury playing for Spain, Villarreal have two of Spain's most in-form strikers in Paco Alcacer and Gerard Moreno. The latter has four league goals this season and scored a late equaliser for Spain against Switzerland in the Nations League last weekend, while Alcacer has nine in total. They could make life very difficult for the champions. Atletico Madrid v Barcelona, Saturday 2000 GMT Barcelona claimed a first win in five La Liga games last time out when they thumped Real Betis 5-2, but they are currently eighth in the table, nine points behind Real Sociedad with two matches in hand. On Saturday they visit Atletico, who are six points above Ronald Koeman's side and on a club-record unbeaten run of 23 league matches. Luis Suarez's absence against his former side after a positive coronavirus test is a great shame, as will be the lack of fans, but this match still pits Lionel Messi against Joao Felix, and there is the return of Antoine Griezmann to face his old team. Napoli v AC Milan, Sunday 1945 GMT Milan's revival is real, as they spent the international break on top of Serie A, unbeaten and two points ahead of Sassuolo in second. A huge test awaits, however, as they go to Napoli, who are three points off the lead in third. Napoli have lost their last two home games but look like contenders for a top-four finish this season and the prospect of coach Gennaro Gattuso getting one over the club he served with such distinction as a player is a fascinating one."
7,12/11/2020,23:41,France's Ben Yedder tests positive for coronavirus,"Monaco forward Wissam Ben Yedder has tested positive for coronavirus and will miss France's Nations League games against Portugal and Sweden, the French Football Federation announced on Thursday.","The FFF said Ben Yedder had tested positive earlier in the day, did not participate in training at the Stade de France and would go into self-isolation. He started Wednesday's 2-0 friendy defeat by Finland. Several French players have contracted Covid-19 in recent months, including Paul Pogba, Steve Mandanda, Houssem Aouar, Leo Dubois and Kylian Mbappe. The World Cup holders, who trail Portugal in Group A3 on goal difference, take on the European champions in Lisbon on Saturday before hosting Sweden in their final group game three days later."
8,01/11/2020,19:14,Volland off the mark as Monaco thump Bordeaux,Germany international Kevin Volland scored his first goals for Monaco since joining the club in September as Niko Kovac's side thrashed Bordeaux 4-0 in Ligue 1 on Sunday.,"Monaco struck three times in as many minutes through Wissam Ben Yedder, Gelson Martins and Volland in the first half to take control at the Stade Louis II. Volland then grabbed another in the second half as Monaco won for just the second time in six matches to climb up to seventh place. France forward Ben Yedder crashed home a spot-kick on 27 minutes after his header was handled by Pablo, with a penalty awarded despite the ball looping over Benoit Costil and into the net following the deflection. Martins grabbed his first goal since serving a six-month ban for pushing a referee last season when he lunged at the far post to poke in a Ruben Aguilar cross. And former Bayer Leverkusen forward Volland promptly headed in from a Ben Yedder delivery to end his drought following his 11 million-euro ($13 million) move from Germany. The 28-year-old tapped in a second on 57 minutes as Martins slid the ball across goal for his unmarked team-mate. Nice moved up to fourth as Patrick Vieira's team extended their unbeaten domestic run to five games with a 3-0 victory at Angers. Rony Lopes put Nice ahead on 11 minutes and Pierre Lees-Melou added a second from the spot. Hicham Boudaoui came off the bench to net a third as Nice stayed four points behind leaders Paris Saint-Germain. Metz continued their fine recent form with a 1-0 win at Nimes while Montpellier defeated Saint-Etienne by the same scoreline courtesy of a goal from Englishman Stephy Mavididi. Reims beat Strasbourg 2-1 while Dijon remain the only team without a victory following a goalless draw at home to Lorient. Lille put their undefeated record on the line in Sunday's late game when they host a resurgent Lyon. Christophe Galtier's Lille have won five and drawn three of their opening eight games. They could go back level on points with PSG at the top with victory."
9,23/10/2020,03:58,"Clasico, Dortmund v Schalke - what to look out for in Europe this weekend","Two of the biggest rivalries in world football will dominate the weekend's action in Europe, with the first Clasico of the season being followed by the Ruhr derby between Borussia Dortmund and Schalke on Saturday.","AFP Sport previews the standout action on the continent this weekend: Barcelona v Real Madrid, Saturday 1400 GMT Once the undisputed greatest fixture in world football, the Clasico has lost much of its lustre. Cristiano Ronaldo, Neymar and Andres Iniesta were among the superstars to move on from Real Madrid and Barcelona in recent years, and this year Gareth Bale and Luis Suarez departed too. Lionel Messi would have left as well, had Barcelona let him. Usually there would be 99,000 fans packed into the Camp Nou. This time, because of the coronavirus pandemic, there will be none. The huge global audience will remain, but it's a long time since these teams have been at such a collective low ebb. Barca are struggling to get back on their feet under new coach Ronald Koeman and lost 1-0 at Getafe last weekend. Real won La Liga last season but the last week gives a more accurate picture of where they stand: Zinedine Zidane's team lost 1-0 at home to Cadiz and then went down 3-2 to Shakhtar Donetsk in the Champions League. Madrid have lost just once in their last seven visits to the Camp Nou though. Borussia Dortmund v Schalke, Saturday 1630 GMT Another great fixture usually played before a huge crowd, only 300 fans will be allowed in to see Dortmund host Schalke, rather than the usual 80,000. These sides are fierce rivals and tensions are running extra high after Dortmund prodigy Youssoufa Moukoko, 15, received alleged death threats and racist abuse from Schalke fans after scoring a hat-trick in last Sunday's 3-2 win in an Under-19 derby. Dortmund, with Erling Braut Haaland leading the line, will be favourites to get the better of a struggling Schalke who lost 4-0 on their last visit in May. Schalke sacked coach David Wagner after their poor start this season followed a long winless run at the end of the last campaign. Manuel Baum has replaced him and got his first point last weekend against Union Berlin. Dortmund's 1-0 victory at Hoffenheim last weekend made it three wins out of four in the Bundesliga this season, but Lucien Favre's side lost 3-1 at Lazio in the Champions League in midweek. Atletico Madrid v Real Betis, Saturday 1900 GMT Atletico are hoping to take advantage of the struggles of Real Madrid and Barcelona to win a first La Liga title since 2014. The signing of Luis Suarez from Barcelona underlined their ambition, but they head into Saturday's home meeting with Betis on the rebound from their joint-worst defeat in Diego Simeone's nine years as coach in Wednesday's 4-0 loss at Bayern Munich. Manuel Pellegrini's Betis have been inconsistent so far but, with the likes of Nabil Fekir, Sergio Canales and the evergreen Joaquin, should not be underestimated. Lyon v Monaco, Sunday 2000 GMT Lyon and Monaco have been Champions League semi-finalists in recent seasons but are not in Europe at all in this campaign, so each is desperate to get back to the promised land. Lyon have started poorly in Ligue 1 with just two wins in seven but have kept hold of star men Memphis Depay and Houssem Aouar. Monaco have been inconsistent too under new coach Niko Kovac but in Wissam Ben Yedder they have one of Europe's most lethal marksmen. AC Milan v Roma, Monday 1945 GMT Milan put their perfect start to the Serie A campaign on the line when they welcome Roma to San Siro on Monday. The Rossoneri have won four out of four so far in the league with Zlatan Ibrahimovic in fine form, but Roma have some useful veterans of their own in attack in Edin Dzeko and Pedro and are also slowly building form."
10,30/09/2020,22:29,Monaco loan Senegal forward Balde to Sampdoria,"Monaco's Senegal striker Keita Balde has joined Serie A club Sampdoria on loan from Monaco with an option to buy, both clubs confirmed on Wednesday.","The 25-year-old, who tested positive for coronavirus during his medical this week in Genoa, has signed a deal with an option to make the move permanent until June 2025. ""President Massimo Ferrero and U.C. Sampdoria are pleased to announce that Keita Balde has joined the club from AS Monaco on loan with an option to make the move permanent,"" the Italian side said. ""The Senegal forward, born in Arbucies, Spain on 8 March 1995, has signed a contract with Sampdoria running until 30 June 2025,"" they added. Balde joined Monaco from Lazio in 2017 for 30 million euros ($35 million), and had already been loaned to Inter Milan during the 2018-2019 season. Inter however did not take up an option to purchase the player for 25 million euros. Balde played 60 times for Monaco, including six in the Champions League and scored 16 goals over two seasons. His contract with the Ligue 1 side had been due to run until June 2022. He becomes the 36th player to leave the Principality side this summer."
11,12/09/2020,01:01,Monaco sell Mali's Adama Traore to Turkish outfit Hatayspor,"Malian international midfielder Adama Traore has moved to Turkish Super Lig side Hatayspor, Monaco announced on Friday.","The Ligue 1 side, who have now seen 31 players leave in the summer window, did not offer details of the transfer. The 25-year-old arrived at Monaco in 2015 not long after winning the Golden Ball for best player in that year's Under-20 World Cup in New Zealand. However he then suffered a serious ankle injury and was subsequently loaned out to Rio Ave in Portugal, Cercle Brugge and Monaco's fellow Ligue 1 side Metz. Traore played only 27 times for in his five years as a player for the principalty club."
12,02/09/2020,11:18,Germany striker Volland swaps Leverkusen for Monaco,"Germany striker Kevin Volland has left Bayer Leverkusen to sign a four-year contract with AS Monaco, the French Ligue 1 side announced on Wednesday, in a deal worth around 11 million euros ($13 million).","As Leverkusen coach Peter Bosz hinted on Monday, the 28-year-old leaves the club after scoring 50 goals, creating 32 more, in 148 appearances over four years for the Bundesliga side. This is the first time Volland has joined a club outside Germany. He will link up with Monaco's new German-born head coach Niko Kovac, the former Croatian international who was sacked by Bayern Munich last November, but earned his first Ligue 1 victory on Sunday with a 1-0 win over Metz. Volland has also made 10 appearances for Germany, scoring a goal in the 8-0 drubbing of minnows San Marino in 2016. ""His profile is that of a versatile striker, capable of playing up front, as a second striker or a winger on both sides,"" Monaco's sporting director Paul Mitchell told the club's website. ""He is a player who works hard for the team with statistics that illustrate his goalscoring skills."" According to a club source, the transfer fee is 11 million euros with various added bonuses. Volland, formerly of Hoffenheim, is Monaco's second major signing of the transfer window after the arrival of promising centre-back Axel Disasi from Reims. Leverkusen sporting director Simon Rolfes praised Volland's ""exemplary commitment"" over the last four years and said the striker leaves with the German club's blessing. Leverkusen are also poised to lose Germany playmaker Kai Havertz, 21, who is expected to join Chelsea in the coming days in a transfer deal estimated to be worth 100 million euros."
13,21/07/2020,20:32,New boss Kovac wants Monaco to 'top the bill' again,Newly-appointed Monaco coach Niko Kovac said on Tuesday he wants to guide the club back to the top table of European football.,"Former Bayern Munich and Croatia boss Kovac replaced the sacked Robert Moreno at the weekend. The principality side finished in ninth place after the Ligue 1 was campaign was declared over due to the coronavirus pandemic and will miss out on next term's Champions League. ""Monaco must play at the international level and get back to topping the bill. You know what that means,"" the 48-year-old said as he was presented to the media. Kovac will work under vice-president Oleg Petrov and sporting director Paul Mitchell who arrived last month. The club have sold the likes of Kylian Mbappe, Benjamin Mendy and Bernardo Silva for substantial fees since they last won the Ligue 1 title in 2017, and finished two points above the relegation zone last season. ""Paul and Oleg told me they would do what's needed to have a strong team. I believe them. It's the reason I signed for Monaco,"" Kovac said. ""I trust them and I believe in this club. I want to thank president Dmitry Rybolovlev. They have all trusted me. I wish to give something back. I'm going to work tirelessly to do the most and reach our goals,"" he added. Earlier in the day, Petrov said bringing Kovac in underlines their ambition. Kovac was sacked by Bayern last November after leading them to a domestic double in his first season in charge. ""It's a strong choice that shows our desire and ambition to do as much as possible to reach our goal: to make Monaco a successful club,"" Petrov said. ""It's a significant, assumed change aligned with the strategy of the squad. To re-inforce our ability, to sustainably build to reach our long-term objectives,"" the Russian added. Mitchell was technical director for Red Bull's stable of clubs including Kovac's former side Salzburg. ""Since my arrival we analysed and exchanged in objective and subjective ways. The decision was made to change. We quickly thought about Niko. We had never met but we had a lot of contact in common, in Germany, or at Red Bull,"" Mitchell said. Kovac's first game in charge is Wednesday's pre-season friendly at Standard Liege before a week-long camp in Poland."
14,19/07/2020,21:50,Monaco appoint ex Bayern boss Kovac as new manager,"Monaco appointed Niko Kovac as their new manager on Sunday, the former Bayern Munich boss succeeding Robert Moreno, the Ligue 1 club announced.","The 48-year-old former Croatia international has signed a three-year contract with the option of a further year as the under-performing French side act to improve their fortunes. Kovac was available after his sacking by Bayern in November, months after leading the Bundesliga giants to a league and cup double. ""Niko Kovac will take charge of his first training session on Monday,"" the club confirmed. Ex-Spain coach Moreno, 42, was let go by Monaco on Saturday after barely six months in the job. He had been appointed in December after Leonardo Jardim was dismissed by Monaco for the second time in just over a year. Monaco finished ninth in Ligue 1 this past season, failing to qualify for European football as the 2019-20 campaign was suspended in March and then declared over due to the coronavirus pandemic."
15,18/07/2020,13:57,"Monaco sack Moreno, set to hire Kovac: source","Monaco have sacked coach Robert Moreno and are preparing to hire former Bayern Munich boss Niko Kovac, a source close to the Ligue 1 club told AFP on Saturday.","According to the source Spaniard Moreno, 42, has been relieved of his duties at the principality club only a few months after replacing Leonardo Jardim in December. He led the club to ninth in Ligue 1, failing to qualify for European football as the 2019-20 season was suspended and then ended due to the coronavirus pandemic. His last match in charge at Monaco was a 2-1 defeat at Brest, and he failed to win any of his side's final three games before the campaign was halted in early March. Kovac, who according to the source will replace Moreno, is a free agent after himself being sacked by Bayern last season and replaced by Hansi Flick, who led the Bavarian giants to an eighth straight Bundesliga title. Moreno was in the dugout for Monaco for Friday's 2-0 friendly win at Cercle Bruges and took charge of Saturday's training session before being informed of his and his staff's dismissals."
16,08/07/2020,19:35,Monaco loan German defender Henrichs to Leipzig,"German international Benjamin Henrichs has joined RB Leipzig on loan for next season from Monaco with an option to buy, the principality club announced on Wednesday.","The 23-year-old full-back, who last played for Germany at the 2017 Confederations Cup, signed for Monaco from Bayer Leverkusen in 2018 for a reported 20 million euros ($22.6 million). Leipzig could reportedly make the deal permanent at the end of the 2020/21 campaign for 15 million euros. Henrichs failed to impose himself in Ligue 1, making just 44 appearances in all competitions for Monaco, scoring once."
17,16/01/2020,01:06,"Mbappe returns to haunt Monaco, hits 20th goal of season",Kylian Mbappe scored twice to take his season tally to 20 as the French World Cup winner shone in Paris Saint-Germain's 4-1 rout of his former club Monaco on Wednesday.,"The victory kept PSG eight points clear at the top. They also registered their 50th goal of the league campaign from 20 matches. Monaco came away from PSG with a point in a thrilling 3-3 draw in the capital last weekend but they posed no similar threat just three days later. Mbappe was on target in the 24th and 90th minutes with Neymar tucking away a penalty in first-half stoppage time. Pablo Sarabia added another in the 73rd minute, just seconds after coming on as a substitute. Ibrahima Bakayoko grabbed a late consolation for Monaco, beating the impressive Kaylor Navas in goal. ""In every area, we were better than Sunday,"" said PSG coach Thomas Tuchel. ""It's a deserved victory, we had lots of possession."" Tuchel fielded his 'Fab Four' attacking stars in Mbappe, Neymar, Mauro Icardi and Angel Di Maria. It was a decision which paid dividends when Di Maria floated over a cross for Mbappe to score the opener. Monaco goalkeeper Benjamin Lecomte denied Mbappe on two further occasions in the first half. Neymar made it 2-0 from the penalty spot in injury-time after Kamil Glik had fouled Layvin Kurzawa. Sarabia's goal was set-up by fellow substitute Marco Verratti before Mbappe completed the rout of the club he had joined in 2015. ""With our four attackers, we can carry out our plan,"" added Tuchel. ""For Icardi, it wasn't a negative game. It's a good mix. ""Kylian and Neymar carry the ball a lot, Mauro is used to working with us, for the team, to open spaces. ""He hasn't scored in two matches, but he works. There are no doubts over him. He added: ""The objective was to win the game, take the three points to improve our position. ""We have the best players but I also want to have the best team in each match."" For Monaco coach Robert Moreno, the defeat was a sobering experience coming after Sunday's encouraging draw in the French capital. ""I am very happy and proud of my team,"" said Moreno after his first home game in charge saw Monaco's six-match win streak at Stade Louis II end. ""It's a different result to Sunday but tonight we conceded three goals on the counter-attack and a penalty. ""At 3-1, we took risks but had we scored a second then the mental situation would have changed and the last few minutes would have been interesting."" Rennes are third in the table, five points behind Marseille and 13 off PSG after a 1-0 win over Nimes. Adrien Hunou scored the winner in the 64th minute to ensure a sixth win in the last seven games. Nimes are second bottom, three points behind Amiens who drew 1-1 at home to Reims."
18,12/01/2020,23:57,Neymar shines but PSG held by Monaco in thriller,Neymar scored twice and created another goal but leaders Paris Saint-Germain were held to an entertaining 3-3 draw at home on Sunday by a Monaco side playing their first Ligue 1 game under new coach Robert Moreno.,"The Brazilian gave PSG the lead after just two minutes at the Parc des Princes but Monaco scored two quick goals through Gelson Martins and Wissam Ben Yedder to move 2-1 ahead inside quarter of an hour. A Fode Ballo-Toure own goal brought PSG level and Neymar restored their advantage from the penalty spot before half-time after a foul on Kylian Mbappe. But Monaco, who also host PSG on Wednesday in a rearranged fixture, earned a point when Islam Slimani's goal was controversially awarded after it was initially ruled out for offside. ""We didn't put in our best performance but we tried. It was a good test. Monaco have a good team but we are superior and we must show it on the pitch,"" Neymar told Canal+. ""If we had played at our best we would have taken the three points. ""I think on the third goal, the fact our defender touched the ball wasn't intentional but the decision falls to the referee. They have VAR for that, we can't complain. We weren't perfect tonight either."" It was just the second time PSG have dropped points at home this season -- after a shock 2-0 defeat by Reims in September -- but the draw represented a positive start for former Spain coach Moreno, who replaced Leonardo Jardim at the end of December. ""We should be very happy. I'm very pleased with my players and I want to congratulate them for a great match,"" said Moreno. ""We played to our strengths on the counter-attack. We think we can beat any team and that's what I tell my players. That's our philosophy."" PSG had started the new year in rampant form by scoring six both times in a pair of domestic cup wins and looked on track for a 10th win in a row over Monaco after Neymar controlled a terrific Marco Verratti pass to smash home the opener. Thomas Tuchel's side came in riding an eight-match winning streak -- across which they had scored 34 goals -- but concerns remained over the deployment of a prolific four-man attack against stronger opposition. Monaco hit back almost immediately as Cesc Fabregas threaded a neat ball through for Ben Yedder and although he was chopped down by Keylor Navas, the rebound rolled into the path of Martins who tapped into an empty net. The visitors soon exposed PSG again, this time Keita Balde ran at the defence before slipping across to Ben Yedder who applied a composed finish for his league-best 14th goal. The Monaco duo almost combined to devastating effect once more on the counter, with Navas producing a fine save with his legs to thwart Senegalese forward Balde. PSG equalised moments later when Neymar received the ball in the box and his snapshot took a couple of deflections -- the latter coming off Ballo-Toure for an own goal. Kamil Glik headed against the post on the half-hour but PSG regained the lead on 41 minutes, Neymar converting a spot-kick after Mbappe was brought down by Martins. Aleksandr Golovin missed an excellent chance to level before the break while Neymar was denied a hat-trick by a sharp reflex stop from Benjamin Lecomte early in the second half. Monaco made it 3-3 with 20 minutes to go with the help of the video assistant referee system. The linesman raised his flag as Slimani forced in from close range but replays showed Marquinhos had knocked the ball towards the Algerian, albeit inadvertently, prompting the original offside decision to be overturned. Mbappe could have won it at the death but sliced wide on the volley as PSG drew for the first time this season in the league. Lille's miserable away form continued as they lost 1-0 at Dijon, who played for over an hour with 10 men after the dismissal of Hamza Mendyl. Julio Tavares scored the winning goal on 47 minutes as Dijon pulled four points clear of the relegation places while Lille blew the chance to return to the top three. Lille are unbeaten at home but have won just once in 10 outings on the road while losing on seven occasions."
19,05/01/2020,16:14,Monaco send Nigerian striker Onyekuru on loan to Galatasaray,"Monaco's exciting young Nigerian striker Henry Onyekuru is to spend the rest of the season on loan at Galatasaray, the Ligue 1 club announced on Sunday.","It will be the 22-year-old's second loan spell in Turkey as he shone for Galatasaray last season when he was still at English club Everton. He scored 14 goals in 35 appearances for Galatasaray who went on to win the Turkish championship. Monaco, who signed the Nigerian for 17 million euros during the summer, have not included an 'option to buy' clause in the loan, suggesting that Onyekuru remains a part of their long-term strategy. Since his arrival in the principality, Onyekuru, who joined Monaco on a five-year deal, figured in just four matches under Leonardo Jardim who was sacked just after Christmas and replaced by ex-Spain boss Roberto Moreno. He hasn't played in Ligue 1 since September 29."
20,30/12/2019,22:10,Moreno happy to be 'number one' at Monaco,"Robert Moreno was unveiled as the new coach of Monaco on Monday, admitting his bitter bust-up with Spain boss Luis Enrique had paved the way for him to become ""number one"".","Moreno, 42, takes over at 2004 European and 2017 French champions Monaco after Leonardo Jardim was sacked for the second time. However, he arrives at the Ligue 1 outfit having been accused of ""disloyalty"" by Enrique. Moreno was previously Spain assistant coach but was promoted to the top job after Enrique resigned to take care of his nine-year-old daughter Xana, who died in August of cancer. ""I had nine extraordinary years at his side,"" said Moreno on Monday. ""But that is all in the past. Today is my presentation as Monaco coach. I have coached since I was 14 and obtained my UEFA licence at 25. ""I always wanted to become the number one. This is the start of that stage,"" added Moreno who guided Spain through qualifying for Euro 2020 in the absence of Enrique. He arrives at the Russian-backed principality club with the team in seventh place in Ligue 1 and 17 points behind leaders and defending champions PSG. Jardim, who took Monaco to the league title in 2017, was fired at the weekend, just over a year since he was previously sent packing. Moreno said he had been considering a range of offers since his acrimonious November departure from the Spanish national team. ""The Monaco project had the best guarantees and conditions,"" he said after signing a deal until June 2022. ""I knew that I wanted to work at a high level and I wanted a project that matched this desire. Coming here means growing as a coach and a person."""
21,28/12/2019,19:27,"Monaco fire coach Leonardo Jardim, again","Leonardo Jardim has been fired by Monaco just over a year since he was previously sent packing, a source close to the club told AFP on Saturday.","To general surprise the 45-year-old was reappointed in January, just three months after he was sacked and replaced by Thierry Henry, who oversaw a disastrous tenure. French sports newspaper L'Equipe are reporting Jardim will be replaced by the Spaniard Marcelino, who led Valencia to the Spanish Cup before getting fired for rowing with the club's owners in September. Other sources are suggesting former Spain coach Robert Moreno is also in the frame. Jardim found himself again facing mounting scrutiny in his second spell after a humbling home defeat by Lille in the French League Cup in mid-December. In their next match however Monaco thrashed the same opposition 5-1 in the league. The Portuguese originally landed himself in the spotlight in September as Monaco picked up just three points from their opening six games despite a summer outlay of 135 million euros ($150 million). Five wins in six helped douse the flames but the abject display against Lille stoked fresh concerns about the direction the club, currently in seventh in Ligue 1, was heading. In happier days Jardim led Monaco to the French title and a Champions League semi-final in 2017, before the club's Russian owners cashed in. They sold Kylian Mbappe to Paris Saint-Germain, Tiemoue Bakayoko to Chelsea, Bernardo Silva and Benjamin Mendy to Manchester City, Fabinho to Liverpool, Thomas Lemar to Atletico Madrid, Djibril Sidibe to Everton and Falcao to Galatasaray."
22,03/12/2019,15:16,PSG's storm-hit trip to Monaco reset for January 15,"Paris Saint-Germain's trip to Monaco, which was postponed at the weekend following deadly storms which battered southern France, has been rescheduled for January 15 -- three days after the pair clash in the French capital.","The decision, announced by the French football league (LFP) on Wednesday, means the two clubs will face off in the Principality in a midweek evening clash sandwiched between Ligue 1's 20th matchday and the last 32 of the French Cup. The match was postponed amid hazardous weather conditions in southeastern France, where 12 people have now been killed following two successive late autumn storms that brought torrential rain, heavy flooding and high winds. On Monday officials revealed that three people were swept to their deaths by floodwaters and three emergency workers were killed when their helicopter crashed while seeking to rescue victims, all in the Var region. Champions PSG are five points clear of Marseille with Monaco in 14th, just three points clear of the relegation zone."
23,01/12/2019,14:09,PSG's game at Monaco falls victim to storm alert,Paris Saint-Germain's Ligue 1 match at Monaco on Sunday evening has been called off due to forecast heavy storms.,"The fixture ""will be postponed to a later date"" Monaco announced. That could be problematic. PSG, who are in the Champions League, are scheduled to play twice a week until the French mid-season break between December 21 and January 11. A spokesman for PSG said the squad, which was already in the south of France, would fly back from Nice at around 16.00 local time. A thousand Parisian supporters had been expected in the Principality and PSG tweeted that it would send them ""an email with the terms of exchange or refund."" Both clubs are scheduled to play on Wednesday, with PSG at home to Nantes and Monaco at Toulouse. On Sunday morning, two French regions, including Alpes-Maritimes which surrounds the principality, were placed on red alert for floods by Meteo France, the French weather service. It said the area faces what it called a ""marked Mediterranean episode"" of intense storms. Rainfall could total as much as 200mm (almost eight inches) over the weekend, Meteo France said. It said that it expected coastal areas to be the most affected, with ""very significant risks of runoff and overflow from coastal rivers."" PSG are five points clear of Marseille with Monaco in 14th, just three points clear of the relegation zone. As for Sunday's lost fixture, the ""Professional Football League Competitions Committee will later set the date of the match"" the league said in a statement. In Alpes-Maritimes and the neighbouring Var region 148 municipalities were declared disaster areas on Saturday after the damage caused by a previous Mediterranean episode last weekend, which resulted in the death of six people in the Var."

In Toulouse, the home team were reduced to 10 men when right back Steven Moreira drove his studs into Bouna Sarr's knee and received a red card after a video review. Marseille dominated a scruffy match but struggled to break down Toulouse. The home team defended in depth and even had a chance to take the lead in the 70th minute but goalkeeper Steve Mandanda saved Ibrahim Sangare's header with his foot. Marseille responded with a decisive moment of inspiration in the 76th minute. Dimitri Payet drew defenders then threaded a clever reverse pass to the darting Dario Benedetto who danced past Baptiste Reynet and coolly slid the ball into the goal. Three minutes later, Toulouse presented Marseille with a second. Left-back Issiaga Sylla drove a clearance into Valere Germain. The ball bounced to Nemanja Radonjic, who advanced into the penalty area and curled a shot into the net. ""We played a good game and the victory is deserved,"" said Marseille coach Andre Villas-Boas. Toulouse ""closed up the game after the red card,"" said Villas-Boas. ""Don't forget Mandanda's decisive save before we opened the scoring. We knew that the first goal would be very important. ""We keep our second place and we have to keep going like this."" Marseille climbed to 25 points from 14 matches, eight behind leaders Paris Saint-Germain but one ahead of Angers. Bordeaux and Saint-Etienne are fourth and fifth on 22. Toulouse remain second from bottom. Depleted Bordeaux, already deprived of defenders Mexer and Vukasin Jovanovic who were both suspended, midfielder Youssef Ait Bennasser, who could not play because he is on-loan from Monaco, lost centre-back Laurent Koscielny to injury on Sunday morning and winger Jimmy Briand during the warm-up. Monaco, who had climbed away from the relegation zone with three victories in their previous four league games, took the lead against Bordeaux with a goal by Islam Slimani on 15 minutes. After that, even though the hosts' fans fell silent in the first half as part of a protest against their owners, the visitors failed to exploit the makeshift home defence. Instead, Brazilian Pablo levelled with a powerful header from a corner after 29 minutes. In the 67th minute, Slimani handled while standing in the wall at a free kick, conceding a penalty and incurring his second yellow card. Nicolas de Preville converted the spot-kick to give Bordeaux victory. ""There were a lot of players from the starting XI who were not here,"" Bordeaux midfielder Aurelien Tchouameni said. ""This shows the strength of character of our team. Some of them didn't have much playing time this season. They stood up."" Later on Sunday, Saint-Etienne drew 0-0 at home against Montpellier as the sides managed just two shots on target."
25,30/10/2019,23:37,Monaco pile on misery for Marseille with League Cup win,"Marseille's season suffered another setback Wednesday when they were knocked out of the French League Cup 2-1 at the hands of Monaco, just days after they endured a 4-0 defeat by PSG in Ligue 1.","With just one win in their last seven matches, the pressure is on coach Andre Villas-Boas with a cup exit compounding Marseille's modest seventh position in the league table which sees them already 11 points behind champions PSG in the title race. Despite making seven changes from the side which started the 1-0 win over Nantes last weekend, Monaco coach Leonardo Jardim still had enough firepower to see off Marseille. Both Monaco's goals came in the first half. On-loan striker Jean-Kevin Augustin opened the scoring in the 25th minute from a cross from Ruben Aguilar. Aguilar added the second goal five minutes from the interval. Marseille grabbed a consolation in the 77th minute when Benjamin Lecomte put through his own goal. There will be no let up for Marseille this weekend when they welcome third-placed Lille to the Stade Velodrome."
26,20/10/2019,20:57,Ben Yedder strikes late to give Monaco win over Rennes,Wissam Ben Yedder fired Monaco out of the Ligue 1 mire on Sunday with a stoppage time winner that earned an entertaining 3-2 win over Rennes.,"Yedder pounced on Keita Balde's flick two minutes into added time to lash home a powerful left-foot finish and send Leonardo Jardim's side up to 14th just as it looked as if a handball spotted by VAR had denied them the three points. Balde thought he had won the game for Monaco seconds before when he capitalised on a dreadful error by Rennes goalkeeper Romain Salin to roll the ball into an empty net, only for the video assistants to spot him controlling the ball with his hand. The last-gasp winner was Ben Yedder's eighth goal in as many league matches, putting him top of the Ligue 1 scoring charts and making fans forget Radamel Falcao's departure to Galatasaray. ""I'm very happy, it wasn't an easy match. We scored in the last seconds and it was a very good goal, so I'm very happy,"" said Ben Yedder. Monaco started the weekend in 16th but dropped into the relegation playoff places before Sunday's match. It seemed they would stay there once Balde's goal was rightly ruled out. The late goal means they are now level on 12 points with Toulouse, Amiens and 12th-placed Rennes, who have not won a match since August. Monaco had taken the lead through Ben Yedder's smart finish after just two minutes. However, a wonderful solo run and finish from Faitout Maouassa and Adrien Honou's tap-in put Rennes ahead just after the break. Monaco levelled after the away side gifted the ball to Cesc Fabregas. The Spaniard rolled in Islam Slimani to score in the 57th minute. ""We came back to 2-2 when we could have lost, and that's good. It was hard work but often those matches are what do you good,"" added Ben Yedder. Earlier, Claude Puel continued his perfect start as Saint-Etienne coach. Denis Bouanga's stoppage time penalty at Bordeaux launched Puel's side into the top half of the table. The 10-time French champions were second-bottom in Ligue 1 after their home loss to Metz late last month but have won three straight, the last two under Puel. Their turnaround in form, which includes victory over local rivals Lyon in Puel's first match, has moved them to ninth, ahead of 10th-placed Marseille's clash with Strasbourg. Bordeaux meanwhile missed the chance to move into the Champions League positions with their second home loss on the bounce."

28,23/09/2019,14:25,Monaco coach Jardim in spotlight amid awful start to season,Monaco coach Leonardo Jardim insists he is unfazed by the speculation over his future as the 2017 French champions go into a midweek derby against Patrick Vieira's Nice still without a win this season.,"The principality club battled to a 0-0 draw in Reims at the weekend but have a meagre three points after six games and sit in the Ligue 1 relegation zone. After only just avoiding the drop last season, Monaco had been hoping to return to challenging for Champions League qualification this time around. A reported 133 million euros ($146.1 million) has been invested in new signings, but they are already 12 points adrift of leaders Paris Saint-Germain and nine behind Nice in third. They have won only once in 15 games since March and supporters called for the head of Jardim during Saturday's match. ""It is nothing personal. The coach is always responsible for bad results,"" said Jardim, who masterminded that run to the title in 2017 before being sacked in October last year, only to return three months later after Thierry Henry's ill-fated spell in charge. ""Now we have two matches, against Nice and then against Brest on Saturday, but there is always pressure in football."" Monaco's main problem this season has been their defence, while summer recruits Wissam Ben Yedder and Islam Slimani have quickly forged a promising partnership in attack. However, they kept a welcome clean sheet in Reims while Ben Yedder and Slimani were out injured. Both hope to return against Nice at the Stade Louis II. It also remains to be seen if Cesc Fabregas will be recalled after being dropped at the weekend, and Jardim is convinced his squad now is far stronger than a year ago, when he first left the club. ""I am sure of it. It is the first time that I have had so many negative results and these cycles are difficult to change,"" he said. ""But we have more quality in the squad to be able to change quickly."" Meanwhile, Nice make the short trip along the stunning Cote d'Azur fresh from winning four of their opening six games. Danish striker Kasper Dolberg scored his first goal in French football in Saturday's 2-1 defeat of Dijon following his 20.5 million-euro move from Ajax, and Nice can go provisionally level with PSG if they win. Because you cannot take your eyes off him just now. The world's most expensive player has played just twice for PSG this season and on each occasion has popped up with a spectacular late winner. After his injury-time overhead kick to beat Strasbourg, on Sunday the Brazilian's clinical finish sank Lyon 1-0 to put his team clear at the top again. That win was achieved without the injured Kylian Mbappe, Edinson Cavani and Mauro Icardi, and it remains to be seen if any of them will return to face Reims in Paris on Wednesday. Neymar does seem set to play, though, and could once again be welcomed with a chorus of jeers from home fans at the Parc des Princes, despite his match-winning form. 4 - Monaco have not won any of their last four derby clashes with Nice. 7 - Lyon may be France's richest club behind PSG but Sunday's defeat at home to the capital side means they are already seven points adrift of the league leaders after six games. Sylvinho's team visit Brest on Wednesday. 10 - With just six points from their first six games, Saint-Etienne are enduring their worst start to a season in 10 years, since the 2009-10 campaign.

""It's four goals away from home, it's good. And with the victories, confidence is coming back,"" Dimitri Payet, who scored Marseille's third goal, told Canal+. Monaco, who only narrowly avoided relegation last term, remain second-bottom with just two points from their opening five matches and have already conceded 14 goals. The pressure is once again mounting on coach Leonardo Jardim, who was sacked early last season before returning after an ill-fated spell in charge from Thierry Henry. Marseille are now only two points adrift of reigning champions and leaders Paris Saint-Germain, and behind Rennes and Nantes on goal difference. ""Maybe we've dared to play a little more,"" added Payet. ""In the last quarter of an hour we suffered too. It's not always nice to watch, but you have to know how to be efficient."" Monaco grabbed the lead in the 17th minute after Bouna Sarr inadvertently handled a ball over the top towards Islam Slimani, with Ben Yedder stepping up to slam home the penalty and score his second goal for the club since joining from Sevilla. Ben Yedder wasted little time in netting his third, latching onto Slimani's perfectly-weighted through ball nine minutes later, before slotting into an empty net after his initial effort was kept out by Marseille goalkeeper Steve Mandanda. But the away team hit back as Argentinian striker Benedetto scored for the third straight game. They were level three minutes before the break, as Valere Germain ended a seven-match goal drought with a back-post diving header. Monaco's defensive woes continued and they fell behind just after the hour mark when some sloppy play in midfield allowed Payet to advance and drill an excellent long-range strike into the bottom corner. Benedetto, who signed for Marseille from Boca Juniors last month, piled further misery onto Monaco by powering home his side's fourth goal midway through the second half. Keita Balde came off the bench to pull one back for the hosts with 15 minutes to play, and seconds later Mandanda denied Balde and Slimani in quick succession to prevent Monaco from levelling. But Marseille closed out their most impressive victory under Villas-Boas with relative comfort in the final moments. Earlier on Sunday, Christian Gourcuff's Nantes moved into third as Kalifa Coulibaly's goal secured a 1-0 win over Reims, while Saint-Etienne came back from two goals down to draw 2-2 with Toulouse. Neymar scored a spectacular overhead kick in injury time on Saturday to snatch PSG a 1-0 win over Strasbourg, despite being relentlessly booed by his team's fans at the Parc des Princes after failing to force a close-season return to Barcelona."
30,14/08/2019,11:22,Monaco make Ben Yedder costliest Ligue 1 transfer of the summer,"Monaco said on Wednesday that they had bought veteran French striker Wissam Ben Yedder from Sevilla, with young Portuguese attacker Rony Lopes going the other way.","According to sources close to Monaco, the transfer is for 40 million euros ($44.7 million), the amount of the Ben Yedder's release clause, with Lopes valued at 20 million euros. That would make the 29-year old Ben Yedder the most expensive player bought by a Ligue 1 club so far in this summer's transfer window, ahead of Paris Saint-Germain recruits Idrissa Gueye and Abdou Diallo. The striker has four French caps and scored 70 goals for Sevilla in 138 matches over three seasons. He moved to La Liga in 2016 after six seasons at Toulouse. ""Wissam is a very talented player, a complete striker, who has proved his ability to score in Toulouse and Seville, but also in international competitions. He is also a player with an exemplary attitude,"" said club vice-president Oleg Petrov in a statement. Ben Yedder has reportedly signed a five-year contract. ""I come with the intention of proving, as always, my qualities and with the desire to reach a new level,"" said the player. Lopes, who was under contract with Monaco until June 2022, has signed a five-year deal with Sevilla. The 23-year-old joined Monaco in 2015 for around 15 million euros from Manchester City, before being loaned to Lille for a season and a half. Back in Monaco in 2017, he scored 15 goals and won the first of his two Portuguese caps in November 2017. Last season he scored four goals as Monaco struggled. Monaco, French champion in 2017 and runners up in 2018, are rebuilding after a season of turmoil. Coach Leonardo Jardim was fired last October. His replacement Thierry Henry could not lift the club out of the relegation zone and was fired in January. Jardim returned and dragged the club to a 17th-place finish. bur-pra-cb/fbe/ama/pb/cw"

I will give everything to improve and help the club to have a great season. I look forward to meeting my teammates,"" the 22-year-old told Monaco's website. Onyekuru, who has made 11 appearances for the Super Eagles, originally joined the Premier League side in 2017 but has spent the two past campaigns on-loan with Anderlecht and Galatasaray. The winger scored 14 league goals in Turkey last season and reportedly joins the Ligue 1 outfit for 17 million euros ($19 million). Leonardo Jardim's options in front of goal could be strengthened further with Sevilla's France forward Wissam Ben Yedder being linked with a move to Stade Louis II. However former club captain Radamel Falcao and Portugal wide-man Rony Lopes have been linked with moves away from the Principality."

United revealed they had ""reached an agreement with Monaco for Hannibal Mejbri to join the club subject to FIFA approval"". Reports claim the deal is worth up to £9.3 million ($11.1 million), with the Ligue 1 club receiving half up front and the rest in potential add-ons. France youth international Mejbri will complete the switch to United when he turns 17 in January. He was reported to have visited United's training ground with his parents, meeting the club's French stars Paul Pogba and Anthony Martial, who encouraged him to move to Old Trafford. Mejbri only joined Monaco in a £1 million deal in August last year having had spells in the academies at Paris FC and AC Boulogne-Billancourt. United have confirmed three other under-18 players have received the required clearances. Dillon Hoogewerf has arrived from Ajax and Mateo Mejia from Real Zaragoza, while goalkeeper Johan Guadagno has joined from IF Brommapojkarna."

Tielemans becomes Leicester's second big money buy in a week following the signing of Ayoze Perez from Newcastle for £30 million. ""I believe that we have the talent in our squad to achieve something special and for any player, that's an exciting thing to be a part of,"" said Tielemans. Leicester saw off interest from a host of other Premier League clubs to secure Tielemans, who scored three goals and provided four assists in 14 appearances during his loan spell in the second half of last season. ""It's an incredibly exciting time for this fotball club and to be able to bring players of Youri's quality here is an indication of the hunger for success we have,"" said Leicester manager Brendan Rodgers."
34,01/07/2019,19:18,Monaco sign Martins from Atletico Madrid,"Atletico Madrid have agreed to turn Gelson Martins' loan move to Monaco into a permanent transfer, the two clubs announced on Monday.","Martins has signed a five-year contract with Monaco after playing for the French team from late January until the end of last season. ""AS Monaco is thrilled to announce the signing of Gelson Martins,"" Monaco wrote on Twitter. ""Originally on loan from Atletico Madrid, the attacking midfielder has put pen to paper on a five-year permanent deal."" An Atletico Madrid statement read: ""Atletico Madrid and AS Monaco have reached an agreement for the transfer of Gelson Martins. ""The midfielder moved to Monaco on January 27 and, after an agreement was reached, will remain with the Monte Carlo club."" Martins signed for Atletico last summer from Sporting Lisbon but only played 12 competitive matches and has said he struggled to adapt to Diego Simeone's style. The 24-year-old played a more prominent role with Monaco, scoring four goals in 16 Ligue 1 games during his loan spell and helping the team steer clear of relegation."
35,18/05/2019,23:29,Monaco victory virtually ensures Ligue 1 safety,Monaco virtually made sure of their French Ligue 1 survival with a 2-0 win over Amiens on Saturday while champions PSG signed off their home campaign with Kylian Mbappe scoring his 32nd league goal of the season in a 4-0 win over Dijon.,"Falcao and Alexander Golovin scored in either half at the Stade Louis II to take Monaco to 36 points and three above the drop zone with one match left to play. Monaco, the 2017 champions, are not mathematically safe but they have a three-point lead over Caen who occupy the relegation play-off spot with a goal difference of seven. Guingamp were already relegated. Dijon joined them in the second division for next season when they lost 4-0 at PSG. French World Cup winner Mbappe, back from a three-match ban for a red card in the French Cup final, scored two of the goals to take his league tally to 32 with one game left. He is the first French player to reach that figure since Herve Revelli scored 31 for Saint-Etienne in the 1966/67 season. Elsewhere, Lille made sure of second place and a spot in the Champions League group stages with a 5-0 rout of Angers. Nicolas Pepe, who will leave the club in the summer, scored twice to take his season tally to 22. Lyon will finish third -- enough for a Champions League preliminary round place -- after a 3-0 win over Nice."
36,21/04/2019,22:26,Neymar returns as newly-crowned PSG face Monaco,Brazilian superstar Neymar joined the Parc des Princes party on Sunday when he came on at the start of the second half as newly-crowned French champions Paris Saint-Germain played Monaco.,"Neymar had been out since January 23 with a right foot injury, but had been named as a substitute for a game that kicked off hours after PSG were crowned champions when their closest challengers Lille dropped points earlier in the day. After PSG took a 2-0 first-half lead with a pair of goals by former Monaco player Kylian Mbappe, Neymar came on for the start of the second half replacing French midfielder Layvin Kurzawa. PSG had started their three previous league games needing a victory to seal their sixth French title in seven years, but had drawn once and lost twice. On Sunday afternoon Lille ended their challenge with a goalless draw at Toulouse. That left them 16 points behind PSG with only five games to play. PSG are hoping Neymar could start the April 27 French Cup final against Rennes. The Parisians have struggled with key injuries in recent weeks. Fellow striker Edinson Cavani is still out, while winger Angel di Maria was only on the PSG bench on Sunday. PSG took the field wearing a shirt with a large image of Notre Dame replacing the usual sponsor's logo. ""Notre-Dame"" replaced the player names on the back of the shirts. The iconic Paris cathedral was damaged in a spectacular blaze last Monday. The club said that they would put a limited edition of the shirts on sale on line during the match for 100 euros each. The club said the money ""will be donated to associations related to firefighters"". The club also posted a ""Hommage to Notre Dame"" video on their web site in which players praised the team-work of the Paris fire brigade and made a gesture that imitates the two famous towers that form part of the cathedral's facade. The club said it was also using Sunday's game to thank the firefighters."

""For next season the objective set by the club is clear, we are not here for a good time. We are here to take Monaco to the Champions League, it's my dream,"" he said. The closest Fabregas has come to lifting European club football's most coveted prize was as a runner-up with Arsenal in 2006. A World Cup winner with Spain in 2010, the 31-year-old said he left Stamford Bridge due to a decrease in playing time under new boss Maurizio Sarri, who signed midfielders such as Jorginho and Mateo Kovacic last summer. ""I could have extended my contract with Chelsea. A new coach came in with players like kids. It wasn't possible for me to play anymore,"" Fabregas said. Fabregas arrived at Monaco to work with former teammate Thierry Henry as boss but he was sacked and replaced the by the club's former head coach Leonardo Jardim after less than fourth months in charge. ""It's true, Thierry's departure was a shock, but it's in the past. I'm thinking about Monaco's future, its rescue and my future, which will be here,"" he said."

39,06/04/2019,22:07,Pressure mounts on Genesio as 'unacceptable' Lyon beaten by Dijon,Lyon slipped to a second damaging defeat this week as a 3-1 loss to struggling Dijon and a hostile atmosphere at the Groupama Stadium piled the pressure on Bruno Genesio on Saturday.,"The 52-year-old coach had been told by president Jean-Michel Aulas that he would be offered a two-year contract extension if Lyon reached the French Cup final and finished in the Ligue 1 top three. But a 3-2 Cup semi-final defeat by Rennes on Tuesday put his future in doubt, and fans on Saturday unfurled banners calling for Genesio's departure. ""We had already been eliminated on Tuesday. It's unacceptable,"" said goalkeeper Anthony Lopes, who added that the players need to put Genesio's unstable situation to the back of their minds. ""We are professionals. We must know what to do. We know that it's football. Part of the decision on the (future of the) coach was made on Tuesday but we must know how to ignore all that. ""The truth is on the pitch. If we don't turn up on the pitch it can only be difficult in the future."" Martin Terrier's first-minute goal briefly placated the home support, but only six minutes later Lyon were behind. Wesley Said danced through the hapless home defence to slot in a third-minute equaliser, before his speculative long-range effort was deflected past Lopes by Lyon centre-back Marcelo. Genesio's beleaguered men never seriously threatened a response and put paid to their own hopes in comical circumstances midway through the second half. Said's pull-back was inadvertently backheeled into the net by Lyon full-back Rafael, with the spin on the ball leaving Lopes grasping at thin air. The result leaves Lyon six points clear of Saint-Etienne in the third and final Champions League spot, after Les Verts grabbed a late 2-2 draw with Amiens. A first league win since January lifted Dijon off the foot of the table and into the relegation play-off place. Later on Saturday, Monaco took another step towards safety as Stevan Jovetic's 94th-minute equaliser rescued a 1-1 draw against fellow strugglers Guingamp. Leonardo Jardim's men trailed to Felix Eboa Eboa's 23rd-minute strike, but Jovetic bundled the ball in after a penalty-box scramble to score his second league goal of an injury-plagued season. Monaco are now seven points clear of 18th-placed Dijon, despite a run of only one win in five games. Saint-Etienne took some advantage of Lyon's slip-up thanks to Remy Cabella's effort in the fifth minute of added time which snatched a point at 10-man Amiens."
40,15/03/2019,23:32,Monaco edge away from relegation with Vinicius winner at Lille,Monaco moved nine points away from Ligue 1's relegation play-off spot as a 90th-minute Carlos Vinicius goal helped them beat second-place Lille 1-0 on Friday.,"The Brazilian scored his first goal for the Principality outfit since joining on-loan from Napoli in January as the hosts lost only for a second time at home in the league this campaign. Coach Leonardo Jardim, who led his side to the title in 2017, sees Monaco go clear of Dijon in 18th place with their fourth win in seven games since he returned to the Stade Louis II in January. ""A victory like today against the second-best team in the championship is very important,"" said Jardim. ""It's an important win, but we're still in a difficult situation."" The home side had the best of the early opportunities on goal as winger Jonathan Bamba hit the crossbar after 11 minutes with a left-footed effort. Bamba and Nicolas Pepe both had shots on goal to break the deadlock before the break but wasted their chances in front of Monaco goalkeeper Danijel Subasic. The visitors started the second half strongly as Aleksandr Golovin and Gelson Martins tested Mike Maignan before the 50-minute mark. Vinicius' first goal in Monaco colours came as he received the ball in the box. He took a deft touch with his toe to lift the ball over defender Jose Fonte, chested the ball down and slotted it past Maignan in the Lille goal. Lille remain 17 points behind leaders Paris Saint-Germain, who host arch-rivals Marseille on Sunday. Elsewhere on Friday, substitute Firmin Mubele clinched a 1-1 draw for Toulouse at Nice with an 89th-minute effort. On Saturday, bottom-of-the-table Guingamp can close the gap on Dijon, Caen host Saint-Etienne, Angers face lowly Amiens and Strasbourg head to Nimes."
41,09/03/2019,22:31,Skipper Marcelo injured as Lyon stumble before Barca trip,"Lyon's stand-in captain Marcelo left the field with a leg injury as his side struggled to a 2-2 draw at Strasbourg on Saturday, just days away from the Champions League last 16 second leg at Barcelona.","Bruno Genesio's side head to the La Liga giants with the tie finely balanced at 0-0 after the first leg in France but the Brazilian defender is a doubt for Wednesday's fixture. ""It's too early to know if he'll play against Barcelona. He has a little issue with his hamstring. We'll do everything we have to so he plays, but we have to wait until Sunday,"" Genesio told Canal+. Genesio added he plans to talk to the club's doctor after extra tests are carried out on the centre-back on Sunday. Moussa Dembele scored twice for Lyon at the Stade de la Meinau before Ludovic Ajorque claimed a double of his own in the space of 60 seconds during the second half. Club skipper Nabil Fekir, forward Bertrand Traore, attacker Memphis Depay as well as midfielder Tanguy Ndombele started on the bench as Genesio attempted to rest the influential four as the French club eye a first quarter-final in Europe's top-tier competition since 2010. Fekir and Traore were brought on during the last quarter of an hour looking for a late winner but their efforts were in vain. Lyon remain in third place in the table, four points behind Lille who travel to Saint Etienne on Sunday. Elsewhere big-spending Monaco dropped down to 17th place after a 1-1 draw against Bordeaux as 10-man Amiens beat mid-table Nimes 2-1 to move to 16th and Dijon rose out of the automatic relegation places with a 1-1 stalemate against Reims."
42,22/02/2019,14:08,Monaco name Russian Petrov as new CEO,"Ligue 1 strugglers Monaco on Friday unveiled Russian businessman Oleg Petrov as the club's new CEO, a week after the departure of his compatriot Vadim Vasilyev as vice-president.","Petrov, 55, is a friend of Monaco's Russian billionaire owner, Dmitri Rybolovlev, but has no experience of running a football club. A fluent English, Portuguese, Spanish and Greek speaker as well as his native Russian, Petrov has worked in large international companies in several sectors, including consumer electronics, fertiliser and diamonds. Monaco said in a statement: ""He has extensive experience in operational management and brand development in global markets."" Petrov will likely need all that business acumen as he joins a club who have endured a difficult season. French champions and Champions League semi-finalists in 2017, Monaco have since sold most of their prized assets and currently lie just above the relegation zone in 16th place. The decision to sack title-winning coach Leonardo Jardim in October and replace him with Thierry Henry backfired spectacularly, with the Arsenal and France legend lasting just three months before being fired. Jardim was then brought back for a second spell. ""After our recent difficulties, these changes should help Monaco return to winning ways,"" said club president Rybolovlev. ""Our priority today is to focus on a strong finish to the season and to do everything possible to strengthen the position of the team."""
43,17/02/2019,23:20,Henry can prosper despite Monaco flop: Wenger,"Thierry Henry has the qualities to be a successful manager despite his disappointing short spell at Ligue 1 strugglers Monaco, his former Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger said on Sunday.","The 69-year-old Frenchman said Henry could not have taken the Monaco job at a worse time in October when they were already on a poor run and by the time January came around the alarm bells were ringing. Henry, who was one of the stars of the Gunners side that enjoyed huge success under Wenger including the 'Invincibles' side of 2003/04 when they went through the league season unbeaten, guided Monaco to just two league wins in 15 matches. The 41-year-old was then sacked last month. ""In our job, it's one thing when you start the season, even if it doesn't go well, you have six months,"" said Wenger. ""If you arrive in October and the team is in a very bad position, you have three months. ""Because in January, everybody starts to become nervous, and things could go very badly. ""So you have less time when you arrive in the middle of the season, that's what happened to Thierry. ""So how he bounces back will be very important, I believe he has the quality and the desire to make a career, and the career is judged on a longer period."" Wenger, who was speaking at a Laureus Sport for Good presentation, said luck played a large part in whether or not a manager succeeds and he said Henry, and another of his former stars at Arsenal, Patrick Vieira, who is in charge of Ligue 1 side Nice, will need that. ""I started my job at 33 years of age and I had plenty of very promising people around me,"" said Wenger. ""Many of them disappeared and some survived. Why? We need luck and we need to work hard but it's always very difficult to predict the career of a manager because we depend a lot on the quality of the players, the quality of the clubs and the quality of the confidence we get. ""Both (Henry and Vieira) have the qualities and I wish both make a great career."" Wenger also bemoaned the impending departure from Arsenal of another of his long-serving players, Welsh midfielder Aaron Ramsey. The 28-year-old is to join Serie A outfit Juventus in July, ending 11 years at the Premier League club where he was signed as a teenager by Wenger. ""It will be a loss for Arsenal,"" said Wenger. ""I must say it will be an interesting move for Ramsey. ""He is a player who is great going forward. His main quality is he can keep the final ball and he makes interesting runs from deep. ""You don't find many players today who can make midfield runs off the ball. It will be an interesting addition for Juventus."" Laureus -- whose two days get together in Monaco climaxes with their awards on Monday -- is a global movement that aims to use the power of sport to tackle social challenges in the world."
44,11/02/2019,17:56,Monaco's World Cup star Golovin out injured again,Russia international Aleksandr Golovin faces several weeks out after injuring his ankle during Monaco's 2-2 draw with Montpellier at the weekend.,"Golovin limped off midway through the second half of Sunday's game with what the Ligue 1 club described as a ""bruised bone with a micro-fracture"" of the right ankle. Monaco gave no indication as to how long the 22-year-old midfielder is likely to be sidelined, although he is expected to miss a number of weeks. Golovin missed the first month of the season with an ankle problem after helping hosts Russia reach the quarter-finals of the World Cup. He has started 13 of 24 league games for Monaco this season, scoring one goal since his 30 million-euro ($33.8 million) move from CSKA Moscow last July."
45,04/02/2019,20:48,Princess Stephanie's son named Monaco vice-president's assistant,"Princess Stephanie of Monaco's son Louis Ducruet has been appointed assistant to the club's vice-president Vadim Vasilyev, the Principality outfit announced on Monday.","Ducruet, 26, moves from his position at the Ligue 1 strugglers' international recruitment department which he has held since 2015 to working with the Russian on general recruitment and football affairs. ""Louis has Monaco running through his veins. He holds a desire to manage the club one day. That's why I chose to help him along that path by allowing him to work closer with me,"" Vasilyev said. ""It's a new step for me which allows me to make the way the club works from a football point of view more global,"" Ducruet said. Vasilyev re-appointed Portuguese coach Leonardo Jardim in January three months after sacking him and replacing him with Thierry Henry. Monaco sit in 18th place in the French league table with only goal difference keeping them out of the automatic relegation spots. Jardim's next fixture is a trip to Montpellier on Sunday after a busy transfer window which included the signing of Spanish midfieler Cesc Fabregas and veteran defender Naldo."
46,31/01/2019,21:50,Leicester sign Monaco's Tielemans on loan,Belgium midfielder Youri Tielemans joined Leicester on loan from Monaco until the end of the season on Thursday.,"Tielemans has linked up with the Premier League club after scoring five goals in 20 league appearances for French side Monaco this season. As a teenager, Tielemans was regarded as one of the brightest young stars in Europe, but he hasn't quite fulfilled that potential since leaving Anderlecht for Monaco in 2017. The 21-year-old was handed his Belgium debut in 2016 and made two appearances for the team that finished third at the 2018 World Cup. ""The Premier League is one of the best leagues in the world and when I was young, I always watched Premier League games,"" Tielemans told Leicester's website. ""I'm really happy to be here and I'm excited to get started. ""It's a big family. Everybody is really kind and really good with me. I think it will be really good here."" The deal, which is subject to international clearance, sees Leicester midfielder Adrien Silva move in the opposite direction to Monaco, also until the end of the campaign."

Monaco are currently in the Ligue 1 relegation zone and fired coach Thierry Henry last week, bringing back Portuguese handler Leonardo Jardim, who led Monaco to the French title in 2017. Kagawa, who helped Dortmund win the German league and cup double in 2012 before spending two years at Manchester United, then returned to the German club in 2014, but has fallen out of favour under coach Lucien Favre. His path to the first-team is blocked by Dortmund captain and playmaker Marco Reus having scored 12 goals with nine assists from the attacking midfield berth. The transfer window closes at 1700 (GMT) on Thursday in Germany."
48,30/01/2019,00:14,Returning Jardim denied third straight final by Guingamp,"Guingamp denied returning Monaco coach Leonardo Jardim a third straight French League Cup final, beating the Principality side on penalties after a dramatic 2-2 draw on Tuesday.","Portugese boss Jardim returned to the team he led to the French title in 2017 three months after his sacking in a period where Thierry Henry took over the reigns. Both sides are fighting relegation battles in the French top flight with the Brittany-based outfit sitting bottom of the Ligue 1 table and Jardim's side one point and one place above them. William Vainqueur was sent off before Rony Lopes and Aleksandr Golovin scored for the visitors in the first 45 minutes and Alexandre Mendy and Marcus Thuram forced the shoot-out with second-half efforts. Sofiane Diop missed the seventh penalty for the visitors before 22-year-old winger Marcus Coco secured a place in the final of the French League Cup for the first time in the hosts' history. Jardim said his side were unlucky after Vainqueur's early dismissal. ""Playing 80-odd minutes with 10 men and to claim a 2-2 scoreline and then to go to penalties, we didn't have luck on our side,"" he said. ""I have to praise my players who played with 10 men for a lot of the game, they had a good attitude and stuck together."" Vainqueur, making his first start for Monaco, was sent for an early shower after less than a quarter of an hour. He was originally shown a yellow card for a challenge which caught the hosts' Thuram on above his ankle but referee Jerome Brisard changed it to a red after a VAR review. Jardim's side claimed the advantage on 19 minutes as Lopes flicked up a cross from recent signing Gelson Martins, turned and half-volleyed the ball past Karl-Johan Johnsson for his third goal of the season. Their lead was doubled four minutes later as Aleksandr Golovin netted for the first time for the club. He received the ball on a counter-attack from Martins and beat Johnsson with a strike into the roof of the net. The home side began the second half in the best way possible as Mendy raced his way past veteran defender Kamil Gilk to score as goalkeeper Danijel Subasic could only watch. The Bretons were level ten minutes later as Thuram embarrased the influential Martins. The son of former France international Lilian, Marcus was fed by substitute Ronny Rodelin outside the box to fire into the bottom corner with Subasic flat-footed. Cesc Fabregas was successful with the first penalty but youngster Diop missed the seventh and Coco booked himself a place in the Guingamp history books with subtle strike in the bottom corner. Guingamp will face either Strasbourg or Bordeaux in March's final as the two sides play on Wednesday."
49,28/01/2019,17:38,"Henry still has what it takes despite Monaco debacle, claims Fabregas","Cesc Fabregas believes Thierry Henry will still become ""a top coach"" despite lasting just three months in charge at struggling Monaco.","""We are sad for 'Titi' because I really think he will be a top coach, I am sure of it,"" Fabregas said on Monday of Henry, with whom he played at Arsenal earlier in his career. ""Football doesn't wait and maybe it was not the right moment or he didn't have the time to fulfil all his plans and everything he wanted to do. That is life, it happens."" Having previously worked as an assistant coach with the Belgian national team, Henry was appointed as coach in October, breaking out on his own in management for the first time. Fabregas, who shares the same agent as Henry, left Chelsea to team up with the former France striker when he signed a three-and-a-half-year deal for an undisclosed fee on January 11. The Spain star had played just three games under Henry before the latter was sacked last week in a stunning move by the principality club, being replaced by his predecessor Leonardo Jardim. Fabregas could be forgiven for wondering what he has let himself in for, with the 2017 French champions currently in the Ligue 1 relegation zone. ""I am not going to lie, one of the main reasons for me coming to Monaco is that Thierry called me,"" added the 31-year-old. ""He wanted me to play every game, every minute."" Fabregas and his teammates are currently in Brittany preparing for a League Cup semi-final against Guingamp on Tuesday as they look to reach the final of that competition for the third season running. After losing 2-0 at Dijon at the weekend with Henry's assistant Franck Passi in charge, this will be Jardim's first game back in charge. Fabregas said he is convinced the Portuguese coach, who masterminded Monaco's title triumph and run to the Champions League semi-finals two seasons ago, can ""bring experience and calm to the squad, and new ideas."" Jardim, 44, lasted a little over four years in his first spell in charge. He was still living in the principality before making his return to the Stade Louis II, despite being linked with jobs in China and Saudi Arabia. ""I want to start again from zero, forget a little bit what has happened,"" he told journalists. ""Thinking about the past is not going to help the players."" He also claimed that he knew he would eventually return to the club, and now he is just two games away from winning more silverware. ""I have a lot of gratitude for this club, for the directors who gambled on me four years ago, and in this difficult moment I could not say no,"" Jardim added. While avoiding relegation is their priority, winning the League Cup is the only way into Europe next season for Monaco, and Paris Saint-Germain's exit from the competition has increased their chances of going all the way. PSG had won the trophy in each of the last five seasons but lost at home to Guingamp in the quarter-finals. Strasbourg host Bordeaux in the other semi-final on Wednesday."
50,27/01/2019,23:14,PSG cruise to victory as worries grow over Neymar fitness,Edinson Cavani scored twice as Paris Saint-Germain shook off the loss of Neymar to injury with a 4-1 win over Rennes at the Parc des Princes on Sunday that keeps them unbeaten at the top of Ligue 1.,"The Uruguayan's goals took him to 16 for the season in 14 league appearances and bookended the scoring in the French capital, with Angel Di Maria and Kylian Mbappe also on target for PSG. Mbaye Niang had equalised for Rennes in the first half, but Thomas Tuchel's side eventually ran away with the game after the break and are once again a massive 13 points ahead of Lille at the top of the table, with two matches in hand. Despite that, this encounter was played out in a rather flat atmosphere, with one end of the stadium partially closed as a punishment following incidents during a game late last year. Brazil coach Tite and national team coordinator Edu were in attendance at the start of a European tour to check on the form of some of their key players, but it is unclear what they will have taken from this game. Neymar was missing after suffering a metatarsal injury in a French Cup win over Strasbourg in midweek, with some media reports in France now claiming that the world's most expensive player will definitely miss the first leg of their Champions League last-16 tie against Manchester United on February 12. Meanwhile, a lack of alternatives meant Tuchel fielded Marquinhos and Daniel Alves out of position together in midfield. On top of that, skipper Thiago Silva was caught out as Niang flicked Rennes level just before the half-hour, cancelling out Cavani's headed opener from a Di Maria cross. Rennes were arguably the better side in the first half, although Tuchel was raging after Niang escaped with a yellow card for a dangerous challenge on Thilo Kehrer. The referee upheld his decision even after a VAR review. Nevertheless, PSG ran away with the game after the break, going back in front on the hour mark when Silva sent Di Maria through to clip a delightful finish over Tomas Koubek. When Clement Grenier was caught in possession, Julian Draxler released Mbappe to score his 18th league goal of the campaign and make it 3-1. PSG completed the scoring in the 71st minute when Mbappe squared for Cavani to grab his second of the evening, making it 15 goals in three home wins for them in nine days. Earlier, Lyon strengthened their grip on a Champions League position after defender Jason Denayer's headed goal handed them a 1-0 win at Amiens. With their Champions League last-16 first leg against Barcelona looming on the horizon, Lyon remain third in Ligue 1, three points behind second-placed Lille. Lille won 2-1 at Marseille on Friday in a game which was held up for more than half an hour in the second half after a firecracker thrown from the stands exploded next to home player Kevin Strootman. Struggling Monaco slumped to a 2-0 defeat at relegation rivals Dijon on Saturday in their first game since Thierry Henry was sacked as coach. Henry lasted just three months in charge before being replaced by his predecessor Leonardo Jardim, who watched Saturday's game in the stands in Dijon. Monaco remain three points from outright safety."
51,26/01/2019,23:12,Monaco plight persists in wake of Henry exit,"Monaco suffered another damaging defeat as they lost 2-0 at Dijon in Ligue 1 on Saturday, just 24 hours after reappointing former boss Leonardo Jardim to take over from the sacked Thierry Henry.","Former France and Arsenal star Henry was suspended and later axed by Monaco after just two wins in the league since his arrival in October. Jardim, who led Monaco to the French title in 2017, is returning to the club only three months after he was dismissed following a dreadful start to the season. His first game back in charge will be Tuesday's League Cup semi-final against Guingamp, as Henry's former assistant Franck Passi oversaw the trip to fellow strugglers Dijon. The abject nature of this latest defeat further emphasised Monaco's perilous position in the table where they remain second from bottom, a point above last-placed Guingamp. ""We're giving everything but it's not enough,"" said Monaco captain Radamel Falcao. ""Each player has to continue to give more, all of us together. We're all in the same boat. ""We didn't manage to change things with Thierry Henry and now we must carry on with a better spirit and all fight together."" Dijon's Kwon Chang-hoon notched his first league goal since May, having recently returned from an Achilles injury, with a calm finish on 24 minutes after a static Naldo played the South Korean onside. Monaco were reduced to 10 men on the hour when Brazilian Naldo saw red for a clumsy challenge on Julio Tavares, and another defensive lapse allowed Naim Sliti to wrap up what was just Dijon's second league win since August. It was Naldo's second red card in a week after he was also dismissed in the 5-1 loss to Strasbourg last Saturday. ""We had chances just like in the past four of five matches but we always make a mistake that kills us,"" said Passi, who refused to be drawn on his own future. ""We let the other team go ahead and we're chasing after the result and that obviously makes it harder,"" he added. ""These players have the quality. They have what it takes to stay up but they just need for things to click and for it to happen quickly."" Youcef Atal and Allan Saint-Maximin scored for Patrick Vieira's Nice in a 2-0 home win over Nimes, while Kenny Lala fired home a sweet half-volley with practically the final kick to give Strasbourg a 1-0 victory over Bordeaux. Reims climbed into the top half as a 1-0 win at Guingamp stretched their unbeaten run to six matches. On Sunday, leaders Paris Saint-Germain will host Rennes without the injured Neymar. The world's most expensive player limped out of Wednesday's French Cup win over Strasbourg after hurting his foot, an injury similar to the one that ruled him out for more than two months last season. PSG coach Thomas Tuchel has said it is ""still too early"" to assess the seriousness of Neymar's injury, leaving the French giants sweating over his fitness ahead of their Champions League clash with Manchester United next month."
52,26/01/2019,13:28,"Heynckes, Terim and Jardim: Managers who could not stay away","Leonardo Jardim returned as Monaco head coach on Friday, only three months since being sacked by the club with the team struggling in the relegation zone.","Here, AFP Sport takes a look at famous managers who returned to their former clubs, some more than once. 1992-1997, 2008 -- Keegan became the darling of St James' Park in a fantastic five-year spell in charge of Newcastle during which he took the Magpies from the second division to the brink of a Premier League title while playing scintillating attacking football. But after Newcastle collapsed to gift Manchester United the 1996 league crown, Keegan left the club before returning 11 years later. It was a short-lived homecoming, though, as he fell out with controversial owner Mike Ashley and resigned after less than nine months in charge. 1985-1991, 2011-2012 -- 'King Kenny' became manager for a second time at Anfield in 2011, two decades after an emotional resignation brought the end to his first, trophy-laden stint. Dalglish led the Reds to the 2012 League Cup, which remains their only title since 2006, but left at the end of the 2011-2012 season after a disappointing eighth-placed league finish. 1987-1991, 2009, 2011-2013, 2017-2018 -- Heynckes has won four Bundesliga titles as Bayern coach -- the first in 1989 and the most recent just last year. He left for a third time after sealing an incredible 2013 treble of Champions League, Bundesliga and German Cup titles, and returned to lead Bayern out of a crisis in 2017 when Carlo Ancelotti was sacked. 1996-1997, 2006-2007 -- Capello led Real to the La Liga title in his first season in charge, and signed key players such as Clarence Seedorf and Roberto Carlos, only to be sacked. He came back to the Spanish capital 10 years later and helped Real end a four-year wait for a major title as he won La Liga in 2007, but was sacked again just weeks later for his pragmatic playing style. 1993-1996, 2005-2009, 2013-2017 -- Terim has been one of the most successful managers in Turkey's history, leading the national side to the Euro 2008 semi-finals in his second spell as coach. A third stint ended in 2017, but continuing his trend of preferring familiar surroundings, he rejoined Galatasaray for a fourth time. 1994-1999, 2001-2004 -- Lippi won three Serie A titles and only the second Champions League crown in Juventus' history in the 1990s, before leaving to join their great rivals Inter Milan. But it did not take long for him to return after being sacked by Inter, as he replaced the sacked Carlo Ancelotti in Turin, going on to take Juve to another Champions League final in 2003. 1945-1969, 1970-71 -- Busby was without doubt one of the game's greatest ever managers, having survived the tragic Munich air disaster in 1958 that decimated his much-loved 'Busby Babes' side to help United become the first English winners of the European Cup 10 years later. He retired the following season, but briefly returned to the Old Trafford dugout after the sacking of Wilf McGuinness. 2004-2007, 2013-2015 -- Mourinho won major titles in all three seasons of his first spell at Chelsea, and returned in 2013 amid great fanfare, declaring himself ""the happy one"". He won the Premier League title in his second season back, but was sacked a second time after a catastrophic start to the Blues' title defence in 2015. 2014-2018, 2019- -- Jardim led a young Monaco side to the 2017 French title, toppling the might and money of Paris Saint-Germain. Despite losing a host of key players, his side finished second last season, but he was dumped and replaced by Thierry Henry after a dreadful start to the current campaign. Monaco sacked Henry three months later, though, admitting it had been ""premature"" to dismiss Jardim and reinstating the Portuguese as boss."
53,11/01/2019,18:26,"Fabregas completes move from Chelsea to Monaco, reunites with Henry","Cesc Fabregas has completed his move to from Chelsea to Ligue 1 strugglers Monaco, a source close to the deal confirmed to AFP on Friday.","Fabregas put pen to paper on a three-and-a-half-year deal at the Stade Louis II after passing a medical earlier in the day, as he teams up with former Arsenal teammate Thierry Henry on the Mediterranean coast. The source told AFP that Chelsea will only receive payments related to Fabregas' performance on the Mediterranean coast, contrasting with media reports that Monaco had already agreed to pay Chelsea 10 million euros ($11.5 million) for the player who could now make his debut for his new club in Sunday's Ligue 1 game away at Marseille. Fabregas played with Henry at Arsenal at the start of his career, between 2003 and 2007, and the two share the same agent in Darren Dein. Now 31, Fabregas eventually made the same move as Henry when he left the Emirates Stadium for Barcelona, but he returned to English football with Chelsea in 2014. After winning two Premier League titles with the Blues, he has fallen out of favour at Stamford Bridge this season under new coach Maurizio Sarri. Fabregas made a tearful farewell to Chelsea fans in Saturday's 2-0 FA Cup win at home against Nottingham Forest, where he had a penalty saved. Having enjoyed a glittering career, capped by winning the World Cup with Spain in 2010, Fabregas arrives at a club who were French champions just 18 months ago but are currently in crisis. France legend Henry was appointed coach in October after Monaco started the season poorly under Leonardo Jardim. However, they have won just twice in nine league games since Henry's arrival and currently languish in the relegation zone, five points from safety before the weekend's matches. Nevertheless, Monaco have already progressed in both domestic cup competitions since the turn of the year, and the arrival of Fabregas takes the number of signings made by Monaco in the January window to three already. Veteran defender Naldo was the first to join from German club Schalke 04, and on Thursday Monaco announced the signing of France under-21 left-back Fode Ballo-Toure from Lille for 11 million euros plus bonuses. One player who will not now be signing on at the Stade Louis II, though, is the midfielder William Vainqueur. The former Marseille and Roma player was expected to put pen to paper on a move from Turkish club Antalyaspor, but Monaco announced earlier on Friday that he had failed a medical due to a calf problem."
54,07/01/2019,15:47,Sarri demands replacement for Monaco-bound Fabregas,Maurizio Sarri insisted on Monday that Chelsea must replace Cesc Fabregas as the veteran midfielder looks set to leave the Premier League outfit for Thierry Henry's Monaco.,"The 31-year-old's contract expires at the end of this season and he appeared to say goodbye after Saturday's 2-0 FA Cup win over Nottingham Forest, where he applauded all sides of Stamford Bridge. The Blues boss said Fabregas had a ""free day"" on Sunday, refusing to confirm or deny reports the playmaker had travelled to France to meet with Monaco, but demanded that the Blues supply him with reinforcements should he join his former Arsenal teammate Henry in Ligue 1. ""If Cesc will go, of course we need a replacement,"" Sarri said to reporters ahead of Tuesday's League Cup semi-final first leg against Tottenham at Wembley. ""Now, with the midfielders we are in trouble, I think. Without Cesc we have only five, so we are in trouble. We need a replacement."" With Chelsea offering one-year contracts for players aged over 30, Sarri added that Fabregas, whose opportunities have been limited this season, should accept a two-year deal on the table from Monaco for the good of his career. ""In my opinion, he needs to go,"" said Sarri. ""You know very well the situation. You know very well in this club there is a rule -- the renewal of players over 30 is usually one year. ""He has an offer for two years. I don't want a very important player as Cesc unhappy."" Callum Hudson-Odoi provided both goals for Alvaro Morata in their win against Forest and the 18-year-old has also been linked with a move away from Stamford Bridge to German giants Bayern Munich. Speaking about Hudson-Odoi, Sarri said: ""I know only that for me he's a very important player. He's very young, but now he's improving. ""I think to stay here is better for him. He's an English player. He's very young. He has the future. And I think he has a very great future here, in England, with the national team and with Chelsea."""
55,05/01/2019,23:38,Fabregas ready for Monaco switch - report,"Spanish midfielder Cesc Fabregas is expected in Monaco on Sunday to negotiate a transfer to the French Ligue 1 club from Chelsea, sports daily L'Equipe reported Saturday.","Fabregas and his agent Darren Dein will meet Monaco vice-president Vadim Vasyliev although a source told AFP that the move has not yet been finalised. Fabregas, 31, played four seasons at Arsenal from 2003-2007 alongside current Monaco coach Thierry Henry. He moved to Chelsea in 2014 but does not figure in the future plans of coach Maurizio Sarri having played just six times all season. On Saturday, Fabregas made a tearful farewell to Chelsea fans in the 2-0 FA Cup win over Nottingham Forest at Stamford Bridge where he had a penalty saved."
56,03/01/2019,19:50,Henry's Monaco recruit giant Brazilian Naldo for relegation scrap,"Brazilian defender Naldo has joined Thierry Henry's Monaco from Schalke 04, the French Ligue 1 club struggling in 19th place announced on Thursday.","The 36-year-old who has won 4 caps for Brazil heads to the Principality outfit on a contract until June 2020 after 14 seasons in the Bundesliga with Werder Bremen, Wolfsburg and Schalke, where he played 34 times last season. ""Welcome to Naldo, a defender with great experience at the highest level and noted for his leadership qualities. We are convinced that his profile will be an important asset in our desire to rapidly strengthen the workforce,"" Monaco's vice-president Vadim Vasilyev said in a statement on their website. The affable defender vowed to give everything he could for his new club. ""I thank AS Monaco for their trust. I will do everything to meet the expectations of the club on the field but also outside of it. I want to bring my experience to help AS Monaco,"" he said on the club website. Former France and Arsenal star Henry took over as Monaco coach earlier this season, but this is a much depleted team in comparison to the star studded outfit that won the French title two years ago. Since the 2017 success the club have sold the likes of World Cup winners Kylian Mbpappe, Benjamin Mendy and Thomas Lemar as well as Fabinho and Bernardo Silva. With three wins and just thirteen points from 18 matches so far for Monaco Naldo is unlikely to be the only close season recruit. Chelsea midfielder Cesc Fabregas, who played alongside Henry at Arsenal, is thought to be high on the coach's wish-list. Monaco sit one place from bottom of the table having only recorded three wins in their opening 18 fixtures and were knocked out of their Champions League group losing all but one of their six ties."
57,22/12/2018,23:24,Mbappe fires PSG past Nantes as Monaco lose again,"Kylian Mbappe grabbed the winner as Paris Saint-Germain beat Nantes 1-0 to go into the winter break unbeaten in Ligue 1, as Thierry Henry's Monaco suffered defeat by rock-bottom Guingamp on Saturday.","World Cup star Mbappe stole in at the far post in the 67th minute for his 13th league goal of the season, making him France's top scorer with Neymar away on holidays in Brazil. PSG coach Thomas Tuchel can also go on holiday relaxed with his club on 47 points, as second-placed Lille, 13 points adrift, lost 2-1 at home to Toulouse. ""I'm very happy because we can see the progress of the team,"" said Tuchel. ""You can feel the energy, it's a good thing to build on next year."" With Neymar away, Angel Di Maria was in the line-up and came closest to making it 2-0, forcing a fine save from Nantes goalkeeper Ciprian Tatarusanu, who then watched the Argentine hit the crossbar from the rebound. Meanwhile, third-placed Lyon drew 1-1 at fourth-placed Montpellier after opening the scoring thanks to their captain Nabil Fekir before a great header from Ruben Aguilar gave the surprise-package southerners a share of the spoils. Henry's Monaco were dreadful and the former Arsenal striker spat on the ground after Nolan Roux of Guingamp made fools of the Monaco defence to make it 2-0. ""I'm not going to have a good holiday,"" bemoaned Henry. ""Now you have to work and make do with what you have. ""It's necessary to work and work. There are still a lot of points to play for and that's the only positive thing about this evening."" Monaco were champions in 2017 but now have 13 points from 18 matches, just two more than Guingamp, and vice-president Vadim Vasilyev said the club needs to dip into the January transfer market. ""Until tonight, I thought we didn't need new players, but we do,"" Vasilyev told Canal+. ""It's difficult to analyse right now as I'm upset like the supporters. I understand the disappointment, it's up to us to act and draw the right conclusions."" Strasbourg paid hommage to the victims of a terror attack that killed five people on December 11 in their first home game since as they won 2-0 against Nice. Meanwhile, Marseille, in sixth, drew 1-1 at Angers and fifth-placed Saint-Etienne beat Dijon 3-0."
58,21/12/2018,02:50,Henry given helping hand as Ligue 1 returns to full strength,Thierry Henry has been sent reinforcements as he continues his faltering bid to save Monaco from relegation in a Ligue 1 weekend which returns to a full programme of fixtures after weeks of disruption brought on by nationwide protests and a terrorist attack.,"Henry's Monaco are 19th, three points away from safety heading into the last round of matches before the winter break, and host bottom-club Guingamp on Saturday as they look for just their fourth win of a miserable campaign. On Thursday they recruited veteran coach Franck Passi to flank the decorated former Arsenal and France striker and his inexperienced staff, who came to Ligue 1 from youth football at Arsenal and Benfica. Henry called the appointment ""added value"" and claimed that he and the club ""wanted to have this band (together) for a little while"" as they look to escape the drop less than two years after beating all-conquering Paris Saint-Germain to the league title and getting to the semi-finals of the Champions League. ""It did not happen quickly, we were looking for a deputy to complete the staff,"" said Henry. ""I had the opportunity to meet Franck about three weeks ago, we had a good discussion and we immediately hooked up."" Passi comes to Monaco with knowledge of the French league and experience in his new role after working as assistant to Marcelo Bielsa at Marseille and Lille. He has also held caretaker head coach positions at both clubs. ""After the discussion with Thierry, I felt ready as we have the same football values,"" Passi told reporters on Thursday. ""I think the project is very interesting, that we could get something out of each other and that I could work here as a number two."" Monaco's match is one of 10 fixtures in France, the first time a full round is being played for two weeks following demonstrations from ""yellow vest"" protesters and a terrorist attack in Strasbourg that left three dead. In total 11 of the matches postponed are still to be played, with some teams having two games in hand coming into the weekend's matches. One of those involves Champions League-chasing Montpellier and Lyon, whose game has been targeted by police for special security measures -- including a ban on travelling fans -- thanks to previous trouble between both sets of supporters and further demostrations in the southern city. They both lag way behind runaway leaders PSG, who have not played a league fixture since drawing at Strasbourg on December 5. In the meantime Thomas Tuchel's side have qualified for the last 16 of the Champions League and advanced into the League Cup quarter-finals. However, the reigning champions' absence from league football has not put a dent in their march to a almost certain fifth title in six years. Closest challengers Lille managed to play both their scheduled matches amid the postponements and protests but are still a whopping 10 points behind the capital city club, and with PSG hosting mid-table Nantes on Saturday, that gap is unlikely to be closed before players head off to celebrate Christmas with their families.

59,20/12/2018,16:36,Monaco appoint experienced Passi to assist Henry,"Veteran coach Franck Passi has joined Monaco as an assistant to Thierry Henry, the struggling Ligue 1 club announced on Thursday.","The 52-year-old Frenchman reinforces a staff of first-time coaches with little Ligue 1 experience. ""It's not a relief, it's an added value,"" said Henry, who has been under pressure since taking over a side which lies second-from-bottom in Ligue 1. Henry, who is in his first management job, is rediscovering the French top flight, which he left in 1999 for Serie A giants Juventus, before arriving at Arsenal later the same year. Neither of his assistants has any experience in France. Irishman Patrick Kwame Ampadu joined from Arsenal where he had spent six years coaching youth teams. Portuguese Joao Tralhao was a youth coach at Benfica. ""We wanted to have this band for a little while,"" said Henry. ""It did not happen quickly, we were looking for a deputy to complete the staff. I had the opportunity to meet Franck about three weeks ago, we had a good discussion and we immediately hooked up."" On their web site, Monaco noted that Passi was familiar with both the French league and the role of assistant after working in that capacity under Marcelo Bielsa at Marseille and Lille. Passi also worked under Elie Baup and Michel at Marseille. He had stints as head coach at Marseille and caretaker at Lille. As a player, he spent the 1993-1994 season at Monaco and his brother Gerald is a scout for the club. Monaco have won just three of 13 games in all competitions since Henry was appointed in October. They are 19th in the 20-team Ligue 1, three points away from safety. Passi will be on the bench on Saturday when Monaco entertain the one team below them in the league, Guingamp."
60,17/12/2018,00:04,Impressive Lyon plunge Henry's Monaco deeper into crisis,Lyon dominated struggling Monaco from beginning to end on Sunday to climb back into the Ligue 1 top three and bury Thierry Henry's side deeper in the relegation zone.,"Lyon kept pace with Lille, who won 3-2 at Nimes earlier despite playing much of the match with 10 men. Lille are three points ahead of Lyon, who have a game in hand, and five ahead of Montpellier, who did not play for a second consecutive week, and have played two fewer matches. The French title race is all but over with reigning champions Paris Saint-Germain 10 points clear, but a young Lille side are eyeing a return to the Champions League group stage for the first time since 2012, while Lyon, who squeaked into the last 16 in Europe in midweek, are seeking to ensure they will be back next year. ""This match was one of our most dominant performances in the league,"" said Lyon coach Bruno Genesio. ""Even with superiority, we continued to play simply, to work for each other."" Lyon took the lead in only the sixth minute with a goal by Houssem Aouar, his sixth of the season. Nabil Fekir added the second in the 34th minute. Kenny Tete shrugged off a timid challenge to pull back a low cross which Fekir attacked while Monaco's Jemerson hesitated. Monaco managed only one shot all game. They played almost the whole second half with 10 men after Aleksandr Golovin raked his studs down the back of Fekir's calf in the 47th minute and was sent off. Ferland Mendy added a deserved third for Lyon just before the hour mark. ""The match in Kiev on Wednesday made us realise that we had a strong group,"" said Genesio. ""And that we had to stop the childish attitudes that we have seen on some matches."" Monaco, the only team in the bottom half of the French league table to play this weekend, meekly wasted a chance to gain ground on their rivals. ""We have to look at the first goal we conceded and especially the second goal which summed up this game,"" Henry said. ""Winning without desire is hard. ""We have to try to put this game behind us, we have a big game against Guingamp next week."" Earlier, in-form striker Nicolas Pepe scored what proved to be the winner as 10-man Lille won at Nimes. ""What a match, I'm really proud of my players,"" said Lille coach Christophe Galtier. ""We must not forget that we played for more than an hour and 20 minutes with 10 men. ""With the added time, it was a very long and hard match physically."" Portuguese teenager Rafael Leao headed Lille into a fourth-minute lead, but Galtier's men suffered a setback when former Southampton centre-back Jose Fonte was sent off in the 16th minute. Jonathan Bamba's deflected effort doubled the advantage shortly before the interval, though, and Pepe appeared to have made the points safe midway through the second half with his 12th goal of the campaign. ""After the PSG strikers, Pepe and Bamba are the best,"" said Nimes coach Bernard Blaquart. The 10 men finally started to tire late on, but Lille held on for victory despite Nimes goals from Rachid Alioui and Clement Depres."

Lucien Favre made nine changes from Saturday's derby victory against Schalke which continued their superb unbeaten start to the Bundesliga season. ""It's a perfect evening. On the whole it was a deserved victory,"" Favre said. Henry started four teenagers in a meaningless game for the Ligue 1 strugglers who were guaranteed to finish bottom of the group for a second straight campaign after defeat at Atletico in round five. The former France striker stated he used the fixture as a warm-up for Sunday's domestic trip to Lyon. ""Dortmund posed a real challenge. We'll recover quickly and prepare for Lyon,"" he said. ""Right now we have a problem, to sort things out in Ligue 1."" Monaco have failed to win in 14 European games and the Germans made it through to the knockout stage of the top-tier competition after having to settle for a Europa League place last season. With a quarter of an hour on the clock the Germans attacked and the ball was worked to striker Maximilian Philipp inside the box. His low cross found winger Guerreiro at the back post to tap in. Dortmund centre-back Abdou Diallo, who spent three seasons with the principality outfit earlier in his career, wasted a good chance on the half-hour mark as he scuffed his shot wide despite being unmarked in the box. In a scrappy second half neither team could muster a clear shot on goal until Guerreiro added his second of the game and fourth in the competition so far this season from a delicate Paco Alcacer lay-off on 88 minutes. In Belgium it finished goalless between Club Brugge and Atletico and the Germans finished above the Spanish club on their head-to-head record."
62,06/12/2018,13:39,"Henry, Vieira clash postponed as more games called off amid security concerns in France","Three more Ligue 1 games scheduled for this weekend, including the clash between Thierry Henry's Monaco and local rivals Nice, have been postponed, the French league (LFP) said Thursday, amid fears of more violent ""yellow vest"" protests in France over rising living costs.","The LFP said Friday evening's game at the Stade Louis II had been called off following a request by the government in the Mediterranean principality, ""in collaboration"" with authorities in the neighbouring French Alpes-Maritimes prefecture, which includes Nice. Sunday night's encounter between Saint-Etienne and Marseille and Saturday's meeting of Angers and Bordeaux have also been postponed on the request of local authorities. The latest postponements come after Paris Saint-Germain's game against Montpellier and Lyon's trip to Toulouse -- scheduled for Saturday -- were both called off due to security concerns, and the possibility remains that all other French top-flight games could be postponed too. Since November 17, demonstrators wearing yellow, high-visibility vests have blockaded roads in protest against higher taxes on diesel fuel. Demonstrations turned particularly violent last Saturday, with 412 people arrested after the worst clashes in central Paris for decades. A new round of protests is expected this weekend. The Cote d'Azur derby was due to see Monaco take on a Nice side coached by Patrick Vieira, Henry's former teammate at Arsenal and the French national side. Henry oversaw just his second win in 10 games in charge of struggling Monaco as they beat Amiens 2-0 away on Tuesday with a brace of penalties by Radamel Falcao, but the 2017 champions remain in the bottom three. Five games will go ahead including second place Lille who welcome Reims looking to close the gap with PSG to 11 points."

Amiens defender Bakaye Dibassy was sent off for catching the Monaco captain with a raised boot in the 90th minute, and Falcao wrapped up a second victory in three games with another penalty deep into stoppage time. The result provisionally bumped Henry's side up to 17th place above Dijon and Amiens on goal difference, confirming their recent upturn under the former France star in recent weeks. Nice extended their unbeaten run under Patrick Vieira to six games with a 0-0 draw at home to Angers, who saw goalkeeper Ludovic Butelle dismissed in the closing stages. Second-place Montpellier host Lille, in fourth, later on Tuesday as both sides attempt to cut into Paris Saint-Germain's 14-point lead at the top of the table. PSG will be without Neymar as they look to continue their undefeated record in Ligue 1 this season on Wednesday's trip to Strasbourg. The world's most expensive player came off early in the second half in Sunday's 2-2 draw at Bordeaux after hurting the same groin he injured playing for Brazil against Cameroon last month."
64,01/12/2018,23:25,Henry laments Monaco's 'fear of winning' after latest loss,A week that started brightly for Thierry Henry and Monaco ended in disappointment as they let in two late goals to lose 2-1 at home to rising Montpellier in Ligue 1 on Saturday.,"Youri Tielemans gave Monaco the lead in the 42nd minute, but Andy Delort levelled after 81 minutes and Petar Skuletic hit the winner with four minutes left. Monaco remain mired in 19th place in the 20-team division. Last weekend Henry eked out his first victory as Monaco manager at Caen, but on Wednesday his side lost away to Atletico Madrid, a defeat that ensured they will finish last in their Champions League group. Against Montpellier, Monaco had a chance to double their lead in the 54th minute when Tielemans, faced with an open goal, passed to Aleksandr Golovin, who hit the bar. After that the visitors took control ""You've got to shoot into the empty net,"" said Henry after the match. Asked if the match was a disaster, Henry answer: ""Yes!"" ""We talk about the fear of losing, but the fear of winning also exists,"" he said. ""We gave a good performance for 54 minutes....but that's not enough."" The victory lifts Montpellier to second. They are 13 points behind Paris Saint-Germain, who round off the weekend's matches in Bordeaux on Sunday evening, but are just one point ahead of Lyon and two clear of Lille. Those two met on Saturday and drew 2-2. In Lille, the home team raced into a two goal lead with goals by Loic Remy, after 17 minutes, and Nicolas Pepe, after 28 minutes. Lyon, who drew by the same score against Manchester City on Tuesday to remain on course for the last 16 of the Champions League, by Bertrand Traore after 63 minutes and Moussa Dembele with four minutes to play. ""There is automatically a feeling of frustration among the players,"" said Christophe Galtier, the Lille coach. ""In the end, I'm happy with this point."" The Lyon president, Jean-Michel Aulas, also said he was happy with a point in the battle to finish second. ""A draw away against a direct opponent for the European places is a good result,"" Aulas said. ""We saw a good match and a very good Olympique Lyonnais (performance)."""
65,25/11/2018,00:02,Henry gets first Monaco win as PSG tighten grip on Ligue 1,Radamel Falcao secured Thierry Henry his first win as Monaco boss with a free-kick that would have made his manager proud as Paris Saint-Germain warmed up for Liverpool's visit by strengthening their hold on Ligue 1 with a routine win over Toulouse without Neymar and Kylian Mbappe.,"The Colombian striker struck with a dipping set-piece nine minutes after the break, and Henry could be seen smiling on the touchline as his players celebrated Falcao's winner wildly. ""I'm happy for the team, all the fans, we needed that, even if it was not a match for the purists,"" said Monaco coach Henry afterwards. ""Style is important, in general, but... we can think about style later."" Falcao's fifth league goal of the campaign secured Monaco's first win in any competition since the opening day of the league season, a miserable run of form that has left them second-bottom in Ligue 1 despite Saturday's win. The victory came seven games into Henry's reign at Monaco, where a host of injuries has further complicated an already difficult start to his tenure. ""This is only the beginning, there are still a lot of matches and battles to come. I happy for the team, for the hard work they put in that for a while was not rewarded."" Earlier on Saturday Uruguay striker Edinson Cavani saved a disjointed performance from runaway leaders PSG to maintain their 100 percent start to the season ahead of the crunch Champions League clash with Liverpool on Wednesday. Neymar and Mbappe were both injured during friendlies in the international break, and PSG are sweating on their recovery for the huge Group C clash with the Parisians just a point behind the Reds and Napoli and gunning to qualify from the competition's tightest group. Shorn of their two stars, PSG dominated possession but struggled to create chances against 15th-placed Toulouse. However coach Thomas Tuchel said that he was ""optimistic"" that the pair could return for the match at the Parc des Princes. ""I am more optimistic (than on Friday) because both did individual training today,"" said Tuchel after his team's win. ""I hope they will be able to train with the whole team on Monday."" Cavani ensured that their domestic dominance was consolidated when he expertly controlled a ninth-minute knockdown after a period of scrappy play, then spun Toulouse defender Kelvin Amian with a neat flick before firing home the winner. His goal put PSG a full 15 points ahead of second placed Lyon, who prevailed in a tight derby with Saint-Etienne on Friday night thanks to Jason Denayer's second half header. On Sunday Lille can take back second place from Lyon with a win over Nice, while local rivals Montpellier and Marseille continue their battle for the Champions League places. Rudi Garcia's Marseille are sixth but would overtake Saint-Etienne should they beat lowly Amiens, while their fellow southern club Montpellier take on Rennes knowing a win would take them second should Lille stumble at Nice."
66,13/11/2018,20:14,Monaco youth recruitment in Football Leaks spotlight,The French Football Federation announced Tuesday an investigation into claims Monaco may have paid illegal signing on fees to youth team recruits.,"The FFF took action over the accusations which surfaced earlier as part of the Football Leaks affair with French investigative platform Mediapart. ""The conditions surrounding the recruitment of two youth players by AS Monaco"" will be looked into,"" read a joint statement from the federation and the the French Football League (LFP) ""An investigation will determine any eventual disciplinary moves or possible legal cases,"" the statement said. ""The recruitment of players is highly regulated, and even more so in the case of minors,"" the statement said. Asked by Mediapart if the documents they had concerning the two transfers were legal, the LFP said such documents ""would be considered null and void and both parties would be sanctioned."" The matter is the latest chapter in a dreadful season for Monaco. They were eliminated from the Champions League, dropped into the Ligue 1 relegation zone and saw thir president quit France for Moscow last Saturday after being released on bail for fraud charges."
67,12/11/2018,00:10,Cavani bags hat-trick as perfect PSG leave Henry's Monaco down and out,Thierry Henry's disastrous start as coach of Monaco continued on Sunday as Edinson Cavani's VAR-assisted hat-trick helped Paris Saint-Germain to an easy 4-0 win in the principality that saw them extend their perfect record in Ligue 1 this season.,"Neymar netted a penalty to complete PSG's victory, as they made it 13 wins from 13 league games under Thomas Tuchel, further stretching their start to the season that is a record in France and in Europe's so-called big five leagues. The result for them came after a week marred by revelations from French investigative website Mediapart that youth scouts at PSG had subjected potential signings to racial profiling over several years. But while they go 13 points clear of second-placed Lille at the Ligue 1 summit, the club who have been their main challengers in recent seasons continued their deeply worrying slump, with Henry again left to look on helplessly from the touchline. Champions in 2017, Monaco are in the relegation zone and five points away from outright safety having failed to win in six matches in all competitions since the Arsenal and France great took charge. They have now gone 16 games without a win altogether, with this result following a 4-0 home reverse against Club Brugge which knocked them out of the Champions League. Monaco are on their worst run in France's top flight in 32 years, at a time when Football Leaks claims about their Financial Fair Play breaches and the arrest of their Russian billionaire owner Dmitry Rybolovlev on corruption charges have cast a further shadow over the club. ""We are playing for survival, nothing else,"" said Henry, who has picked up a squad cursed by injuries. Here he was missing a dozen players due either to injury or suspension at kick-off, while both Belgian international Nacer Chadli and his replacement Jordi Mboula had to come off hurt. ""We lost two more players tonight, so it is starting to become a lot,"" he said, adding: ""I am staying positive because even with all that we managed to create chances against PSG."" The average age of his bench here was under 19, while his starting line-up featured a 17-year-old debutant in defence in Benoit Badiashile. It was little wonder that PSG -- themselves showing six changes following their Champions League draw at Napoli -- found the going so easy. They went ahead in the fourth minute when Neymar drove the ball across goal for Cavani to convert. The goal was initially disallowed before being given by the Video Assistant Referee, and the same thing happened in the 11th minute when Cavani turned the ball in again after the flag was wrongly raised for an offside against Moussa Diaby. In contrast to those two goals, a fine Julian Draxler finish in first-half stoppage time was initially given before being disallowed on review. However, Diaby squared for Cavani to complete his hat-trick in the 54th minute, and Neymar then rolled in a penalty after Kylian Mbappe had been fouled by France teammate Djibril Sidibe. ""I am very satisfied with the result, and with the fact we showed the hunger to win a 13th straight game. That is extraordinary,"" said Tuchel. ""Monaco and Henry are in a very difficult situation with lots of players out injured. This wasn't the night for Monaco to challenge us. They can do that if they have all their players back but not today."" Elsewhere on Sunday, Lucas Ocampos and Adil Rami scored as Marseille bounced back from a run of four straight defeats to beat Dijon 2-0 on an emotional afternoon at the Velodrome. A minute's silence was held before kick-off in memory of the eight people killed when two buildings collapsed in the southern French city on Monday. The result lifted Marseille up to sixth, back to within three points of third-placed Montpellier, who beat them 3-0 last weekend. Bordeaux were held to a goalless draw by Caen, while Rennes drew 1-1 with local rivals Nantes."
68,09/11/2018,02:40,Henry's Monaco in disarray as PSG come to town,"Winless in 15 matches and coming off the club's heaviest European home defeat, it could well get worse for Thierry Henry and Monaco this weekend with the visit of runaway Ligue 1 leaders Paris Saint-Germain.","Monaco's flickering Champions League knockout hopes fizzled out completely with a ""shameful"" 4-0 defeat by Club Brugge in midweek, leaving Henry still chasing his first victory as manager since taking over from Leonardo Jardim. The odds are massively stacked against his injury-depleted side ending that wait on Sunday. Monaco have lost their last seven meetings with PSG -- including a 7-1 thrashing in the last league clash in April. Meanwhile, PSG are off to a record-setting start with 12 successive wins, the best-ever start to any of Europe's so-called big five leagues -- Spain, England, Italy, Germany and France. ""We need to try and get back on the right track. I hope we'll find the solution to stopping Paris,"" said Henry, albeit admitting ""the worst is possible"". ""We're trying to do everything to regain a sense of calm but if you don't win it's difficult,"" he added. ""We lost another player to injury in (Kamil) Glik. That's not going to help matters as we already had 10 or 11 injured players. I have to be positive, otherwise what can you do?"" Henry received the backing of France boss and former team-mate Didier Deschamps, Monaco's coach when they reached the 2004 Champions League final, who believes the 41-year-old can excel in management. ""He is starting in a tough and difficult situation,"" said Deschamps. ""He's just beginning but he has all the abilities to become a very good coach."" PSG will look to put a turbulent week off the pitch to one side. The club has come under scrutiny following Football Leaks revelations about their breaches of Financial Fair Play regulations, while a probe is underway into claims that young players were subject to racial profiling by talent scouts. Monaco owner Dmitry Rybolovlev also made the headlines on Wednesday after the Russian billionaire was charged with influence peddling and bribery in connection with a fraud case involving a Swiss art dealer. With PSG a staggering 11 points clear already, Montpellier hope to maintain their surprise push as the best of the rest away to Angers on Saturday. ""We've got to maintain the spirit we've shown since the start of the season, but in football everything's fragile and can change quickly. We can't get carried away,"" said coach Michel Der Zakarian. Lille, who are level on points with Montpellier in third, have brought in Nicolas Anelka as an academy coach to train the club's apprentice strikers. ""Nicolas is really enthusiastic. He wants to stay out of the spotlight and bring some of his striking expertise and know-how to our young players,"" said Lille boss Christophe Galtier, whose side host Strasbourg on Friday. Fourth-placed Lyon travel to Guingamp, the only club below Monaco at the foot of the table. Guingamp are set to reappoint Jocelyn Gourvennec, the man who led them to the French Cup title in 2014, on a two-year deal next week after sacking Antoine Kombouare. Marseille face a partial close of their south stand after fans threw missiles and set off flares during their 2-0 defeat to PSG on October 28. They host Dijon on Sunday. The sale of Bordeaux to US investment fund GACP was completed on Tuesday. New owner Joe DaGrosa is planning to invest 80 million euros ($91 million) over the next two seasons and said there is ""no limit"" to their ambitions. Players will wear shirts bearing the Bleuet de France cornflower -- a national symbol of remembrance -- this weekend in tribute to the victims of World War I to commemorate the 100-year anniversary of the armistice.

69,07/11/2018,18:00,Russian billionaire Rybolovlev charged in Monaco fraud case,"The Russian billionaire Dmitry Rybolovlev, owner of the Monaco football club, has been charged along with three others in connection with a fraud case involving a Swiss art dealer, a legal source said Wednesday.","The exact charges were not immediately known, but Rybolovlev and the three others, which include one of his lawyers, have been released from custody, said the source, confirming a report on the website of local daily Nice-Matin. The other two taken in for questioning were the wife and son of the former Monaco justice minister Philippe Narmino, the source said. Since 2015, Rybolovlev has been locked in a legal battle with Yves Bouvier, the art dealer he accuses of having swindled him out of up to a billion dollars, by charging inflated fees for works of art. Rybolovlev was detained Tuesday and held overnight for questioning after a mobile phone was seized from his lawyer Tetiana Bersheda. On October 2 this year, Rybolovlev opened a new front in his legal battle, launching a $380 million (333 million euros) lawsuit against the Sotheby's auction house through the New York courts. In it, he accused the auction house of having helped Bouvier, their art advisor, carry out ""the largest art fraud in history"" -- at his expense. Rybolovlev says Bouvier tricked him over the acquisition of 38 works of art he bought over a decade for more than $2.1 billion. Sotheby's has dismissed the lawsuit as ""entirely without merit"", and had already filed its own lawsuit against Rybolovlev in Switzerland in 2017."
70,06/11/2018,21:10,More misery for Henry as Monaco crash out of Champions League,Thierry Henry's Monaco slumped to an embarrassing 4-0 home defeat to Club Brugge on Tuesday as the French side tumbled out of the Champions League group stage with two games still to play.,"Giant striker Hans Vanaken scored twice, the second from the penalty spot, while Brazilian forward Wesley banged in a third as Monaco fell three goals behind in just 24 minutes. Ruud Vormer condemned Monaco to their heaviest ever home loss in Europe as he netted a fourth with five minutes to go to leave Henry's team fighting for the consolation of a spot in the Europa League last 32. It came just hours after club owner Dmitry Rybolovlev was detained for questioning by police in Monaco in relation to a corruption probe stemming from his long-running legal battle with a Swiss art dealer. Henry remains without a win in five matches since replacing Leonardo Jardim last month in his first managerial role, as Monaco's winless run in the Champions League extended to 12 outings. ""I am upset with the way we reacted to falling behind. We started well, but once we fell behind we stopped playing and that's a little bit worrying,"" said Henry. ""We need to try and get back on the right track and will now focus on the league. I hope we'll find the solution to stopping Paris,"" he added, ahead of Sunday's visit of the Ligue 1 leaders. ""Right now I'm telling myself the worst is possible."" Defender Djibril Sidibe roundly criticised Monaco's latest dismal performance. ""It was shameful. Even if we showed good intent, it is the end product that counts. We weren't at the required level this evening, it's as simple as that,"" said Sidibe. ""We need to ask individual questions of ourselves. If you don't win 50-50s then you cannot win matches."" Henry was dealt another injury blow ahead of kick-off with Russia international Aleksandr Golovin ruled out with an ankle problem, while the game came too soon for inspirational Portuguese winger Rony Lopes. Radamel Falcao returned to captain the side after missing the reverse fixture, a 1-1 draw on October 24, and the Colombian went close in the first few minutes as he headed a tough chance wide at the far post. Sofiane Diop should have fired Monaco ahead when he had just Brugge goalkeeper Ethan Horvath to beat, but the US international pulled off a brilliant save to keep out the teenager's powerful strike from close range. Brugge were without a win in the Champions League group stage since 2005, but the Belgians grabbed the lead on 12 minutes as Vanaken picked out the roof of the net from a Mats Rits cross. It got worse for Monaco five minutes later as Antonio Barreca was whistled for a handball while attempting to block a shot from Vanaken, who smacked the resulting penalty beyond Diego Benaglio. Passive defending allowed Wesley to blast home a third, the Brazilian picking the up ball in the channel down the left and skipping past Kamil Glik before hammering in from the edge of the area. Horvath produced another sharp save to dig out a deflected effort from Youri Tielemans, but Henry effectively accepted the game was up when he removed Falcao for 17-year-old Gobe Gouano on the hour. Sidibe sent a flashing drive across the face of the Brugge goal in a rare second-half opening for the hosts, but a dreadful evening was compounded by more appalling defending to allow Vormer a fourth -- after Glik had hobbled off with a groin injury. A flick-on by Rezaei Kaveh skipped past both Tielemans and Almamy Toure to leave Vormer to scamper clear and stroke beyond Benaglio to cap Brugge's first group stage victory since a 3-2 home defeat of Rapid Vienna in November 2005."
71,05/11/2018,22:27,Henry worried by Monaco winless run,"Monaco coach Thierry Henry refused to look for excuses for his winless run at Monaco on Monday, insisting he and his players will dig deep against Brugge in the Champions League on Tuesday.","Henry has yet to win in four games since taking charge at Monaco, losing to Strasbourg and Reims and drawing with Dijon in the league and drawing at Belgian outfit Brugge in the last round of European matches. ""It's a huge game,"" said former Arsenal and Barcelona striker Henry, who was Belgium's assistant coach in the last World Cup. ""We need the three points even if some might say we should have taken three in our last game too."" Henry's side are third in Group A, level with Brugge on a point with Dortmund on nine and Atletico on six. ""You can't change everything in two weeks, but we shouldn't think about it all too much,"" said the smooth-talking Frenchman, who began his playing career at Monaco. ""Work is the key, each of us needs to look inside ourselves and work out what more we can do."" French champions in 2017, Monaco have sold Kylian Mbappe to PSG, Bernado Silva, and Benjamin Mendy to Man City, Tiemoue Bakayoko to Chelsea, Thomas Lemar to Atletico Madrid and Fabinho to Liverpool in the last 18-months. Henry played down the role of changes in playing staff in Monaco's worrying collapse. ""The changes are no excuse,"" insisted Henry, who took over from the sacked Portuguese coach Leonardo Jardim in mid-October. ""It's a mental thing but I'm not going to pretend this isn't worrying, because it is,"" he said. ""It's up to us to turn things around with hard work."" One star player Monaco held onto is the France defender Djibril Sidibé, who helped his nation win the 2018 World Cup. ""I can't pretend I'm not worried,"" said the 26-year-old right-sided defender. ""It's got into our heads, me as much as any of the others,"" said Sidibe, who sat beside Henry at the press conference ahead of Tuesday's Champions League game they need to win to qualify for the Europa League by finishing in third place. ""There are plenty of young players here and many off them have little experience. ""It'll be a high level match and we have to focus on winning it,"" he added."
72,23/10/2018,21:49,Champions League 'dream' awaits Monaco coach Henry,"Newly-appointed Monaco coach Thierry Henry has no intention of sulking over the Ligue 1 side's poor domestic form as he seeks a ""dream"" Champions League date with Club Brugge Wednesday.","Former Arsenal and France star Henry kicked off his fledgling coaching career with a 2-1 away defeat to Strasbourg at the weekend, a result that left the struggling Principality side second from bottom of the French league table. Monaco fans will be hoping it won't be more of the same on Wednesday, when they face the Belgians away looking to claim their first points of the group stages. Henry, a Champions League winner with Barcelona in 2009, believes it could be just the tonic to get Monaco, beaten finalists in 2004, back on track. ""People might ask if this match is coming at the right time for me, given our position in the table,"" Henry said in Bruges on Tuesday. ""But they say the same about the teams leading the table, they say the Champions League can't be won by teams fighting for the (domestic) title. ""I don't see it like that. The Champions League is a dream. You want to play in it, you want to be part of it and it might just be what we need to give us back some confidence."" After succeeding Leonardo Jardim at the Monaco helm, in just one week Henry has ""introduced a degree of tactical flexibility"" into Monaco's game, said midfielder Youri Tielemans, who knows Henry well from his previous role as an assistant to Roberto Martinez in the Belgium set-up. Henry expects a tough game at the Jan Breydelstadion against a team with ""quality"" players who ""know how to fight till the end"". But the 41-year-old Frenchman has insisted on instilling a degree of optimism and is adopting a philosophical approach as he looks for the performance that will help Monaco believe again. ""We're not in a situation where we can laugh about things, but we have to combine respect, humility, hard work and joy,"" said Henry. ""It's always easier to work when there's joy."" Henry's first game in charge as coach was marked by a 17th-minute opener for Strasbourg and a sending-off which left Monaco, now 24 points adrift of leaders Paris Saint-Germain, fighting for the scraps. But the World Cup winner insists his Champions League debut as coach cannot come quick enough. ""It's good for us to have this match right after Strasbourg, so we can try and regain some confidence and not think too much about certain things. ""We're looking for a win or a really good performance as quickly as possible."""
73,23/10/2018,03:40,Henry hoping for a break in Champions League bow with Monaco,"One newspaper headline described Thierry Henry as ""cursed"" in the wake of his managerial bow with Monaco, and the France great will be desperate to put that behind him in Wednesday's Champions League encounter with Club Brugge.","Henry's long-awaited first game as a coach in his own right ended in a 2-1 defeat at Strasbourg on Saturday, with Monaco's night marred by goalkeeping errors, a sending-off and injuries. The headline in question appeared in the following day's edition of sports daily L'Equipe, and that game certainly made it clear to the 41-year-old that he has a massive job on his hands. Monaco, the club where Henry began his playing career before going on to star for Arsenal, are in a critical condition, having lost their last five games and gone 11 matches without a win. They are enduring their worst start to a season in 65 years and their longest run without a league win for a decade. Monaco may often be mocked for their paltry attendances, but they have a passionate fan base who will be worried for their team, less than 18 months after they won the Ligue 1 title in style. ""I was aware that it would be hard to put something in place after just two days of work,"" said Henry at the weekend, having had limited time on the training ground since taking over. Better will be required, however, if Monaco are to register their first points in Champions League Group A when they go to Belgium. For Henry, it is an early return to the country after he ended a two-year stint as assistant to Belgium boss Roberto Martinez in order to strike out on his own. Defeats against Atletico Madrid and Borussia Dortmund mean Monaco remain pointless in Europe, and Wednesday's match against the Belgian champions offers both sides a last chance to keep their hopes alive in the group. More realistically, these teams are now fighting it out for third place and a berth in the Europa League knockout rounds. They meet again at the Stade Louis II on November 6. ""We need to take the positives. The team is starting from zero,"" insisted Belgian midfielder Youri Tielemans, but there were not a lot of positives from Henry's debut. He took a risk by starting Radamel Falcao on his return from international duty, and the Colombian duly came off injured before half-time. With two experienced goalkeepers sidelined in Danijel Subasic and Diego Benaglio, the 22-year-old Seydou Sy started and his mistake gifted the hosts their opener. In the second half, Henry sent on Samuel Grandsir only for the talented youngster to be sent off within three minutes of his introduction. It was a terrible start for France's all-time leading goal-scorer, but now he is hoping to lead Monaco to a first win in 11 Champions League outings. The circumstances are daunting, but Henry -- who won the Champions League as a player with Barcelona -- knew what he was signing up for at Monaco, having turned down the Bordeaux job at the start of this season. ""It is different because now he is the one making all the decisions, but he has a philosophy that I think can help us start winning matches,"" said Nacer Chadli, who has worked with Henry in the Belgium set-up. Whether that will be the case on Wednesday remains to be seen, with last season's star player Rony Lopes still absent and Falcao a doubt. Meanwhile, with Sy not in Monaco's Champions League squad, it looks like the 20-year-old Loic Badiashile, who usually plays in the French fourth tier for Monaco's reserves, will start in goal at the Jan Breydelstadion."
74,22/10/2018,00:06,Vieira's Nice continue to struggle with Marseille loss,Patrick Vieira's Nice slumped to a fourth defeat in five home league games this season as Morgan Sanson's first-half strike fired Marseille to a 1-0 win in Ligue 1 on Sunday.,"It was a laboured performance from Nice, who sit 14th in the table and only two points above the relegation play-off spot, eight points adrift of fourth-placed Marseille. Vieira may need a good run of results if he is to keep his job long enough to take on former Arsenal and France teammate Thierry Henry when his side visit Monaco on December 8. ""Unfortunately, tonight's match reflects our other home games,"" said Vieira. ""(Forwards) Allan (Saint-Maximin), Mario (Balotelli) and Myziane (Maolida) have not been successful. In the last 30 metres there has been a lack of quality, we haven't always made the right choices."" For Marseille, all eyes will now be on next Sunday's clash with arch rivals and runaway league leaders Paris Saint-Germain at the Velodrome. The hosts went into the match having mustered only seven goals in nine league games this season, and Vieira responded by handing Mario Balotelli just his third start of the campaign up front. The first decent chance at the Allianz Riviera fell to the Italy international, but after latching onto a long ball forward from Dante his well-struck volley was kept out by the legs of Marseille goalkeeper Steve Mandanda. A clever dummy from Balotelli created space for Allan Saint-Maximin, but his shot was tame and easily gathered by Mandanda. The away side grabbed the lead in the 42nd minute, though, as full-back Bouna Sarr skipped clear down the right-hand side and crossed for Sanson to smartly turn and fire into the bottom corner. Nice plugged away in search of an equaliser but never looked like having the quality to break through, with centre-back Dante's looping volley onto the roof of the net the best effort Vieira's men could muster. Balotelli, who was strongly linked with Marseille during the close-season before opting to stay at Nice, has failed to score this term after netting 43 goals over the last two campaigns. ""Mario? He was just like the team -- very good in the first half, then he wasn't as good. He still has to work,"" said Vieira. Earlier on Sunday, Montpellier moved into third as goals from Gaetan Laborde and Andy Delort sealed a 2-0 win over Bordeaux, while Saint-Etienne drew 1-1 against Rennes. Henry suffered a miserable return to French football on Saturday as Monaco lost at Strasbourg in his first match as a head coach, while PSG thrashed Amiens to make it 10 successive wins to start the season."
75,21/10/2018,00:18,"Henry suffers defeat on Monaco return, PSG seal perfect 10","A ""positive"" Thierry Henry suffered defeat in his first match as a head coach when his 10-man Monaco side slumped to a 2-1 loss at Strasbourg on Saturday to drop into the Ligue 1 relegation zone, while Paris Saint-Germain eased to a 10th straight victory to start their title defence.","The principality club have failed to win in 11 games in all competitions since the opening weekend of the French top-flight season, and are only above bottom team Guingamp on goal difference. Monaco, who were runners-up to PSG last season, are now 24 points adrift of the reigning champions after they cruised to a 5-0 thrashing of Amiens at the Parc des Princes despite resting several key players. A dreadful error by Monaco's third-choice goalkeeper Seydou Sy gifted Strasbourg midfielder Adrien Thomasson an early opener, and substitute Samuel Grandsir was sent off midway through the second half. Lebo Mothiba doubled the advantage, and a late Youri Tielemans penalty was a mere consolation for the 2017 Ligue 1 title-winners. ""It wasn't easy, we tried to put something in place which worked at the beginning, and then we conceded that goal that I don't need to describe... Human error, I don't want to wipe the floor with anyone,"" said the 41-year-old Henry. ""Then we tried to change the game, and unfortunately Sam (Grandsir) is sent off. After that it was even harder, but we still tried to keep playing. ""But I want to keep positive despite the negatives... The game could have turned in our favour, but it didn't. In addition, we lost (Radamel) Falcao at the beginning. It wasn't the dream scenario."" Henry -- a World Cup winner and Arsenal's all-time record goalscorer who started his playing career at Monaco -- made four changes to the team which lost to Rennes before the international break, with former Manchester City and Inter Milan striker Stevan Jovetic restored up front. But his new side got off to the worst possible start as they handed Strasbourg a 17th-minute lead. Kenny Lala's long ball forward was nodded hopefully towards goal by Thomasson, but Senegalese 'keeper Sy -- who was only playing due to injures to Diego Benaglio and Danijel Subasic -- comically fumbled the ball over his own line. A disappointing first half ended poorly for Henry and Monaco, as captain and star striker Radamel Falcao was forced off injured. It was proving a miserable debut for Henry, as just two minutes after being brought on as a substitute, Grandsir was given a straight red card for catching Anthony Goncalves in the hip with a high boot, with the Strasbourg winger collapsing to the ground holding his face. As the visitors pushed for an equaliser, they were hit on the counter-attack in the 84th minute as South African international Mothiba raced clear before a cute lob gave him his seventh goal of the season for club and country. Tielemans pulled one back with an injury-time spot-kick after Moussa Sylla was brought down in the area, but it proved too little, too late. Paris Saint-Germain continued the blistering start to their Ligue 1 title defence as Kylian Mbappe scored again earlier on Saturday. Coach Thomas Tuchel left key men Neymar, Thiago Silva and Thomas Meunier out of the squad altogether at the Parc des Princes with Wednesday's Champions League clash with Napoli in mind, but PSG had more than enough to see off Amiens. ""Everyone thinks that Ligue 1 might be too easy to prepare for the Champions League, but it's not like that,"" insisted Tuchel, who took over the reins from Unai Emery in the close-season. ""That would mean you're blaming the other teams, but we focus on ourselves. Nobody won 10 games in a row, and we did it."" Brazilian centre-back Marquinhos nodded the hosts into a 12th-minute lead and Adrien Rabiot made it two shortly before half-time. Germany winger Julian Draxler grabbed the third headed goal of the game, and the 19-year-old Mbappe fired in late on to score his ninth goal in just six league outings this season. Moussa Diaby came off the bench to complete the rout as the capital-city giants maintained their eight-point lead over Lille at the top of the table."
76,19/10/2018,03:44,Henry makes Ligue 1 return with freefalling Monaco,"Thierry Henry returns to Ligue 1 for the first time in 19 years this weekend, tasked with dragging a crisis-hit Monaco away from the relegation zone after a miserable start to the season.","The Arsenal great came through the youth system at the principality club in the 1990s, and is now mirroring the start of his playing career with his first job as a head coach, after a two-year spell as assistant to Roberto Martinez with the Belgian national side. The 41-year-old has a difficult job ahead of him, with Monaco occupying the relegation play-off spot and only above the bottom two on goal difference, and he knows that his immediate job is just to arrest the slide. ""How do you define success? It's difficult. At a big European club success is winning the Champions League,"" said Henry ahead of his first game in charge at Strasbourg on Saturday. ""At other clubs, it's winning the league or helping players get better. ""Long term, it's really far away when I know the situation we're in here and what we need to do."" Leonardo Jardim was sacked as Monaco boss last week after a hugely successful spell in charge which saw the club win the French title in 2017 and finish as runners-up to Paris Saint-Germain last season, but the constant changes of playing personnel eventually got the better of him. Monaco have gone 10 matches without a win since beating Nantes on the opening weekend of the Ligue 1 season, including home defeats by Angers and Rennes in recent weeks. Their fans will be desperately hoping that Henry, who scored over 400 goals in a glittering playing career, can coax the best out of under-performing youngsters like Youri Tielemans and Aleksandr Golovin. ""For me, a coach is supposed to make people better first and foremost,"" 1998 World Cup winner Henry said. ""Improving players for me is already a success, but then you have different types of success."" PSG host Amiens on Saturday eyeing a record-extending 10th straight win to start the season after Kylian Mbappe's four-goal heroics inspired a 5-0 thrashing of Lyon before the international break. The teenager ran riot at the Parc des Princes that day, saying that he ""should have scored more"", and Amiens will be hoping Mbappe, Neymar and Edinson Cavani are distracted by Wednesday's Champions League clash with Napoli. The French striker has already scored 10 goals in just seven matches for PSG this term, and even featured on the front cover of Time magazine earlier this month. The capital-city giants broke the 82-year-old record held by Olympique Lillois for most consecutive victories at the start of a French top-flight campaign, and coach Thomas Tuchel gave the players who were not on international duty the week off as reward. With the title already all but in the bag, it could be tempting for PSG to take their foot off the pedal and focus on European matters, but the runaway leaders have shown no signs of that so far, netting 32 times. With Lyon and Monaco both out of sorts, Lille have taken the early advantage in the race to qualify for the Champions League -- Christophe Galtier's men sit second, eight points adrift of PSG and three clear of Marseille. The 25-year-old winger has been in red-hot form since the start of last season, and his Marseille side make the short trip to take on Patrick Vieira's Nice on Sunday. Thauvin, who has scored 44 league goals since returning to France in 2016 after an ill-fated spell at Newcastle, will be looking to make a point after an underwhelming display in France's friendly draw with Iceland.

77,17/10/2018,17:42,Henry hopeful playing success rubs off on Monaco,Thierry Henry hopes his illustrious playing days will help underpin a successful career in management as he embarks on his first top job in club football at Monaco.,"The 41-year-old French World Cup winner, who had been working as an assistant to Belgium coach Roberto Martinez since 2016, returned to the club where he began his professional career after replacing Leonardo Jardim. Henry scored a record 51 goals in 123 appearances for France, winning not only the 1998 World Cup but also Euro 2000, while starring for almost a decade at Arsenal before claiming the treble with Barcelona in 2009. ""I hope it will be an advantage,"" Henry said on Wednesday, when asked how his success as a player would serve him as a manager. ""But that doesn't mean it's going to be easy because of that. I think it will help. But there are some great managers who haven't played football, and vice versa."" The former striker will be joined at Monaco by Joao Carlos Valado Tralhao, under-23 coach at Benfica, and Patrick Kwame Ampadu, coach at Arsenal's academy and father of Chelsea player Ethan Ampadu. Henry graduated from Monaco's youth system and made his debut for the club in 1994. ""To have the chance to come back is incredible,"" he said. ""When the offer came it seemed logical to me, it was the choice of my heart. You know my fondness for London, but here is where I started."" Henry's first game in charge will be against Strasbourg in the league on Saturday with a must-win Champions League tie against Club Brugge four days later. However, he was reluctant to look too far ahead with Monaco languishing 18th in the league after just one win in 12 matches in all competitions this season. ""For me, a coach is supposed to make people better first and foremost,"" Henry said. ""Improving players for me is already a success, but then you have different types of success. ""How do you define success? It's difficult. At a big European club success is winning the Champions League. At other clubs, it's winning the league or helping players get better. ""Long term, it's really far away when I know the situation we're in here and what we need to do."" Jardim guided Monaco to the Ligue 1 title in 2017 but was sacked last week after a string of poor results. Club vice-president Vadim Vasilyev said there were no fixed goals for Henry, who follows former international team-mates Didier Deschamps, Zinedine Zidane and Patrick Vieira into management. ""We haven't set any objectives for Thierry Henry. Given we're 18th in the table today, it's difficult to set an objective,"" said Vasilyev. ""We need to get out of the relegation zone for a start. We're not thinking about the end of the season, we're only thinking about getting out of this difficult situation."""
78,13/10/2018,12:27,"An on-field great, Henry returns to France to prove himself in coaching","Having left France as a young World Cup winner in 1999, Thierry Henry returns almost two decades later hoping his appointment by Monaco can mark the start of a successful coaching career.","Now 41, Henry was named as the new coach of the Ligue 1 side on Saturday, replacing Leonardo Jardim, who was sacked in midweek following a string of poor results that left Monaco languishing in 18th in the league. Henry was one of the greatest players of his generation, the all-time leading goal-scorer for both Arsenal and the French national team, but he has been building towards this moment for several years now. After retiring from playing in 2014 at the end of four years with New York Red Bulls, Henry has divided his time between coaching and punditry work with British broadcaster Sky. He has acquired his coaching badges, and spent the last two years working as an assistant to Roberto Martinez with the Belgian national team. Henry's input as an attacking coach during Belgium's run to the World Cup semi-finals -- where they lost to France -- made an impression on the players he worked with. ""He loves football, he loves talking about what he has done, how things used to be, about his first World Cup. He has given me lots of advice to help me improve,"" said Michy Batshuayi. He had been combining that role with an extremely well remunerated job for Sky, where his comments were not always to the liking of his old Arsenal and Monaco mentor, Arsene Wenger -- Henry expressed concerns about the direction Arsenal were taking towards the end of Wenger's long reign, which came to an end in May. It is hard to imagine that Henry has not set his sights on one day managing Arsenal himself, given his association with a club he represented with such distinction for eight years that there is now a statue of him outside the Emirates Stadium. ""Over the last 4 years I have had some extremely rewarding coaching experiences in football. These experiences have only made me more determined to fulfil my long term ambition to become a football manager,"" Henry wrote on Twitter this summer, announcing his decision to quit his work as a pundit. Born in the Paris suburbs to parents from the French Caribbean islands of Guadeloupe and Martinique, Henry began his playing career with Monaco, making his debut in 1994, aged 17. His full France debut came aged 20 in 1997, and the following year he scored three goals as Les Bleus won the World Cup as hosts. Henry also won Euro 2000 with his country and scored 51 goals in 123 appearances, although his international career ended in rather sour circumstances. After his controversial handball against Ireland secured qualification for the 2010 World Cup in South Africa, Henry and France were knocked out in the group stage in a campaign marred by a player mutiny. But nothing can sour his reputation at Arsenal, whom he joined in 1999 after a brief stint at Juventus. He scored 228 goals for the Gunners, notably starring in the ""Invincibles"" team that won the league unbeaten in 2004. After leaving Arsenal in 2007, he had three years at Barcelona capped by winning the Champions League under Pep Guardiola in 2009, before finishing his career in MLS. Matching as a coach the success he enjoyed as a player will not be easy, and he steps into a difficult environment at Monaco, who reached the 2017 Champions League semi-finals but find themselves rooted in a landscape dominated by Paris Saint-Germain. But the job offers Henry the chance to show the French public what they mostly missed during a playing career in which he was perhaps underappreciated at home, certainly compared to his teammate Zinedine Zidane. ""There is no doubt he has a great career ahead of him in coaching,"" said French Football Federation boss Noel Le Graet recently. Now it is up to Henry to prove it."
79,11/10/2018,14:28,Monaco sack coach Jardim after poor Ligue 1 start,"Monaco, languishing 18th in Ligue 1, said Thursday that they have sacked Leonardo Jardim, who led them to a French title in 2017.","Monaco wished Jardim, who also led the club to a Champions League semi-final in 2017, and his staff ""the best for the future."" The club from the principality would not comment on a replacement, but their former player Thierry Henry has been linked to the job. Henry was youth player with the club and scored seven goals in the 1997-8 Champions League as another talented Monaco team, this one coached by Arsene Wenger, reached the semi-finals, where they lost to Juventus. He was then sold to the Turin club and went on to a successful spell with Arsenal in England and World Cup and Euro-2000 winners medals with France. Henry is an assistant coach with Belgium, which finished third in the summer's World Cup. He has recently been linked with jobs at Aston Villa and Bordeaux, but in both cases negotiations broke down after initial meetings. Jardim was at Monaco since 2014 and was under contract until 2020. The 44-year-old Portuguese coach had to cope with the sale of many of the stars of his title-winning squad over the last two seasons. This summer Thomas Lemar, Joao Moutinho and Fabinho followed earlier departures Kylian Mbappe, Benjamin Mendy, Bernardo Silva, Tiemoue Bakayoko and Valere Germain out of the club in lucrative transfers. Monaco lost their last game 1-0 at home to humble Angers and have not won in Ligue 1 since their opening match and have lost both their Champions League group games. Against Angers, the only key members of the title-winning team to feature were skipper Radamel Falcao and the defensive trio of Jemerson, Kamil Glik and Djibril Sidibe. Meanwhile, a summer spending spree headed by the signing of Russian World Cup star Aleksandr Golovin has not yet produced positive results for a club owned by Russian billionaire Dmitry Rybolovlev. ""I would like to salute Leonardo with the utmost respect for all the work done,"" AS Monaco Vice-President Vadim Vasilyev said in a statement. ""His brief time will remain as one of the most beautiful pages in the history of the club. Leonardo will always be part of the family of AS Monaco."" Monaco's next match, after the international break, is on October 20 away to Strasbourg in Ligue 1."
80,07/10/2018,20:13,Monaco crash again as Halilhodzic loses Nantes debut,"Monaco slumped to a fifth defeat in nine Ligue 1 matches as Hatem Ben Arfa earned Rennes a 2-1 victory on Sunday, while ex-Japan coach Vahid Halilhodzic was beaten 3-0 on his return to French football following his appointment at former club Nantes.","Defender Damien Da Silva turned home a Ben Arfa corner to give Rennes, who arrived in the principality just two points above 18th-placed Monaco, the lead on 14 minutes. Monaco's Andrea Raggi was sent off for throwing a punch at Clement Grenier just before half-time, but the home side levelled early in the second half through Radamel Falcao. However, Rennes secured a first win in five games as Monaco goalkeeper Danijel Subasic allowed Ben Arfa's powerful 25-yard drive to zip past him on 77 minutes, giving the former Paris Saint-Germain outcast his first league goal since April 2016. Leonardo Jardim's Monaco, runners-up to PSG last season, remain winless since the opening weekend and above the automatic relegation spots only on goal difference. Earlier, Franco-Bosnian Halilhodzic watched his Nantes side slide to a heavy defeat at Bordeaux on a day to forget for on-loan Chelsea defender Matt Miazga. The colourful 66-year-old Halilhodzic replaced Miguel Cardoso on Tuesday just eight games into the season, with Nantes having won just once in the Portuguese's brief spell in charge. Halilhodzic won a Ligue 1 title as a striker with Nantes in the 1980s, and later went on to coach Lille and Rennes but has not worked in France since he was fired by PSG in 2005. Since then he has coached clubs in Turkey, Croatia and Saudi Arabia. He also managed the national teams of Ivory Coast, Algeria -- who he led to the knockout rounds at the 2014 World Cup -- and Japan, where he was fired after guiding the Blue Samurai to qualification for this year's finals in Russia. Nantes' rotten run showed no sign of abating though as Yann Karamoh curled in a brilliant opening goal after just five minutes. They quickly found themselves two down after a mix-up between goalkeeper Ciprian Tatarusanu and US international Miazga allowed Francois Kamano to take full advantage. Kamano struck again in a torrid first half for the visitors, winning and converting a penalty after a rash challenge from Miazga to move onto a joint-best seven league goals this term. ""This performance worries me. When one is subjected to such tactical and technical domination you understand why Nantes are in this position,"" said Halilhodzic. ""If someone else had offered me this, I would never come. But I couldn't refuse for Nantes. There's still a considerable amount of work to be done."" Marseille rebounded from throwing away a two-goal lead at Apollon Limassol in the Europa League to climb third following a 2-0 victory over Caen. Kostas Mitroglou and Florian Thauvin bagged first-half goals at the Velodrome, the latter moving level with Kamano, Neymar and Jonathan Bamba atop the goalscoring chart. Thomas Tuchel's PSG will bid for a record ninth consecutive win to start the season at home to Lyon later, having matched the mark set by Olympique Lillois in 1936 last weekend."

Messi, who had earlier twice hit the post, then got on the scoresheet in between goals from Harry Kane and Erik Lamela, before the Argentina superstar grabbed his second late on to seal victory. ""After a few bad results it was important to do well today. Our response was very good,"" said Barca coach Ernesto Valverde. Barca head Group B on six points alongside Inter Milan, but Mauricio Pochettino's side face a vital double-header against PSV Eindhoven after failing to collect a point from their opening two matches. The Tottenham boss admitted Spurs had few answers for Messi as his team was left with an uphill struggle to reach the knockout stages. ""He's a fantastic player,"" said Pochettino. ""His average performance is this type of game. He's always above everything."" Inter, the last Italian club to win the Champions League in 2010, again recovered from a goal down to beat PSV 2-1 in the Netherlands. A cracking Pablo Rosario strike put PSV ahead, but Inter levelled through Radja Nainggolan moments after visiting goalkeeper Samir Handanovic somehow escaped a red card for handling outside his area. Mauro Icardi, whose late goal stunned Spurs a fortnight ago, was the hero again for Luciano Spalletti's men as he pounced on hesitant defending to net the winner on the hour. PSG rebounded from their 3-2 defeat by Liverpool with an attacking masterclass against 1991 European Cup winners Red Star at the Parc des Princes. Neymar curled in a sublime free-kick to open the scoring on 20 minutes, quickly doubling his tally before Edinson Cavani, Angel di Maria and Kylian Mbappe also found the target. Former Germany international Marko Marin popped up with a consolation for Red Star, with Neymar completing his hat-trick from another stunning free-kick. ""I really liked the effort made by the whole team, but Neymar was sensational,"" said PSG coach Thomas Tuchel. ""He is one of the best players in Europe and that is very, very important for us."" Carlo Ancelotti's Napoli top Group C on four points after Lorenzo Insigne delivered a 90th-minute winner at home to Liverpool, who are level on three alongside PSG. Dries Mertens hit the bar for Napoli late on, but there was still time for Insigne to nick all three points at the death as he slid to poke in a cross from Jose Callejon. ""Tonight we showed this group won't just be hard for Napoli, but for everyone involved,"" said Ancelotti. ""It means a lot to us to have won against the finalists from last year."" Antoine Griezmann scored two goals to lift Atletico Madrid, last season's Europa League winners, to a 3-1 victory over Club Brugge in Spain. Arnaut Groeneveld cancelled out Griezmann's opener with a thunderous strike from the left wing, but the France international restored Atletico's lead before Koke made the points safe in stoppage time. ""I said it last season and I'll say it again -- Griezmann is the best player in the world,"" said Atletico coach Diego Simeone. Borussia Dortmund lead Atletico at the top of Group A on goal difference following their 3-0 defeat of a struggling Monaco outfit. Jacob Bruun Larsen broke the deadlock in Germany shortly after his introduction as a half-time substitute, with Paco Alcacer finding the net just minutes after smacking a penalty against the bar. Marco Reus fired in a third from a Bruun Larsen cross, leaving Dortmund and Atletico on six points apiece ahead of their upcoming home-and-away meetings. In Group D, American international midfielder Weston McKennie hit an 88th-minute winner as struggling Schalke edged Lokomotiv Moscow 1-0. Porto are joint-top with Schalke following a 1-0 win over Galatasaray courtesy of Moussa Marega's second-half goal in Portugal."

The Angers defeat was played out in front of a sparse crowd of just 5,502 at the Stade Louis II, but the home fans who did turn out booed their team off, and Monaco are languishing in 16th place in Ligue 1. ""This is my fifth year in Monaco, but I think I am still getting my message across,"" said Jardim on Wednesday, after seeing his team fail to muster a shot on target against Angers. ""We are going through a difficult time, but there have been others, like in my first year when we had a very difficult start but managed to lift ourselves and bounce back."" Monaco again lost a host of key players in the close season, as has become customary at a club whose business model is centred around investing in talented youngsters who are then sold on at a profit. The list of those who have left since Monaco's title triumph last year, when they also reached the Champions League semi-finals, is remarkable. Kylian Mbappe, Benjamin Mendy, Fabinho, Joao Moutinho, Bernardo Silva, Tiemoue Bakayoko, Thomas Lemar and Valere Germain -- all regulars in that side -- have been sold. Against Angers, the only key members of the title-winning team to feature were skipper Radamel Falcao and the defensive trio of Jemerson, Kamil Glik and Djibril Sidibe. Meanwhile, a summer spending spree headed by the signing of Russian World Cup star Aleksandr Golovin has not yet produced positive results for a club owned by Russian billionaire Dmitry Rybolovlev. Monaco play Saint-Etienne this weekend and Jardim added: ""The expectations at Monaco are high, as they are for the new signings. ""Everyone knows the context at Monaco. We don't have 50,000 people in the stadium insulting the players, or 300 coming to the training ground and smashing in cars, but we need to be aware of what we represent."" It is all very dispiriting for the highly-regarded Jardim, but he says he is up for the fight. ""I have a year left on my contract. I have always respected my contract,"" said the 44-year-old. ""I have had opportunities to leave but chose to stay. I am not going to escape now."" Monaco also lost to Atletico Madrid in their opening Champions League match and their hopes of progressing to the last 16 may depend on picking up a positive result at Borussia Dortmund next week.

""It has been a very difficult start to the season for different reasons. We have had injuries, players away on international duty, poor form, the bad state of the pitch,"" he added.

In their last home league match they lost to Marseille and on Tuesday were beaten by visiting Atletico Madrid in the Champions League. Promoted Nimes took the lead after 19 minutes. Captain Anthony Briancon leapt unchallenged to meet a curling free kick from Antonin Bobichon and bulleted a header between goalkeeper Diego Benaglio's upstretched arms. It was the central defender's first goal in Ligue 1. Monaco captain Radamel Falcao levelled eight minutes later, running at a backpedalling Nimes defence and hitting a low 20-metre shot that deflected off defender Gaetan Paquiez and into the corner of the goal. Monaco dominated the game but were frustrated by a succession of saves from Nimes keeper Paul Bernadoni and by their own wastefulness. The worst misses, both from close range, were from Falcao, who volleyed against the bar, and Moussa Sylla who scooped a chance high a minute after coming on as a substitute. Monaco almost paid the price when Briancon hit the bar in added time."

That contrasted with Paris Saint-Germain's 3-2 defeat in Liverpool a day earlier, while Monaco's limits were exposed as they went down 2-1 at home to Atletico Madrid. Lyon's win was their best result in Europe since they reached the Champions League semi-finals in 2010, and came with the pressure growing on coach Bruno Genesio. Their start to the Ligue 1 season has been poor, and they are already eight points behind leaders PSG after five games. But against City, with 10 players aged 24 or under featuring in Genesio's side, Lyon demonstrated what they are capable of. Their goals came from Maxwel Cornet and captain Fekir, who shows no sign of being troubled by the knee issue that saw Liverpool pull out of a move for him in the summer. ""Nabil showed that our captain is back, well and truly back. He was decisive and was also exemplary when we didn't have the ball. I am very proud of my players,"" said Genesio. He has been in charge for two and a half years but is not popular with all supporters -- disgruntled fans have draped the Groupama stadium with banners targeting Genesio, who has also been accosted by fans while walking in the streets of the city. However, he and his team are now galvanised ahead of another huge match, when they host bitter rivals Marseille in the league. ""We need to be able to put together a run of these performances, and we will need a repeat on Sunday against a team who are of Champions League standard,"" Genesio added. Meanwhile, the inquest into PSG's defeat against Liverpool has focused largely on their problems in midfield. The defeat in itself was no disgrace, and the result may not ultimately matter, but the manner of the performance from Thomas Tuchel's side was a cause for concern. After five straight wins in Ligue 1, they were unable to deal with the step up against last season's Champions League finalists. Their star attacking trio of Neymar, Kylian Mbappe and Edinson Cavani did not perform, while they were overrun in midfield. Tuchel has publicly expressed frustration at the club's failure to sign a new holding midfielder after Thiago Motta's retirement. And while Marco Verratti was suspended at Anfield, Brazil defender Marquinhos played the holding role. ""We were maybe a bit too prudent at the end of the game, but there was also quite a lot of tiredness,"" said Thomas Meunier, and his team could have done with a player capable of holding possession. Instead, they struggled to cope with Liverpool's intensity, and they visit Rennes on Sunday stung by a fourth successive defeat in a Champions League game. Rather less was expected of Monaco. Coach Leonardo Jardim insists his side can qualify for the last 16, but they missed absentees like Rony Lopes, Aleksandr Golovin, Pietro Pellegri and Stevan Jovetic in midweek. ""Experience made the difference. I didn't think there was much between the teams,"" said Jardim, who has very few survivors from the team that reached the Champions League semi-finals in 2017. Monaco host Nimes on Friday and are in the bottom six in Ligue 1 having not won since the opening weekend. Fixtures (kick-offs GMT)"

But Costa then ran onto a wonderful flick-on from Griezmann to fire a snap-shot low and hard past Monaco's onrushing Swiss stopper Diego Benaglio to level the scores on the half-hour. Jose Maria Giminez -- remembered for crying on the pitch when France beat Uruguay 2-0 in the World Cup quarter-finals in Russia -- then headed home a corner in first-half stoppage-time to take the wind out of Monaco's sails at a key moment. The pitch cut up worryingly and groundsmen scrambled at half-time to pound in sods of detached turf. Former Monaco striker Thierry Henry and ex-coach Didier Deschamps were in the stands where just 12,000 fans showed up and amongst them a mere 80 Atletico supporters. Atletico have had a stuttering start to their La Liga campaign, and with coach Diego Simeone on the final match of a four-game touchline ban, the visitors were marshalled by the menacing bulk of his brooding assistant German Burgos prowling the line. Monaco's Polish defender Kamil Glik appeared to be relishing his role, keeping tabs on Costa and apart from the goal did a solid job on the Atletico target man. Falcao never stopped searching for an equaliser against his old club, almost earning a penalty in the 66th minute and lashing a shot just wide moments later. Glik saw a last-gasp header go just wide with the fans on their feet, but Atletico were otherwise untroubled in the latter stages. France international forward Thomas Lemar was back at the Stade Louis II after his close-season switch to Madrid and came on late as Atletico sweated out the final minutes to clinch three precious away points."

Portuguese handler Jardim was swift to recognise at a pre-match press conference that while his side had sold, Atletico had kept hold of stars such as French striker Antoine Griezmann. ""Our opponent has a depth of both talent and experience, but here there are new faces, anyone who follows football knows this,"" said Jardim. ""You might easily imagine new players need time to settle, but my players have the ambition to become a great side and to do that quickly,"" he said. ""For Tuesday against Atletico, if we keep this attitude and be more technically sound, the goal will be to win. To start the competition with a win and do everything to qualify."" Monaco however have won just one game so far this season and have just five points from five Ligue 1 outings. Monaco will now be hoping that their big guns - captain Radamel Falcao and fellow attackers Stevan Jovetic, Rony Lopes and Aleksandr Golovin - can return from injury in time for Atletico. One of Monaco's recent recruits the 21-year-old German defender Benjamin Henrichs agreed with his new coach. ""Atletico have some good players, great individuals in terms of attacking prowess. I saw them play, we are going to have to defend compactly,"" he said. ""Playing in the Champions League might be an honour in itself, but we are here to get to the next round."" Sat alongside him at the press conference Jardim nodded approval. ""We have to accept who we are, who they are and do our best, no moaning, just stay positive and ambitious."""
88,03/09/2018,00:32,Marseille come from behind to stun Monaco,Marseille came from behind to beat southern rivals Monaco 3-2 on Sunday thanks to a 90th minute winner from Valere Germain.,"Konstantinos Mitroglou kissed Dimitri Payet's right boot after his superb cross allowed the Greek to give Marseille the advantage right on half-time at the Stade Louis II. Youri Tielemans hit back for Monaco on 48 minutes before World Cup winner Adil Rami, watched by US actress girlfriend Pamela Anderson, failed to clear properly and Falcao gobbled up the loose ball to smash a shot into the roof of the net and put the home side ahead. But Florent Thauvin equalled things up from a Hiroki Sakai pass before Germain's header sneaked in at the near post to give Marseille a memorable win. Rami joked that his error ""had made a match of it, all on my own"". ""I am going to get down to work, I need to show a better side of myself,"" he said. With seven points from four games, Marseille trail leaders Paris Saint Germain, who beat Nimes 4-2 on Saturday, by five points."
89,28/08/2018,22:52,German defender Henrichs joins Monaco,"German international defender Benjamin Henrichs joined Monaco on a five-year deal from Bayern Leverkusen on Tuesday, the Ligue 1 club said, for a reported fee of 20 million euros ($23.3 million).","The versatile 21-year-old who can play at right-back, left-back or as a defensive midfielder played more than 80 matches in four seasons with the Bundesliga club. He was part of Germany's Confederations Cup-winning side in 2017 and looks likely to feature in Joachim Loew's future plans as he sheds the more experienced stars after the disastrous World Cup in Russia. ""His arrival improves the quality of our team,"" Monaco's vice-president Vadim Vasilyev said on the club's website. Henrichs said the 2017 Champions League semi-finalists ""have been a top European club for many years"". ""I'm going to do everything possible to adapt quickly,"" he added."
90,27/08/2018,00:21,Bordeaux beat Monaco and say Thierry Henry could still come,Bordeaux grabbed their first points of the season as they beat Monaco 2-1 at home on Sunday and the club's owner insisted Thierry Henry could still join as coach.,"Francois Kamano's superb curled finish in second-half injury time added to the Guinean's 48th-minute penalty for Bordeaux at the Matmut Atlantique. That spot-kick had been cancelled out by Pietro Pellegri's 63rd minute finish for Monaco but after Kamano's late piece of brilliance they slipped to their first defeat of the season. At the Velodrome, a spectacular headed own goal by Ramy Bensebaini rescued Marseille after they fell behind to Rennes. The match ended 2-2. Nicolas de Tavernost, the owner of Bordeaux until the end of September, said ""all options are open"" following French media reports Sunday that former Monaco and Arsenal great Henry had turned down an offer to become coach. The club is in the process of firing previous manager Gus Poyet. ""No decision until next week,"" de Tavernost said. ""We are working day and night to have the best coach possible."" ""It's not easy."" Earlier in the day Paris Match magazine said 41-year-old Henry intended to say 'no' to Bordeaux at the start of next week because of the ""lack of certainty over the club's future"". French TV station Canal Plus also reported that Henry would rebuff the approach. De Tavernost's TV station M6, which has owned Bordeaux since 1999, has agreed to sell the club to US investment fund GACP. Poyet was suspended by Bordeaux last week following a public row with the board over transfer dealings, and on Friday morning, the Uruguayan met president Stephane Martin at the club's Chateau du Haillan base. On the Cote d'Azur, Marseille were ragged in the first half as World Cup winner Adil Rami conceded a penalty converted by Benjamin Bourigeaud and reserve goalkeeper Yohann Pele then spilled the ball into the path of Ismaila Sarr. Argentinian winger Lucas Ocampos pulled one back in the 54th minute before Algerian international defender Bensebaini directed a header into his own net, giving Marseille a share of the points. Marseille look set to be boosted by the arrival of Dutch midfielder Kevin Strootman from Roma after the Italian club's coach Eusebio Di Francesco said Sunday that ""negotiations are in progress"" with the Ligue 1 club."
91,13/08/2018,18:23,Senegal attacker Keita Balde returns to Italy with ambitious Inter,"Inter Milan on Monday continued their strong summer transfer window ahead of the start of the Serie A season, announcing the return to Italy of Senegal international Keita Balde on loan from French Ligue 1 side Monaco.","Ambitious Inter, who have been busy in the transfer market after finishing fourth in Serie A last season and qualifying for the Champions League for the first time since 2011, have brought in the 23-year-old former Lazio striker for a reported initial five million euros ($5.7 million). The fee will rise to 39 million euros should the Serie A club exercise an option to buy next summer, according to Italian media. ""The forward Keita Balde Diao is a new Nerazzurri player. The Senegalese has signed for Inter from Monaco on a year-long loan with an option to make the deal permanent,"" Inter said in a statement. Balde rose to prominence at Lazio in 2016-17, when he scored 16 goals in 31 league appearances -- 10 of which were from the bench -- before sinking into a contract row at the start of last season and leaving for France. Last term he scored eight goals and provided five assists in 23 Ligue 1 appearances as Monaco finished second behind champions Paris Saint-Germain. Balde joins fellow Inter newcomers Radja Nainggolan, signed from rivals Roma, promising Argentine attacker Lautaro Martinez and Dutch international centre-back Stefan de Vrij. They have also brought in right-back Sime Vrsaljko, who started in six of Croatia's seven matches in their run to the World Cup final, on loan from Atletico Madrid."

Di Maria's thunderous free-kick opened the scoring on 33 minutes in searing heat and he grabbed PSG's fourth in injury time following strikes from youngsters Christopher Nkunku and Timothy Weah. It was a comprehensive win for the reigning French champions in the season's curtain-raiser, even without Kylian Mbappe and Edinson Cavani who are yet to return after the World Cup. PSG start their Ligue 1 title defence on Sunday, August 12, with a home match against Caen. ""I'm very happy, because we won our first final. It's great, winning 4-0 is incredible,"" said the 44-year-old Tuchel. ""I really like the fact that we played as a team. It was a very young team and the conditions were very hard, but we played with a lot of intensity."" Former Borussia Dortmund boss Tuchel was drenched in champagne by his players during his post-match press conference, like Didier Deschamps was after France's World Cup triumph last month. Captain Thiago Silva said he hopes there is plenty more to come from his new coach, as big-spending PSG look to finally make a mark in the Champions League. ""It's good, he's brought in a lot of positive things, responsibility, but always trying to be happy,"" said Brazil centre-back Silva. ""I think that everyone deserved this result, especially the staff who have arrived, brought a lot of positive things and changed a lot. ""I hope it's just the beginning."" PSG, with their names in Chinese characters on the back of their shirts, were the aggressors and they took the lead via Di Maria's sumptuous strike. The Argentina winger swept the ball over the wall and into the top right corner from 25 metres, evading Diego Benaglio's despairing dive. As Tuchel watched while sitting on an ice box in the technical area, Nkunku made it 2-0 on 40 minutes with a close-range finish from Stanley Nsoki's inviting cross. Weah, son of former PSG star and Liberian President George Weah, went close and Di Maria then left Benaglio nursing sore fingers with a powerful drive as the capital-city club went into half-time firmly in control. The 18-year-old Weah put the win beyond doubt in the 67th minute when he stroked home Nsoki's pull-back to score his first PSG goal, before Nkunku rattled the crossbar from close range shortly afterwards. Italian goalkeeping great Gianluigi Buffon was rarely troubled on his competitive debut, with Stevan Jovetic an isolated figure up front for Monaco in the absence of captain Radamel Falcao and several other key players. There were loud cheers from the 41,000-strong Shenzhen crowd when Neymar was introduced on 76 minutes but the world's most expensive player, last seen in Brazil's World Cup quarter-final loss to Belgium, couldn't add his name to the scoresheet. Di Maria, deservedly, had the last word when Adrien Rabiot's long run set him up for an easy finish which he slotted past the beleaguered Benaglio in the third added minute."

The 22-year-old joined Monaco from Rennes last season, but made just 10 Ligue 1 starts. He netted three goals in all competitions for Monaco and made five Champions League appearances. Diakhaby will now head to Germany to link up with his new Huddersfield team-mates at their training camp. ""I'm very happy to be able to welcome Adama to Huddersfield Town today,"" Huddersfield manager David Wagner said. ""He is a very hungry young footballer with a strong desire to succeed in England, which is fantastic for our club. ""Obviously he is still learning and improving at 22-years-old, but he already has many of the qualities that we look for in our attacking players.

""The arrival of Willem Geubbels proves our ambition to develop the best talent in European football at our club,"" director Vadim Vasilyev said via the club's website. ""With patience and work we are sure he'll get to the top,"" he added. Geubbels himself said he couldn't wait to get started. ""I'm ready and really determined to help make great things happen,"" he told the Monaco site. Monaco bought Anthony Martial from Lyon for 5 million euros in 2013 and sold him to Manchester United for around 70 million in 2015 when he was 19. Monaco are also due to complete the 180 million euros sale of 19-year-old Kylian Mbappe to Paris Saint-Germain.

The 16-month sentence was commuted to a 96,000-euro fine.

101,05/05/2018,02:10,Five things to watch out for in Ligue 1 this weekend,"Fresh from becoming the first French side to reach a European final since 2004 with their Europa League victory over Salzburg, Marseille turn their attentions back to the fight for a top-three spot in Ligue 1 this weekend.","Rudi Garcia's men are locked in a fight with Lyon and Monaco for the two Champions League spots behind champions Paris Saint-Germain, with just two points separating the three clubs. Here are five things to watch out for in Ligue 1 this weekend: Monaco will have to make do without injured captain Radamel Falcao as they bid to end a three-match winless streak which has dragged them into the battle for the top three. Falcao will sit out Sunday's visit to Caen with a thigh injury, while Leonardo Jardim is also missing Keita Balde, Stevan Jovetic and Adama Diakhaby. Those injury woes could mean a full debut for 18-year-old Moussa Sylla in one of Monaco's biggest games of the season after a dreadful run which was kicked off by the calamitous 7-1 thrashing by PSG. The player to watch in Ligue 1 at the moment is undoubtedly Lyon's Memphis Depay. The Dutch forward had an up-and-down start to the season but has exploded into life since scoring a dramatic late winner against Marseille in March. The 24-year-old, who struggled after a big-money move to Manchester United three years ago, has now scored seven goals and assisted six in his last six league matches. A goal against relegation-threatened Troyes on Sunday would take him to 20 in all competitions for the season for the first time since his last campaign at PSV Eindhoven in 2014/15. Garcia's revolution is well underway at Marseille, with the former European champions on the brink of a return to the continent's premier competition. Victory in the Europa League final over Atletico Madrid in Lyon on May 16 would secure a Champions League spot for next season, but Monaco's recent slump has also boosted their chances of qualifying through Ligue 1. Marseille have not played in the Champions League since losing all six of their group-stage matches in 2013, but Rolando's extra-time strike in Salzburg on Thursday kept them fighting on two fronts, and they host Nice in the pick of the weekend's matches on Sunday. Like Marseille, Lille went into this season expecting a revival after an influx of new players under Marcelo Bielsa, but instead face the ingnominy of dropping out of the top flight for the first time since being promoted in 2000. Argentinian Bielsa has been locked in a bitter legal battle with the club since being sacked last December, while the team has never managed to get out of trouble. Christophe Galtier's side head to fellow strugglers Toulouse knowing that defeat would leave their fate out of their own hands. Lille sit second-bottom in the table, two points adrift of 17th-placed Toulouse and behind Troyes, who occupy the relegation play-off place, on goal difference. In February Saint-Etienne were fighting to avoid the drop, but head into their clash with Bordeaux in fifth place and leading Nice and Rennes by one point in the race for the Europa League. They are unbeaten in 13 league matches, having won just once in their previous 13 outings. Ligue 1 fixtures on Sunday (all times GMT) Saint-Etienne v Bordeaux (1300), Lyon v Troyes (1430), Caen v Monaco, Dijon v Guingamp, Metz v Angers, Nantes v Montpellier, Rennes v Strasbourg, Toulouse v Lille (all 1500), Marseille v Nice (1905)"
102,20/04/2018,02:15,Jardim tells Monaco to wake up after PSG nightmare,Monaco coach Leonardo Jardim challenged his players to swiftly bury the embarrassment of last week's 7-1 defeat by Paris Saint-Germain to stay on course for automatic Champions League qualification.,"PSG reclaimed the Ligue 1 title -- their fifth in six seasons -- after thrashing last year's champions Monaco at the Parc des Princes, but Jardim is confident it won't derail their season. Monaco hold a four-point cushion over Lyon and Marseille in the race for second place with five matches remaining, starting with Saturday's trip to Guingamp. ""It's a difficult match to digest,"" Jardim said of the rout that ended Monaco's 17-match unbeaten league run. ""We're not used to conceding seven goals. We're aware that we didn't give our all. We should have done better. We got our message across. ""I'm going to cite Confucius: 'Our greatest glory is not in never falling, but in rising every time we fall,'"" he added, invoking the teachings of the ancient Chinese philosopher. ""We have five finals to play now. The fight for second place is going to be a battle until the finish."" Lyon could close to within a point of Monaco on Friday if Bruno Genesio's side register a sixth win in a row at Dijon. Their push for a Champions League berth was boosted by the return last of captain Nabil Fekir last time out following a seven-week absence due to a knee injury. ""We're worried about the battle with Marseille for third,"" Genesio said. ""We don't control anything with Monaco, they're a very experienced side capable of getting back on the right track. ""It's very important to keep hold of third place. Nothing is achieved yet. There are 15 points to play for and that's a lot. It's going to be very tight right up until the end."" Marseille host Lille on Saturday with the visitors scrapping for top-flight survival following a 10-match winless run that has left the 2011 champions mired in the relegation play-off place. Rudi Garcia has a delicate juggling act to manage ahead of Marseille's first leg of their Europa League semi-final against Salzburg at the Velodrome next Thursday. Champions PSG continue the quest to break their record 96-point tally from the 2015/16 campaign away to Bordeaux, while Saint-Etienne will look to extend their 11-match unbeaten run amid a tense Europa League race. Largely frozen out at Arsenal for 18 months, the extraordinary rebirth of Mathieu Debuchy at Saint-Etienne has thrust the right-back into contention for a place in France's World Cup squad. After just 16 minutes of first-team action in the 2016-17 campaign, Debuchy was limited to a handful of Europa League and domestic cup matches this season before joining Saint-Etienne on a free transfer in January. But a haul of four goals in 10 games in Ligue 1 has forced Didier Deschamps to take notice, with Debuchy's case for inclusion in Russia growing further after an injury to Djibril Sidibe of Monaco. ""He's the type of player used to playing matches at a high level,"" Saint-Etienne coach Jean-Louis Gasset said recently of the 32-year-old Debuchy, who played at Euro 2012 and the 2014 World Cup. ""It's always been my goal to get back into the France team ever since I was no longer part of it. There was a time where I couldn't hope of it because I wasn't playing. Now that I'm playing, yes, I'm hoping for it,"" Debuchy said earlier this month. Fixtures (all times GMT)"
103,14/04/2018,13:41,Areola demands respect if PSG win French league,"When Paris Saint-Germain host Monaco on Sunday seeking to seal the Ligue 1 title, Alphonse Areola will be living his dream, but the young 'keeper still faces challenges.","First, he has to keep out Monaco, who last season ended PSG's run of four consecutive titles and this time sit second, 14 points behind with six rounds to play. ""Last year they took the title from us and that hurt us because this club is in the habit of winning the league every year,"" the 25-year old told AFP in an interview. ""So it's even more symbolic against them. We have the chance to bring the title back to Paris."" ""Last season a new coach and new players had come in and it was necessary to adapt,"" he said. ""This season we have gelled."" He also wants outsiders to treat a French league title for PSG with respect. ""People are trivialising this title too much,"" Areola said. ""You have to be consistent and perform well over the entire season."" Areola is a ""child of the club."" His parents came to France from the Philippines and he was born and grew up in Paris, playing for the ""Little Angels"" youth team on the Left Bank before joining PSG at the age of 13. ""Playing for my club, that's exceptional and I'm clearly living my dream,"" he said. ""Now, chasing trophies, that's even better. Areola went out on loan for three consecutive seasons at Lens, Bastia and Villarreal. He returned last season and was initially behind the German Kevin Trapp. Areola took over and kept four clean sheets in eight games but then came a disastrous run when he let in 10 goals on 11 shots as PSG failed to win in three straight league games in December. ""I had no doubts, doubt is a big word and it's for the weak, let's say,"" he said. ""I continued to work. I did not let go. Some might have gone down, but I'm proud to say that I managed to come through it."" This season Areola has become the regular starter but he is not an established star of the sort PSG covet. Atletico Madrid's Jan Oblak, Milan's teenage phenomenon Gianluigi Donnarumma and Chelsea's Thibaut Courtois are among the many rumoured to be on their way to supplant Areola. ""If the club is looking for someone else, that's not my choice,"" he said. ""But if they announce someone else is coming in, I will be even more motivated."" PSG's spending means Areola is playing behind one of the most expensive lineups in football history after the club added Neymar, Dani Alves and Kylian Mbappe last summer. ""It brings even more renown to the club when great players come in, even if there have been always very, very great players here,"" he said. ""But the arrival of two experienced players, and one who is going to become a force was a plus for the club."" Those players were bought with the Champions League in mind, but after edging Bayern Munich to win their group, PSG were eliminated in the first knock out round by the two-time defending champions. ""We won our group, which was the objective, but then we were drawn against Real Madrid,"" he said ""They have the experience in this competition. I'm not saying we don't, but they have the habit of winning. That was perhaps the difference."" Areola has been called up to the French squad by Didier Deschamps, although he has yet to make an appearance he is likely to make the cut for the France squad going to the World Cup this summer. ""I believe in my ability to be in the 23,"" he said. ""But nothing can be taken for granted... until the list is out, I will not be sure."" ""To be part of the squad is already huge and to be part of the 23 going to the World Cup would be even more magnificent."" Hugo Lloris, who has 96 caps, and Steve Mandanda (26 caps) were the other two goalies in the last France squad in March. ""I am behind two legends."" Asked if the Brazilian contingent were the most likely to bring World Cup medals back to PSG, Areola laughed. ""No. Us, the French. There are some nice teams but, look, I am French and I am for the team."""
104,13/04/2018,14:50,PSG ready to take French title back from Monaco,Paris Saint-Germain will reclaim the French title if they beat reigning champions and current second-placed side Monaco at the Parc des Princes in Ligue 1 on Sunday.,"The Qatar-backed Parisians lead Monaco by 14 points with six games to go, meaning they are on the brink of a fifth title in six seasons, despite having to cope without the injured Neymar for more than a month. The Brazilian has been in his home country recovering from a foot operation and PSG are hoping to have him back before the end of the season. ""I still need a month to make a full recovery,"" Neymar told Brazilian television on Friday. But they should be champions well before any possible return date for the world's most expensive player, and beating Monaco would be the perfect way to seal the deal. It would come a year after the side from the principality finished eight points clear of PSG at the summit in a campaign which also saw them reach the Champions League semi-finals. ""Knowing that we can be champions at home, against our main rivals this season and the team that kidnapped the title from us last season, is an exciting moment,"" defender Marquinhos told PSG TV. PSG's campaign has been overshadowed by their defeat against Real Madrid in the last 16 of the Champions League, but they are on course for a clean sweep of the domestic trophies. Unai Emery's side have a 100 percent home record and if they can keep that up they will be able to celebrate the seventh title in their history on Sunday. PSG have won their last five meetings with Leonardo Jardim's side too, including a 3-0 victory in the recent League Cup final, when Kylian Mbappe ran his old club ragged. The 19-year-old will make his loan move permanent in a 180 million-euro ($222 million) deal at the end of this season, when PSG will hope to spend big again to rebuild for another assault on Europe. PSG have two key doubts with midfield general Marco Verratti injured groin while striker Kylian Mbappé is sick. ""Marco is working with the doctor, we don't want a relapse and Kylian didn't train yesterday with a poorly stomach,"" coach Unai Emery said Friday. Ex-Borussia Dortmund boss Thomas Tuchel emerged as favourite to take over from Emery in the PSG dugout this week. In the meantime, Emery has the chance to bow out of Paris with a league title, although they will not be taking the Monaco of Radamel Falcao and the in-form Rony Lopes lightly. ""Of course, we have a lot of respect for them, but we will be at home and to have the chance to be champions again, against the reigning champions, is exciting for us, and especially for the supporters,"" Thiago Motta told PSG TV. Beneath the top two Lyon and Marseille are locked, level on points, in a fierce battle for third place and the final Champions League qualifying berth. Lyon, with Memphis Depay in superb form, have recovered from a sticky patch and sit ahead of Marseille on goal difference. OL host Amiens while Marseille travel to struggling Troyes. He can blow hot and cold, but the Dutchman really has been in superb form, and with it Lyon have hauled themselves right back into contention for a top-three finish. Depay scored one and set up the rest in Lyon's 5-0 win at Metz last weekend, having netted a brace in a 2-0 defeat of Toulouse before that. ""He is staying here, all the time, my children,"" said Lyon president Jean-Michel Aulas, attempting an answer in English, when asked on French television last weekend if he would ever sell the Dutchman to Real Madrid."
105,07/04/2018,19:04,Falcao inspires Monaco to victory over Nantes,Radamel Falcao starred as Monaco strengthed their grip on second place in Ligue 1 with a come-from-behind 2-1 victory over Nantes in the principality on Saturday.,"Captain Falcao scored one and created another as reigning champions Monaco moved eight points clear of third-placed Marseille, although they remain 14 points behind champions elect Paris Saint-Germain. Midfielder Adrien Thomasson put Nantes into a 32nd-minute lead with a magnificent strike, bringing down a long ball and firing a dipping volley over Monaco goalkeeper Danijel Subasic and into the far corner. But Monaco turned the game around in the space of three minutes before half-time. Falcao drilled in an equaliser from Rony Lopes' excellent lay-off after Fabinho's driven cross. The Colombian international, despite struggling with injuries for much of the campaign, has now scored 24 goals in all competitions this season. Portuguese winger Lopes has also been in fine form this term, and he gave Leonardo Jardim's hosts the lead with a clever turn and left-footed strike after being picked out by Falcao. Nantes hung in the game in the second half but couldn't find an equaliser, and Claudio Ranieri's men remain two points off a Europa League spot. Players and fans paid their respects before the match to Le Havre youngster Samba Diop, who died earlier on Saturday at the age of 18. The second-division French club did not state the midfielder's cause of death. ""This is a horrible moment for all the players, from the academy to the professional squad,"" the club said in a statement. PSG could seal the title next weekend when they welcome Monaco to the Parc des Princes, despite Friday's 1-1 draw at Saint-Etienne."
106,31/03/2018,23:08,PSG see off Monaco to seal fifth straight League Cup,Paris Saint-Germain claimed their fifth consecutive French League Cup title as an Edinson Cavani double helped them ease to a 3-0 victory over Monaco in Saturday's final at Bordeaux.,"The Uruguayan gave PSG an eighth-minute lead from the penalty spot after a lengthy delay for a video assistant referee review, before Angel Di Maria beat Danijel Subasic at his near post to make it two and Cavani completed the scoring late on. Kylian Mbappe was a constant menace and perhaps the difference between the two sides, as his current team beat his former club for the second successive final after last year's 4-1 victory. ""Tonight there was a great Kylian on the other side, he was the difference in the game,"" said Monaco coach Leonardo Jardim. ""I think we played with the right attitude, always tried to look for a goal after the penalty."" The capital club's win also extended their all-time record amount of League Cup crowns to eight and stretched their winning streak in domestic Cup competitions to 40 matches since a French Cup defeat by Montpellier in January 2014. The holders were awarded a spot-kick after only four minutes, as Polish centre-back Kamil Glik brought down Mbappe. After a three-minute wait for the decision to be confirmed by VAR, Cavani stepped up to beat Subasic and grab his 34th goal of the season. Monaco responded well and Belgian midfielder Youri Tielemans fired over after some quick build-up play. But PSG doubled their advantage in the 21st minute as Mbappe set Di Maria through on goal with a wonderful pass, and the Argentinian international fired a low shot under goalkeeper Subasic to score for the third League Cup final in a row. Rony Lopes wasted a golden opportunity for Monaco to halve the deficit as he chipped wide with only PSG goalkeeper Kevin Trapp to beat. Just seconds later it was Cavani's turn to squander a magnificent chance, miskicking off target after Mbappe had laid the ball on a plate for him with the goal gaping. Trapp's blushes were spared shortly afterwards, as after his error allowed a Radamel Falcao header to drop into the net, VAR ruled the goal out for offside. Jardim's Monaco put up a much better fight than 12 months ago, and Portuguese winger Lopes came agonisingly close early in the second half when his curling effort flicked the top of the crossbar. Mbappe, who joined PSG from Monaco in a 180-million-euro deal last year, continued to look dangerous but proved wasteful in front of goal as he prodded past the post just two minutes after Subasic had saved at his feet. But the 19-year-old continued to create opportunities, and it was his jinking run which ended with Cavani slotting into the corner. The striker has now scored eight goals in French League Cup finals, after previous doubles in 2014, 2015 and last year."
107,15/03/2018,14:57,Falcao back for Monaco's push for Europe,Radamel Falcao is back from injury as defending champions Monaco host struggling Lille on Friday aiming for a 15th Ligue 1 game without defeat as they target an immediate return to the Champions League.,"With Paris Saint-Germain almost certain to win the French title this year, Monaco's two rivals for second place and an automatic berth in the Champions League are Marseille and Lyon, who face off on Sunday. Leonardo Jardim's Monaco, who were forced to rebuild after selling a handful of last season's title-winning stars, have 63 points while Marseille are on 59 and Lyon 54. The return of Colombia striker Falcao after six weeks out with a thigh problem is a welcome sight. The Monaco captain is his team's leading scorer with 17 league goals in just 20 appearances. ""Falcao has been training with the group for a week. He may start the match. He could play with (Stevan) Jovetic, or not, we'll see. It's not a problem,"" said Jardim, who left Falcao on the bench for last week's 3-1 win at Strasbourg as a precautionary measure. The emergence of Rony Lopes, who spent the 2016-17 campaign on loan at Lille, since the turn of the year has helped Monaco overcome Falcao's absence, while Thomas Lemar is rounding into form after an injury-hit first half of the season. ""Lemar is a versatile player who can play on the wings or in the centre. He really likes to get on the ball. We play him where the team needs him most,"" Jardim explained. Lemar and full-back Djibril Sidibe were both called up into the France coach by Didier Deschamps on Thursday for upcoming friendlies against Colombia and World Cup hosts Russia. ""For the moment I'm concentrating on my club form and our domestic objectives, and if that means I play for France too, even better,"" Lemar said last week. When Monaco sold Benjamin Mendy and Bernardo Silva to Manchester City, Tiemoue Bakayoko to Chelsea and saw Kylian Mbappe leave for PSG, few people thought the principality club could match last season's results. But Jardim has masterminded a 14-match unbeaten run and Monaco are also through to the League Cup final, where they will meet holders PSG in Bordeaux on March 31. Lille are still reeling from their experiment with fiery Argentine coach Marcelo Bielsa, with the northerners stuck in 19th and facing a relegation fight. The club's 1-1 home draw against Montpellier was marred by a full-time pitch invasion by angry Lille supporters, some of whom shouted insults and even aimed kicks at players. The trouble prompted Lille to lodge police complaints for ""aggravated violence, criminal damage and death threats"", while club president Gerard Lopez told AFP there would be ""zero tolerance"" in dealing with the perpetrators of the incidents."
108,05/03/2018,15:02,Monaco starlet Pellegri sidelined by hernia surgery,"Sixteen-year-old Monaco striker Pietro Pellegri, the club's youngest ever player, will undergo a hernia operation that will keep him out for six weeks, the reigning French champions said on Monday.","Italian Pellegri, who joined Monaco in January from Genoa for 20 million euros ($25 million), last month eclipsed Kylian Mbappe's record as the club's youngest player in history. He was introduced as a late substitute in a 4-0 rout of Dijon at just 16 years, 10 months and 30 days, beating the record held by Mbappe who was 16 years, 11 months and 13 days old when he made his debut for the club in December 2015. Italy youth international Pellegri, while at Genoa, had also been the youngest player to feature in Serie A and the first player born in the 21st century to play in the Italian championship."
109,03/03/2018,22:35,Di Maria on the mark as PSG turn focus to Real,"Angel Di Maria kept up his irresistible form as a Paris Saint-Germain side missing Neymar, Edinson Cavani and Kylian Mbappe defeated Troyes 2-0 ahead of their Champions League showdown with Real Madrid.","The Argentine notched his 13th goal in 14 starts this year during Saturday's visit to the Stade de l'Aube, which coincided with Neymar successfully undergoing an operation to repair a broken bone in his right foot. Academy product Christopher Nkunku marked his first start of the season with his first goal this term 13 minutes from time to complete a victory that left PSG 14 points clear of defending champions Monaco at the top of Ligue 1. ""Ahead of a big match and after (league and French Cup wins over) Marseille, I'm very happy because we kept up our level of play,"" PSG coach Unai Emery said. ""I want the players to be ready (against Real). The players all want to play and that makes the decision tougher for me, but it's better like that."" With a 3-1 deficit to overcome in the second leg of their last-16 tie against Real on Tuesday, Emery refused to risk Cavani while Mbappe stayed in Paris to continue treatment on an ankle injury sustained against Marseille in midweek. Marco Verratti was also rested for Saturday's trip, as Di Maria again took full advantage of the opportunity presented to several members of PSG's expensively assembled squad in the wake of Neymar's injury. Di Maria himself was feted as the player to turn PSG into genuine Champions League contenders when he signed from Manchester United for 63 million euros ($78 million) in 2015, and the 30-year-old has arguably been their best performer of late. ""Angel is an important player who has the quality to make the difference,"" Emery said. ""He's got both the confidence and the desire. We want the players to be at their best level on Tuesday, and for some like Angel, it will be a special moment."" Troyes goalkeeper Erwin Zelazny produced a series of saves to deny Di Maria, and then Giovani Lo Celso twice in the first half, but the home goal was breached after a defensive lapse on 47 minutes. A poor clearance followed by further miscommunication in the Troyes backline gifted Julian Draxler the opening to slide in Di Maria and the Argentine masterfully dinked the ball over an advancing Zelazny. Twenty-year-old Nkunku sealed the win on 77 minutes, picking out the far corner of the net after gathering a threaded pass from Dani Alves as the linesman's flag controversially stayed down. Troyes boss Jean-Louis Garcia and his assistant were both ordered to the stands after protesting the decision to allow the goal, with replays indicating Nkunku had strayed marginally offside. Emery then handed a first-team debut to Timothy Weah, as the son of former PSG star, and current Liberian president, George Weah replaced Lo Celso for the final few minutes. The 18-year-old US youth international, whose father won the 1995 Ballon d'Or, nearly bagged a debut goal in stoppage time after racing clear of the Troyes defence before being foiled by Zelazny. Goals from Wahbi Khazri and Ismaila Sarr propelled Rennes up to fifth courtesy of a 2-0 victory at Amiens, while Slovenia forward Robert Beric netted twice for Saint-Etienne in a 2-2 draw with Dijon. Angers pulled clear of the relegation zone with a 3-0 home win over Guingamp, but Metz remain firmly rooted to the bottom after conceding a late equaliser in a 1-1 draw against fellow strugglers Toulouse. On Friday, Rony Lopes scored his sixth goal in seven games as Monaco came from behind to beat Bordeaux 2-1 to tighten their grip on second place, with Marseille and Lyon not in action until Sunday."
110,05/02/2018,00:09,Lopes caps rousing Monaco comeback win over Lyon,Rony Lopes struck a dramatic late winner as Monaco recovered from two goals down and overcame the first-half dismissal of Keita Balde to stun Lyon 3-2 in Ligue 1 on Sunday.,"Mariano Diaz scored a 12th-minute opener for Lyon at the Stade Louis II as his deflected shot from distance deceived Monaco goalkeeper Danijel Subasic, who hobbled off injured after tangling with the net. Lyon doubled their lead before the half-hour as Bertrand Traore, making his first league start since early November, volleyed in at the near post past replacement keeper Seydou Sy. But Senegal international Balde held off a succession of defenders before rifling in a low angled drive to halve the deficit just three minutes later. Radamel Falcao then equalised on 36 minutes when he converted the rebound after seeing his penalty, awarded for a foul on Kamil Glik, saved initially by Anthony Lopes. It took the Colombian to 17 league goals for the season -- trailing only Paris Saint-Germain duo Edinson Cavani (21) and Neymar (18). But Monaco were reduced to 10 men on the stroke of half-time as Balde, booked moments earlier for kicking away the ball in frustration, was shown a second yellow card for a nasty foul on Ferland Mendy. The hosts then lost captain Falcao to a thigh injury 10 minutes into the second half, but it was his replacement Stevan Jovetic who set up Portugal international Lopes for the winning goal a minute from time. Lyon conceded possession cheaply inside their own half, and the Montenegrin striker rolled the ball into the path of Lopes who drilled into the far corner to complete a sensational turnaround and help avenge last month's 3-2 loss in the French Cup. ""It was a very tough match. We conceded two goals far too early, we lost two players to injury and had a man sent off, everything was against us,"" Lopes said. ""But we showed we are a strong team and we deserved to win on the basis of the second half. It's our best match in terms of solidarity, but not in quality. We showed that we're a real team."" The result bumped Monaco up to third, one point behind Marseille, while Lyon finished the weekend a point outside the Champions League places in fourth after dropping from second. ""It was a sin not to have won tonight,"" Lyon coach Bruno Genesio said. ""Even worse to lose after the way we started. We had a really good start but then we practically stopped playing when we were 2-0 ahead."" Earlier, Claudio Ranieri's Nantes slumped to a 3-2 defeat at Caen as Damien Da Silva scored twice for the hosts, including an 80th-minute winner, after Yacine Bammou had grabbed a brace for the Canaries. Yeni Ngbakoto's stoppage-time goal at Roazhon Park edged Guingamp to a 1-0 victory at Rennes. A superb Neymar free-kick helped PSG to a 3-0 win at troubled Lille on Saturday as the Ligue 1 leaders began a decisive month as they mean to go on. The world's most expensive player netted the second goal at the Stade Pierre-Mauroy after Yuri Berchiche had opened the scoring just prior to half-time. Giovani Lo Celso's delightful chip secured the victory late on, with PSG now 11 points clear of Marseille at the top of the table. Marseille climbed to second on Friday as Florian Thauvin tormented Metz by hitting a hat-trick in a 6-3 rout of the league's basement side."
111,31/01/2018,23:03,Falcao at the double as Monaco set up PSG League Cup final,Radamel Falcao struck twice as Monaco saw off Montpellier 2-0 on Wednesday to set up a French League Cup final against Paris Saint-Germain.,"Falcao put the hosts ahead in the 15th minute at the Stade Louis II, before Monaco were denied a penalty by the video assistant referee system. The Colombian doubled the lead before the half-hour mark, and although Rony Lopes had a second-period strike ruled out by video technology for offside, Leonardo Jardim's men eased to victory to book a final date with PSG on March 31. The hosts started brightly, with Andrea Raggi seeing a shot well saved by Montpellier goalkeeper Benjamin Lecomte, but they didn't have to wait long to take the lead. Full-back Djibril Sidibe burst his way through before laying the ball off for captain Falcao to sweep home. Monaco thought they had been awarded a penalty just seconds later when Stevan Jovetic was brought down by Lecomte, but a VAR review showed that the keeper had played the ball before taking down the Montenegrin international. Montpellier, who were thrashed 4-0 by PSG at the weekend, continued to struggle and Monaco doubled their lead in the 29th minute. Fabinho unlocked the away defence with a clever pass, before Lopes broke free and crossed for Falcao to tap in his 22nd goal of the season in all competitions. Lopes thought he had added further gloss to the scoreline with 22 minutes to play, but another referral to the VAR showed that Falcao was narrowly offside before laying the ball back to the Portuguese midfielder. PSG continued their bid for a fifth straight League Cup title by edging to a 3-2 win at Rennes in the first semi-final on Tuesday, as they held off a spirited fightback from the hosts after Kylian Mbappe was sent off on a VAR decision."
112,28/01/2018,23:47,"Fabinho grabs Monaco point at Marseille, Bordeaux stun Lyon","Fabinho struck to secure French champions Monaco an entertaining 2-2 draw at southern rivals Marseille on Sunday, while Malcom was at the centre of a penalty controversy as Bordeaux stunned Lyon.","Both teams at the Stade Velodrome missed the chance to take second place from Lyon, with Paris Saint-Germain now 11 points clear at the Ligue 1 summit. Keita Balde gave the visitors a fourth-minute lead, but Marseille centre-back Adil Rami quickly levelled with a close-range header. The hosts moved in front shortly after half-time as Valere Germain headed in against his former club. But Fabinho waltzed through the hapless home defence to equalise for Monaco, denying Marseille a seventh straight win in all competitions and extending his team's unbeaten league run to eight matches. ""Fabinho played a big match today, not only for the goal but for his defensive quality and ability to break the line,"" said Monaco coach Leonardo Jardim. The chase for the Champions League places remains wide open in France, with Lyon, Marseille and Monaco separated by just one point in the hunt for the second and third spots behind PSG. ""One point each was fair. In the war for second place there are no easy games, and it will continue like this until May,"" Jardim added. Senegal striker Balde, a close-season signing from Lazio, pounced on a loose ball to race clear and clip home his sixth league goal for Monaco and give them the perfect start. But the lead lasted less than three minutes, as Monaco shot themselves in the foot. A low cross from Valere Germain caused havoc and Florian Thauvin put pressure on right-back Almamy Toure, who saw his clearance deflected straight into the air for Rami to nod in his first league goal for Marseille. The game settled down after its frenetic start, but Rudi Garcia's hosts should have forged ahead in the 27th minute when Dimitri Payet blazed over with the goal at his mercy. Marseille completed the turnaround in the 47th minute, as Payet whipped in a free-kick and Germain stooped to send a diving header past away goalkeeper Danijel Subasic. It was the 27-year-old's 12th goal for OM since joining from Monaco last July. The champions hit back four minutes later, though, as Brazilian midfielder Fabinho strolled straight through the middle of the Marseille backline and slotted the ball in off the post. Monaco thought they had retaken the lead, but Jemerson's header was ruled out by the linesman's flag, despite the defender not being one of two visiting players in an offside position when Rachid Ghezzal swung in a free-kick. Both sides had chances to snatch all three points, with Marseille keeper Steve Mandanda denying Ghezzal and Germain volleying agonisingly wide, but neither could find the winner they needed to go second. Brazilian star Malcom appeared to dive for a crucial penalty as 10-man Bordeaux upset high-flying Lyon 3-1 to give new coach Gustavo Poyet a winning start in Ligue 1. Malcom, the 50 million-euro ($62m, £44m) rated winger who has been linked with Arsenal, also scored the 27th-minute penalty to give Bordeaux a shock 2-0 lead. Poyet had already seen Nicolas De Preville put the home side in front in south-western France, with Gaetan Laborde scoring another penalty for the hosts after Marcelo had pulled one back for Lyon. Bordeaux had another Brazilian, Otavio, sent off after the break but they held on to make it two wins from two games since previous coach Jocelyn Gourvennec was sacked. The result was a big blow to Lyon, who had beaten PSG at home last weekend and then won at Monaco in the French Cup on Wednesday. PSG beat Montpellier 4-0 on Saturday, with Neymar scoring twice and Angel Di Maria also on target after Edinson Cavani got the opener to take him to a club record 157 goals in all competitions."
113,25/01/2018,21:50,Southampton sign Monaco striker Carrillo,"Southampton have signed Argentinian striker Guido Carrillo from French champions Monaco on a three-year deal, the English Premier League strugglers announced Thursday.","The move sees Carrillo, 26, joining up again with Saints manager Mauricio Pellegrino, having previously played for his compatriot when they were both with Argentinian side Estudiantes. No fee was disclosed by Southampton, but British media reports said they had paid £19.2 million ($27.1 million, 21.8 million euros). It was from Estudiantes that Carrillo joined Monaco in 2015, going on to help the principality club end the domestic dominance of Paris Saint-Germain with their first Ligue 1 title since 2000 last season. South coast side Southampton are currently in the relegation zone, a point shy of safety, with the Saints in desperate need of goals after managing a mere 24 from as many league games so far this season. ""I'm very happy. It's a great feeling to be a part of this club,"" said Carrillo in a club statement. ""Lots of things attracted me. I know Southampton from watching the Premier League from when I was small, I've always regarded it as the most important league in the world."" He added: ""I obviously know the coaching staff, I've worked with them in Argentina and I also spoke with some players who were former teammates in Argentina, who are now playing in the Premier League and they told me all about the club and gave it a shining reference. Therefore, I had no doubts when I took the decision."" Carrillo scored 15 league goals in his two-and-a-half seasons at Monaco, but started only seven times since the start of the 2016/17 campaign. Southampton vice-chairman Les Reed welcomed Carrillo to St Mary's by saying: ""Guido represents a very exciting addition to our attacking options ahead of the final months of the season, possessing plenty of experience at the highest level, while also having the potential and the desire to improve even further. ""We are confident he will benefit us not only in the remainder of this campaign, but in the years to come.""

Brazilian left-back Jorge drew an excellent stop from Montpellier goalkeeper Benjamin Lecomte, who then pulled off a terrific reflex save to deny Kevin N'Doram to preserve a 10th clean sheet of the season. The stalemate at the Stade de la Mosson snapped Monaco's four-match winning run in Ligue 1 but sent them a point clear of Lyon in second, while leaving them eight points adrift of leaders Paris Saint-Germain. ""A draw is not a good result because we came to pick up three points,"" said Monaco coach Leonardo Jardim. ""We were lacking quite a few things going forward. We'll try to be more competitive on Tuesday (at home to Nice) to achieve a better result."" Christophe Galtier made a winning start in his first league game in charge of Lille after replacing the sacked Marcelo Bielsa just before Christmas. Nicolas Pepe's 43rd-minute goal handed Lille a 1-0 victory at Caen and also prompted the dismissal of home goalkeeper Remy Vercoutre after he took umbrage at the Ivorian winger's exuberant celebration. The veteran Vercoutre was incensed by Pepe's 'robot' dance in front of the home fans and argued furiously with the goalscorer over what he felt was a provocation. Pepe appeared to be playing it up for a pitchside camera, and the 37-year-old Vercoutre was shown a straight red card. However, Lille also finished the match with 10 men after Fode Ballo-Toure was sent off early into the second half. Florian Thauvin scored his team-leading ninth goal of the season but also missed a penalty as Marseille brushed aside Rennes 3-0 at Roazhon Park. The former Newcastle winger saw a first-half spot-kick saved by Rennes goalkeeper Tomas Koubek but redeemed himself by setting up Valere Germain for the opening goal on 35 minutes. Thauvin's ninth assist of the season drew him level with Neymar, while Hiroki Sakai produced a brilliant goal-line block to deny Ismaila Sarr an equaliser, and minutes later Germain teed up Morgan Sanson to rifle in Marseille's second just before half-time. Thauvin completed the scoring eight minutes from the end when he nodded in a cross from Brazilian midfielder Luiz Gustavo. Marseille avenged a 3-1 defeat by Rennes at the Velodrome in September -- one of just three losses for Rudi Garcia's team this season -- to move level on 41 points with third-place Lyon. ""Tonight we saw a Marseille that I would like to see all the time,"" Garcia said. ""We work to play like that but it doesn't happen all the time."" Nice continued their resurgent form as Pierre Lees-Melou's deflected strike earned them a 1-0 home win over Amiens, while a Gaetan Laborde header gave Bordeaux a 1-0 victory at Troyes to halt a run of six straight defeats in all competitions. Edinson Cavani is in line to return for PSG at Claudio Ranieri's Nantes on Sunday after missing their last two matches following his delayed return from holiday, but Neymar has been sidelined by a rib injury. Lyon will go in search of a fifth straight league win when they host second-from-bottom Angers, but they will be without joint-top scorer Mariano Diaz as he recovers from a hernia operation."

Monaco moved back in front before half-time through 21-year-old Adama Diakhaby and Leonardo Jardim's French champions held on with the aid of a terrible miss by Nice midfielder Pierre Lees-Melou. ""This victory was deserved and it is very important for our fans,"" said Monaco coach Jardim after his side's sixth straight win. ""Diakhaby is progressing, even if he's not doing everything right, he's young and we believe in him."" The Video Assistant Referee (VAR) is being used for the rest of the competition as a test ahead of its expected arrival in Ligue 1 next season, having been used in the promotion/relegation play-off last year. ""It's good, we're losing two or three minutes in the whole game,"" Jardim said. ""Errors will decrease, not totally, but by 80 percent."" The hosts were given a blow before kick-off as the in-form Mario Balotelli failed to regain fitness in time after suffering with glute pain. Monaco made a fast start and took the lead in only the third minute, as Lemar found space to head in Keita Balde's cross from close range to score his third goal of an injury-hit season and send out a message to potential suitors at Arsenal and Liverpool. The 22-year-old drilled into the roof of the net 10 minutes later, only to be denied a second goal by the linesman's flag for offside. Nice levelled against the run of play in the 18th minute as Plea ran onto Allan Saint-Maximin's pass and slotted past Diego Benaglio at the Monaco goalkeeper's near post. The referee checked with VAR for offside, but replays showed that Plea had timed his run to perfection before grabbing his 10th goal of the campaign. The visitors continued to be the better side, though, and they retook the lead as forward Diakhaby sent a half-volley flying into the corner from another excellent Balde delivery. Nice threw bodies forwards in the second half without creating many clear-cut chances, but Lees-Melou should have equalised when he headed wide with the goal gaping from only three yards out. Runaway Ligue 1 leaders Paris Saint-Germain, who have won four straight League Cups, will look to extend their incredible 34-match winning streak in domestic cup games at Amiens on Wednesday."
117,16/12/2017,00:09,Monaco hit four to stay in PSG chase,Reigning French champions Monaco eased past struggling Saint-Etienne 4-0 on Friday to stay on PSG's tail with the highly coveted Fabinho and Thomas Lemar among the scorers.,"Djibril Sidibe curled in the opener after Keita Balde shot was blocked and Thomas Lemar -- the target of a bid by Arsenal in the summer -- scored on 32 minutes after weaving through the St Etienne defence. Fabinho, who told the club this week he wants to leave, tapped in the third in the second half before Keita put the icing on the cake with a piercing shot on 60 minutes at Stade Geoffroy-Guichard, where there were row after row of empty seats. The victory put Monaco six points behind Paris Saint-Germain, who play at Rennes on Saturday. Saint-Etienne are hovering just above the relegation zone. ""It was a great night,"" Monaco coach Leonardo Jardim said. ""We finished our chances well and we could have scored more goals if we had been more clinical."""

They should face a tougher test against Saint-Etienne, although Les Verts are also struggling at the wrong end of the table after an eight-match winless streak. ""Saint-Etienne are going through a difficult time but they're a big club,"" said Monaco coach Jardim. ""They have been at the top of the table in recent years. We have to respect them and play at 100 percent to get the three points."" It has been a difficult season for the principality club after losing Kylian Mbappe, Tiemoue Bakayoko, Bernardo Silva and Benjamin Mendy during the transfer window, while Djibril Sidibe and Thomas Lemar have struggled with injuries. There was more bad news for Jardim on Wednesday, as Brazil midfielder Fabinho said he expects to leave Monaco at the end of the season. But with their European campaign brought to an abrupt end by a string of poor performances and a bottom-placed finish in their Champions League group, Monaco's depleted squad can now turn their attentions solely to domestic matters. Colombian Radamel Falcao has led from the front with 18 goals in all competitions, including a remarkable 50-yard strike in Tuesday's League Cup win over Caen and Monaco will be hoping for more of the same from their captain. PSG have already ensured they will head into the winter break top of the table, but have shown signs of weakness this month with losses to Strasbourg and Bayern Munich. But they brushed aside Strasbourg in the French League Cup on Wednesday without Neymar and Mbappe, who are both expected to return to the starting line-up at the weekend. Neymar will return to training on Thursday after a trip to his native Brazil for a 'family problem', having also been suspended for last week's win over Lille. The world's most expensive player hasn't had the smoothest of seasons off the field since joining PSG from Barcelona, and Brazilian website Globoesporte suggested the player could have been at the birthday party of his friend's father. But Unai Emery's men will be heavy favourites to see off Rennes, as the Spanish coach will be keen to see his side move further clear before they return to Champions League action against holders Real Madrid in the last 16 in February. Alongside Monaco nine points adrift are Lyon and Marseille. Those two teams go head-to-head in the big match on Sunday, as the race for a top-three spot and a place in the Champions League takes centre stage. Marseille will put a 12-match unbeaten run in the league on the line at Lyon, who will be looking to bounce back from a 4-1 League Cup loss at Montpellier. Argentinian Guido Carrillo has hit form for Monaco in recent days, with close-season additions Stevan Jovetic and Keita Balde both struggling for consistency, scoring three goals in his last two games. ""He knows how to seize the opportunities that I give him. It's no coincidence that he's already our second leading scorer,"" said Jardim. Carrillo has only made two Ligue 1 starts this term, but two of his four goals came last weekend against Troyes. Fixtures (all times GMT)"
119,13/12/2017,18:01,Fabinho expecting to leave Monaco next year,"Brazilian international Fabinho said on Wednesday that he will probably leave French champions Monaco at the end of the season, but that he has no intention of departing in January.","The 24-year-old was linked with a transfer in the close season after a stellar campaign in which he helped the principality club win the Ligue 1 title and reach the Champions League semi-finals. But Fabinho stayed with Monaco after a possible move to Atletico Madrid fell through due to the Spanish giants' transfer ban. ""Ordinarily, it's my last season at Monaco. Nothing is signed,"" he said. ""During the transfer window and even a month afterwards it was a little difficult to live with the situation. But I don't think about it anymore, I've turned the page. ""(As for leaving in January) I don't think so. I have had no contact (from other clubs) and I'm secure at Monaco."" Fabinho, who extended his Monaco contract to 2021 last year, hinted that a move to Atletico could still go ahead in June. But the defensive midfielder's form has been patchy this season in a Monaco side that have slipped nine points behind title rivals Paris Saint-Germain and dumped out of Europe. ""Yes, it's a possibility, but nobody from Atletico has spoken to me or my agent,"" he added. ""I have to demonstrate that I'm still at the level to play in teams like that. I know that I'm not the Fabinho of last season and it's hard to explain why."" Monaco was depleted as Kylian Mbappe, Tiemoue Bakayoko, Bernardo Silva and Benjamin Mendy departed in the close season, but Leonardo Jardim's side can cut the gap to PSG to six points at Saint-Etienne on Friday, ahead of the Ligue 1 leaders' trip to Rennes the following day."
120,01/12/2017,10:50,Faltering Monaco need to show backbone - Jardim,"Monaco coach Leonardo Jardim said his faltering French champions need players ""with character"" after slipping 12 points behind runaway leaders Paris Saint-Germain.","The principality side made a strong start to the domestic season despite seeing their title-winning side decimated in the transfer window, with Benjamin Mendy, Bernardo Silva, Kylian Mbappe and Tiemoue Bakayoko all leaving the club. But back-to-back defeats by PSG and Nantes have left Monaco languishing in fourth place, while last season's Champions League semi-finalists were also dumped out of Europe with a 4-1 home loss to RB Leipzig last week. ""At this difficult moment, we need players with character, with experience,"" Jardim said Thursday ahead of Saturday's match against lowly Angers. ""They are important to bring us a little more desire and tranquility."" Without teenage sensation Mbappe, who left on loan to title rivals PSG ahead of a 180-million-euro ($214.3 million) move next year, Radamel Falcao has shouldered the goalscoring burden, while close-season signing Stevan Jovetic has struggled with form and fitness. Colombian Falcao has managed 13 goals in just 12 league games this term, but has not scored in his last two outings, and Jardim knows his other forwards have to step up. ""It's completely different when he plays with another striker,"" said the Portuguese coach. ""That gives more space to Falcao, as we did last season and at the beginning of this season. ""When he's alone, our midfielders like Rony Lopes (Rachid) Ghezzal and Joao (Moutinho) are not used to going into the area, dribbling and scoring. ""Even if they play well, it's more difficult for Falcao."" Monaco suffered another setback on Wednesday, with the news that Belgium international midfielder Youri Tielemans would need knee surgery. PSG's front line of Neymar, Edinson Cavani and Mbappe have looked unstoppable for much of this season, although the league leaders had to wait until the 73rd minute to break down a stubborn Troyes in midweek. But world-record signing Neymar and Cavani both scored late on, despite the Uruguayan's first-half penalty miss, to continue their unbeaten start to the campaign with a 2-0 win that pulled them 10 points clear of second-placed Marseille. The three are unlikely to start together for Saturday's game at newly-promoted Strasbourg, though, with coach Unai Emery set to ring the changes ahead of their final Champions League group-stage game at Bayern Munich. PSG only need to avoid a four-goal loss at the Allianz Arena to finish top of Group B, but youngsters Presnel Kimpembe and Giovani Lo Celso could be given starts again at the weekend. Elsewhere, Marseille visit Montpellier on Sunday bidding to extend a 10-match unbeaten streak in the league, while Lyon will look to bounce back from a shock home defeat by Lille at Caen. Monaco's close-season signing from Lazio has struggled to impress consistently since leaving Italy, but has still scored three league goals in only six starts. The 22-year-old Senegal international netted 16 times in Serie A last season, and with former Inter Milan striker Jovetic injured, Balde may prove the perfect foil for Falcao in the weeks before the winter break."
121,28/11/2017,01:50,Ranieri set for Monaco reunion as PSG look to power on,"Claudio Ranieri admits he has ""fantastic memories"" of coaching Monaco as his Nantes side prepare to host the faltering reigning champions in a midweek round of games in Ligue 1.","The Italian was appointed by Monaco in 2012 and lasted two seasons in the principalty, winning Ligue 2 and leading them to promotion in his first campaign before taking them to second place on their return to Ligue 1. The disappointment of his departure was soon forgotten as he led Leicester City to their historic Premier League title triumph in 2016 before returning to the French game with Nantes in the summer. ""I have fantastic memories. We were Ligue 2 champions then second in Ligue 1. I often went to see them in the Champions League last year and their project has not changed,"" said the Italian, who still has a home in the principality. Monaco head to the Stade de la Beaujoire in need of a boost after a week which saw them eliminated from Europe following a 4-1 home defeat to RB Leipzig and then lose 2-1 at home to Paris Saint-Germain on Sunday. That result left Leonardo Jardim's side nine points behind the unbeaten leaders. ""We know it's very difficult against Paris,"" said Ranieri, whose team lost 4-1 at PSG recently. ""They (Monaco) are rebuilding after selling a lot of players. But I am convinced that they will fight for second place with Lyon and Marseille."" Nantes are currently fifth having lost three of their last four matches, while Lyon have moved above Monaco into second on a run of eight league games without defeat. Bruno Genesio's Lyon have won 5-0 in each of their last three away games and haven't conceded a league goal in nearly eight-and-a-half hours, and next up they host crisis club Lille, in the relegation zone and without a coach after Marcelo Bielsa was suspended by the club. Nobody can keep up with Neymar's PSG, who are still unbeaten this season and would have won by a far greater margin in Monaco if they had taken half the chances that fell their way. Coach Unai Emery may be tempted to rotate his squad for Wednesday's home meeting with Troyes and again at Strasbourg at the weekend with a Champions League trip to Bayern Munich to follow. The likes of Angel Di Maria, Javier Pastore, Thomas Meunier and Presnel Kimpembe can hope to get a run-out against Troyes, who sit in mid-table with the South Korean Suk Hyun-Jun impressing on loan from FC Porto. There will be a strange atmosphere at the Parc des Princes as the end of the stadium where the club's most boisterous fans gather will be closed. That is as a punishment for the use of flares during a match against Nice last month. Heavily criticised for his performances at the start of the season, Dutch winger Depay has found some stunning form in recent weeks to help a prolific Lyon side climb up to second in the table. The former Manchester United man, 23, scored twice in Sunday's 5-0 romp at Nice, as Lyon coped admirably in the absence of ill skipper Nabil Fekir and the injured Bertrand Traore. He has scored seven times in Lyon's last seven outings in all competitions and now has his sights set on struggling Lille. Fixtures (1800 GMT kick-offs unless stated)"
122,27/11/2017,18:39,Ex-Chelsea director Emenalo joins Monaco,"Chelsea's former technical director Michael Emenalo has joined Monaco just three weeks after leaving the Premier League champions, the Ligue 1 side announced on Monday.","""AS Monaco is delighted to announce the appointment of Michael Emenalo as new sporting director,"" Monaco said in a statement. ""He will take charge of all sport matters, under the authority of (Vice President) Vadim Vasilyev."" Former Nigeria international Emenalo joins Monaco following his decision to quit Chelsea earlier in the month after 10 years at Stamford Bridge. ""It's a wonderful opportunity for me in such a high quality project,"" added Emenalo. ""AS Monaco has shown a great evolution in the past few seasons and I am convinced that the club will keep being successful."" Emenalo, 52, became one of Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich's key confidants in his decade at the Blues as they racked up the trophies and achieved huge success in youth football. ""I have been following Michael Emenalo's work for a long time and I am very happy to have him here after he chose to quit Chelsea,"" said Vasilyev. ""His know-how in scouting network, as well as the technical skills he developed working in one of the most successful clubs in the world in the past few years, are the main reasons leading us to present him our ambitious challenge."" Emenalo joined Chelsea in 2007 as an opposition scout while Avram Grant was still coach, and rose to become technical director in 2011. During his time at Stamford Bridge, Chelsea won three Premier League titles, the 2012 Champions League, three FA Cups, the League Cup and the Europa League. The London club have also rattled through seven permanent managers since Emenalo first arrived, plus Guus Hiddink (twice) and Rafael Benitez as lengthy interim appointments. Emenalo arrives at Ligue 1 champions Monaco with the club humiliated by a group stage exit from the Champions League and nine points behind domestic league leaders Paris Saint-Germain, who beat them 2-1 on Sunday. Leonardo Jardim's side are third in the league, level on points with second-placed Lyon ahead of Wednesday's clash with Claudio Ranieri's surprise package Nantes."
123,21/11/2017,22:54,RB Leipzig destroy Monaco to aid last 16 hopes,Devastating RB Leipzig boosted their chances of qualifying for the last 16 of the Champions League on Tuesday by taking Monaco apart 4-1 with a four-goal first-half demolition that saw them draw level on points with second-place Porto in Group G.,"Leipzig took full advantage of slack Monaco defending and Porto drawing 1-1 at Besiktas earlier on with a free-flowing attacking display that saw the Bundesliga side reignite their knockout hopes. Ralph Hasenhuettl's team stay third due their head-to-head record, which has Porto on top, 5-4 over their two matches. Monaco are out of Europe after failing to win once and picking up just two points from their five matches. Ligue 1 side Monaco needed a win to have any chance of qualifying but gifted Leipzig a sixth-minute lead when defender Jemerson sliced an innocuous Marcel Sabitzer cross past befuddled Monaco keeper Danijel Subasic. After scoring the opener Jemerson turned provider for the opposition three minutes later, his weak pass out from the back easily intercepted by Kevin Kampl, who scampered forward before feeding Timo Werner with an easy chance that the German happily slotted home. Monaco briefly rallied, and Radamel Falcao was unlucky to see his close range stab at goal, after confusion in the Leipzig defence, kicked away by RB stopper Peter Gulacsi, but the Colombian soon had an impact at the other end, clumsily bringing down Willi Orban in his own area and allowing Werner to double his tally from the penalty spot. Falcao made up for his mistake two minutes before the break when he met Rony Lopes' free-kick before Gulacsi could connect with his fist to reduce the deficit to two. But the striker's struggling teammates let him down only with seconds of the half to spare, with Naby Keita spinning Kamil Glik before charging towards goal and ending Monaco's European hopes with a neat finish. Monaco, fresh from a domestic disappointment after a draw at Ligue 1 new boys Amiens at the weekend, failed to rally, and Leipzig cruised to a win that gives them a chance of qualifying from the group. They host leaders Besiktas on December 6 needing to do better than Porto do at home to rock-bottom Monaco."
124,17/11/2017,22:47,Champions Monaco slip up with Amiens draw,French champions Monaco were held to a 1-1 draw at newly-promoted Amiens on Friday despite an equaliser from Stevan Jovetic to drop two points in the Ligue 1 title race.,"Christophe Pelissier's home side took a shock 31st-minute lead through Serge Gakpe, but Jovetic came off the bench in the second half to equalise. Ligue 1 leaders Paris Saint-Germain can move six points clear of Monaco when they welcome Nantes to the Parc des Princes on Saturday, after Leonardo Jardim's men saw a three-match winning streak come to an end. Monaco went into the game four points adrift of PSG, but were boosted by the return from injury of captain Radamel Falcao. The Colombian quickly went in search of his 14th league goal of the season, but twice fired wide before being denied by the legs of Amiens goalkeeper Regis Gurtner. The Stade de la Licorne burst into life just after the half-hour mark as Togo international Gakpe surged through on goal and confidently slotted into the corner to score his first Amiens goal. The visitors almost got a leveller on the stroke of half-time, but after Gurtner failed to deal with a high ball into the area, Monaco centre-back Jemerson sent a lob over the crossbar. Amiens started the second period brightly and almost moved further ahead, but striker Moussa Konate headed over when he was totally unmarked just a few yards from goal. Falcao went close again as he brought a diving stop from Gurtner with a curling effort from the edge of the box, before Guido Carrillo's header grazed the outside of the post just seconds later. Having already replaced Rony Lopes with Rachid Ghezzal at the interval, Jardim sent on Jovetic just after the hour mark and it took the Montenegrin international less than six minutes to make his mark. The former Inter Milan striker grabbed the equaliser by picking out the bottom corner after excellent work from Fabinho to score his second goal for the club. But it was Amiens who looked more likely to find a late winner as ex-Chelsea forward Gael Kakuta nodded over. Monaco will now turn their attention to Tuesday's clash with RB Leipzig, when last year's semi-finalists could win and yet still be eliminated from the Champions League. Earlier on Friday, Lille beat Saint-Etienne 3-1 to ease the pressure on under-fire Argentinian coach Marcelo Bielsa and move out of the Ligue 1 relegation zone. The second straight win dragged Lille out of the bottom two, having ended a nine-match winless streak with a 3-0 victory over Metz before the international break. Saint-Etienne stay sixth in the table, after losing their first game under new coach Julien Sable since Oscar Garcia quit this week. Lille forward Nicolas Pepe leapt highest at the back post to open the scoring in the 20th minute at the Stade Pierre-Mauroy. Jonathan Bamba fired home a penalty on the stroke of half-time to equalise for the visitors, but the hosts retook the lead in the 71st minute. Brazilian Thiago Mendes proved the difference, as the 25-year-old midfielder curled in from outside the area to score his second goal for Lille since joining from Sao Paulo in the close season. Striker Ezequiel Ponce added some gloss to the scoreline with a minute of normal time to play as he slotted in his first goal since signing on loan from Roma."
125,01/11/2017,20:00,Besiktas made to wait for last-16 place,Turkish champions Besiktas missed a chance to secure their place in the last 16 of the Champions League as they drew 1-1 with Monaco in Istanbul on Wednesday.,"The home side needed a penalty from Cenk Tosun in the second half to earn a point after Rony Lopes had given Monaco the lead just prior to the interval. Besiktas, who had won their opening three games in Group G, would have been confirmed qualifiers for the knockout phase with a victory at their Vodafone Park. But the draw could still see them through with two matches to spare, provided RB Leipzig beat Porto in Portugal later (1945 GMT). Meanwhile, having thrilled Europe on their run to the semi-finals last season, Monaco -- without the injured Radamel Falcao here -- moved closer to an early exit. The principality side remain bottom of the group with just two points from four games, two fewer than Leipzig before the German side play later. Monaco acquitted themselves very well in a cauldron-like atmosphere and also had to cope with losing French international winger Thomas Lemar to a shoulder injury within 26 minutes. They went ahead in stoppage time at the end of the first half when Joao Moutinho intercepted an Adriano Correia pass and fed Lopes, who took a touch before curling a left-foot shot into the net from 20 yards. But Besiktas were gifted the chance to draw level seven minutes after the restart as Jorge brought down Ricardo Quaresma in the box and Cenk Tosun, the Turkish international striker, scored the resulting spot-kick. Both sides had chances to win it after that, with Keita Balde squandering a golden opportunity for the visitors in added time. Paris Saint-Germain and Bayern Munich both sealed qualification from Group B on Tuesday. Manchester City, Real Madrid and Tottenham Hotspur all have the chance to join them in the last 16 when they play later on Wednesday. City are away at Napoli while Spurs play Madrid at Wembley with the winner guaranteed to progress."
126,26/10/2017,15:10,Monaco striker Falcao suffers thigh injury,"Monaco captain and top-scorer Radamel Falcao will miss Saturday's Ligue 1 clash at Bordeaux with a thigh injury, coach Leonardo Jardim said on Thursday.","The Colombian striker leads the way in the Ligue 1 scoring charts with 13 goals in only nine outings this season. The French champions trail league leaders Paris Saint-Germain by four points, but face a crucial match with Besiktas next week that could end their Champions League hopes. Defeat in Istanbul on Wednesday could see the principality side eliminated from Group G, having only picked up one point from their first three games. ""I'm not going to use him (this weekend) because he's not in good shape,"" said Jardim. ""Then I'll see for the Champions League."""
127,13/10/2017,23:22,Monaco beaten by late Lyon thunderbolt,Nabil Fekir's last-gasp free-kick delivered three crucial points to Lyon in Ligue 1 Friday as their captain sealed a 3-2 home win over champions Monaco.,"The defeat of the second-placed southerners offers Paris Saint-Germain the chance to climb six points clear at Dijon on Saturday. Lyon, who last won the title in 2008, climbed to third after back-to-back 3-3 draws. With an eye on their Champions League game at home to Besiktas on Tuesday Monaco had rested key striker Radamel Falcao who had scored 12 goals in eight league games but played for Colombia in midweek. Lyon started with all guns blazing as new boy Mariano, signed from Real Madrid, almost stole a goal sneaking up on Danijel Subasic on the line only to hit the post. But he stole in again unmarked to tap in a Fekir cross on 11 minutes before Monaco's new star Rony Lopes fired an impressive equaliser form the edge of the box on 17 minutes. Fekir then rounded off a magnificent Lyon move with a slick shot from near the penalty spot on 23 before Adama Traore cracked a belter into the top corner on 34 minutes to equalise for Monaco. The second half was less breathtaking but built to a stunning finale with Fekir victim of a razor's edge off-side decision on 90 before his late long range free-kick earned Lyon their fourth league win so far. ""The three points are really important. It was a great result even if they were missing key players,"" Fekir told French television. Monaco's Lopes was keen to forget a match they might easily have won. ""We should have scored in the second half, it's always tough to lose late like that, but we'll put it behind us. We have the Champions League now,"" said the 21-year-old attacking midfielder. Monaco are unrecognisable from the team that romped to Ligue 1 last season having lost Kylian Mbappe to PSG, Benjamin Mendy and Bernardo Silva to Man City and Tiemoue Bakayoko to Chelsea. But many of their new players especially Lopes, formerly of Man City, and Terence Kongolo in defence look promising. PSG pay a visit to lowly Dijon on Saturday with five key players out including Edinson Cavani, Marco Verratti, Thiago Motta, Thiago Silva and Layvin Kurzawa after international action."
128,12/10/2017,02:10,Falcao-less Monaco bid to put pressure on PSG,"French champions Monaco will make the tricky trip to Lyon on Friday without red-hot striker Radamel Falcao, as they look to keep up the pressure on Ligue 1 leaders Paris Saint-Germain.","Leonardo Jardim's side dropped two points with a 1-1 home draw against Montpellier before the international break to slip three points adrift of PSG at the top of the table. Colombian Falcao has been in stunning form so far this season, scoring 12 goals in just eight league outings, but his midweek efforts in helping his country qualify for next year's World Cup have ruled him out of Friday's game. ""He played last night, then there are the different trips (to get back to Monaco),"" Jardim said on Wednesday. ""To try to play against Lyon could kill him. He will not play. In fact, his physical condition doesn't allow him to play two matches in 48 hours."" Falcao will play in the World Cup finals for the first time in Russia, after setting up James Rodriguez's goal as Colombia booked their place with a 1-1 draw in Peru. ""He deserves to play in a World Cup, he is a great player of a very high quality,"" added Jardim. ""I congratulated him for the qualification, but my management of Falcao won't change. I'll do everything I can to keep him at his best."" Despite Falcao's early goal, Monaco were far from their best in their last league match against Montpellier and will have to bounce back with Argentinian Guido Carrillo likely to start up front. Lyon have started to struggle in recent weeks after a bright start to the season and are winless in their last three matches, including back-to-back 3-3 draws against Angers and Dijon. Bruno Genesio's men will be without centre-back Marcelo, after the Brazilian's bizarre sending off against Angers, when he was given a straight red card for accidentally knocking a yellow card out of the referee's hand. PSG pay a visit to lowly Dijon on Saturday with key forwards Kylian Mbappe and Edinson Cavani boosted after helping their countries qualify for the World Cup in midweek. World-record signing Neymar failed to score in Brazil's final two World Cup qualifiers, so he will be desperate to terrorise a Dijon defence which has already shipped 17 goals in Ligue 1 this term. Mbappe came off the bench as France confirmed their place in Russia with a 2-1 win over Belarus, while Cavani scored as Uruguay sealed second in South American qualifying, behind Brazil, by beating Bolivia 4-2. Unai Emery's side may have half an eye on Wednesday's Champions League game against Anderlecht in Brussels, but should have more than enough to continue their unbeaten start to the season in all competitions. The capital-city club are brimming with confidence after a stunning start to the campaign, which they continued by thrashing Bordeaux 6-2 a fortnight ago. But centre-back Thiago Silva is likely to miss the matches at Dijon and Anderlecht after suffering a thigh muscle injury while on Brazil duty. Under-fire Lille coach Marcelo Bielsa sees his team host Troyes as they continue their search for a first win since the opening weekend, after their last match at Amiens was abandoned when a stadium barrier collapsed, injuring 29 people. On Sunday, Claudio Ranieri's Nantes defend a seven-game unbeaten run at Bordeaux, while third-placed Marseille bid for a fourth straight win against newly-promoted Strasbourg.

129,29/09/2017,22:54,Monaco held by Montpellier,French champions Monaco missed the chance to go top of Ligue 1 as Souleymane Camara struck an injury-time equaliser to snatch Montpellier a 1-1 draw at the Stade Louis II on Friday.,"After a slow start, Monaco struck first in the 38th minute as the red-hot Radamel Falcao slid in to score, but Montpellier kept their hosts at arm's length and Camara stunned the home crowd. Leonardo Jardim's men trail league leaders Paris Saint-Germain on goal difference, ahead of the capital club's home match against unbeaten Bordeaux on Saturday. Monaco went into the game after a surprising 3-0 Champions League loss at home to Porto in midweek. Coach Jardim responded by making five changes to his starting XI, welcoming back goalkeeper Danijel Subasic from injury, as well as reinstating close-season signing Stevan Jovetic alongside Falcao up front. Montpellier, who held PSG to a 0-0 draw last weekend, began the match on the front foot and they could have taken the lead when Pedro Mendes found himself with space inside the area, but the centre-back curled too close to Subasic. Monaco were not much-improved from the Porto defeat, but broke through before half-time as winger Rony Lopes got behind the away defence and crossed low for Falcao, who managed to bundle the ball over the line from point-blank range. The Colombian has now scored 12 goals in just eight Ligue 1 games this season. Monaco were far from their fluent best, and Montpellier were the stronger side for much of the second period, with full-back Ruben Aguilar volleying narrowly wide. The hosts came close to scoring a second goal, though, as Thomas Lemar ran clean through before dinking his effort past the far post. But Montpellier grabbed a deserved point in the second minute of injury-time as 34-year-old Senegalese forward Camara pounced to head home Kevin Berigaud's cross."
130,16/09/2017,21:17,Falcao double gets Monaco back on track,Radamel Falcao grabbed a brace as French champions Monaco bounced back from last week's thrashing by Nice with a 3-0 win over Strasbourg at the Stade Louis II on Saturday.,"The hosts started slowly, but took the lead on the stroke of half-time through Rony Lopes' first goal for the club. Falcao made the points safe early in the second period, before completing his double in the 67th minute. ""Falcao is a great player, a great professional with an always positive attitude,"" Monaco coach Leonardo Jardim said. ""A year and a half ago, 80 percent of people thought it was over (for him). Today he is at a high level."" The three points move Monaco level on points with early Ligue 1 leaders Paris Saint-Germain, who host Lyon on Sunday. Monaco were looking to respond after seeing their record 16-match winning run in the league ended by a 4-0 thumping at Nice last week. The principality outfit have actually had a better start to this season than 12 months ago, when they also lost 4-0 at Nice in September before going on to win the title. ""It's true (we've had a better start), but it's difficult to compare with other seasons,"" Jardim added. Jardim gave Montenegrin forward Stevan Jovetic and winger Rachid Ghezzal their full debuts after close-season moves from Inter Milan and Lyon respectively, in the only two changes from the side that claimed a 1-1 draw at RB Leipzig in their Champions League opener on Wednesday. But promoted Strasbourg more than held their own for the first half an hour, and almost took the lead when Ivorian midfielder Jean-Eudes Aholou headed over from only three yards out. The hosts were a shadow of the side that stormed to last season's title and started this campaign with four straight wins, but they broke the shackles in the 44th minute. Ghezzal's ball over the top picked out an intelligent run from Falcao, who squared for Lopes to prod the ball in at the back post. The hosts didn't have to wait long to score a second, as captain Falcao grabbed his league-leading eighth goal of the campaign six minutes into the second half. Full-back Jorge's low cross left the Colombian with the simple task of diverting the ball home. Falcao wasn't done there though, as he capitalised on Strasbourg captain Kader Mangane's terrible mistake before lashing into the corner. The 31-year-old has now scored two or more goals three times already in Ligue 1 this season. On Friday, Brazilian Malcolm's third goal of the campaign helped Bordeaux stay unbeaten with a 1-0 victory at Toulouse."
131,14/09/2017,02:25,Leipzig can compete on European stage - coach,"RB Leipzig have shown that they can compete at the top level of European football, coach Ralph Hasenhuettl said after the German club's 1-1 draw with Monaco on their Champions League debut on Wednesday.","""We have made our first steps here. We played well against a strong opponent, and showed that we can compete at this level,"" said Hasenhuettl. ""It was a good start from us all, and it makes us want more."" Leipzig picked up a point from their first ever Champions League fixture, after Emil Forsberg's first half opener was quickly cancelled out by Monaco's Youri Tielemans. The Leipzig coach admitted that he felt his team could have taken all three points against Monaco, and said that both he and his players had been cautious as they made their first foray into Champions League football. ""I think everyone noticed that we weren't as calm on the ball and that we didn't take as many risks as usual. ""I chose not to bring on another forward towards the end, because it's always possible to concede from set pieces, and Monaco showed towards the end that they could be dangerous."" The cautious approach, Hasenhuettl said, was partly down to the absence of Liverpool bound midfield star Naby Keita, who was ruled out of Wednesday's fixture with a groin injury. ""We did miss Naby. If he had been there, then we probably would had a bit more stability and a bit more penetration going forward. To get a point without him is a great achievement."" It is nearly thirty years since the city of Leipzig, where the German Football Federation was founded, has hosted a game in European club competition. The historical significance, Hasenhuettl said, had not escaped him and his team. ""The atmosphere gave us goosebumps tonight,"" said striker Timo Werner. ""We really wanted to win, but Monaco defended well."" ""I also noticed that the expectations were high, and the people of Leipzig were excited to see a game at this level,"" said Hasenhuettl. ""For us it was obviously something special."" The Austrian even broke with his usual touchline dress code of tracksuit and trainers, donning a suit to mark the occasion of RB's Champions League debut. ""The players started laughing when I came to give the team talk, because they're not used to seeing me in a suit."" Monaco coach Leonardo Jardim, meanwhile, told reporters that his team's lack of potency going forward was down to the personnel changes he had endured during the summer, most notably the departure of Kylian Mbappé to Paris Saint Germain. ""Every season, it's different,"" said Jardim. ""It's a new team. You can't compare this team to the one we had last season or the one we had two seasons ago."""
132,13/09/2017,23:24,Leipzig hold Monaco on Champions League debut,Youri Tielemans levelled a minute after Emil Forsberg's opener for RB Leipzig to salvage a 1-1 draw for French champions Monaco in the Champions League on Wednesday.,"With Leipzig making their competition debut, Forsberg's goal raised the roof at the Red Bull Arena. It will go down in history as his club's first on European football's biggest stage, though it is unlikely to be their last. ""It's something special to have score Leipzig's first ever goal in the Champions League,"" said Forsberg after the game. ""I'm very proud."" Despite their inexperience at this exalted level, Leipzig appeared undaunted in this Group G tie. Teenager Dayot Upamecano was imperious at the back, while in-form striker Timo Werner looked dangerous up front. With Monaco's back line holding firm, and their wingers Djibril Sidibe and Adama Diakhaby struggling to strike on the counter-attack, there were few chances to speak of in the opening half an hour. But in the 33rd minute, Leipzig struck. Swedish winger Forsberg found space on the left and blasted the ball past Diego Benaglio at the near post. The euphoria, though, was short-lived as a deep cross from Sidibe found Diakhaby, who nodded the ball down for Tielemans to prod past Peter Gulacsi. ""The coach told me I'd play as the second attacker and talked to me about my positioning and I think it went well for me,"" said Tielemans. Werner, who had twice come centimetres from scoring in the first half, was threatening again after the break, and began to pick up more space as he was switched to a wider position on the left. ""It was obviously an incredible feeling today,"" said 21-year-old striker Werner. ""We were desperate to win today, but sadly we couldn't quite do it."" Several half-chances fell Werner's way, but it was Jean-Kevin Augustin who came closest to breaking the deadlock, denied in a one-on-one with Benaglio. He had another chance in injury time, breaking free of the defence in the Monaco penalty area, only to be called offside. Yet on a night where neither side reached their penetrative best, it ended a point apiece. Leipzig's Champions League debut crowned a blistering rise from the lower leagues since their founding in 2009. After finishing second in the Bundesliga last season, the club were celebrating the biggest night of their history against Monaco. Against more experienced opposition and without their star midfielder Naby Keita, it was not a given that they would avoid defeat in their maiden Champions League appearance. Many of those on the pitch had played for Leipzig since the club was in the second or third division. Few had any idea how RB's still young squad would react to the pressure of playing on club football's biggest stage. The more dangerous side over long periods, Leipzig will nonetheless be as happy as Monaco with the draw. Leipzig next face Besiktas in Turkey, with Monaco hosting Porto."
133,06/09/2017,16:24,Mbappe says change of heart triggered move,Kylian Mbappe revealed a change of heart prompted him to join Paris Saint-Germain from French champions Monaco in a deal poised to become the second most expensive transfer in history.,"The 18-year-old France striker said at the end of last season he had decided to stay with Monaco, but confessed on Wednesday that ""certain events happened which made me change my mind"". Mbappe completed a move to PSG last Thursday on an initial season-long loan as part on agreement that includes an option to buy the teenager for 180 million euros ($215 million). ""I discussed it in depth with my family and I took the decision to join PSG,"" said Mbappe, who comes from the Paris suburbs. He insisted he had not fallen out with the Monaco ownership and praised the club's vice president Vadim Vasilyev, but told reporters: ""There were some things that happened that I will talk about, you'll hear soon."" Mbappe, speaking as he was officially unveiled at the Parc des Princes, said it had been vital for him to stay in France despite strong interest from Real Madrid. ""It's a great pleasure to join this club, it's one of the best in the world,"" said Mbappe. ""It's extremely ambitious and wants to become the best. ""It's putting everything in place to make that goal more than possible and that's important to me. ""It was also important to not leave France after just six months playing at the top level, and it was important to return to the city where I was born and where I grew up."" Mbappe's arrival in the capital follows the world-record signing of Neymar from Barcelona, and the Frenchman is eager to continue his development alongside a highly accomplished cast of players. ""I come into the dressing room with the smallest prize list. These are players who for the most part have won everything already, it's going to be a rewarding experience. I have a lot to learn and a lot to prove."" After splashing out 222 million euros for Neymar, PSG concluded a complicated deal for Mbappe which prompted UEFA to announce a day later that it was looking into whether the club had broken financial fair play rules. But for Mbappe, whose transfer fee could rise to 180 million euros with add-ons, the eye-catching figures are far from his concern. ""For me, the price is what it is, it's not going to change my way of playing and it's not something that's going to worry me,"" he said. ""On the contrary, I think playing with these players is going to free me."""

136,28/08/2017,20:31,"Monaco sign Jovetic, close in on Dendoncker - sources","Monaco have completed a deal to sign Montenegro striker Stevan Jovetic and are set to wrap up the transfer of Belgium midfielder Leander Dendoncker from Anderlecht, sources told AFP on Monday.","The 27-year-old Montenegro captain Jovetic, who had a spell on loan at Sevilla last season from Inter Milan, is set to take the number 10 shirt worn up to now by Kylian Mbappe. Mbappe is expected to complete a move to Paris Saint-Germain, initially on loan, before the transfer window closes on Thursday. Monaco have not yet made an official announcement on the deal for Jovetic, who has also played for Fiorentina and Manchester City. Sources close to the principality club also revealed that Dendoncker, 22, will join from Anderlecht, following the path taken by his compatriot Youri Tielemans earlier this summer. Dendoncker's agent, who also represents Tielemans, met with representatives of Monaco and Anderlecht at a hotel in the principality last Thursday, the day of the draw for the Champions League group stage. Earlier reports indicated that Monaco would pay 21 million euros ($25.2 million), not including bonuses, for Dendoncker. However, that fee would be lowered if Soualiho Meite moved in the other direction. Midfielder Meite was bought by Monaco earlier this summer from another Belgian club, Zulte Waregem, for eight million euros."
137,28/08/2017,03:01,Mbappe on verge of stunning PSG move,"Monaco's teen sensation Kylian Mbappe is expected to complete a stunning move to Paris Saint-Germain when he flies into the French capital on Monday, according to widespread French media reports Sunday.","Radio stations France Info and RMC reported that PSG had agreed to pay 180 million euros ($215 million) including bonuses for the 18-year-old French international striker. That would make him the second most expensive transfer in football history behind Neymar, who joined PSG from Barcelona for 222 million euros earlier this month. However, concerns over meeting UEFA's Financial Fair Play (FFP) obligations mean PSG could initially sign Mbappe on loan, according to sports daily L'Equipe. ""Monaco and PSG on Sunday reached an agreement for a loan move for Kylian Mbappe to the Parisian club with an option to buy for 180 million euros,"" said L'Equipe, adding that Mbappe would undergo a medical by Monday morning. Mbappe is due to leave the principality on Monday morning along with Monaco winger Thomas Lemar and fly to Paris on his way to teaming up with the French national squad. France will play a World Cup qualifier against the Netherlands at the Stade de France on Thursday and a game against Luxembourg in Toulouse next weekend. France coach Didier Deschamps insisted last week when he named his squad that no player would be allowed to leave the national team camp at Clairefontaine, around 50 kilometres south of Paris, to complete a transfer. With the transfer window closing on Thursday, that means Mbappe is set to complete the move on Monday, allowing him to team up with Neymar and Edinson Cavani in a mouthwatering PSG attack after the international break. After being left out of the Monaco squad last week, Mbappe was an unused substitute for Sunday night's game against Marseille as the reigning French champions won 6-1. That saw them join PSG at the top of the Ligue 1 table with four wins from four games at the start of the season. Asked after the game about Mbappe's expected departure, Monaco coach Leonardo Jardim said: ""I am not confirming anything. It is not my role to discuss that. My role is on the field. ""He is a Monaco player. That is why he was on the bench. But after it went 4-0 I didn't need him. The club's project is to bring through the best players."" Mbappe was outstanding in the second half of last season but he has not played in any of Monaco's last three games as they extended their record winning run to 16 league games. ""Kylian is a star and a top-level player. But for six months last year we often played without him and won,"" added Jardim. Mbappe refused to speak to French television at the end of Sunday's game. Also targeted by Real Madrid this summer, a move for Mbappe to PSG will leave many wondering how the Qatar-owned club can avoid sanctions from European football's governing body considering the investment already made on Neymar. FFP rules currently stipulate that clubs cannot post losses of more than 30 million euros over the three-year period to 2018. Among the sanctions risked by PSG if they are found to have broken those rules is a ban from the Champions League. Mbappe burst onto the scene in the second half of last season and scored 15 goals in 29 appearances in Monaco's run to the French title. He netted 26 times in 44 matches in all competitions. Brought up in the northern suburbs of Paris, Mbappe was compared to a young Thierry Henry as he first broke into the Monaco side in December 2015, just before his 17th birthday. He has won four caps for France."

""Monaco and PSG on Sunday reached an agreement for a loan deal for Kylian Mbappe to the Parisian club with an option to buy for 180 million euros,"" said L'Equipe, adding that Mbappe would undergo a medical by Monday morning.

139,25/07/2017,14:58,Real Madrid reach Mbappe deal with Monaco - report,"Real Madrid have reportedly reached a world record deal in principle to sign Kylian Mbappe from Monaco for 180 million euros ($210m, £160m), closing one of the hottest transfer sagas of the summer.","Spanish sports daily Marca, citing sources close to the negotiations, said the gifted teenage striker who shot to stardom last season is expected to join Real ""in the next few days"" on a six year deal. French newspapers Le Parisien and Nice Matin were quick to announce that Monaco had denied the report. But in the cloak and dagger climate of rumour and innuendo that characterises football's transfer operations, the latest twist revived speculation surrounding the future of Europe's most-eligible young star. Only the rumour mill surrounding Neymar and the massive sums involved have come close to eclipsing the buzz generated by Mbappe in recent weeks. Neymar, Barcelona's 25-year-old Brazilian superstar, is at the centre of frenzied speculation linking him to Paris Saint-Germain for a world record 222-million-euro. The likelihood of that deal looks to have receded in the past few days as the Mbappe move takes centre stage. And if it goes through, Real will have completed a major coup by snatching one of the most coveted young players in football from under the noses of top European clubs including PSG and Premier League giants including Manchester City. Real, currently on tour in the United States and due to play Manchester City in Los Angeles on Wednesday, have yet to comment on the Spanish report. But Marca, known to have strong links to the Madrid club, insisted that Real are set to pay between 150-160m euros with add-ons of between 20 and 30m for Mbappe, dwarfing the current world transfer record of 105m Manchester United paid to lure Paul Pogba from Juventus last year. Real are looking to fill the void left by Alvaro Morata who joined Premier League champions Chelsea last Friday in a deal reported to be worth up to 80 million euros. Madrid coach Zinedine Zidane, asked about Mbappe last week, said that Real were short one attacker after Morata's departure but chose his words carefully. ""I am not saying we are lacking a centre forward but we are short of one attacker, that's how things are,"" he said. ""We will see how we will manage that."" If he does arrive at Zidane's European champions the 18-year-old will be on a net annual salary of ""seven million"" euros, Marca said. Mbappe, under contract at Monaco until 2019, has been wooed so hard by some of Europe's top clubs that Monaco raised the red card and warned the circling predators that they could be reported to FIFA, world football's governing body. ""Top European football clubs made contact with Kylian Mbappé and his entourage without our authorisation,"" Monaco said on their website. The club said they wanted to remind these clubs that such actions are contrary to French and international regulations. Mbappe scored six goals in 10 Champions League outings and 16 in Ligue 1 as he exploded onto the scene in the second half of last season. On Monday, Monaco lost full-back Benjamin Mendy to Manchester City in a world record 52 million (58 million euros, $67 million) deal for a defender."
140,24/07/2017,15:13,Monaco's Mendy completes record Man City move,Monaco full-back Benjamin Mendy on Monday signed a mega five-year contract with Manchester City making him the world's most expensive defender.,"The 23-year-old, who joined the French champions from Marseille last summer, has agreed a deal reported to be worth a record £52 million (58 million euros, $67 million) for a defender. The France player will link up with his new teammates in the United States where Pep Guardiola's side are preparing for their second pre-season tour game against Real Madrid in Los Angeles. ""I am absolutely delighted to be joining Manchester City,"" Mendy said. ""They are one of Europe's leading clubs and in Pep Guardiola they have a manager committed to playing attacking football. ""I am sure that over the next few years we will be successful."" Tottenham's Kyle Walker and goalkeeper Ederson are the other players to join a new-look City backline with Mendy's Monaco team-mate Bernardo Silva coming in to bolster midfield. Guardiola was desperate to add Mendy to his full-back options after releasing Gael Clichy, Bacary Sagna and Pablo Zabaleta this summer, but City's original £44.5 million ($55.7 million, 49.7 million euros) offer was rejected. The former Barcelona and Bayern Munich boss had already lured England right-back Walker to the Etihad Stadium in a deal which could be worth up to £54 million ($70.1 million, 60.1 million euros) and Monaco wanted a similar amount for Mendy. The deal took a while to complete, but City's director of football, Txiki Begiristain, was pleased to have secured their first-choice target. ""Benjamin has all the qualities we are looking for in a full-back. For such a young player, he has a wealth of top-level experience,"" he said. ""He is undoubtedly one of the world's best full-backs, our number-one target in this position. We are all delighted to have him here at Manchester City. ""I'm sure he will prove a fantastic addition to the squad."" Mendy becomes City's fifth major signing of the summer and takes their spending to more than £200m (223 million euros, $260 million). The Premier League giants, who have already raided Monaco in the close season having signed Silva, on Sunday welcomed another full-back, Real Madrid's Danilo. Mendy made his France debut in a 3-1 World Cup qualifying victory over Luxembourg in March, and won Ligue 1 in his first season with Monaco. Man City finished third in the Premier League last season behind champions Chelsea and Tottenham."

The 23-year-old, who made his France debut in a 3-1 World Cup qualifying victory over Luxembourg in March, won Ligue 1 in his first season with Monaco after joining from Marseille last summer. The Premier League giants, who have already raided Monaco in the close season having signed midfielder Bernardo Silva, are also close to signing another full-back, Real Madrid's Danilo."
142,15/07/2017,19:04,Chelsea sign 'outstanding' French midfielder Bakayoko,"Chelsea completed the signing of French international midfielder Tiemoue Bakayoko from Monaco, the Premier League champions announced on Saturday.","The 22-year-old joined Antonio Conte's Chelsea on a five-year contract for a reported fee of up to £39.7 million ($51.98m, 45.3m euros) after helping the principality side win the Ligue 1 title last season. ""I am very happy to be here and to join this great team,"" Bakayoko said in a statement on the Chelsea website. ""I have grown up watching Chelsea. Signing was the natural thing for me because it is a club I loved very much in my childhood. ""I am now looking forward to evolving under this fantastic coach and alongside so many great team-mates."" Chelsea may have to do without their new recruit at the start of the season though, as Bakayoko is expected to be out of action for at least six weeks after having keyhole surgery on his knee at the end of last term. Bakayoko was one of the stars of Leonardo Jardim's youthful Monaco outfit that surprisingly beat Paris Saint-Germain to the French title in May, while also reaching the Champions League semi-finals. The completion of the deal is a boost for Chelsea manager Conte, after he missed out on former Everton striker Romelu Lukaku to Manchester United. There had been speculation United might try and stymie the bid for Bakayoko just as they did with Lukaku, as they broke the record for a deal between British clubs of £75m to prise him away from Goodison Park on Monday. However, Bakayoko, whom Monaco will make a tidy profit on having signed him from Rennes for £7m in 2014, had always made it clear that Chelsea was his preferred destination. ""Tiemoue was outstanding as Monaco emerged as one of Europe's best sides last season and we are delighted to welcome him to Chelsea,"" said the Blues' technical director Michael Emenalo. ""Despite his young age he already has plenty of experience as a French title winner, and having competed in the latter stages of the Champions League, we believe he will add considerable quality to our squad."" Bakayoko made his international debut in a friendly defeat by Spain in March, and will team up with compatriot N'Golo Kante in the Chelsea midfield. His arrival also paves the way for the possible departure from Stamford Bridge of Serbian Nemanja Matic. However, Chelsea are not keen to sell him to the original suitors Manchester United, as relations between the two rivals have cooled considerably since the Lukaku affair. Bakayoko is Chelsea's third major signing of the close season so far, following the arrivals of goalkeeper Willy Caballero from Manchester City and Germany centre-back Antonio Rudiger from Roma. The six-time English champions head to Asia later this month for a pre-season tour, before taking on Arsenal in the Community Shield on August 6, and kicking off their Premier League title defence against Burnley six days later."

""Jordi Mboula demonstrated some great things with Barca's academy and Monaco are offering him an ideal environment to carry on his development,"" said Monaco vice-president Vadim Vasilyev. Monaco have already signed Belgian international midfielder Youri Tielemans from Anderlecht, young defender Jordy Gaspar from Lyon, Swiss international goalkeeper Diego Benaglio from Wolfsburg and midfielder Soualiho Meite from Belgian side Zulte Waregem."

The formal signing is expected in the next days with press reports saying a three-year deal with the option of a further year will be inked. ""Fenerbahce is a very big team based on very good players. There are many important names here. We will achieve great things with great players,"" Fenerbahce quoted the player as saying. The versatile Dirar, who can also play in defence, is expected to bring much needed reinforcement to Fenerbahce after the side finished well behind champions Besiktas and surprise runners-up Basaksehir of Istanbul in the Turkish Super Lig last season. Third place gave Fenerbahce entry to the third qualifying round of the Europa League but only a Super Lig championship would satisfy their fans. Turkish press reports have said more major signings are expected from the side -- traditionally the biggest spending in Turkey - under new manager Aykut Kocaman who has replaced outgoing Dutchman Dick Advocaat."
145,16/06/2017,16:32,Monaco sign Wolfsburg 'keeper Benaglio,French champions Monaco have bolstered their last line of defence by signing the highly experienced Swiss international goalkeeper Diego Benaglio from Wolfsburg.,"Monaco made it as far as the Champions League semi-final last season where some pundits felt Monaco stopper Croatia international Danijel Subasic was found wanting. The 33-year-old Benaglio, who has played at three World Cups and won the Bundesliga with Wolfsburg in 2009, has signed a three-year deal at Monaco. The imposing 6ft 4in (1.93m) 'keeper told Monaco's website how honoured and excited he was about the move after proving himself with 259 Bundesliga games. ""I followed Falcao's season and Kylian Mbappé's development. I can't wait to meet the squad. I'll be doing my best to bring my experience and everything I can to the team,"" he said. Monaco's vice president Vadim Vasilyev said the signing was a major boost for the club. After 61 international appearances Benaglio retired from international football after the 2014 World Cup. ""He will bring all of his experience to our squad,"" Vasilyev said listing off Euros, World Cups and the several trophies he has won with Wolfsburg. Earlier Monaco secured the signing of the 20-year-old full-back Jordy Gaspar from Lyon following the arrival a week earlier of Belgian midfielder Youri Tielemans."
146,26/05/2017,20:54,Monaco's Silva to join Man City,Manchester City began their campaign to snatch the Premier League title from Chelsea next season when they signed Portuguese playmaker Bernardo Silva from French champions Monaco in a deal reported to be worth almost 50 million euros on Friday.,"Silva's arrival, set for July 1, is the first high-profile signing by City manager Pep Guardiola ahead of the 2017/18 campaign. City gave no indication of the length of Silva's contract nor did they specify a fee, although British media reports suggested they had paid around £43 million ($55 million, 49 million euros) for the 22-year-old. Manchester United were also said to be interested in signing Silva but it was the Etihad Stadium club he opted for after flying into Manchester Airport on Thursday. ""It feels greatou have the opportunity of being trained by Guardiola, you don't say no. If not the best coach in the world, he is one of the best. ""As we all know, what he did in Barcelona and Bayern Munich was amazing and we expect also here that he will win titles. It's great to be working with him and to have this opportunity,"" added Silva, capped 12 times by Portugal. Silva started his career with Portuguese giants Benfica before moving to Monaco in 2014 on a season-long loan. But so impressive was his start to life in French football, the deal was made permanent six months in. Last season saw Silva score 10 goals in 51 appearances last season, and assist in the creation of a further 10, as Monaco won Ligue 1 and reached the semi-finals of the Champions League, having beaten Tottenham Hotspur, City and Germany's Borussia Dortmund en route. ""Muito Obrigado Bernardo... and Good Luck!,"" said Monaco on their website. Spaniard Guardiola recently cleared out four senior players including winger Jesus Navas and defender Gael Clichy after the club finished a distant third behind Premier League champions Chelsea this term. As well as Navas and Clichy, goalkeeper Willy Caballero and Bacary Sagna were also deemed surplus to requirements by Guardiola, with it having long been apparent that Pablo Zabaleta, who signed for English top-flight rivals West Ham on Friday, was on his way out. Meanwhile the City future of midfielder Yaya Toure remains uncertain after he was initially sidelined by Guardiola, only to fight his way back into the reckoning for a first-team place. The 34-year-old Ivory Coast international is also out of contract and it is not clear whether he would accept the likely pay cut needed to secure a short-term deal. It leaves Guardiola looking to City's Middle East owners for money to spend on up to five new players as he tries to close the 15-point gap between his side and Chelsea, with the club also finishing eight point adrift of second-placed Tottenham."
147,09/05/2017,22:49,Alves special sends ruthless Juve into final,A stunning Dani Alves volley helped Juventus stroll into their second Champions League final in three years on Tuesday as a 2-1 win on the night completed a 4-1 aggregate victory over outclassed Monaco.,"Brazilian wing-back Alves's 25-yard strike followed Mario Mandzukic's opener for the treble-chasing Italian champions as any semblance of a contest was snuffed out by half-time. Teenage superstar Kylian Mbappe pulled a goal back for the principality club after the break, his sixth of the competition. But there was never any realistic prospect of them threatening to overturn a 2-0 deficit from last week's first leg. It will be the ninth time Juventus, runners-up in 2015, have contested the final of Europe's elite club competition. And on this evidence, Massimiliano Allegri's sinewy, battle-hardened squad stand a good chance of adding to the club's meagre return of two triumphs when they meet either Atletico Madrid or Real Madrid in Cardiff on June 3. Allegri made only one change from last week's first leg line-up but was soon forced to restore it as Germany midfielder Sami Khedira, returning from suspension, lasted only 10 minutes before limping off to make way for Claudio Marchisio. For Monaco, the loss of Nabil Dirar to injury in the warm-up meant a hasty return for Benjamin Mendy as coach Leonardo Jardim opted to match Juve's 3-5-2 set-up. The results were initially encouraging and Mbappe squeezed a fifth-minute shot past Gianluigi Buffon from a tight angle and held his head in his hands as it came back off the inside of the post, although the offside flag had come up. The home supporters had to wait quarter of an hour to see their side emerge meaningfully from their own half. But they were soon being treated to some slick entertainment that at times left the visitors looking like spectators. Paulo Dybala made amends for slicing Gonzalo Higuain's knockdown wide from the edge of the area by deftly playing his fellow Argentinian into a one-on-one with Monaco goalkeeper Danijel Subasic. It was the kind of chance the striker usually gobbles up but this one was fluffed with a semi-shanked attempt to dink the ball over the goalkeeper. Mandzukic had a similar chance but saw his toe-poked effort saved by Subasic before Andrea Raggi's last-ditch block denied Dybala. But a goal was coming and it duly arrived 12 minutes before the break after a move that began with a Buffon throw out. Dybala supplied Alves on the right and his deep cross picked out Mandzukic advancing on the back post. Again Subasic saved at close range but the rebound fell kindly for the Croatian striker to thump the loose ball into the roof of the net. The deflated body language of Monaco's young side told its own story and any doubt about the outcome disappeared a minute before the interval. Subasic did well again to keep out Dybala's effort with another close-range stop and he got a firm fist to the resulting corner. But the clearance fell invitingly for Alves 25 yards out and the Brazilian's volley was timed sweetly enough to beat the Monaco goalkeeper to his left by sheer pace. Comprehensively outplayed, Monaco restored a bit of pride when Mbappe pulled a goal back midway through the second period. Portugal midfielder Joao Moutinho was the architect, working his way into the left side of the box. His cross was clipped low from the byline and Mbappe showed quick feet to bundle it over the line in a manner reminiscent of a young Thierry Henry, also once a Monaco prodigy."
148,08/05/2017,18:29,Monaco cling to hope of miracle in Turin,Even Monaco coach Leonardo Jardim rates it as only a one in 20 shot.,"And many would say that is an optimistic view of his young side's chances of overturning a 2-0 deficit against Juventus in the second leg of their Champions League semi-final here on Tuesday. The free-scoring French champions-in-waiting have struck three goals 27 times this season. But nobody has managed that against a Juve defence that has conceded twice only five times in 51 outings in this campaign, has not lost at home in 20 months and has leaked only two goals in 11 Champions League matches. The stats are even more compelling when the 'Old Lady' has been at full strength, as she was when she snuffed out Monaco's attacking threat in the Riviera principality last week, or when Leo Messi and co. were neutralised in a quarter-final demolition job on Barcelona. Against that backdrop, Jardim said his primary task has been to instil a belief in his squad that they are not contesting a dead rubber. ""Of course we have to do something different. If you lose 2-0 at home it is obvious you have to come up with something extra,"" Jardim said on the eve of the match. ""In Monaco we were beaten on efficiency: our shots on goal count was about the same. The difference was their success rate was 100 percent, ours was zero."" Juve boss Massimiliano Allegri laughed off a suggestion the tie was done and dusted. ""You never know what can happen in a match. Monaco might approach it in a very different way making it much more open and they have players of great potential, great talent,"" he said. ""We have to start from zero again, make sure we play a very aggressive game and hopefully be technically better than we were in Monaco, where we had many opportunities to create dangerous situations and too often made mistakes. ""We need to do better in Monaco's half and show more patience."" Monaco striker Valere Germain missed a late chance to reduce Juve's advantage in the first leg and he admitted a young squad had been given a lesson in professionalism by their more experienced rivals. ""When you see someone like (Croatian forward Mario) Mandzukic, with all the medals he has, working like he did on the left of midfield. Or when you see how they scream at each other for the good of the team at free-kicks -- it was a lesson for us. ""It is going to be very, very hard but you never know. If we score early and some decisions go our way ..."" Gonzalo Higuain was Juve's hero in Monaco, scoring twice from Dani Alves assists. In the process he upstaged Monaco's 18-year-old star Kylian Mbappe on the biggest night of his career to date. Mbappe is one of the hottest properties in football and Tuesday represents the perfect stage for him to re-polish those credentials after the chastening experience of the first leg. But Higuain's ability to conjure goals from the slimmest of opportunities means Monaco cannot throw caution to the wind. ""Yes we need to attack but with cool heads. Against a team like Juve if you leave yourself too open you can find yourself losing two or three goals at the other end very quickly,"" Jardim said. The only injury doubt on either side concerns Monaco defender Benjamin Mendy, after holding midfielder Tiemoue Bakayoko was declared fit. The hosts are on the verge of wrapping up a sixth straight Italian title. They looked out of sorts in a 1-1 draw with local rivals Torino at the weekend but, with matches to spare in Serie A, Allegri rested a string of key players ahead of Tuesday's encounter and Sunday's potential title-clincher at Roma. Juve's last Champions League defeat on home soil dates back to a 2-0 loss to Bayern Munich in April 2013."
149,05/05/2017,16:23,Real boss Zidane hails 'exceptional' Mbappe,"Zinedine Zidane hailed Kylian Mbappe's ""exceptional"" breakout season on Friday as speculation mounted that the Monaco starlet has set his heart on a move to Real Madrid.","Friday's edition of the Madrid sports daily Marca said that the 18-year-old Mbappe has indicated his desire to join the reigning European champions. Asked about speculation linking Mbappe to Europe's biggest clubs, Zidane said that fellow Frenchman Mbappe had once very nearly joined the Real youth academy. ""He almost signed at Real Madrid (when he was younger), it did not happen,"" said the Real coach. ""He is a player who is showing all his qualities and is having an exceptional season,"" Zidane told a press conference, declining to elaborate so as not to add to the rumours about the youngster's future. ""Even though I have an opinion, it's never very good to talk about players who are not my players."" Marca did not name its sources but said there had been contact between Real and people close to Mbappe, who has been compared to Thierry Henry at the same age and has hit 14 league goals this term for Monaco. If the forward does leave Monaco this summer there will be a scramble for his services and suggestions he could command a fee of above 100 million euros ($109 million)."
150,05/05/2017,01:48,Monaco revert to title chase after Euro blow,Monaco coach Leonardo Jardim has called on his players to put their Champions League disappointment out of their minds and take a big step towards securing the French title when they go to Nancy on Saturday.,"The principality side look set to bow out of the Champions League in the semi-finals after losing 2-0 at home to a superior Juventus at the Stade Louis II in Wednesday's first leg. Only two sides have ever recovered from losing the first leg at home to win a Champions League tie, but that is what Monaco have to do now in the return next Tuesday. Things are rather more straightforward in Ligue 1, where Monaco sit three points clear of Paris Saint-Germain and six ahead of Nice with a game in hand on their two pursuers. Given their better goal difference, two wins from their last four matches should suffice for Monaco to secure a first French championship since 2000. ""The best thing to do now is think about Nancy. A win there would give us a great chance to win the league,"" said Portuguese coach Jardim. ""We have an advantage in the league but nothing is won yet so my message to the players is to go out and win the next match. It is not true that PSG or Nice are out of it."" It has already been a memorable season for Monaco, who are the first French club to reach the last four of Europe's elite competition in seven years. But the league has always been the main priority. ""Our run in the Champions League is something extraordinary. We have to be proud of it. It is greater than winning a Cup,"" added Jardim. ""The players need 72 hours to recuperate, which they don't have to prepare for Nancy. As always we will send out the most competitive team we can."" Monaco won 6-0 at home to Nancy earlier in the season and it is hard to see them slipping up at the Stade Marcel-Picot against opponents who lie in the relegation zone, even if marauding left-back Benjamin Mendy will miss the game with the hamstring problem that also ruled him out in midweek. PSG need Monaco to slip up after a 3-1 defeat away to Nice last weekend reduced their prospects of winning a fifth consecutive title. Unai Emery's men entertain bottom side Bastia at the Parc des Princes on Saturday afternoon and will do so without both Thiago Motta and Angel Di Maria after they were sent off in Nice. ""It's not easy starting the week after a loss, but we are professionals and we need to keep working to bounce back, to get back to our best and produce the best possible performance against Bastia this Saturday,"" PSG's Germany star Julian Draxler told the club's website. Beating PSG kept alive Nice's chances of leapfrogging the capital side and snatching automatic Champions League qualification. However, Nice -- whose leading scorer Mario Balotelli was at the Stade Louis II for Monaco's clash with Juventus -- are not likely to have it easy this weekend as they travel to face Europa League chasers Marseille at the Velodrome. Nice have not lost in 12 games but Marseille are one of four sides fighting it out for two Europa League places. Saint-Etienne and Bordeaux play each other on Friday while Lyon, currently fourth, must rouse themselves for a home clash with Nantes after a 4-1 defeat away to Ajax in their Europa League semi-final first leg all but ended their dreams of winning that competition."
151,03/05/2017,22:37,Higuaín double propels Juve to win at Monaco,Gonzalo Higuain scored both goals as an imperious Juventus beat Monaco 2-0 in their Champions League semi-final first leg on Wednesday to take a huge step towards next month's final in Cardiff.,"Both of Higuain's goals came from Dani Alves assists, with the Argentine hitman rounding off a breathtaking team move to open the scoring just before the half-hour mark and converting the second from close range after the break. While the second leg in Turin next Tuesday will be no formality, Juventus have never lost a two-legged European tie to French opposition and so impressive were they at the Stade Louis II that it is hard to imagine Monaco recovering. Higuain, who now has 31 goals this season, received applause from all around the ground as he came off to be replaced by Juan Cuadrado late on after a clinical display that showed just why Juve paid 90 million euros ($98m) to sign him from Napoli last year. In contrast Monaco, having won their previous 13 matches at the Stade Louis II and been so thrilling going forward all campaign, could not find a way through the brilliant away defence. They will now need something very special next week if they are to make it to a first Champions League final since 2004. ""Goals were not coming for me in this competition but I knew I just had to stay calm and keep working hard,"" said Higuain after ending a seven-game run without scoring in the Champions League knockout stages. ""We also wanted another clean sheet and we are delighted with the result."" Juventus coach Massimiliano Allegri raised eyebrows with his team selection as he ditched his favoured back four, bringing Andrea Barzagli into a three-man defence in an attempt to thwart Monaco's prolific attack. The tactic worked, although the absence of the marauding left-back Benjamin Mendy from the home side also played into their hands. Monaco did grow into the game after a slow start and teen sensation Kylian Mbappe was first to test Gianluigi Buffon with a header from Nabil Dirar's ball that the veteran goalkeeper held easily. In the 16th minute the same trio were involved again, Dirar surging down the right and delivering a teasing ball to the near post that Mbappe diverted towards goal, with Buffon saving superbly. Buffon, playing his 149th European game at the age of 39, started his career before Mbappe was born. But he remains one of the world's best and shortly after he was there to turn the ball behind after Radamel Falcao met another Dirar delivery with a terrific leap. Juve are a slick side, sound defensively but with an awesome attacking arsenal of their own and it was they who opened the scoring on 29 minutes in stunning fashion. Paulo Dybala was involved initially before Dani Alves, now nearly 34, surged into the box, holding off Kamil Glik and cutting the ball back for Higuain to sweep home. Higuain bounded over the advertising hoardings and across the running track to celebrate with the away support, before Juve retreated to ensure they held their lead into the break. Although Monaco had glimpses of goal after the restart, with Falcao firing straight at Buffon, they were also their own worst enemies. When Thomas Lemar lost possession in his own half and went down hoping for a free-kick, referee Mateu Lahoz let play continue and Marchisio ran in on goal only to see Danijel Subasic save his shot. But when Tiemoue Bakayoko was hustled off the ball by Dybala, Juventus seized their chance. Alves delivered a hanging ball from wide on the right and Higuain escaped the attentions of Glik to apply a first-time finish. Buffon then intervened to stop Monaco getting a goal back, producing a majestic save in the last minute to tip over Valere Germain's header from a Joao Moutinho free-kick."
152,02/05/2017,20:44,Monaco hopeful on Falcao future,Monaco coach Leonardo Jardim has expressed hope that captain Radamel Falcao will stay at the club for next season and beyond after relaunching his career in spectacular style in the principality.,"""Of course everyone wants the best players to stay in Monaco and Falcao is a great player,"" Jardim told reporters at the Stade Louis II ahead of Monaco's Champions League semi-final first leg against Juventus on Wednesday. Colombian striker Falcao has scored 28 goals in all competitions this season in a remarkable revival after a serious knee injury saw him miss the 2014 World Cup and two seasons on loan in the English Premier League proved a disaster. His current contract runs until 2018 and in January he rejected a lucrative offer to go and play in China. In an interview with French sports daily L'Equipe published on Tuesday he admitted that he would be happy to extend his deal, so settled is he by the Mediterranean. ""Of course I would like to,"" said Falcao, 31. ""I feel great. We are happy and the results are good. Beyond that, everything depends on the objectives of the club. ""The ideal thing would be to make a decision that suits both parties. If Monaco's objective continues to be to win titles in France and in Europe -- which is why I came here -- then I would be delighted to stay."""
153,02/05/2017,01:45,"From has-been to Monaco hero, Falcao savours career revival","Dismissed as a crocked has-been after a disastrous spell in England, Radamel Falcao will savour the Champions League anthem more than most before Monaco and Juventus face off in Wednesday's semi-final first leg.","The Colombian striker will captain the principality club against the Italians -- whose own star striker Gonzalo Higuain was once his colleague at River Plate -- at the Stade Louis II as they attempt to take another step towards a possible Ligue 1 and Champions League double. Monaco have won admirers everywhere this season thanks to the exciting brand of football played by their young team, and the likes of Kylian Mbappe, Bernardo Silva and Thomas Lemar will be targets for the continent's giants in the summer. But all of them will admit the role played by the 31-year-old Falcao has been vital. He scored in a 2-1 defeat to Fenerbahce in Istanbul as their campaign began in the third qualifying round first leg on July 27 last year. More than nine months on he has 28 goals in all competitions and has now scored 45 in 50 European appearances, putting him ahead of German great Gerd Mueller as the most prolific player ever in continental competition. ""I have always believed in Radamel and right from the start of the season I was already saying that he would get back to his best form. Nobody believed it but now we have the proof,"" Monaco's vice president Vadim Vasilyev told French television station TF1. This time a year ago Falcao was considered a busted flush after two seasons on loan in the Premier League, with Manchester United and then Chelsea, yielded just five goals. The Daily Mail labelled him ""a rich man with a broken reputation"", while The Daily Telegraph highlighted how he had been paid the equivalent of £800,000 ($1 million) per shot by Chelsea. He was left out of the Colombia squad for last year's Copa America too, but that reputation has been restored this year in stunning style. ""I think it's all about confidence and having a regular run in the team. The rest takes care of itself,"" Falcao told UEFA.com recently. It is not just about what happens out on the pitch in Leonardo Jardim's free-flowing side, though. He is also finally settled in the glitzy Mediterranean principality. ""I feel loved by the club and by the fans. My teammates support me and I am very happy at the club and in the city, enjoying this moment,"" he said before the quarter-final, second leg win against Borussia Dortmund. ""My family are also enjoying being here and I think these circumstances have allowed things to go as well as possible on the field."" That has allowed Falcao to bury the memory of a difficult first season in Monaco, cut short by a serious knee injury that saw him miss the World Cup in Brazil. It was the start of all his problems, and when Monaco faced Juventus in the Champions League quarter-finals in 2015, Falcao was warming the bench at Old Trafford. Monaco had just wanted rid of Falcao and his burdensome pay packet at that point. However, in January this year they were pleased that he stayed despite a reported 60 million-euro offer from China's Tianjin Quanjian. Falcao has just a year left on his Monaco contract but for now he is only focused on a glorious end to this season. Two wins from their last four league games should be enough for them to take the French title from Paris Saint-Germain, while a first Champions League crown would top it all. ""Not many players get the chance to play in a Champions League semi-final. I don't know if I'll get another opportunity so I want to make the most of it. It is a dream,"" said Falcao, twice a Europa League winner."

""We're going to wait two or three days to see how things are,"" Monaco coach Leonardo Jardim told reporters after his side moved three points clear of Paris Saint-Germain at the top of Ligue 1. ""He's going to wear a mask but he'll have to get used to it during training. We'll see if he can play."" The 22-year-old, who won his first France cap in a friendly against Spain last month, is expected to delay any operation until the end of the season."

""We have won nothing, but we have made history,"" declared Portuguese coach Jardim after the game, as his side extended a run that began in the third qualifying round against Fenerbahce last July, nine months ago. Teenage sensation Kylian Mbappe, skipper Radamel Falcao and substitute Valere Germain got their goals with Marco Reus netting for Dortmund on a memorable night for the hosts. The last team to come through two qualifying rounds to reach the semi-finals of the Champions League was Dynamo Kiev in 1999, although the format was different in those days. Nobody expected Monaco -- conquerors of Pep Guardiola's Manchester City in the last round -- to get this far but they have done it playing a superb brand of football that has yielded 141 goals so far this season. Now they are preparing for their first semi-final appearance since 2004 as they join Juventus, Real Madrid and Atletico Madrid in the draw. None of those teams will fancy playing Monaco, who for all Paris Saint-Germain's efforts in recent years will be the first French representative in the last four since Lyon in 2010. ""We have taken France into the semi-finals. We want to go out and enjoy it but all four sides are capable of winning the competition,"" warned Jardim, whose team were visited by Prince Albert in the dressing room afterwards. Monaco are not just fighting for glory in Europe -- they are also top of the French league and in the French Cup semi-finals, but fatigue is their biggest foe now. ""It's not easy to play in Europe and try to win the league. We are the team that has played the most games in Europe, so it's tough,"" added a coach who has been linked to Arsenal in the British media. ""Maybe if we had lost in the last 16 we would be fresher now, but we won't ask our players to change their mentality. We just need to recover well."" A crunch game at Lyon awaits in the league at the weekend as they look to keep going on all fronts. ""If I have to choose, it's normal to prefer to win the Champions League, but maybe our chances of winning it are slimmer than winning the league. We will give everything in both,"" added the coach. For Dortmund, elimination was hard to take but the tie was overshadowed by the bomb attack on their team bus en route to last week's first leg which left Marc Bartra with a broken wrist. Bartra was there to support his teammates in Monaco but it was another difficult night as their bus was delayed in leaving for the ground, held up by police for security reasons. ""It was the worst thing that could happen a week after the attack -- everyone was on the bus ready to go but we were not allowed to,"" said coach Thomas Tuchel. The kick-off was delayed by five minutes but Dortmund's concentration was again affected. ""It's only eight days after the terrible attack so we shouldn't lend too much significance to the team's performance,"" added Tuchel, who was taking charge of Dortmund for the 100th time. ""It was very difficult for the players so I can't be too critical. We felt ready to push for a semi-final place before the tie but things changed dramatically."" Dortmund are fourth in the Bundesliga and Tuchel added: ""Our path does not end here. We will not be favourites next year but we need to qualify first and then be as unpleasant to play against as possible."""
159,19/04/2017,22:50,Mbappe helps fire Monaco to Champions League semis,Teenage sensation Kylian Mbappe scored again to set Monaco on their way to a 3-1 second-leg victory over Borussia Dortmund on Wednesday that allowed them to win their Champions League quarter-final 6-3 on aggregate.,"Radamel Falcao also netted for the home side in a whirlwind start at the Stade Louis II, and Dortmund were left with too much to do to save the tie. Their skipper Marco Reus pulled a goal back early in the second half but Valere Germain came off the bench to put the seal on a famous win for a brilliant young Monaco side, who go through to the last four for the first time since 2004. Meanwhile, Dortmund bow out after a tie overshadowed by the bomb attack on the team's bus last week that forced the first leg to be postponed by a day. The Germans lost that match 3-2, their minds elsewhere, but their hopes of turning the tie around in the second leg were not helped when their bus was held up on the way to the Stade Louis II, leading to a five-minute delay to the kick-off. UEFA blamed ""heavy traffic"" for the hold-up but, on their official Twitter account, Dortmund said they had been delayed in leaving their hotel by police for around 20 minutes ""without justification"". While the appearance of Spanish defender Marc Bartra -- who needed surgery for a broken wrist suffered in last week's attack -- at the stadium was a boost to Dortmund, the delay unsettled Thomas Tuchel's side and their hopes of turning the tie around were effectively ended in a terrible opening 20 minutes. The away defence backed off as Benjamin Mendy advanced and when the full-back's powerful left-foot strike stung the palms of goalkeeper Roman Burki, the 18-year-old Mbappe was on hand to convert the rebound. That strike meant Mbappe, who netted twice in the first leg, became the youngest player ever to reach five goals in the Champions League, beating Real Madrid great Raul by 41 days. Nuri Sahin cracked a free-kick off a post at the other end and Monaco survived that scare to increase their lead on 17 minutes at the end of a counter-attack. The rampaging Mendy's initial cross came back to Thomas Lemar and he held up a ball that was headed home by captain Falcao, the prolific Colombian marking his 50th appearance in European competition with his 45th goal. Like in the first leg, Tuchel's decision to start with three at the back had backfired and he changed things up before the half-hour mark, bringing on Ousmane Dembele for Erik Durm and revertng to a four-man defence. Dortmund now needed to score three times without reply just to force extra time but they did not manage to get one back until three minutes after the restart, Dembele tormenting Mendy on the right before his cutback was lashed home first-time by Reus. But it was Monaco who had the best chances to score again after that, with Burki tipping over Almamy Toure's looping header and Falcao squandering a fine chance before substitute Germain made sure of their place in the last four. He had only just come on for Mbappe when he applied a first-time finish to Lemar's square ball with nine minutes to go, allowing Monaco to join Real Madrid, Atletico Madrid and Juventus in the semi-final draw."
160,18/04/2017,14:06,Five reasons why Dortmund can win in Monaco,Borussia Dortmund look to overturn their 3-2 home defeat against Monaco in Wednesday's Champions League quarter-final return leg away to the French League leaders.,"Here are five reasons to believe embattled Dortmund can turn things around at Monaco's Stade Louis II stadium: Marco Reus is back from injury and the Germany winger will give Dortmund a substantial boost. Reus is mentally fresh, having not been on the team bus hit by three explosions last Tuesday, en route to the first-leg, which left Marc Bartra needing wrist surgery and his Dortmund team-mates shell-shocked. The match was eventually replayed on Wednesday, 24 hours after the blast, with Reus left out as he finished recovering from a hamstring injury. Last Saturday, Reus marked his return after six weeks on the sidelines with an audacious backheel after 122 seconds in their 3-1 win over Eintracht Frankfurt. Borussia coach Thomas Tuchel played Reus for 45 minutes to build his fitness with one eye on Monaco. ""With Marco on the pitch, all other players have a different attitude and more self-confidence,"" said Tuchel. Reus will be looking to resume his partnership with Dortmund's top-scorer Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang which has yielded 10 Champions League goals this season. Aubameyang, who has score 33 goals this season, will have a point to prove at Monaco, where he spent an unsuccessful loan spell in 2010/11. The Dortmund squad received a timely boost when Bartra left hospital on Saturday. The Spanish defender posted ""proud to be part of this family! #NoWords"" on Instagram alongside a picture of the squad holding aloft his number five shirt when they celebrated after Saturday's win. Dortmund will be playing for their injured team-mate in Monaco. While recovering at home, Bartra received a visit from his ex-Barcelona team-mates Sergio Busquets and Jordi Alba on Monday. Busquets knows all about second-leg shock comebacks having played in Barcelona's astonishing 6-1 win over Paris Saint-Germain to win their Last 16 clash 6-5 on aggregate. Dortmund's single goal deficit is dwarfed by the 4-0 first-leg defeat in Paris which Barca managed to overcome. Dortmund defender Sokratis Papastathopoulos was a pillar of strength at the back against Frankfurt, blasting home their second goal from 25 metres out, which he dedicated to 'Bartra and his family'. The burly Greece centre-back made 17 tackles, launched a string of counter-attacks and won 76 percent of his challenges on Saturday. He needs to again be on his game to contain Monaco's attack spear-headed by strikers Kylian Mbappe and captain Radamel Falcao, but said Saturday's win was a morale booster for Wednesday. Monaco's Stade Louis II has a 18,523 capacity, but 3,000 noisy Dortmund supporters are expected to make their presence felt to try and create a home-ground atmosphere for the visiting team. A cordial atmosphere is expected between the supporters after Borussia fans offered beds to stranded Monaco supporters in Dortmund last week under the Twitter hashtag #Bedforawayfans. Dortmund have only lost three of their 12 European away fixtures since the start of the season, but Monaco have won five of their six home Champions League games this season. Dortmund are attempting to become only the third club to have lost the first-leg at home in the Champions League's knock-out phase and still progressed. Ajax managed it in 1995/96 when they came back from a 1-0 defeat in Amsterdam to win 3-0 at Panathinaikos in Athens in the semi-finals. And Inter Milan also did it at Bayern Munich, who won the last 16 first-leg 1-0 in Italy, but lost the return 3-2 in Bavaria. Monaco have won all 12 of their European matches when they were victorious in the first-leg -- and Dortmund want to make it unlucky 13. In Monaco, Slovenia's Damir Skomina will referee and Dortmund have won all three Champions League games when he has been in charge, including their 2-1 group stage win at Sporting Lisbon in October."
161,18/04/2017,02:02,"Jardim, Tuchel clash with reputations burgeoning","There is just a year in age between them, neither had a distinguished playing career and both have been linked with moves to the Premier League, so Leonardo Jardim and Thomas Tuchel have plenty in common.","They are two of Europe's most exciting younger coaches, but only one will take his team into the last four of the Champions League as Monaco and Borussia Dortmund meet in their quarter-final second leg on Wednesday. Regardless of what happens at the Stade Louis II -- where Monaco will kick off with a 3-2 lead from the first leg -- Jardim and Tuchel will continue to be linked to jobs at supposedly bigger European clubs in the coming months. English media reports have stated that both are on a potential shortlist of successors to Arsene Wenger, should the Frenchman's long reign at Arsenal finally come to an end. Jardim has also been talked about in Italy in relation to the Juventus job amid suggestions that Massimiliano Allegri could move on. Tuchel's name has come up in speculation about who will replace Luis Enrique at Barcelona. ""I don't know. I am so focused on Monaco that I'm not thinking about my future. I have two more years on my contract and I feel good,"" Jardim, 42, told Portuguese sports daily O Jogo in an interview last month when asked if he was considering moving on. Tuchel, 43, was less expansive when pressed on his own future a couple of months ago, replying: ""I'm on a contract with Dortmund and I'm happy here."" Both are still fighting for a major honour as a coach, but they have each had to prove themselves in their profession without having been players of any note. Born in Venezuela, Jardim grew up on the island of Madeira -- better known as the birthplace of Cristiano Ronaldo -- and he started coaching there with lower-league Camacha in his late 20s. Jardim studied physical education at university in Madeira but he left that career behind to coach on the mainland when the chance arose and he has never looked back. His impressive showing in charge of Sporting Lisbon paved the way for him to succeed Claudio Ranieri at Monaco in 2014 and, after some initial difficulties, he has made them the most spectacular side in Europe this season. Monaco are top of Ligue 1 and in the French Cup semi-finals while still pursuing their European dream, despite selling the likes of James Rodriguez, Anthony Martial, Geoffrey Kondogbia, Yannick Carrasco and Layvin Kurzawa since his appointment. ""I recognise the skill of those who do most with less. I see this change in perception, the tendency to want to see if the coach is able to add value to what is there and not just buy, buy, buy,"" he told O Jogo. A former sports science student with a degree in English, Tuchel's modest playing career was cut short by injury but he soon emerged as a promising coach at Mainz, taking over their first team in 2009. His work there allowed him to succeed Jurgen Klopp at Dortmund in 2015 and the work he has done with a young side, as well as the way in which he dealt with the traumatic events of the past week, mean his reputation keeps growing. ""Though Dortmund have slipped behind Bayern domestically this season, there is patience with Tuchel as he is clearly rejuvenating the team in the very literal sense of the word,"" says German football journalist and commentator Ian Holyman. ""Teenagers Christian Pulisic and Ousmane Dembele, in particular, have been given free rein this season and flourished. ""The incidents that marred the first leg with Monaco mean he is unlikely to be blamed for a quarter-final exit should Dortmund go out, and the fact they put up such valiant resistance in the first leg has only enamoured him further to the Dortmund faithful and football fans Europe-wide."""
162,14/04/2017,01:45,Monaco drained but aiming to keep PSG at bay,Monaco must put midweek events in Germany out of their minds and get back to the business of trying to win the French title as the Ligue 1 leaders entertain struggling Dijon on Saturday.,"The game at the Stade Louis II comes in between the two legs of their Champions League quarter-final against Borussia Dortmund, with Monaco leading 3-2 from the first leg. That game went ahead on Wednesday, having been postponed a day earlier following the bomb attack that hit the Dortmund team bus and left their defender Marc Bartra needing emergency surgery on his arm. If Monaco were not affected in the same way as their opponents, the 24-hour postponement has had a knock-on effect on their preparations for a crucial encounter in the Ligue 1 title race. ""Everyone studied the calendar and realised that it wasn't possible to change the date of the game,"" said Monaco coach Leonardo Jardim when asked whether it was right to go ahead with the Dortmund game, albeit a day late. ""We couldn't play on Friday, for example, when we had a match on Saturday. We need at least two recovery days between two matches. ""Our players were also affected. It is important and positive that there were no victims from this attack. Life must go on, that's the way it is. Football and life are not going to stop."" The Portuguese coach, whose side are unbeaten in the league since December, added: ""All Champions League games, not just that one, are very tiring. The players give more than 100 percent and it is difficult to recuperate."" The kick-off for Saturday's match has been put back four hours in an attempt to give Monaco a little extra time to recover. Jardim will rotate his squad for the match against opponents who are in the relegation zone, with France midfielder Tiemoue Bakayoko set to start after being suspended in midweek. Valere Germain should play in attack with Radamel Falcao or Kylian Mbappe getting a rest. Monaco are three points clear of defending champions Paris Saint-Germain at the summit with seven games remaining, but the capital side can move level on points with a win at Angers on Friday. PSG will be without Julian Draxler, Layvin Kurzawa, Hatem Ben Arfa and Grzegorz Krychowiak at the Stade Raymond Kopa, while coach Unai Emery has admitted skipper Thiago Silva is ""not yet 100 percent"" after missing last week's 4-0 win over Guingamp. Their own Champions League hopes went up in smoke in Barcelona last month, but PSG have won 11 and drawn two of their last 13 league games to keep the pressure right on Monaco. ""Monaco and Nice are having excellent seasons. It doesn't matter whether they play before us or after us -- the only thing that matters is winning our matches,"" Emery told reporters on Thursday. Angers, who are 12th, ran the principality side close before losing 1-0 last weekend but their coach Stephane Moulin had a warning for his players. ""We must not think that because we caused Monaco problems we should do the same to Paris. Paris put four past Monaco (winning 4-1 in the recent League Cup final). I think at the moment they are superior to Monaco,"" said Moulin. Nice are four points off top spot having played a game more, and they can keep the pressure on the more-fancied sides above them with a win at home to Nancy on Saturday. A victory will also guarantee them a top-three finish and a crack at the Champions League next season."
163,12/04/2017,20:47,Mbappe stuns Dortmund day after bus attack,Kylian Mbappe struck twice as Monaco claimed a thrilling 3-2 win at Borussia Dortmund in Wednesday's rescheduled Champions League quarter-final first leg to seize the advantage in the tie.,"Police ramped up security in the city as German investigators detained an Islamist suspect over three explosions that rocked Dortmund's team bus on Tuesday and left Spain international Marc Bartra with a broken wrist. Dortmund coach Thomas Tuchel had criticised the decision to go-ahead with the game. ""We would have liked to have had more time to work through it,"" he said. ""There are players who easily brushed it off, but there are also players who really took it to heart. They are more thoughtful."" Dortmund defiantly vowed not to ""give in to terror"" after the harrowing events from 24 hours earlier, but the home side struggled early and fell behind on 19 minutes -- although only after Fabinho missed a rare penalty. Mbappe bundled in the opening goal from an offside position before Sven Bender, filling in for Bartra in defence, headed into his own net to compound Dortmund's problems. Ousmane Dembele pulled one back for Dortmund on 57 minutes, but Mbappe fired in his second of the game to leave Monaco as favourites to reach the last four despite Shinji Kagawa's late strike. Extra forces were deployed around team hotels and their buses took designated safe routes to the stadium. Dortmund players wore t-shirts bearing a message of support for Bartra prior to kick-off, while goalkeeper Roman Burki warmed up in the defender's number five jersey. The 26-year-old was replaced in the line-up by Bender, although Tuchel elected against rushing Marco Reus back into the side having been sidelined since March 4 with a hamstring injury. Monaco were without midfielder Tiemoue Bakayoko, their last-16 hero against Manchester City, due to suspension, while full-backs Djibril Sidibe (appendicitis) and Benjamin Mendy (groin) were both ruled out. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, scorer of a hat-trick when Dortmund brushed aside Benfica in the previous round, rifled a snap shot just over as the hosts fired an early warning. But Monaco were awarded a penalty when Mbappe was tugged back by Sokratis Papastathopoulos, only for Brazilian Fabinho -- who had converted all 16 previous career spot-kicks -- to drag wide of the left-hand post. Their anguish lasted just two minutes, although there was a huge element of fortune involved as Monaco took the lead through Mbappe. Bernardo Silva found Thomas Lemar on the edge of the area, with the Frenchman's miscued effort forced in by Mbappe at the far post despite the forward straying offside. Kagawa then scuffed wide from an inviting low cross from Matthias Ginter, and that miss proved increasingly costly when Bender headed Andrea Raggi's delivery into his own net on 35 minutes. Tuchel rolled the dice at half-time by introducing American teenager Christian Pulisic and Nuri Sahin in place of the hapless Bender and Schmelzer, and the changes immediately reaped rewards. Pulisic tormented Raggi on the right wing, but it was a cross from Raphael Guerreiro on the left that led to Dembele reviving Dortmund's hopes. Aubameyang acrobatically flicked the Portugal international's cross into the path of Kagawa who squared for Dembele to slide into an empty net just before the hour. Guerreiro drilled a dangerous low ball across the face of goal as Dortmund pressed for an equaliser, while Falcao nearly landed a sucker punch only to blaze over on the stretch after rounding Burki following a superb pass from Lemar. But Mbappe was less forgiving, intercepting a risky pass from Lukasz Piszczek and sprinting towards the Dortmund goal before finishing superbly past Swiss international Burki. Kagawa grabbed a lifeline for Dortmund with six minutes left, expertly controlling a Sahin cross and wriggling past Jemerson to slot beyond Monaco goalkeeper Danijel Subasic. But after ending Dortmund's 32-game unbeaten run at home, Leonardo Jardim's side will be confident of advancing to the semi-finals next Wednesday, although they will be without the suspended Fabinho."
164,10/04/2017,20:49,Falcao's return a big boost to Monaco - Jardim,Monaco coach Leonardo Jardim says the return of striker Radamel Falcao following his latest spell on the sidelines is a big boost to Monaco's chances in their Champions League quarter-final against Borussia Dortmund.,"French league leaders Monaco take on Dortmund in the first leg in Germany on Tuesday as they continue their bid to repeat their run to the final in 2004. The 31-year-old Colombian Falcao netted for Monaco in Saturday's 1-0 win at Angers in his first start since the end of February due to fitness issues. It was his 25th goal in 32 games this season in all competitions. The ex-Manchester United and Chelsea forward has hit six Champions League goals so far, including two at Manchester City in the 5-3 defeat in the last 16, first leg. Monaco won that tie on away goals thanks to a 3-1 win in the return at home, setting up the tie against Dortmund. ""Radamel Falcao's return means more quality and experience in our side,"" said Jardim. ""We have noticed the difference (he makes) before in the Champions League."" Falcao is set to partner teenage star Kylian Mbappe, already a full France international at 18, with Valere Germain making way. Monaco have been scoring an average of nearly three goals per game in Ligue 1. However, in Dortmund they will be missing right-back Djibril Sidibe, who was taken to hospital with appendicitis over the weekend. In addition, highly-rated midfielder Tiemoue Bakayoko is suspended. ""We know we have a couple of problems with Sidibe and Bakayoko missing, but we must rely on our strength in depth,"" said Jardim. ""It will be a very intense game against a very good side with very good players."" Thomas Tuchel's Dortmund squad contains several members of the side which reached the Champions League final in 2013 before losing to Bayern Munich at Wembley. ""They have more European experience than we do, which is an advantage, and they have a deeper squad,"" added Jardim. ""We will have to play to our strengths and show who we are. But we also have to be wary of their quality when defending. There has to be a balance."" Monaco entered the Champions League in the third qualifying round in July, beating Fenerbahce of Turkey 4-3 on aggregate. ""It is not easy trying to play at full intensity every three days,"" said Jardim. ""I don't know if a team ever went from the third qualifying round to the quarter-finals. We have had the most games of any team so far."""
165,10/04/2017,01:36,"Talent factories Monaco, Dortmund showcase shooting stars",Youth will be showcased on Tuesday when the talent factories of Borussia Dortmund and Monaco square off in the Champions League quarter-finals.,"Both clubs pride themselves on the business model of recruiting raw, young talent to nurture into superstars. The first-leg quarter-final at Borussia's Signal Park Iduna sees Monaco, whose squad average 25.3 years, shade Dortmund, at 25.6 years, for the youngest of the last eight teams in Europe. Both clubs are packed with rising stars. Dortmund's Christian Pulisic, is a fully-fledged US international who turns 19 in September. In April 2016, the attacking midfielder became the youngest foreigner to score in Bundesliga history. His rise through the US youth national teams was mirrored at Dortmund where he was promoted to the first-team after just 15 academy games. Monaco's forward Kylian Mbappe turns 19 in December and made his France debut last month. He broke Thierry Henry's 21-year-old record in December 2015 when he became Monaco's youngest player, aged 16 years and 347 days, then broke another Henry record two months later by scoring his first goal. Mbappe and Pulisic proved their worth in the Champions League last 16. Mbappe gave his side the lead to help beat Manchester City 3-1 in their stunning second-leg win, as Monaco went through on away goals after a 6-6 draw on aggregate. Likewise, Pulisic scored his first Champions League goal last month in the 4-0 second-leg win over Benfica. His second-half strike opened the floodgates as Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang went on to score a hat-trick to progress 4-1 on aggregate. Both Dortmund and Monaco are seeing their recruitment policy bear fruit. Alongside Mbappe, Monaco have defender Djibril Sidibe, 24, defensive midfielder Tiemoue Bakayoko and winger Bernardo Silva, both just 22 -- and all four are internationals. Likewise, Dortmund's winger Ousmane Dembele, 19, plays for France, Julian Weigl, 21, is a Germany international, Raphael Guerreiro, 23, won Euro 2016 with Portugal and Emre Mor is nicknamed ""the Turkish Messi"" by his home press. Both club's philosophies were born of financial necessity. Dortmund came back from the brink of bankruptcy in 2005, leaving CEO Hans-Joachim Watzke vowing never to spend heavily to buy in success. Dortmund make their money from the stock exchange, having first been floated in 2000, but spend carefully. On average, Dortmund spend 11.2 million euros ($10.5m) for a new player - a reasonable risk which leaves the door open to a huge increase if sold on. ""This is the only possible way for us,"" said Dortmund's director of sport Michael Zorc. ""Our turnover is about 200 million euros lower than the five or six biggest clubs in Europe and our payroll is around 100 million less."" Monaco are backed by Russian billionaire Dmitry Rybolovlev, who bought a 66.67 percent stake in December 2011. However, UEFA's Financial Fair Play rules led to the club being sanctioned for splashing out for Porto pair Joao Moutinho and James Rodrigeuz, plus Atletico Madrid's Radamel Falcao, in 2013. James was off-loaded to Real Madrid, Falcao went on loan to Manchester United, then Chelsea, and a policy change was implemented. Sidibe joined from Lille in 2016, Bakayoko from Rennes in 2014, Silva was permanently signed in 2015 after a loan spell from Benfica, but each reportedly came for 15 million euros or less. Yet all three are estimated to be worth at least double that. As Monaco's vice-president Vadim Vasilyev puts it: ""We are a selling club. But we do not have to sell if we do not want to."" Dortmund are already used to selling top players for double-digit sums. Before this season, Manchester United swooped for Henrikh Mkhitaryan, Manchester City signed Ilkay Gundogan and Bayern Munich spent 35 million on buying back Mats Hummels having sold him for 4.2m euros in 2009. Dortmund's goal-machine Aubameyang, who has scored 32 times in all competitions this season, could be next having hinted he may leave in June. The Gabon striker has made no secret of his desire to one day play for Real Madrid. Having paid Saint-Etienne 13 million euros for him in 2013, Dortmund can expect to make at least four times that."

167,08/04/2017,19:20,Falcao keeps fortunate Monaco on title track,Radamel Falcao marked his first start in six weeks with the only goal of the game as Monaco cemented their position at the top of Ligue 1 with a 1-0 win at Angers.,"Falcao's goal came just after the hour mark and against the run of play, and Monaco were holding on at the end against in-form opponents at the Stade Raymond Kopa. The result extended the principality side's run without defeat in the league to 13 matches and moved them four points clear at the top of the table with a game in hand on Nice, who won 2-1 at Lille on Friday. Defending champions Paris Saint-Germain -- who hammered Monaco 4-1 in last weekend's League Cup final -- can cut their lead back down to three points if they win at home to Guingamp on Sunday evening. For Monaco it was the perfect preparation for their Champions League quarter-final first leg away to Borussia Dortmund in Germany on Tuesday as they stay on course to win their first French title since Claude Puel's 2000 vintage. This always looked likely to be an awkward trip for Monaco against their fellow French Cup semi-finalists, with Angers unbeaten at home since December. Visiting coach Leonardo Jardim named Falcao in his starting line-up for the first time since late February with the Colombian looking to prove his fitness before the Dortmund clash. Teen sensation Kylian Mbappe made way but Falcao and Monaco offered little going forward in the first half. Indeed they were lucky not to be behind at the interval. Cameroon forward Karl Toko Ekambi pounced on a loose ball just outside the Monaco box only to fire wide, while goalkeeper Danijel Subasic made a crucial intervention in front of Famara Diedhiou. The goal arrived in the 61st minute, Nabil Dirar setting up Falcao for a low right-foot finish from 12 yards for his 17th of the season in the league and his 25th all told. Angers did not deserve to find themselves behind but they passed up a glorious chance to level late on when Thomas Mangani's free-kick was headed on by Nicolas Pepe for Ismael Traore to turn the ball against the far post. Subasic prevented Diedhiou from scoring the follow-up. Mario Balotelli scored both goals for Nice in their win at Lille as they came from behind for the fourth game running and extended their unbeaten run to nine games. Lucien Favre's side are now guaranteed European football next season and Champions League football is a probability with Lyon -- who host Lorient later -- 16 points behind them in fourth."
168,07/04/2017,02:20,Monaco braced for battle as title race hots up,"Following a bruising League Cup final defeat to Paris Saint-Germain, Monaco resume their battle against the capital club for the Ligue 1 title with a trip to face the physical might of Angers on Saturday.","The principality club's 4-1 loss to PSG in Lyon ended their prospects of a domestic treble but they maintain a three-point lead over the reigning champions in the league with seven games left. The clubs will also meet in the last four of the French Cup later this month after both came through quarter-final ties in midweek, but it is the league that matters the most and that is where Monaco maintain the upper hand. ""Right now we are three points clear but they remain the favourites, as they already were at the start of the season,"" said Monaco coach Leonardo Jardim, whose side also boast a far superior goal difference. ""We know that seven victories in eight matches should be enough,"" he added. Monaco could be forgiven for having one eye on their Champions League quarter-final against Borussia Dortmund, with the first leg in Germany set for next Tuesday. But they cannot afford to let their guard down against Angers, an unfancied outfit but a powerful team on a fine run of form. They beat Bordeaux 2-1 on Wednesday to qualify for the French Cup semi-finals and they are now unbeaten in their eight home matches in 2017, form that has all but secured their top-flight survival. And with home fixtures against Monaco and Paris Saint-Germain to come in the next 10 days at their newly rechristened Stade Raymond Kopa, they could have a big say in where the Ligue 1 trophy goes. ""Angers are very strong and very physical. They have surprised a lot of people but not me,"" Jardim added. ""Their players are very aggressive and they play a very intense kind of football. It is not by chance that Angers are having a good season for the second year in a row and are in the French Cup semi-finals."" With the nature of the opposition in mind, Jardim may choose to preserve fragile leading scorer Radamel Falcao. ""He is progressing. I don't know if he will be completely ready. We will look at his condition. The problem is his physical condition but also the pain that he sometimes has in his hip,"" said Jardim, who should keep faith in Valere Germain, scorer of a brace in the French Cup win over Lille. PSG no longer have any European commitments to worry about after their crushing loss to Barcelona last month but they are still on course to sweep the domestic honours for the third year running. On Sunday Unai Emery's side host Guingamp, the other French Cup semi-finalists and the last team to beat PSG domestically when they won 2-1 in Brittany in December. However, PSG could start that game in third place if Nice win away at Lille on Friday. The south-coast side are unbeaten in eight games despite a lengthy injury list and were boosted this week when coach Lucien Favre shot down rumours suggesting he could leave the club in the summer. ""Everywhere I have been I have stayed for several seasons. The figures are there,"" said the Swiss, who was in charge at his last club Borussia Moenchengladbach for almost five years. Lyon in fourth host Lorient while bottom club Bastia visit Dijon in a huge game at the foot of the table."
169,16/03/2017,13:21,City lacked fight in Monaco meltdown says Sagna,Bacary Sagna says Manchester City's lack of fighting spirit was a crucial factor in their shock Champions League exit against Monaco.,"Pep Guardiola's side blew a 5-3 first leg lead as they lost 3-1 in Wednesday's last 16 second leg and crashed out of the competition on away goals. Guardiola's attempt to combat Monaco's forwards by going with an attacking approach backfired as City struggled to gain a first-half foothold. But French right-back Sagna felt it was City's failure to match Monaco's desire that caused their meltdown. ""It is a massive disappointment. We forgot to play in the first half, we forgot to fight as a team, defend as a team and press as a team,"" he said. ""We gave them too much respect and against these kind of players, we put ourselves in danger. ""We have to congratulate them, they are through. We are out and we have to recover because on Sunday we have an important game (against Liverpool). ""I expect a reaction from the team. I expect more desire, to show more passion. We did show passion in the second half but it is not enough."" All three goals City conceded raised questions about their defence, particularly the winner, when Tiemoue Bakayoko was allowed to rise unchallenged to head home Thomas Lemar's free-kick 13 minutes from time. With star midfielder surprisingly Yaya Toure left on the bench, City only had Fernandinho to protect a back four that contained only one specialist centre-back in John Stones. ""At half-time we said we couldn't keep going this way or we are out. We had to go on the front step and we had to give them problems,"" Sagna added. ""We changed the system and I think it worked quite well, we managed to create more chances, but unfortunately we didn't score (enough). ""We knew they had quality, they are probably the most scoring team in Europe at the minute. We knew they had quality players, we knew they had dangerous players. ""We conceded six goals over two games. It is never easy to take but we have to, unfortunately."""
170,15/03/2017,22:57,Monaco stun City to reach Champions League quarters,Tiemoue Bakayoko's superb header fired Monaco into the Champions League quarter-finals as Wednesday's 3-1 victory condemned Pep Guardiola's Manchester City to a painful exit on away goals.,"Trailing 5-3 from the first leg in England, teenage starlet Kylian Mbappe put Monaco ahead on the night after just eight minutes at the Stade Louis II and Brazilian midfielder Fabinho converted the home side's second just before the half hour. Leroy Sane's 71st-minute goal handed City a 6-5 advantage on aggregate, but Bakayoko turned home Thomas Lemar's free-kick 13 minutes from time as Monaco claimed a famous win. Monaco go through to Friday's draw for the last eight in Nyon carrying French hopes following Paris Saint-Germain's shock elimination, while Guardiola suffered his earliest Champions League exit as a manager. ""It's an immense joy to score in the Champions League. I didn't expect this,"" said Bakayoko. ""Over two games we deserved to qualify. Now we want to keep going."" The French league leaders suffered a blow before kick-off as Radamel Falcao, who scored twice in the first leg, failed to recover from a hip injury in time and was replaced by the versatile Valere Germain. Jemerson returned in place of the suspended Kamil Glik in defence, while Guardiola, who took charge of his 100th game in Europe, made two changes with Gael Clichy and Aleksandar Kolarov given the nod ahead of Nicolas Otamendi and Yaya Toure. Coach Leonardo Jardim had challenged Monaco to draw inspiration from the side which dumped out Real Madrid en route to the 2004 final, recovering from a 4-2 defeat in the first leg of that year's quarter-finals before knocking the Spanish giants out on away goals. And the hosts were inspired by 18-year-old Mbappe, who has emerged as one of Europe's most promising talents amid Monaco's thrilling pursuit of the French title this season. Willy Caballero stood tall to repel Mbappe's crisp early strike as he knifed through the City defence, but the Argentine goalkeeper was helpless as the teenager poked home Bernardo Silva's driven low cross just a minute later. City recovered from twice falling behind in the first leg, but the opening goal emboldened Monaco as Germain unleashed a searing strike from distance that zipped not too far over. Guardiola had emphasised the best form of defence would be attack for City, yet the visitors struggled to settle and Monaco grabbed their second goal in not dissimilar fashion on 29 minutes. Lemar fed the ball into the overlapping run of Benjamin Mendy, a reported target of City's this summer, and the left-back picked out Fabinho to side-foot beyond Caballero. Mbappe's electrifying pace posed a constant threat for City, but the Premier League side gradually began to pose Monaco problems as well although Raheem Sterling's hesitancy allowed the hosts to clear as the England winger looked to tee up Sergio Aguero. The Argentine striker then skied over from close range after Sane skipped past Andrea Raggi down the the left-hand flank, before Danijel Subasic thrust himself superbly in the way after Aguero was picked out by David Silva inside the area. Sane broke in behind the Monaco backline once more but steered his effort the wrong side of the near post with Subasic charging off his line, but City finally broke through with 19 minutes left. Sterling broke in from the right and his low shot was palmed away by Subasic, but Sane reacted quickest to thump the rebound into the roof of the net and change the complexion of the tie. However that merely drew an immediate response from Monaco as Lemar whipped in a devilish free-kick that Bakayoko expertly planted into the far corner to consign Guardiola to a first-ever last 16 European exit."
171,15/03/2017,12:37,Monaco starlet Mbappe grabs Champions League attention,Teenager Kylian Mbappe will be in the spotlight when Monaco take on the mission impossible of overcoming a 5-3 deficit against Manchester City in the Champions League on Wednesday.,"Scouts from across Europe have been watching the 18-year-old who has scored 16 goals in 30 matches this season, including one against City in the last-16 first leg. Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger in particular has highlighted his interest in Mbappe, comparing him to Gunners legend Thierry Henry who also started at Monaco before going to the London club. Wenger gave Henry his debut when coach at Monaco. ""He's a guy who's electric like Thierry was, can dribble, can pass people and is efficient,"" according to Wenger, who admitted he made an approach for the Monaco starlet last year. ""The talent is similar,"" Wenger said. ""After that, does he have the same level of motivation, desire and intelligence that Thierry had? The next two years will tell us that, but the first signs are very promising."" Wenger said Mbappe decided last year to stay at Monaco who persuaded him to sign a three-year contract that keeps him at the principality until 2019. He has boomed while Monaco have taken top place in the French league race. Mbappe says he has also turned down offers from Paris Saint-Germain and Real Madrid. Media reports have said Chelsea and Manchester United in England, as well as Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund in Germany are all eyeing the teenager. ""We did not expect such a fast and sudden explosion,"" said Alessandro Grandesso, a correspondent for Italian sports daily Gazzetta dello Sport which put Mbappe at number five in Europe's most promising young players. Some experts have warned that Mbappe should not follow in Anthony Martial's footsteps by moving too soon and fading away. Martial's move from Monaco to Manchester United has proved difficult after his explosive start."
172,14/03/2017,21:13,Jardim demands Monaco fix errors for City return,Leonardo Jardim implored his Monaco players iron out the mistakes that cost them dearly in the first leg as they attempt to overturn a 5-3 defeat in Wednesday's Champions League last 16.,"The Portuguese coach is drawing inspiration from Didier Deschamps' Monaco side that made an unlikely run to the 2004 Champions League final, but Monaco face a tall order at the Stade Louis II against Pep Guardiola's men. ""We lost the first game because of our mistakes, it's the small details that cost us the game,"" Jardim said during Tuesday's press conference on the eve of the second leg. ""City were not better than us, if we play the same way without mistakes then I think we stand a good chance. Defensively, we have to be careful because we can't repeat the same errors."" Jardim singled out Monaco's dramatic quarter-final victory over Real Madrid 13 years ago as the reference point for his players. Beaten 4-2 in Spain in the first leg of that season's last eight Monaco looked doomed when Real grabbed the lead in the principality, but two goals from Ludovic Giuly and one from on-loan Madrid striker Fernando Morientes capped a remarkable turnaround. And like Deschamps, who on that famous night warned his players they would concede ""one goal and perhaps the first of the match"", Jardim wants his team to stick to the game plan should a similar scenario arise. ""I think their individual quality will be dangerous and they can score at any time,"" he warned. ""To qualify I think we need to score at least three goals. I think both teams will respect their DNA because I think it's difficult to change the attacking mentality of the players. ""I think there'll be a lot of space and attacking intent tomorrow and, perhaps, a lot of goals."" Radamel Falcao, who scored twice but missed a crucial penalty at the Etihad Stadium, appeared off the bench on his return from injury at the weekend, although Jardim is unsure whether the Colombian striker will be fit enough to start against City. ""Falcao is feeling better now but I don't know if he'll be able to start. We'll wait until tomorrow to make a decision."" City lured Pep Guardiola to Manchester to elevate the Premier League club to the ranks of Europe's elite having reached the semi-finals under predecessor Manuel Pellegrini last season. Guardiola captured the Champions League title with Barcelona in 2009 and 2011 but suffered three consecutive semi-final exits over the past three seasons with Bayern Munich. While his team are in a commanding position, the Spaniard stressed City must stick to their attacking instincts to close out the tie. ""The most difficult thing in football is thinking about your lead, you might be 2-0 up and so you forget to play football after that -- you have to play the game...here has to be the game,"" he said. ""I want to see a team from the first minute looking to win the game...after that at that level everyone can beat you. ""I want to see my team with feeling to win the game...I don't like my team to speculate."""
173,14/03/2017,19:48,Attack the best form of defence for City in Monaco - Guardiola,"Monaco are ""the best team in the world at scoring goals"" in the eyes of Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola, so the only way to beat them is by taking them on at their own game, he says.","""I want to see a team from the first minute looking to win the game. After that, at this level everyone can beat you, but I don't like my team to speculate,"" Guardiola told reporters on Tuesday ahead of the Champions League last 16, second leg between the teams. City take a 5-3 lead into Wednesday's match at the Stade Louis II after winning a thrilling first leg last month, and many teams would be tempted to defend such an advantage in the return. French league leaders Monaco have scored 123 goals in all competitions this season while City have looked defensively fragile throughout much of the campaign. But so have their opponents. Guardiola added: ""Of course we start game not with 0-0, but with 5-3. We know a 2-0, 3-1 or 4-2 (defeat) and we are out. ""We have to play the game, focus on what we have to do. It would be tiring for us to think about running the clock down, that would be a huge mistake, to think about what we have done (already). ""They are the best team in the world at scoring goals, they attack with five or six players, they are physically strong, fast in short spaces. ""When a team scores 123 goals it shows they can score in many different ways, so the best way (to handle them) is to score goals. Take the ball and score goals is the only way. ""If you think only about defending for 90 minutes because you won 5-3, you kill yourself. What we have to do is go to score goals."" Sergio Aguero scored twice while Raheem Sterling, John Stones and Leroy Sane were all on target for City in a remarkable meeting at the Etihad Stadium, in which Monaco had led 2-1 and 3-2 before collapsing late on. Radamel Falcao, who scored a brace, and teen sensation Kylian Mbappe were electrifying for Monaco but Guardiola said his team can go on to win the competition if they can repeat their first-leg performance. ""Yeah sure. Even when we won the competition in Barcelona, or got to the semi-finals at Bayern, we were never sure we were going to win it, but in that way we can win it,"" said the Spaniard, the mastermind of Barca's 2009 and 2011 triumphs. With Bayern, he fell in three straight semi-finals in his three years in charge, while City reached the last four for the first time in their history last season, losing to Real Madrid. ""I am so satisfied already about my personal success,"" said Guardiola when asked about his formidable record in the competition. ""When you see the potential quarter-final rivals they are top, top clubs. I cannot answer if we will win the Champions League but getting to the quarter-finals would be a dream for me and the players."""
174,14/03/2017,15:46,Fast-rising Mbappe puts Europe on alert,"At just a tender 18 years of age, Monaco's Kylian Mbappe is already turning heads around Europe after tormenting defences throughout France and scoring against Pep Guardiola's Manchester City in the Champions League.","With 16 goals in 30 appearances for the French league leaders this season, including nine in his past eight games, the teenage prodigy is drawing plenty of comparisons to former France star Thierry Henry. ""We didn't expect such a rapid and sudden explosion,"" Alessandro Grandesso, a Paris-based journalist with Gazzetta dello Sport, told AFP. The Italian sports daily recently ranked Mbappe fifth in a list of Europe's 30 most promising talents. And while playing down a potential move to Italy, Grandesso highlighted the resemblance between Henry and his heir apparent, both of whom broke into the professional ranks with Monaco. ""It's true that he is gaining visibility and benefitting from the comparison with Thierry Henry, thanks to his quite similar style,"" Grandesso explained. The connection with the 1998 World Cup winner is particularly prevalent in England, where Henry flourished as part of Arsenal's great 'Invincibles' side. Few men are as qualified as Arsene Wenger, who launched a bid for Mbappe last summer, to discuss the likeness of the two players. ""He reminds me of a young Thierry Henry with the same clever look about him,"" Wenger said last week. ""They have the same qualities of intelligence in his movement and cat-like finishing."" The Arsenal manager added: ""I approached him last year because I really believe that he has an exceptional future ahead of him."" But Mbappe, who broke Henry's longstanding record as Monaco's youngest goalscorer, would be well-served to carefully take stock of his options in the summer when Europe's leading clubs will undoubtedly seek to wrest him away from the Stade Louis II. Anthony Martial, another former Monaco starlet, celebrated his big-money arrival at Manchester United in style with a debut goal against Liverpool but has struggled to fully impose himself at Old Trafford following a bright start. On the contrary, Grandesso believes there is also a danger attached to staying at Monaco should the team be dismantled next season. ""He must properly understand what the club wants to do. If it's to stay in a team that starts over from scratch, I don't really see the appeal,"" he said. But rather than signing for one of Europe's heavyweights, Grandesso suggested joining a club slightly below the top rung in England or Germany, using it as a stepping stone where he would be guaranteed playing time. There are also surplus rumours of a move to the Bundesliga, with Bayern Munich unsurprisingly top of the list, but so far there is little evidence to substantiate such claims. Dortmund are in the picture too, their nurturing of another France youngster, Ousmane Dembele, mapping out a possible future path were Mbappe to land in the Ruhr valley. But he remains under contract with Monaco until June 2019 and Mbappe's immediate focus is helping the attractive principality outfit overturn a 5-3 deficit against Manchester City in Wednesday's last 16 second leg."
175,05/03/2017,23:53,Mbappe torments Nantes to restore Monaco lead,Teenage sensation Kylian Mbappe punished Nantes with a first-half brace as Monaco strolled to a 4-0 victory on Sunday to rebuild their three-point cushion at the top of Ligue 1.,"Mbappe volleyed in the opener at the Stade Louis II with just four minutes gone and headed in his second in first-half stoppage time after Valere Germain had doubled Monaco's lead. Fabinho tucked away his sixth penalty of the season on 59 minutes to seal a fifth win in six outings for Monaco, who extended their unbeaten league run to 10 matches. Leonardo Jardim's free-flowing side are showing no sign of slowing down as a three-team title race looks poised to go down to the wire with Monaco chasing a first league crown since 2000. ""I continue to learn from the great players here and I am discovering all the time,"" said Mbappe. Radamel Falcao was left out the Monaco squad with muscle fatigue, but Bernardo Silva and Thomas Lemar returned to the line-up after coming off the bench in Wednesday's thrilling 4-3 extra-time victory at Marseille in the last 16 of the French Cup. Silva's weaving runs were immediately a threat to Nantes and Mbappe profited from a stroke of good luck to guide the ball beyond Maxime Dupe when a shot from the Portuguese international was deflected into his path. Brazilian left-back Lima forced a smart stop out of Monaco goalkeeper Danijel Subasic with a crisply-struck free-kick, but Nantes paid heavily for a pair defensive errors as the hosts killed off the game just before the interval. A poor clearing header allowed Kamil Glik to drill across goal, with Germain bringing the ball down on his chest and stabbing past Dupe for his ninth goal of the season. Silva then pinched possession back from Felipe Pardo inside the Nantes half and his curling cross was glanced in by Mbappe as the 18-year-old netted for the eighth time in his last seven appearances. Nantes compounded their problems when a rash challenge from Koffi Djidji on Lemar handed Monaco a penalty, with spot-kick specialist Fabinho converting for his seventh goal of the campaign. Mbappe had a chance to complete his hat-trick after a sublime first touch enabled him to spin away from the defence, but Dupe dived sharply to his right to palm the ball to safety. Both Mbappe and Silva were then replaced with Jardim already looking ahead to next Friday's clash at home to Bordeaux, as well as the return leg of their Champions League last 16 tie against Manchester City on March 15. Dimitri Payet struck with a clever improvised finish as Marseille recovered from last week's heavy defeat by arch rivals PSG by thrashing bottom side Lorient 4-1 in Brittany to move up to sixth place. Centre-back Rolando headed Marseille into a sixth-minute lead, while Payet grabbed the visitors' second midway through the first half. Florian Thauvin added a third on 53 minutes before Morgan Sanson turned home his first goal for the club since arriving from Montpellier in January, with Cameroon international Benjamin Moukandjo netting Lorient's consolation. Lille goalkeeper Vincent Enyeama saved a late Martin Braithwaite to earn his side a 1-1 draw at Toulouse after Yassine Benzia cancelled out Christopher Jullien's first-half strike for the home side. Reigning champions PSG and Nice both stayed in pursuit of Monaco following respective 1-0 wins over Nancy and Dijon on Saturday. Edinson Cavani scored his league-leading 27th goal from the spot as PSG laboured past Nancy at the Parc des Princes, while Wylan Cyprien's calm finish steered Nice to a vital win at Dijon."

""The key moment of the match was when we failed to go 3-1 up,"" said Jardim of the error. ""Then they came back to 2-2."" City defender Bacary Sagna also said Falcao's 50th minute miss had inspired his side. ""I think the penalty helped a lot,"" Sagna told BeIn Sports. ""It's a turning point of the match -- it gave us a boost again and I think it was a blow to them too."" For Falcao, who had disappointing spells with Chelsea and Manchester United before returning to Monaco it was the second straight Champions League penalty miss. It was a ""disappointment"", was his only comment after. Other Monaco players were more open about the crushing blow. ""After the first half, we could not believe there would be a two goal losing difference at the end,"" said striker Valère Germain. ""There are regrets as well because we let two goals in from free kicks,"" he added. ""There are a lot of regrets. If Falcao had scored ..."" But Germain insisted that Pep Guardiola's City side could never have been under-estimated. ""They are used to playing the Champions League, they were semi-finalists last year."" ""We played a good match, but we gave away presents and let in five goals,"" said defender Andrea Raggi. ""We are going to try to win at home. It is still open, we haven't lost yet. We missed a penalty and let in a goal that was not good, the confidence went down,"" added the Italian veteran. ""It really hurts to let in five goals."" Jardim said the last 16 game was one of the ""most incredible"" seen in the Champions League this year. ""Everyone was happy to see these two teams. There was a lot of quality attacking. Eight goals. But there were a few defensive errors too."" The Monaco coach, who has already been linked to a Premier League future, said it was still possible to come back and still had good words for Falcao despite the miss. ""He is a great attacker. It didn't work for him in England but he showed in this game that he is a great scorer."""

178,22/02/2017,13:48,Toure says City need more goals to see off Monaco,Manchester City's Yaya Toure believes his side must score at least two more goals against Monaco if they are to reach the quarter-finals of the Champions League.,"City twice came from behind to defeat the Ligue 1 leaders in a stunning 5-3 win in the first leg of their last 16 clash at the Etihad Stadium on Tuesday, with Sergio Aguero scoring twice for the Premier League club. But given how their defence was tested at home, midfielder Toure said merely trying to defend their lead was not a viable tactic for the second leg in Monaco in three weeks' time. ""The game is not finished, we have one game to play away in Monaco. We don't have to underestimate them and must try to score goals again. We are a team that can get the goals but we can concede goals,"" Toure said. The 33-year-old Ivory Coast international, out of contract at the end of the season, added: ""Monaco are such a good team, as you could see. People underrated them but it was not easy. ""They are young, they have pace, they have desire and we needed to show more. I think we showed more. After going two down we continued to believe. ""After the game my wife called me and said we were looking young today, the team was brilliant."" Raheem Sterling gave City a 26th-minute lead but a loose kick by home goalkeeper Willy Caballero enabled Monaco to level through Radamel Falcao's header. A dawdling Nicolas Otamendi was at fault for Monaco's second goal, scored by Kylian Mbappe, and then conceded a penalty, only for Caballero to save Falcao's effort. Sergio Aguero and Falcao swapped goals, the latter scoring with a sublime chip. Aguero's volley made it 3-3 in the 71st minute before City surged ahead as further goals from John Stones and Leroy Sane saw Pep Guardiola's men to a remarkable win. ""The goalkeeper Caballero made the important save to be honest,"" said Toure. ""He put us back in the game again."" He added: ""The game was unbelievable. That is why I want to stay in Europe. We saw a real team. We were fighting, running everywhere. ""But we need to continue. We are delighted with the win but maybe we can score more, because in the Champions League it always costs when you concede goals."""
179,21/02/2017,22:46,Aguero stars as Man City sink Monaco in thriller,Sergio Aguero starred as Manchester City beat Monaco 5-3 in a breathless and dizzyingly end-to-end Champions League last 16 first-leg encounter at a rocking Etihad Stadium on Tuesday.,"Raheem Sterling put City ahead, only for Kylian Mbappe to level and Radamel Falcao to score twice -- the second goal a magnificent chip -- as Leonardo Jardim's side moved into a 3-2 lead. But City struck three times in the last 19 minutes, through Aguero's second goal, John Stones and Leroy Sane, to put Pep Guardiola's men in charge ahead of the return leg on March 15. For a long time it looked likely to be a scarring night for City, who reached the semi-finals last season, as a succession of calamitous defensive errors allowed Monaco to take control. But Aguero's doggedness allowed them to haul themselves back into the game, abetted by Falcao's failure to convert a penalty early in the second period. Having recently lost his place in the team to Gabriel Jesus, only to regain it after the Brazilian broke his foot, it was a personal triumph for Aguero, who departed to a standing ovation. Mbappe took Valere Germain's place alongside Falcao in Monaco's starting XI and the 18-year-old in the flourescent orange boots immediately caught the eye. He looked to run at City's defence at every opportunity, at one point leaving Nicolas Otamendi for dead twice in five seconds before setting up Benjamin Mendy, who was thwarted by Willy Caballero. Kamil Glik's evening got off to a bad start when he was booked for taking out Sane, ruling him out of the return leg, but he came close to putting Monaco ahead with a header from a corner. It was City, though, who went in front in the 26th minute. Sane lit the fuse, dancing away from three players on the City left and exchanging passes with David Silva before crossing for Sterling to slide home from close range. But within six minutes Monaco were level as Guardiola's goalkeeping problems came back to bite him. He had restored Caballero to his line-up, having fielded Claudio Bravo in the FA Cup at Huddersfield Town on Saturday, but the Argentine's wayward kicking gave City jitters all evening. It was his loose, lofted clearance that gifted possession to Fabinho prior to Monaco's leveller, the Brazilian playing a one-two with Bernardo Silva and crossing for Falcao to net with a flying header. Moments later came a contentious moment as Aguero nudged the ball past Danijel Subasic and went to ground, only to be booked for diving. On the touchline, Guardiola reacted furiously, angrily gesticulating at fourth official Teodoro Sobrino, but there was worse to come. City had all the time in the world to organise themselves when Monaco won a free-kick on halfway, but Fabinho was still allowed to find Mbappe, who steadied himself before finishing coolly. It might easily have been 3-1 by the interval, with Mbappe and Falcao both going close either side of the former's goal. Monaco looked poised to extend their lead five minutes into the second half when Otamendi was penalised for fouling Falcao, but the Colombian's weak spot-kick was comfortably saved by Caballero. City levelled eight minutes later courtesy of a howler from Subasic, who allowed Aguero's shot to go right through him at his near post after a storming run down the right from Sterling. But the momentum swang back Monaco's way just three minutes later when Falcao shrugged off Stones and then lofted an exquisite right-foot chip over Caballero from just 15 yards. After Sterling had seen a penalty appeal turned away following a robust challenge by Benjamin Mendy, Aguero levelled again, volleying in smartly from Silva's right-wing corner. The momentum was City's and after Stones had put them ahead in the 77th minute, jabbing in at a corner, Silva's dinked pass enabled Aguero to set up Sane to set the seal on an extraordinary match."
180,20/02/2017,17:25,Man City v Monaco - clash of the nouveaux riches,They are the nouveaux riches of football but with very different business models: Manchester City and Monaco's Champions League last 16 clash on Tuesday is not one of equals.,"Since being taken over by Emirati billionaire Sheikh Mansour in 2008, Manchester City have invested heavily in stars and played the international card to revive the fortunes of a club which has since won Premier League titles in 2012 and 2014. The City Football Group oversees the activities of New York City and Melbourne City, and has shares in the Yokohama F-Marinos. ""City's business model is unique because of the City Football Group, which is different from what any other club is doing,"" says Rob Wilson, a football finance expert from Sheffield Hallan University. ""Relationships with other teams tend to be feeder club arrangements, but there's nothing on the scale that Man City have done. ""It enables them to exchange players at academy level, but as we saw with Man City and Patrick Vieira, they can also transfer coaches."" After two years coaching Manchester City's reserves, former France international Vieira was sent to take over the reins at New York City. ""It's like a global conglomerate in many ways,"" added Wilson. ""It's a unique selling point. Manchester United, Barcelona and Real Madrid have tours frequently to those parts of the world and have got themselves market position. ""So Man City are playing catch-up. That physical presence gives them something tangible to sell in each of those territories and gets people engaging with the sky blue of Manchester City."" Abu Dhabi cash has lifted Manchester City to the sixth richest club in the world, according to Deloitte's Football Money League, and the City brand is now ranked fourth in the world by Brand International. Bankrolled by Russian billionaire Dmitry Rybolovlev, Monaco had barely secured their return to Ligue 1 in 2013 when millions were poured into transfers. Over 166 million euros ($176 million) were invested to bring in players such as Radamel Falcao (60 million euros), James Rodriguez (45m) and Joao Moutinho (25m). Rybolovlev has succeeded in putting Monaco back on the European map with a return to Champions League football. But Monaco have been caught by UEFA's Financial Fair Play regulations -- not to spend more than you earn -- and must sell on players at a profit in order to break even. Rodriguez headed for Real Madrid for more than 85 million euros, a record sale for a French club. Coach Leonardo Jardim accepts ""the new project of the club"" to promote brilliant talents in the Champions League and resell them at a high price, such as Geoffrey Kondogbia (Inter Milan), Anthony Martial (Manchester United), Layvin Kurzawa (Paris Saint-Germain) and Aymen Abdennour (Valencia). ""What we've had with FFP is a much closer alignment to financial sustainability,"" said Wilson. ""The key difference between City and Monaco is the broadcasting rights package available to City."" Wilson added: ""The financial resources at Man City's disposal are much, much bigger than what's available at Monaco, so Monaco have to work much, much harder to generate those young players that they can either put in their first team or sell on at a significant profit. ""Monaco have been much quicker at adopting that academy-based model. Man City are doing the same. They're just doing it more slowly."" According to the head of Monaco's training centre Bertrand Reuzeau, ""of a dozen players recruited aged 15 years in the centre, half will become professional -- one or two will integrate the professional group and three or four will finish elsewhere"". Last summer City spent 213 million euros on buying new players -- lead by John Stones (55m euros) and Leroy Sane (50m) -- eclipsing the 190 million euros spent the previous year. By contrast, Monaco's spending was more modest with the arrivals of Djibril Sidibe (15 million euros), Benjamin Mendy (13m), Kamil Glik (11m) and Jorge (8.5m). There are similarities between City and Monaco, but it's still not a level playing field amongst football's rich."
181,20/02/2017,01:23,Man City and Monaco load their Silva bullets,"Manchester City and Monaco go into Tuesday's Champions League showdown each pinning their hopes on short, left-footed midfield creators from the Iberian peninsula who go by the name of Silva.","Monaco's Silva is Bernardo, a 22-year-old Portuguese winger whose knack for decisive goals has made him a central figure in their free-scoring surge to the Ligue 1 summit. Nine years older but no less influential is City's Silva, elegant Spain international David, whose enduring brilliance has enabled him to remain a vital cog in Pep Guardiola's fast-evolving team. ""Amazing,"" was the word Guardiola employed when he was asked to describe Silva's performance in City's most recent Premier League game, a 2-0 win at Bournemouth. English football has proved more resistant to Guardiola's methods than many expected, but Silva has helped to uphold the old Barcelona tenet that if the opponent cannot get the ball, they cannot hurt you. ""The last 15, 20 minutes, with Kevin (De Bruyne), with Fernandinho, he monopolised the ball,"" Guardiola added. ""We pass and pass and pass. It's the best way to avoid the opponent, when you have the ball. There's just one ball."" Like many of City's key players, Silva did not look himself during the final months of Manuel Pellegrini's tenure and finished last season with just two league goals, the lowest tally of his career. After starting all four of Spain's games at Euro 2016, he returned to Manchester to find increased competition for midfield places following the arrivals of Ilkay Gundogan, Leroy Sane and Nolito. Guardiola wasted no time making his mark at the Etihad Stadium, forcing goalkeeper Joe Hart to flee to Torino and freezing out Yaya Toure, although the Ivorian midfielder has since returned. Sergio Aguero's future is also in doubt following the January arrival of Gabriel Jesus, while captain Vincent Kompany has barely featured due to injury. But Silva remains part of the furniture and has adapted seamlessly to an unfamiliar role alongside De Bruyne in City's midfield engine room. ""It is true that I am playing some steps further back sometimes because I have to help in the build-up,"" Silva said earlier this season. ""But Guardiola also gives me freedom to attack and be close to the rival goal and create chances, which is something that I really like. He gives me a lot of freedom and I am very happy playing in this role."" Despite his more withdrawn position, Silva remains a decisive presence and has scored or set up six goals in his last 12 appearances. But he has not had the same headline impact as his Monaco namesake, whose eight goals include vital strikes against Villarreal, Tottenham Hotspur and CSKA Moscow and a recent injury-time leveller at Paris Saint-Germain. ""He's a very important player, perhaps the key player in our team at the moment,"" says Brazilian team-mate Fabinho. ""He's full of confidence. I hope he'll keep scoring regularly. But even when he doesn't score or assist, he's important. He brings a lot and causes problems for defenders."" A thigh injury meant Silva missed Portugal's triumph at Euro 2016, but he has been a pivotal player for Monaco from the moment he arrived on loan from Benfica in 2014. While he lines up on the right of midfield in Leonardo Jardim's 4-4-2 system, right-back Djibril Sidibe's raids give him the liberty to drift infield, in the same manner as Thomas Lemar on the opposite flank. ""He's progressed in terms of his positioning,"" says coach Jardim. ""He's not a player who looks for contact, so he chooses the spaces between the opponents' lines. He's also more effective in the area. He's worked a lot on that."" With David Silva generally operating to the left of centre, he and Bernardo Silva are likely to come into regular contact in Tuesday's last 16 first-leg match. Technique, rather than tackles, will be the order of the day."

The Germans came within a whisker of a win at Monaco when the sides last met in September, leading 1-0 through Javier Hernandez's strike before Kamil Glik equalised for Monaco in the 94th-minute. Monaco are unbeaten in their five matches against Leverkusen with three wins and two draws and have never lost on their five previous European matches in Germany. They are in fine form with four wins and a draw from their last five games having trounced Bastia 5-0 at home on Saturday in the French league. The match is a dead rubber, but Leverkusen need a win to boost confidence following a run of three league games without a victory. In-form Turkish international Hakan Calhanoglu is expected to partner Javier Hernandez 'Chicharito' in attack in the absence of Kevin Volland, who has a thigh injury. Swiss striker Admir Mehmedi is also out with a groin injury while Kevin Kampl, who scored in their 1-0 win at Spurs, has been ruled out for the next eight weeks with a foot injury. Finland striker Joel Pohjanpalo is pushing for a starting berth after recovering from a broken metatarsal. It will be interesting to see who takes over the penalty duties, should Leverkusen be awarded a spot kick. Javier Hernandez crashed his effort off the goalkeeper's boot in Saturday's 1-1 draw at Freiburg meaning his club have failed with all four penalties awarded to them in the Bundesliga this season. The Mexican also failed with a penalty in their 2-1 defeat to Eintracht Frankfurt in September, while Charles Aranguiz and Calhanoglu have also missed spot kicks against Leipzig and Augsburg respectively. Bayer were also beaten on penalties by third-division club Sportfreunde Lotte in the second round of the DFB Cup. ""Having already missed so many, a lot of players are lacking confidence when it comes to taking penalties, including myself,"" Calhanoglu admitted in magazine Kicker. ""If we get our next penalty on Wednesday, I'd want to grab the ball and stick it in the back of the net."""
183,26/11/2016,20:10,Irresistible Monaco blow away Marseille,Monaco kept up their outstanding recent form as Valere Germain scored twice in a 4-0 win over Marseille in the Mediterranean principality on Saturday.,"Gabriel Boschilia opened the scoring from a free-kick before Germain added two more of his own as Monaco put the game to bed before half-time, with substitute Guido Carrillo putting the gloss on the result at the death. The result comes four days after Monaco beat Tottenham Hotspur 2-1 to secure qualification for the last 16 as winners of their Champions League group. It was a fifth straight win in all competitions for Monaco and Europe's most prolific side kept up their remarkable scoring record -- they are banging in the goals at an average of just over three per game in Ligue 1 this season. Leonardo Jardim's men go provisionally top of the table on goal difference from Cote d'Azur rivals Nice, who can move back to the summit when they host Bastia on Sunday. Defending champions Paris Saint-Germain can also move level on points with Monaco if they win away to Lyon on Sunday evening. ""As coach I'm happy, but the merit goes to the players. They understand, and especially the younger ones, that the difference between the big teams and small ones is the intensity put into matches,"" said Portuguese coach Jardim, who played down talk of a first title for the club since 2000. ""One match can change everything. We are an ambitious team and we play every game to win it. We will not limit our ambitions, but we have not built a team for the title."" Monaco's starting line-up showed just two changes to the team that had dispatched Spurs at the same Stade Louis II on Tuesday, with Boschilia and Andrea Raggi coming in for Thomas Lemar and the injured Benjamin Mendy. Brazilian prospect Boschilia opened the scoring midway through the first half when he curled a superb free-kick on his left foot beyond the reach of Yohann Pele and into the top-right corner of the net for his fourth goal of the season. Germain, whose father Bruno played for Marseille two decades ago, doubled the home side's lead when he headed in after a brilliant Bernardo Silva assist. And Germain struck again six minutes from half-time, curling a shot beyond the reach of Pele after good play down the right by Djibril Sidibe. A shell-shocked Marseille, with their new American owner Frank McCourt watching on, had no answer and Monaco secured their record win over OM when they netted again in injury time. Pele stretched to keep out a Germain chip, but Argentine striker Carrillo, who had replaced Radamel Falcao, converted the rebound to make it four. Marseille have won just once, and scored just twice, in five league games under new coach Rudi Garcia and remain in mid-table."
184,22/11/2016,23:25,Monaco send Spurs crashing out of Champions League,Harry Kane scored his first Champions League goal but could not prevent Tottenham Hotspur from crashing out of the competition with a 2-1 defeat in Monaco on Tuesday.,"Spurs needed at least a point to keep their hopes of reaching the last 16 alive and Kane brought them level with a penalty shortly after Djibril Sidibe had put Monaco in front at the Stade Louis II. However, Thomas Lemar ended a whirlwind spell by restoring Monaco's lead in the 53rd minute and the hosts -- for whom Radamel Falcao had an early penalty saved -- held on to claim the win that secures their place in the knockout stages. Monaco are also guaranteed to progress as Group E winners, while Bayer Leverkusen are through too after drawing 1-1 away to CSKA Moscow in Russia earlier in the day. ""It is a beautiful victory. We are happy and let's hope this continues,"" Sidibe told beIN Sports of a Monaco side who are through to the last 16 for the second time in three seasons. ""Our objective was qualification and we are first, which is important. We will savour this before we start looking forward."" Meanwhile, Tottenham will go into their final match against CSKA at Wembley with only a berth in the Europa League after Christmas up for grabs. It is a deeply disappointing outcome for Mauricio Pochettino's men, who have now managed just one win in their last nine matches in all competitions and have lost three of their five games in Europe. ""After we lost the first goal we came back with the penalty but it is difficult to understand how we conceded the (second) goal,"" Pochettino said. ""If you want to go to the next level in the Champions League you can't concede goals like that."" The Premier League side had showed their intent as Kane, Dele Alli and Mousa Dembele all started for despite having been cited as doubts before the game by Pochettino. Meanwhile, Monaco coach Leonardo Jardim named the attacking line-up that has made his team the most prolific in Europe's leading leagues this season. However, Tottenham missed a glorious chance to go ahead inside six minutes when Alli's defence-splitting pass sent Song heung-Min racing clear. The Korean found himself through one-on-one with Danijel Subasic but was pushed wide by the Croatian goalkeeper and the opportunity was gone. Four minutes after that Monaco won a penalty. Fabinho went down in spectacular fashion under an Eric Dier challenge and Dutch referee Bjorn Kuipers pointed to the spot, only for Hugo Lloris to dive low to his right and save Falcao's kick. The home side did not let that miss get to them, instead continuing to look the more dangerous side but it took them until three minutes into the second half to get the breakthrough. Bernardo Silva found left-back Benjamin Mendy, who took his time before holding up a cross for fellow full-back Sidibe -- a summer target for Arsenal -- to head home from six yards. The response from Tottenham was swift, as they won a penalty just three minutes later when Kamil Glik was adjudged to have fouled Alli in the area. Kane stepped up to score from 12 yards and break his Champions League duck. And yet the riposte from Monaco was quicker still as they went back in front straight from the restart. Three passes and then a cross from the right saw the ball fall to Lemar, who took a touch before scoring with a composed low finish across Lloris. Spurs' attempts to draw level were in vain, and only a stunning reflex save by Lloris stopped Glik from scoring after the Pole connected with a Lemar free-kick midway through the second half. The former Nice goalkeeper also produced a good stop to deny Falcao, but Tottenham were out."
185,21/11/2016,02:01,Spotlight on Ronaldo for European homecoming,worldfootball looks ahead to Tuesday's Champions League action as Cristiano Ronaldo goes back to first club Sporting Lisbon and Tottenham Hotspur face a crunch trip to Monaco (kick-offs 1945 GMT unless stated):,"<strong>Group E</strong> At Moscow (1700 GMT) CSKA Moscow (RUS) v Bayer Leverkusen (GER) Morale is on the floor in Moscow with CSKA bottom of Group E before Leverkusen's visit. The defending Russian champions this week saw their midfielder Roman Eremenko hit with a two-year ban for cocaine use after a positive test following the reverse fixture between the teams in September. Eremenko's goal in that match gave CSKA a 2-2 draw after being two goals down. The Muscovites registered their first win in five league games at the weekend and must win this game to keep alive their hopes of reaching the last 16. Leverkusen can progress by avoiding defeat, provided Tottenham Hotspur lose away to Monaco. The Germans are unbeaten in the section, following up three draws by beating Tottenham at Wembley last time out. However, they are struggling in mid-table in the Bundesliga having lost at home to RB Leipzig at the weekend. At Monaco Monaco (FRA) v Tottenham Hotspur (ENG) Tottenham travel to the Mediterranean principality boosted by claiming a first win in eight matches at the weekend, when they beat West Ham United 3-2 after a dramatic late fightback in the Premier League. Mauricio Pochettino's side are in real trouble in the Champions League having lost at home to Monaco and Bayer Leverkusen. They will be eliminated if they fail to win at the Stade Louis II and Leverkusen better their result when they face CSKA Moscow in Russia. Monaco need only draw the game to be sure of a place in the last 16. They will secure first place if they win and Leverkusen drop points. Leonardo Jardim's side are the leading scorers in Europe's big five leagues, averaging three goals a game in Ligue 1, including a 3-0 win at Lorient on Friday. Leading their attack is a revitalised Radamel Falcao, with the Colombian having netted nine times in all competitions this season. The teams drew 1-1 here in the Europa League last season. Toby Alderweireld and Ben Davies are on the sidelines for Spurs and Erik Lamela, who scored at the Stade Louis II last season, is also doubtful. <strong>Group F</strong> At Dortmund, Germany Borussia Dortmund (GER) v Legia Warsaw (POL) Dortmund, the 1997 winners and 2013 runners-up, are already certain to progress to the last 16 having amassed 10 points from their first four matches. Thomas Tuchel's side are now looking to secure top spot and a win at home to already-eliminated Legia will guarantee them first place, as long as Real Madrid drop points at Sporting Lisbon. At the very least, a win will ensure the Bundesliga club go to Madrid next month in a position to clinch the group. Dortmund are fresh from beating Bayern Munich 1-0 in ""Der Klassiker"" at the weekend thanks to Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang's 12th Bundesliga goal of the season. The Gabon star was also on target as Dortmund won 6-0 away to Legia in their group opener in September. Legia, who remain in with a chance of finishing third and going into the Europa League, have improved since a poor start to the campaign. The Poles have won five of their last six games, the exception being a 3-3 draw at home to Real Madrid. At Lisbon Sporting Lisbon (POR) v Real Madrid (ESP) Cristiano Ronaldo takes on his first professional club Sporting as a champion of Europe with Real and Portugal and is widely expected to pick up his fourth Ballon d'Or. He will doubtless receive a hero's welcome on his return to the Estadio Jose Alvalade. Ronaldo's hat-trick this weekend, his 39th for Real, delivered a 3-0 away win at Atletico Madrid despite the visitors missing six key players in captain Sergio Ramos, Pepe, Casemiro, Toni Kroos, Alvaro Morata and Karim Benzema. Champions League holders Real won the reverse fixture 2-1 and are unbeaten in 29 games in all competitions. All Zinedine Zidane's men need here is a point to secure passage to the next round, but with Dortmund top of the group by two points Real will want to hunt them down as a point of pride -- and to earn an easier draw in the next round. Sporting are on an upturn and scoring regularly and are still in with a chance of the Europa League. <strong>Group G</strong> At Leicester, England Leicester City (ENG) v Club Brugge (BEL) English champions Leicester top Group G with 10 points and have yet to concede a goal. Conversely, Brugge are yet to notch up a single point. A draw for the hosts would mean they progress to the next stage with a game to spare. Domestically, the unlikely Premier League champions have struggled to reproduce the form that delivered the title to the King Power Stadium and sit just two points above the relegation zone after a 2-1 weekend defeat to Watford. Claudio Ranieri's men however, including Jamie Vardy and Riyad Mahrez, who are on the Ballon d'Or list, are a different proposition in their maiden Champions League campaign. It even looks as if Ranieri is prioritising Europe over the Premier League. At Copenhagen FC Copenhagen (DEN) v Porto (POR) Copenhagen bagged a 1-1 draw away to second-placed Porto in September and are fighting for Champions League survival in this game, in which a win for the Portuguese would see them qualify. But Porto are misfiring with only two wins in their past five outings in all competitions while Stale Solbakken's charges are unbeaten in their five games at home in Europe this season. Porto go into the clash with the depressing effect of having lost a penalty shoot-out to Chaves in the Portuguese Cup at the weekend, while the hosts powered to yet another win in the league. A win for the Danes would see them leap-frog their opponents in the group. Has the makings of a classic. <strong>Group H</strong> At Seville, Spain Sevilla (ESP) v Juventus (ITA) This is arguably the match of the round with Sevilla top on 10 points and visitors Juve second on eight with a tight 0-0 draw in Italy in the reverse fixture. Sevilla are flying high in Spain after they produced a stunning fightback from 2-0 down to win 3-2 at Deportivo la Coruna. Argentine coach Jorge Sampaoli's version of Sevilla is thrilling fans after transforming the Europa League champions into a free-thinking outfit. Italian champions Juventus go into the showdown on the back of a 3-0 Serie A win over Pescara. ""It's an important game for us because we have to win one of our last two games to go through,"" coach Massimiliano Allegri said. Juve may have to do it the hard way with several defenders carrying knocks, but the forward line of Mario Mandzukic and Gonzalo Higuain is a frightening prospect for Sevilla. At Zagreb Dinamo Zagreb (CRO) v Lyon (FRA) Dinamo cannot qualify for the next round after a miserable Champions League campaign that has seen them fail to earn a point or even score a goal in four matches. They still have the consolation of the Europa League just about alive, but must win this game for starters. Lyon, with four points from four games, are only slightly better off and need a victory in Zagreb and for Juventus to fail to win to live another day. Lyon are fourth in Ligue 1 in France and their form has picked up in domestic competition after a slow start. Bafetimbi Gomis -- now at rivals Marseille -- scored four, including an eight-minute hat-trick, when Lyon won 7-1 in Zagreb in the 2011/12 group stage."
186,24/09/2016,22:40,Monaco grind out win to go top,"With Radamel Falcao out injured, Monaco came from behind to claim a scrappy 2-1 win over Angers at the Stade Louis II on Saturday and move top of the Ligue 1 table.","Falcao was absent after being hospitalised with a blow to the head in the principality club's 4-0 trouncing at local rivals Nice during the week. And Leonardo Jardim's side struggled to get the better of in-form Angers, a Dickson Nwakaeme own goal proving the difference after Kamil Glik had cancelled out Famara Diedhiou's opener. The result allowed Monaco to go two points clear of Nice, who visit Nancy on Sunday, and Toulouse, conquerors of champions Paris Saint-Germain on Friday. Youngsters Abdou Diallo and Kevin N'Doram started for Monaco with Jardim having one eye on Tuesday's Champions League encounter with Bayer Leverkusen. Angers were chasing a fourth consecutive win and they thought they had taken the lead early in the second half when Karl Toko-Ekambi had the ball in the net but the offside flag cut short the celebrations. However, the visitors did go in front in controversial circumstances in the 56th minute as leggy Cameroon forward Toko-Ekambi slid the ball across goal for Cheikh Ndoye. The Angers captain made a mess of his shot and the ball came up and struck his hand before falling for Diedhiou, who scored. The goal stood despite the appeals for a handball. Nevertheless, Poland defender Glik fired in a 66th-minute equaliser from eight yards after Angers struggled to clear and the hosts secured the points with quarter of an hour left. Mathieu Michel saved from Glik but the ball rebounded off Nigerian substitute Nwakaeme and in. Monaco's eighth win in nine games in all competitions came after Lyon missed the chance to move level on points with stumbling PSG as they lost 1-0 at struggling Lorient. Jimmy Cabot scored the only goal of the game early in the second half in Brittany as Lyon lost for the third time in the league already this season. Bruno Genesio's side, who visit Sevilla in the Champions League this coming midweek, had beaten Montpellier 5-1 on Wednesday but that is now their only win in five Ligue 1 games. ""I am not worried,"" said Genesio, whose side were again without injured leading scorer Alexandre Lacazette and suspended captain Maxime Gonalons, although France midfielder Mathieu Valbuena came in for his first start since April and hit the bar in the first half. ""There is no need to panic after this result. ""I often say that the result is one thing but there is also the performance, whether we win or lose. ""We need to keep calm. It is a shame, because it was a chance to climb the table and I think we deserved better."" Champions PSG slumped to a 2-0 defeat at Toulouse on Friday with Yann Bodiger scoring a penalty and Jimmy Durmaz also netting for the hosts after Serge Aurier had been sent off for the team from the capital. PSG are fourth, three points behind Monaco and level on points with Bordeaux and Metz. Bordeaux were held to a 0-0 draw by Caen while newly-promoted Metz continued their good start to the campaign by winning 1-0 in Montpellier thanks to a Mevlut Erding penalty. Bastia defeated Guingamp 1-0 and Lois Diony scored twice as Dijon beat Rennes 3-0. Lille are bottom of the table before they go to Saint-Etienne on Sunday, with Marseille also in action at home to Nantes."
187,22/09/2016,17:43,Hospitalised Falcao 'rugby-tackled' says coach,Monaco coach Leonardo Jardim was left scandalised that a 'rugby tackle' that hospitalised striker Radamel Falcao with head and chest injuries went unpunished in their midweek 4-0 Ligue 1 defeat to Nice.,"Falcao took a heavy knock to the head when he was caught in a sandwich between goalkeeper Yoann Cardinale and defender Paul Baysse. Falcao had been chasing a bouncing ball which Cardinale punched clear from just inside his area. But with the 30-year-old Colombian who rose to fame at Atletico Madrid still under observation in Monte Carlo's Princesse-Grace hospital after scans to head and chest injuries, his Portuguese coach was fuming. ""In most places in Europe that's a red card,"" said Jardim. ""Referees should make sure that in these kind of situations there is proper punishment. It was like a rugby tackle."" Doctors including a neurologist will decide when he can return to action. Monaco next play Angers on Saturday before hosting Bayer Leverkusen in the Champions League on Tuesday."
188,14/09/2016,23:22,Monaco shock Spurs in front of record crowd,Monaco ruined Tottenham's record-breaking night-out at Wembley as the French side earned a 2-1 win in their Champions League Group E opener on Wednesday.,"Tottenham are back in the Champions League for the first time in five years and, with the capacity at their White Hart Lane stadium reduced due to redevelopment, they opted to play their European matches at Wembley this season. Off the pitch, the move was a resounding success as a record home attendance for an English club of 85,011 packed into Wembley, surpassing the previous high of 84,467 set by Manchester City for an FA Cup tie against Stoke at Maine Road in 1934. The iconic Wembley arch was lit up in Tottenham's blue and white, but that was the extent of the home comforts for Mauricio Pochettino's side as they paid the price for a sloppy first-half display. Goals from Bernardo Silva and Thomas Lemar put Monaco in command and although Toby Alderweireld got one back, Tottenham were unable to turn their second-half dominance into an equaliser. It is not the first time an English team has come unstuck after making Wembley their temporary home as rivals Arsenal also struggled there for two Champions League campaigns in 1998 and 1999. ""They had only two shots on target and scored twice. We feel very disappointed with the result,"" Pochettino said. ""We improved in the second half and had chances to win. We deserved more but you cannot concede like we did."" Monaco boss Leonardo Jardim added: ""We were determined to stop Tottenham in their transitions. ""They are strong there and doing a good job in that area was important."" It might have been different if Tottenham had taken an early chance when Harry Kane whipped over a teasing cross that Monaco defender Andrea Raggi made a hash of clearing. Son Heung-Min pounced on the loose ball and drove his shot under goalkeeper Danijel Subasic, only for Raggi to scramble to his feet and redeem himself with a goal-line clearance. Amid a raucous atmosphere, Jardim's Ligue 1 leaders stunned Wembley into silence in the 15th minute. Tottenham winger Erik Lamela was guilty of an errant pass that deflected towards Silva 30 yards from goal and, with Pochettino's defence caught flat-footed, the Portugal midfielder was allowed to advance unchecked before lashing a fine finish past Hugo Lloris from the edge of the penalty area. Tottenham have won only once at the redeveloped Wembley since it opened in 2007 and Monaco's goal must have brought back unpleasant memories for Pochettino's team, who lost the League Cup final against Chelsea on their last visit. It certainly appeared they were rattled when Monaco punished more careless defending to double their lead in the 31st minute. Djibril Sidibe was granted time and space to hoist a cross into the six-yard box and Jan Vertonghen's mistimed attempt to head clear deflected into the path of Monaco substitute Lemar, who crashed a powerful strike into the roof of the net from close range. Desperately in need of a response before half-time as their supporters began to vent their frustrations, Tottenham finally found some momentum and were rewarded in the 45th minute when Belgium defender Alderweireld powered his header past Subasic from Lamela's corner. Pochettino sent on Mousa Dembele for Son at half-time and the Premier League side almost had an instant equaliser as Dele Alli's dipping half-volley from 25 yards drew an agile tip-over from Subasic. Tottenham thought they had been given a penalty when Monaco midfielder Fabinho was booked for tangling with Alli before a corner, but the offence couldn't be punished with a spot-kick because the ball wasn't in play. Kane had been held in check for much of the evening and when the England star finally had a clear sight of goal from Vincent Janssen's pass, he wasted Tottenham's last chance with a hurried shot straight at Subasic."
189,13/09/2016,16:22,No Wembley excuses for Spurs says Pochettino,Mauricio Pochettino insists Tottenham won't be allowed to use their temporary move to Wembley as an excuse for failure in their Champions League opener against Monaco on Wednesday.,"Pochettino's side return to the Champions League for the first time in five years in unfamiliar surroundings after deciding to stage their European matches at Wembley rather than White Hart Lane. The prospect of bigger crowds at the English national stadium convinced Tottenham to make the short move across north London and the crowd is expected to set a new record for the largest attendance for a home Champions League game in Britain. Fans of Tottenham's bitter rivals Arsenal can testify to the struggles of a Wembley relocation after they won just two of their six fixtures in Europe when temporarily playing there in the late 1990s. Tottenham have won only once at the redeveloped Wembley since it opened in 2007 and Pochettino's demand for a high-intensity pressing style may prove more demanding for his players on the stadium's big pitch. But the Argentine coach has drilled his players on a pitch of the same size at their Enfield training ground and he expects them to thrive in their new surroundings. ""We need to go to Wembley and play, behave naturally and not try to find an excuse, that's never good,"" Pochettino said on Tuesday. ""We trust in us. We believe in the way we play and it's a good chance to play on a big pitch. ""You have more space to play, it's more difficult for the opponent to press you when there are more metres to run, but the same for both. ""We feel good at White Hart Lane because it's our home and we need to feel good at Wembley. With two pitches at the training ground we designed the same dimensions as Wembley."" Tottenham striker Harry Kane agrees with Pochettino and claims a strong English core that includes internationals Kyle Walker, Danny Rose, Eric Dier, Dele Alli and himself, can help them settle in the venue where they play for their country. ""If there are 85-90,000 Tottenham fans in there it's only going to make you play better,"" Kane said. ""A lot of us have played there already, so it feels like even more of a home. Everyone knows how iconic Wembley is, but that's what we've got to be careful of. ""Monaco are going to come here and it's a big occasion for them as well. We have to make sure we're ready for that."" Unlike his English colleagues, South Korea midfielder Son Heung-min got his first taste of the most famous stadium in England when Spurs trained there recently. ""For every player, it's a dream to play in the Champions League,"" Son said. ""For me also, it's two years since I played in the Champions League. I can't wait for this night. ""My first time I went training at Wembley, the stadium was unbelievable. I'm excited to play there, so many fans will be there and we have to win this game."" Tottenham head into the Monaco clash on a high after winning 4-0 at Stoke in the Premier League on Saturday. But Monaco will also be in confident mood after climbing to the top of Ligue 1 with a 4-1 win at Lille. Leonardo Jardim's team are unbeaten in four league matches, including an upset of French champions Paris Saint Germain, and survived two tough rounds of qualifying against Fenerbahce and Villarreal to reach the Champions League group stages. According to former France and Arsenal star Emmanuel Petit, Jardim's men should not be underestimated. ""Monaco will not be intimidated. They are in good form and they beat PSG just before the international break,"" he said. ""They are organised and are playing well. Spurs need to be careful of them."""

He had set up one goal and then scored a penalty at the Stade Louis II, having previously netted in the 2-1 defeat in the first leg in Turkey. His absence means he is set to miss the crucial clash with Spain's Villarreal in which a group stage berth is at stake. The first leg is scheduled to be played at El Madrigal on August 17 with the return in the principality six days later. The Colombian, back at the club after two seasons on loan in England with Manchester United and then Chelsea, could also miss Monaco's opening two Ligue 1 games at home to Guingamp next Friday and away to Monaco."

Nice have to win to stand a chance of overtaking their Cote d'Azur neighbours but coach Claude Puel hinted that his club would be better off going into the Europa League.

199,07/05/2016,23:14,Lacazette hat-trick as Lyon thrash Monaco to book Champions League spot,French international Alexandre Lacazette hit a hat-trick as Lyon sealed a place in next season's Champions League by thrashing 10-man Monaco 6-1 at Parc OL on Saturday.,"Second-placed Lyon went into the game ahead of Monaco in the Ligue 1 table on goal difference, and they pulled clear quickly with goals from Rachid Ghezzal and Lacazette inside the first eight minutes. Mapou Yanga-Mbiwa headed in a third after visiting striker Lacina Traore was sent off, and Lacazette dinked in before Ricardo Carvalho pulled one back before half-time. Centre-back Yanga-Mbiwa piled yet more misery onto Monaco just before the hour mark before Lacazette completed a hat-trick. Lyon are all but assured of a place in the Champions League group stages, and of being runners-up behind Paris Saint-Germain for the second straight season, thanks to their far superior goal difference to Monaco with just a game to go. The principality side though will be looking nervously over their shoulders as they look to hang onto the third and final spot in Europe's premier competition, after Nice beat the nine men of Saint-Etienne 2-0 to close the gap on the top three to just two points ahead of the final day of the season next Saturday. Since ending PSG's record unbeaten run in February, Lyon have not lost themselves, with Saturday's victory their eighth in 10 outings. Algerian winger Ghezzal has had an excellent campaign, and he grabbed his eighth league goal this term from a tight angle after less than three minutes. Sergi Darder teed up Lacazette to drill into the corner and continue a dream start for Bruno Genesio's hosts. Things went from bad to worse for Monaco midway through the first half, as Ivorian Traore picked up two yellow cards in just a couple of minutes. Lyon were ripping their opponents' defence to shreds in open play, but it was from a Ghezzal corner that Yanga-Mbiwa nodded his first goal for the club past the despairing dive of Danijel Subasic. Lacazette completed a brace with an audacious finish from Christophe Jallet's pass, scooping the ball past bewildered Serbian keeper Subasic. Home goalkeeper Anthony Lopes threw away his clean sheet before half-time when he punched a cross straight onto the head of Carvalho, but by then the game was already over as a contest. Yanga-Mbiwa had only scored five times in his whole career before this game, but he completed his first professional brace by stabbing home after another set-piece wreaked havoc in a Monaco defence that have conceded 16 goals in their last six matches. Lacazette bundled his way past Subasic and tapped in to grab his second treble of the season and round off a resounding result with 10 minutes to play. Saint-Etienne's Champions League hopes are now over after Kevin Malcuit and Franck Tabanou were both sent off at Nice. Claude Puel's men left it late, but finally made the most of their two-man advantage thanks to Valere Germain goals in the 86th and 89th minutes. Nice visit Guingamp next week, while Monaco host Montpellier. Elsewhere on Saturday, PSG set a new Ligue 1 points record of 92 by cruising past struggling Gazelec Ajaccio 4-0 in Corsica. Edinson Cavani scored a hat-trick before Zlatan Ibrahimovic's injury-time strike, as Gazelec slipped into the relegation zone. Toulouse clambered out of the bottom three at their expense after a tense 1-0 victory over already-relegated Troyes. Argentinian Oscar Trejo was the star for Pascal Dupraz's men, scoring the only goal in the second half just seconds after coming off the bench. Two of Gazelec, Toulouse and Reims will go down next week, after the latter were beaten 1-0 at Marseille. Michy Batshuayi gave OM their first home league win since September, leaving Reims a point behind their two rivals in the fight to avoid the drop. Lille were held to a 0-0 draw by Guingamp as they missed the chance to leapfrog Saint-Etienne into fifth."
200,06/05/2016,02:20,Lyon and Monaco meet in Champions League decider,Lyon can wrap up direct qualification for next season's Champions League group stage with a win when they entertain Monaco on the penultimate weekend of the Ligue 1 campaign on Saturday.,"Both sides are on course to finish in the top three in France but both are desperate to avoid ending the season in third spot, and thus having to come through two qualifying rounds to make the Champions League proper. Lyon were the runners-up to Paris Saint-Germain last season, while Monaco came in third and ended up missing out on the Champions League group stage by losing to Valencia in a play-off. The two teams come into the weekend level on points, but Lyon's superior goal difference is such that a win in front of a near-60,000 crowd at the Parc OL would rule out Monaco catching them on the final day. Lyon have the momentum on their side too, having closed the gap after being 10 points behind Monaco in late February. Bruno Genesio's side have won seven and drawn two of their last nine games, while Monaco have won just three times over the same period. That has given Lyon the chance to claim the prize of best of the rest in France behind the utterly dominant Qatar-owned PSG, as OL's outspoken president Jean-Michel Aulas has been eager to point out. ""It is good to have a final to the French championship because Qatar is not part of France,"" the ever-provocative Aulas said. ""There will therefore be a French title up for grabs. That is what we need to get in our heads and it will be marvellous for whoever wins. ""We know that if we play with the necessary mental strength to win the game, we will be in the Champions League,"" added Aulas, whose club are unbeaten at their impressive new stadium since its inauguration in January. ""We will see if our players, as well as being good footballers, are men with superior mental strength. We will also see if Bruno Genesio is capable of preparing the team for the Champions League because this is a Champions League game."" Lyon are set to be without Corentin Tolisso but Mathieu Valbuena has returned to training after missing last week's win against Gazelec Ajaccio. Monaco have problems of their own, though, with Brazilian right-back Fabinho suspended and midfield duo Jeremy Toulalan and Joao Moutinho both struggling for fitness. ""This match is a final, it will be decisive,"" admitted Monaco coach Leonardo Jardim, whose team will be supported in Lyon by Prince Albert. ""We want to finish second and qualify directly for the Champions League but they are a good team and are used to playing in big matches."" If either team slips up, Saint-Etienne or Nice could yet snatch a podium place. The sides meet on the Cote d'Azur with Les Verts four points back in fourth and Nice another point behind in fifth. Both sides are looking to at least seal Europa League qualification but they are under pressure from Lille, who sit sixth and are in good form having gone eight league games unbeaten. Frederic Antonetti's side entertain Guingamp in far northern France but do so without Sofiane Boufal, who is out for the remainder of the campaign with a knee problem. Champions PSG need just a draw away to relegation-threatened Gazelec Ajaccio to set a new record for the most points in a Ligue 1 campaign. Marco Verratti is a doubt due to a thigh injury as PSG come up against a Gazelec side who lie one point above the relegation zone. If the Corsicans claim a shock win, it could spell big trouble for the two teams below them, Reims and Toulouse. Reims go to Marseille, while Toulouse are at home to already demoted Troyes. Fixtures on Saturday (kick-offs 1900 GMT) Lille v Guingamp, Lyon v Monaco, Marseille v Reims, Montpellier v Rennes, Nice v Saint-Etienne, Bordeaux v Lorient, Nantes v Caen, Bastia v Angers, Toulouse v Troyes, Gazelec Ajaccio v Paris Saint-Germain"
201,29/04/2016,02:20,Quartet scrapping for Champions League berths in France,"While Paris Saint-Germain have long since had the Ligue 1 title wrapped up, the battle for Champions League qualification beneath them is only intensifying in the final weeks of the French season.","Just two points separate Lyon in second from Saint-Etienne in fifth with three matches remaining, including a crucial set of fixtures this Saturday. Lyon sit second ahead of Monaco on goal difference, with Nice and Saint-Etienne both two points back. Only second carries with it automatic qualification for next season's Champions League group stage, with the team in third facing entry in the third qualifying round in late July. Monaco are desperate to avoid that fate after losing to Valencia in the Champions League play-offs at the start of this season, but their form has dipped rather alarmingly of late. Leonardo Jardim's side have won only two of their last eight matches, allowing Lyon to catch them up thanks to six wins and two draws over the same period. The two teams meet each other in a huge game on the penultimate weekend of the season, but first Monaco entertain Guingamp at the Stade Louis II on Saturday just before Lyon entertain relegation-threatened Gazelec Ajaccio. ""It is a decisive match, a bit like a semi-final. There will be something to play for at Lyon only if we win against Guingamp,"" said Monaco coach Jardim, whose side drew 1-1 at Rennes last weekend. ""The fact OL are favourites now changes nothing. There are four of us fighting for second place and all the teams will give everything to get it. ""The draw against Rennes doesn't change much. We are still obliged to win our next three matches. If we do that we will finish second."" Lyon, whose leading scorer Alexandre Lacazette has this week been linked with a move to Barcelona, will look to defend their unbeaten record at their new Parc OL when they host Gazelec. ""It is a very important match and we are really concentrated on it. We are not thinking about the match against Monaco,"" said midfielder Corentin Tolisso. ""Everything depends on a victory on Saturday. We need to be in front of them before playing Monaco."" With Hatem Ben Arfa in the form of his life, Nice have lost just once -- to PSG -- in their last seven games and go to Nantes looking to keep alive their hopes of a first podium finish since 1976. Ben Arfa, who has scored 17 Ligue 1 goals this season, has been nominated for the player of the year award in France along with PSG duo Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Angel Di Maria and Marseille midfielder Lassana Diarra. Nice need points before hosting Saint-Etienne next weekend, before which Les Verts entertain Toulouse on Saturday. Christophe Galtier's side are bidding to secure a fourth consecutive top-five finish and are on a run of five successive wins, all without conceding a goal. PSG's win against Lille last weekend ensured fifth place would bring with it a Europa League berth, while sixth will also offer European qualification if PSG beat Marseille in the French Cup final next month. Lille, who visit Lorient on Saturday, are currently sixth, one point ahead of Rennes, who go to Paris on Friday. Champions PSG can equal their own record for the most points in a Ligue 1 season with a win against Rennes after a week in which several stars used their days off to take a mini break in Las Vegas. ""My players do what they want. They had three days off, I gave them to them, and I think that's a good thing,"" coach Laurent Blanc said in response to media criticism after Ibrahimovic and Javier Pastore were among those who visited Vegas."
202,24/04/2016,23:35,"Monaco held at Rennes, crisis-hit Marseille falter again","Giovanni Sio struck a controversial equaliser for Rennes in a 1-1 draw to dent Monaco's Champions League hopes, while struggling French giants Marseille saw their record winless home run extended to 15 matches in Ligue 1 on Sunday.","Monaco are wrestling with Lyon, Nice and Saint-Etienne for a pair of Champions League berths, and grabbed a 14th-minute lead at Roazhon Park when Helder Costa steered home after Nabil Dirar's clever flick from a long throw. But Ivory Coast international Sio snatched a contentious equaliser 10 minutes from time, controlling the ball with his hand before beating Monaco goalkeeper Danijel Subasic from close range as the visitors' protests fell on deaf ears. Fabinho nearly scored a dramatic injury-time winner for Monaco, but the Brazilian's effort was cleared off the line by Fallou Diagne as Rennes ended their two-game losing run. ""I think Monaco played better and created three or four good situations,"" said the principality club's coach Leonardo Jardim. ""We missed these chances and then Rennes scored a beautiful goal with a piece of control of great quality,"" he added bitterly of the equaliser. ""When you work, you always do so to win, and when you don't win you are disappointed, but it is still in our hands if we are to reach our objective."" Monaco trail second-place Lyon, 3-2 winners at Toulouse on Saturday, on goal difference in the race for France's second automatic Champions League qualifying spot, with Nice and Saint-Etienne both two points adrift. Earlier, crisis-hit Marseille were again left to rue costly mistakes as the 10-man hosts were held to a 1-1 draw by Nantes. Sunday's game at the Velodrome was played in front of fewer than 20,000 fans as Marseille served a partial stadium ban following crowd trouble during their 0-0 draw against Bordeaux a fortnight ago. Michy Batshuayi went close to scoring the opening goal on 29 minutes when his low strike was tipped onto the post by Nantes goalkeeper Maxime Dupe, but it was a familiar tale as Nicolas Nkoulou gifted Nantes the lead two minutes later. A breakdown in communication between Nkoulou and goalkeeper Steve Mandanda resulted in the former diverting a cross into his own net when there appeared to be little danger. However Florian Thauvin, whose goal in a 1-0 win against Sochaux in midweek sent Marseille through to next month's French Cup final against Paris Saint-Germain, grabbed an equaliser just after the break. But Marseille's hopes of snapping a 10-match winless streak in the top flight suffered a damaging blow when Alaixys Romao was sent off on 55 minutes for kicking out at Yacine Bammou. And there was worse to come for OM as Abou Diaby, starting his second straight game after 18 months out through injury, hobbled off midway through the second half. ""There was a lack of rhythm in the first half and we started the game poorly. Then there was the goal which was a bit unlucky and that knocked down my players' confidence to a level even lower than it was at the start of the game against Sochaux,"" said OM interim coach Franck Passi. ""Since the start of the season quite a few things have gone against us, but the players never give up. Faced with adversity, to get back level and earn a point is important,"" he added, with OM five points above the relegation zone with three games left to play. Saint-Etienne remain firmly in the hunt for the third and final Champions League place as Nolan Roux struck two second-half goals in a 2-0 victory over Lorient, stretching their winning run to five matches. Montpellier all but banished their relegation fears after thrashing bottom side Troyes 4-1, while Gazelec Ajaccio climbed out of the bottom three, at the expense of Reims, following a 3-2 victory against Bastia in the Corsica derby."
203,22/04/2016,02:35,Race for Europe enters home straight in France,The battle for European places in France's Ligue 1 is set to come down to the wire with just four matches of the season remaining and several teams still in the running.,"Monaco reclaimed second place from Lyon last weekend after a 2-1 win over Marseille, while Bruno Genesio's men slipped to third after being held 1-1 by fellow Champions League hopefuls Nice. Four straight wins have fired Saint-Etienne back into contention along with Lille, who were at one stage in a relegation scrap before reeling off six victories in succession. Rennes' charge has been slowed by back-to-back defeats but the Bretons still harbour realistic hopes of qualifying for the Europa League, although their challenge could peter out should they lose to Monaco on Sunday. ""There's a scent of Europe. I'm sure that everything is still possible. We're a bit behind our direct rivals (...) but a victory against Monaco would put us back in the mix,"" said Rennes goalkeeper Benoit Costil. Monaco, meanwhile, still must go to Lyon on the penultimate weekend of the season which could determine the destination of France's second automatic Champions League qualifying spot behind runaway title-winners Paris Saint-Germain. Last weekend's draw at Parc OL, in which Lyon played for over an hour with 10 men, snapped a five-game winning run at home for OL, who will aim to respond on Saturday at relegation-threatened Toulouse. The visitors will be without the suspended Maxwel Cornet, while time is running out for Toulouse with three points separating them from safety despite a mini-revival under Pascal Dupraz. Nice coach Claude Puel felt it was a case of two points lost at Lyon and said beating struggling Reims on Friday was imperative if they are to remain on course for Europe's premier club competition. ""The peak of our season is on Friday. If we're not good against Reims, it's not even worth talking about the other matches, whether it's those of our opponents or our own,"" said Puel, whose side also face fifth-place Saint-Etienne in week 37. Saint-Etienne, who are level on points with Nice, have based their recent success on an impenetrable defence and host Lorient on Sunday, while Lille won't face Angers until next Wednesday with Frederic Antonetti's side taking on PSG in the League Cup final at the Stade de France this weekend. Crisis-hit Marseille enjoyed a rare highlight in a disastrous season as they set up a showdown with bitter rivals PSG in next month's French Cup final following Wednesday's 1-0 victory at second-tier Sochaux. However, they remain just six points clear of the bottom three and will hope interim coach Franck Passi, who has stepped in after the dismissal of Michel, can finally bring about an end to their 14-game winless run at the Stade Velodrome against Nantes. Gazelec Ajaccio host Bastia in a Corsican derby given added importance in light of the top-flight newcomers' battle to avoid an immediate return to Ligue 2. Gazelec have won just once since the turn of the year and find themselves trailing 17th-place Reims by two points, with games against Lyon and PSG still to come. Fixtures (kick-off times GMT)"
204,17/04/2016,23:14,"Monaco regain second, deepen crisis at Marseille",Monaco regained the initiative in their battle with Lyon for an automatic pass to the Champions League next season with a 2-1 defeat of crisis-club Marseille in Ligue 1 on Sunday.,"Goals in the second half from Bernardo Silva and Andrea Raggi moved Monaco back into the all important second spot on 58 points, two clear of Lyon, with four games remaining. Marseille, who got a consolation stoppage time goal from Michy Batshuayi, were left languishing fifth from bottom, six points off the drop zone, at the end of a week when owner Margarita Louis-Dreyfus put the ailing French giants up for sale. Monaco, dominating the encounter at their Louis II home, took a deserved lead two minutes after the restart when Silva went on a 40 metre charge towards the box, the Portuguese international shrugging off Marseille's Lucas Silva to fire low past the helpless Steve Mandanda. Silva had been thwarted by quick work from the Marseille keeeper towards the end of the first half. That was after Monaco's Lacina Traore had the ball in the back of the net only for the referee to disallow his effort for offside. Traore and Helder Costa were starting in place of Vagner Love and Thomas Lemas as manager Leonardo Jardim reshuffled his pack after last weekend's 4-1 loss at Lille. On 75 minutes Raggi wrapped up the win. The shaven-headed Italian defender controlled the ball well off a corner sent over by Silva and helped on its way by the head of Nabil Dirar to shoot right-footed from the edge of the box. On Friday Alexandre Lacazette grabbed a late equaliser as 10-man Lyon salvaged a 1-1 draw against fourth-placed Nice. Twenty four hours later Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Paris Saint Germain ripped Caen to pieces in a 6-0 thrashing at the Parc des Princes. The champions are 28 points clear. The result came quick on the heels of PSG's disappointing 3-2 aggregate Champions League quarter-final defeat to Manchester City. Ibrahimovic scored twice, taking his tally to 32 league goals this season to equal his previous best, while Argentine playmaker Angel di Maria, so ineffective against City, netted with a sumptuous lob. Other goals came from the returning Blaise Matuidi, banned for the City game, a typically marauding Edinson Cavani run and shot made it five and defender Maxwell turned home a Cavani cross for 6-0. Coach Laurent Blanc conceded that the rout ""doesn't cancel out"" the massive disappointment felt by PSG of their Champions League exit. ""This win doesn't cancel out anything, it doesn't allow us to progress to the Champions League semi-finals,"" he said. They must now turn their attentions to the French Cup semi-final with Lorient on Tuesday and the League Cup final against resurgent Lille next Saturday at the Stade de France."
205,10/04/2016,23:42,Heavy defeat hits Monaco Champions League hopes,"Monaco's grip on a Champions League qualifying berth in Ligue 1 loosened further on Sunday as the principality side were swept aside 4-1 at Lille, before Hatem Ben Arfa's hat-trick saw Nice past Rennes 3-0.","Champions Paris Saint Germain have a massive 83 points from 33 games, while Lyon and Monaco have 55 with Nice poised on 53 to add some late season drama with two further Champions League berths very much up for grabs. Morgan Amalfitano had resurgent Lille in front at the break before a dramatic second half saw both sides reduced to 10 men, Renato Civelli's red card for the hosts being followed by Elderson Echiejile's dismissal for Monaco. Eder, Mounir Obbadi and Djibril Sidibe added further goals for Lille before Fares Bahlouli netted a consolation for a well beaten Monaco side. Even third spot is far from secure for Monaco with not only Nice but Rennes and Saint-Etienne on 51 points, and even Lille in sixth on 49 points still in contention. As Monaco slide Nice are now on form and their star striker Ben Arfa in inspirational mood in their comfortable victory over fellow European hopefuls Rennes. But Monaco coach Leonardo Jardim insists his side are not looking at the teams queueing up behind them, but at catching Lyon in second. ""This is a bad day. There was physical and mental fatigue,"" Jardim said. ""We have lost our advantage, but there are still 15 points to play for so it's still possible to finish second. We will work hard to achieve that goal."" Lille have been transformed from relegation contenders into European hopefuls under Frederic Antonetti and they are seventh after claiming a fifth consecutive win. Amalfitano had hit the post before he controlled an Eder knockdown and fired into the roof of the net on 37 minutes at the Stade Pierre-Mauroy. Lille had Civelli sent off shortly after the restart after the Argentine shoved Ricardo Carvalho to the floor off the ball, but Echiejile followed on 63 minutes for a reckless challenge on Sebastien Corchia. The hosts doubled their lead soon after that, with Portugal forward Eder stroking a shot low into the bottom-left corner to mark an impressive display with a goal. Sofiane Boufal then set up Obbadi for the third goal and Junior Tallo picked out Sidibe to make it four with a finish through the legs of Monaco goalkeeper Danijel Subasic. Substitute Bahlouli netted at the death for Jardim's side, who are now in real danger of missing out on the Champions League. Nice bounced back from defeat at PSG last weekend by cruising to their fourth win in five matches. Ben Arfa opened the scoring from the penalty spot in the 33rd minute with his 14th league goal of the season, before coolly finishing from Vincent Koziello's excellent through ball shortly before half-time. The 29-year-old completed the first hat-trick of his career in the second half with the best goal of the bunch, carrying the ball from inside his own half before drilling an unstoppable shot into the far corner. There was crowd trouble as struggling giants Marseille drew 0-0 at home to Bordeaux as the pressure eased slightly on under pressure home coach Michel. Instead fans angry the side has failed to win at home since September targetted the club's owner Margarita Louis-Dreyfus, who inherited Marseille from her late husband with banners in the stands reading ""Go back to your real job, housewife"" and ""Rich, incompetent heiress"". The former European champions should now avoid relegation however being six points above relegation with four games to go. But fans got so out of hand police fired tear-gas into a tribune in time added on at Sunday's late game, sending many players back to the dressing room with watering eyes. Lyon won 2-0 at Montpellier on Friday thanks to a Maxwell Cornet brace while Saint-Etienne were 1-0 winners against already-relegated Troyes. Paris Saint-Germain warmed up for their Champions League showdown with Manchester City by winning 2-0 at Guingamp on Saturday with a shadow line-up and Lucas Moura scoring both goals."
206,01/04/2016,22:52,Bordeaux slow Monaco Champions League charge,Monaco's march towards Champions League qualification in Ligue 1 was slowed on Friday as they slumped to a 2-1 defeat at home to struggling Bordeaux at the Stade Louis II.,"Goals in each half from Thomas Toure and Adam Ounas were enough for the away side before a Frederic Guilbert own goal gave Monaco a late consolation in the principality. Monaco had looked certainties to finish second and secure automatic qualification for next season's Champions League thanks to an eight-game unbeaten run that included a 2-0 win away to champions Paris Saint-Germain in their last outing. However, this first home league defeat since September means third-placed Nice can close to within two points if they can win at PSG on Saturday, while fourth-placed Lyon will also hope to put the pressure on when they visit Lorient on Sunday. Bordeaux took the lead in stoppage time at the end of the first half when Fabinho inadvertently helped on a corner at the near post and the unmarked Toure lashed the ball into the roof of the net at the back post. An almost identical goal allowed Bordeaux to double their lead before the hour mark as a corner came all the way to the back post where Ounas was this time unmarked and stabbed past goalkeeper Danijel Subasic. Monaco had a chance to get one back in stoppage time when they were awarded a penalty for a Cedric Yambere foul on Guido Carrillo. Vagner Love stepped up to take it but saw his effort saved, and although he converted the follow-up, the goal was disallowed, apparently for encroachment into the area by one of his team-mates. The hosts did get one back, though, with Jerome Prior saving a Carrillo header only for the ball to rebound in off Guilbert. Nevertheless, Bordeaux were not to be denied a first win in six games and a third victory against Monaco this season that allows Ulrich Rame's team to move nine points clear of the relegation zone."
207,20/03/2016,23:50,PSG title party gate-crashed by excellent Monaco,Monaco ruined Paris Saint-Germain's Ligue 1 title celebrations as a clinical second-half performance gave the principality side a 2-0 victory at the Parc des Princes on Sunday.,"PSG wrapped up a fourth consecutive league title in record time with eight matches to spare by thrashing Troyes 9-0 a week ago, but they were uncharacteristically flat in the capital. After a drab opening 45 minutes it was the visitors who turned on the style, as Vagner Love's fourth goal for the club gave them a deserved 65th-minute lead. A David Luiz error gave Monaco a penalty that was coolly converted by Fabinho just three minutes later, as PSG slumped to just a second league defeat of the season, and a first at home since May 2014. The victory is a timely one for Leonardo Jardim's Monaco in the race for the top three and the Champions League, as they stay second in the table and now have the cushion of a six-point gap back to fourth-placed Lyon. ""This is a very important victory, but in getting this the team has actually only maintained our gap to our competitors,"" Jardim said. ""Paris is a big team, one of the top four in Europe, and they could win the Champions League. My players played a great game. In football, you have not won or lost before the match, everything is played on the pitch."" PSG manager Laurent Blanc selected an attacking line-up, with Zlatan Ibrahimovic, Edinson Cavani, Lucas Moura and Angel Di Maria all starting on a night when the home fans expected to party. But they started slowly, and the hosts' frustration at their lacklustre opening half an hour was clear, as Cavani thumped the turf in anger after ballooning an acrobatic effort well wide. PSG improved in the minutes before half-time, with Cavani heading a Marquinhos cross wastefully off target when totally unmarked. The visitors grew in confidence in the second period and home keeper Kevin Trapp had to beat clear Fabinho's drive after a mistake by Luiz, before the German also had to save well at his near post from Thomas Lemar. PSG were pleasing the crowd with plenty of neat tricks and flicks, but rarely looked like breaking their opponents down. While Blanc's men appeared to be resting on their record-breaking efforts from last week, there was a hunger and desire about Champions League-chasing Monaco that brought the opening goal. Some quick passing released Lemar, who crossed low to the back post to give Love a simple tap-in with Trapp out of the picture. Less than two minutes later and the principality side were gifted the chance to double their lead from the penalty spot. Another horror-show in the PSG defence culminated in Luiz pulling back Fabinho, and the Brazilian full-back picked himself up to calmly chip his spot-kick down the middle. Unsurprisingly PSG pushed forward in numbers and, after Subasic had brilliantly clawed away a Cavani header, Ibrahimovic somehow contrived to head the ball over the top from two yards out with the goal at his mercy. It was not Ibrahimovic's day, the league's top scorer was left red-faced again after volleying over an unguarded net from point-blank range. Monaco held on in the face of heavy pressure to record a first win against PSG in over six years. Blanc said that his side's missed chances were the key, and played down suggestions that his men had eased off after winning the title. ""In the first half we created many chances, we controlled the game against a very defensive team,"" he said. ""I do not feel as though there was a party tonight, we will celebrate the title when we receive the trophy on the final day."" Hatem Ben Arfa's latest breathtaking strike set Nice up for a 3-0 win over struggling Gazelec Ajaccio that keeps them in contention for a surprise top-three finish. Ben Arfa collected possession wide on the right and skipped away from two challenges as he cut into the box before curling a shot beyond goalkeeper Clement Maury to set Nice on their way in the 14th minute at the Allianz Riviera. He then turned provider for Alassane Plea to make it 2-0 and Ivorian midfielder Jean-Michael Seri wrapped up the victory late on. Bordeaux were held to a 1-1 draw at home by Bastia in their first match since Willy Sagnol was sacked and replaced in the dugout by club legend Ulrich Rame."
208,18/03/2016,02:20,PSG ready to toast title triumph as Monaco visit,Paris Saint-Germain will get the chance to celebrate winning the French title in record time when they play host to second-placed Monaco at the Parc des Princes on Sunday.,"PSG became the earliest champions in French football history when they wrapped up a fourth consecutive title with eight games to spare last weekend, inflicting a pitiless 9-0 defeat on bottom side Troyes in Champagne country. That left Laurent Blanc's side a scarcely credible 25 points clear of their nearest 'challengers' Monaco at the summit and removed much of the edge from their meeting with the principality club in the capital. However, PSG will be eager to prove the gulf in class that separates them from the rest of the country as they defend an unbeaten home record in the league going back to May 2014 and close in on beating their own record for the most points in a Ligue 1 campaign. The game is a vital one for Monaco, however, with Leonardo Jardim's side just five points ahead of Cote d'Azur rivals Nice in the fight for second and automatic Champions League qualification. Monaco have lost just one of their last 17 league games but have drawn their last three, allowing PSG to clinch the title and the teams below them to retain hope in the process. Nevertheless, Monaco will hope PSG -- who are expected to be without Marco Verratti until mid-April because of a hernia -- take their eye off the ball now that the championship is secure. ""It can make a lot of difference - for PSG. The players might relax a bit or could play even better. I think we'll see a slight change,"" Nigerian defender Elderson Echiejile told Monaco's website. Nice are at home to relegation-threatened Gazelec Ajaccio on Sunday and by then they may have lost third place to Lyon, who entertain Nantes on Saturday. A run of one defeat in seven games has revitalised Lyon, although they were held to a 2-2 draw at Rennes last time out. Rennes, in fifth, are also right in contention for Champions League qualification and travel to Marseille on Friday hoping to extend their hosts' miserable record of not having won in 12 league games at the Stade Velodrome. OM, who have drawn their last five games and continue to languish in mid-table, could be about to see Abou Diaby finally make his debut, eight months after returning to French football. ""Right now all the lights are on green and I am ready to play. I have never been so close to a return. I feel good,"" said the injury-jinxed former Arsenal midfielder, who has not played since late 2014, this week. Diaby, who said he hopes to stay beyond the summer when his contract expires, added: ""My wish is to be in the squad and that we can get a victory. I want to experience the fervour of the Marseille support."" Meanwhile, troubled Bordeaux play their first game under new interim coach Ulrich Rame when they entertain Bastia on Sunday. Willy Sagnol was sacked by Les Girondins on Monday in the wake of a 4-0 defeat at Toulouse which left them five points clear of the relegation zone. ""I have spent nearly 20 years here. The club has given me a lot so I would like to give some of that back,"" said Rame, who won two league titles during a long and successful spell as a goalkeeper for Bordeaux."
209,11/03/2016,23:45,PSG poised to lift crown as Monaco held by Reims,Paris Saint-Germain's path to claiming the Ligue 1 title in record time this weekend was cleared on Friday as nearest challengers Monaco were held 2-2 at home by Reims.,"A win at lowly Troyes on Sunday would give Laurent Blanc's side 77 points -- 25 more than Monaco who are currently second with 52 points after 30 games -- and a fourth successive crown to round out an excellent week after reaching the Champions League quarter-finals. Until now the fastest a team has won the French league title was after 33 games when Gerard Houllier led Lyon to the crown in 2007. Monaco are targetting the second direct Champions League spot with Leonardo Jardim's side having no room for error with Lyon, the only team to beat the Parisians this season, third, seven points behind the Principality side. Monaco had gotten off to a bright start with winter signing Vagner Love getting a first half double. The Brazilian opened after just five minutes at Stade Louis II only for Gaetan Charbonnier to get the equaliser six minutes later following a superb cross from Nicolas De Preville. Vagner got his second on 37 minutes following an error by Charbonnier only for fellow Brazilian Diego to pull Reims level after 79 minutes, for a precious point as they sit three points above the drop zone. ""Our situation isn't good,"" said Jardim. ""I'm not happy. At 2-1 we had the chance to score a third and we missed. When you miss the third goal you give a lot of confidence to your rivals."" He added: ""But there are eight games left, 24 points to collect. The third (placed team) will play against the fourth (Rennes-Lyon), both won't win."" Lyon, coming off last weekend's 5-1 win against Guingamp, travel to another Brittany side Rennes on Sunday, with the hosts also in impressive form having beaten Nantes 4-1 last Sunday. Rennes are just a point behind Lyon along with Nice who travel on Saturday to Montpellier."
210,04/03/2016,23:41,Monaco stumble on road again,Monaco suffered a fifth Ligue 1 away match without a win on Friday when a last-minute goal from Christian Kouakou allowed Caen to snatch a 2-2 draw.,"Monaco remain in second spot, a huge 22 points behind defending champions Paris Saint-Germain while Caen are third, eight points further back. All four goals came in the second half with Thomas Lemar putting Monaco ahead on the 56th minute mark with a sweetly-struck direct free-kick. Julien Feret levelled after 64 minutes with a penalty awarded when Brazilian defender Wallace was punished for a hand ball. Four minutes later, Monaco were back in front when Alaeddine Yahia put through his own goal as he struggled to clear a cross from Bernardo Silva. Ivory Coast's Kouakou then ensured a share of the spoils with an acrobatic strike from a last-minute corner."
211,04/03/2016,02:20,PSG focus on Chelsea ahead of Montpellier visit,Paris Saint-Germain head into Saturday's clash at home to a resurgent Montpellier with most eyes firmly fixated on next week's return leg at Chelsea in the last 16 of the Champions League.,"PSG rebounded from losing their 46-game unbeaten domestic run at Lyon last weekend by remaining on course to defend their French Cup crown after beating Saint-Etienne 3-1 in midweek. However, victory at the Stade Geoffroy-Guichard potentially came at a cost with midfielder Blaise Matuidi facing a race against time to be fit for Wednesday's trip to Stamford Bridge. The France international was seen clutching his hamstring after he was taken off ""as a precaution"" midway through the second half, with Laurent Blanc admitting he was ""worried"" about Matuidi's fitness. Blanc will have to decide whether or not to rest key players ahead of the Chelsea clash, with Marco Verratti (groin) and Angel Di Maria (thigh) also struggling with injuries. The PSG boss though was pleased with the manner in which the runaway Ligue 1 leaders responded at Saint-Etienne after suffering their first defeat of the season. ""We can't erase (the loss), but we can use it to our advantage. That's what we did (on Wednesday) and I'm very happy about it. It was a good way to respond after the defeat which provoked quite a buzz,"" said Blanc, in quotes published by French daily L'Equipe. ""Montpellier will be a difficult match because we'll be thinking about the game against Chelsea which will be huge,"" said PSG captain Thiago Silva, with 2012 French champions Montpellier arriving in the capital on the back of three straight wins to pull clear of relegation trouble. ""We're ready for Chelsea. I think everyone knows what awaits us over there. I hope (Matuidi) will be able to play because he's an important player for the team,"" the Brazilian added. Defeat at Lyon means Paris can't clinch a fourth straight French title this weekend, but they could do so next week should Monaco slip up at fellow European hopefuls Caen on Friday. Monaco have lost just once in 15 league outings and have an eight-point cushion over Caen, who trail third-place Lyon on goal difference, in the race for the second automatic Champions League qualifying berth. Four wins in five has reignited Lyon's campaign and Bruno Genesio's side will bid to build on recent momentum when Guingamp visit Parc OL in Sunday's late game. A four-match winless run has slowed Nice's European charge, but they will fancy their chances of ending that series at home to bottom side Troyes on Saturday. Rennes and Nantes, unbeaten in the league since November, meet in the Brittany derby with both sides also firmly in the hunt for Europe, while Saint-Etienne travel to slumping Angers. Pascal Dupraz will embark on the daunting task of trying to salvage Toulouse's top-flight status having replaced Dominique Arribage ahead of Sunday's trip to Marseille. Toulouse are 10 points from safety and without a win in eight, but there is hope as Marseille have struggled mightily at the Stade Velodrome with just two wins all season and none in their last 11 home fixtures.

212,01/03/2016,02:20,PSG looking to bounce back from Lyon loss in Cup,"Paris Saint-Germain will be desperate to get back on track after their shock 2-1 defeat at Lyon, when they face a trip to Saint Etienne for a French Cup quarter-final on Wednesday.","The capital city side suffered a first domestic defeat since March 2015 on Sunday, and know that it will not be easy away to Les Verts, who are well in the hunt for a Champions League place. PSG coach Laurent Blanc said that his men were ""too average"" in their loss at Parc OL, but it will be interesting to see if St Etienne try and mirror Lyon's tactics and play a high press against the cup holders. The Frenchman called on his team to rediscover the spirit that helped them go 36 league matches unbeaten. ""When I see the last ten minutes of the game, when we tried to come back and stay unbeaten, I can say that we were too average to do anything, even if it is Paris, even if it is my team,"" he said. ""The mentality and the aggression that enabled us to stay unbeaten for so long had gone, but it is possible that we can very quickly rediscover that spirit."" Blanc also has injury problems to worry about with the fixtures coming thick and fast. Marco Verratti is once again on the sidelines, while Angel Di Maria missed the Lyon loss after limping off against Reims the week before. With the second leg of the Champions League, last 16 tie against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge to come on March 9, it is unlikely that Blanc will risk either Verratti or Di Maria for the match at the Stade Geoffroy-Guichard. PSG have won the Coupe de France on nine occasions, second only to arch rivals Marseille who have ten, while the last of St Etienne's six cup successes came back in 1977. Marseille will be hoping to extend their record haul this season, as they face a last eight encounter with fifth-tier Granville on Thursday night. It is a dream tie for the Lower Normandy club, who continue the rich tradition of lower league success in the competition, they are the fifth team from the fifth division to reach the quarter-finals since 1999. The amateur side's Stade Louis Dior is not big enough to host such a match, though, and the game will be played at Ligue 1 club Caen's Stade Michel d'Ornano. This decision has drawn heavy criticism from Monaco, who play at Caen in the league on Friday. The principality outfit, who sit second in the top-flight, are worried about the state of the pitch when they play there. ""AS Monaco wish to express their displeasure following the scheduling of the quarter-final of the Coupe de France between Granville and Marseille,"" the club said in a statement. ""We cannot understand it, as the pitch at Stade d'Ornano already appeared in poor condition in the last game against Rennes."" Nantes, whose 0-0 draw with Monaco on Sunday means they have gone 16 outings without defeat, go to second-tier Sochaux on Wednesday. Sochaux have already claimed the top-flight scalps of Bastia and Monaco in previous rounds. The other quarter-final is an all-Ligue 1 clash between Lorient and Gazelec Ajaccio, with Gazelec having had a few extra days rest after their weekend league match with Marseille was postponed due to a waterlogged pitch.

213,28/02/2016,16:15,Nantes hold Monaco to extend unbeaten run,Nantes remain in contention for a surprise podium finish in Ligue 1 after holding second-placed Monaco to a 0-0 draw at the Stade de la Beaujoire on Sunday.,"In the process the Canaries, who had the best chances in the first half of a match played in bright sunshine, extended their long unbeaten run to 13 league games and 16 matches in all competitions. That has lifted Michel Der Zakarian's team provisionally up to sixth place, just one point behind Nice in third, and raised hopes among their fans of an unlikely Champions League qualification. Nantes are one of France's greatest clubs, but they have fallen on harder times since winning the last of their eight league titles in 2001. They have not finished in the top six in Ligue 1 since 2004 and have endured the ignominy of two relegations in the last decade, but they came into this fixture undefeated since a 1-0 reverse in Monaco in November. The home side had the best chances in a lively start to the game, but Kolbeinn Sigthorsson, on two occasions, and Emiliano Sala were unable to find a way past Danijel Subasic in the visitors' goal. Guido Carrillo came close for Monaco early in the second half while Alejandro Bedoya did have the ball in the net for Nantes in the 71st minute, only to be denied by the offside flag. While Monaco are nine points clear of the chasing pack in second spot, their failure to win the game means runaway leaders Paris Saint-Germain could secure an inevitable fourth consecutive title as early as next Saturday. For that to happen, Laurent Blanc's side must win away at Lyon later on Sunday and then hope Monaco slip up at Caen next Friday. PSG, who are unbeaten domestically since March last year, would then go into their home clash with Montpellier next Saturday knowing victory would suffice for them to be confirmed champions with two months of the season remaining. Elsewhere on Sunday, Marseille's match away to Gazelec Ajaccio was postponed due to the inclement weather in Corsica, but Saint-Etienne have the chance to go third when they entertain Caen. Nice's Champions League hopes were hit when they lost 2-0 at home to bitter rivals Bastia on Friday, while Rennes climbed up to fourth by coming from behind to win 2-1 at struggling Toulouse thanks to two late goals on Saturday. Toulouse parted company with coach Dominique Arribage after that defeat, which left them second from bottom and 10 points from safety."
214,26/02/2016,01:45,Lyon-PSG clash highlights gulf in France,Paris Saint-Germain can provide further proof of the growing gulf in class between the champions elect and the rest of Ligue 1 when they travel to last year's runners-up Lyon on Sunday.,"A fourth straight French league crown is well within sight for PSG, who could conceivably wrap up the championship next weekend, while Lyon's turbulent campaign has rendered last year's title challenge a distant memory. Laurent Blanc's runaway leaders are unbeaten in 36 matches in Ligue 1 dating back to last March, whereas Lyon have suffered 10 defeats -- three more than all of last season -- and find themselves embroiled in a congested scrap for Europe. PSG have beaten Lyon three times already this term, a crushing 5-1 win at the Parc des Princes in December was followed up by further triumphs in both domestic cup competitions, but OL will hope to maintain an unbeaten record in their new 60,000-seater fortress. Since moving into the Parc OL in January, Bruno Genesio's side have registered three wins out of four at home, with their lone dropped points coming in a 1-1 draw with Marseille. However, last Sunday's 1-0 defeat at Lille not only snapped a run of three successive victories but also left Lyon without midfielder Clement Grenier and former PSG defender Christophe Jallet for this weekend's clash after the pair were sent off to compound a miserable evening up north. ""We had the chance to go third and not only did we fail to do that, we also lost two players who will be suspended against Paris so we're paying a heavy price,"" said Genesio, whose side trail PSG by a staggering 34 points. ""That handicaps us even more against Paris, when that was the last thing we needed."" Monaco can take another stride towards claiming the second automatic Champions League berth when they travel to Nantes. Leonardo Jardim's side are eight points clear of Nice and Saint-Etienne, but will face an in-form Nantes outfit unbeaten in 15 matches in all competitions. ""We're very happy. There are still 11 games to go, and we have to hold on to second place,"" Monaco vice-president Vadim Vasilyev told RMC radio. ""The most important thing is always the league table. The goal is to be in the Champions League next season, it's vital."" Bastia fans will be banned from Friday's trip to third-place Nice after recent violence, which prompted last weekend's game at home to Nantes to be postponed. Fourth-place Saint-Etienne are at home to Caen on Sunday, while Marseille, with just two wins in 11 league outings, visit a Gazelec Ajaccio side chasing a first win in nine.

215,19/02/2016,02:20,Reims out to inflict European hangover on PSG,"Unbeaten runaway leaders Paris Saint-Germain return to Ligue 1 duty against struggling Reims on Saturday, four days after earning a narrow first-leg advantage over Chelsea in the Champions League last 16.","Edinson Cavani made an immediate impact as a substitute on Tuesday by netting a 78th-minute winner at the Parc des Princes after John Obi Mikel had cancelled out Zlatan Ibrahimovic's deflected free-kick to hand Laurent Blanc's side a 2-1 edge. The Uruguayan has started just twice in the league in 2016 after losing his place as a regular starter, but Cavani could well return to the line-up with Blanc preparing to rotate his side this weekend. Reims are one of the few teams to frustrate PSG this season, with the capital club needing another late goal from Cavani to rescue a point in a 1-1 draw back in September. ""Even if it's PSG, a big European team, we're not going there as victims. We always want to show what we're capable of doing against the big teams,"" said Reims defender Abdelhamid El Kaoutari. ""I think (the outcome) will depend on what Paris have to offer. If it's the PSG from Tuesday (against Chelsea), there are few teams who can stand up to them,"" added Reims coach Olivier Guegan, whose side enter the weekend two points above the drop zone. Paris on the other hand are unbeaten in 35 league games and cruising towards a fourth straight French title, with a mammoth 24-point gap separating themselves and nearest challengers Monaco, who are at home to bottom side Troyes this weekend. Lyon were in crisis mode less than a month ago, but three convincing wins in a row have propelled Bruno Genesio's side right back into contention for a top-three finish. OL travel to Lille on Sunday with the visitors trailing third-place Nice and bitter rivals Saint-Etienne by just a point in the race for France's final Champions League berth. ""It's the start of a run we have to continue with a couple of difficult matches coming up. We have to keep on working with the same spirit,"" said Genesio in the wake of last weekend's 4-1 demolition of Caen. Lyon will be without influential midfielder Corentin Tolisso for several weeks after he hurt his hamstring in training, but there was a welcome sight as Nabil Fekir, out since September with a knee injury, stepped up his road to recovery in midweek. Saint-Etienne secured a 3-2 victory at home to Basel in the last 32 of the Europa League on Thursday having thrown away a two-goal lead, with Christophe Galtier's men facing a quick turnaround as they head to Marseille this weekend. Early-season surprise packages Angers and Caen will bid to turn around their fading fortunes at home to Montpellier and Rennes respectively, with both sides losers of their last three matches. Toulouse, currently eight points from safety, can ill-afford another defeat as they risk being cut further adrift when they take on 18th-placed Gazelec Ajaccio.

Lyon, Nice and Nantes are all a further point back and Nice can move back into third with a win at home to Marseille later on Sunday. Saint-Etienne had needed extra-time to beat struggling Troyes and make the French Cup quarter-finals in midweek, but were in buoyant mood after winning their last two league games. Christophe Galtier's men are strong at home and Monaco 'keeper Danijel Subasic made several key saves as the principality side weathered first-half pressure. But the Croatian shot-stopper was wrong-footed as Senegalese defender Moustapha Sall produced a towering header to open the scoring on 57 minutes. Thomas Lemar, Love and Helder Costa all missed glaring chances as Monaco threw caution to the wind looking for an equaliser. But the dogged visitors eventually earned a point on 84 minutes when the 31-year-old Love, who joined from Corinthians in the January transfer window, stabbed home in a chaotic goalmouth scramble. The Valentine's Day goal from Love left Saint-Etienne coach Galtier feeling bittersweet. ""We didn't take our chances when we were on top -- we lost two points due to a weak 10 minutes. It's a shame for the players and the fans, but it's exciting what with the Cup and a late run up the league,"" he said. Earlier on Sunday Lyon recorded their third successive big win, thumping Caen 4-1 to further boost their hopes of snatching Champions League qualification from a frustrating season. Samuel Umtiti, Alexandre Lacazette, Maxwell Cornet and Corentin Tolisso all scored for OL with Andy Delort replying for Caen as Lyon bounced back from their 3-0 defeat at Paris Saint-Germain in the French Cup during the week. Bruno Genesio's side had won 3-0 against both Bordeaux and Angers in their previous two league outings and along with Saint-Etienne will hope to give Monaco a run for second spot. On Saturday, runaway leaders Paris Saint-Germain extended their record-breaking unbeaten league run to 35 matches but they had to settle for a point in a 0-0 draw at home to Lille in their final outing before facing Chelsea in the Champions League on Tuesday. PSG coach Laurent Blanc rested the likes of Zlatan Ibrahimovic, Thiago Silva, Thiago Motta and Maxwell, while Edinson Cavani missed their best chance, somehow blasting off target with the goal gaping after Lille 'keeper Vincent Enyeama dropped a cross. The capital club are an enormous 24 points clear of Monaco in second. Among Saturday's other games, Nantes beat Lorient 2-1 to make it 15 games unbeaten between league and cup.

Tiemoue Bakayoko steered in a header shortly before half-time to bring Monaco back level, but Hadi Sacko, on loan from Sporting Lisbon, drilled a 54th-minute strike beyond Paul Nardi to send Sochaux into the quarter-finals. Gazelec Ajaccio claimed a 2-1 victory away to fourth-tier Saint-Malo, but the Ligue 1 side had to come from behind after Steven Creac'h put the hosts in front at Guingamp's Stade du Roudourou. However, second-half goals from Kevin Mayi and Khalid Boutaib sent the Corsican outfit into the last eight, with fifth-tier Granville joining them following a 1-0 extra-time victory over second-division Bourg-en-Bresse. On Wednesday, holders Paris Saint-Germain will seek to extend their unbeaten domestic record this season when they host Lyon, with Saint-Etienne visiting Troyes and Bordeaux at home to Nantes in other all-Ligue 1 ties.

218,06/02/2016,19:20,"Monaco get Champions League boost, Lyon frustrate Angers",Monaco's hopes of Champions League football next season got a boost with a 1-0 win over Nice on Saturday as Lyon rekindled their European challenge by beating Angers 3-0.,"On a stormy, tense day in Ligue 1, seven players were red-carded in seven games. The Riveria derby clash between the second and third placed teams failed to ignite Monaco's Stade Louis II before midfielder Tiemoue Bakayoko struck after 81 minutes. A long free-kick off the boot of Portuguese midfielder Moutinho found Bakayoko who slotted in after the ball had bounced in front of Nice goalkeeper Yoan Cardinale. The win allows Monaco, second behind runaway leaders Paris Saint-Germain, to move six points clear of Nice, who remain third, two points ahead of Angers with Lyon moving up to fifth a further point back. Monaco's Moroccan midfielder Nabil Dirar was sent off after he vigorously disputed a call by referee Tony Chapron, as Angers were also playing a man down following a 16th minute red card for Thomas Mangani. ""The players showed that apart from PSG, there is no team better than us. We know each other well, we know how to play at 10 and showed this,"" said Monaco coach Leonardo Jardim. ""The players had a great match."" ""Paradoxically, the sending off seemed to do them good,"" said Nice coach Claude Puel. ""If they continue to be successful like that they can even envisage catching Paris,"" added Puel of Monaco who trail Paris Saint-Germain by 21 points. The reigning three-time champions will be looking to extend their Ligue 1 unbeaten streak at bitter rivals Marseille on Sunday. Lyon secured back-to-back league wins for the first time since November and gave new coach Bruno Genesio a first league victory away from home. Last season's runners-up took an early lead through Christophe Jallet, and the hosts fell two behind when winger Rachid Ghezzal picked out the roof of the net just after half-time. Corentin Tolisso wrapped up the scoring late on as Lyon moved to within three points of the Champions League places. ""It is satisfying to have a second consecutive victory and what was important is the way we found confidence as a team,"" Genesio said. ""I am not sure that it was a better performance than in the defeat at Saint Etienne or the draw with Marseille, but with our first real chance we got the opening goal and that is always so important now in Ligue 1."" With eight of the bottom nine teams in action in the five late Saturday kick-offs it was unsurprisingly a tense evening of football. Montpellier blew a great chance to haul themselves out of the bottom three as they were held to a 1-1 draw by ten-man Lorient. Francois Bellugou was given a straight red card, and Kevin Berigaud took advantage to give Frederic Hantz's Montpellier a half-time lead. But Jimmy Cabot scored his first goal for Lorient since joining from Troyes last month to snatch a point. Reims made the most of Montpellier's slip-up as they saw off Caen 2-0. Goals from Thievy Bifouma and Prince Oniangue helped take Olivier Guegan's Reims three points clear of the relegation zone. Bastia picked up a much-needed victory by easing past bottom club Troyes 2-0 despite having a man sent off for the fifth time in five league games. Goalkeeper Jean Louis Leca's red card was sandwiched by a Floyd Ayite brace for the Corsicans, as visiting Troyes were reduced to nine men in a feisty encounter. Gazelec Ajaccio are now winless in six league games and just a point above the drop zone after playing out a goalless draw with fellow strugglers Guingamp, who had Lionel Mathis kick off the pattern of the night with his 10th minute dismissal. Meanwhile, a 0-0 stalemate with Nantes leaves Toulouse second-from-bottom and six points from safety."
219,06/02/2016,19:20,"Monaco get Champions League boost, Lyon frustrate Angers",Monaco's hopes of Champions League football next season got a boost with a 1-0 win over Nice on Saturday as Lyon rekindled their European challenge by beating Angers 3-0.,"On a stormy, tense day in Ligue 1, seven players were red-carded in seven games. The Riveria derby clash between the second and third placed teams failed to ignite Monaco's Stade Louis II before midfielder Tiemoue Bakayoko struck after 81 minutes. A long free-kick off the boot of Portuguese midfielder Moutinho found Bakayoko who slotted in after the ball had bounced in front of Nice goalkeeper Yoan Cardinale. The win allows Monaco, second behind runaway leaders Paris Saint-Germain, to move six points clear of Nice, who remain third, two points ahead of Angers with Lyon moving up to fifth a further point back. Monaco's Moroccan midfielder Nabil Dirar was sent off after he vigorously disputed a call by referee Tony Chapron, as Angers were also playing a man down following a 16th minute red card for Thomas Mangani. ""The players showed that apart from PSG, there is no team better than us. We know each other well, we know how to play at 10 and showed this,"" said Monaco coach Leonardo Jardim. ""The players had a great match."" ""Paradoxically, the sending off seemed to do them good,"" said Nice coach Claude Puel. ""If they continue to be successful like that they can even envisage catching Paris,"" added Puel of Monaco who trail Paris Saint-Germain by 21 points. The reigning three-time champions will be looking to extend their Ligue 1 unbeaten streak at bitter rivals Marseille on Sunday. Lyon secured back-to-back league wins for the first time since November and gave new coach Bruno Genesio a first league victory away from home. Last season's runners-up took an early lead through Christophe Jallet, and the hosts fell two behind when winger Rachid Ghezzal picked out the roof of the net just after half-time. Corentin Tolisso wrapped up the scoring late on as Lyon moved to within three points of the Champions League places. ""It is satisfying to have a second consecutive victory and what was important is the way we found confidence as a team,"" Genesio said. ""I am not sure that it was a better performance than in the defeat at Saint Etienne or the draw with Marseille, but with our first real chance we got the opening goal and that is always so important now in Ligue 1."" With eight of the bottom nine teams in action in the five late Saturday kick-offs it was unsurprisingly a tense evening of football. Montpellier blew a great chance to haul themselves out of the bottom three as they were held to a 1-1 draw by ten-man Lorient. Francois Bellugou was given a straight red card, and Kevin Berigaud took advantage to give Frederic Hantz's Montpellier a half-time lead. But Jimmy Cabot scored his first goal for Lorient since joining from Troyes last month to snatch a point. Reims made the most of Montpellier's slip-up as they saw off Caen 2-0. Goals from Thievy Bifouma and Prince Oniangue helped take Olivier Guegan's Reims three points clear of the relegation zone. Bastia picked up a much-needed victory by easing past bottom club Troyes 2-0 despite having a man sent off for the fifth time in five league games. Goalkeeper Jean Louis Leca's red card was sandwiched by a Floyd Ayite brace for the Corsicans, as visiting Troyes were reduced to nine men in a feisty encounter. Gazelec Ajaccio are now winless in six league games and just a point above the drop zone after playing out a goalless draw with fellow strugglers Guingamp, who had Lionel Mathis kick off the pattern of the night with his 10th minute dismissal.

220,03/02/2016,21:14,Lacazette fires Lyon past Bordeaux,Alexandre Lacazette struck twice as Lyon secured a welcome 3-0 win over Bordeaux in Ligue 1 on Wednesday for just their second victory in 11 matches.,"Lacazette struck four minutes prior to half-time at Parc OL before quick-fire goals from Lacazette and Aldo Kalulu late on ensured Bruno Genesio's side put an end to Bordeaux's seven-game unbeaten run. France international Mathieu Debuchy made his Bordeaux debut following his loan move from Arsenal, while Uruguayan striker Diego Rolan was twice denied by fine saves from Lyon goalkeeper Anthony Lopes. Lyon climbed back into the top half of the table, above 10th-place Bordeaux on goal difference, and are six points adrift of the Champions League spots. Nice leapfrogged Angers into third as Hatem Ben Arfa grabbed his 11th goal of the campaign in a 1-0 win over Toulouse, while 10-man Angers were beaten 2-1 at Reims. Nantes extended their unbeaten streak to 10 matches following a 3-1 victory over Gazelec Ajaccio, Guingamp condemned lowly Troyes to a 4-0 defeat and Lille earned a 1-0 win over Caen. Runaway leaders Paris Saint-Germain can break Nantes' 20-year-old record unbeaten run in Ligue 1 later when they host Lorient. Laurent Blanc's side stretched their streak without a loss to 32 matches with Sunday's 2-0 victory at Saint-Etienne and can claim the top-flight record outright if they avoid defeat at the Parc des Princes. On Tuesday, Monaco tightened their grip on second place with a 2-0 win at home to Bastia, while 10-man Marseille claimed a 1-0 victory at Montpellier to push their unbeaten run in the league to 11 matches."
221,02/02/2016,21:04,Monaco tighten grip on second with Bastia win,Monaco bounced back from a chastening defeat at Angers with a 2-0 victory over Bastia on Tuesday to reassert their grip on second place in Ligue 1.,"Former Monaco defender Francois Modesto gifted the hosts the opening goal as he inadvertently turned a corner into his own net 10 minutes before half-time at the Stade Louis II. Bernando Silva's deflected strike on 73 minutes wrong-footed Bastia goalkeeper Jean-Louis Leca as Monaco registered a third win in four attempts to move five points clear of third-place Angers. Brazilian striker Vagner Love made his first start for Monaco following his January move from Corinthians, completing 75 minutes before he was replaced by Argentine Guido Carrillo. Marseille will seek to extend their unbeaten league run to 11 matches when they travel to Montpellier later, while runaway leaders Paris Saint-Germain can break Nantes' 20-year-old record unbeaten run in Ligue 1 on Wednesday. Laurent Blanc's side stretched their streak without a loss to 32 matches with Sunday's 2-0 victory at Saint-Etienne and can claim the top-flight record outright if they avoid defeat at home to Lorient."
222,31/01/2016,11:51,Monaco bring Brazilian Jemerson to Europe,Monaco have sealed a deal to bring Jemerson to the principality on a four-and-a-half year contract from Atletico Mineiro in his native Brazil.,"The central defender, who was likened to German legend Franz Beckenbauer, played over 100 times for Mineiro and scored seven times. The 23-year-old received his first call-up to the Brazilian national squad in November, but did not play. Jemerson arrived in Monaco on Saturday, has passed his medical and could play for Leonardo Jardim's men very soon. He told the club website that he wants to play international football and in the Champions League, saying that Monaco is a ""big European club with a high profile."" Jardim is building a squad with plenty of Portuguese-speaking players as Jemerson joins the likes of Fabinho, Ricardo Carvalho and Joao Moutinho at the Stade Louis II. According to various sources, the fee will be in the region of 11million euros ($11.9million). Meanwhile Monaco have released Spanish defender Borja Lopez after his unsuccessful loan spell at Arouca in Portugal, and the 21-year-old will now play for Barcelona B."
223,30/01/2016,19:04,Angers see off pitiful Monaco to retake third,Angers inflicted a heavy 3-0 defeat on second-placed Monaco on Saturday to end a three-match losing streak and reignite their unlikely challenge for a Champions League spot in France.,"Home team Angers took an early lead when Cheikh N'Doye deflected in Romain Saiss's effort after Monaco failed to clear a corner. N'Doye doubled the advantage before half-time as Angers took utter control, before gloss was added to the scoreline in the second period by Mohamed Yattara. Monaco stay 21 points behind champions elect Paris Saint-Germain, who play at Saint-Etienne on Sunday night. Angers move, temporarily at least, above Nice and into the third and final Champions League place. ""Today I think we totally failed to turn up,"" said Monaco coach Leonardo Jardim. ""We didn't play with the intensity needed to compete in this league. ""It's difficult to explain. It's not possible to play really well five or six days ago (in a 4-0 win over Toulouse) and then perform like we did today."" In a lively start to proceedings at the Stade Ange Casanova, Bernardo Silva wastefully chipped the ball straight at Angers goalkeeper Alexandre Letellier, while at the other end Billy Ketkeophomphone had a long-range effort pushed wide by Danijel Subasic. Stephane Moulin's side have been a menace from set-pieces all season and they took a 19th minute lead from a corner. Visiting stopper Subasic kept out a free header from Romain Thomas, but midfielder Saiss got to the rebound first and his shot flew in via the shin of Angers top-scorer N'Doye. The Senegalese midfielder has had a fantastic debut season in the top flight and the fortuitous effort was his sixth league goal this term. Monaco were wearing their training shirts as all three of their kits clashed with Angers' home strip, but this was a very competitive encounter and Subasic had to be alert to tip away powerful strikes from Pierrick Capelle and N'Doye. But it was another scrappy goal that gave N'Doye a brace and Angers a two-goal cushion that they thoroughly deserved. N'Doye's initial shot was turned onto the crossbar by a stunning Subasic save. Yattara then hit the loose ball towards the far corner with the aid of a big deflection, and although Subasic got across to save, the Monaco defence watched on as N'Doye prodded in from on the goalline. The visitors started the second half with far more intensity and attacking verve, and Tiemoue Bakayoko drew a low save from Letellier. But the hosts made the points safe ten minutes into the second period. N'Doye had a great chance to complete the first hat-trick of his career but miskicked straight to Yattara, who did the rest with aplomb. Letellier got down quickly to his right to deny Fabio Coentrao as Monaco searched for a consolation goal that would not prove forthcoming. Angers are showing no sign of letting up in the race for Europe as their rivals also keep dropping points. ""Lots of people don't like Angers, but I really like them. They're a good side with 37 points, a return which they deserve for the quality they've shown,"" added Jardim. A very disappointing Monaco lost this match just when threatening to pull away from the chasing pack, while Marseille were held 1-1 by struggling Lille at the Velodrome on Friday."
224,24/01/2016,18:06,Portuguese trio fire classy Monaco second,"Portuguese trio Bernardo Silva, Fabio Coentrao and Helder Costa were all on target as Monaco climbed second in Ligue 1 on Sunday thanks to a 4-0 dismissal of Toulouse.","Monaco still trail runaway leaders Paris Saint Germain, who beat Angers 5-1 Saturday, by 21 points, but climbed three clear of Nice, who had been second overnight after their 2-1 win at Lorient. ""The thing will be to keep a minimum of three points between us and third place until the end of the season,"" Monaco midfielder Tiemoue Bakayoko said after. The victory put Monaco ten points clear of Lyon and Marseille, who meet at the new Parc OL later Sunday. Third last season behind PSG and Lyon, Monaco outclassed relegation threatened Toulouse as Argentine Guido Carrillo also got on the scoresheet. It was the first time the team have scored four this season and they did so with new recruit the Brazilian striker Wagner Love watching from the stands. ""We played well for a change,"" Monaco's Portuguese handler Leonardo Jardim joked afterwards. ""And we saved a penalty at 2-0 which may have changed the game,"" Jardim said of Croat 'keeper Danijel Subasic's fine effort to keep out Wissam Ben Yedder spot-kick. On Saturday, Zlatan Ibrahimovic opened the scoring for PSG at the Parc des Princes with his 17th league goal of the season before Lucas doubled the lead for Laurent Blanc's side just before half-time. The floodgates then opened after the break with Gregory Van der Wiel rounding off a superb team move for PSG's third, only for Pierrick Capelle to pull one back, but Angel Di Maria then scored twice in the space of four minutes to complete the rout. Hatem Ben Arfa netted his 10th goal of the season as Nice beat Lorient 2-1 while on Friday new Rennes coach Rolland Courbis oversaw their first home win in ten matches - 1-0 over Gazelec-Ajaccio - as they climbed to fourth. Troyes finally registered their first win of the season after coming from behind to win 3-1 at Lille, with Bordeaux rallying late on to draw 2-2 at Nantes."
225,17/01/2016,19:23,"Marseille win, Monaco return to second","Marseille snapped a four-match winless run in Ligue 1 with a 3-1 victory over Caen on Sunday, while Monaco reclaimed second place after winning 2-0 away to Lorient.","Marseille arrived at the Stade Michel d'Ornano unbeaten in seven league matches, although they had drawn their last four outings, and grabbed a 12th-minute lead when goal-line technology was used to adjudge Michy Batshuayi's shot to have crossed the line after coming back off the post. Batshuayi should have added a second with the goal at his mercy a few minutes later, but the Belgian atoned for that miss by setting up Georges-Kevin Nkoudou to steer in Marseille's second on the hour. Ronny Rodelin pulled one back for the hosts after beating Steve Mandanda to a free-kick, but Bouna Sarr volleyed home Alaixys Romao's inviting cross on 83 minutes to clinch a fifth win in six away games for OM. The victory pushed Marseille up to seventh, five points adrift of third-place Angers, with Caen staying in sixth. Earlier, Monaco moved back ahead of Angers after also stretching their unbeaten run in the league to eight games. Thomas Lemar gave Monaco a 53rd-minute lead in Brittany before Joao Moutinho curled home an exquisite free-kick to leave Leonardo Jardim's men 21 points behind runaway leaders Paris Saint-Germain. PSG recorded their ninth consecutive win in all competitions and extended their club record unbeaten league run to 30 matches dating back to last March as Zlatan Ibrahimovic's 73rd-minute strike was enough for them to see off Toulouse 1-0 on Saturday. Later, Rhone rivals Saint-Etienne and Lyon meet at the Stade-Geoffroy Guichard with both sides looking to work their way back into contention for Europe."
226,13/01/2016,22:28,Vagner Love signs for Monaco from Corinthians,"Brazilian striker Vagner Love has joined Monaco from Corinthians in his homeland, the French Ligue 1 club said on Wednesday.","The 31-year-old Brazil international, known for his colourful braids, has signed a contract until June 2017. Love made his name in Europe during an eight-year spell with CSKA Moscow in Russia, during which time he helped the club win the 2005 UEFA Cup and three domestic titles. Capped 20 times by the Selecao, Love helped Corinthians to the Brazilian title in 2015, scoring 14 times along the way. ""I hope to bring all my experience to the Monaco team to help us achieve the aims set by the management,"" said Love in an official club statement. He will wear the No.9 jersey in the Principality."
227,09/01/2016,23:54,Monaco won't take injured Falcao back from Chelsea,Colombian striker Radamel Falcao will not return to parent club Monaco in the winter transfer window with the French Ligue 1 side telling him to stay at Chelsea to nurse his thigh injury.,"Falcao, 29, has been on loan at the English champions but has not played since October 31. He had been expected to go back to Monaco in January. ""He has been injured for six to eight weeks. In these circumstances, we took the decision that he will not be returning,"" said Monaco vice-president Vadim Vasilyev. Falcao has scored just once in nine games at Chelsea having scored only four goals on loan at Manchester United last season. He had joined Monaco in a 60 million euro ($65.5 million) deal from Atletico Madrid in 2013 after scoring 70 goals for the Spaniards. Meanwhile, Vasilyev said that former CSKA Moscow striker Wagner Love will sign an 18-month deal later this week having scored 14 times to help Corinthians to the Brazilian title in December. Italian striker Stephan El Shaarawy, on loan from AC Milan, is expected to leave Monaco, added Vasilyev."
228,07/01/2016,21:42,Makelele named Monaco technical director,"Former France midfielder Claude Makelele has been named the new technical director of Monaco, the principality club announced on Thursday.","The one-time Chelsea and Real Madrid star, who played for France in their 2006 World Cup final defeat to Italy, had been out of the game since being sacked as coach of Bastia in November 2014. He had previously been an assistant coach at Paris Saint-Germain after retiring as a player at the capital club in May 2011. Monaco said that Makelele's role ""will be to assist the vice-president, Vadim Vasilyev, in all sporting matters."" Sources close to the club said Makelele, 42, had agreed ""a long-term contract""."

PSG coach Laurent Blanc rested several key players including Angel di Maria, Edinson Cavani and Thiago Silva, but still fielded a strong team with the likes of Ibrahimovic, Verratti, Blaise Matuidi and Thiago Motta. ""Getting back into competition is always the hardest part, even more so with the tricky weather conditions,"" said Blanc after PSG's first competitive game following France's short winter break. ""We would have liked to have played better to wrap things up earlier and make things easier but we weren't capable of doing that this afternoon. ""The most important thing is to move on and we've done that."" Elsewhere, Lyon made a promising start under new coach Bruno Genesio as Maxwell Cornet and Rachid Ghezzal scored twice apiece with Claudio Beauvue, Sergi Darder and Corentin Tolisso also on target in a 7-0 hammering of fifth-division Limoges. Monaco hit double digits with a crushing 10-2 defeat of seventh-tier Saint-Jean-Beaulieu in a local derby as Lacina Traore scored four first-half goals before he was sent off for a half-time altercation. Saint-Etienne were given a scare by Raon-l'Etape as the Ligue 1 side were taken to penalties following a 1-1 draw, eventually prevailing 4-3 in a shootout against their fifth-tier opponents. Bordeaux came from behind to beat third-tier Frejus Saint-Raphael 3-2 with Diego Rolan grabbing a 90th-minute winner for the visitors after Cheick Diabate had twice levelled for Willy Sagnol's side. Montpellier, who saw Pascal Baills and Bruno Martini take joint control of the first team after the resignation of Rolland Courbis last month, edged past fifth-division Epernay 1-0 courtesy of a second-half goal from Mustapha Yatabare. Benjamin Jeannot scored an extra-time winner for Lorient as they overcame Ligue 2 outfit Tours 3-2, while Lille scraped past Amiens AC 1-0 with Guingamp comfortable 4-0 winners at Chantilly."
230,20/12/2015,02:16,PSG dominate as off-field matters overshadow French game,"French football was dominated by Paris Saint-Germain in 2015, but the game in the country has regularly been overshadowed by affairs off the field over the last 12 months.","PSG won an unprecedented clean sweep of the domestic trophies last season and have enjoyed a record-breaking first half to the current campaign that has seen them open up an enormous lead at the top of Ligue 1. The only teams to beat Laurent Blanc's side since March have been Barcelona and Real Madrid, both in the Champions League. They had equalled the club record for their longest unbeaten sequence in the top flight of 27 games - and set a new Ligue 1 winter break points record of 51 with a win in their final match of the year in Caen. Meanwhile, Zlatan Ibrahimovic, the dominant personality in the French game, wrote his name firmly into the history books by passing Pauleta's club record tally of 109 goals in all competitions when he scored a brace in a 2-1 win for Paris over bitter rivals Marseille in October. But where Paris again fell short was in the Champions League -- they made the continent sit up and take notice when they beat Chelsea last season only to fall to eventual winners Barca in the quarter-finals. The club's Qatari owners hope the summer signing of Argentina winger Angel Di Maria from Manchester United can help propel them further in 2016, with president Nasser Al-Khelaifi declaring: ""We are close to our dream."" They can focus all their energies on that competition because their rivals at home cannot keep up. Lyon pushed them almost all the way in the title race last season, with Alexandre Lacazette and Nabil Fekir being named France's player and young player of the year respectively. However, with Fekir now out injured long term, they are struggling awfully this season. Monaco's performance in reaching the quarter-finals of the Champions League was laudible but they continue to sell their best players -- including Anthony Martial to Manchester United -- undermining their chances of genuine on-field success in the process. Marseille, meanwhile, continue to lament the shock departure of enigmatic Argentine coach Marcelo Bielsa in August. Lyon played their final game at their old Stade de Gerland in December and will move into an impressive new 59,000-seat stadium early in the new year. The French footballing landscape is changing and Bordeaux took up residence in a new stadium of their own earlier this year as France gears up for Euro 2016. The finals could mark the dawn of a new era for the game in France after an often difficult last few months. This is a country still raw from the terror attacks in and around Paris that left 130 people dead, and the national sport was one of the targets on that night of November 13. Before the full scale of what was happening became clear, three loud explosions emanated from directly outside the Stade de France during France's 2-0 win over Germany in a friendly. The game carried on in a surreal atmosphere and only later did it become clear that the explosions were suicide bomb attacks. It also later transpired that the France midfielder Lassana Diarra's cousin was among the victims as carnage took hold elsewhere in Paris. ""We are all proud to be French and what's happened will leave a mark on all of us,"" admitted the France coach Didier Deschamps. Those events led to serious concerns about the hosting of a major tournament so soon afterwards, but any suggestions the European Championship will be moved elsewhere were quickly dismissed. Meanwhile, two figures have continued to hog the headlines in the closing weeks of the year. While legendary former player and UEFA president Michel Platini has been tangled up in the scandal engulfing FIFA, star striker Karim Benzema was charged by police and sidelined from the national side due to a blackmail affair involving a sex-tape and his team-mate Mathieu Valbuena. Both stories threaten to run on and on well into 2016."
231,19/12/2015,20:06,Ibrahimovic wondergoal as PSG break points record,Paris Saint-Germain go into the winter break with a Ligue 1 record points haul of 51 after a 3-0 away win at Caen lit up by a thrilling Zlatan Ibrahimovic strike on Saturday.,"Already 1-0 up from an early Angel di Maria goal Ibrahimovic produced a stunning 25-yard snap-shot which flew into the top corner of the Caen goal on 36 minutes. As the stadium rose to acclaim the giant Swede for the simple power and precision of his split-second effort, even the beaten 'keeper was left smiling. The win lifted PSG to a massive 20 points clear of Angers, in action on Sunday at Saint-Etienne. It also extends the star-studded Qatar-backed club's unbeaten record in the league to 28 games since March. ""This calendar year, 2015, has been a really, really good year for PSG,"" said coach Laurent Blanc. ""But halfway through the season, records don't mean much to me,"" he warned. Summer-signing Di Maria rounded off the scoring with his sixth Ligue 1 goal since joining from Manchester United, making it 3-0 as he rounded off a slick team effort on 50 minutes. ""I was happy with the way many of the players, whose minds were on the long trips most of them were about to make. But you saw how they played, right from the off,"" said Blanc. Caen 'keeper Remy Vercoutre deserves a special mention himself after saving four stinging shots in a bewildering first-half goalmouth scramble, two of them spectacular stops with the feet from Lucas Moura and Ibrahimovic. Not to be outdone PSG's German 'keeper Kevin Trapp then saved an 84th minute penalty from Caen's Andy Delort as the champions shone in every area against a side who went into the game in fourth place. Third-place Monaco end a turbulent 2015 at Troyes later Saturday, with the bottom club still looking for a first win of the season. Among the other fixtures is a Brittany derby between Guingamp, who are in the relegation zone, and a Rennes side with just one win in their last 13 league games. Marseille will look to end a difficult year on a high note when they visit Bordeaux on Sunday night in the last match before France takes a two-week winter break over the festive period. On Friday teenager Olivier Boscagli sent Nice into the French winter break on a winning note as he struck the only goal in a 1-0 victory at home to Montpellier."
232,16/12/2015,18:55,Bordeaux down Monaco to reach League Cup quarters,Three-time winners Bordeaux booked their place in the quarter-finals of the French League Cup with a 3-0 victory at home to Monaco on Wednesday.,"Teenage striker Adam Ounas struck a superb 16th-minute opener for the hosts before Uruguayan forward Diego Rolan curled home a second goal just before the hour. Bordeaux captain Henri Saivet headed in a third two minutes from time to seal just a second win for Willy Sagnol's men in their last eight matches. Bordeaux won the last of their League Cup titles in 2009 under then-coach Laurent Blanc and also went on to claim the Ligue 1 crown that same season. Later on Wednesday, holders and record five-time winners Paris Saint-Germain start their defence against 2013 winners Saint-Etienne at the Parc des Princes. Lyon will bid farewell to the Stade de Gerland when they host second-division Tours ahead of moving into their new 59,000-capacity stadium in January, while Marseille visit Bourg en Bresse."
233,13/12/2015,17:30,Narrow win lifts Monaco up to second,Monaco moved provisionally into second place in Ligue 1 with a 1-0 win over Saint-Etienne on Sunday thanks to a second-half Fabinho penalty.,"The Brazilian international netted from the spot eight minutes from time to settle a dour game in the principality club's favour and lift them into second ahead of Sunday's other games. Monaco were eager to bounce back from a 4-1 hiding away to Tottenham Hotspur on Thursday that saw them eliminated from the Europa League. Leonardo Jardim's men are now unbeaten in five Ligue 1 games and move above Caen and Angers, although the latter can reclaim second when they host Bordeaux later. Monaco are also 14 points behind runaway leaders Paris Saint-Germain, who defend their unbeaten domestic record this season when they host Lyon on Sunday evening. Jardim made a notable change in goal, leaving out Croatian international Danijel Subasic and handing a debut to France under-21 prospect Paul Nardi, but the latter hardly had a save to make at the Stade Louis II. Helder Costa struck the bar for the hosts in the first half before Saint-Etienne felt they should have had a penalty when Ricardo Carvalho grappled with Loic Perrin in the box. The visitors then had full-back Kevin Malcuit sent off for a second yellow card in the second half and Pierre-Yves Polomat was penalised for a handball in the box with time running out. Fabinho made no mistake from 12 yards to condemn Saint-Etienne to an eighth league defeat already this season. Sunday's other game sees Marseille host Gazelec Ajaccio looking for a win that could lift them into the top six."
234,26/11/2015,19:00,No away fans as PSG play first home game since Paris attacks,Paris Saint-Germain will wear shirts with the words 'Je suis Paris' for their first home game since the terror attacks on Saturday as Ligue 1 is played without away supporters for a second successive weekend.,"The three-time reigning French champions face rock-bottom Troyes in their first game at the Parc des Princes since three suicide bombers blew themselves up outside the Stade de France on November 13, with 130 people in total killed in a series of attacks on the French capital. It will be the second time they wear the 'Je suis Paris' shirts after Wednesday's Champions League game against Malmo when they strolled into the last 16 with a 5-0 rout of their Group A rivals in Sweden. As well as the lack of away fans, security will be beefed up with spectators required to present identity papers and banned from carrying bags into the grounds with the security perimeter outside the Paris stadium extended. Similar security measures were also planned for Thursday's Europa League clash between Marseille and Dutch side Groningen in the Stade Vélodrome. The French football league (LFP) confirmed Thursday that the subsequent three rounds of Ligue 1 games and the next two rounds of Ligue 2 fixtures will be played without away fans with the ban to be extended to European Champions League and Europa League games playing in France until December 10. The decision was taken because of lack of available police with France in a state of emergency after the attacks, and with the COP21 climate change conference taking place in the French capital from November 30 to December 11. ""Given the current circumstances, the travel ban of supporters will be maintained, because of the rationalisation of security measures, as it is obvious that the police have other things to do now than accompany the fans,"" French Minister of State for Sports Thierry Braillard said. Travelling fans will not be able to attend games until December 18-20, the final weekend before the Christmas break. PSG will be overwhelming favourites to maintain their unbeaten Ligue 1 run against Troyes who by contrast have failed to win a game with just five points after 14 games. Troyes defender Jonathan Martins Pereira admitted the odds were stacked against the side from 150km southeast of Paris, not only because they will be without their fans. But he warned: ""Even if we only have a five-percent chance, we'll give it everything we have to try and pull off a shock. ""We'll go to Parc des Princes to stand up to Paris Saint-Germain. And why? There are so many surprises in football ... "" In the weekend's early match on Friday, Lyon, sitting second 13 points behind PSG, face Montpellier badly in need of a quick fix after being bundled out of the Champions League by Gent in midweek. The Belgian visitors' 2-1 win in the last European game to be played at the Stade de Gerland put an end to Lyon's hopes of reaching the last 16 in what has been a miserable continental campaign. Caen, equal on points with Lyon but behind on goal difference, travel to Bordeaux on Sunday looking to make up for last week's disappointing 0-0 draw at home against Angers, as Nice a point behind the Normandy side, travel to Toulouse on Saturday.

235,01/11/2015,19:56,Monaco hand Angers rare loss as PSG extend lead,Monaco dealt surprise high-fliers Angers just a second defeat of the season on Sunday with a 1-0 victory over the Ligue 1 newcomers.,"Angers came into the weekend as the nearest challengers to runaway leaders Paris Saint-Germain but slipped 10 points adrift as Mario Pasalic's first-half goal at the Stade Louis II snapped the visitors' six-game unbeaten run. For Monaco it was the first time they had registered back-to-back wins this campaign as Leonardo Jardim's side moved up three places to sixth, two points behind second-placed Lyon, who are above Angers and Saint-Etienne on goal difference. ""This victory is very important for us, it's our first at home this term,"" said Jardim, who had seen his team pick up just three points from five home matches before Sunday. ""I hope with three straight wins (in all competitions) that the team will kick on from here. Winning breeds confidence and that's very important for us."" Angers have made an incredible start to their first season back in the French top flight since 1994 but were undone by Chelsea loanee Pasalic's close-range finish on 35 minutes after a knockdown header from towering Ivorian striker Lacina Traore. Stephan El Shaarawy came close to adding a second just after half-time but the toe of Ismael Traore diverted the Italy international's shot just wide of Ludovic Butelle's near post. Rony Lopes then produced a glaring miss shortly after when he somehow failed to hit the target after Elderson Echiejile's low cross had seemingly presented the Portuguese midfielder with a simple tap-in. Skipper Cheikh N'Doye had the best chance to snatch a point for Angers but the Senegalese midfielder nodded wide from Abdoul Camara's looping cross in the closing stages. Earlier, Nice were held in check by Lille in a 0-0 draw at the Allianz Riviera while Marseille, just three points above the relegation zone, visit Nantes later on. Reigning champions PSG stretched their already sizeable lead at the top with a 1-0 victory in Rennes on Friday courtesy of Angel di Maria's second-half strike. Lyon climbed up to second on Saturday as Claudio Beauvue's late penalty steered them to an unconvincing 1-0 win over 10-man Troyes, with Saint-Etienne easing to a 3-0 win over a slumping Reims side."
236,29/10/2015,02:15,Rennes betting on upset against dominant PSG,"Unbeaten Paris Saint-Germain will go 10 points clear at the top of Ligue 1, at least for 24 hours, with a win against Rennes in Brittany on Friday.","The capital club's imperial domestic form in recent times has raised the question of whether anyone can beat them in Ligue 1 this season ahead of a match brought forward to help Paris prepare for their trip to Real Madrid in the Champions League next week. Laurent Blanc's side were streets ahead of Saint-Etienne -- seen as contenders for a top-three finish -- in a 4-1 stroll at the Parc des Princes last Sunday. They are currently seven points clear of second-placed Angers and have gone 22 matches without losing in all competitions since being beaten by Barcelona in the Champions League quarter-finals last April. In Ligue 1, their unbeaten run covers 20 games going back to March, and few give Rennes, or anyone, a chance of ending that record right now. ""Against PSG, I get the impression that players from other teams go onto the pitch with a feeling of resignation,"" former Lyon, Paris and France goalkeeper Gregory Coupet told leading sports daily L'Equipe this week. ""For example, on Sunday for PSG v Saint-Etienne, we try to talk it up as a big match, but well...you could see that they were just trying to avoid getting hammered. ""It feels like when clubs face PSG they go into the game knowing already they won't get one point never mind three."" Rennes have gone six games without a league win, although a strong line-up secured a 1-0 victory at Bastia in the League Cup on Tuesday. ""They are superior to us in every area,"" said Rennes coach Philippe Montanier, although he remains hopeful of causing an upset. ""In one match everything is possible. If someone wants to become rich they should put a euro on us."" Javier Pastore, who missed the win over Saint-Etienne with conjunctivitis, could start for the visitors at Roazhon Park if Blanc decides to rest one of Angel Di Maria, Edinson Cavani or Zlatan Ibrahimovic. The Swede, who continues to be linked with a move to MLS when his contract expires at the end of the season, has scored seven goals in his last five league games. David Luiz, who has had a knee injury, might not feature while goalkeeper Benoit Costil could return for Rennes after being injured on international duty for France last month. Angers are in action on Sunday away to Monaco, who are unbeaten in seven games and beginning to look like the side that finished third last season. Caen, currently in third, visit struggling Bastia on Saturday, while Lyon are away at winless bottom side Troyes as they seek a confidence-boosting win ahead of a crucial Champions League clash against Zenit St Petersburg. Saint-Etienne are at home to Reims as they look to bounce back from a punishing trip to Paris, and Marseille travel to Nantes on Sunday evening. Before that, Nice will seek to get back on track after a shock loss to struggling Gazelec Ajaccio when they face Lille on the Cote d'Azur. Claude Puel's side had scored 17 goals in recording four straight wins prior to that, inspired by the superb form of Hatem Ben Arfa, who is now being linked with a France recall. ""I am not going to question Hatem's quality and his talent,"" France coach Didier Deschamps told Eurosport as he refused to rule out naming the mercurial playmaker for next month's friendly matches against Germany and England. ""Why not? I will think about it based on what he has done with Nice,"" added Deschamps of Ben Arfa, who has had a chequered career but has scored seven Ligue 1 goals this season.

237,25/10/2015,19:52,"Monaco, Marseille claim welcome wins","Monaco closed in on the European places in Ligue 1 with a 1-0 win at Reims on Sunday while Marseille recorded a much-needed victory on their travels, beating Lille 2-1.","The principality club had Bernardo Silva to thank as they came away with all three points from their trip to Champagne country against a Reims side who ended the game with 10 men. Leonardo Jardim's team opened the scoring in the 11th minute at the Stade Auguste-Delaune when Nabil Dirar crossed from the right and the diminutive Silva got up to head in his third goal of the season at the back post. They might have added to their lead but unfortunate Argentine striker Guido Carrillo hit both posts before the interval, heading against one upright from a Joao Moutinho corner and then seeing a low deflected shot come back off the other. Monaco were worthy winners, even if substitute Jordan Siebatcheu came close to equalising for Reims in stoppage time with a shot that beat Danijel Subasic in the away goal but rebounded back off the woodwork. The hosts had been reduced to 10 men midway through the second half when Antoine Devaux walked for a second yellow card, as Olivier Guegan's side slumped to a third straight 1-0 defeat. For Monaco, it was a first league win in a month and saw them make it seven matches without defeat in all competitions as they climb to eighth in the table. ""Away from home our team is very compact and very good in the transitions,"" said Jardim. ""We tried to score the second goal, first by playing our game, and then by trying to be more direct. We were unable to put the game to bed, but I think we deserved the victory."" Marseille, meanwhile, ended a run of seven games without a win as Michy Batshuayi and Romain Alessandrini scored to see off Lille in France's far north. Batshuayi opened the scoring late in the first half, converting his eighth goal already this season after Alessandrini's initial attempt had come back off the post. The Belgian then returned the favour in the second half, setting up Alessandrini for a superb curling finish high into the net to double Marseille's lead. Sebastien Corchia pulled a goal back for LOSC but, having scored just five goals in 10 league games before this weekend, finding an equaliser proved to be beyond them. ""I said yesterday that we would need men to win so I am very happy with our performance,"" said Marseille coach Michel. ""We were fantastic tonight and we need to play like this every time."" Elsewhere on Sunday, Bordeaux recorded just their third league win of the campaign, beating winless bottom club Troyes 1-0 thanks to a late strike by 18-year-old substitute Adam Ounas. Leaders and defending champions Paris Saint-Germain can extend their advantage at the top of the table to seven points with a win at home to Saint-Etienne in Sunday's late kick-off at the Parc des Princes. Second-placed Angers were held to a 0-0 draw at home by Guingamp on Saturday, a result that did nevertheless allow them to stretch their unbeaten run to six matches. Caen, in third, lost 2-0 at home to Nantes on Friday, while Lyon beat Toulouse 3-0 with goals by Sergi Darder, Mathieu Valbuena and Maxwell Cornet. Nice's superb run of form was abruptly ended in a 3-1 defeat at previously winless Gazelec Ajaccio, while Montpellier beat Bastia 2-0 and Lorient drew 1-1 with Rennes in a Brittany derby."
238,16/10/2015,22:38,Rafael rescues draw for Lyon at ten-man Monaco,Former Manchester United defender Rafael salvaged a 1-1 draw with an 85th minute equaliser for Lyon at ten-man Monaco in Ligue 1 action on Friday.,"The 25-year-old right-back, who spent seven years at Old Trafford and won three Premier League titles, came to the rescue as Monaco failed to hang on to their 39th-minute lead. ""I'm happy to get the goal but we're a bit disappointed that we didn't push on and get the win,"" said Rafael. ""The goal will give us some energy for the Champions League next week but we paid the price for a poor first half and a lack of rhythm."" Croatian international Mario Pasalic poached the opening goal for the home side six minutes before half-time following a corner from Thomas Lemar and a mistake by Lyon goalkeeper Anthony Lopes. The 20-year-old Pasalic, who is on loan from English champions Chelsea, planted his header past the embarrassed Lopes and put Leonardo Jardim's side in front. Monaco, who came into the match with a record of 10 victories and five draws against Lyon, appeared to be well on their way to improving that statistic before Rafael's first goal for the club. The task for Monaco to protect their lead was compromised with 24 minutes left when Brazilian defender Wallace was shown a straight red card for a horror tackle on Algerian winger Rachid Ghezzal. Then came Rafael's equaliser and a welcome boost for Hubert Fournier's men who now travel to Russia on Tuesday and a key Champions League tie against Zenit St Petersburg. Ligue 1 leaders Paris Saint-Germain put their undefeated start to the season on the line in the Saturday afternoon match at Bastia while Angers and Caen, who are the surprise rivals to Laurent Blanc's side and five points back, are also on the road. Promoted Angers travel to fourth-from-bottom Toulouse while Normandy outfit Caen travel to the Champagne region and a fixture against Reims. Marseille will have a section of their Velodrome stadium closed to supporters, following crowd trouble in the league match against Lyon last month, as they await Lorient in one of three Sunday fixtures that also feature high-scoring Nice at Rennes and Bordeaux at home to Montpellier in a battle of former champions."

France playmaker Clement Grenier is another long-term absentee and their attacking options were further reduced this week when teenage striker Aldo Kalulu was ruled out for two months with an ankle injury. French league rules allow clubs to sign a 'medical joker' outwith the transfer window to replace players ruled out with long-term injuries, but Lyon president Jean-Michel Aulas continues to rule out any possibility of bringing in a new face. ""At the moment we have no plans to bring in a medical joker, for several reasons,"" said Aulas. ""We have a good squad and players like Clement Grenier will come back. There are also players in the youth squad. And it is difficult for the morale of a player when he comes back and sees that another player has been signed and is playing in his place."" That may not please coach Hubert Fournier, whose side have a tricky trip to Russia to face Zenit St Petersburg in the Champions League next week. Lyon beat Reims 1-0 in their last outing before the international break but have not yet won back-to-back games this season, although Monaco are still looking for their first win at home in the league this season. And the principality side's coach Leonardo Jardim has a host of selection problems, with defenders Andrea Raggi and Ricardo Carvalho suspended and Malian midfielder Adama Traore having been ruled out with a fractured ankle. ""I don't know yet who will be fit to play on Friday,"" admitted Jardim, whose side are 10th in the standings, a distant 10 points behind unbeaten league leaders PSG. The reigning champions will look to extend their unbeaten start to the campaign when they face Bastia in Corsica on Saturday, although they could be forgiven for having one eye on next midweek's glamour Champions League clash at home to Real Madrid. Paris, who beat bitter rivals Marseille 2-1 a fortnight ago and are five points ahead of the chasing pack, saw centre-back David Luiz injure his left knee playing for Brazil in a World Cup qualifier against Chile last week, although they are hopeful he will be back in time to face Madrid. In addition, Salvatore Sirigu is set to return in goal after Kevin Trapp -- who usurped the Italian in the pecking order after arriving from Eintracht Frankfurt in the summer -- suffered a hamstring injury in training last week. Paris lost 4-2 in Bastia last season, but the Corsicans are not in great shape coming into this match, having lost five of their last six games. Angers, who were promoted last season, sit surprisingly in second place at the moment and visit struggling Toulouse on Saturday, while Caen in third go to Reims. Saint-Etienne had been in second place before losing their last two games so will be looking to bounce back at home to bottom side Gazelec Ajaccio.

241,04/10/2015,19:28,"Monaco held by Rennes, Caen beat Saint-Etienne","Monaco's stuttering early-season form continued as they were held to a 1-1 draw at home to Rennes in Ligue 1 on Sunday, while Caen rose to third after beating Saint-Etienne.","Rennes, whose terrific start has somewhat subsided after a fourth draw in a row, took a first-half lead at the Stade Louis II through Abdoulaye Doucoure. But Monaco fought back after the break with Brazilian Wallace scoring his first goal in the French top flight to salvage a point for Leonardo Jardim's men, who also had Danijel Subasic to thank for a second-half penalty save. The principality side have now won just three of nine matches to start the campaign and sit tenth in the table, seven points behind Paris Saint-Germain ahead of their clash with bitter rivals Marseille later. Rennes broke the deadlock four minutes before the break when Monaco were caught short at the back as Doucoure slipped in between Andrea Raggi and Thomas Lemar to head past Subasic. Monaco responded six minutes into the second half as Nabil Dirar flicked on a Lemar corner with Wallace applying the finishing touch. Rennes should have regained the lead on 64 minutes after Fabinho brought down Cheikh M'Bengue in the area but Pedro Henrique saw his spot-kick kept out by Subasic. Rennes also suffered the loss of winger Paul-Georges Ntep, who was stretchered off with a hamstring injury midway through the second half - probably ruling him out of international duty with France next week. Elsewhere, Caen registered a fourth win in five as Andy Delort's 62nd-minute goal was enough to give them all three points against Saint-Etienne as Les Verts slumped to a second successive defeat, having entered the weekend in second. The result left Patrice Garande's men level with promoted Angers, just two points behind three-time reigning champions PSG. Lorient rallied from a goal down to beat Bordeaux 3-2 with Benjamin Moukandjo, Majeed Waris and Zargo Toure all on target for the hosts after Diego Rolan had given Willy Sagnol's men a first-half lead. Both teams finished with 10 men as Lorient's Lamine Gassama and Bordeaux's Andre Biyogo Poko were dismissed near the end before Adam Ounas pulled one back for the visitors."
242,01/09/2015,13:15,All eyes on Man Utd as deadline day dawns,"Manchester United were the centre of attention as the Premier League's transfer deadline day dawned on Tuesday, with moves involving David de Gea and Anthony Martial awaiting completion.","Goalkeeper De Gea had appeared on the brink of a move to Real Madrid worth between 30 million ($33.8 million) and 40 million euros and involving Keylor Navas in part-exchange, only for the deal to collapse at the last minute. A Spanish Professional League (LFP) spokesperson told AFP that De Gea had not been registered as a Madrid player, as sources close to both clubs reportedly blamed each other for the deal breaking down late on Monday. Having pinpointed De Gea as a transfer target since the beginning of the transfer window, Madrid may now elect to appeal to world governing body FIFA to ratify the transfer. Meanwhile, United are expected to confirm a staggering deal for 19-year-old Monaco striker Anthony Martial, who left France's training camp on Monday in order to sign a contract at Old Trafford. With United struggling for goals, they have elected to take a gamble on the talented but inexperienced Martial, who has played only 52 Ligue 1 games for Monaco, scoring 11 goals. British media reports said that United would pay around £36 million ($55.2 million, 49 million euros) for the uncapped former Lyon youngster, which would make him the most expensive teenager in the game's history. But reports in France claimed the fee could eventually reach the dizzying sum of 80 million euros, on a par with what Madrid paid Monaco for Colombia star James Rodriguez a year ago. Financial consultants Deloitte said that gross Premier League spending in the close-season window had already reached £790 million, just £45 million short of the record for a single window of £835 million, set last year. ""Last year we saw £85 million of spending on deadline day and with further business expected over the coming hours, it looks set to be another record summer of spending for the Premier League,"" said Alex Thorpe from Deloitte's Sports Business Group. ""This level of spending continues to be driven in large part by the increases in domestic and overseas broadcast revenue in recent years."" In early deadline-day business, Everton announced the signing of Argentine centre-back Ramiro Funes Mori from River Plate on a five-year contract for a fee of £9.5 million. Having been rebuffed three times in their pursuit of Everton defender John Stones, Chelsea signed Senegal centre-back Papy Djilobodji from Nantes on a four-year deal, the French club announced. Meanwhile, West Ham United have brought in Alex Song and Victor Moses on loan, from Barcelona and Chelsea respectively, and signed Croatian striker Nikica Jelavic from Hull City on a two-year deal."

That would represent a remarkable sum for a player who cost Monaco around five million euros from Lyon in the summer of 2013, and OL president Jean-Michel Aulas said his club stand to make around 10 million euros as part of a sell-on clause agreed when that transfer went through. The 19-year-old striker was given a full international call-up for the first time by Deschamps for France's friendly games against Portugal in Lisbon on Friday and Serbia in Bordeaux on Monday. A statement on the French Football Federation website read: ""Anthony Martial requested permission from Didier Deschamps to travel to England to sign a contract with Manchester United. ""Given the exceptional circumstances, the coach has agreed to the request of the player."" Martial is due to return to the French training base at Clairefontaine, south of Paris, on Tuesday morning, by which time he could be a United player. Should the transfer fee be as high as has been suggested, the deal could rival the 75 million euros Real Madrid paid Juventus for Martial's fellow Frenchman Zinedine Zidane back in 2001, although by then the midfield icon had already won both the World Cup and the European Championship. Deschamps conceded the sums being spent on sometimes unproven players were, in the public's eyes, totally out of proportion, but added that such investments could be worthwhile in the long term. ""Transfers are not gambles, they are investments,"" said Deschamps, who coached Monaco to the 2004 Champions League final. ""When Monaco bought Martial for five million euros everyone asked why. ""And now he is worth how much? Clubs, managers, coaches see a player, think that he has potential and the ability to progress that will increase his value. In the eyes of public opinion, these are very high sums of money. ""If one exits the football sphere, yes the money is out of all proportion, but seeing the means at the disposal of clubs like Manchester, that doesn't pose a problem. ""The French clubs are largely sellers, it is all about economic power."" United manager Louis van Gaal has been tracking Martial for some time and made his move after Monaco failed to qualify for the Champions League group stage, losing in a play-off to Valencia last week. Martial had only signed a new contract through to 2019 with Monaco in June, prompting the club's vice-president Vadim Vasilyev to declare the forward as ""untransferable"". ""He was being contacted by some of Europe's biggest clubs but we wanted to make sure that he continues his development with AS Monaco. What Anthony has been able to achieve at just 19 years of age is impressive, to say the least, but the best is yet to come,"" Vasilyev said. But United's willingness to pay such a large fee appears to have persuaded Monaco to change their minds. After missing out on Barcelona's Spain winger Pedro Rodriguez, who snubbed United to join Chelsea recently, van Gaal has set his sights on Martial. And armed with bundles of cash from the lucrative Premier League broadcast deals, United are able to take a gamble on a player whose potential is yet to be fulfilled. Martial netted nine goals in Ligue 1 for Monaco last season, and has 11 in total, while he also showed a glimpse of his talent in the club's Champions League last-16 win against Arsenal in the spring. Since then, Monaco have already sold Yannick Ferreira Carrasco, Geoffrey Kondogbia, Layvin Kurzawa, Lucas Ocampos and Aymen Abdennour this summer for around 120 million euros. Leaving United on Monday were Mexico striker Javier Hernandez, who has joined Bundesliga side Bayer Leverkusen on a four-year deal, and Belgian winger Adnan Januzaj, who has moved to Borussia Dortmund on loan."

248,27/08/2015,12:52,PSG face suffering Monaco as Marseille look to build,Defending champions Paris Saint-Germain face their stiffest challenge of the early season away to Monaco in Ligue 1 on Sunday while Marseille will seek to continue their revival under new coach Michel at Guingamp on Friday.,"Laurent Blanc's treble winners PSG have yet to put a foot wrong on the way to a trio of victories that sees them two points clear of an unusual threesome of followers that includes Bastia, promoted Angers and former French champions Nantes. Monaco meanwhile must overcome a Champions League hangover after being knocked out of the competition at the last qualifying stage on Wednesday by Valencia, despite reaching the quarter-finals last season. Marseille began life without Marcelo Bielsa, who dropped a bombshell by resigning after an opening day defeat against Caen, by showing signs of an immediate resurrection under Madrid-born Michel when they destroyed Troyes 6-0 last weekend. The hugely popular south-coast club will try to make it two wins from two when they head up to Brittany and a Friday evening date with Guingamp. But they will still have to do without former France international Abou Diaby, whom they signed from Arsenal, who is not yet match-fit. ""I have spoken with him and he is full of motivation,"" said Michel. ""I think in two or three weeks he will be ready to reintegrate into the squad,"" added the 52-year-old former Spain international. PSG will know their Champions League group phase opponents on Thursday when the draw is made in Switzerland and the top prize in European football remains a prime goal for the Qatari-backed capital side. ""To win the Champions League is our objective,"" confided Brazilian defender David Luiz. ""It will not only depend on our preparation but also the luck or bad luck we get with the draw,"" said the former Chelsea centre-back. Bastia will travel to Saint-Etienne on Sunday as the 'Greens' look to recover from Europa League duty at home to Moldovan outsiders Milsami on Thursday. Angers, from the northwest of France, toasted their finest hour in 1957 when they were beaten 6-3 by Toulouse in the French Cup final, but under former player Stephane Moulin they have garnered two wins and a draw from their first three top flight outings as they host Nice on Saturday. Nantes meanwhile are off to a fine start of their own and the eight-time French champions, who last lifted the title in 2001, travel to winless Bordeaux. Former French player of the year Yoann Gourcuff, who has fallen from grace following a series of injuries that marred his time at Lyon, is back in the news and on the verge of signing with Rennes. The son of current Algeria coach Christian Gourcuff is unlikely to make his debut in time to face Toulouse at home on Saturday but his signature is imminent and will be a huge boost to the two-time French Cup winners. Elsewhere, last year's runners-up Lyon travel to Caen with four points from three matches, while Reims await Lorient, Troyes are at home to 2012 champions Montpellier and Herve Renard's Lille entertain GFC Ajaccio. Fixtures (all times 1800GMT unless stated):"
249,26/08/2015,19:03,Coentrao joins Monaco as Kurzawa heads for PSG,French club Monaco confirmed on Wednesday that a loan deal has been reached with Real Madrid for Portuguese international defender Fabio Coentrao with Layvin Kurzawa moving to Paris Saint-Germain.,"Coentrao, who has been capped 50 times, has spent four seasons at Real Madrid, where he failed to make an impression, having previously played for Benfica in Portugal for four years. The 27-year-old will undergo his medical in Monaco on Thursday. PSG coach Laurent Blanc confirmed Wednesday they were signing Kurzawa from Monaco as PSG left-back Lucas Digne completed his loan move to AS Roma. ""It's a delicate case, a difficult case, concerning a former Monaco player who are one of Paris's French rivals in the title race,"" Blanc told France Bleu radio. ""Negotiations were difficult but I think we're signing a very good player, a young player with interesting potential for PSG,"" Blanc added of 22-year-old Kurzawa who has two caps for France. According to press reports, Kurzawa has agreed a five-year deal worth EUR24 million ($27m), with his arrival faciliated by the Principality side's exit from the Champions League on Tuesday, losing on aggregate to Valencia. After completing a medical, Digne, 22, signed a one-year deal with the Serie A side that will see Roma pay PSG EUR2.5 million ($2.85m) and could result in the 22-year-old making the move permanent."
250,25/08/2015,23:01,Valencia survive Monaco comeback to reach Champions League group stage,"Valencia held off Monaco in their Champions League play-off tie to qualify for the group stages, despite a 2-1 second-leg defeat at the Stade Louis II on Tuesday as they progrssed 4-3 on aggregate.","The Spanish side -- two-time runners up in the competition having lost the 2000 and 2001 finals to Real Madrid and Bayern Munich respectively -- held a 3-1 advantage from the first leg and Alvaro Negredo's early second-leg goal proved the difference against the principality club. Valencia started superbly and -- clearly buoyed by Sofiane Feghouli's late third goal in the first leg last Wednesday at the Mestalla -- took a deserved lead when Monaco defender Fabinho gave the ball away and former Manchester City striker Negredo flighted a sumptuous chip over home 'keeper Danijel Subasic from the left side of the penalty box in the fourth minute. Last season's quarter-finalists Monaco had no answer to Valencia's verve and swagger early on and Negredo should have made it two only to blaze over when unmarked in the area after another fine team move. But despite being on the backfoot, Leonardo Jardim's side levelled after 17 minutes. Australian international goalkeeper Mathew Ryan's unconvincing punch fell kindly to Andrea Raggi and the Italian full-back's superb swivel and shot flew into the bottom corner. The La Liga club were all of a sudden looking nervous with Monaco looking stronger and stronger as the first period progressed without properly testing Ryan in the visiting goal. Monaco continued to press and the Ligue 1 side -- 2004 runners-up when they lost 3-0 to Jose Mourinho's Porto -- scored a second after 75 minutes to re-ignite their hopes of progressing. Ryan could only palm a free-kick against the chest of Monaco substitute Guido Carrillo who inadvertantly teed up fellow substitute Elderson with the Nigerian international poking in from a yard out. Monaco huffed and puffed but they couldn't find the third goal which would've forced extra-time. Nuno Espirito Santo's Valencia side came through 4-3 to maintain their record of never having lost a European qualifying tie over two legs. The Spanish side are back in the group stages after a two-year absence, while Monaco fail to reach the group stages for the tenth time in 12 seasons since reaching the final in 2004."
251,19/08/2015,22:42,Valencia punish defenceless Monaco,"Goals from Rodrigo, Dani Parejo and Sofiane Feghouli handed Valencia a 3-1 advantage going into the second leg of their Champions League play-off against Monaco at the Mestalla on Wednesday.","The Spanish side got off to the perfect start when Rodrigo tapped home the opener after only four minutes, but Monaco rallied and levelled early in the second-half through Mario Pasalic. However, last season's quarter-finalists were undone by poor defending as Parejo's deflected effort and a late strike from Feghouli put Valencia in the driving seat for a return to the group stages for the first time in three years. The sides will meet again in the principality next Tuesday. Monaco were without the influential Joao Moutinho and Layvin Kurzawa through injury and Kurzawa's replacement Elderson endured a torrid time as Valencia got off to a flying start. The Nigerian allowed Feghouli in behind to head a cross from the left back across goal and that left Rodrigo with the easiest of finishes to put the hosts in front. The visitors had a great chance to strike back almost immediately in an open start to the game, but Anthony Martial failed to connect and the ball was gratefully clutched by Matthew Ryan. Valencia's speed in the wide areas was a constant danger as Feghouli just failed to pick out Paco Alcacer with another burst past Elderson before the Spanish international couldn't stretch far enough to touch home a wonderful delivery from Jose Gaya. Monaco are a much-changed side from the one which reached the last eight last season, but they grew into the game as the first-half wore on and were unfortunate not to be level at the break. Ryan enjoyed his first big moment in a Valencia shirt just after the half hour mark as the Australian international turned Bernardo Silva's drive onto the post from a narrow angle. Martial did find the net moments later, but he was flagged for offside. The French side's persistence was rewarded just four minutes into the second period when a powerful run and cross by Martial was only partially cleared and Pasalic timed his run into the box perfectly to slot home the rebound. Ryan had to be alert once more minutes later to divert another Martial effort to safety. Valencia boss Nuno Espirito Santo introduced Pablo Piatti for Rodrigo de Paul in a bid to turn the tide and the Argentine winger set up Valencia's second with virtually his first touch. Piatti turned a looping cross from the right back into the danger zone and Parejo's deflected effort left Danijel Subasic helpless. Valencia were coping well with the relentless tempo of the game given it was their first competitive match of the season and Parejo could have doubled his tally at the end of a flowing counter-attack, but he fired Feghouli's cross into the stands. The Algerian international made no such mistake four minutes from time, though, when he slammed a loose ball home from just inside the area."
252,18/08/2015,13:23,Monaco more important than Otamendi for Valencia boss,Valencia coach Nuno Espirito Santo insists his side cannot be distracted by the imminent departure of Nicolas Otamendi as they prepare for the first leg of their Champions League playoff against Monaco on Wednesday.,"The Argentine centre-back was Los Che's player of the year last season as they moved to the brink of a return to the Champions League after a three-year absence. However, reports in Spain suggest the 27-year-old is on the verge of a move to Manchester City. ""The most important thing is the game tomorrow,"" said Nuno at his pre-match press conference on Tuesday. ""We have known for some time that we are going to prepare for this game without the option of Otamendi, but the important thing is that we are going to play a fundamental match for us."" A meeting with last season's quarter-finalists was the most difficult tie on offer to Valencia as a seeded side as they hope to make it a record five Spanish teams into the group stages. And Nuno believes it is the most evenly balanced of the qualifiers to be played this week. ""Clearly it is the most balanced playoff. We are two teams with a clear intention of qualifying taking into account the quality of our squads."" Monaco, though, are also hampered by the absence of key players with the influential trio of Joao Moutinho, Layvin Kurzawa and Aymen Abdennour missing out through injury. ""Monaco are a very good team with a lot of variety and players of great quality,"" added Nuno. ""We know that they won't be at full strength, but we can't think that is going to make it easier."""
253,14/08/2015,22:29,Monaco top despite dull draw at home to Lille,Monaco took a brief hold on top spot in the French league after just two games despite being held to a drab goalless draw at home by Lille on Friday night.,"But their stay is unlikely to last 24 hours as Saturday night's fixtures seem sure to see them overhauled. An error-ridden match yielded few chances, although Monaco had the visitors pegged back in their own for virtually the first half-hour but were unable to capitalise on some swift running down the left by Portuguese winger Ivan Cavaleiro. In the end it was Lille who finished the stronger but neither side ever seriously threatened to break the deadlock. Having allowed a few early careless tackles to pass unpunished, referee Benoit Millot had no hesitation in reaching into his pocket for the first yellow card of the evening 24 minutes in after Lille defender Sebastien Corchia went in late on Cavaleiro with a crude challenge. Corchia's interest in the game ended shortly afterwards, however, when he was involved in a clash of heads with Cavaleiro as they both went up for a cross in the area and he was laid out before being hauled off and taken to hospital as a precaution. Monaco should probably have taken the lead a minute before the interval when Joao Moutinho struck a perfect free kick which Lille's Nigerian international goalkeeper Vincent Enyeama scrambled behind for a corner after Argentina defender Renato Civelli had got himself booked for a late challenge on Jeremy Toulalan. Lille's first real chance came just after the restart when Baptiste Guillaume slipped in behind the home defence and clipped a Sofiane Boufal pass straight at goalkeeper Danijel Subasic. The 'keeper had to be at his sharpest again two minutes later to clear a second Guillaume shot with his feet after he was put through again by the lively Boufal down the left. Former Monaco midfielder Mounir Obbadi appeared to receive his marching orders for a foul on Fabinho with a quarter of an hour left, but the referee changed his mind after consulting the linesman and booked Boufal instead. From the resulting free kick, Ricardo Cavalho rose smartly to flick on a header which Eyneama had to be at full stretch to save."
254,13/08/2015,17:45,Silva predicts bright season for Monaco,Monaco will look to kick on from their opening-day win at Nice when they host Lille in their first home game of the Ligue 1 season on Friday.,"The game has been brought forward to help Monaco prepare for their Champions League play-off first leg away to Valencia in Spain next Wednesday as the principality side bid to return to the group stage for the second season running. Leonardo Jardim's men recovered from a 1-0 half-time deficit to win 2-1 at the Allianz Riviera last weekend thanks to goals from Bernardo Silva and Layvin Kurzawa, and will be in confident mood against a Lille side who lost at home to champions Paris Saint-Germain in their opener. Monaco finished third last season and Silva, the young starlet who initially joined on loan from Benfica last summer before making the move permanent in January, believes they are ""capable of a better season than last year"". The Portugal international midfielder, who cost 15.75 million euros (£11.25m; $17.6m), scored nine goals in 32 league games last term but he now sees an opportunity to kick on after extending his contract by a year to 2020. ""When I arrived last season, I did not know how it would happen. Now I think I have a certain status at the club. It happened very quickly for me,"" said Silva. ""I am happy but I want to continue to progress and grow. ""I'm glad I helped the team against Nice,"" added Silva, who will hope to start after coming off the bench in the first half last weekend to spark their recovery. Lille -- now under the guidance of former Ivory Coast coach Herve Renard -- put in a spirited display in defeat at home to PSG. The northern club travel to the Mediterranean looking for their first win at the Stade Louis II since 2009 when they triumphed 4-0. But Lille will be encouraged by Monaco's inconsistent home form last season which yielded just eight wins from their 19 home matches, although they lost just twice. Monaco's latest new signing, Brazil under-20 midfielder Gabriel Boschilia, will not play against Lille after his seven million-euro ($7.8m, £5m) arrival from Sao Paulo on Monday. ""He needs time to understand the game, the philosophy of work,"" said Monaco coach Jardim. Lille, who finished a disappointing eighth last season, have problems in defence with Marko Basa, Ibrahim Amadou and Stoppila Sunzu all missing."
255,10/08/2015,19:24,"Midfield duo Silva, Boschilia pen Monaco deals","Portuguese international midfielder Bernardo Silva and Brazilian midfielder Gabriel Boschilia have penned deals with Monaco until 2020, the Ligue 1 club announced on Monday.","Silva extended his current deal by one season after being loaned by Portuguese side Benfica with an option to buy for 15 million euros ($16.5 million, £10.6 million) last season. And after a good season with ten goals scored in 45 games and four decisive passes in 2014-2015 for Monaco, Silva signed a one-year extension to his contract with the side that finished third last season. Boschilia, 19, passed his medical on Monday after arriving from Sao Paulo in the Brazilian league and signed for five seasons for a reported nine million euros ."
256,31/07/2015,17:31,"Monaco sign Saint-Maximin, loan him to Hanover","Champions League hopefuls Monaco have made their latest summer signing, recruiting promising Saint-Etienne youngster Allan Saint-Maximin before sending him on loan to German club Hanover 96.","The 18-year-old attacking midfielder has signed a five-year deal in the principality but will spend the 2015-16 campaign in the Bundesliga. Saint-Maximin, who made nine Ligue 1 appearances for Saint-Etienne last season, is the latest in a long line of highly talented young players to have joined Monaco in the close season. They have already brought in the likes of Portuguese winger Ivan Cavaleiro from Benfica, the Malian Adama Traore from Lille, Fares Bahlouli from Lyon and signed Croatian midfielder Mario Pasalic on loan from Chelsea. Those moves have helped strengthen a squad that has seen Geoffrey Kondogbia and Yannick Ferreira Carrasco depart for Inter Milan and Atletico Madrid respectively in big-money moves. Monaco won 3-1 away to Swiss side Young Boys on Tuesday in the first leg of their Champions League third qualifying round tie."
257,28/07/2015,23:07,Monaco show mature heads against Young Boys,Layvin Kurzawa starred as last season's Champions League quarter-finalists Monaco took a big step towards the play-off round of this season's Champions League on Tuesday with a 3-1 win away at Swiss side Young Boys in their third qualifying round first leg clash.,"The 22-year-old French defender blocked a goalbound effort by Japanese striker Yuya Kubo on the line in the 62nd minute and then two minutes later scored at the other end with a sublime volley, from Fabinho's cross, to set Monaco on their way. This sparked a crazy flurry where the three other goals came in the next 11 minutes. They doubled their lead through Argentinian Guido Carillo, who had come on only a minute before for another new recruit 21-year-old Portuguese forward Ivan Cavaleiro, as he headed home from playmaker Joao Moutinho's 72nd minute freekick. Young Boys -- whose former PSG striker Guillaume Hoarau should have done better with two free headers -- briefly got back into the match as veteran midfielder Raphael Nuzolo reduced the deficit with 16 minutes remaining. However, their hopes were extinguished within a minute as Croatian Mario Pasalic, on loan from English champions Chelsea, scored with a fierce strike from the edge of the penalty area. While the second leg should be a formality for Monaco a tougher task lies ahead with the likes of Manchester United and Valencia potential opponents in the final qualifying round which leads for the winners to the lucrative group stage. However, coach Leonardo Jardim will have taken heart how his much changed line-up from last season -- veteran Dimitar Berbatov, and younger stars such as Geoffrey Kondogbia and Belgian international winger Yannick Ferreira Carrasco having left -- coped with a relatively challenging away clash. Elsewhere another side who radically changed their squad during the close season Fenerbahce fared less well as they were held 0-0 at home in Istanbul by Ukrainian outfit Shakhtar Donetsk, who are no strangers to the group stages. Despite fielding several of their big name signings such as Portuguese winger Nani the Turkish side were unable to unlock the Ukrainian defence. Dutch striker Robin van Persie -- signed amidst much fanfare earlier this month from Manchester United -- came on for the last 20 odd minutes replacing Moussa Sow but contributed little. Fenerbahce, who have returned to European competition after serving a two year ban for their involvement in match-fixing, will have it all to do next week in the second leg to keep alive their hopes of a return to the group stage of the Champions League for the first time since the 2008-09 season. Action continues on Wednesday with the highlight Scottish champions Celtic -- who failed to make the group stages last season -- at home to Azerbaijan side Qarabag."
258,27/07/2015,17:56,"Fener hope for Van Persie effect, Monaco begin campaign","The marquee signing of Robin van Persie has underlined Fenerbahce's determination to compete with the best in Europe again, but they face a tough task just to make it beyond the Champions League third qualifying round.","The Istanbul giants host Ukrainian side Shakhtar Donetsk in the first leg at the Sukru Saracoglu stadium on Tuesday as they return to European competition having served a two-year ban for their involvement in match-fixing. Fener are looking to return to the group stage of the Champions League for the first time since the 2008-09 season and have splashed the cash in an attempt to make their mark abroad and at home, where they will bid to wrestle the title back from bitter rivals Galatasaray. Portuguese former Porto coach Vitor Pereira has been brought in to oversee a squad that will include Van Persie and Nani -- both signed from Manchester United for a total of 10.7 million euros (£7.6m, $11.9m). Denmark defender Simon Kjaer, from Lille, and Brazil midfielder Souza, from Sao Paulo, have also come in and last season's leading scorer Moussa Sow remains. However, Van Persie has only just begun pre-season training so he may have to wait to make an impact. In contrast, Shakhtar, Champions League regulars these days, will benefit from already being two games into their domestic league season. Mircea Lucescu's side have sold some of their biggest names, with Brazilian duo Douglas Costa and Luiz Adriano going to Bayern Munich and AC Milan respectively for a combined 38 million euros. However, their squad still contains a strong Brazilian influence, including the in-form Alex Teixeira and the midfielder Marlos. ""We have prepared for this match and the start of the Champions League. The Ukrainian championship has already kicked off, we have played two matches - that's a plus for us. I think the team are strong enough to win,"" Marlos told Shakhtar's website. Last season's quarter-finalists Monaco will go to Bern for the first leg of their tie against Swiss side Young Boys, with coach Leonardo Jardim hoping that his many new recruits settle quickly. The principality club have sold two of their outstanding performers from last season in midfielder Geoffrey Kondogbia and winger Yannick Ferreira Carrasco. However, seven new signings feature in the squad that has travelled to the Swiss capital, including AC Milan loanee Stephan El Shaarawy. Scottish champions Celtic entertain Qarabag of Azerbaijan in Glasgow on Wednesday hoping for a positive result before they face the marathon trip to Baku next week. Qarabag may be an unknown quantity to most but they held Inter Milan and Saint-Etienne in the Europa League last season and also beat eventual runners-up Dnipro. ""It's a big, big step up. We're talking about a very good football team here who has done very well in the Europa League,"" Celtic manager Ronny Deila said last week after Celtic beat Stjarnan of Iceland in the second qualifying round. ""To play at Celtic Park against 60,000 fans is the worst thing you can do as an opponent. We have to use everything we have to make a good result in the first leg."""

265,03/07/2015,16:40,Defender Wallace signs new season-long loan at Monaco,"French side Monaco have extended the loan of Brazilian central defender Wallace by a further season from his parent club Sporting Braga, it was announced on Friday.","The 20-year-old has signed on again after making 22 appearances (four in the Champions League) for the Ligue 1 outfit while on loan in the 2014/15 campaign. Wallace, who has represented Brazil at under-20 and under-21 level, hopes to play at the 2016 Rio Olympics. The defender began training with Monaco, who finished third in France last season, at the start of this week ahead of the club's mini tour of Lubin, Poland. Monaco have selected a 25-man squad for the friendly tournament in Poland where they'll take on German Bundesliga side Hannover, Ukrainian heavyweights Shakhtar Donetsk and hosts Slask Wroclaw."
266,03/07/2015,15:52,Falcao gets fresh start at Chelsea,Colombian international striker Radamel Falcao said Friday he is raring to go at Chelsea after signing a one-year loan deal with the English Premier League champions.,"The 29-year-old came out of a disastrous one year loan at Manchester United and is looking forward to plying his trade under Jose Mourinho for the forthcoming season. ""I am very happy to be joining Chelsea and can't wait to start training and help with our aim of retaining the league title and being successful in Europe,"" he told the club's website. French side Monaco, who own his contract, confirmed that a deal had been made with Chelsea and the London side have a ""buy option"" for Falcao. Falcao endured a frustrating spell at Manchester United last season, managing just four goals for the Old Trafford side. He also failed to score for Colombia as they reached the Copa America quarter-finals. United had an option to purchase the former Atletico Madrid and Porto hitman at the end of his year-long stay but decided against a permanent deal. The Colombian suffered a serious knee injury which ruled him out of the 2014 World Cup and has since struggled to rediscover the form, which saw him revered as one of the world's top strikers. Mourinho said last month he wanted to revive the forward's career, saying: ""It hurts me that people in England think that the real Falcao is the one we saw at Manchester United."" The striker's first European club was Portuguese side Porto, where Mourinho made his reputation as a coach. Chelsea had a striker vacancy after Ivory Coast veteran Didier Drogba left at the end of the season. Falcao made his Champions League debut against Chelsea and also scored a hat-trick against the Blues in the European Super Cup during a spell with Atletico Madrid. He then moved to Monaco but was less successful in France where he suffered the knee injury that caused his World Cup heartbreak. After his United flop, Mourinho will hope Falcao can rediscover his goal-scoring touch at Stamford Bridge and bolster an attack already featuring Diego Costa and Eden Hazard. Falcao is set to join his new team-mates on Chelsea's pre-season tour of the United States, ahead of a possible return to Old Trafford on December 28."

Bahlouli has made just nine top-flight appearances for Lyon but was part of the France under-20 side that won the recent Toulon Tournament."
269,22/06/2015,20:32,Kondogbia completes Inter switch,"French international Geoffrey Kondogbia has completed his ""dream"" move from Monaco to Inter Milan, signing a five-year deal with the Serie A club after snubbing city rivals AC Milan at the 11th hour.","""Being a part of this great team is a dream come true. I want to be here for as long as possible,"" Kondogbia told fans after completing his medical on Monday. ""As a kid I used to watch Inter play on TV, and now I'm joining this huge club. I will give my all."" The 22-year-old Frenchman, who spent two seasons at Monaco after joining the Ligue 1 club from Sevilla, is expected to earn four million euros ($4.5 million) a season plus performance-related bonuses after making a last-gasp decision to snub AC Milan. Monaco are expected to receive a fee believed to be in the region of 35 million euros. Milan CEO Adriano Galliani said Sunday he believed he had tied up Kondogbia's move to the seven-time European champions on Friday afternoon. ""At 1.30 (pm) it was all done,"" Galliani told La Gazzetta dello Sport. ""Monaco had given us the green light for the transfer at EUR40m with payment spread over two years, EUR20m and EUR20m."" However Inter flew in with a late, improved offer which appeared to sway the player and his representatives. Kondogbia, who said he was convinced to move to the club by coach Roberto Mancini, is expected to earn more at Inter due to performance-related bonuses. Galliani added: ""After we exchanged the documentation, at 1.30pm everyone disappeared. Obviously they changed their minds or the others offered more."" Galliani has since suffered a backlash on social media, with angry Milan fans demanding his departure after failing to secure the services of the Frenchman, who had been courted by some of Europe's top clubs. Inter, meanwhile, are rubbing their hands at gazumping their bitter city rivals. The marauding midfielder, who has been compared to retired French international Patrick Vieira, had also been linked with a move to Manchester City, Real Madrid, and Juventus after showcasing his talents last season when Monaco reached the quarter-finals of the Champions League. Kondogbia's physical strength, cool head under pressure and technical skill should make him a welcome addition to an Inter side that featured plenty of big names last season but which simply failed to click. He said seeing fan reactions on his first day in Milan had been a ""real pleasure"". ""I noticed it right away. It's a real pleasure for me and I hope we can achieve big things together,"" added Kondogbia. ""I spoke with Mancini a week ago. What he said really convinced me -- I don't think you can say no to a club like Inter."" Inter sacked Walter Mazzarri last November and replaced him with Mancini, who had steered the club to seven trophies including three consecutive league titles in his first spell in charge in 2004-2008. But former Manchester City and Galatasaray handler Mancini failed to provide the remedy as Inter slipped to an eighth-place finish last season, a massive 32 points behind four-time consecutive champions Juventus."

Inter have yet to publish an official statement although the club's Twitter feed showed a picture of Kondogbia in a club shirt with a short message confirming his signature: ""Contracts signed with Monaco for the transfer of Geoffrey Kondogbia.""

""If I can help Falcao reach his level again, I will do it,"" Mourinho told DirecTV Sports. ""It hurts me that people in England think that the real Falcao is the one we saw at Manchester United,"" the Portuguese manager added. Falcao's first European club was Portuguese side Porto, where Mourinho himself had previously made his reputation as a coach.

272,01/06/2015,17:42,Berbatov and Stekelenburg part ways with Monaco,Ligue 1 club Monaco announced on Monday that Bulgarian striker Dimitar Berbatov and Dutch goalkeeper Maarten Stekelenburg will be leaving the club.,"Berbatov, one of his country's most prolific goalscorers and a former star with Manchester United and Tottenham, is at the end of his contract after scoring 18 goals in 53 matches for this season's Champions League quarter-finalists. Stekelenburg, who helped the Netherlands reach the 2010 World Cup final where they were finally edged by Spain, was on loan from West London club Fulham, but is now also out of contract. The 34-year-old Berbatov has been linked with several clubs including a return to the Premier League although no official announcement has been forthcoming. ""He will go down as one of the great strikers for Monaco,"" said club vice-president Vadim Vasilyev of Berbatov. ""We are proud of what he brought to the club and wish him the best for the future."" Stekelenburg, 32, also found himself surplus to demand after Croatian Danijel Subasic nailed down the number one job and the arrival of talented French youngster Paul Nardi who spent last season on loan at second division Nancy."
273,24/05/2015,22:46,"Falcao leaves Manchester, returns to Monaco","Colombia striker Radamel Falcao has returned to Monaco following his season-long loan spell at Manchester United, the English club announced on Sunday.","The 29-year-old, who joined the Reds on transfer deadline day last September, had a tough time at Old Trafford, scoring just four goals in 29 appearances. ""Falcao is a top professional and a good human being. On behalf of myself and everyone at the club I would like to wish him well for the future,"" United's coach Louis van Gaal told the club's official website. United won a hotly-contested race to sign the Colombia striker on loan from Monaco last close season, as La Liga giants Real Madrid seemed poised to attract the former Porto and Atletico Madrid forward. Manchester had the chance to sign him on a permanent basis for £43.2million, but the club have told Falcao they will not exercise that option. Falcao was even left out of United's squad for the final game of the season at Hull on Sunday through injury, according to Van Gaal. 'El Tigre', as he is known to Colombian fans, may not stay for long in the Principality as the striker has been reportedly linked with moves to Chelsea, who are looking to replace Didier Drogba, or his former club Atletico, who could lose forward Mario Mandzukic. Falcao missed last year's World Cup with a knee injury."
274,24/05/2015,11:59,Football: Monaco secure Champions League return,"Monaco, locked in a three-way tussle with Saint-Etienne and Marseille, booked the third and final French ticket to next season's Champions League thanks to a season-closing 1-0 win over Lorient on Saturday.","A first-half goal by Yannick Ferreira Carrasco was enough to help the Principality side clinch immediate return to the Champions League as they remain third in the table, two points ahead of Marseille and Saint-Etienne. The pair of former French champions sealed their place in next season's Europa League as Marseille beat Bastia 3-0 and Saint-Etienne edged Guingamp 2-1. Marseille's game was delayed for 20 minutes just before the start of the second half as fans threw objects on the pitch, leading referee Ruddy Buquet to send the players back into the locker rooms while police forces settled on the sidelines to help control the crowd. It was nonetheless an emotional game for Marseille's Andre-Pierre Gignac and Andre Ayew who both will be leaving the South of France giants during the summer. But it was standout Dimitri Payet who took the spotlight with his seventh goal of the season after just 14 minutes before a Jeremy Morel shot, deflected by Corsica youngster Alexander Djiku, flew into the net five minutes before half-time. Monaco-loanee Lucas Ocampos added a third goal to seal the deal with a deft run through the Bastia defence. Meanwhile, freshly-crowned champions Paris Saint-Germain celebrated their latest title triumph with a brace by Edinson Cavani, and a third goal from Adrien Rabiot, to overcome Reims 3-2. With the French League Cup also under their belt, PSG are still aiming for an unprecedented domestic treble as they tackle second-tier Auxerre in the final of the French Cup on May 30. A win at the Stade de France for Zlatan Ibrahimovic's teammates would mean the world for sixth-placed Bordeaux, who would then qualify for the Europa League third qualifying round. The Girondins got the party going in their new stadium as Diego Rolan, who had already scored the last goal in the old Chaban-Delmas, bagged a brace in his side's 2-1 victory against Montpellier. Elsewhere, eighth-placed Lille ended their disappointing season with a 4-1 drubbing of relegation-bound Metz while bottom-of-the-table Lens kissed Ligue 1 goodbye with a 1-0 win over Nantes as Caen eased past Evian 3-2 and Nice toyed with fire in their 3-2 away win at Toulouse. Clinton Njie struck late for Lyon as the second-placed side beat a lacklustre Rennes 1-0. The closing day saw PSG's Zoumana Camara, 36, hang up his boots alongside former Liverpool and Sunderland forward Djibril Cisse, now at Bastia."
275,22/05/2015,02:20,Monaco lead three-way Champions League chase,"Monaco can clinch an immediate return to the Champions League with a win at Lorient on Saturday, but Marseille and Saint-Etienne can pip them to the post on the final day of the season.","Paris Saint-Germain clinched the title last weekend, while Lyon were confirmed as runners- up, but third place in Ligue 1 gives access to the final Champions League qualifying round in August. Worthy but unexpected quarter-finalists in the Champions League this season, third-placed Monaco have 68 points, just two ahead of Marseille and Saint-Etienne on 66, with Marseille also enjoying a comfortable goal difference margin on the other two. Monaco have been outstanding in Ligue 1 since December, losing just twice and conceding a miserly eight goals. Their 40-year-old Portuguese coach Leonardo Jardim has forged a water-tight defence and built an industrious, youthful counter-attacking system where 20-year-old midfielder Bernardo Silva and 19-year-old striker Anthony Martial are showing there is life after Falcao and James Rodriguez. ""We don't need to worry about anyone else, and we won't be listening to the other games"" said Jardim, who agreed a contract extension until 2019 last week. ""We just need to win our match, because Marseille and Saint Etienne are going to win theirs,"" said Jardim, who will be satisfied Lorient secured their top-flight status last week. Croatian 'keeper Danijel Subasic said the mood in the dressing room was relaxed and confident. ""I don't know if the other teams will win, but I hope not. Our game is like a final, it opens the doors to the Champions League,"" said Subasic, who has 19 clean shhets in Ligue 1 this season. Long-time leaders Marseille watched their title aspirations evaporate after Christmas and gradually the team led by intense Argentine coach Marcello Bielsa saw a run of poor luck allow their Champions League ambitions slip from their grasp too. But a 2-1 come-from-behind win over Monaco two weeks ago and a resounding 4-0 win over Lille last time out has given the southern giants one last roll of the dice. They host mid-table Bastia on Saturday with arguably two of their top forwards playing their last game for a club who are trying to get rid of their top paid players. The two concerned are Andre-Pierre Gignac, France's second-top scorer who propelled their early season charge, and Ghana's Andre Ayew who will be out of contract and on their way. ""I was expecting better,"" said the 25-year-old Ghana star Ayew. ""I wanted the team to be more competitive next year so we could challenge for the title."" ""Also the club cannot offer me the same salary that I'm on at the moment,"" added Ayew, son of former Ghana and Marseille legend Abedi Pele. Saint-Etienne have their own internal squabbles to deal with as they go into their match at home against Guingamp. Player-of-the season Max-Alain Gradel said this week the club lacked ambition, sending a shockwave from the top to bottom. ""It's not a lack of ambition that stops us rivalling PSG, just a lack of means,"" replied Christophe Galtier. His club have bought their training ground, rebuilt their stadium, bought back their club shop and opened a club museum over the past four years whilst coming in the top-five each time. Gradel was referring to the sale of Kurt Zouma to Chelsea, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang to Borussia Dortmund and Blaise Matuidi to PSG over the same period. But others remained focussed on the final game. ""We're not booking holidays yet in case we get the third spot, in which case we'll spend the summer getting ready,"" insisted 'keeper Stephane Ruffier, their joint player of the season."

""We have worked hard this season to put in place a new project and I am convinced that the best is to come.

""With his staff, he has done a remarkable job this season, obtaining very good results in Ligue 1 and in the Champions League.""

278,08/05/2015,19:29,"Italian giants, Monaco reach Financial Fair Play agreements","UEFA on Friday reached agreement with 10 clubs in relation to their Financial Fair Play (FFP) rules, with Italian giants Inter Milan and Roma, as well as Monaco, among those accepting fines.","Among a variety of measures, Inter agreed to pay a fine of up to 20 million euros (£14.5m, $22.4m), which will come out of their revenues from playing in this season's Europa League. In addition, the Serie A side agreed ""to report a maximum break-even deficit of 30 million euros for the financial year ending in 2016 and no break-even deficit for the financial year ending in 2017."" Similarly, Roma must pay a fine of up to six million euros and must not report combined losses of more than 30 million euros for this year and next year combined. ""The agreement was necessary due to a historical deviation from UEFA's break-even requirement stemming from past economic losses and the challenging financial situation of the club before the current ownership's takeover,"" Roma said in a statement. Monaco, who have gone from the French second division to the Champions League quarter-finals in just two years thanks to the financial backing of their Russian billionaire owner Dimitri Rybolovlev, were also penalised. The side from the Mediterranean principality must pay a fine of up to 13 million euros, with three million euros to be paid in full and the remainder conditional on their compliance with a raft of measures, including the requirement to reach break-even by 2017. They will also be limited to a 22-man squad, rather than the usual permitted limit of 25, should they qualify for European competition next season. Turkish giants Besiktas, Sporting Lisbon and Russian sides FC Krasnodar and Lokomotiv Moscow also reached agreements with UEFA, along with CSKA Sofia, Kardemir Karabukspor of Turkey and FC Rostov of Russia. UEFA's FFP rules are aimed at preventing clubs from spending more money than they earn and led to both Manchester City and Paris Saint-Germain being heavily penalised last year."
279,03/05/2015,19:35,Monaco set for Champions League return,Monaco's Portuguese duo Bernard Silva and Joao Moutinho set up a 4-1 hammering of Toulouse on Sunday that took their team five points clear of their closest pursuers for Ligue 1's third and final Champions League spot.,"Silva scored a brilliant goal in the first half and Moutinho struck in the second as Monaco surged ahead of Olympic Marseille in the league race, led by Lyon and Paris Saint Germain. Monaco grabbed an early lead with a fine piece of trickery from 20-year-old Silva, who took a quick corner and exchanged a one-two before running to the edge of the box to fire home in the ninth minute. Toulouse deservedly equalised thanks to a flying break finished in style by Danish striker Martin Braithwaite on the 26th minute. Monaco's 19-year-old striker Anthony Martial converted from the penalty spot with the last kick of the first half after he had been brought down in the box. A neat header on the six-yard line from in form Moutinho made it 3-1 just before the hour. Both sides had a man sent off in the 79th when a shoving match got out of hand and the referee gave straight reds to Monaco's Nabil Dirar and Toulouse's Jean Armel Kana-Biyik. Moutinho struck again with a late killer through ball, which set up a fourth goal from Valere Germain in time added on. Marseille had looked the best for a Champions League place, having led Ligue 1 at Christmas. But a classy Monaco run has seen a 15 point turnaround between the two clubs. Monaco are now on 65, with Marseille and Saint Etienne on 60. Monaco had a great run in the Champions League this season only getting knocked-out 1-0 on aggregate in a close run affair with Juventus. Third place in France offers a place in the third qualifying round for next season and all the aces now seem to be firmly in Monaco's hands."
280,26/04/2015,20:16,Monaco take big step towards Champions League,Monaco moved a step closer to a return to the Champions League on Sunday with a comfortable 3-0 win away to a Lens side who are now all but relegated.,"Yannick Ferreira Carrasco, Anthony Martial and Bernardo Silva got the goals for the Principality club at a rain-soaked Stade de la Licorne in Amiens as Monaco reclaimed the third place that had briefly been taken from them earlier in the day by Saint-Etienne. Leonardo Jardim's side, who were eliminated from the Champions League at the quarter-final stage by Juventus on Wednesday, have been outstanding in Ligue 1 since December, losing just once and conceding a miserly five goals. This result leaves them two points clear of fourth-placed Saint-Etienne and five ahead of Marseille in fifth in the race to secure third spot, which carries with it a place in the third qualifying round of next season's Champions League. But it also keeps alive their chances of finishing in the top two and qualifying directly for the group stage of Europe's elite club competition, with the gap to second-placed Lyon three points before OL visit Reims on Sunday evening. ""Our objective for the season is the podium,"" said Jardim. ""This victory was important for us to maintain our position."" ""I think we didn't play very well in the first 20 minutes but after that we controlled the match. The players are in good condition despite having played 50 matches this season."" A Carrasco free-kick, intended as a cross, hit the woodwork before the Belgian opened the scoring nine minutes before the break after taking advantage of a lucky ricochet off Lens defender Abdoul Ba. France under-21 striker Martial then increased the lead a minute before the interval, running through to score after the Lens defence was undone by a long ball forward by Carrasco. It was Martial's eighth league goal of the season, and his seventh in his last eight games. The visitors then made sure of the points with 18 minutes left when Portuguese dynamo Silva converted a Geoffrey Kondogbia cutback from close range for his fourth goal in three games. Lens, who have won just once in 2015, remain rooted to the foot of the table and are now 12 points adrift of safety with only 12 points left to play for. Earlier, Saint-Etienne moved above Marseille into the top four as they extended their unbeaten run to nine league games with a 1-0 defeat of Montpellier at the Stade Geoffroy-Guichard. The in-form Max-Alain Gradel scored the only goal of the game in the first half for his eighth in eight league appearances since helping the Ivory Coast win the Africa Cup of Nations in February. Lyon travel to Champagne country later to face struggling Reims knowing a win will move them back to the top of the table on goal difference from Paris Saint-Germain, albeit having played a game more. PSG bounced back from their Champions League exit to Barcelona by beating 10-man Lille 6-1 at the Parc des Princes on Saturday with Ezequiel Lavezzi scoring a hat-trick and Edinson Cavani netting twice after Maxwell had got the opener with just 25 seconds on the clock. Marseille's hopes of qualifying for Europe suffered a blow as they collapsed to a 5-3 defeat at home to Lorient on Friday, the loss their fourth in succession. There were also wins for Rennes, Guingamp and Evian on Saturday."

But they have not got beyond the last eight since, failing to translate their domestic dominance to the European stage. Nevertheless, while they close in on a fourth consecutive Serie A crown, they are now primed to secure a spot in the semi-finals in Europe after Arturo Vidal's penalty gave them a 1-0 victory against the Principality club last Tuesday. Crucially, Juventus did not concede an away goal in that game, meaning Monaco will now be obliged to come out and attack at home, something which is not their forte. Monaco coach Leonardo Jardim has admitted his team are better suited to playing away from home, when they can hit teams on the break, as they did so devastatingly in London in the last 16 when they defeated Arsenal 3-1, that result allowing them to progress on away goals despite losing 2-0 at home. ""I was not surprised by Monaco because we didn't underestimate them, but they played really well against us,"" Juve's veteran French international left-back Patrice Evra told Canal Plus. ""I think the second leg will be different and Juventus will have a greater control of the match. ""I was really proud of Monaco when they beat Arsenal because I saw them playing without fear. Some of the Monaco players say that they are better away from home because the stadiums and the atmosphere are different."" Evra knows that as well as anybody, having spent four years in the Mediterranean Principality, helping Monaco reach the Champions League final in 2004 before eventually moving on to Manchester United. Monaco are third in Ligue 1 and have lost just one of their last 18 league games, but too many draws at the Stade Louis II, where the lack of atmosphere and crowds that rarely reach the 10,000 mark remove any sense of a home advantage, have held them back. That was the case on Saturday, when they managed just one shot on target, and that only after a defensive error, in a disappointing 1-1 draw with Rennes. Injuries and tiredness persuaded Jardim to rotate his squad in that game, a decision which did not pay dividends. ""I rested three or four players but the others were injured. Some of those who played in Turin were not 100 percent. But the Champions League game will be different. The stadium will be full,"" insisted the Portuguese coach. The question remains as to whether they can score the goals needed to go through. After all, Monaco have netted just three times in four Champions League home games this season. At least they can call on one of the tightest defences in Europe, although in midfield it remains to be seen whether captain Jeremy Toulalan (hamstring) and the powerful Geoffrey Kondogbia (ankle) will recover from injury in time to feature. Further forward, Jardim must decide whether to select the experienced Dimitar Berbatov or the exciting Anthony Martial in attack, or go with both. Allegri, meanwhile, is expected to stick with the 3-5-2 formation that helped Juventus beat Lazio 2-0 in Serie A at the weekend. Paul Pogba is still out injured but Andrea Pirlo will play in central midfield after returning from a five-week injury lay-off in time for the first leg, and playing 70 minutes against Lazio. ""I haven't decided which formation I will use. If the team defends well, I think it doesn't really matter if we have three or four at the back,"" Allegri said. ""I'm happy about the success the team is enjoying. The lads deserve praise because they've shown a lot of maturity."""

Monaco are third in Ligue 1 and have lost just one of their last 18 league games, but too many draws at the Stade Louis II, where the lack of atmosphere and crowds that rarely reach the 10,000 mark remove any sense of a home advantage, have held them back. That was the case on Saturday, when they managed just one shot on target, and that only after a defensive error, in a disappointing 1-1 draw with Rennes. Injuries and tiredness persuaded Jardim to rotate his squad in that game, a decision which did not pay dividends. ""I rested three or four players but the others were injured. Some of those who played in Turin were not 100 percent. But the Champions League game will be different. The stadium will be full,"" insisted the Portuguese coach. The question remains as to whether they can score the goals needed to go through. After all, Monaco have netted just three times in four Champions League home games this season. At least they can call on one of the tightest defences in Europe, although in midfield it remains to be seen whether captain Jeremy Toulalan (hamstring) and the powerful Geoffrey Kondogbia (ankle) will recover from injury in time to feature. Further forward, Jardim must decide whether to select the experienced Dimitar Berbatov or the exciting Anthony Martial in attack, or go with both. Allegri, meanwhile, is expected to stick with the 3-5-2 formation that helped Juventus beat Lazio 2-0 in Serie A at the weekend. Paul Pogba is still out injured but Andrea Pirlo will play in central midfield after returning from a five-week injury lay-off in time for the first leg, and playing 70 minutes against Lazio. ""I haven't decided which formation I will use. If the team defends well, I think it doesn't really matter if we have three or four at the back,"" Allegri said. ""I'm happy about the success the team is enjoying. The lads deserve praise because they've shown a lot of maturity."""
283,17/04/2015,20:05,Financial losses worsen for French clubs,"French professional clubs registered combined losses of 93 million euros ($100m, £67.1m) during the 2013-14 season, a significant increase on the previous campaign, the Professional Football League (LFP) announced on Friday.","The figures are a sharp rise from the 39 million euros of combined losses for the 40 professional clubs in France's top two divisions in 2012/13, but most of the losses were registered by Monaco. Qatar-owned Paris Saint-Germain, who have the biggest annual budget in France at 495 million euros, lost just 300,000 euros last season and Marseille 12.5 million euros. However, Monaco, owned by Russian billionaire Dmitry Rybolovlev, reported a deficit of 76 million euros despite finishing second in their first season since winning promotion back to the top flight. The principality club relied on injections from their owner to make big signings in the transfer market but their inability to generate income is restricted by their notorious lack of support, with crowds at the Stade Louis II rarely above 10,000. ""Repeated losses show the difficulties encountered by clubs as they seek to develop income streams to cover considerable charges, notably wages as well as social charges and taxes,"" said the LFP. Combined income for French professional clubs last season was 1.7 billion euros, of which 43.4 percent came from Paris Saint-Germain and Monaco, the two Ligue 1 sides in this season's Champions League quarter-finals. All the losses have been incurred in Ligue 1, where the 20 clubs lost 102 million euros, while clubs in the second tier actually had a 9 million-euro surplus."
284,15/04/2015,02:18,"Juve tie far from over, says Berbatov",Monaco striker Dimitar Berbatov insisted their Champions League campaign is far from over despite the visitors succumbing to a controversial 1-0 defeat at Juventus in the first leg of their quarter-final on Tuesday.,"Leonardo Jardim's French league hopefuls travelled to Turin looking to shock the Italian champions amid what has been a hugely promising season, only to be undone by an Arturo Vidal penalty just before the hour. Despite Monaco's shaky form at home in the competition this season -- they have won two, drawn one and lost the other -- the 34-year-old former Manchester United striker believes the tie is far from over. ""We're not happy with the result, and because of the penalty the referee gave against us. But there's one more game to go so we're optimistic we can do something and go through to the next round,"" Berbatov said. ""We played perfect. Juventus had chances to score, we had chances to score, and I believe we still have chances to qualify for the next round."" He added: ""We prepared well for tonight's game. Unfortunately we lost but everyone played well. Hopefully we can do the same in Monaco and qualify, because we know that we can do it."" The win has given Juventus the upper hand ahead of the return leg in the Principality on April 22, but Monaco will be out to avenge what angry coach Jardim called an ""unfair decision"". ""I like justice. And for me rights and rules have to be the same for everybody, in life not just in sport,"" he said. ""I'm disappointed. We played a good game, we've got to the quarters and I don't think the score truly reflects our performance. ""The result is down to a wrong decision made by the match referee."" Juventus dominated for long spells against a defensively-stubborn Monaco and spurned several opportunities in a busy first half to put the match beyond doubt before the referee pointed to the spot following a Ricardo Carvalho foul on Alvaro Morata that seemed to be just outside the area. Referee Pavel Kralovec waved away Monaco's protests and Vidal stepped up to smash the ball past Danijel Subasic and into the top corner in the 57th minute. Juventus coach Massimiliano Allegri had warned on Monday that Monaco -- who had conceded only four goals in their past eight Champions League games -- would be a tough nut to crack. ""The result was good -- we didn't concede a goal so we've got a small advantage, but it won't be easy in Monaco,"" said Allegri. ""They're a very defensive side and they have a lot of young players with pace. In the opening period we suffered during a 15 minute period and then turned things around in the second. ""But 1-0 will not be enough if we're to go through to the semi-finals. We have to play a different kind of game in Monaco and, above all, score a goal"", he added. ""But I have to repeat: whoever thought Monaco were an easy team to play against are wrong."""
285,14/04/2015,22:49,Vidal strikes as Juve labour past Monaco,Chilean international Arturo Vidal struck a second half-penalty as Juventus laboured to a 1-0 win over a stubborn Monaco in the first leg of their Champions League quarter-final in Turin on Tuesday.,"Juventus had spurned several chances in the opening half when Monaco, who stunned Arsenal 3-1 at the Emirates on their way to the last eight, also came close only for Yannick Ferreira-Carrasco to shoot straight at Gianluigi Buffon. The Turin giants, however, were given a break by Czech referee Pavel Kralovec, who pointed to the spot just before the hour when Alvaro Morata, under pressure from Ricardo Carvalho, clattered to the ground on the edge of the area. Monaco's protests that the foul was outside the area went unheeded and Vidal, who had fired over twice in the opening half, calmed nerves by firing past Danijel Subasic and into the top corner. Juventus welcomed back Andrea Pirlo after several weeks of absence due to injury, while Buffon and Carlos Tevez returned to the starting line up after missing the shock league defeat (1-0) to Parma last weekend. Juve coach Massimiliano Allegri opted for the 4-3-1-2 formation that saw the Italian champions sweep Borussia Dortmund aside 5-1 on aggregate to book their quarter-final place. However that caused problems, as well as chances, for the hosts who went in for the half-time break with little reward for their efforts. Spanish striker Morata fired a volley over from Pirlo's delightful chip in the opening minutes while Tevez forced Subasic down low to block a 25-metre drive. But Monaco quickly demonstrated their potency on the counter, the pace of Ferreira-Carrasco in particular causing problems for Swiss right-back Stephan Lichsteiner. When Layvin Kurzawa found space on the left, the left-back fired his effort over with Buffon covering the danger easily. Juve survived a bigger scare when Ferreira-Carrasco was set up inside the area only to fire straight at Buffon. Those chances sparked Juve into life, but Monaco -- who had conceded only four times in their past eight Champions League games -- packed their defence tightly. Tevez escaped to the back post but, while unmarked, shot straight at Subasic from Claudio Marchisio's pinpoint delivery, while Tunisian defender Aymen Abdennour produced a timely block on Lichsteiner's cross for Morata who was lurking at the far post. Monaco had claims for a penalty waved away after teenage striker Antony Martial tumbled to the ground under pressure from Giorgio Chiellini as he muscled his way into the area while in possession. Juve finished the half on a high, but in frustration after Tevez shot straight at Subasic while unmarked at back post from Marchisio's chip before Vidal ballooned over after running on to a ball delivered by the outside of Tevez's boot. Monaco started brightly after the restart, but Buffon reacted quickly to substitute Bernardo Silva's near-post drive although it looked slightly off target. Juve finally broke the deadlock just before the hour, Vidal stepping up and, despite his earlier imprecision, smashing the ball past Subasic to send a packed-out Juventus Stadium into raptures. Midfielder Geoffrey Kondogbia saw his long-distance drive tipped over by Buffon minutes later, and with 20 minutes remaining Monaco coach Leonardo Jardim reshuffled his side, replacing Italian defender Andrea Raggi with striker Dimitar Berbatov. While the Bulgarian had an almost immediate impact, heading over from a corner, Monaco failed to grab the away-goal equaliser that would have given them a huge boost ahead of the April 22 return leg."
286,13/04/2015,18:33,Tevez the 'danger man' for Monaco - Raggi,"Carlos Tevez is the danger man for Monaco as they attempt to upset Juventus in the first leg of their Champions League quarter-final, says the French club's Italian defender Andrea Raggi.","Monaco face the Italian champions in Turin on Tuesday hoping to achieve what no other club has done for two seasons in the competition -- walk away from Juventus Stadium with all three points. Even if they score, the Principality side remain at the mercy of a player in Tevez who has hit 17 goals in Serie A this season and scored six in the Champions League. Raggi told media in Turin on Monday: ""Tevez has made the difference for Juventus and he's the number one danger for us. ""He has really impressed me, his pressing, his technical skills. He's the complete player."" Monaco, however, have made the short trip to the northern Italian city looking to leave their mark. Leonardo Jardim's side swept Arsenal aside 3-1 at the Emirates before securing their place in the last eight on the away goals rule following a 2-0 defeat at the Stade Louis II in the return leg. Monaco have not featured at this stage of the Champions League since the 2003-2004 season when they went all the way to the final before being humbled 3-0 by Jose Mourinho's Porto. But Jardim insists they fully merit their place and said his ""organised"" and ""disciplined"" team won't be focusing on one player. ""We beat Arsenal in England and we finished as leaders of our group, so there's no doubt we deserve to be here,"" said Jardim, who made his name while coach of Sporting Braga in Portugal's top flight before spells with Olympiakos and Sporting Lisbon. ""Juventus are a team with a lot of qualities, a lot of experience, and their side is filled with quality players. ""I would say they're favourites for tomorrow and while we'll respect them, we have to go out and focus on playing our game, which is organised and disciplined, but I don't think we should focus on individual players like Tevez. ""He is the top scorer in Serie A, and has the experience and quality and so we have to be careful. But we can't afford to focus on him alone."" For Raggi, the return to Italy will be memorable. He played alongside Juventus midfielder Claudio Marchisio at Empoli, and said the prospect of facing the Bianconeri could cause family friction. ""Obviously playing a quarter-final in the Champions League is already a big satisfaction, but it's even better playing here in my home country,"" added Raggi. ""When I grew up half my family was for Inter Milan and the other half for Juventus. My family now are definitely all 'Juventini', but tomorrow I hope they'll be supporting Monaco!"""
287,10/04/2015,22:37,Three-goal Monaco up to third,Monaco collected their fourth consecutive away win to leapfrog Marseille into third place in the French Ligue 1 on Friday with a 3-0 success at Caen.,"Anthony Martial and Bernado Silva scored the goals that put Monaco a point ahead of Marseille, before they travel to Turin on Tuesday to take on Juventus in their Champions League quarter-final first leg. Martial continued his rich vein of recent form by opening the scoring just before the half-hour, finishing off a sweeping move from midfield begun by captain Jeremy Toulalan. A crossfield ball found winger Yannick Ferreira Carrasco and the Belgian's cross was touched in first-time off the post by Martial. It was the French under-21 international's sixth goal in as many matches, his seventh in total for the season, and underlined his claim for a full international call-up. Martial's livewire performances over the past month have seen Bulgarian striker Dimitar Berbatov relegated to the bench and the youngster once again repaid the faith of coach Leonardo Jardim. Monaco were already cruising to victory when Silva made it safe on 64 minutes when he combined with Carrasco to take a corner quickly and fire home left-footed with the home defence stranded. All remaining doubts about the outcome were settled when Silva added his second of the night six minutes from the end, with a beautifully-timed shot from Martial's perfect pass for his fourth goal of the season. Marseille face a difficult task to regain third spot, the final Champions League qualifying place, when they travel to Bordeaux on Sunday. Leaders Paris Saint-Germain take part in the League Cup final on Saturday against Bastia while second-placed Lyon, who were scheduled to play Bastia are idle with the match postponed until April 15."
288,09/04/2015,18:14,Toulalan commits to two more years at Monaco,"France defensive midfielder Jeremy Toulalan has signed on for a further two years with Monaco, the Ligue 1 club announced on Thursday.","Toulalan, 31, and club captain this season, was out of contract in June but has put pen to paper on a deal tying him to the Principality club until June 2017. ""Jeremy Toulalan, who was coming to the end of his contract, was one of our priorities and we are proud to be able to count on him for the coming seasons,"" vice-president Vadim Vasilyev said on the club's official website. Toulalan, who joined Monaco from Spanish club Malaga in 2013, said he came to the club ""to go as high as possible. We achieved that the first year with the Champions League. Now I will try my best to help the young players here."" Monaco also announced contract extensions for three other players. Croatian goalkeeper Danijel Subasic, 30, signed up until June 2019, while Moroccan midfielder Nabil Dirar, 29, and Italian defender Andrea Raggi, 30, are now both under contract until June 2018."
289,07/04/2015,21:07,Monaco fluff chance to close in on Champions League,"Monaco failed to close in on the Champions League places after drawing 0-0 at home to Montpellier on Tuesday, in a match postponed earlier this year.","The Principality outfit could have gone level on points with Marseille in third, the final Champions League qualifying place, had they won at the Stade Louis II. With seven games to go, Monaco remain fourth on 55 points, two behind Marseille and seven behind leaders Paris Saint-Germain. It could have been worse for the Champions League quarter-finalists, who face Juventus in their first leg encounter on April 14, had Lucas Barrios not missed a second half penalty -- the visitors' best chance in an otherwise dull encounter. This second straight stalemate following Friday's 1-1 draw with Saint-Etienne seriously dented Monaco's faint hopes of wresting the Ligue 1 title from PSG's grasp, although Leonardo Jardim's men still remain well placed to snare European football next season. Monaco had requested for this match to be postponed again to alleviate their fixture pile-up, but the French League refused. After a rough start to the season, Montpellier, who are now seventh with 49 points, have upped the ante away from home with just one loss in their last eight trips. They head to strugglers Toulouse on Sunday while Monaco will go head-to-head with 12th-placed Caen."

Saint-Etienne remain solid in fifth and six points off the pace having played a game more. ""We have some regrets, yes. I think we had the best chances, the best situations, even before scoring,"" said Saint-Etienne coach Christophe Galtier. Mevlut Erding put the visitors in front 28 minutes from time with a glorious glancing header that stunned the home crowd following a cross from Franck Tabanou. Turkish international and former Paris Saint-Germain striker Erding, 28, met the ball perfectly as he ran into the box and sent his header past the stranded Danijel Subasic and into the Monaco goal. However the lead was short-lived as Leonardo Jardim's men were back on level terms six minutes later when Anthony Martial clipped the ball home when picked out inside the area. The two best defences in the top flight then locked up shop as neither team were able to find a late winner. ""I'm disappointed because our aim is always to win,"" said Jardim. ""But we were up against good opponents who knew how to get in behind us. That created difficulties for us."" PSG can strike a major blow in the title race by continuing their impressive recent record against Marseille when the bitter rivals meet at the Stade Velodrome on Sunday. Laurent Blanc's side, who are still in the running for four trophies, have spent most of the season playing catch-up at the top but finally reached the summit after beating Lorient 3-1 in their last outing a fortnight ago. Blanc's side have dominated the fixture known as 'Le Classique' in recent years, with their 2-0 win at the Parc des Princes in November their sixth in a row against OM. With their main rivals facing each other, Lyon will hope to take advantage when they go to Guingamp on Saturday. Elsewhere, Bordeaux, in sixth, host Lens on Sunday, while bottom side Metz entertain fellow strugglers Toulouse and Lorient host Brittany rivals Rennes on Saturday."

However, they had hoped to push it back further with the first leg of their quarter-final against Italian champions Juventus set for April 14 in Turin. In a statement on their website, Monaco said they ""find the lack of support from the LFP regrettable"" at a time when ""French football is happy for its clubs to be doing well in European competition and helping its UEFA coefficient"". Monaco also pointed out that the second leg against Juventus on April 22 will therefore be a sixth match in the space of just 20 days. Leonardo Jardim's side are currently fourth in Ligue 1, four points behind Marseille in third and six points behind leaders Paris Saint-Germain with a game in hand."

Diego put Reims back into the game with 20 minutes to go but Nabil Dirar rose above the hosts' defence to seal the three points in the 79th minute. ""My team forgot about the Champions League very quickly and managed 20 minutes of real quality. We scored twice in those first 20 minutes. Our opponents then responded,"" Monaco coach Leonardo Jardim said. ""We showed we could offer some attacking football. The players play together and that's very important. ""The team is improving: after a rough start of the season, everyone worked hard to get there. The victory is very important for us ahead of the international break."" Monaco are now just a point off the Champions League qualifying places, although Marseille are yet to play this weekend. ""Our goal is to draw near the teams who are ahead of us. We have to stay in the top five and strengthen our position,"" the Portuguese added. Monaco leapfrogged Saint-Etienne, who were temporarily lifted to fourth place following a 2-0 over Lille earlier on Sunday. Paris Saint-Germain went top of Ligue 1 for the first time this season after title-rivals Lyon lost 2-1 at home to ten-man Nice on Saturday. The Parisians beat Lorient 3-1 on Friday thanks to a hat-trick from giant Sweden striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic. The results leave PSG on 59 points from 30 games with Lyon, who had taken the Ligue 1 lead from Marseille in the first game of 2015, second a point behind. Marseille, who are five points behind PSG in third, travel to Lens on Sunday night. If Marseille win they would move to within a point of Lyon, and two of PSG, to send Ligue 1 into a three-way battle of nerves with just eight games to go."

294,18/03/2015,12:14,Jardim accuses Wenger of lack of respect,Monaco coach Leonardo Jardim blasted Arsene Wenger's accusations that his side did not deserve to qualify for the Champions League quarter-finals and said the Frenchman showed a lack of respect after the Ligue 1 club went through on away goals.,"Despite a remarkable turnaround, the Gunners paid the price for a sloppy 3-1 first leg defeat at home but restored their pride with a 2-0 win that sent them out of the competition after the two clubs finished 3-3 on aggregate. Arsenal manager Wenger, who enjoyed great success at Monaco between 1987 and 1994, said following the tie that his team deserved to be in Friday's draw as the two men failed to shake hands after the match for the second straight time. ""No, we didn't shake hands, I left the pitch because my work was done. During the first leg, the opposing coach (Wenger) did not acknowledge me so I replied in the same manner. ""Arsenal were not respectful towards us during the first match but today we can celebrate. ""For me, we deserved to qualify,"" said the 40-year-old, Venezuelan-born coach. ""When a team like Monaco plays against Arsenal and wins the first leg 3-1 away from home, the qualification is justified. ""We were able to benefit from the first match and it's the first time I've been in the quarter-finals of the Champions League so I'm very happy. ""The match was very intense as we expected but noone would have believed that at the start of the competition we would reach the quarter-finals. ""Even in France or Monaco, nobody believed it was possible. ""Despite all the talk before the match, we showed that we were able to qualify and my players deserve credit. We were the only team to qualify that wasn't expected too and it's a great reward for the work put in by the players. They deserve to be respected. Wenger, who has failed to take Arsenal past the last-16 for five straight seasons, struggled, not for the first time, to accept his side had been second best. When asked if Monaco deserved their place in the last eight, the Frenchman replied; ""I don't believe so. If you look at the number of shots on target they had you will be surprised. Every defeat hurts but we didn't lose."" Jardim, who is in his first season at Monaco since taking over from Claudio Ranieri, expects the seven other teams in Friday's draw will fancy their chances against his underdogs. ""For the draw, it will be like the draw for the last-16, all the teams will want to play Monaco,"" added Jardim."
295,18/03/2015,02:00,Monaco qualify as Wenger regrets first leg damage,"Monaco qualified for the Champions League quarter-finals, for the first time since 2004, and went through on away goals after a 3-3 aggregate result against Arsenal in a thriller at the Louis II stadium on Tuesday.","Arsene Wenger, who was returning to the club he coached between 1987 and 2004, was left a frustrated figure after goals from Olivier Giroud and Aaron Ramsey were enough for a 2-0 win on the night but not enough to send the North Londoners through. ""We knew it would be very difficult to score that many goals,"" a philosophic Wenger told BeIn Sport after the tie. ""We weren't realistic enough in our approach and we should have been up by more at half-time. ""At the end of the day, we paid for our performance in the first leg. Monaco were playing at home but didn't have a shot on goal. We were very close but they surprised us in the first match because subconsciously we were too sure of ourselves,"" added the Frenchman. ""It's not a question of if we deserved to go through but of being realistic and we made too many errors in the first leg. ""We have to congratulate Monaco for their place in the last eight as they defended really well. They qualified so 'Bravo'! We are on the right track and played the match we had too. ""The last three months we haven't lacked in anything except our performance in the first leg. ""We have a superb spirit and great qualities,"" added the Frenchman, who helped Monaco win the 1988 French title, the 1991 French Cup and also guided the team to the 1992 Cup Winners' Cup final where they lost against German side Werder Bremen. Monaco vice-president Vadim Vasilyev hailed a great night in the club's history. ""It's a great night for AS Monaco and it's been 11 years since the 2003-04 season when the team reached this level. Arsenal played a great match but we stayed solid defensively although the final minutes were very difficult. ""It's great happiness but we play every match to win. In the changing room, the players were very proud to qualify but it's true we didn't celebrate like we did after winning the first match."" he added. Arsenal were attempting to become the first team in Champions League history to overcome a 3-1 first-leg defeat at home but came up agonisingly short. Constant pressure for 90 minutes, could have, provided more than two goals on another day, but the excellent Danijel Subasic turned in his second straight world class showing to play a decisive role. Ramsey, who came on as a substitute and played a key role in putting Arsenal into position to qualify, explained there was reason for deep regret after the defeat. ""We've always gone out to Bayern Munich and Barcelona at this stage but no disrespect to Monaco, we thought we'd have a good opportunity to qualify but we gave ourselves a tough test from the first leg. ""It's nearly again, but it's not enough."" said the Welshman. Monaco become the second French team to go into Friday's draw, following Paris Saint-Germain's equally dramatic victory over Chelsea last week and will be joined by Real Madrid, Bayern Munich, Porto and Atletico Madrid ahead of Wednesday's matches."
296,17/03/2015,22:45,Arsenal fall just short as Monaco qualify,Monaco desperately held on to qualify for the Champions League quarter-finals after a desperate fightback from Arsenal on Tuesday fell just short at the expense of away goals after the tie finished 3-3 on aggregate.,"Arsene Wenger, who was returning to the club he led to the French title in 1991, looked on as his valiant side almost completed the greatest comeback in Champions League history. A 2-0 Arsenal victory at a packed Louis II stadium was one goal short after a first-half strike from Olivier Giroud and Aaron Ramsey's goal with 11 minutes left set up a barnstorming finish. The Londoners ran themselves into the ground as they pressed for the qualifying goal but an inspired performance from Monaco's Croatian 'keeper Danijel Subasic proved decisive. ""We suffered but we played some good football too,"" Monaco midfielder Geoffrey Kondogbia told BeIn Sports after an absorbing encounter. ""Arsenal started the match and we were under pressure but the most important thing is that we're in the quarter-finals. ""We weren't favourites tonight (Tuesday) but we gave everything we had and we managed to do it."" Ramsey set up the thrilling finale when he scrambled the ball home after fellow substitute Theo Walcott had his shot come back off the post on 79 minutes. Giroud then had a point-blank header pawed off the line by the acrobatic Subasic as Arsenal threw everything forward in search of the goal that would send them through to the last eight. Arsenal captain Per Mertesacker was gracious in defeat and said the first leg played a key role; ""The best team went through and Monaco deserved it because they played much better in the first leg,"" said the German defender. ""We played well today (Tuesday) but it was a massive deficit, and it wasn't enough tonight. We came here and tried absolutely everything, and when you look at the game we could have scored more than two. ""Monaco deserve it and that's absolutely fine. They caused a lot of problems away from home but we have to admit that we regret the first game. ""But if we continue to play like that we'll do well in the FA Cup and the league. But play as badly as we did in the first game and you're out of the Champions League. Monaco deserved it."" Monaco came into the tie with a 9-0 qualifying record in European competition after winning the first leg while Arsenal were trying to break a five year jinx of failing to reach the quarter-finals. History was not in favour of the Gunners with no previous teams in the Champions League era managing to score more than once away from home in the second leg after losing the first leg and going on to qualify. After a cagey start by both teams, Arsenal gradually took control of the first-half with Giroud going close with a 14th minute header before Laurent Koscielny glanced his close range effort off the crossbar. With over 60 per cent possession during the opening 45 minutes, Arsenal finally got the goal their pressure deserved when the dynamic Giroud blasted home his own rebound after Subasic had blocked his initial shot. There was a moment of controversy when Alexis Sanchez went down under pressure from Fabinho but instead of a penalty to the visitors, the Norwegian referee booked the Chilean for diving. The Gunners sensed blood and poured forward for the rest of the half with only a goal-clearance from Aymen Abdennour from Welbeck's shot and a desperate Subasic save from Giroud keeping it 1-0 at the break. The second half provided more of the same although Wenger's side started to fatigue and left gaps open at the back at the expense of pushing numbers forward in search of goals. Ramsey's goal gave them renewed energy and Giroud almost made it an historic night but the French side, who last reached the quarter-finals in 2004, when they went on to lose the final against Porto, held on in front their nervous fans for a thrilling victory."
297,16/03/2015,22:33,Arsenal won't go out with a whimper says Wenger,Arsene Wenger insists Arsenal are confident of completing a miraculous fightback in their Champions League last 16 second leg against Monaco on Tuesday.,"Wenger's side arrived in the millionaires' playground, famous for its picturesque casino, knowing the odds are against them progressing to the quarter-finals after losing the first leg 3-1. The Gunners need to rewrite the history books to become the first team to qualify when heading into the away leg having to score more than one goal to avoid elimination. Wenger accepts his players were well below their best in the first leg and he knows Monaco are also a formidable defensive force at home, having not conceded at all during the group stages earlier this season. Leonardo Jardim's team extended their unbeaten record at the Stade Louis II Stadium to 16 games with a 3-0 win over Bastia on Friday. But Arsenal have never lost away to a French team, and Wenger sees no reason why his side, who are in confident mood after Saturday's 3-0 win over West Ham, cannot make a stunning fightback. ""Monaco is in a very strong position, but we have experience, the desire and belief we can do it,"" said Wenger, who confirmed centre-back Gabriel Paulista had travelled after recovering from a hamstring injury. ""We want to give everything to have the greatest performance on the pitch. If we did not believe we could do it, we would not be here. ""The statistics are against us. The result in the first leg is against us. We are conscious about that. ""But no matter how big the percentage (chance) is, we have to give absolutely everything to make the stats lie, that is our desire and belief that we can do it."" Wenger was manager at Monaco for seven years, guiding them to the French league title in 1988 and also the French Cup. Despite the air of sentimentality around the tie, the 65-year-old, who moved to Japan after leaving Monaco before taking charge at Arsenal in September 1996, remains focused on the task at hand. ""For me, it is a very special moment. I was a young coach here at Monaco, and stayed here for seven years,"" Wenger said. ""I have a lot of respect for Monaco and want to thank the whole club. ""However, the experience I have gained can help me to make the right decision tomorrow, so I am able to separate the emotion of coming back and the importance of the game. ""I am here for work and my job is for my club to win."" Jardim warned that they would not be taking Arsenal lightly as they bid to follow fellow Ligue 1 side Paris Saint-Germain past English opposition into the quarter-finals -- PSG saw off Chelsea on the away goals rule last week after securing a 2-2 draw in London for a 3-3 aggregate score. ""I don't think Arsenal underestimated us,"" said Jardim. ""Simply we had a dream match."" ""Arsenal is a super team who will certainly give us a lot of difficulty. It will certainly be the most complicated match for us this season."" The Monaco coach hailed the fact that French football was finally competing on a par with the English big boys. ""Compared to previous years Paris Saint-Germain and Monaco are at another level,"" said the 40-year-old Portuguese coach, who took over last summer. ""We're showing the quality of work achieved and developed in France. ""Maybe it's the year where French football beats English football."""
298,16/03/2015,02:05,Wenger has faith in Arsenal comeback,Arsene Wenger believes that Arsenal have the form to outclass Monaco on Tuesday and reach the quarter-finals of the Champions League as the only English side left in the competition.,"The Gunners slumped to a shock 3-1 loss to the Principality side in the first leg at Highbury, but since then they have impressed with a 2-1 FA Cup win at Manchester United and a 3-0 trouncing of West Ham on Saturday. Goals from Olivier Giroud, Aaron Ramsey and Mathieu Flamini in the London derby kept Arsenal in third place, seven points behind Chelsea in the league, albeit with the leaders having one game in hand. The manner of these two wins also gave Wenger hope that he can celebrate his return to Monaco, where he made his managerial reputation as coach from 1987-94, with a famous win. ""We now go to Monaco, come out of a big week, played at Manchester United, played today a derby. We have a little belief,"" he said after the West Ham win. ""If you have no belief, you have no chance. We have to have belief and give everything."" To get past Monaco and keep English hopes alive in the Champions League, Arsenal will have to do what no other side has managed in the UEFA Champions League era -- win having gone into an away tie needing to score more than once to avoid elimination. Teams have come back from a home first-leg loss only twice in the UEFA Champions League, and both were beaten 1-0 first time out: Ajax (v Panathinaikos FC, 1995/96 semi-finals, 3-0 second leg) and Inter Milan (v Bayern Munich, 2010/11 round of 16, 3-2 away. Wenger's upbeat comments, however, were echoed by Welsh midfielder Ramsey, who is back to near his top form after returning from a third hamstring injury of the season. ""We need to score goals. So we will go there and try to score three or more goals and hopefully not concede any. That's our target and that's how we will approach it,"" said Ramsey, who missed the first leg. ""We had a sloppy first leg and we've made it quite difficult for ourselves but it's not over yet. We are more than capable of scoring three goals. We'll go into the game believing we can achieve that."" Monaco also go into the last 16 tie with a good win behind them, having thumped Bastia 3-0 at home on Friday. That win left them in fourth place behind Lyon, Paris Saint-Germain and Marseille with 10 games to go until the end of the season. Portuguese midfielder Joao Moutinho has been instrumental in recent successes and he believes that the Champions League format suits Monaco better than the stuffiness of Ligue 1 play. ""We can show our best qualities against the top teams,"" he said. ""Play in the L1 is very closed, very aggressive. Some teams are good technically, but others rely on the physical side, on defending and counter-attacks. It's hard to find spaces and you have to come up with different tactics to get the wins. ""No-one believed in us (in the Champions League) and yet we have really played well. We deserve to be where we are. ""I have full confidence in our side, despite our lack of experience. With the team spirit we have we can go even further and why not a repeat of Monaco and Porto in 2004."" That was a reference to the last time that Monaco made it past the last 16 stage in the Champions League. With Didier Deschamps as coach, they went all the way to the final on that occasion before losing to a Porto side managed by Jose Mourinho."
299,15/03/2015,02:13,Arsenal ready for Monaco test says Wenger,"Arsene Wenger insists his Arsenal players believe they can overturn a 3-1 deficit against Monaco in the Champions League on Tuesday, but the Gunners manager is less confident about their chances of winning the Premier League.","Goals from Olivier Giroud, Aaron Ramsey and Mathieu Flamini secured a 3-0 win over West Ham that left Arsenal in buoyant mood ahead of their tricky last 16 second leg trip to Monaco in midweek. It also moved them just six points behind Chelsea in the league, albeit with the leaders having two games in hand. So, Wenger was asked, are Arsenal back in the title race? ""Not at the moment,"" he responded. ""We just keep going. We have won eight of the last nine."" While it might be too late for Arsenal to mount a title charge, Wenger claimed it was only the effects of the World Cup that prevented his side being in a position to put more pressure on Chelsea. And he said they are now a different, more fluent, team because the players know each other much better. ""Today we are a different team. We suffered a lot post-World Cup,"" he said. ""What is for sure is the players understand each other much better than six or seven months ago and that makes everyone much more dangerous."" That could be seen throughout Saturday's game at the Emirates Stadium, especially for the key first goal from Giroud on 45 minutes. Arsenal had by that point laid siege to the West Ham goal, although with no reward, because goalkeeper Adrian was putting in a supreme performance. Adrian's display was all the more impressive because West Ham assistant manager Neil McDonald revealed that the Spaniard had dislocated a finger in the warm-up, but insisted on playing on. West Ham had already had to reshuffle their team with so many injuries, resulting in Cheikhou Kouyate playing in defence. ""He's had it strapped up,"" McDonald said of the keeper's injury. ""He's stood up and been counted, which is great."" Even Adrian's heroics weren't enough however. Mesut Ozil, Ramsey and Giroud interchanged exquisitely, before the French striker rifled the ball in off the far post to make it 1-0. Giroud had received criticism for his misses against Monaco, but has now responded with two goals in his last two league games and Wenger praised his resilience. ""Always, it's one of his great strengths. This is a boy who played at 22-23 in division two in France. You need mental strength for that. There's no red carpet there,"" he said. West Ham put Arsenal under pressure in the second half, which was oddly disrupted by a calf injury to referee Chris Foy, who had to go off for fourth official Anthony Taylor. But Arsenal eventually picked off the visitors. Giroud combined with Ramsey for the Welsh midfielder to fire past Adrian in the 81st minute, before Flamini made it 3-0 with an easy finish three minutes later. The final score was somewhat unfair on West Ham and McDonald said boss Sam Allardyce didn't attend the post-game press conference because he wanted to pick the players up, who ""were feeling really sorry for themselves"". There was none of that with Arsenal, whose week had started with an FA Cup quarter-final win at Manchester United, and Wenger was gushing about their belief that they can do something special in Europe on Tuesday. ""We now go to Monaco, come out of big week, played at Manchester United, played today a derby. We have a little belief,"" he said. ""If you have no belief, you have no chance. We have to have belief and give everything."""
300,13/03/2015,23:40,Monaco warm up for Arsenal with 3-0 home win,Monaco gave themselves a massive boost ahead of their Champions League clash at home against Arsenal with a convincing 3-0 victory over nine-men Bastia in Ligue 1 on Friday as Guingamp won 2-1 at Nice.,"The Principality side, who have a game in hand, are sitting fourth three points behind third-place Marseille, who take on leaders Lyon on Sunday in the Stade Velodrome. An Anthony Martial double along with a first-half goal from Brazilian Matheus Carvalho went a long way to consoling Leonardo Jardim's side who were dumped out of the League Cup by the Corsicans last month. Bastia fell apart, showing early signs of fatigue after being reduced to nine-men when Drissa Diakite and Giovanni Sio saw red on both sides of the break. ""It was the perfect evening,"" said Jardim. ""We needed to win to prepare for Arsenal. The team are now confident which is very important for us. ""We had a great match with lots of chances. The Bastia of the League Cup were much more aggressive. ""After the first sending off it was easier for us. We're just three point off the podium, but now I'll be focusing on Arsenal."" Monaco, who stunned Arsenal 3-1 in their Champions League last 16 first leg tie at the Emirates, play the English side at home on Tuesday. And they set the scene in their Louis II Stadium as Martial bagged his third goal of the season after 22 minutes. Layvin Kurzawa failed to convert a penalty 10 minutes later but Carvalho added a second one just before the break. The young Brazilian turned passer in the second half when he served Martial in the box allowing the French forward to double his tally six minutes after the break. Bastia coach Ghislain Printant admitted they were outplayed. ""They were largely better than us. At nine we were finished. ""I hope that they play like that on Tuesday. They belong in the top three in the championship."" In the other match of the night, Nice failed to win for the seventh time in a row as Christophe Mandanne scored a double in a 2-1 win by visiting Guingamp. Guingamp are tenth with Nice fighting the drop zone five place below. The top three will be in action on Sunday as second-placed Paris Saint-Germain turn their attention back to domestic duties after advancing to the Champions League quarter-finals. Just a point behind Lyon, the Parisians travel to Bordeaux."
301,11/03/2015,15:37,"Toulalan move to Inter ""done""","Monaco defender Jeremy Toulalan has agreed terms with Inter Milan ahead of a summer move that would see the Frenchman earn two million euros a season for three years, reports said Wednesday.","Inter, currently ninth place in Serie A 25 points behind leaders Juventus, rank fourth among the league's top sides for goals scored (41) but have the leakiest defence (34) among the top half of the table. Coach Roberto Mancini has recently remarked on Inter's struggles at the back and Toulalan, whose contract with Monaco expires in the summer, is regarded as one of several players who could remedy the problem. Sport Mediaset said the deal to bring the 31-year-old -- who can play in defence as well as in a defensive midfield position -- to the San Siro is ""done"", albeit adding that Inter president Erick Thohir had yet to give the green light. Inter and city rivals AC Milan are both struggling to keep pace this season and although the Champions League looks out of reach, the Milan giants have 12 games in which to fight for a place in the Europa League. Inter are 10 points adrift of Lazio, who occupy the third and last qualifying spot for the Champions League, with Milan a point further adrift."

And both the return of Motta and the decision to rest Brazil defender Silva comes with one eye on next midweek's Champions League last-16, second leg against Chelsea in London. ""We bring back Thiago Motta who is over his calf injury. He hasn't played for three weeks, so we will see how he gets on. He is a very important player for our philosophy,"" said Blanc.

Blanc also indicated that Zlatan Ibrahimovic will return to the line-up after missing the last two matches due to suspension. ""He is ready. We have had him working while he was out suspended and he has had a good break, which he needed.

304,04/03/2015,23:00,Cavani seals PSG spot in French Cup semis,A finely taken goal by Edinson Cavani sealed a 2-0 win for Paris Saint Germain over Monaco on Wednesday in their French Cup quarter-final and kept alive their hopes of a domestic treble this season.,"Cavani's second-half effort -- his 18th goal in all competitions this term -- added to David Luiz's scrappy header - leaves PSG still involved in the Cup, they are in the League Cup final and battling to retain their league title. They are also tied at 1-1 with Chelsea heading into their Champions League last 16 second leg clash next week. Monaco coach Leonardo Jardim had rested some of his players or left some on the bench and he said that was partly to blame for their loss. ""We always try to win but today was very tough for us,"" said the Portuguese handler, whose side lost on penalties to Bastia in the League Cup semi-finals. ""We didn't have a specialist central defender and that makes life complicated. ""PSG therefore were logical winners."" PSG were without several first choice players including hardman Italian international midfielder Thiago Motta and the stylish French international Yohan Cabaye while talismanic striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic was serving the second match of his two game suspension. Jardim opted to leave some on the bench players such as Joao Moutinho and Yannick Ferreira-Carrasco while as is the norm with French Cup games Dutch international Maarten Stekelenburg started in goal instead of Danijel Subasic. PSG took an early lead as the mop haired Luiz managed to head home at the second opportunity after his weak downward header had bounced into the ground, but he reacted quickest to head it past Stekelenburg. Cavani went close to doubling the lead soon afterwards but his shot had some of the power taken off it by a Monaco defender and Stekelenburg gathered the ball safely. Monaco had seen little of the ball in the early stages but Alain Traore was denied only by the stanchion of the bar and the post with a curling freekick. However, Cavani put the game beyond their reach seven minutes into the second-half as he ran onto a nicely sleighted pass from Marco Verratti and unleashed a shot which went in off the post. PSG should have been 3-0 up minutes later in an incredible passage of play and one that Javier Pastore will prefer to erase from his memory. Twice he hit the post and then when presented with a far easier opportunity and the net beckoning he fired wildly over the bar, earning a look of disbelief from Cavani. The hosts were swarming all over their hard-pressed opponents and it was Pastore's Argentinian international team-mate Ezequiel Lavezzi who was hanging his head soon afterwards as he nipped in ahead of his marker but his effort went the wrong side of the post. PSG joined fellow Ligue 1 outfit St Etienne -- who have not won the trophy since 1977 -- who had to come from behind to force a 1-1 drew before eventually prevailing 4-3 on penalties over third tier Boulogne on Tuesday. The semi-finals line-up will be completed on Thursday when the last two matches take place including holders Guingamp playing fourth division Concarneau with the Ligue 1 side in a bit of a slump having lost three times last week."
305,03/03/2015,02:30,'Tired' Monaco seek PSG upset in French Cup,Paris Saint-Germain are gunning for an unprecedented domestic treble as they host Monaco on Wednesday in the French Cup quarter-finals.,"PSG are currently second in Ligue 1, one point behind leaders Lyon after being held to a frustrating 0-0 Sunday draw by Monaco, a team they meet for the second time in four days. But PSG know the way to the Stade de France as they already booked their ticket for the French League Cup final next month against Bastia. PSG face a tough challenge on Wednesday as they take on one of the few top flight sides remaining. And Monaco love nothing more than to live up to their giant-killer reputation, as Arsenal learnt the hard way last week in Champions League action. The French Cup has been identified as a priority by Paris president Nasser al-Khelaifi as the Ligue 1 giants have yet to lift the trophy in the Qatar-fuelled era. PSG, however, seem to be in a tight spot with the return leg of their Champions' League clash against Chelsea looming on March 11 while the Ligue 1 leaves Laurent Blanc's men with little room for error. Injuries to Thiago Motta (calf), Yohan Cabaye (thigh), Serge Aurier (thigh) and Lucas (adductor), on top of Zlatan Ibrahimovic's two-game suspension, make things even harder for the capital club. In this context, Monaco could appear as firm favourites. But coach Leonardo Jardim played it down. ""We will try to have a good game. We are more tired than PSG and our squad isn't as big. We have 18-19 players and two keepers. In the back, we have two players injured and two others who are suspended. We will have to find a solution but we're working on it,"" the Portuguese explained. ""Wednesday's game will be different. We will have fans backing us up and we'll have to recover,"" PSG's Blaide Matuidi responded in accord. ""The fresher team can certainly come out on top."" In an early match on Tuesday, six-time winners Saint-Etienne head to Boulogne-sur-Mer, who ply their trade in their third-tier. The Ligue 1 side are seeking to revive former glories to end a title drought in the tournament stretching all the way back to 1977. And, as coach Christophe Galtier vowed, Les Verts, will take the encounter seriously. ""The Cup is important, it's been too long since Saint-Etienne reached a semi-final. It's part of the club's DNA"", he explained. The tie will be significant too for Boulogne 'keeper Jody Viviani. Now 33, Viviani spent four years with Saint-Etienne as their backup shot-stopper, appearing 40 times for the club. ""It's always nice to face Saint-Etienne. I know quite a few guys over there, including Loic Perrin and Moustapha Bayal Sall whom I played with,"" he recalled before denying rosy memories would cloud his judgement. ""We certainly must not stop to watch Saint-Etienne play. We'll have to make all the efforts to stay united and play together to match our opponent,"" Viviani added. ""We are, after all, just two games away from the Stade de France."" In other games, title holders Guingamp, who slumped to a third defeat in a week after their 1-0 loss against Nantes, travel to neutral site Lorient where they play fourth-tier Concarneau, while Brest take on Auxerre in a Ligue 2 classic.

306,25/02/2015,23:53,"Berbatov returns to haunt Gunners, Atletico lose",Former Spurs striker Dimitar Berbatov rolled back the years to score as Monaco pulled off a memorable 3-1 victory over Arsenal in their Champions League last 16 first leg match on Wednesday.,"The 34-year-old -- who played for Tottenham from 2006-08 -- struck the French side's second goal as the visitors made it an extremely unhappy reunion for former coach Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger. It meant that none of the three English sides left in the competition have won their first leg games -- Chelsea having been held 1-1 by defending French champions Paris Saint Germain last week. The Gunners -- who had not conceded a goal in three previous visits from French sides in the competition -- face a huge challenge when they travel to Monaco next month if they are to reach the last eight for the first time since 2010. Wenger, who spent seven seasons at Monaco before going to Japan, said his side had lost their heads. ""The heart took over the head and that doesn't work. Mentally we were not sharp enough to get into the game and we paid for it,"" said Wenger. His Monaco counterpart Leonardo Jardim, who produced a celebratory run down the touchline to rival that of his Portuguese compatriot Jose Mourinho when Porto knocked out Manchester United at Old Trafford in the last 16 in 2004, said it was a remarkable night for his team. ""Nobody really thought this result was possible but we achieved it,"" said Jardim, whose achievement is even greater as he lost the star duo of James Rodriguez and Radamel Falcao when they left for Real Madrid and Manchester United respectively before the season started. For Berbatov, a much-maligned figure at times during his spell in England with Spurs and Manchester United, it was an especially happy moment. ""We are good, a good team and we wanted to win more than them and were were fighting all over the pitch and we scored more goals,"" said the Bulgarian. Monaco joined Bayern Munich and Manchester United in putting three past Arsenal in the competition's history. Monaco monarch Prince Albert II -- who was at the match -- was in a jovial mood afterwards. ""It pains me for (Wenger), I think we ruined his evening!"" he told BeIn Sport. The night's other match was an ill-tempered affair which saw one player sent off and eight other players booked. However, German side Bayer Leverkusen gave themselves a glimmer of hope of reaching the quarter-finals for the first time as they beat last season's finalists Atletico Madrid 1-0. Hakan Calhanoglu scored the only goal and become the first player to score against Atletico in the Champions League since Kostas Mitroglou did for Olympiakos on September 16. ""I think we were clearly the better team and therefore we deserved the win,"" said Calhanoglu. ""I gave it all I had for the goal, but we have to play just as well in the return leg as we did today and then we have a good chance."" The visitors ended the game with 10 men when Tiago was sent off for a second bookable offence. Bayer coach Roger Schmidt's boldness in aligning an attacking formation was rewarded and he was extremely proud of his players for delivering. ""We can be extremely satisfied with this result,"" said Schmidt, who was guiding Bayer to their first win in their last eight knockout matches in the competition. ""The team was exceptional and now we have a real chance of reaching the quarter-finals."" Atletico coach Diego Simeone admitted his side faced a tough battle but looked on the bright side. ""Leverkusen could perhaps have killed the game off with a second goal but we still have a good chance at home,"" said Simeone. ""They put us under pressure and we have made things complicated for ourselves."""
307,25/02/2015,22:49,Arsenal stunned as Monaco seize initiative,Arsenal are in danger of an embarrassing exit from the Champions League after Monaco romped to a stunning 3-1 win in the last 16 first leg at the Emirates Stadium on Wednesday.,"Arsene Wenger's team were left shell-shocked as Geoffrey Kondogbia put the French club ahead with a deflected first half strike before former Tottenham forward Dimitar Berbatov marked his return to north London with the second goal after the interval. Berbatov's cool finish was a hammer blow to the Arsenal fans who had jeered him for his past allegiance to their bitter rivals and there was worse to come. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain had just given Arsenal renewed hope with a 90th minute goal when Yannick Ferreira-Carrasco galloped clear to score Monaco's third and leave the Premier League team needing a herculean effort in the second leg on March 17 to avoid last 16 elimination for a fifth successive season. It was an especially chastening evening for Wenger, who made his managerial reputation during a seven-year spell at Monaco and was renewing acquaintances with his old club in a competitive match for the first time. After losing to Bayern Munich, Barcelona and AC Milan at this stage, a Monaco side only fourth in Ligue 1 seemed to represent a good opportunity for Arsenal to advance to the last eight at last. But Monaco had conceded just one goal in their six group matches and Leonardo Jardim's side produced a counter-attacking masterclass to leave Arsenal impotent in attack and incompetent in defence. After a frenetic opening, Arsenal found themselves entangled in Monaco's defensive web. Alexis Sanchez has emerged as Arsenal's creative fulcrum in his debut season and the Chile winger almost found the key to unlocking the obdurate Monaco rearguard when he exchanged passes with Mesut Ozil before flicking his shot just over. But, emboldened by the ease with which they had kept Arsenal at bay, Jardim's team began to push forward with more confidence and Joao Moutinho found space for an acrobatic volley that sailed over. It was a warning that Arsenal failed to heed and the visitors went ahead in the 38th minute. Danny Welbeck lost possession inside his own half and Moutinho quickly moved the ball onto Kondogbia, who had been left unmarked 30 yards from goal. The French midfielder advanced unchecked before lashing a fierce drive that took a big deflection off Per Mertesacker and flashed past wrong-footed Arsenal goalkeeper David Ospina. Arsenal still had time to remedy their perilous situation and Olivier Giroud should have equalised early in the second half when he met Sanchez's cross, only to scuff his shot wide from close-range. Giroud was presented with an even better opportunity moments later but ended up pounding the turf in frustration after ballooning a header well over from Santi Cazorla's inswinging free-kick. And Giroud's angry reaction was emulated by the entire Emirates Stadium in the 53rd minute when Berbatov doubled Monaco's lead in stunning fashion. With Wenger's side pouring forward in an undisciplined and panicked search for an equaliser, Anthony Martial made them pay, sweeping away down the right before squaring a pass to the unmarked Berbatov, who had time and space to drive a powerful finish past Ospina. Arsenal needed an immediate response but Giroud's nightmare continued as he blazed over from close-range after a Sanchez shot was well saved by Danijel Subasic. Wenger had seen enough and hauled off Giroud, with Theo Walcott on in his place. Walcott fared no better than Giroud as he failed to beat Subasic from close-range before stumbling and getting in the way of Welbeck's attempt to convert the rebound. Oxlade-Chamberlain got one back in the 90th minute when the substitute curled a fine finish beyond Subasic from the edge of the area. But it was a false dawn as Ferreira-Carrasco was granted the freedom of the right flank to advance and drive a dagger into Arsenal hearts."
308,24/02/2015,20:33,We'll play Arsenal our way says Monaco coach,Monaco coach Leonardo Jardim has warned Arsenal ahead of their Champions League last 16 first leg on Wednesday that the French side with the mean defence will be tough to break down.,"""We'll play it solid and stop Arsenal's midfield and attackers from finding a way through,"" The Portuguese coach promised on the eve of the match. Monaco may be finding it difficult to find goals after the departure of James Rodriguez and Radamel Falcao last summer, but they currently have the tightest defence in Ligue 1, with just 19 goals conceded in 25 matches. ""We will be organised and ambitious. Our way is to seek solutions but we will play it our way, solid defensively and focussed on teamwork,"" he said. ""We won't go out there as favourites but we go out there in optimistic mood with hope of a good match and getting through to the next round,"" he added. After a slow start to the Ligue 1 season Monaco went on a run of form that has lifted them to fourth, and they won their qualifying group ahead of Bayer Leverkusen, Zenit St Petersburg and Benfica, conceding only one goal."
309,24/02/2015,17:24,Wenger warns against complacency in Monaco tie,Arsenal are strongly fancied to beat Monaco in their Champions League last-16 tie but Gunners manager Arsene Wenger has warned fans not to expect an easy ride.,"The Premier League side have been knocked out at this stage by Bayern Munich in each of the last two seasons but they could scarcely have asked for a kinder draw in the first knockout round this year after finishing second in their group behind Borussia Dortmund. Monaco won their group ahead of Bayer Leverkusen despite only scoring four goals in six games and despite downsizing last summer when Radamel Falcao and James Rodriguez were both allowed to leave. However, speaking ahead of the first leg of the tie against the Ligue 1 side at the Emirates Stadium on Wednesday, Wenger warned his side against complacency. ""We have been in the Champions League for 17 consecutive years and that means we would have not learned the lesson -- easy is a word that you have to ban in the Champions League,"" said Wenger, who revealed midfielder Jack Wilshere had been rested from Tuesday's training session as a precaution following his recovery after ankle surgery. ""Every time we were in there, it was hard-earned wins. ""It is always one-goal difference - you go out for one goal, you stay in for one goal and that means you have to work very hard. ""If you look at the teams who are (left) competing there is always a reason to think it is difficult, so let us just try to do the next game, go into that with belief and humility, to try to give everything we can."" Arsenal head into the game in good form having won eight of their last nine matches in domestic competition, but Monaco have lost just once over 90 minutes in their last 17 games, and have conceded a miserly three goals in that time. ""Monaco is a team who made 11 points at the group stage, scored four goals and conceded one, so that means they defend very well,"" said Wenger, who coached Monaco earlier in his career. ""That is what they will certainly try to do tomorrow and they are also very good on the break, quick in transition, so that is what we expect from them."" Wenger was in charge at the Stade Louis II for seven years before moving on to Nagoya Grampus in Japan, but he said he will not allow himself any sense of nostalgia in facing his former employers for the first time in a competitive fixture. ""It was the start of my career and I didn't know how long I would be in the job or where I would be. It was my first chance to be in a big club, I was very young and you're always grateful for that,"" the French coach said. ""I am happy that Monaco are back at the top level, but I have been manager of Arsenal for 18 years and I am focused on just qualifying for the quarter-final against a good side. ""It is the first time Monaco have put a lot of investment into the team again because they were in the second division. ""Now they are in the second phase of that process which means they respect the financial fair play more and have a strategy that is more based on youth."""
310,24/02/2015,02:02,Monaco reunion holds no romance for Wenger,Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger insists he hasn't been wasting any time on nostalgic reminiscences ahead of his reunion with former club Monaco in the Champions League on Wednesday.,"Wenger made his name as a manager during a successful seven-year spell at Monaco, which included leading them to the Ligue 1 title in 1988, winning the French Cup three years later and finishing as runners-up in the 1992 European Cup Winners' Cup. Yet, since leaving the French Riviera after being sacked in 1994, Wenger, now in his 19th year in charge at Arsenal, has rarely come into contact with the team where he spent his formative years as a coach. The Gunners were beaten by Monaco in a pre-season match before the current campaign, when a goal from Radamel Falcao, now on loan at Manchester United, gave Leonardo Jardim's side a 1-0 victory in the Emirates Cup. But this last 16, first leg clash at the Emirates Stadium will be Wenger's first competitive clash with Monaco, prompting questions about whether he has fond memories of his time at the Stade Louis II. Wenger's response made it clear romantic reflections on his past relationships came a distant second to keeping his players focused on their battle to finish in the Premier League's top four had been consuming all his waking hours. ""I have enough experience to know that the most important game is this one, after, you think about the next one, so it has not been hard,"" Wenger said after Saturday's 2-1 win at Crystal Palace lifted Arsenal to third in the league. ""We fought like mad to come back in a strong position in the (Premier League), and not to win (against Palace) would have been disastrous."" While Wenger was dismissive of his own memories of Monaco, the 65-year-old Frenchman is far too astute to be as offhand about his old club's current players. After failing to reach the quarter-finals of Europe's elite club competition since 2010, due to a series of tough draws against the likes of Bayern Munich and Barcelona, this appears a golden opportunity for Arsenal to finally reach the last eight again. But Wenger warned his players not to underestimate the French side, who are fourth in Ligue 1 and advanced to the last 16 as group winners thanks largely to a pair of impressive victories over Bayer Leverkusen. ""The last 16 in recent years has been super tough. This is a 50/50 game,"" Wenger said. ""We know that Monaco are very tight defensively - they didn't concede in the group stage against good teams. Of course it will be tricky, but a possible tie. ""It is really a 50-50 because Monaco are in a similar position to us. They came back into a good position in the league and their confidence level will be high."" For much of an inconsistent campaign, Arsenal have once again offered more style than substance, but Wenger is confident the gritty nature of his side's win at Palace proved they have the mental and physical strength required to last the pace. ""The spirit is there and we want to keep that as a very strong basis, the team has come up a level and we will see that with the results,"" Wenger said. Wenger must decide whether to change a winning side against Monaco, with England internationals Jack Wilshere, fit again following ankle surgery, and Theo Walcott having been left on the bench at Palace. Monaco's main fitness concern is France left-back Layvin Kurzawa, who limped off against Nice with a leg injury. ""Layvin Kurzawa took a knock on the thigh but we will see if he can recover in time to play Arsenal on Wednesday,"" Jardim said."
311,23/02/2015,14:41,Monaco's Traore sidelined with shin fracture,Monaco and Ivory Coast international striker Lacina Traore is to have surgery on a right shin stress fracture after returning from the Africa Cup of Nations with the injury.,"""He'll be back in six to eight weeks,"" a club statement said of the giant 6ft 8in (2.03m) target man on Monday. ""He'll be operated on this week after recently aggravating the injury,"" Monaco explained. The 24-year-old has been carrying the fracture all season, but played in Ivory Coast's 3-1 semi-final win over DR Congo as the Elephants clinched their first continental trophy since 1992 in Equatorial Guinea. Troare, previously with Anji Makhachkala in Russia, and whom it was hoped could partly fill the boots of the departed Radamel Falcao. But he suffered a hamstring injury and missed the start of the season and has since played eight games for Monaco this season and scored just one goal for them."
312,21/02/2015,10:45,"Falcao still hot property, says Monaco director",Colombian striker Radamel Falcao will find a top class side if Manchester United do not take up the option to sign him after a disappointing loan spell the vice-president of his French club Monaco told the BBC on Saturday.,"The 29-year-old -- who missed last year's World Cup after failing to recover from a serious knee injury -- is according to Monaco vice-president Vadim Vasilyev wanted by several great clubs. Falcao, who made his name at Portuguese giants Porto before earning a multi-million euros transfer to Monaco where he spent the 2013/14 season, would cost United £43.2million ($66.5million, 58.5million euros) were they to exercise their option. However, with just four goals in 19 appearances -- he was substituted in United's last match the FA Cup fifth round clash with Preston -- it seems increasingly unlikely. ""I'm not worried for Falcao, he is a world-class striker,"" Vasilyev told the BBC's Football Focus programme. ""If Manchester United decide not to take up the option at the end of the season, we have interest from other great clubs. So I am really not worried for him at all."" United have already paid a £6m loan fee and the striker's £265,000-a-week wages. United manager Louis van Gaal has been pilloried in the Colombian press and dubbed 'Van Maal' (Mr Evil) by former Colombian international striker Faustiono Asprilla. However, the Dutch coach suggested last month that Falcao -- who scored nine goals in his first season with Monaco -- was a long way from proving he deserved a permanent move. ""If a player costs £95m or £5,000, it doesn't make any difference. You have to prove yourself. ""We have made this deal and everything is clear."""
313,20/02/2015,23:28,Monaco warm up for Arsenal with derby win,Monaco gave themselves a boost ahead of their trip to play Arsenal in the Champions League by beating Cote d'Azur rivals Nice 1-0 at the Allianz Riviera in Ligue 1 on Friday.,"Substitute Bernardo Silva was the hero for the principality side, coming off the bench to net the only goal of the game five minutes from time. The Portuguese midfielder stroked the ball low into the far corner of the net from the edge of the box after Yannick Ferreira Carrasco had intercepted a Kevin Gomis clearance to give Monaco a win that lifts them up to fourth place in the table before the rest of the weekend's games. It was their first league win since late January and the clean sheet was their ninth in their last 10 Ligue 1 games. However, it was not all good news for Leonardo Jardim's side, who saw influential left-back Layvin Kurzawa limp off in the first half with a knock that may make him a doubt for Wednesday's Champions League last-16 first leg against the Premier League side. In addition, Monaco won the game despite having Tunisian defender Aymen Abdennour sent off in stoppage time at the end of the first half for a dangerous challenge on Romain Genevois. Abdennour will now be automatically suspended for next week's home game with Paris Saint-Germain, and such selection problems are not what Jardim would have wanted at a time when the likes of Andrea Raggi and Ricardo Carvalho are already on the sidelines. However, Jardim was delighted to get the three points, while Nice slumped to a first league defeat of 2015 as they failed to score for the fourth game in a row, only coming close to scoring when Carlos Eduardo headed against the bar in the second half. ""Nice started the match well but from the 25th minute on, we controlled it,"" said Jardim. ""It was difficult when we were down to 10 men but we still played well. ""Layvin Kurzawa took a knock on the thigh but we will see if he can recover in time to play Arsenal on Wednesday."" Monaco move above Saint-Etienne, who entertain second-placed Marseille on Sunday. Leaders Lyon, who are two points clear at the top, play host to Nantes on Sunday while Paris Saint-Germain, in third, are at home to Toulouse on Saturday. PSG must do without the injured Serge Aurier, Yohan Cabaye, Lucas and Thiago Motta for that game, while David Luiz and Marco Verratti are both banned."
314,08/02/2015,16:05,Monaco unbeaten run ended at Guingamp,Monaco's recent charge up the Ligue 1 standings came to a shuddering halt on Sunday when they conceded a first goal in over 800 minutes to fall 1-0 at ten-man Guingamp.,"The result leaves Monaco fifth on 40 points while Saint Etienne, who drew 3-3 with Lens on Friday, have 41 in fourth, but only the top three in France qualify for the Champions League. Croatian international 'keeper Daniel Subasic had not let in a league goal for Monaco in 842 minutes when Dorian Leveque tapped in at the far post for Guingamp after Claudio Beavue beat the backline with a searching pass in the 52nd minute. And this came despite the numerical advantage enjoyed by the visitors after Guingamp midfielder Moustapha Diallo was red-carded on 21 minutes for a studs up challenge. Monaco lost a League Cup semi-final to Bastia in midweek after a penalty shoot-out and had been unbeaten in the league since November. They were runners-up in Ligue 1 last season and are looking forward to facing Arsenal in a Champions League last-16 two-legged affair. Monaco were on an eight match unbeaten run in the league, with five straight wins on the road, while Guingamp extended their winning streak at home to six straight wins. France's top three teams went into the weekend separated by two points with leaders Lyon on 49 hosting Paris Saint Germain, on 47 and who can go top if they win in Sunday's much awaited late match. Marseille also went into the weekend on 47 but drew 1-1 at Rennes to pull within one point of Lyon. Swedish striker Ola Toivonen gave Rennes the lead after 26 minutes, smartly chesting down a loose ball to score past Steve Mandanda in the Marseille goal. Marseille were saved when Lucas Ocampos, the Argentine signed on loan from Monaco in the last moments of the transfer window, found the net in the 59th minute after coming on as a half-time substitute."
315,05/02/2015,00:09,Squillaci sends Bastia into final at expense of former club,Former France international Sebastien Squillaci's penalty secured unfashionable French Ligue 1 club Bastia a place in the League Cup final on Wednesday at the expense of the club where he made his name Monaco.,"The 34-year-old -- who was part of the Monaco team that reached the 2004 Champions League final -- tucked away his spot kick to give Bastia victory in the penalty shootout 7-6 after the match finished 0-0 after extra-time. Bastia -- who have won just one trophy in their history the 1981 French Cup though they were finalists in the 1978 UEFA Cup, 1995 League Cup and the 1972 and 2002 French Cup -- will play holders Paris Saint Germain in the April 11 final at the Stade de France. PSG, who beat Lille 1-0 on Tuesday, will be bidding for revenge as the Corsican side inflicted a surprise 4-2 defeat on them in January in the league match. PSG's win came courtesy of a superb goal by Brazilian fullback Maxwell. The French champions dominated the game and their goal was a worthy winner on 27 minutes when Maxwell blasted a fierce shot into the corner leaving Lille's Nigerian 'keeper Vincent Enyeama no chance. The joy at reaching the final was tempered somewhat as PSG's star player Swedish striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic tried to persuade several of his team-mates to ignore the waiting press. ""Follow me follow me. Nobody talks. Zlatan is the boss,"" Ibrahimovic said in English as he led a group comprising among others Maxwell, Edinson Cavani and Brazilian Lucas out of the dressingroom. While a smiling Ibrahimovic progressed serenely through the mixed zone Brazilian star Lucas disobeyed and stopped to speak with the press speaking in Portuguese. ""We're the Cup holders and we had the heart to defend that,"" said PSG coach Laurent Blanc. ""We had to win here (Lille) first and that's done but what pleases me most is not only the victory but also what we offered against a team that really dug in. ""We didn't give them hope even if the score was only 1-0 and my team played some really good stuff which will serve us in good stead for the future but we still have to progress,"" added the former Bordeaux and France coach. The victory keeps PSG on track for a quartet of trophies with a Champions League last-16 tie against Chelsea on February 17 and a last-16 French Cup fixture against Nantes lying ahead. The capital club also have the chance to go top of Ligue 1 on Sunday when they attempt to overturn a two point deficit on Lyon when the teams meet at the Stade Gerland. ""We have a lot of matches and it's going to be a marathon but let's hope it continues as long as possible. I hope that March will be complicated and the marathon continues into April and May which will mean we're advancing in all competitions."" concluded Blanc."
316,01/02/2015,23:53,Gritty Lyon stay top after Monaco deadlock,Lyon saw their lead at the top of Ligue 1 cut to two points on Sunday but may count themselves fortunate to have come away from resurgent Monaco with a 0-0 draw.,"Seven straight wins prior to Sunday saw Lyon surge to the top of the French League, where they have 49 points, but title rivals Marseille and Paris Saint Germain are both on 47 after wins for both this weekend. Earlier Sunday, Saint Etienne went down 1-0 away to relegation strugglers Caen, but they stay fourth on 40 points, ahead of Monaco on goal difference. Monaco have much to regret as Bulgarian veteran Dimitar Berbatov missed the best chance of the first half when heading onto the post from the six yard line with Lyon 'keeper Anthony Lopez stranded. Perhaps even more fortunately Moutinho's stunning 50th minute free-kick was then disallowed after it flew into the goal without another player touching it. Referee Benoit Millot had signalled it was an indirect free-kick. Hubert Fournier, the Lyon coach, was content with the result saying: ""The least you can say is we left Monaco with a nine- point lead over them."" ""But we needed a great deal of spirit and teamwork to get this draw even if we edged the first half they got better as the game advanced,"" he added. Monaco coach Leonardo Jardim however felt his side should have won. ""We had two great chances and we should have won. I'm not happy, but it was an even game in the end."" Monaco's Croatian 'keeper Danijel Subasic has now gone 791 minutes, a record in the French top flight this season, without conceding a goal and played a key role in keeping the scores level in the first half. He first saved a fierce long range drive from France international midfielder Yoann Gourcuff, cut the angle to deny Nabil Fekir from close range, and then stretched to parry a Corentin Tolisso free-kick all in the first half. Both sides also lost key defenders with Lyon's Serbian enforcer Milan Bisevac twisting a knee and Monaco's Italian central defender Andrea Raggi also picking up a knock. Raggi ripped off part of the Monaco dug out structure in his anger as he left the field and it was revealed after the game he had knee ligament damage that will keep him out at least six weeks. In the Sunday afternoon game defender Clement Chantome made his debut for Bordeaux after closing a 15-year chapter with Paris Saint Germain with a transfer on Friday. But his side drew 1-1 with Guingamp, whose striker Claudio Beauvue's 11th league goal of the season was a peach, twisting on the edge of the area before dispatching a stunning shot into the bottom corner to open the scores on 28 minutes. Maxime Poundje's equaliser for Bordeaux on 56 minutes also helped justify the price of a match ticket, with a determined run and fierce shot. Marseille climbed back to second on Saturday with a hard-fought 1-0 home win over plucky Evian. The victory was secured when Andre-Pierre Gignac converted a 49th minute penalty, for his 14th goal of the season, after referee Frank Schneider awarded Marseille a controversial spot-kick when Dimitri Payet took a slight knock in the box. On Friday, Ezequiel Lavezzi scored the only goal as champions Paris Saint-Germain edged Rennes 1-0 rounding off a fabulous piece of teamwork from the capital outfit. The goal came on 29 minutes after a neat interchange of passes down the left between Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who was involved twice, Adrien Rabiot and Javier Pastore. The win was PSG's sixth consecutive home win in all competitions while stretching their Ligue 1 record at the Parc des Princes to eight wins and three draws. In other games Lille took a share of the spoils at Nantes in a 1-1 draw, Metz and Nice ended scoreless, Toulouse beat Reims 1-0 at home and Bastia drew 1-1 at Lens."

""Bernardo Silva is one of the talented young players around whom Monaco plan to build the future,"" vice-president Vadim Vasilyev said on the club website. ""He has already demonstrated his potential to our supporters this season and it was important for us to keep hold of him."""

""The team gave a frank response to the critics, and especially to people in France who said at the start of the season that we weren't up to the level needed to qualify,"" said coach Leonardo Jardim, who has also come in for criticism for his side's stuttering domestic form. They will find out their opponents in the first knockout round of the Champions League on Monday, with Juventus, Arsenal and Manchester City all potentially lying in wait. But now Jardim's team can focus on trying to climb the Ligue 1 table and close the seven-point gap currently separating them from the top three. Marseille are a point clear of Paris Saint-Germain at the summit, although they have failed to win any of their last four away games between league and cup. ""It will be difficult against Marseille, but the victory (against Zenit) has given us confidence and I hope we can produce another good performance on Sunday,"" said young forward Anthony Martial. He could feature at the Stade Louis II as Dimitar Berbatov is sidelined after coming off injured against Zenit. Layvin Kurzawa and Geoffrey Kondogbia are also ruled out. Reigning champions PSG go to Guingamp on Sunday with the intention of bouncing back after seeing their record as the last unbeaten team in any of Europe's leading nations this season ended in a 3-1 defeat in Barcelona on Wednesday. ""We have three matches left before the winter break, then we will try to recuperate during the holidays,"" said PSG coach Laurent Blanc, whose side should be too strong for their struggling hosts in Brittany, especially as Guingamp will be feeling the effects of a trip to Greece for a decisive Europa League match against PAOK on Thursday. Elsewhere, Lyon can strengthen their grip on third place with a win when they entertain struggling Caen on Friday. Hubert Fournier's side have lost just one of their last 13 Ligue 1 games after a dreadful start to the campaign, and are seeking an eighth consecutive home win when they meet the men from Normandy. ""We have been extremely focused since the start of September because of what happened in August,"" said Fournier, whose side have been led by 13-goal Alexandre Lacazette, Ligue 1's leading scorer. ""What we mustn't do is think that the hardest part has been done, but I've not seen any signs to suggest that is the mood."" OL's great rivals Saint-Etienne, who are fourth, have not lost in eight league games but go to Nice on Sunday on the back of a long trip to Ukraine for a crucial Europa League tie against Dnipro. On Saturday, fifth-placed Bordeaux travel up the west coast to meet Nantes in the Atlantic derby. Nantes may boast home advantage but they have lost momentum after suffering three consecutive defeats, including a 2-1 reverse at PSG last time out. ""This is an important match against a team who are in good form at the moment. They have great attacking potential and score a lot of goals, so if we are to get a result we will need to rediscover our strength at the back,"" said Nantes coach Michel Der Zakarian, although the visitors could be without Cheick Diabate. The giant Malian striker, who has scored eight goals already this season, saw a specialist in Marseille this week about a persistent knee problem. Fixtures (kick-offs 1900GMT unless stated)"

320,09/12/2014,22:44,Monaco beat Zenit to reach Last 16,Goals by Aymen Abdennour and Fabinho secured French side Monaco a 2-0 win over Zenit St Petersburg and a place in the knockout stages of the Champions League for the first time since 2004 the year they reached the final.,"The French side -- who scored just five goals in the six group games -- also finished top of the group as Bayer Leverkusen drew 0-0 away away against Benfica, who finished bottom of the group with Zenit left with the bitter consolation of the Europa League spot. The opening 15 minutes were a cagey affair although Zenit did mmanage to work one promising chance but Jose Rondon's shot from inside the area was well blocked by Brazilian Under-21 international defender Wallace. Monaco were doing the job in terms of keeping Zenit at bay and only occasionally went on the counter-attack, their best one being a determined run from former France midfielder Jeremy Toulalan with his shot after cutting inside from the right, going just wide of the near post. It was Monaco goalkeeper Danijel Subasic who had to make the first save of the match, which the spectators had to wait 40 minutes for, getting down to save a Nicolas Lombaerts header. Monaco front man Dimitar Berbatov, who had barely had a touch of the ball, was forced off shortly before the hour mark with what looked like a rib injury, as he had an ice pack strapped to them shortly after taking his place on the bench. However, his team-mates more than made up for his departure by taking the lead in the 63rd minute, Tunisian Aymen Abdennour rising to head home Yannick Ferreira-Carrasco's beautifully delivered freekick -- only the third goal of their campaign -- to give Prince Albert II of Monaco, sitting in the stands, reason to smile. Zenit went desperately close to levelling with 20 minutes remaining as Hulk's curling freekick from long range crept over the bar, but Monaco too used the extra space being left at the back as the visitors pressed for an equaliser and Moroccan midfielder Nabil Dirar sent a fizzing shot just wide of the far post. The hosts doubled their lead and ensured they took their place in the last 16 draw as Fabinho fired home a left-footed shot two minutes from time provoking Prince Albert on this occasion to get up from his seat in celebration."

Leonardo Jardim's side have spent most of the season playing catch-up with their rivals at the top of Ligue 1 but this win is a timely boost ahead of Tuesday's home Champions League clash with Zenit St Petersburg, in which a draw will be enough to take them through to the last 16. Monaco have significant selection problems in defence that will continue to cause concern when the Russian side come calling, with Ricardo Carvalho, Layvin Kurzawa and Elderson Echiejile sidelined as well as midfielder Geoffrey Kondogbia. With young Brazilian Wallace suspended for the trip to south-west France, Aymen Abdennour was partnered in the heart of the defence against his former club by midfielder Jeremy Toulalan. Nevertheless, the makeshift back four kept a clean sheet while Berbatov made it three goals in his last two games after previously not finding the net since August. After Bernardo Silva had an effort cleared off the line by Dragos Grigore, Berbatov opened the scoring right on half-time with a sweet finish across goalkeeper Ali Ahamada after neatly controlling Anthony Martial's centre. Ahamada saved from Silva right at the start of the second period but Monaco eventually doubled their lead with 13 minutes left, Berbatov coolly converting a penalty awarded for a foul on Fabinho. Reigning champions Paris Saint-Germain, who go to Barcelona in the Champions League next midweek, currently trail leaders Marseille by a point but can go provisionally top of the table with the right result when they host Nantes on Saturday. Marseille are looking for an eighth consecutive home win when they face Metz on Sunday evening."

Argentina's Lucas Ocampos slotted home Monaco's winner at Leverkusen's BayArena with their only clear shot of the game to stun the hosts on 72 minutes. ""We were well prepared and we knew their game. We knew they would tire in the second half,"" said Monaco's ex-Leverkusen striker Dimitar Berbatov. ""We seized our only chance and one goal is enough for tonight, everyone is happy."" Having frustrated the Werkself for 70 minutes, Leonardo Jardim's Monaco dealt Leverkusen a heavy blow when midfielder Nabil Dirar supplied a superb cross which Ocampos fired home from close range. ""If you saw the game, you can only be hugely disappointed with the result,"" said Schmidt. ""Monaco believed in the lucky punch and their goal came from what looked like a harmless situation. ""Now we need to get something from the final game at Benfica."" The result means just two points separate the group's top three teams with Leverkusen on nine, Monaco second on eight and Andre Villas-Boas's Zenit third on seven points. It means Monaco can finish as group winners if they beat Zenit at home in a fortnight in a winner-takes-all match when Leverkusen are away to bottom side Benfica. The visitors' defenders Aymen Abdennour and Ricardo Carvalho impressed at the back, but the latter picked up a yellow card which means he is suspended for the crucial Zenit match. The result capped a bad round for Germany's Champions League sides as Bayern Munich lost at Manchester City, Borussia Dortmund were beaten at Arsenal and Schalke were hammered 5-0 at home to Chelsea. Leverkusen failed in their pre-match promise to avenge their 1-0 defeat at Monaco in September's opening round, which had been settled by Portugal's Joao Moutinho. The winning goal on 72 minutes at Leverkusen came after some great work on the right flank from veteran ex-Manchester United forward Berbatov. The 33-year-old dribbled through a posse of Leverkusen defenders and freed Dirar, who motored down the sideline before swinging in a superb cross for Ocampos, the only Monaco forward in support, to bury. It was the visitor's first real chance of the game as Leverkusen were punished for their lack of finishing, having dominated the game for large stretches. Germany international Lars Bender hit the crossbar in the first half as his Leverkusen side dominated with eight shots on goal to Monaco's none. Bayer's replacement Swiss striker Josip Drmic, on after an hour for South Korea's Son Heung-Min, fired wide with the game's best chance on 66 minutes. Drmic went close again late on when he skipped through three tackles but could only poke his shot towards Danijel Subasic in the Monaco goal."

Leverkusen are looking to avenge their 1-0 opening day defeat away at Monaco last September when Portugal's Joao Moutinho netted the winner. The German league side have won all three games since, defeating Zenit Saint Petersburg both home (2-0) and away (2-1), while bottom side Benfica were also beaten 3-1 at the BayArena. Monaco have struggled in their last three games, having been held to goalless draws both at Zenit, then at home to Benfica, before losing 1-0 to the group's bottom side in Portugal. Berbatov, who has recovered from a groin injury, says they must improve. ""Just a goal may be enough to make us happy,"" said the 33-year-old in Tuesday's press conference. ""We won (in September), but it was difficult, they had a lot of chances, but did not finish them while we took our chance. ""Hopefully we won't make the same mistakes we have in the other matches and if we can correct them, I think we can get something here. We still want to qualify."" Having played for Leverkusen from 2001-2006 before playing for Manchester United, Tottenham Hotspur and Fulham in the Premier League, Berbatov said he was pleased to be back at Bayer. ""I came here with Tottenham and now with Monaco,"" said Berbatov. ""For me, it's like coming home, I had a great time here and I'm glad to see the progress they have made. ""I regularly watch their games."""

Berbatov, who has recovered from a groin injury, says they must improve. ""Just a goal may be enough to make us happy,"" said the 33-year-old in Tuesday's press conference. ""We won (in September), but it was difficult, they had a lot of chances, but did not finish them while we took our chance. ""Hopefully we won't make the same mistakes we have in the other matches and if we can correct them, I think we can get something here. We still want to qualify."" Having played for Leverkusen from 2001-2006 before playing for Manchester United, Tottenham Hotspur and Fulham in the Premier League, Berbatov said he was pleased to be back at Bayer. ""I came here with Tottenham and now with Monaco,"" said Berbatov. ""For me, it's like coming home, I had a great time here and I'm glad to see the progress they have made. ""I regularly watch their games."""
325,25/11/2014,02:02,Leverkusen out for revenge against Monaco,Group C leaders Bayer Leverkusen need a point against Monaco on Wednesday to take their place in the Champions League's last 16 as they look to avenge their away defeat.,"Portugal's Joao Moutinho scored the winner in the tiny principality when Monaco celebrated their return to Europe after an absence of eight years with a 1-0 victory over Leverkusen in September. The Monaco defeat was the only time Leverkusen have dropped points in the group stages and the hosts are just one point from the knockout phase. ""Against Monaco, we want to make our claim for a place in the knockout round,"" insisted Leverkusen goalkeeper Bernd Leno. Bayer have won all three games since losing at Monaco, defeating Zenit Saint Petersburg both home (2-0) and away (2-1), while bottom side Benfica were also beaten 3-1 at the BayArena. Bayer will be looking to pick up where they left off three weeks ago when South Korea striker Son Heung-Min claimed his first Champions League double in their 2-1 win in St Petersburg. With a four-point lead at the top of their group, Roger Schmidt's Leverkusen are in pole position to reach the last-16. Monaco have struggled since their opening day win, having been held to goalless draws at Zenit, then at home to Benfica, before losing 1-0 to the group's bottom side in Portugal. The stats favour a home win, especially as Monaco have failed to score in five of their last six Champions League away games. Leonardo Jardim's Monaco have managed just two wins in their last ten games in all competitions, and six in 18 as a whole this season. Leverkusen, who reached the 2002 Champions League final, where they were beaten by Real Madrid, have won four of their seven games at home to French league sides and have lost just one of their last 12 matches in all competitions. Bayer will not face Dimitar Berbatov, who played for them from 2001 until 2006, scoring 68 goals in 154 Bundesliga matches, as the Bulgarian international has a groin injury. Leverkusen's only casualties are midfielder Stefan Reinartz, who is nursing a fractured cheek, and defender Kyriakos Papadopoulos, who has a shoulder injury. Brazilian left-back Wendell is set to return to the side after serving a one-game suspension having been sent off in the home win over Zenit. Schmidt also welcomes back Simon Rolfes and Gonzalo Castro into the defensive midfield after injury. Germany striker Stefan Kiessling will be looking to get on the scoresheet again having ended a run of 859 minutes without a Bundesliga goal as Leverkusen won 3-1 at Hannover 96 on Saturday. Monaco have been on the rise in recent years since Russian businessmen Dmitry Rybolovlev, one of the top 120 richest people on the planet, acquired a majority stake in the club. He invested 180 million euros of talent into the team after Monaco were promoted back to France's top-flight in 2013 under Italian coach Claudio Ranieri."
326,04/11/2014,23:08,Talisca revives Benfica's Champions League knockout hopes,A goal by impressive young Brazilian Talisca revived Portuguese champions Benfica's hopes of reaching the Champions League knock-out stages for the first time in three seasons as it secured a 1-0 win over Monaco.,"Talisca, 20, struck eight minutes from time in an entertaining match which saw the French side slip to their first defeat in seven matches and saw Benfica record their first win of this season's competition to move on to four points, still bottom of the table but just one point off second-placed Monaco. Leaders Bayer Leverkusen, who beat Zenit St Petersburg 2-1 earlier on Tuesday, are four points clear of Monaco with two games remaining. With Monaco's former Bulgarian international striker Dimitar Berbatov out with the groin injury he suffered in the first match between the two sides a fortnight ago, Lacina Traore came in for his first start in the competition. Benfica had the first opening of the game, which failed to attract a packed house, but Eduardo Salvio, superbly set up by Talisca, scuffed his shot wide of the far post with Croatian goalkeeper Danijel Subasic beaten. While the hosts had the majority of possession, they found it difficult to fashion chances and had to wait till the final minute of the half for their best opportunity as Nicolas Gaitan worked some space only for his goalbound effort to be deflected for a corner by the outstretched boot of Andre Raggi. Monaco started the second-half brightly but Layvin Kurzawa should have done better with a free header while down the other end Subasic produced an excellent save to turn away Talisca's fierce effort from outside the area. Benfica's Brazilian international goalkeeper Julio Cesar saved his side on the hour mark as he got down to stop Argentinian Lucas Carrasco's shot after he had wriggled free of the attentions of his marker. Monaco, emboldened by this, went close again in the 68th minute as Traore let rip with a fine curling effort from the edge of the area only for it to drift just wide of the far post. However, it was the hosts who broke the deadlock as Monaco left two Benfica players unmarked in the area for Derley's freekick and Talisca made them pay dearly firing in left-footed at the far post for his third goal in the last three games."
327,24/10/2014,02:15,Marseille chase new record as PSG tackle Bordeaux,Ligue 1 leaders Marseille chase a club record ninth consecutive victory on Sunday when they travel to Lyon while defending champions Paris Saint-Germain are in action at home to Bordeaux 24 hours earlier.,"Marcelo Bielsa's new look Marseille side have been the talk of French football after a blistering start to their campaign and the question is now whether they can protect a seven point advantage and go all the way to a tenth league title. PSG are their closest rivals and remain the only unbeaten side in the division but six draws in ten matches has seen them lose ground on Bielsa's men, who are shaping up as serious title contenders. OM striker Andre-Pierre Gignac has been the star man with ten goals in as many matches, including one in their most recent 2-0 victory over Toulouse at the Velodrome, a streak that also earned the 28-year-old a recall to the France team. Few would have bet against Laurent Blanc's two-time defending champions going on to win a third crown but Marseille appear to be the real deal after Argentine Bielsa came in at the beginning of the season and revamped their style of play. The capital club know that if the gap is not reduced this weekend, the importance on the clash between the two sides at the Parc des Princes on November 9 will take on increased significance. They will also be without key striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic who is still struggling with a heel injury. Marseille have won eight matches in a row on two occasions, back in 1937 and 1998, but it was Lyon who snapped their streak last time out. And the fourth-placed hosts at the Stade Gerland are themselves unbeaten in six and coming off a 5-1 thrashing of Montpellier last Sunday. Third-placed Bordeaux come into their clash level on points with PSG but low on confidence after a 1-1 home draw against lowly Caen last Sunday. ""We know how good Paris are and we know their players,"" said Bordeaux coach Willy Sagnol, who is in his first season in charge of a top flight club. ""The advantage about going to Paris is that we have nothing to lose and everything to win. I want the players to take risks to go for victory in Paris because we don't have a team to defend,"" added the former international full-back. ""We'll be looking to get a result with open play and grab some goals but we've got to raise our level and it's going to be a packed stadium. We are playing a team with an international stature but I prefer to concede five goals by at least trying to take the game to them."" concluded Sagnol. Should Marseille triumph in Lyon and set a new record for victories, they would be two short of Bordeaux's single-season record of 11 achieved on the way to the 2009 Ligue 1 crown, under Blanc, while the Girodins also have the overall record for wins at 14, chalked up between March and August 2009. In other matches, fifth-placed Saint-Etienne return from Europa League duty at Inter Milan and host Metz on Sunday while a busy Saturday slate features Bastia at home to Monaco, Lorient at Caen, Reims take on Montpellier in the Champagne region and sixth-placed Nantes are on the road at Evian. Sunday's early match takes place at Rennes when Lille are in Brittany while Nice travel to Guingamp. The weekend programme begins Friday with Toulouse hosting rock-bottom Lens.

""Dimitar Berbatov has a muscle injury to his left thigh,"" a club statement announced. ""He is expectged to be out for three weeks."""
329,22/10/2014,22:55,Monaco held by Benfica in scoreless stalemate,Monaco and Benfica played out a dismal Champions League 0-0 draw on Wednesday in a result that significently tightens up Group C.,"The French side now have five points and are one behind Bundesliga side Bayer Leverkusen, who defeated Zenit St. Petersburg 2-0, to leave the Russians on four and Benfica now on one point after three matches. Monaco were taking on Portuguese opposition for the first time since they lost the 2004 Champions League final against Jose Mourinho's Porto in Germany when current France coach Didier Deschamps was in charge of the Cote d'Azur club. Deschamps was in the stands at the Louis II stadium on Wednesday and must have been wondering what had happened to his former team in a dire 90 minutes of poor quality football that saw the visitors finish the match with ten men. Benfica, who have lost the past two Europa League finals against Chelsea and Sevilla respectively, had the better second half chances before central defender Lisandro Lopez was shown a straight red card with 15 minutes left. Prior to Lopez's moment of madness, when he went in with an ugly challenge on Joao Moutinho, Jorge Jesus's side were denied on several occasions by the excellent Monaco 'keeper Danijel Subasic. Monaco defender Andrea Raggi could have snatched victory in injury time when he had a clear header from six yards out but under pressure steered the ball wide. The first 45 minutes produced a sign of things to come as both teams clogged up the midfield and played it safe at the back. Argentine Lucas Ocampos had the best chance for both teams when set up by Dimitar Berbatov after 18 minutes but the former River Plate striker was unable to control a bouncing ball and skied his shot over the bar when faced with an open goal. Monaco suffered a further blow 11 minutes before half-time when Berbatov pulled up lame with what appeared to be a groin injury and immediately waved to the bench that he was unable to continue. Benfica were workmanlike in their approach but naive in the attack and one of their few early chances fell to Eduardo Salvio who found himself alone at the far post but failed to test home Subasic as he blasted wide. The second half was equally tight with Monaco producing only one shot on target throughout the match while Benfica were equally impotent. The two sides will now meet again in Lisbon on November 4 while Leverkusen travel to Zenit the same evening."
330,18/10/2014,22:12,Monaco and St. Etienne climb in Ligue 1,"Monaco continued their mini-revival, and set down a marker for their midweek Champions League home tie against Benfica with a 2-0 victory over Evian in Ligue 1 action on Saturday.","Under-pressure Monaco coach Leonardo Jardim looked on as last season's runners-up picked up a fourth win in ten matches to move within three points of the top three. Marseille will carry a four point lead over Paris Saint-Germain into their home tie against Toulouse on Sunday after Laurent Blanc's defending champions saw off nine-man Lens 3-1 on Friday. Saint-Etienne now trail third placed Bordeaux only on goal difference after they edged Lorient 1-0 in the afternoon fixture. Portutuese international midfielder Joao Moutinho slotted home for Monaco from the penalty spot in just the second minute as the 2013 French Cup finalists fell behind early on. Yannick Ferreira-Carrasco then tapped home from close range after Evian's Danish goalkeeper Jesper Hansen inexplicably allowed Ricardo Carvalho's innocent lob to bounce over his head. Elsewhere, ten-man Guingamp ended their four game losing streak with a desperate 2-1 victory at Lille. Goals either side of half-time from Claudio Beauvue and Ronnie Schwartz gave the Brittany side only their third win of the season and lifted them off the bottom of the table. Lille pulled a goal back with 12 minutes left when Riu Mavuba scrambled the ball home after a mixup in the Guingamp penalty area but it wasn't enough, despite defender Benjamin Brou Angoua seeing red for the away side with four minutes remaining. Nantes took the lead at home to struggling Reims when Johan Audel hit the back of the net after just 13 minutes but a superb curling free-kick from Diego levelled the match at 1-1, 13 minutes into the second half. The point kept Nantes in sole possession of fifth place. ""It's a shame we gave up the equaliser from a set-piece but we were suffering tonight (Saturday),"" said Nantes coach Michel Der Zakarian. ""We gave up more opportunites to the opposition in this match than we have in all our other matches combined. Physically we suffered and technically they were better than us especially in the way they used the ball. On the whole, we did very well to get a draw."" he added. On the Cote d'Azur, Claude Makelele, the former assistant coach to Blanc at PSG, saw his Bastia side take the lead six minutes after half-time at Nice when Floyd Ayite found the target. Despite a furious fightback from mid-table Nice, the Corsicans held on for only their second win of the season and some welcome relief for former Real Madrid and Chelsea midfielder Makelele. The match was marred by a mini pitch invasion from disgruntled Nice fans at full-time, although the situation was swiftly brought under control. Meanwhile, Metz and Rennes battled to a 0-0 draw in the northeast of France. In the afternoon match, Saint-Etienne got back to winning ways after two defeats and two draws in their last four outings, with a late winning goal at Lorient. Midfielder Fabien Lemoine was the hero for Christophe Galtier's side as he popped up in the 87th minute to fire home after the visitors had dominated possession for the majority of the 90 minutes. The victory takes the 'Green Devils' up to joint third in the table as they try to get their quest back on track for a first French title since 1981. For Lorient, it was their sixth defeat in ten matches and keeps them camped just above the bottom three. Sunday's action sees leaders Marseille attempt to extend their advantage at the top when they host midtable Toulouse in the early match while Bordeaux await relegation threatened Caen and Montpellier travel to Lyon in the final match of the weekend."
331,05/10/2014,23:10,Monaco's Martial law holds PSG,"Anthony Martial scored an injury time equaliser for Monaco as a tired looking and injury stricken Paris Saint-Germain were held 1-1 at the Parc des Princes Sunday, their sixth draw in nine French league games.","Paris had been playing out the game after a Lucas Moura 70th-minute strike looked liked giving the capital side a much needed win. But Brazil defender David Luiz lamely tapped the ball into Martial's path deep into injury time and the 18-year-old made no mistake. Runaway leaders Marseille now have 22 points after their seventh straight win Saturday, 2-1 away at Caen, Bordeaux, who lost 1-0 at Reims, have 17 points while PSG, Lille and Nantes are all on 15. The game had seemed set for a 0-0 deadlock with PSG drained from a thrilling 3-2 win over Barcelona in the Champions League midweek and Monaco having earned a hard-fought draw at Zenit St Petersburg also jaded. But an unmarked Moura side-footed home unmarked from the edge of the six-yard box in the 70th minute after fine work from man-of-the-match, Argentine midfielder Javier Pastore. The first half was uneventful until Maxwell's cross on 37 minutes went begging as a sluggish Edinson Cavani arrived slightly late for a simple nod in. PSG were left to thank Salvatore Sirigu's reflexes after he then finger-tipped a Yannick Ferreira Carrasco snap-shot onto the crossbar on 43 minutes to hold the score to 0-0 at half-time. Veteran Zoumana Camara and Luiz were kept busy, but were never panicked by the Monaco forward line. Pastore put Cavani in just before the hour with a deft through ball only to see the Uruguayan run through with perfect timing and miss the ball completely. Defender Andrea Raggi thought he's scored a few moments later but Gregory Van Der Weil appeared from nowhere to clear off the line with Sirugu on the floor. Earlier Sunday Lyon cruised to a 3-0 victory over Lille at their Stade Gerland thanks to a hat-trick from France international striker Alexandre Lacazette. Lille had to play without eight first choice players and also had their coach Rene Girard sent off for the second time this season. They have now lost twice and drawn one of their last three league games. For Lyon, former France player of the year Yoann Gourcuff finally got a place in the starting line-up as his form comes back and he set up the first goal for Lacazette in the 39th minute. The 23-year-old striker with three France caps took his league tally to seven with another strike just on half-time and his hat-trick put the gloss on a fine days work when he wrapped up victory with six minutes to play. Saint-Etienne could have climbed to second place above Bordeaux with a home win but lost 1-0 at home to Toulouse thanks to Wissam Ben Yedder's sixth Ligue 1 goal this season. Saint Etienne have suffered two defeats and a draw in their last three league outings. Also Sunday Nantes teenager Georges-Kévin Nkoudou grabbed the winner that took the Canaries up to fifth after edging Guingamp 1-0 in the Brittany derby."
332,03/10/2014,16:29,Berbatov sidelined for Monaco against PSG,Monaco's Bulgarian striker Dimitar Berbatov will miss Sunday's Ligue 1 clash at Paris Saint-Germain after suffering an ankle injury in midweek European action.,"""Berbatov won't be available to play at Paris,"" Monaco coach Leonardo Jardim confirmed on Friday. Berbatov was replaced by Yannick Ferreira Carrasco after picking up the right ankle injury in the second half of the goalless draw at Zenit St Petersburg in the Champions League. Monaco are already without suspended Jeremy Toulalan. ""The team has lost two important players,"" said Jardim. ""But the most important is the team and the equilibrium. I have confidence in the players who will replace them."" Tiemoue Bakayoko should replace Toulalan in midfield with Jardim having several choices to replace Dimitar Berbatov, with Valere Germain, Lucas Ocampos or Anthony Martial. Monaco are languishing in 12th place in the league with 10 points from eight games."
333,03/10/2014,02:15,Monaco next up for PSG after Barcelona triumph,"A meeting of Paris Saint-Germain and Monaco might not carry the same allure that it did just a few months ago, but for Laurent Blanc's side it is a chance to really kick-start their domestic campaign.","PSG come into Sunday's encounter at the Parc des Princes fresh from an exhilarating 3-2 victory over Barcelona in the Champions League in midweek, a result that Blanc admitted was possibly his best since being appointed as coach last year. ""I will remember this win, as will the players and all those who were at the stadium. We do this job to live nights like these,"" he said. ""We hope this really launches our season. It can serve as a reference point for us to build from."" The champions are still unbeaten this season, but have drawn five of their eight Ligue 1 games so far and come into October five points behind leaders Marseille. They also have injury problems -- top scorer Zlatan Ibrahimovic has missed the last three matches with a heel complaint and the Swede faces a race against time to be fit to face Monaco. Captain Thiago Silva and Ezequiel Lavezzi are still out and Blanc admitted that Marquinhos struggled through to the end of the Barcelona clash with a similar problem. ""Marquinhos felt pain in his thigh and played the whole second half with that pain,"" he said. However, Monaco are themselves worrying about the fitness of Bulgarian striker Dimitar Berbatov, who has an injured ankle. The principality club have unsurprisingly toiled since seeing star duo James Rodriguez and Radamel Falcao depart without being replaced. That means that a fixture that was so eagerly anticipated last season is perhaps no longer the biggest showdown in the French game, but there is still no shortage of intrigue. If PSG are unhappy at being in fourth place, Leonardo Jardim's side languish in 12th and were beaten 1-0 at home by local rivals Nice last week. However, they did boost morale with an excellent draw at Zenit St Petersburg in the Champions League on Wednesday and now Jardim is hoping they can reproduce their European form in Ligue 1. ""It's easier for the manager to motivate the players in the Champions League,"" he acknowledged after the draw in Russia. ""The team played well, had a good 90 minutes with lots of quality and intensity. I think the team can play like this in the domestic league too."" Paris could be even further off the pace at the top by the time they kick off on Sunday, with leaders Marseille chasing a seventh consecutive win when they go to Caen a day earlier. Marcelo Bielsa has already transformed a side that failed to qualify for Europe last season and are now being tipped by some observers as genuine title contenders. Dimitri Payet, who scored in last weekend's 2-1 defeat of Saint-Etienne, is a doubt for the visit to Normandy because of an ankle knock, but Bielsa believes complacency could be his side's biggest enemy. ""One of the most important qualities that a footballer must have is knowing to capitalise on the effects of a favourable run of results,"" said Bielsa. ""Sometimes it generates more confidence or allows a player's qualities to shine through more easily, but sometimes the players start to think things will continue in the same way without them putting in the effort."" Bordeaux, who are two points behind OM in second, can go provisionally top with a win at struggling Reims on Friday. On Sunday, Lyon, who are unbeaten in four, can move to within a point of third-placed Lille by beating the northern side at the Stade de Gerland. Saint-Etienne entertain Toulouse on Sunday while Metz, who are fifth, go to an Evian side in the bottom three. Fixtures (kick-offs 1800GMT unless stated)"
334,25/09/2014,22:45,UEFA opens financial probes against seven clubs,"UEFA announced on Thursday that it had opened probes against Monaco, Roma, Besiktas, Inter Milan, Liverpool and Russian club Krasnodar for suspected breaches of financial fair play rules.","In a statement, European football's governing body said that the seven clubs' accounts for 2012 and 2013 had shown a ""break-even deficit"". As a result, UEFA said that its Club Financial Control Body (CFCB) investigatory chamber had decided to launch formal investigations. ""These clubs will need to submit additional monitoring information during October and November upon the deadlines set by the CFCB, subsequent to which an additional communication will be made and conservatory measures may be imposed,"" it said. The principle of financial ""fair play"" is to prevent clubs accruing losses in excess of a 45-million-euro limit over the course of two seasons. The goal is to stop clubs from trying to buy success by concerning the transfer market while also racking up huge debts that could threaten the health of the game. UEFA sanctions for wrongdoers include withholding prize money from European competitions. On Thursday, UEFA said that the CFCB had decided to withhold prize money from five clubs involved in this season's European competitions due to ""important overdue payables"" to other clubs, employees or their national tax authorities. The five clubs were Turkey's Bursaspor, Romanian teams Cluj and Astra Giurgi, Montenegrin capital side Podgorica, and Lithuania's Ekranas. UEFA noted that the decision to withhold the prize money -- the amount of which was not revealed -- was a provisional move pending further investigation and would remain in force until December. Other penalties can include transfer-market restrictions and fines. Big-spending Manchester City and Paris Saint-Germain were among nine clubs sanctioned last season for overspending on player transfers and wages and fined 60 million euros. ""Overall, and including the clubs already mentioned above and the nine clubs which have signed settlement agreements last season, 115 clubs will remain under monitoring,"" UEFA said. It said that the financial fair play rules had proven their mettles, with overdue sums decreasing from 57 million euros in June 2011 to eight million euros in the same month this year. In addition, aggregate losses reported by Europe's first-division clubs in the 2013 financial year have gone down to 800 million euros from a record-reported deficit of 1.7 billion euros in 2011, it said. Roma said they support the fair play initiative having overcome financial hurdles in recent years. ""Our current ownership took over a club in economic distress just three years ago and were very clear from the outset that our club would be run as a business in order to maximize economic success along with on-field performance,"" said a Roma statement. ""We are very proud of the economic and competitive accomplishments achieved in a very short time and are even more optimistic about our future. ""We look forward to a dialogue with UEFA and are confident they will recognize our accomplishments and consider us a model for future investment in European football."""
335,16/09/2014,22:56,Moutinho gives Monaco win on Champions League return,Monaco celebrated their return to the Champions League for the first time in a decade as they edged Bayer Leverkusen 1-0 in a hard-fought Group C encounter at the Stade Louis II on Tuesday.,"It was Monaco coach Leonardo Jardim's first home win since taking over from Claudio Ranieri after a difficult start to the season which has seen them win just once in Ligue 1, form that has left them in the relegation zone. The goal on 61 minutes came against the run of play when a swift Monaco counter-attack produced the opener thanks to a piece of brilliance from former Leverkusen striker Dimitar Berbatov. The Bulgarian, who played with Leverkusen from 2001 to 2006, cleverly nodded the ball into the path of Portuguese midfielder Joao Moutinho, who steered past Bernd Leno to put the the 2004 finalists into the lead. The goal handed last season's French league runners-up all three points while Russian leaders Zenit St Peterburg defeated Benfica 2-0 in Lisbon in the evening's other game in Group C. The teams had only met once before in European competition when a Monaco side, including Fabien Barthez, Thierry Henry and David Trezeguet, took four points off their German rivals during the 1997-98 group phase of the Champions League. Leverkusen, now coached by Roger Schmidt, who took over from former Liverpool defender Sami Hyypia, was pulling his hair out from the touchline as his side missed several first-half chances. Turkish international defender Omer Toprak was the first culprit when he fluffed a straightforward finish from just outside the six-yard box on 17 minutes and it got worse for Leverkusen 11 minutes from half-time with what should have been the opening goal. Karim Bellarabi broke in behind the Monaco back line only to somehow screw his attempted chip wide of Monaco 'keeper Danijel Subasic and almost out for a throw-in. Gonzalo Castro continued the comedy of errors in front of goal for Leverkusen on the stroke of half-time when, from point blank range, he saw his volley deflected over by Layvin Kurzawa. The visitors were then made to pay the price for their lack of a killer touch in front of goal when Moutinho struck for Monaco 16 minutes after the restart, and Leverkusen could not find a way back into the match."

But several media outlets, including the Press Association, the BBC and Sky Sports, reported that United had secured his services -- subject to a medical examination -- on the final day of the close-season transfer window. If completed, the deal would leave United manager Louis van Gaal with a rich pool of striking talent, as Falcao would join Robin van Persie and Wayne Rooney at Old Trafford."
337,31/08/2014,14:35,Europe's Big Five smash transfer window records,"England and Spain have led a record breaking summer transfer market by Europe's big five leagues worth well over $2 billion (1.5 billion euros, £1.2 billion), with more big deals looming before the window closes on Monday.","Radamel Falcao and Arturo Vidal are among the big names and Real Madrid and Manchester United in the big clubs touted for major deals on the final day of the transfer window when another $250 million of business could be done. ""This summer transfer window is one of records,"" said Dan Jones of the Deloitte consultancy's Sports Business Group. He highlighted that in the last two summer windows more than 20% of English Premier League clubs' spending occurred on deadline day. ""There is still potential for a significant increase"" in the record breaking spending already seen, he said. FIFA's transfer monitoring system said that by Sunday, $2.09 billion had been spent by top clubs in England, Spain, Germany, Italy and France, breaking last year's record of $2.02 billion. It said that England's Premier League accounted for more than 43% of the big five's spending, followed by Spain on more than 25% and Germany on about 10%. Italy and France follow, with spending down in both in Serie A and Ligue 1. According to Deloitte's figures, more than £725 million ($1.2 billion) had been spent by England's 20 Premier League clubs from June 9 up to Friday. That is already more than £100 million more than last year. British media said the figure had risen to nearly £750 million by Sunday, helped by Manchester United's £14 million plus purchase of Danny Blind from Ajax Amsterdam. Manchester United have been Europe's top spenders, laying out more than £140 million ($240 million) to buy Blind, Angel di Maria from Real Madrid for £59 million, Ander Herrera, Luke Shaw and Marcos Rojo. They have been linked with Vidal and other names before the transfer windown closes at 2200 GMT on Monday. Liverpool have also spent more than £115 million, mainly to buy Mario Balotelli, Adam Lallana and Dejan Lovren. Chelsea have laid out more than £75 (including Cesc Fabregas and Diego Costa) and Arsenal more than £62 million. English clubs have spent about $300 million on Spanish players. But, according to FIFA, Spain's current spending is closing on $600 million and already three times higher than last year's pre-season transfer window. A spending splurge by Real Madrid and Barcelona has accounted for the buying. Barcelona paid Liverpool more than $125 million for Luis Suarez, while Real Madrid spent a reported $108 million on Monaco's James Rodriguez and more than $35 million on German World Cup midfielder Toni Kroos. But after losing Xabi Alonso to Bayern Munich, Real are still in market for a big signing, according to club officials. Media reports Sunday linked Real to Falcao at Monaco and Manchester United's Mexican forward Javier Hernandez. Spending by Germany's cautious Bundesliga team is more than 25% up at nearly $300 million so far, according to FIFA's figures. But it is still way behind England and Spain. And Italy and France have seen dramatic falls in their spending, reflecting the state of their countries' economies and the impact of UEFA's Financial Fair Play regulations. Spending by Italian clubs approaching $200 million is 45% down on last year. AC Milan took Chelsea's Fernando Torres in a loan deal on Saturday. Top French sides Paris St Germain and Monaco have spent 75% less this year on new players than in the 2013 transfer window. The $67 million move by Brazilian defender David Luiz from Chelsea to Paris was the biggest purchase in France."
338,30/08/2014,16:44,Monaco leave out Falcao for Lille clash,Radamel Falcao was dropped at the last minute from Monaco's matchday squad for Saturday's Ligue 1 clash with Lille amid mounting speculation that the Colombian is on his way out of the principality club.,"Falcao started and scored the winning goal against Nantes last weekend and had been expected to start for Leonardo Jardim's team at the Stade Louis II. He was named in the squad, but took no part in the warm-up and was not even included among the substitutes. The former Atletico Madrid striker has been strongly linked with a move to Real Madrid on a season-long loan, but the reigning European champions will have to move quickly with the transfer window closing on Monday. afp"
339,17/08/2014,23:05,Monaco blown away by Bordeaux comeback,Monaco suffered a second defeat in as many games this season as Bordeaux came from behind to beat the principality club 4-1 in Ligue 1 on Sunday.,"Dimitar Berbatov gave the visitors the lead at the Stade Chaban-Delmas just before half-time, but having lost at home to Lorient last weekend, Leonardo Jardim's side collapsed in the face of a brilliant Bordeaux second-half performance. Two goals from Uruguayan striker Diego Rolan and penalties from Emiliano Sala and Wahbi Khazri made it two wins out of two for Les Girondins, who are top of the fledgling table with a maximum six points after a fine start under their new coach Willy Sagnol. Radamel Falcao was again left on the bench at kick-off for Monaco, although Jardim did make five changes to his team, including recalling Jeremy Toulalan in midfield. Goalkeeper Danijel Subasic had to beat away a Khazri free-kick, but Monaco took the lead in the final minute of the opening period when Valere Germain's right-wing cross was headed into the net at the far post by Bulgarian striker Berbatov. Sagnol, who played in the last Monaco side that won the title in 2000, reshuffled his tactical set-up at the break and Bordeaux required only three minutes to draw level, Rolan turning the ball in after Julien Faubert's cross had been headed back across goal by former Bayern Munich full-back Diego Contento. Argentine striker Sala, making his first Ligue 1 start, then scored from the penalty spot after Aymen Abdennour was harshly adjudged to have fouled his fellow Tunisian Khazri inside the area. Monaco sent on Falcao but they fell further behind in the 65th minute when Rolan, in an offside position, converted after Lamine Sane had headed on a free-kick. And there was worse to come with quarter of an hour remaining as Khazri scored from the spot after drawing a foul from Subasic just inside the box as the Monaco defence imploded. Saint-Etienne are the only other side to have won their opening two matches after they also came from behind to beat Reims 3-1 at the Stade Geoffroy-Guichard. Loic Perrin deflected a Benjamin Moukandjo shot into his own net to give Reims -- who held champions Paris Saint-Germain last week -- an interval lead, but Max-Alain Gradel, Kevin Monnet-Paquet and Mevlut Erding all found the net in the second half for Les Verts. However, like Jardim, new Marseille coach Marcelo Bielsa is finding the adaptation to life in Ligue 1 something of a challenge. After OM threw away a two-goal lead to draw 3-3 in Bastia last week, his first home game at the helm ended in a chorus of jeers after a deflating 2-0 defeat to southern rivals Montpellier, whose goals came from Anthony Mounier and Morgan Sanson. The Stade Velodrome was holding its first game since work finished on a new main stand, completing the refurbishment done for Euro 2016, which France will host, and the game was watched by a crowd of more than 50,000. ""I am not satisfied. One point out of six against opponents who are expected to finish in the bottom half is not a very good outcome,"" admitted Bielsa, although he added: ""I think there were more things of value in the match than things that we need to fix."" On Saturday, PSG brushed aside SC Bastia 2-0 with Lucas and Edinson Cavani on target, but their win was overshadowed by the early loss of Zlatan Ibrahimovic due to a side strain and an after-match incident in the tunnel which saw Bastia's Brazilian striker Brandao headbutt Thiago Motta, leaving the PSG player with a fractured nose."
340,11/08/2014,00:03,Lorient shock Monaco in opening Ligue 1 upset,Twenty-year-old Valentin Lavigne scored with three minutes left to hand unfancied Lorient a shock 2-1 victory over Monaco in the final match of the opening weekend in Ligue 1 action on Sunday.,"Colombian striker Radamel Falcao had appeared to salvage a point for new coach Leonardo Jardim with a controversial penalty on 78 minutes, following Ricardo Carvalho's sending-off. But Lavigne broke clear of the defence to slot the ball past Croatian 'keeper Danijel Subasic. ""I understand that the fans are worried,"" admitted Jardim. ""We want to win and give them football of quality. ""I would have preferred to lose in the pre-season than on the opening day of the league. But I can promise the fans that we are going to work hard to continue to move forward."" The visitors stunned the Louis II faithful, including Prince Albert, as they forced a penalty after just ten minutes when Aymen Abdennour committed a foul inside the area. Cameroon international Vincent Aboubakar made no mistake from the spot as he planted a low shot past Subasic to put Lorient 1-0 in front. Lorient goalkeeper Benjamin Lacomte, who spent last season on loan at second division Dijon, dealt with everything that came his way before the referee awarded Monaco a penalty with 12 minutes left. But despite Falcao's strike, it wasn't enough. Earlier, seven-time French champions Lyon began their campaign in fine style as they defeated Brittany club Rennes 2-0 at the Stade Gerland. Caen are the early frontrunners on goal difference after their 3-0 win at Evian on Saturday. Lyon, who won their titles consecutively from 2002 and 2008, opened the scoring in their first league match under new coach Hubert Fournier with a strike from 34-year-old midfielder Steed Malbranque after 64 minutes. French international Alexandre Lacazette, who scored 23 goals last season, made the points safe from the penalty spot with 16 minutes left. Champions Paris Saint-Germain were held to a 2-2 draw at Reims in the Ligue 1 curtain raiser on Friday while Marseille were pegged back in a 3-3 draw at Bastia 24 hours later in a match marred by crowd trouble. There were also opening day wins for Saint-Etienne, Bordeaux, Nice and Nantes while Champions League hopefuls Lille, who drew Porto in the final qualifiying round, were held to a 0-0 stalemate at home by Metz."
341,09/08/2014,20:47,Fulham loan Stekelenburg to Monaco,"Monaco have signed Dutch international goalkeeper Maarten Stekelenburg from Fulham on a season-long loan, the Principality club said on their website Saturday.","The 31-year-old, who was first choice for the Netherlands at the 2010 World Cup, will provide competition for Croatia's Danijel Subasic. The former Ajax and Roma shot-stopper, who has 54 international caps, will wear the number 16 shirt. He played just 11 league games for Fulham last season as they were relegated from the Premier League to the Championship. Monaco had been expected to sign former Barcelona goalkeeper Victor Valdes after the Spaniard became a free agent at the end of last season, but they pulled out of the deal after he tore his cruciate knee ligament in March."
342,03/08/2014,19:20,Falcao scores comeback goal to sink Arsenal,Radamel Falcao scored his first goal since a six-month injury lay-off to earn Monaco a 1-0 win over Arsenal in the Emirates Cup friendly tournament in London on Sunday.,"The Colombia striker netted with a powerful first-half header to give Monaco victory in their final pre-season friendly before they open their Ligue 1 campaign at home to Lorient next Sunday. Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger handed a full debut to £30 million ($50.4 million, 37.6 million euros) new signing Alexis Sanchez, but the Chilean was eclipsed by Falcao, who missed the World Cup after damaging knee ligaments in January. Monaco's win handed victory in the four-team tournament to Valencia, who beat Benfica 3-1 earlier in the day at Arsenal's Emirates Stadium. Arsenal tackle Manchester City in the Community Shield at Wembley next weekend, before kicking off the Premier League season at home to Crystal Palace on August 16. Sanchez lined up in front of debutant Mathieu Debuchy on Arsenal's right flank, with fellow new signing Calum Chambers again deployed at centre-back, while Falcao made his first start since his injury. Buzzing around in bright orange boots, Sanchez almost freed Olivier Giroud with a sweeping pass from wide on the right, but while Arsenal looked bright and eager in possession, Monaco carried the greater threat. Right-back Nabil Dirar almost embarrassed Arsenal goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny with a mishit right-wing cross and then teed up Falcao to head wide. Yannick Ferreira-Carrasco twice threatened from range, drilling narrowly over from 25 yards with his right foot and then working Szczesny with his left, while Joao Moutinho also shot wide. All that Arsenal could offer by way of reply was a Chambers effort from a Santi Cazorla corner that sailed well clear of the crossbar. Monaco made the breakthrough in the 37th minute when Falcao stole in unmarked to meet a free-kick from Moutinho with an emphatic close-range header. It was the former Atletico Madrid striker's first goal since the day he ruptured the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee in a French Cup tie against amateur side Chasselay on January 22. A half-time reshuffle saw Sanchez move up front for the second half and he played a role in a move that culminated in Monaco goalkeeper Danijel Subasic swatting away a thumping shot from Jack Wilshere. Falcao made way for Anthony Martial with around half an hour to play, while Sanchez was also withdrawn before the end. Teenage striker Chuba Akpom took Sanchez's place and he should have been awarded a penalty after being tripped by Subasic, but referee Martin Atkinson instead gave a free-kick on the edge of the box that Arsenal could not exploit. In the penultimate game of the tournament earlier on Sunday, Valencia came from behind to beat Portuguese champions Benfica 3-1. New signing Derley gave Benfica an early lead, but Jose Luis Gaya equalised just before half-time and Valencia completed their comeback with goals from Pablo Piatti and Andres Guardado in the second half."
343,02/08/2014,14:25,Falcao named on bench for Monaco,Monaco striker Radamel Falcao was poised to make his first appearance for six months after being named on the bench for his side's friendly against Valencia in London on Saturday.,"The 28-year-old Colombia international has not played since rupturing the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee during a French Cup game against amateur side Chasselay on January 22. The injury cut short his debut season at the big-spending Ligue 1 club and prevented him from appearing at the World Cup, where Colombia reached the quarter-finals. Monaco coach Leonardo Jardim has suggested that Falcao will make only a brief cameo appearance against Valencia, which is the first game of the Emirates Cup pre-season tournament, including hosts Arsenal and Benfica. ""Falcao will play this weekend. Not the whole match, but 15 to 20 minutes, and perhaps more on Sunday (against Arsenal),"" Jardim told a press conference on Friday. ""He can't wait to play again. He's close to being at 100 percent physically. It will be a great test for him ahead the opening of the Ligue 1 season (at home to Lorient on August 10)."""

346,17/07/2014,00:23,Newcastle sign Riviere from Monaco,Newcastle boosted their threadbare striking options on Wednesday by signing Emmanuel Riviere from French side Monaco on a long-term deal for an undisclosed fee.,"Riviere, 24, made 30 appearances for Monaco last season and scored 10 goals. His arrival at St James' Park comes after the club saw loan signings Loic Remy and Luuk de Jong as well as out-of-contract Shola Ameobi leave the club. Papiss Cisse, meanwhile, is recovering from a knee injury. ""This is an important signing because we know that in the striking department, with Papiss injured, we need to improve that area,"" said Newcastle manager Alan Pardew. ""We have looked at Emmanuel for a while and we know he will score goals for us. He is quick, hungry for success and will love having 50,000 Geordies cheering him on."""
347,14/07/2014,03:45,World Cup hotshot Rodriguez pushes for Real move,James Rodriguez on Sunday sealed his place as the revelation of the World Cup amid mounting reports of Real Madrid moving to sign the Colombian striker.,"""I'd jump at the chance of going to Real Madrid,"" Rodriguez told Spanish sports daily Marca on the day that his six goals made him the World Cup's Golden Boot winner. ""It is is the dream of my life and if it happens I want to enjoy it,"" added Rodriguez, who turned 23 on Saturday. Colombia went out of the World Cup in the quarter finals against Brazil. But no other candidate -- Germany's Thomas Mueller or Argentina's Lionel Messi -- managed to overtake him with their extra games. Germany's world champion Mueller ended up in second place with five goals. Messi, injured Brazil star Neymar and Dutch striker Robin van Persie, shared third spot on four. ""Thanks to all of you for your support and to my teammates who made it possible,"" said Rodriguez on his Twitter account. Colombia's President Juan Manuel Santos and his teammates also showered the young star with congratulations. Among Rodriguez's half dozen goals was the magical chest and volley against Uruguay that was among the strikes of the tournament. The Monaco forward, who stepped in to fill the void left by Colombia's injured Radamel Falcao, also scored in the 2-1 quarter-final loss to Brazil. He got a second against Uruguay in the last 16 game, and one in each of Colombia's first round matches against Ivory Coast, Greece and Japan. Rodriguez left the pitch in tears after the defeat by Brazil. But he has become the hottest property in football. Monaco paid Portugal's Porto 45 million euros (60 million dollars) one year ago. Media reports say they have sought at least twice that amount from potential buyers. Real Madrid president Florentino Perez is already negotiating with Monaco counterpart Dimitry Rybolovlev, according to Marca. The Spanish paper said Real had brought the potential price down to 85 million euros. Rodriguez has sprung into the spotlight left by his Monaco and Colombia teammate Falcao who injured cruciate ligaments in January that ruled him out of the World Cup. Colombia boss Jose Pekerman hailed Rodriguez's contribution in taking the country to the World Cup quarter finals for the first time. ""The work of James in the World Cup has been excellent,"" said Pekerman. ""He is an exceptional player that has huge talent and ambition."" Uruguay coach Oscar Tabarez likened Rodriguez to Diego Maradona and Lionel Messi. ""I told him he has many great World Cups in front of him,"" said Brazil right-back Dani Alves."
348,10/07/2014,01:43,Five facts on Argentina hero Sergio Romero,"Five facts about Sergio Romero, Argentina's goalkeeper who saved two spot-kicks in the World Cup semi-final penalty shoot-out against the Netherlands on Wednesday to put the South Americans into Sunday's final:","-- Sidelined in Monaco Romero arrived in Brazil with precious little playing time under his belt at French Ligue 1 side Monaco, keeping the bench warm for much of the season with a mere nine appearances. The 27-year-old, who arrived in the principality on loan in 2013 from Sampdoria, was deployed mostly in unglamarous cup assignments. -- Van Gaal taught Romero to stop spot-kicks In a twist of fate Romero was taught to stop penalties by Dutch coach Louis van Gaal, from the pair's time as coach and player at Dutch side AZ Alkmaar. ""I taught Romero to stop penalties, so that hurts,"" van Gaal joked after Wednesday's semi-final when Romero saved efforts from Ron Vlaar and Wesley Sneijder. -- Shines for his country Compared to his frustrating club situation 'Chiquito', as he is known, has shone for Argentina. He has been first choice since 2009. He helped lift Argetina's Under 20 side to win the world title in 2007, and claimed Olympic gold in Beijing in 2008 with four-time world footballer of the year Lionel Messi, now a close friend. -- Sabella sticks by his man Romero survived the avalanche of goals at the 2010 World Cup when Germany brushed the South Americans aside 4-0. Coach Alejandro Sabella's decision to stick by him has proved wise, with Romero's reliability between the posts saving Argentina's skin on more than one occasion en route to Sunday's climax where he was named man of the match. He is only the second Argentine goalkeeper to earn 50 caps. -- Shy off the pitch Romero has described himself as 'shy and reserved' and while the 2014 World Cup has set new records for traffic on twitter he refuses to use the soclal media site or Facebook."
349,05/07/2014,20:26,French defender Abidal joins Olympiakos,Greek champions Olympiakos confirmed Saturday they have signed veteran French defender Eric Abidal on a two-year contract for an undisclosed fee.,"Just last week Monaco had announced that their 34-year-old captain, who underwent a liver transplant in 2012 while playing for Barcelona, would extend his contract with the French Ligue 1 runners-up for another season. But instead he will join up with the Olympiakos squad on Monday for pre-season training in Austria. Abidal made 26 appearances in Ligue 1 last season but lost his place to Aymen Abdennour in the second half of the championship and was not called up by France coach Didier Deschamps for the World Cup. Abidal, who played for Barcelona for six years from 2007, was first diagnosed with a liver tumour in March 2011 and a year later underwent a transplant. The former Lille and Lyon player says he has fully recovered and he successfully completed medical checks with Olympiakos on Saturday. He joined Monaco in July last year after Barcelona opted not to renew his contract and won the last of his 67 caps for Les Bleus in February 2012 before undergoing the liver transplant that sidelined him for just under 12 months."
350,03/07/2014,17:19,Valdes move to Monaco off - club,"Former Barcelona goalkeeper Victor Valdes will not be joining Monaco this summer as he continues to work his way back from a serious knee injury, the Ligue 1 club announced Thursday.","Valdes, 32, left Barcelona at the end of last season, having spent his whole career at the Catalan club, and had been in discussions over a move to the Ligue 1 side, who are hoping to challenge Paris Saint-Germain for the title this term. ""I confirm that we've been in contact and had negotiations with him and his entourage...but he is injured and won't sign for Monaco,"" said Monaco vice-president, Vadim Vasilyev. Valdes, who has been capped 20 times by Spain, tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee in March and underwent surgery which ruled him out of the rest of the season as well as the World Cup. ""Today, we are counting on (first-choice goalkeeper) Danijel Subasic who had a very good first season,"" added Vasilyev, who also said the club would wait until the end of the World Cup before making a decision over the future of Argentine international Sergio Romero. Romero, who played second fiddle to Subasic but is his country's first-choice keeper at the finals in Brazil, spent last season at Monaco on loan from Italian side Sampdoria and has said he would like to extend his stay at the Stade Louis II."

Rothen, a former Paris Saint Germain, Monaco and Bastia player, is among a group of 14 players now accused of betting more than 500 euros on games between July 2013 and January 2014. Eighty-seven professional footballers have broken rules banning them from betting on top French leagues, with 23 under particular scrutiny from the LFP for having placed online bets against their own teams. Ligue 1 players -- Nantes' Johan Audel and Valenciennes' Anthony Le Tallec -- are among the group accused of betting on their own teams and have also been summonsed to appear before the LFP.

352,10/06/2014,03:15,Football: Five players to watch in World Cup Group C,Five key players to watch in World Cup Group C:,"Keisuke Honda - Japan Born: 13/6/1986, Caps 56 Keisuke Honda was one of Japan's leading lights in South Africa four years ago -- his two goals helped Japan reach the last 16 -- and will again be central to his nation's hopes in Brazil. Honda, 27, endured a disappointing campaign with AC Milan having joined the Italian giants from CSKA Moscow in January but is aiming to put those struggles behind him on the grand stage. Deployed primarily out on the right at club level, Honda is the hub of the national side and is hoping a return to a more central role will allow him to flourish under coach Alberto Zaccheroni's more attack-minded approach. Yaya Toure - Ivory Coast Born: 13/5/1983, Caps 94 Yaya Toure, the reigning three-time African Footballer of the Year will be crucial to Ivorian hopes in Brazil. Toure, 31, was the Elephants' second-leading scorer behind Salomon Kalou in qualifying for the finals and terrorised Premier League defences this past season to the tune of 20 goals to help Manchester City regain the English title. A colossus in the middle of the park, Toure's marauding runs from deep and blistering strike, not to mention his imposing physique, will present quite a headache for opposing sides seeking to shackle the driving force of the Ivorian team. With Ivory Coast's golden generation turning decidely grey Brazil seemingly represents one final chance for the midfielder to leave his mark on the world stage. James Rodriguez - Colombia Born: 12/7/1991, Caps 22 In the absence of Radamel Falcao, the spotlight turns to midfield maestro James Rodriguez to lead the Colombian challenge in Brazil. After a slow start to life at Monaco, Rodriguez shone in his first season in France, where he was named to the Ligue 1 team of the season following his tally of nine goals and 12 assists that helped the principality club to a second-place finish. Nicknamed 'El Nuevo Pibe' (the new kid), a nod to the original 'El Pibe' Carlos Valderrama, there are in truth few similarities between the two, neither in playing style nor appearance, but the more direct and forward-thinking Rodriguez will be Colombia's creator-in-chief this summer. Kostas Mitroglou - Greece Born: 12/3/1988, Caps 32 The firepower of Kostas Mitroglou propelled Greece into a second straight finals appearance but since netting three times over the two-legged play-off with Romania the striker's fallen on hard times. A move from Olympiacos, where he had set the Greek league alight, to Premier League side Fulham resulted in relegation as he failed to find the net after making just one start following persistent knee troubles. The most expensive Greek player in history at reportedly £12.5m ($20.6 million, 15.3 million euros), 'Mitrogoal' poses a threat with both feet and is strong aerially, which are crucial strengths in a goal-shy Greek attack. Eiji Kawashima - Japan Born: 20/03/1983, Caps - 56 It's not often a goalkeeper is singled out as a key player but Japan's Eiji Kawashima has the ability to be a star at the World Cup. Kawashima is one of only two Japanese goalkeepers ever to ply their trade in Europe and although he may be earning his keep in the relatively modest surrounds of the Belgian League, he has been mighty impressive there. The 31-year-old headed to Belgian after an impressive last World Cup, where he conceded only two goals in four matches. Twice named Most Valuable Player at Lierse, Kawashima's goalkeeping could be the difference between progression and an early exit in a group that is widely expected to be tight."
353,04/06/2014,01:03,"Brazil look World Cup-ready on pitch -- off it, not so much","Brazil thrashed Panama in a friendly Tuesday, looking very much ready for the World Cup, although off the pitch, the hosts were still rushing to finish their stadiums nine days from kick-off.","Star striker Neymar opened the scoring as Brazil routed their visitors 4-0 in the central city of Goiania, with Daniel Alves, Hulk and Willian all adding goals. But off-pitch problems continued to distract from the football, with workers scrambling to finish five of the 12 host stadiums. The original deadline was December 31, but preparations have been plagued by chronic delays, cost-overruns and construction accidents that killed eight workers. At Corinthians Arena in Sao Paulo, which will host the opening ceremony and kick-off match between Brazil and Croatia, workers are still finishing temporary stands for 20,000 fans and VIP seats intended for heads of state. The stadiums in Curitiba, Cuiaba, Natal and Porto Alegre are also unfinished to varying degrees. Meanwhile, protests that have shaken Brazil before the World Cup continued in Goiania, where about 100 demonstrators gathered outside the hotel where the Brazilian team were staying ahead of their match. ""Wake up Neymar, for the people's struggle!"" chanted demonstrators, carrying signs with slogans such as ""FIFA go home!"" Protesters from a wide range of political parties and activist groups have attacked the government for spending more than $11 billion on the tournament, calling for it to place more priority on education, health and transport. But like other recent rallies, Tuesday's was far smaller than the mass protests that marred the Confederations Cup, a World Cup dress rehearsal held one year ago, when a million people flooded the streets, some clashing with police. As the clock ticks down to the World Cup and a presidential election in October, Brazil has also been hit by a wave of strikes. Recent police strikes -- and the threat of more during the World Cup -- have been among the government's biggest headaches. But federal police announced they had reached a deal for a 15.8 percent raise in exchange for a promise not to strike in the coming months. Police in the capital Brasilia have accepted the offer, which will be put to a vote in each of Brazil's 26 states in the coming days, the federal police union said. Brazil says it will have 157,000 police and soldiers providing security during the World Cup. The military will deploy 57,000 troops, including 21,000 on alert for emergency operations. The government also downplayed problems with the country's aging airports, many of which are still undergoing renovations originally due to be finished for the World Cup. ""I can assure you we are prepared,"" said Aviation Minister Wellington Moreira Franco, while admitting: ""It is clear we have problems."" But he said the transport overhaul was being done with an eye to the future. ""The new objective is to have new airports for the country,"" he said. An estimated 600,000 foreign fans and 3.1 million Brazilians are expected to criss-cross the massive South American country during the tournament, and there are fears of transport chaos. Organizers have shelved much of the infrastructure they had originally promised, from roadworks to a high-speed train to subway and monorail lines. Teams meanwhile continued to trickle in to Brazil, having cut their rosters to the 23-player limit for a Monday deadline. The Croatian and Iranian squads arrived Tuesday, joining Australia, who arrived on May 28. But fitness concerns dogged several stars, including France's Franck Ribery, Uruguay's Luis Suarez and Spain's Brazilian-born marksman Diego Costa. Colombia for their part had to leave out talismanic striker Radamel Falcao, who was unable to recover in time from a crushing knee injury sustained in January playing for Ligue 1 club Monaco. The 32 teams are allowed to substitute injured players up to 24 hours before their opening matches."
354,02/06/2014,03:03,Football: Stars hope to avoid Montolivo World Cup woe,Italy midfielder Riccardo Montolivo saw his dreams of World Cup glory ended cruelly in a nondescript friendly against Ireland and he may not be the last big star to suffer a similar fate.,"Colombia are praying that their talismanic striker Radamel Falcao will win his battle to be fit, Spain have concerns over their Brazil-born marksman Diego Costa, Uruguay too are waiting on last season's leading scorer in the English Premier League Luis Suarez and France on winger Franck Ribery. Montolivo was joined on the sidelines of football's global showpiece by two other players as Mexico midfielder Luis Montes went from the joy of scoring in the friendly against Ecuador to the despair minutes later of suffering a serious leg fracture. Ghanaian central defender Jerry Asaminko will also have to sit at home and watch his compatriots perform after the term 'play to the final whistle' came agonisingly true as he broke an ankle in the third minute of time added on of their 1-0 defeat by Holland. However, while the respective injuries are devastating for the players, who may never again get another chance to play in the finals, it can equally be so for their team-mates and their morale. Montolivo's was a case in point as Italy coach Cesare Prandelli -- who also has doubts over Montolivo's replacement Alberto Aquilani who went off injured in the first-half -- highlighted after the 0-0 draw with the Irish. ""We saw the players inside. Everyone is broken and really sad about what happened. ""Montolivo is a key player for this squad. He is a point of reference not only on the pitch but off it for his behaviour. ""He has such a good attitude. I think all the lads were really shocked by what happened."" The same could be said for the morale of the other injury doubts. While Falcao has been a major doubt since January his absence would be a major blow also to morale for his team-mates. The 28-year-old is so pivotal to Colombia's hopes -- though they have a relatively weak group with goalshy Greece, Japan and the ageing but talented Ivory Coast -- that coach Jose Pekerman has said they will wait till the last minute to see if he makes it. Frustrating for both country and player is that Falcao, who has scored 20 goals in 51 international appearances, tore his cruciate ligaments in a game he could easily have been allowed to miss by Ligue 1 side Monaco, a French Cup game against an amateur side. ""We will wait until the last minute of the last day,"" said Pekerman earlier this week. It has also been the attitude adopted by Uruguay coach Oscar Tabarez with regard to Suarez, who injured his knee in training and underwent an operation. ""Things with Luis will depend on how things go with his knee. Our main concern is the player's health,"" Tabarez said this week, adding that he hoped the forward's ""fitness will permit him to participate."" Ribery is crucial to France's hopes of erasing the nightmares of 2010 where the squad -- including the Bayern Munich star -- returned home in disgrace after going on strike and then going out in the first round. However, the 31-year-old, who made a better impression in the 2006 edition when they reached the final, has not trained with the French squad since joining up with them and coach Didier Deschamps has not been able to ease doubts about his key player. ""He grits his teeth, he puts up with the pain. He could do team training and even play. But if it is to play and not be free enough, that is not going to resolve the problem,"" said Deschamps. ""Antoine (Griezemann and the most likely player to start if Ribery is unfit) has qualities, but Franck Ribery is Franck Ribery. It is as though (Cristiano) Ronaldo was not available for Portugal and the journalists asked his replacement to be a Ronaldo,"" he added. So much time and energy was put into ensuring Costa would be eligible to play for Spain that to lose the 25-year-old Atletico Madrid star -- the third highest goal scorer in La Liga last season with 27 goals -- to injury would be the bitterest pill to swallow. Spain coach Vicente del Bosque has cover in veterans Fernando Torres and David Villa. However, with Torres coming off another disappointing season in England and Villa having played second fiddle to Costa at Atletico del Bosque will be desperate for him to recover from his hamstring injury. ""We're in the hands of the medical staff,"" said del Bosque in his typically unflamboyant manner."
355,26/05/2014,02:05,Football: Atletico domestic success breaks continental mould,Atletico Madrid fans could be forgiven for feeling that there was a crushing sense of inevitability about their defeat to rivals Real in the final of the Champions League on Saturday.,"For all that Diego Simeone's side went into European football's showpiece game in Lisbon as Spanish champions, having finished three points clear of both Barcelona and Real, they remain the David against their city neighbours' Goliath and they could only continue to upset the odds for so long. At the start of the season, the bookmakers' odds on Atletico winning the Spanish title were much the same as those on Aberdeen or Motherwell pipping Celtic to the Scottish championship. Nobody could have foreseen Atletico winning the double of domestic league and Champions League. In the end, it took a 93rd-minute Sergio Ramos equaliser to save Real, who won 4-1 after extra time to lift the European Cup for the 10th time. ""This will make us better,"" vowed Atletico coach Simeone after Saturday's defeat. ""Now the rest of the world knows that Atletico can compete."" A week earlier, after winning La Liga, the Argentine had declared that ""there is no replacement for hard work"", but with a budget that is only around a quarter of that of Real and Barca, their domestic dominance may not last too long. Indeed, while they succeded in Spain, Europe's other leading leagues turned out to be more predictable than ever before. In Germany, Bayern Munich were champions in record quick time, clinching the Bundesliga title with seven games to spare and ending 19 points clear of Borussia Dortmund despite taking their foot off the accelerator in the closing weeks. They didn't lose a single match until after securing the title and went on to add the German Cup for good measure. In France, mega-rich Paris Saint-Germain confirmed their dominance as they retained the Ligue 1 title with a record 89 points, nine points more than runners-up Monaco, whose own tally was a new club record. And in Italy, the country's richest and most decorated club Juventus won a third straight title with a record tally of 102 points, finishing 17 points clear of runners-up Roma. Money is almost everything in football today. In England, Liverpool briefly appeared poised to win a first title since 1990 before Manchester City, fuelled by huge injections of cash from their Abu Dhabi-based owners, emerged to be crowned Premier League champions for the second time in three seasons. They did so by scoring 102 goals, one short of the Premier League record set by Chelsea in 2010. Liverpool were the season's hard-luck story, as they came so close to ending a 24-year wait to win a 19th English top-flight title, but having climbed from seventh to second in the space of a year their manager Brendan Rodgers was happy to label the season ""a wonderful adventure."" The likes of Laurent Blanc at PSG and Pep Guardiola at Bayern could not get away with saying that if they went one season without winning silverware. ""I get the impression that our season is only measured on what we have done in Europe. It is a bit simplistic,"" bemoaned Blanc after leading the French capital club to a domestic double, as well as a quarter-final exit from the Champions League. ""You have to win everything here, but even when you do, it's still not enough,"" admitted Guardiola, whose season featured four trophies altogether but will probably be best remembered for a Champions League semi-final hammering by Real Madrid. Madrid president Florentino Perez's exuberant celebrations in Lisbon were understandable given the spending he has sanctioned on his club's quest to win that 10th European Cup, or 'La Decima'. But with the world's two most expensive players at his disposal in Cristiano Ronaldo and Gareth Bale, it was only a matter of time before they got there. Meanwhile, having broken the mould at home, and on their run in Europe, Atletico will struggle to fend off approaches from elsewhere for their best players over the summer. Their ability to do that will determine to what extent they really can compete again next season."
356,23/05/2014,15:54,Football: Sagnol appointed Bordeaux coach,"Former France international footballer Willy Sagnol has been appointed coach of Bordeaux, the Ligue 1 club confirmed on Friday.","The arrival of the 37-year-old Sagnol on a three-year deal until June 2017 ends speculation linking former France international star Zinédine Zidane with the job. Sagnol, who played alongside Zidane when France lost the 2006 World Cup final to Italy on penalties, has spent the past two and a half years in charge of the France Under-21 team, leading them to six wins and two draws. Capped 58 times, the former St Etienne, Monaco and Bayern Munich defender will take charge of Bordeaux on June 4 with training for next season starting on June 26. Bordeaux won the last of their six Ligue 1 titles in 2009, with the 1995 UEFA Cup runners-up and 2010 Champions League quarter-finalists missing out on Europe for the first time in three years after finishing seventh this season. Bordeaux president Jean-Louis Triaud had said club bosses wanted to bring ""freshness, youth, punch"" to the western outfit as they prepare to move into a new 42,000-seater stadium next year. ""If we have a coach with an eye on youth and the desire to cultivate our emerging shoots, he'll get the backing of management,"" Triaud said earlier this week. It will be Sagnol's first time coaching a team, and he will be hoping to follow in the footsteps of another former France international, Laurent Blanc, who also started out in Bordeaux in 2007, winning the Ligue 1 and League Cup titles two years later, and reaching the Champions League quarter-finals in 2010. Sagnol started his playing career in his native St Etienne in 1996, before heading for Monaco where he won the Ligue 1 title in 2000. He made his name however during his eight-year spell with Bayern Munich, where he won every title possible -- five Bundesliga, four German Cup, Champions League and Intercontinental Cup. Sagnol wore the captain's armband before an Achilles tendon injury forced him to retire in 2009, going on to work as a recruiter for the Bavarian side until late 2011."

Principality side Monaco finished runners-up to Paris Saint-Germain in Ligue 1 this season, qualifying them for the Champions League. ""I can confirm the departure of Claudio Ranieri. We have taken the decision to part ways,"" Vasilyev told a press conference. ""I would like to acknowledge the very good job that Ranieri has done."" Ranieri also previously coached Serie A clubs Inter Milan, Napoli, Fiorentina, Juventus, Roma and Parma as well as Spanish outfits Atletico Madrid and Valencia. The Italian was recruited in May 2012 after the club was rescued from the point of bankruptcy by Russian billionaire Dmitry Rybolovlev. He returned the club to Ligue 1 and a spending spree in the past 12 months saw the arrival of Radamel Falcao, James Rodriguez, Eric Abidal and Joao Moutinho. Despite guiding Monaco to second place, nine points behind PSG, Ranieri's future had been the subject of growing speculation. ""It was a difficult decision,"" Vasilyev added. ""It's never easy when the results are good. But we believe that at this stage of the project we need to find a new dynamic. ""We didn't share the same vision of the club's development. We need new ideas to build and develop our club. We're in for the long haul, there's a vision for development."" According to media reports, Monaco are in talks with Portuguese coach Leonardo Jardim, 39, who on Tuesday parted company with Sporting Lisbon after just one season in charge. However Vasilyev would not confirm the name of the new coach until certain details had been ironed out. Vasilyev added: ""I cannot confirm the name of the new coach while the details are still being sorted. ""We are looking for a modern coach who can bring new methods, who has a vision, has an attacking philosophy and who can create a good show for our supporters."" ""It's secondary for us if the coach is well-known or not."" Ranieri had one year to run on his contract, but Saturday's 1-1 draw against Bordeaux on the final day of the season proved to be his last game in charge."

""It's certain that the significance of this match played a role in the fact it will be my last in Ligue 1,"" said Landreau, 35, who won the French title with Nantes in 2001. ""I imagined it as soon as I saw the fixture list but it was a drawn-out thought process that led to me taking this decision in order to make sure it was a final choice. It's fantastic and incredible to be able to finish my career in this manner,"" he added. Landreau, who also had spells at Paris Saint-Germain and Lille, passed former Monaco and France goalkeeper Jean-Luc Ettori's record of 602 appearances in France's top flight last December and Saturday's match will be his 618th league outing.

Rene Girard's side need a victory at Lorient to assure themselves of a place in next season's third qualifying round, but anything less would open the door for Saint-Etienne, who host rock-bottom Ajaccio, to pip them at the post. ""We know what we have to do Saturday to finish in third, a position we've occupied for a large part of the season,"" said Girard. ""In the event that we miss out on third, we could talk about disappointment, but not failure, because don't forget that at the start of the season we weren't forecasted to finish this high."" Saint-Etienne must beat Ajaccio and hope Lille slip up if they're to clinch their highest finish since ending the 1981/92 season as runners-up. ""The prospect of finishing in third place is a source of extra motivation. The stadium will be full, and the crowd will be our 12th man. We want to make sure we win so that there can be no regrets when we find out how Lille do away to Lorient,"" said striker Mevlut Erding, who leads Les Verts with 11 goals this campaign. Meanwhile, successive defeats for Lyon has paved the way for Marseille to potentially snatch fifth place and a berth in the Europa League qualifying rounds. Remi Garde will take charge of Lyon for the final time in Nice having opted not to renew his expiring contract due to ""family and personal reasons"", while Marseille host Guingamp needing to better Lyon's result to leapfrog OL. Jose Anigo is also on his way out at the Stade Velodrome with Marcelo Bielsa to take over at Marseille next season, and the outgoing OM boss wants to bow out on a high note. ""We don't have our destiny in our hands but hopefully our friends at Nice will get a result against Lyon,"" said Anigo. ""We're at home and we'll try to finish with a flourish. If we can do that it'll be very nice for everyone."" Sochaux and Evian meet at the Stade Bonal in a straight shootout to avoid relegation. 17th-placed Evian are one point above their rivals but Sochaux are unbeaten in seven matches and have turned their home ground into a fortress of late, taking 20 points from a possible 24. ""We have no choice but to win,"" said Sochaux coach Herve Renard. ""If we keep playing like we have in the last few games, we can make it. ""If we are not able to do it here, then it will mean that we don't deserve to stay in the top division,"" added the former Zambia manager.

I know what we're made of. I know we'll do it,"" said Dupraz. Elsewhere, champions Paris Saint-Germain can establish a new record for most wins in a season should they beat Montpellier.

363,15/05/2014,03:04,Football: France guided by 'lucky star' Deschamps,"Didier Deschamps has had luck on his side throughout his career, and the France boss will be hoping that a kind World Cup draw can set Les Bleus up for a successful campaign in Brazil.","When the draw for the finals was made back in December, French media rejoiced after seeing their team thrown in with Honduras, Switzerland and Ecuador in Group E, quite an escape given that Les Bleus were not among the top seeds. ""The day that luck was handed out, Didier Deschamps was there in the front row"", remarked sports daily L'Equipe, adding that the 45-year-old Basque-born coach was accompanied by a ""lucky star which watches over him"". France great Michel Platini, these days the president of UEFA, once said that Deschamps ""must have been blessed with holy water when he was born"", although he has a lot more going for him than just that. Schooled at Nantes under the legendary coach Jean-Claude Suaudeau, 'DD' was part of the France side that famously suffered a gut-wrenching last-gasp loss to Bulgaria to miss out on qualifying for the 1994 World Cup in the United States. That defeat marked a generation, with the exception of Deschamps, who recovered from the heartache to lift the World Cup at the Stade de France in 1998 and also captained the side that won the European Championship two years later. Seventeen years on from that he coached Marseille to the Ligue 1 title, while his coaching CV also includes a Champions League final appearance with Monaco in 2004. Deschamps clearly knows what he is doing, but his time in charge of Les Bleus has been a trying one, with just nine wins to his name in 19 games in charge. After being appointed as successor to former international team-mate Laurent Blanc in 2012, Deschamps said that ""it would make no sense to carry on"" as coach if France failed to qualify for the World Cup in Brazil. They made it, if only just, finishing second in their qualifying group behind reigning world and European champions Spain and then beating Ukraine in a play-off, overcoming a 2-0 first-leg defeat in Kiev by producing a stirring display to win 3-0 in the return at the Stade de France. ""I have lived through some great moments in my long career,"" said the 45-year-old after that victory. ""To take France to a World Cup is fabulous, especially after the first leg, where the result was not favourable."" Deschamps was thrown into the air by his players in the centre-circle of the Stade de France at the end of that game, just as he was at the end of the 1998 World Cup final win against Brazil. Nobody is even contemplating a repeat of that triumph this time around, but a run to the quarter-finals would be considered a success as the coach looks to build a team capable of winning Euro 2016 on home soil."

Bastia's 34-year-old goalkeeper Mickael Landreau, who will retire from football after the finals, is the senior figure in the squad, while Paris Saint-Germain left-back Lucas Digne, 20, was preferred to Gael Clichy of Manchester City. Newcastle United's Loic Remy, who played under Deschamps at Marseille, was selected among the forwards rather than Alexandre Lacazette, scorer of 15 goals in Ligue 1 this season with Lyon. Laczette was named on a seven-man standby list that also includes Southampton midfielder Morgan Schneiderlin, who is uncapped but has enjoyed a fine season in the Premier League. The seven players on standby will team up with the full squad at France's training base at Clairefontaine, near Paris, next Monday, May 19 and will stay with the squad until May 28, the day after the friendly against Norway at the Stade de France. Changes can be made to the 23-man squad up to the deadline set by FIFA of June 2 before heading to the finals, where Deschamps hopes to make an impact while also preparing a side capable of winning Euro 2016, which France will host. ""I am not going to waste a World Cup but we will begin our Euro 2016 preparations as of now,"" he said. ""I don't dream. I'm a realist, but that doesn't prevent me from having ambition."" France have been drawn in Group E with Switzerland, Ecuador and Honduras. As well as playing Norway, they will play friendlies against Paraguay in Nice on June 1 and against Jamaica at Lille's Stade Pierre-Mauroy on June 8 before flying to Brazil.

""He is a player of great quality, but Samir's performances for France have not been of the standard of those with his club Manchester City,"" Deschamps said after revealing his squad live on French television channel TF1's evening news programme. ""He is an important player and a first-pick for Manchester City and that is not the case for France. ""And when he is a substitute he is not happy, and that is felt by the squad as a whole. That is why he is not on the list."" Nasri, who was also left out of Raymond Domenech's squad for the 2010 World Cup, last played for France in the 2-0 defeat to Ukraine in the first leg of last November's World Cup qualifying play-off.

368,08/05/2014,15:35,Football: Blanc extends PSG contract until 2016,"Laurent Blanc has extended his contract as coach of Paris Saint-Germain by one year until June 2016, the newly-crowned French champions announced on Thursday.","In his first season with PSG, Blanc not only guided the capital club to Ligue 1 success, but also victory in the League Cup and the season-opening Champions Trophy. PSG also reached the quarter-finals of the UEFA Champions League for the second year in succession. With 25 victories in 36 Ligue 1 matches, Blanc enjoys the highest win rate in the history of the club, which has won 39 out of 53 official matches this season. It was also his second Ligue 1 crown as a coach having guided Bordeaux to the 2009 title. ""I am very happy to continue with Paris Saint-Germain,"" said the 49-year-old Blanc, who coached the France national team between 2010-12. ""I want to be a part of this project over the long term, the most ambitious project in European football. Together, we will dream bigger."" PSG president Nasser al-Khelaifi added: ""It is perfectly justified to show our confidence in Laurent Blanc. ""We are very happy with his results this season, as well as the very attractive football the team has played. We are convinced we will win a lot more trophies together."" Blanc, a 1998 World Cup winner capped 97 times by France, replaced Real Madrid-bound Carlo Ancelotti in the Parisians' dugout last summer. PSG are a more fluent, more cohesive side than 12 months ago, and Blanc deserves credit for the job he has done, especially as they were a club in turmoil when he took over following the departure of Ancelotti and the resignation of sporting director Leonardo, combined with the threatening emergence of big-spending Monaco. Blanc could scarcely have been further down the club's list of targets for the job and yet he wasted little time in finding a winning formula, settling on a 4-3-3 formation that brought the best out of the midfield trio of Thiago Motta, Marco Verratti and Blaise Matuidi, even if it partly meant sacrificing record signing Edinson Cavani. The Uruguayan has had to settle for a role out on the flank with Zlatan Ibrahimovic still the undisputed star of the side, but Cavani has still delivered 16 league goals, while also scoring a brace in the 2-1 League Cup final triumph over Lyon."

The result left second-placed Monaco seven points behind PSG with only two matches of the season remaining and means that Claudio Ranieri's side will have to settle for the runners-up spot and automatic Champions League qualification. However, PSG captain Thiago Silva admitted that it was a rather strange way for his team to win the title. ""There is no sadness but it was a difficult match,"" the Brazilian defender told Canal Plus television. ""We did well for 10 months. The last month has not been good but I am very happy today. I hope we can continue like this next season and try to win the Champions League as well,"" he added. Monaco took the lead against Guingamp in the 77th minute courtesy of a strike from the in-form Dimitar Berbatov, his fifth in his last four games. However, Fatih Atik equalised for the Bretons five minutes from the end, and PSG fans cheered as it filtered through to them that Monaco had been pegged back. Guingamp, who won the French Cup by beating Rennes 2-0 in the final at the weekend, hung on for a precious draw in their fight against relegation despite having Moustapha Diallo sent off. PSG appeared buoyant at the start of their match and took the lead inside three minutes when Edinson Cavani found Ezequiel Lavezzi, who drilled home. However, Rennes recovered to equalise midway through the first half, on-loan Marseille winger Foued Kadir firing into the net through a crowd of bodies in the PSG box. Paul-Georges Ntep set up that goal, and four minutes later the France under-21 forward put Rennes in front, his free-kick from wide on the left avoiding everyone in the box as it sailed into the net at the far post. That proved to be the end of the scoring, with the home side unable to conjure an equaliser even after the introduction of Zlatan Ibrahimovic just before the hour mark, the Swede making his first appearance in a month after a thigh injury. Remarkably, it was PSG's first home league defeat in 30 matches since a nine-man Rennes side also won 2-1 at the Parc des Princes in November 2012, and the result leaves Rennes safe from the threat of relegation. ""I expected a reaction after the Cup final, but maybe not as much as a win away to Paris,"" admitted Rennes coach Philippe Montanier, whose side are now six points clear of the drop zone and with a far superior goal difference. ""After the final it was very difficult, but there is a unity amongst the squad and the club as a whole that allowed us to come through it. We needed the points and to secure our survival here is a huge satisfaction."" Paris have toiled in the league ever since being knocked out of the Champions League by Chelsea last month, with this defeat following a loss at Lyon and a 1-1 draw at Sochaux 10 days ago. However, their dominance of Ligue 1 was previously absolute, and they have not been off the top of the table since October. Helped by Ibrahimovic's tally of 25 goals, they have already set a new record for the most goals scored in a Ligue 1 campaign and are on course to break the record for the most points. Despite losing to Rennes, PSG have 83 points with two matches left, one fewer than the all-time best mark, set by Lyon in the 2005-06 season. It is PSG's fourth French title since their foundation in 1970, following previous triumphs in 1986, 1994 and last season, and is added to the League Cup they won last month by beating Lyon 2-1 in the final."

371,07/05/2014,23:07,Football: Five key moments in PSG's run to the title,"After Paris Saint-Germain clinched a second successive Ligue 1 title on Wednesday, AFP Sports traces five key moments that helped the French capital club retain their crown:","- After a sluggish start to the season, PSG's new coach Laurent Blanc quickly ditched the 4-4-2 formation favoured by his predecessor Carlo Ancelotti and switched to a 4-3-3. A 2-0 win at Bordeaux at the start of September was when the new system clicked and was when it became clear that Blanc had found the way to get the best out of his midfield. Thiago Motta controlled the game, Blaise Matuidi scored one goal and Marco Verratti made another. Zlatan Ibrahimovic later raved about the performance, comparing it to that produced in the 1-1 draw away to Barcelona in last season's Champions League quarter-finals. PSG were now properly up and running under Blanc, the former Bordeaux coach. - PSG looked set to suffer their first defeat of the season when they had Thiago Motta sent off and then went 1-0 down in the first half away to bitter rivals Marseille at the start of October. However, the 10 men showed superb character to equalise before the break through Maxwell, and Zlatan Ibrahimovic then scored to seal a 2-1 victory midway through the second period. A week later, they went top of the table for the first time and they were never to relinquish that position. - As impressive as Paris were, they were helped by the lack of a genuine challenger. Following their huge spending spree last summer, Monaco were the best-placed to put up a fight, but a 2-1 home loss to Valenciennes in their last outing before Christmas confirmed that Claudio Ranieri's side were not quite championship-winning material. Had they won, they would have gone into the winter break level on points with PSG. Instead they ended 2013 three points adrift and that gap continued to grow in the second half of the season. - Never was PSG's superiority over the rest of French football more evident than in the 5-0 home win against Nantes in January. That night, Zlatan Ibrahimovic scored twice as Blanc's men destroyed once-proud Nantes, champions eight times themselves. PSG toyed with their opponents, completing a record 863 passes, on their way to equalling their biggest winning margin of the season. - A 3-0 home win against Reims in April secured a club record eighth consecutive Ligue 1 win and left them on the brink of the title. The blow of their Champions League elimination at the hands of Chelsea a few days later slowed their domestic charge, but their relentless run into the spring gave them sufficient margin with which to play."
372,07/05/2014,23:07,Football: Five key players in PSG's title-winning season,Paris Saint-Germain clinched their second consecutive Ligue 1 title on Wednesday after closest challengers Monaco could only draw with Guingamp.,"Here, AFP Sports selects five players who played central roles in helping PSG win the French title for the fourth time. Zlatan Ibrahimovic (SWE/forward) France's player of the year in his debut Ligue 1 season in 2012/13, the Swede has been even better this time around. He leads the Ligue 1 scorers' charts with 25 goals and has 40 goals in all competitions, breaking the previous club record of 39, set by the Argentine Carlos Bianchi in 1978. The 32-year-old is irreplaceable and scored hat-tricks in wins at home to Nice and away to Toulouse. He has also provided 11 assists, the most in the division behind James Rodriguez of Monaco. Edinson Cavani (URU/forward) Cavani has actually been a little bit of a disappointment since his arrival for a Ligue 1 record 64 million euros (£52.9m, $88.9m) last summer. However, despite being forced to spend most of his time out wide in PSG's three-man attack because Zlatan Ibrahimovic must start through the middle, and despite spending the whole of February out injured, the Uruguayan has still weighed in with his fair share of goals. He has found the net 25 times in all, including 16 in Ligue 1. Ten of those goals came in a run of 11 matches before Christmas, and his individual strike against Bastia in October is a contender for goal of the season. Thiago Motta (ITA/midfielder) The Brazilian-born Italian international midfielder is the man who truly makes PSG tick. After missing large chunks of last season due to injury, the 31-year-old Motta has hardly missed a match this time around and controls the tempo of the game in a three-man midfield which also features the energy of Blaise Matuidi and the creative spark of Marco Verratti. The textbook Motta performance came in the 2-0 home win against Bordeaux in January, when he completed 130 passes in a majestic display. That Motta didn't play in the 2-0 loss at Evian in December, one of only two defeats suffered by PSG this season, is no coincidence. After all, he has been on the losing side just three times in 57 Ligue 1 appearances for the club. Thiago Silva (BRA/centre-back) Centre-back Silva, 29, is the captain of both PSG and Brazil. While by no means the most physically imposing of defenders, his reading of the game is second to none and the former AC Milan player is considered by many as the very best in his position in the world. Spent six weeks on the sidelines in the autumn with a thigh injury but otherwise has marshalled the Paris defence and has helped them claim the best defensive record in Ligue 1 once again. Made his 50th Ligue 1 appearance for the club against Rennes on Wednesday and is a nominee for the Ligue 1 Player of the Year award along with Ibrahimovic and Motta. Gregory Van der Wiel (NED/right-back) After a difficult first season in France following his transfer from Ajax, Dutch international Van der Wiel has flourished in the current campaign. Coach Laurent Blanc puts far greater emphasis on his full-backs getting forward than his predecessor Carlo Ancelotti, and Van der Wiel's rampaging runs from right-back have been a prominent feature this season and have also helped create several important goals, including Maxwell's equaliser in the 2-1 win away to bitter rivals Marseille in October. As a result, Van der Wiel has seen off the competition from Christophe Jallet to become the first choice in the position."
373,07/05/2014,23:05,Football: Domestic bliss eases European pain for PSG,"Paris Saint-Germain have spent vast sums over the last three years building a squad of international superstars, but a goal scored by a Paris-born striker will be remembered as the defining moment of their season.","That goal, though, was scored by PSG fan Demba Ba for Chelsea three minutes from the end of the Champions League quarter-final second-leg tie between the clubs and it took the English side into the last four on away goals. For the second season running, PSG fell just short when they stood on the brink of a place in the Champions League semi-finals, having been beaten by Barcelona, also on away goals, 12 months earlier. But this season can still go down as the best in the club's history after they won their fourth French title, and second in a row, on Wednesday, having also lifted the League Cup by beating Lyon in the final at the Stade de France last month. Progress has been made since Laurent Blanc replaced Real Madrid-bound Carlo Ancelotti in the dugout last summer, and PSG are on the verge of setting a new Ligue 1 record points tally, currently standing just one short of the previous best of 84 set by Lyon in 2006. They have also already set a new record for the most goals scored in a French top-flight season, with Zlatan Ibrahimovic, having scored 40 goals in all competitions this season, beating the previous individual club best of 39 set by Carlos Bianchi in 1978. They are a more fluent, more cohesive side than 12 months ago, and Blanc deserves credit for the job he has done, especially as PSG were a club in turmoil when he took over last summer following the departure of Ancelotti to Real Madrid and the resignation of sporting director Leonardo, combined with the threatening emergence of big-spending Monaco. Blanc could scarcely have been further down the club's list of targets for the job and yet he wasted little time in finding a winning formula, settling on a 4-3-3 formation that brought the best out of the midfield trio of Thiago Motta, Marco Verratti and Blaise Matuidi, even if it partly meant sacrificing record signing Edinson Cavani. The Uruguayan has had to settle for a role out on the flank with Ibrahimovic still the undisputed star of the side, but Cavani has still delivered 16 league goals, while also scoring a brace in the 2-1 League Cup final triumph over Lyon. In the aftermath of the defeat to Chelsea, some doubts were raised about Blanc's suitability to lead the club on to the next level, although he has been offered an extension to his existing contract, which expires in 2015. Blanc has not yet put pen to paper, but that is surely only a matter of time now following the clinching of the first league and cup double in the club's history, to which can be added their victory in the season-opening Champions Trophy. As deep as the disappointment of exiting the Champions League was, the club's owners Qatar Sports Investments did initially set a timescale of five years to win the competition, although the spectre of punishments from UEFA in relation to their Financial Fair Play rules may set them back a little further. ""I get the impression that the Champions League is all that matters. We are making winning the French title, a national Cup and the Champions Trophy banal,"" said Blanc recently, complaining that their domestic success was being ""devalued"". Chelsea reached the last eight or further in the Champions League seven times in 12 seasons before finally winning the trophy in 2012, while Abu Dhabi-owned Manchester City have yet to go beyond the last 16 in three attempts. Those experiences suggest that PSG will have to be patient before conquering Europe, all the more so now with the prospect of UEFA sanctions hanging over the Parc des Princes, but for now they can at least take some satisfaction from the fact that they reign supreme at home."

They remain just two points clear of the relegation zone, while Rennes -- Guingamp's victims in the French Cup final -- kicked off at the Parc des Princes just one point better off. PSG coach Laurent Blanc named Zlatan Ibrahimovic on the bench for the game against Rennes, with the Swede set to make his first appearance since suffering a thigh injury in the Champions League quarter-final, first leg against Chelsea just over a month ago. Without Ibrahimovic, Paris have toiled in the league, losing at Lyon last month and then missing a chance to wrap up the title when they had to settle for a 1-1 draw at Sochaux 10 days ago.

However, it has allowed them the chance of sealing the title at their Parc des Princes home, which will undoubtedly have a party atmosphere on Wednesday should PSG prove successful. And adding to the festive feel, star striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic is in line to make his return from a hamstring strain. And there is no reason to assume the game will go any other way against a Rennes side who lost 2-0 to Guingamp in Saturday's French Cup final, but who are fighting for their lives, sitting just three points above the relegation zone. PSG have had an extra few days off after this fixture was postponed from the weekend as Rennes were involved in the Cup final. But that has not meant things have been plain-sailing, with press speculation claiming that record signing Edinson Cavani could be bound for the English Premier League with both Manchester United and Chelsea mooted as possible destinations There has also been talk of AC Milan legend Paolo Maldini becoming the club's new sporting director, a post that has been empty this season following Brazilian Leonardo's departure in June after he was handed a lengthy 12-month ban for barging a referee. The French champions have not commented on the rumour, preferring to focus on Wednesday's match, but Maldini himself told BeIN SPORTS, who are owned by the same Qatari family that owns PSG, that the club does not need him, nor a sporting director. Meanwhile, things are not entirely tranquil at PSG's only remaining title rivals Monaco. Despite a stunning first season back in the French top flight, in which they are guaranteed a top two finish -- and consequently a place in next season's Champions League group stages -- there remains uncertainty over coach Claudio Ranieri's future, with just one year left on his contract. Not that Ranieri seems worried. ""I think this week I will speak (with club officials) to set up a meeting,"" said the Italian. ""Now that we're assured of second place, things should speed up. ""But the more time that passes, the more sure I am of one thing, although I'll keep that to myself. ""What is certain is that I will be coaching next season,"" he added somewhat ambiguously. However, he was keen to remind his bosses just how well he thinks he has done this season. ""I have a contract (until June 2015). The management know what I've done, we've had a great season,"" he said. ""I think I've done a very, very, very good job this season! It's not easy to come up from the second division and have the season we've had."" Barring an unlikely turnaround, Monaco will finish second. They host Guingamp, themselves desperate for points as they sit just one point above the relegation places, on Wednesday but trail PSG by eight points with just three games remaining. And as PSG have a vastly superior goal difference (+15) Monaco would almost certainly need to win their remaining three games and see PSG lose all three of theirs in order to snatch the title, something Ranieri is not banking on. ""I've said it before, only PSG can lose the title. I just want us to win our last three games, without thinking about PSG,"" he said."
377,02/05/2014,02:25,Football: Rennes gunning for French Cup final revenge,French football's great underachievers Rennes will look to end a major trophy drought of more than four decades when they face Brittany rivals Guingamp in Saturday's Cup final at the Stade de France.,"Rennes' recent history has been peppered with draining disappointment, none greater than their defeat in the 2009 French Cup final against the same Guingamp side, albeit one who were then in the second tier. On that occasion, Rennes took a second-half lead only for a brace of goals by Brazilian forward Eduardo to give Guingamp the first, and to date only, major trophy success in their history. Rennes were also beaten by Saint-Etienne in last season's League Cup final, leaving them still without a major title since beating Lyon to lift the Cup back in 1971. Such a record is not good enough for a club from the capital of the prosperous region of Brittany and owned by the billionaire Francois Pinault, and a second final defeat to Guingamp - the club where Didier Drogba shot to prominence from a town with a population of little more than 7,000 - five years later is unthinkable. However, Rennes coach Philippe Montanier has played down talk of revenge and also insisted that his team should not feel under too much pressure, pointing to the fact that Guingamp are now a top-division side and have already won both league meetings of the teams this season. ""It's 15th in the league against 16th,"" said Montanier, who is hoping skipper Romain Danze will be fit in time to feature. ""There is no favourite especially as a final is a one-off occasion. Guingamp maybe have the psychological advantage because they have beaten us twice in the league this season. But it will be an evenly-matched final."" When asked whether the 2009 final between the teams would have any bearing, the former Real Sociedad coach replied: ""I don't think so. Only Danze is left from that game and it was five years ago. ""The context is different and so are the teams - Guingamp were in Ligue 2 at the time. For us it's more about focussing on a final than worrying about revenge or what happened five years or 35 years ago. ""We have nothing to lose because if we lose people will continue to say that we are a team that always loses in finals. And if we win we will have ended a wait of 43 years. ""It would be a huge disappointment if we lost, but brilliant if we won."" Both clubs remain in danger of relegation to Ligue 2 with just three games left in the league campaign, but for Guingamp - coached by former Rennes playmaker Jocelyn Gourvennec - the knockout competition has proved to be a welcome distraction. Inspired by the goals of Malian international striker Mustapha Yatabare, who has netted seven in the competition so far, Guingamp's run to the Stade de France included a 3-1 extra-time victory against Monaco in the semi-finals. With Rennes beating second-tier Angers 3-2 in the other semi-final tie, that set up a Breton derby at the national stadium and French Football Association president Noel Le Graet, who hails from Guingamp, is certain the sell-out 80,000 crowd will make it an occasion to remember. ""This final is for the people of Brittany who are coming back to Paris, and I'm sure we will see the same spectacular show that we saw in 2009,"" said Le Graet. ""The clubs have agreed to both provide traditional Brittany music, with 50 musicians each. After that, long live the sport, nothing more."" If Danze does play, the only absentee for Rennes will be left-back Cheik M'Bengue, who has a thigh problem. Guingamp have a fully-fit squad with Lionel Mathis - their only survivor from 2009 - available after injury."
378,01/05/2014,13:04,Football: PSG trio shortlisted for Ligue 1 player of year,Zlatan Ibrahimovic is in the running to win France's player of the year prize for the second year running after being one of three Paris Saint-Germain players shortlisted on Thursday.,"Swedish striker Ibrahimovic is the leading scorer in Ligue 1 this season with 25 goals and has bagged a club record tally of 40 in all competitions, despite not finding the net since the middle of March, with injury keeping him on the sidelines for the past month. As well as Ibrahimovic, champions-elect PSG also have central defender and skipper Thiago Silva and Italy midfielder Thiago Motta in the running for the prize, with the fourth and final nominee Monaco's Colombian playmaker James Rodriguez. The latter is also nominated for young player of the year along with his Monaco colleague, the left-back Layvin Kurzawa, PSG midfielder Marco Verratti and Toulouse's Ivory Coast defender Serge Aurier. The winners will be announced at a ceremony on Sunday, May 11."
379,25/04/2014,02:29,Football: PSG on brink of second straight Ligue 1 crown,Paris Saint-Germain can wrap up their second straight Ligue 1 title this weekend as relegation-threated Sochaux provide what could be their final obstacle on Sunday.,"A 10-point lead, following a sparkling domestic campaign which has seen Laurent Blanc's side suffer just two defeats, means the title is theirs with a lunch-time win away to Sochaux or 24 hours earlier if Monaco lose at relegated Ajaccio. Herve Renard, the flamboyant Sochaux coach who memorably led Zambia to their first African championship in 2012, has worked miracles to lift his men within three points of safety after taking over in mid-season. The Frenchman would ideally hope PSG arrive at the Stade Auguste Bonal with the title wrapped up and in relaxed mood to face his players, who he told recently to ""never give up"" in their remarkable bid to avoid the drop. While PSG's season was severely damaged by their Champions League quarter-final exit against Chelsea, a 2-1 victory in the League Cup final last weekend over Lyon and a laboured 1-0 midweek win over Evian has helped lift the gloom of another failed European campaign. Blanc was hardly satisfied by the form of his players on Wednesday and is just eager to tie up the title race before deciding on his own future for next season. ""It wasn't our best match of course but we got the job done,"" said Blanc, following Blaise Matuidi's late winner against Evian. ""We have to improve (against Sochaux) or we'll have the same problems and it's up to the players and staff to think about this. ""Nothing is ever accomplished in football if you don't put in the necessary ingredients,"" continued the former Bordeaux and France coach. ""I have told the players that the title isn't won yet and we're still missing that final little effort but nothing is ever easy. While few, if any, believe PSG can self-destruct from their position of power, a celebration has already been planned for the final day of the season on May 18 when Montpellier come to the capital's cauldron. After the ugly scenes of violence and hooliganism that marred their trophy celebration last year, it has already decided there will be no party in the streets of Paris this time around. Elsewhere, Lille have a stranglehold on third spot and carry a seven point advantage to Bordeaux, while their closest pursuers Saint-Etienne cling to a Europa League spot by just two points over bitter rivals Lyon. Saint-Etienne are on the road at Evian on Saturday while Lyon, who were held 0-0 by Toulouse in midweek, host Bastia at their Stade Gerland 24 hours later. French Cup finalists Guingamp have been sucked into a relegation dogfight and host an equally desperate Valenciennes outfit in a massive match to keep surging Sochaux at bay. The Brittany club are just two points above Renard's side while Valenciennes are a further four adrift. Nantes host Marseille in the only match on Friday while Lorient make the short trip to Rennes, Montpellier host Toulouse and Reims head south to Nice in the other Saturday fixtures.

380,23/04/2014,21:24,Football: Late Matuidi goal gives laboured PSG victory,Blaise Matuidi struck in the 89th minute to give Paris Saint-Germain a 1-0 win against struggling Evian at the Parc des Princes on Wednesday and take the capital club to the brink of the title.,"It looked like PSG would have to settle for a point against their 10-man opponents until Lucas played in fellow substitute Matuidi and the France midfielder slotted the ball through the legs of goalkeeper Jesper Hansen at the near post. The result leaves the reigning champions 10 points clear of nearest challengers Monaco with only four games remaining and means they can clinch a second consecutive title with a win away to Sochaux on Sunday, or 24 hours earlier if Monaco lose at relegated Ajaccio. However, the nature of the performance left coach Laurent Blanc far from satisfied at full time. ""The first half was very bad. We appeared to be lacking in motivation and were very slow moving the ball,"" said Blanc. ""There wasn't enough movement and Evian could even have been in front. We had a word with the players at half-time and the second period was better. ""Of course it wasn't our best performance but we did the job in the end."" Fresh from winning the League Cup by beating Lyon 2-1 in the final last Saturday, Blanc's side were looking for revenge on Evian, who beat them 2-0 in the reverse fixture back in December. Evian are still scrapping to avoid relegation but they have performed well against the leading lights in Ligue 1 this season, taking four points out of a possible six against Monaco and also holding Lille. They were unlucky not to take an early lead as well, Danish international Daniel Wass hitting the crossbar from a long-range free-kick in the fifth minute. Wass then forced home goalkeeper Salvatore Sirigu into a good save from a header shortly after, as a PSG team still missing injured top scorer Zlatan Ibrahimovic and showing seven changes from that which beat Lyon struggled to find their rhythm. When they did, Hansen raced off his line to deny Ezequiel Lavezzi and young midfielder Adrien Rabiot fired over as the first half ended goalless. The early kick-off meant the Parc des Princes stands did not really fill up until the second half, but most of the drama was saved for after the restart. Lavezzi was unable to convert a Rabiot cutback from inside the six-yard box before Evian were reduced to 10 men with an hour played when former Marseille defender Kassim Abdallah picked up a second yellow card for a foul on Lucas Digne. Visiting coach Pascal Dupraz shook his head on the touchline, mindful of the onslaught that was to come, but Hansen saved from Lavezzi and Matuidi somehow missed the target after the Evian defence made a hash of dealing with a low ball across goal by the Argentine forward. It looked as if Evian would hold on until, with just a minute remaining, Matuidi struck his fourth goal of the season much to the relief of the home fans. Meanwhile, Lyon had to settle for a 0-0 draw away to Toulouse, a result which leaves Remi Garde's side in fifth spot, two points behind rivals Saint-Etienne and three clear of Marseille in sixth. OL must finish in the top five to qualify for next season's Europa League."

382,19/04/2014,23:56,Football: Cavani scores brace as PSG win League Cup,"Paris Saint-Germain won France's League Cup on Saturday, beating Lyon 2-1 in the final at the Stade de France to secure the first leg of a likely domestic double.","Edinson Cavani was the match-winner for Laurent Blanc's side, scoring a first-half brace, one of which came from a controversial penalty, and while Alexandre Lacazette pulled a goal back in the second half, PSG proved just too strong for a Lyon outfit who had beaten them in Ligue 1 just six days earlier. It is the second trophy won by the club from the French capital since their takeover by Qatar Sports Investments in 2011 and subsequent transformation into one of the wealthiest clubs in Europe, following their title triumph last season. And their League Cup victory -- their fourth in the 20-year history of the competition -- could be followed by another Ligue 1 crown as early as next Wednesday, although they must hope nearest rivals Monaco lose on Sunday for that to happen. ""It is a privilege and an honour to play in a final but you have to win it, and we won it,"" said Blanc. ""It was difficult because Lyon were very good, especially in the second half. We're having a good season but for people to remember it we had to win titles and that's the first one."" PSG had been in the doldrums following their Champions League quarter-final exit to Chelsea at the start of the month and their 1-0 loss in Lyon last weekend had heaped pressure on Blanc, even if it did little real damage to their championship aspirations. Two consecutive games without scoring since the loss of 40-goal leading scorer Zlatan Ibrahimovic to injury had also increased the pressure on misfiring record signing Cavani, but the Uruguayan produced a superb first-half display in which he scored twice and could have had two more goals. The opener arrived with exactly three minutes played, Maxwell playing a one-two with Ezequiel Lavezzi and dinking the ball over advancing Lyon goalkeeper Anthony Lopes for Cavani to poke home. Lyon, back at the Stade de France for the first time since winning the French Cup two years ago, might have equalised moments later, but Bafetimbi Gomis hit the side-netting after good work from his strike partner Lacazette. Gomis then headed an Arnold Mvuemba corner straight at Nicolas Douchez, who was preferred in goal to regular PSG first-choice 'keeper Salvatore Sirigu, just as he had been in the earlier rounds of the competition. However, Paris were on top and Cavani was unlucky not to score with a superb first-time volley from 25 yards that was spectacularly saved by Lopes. Brazilian defender Alex then had the ball in the net following a Lavezzi free-kick only for the offside flag to cut short the PSG celebrations, but they increased their lead from a controversial penalty incident just after the half-hour mark. Lucas got to a long ball forward from Thiago Silva in front of Lopes only to go down under minimal contact from the Portuguese goalkeeper. The incident appeared to take place just outside the box but the referee awarded a penalty, and while Lopes escaped a red card he could do nothing to keep out Cavani's emphatically struck kick from 12 yards, leaving OL with an uphill struggle to get back into the game. ""I'm very disappointed,"" said Lyon coach Remi Garde. ""It's sad to lose a final due to a glaring error like that. What do you want me to say?"" For Cavani, it was his 24th goal of the season, although he then squandered a good opportunity to complete his hat-trick when he blazed over after a piercing run by Lucas. Lyon were down and out at half-time but Garde made a tactical switch eight minutes after the restart, replacing right-back Mouhamadou Dabo with another forward in Jimmy Briand. Lacazette was moved across to the left and three minutes later he collected possession on the flank and cut inside before beating Douchez with a low shot from 20 yards. However, an effort from substitute Nabil Fekir that hit the side-netting was as close as OL came to equalising."

Guingamp will now meet Rennes at the Stade de France on Saturday, May 3 in a rerun of the 2009 final, which a Guingamp side then in the second tier won 2-1. Meanwhile, the defeat will do little to help Monaco coach Claudio Ranieri's prospects of staying in the job beyond the summer at a time when his future is the subject of much speculation. The principality club's billionaire majority shareholder Dmitry Rybolovlev was in attendance at the Stade du Roudourou hoping to see the tournament favourites keep alive their chances of winning major silverware for the first time since their League Cup triumph in 2003. However, it was Guingamp, who remain in danger of relegation from Ligue 1 having lost their last four matches, who got off to a dream start, taking the lead inside six minutes. Argentine number one Sergio Romero has only really been given his chance to impress in the Cups this season and he was once again selected by Ranieri here, but he was too slow in coming to collect a Steeven Langil free-kick and Yatabare pounced to score. Monaco slowly grew into the game, though, and they drew level nine minutes before the interval, Berbatov applying the finish to a low cross by Fabinho. However, Guingamp were the better team and they were unlucky not to win the match in the 90 minutes, with substitute Ladislas Douniama seeing a superb strike touched onto the bar by Romero before the referee dismissed loud appeals for a penalty in injury time when Ricardo Carvalho appeared to handle inside the box. They were not to be denied in extra time, though, with the unmarked Atik netting the crucial second goal in the 112th minute. Romero got a touch to Atik's first-time effort from a Thibault Giresse left-wing cross, but he could not keep it out, and there was nothing the goalkeeper could do when the hosts broke forward and Giresse set up Mali striker Yatabare to score his second of the game, and 18th of the season, with three minutes of extra time left.

They are also second in Ligue 1, although a 10-point deficit to PSG with five games remaining means it is only a matter of time before the capital club win the title. Ranieri has done very little wrong since taking charge at the Stade Louis II, leading them to promotion back to the top flight last season, and he has a year left to run on his contract. However, that has not dampened speculation that the club's billionaire majority shareholder Dmitry Rybolovlev will seek to replace the Italian in the summer, with reports last week linking him with an approach for France great, and current Real Madrid assistant, Zinedine Zidane. ""I don't know if I'll be the coach of Monaco next season,"" said Ranieri. ""But I want to win the French Cup and finish as close to PSG as possible. When the team wins, it's better for everyone."" He added: ""I love football, I love my job and I am very serious about my work. But I acknowledge that it's very difficult to have a career like (Arsene) Wenger or (Alex) Ferguson with a club today."" Monaco, who have won the French Cup five times but not since 1991 when Wenger was the coach, will be without promising left-back Layvin Kurzawa due to injury. His absence is a blow as Monaco attempt to handle the pressure that comes with being favourites against a Guingamp side who have lost their last four matches in Ligue 1. ""We are the big favourites to win the Cup, which is to be expected. The pressure will be on us,"" said Ranieri, although Guingamp will be looking to return to the final of a competition they won as a second-tier side in 2009. On that occasion they stunned their Brittany neighbours Rennes at the Stade de France, and there is a possibility that the clubs could meet again in the final this season. Rennes, who have not won a major trophy since the 1971 French Cup, play second-tier Angers in the first semi-final on Tuesday at the Stade de la Route de Lorient. The Bretons have had a difficult season under Philippe Montanier, who has found life tough since arriving last summer from Real Sociedad, where he was named coach of the year in La Liga. His team lie 14th in the table, meaning they are at risk of finishing in their lowest position in more than a decade, so a lot is riding on Cup success. ""There is a lot at stake,"" said Montanier. ""This club has had a rather strange relationship with the Cup. We can feel the weight of expectation. ""We need to focus on the game rather than what is at stake. We have gone through some difficult times but if we had been offered the chance at the start of the season to play a semi-final in our own stadium we would have taken it immediately."" Angers are bidding to reach the final for the first time since 1957, although their main aim this season is to win promotion to the top flight. Fixtures (both 1900 GMT)"

392,12/04/2014,17:33,Football: Blanc to wait before deciding on new contract,Paris Saint-Germain coach Laurent Blanc says he will wait until after next weekend's League Cup final against Lyon before deciding whether to accept the offer of a new contract.,"Blanc's existing deal is due to expire at the end of next season but negotiations about an extension have been ongoing for some time. His credit took a serious knock with Tuesday's exit from the Champions League to Chelsea at the quarter-final stage, but PSG could secure a second consecutive Ligue 1 title by beating Lyon on Sunday, as long as Monaco lose away to Rennes on Saturday. And the capital club will play Lyon again next Saturday at the Stade de France, so Blanc admits he is focussing purely on the field at the moment. ""I have the offer of a contract but we will wait because there are more important things to worry about on the pitch,"" he said at a press conference on Saturday. ""I will give an answer in 10 days. ""I decided myself that we had something to finish on the field before finalising my extension. I don't want to be distracted by the games that await us. I am very happy in Paris and very, very motivated by what's happening on the pitch."" Blanc added that the days following their Champions League exit have been difficult but said that he is motivated by what is left to play for before the end of the campaign. ""It wasn't easy. The lads were very, very disappointed. Everyone was affected by the elimination,"" said the former France defender. ""The Champions League is a dream. Wednesday and Thursday were not very enjoyable. Now we need to move on. There could be worse ways to end the season. ""We still have the chance to win two trophies. We have got ourselves into a position to win these titles when we could have been left with nothing to play for. ""I get the impression that the Champions League is all that matters. We are making winning the French title, a national Cup and the Champions Trophy banal. The players know that they need to finish the season well."" He added: ""Lyon are a very good team. It is a good thing to have them coming up. Lyon played well in both games against Juventus."""
393,11/04/2014,02:25,Football: PSG hope to seal title after European disaster,"While the thumping hangover following Paris Saint-Germain's Champions League exit in midweek still lingers, the capital club might be able to sooth the pain by securing the Ligue 1 title on Sunday.","Laurent Blanc's expensively-assembled squad were within minutes of the semi-final spot they so badly craved at Chelsea's Stamford Bridge before a late Demba Ba strike took the Londoners through on away goals and plunged PSG into depression. They must now turn their attentions to putting the finishing touches on an almost perfect domestic campaign, and they stand on the brink of a fourth French title as they travel to Lyon on Sunday night. Nearest challengers Monaco sit 13 points adrift in second place with six games to go, and if they lose away to Rennes on Saturday, the path will be clear for PSG to win a second straight championship by beating Lyon at the Stade de Gerland, the same venue where they wrapped up the title last year. The match against Remi Garde's fifth-placed Lyon side will also serve as a rehearsal for the League Cup final between the two teams at the Stade de France on Saturday, April 19. Blanc's reported contract extension past 2015 appeared a formality before the derailment in London but with the club's Qatari owners craving Champions League success, reports this week suggest that he could yet be axed. The coach and his squad have been hit badly by the end of their European adventure and training was cancelled the day after the match as the club got to grips with their defeat. Uruguayan striker Edinson Cavani was targeted as one of the players to underperform on the biggest stage and much has been said of their lack of experience needed to win Europe's biggest competition. ""Difficult to accept a result like that,"" Cavani tweeted after the match. ""We now have to concentrate on our other objectives."" They will be facing a Lyon side who were also eliminated from Europe this week, losing 2-1 away to Juventus in the second leg of their Europa League quarter-final tie to bow out 3-1 on aggregate. Monaco coach Claudio Ranieri will be keen to maintain their six-point lead over third-placed Lille while Saint-Etienne in fourth must win at Reims to keep their slim hopes of qualifying for next season's Champions League alive. Les Verts faltered badly last week when they were held to a 1-1 home draw by Nice and a five-point deficit to Lille needs to be reduced quickly if they hope to return to the European Cup for the first time since 1981. Lille entertain relegation-threatened Valenciennes in a local derby in Saturday's early match. Meanwhile, Marseille make the short trip to Montpellier on Friday and coach Jose Anigo admitted this week he may have made a mistake in taking the job back in December after coming in for a torrent of abuse last weekend during the 3-1 home win against Ajaccio. Anigo, who will return to his primary role of sporting director in the summer, has endured a difficult time since the murder of his son Adrien back in September. ""There has been a form of disrespect and forgetfulness from the fans, so yes you can ask the question,"" he replied when asked whether he regretted taking the job when Elie Baup was sacked. ""Did I make the right decision to offer my services to the club because I got nothing in return and I didn't make more money? ""I possibly got it wrong but I am curious to see how it's going to finish for me."" Elsewhere, Ajaccio will be relegated on Saturday if they lose at home to Bordeaux.

394,04/04/2014,21:32,Football: France sells TV rights for nearly $1 billion,"France's top football league sold domestic television rights for 2016-20 for a record sum of nearly one billion dollars a year, officials said Friday.","The new deal saw Ligue 1 sold for 726 million euros ($994 million) a year and the second division for 22 million euros a year. The Canal Plus cable television broadcaster made the biggest offer to secure the right to the first choice of the two best Ligue 1 matches each week. The previous record for 2008-2012 sold for 668 million euros a year while this season and next the figure falls to 607 million euros. But with Qatari and Russian investors now ploughing huge sums into Ligue 1 clubs -- allowing Paris Saint Germain to buy Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Monaco Radamel Falcao for a combined figure over 120 million euros -- the French Professional League (LFP) had hoped for more. ""I had wanted to put the French championship in the top three in Europe,"" said LFP president Frederic Thieriez, who added that the figure was below but close to what the league had sought. ""I would have liked more because I have big ambitions for French football, but the market has spoken,"" he added. BeIn Sports, a Qatari-backed cable broadcaster, was the second highest bidder. None of the other competitors, such as Eurosport or telecoms firm Orange, won any television rights. The auction put France in fourth place in the European television rights league -- ahead of Germany (675m euros), but behind Spain (750m), Italy (960m) and especially England's Premier League, which earns a massive 1.7 billion euros a year. The LFP had set a reserve price above the 726 million euros announced, but it was not immediately revealed how much they wanted. Thiriez said only that the offers by Canal Plus and BeIn Sport were ""very close"" with tens of millions of euros between them. According to sources close to negotiations, Canal Plus will increase payments from their current 420 million euros a year to about 550 million. BeIn has been paying about 150 million euros a year. Its new deal was not revealed. BeIn could be saving its financial power for bids to UEFA, Europe's governing body, for the 2015-2018 rights to the Champions League, which have to be handed in on Monday, analysts said. Despite the arrival of the Qatar Investment Authority to bankroll PSG and Russian billionaire Dmitry Rybolovlev at Monaco, French clubs say they face growing financial difficulties as they battle to pay top salaries to help them compete in Europe. While PSG are close to qualifying for the semi-finals of Europe's Champions League, other clubs are deep in debt. The French government has put football stars in the group that will have to pay a 75 percent tax on the highest salaries. The French league estimates this will cost clubs 44 million euros a year."
395,04/04/2014,02:26,Football: PSG look for Cavani to step forward in Ibra absence,Ligue 1 leaders Paris Saint-Germain will hope that record signing Edinson Cavani can fill the void left by the absence of injured top scorer Zlatan Ibrahimovic as they prepare to host Reims on Saturday.,"The meeting with the club from the Champagne country comes in between the two legs of the Champions League quarter-final against Chelsea, with Laurent Blanc's side leading 3-1 ahead of Tuesday's return at Stamford Bridge. And given that the capital club sit 13 points clear of nearest challengers Monaco at the top of the table with just seven games left, Blanc is bound to give a rest to some of his key players with Chelsea in mind. One man who will definitely miss the game is Ibrahimovic, who is set for a spell on the sidelines after coming off in the second half against Chelsea with an injury to the back of his right thigh. ""I just hope he comes back quickly because we will need him,"" admitted Blanc of the Swede, who has scored a club record 40 goals in all competitions so far this season. However, one man who stands to benefit from Ibrahimovic's misfortune is Cavani, the Uruguayan who cost 64 million euros (£52.9m, $87.7m) from Napoli last summer. Cavani has scored 21 goals altogether in his debut season in France, but he has only three in an injury-hit 2014 and earlier this week he admitted his displeasure at having to play on the wing in a 4-3-3 formation. ""For a striker who is used to finishing chances, having to fulfil other tasks is not easy,"" he told sports daily L'Equipe, before adding: ""There are things that I need to talk about with the club, things that need to be done differently."" Paris are on a club record-breaking run of 10 consecutive wins in all competitions and have not lost at home in the league since November 2012, so it would be a huge shock if they failed to record a positive result this weekend. Opponents Reims have twice reached the European Cup final themselves, including in the first ever final in 1956, when they were beaten 4-3 by Real Madrid at the Parc des Princes. These days their aims are rather more modest, but they are enjoying an excellent season under coach Hubert Fournier and come into the weekend just a point behind Marseille in sixth. ""It will be difficult, we can't hide that. But we are going to the Parc to get a result,"" insisted Reims' Cape Verde winger Odair Fortes. Elsewhere, second-placed Monaco will look to bounce back from a shock defeat at Evian last weekend when they host Nantes on Sunday, with the principality club's coach Claudio Ranieri sweating on the fitness of Layvin Kurzawa, Joao Moutinho and James Rodriguez. Lille are just six points behind Monaco in third but they face a tricky test at Toulouse, whose five-game unbeaten run means that a top-five finish, and possible European qualification, is not out of the question. ""Europe is not a taboo word for us and it's great that the players are talking about it,"" said Toulouse coach Alain Casanova last week. ""But talking about it and actually going out and doing it are two different things."" The south-western side are poor at home, though, having won just one of their last eight games in front of their own fans. Fresh from winning last week's Rhone derby at Lyon, Saint-Etienne in fourth continue their push for a podium finish and a Champions League berth when they host Nice, while Lyon go to struggling Valenciennes in between the two legs of their Europa League quarter-final against Juventus. Meanwhile, Lorient entertain Evian amid ongoing uncertainty about the future of their long-serving coach Christian Gourcuff, who has been linked with a move to take over the Algerian national team."
396,01/04/2014,02:11,Football: Paris Saint-Germain v Chelsea factfile,Factfile on Paris Saint-Germain and Chelsea ahead of their Champions League quarter-final first-leg tie on Wednesday:,"Form: Having been eliminated by Barcelona on away goals in the quarter-finals last season, PSG are looking to go one better and reach the last four in the Champions League for the first time since 1995. Laurent Blanc's side come into the game at the Parc des Princes in great shape, having beaten Nice 1-0 on Friday to record a club record ninth consecutive win in all competitions. That left them needing just three more wins from their last seven matches to secure a second consecutive Ligue 1 title, and they also have a League Cup final against Lyon to look forward to later this month. In contrast, Chelsea's 1-0 defeat at Crystal Palace on Saturday led manager Jose Mourinho to declare that they could no longer win the Premier League title. A day later, Liverpool replaced them at the top of the table and they would fall four points behind Manchester City if Manuel Pellegrini's side win their two games in hand. However, Mourinho's experience at this level is second to none, and that could give the English club the edge.

397,31/03/2014,23:17,Football: Mourinho tips Chelsea to bounce back against powerful PSG,"Jose Mourinho has ruled his Chelsea side out of the Premier League title race, but he believes they will bounce back from domestic disappointment against Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions League on Wednesday.","The Chelsea manager questioned his players' mentality after a surprise 1-0 loss at Crystal Palace led to them being knocked off top spot in the Premier League by Liverpool. Mourinho loves to play mind games, but with Manchester City poised to leapfrog the Blues by winning their games in hand, it may be true that Chelsea's best chance of silverware now lies with the Champions League. And the Portuguese insists that his team will rise to the occasion as they face the Ligue 1 champions-elect at the Parc des Princes in the first leg of their quarter-final tie. ""Paris is the kind of match they feel comfortable to play. A big match, great stadium, opponents with top quality,"" said Mourinho ahead of the trip to France. Despite that, he says that the tie is finely poised, with PSG having emerged as a leading continental force in the last two years, spending astronomical sums to attract the likes of Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Brazil captain Thiago Silva to France. ""They have some of the best players in the world playing together in the same team, so they are a very powerful team,"" Mourinho said of a side who lost on away goals to Barcelona at the same stage last season. ""They are big, big, big candidates."" While Mourinho is driven by the desire to become the first coach to win the European Cup with three different clubs following previous triumphs with Porto in 2004 and Inter in 2010, Ibrahimovic is still aiming to win the greatest prize in club football for the first time. But, at the age of 32, the Swede seems to have belatedly reached his prime, with his tally of 40 goals in all competitions this season breaking the PSG club record. If the consensus in England seems to be that Ibrahimovic always disappoints at the highest level, Mourinho, who coached the maverick striker at Inter in 2008/09, thinks rather differently. ""I only coached him for a year but it was a good year, a good experience and I rate him as one of the best players I have ever coached,"" he said. PSG have not lost in 28 home European games and are currently on a club record-breaking run of nine straight wins in all competitions. They are running away with the Ligue 1 title and come into April 13 points clear of nearest challengers Monaco. They were some way short of their best in Friday's 1-0 win at Nice, but coach Laurent Blanc admits that thoughts were already on Chelsea. ""We can say that the players were already thinking about Chelsea. On Wednesday we will need to do better in the final third,"" said Blanc, who was a player at Barcelona in the late 1990s when Mourinho was on the staff at the Camp Nou. ""The best preparation (for Chelsea) was to win and, while we didn't play brilliantly against Nice, we got the result. Sometimes there are games like that."" Blanc will hope that his side are able to raise their game against the London club as PSG seek to live up to the sky-high expectations surrounding them inside France, where there is a growing belief that they can go all the way and lift the trophy in Lisbon in May. Just as Chelsea were transformed after being taken over by Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich a decade ago, the arrival of Qatar Sports Investments has made PSG capable of competing with Europe's very best, and the squad stand to earn a bonus of 1 million euros (£826,000, $1.38m) per man if they win the trophy. Silva will sport a mask to protect a fractured cheekbone but Gregory van der Wiel is unlikely to play due to a nagging knee problem so Christophe Jallet is set to play at right-back. For Chelsea, Mourinho has said he expects Samuel Eto'o to miss the game because of a hamstring injury and Nemanja Matic is ineligible."
398,30/03/2014,23:00,Football: Ivorians star for Lille and St. Etienne,Ivory Coast international Salomon Kalou grabbed an injury time winner for Lille in Ligue 1 action on Sunday while his compatriot Max Gradel was the hero in Saint-Etienne's 2-1 derby win at arch rivals Lyon.,"Lille had earlier tightened their grip on third place with a dramatic 1-0 over Guingamp when Kalou came off the bench to prod the ball home in the 92nd minute to snatch three desperately needed points for Rene Girard's side. But in the weekend's final match, Gradel scored with 16 minutes left to keep Saint-Etienne three points behind Lille, and the final Champions League berth, with seven matches left. In a tense Rhone derby at Lyon, Turkish international Mevlut Erding scrambled home a right wing cross in the 28th minute to put Saint-Etienne in front. However Lyon responded 11 minutes later when Bafetimbi Gomis laid on a pinpoint cross from the wing which Alexandre Lacazette skillfully volleyed home to level the match at 1-1. It was the 22-year-old Frenchman's 14th goal of the season, drawing him level with Paris Saint-Germain's Edinson Cavani as the second top scorer in Ligue 1 behind PSG's Swedish talisman Zlatan Ibrahimovic who rests on 25. It was then down to Ivory Coast striker Gradel to steal the headlines, as the former Leicester City, Bournemouth and Leeds United player, plucked the winner with a quarter hour to play. Earlier at Lille, the match appeared to be heading for a goalless draw before Kalou popped up inside the six yard box to knee the ball home following a corner from the right that led to a scramble. ""We came out of that one very, very well,"" said a delighted Girard. ""We're still in third so where is the problem? I think that many teams in France would like to be in third place even if we've struggled of late and have been missing efficiency,"" he added. ""We've got some complicated matches coming up so we'll just have to see. I was sorry to see some of the players whistled (by Lille fans) but we're not going to place too much importance on that. It was the public, it was not supporters."" continued Girard. In the only other match on Sunday, Rennes made it back-to-back league wins with a confident 3-0 home success against Bastia that moved them eight points clear of the drop zone. It was the first time this season that the Brittany outfit had picked up three straight victories following their French Cup quarter-final success over Lille on Thursday. They will now play second division Angers for a place in the Stade de France final against either Monaco or Guingamp. ""It's been a beautiful week, with three wins in three matches without conceding a goal,"" said Rennes coach Philippe Montanier. ""It boosts morale after the many difficult weeks. ""It's a week which has put us on the right track. We took another step towards staying in the top flight, and the perspective of a French Cup semi-final has spiced up our season."" The Corsican outfit remain in 10th position. Monaco suffered a surprise 1-0 defeat away to Evian on Saturday to leave PSG well on track for a second straight French title. Laurent Blanc's PSG side warmed up for their Champions League showdown against Chelsea on Wednesday with a 1-0 win over Nice on Friday. Elsewhere on Saturday, Odair Fortes scored to earn Reims a 1-1 draw at home to Lorient, after Vincent Aboubakar netted a first-half penalty, while there were goalless stalemates between Montpellier and Valenciennes and Nantes and Bordeaux. Marseille scored in the dying minutes to salvage a 1-1 draw at relegation-threatened Sochaux while Ajaccio and Toulouse battled to a 2-2 draw in Corsica."

The match appeared to be heading for a goalless draw before Kalou popped up inside the six yard box to knee the ball home following a corner from the right that led to a scramble. The win extends Lille's advantage to six points over fourth placed Saint-Etienne who are involved in the Rhone derby at Lyon in the weekend's final match later on Sunday. Lyon are alone in fifth spot and nine points adrift of Lille and the all important final Champions League berth for next season. Earlier, Rennes made it back-to-back league wins with a confident 3-0 home success against Bastia that moved them eight points clear of the drop zone.

The hosts dominated from the outset with Romain Alessandrini opening the scoring after 14 minutes and Swedish striker Ola Toivonen doubling their advantage on 28 minutes. Cameroonian midfielder Jean Makoun rounded off the scoring after 59 minutes. The victory lifts Rennes up to 12th position and eight points above the relegation zone with seven matches to play. The Corsican outfit remain in 10th position. Monaco suffered a surprise 1-0 defeat away to Evian on Saturday to leave Paris Saint-Germain 13 points clear at the top of the Ligue 1 table with just seven games left. Toulouse missed the opportunity to leapfrog Marseille into the top six as they were held to a 2-2 draw by Ajaccio in Corsica. The visitors had fallen two goals behind as Ricardo Faty and Gadji Tallo netted for Ajaccio, but Issiaga Sylla pulled one back before Clement Chantome, the on-loan PSG midfielder, equalised. But Toulouse missed a great chance to win the game when Jonathan Zebina saw a stoppage-time penalty saved by Guillermo Ochoa in the home goal. Elsewhere on Saturday, Odair Fortes scored to earn Reims a 1-1 draw at home to Lorient, for whom Vincent Aboubakar netted a first-half penalty, while there were goalless stalemates between Montpellier and Valenciennes and Nantes and Bordeaux. On Friday, champions PSG took another step towards retaining their title and warmed up for next Wednesday's Champions League quarter-final first leg at home to Chelsea by winning 1-0 at Nice."
400,25/03/2014,02:15,Football: PSG ready for acid test of European ambitions,"When Qatar Sports Investments bought Paris Saint-Germain in 2011, they gave themselves five years to win the Champions League, but hopes are high in the French capital that they could get there ahead of schedule.","Having matched last season's achievement of reaching the quarter-finals of Europe's leading club competition, PSG are now preparing to face Jose Mourinho's Chelsea in this year's last eight next month. It will be the first true test of Laurent Blanc's side, who have not been suitably challenged domestically and have cruised through to this stage in Europe without having to play any of the continent's biggest names. PSG have lost just one league game since March last year and last Friday's 1-0 victory at Lorient allowed them to make it a club record eight wins on the bounce in all competitions. Under Blanc, they are 10 points clear at the top of Ligue 1 and are almost certain to retain the title won last year under Carlo Ancelotti. They have scored 70 goals in 30 league matches and Zlatan Ibrahimovic alone has 40 in all competitions, breaking the club record for the most goals in one campaign. But they are only doing what their enormous budget means they should be doing. In France, no other club can really compete financially -- not even Monaco -- and that gulf has translated onto the field. Two draws in two games against Monaco and a draw at home to third-placed Lille before Christmas suggest that it has not been a cakewalk, but even Blanc himself says that their domestic league is not enough of a challenge to prepare them for the pressures of Europe. Even there they have not been presented with a true test of their credentials, having cruised through a group containing the modest trio of Olympiakos, Benfica and Anderlecht before brushing aside a struggling Bayer Leverkusen. No wonder sports daily L'Equipe's front page headline asked if PSG were 'Ready For The Big Step Up' prior to the draw being made last Friday, and Chelsea will be just that. Possession is king for PSG, with Thiago Motta, Marco Verratti and Yohan Cabaye all available to Blanc in midfield, but Mourinho's side will be happy for their opponents to have the ball. Chelsea will also ask serious questions of a defence that has looked vulnerable at times in Europe this season - goalkeeper Salvatore Sirigu was PSG's best player in the second leg against Leverkusen, and a fractured cheekbone suffered by captain Thiago Silva against Lorient is a cause for alarm. Silva and Ibrahimovic are the biggest influences in this PSG side and, at the age of 32, the latter is personally driven by the desire to win the biggest prize of all in club football having fallen short so many times before. In France, observers are confident of PSG's credentials, with 60 percent of those responding to a L'Equipe poll saying that Blanc's side would beat Chelsea, while Mourinho himself tried to claim at the weekend that PSG against his side. The financial incentive is certainly there for PSG, with the club's mega-rich owners offering a bonus of 1 million euros (£833,000, $1.38m) per player if they can win the trophy this year. But that might prove a step too far. After all, this season's quarter-final line-up is the strongest in recent memory, with all eight clubs advancing having won their groups. Six of the eight quarter-finalists have won the European Cup 23 times between them. Atletico Madrid have at least been to the final. ""There are teams who have a legitimacy in the Champions League in terms of experience that we don't have, but I think the consideration that our opponents have for us has increased,"" said Blanc recently, although PSG need only look to Chelsea if they doubt that patience might still be required even when throwing enormous of money chasing the dream. A decade ago, the London club were themselves new to this level and they reached the last eight or further seven times in 12 seasons before finally winning the trophy in 2012."

Playing in front of crowds in the region of 1,000 fans, they now stand two matches from a dream date at the Stade de France, a bumper payout and even a place in the Europa League. They host Angers on Tuesday, a club enjoying a fine campaign of their own and just outside the promotion places back to Ligue 1. Most of the Moulins' squad, maintain jobs outside of football, but that has not stopped them taking the scalps of top flight clubs Lorient and Toulouse in previous rounds. Club chairman Vincent Rondet is expecting the tie to generate great enthusiasm with the match set to be played at neighbouring, fifth division club Gueugnon's 14,000-capacity Jean-Laville stadium. ""This has never happened to the club and there's a real excitement in the city which is decorated in blue and white,"" said Rondet. ""We are awaiting one of the great teams in Ligue 2 (Angers) and I hope we can have the most people possible at the stadium so it will be a great party."" he added. Cannes, a destination more renowned for its glitzy lifestyle and world famous film festival, are the second fourth division side entertaining dreams of writing an unprecedented page in French Cup history. They tackle Ligue 1 side Guingamp at their Pierre de Coubertin stadium hoping to add to the Brittany's clubs recent slide which included a 1-0 home defeat against Lyon on Sunday. The third, and on paper most balanced tie, is between Ligue 1 rivals Rennes and Lille on Thursday, which will provide a welcome distraction for both teams from their contrasting league fortunes. Lille are coming off a well deserved 1-1 draw at Monaco at the weekend but are battling to protect third spot and the all important final Champions League place for next season. Coach Rene Girard, who won the 2012 league championship with Montpellier, has worked wonders with the northern club as they stand on the brink of Cup success and a place in Europe's most prestigious competition. Rennes meanwhile upset Marseille 1-0 at the Velodrome on Saturday to pull six points clear of the relegation zone. Monaco appear resigned to settle for the runner-up place this season in Ligue 1 after falling 10 points back of fellow big spenders Paris Saint-Germain. Their greatest chance of silverware is the French Cup and their Italian coach Claudio Ranieri is expected to field a strong line-up against second division Lens on Wednesday. Lens, the 1998 French champions, travel to the Louis II stadium looking for their first French Cup after losing finals in 1948, 1975 and 1998. A return to the top flight is their priority, lying second in their division, and a domestic double would delight their raucous 'blood and gold' supporters who last went to the Stade de France in 2008 when they lost the League Cup final 2-1 against Paris Saint-Germain.

402,21/03/2014,23:25,Football: PSG maintain title march against valiant Lorient,"Paris Saint-Germain, fresh from drawing Chelsea in the Champions League quarter-finals, maintained their march to a defence of their Ligue 1 title with a 1-0 win over spirited Lorient on Friday.","Thiago Motta's first half goal was all that split the two teams with the valiant mid-table hosts giving Laurent Blanc's side plenty of nervy moments in Brittany. The hard fought win on Lorient's artificial pitch at their Stade du Moustoir extended PSG's crushing lead at the top of Ligue 1 to 11 points, with second-placed Monaco in action on Sunday against third-placed Lille. ""We can't always win 3,4 or 5-0. We must congratulate the players even if it was not an extraordinary performance,"" said Blanc, who insisted that his team had not been distracted by their impending clash with Chelsea. ""All reporters believe that we have talked of nothing but Chelsea, that it's difficult to think of Lorient. But tonight we were at the Moustoir, not at  Stamford Bridge."" For PSG, who prevailed despite not being at the top of their game, this success was their sixth in a row in Ligue 1 and their eighth on the trot in all competitions. The one sore point for Blanc was the injury suffered by captain Thiago Silva, who had to come off early on in the first half. Blanc elected to field Brazilian Marquinhos in place of his compatriot Alex in central defence, with Marco Verratti regaining his place in midfield from Yohan Cabaye after a two-game absence. Christophe Jallet came in for the injured right back Gregory Van der Wiel against his former club. On the right Blanc preferred Ezequiel Lavezzi to Lucas. Lorient kept the champions-in-waiting at bay until the 41st minute, when in a move inspired by Zlatan Ibrahimovic, Motta broke the deadlock. Ibrahimovic conjured up an exquisite back-heeled flick of the ball to Edinson Cavani down the left, with the Uruguayan returning the favour for the Swede to attempt a close range angled shot. The star striker's attempt was denied by Lorient keeper Fabien Audard but Motta was on hand to pounce on the loose ball, the Brazilian-born Italian only having to nudge it over Audard's goal line. Ibrahimovic by this point was wearing the captain's armband having inherited it from Silva, who was forced to come off in the 24th minute after receiving an accidental knock in the face from Vincent Aboubakar's elbow in an airborne duel. Alex came on in his fellow Brazilian's place. PSG enjoyed almost three quarters of the possession in the first half and would have been relieved to have reaped the one goal reward. Lorient emerged for the restart with fire in their bellies, and Jerome Aliadiere should have done better when blazing his effort high over the PSG cross bar. On the hour, Verratti ceded his place to Cabaye, as Lorient's Aliadiere paid for his lack of precision shooting, making way for Sadio Diallo. Only Audard's reflex action and a large slice of luck kept out Jallet's tight-angled shot on the right from doubling PSG's lead with quarter of an hour remaining. PSG held on despite a couple of late scares, notably when midfielder Bryan Pele had the ball in the back of the PSG net only for his effort to be deemed offside."

404,21/03/2014,02:07,"Football: Arsene Wenger, Arsenal's professorial pioneer","Arsene Wenger will take charge of his 1,000th match as Arsenal manager on Saturday, and the rest of English football is still playing catch-up.","London newspaper the Evening Standard screamed ""ARSENE WHO?"" when the urbane Frenchman was hired by Arsenal in September 1996, but 17-and-a-half years on, he has helped to revolutionise the English game. When Wenger first arrived from Japanese club Nagoya Grampus Eight, Arsenal's old guard baulked at the methods he introduced, which included individualised dietary programmes and intensive stretching routines. His decision to ban the players from tucking into post-match chocolate bars almost sparked a mutiny, but they quickly came to appreciate the wisdom behind his approach. Instituting a slick, passing game, Wenger led the north London club to two Premier League and FA Cup doubles -- in 1998 and 2002 -- before guiding them to an unbeaten season as champions in 2004. The trophies have dried up since a success on penalties against Manchester United in the 2005 FA Cup, but the practices that Wenger introduced -- as well as his longstanding attachment to possession football -- have now been universally adopted. Former Arsenal vice-chairman David Dein has described Wenger, 64, as a ""miracle-worker"", who ""revolutionised the club"". For former Liverpool defender turned television pundit Jamie Carragher, he ""changed the face of English football"". Born and raised in Alsace, north-eastern France, Wenger had an unremarkable playing career with local teams including Mulhouse and Strasbourg, finding time to purse an economics degree that he completed in 1974. His studiousness made him an ideal fit for management, and he enjoyed notable success in France, guiding Monaco to the Ligue 1 title and the French Cup before leaving for Japan in 1995. His sojourn in the Far East only added to the sense of novelty when a slight, bespectacled figure -- quickly dubbed 'Le Professeur' -- was unveiled by Arsenal as the successor to Bruce Rioch on a sunny autumn day in 1996. ""At first I thought, what does this Frenchman know about football?"" said then-captain Tony Adams. ""He wears glasses and looks more like a schoolteacher."" Alex Ferguson's United were England's dominant force, but Wenger quickly set about challenging their superiority, sparking off a ferocious rivalry. His early signings were his most impressive, with young French players like Patrick Vieira and Thierry Henry either plucked from obscurity or rescued from disadvantageous situations and transformed into global stars. The 2003-04 'Invincibles' season was the stuff of legend, as a team spearheaded by Henry cut elegant swathes through the Premier League to complete the first unbeaten top-flight campaign since Preston North End in 1889. Legendary former Nottingham Forest manager Brian Clough -- never one to mince his words -- described Wenger's team as ""nothing short of incredible"". The 2006 Champions League final in Paris should have been their crowning glory, but a 2-1 loss to Barcelona prefigured profound change. Arsenal left Highbury for the 60,000-seater Emirates Stadium -- which Wenger helped to design -- later that year, and the new ground has become associated with unfulfilled expectations. High-profile departures (Cesc Fabregas, Samir Nasri, Robin van Persie), allied with Wenger's reluctance to spend big on new players, have rendered Arsenal's teams flimsier and less pragmatic, and their failures have been spectacular. A side apparently destined for the title collapsed mid-way through the 2007-08 season after a bruising 2-2 draw at Birmingham City and it was against the same team that Arsenal crashed to a calamitous defeat in the final of the 2011 League Cup. Nonetheless, they remain regular Champions League participants, and with the team still in contention in both the FA Cup and the Premier League this season, their nine-year trophy drought may soon reach its end. Whatever the outcome, Wenger's legacy is secure. Remodelled in his image, Arsenal are now an internationally celebrated brand with a huge global fan base, locked in symbiotic synonymity with their pioneering figurehead. ""His team play the right way and he has a stadium that is full every week,"" summarised his old foe Ferguson. ""He has been an incredible manager for that football club."""
405,20/03/2014,02:30,Football: Ibra 'just doing his job' as PSG go to troubled Lorient,Zlatan Ibrahimovic has tried to play down his role in turning Paris Saint-Germain into a leading European force as the Ligue 1 leaders prepare to go to Lorient on Friday evening.,"The Swede has been idolised by the PSG fans ever since he scored a brace to help the capital club come from two goals down to draw 2-2 at home to Lorient on his debut on the opening day of last season. Last weekend he got two more goals in the 2-0 home win against Saint-Etienne that kept the reigning champions eight points clear of Monaco at the top of the table. As a result, he moved on to 40 goals in all competitions this season, breaking Carlos Bianchi's previous club record of 39 in a single campaign, set back in 1978, but Ibrahimovic did not appear overly impressed. ""The important thing was to win. My goalscoring records are just a bonus,"" said the former AC Milan striker, who has 25 goals in Ligue 1 alone this season. ""We're having a fantastic season and that's why we have such a big lead atop the table. It's not because we're just too strong for the league or because Ligue 1 is too easy. It's because we train very hard."" Laurent Blanc's side are also eagerly waiting to discover who they will face in the quarter-finals of the Champions League, with the draw to be made on Friday. Bayern Munich, Real Madrid, Barcelona and Chelsea are among the possible opponents for PSG in the last eight, but none of them will relish coming up against the French champions. Domestically, their dominance is such that they have lost just one of their last 40 Ligue 1 games, so a trip to Lorient's Stade du Moustoir will hold no fears, even if they must adapt to its artificial surface. Lorient have been one of France's most stable clubs in recent years. However, uncertainty over the future of long-serving coach Christian Gourcuff appears to have had an impact on performances, and the mid-table Bretons have won just one of their last eight matches. Gourcuff has spent quarter of a century in charge of Lorient in three separate spells, the most recent an unbroken stint since 2003. In that time he has helped turn a tiny provincial outfit into an established top-division club who are currently enjoying their eighth consecutive season in Ligue 1. But Gourcuff's contract is due to expire in the summer and he has not accepted the offer of a two-year extension, with his relationship with the club's hierarchy having deteriorated in recent times. ""There is no mutual confidence and we have very different feelings on a number of issues,"" said Gourcuff, who has seen many of his best players sold on in recent years and was especially unhappy at losing midfielder Mario Lemina to Marseille on the last day of the summer transfer window. Gourcuff, whose son Yoann plays for Lyon, says he ""still wants to work as a coach"" and admits it would be ""heartbreaking"" to leave Lorient, but his departure from the club now appears inevitable. At least 12-goal leading scorer Vincent Aboubakar should be able to return for the hosts after missing last week's 2-0 loss to Sochaux due to a knee problem. Yohan Cabaye is a doubt for PSG with the back problem he picked up last weekend, so Marco Verratti should return in midfield. Gregory Van der Wiel, the Dutch international right-back, is still struggling with a knee problem. Monaco host third-placed Lille on Sunday looking to increase the gap between the teams, which currently sits at nine points, while Saint-Etienne host Sochaux, Lyon go to Guingamp and struggling duo Marseille and Rennes meet in the pick of the other matches this weekend.

It's a bit odd, but when you have had a transplant you mustn't take any risks. ""Once (your body temperature) goes above 39 degrees, you must go to hospital. The doctor made the right decision.

""Football is: one, my job, two, my passion, three, I have the right to get the flu like anybody else. But it changes nothing,"" he said.

412,07/03/2014,15:09,Football: Runaway PSG looking to avoid complacency,"Fresh from beating their biggest rivals last weekend, Ligue 1 leaders Paris Saint-Germain are determined to avoid complacency when they travel to face Bastia on Saturday.","Laurent Blanc's league leaders eased to a 2-0 victory against Marseille in the Classique at the Parc des Princes in their last outing to move onto 64 points -- a record tally at this stage of the season -- and open up a gap of eight points to nearest rivals Monaco. Apparently too strong for their domestic opponents, the club from the capital could be forgiven for focusing all of their attention on the Champions League, in which they defend a 4-0 lead against Bayer Leverkusen going into the second leg of their last-16 tie next Wednesday. Nevertheless, coming into the trip to Corsica to face a Bastia side who are ninth in the table but have won just one of their last five Ligue 1 outings, Blanc has refused to admit that a second consecutive title is secure. ""It's not up to me to confirm or deny that. I think it's better to be in our situation than that of our pursuers,"" said the 48-year-old. ""There are still a lot of points to be taken. We have a good number of points, but we need more. It's not over. ""Some people will say that if there is too big a gap we will start to lose focus. There is no easy solution. But we have managed to distance ourselves from our rivals and we are not going to complain."" Blanc, who was sweating on the safe return of many of his players from international duty this week, will be without Edinson Cavani for the game. The striker, who returned from more than a month on the sidelines with a thigh injury to score against Marseille, was allowed to go back to his native Uruguay for personal reasons this week. ""Cavani will not play. He will undoubtedly only get back (to France) on Saturday,"" admitted Blanc. ""Of course we'd like him to be there but it's not the case."" Second-placed Monaco entertain relegation-threatened Sochaux as they bid to get back to winning ways following their 2-0 loss at Saint-Etienne last time out. Claudio Ranieri's side are now hoping to secure the automatic Champions League qualification that comes with finishing runners-up as soon as possible, but they can ill afford to underestimate Sochaux, who have won three and drawn two of their last six matches to keep alive their chances of an unlikely great escape from the drop. ""Some people think it will be easy against Sochaux, I think the opposite. I have the feeling that this team is going to stay up,"" said Ranieri, before adding that captain Eric Abidal will miss the game at the Stade Louis II having briefly been admitted to hospital at the start of the week after taking the wrong flu medication. ""Eric Abidal is not quite ready for Saturday. It's the same for Aymen Abdennour, (but) Dimitar Berbatov has improved physically and he will be able to start."" Lille, in third, face a stiff test at home to Montpellier, who have not lost in nine Ligue 1 games, while Saint-Etienne, who are a point off the Champions League places, travel to Lorient later on Sunday. Lyon go to Bordeaux on Sunday night, but Marseille were not happy about having to play host to south-coast rivals Nice on Friday. The game is taking place just 48 hours after a clutch of OM players were in action for their countries in Wednesday's card of international friendlies. Marseille are seeking revenge for a 5-4 defeat to Nice in the French Cup in January, but they will also have to do without top scorer Andre-Pierre Gignac due to suspension.

413,01/03/2014,16:03,"Football: Cavani ready to return for PSG, says Blanc",Paris Saint-Germain coach Laurent Blanc on Saturday confirmed that Uruguayan record signing Edinson Cavani will return from injury in Sunday's Ligue 1 meeting with Marseille.,"Blanc admitted that fringe players Christophe Jallet, Zoumana Camara and Hervin Ongenda are all missing but said that Cavani would feature for the first time since pulling up with a thigh injury in the 2-0 win against Bordeaux on January 31. ""He has worked really well this week,"" said Blanc of Cavani, who has scored 20 goals this season since moving to France from Napoli for a Ligue 1 record fee of 64 million euros ($88m, £52.75m) last summer. ""As long as there are no problems in the last session (on Saturday) he will be in the squad. Will he start? You will see."" Traditionally the biggest game in the French calendar, 'Le Classique' has lost a bit of its lustre recently with Monaco emerging as the biggest threat to PSG's domination of Ligue 1. Marseille are 18 points behind their enemies from the capital coming into the game at the Parc des Princes, although they have boosted their chances of Champions League qualification thanks to a five-match unbeaten run. ""This is a special match. It always will be in my opinion and we know the reasons for that,"" said Blanc, who spent two seasons as a player at Marseille and scored the winner for OM in this fixture in 1997. ""But for there to be a bit of spice to it, both clubs need to be doing well. If there is less pressure, it's maybe because you (the press) are creating less. ""There is always this rivalry between the two clubs, between the south and the north, the capital and the province."" PSG won 2-1 away to Marseille in the reverse fixture in October, despite having Thiago Motta sent off half an hour in and going a goal down. Since then, though, OM have sacked Elie Baup and replaced him with sporting director Jose Anigo until the end of the season. ""They are solid. The reverse fixture was one of our best matches, with 10 against 11 for almost an hour,"" admitted Blanc. ""Paris were very, very strong. We will play our own game. Will they take risks or will they sit back? I don't know. Everyone knows how we will play."""
414,28/02/2014,02:24,Football: PSG ready for test from resurgent Marseille,Paris Saint-Germain host Marseille in France's fiercest rivalry on Sunday night with the capital club hoping to have Edinson Cavani back to help them see off their resurgent opponents.,"Laurent Blanc's PSG side have had a superb last 10 days, crushing Bayer Leverkusen 4-0 in the Champions League and then beating Toulouse 4-2 away last Sunday to maintain their five-point lead over Monaco at the top of the Ligue 1 table. Since then they have been boosted by the news that France midfielder Blaise Matuidi has finally put pen to paper on a new contract tying him to the Parc des Princes until 2018. Now there is real hope that Uruguay striker Cavani will be able to make his comeback after four weeks on the sidelines with a thigh injury. ""The objective is to have him at our disposal against Marseille,"" revealed Blanc. ""We will have to see how the injury evolves, but when I see him in training I think he is close to being ready. In any case, we are not going to take any risks, but things are on the right track."" Bitter rivals Marseille come into the 'Classique' boosted by their recent improved form under interim coach Jose Anigo, which has reignited their hopes of finishing in the top three and qualifying for next season's Champions League. Inspired by Andre-Pierre Gignac, who has scored 12 times in 13 games, OM have won three and drawn two of their last five league matches. That run of results has allowed them to close to within three points of Lille, who remain on the podium despite a poor start to 2014. Now, though, Marseille must try to end a sequence of four successive defeats in all competitions against their old foes. ""It is a really exciting match, but to get a result against Paris would be a massive achievement for us,"" said midfielder Alaixys Romao. ""If we raise our game than why can't we win? We have improved over the last few weeks and are defending better. ""It will be difficult but over one game who knows. Paris don't intimidate me. They play good football so you just hope to show that you can compete at their level."" Meanwhile, second-placed Monaco continue their chase of the leaders with a tough trip to Saint-Etienne, who are fourth. Monaco are unbeaten in 2014 and their Colombian playmaker James Rodriguez says the race is still alive, especially if PSG slip up against Marseille. ""Personally I want to win the title but we know that Paris are very strong,"" said the 22-year-old. ""To get in front of them, we have to show more intensity in our game and win every match because the margin of error is very small. We all know anything can happen in the championship, and Marseille can win at Paris for example."" Elsewhere, Lyon have dragged themselves back into the race for European places but they face a tough test on Sunday at home against Montpellier, who are unbeaten in eight Ligue 1 matches under the leadership of Rolland Courbis. Remi Garde's team are five points behind Lille, who travel to bottom side Ajaccio. While the Corsicans have been cut adrift, Herve Renard's Sochaux have caught a glimmer of light in the their bid to stave off relegation as they sit five points from safety ahead of a home clash with Bordeaux. Third-from-bottom Valenciennes are two points from safety and travel to Reims, while the pick of the other games is a Brittany derby between Rennes and Guingamp.

The win extended the Parisian club's unbeaten home run in the league to 25 matches and served as an ideal rehearsal for Tuesday's trip to Bayer Leverkusen in the last 16 of the Champions League. ""The focus before Leverkusen was above all to win this match,"" reflected Blanc. ""The players have been thinking about Leverkusen but (tonight) they put it to one side and got the job done. ""We could have been more efficient, but to score three goals and not concede any isn't bad,"" added the PSG coach. Defeat for Valenciennes means Ariel Jacobs' side remain in the bottom three, two points from safety and fourth-from-bottom Evian TG. Bearing in mind next week's first-leg tie in Germany, Blanc predictably chose to rotate his squad, making five changes to the side involved in the stalemate at Monaco last weekend. Midfielder Yohan Cabaye made his full debut following his arrival from Newcastle United last month, with Jeremy Menez handed a rare start and Ezequiel Lavezzi returning to the side in place of Lucas Moura. Blanc had expressed concerns of ""mental fatigue"" among his players following a congested run of fixtures but the Frenchman would have been encouraged by the hosts' bright start, but for their profligate finishing. Lavezzi made an immediate impact, charging down a defensive clearance and lofting the ball over goalkeeper Nicolas Penneteau towards Ibrahimovic although the Swede's tame goalbound flick was cleared off the line by Kagelmacher. Lavezzi was then denied by a fine Saliou Ciss block before Penneteau flew to his left to keep out a Thiago Silva header with Ibrahimovic scuffing the rebound across the face of goal and Marquinhos unable to convert at the far post. It was of little surprise when PSG broke the deadlock 18 minutes in, even if the nature of the goal was somewhat fortuitous. Ibrahimovic drilled a 30-yard free-kick into the defensive wall and the ball broke favourably to Lavezzi for the Argentine to stick away his fourth goal of the season. A second very nearly followed soon after as Lavezzi flicked Gregory van der Wiel's cross wide of the far post. The Argentine was then thwarted by Penneteau, who turned his effort round the post, having been played in by Ibrahimovic. The hosts were slicing apart Valenciennes with alarming ease, with Lucas Digne flashing an effort narrowly wide after bursting into the box. Valenciennes failed to register a single effort on target in the first half, their best chance coming on the half-hour when David Ducourtioux dragged wide from 12 yards out. The visitors were hanging on as PSG failed to transform their superiority into goals but Ibrahimovic eased any tension five minutes after half-time as he extended his league-best goals tally to 19, stabbing home after Cabaye's mishit volley bounced into his path. The points were made safe just two minutes later as Lavezzi broke free down the left and played in a cross that Kagelmacher bundled into his own net. Title challengers Monaco could cut the gap back to five points on Saturday, but Claudio Ranieri's men face a tricky trip to Corsica to face Bastia. Already without Radamel Falcao, Monaco will also have to make do without new signing Dimitar Berbatov after the Bulgarian suffered a knee injury in the French Cup victory at Nice in midweek."

The Italian then saw his side triumph 1-0 after extra-time away to Cote d'Azur rivals Nice in the French Cup last 16 on Wednesday as recent signing Dimitar Berbatov got his first goal for the club. That success was achieved despite Ranieri making sweeping changes to his line-up, but now the likes of Eric Abidal, Joao Moutinho and James Rodriguez are set to return to the side. ""I rotated the squad a lot at Nice because Monaco have to play three big games this week,"" said Ranieri, before lauding the contribution of his Bulgarian recruit, who appeared as a second-half substitute. ""Berbatov got the goal. I asked him to play in between the lines and he did that well."" Bastia, meanwhile, have had a great week. After failed to register an away win all season, they ran out 3-1 victors at Toulouse in a rearranged game on Tuesday that was notable for Djibril Cisse's first goal since returning to French football last month. ""Djibril put in a courageous performance. It was important for him to score,"" admitted Bastia coach Frederic Hantz, who is hoping the 32-year-old former Marseille striker can score enough goals to stake a late claim for a place in France's World Cup squad. ""We need to be careful with him and not go too quickly, so that he is in top form by March, April, May. If we do that we can help him achieve his (World Cup) objective."" Bastia then claimed another away win on Wednesday when the French League (LFP) confirmed that their 2-0 opening-day defeat at Nantes had been overturned because Les Canaris fielded an ineligible player. Hantz's side therefore now have European qualification in their sights, and they will be hopeful of claiming another positive result at Furiani, where only Lyon have taken three points this season. They are without goalkeeper Mickael Landreau due to a calf injury though, and Monaco are defending an unbeaten record in 2014. Nevertheless, they have managed just two wins in their last six league games and could find themselves eight points off top spot come kick-off. Before facing Bayer Leverkusen in Germany in the first leg of their Champions League last 16 tie next Tuesday, PSG entertain struggling Valenciennes at the Parc des Princes on Friday. The capital club, who are still without the injured Edinson Cavani, have not been at their best since hammering Nantes 5-0 last month and could do with a boost in a game that may see January signing Yohan Cabaye make his first start for the club. Third-placed Lille travel to face Evian on Sunday before fourth and fifth face off at the Stade Geoffroy-Guichard as Saint-Etienne meet Marseille. Les Verts have lost just once in eight league games and have won their last five home matches, all without conceding a goal. Marseille, meanwhile, are enduring a season of ups and downs but head to Le Chaudron having taken seven points from a possible nine. ""We are on a good run at home and we are fourth in the table. That gives us reason to be ambitious,"" midfielder Benjamin Corgnet told Saint-Etienne's website. Lyon have also revived their hopes of European qualification via the league in recent weeks, and Remi Garde's side will expect to register three points when they host bottom side Ajaccio.

Lens, who were French champions in 1998 but are currently battling to win promotion back to Ligue 1 after a three-year absence, went on to win the tie in extra-time. The decisive moment arrived in the 94th minute when young defender Jean-Philippe Gbamin took advantage of hesitant goalkeeping by Remy Vercoutre to head home a corner. While Lens can look forward to a trip to the principality next, Lyon's hopes of silverware now appear to rest with the League Cup, in which they will meet Paris Saint-Germain in the final in April. Only four Ligue 1 sides made it through to the quarter-finals, with Monaco advancing thanks to a 1-0 extra-time win at Cote d'Azur rivals Nice on Wednesday, in which Dimitar Berbatov scored the winner, his first goal since arriving from Fulham last month. Rennes will meet Lille in the only last-eight tie between two top-flight sides, while 2009 winners Guingamp will go to Cannes. Fourth-tier amateurs Cannes, the club where Zinedine Zidane started his career, knocked out Saint-Etienne on penalties in the last 64 and followed that up by beating Montpellier 1-0 after extra-time on Tuesday. Montpellier had beaten PSG in the previous round but came up short on a poor pitch on the south coast, although they were also left to rue a missed penalty by Mbaye Niang in extra-time. The other quarter-final tie will see Angers, of Ligue 2, travel to Moulins, an amateur club from central France."
425,13/02/2014,18:58,Football: Monaco furious after tax agreement challenged,"AS Monaco on Thursday expressed ""amazement"" after seven clubs in France's top two divisions decided to challenge an agreement that would allow the Principality club to continue playing in Ligue 1.","The ruling body of the French league, the LFP, announced late last month that Monaco had agreed to pay a fixed sum of 50 million euros ($68.3m, £41m) to avoid being forced into moving their headquarters across the border into France for tax reasons or face being kicked out of the competition. However, top-flight rivals Paris Saint-Germain, Bordeaux, Lille, Lorient, Marseille and Montpellier, as well as second-tier Caen, have decided to contest that settlement in the hope that a different agreement can be found. In response, Monaco released a statement to AFP in which they said: ""Our first reaction is of amazement. ""The discussions with the LFP were carried out within the legal framework (and) a vote with a large majority (16 votes) in favour of this agreement was approved. ""We can therefore only express our stupefaction that this can be challenged just a few days later."" The LFP initially ruled last year that all professional clubs must be set up as French companies for tax purposes, a decision that was made targeting Monaco. Monaco benefit from highly favourable tax laws in the Principality compared to those in place in France itself, meaning operating costs are significantly lower for the club owned by Russian billionaire Dmitry Rybolovlev. They were also exempted from the French government's controversial 75 percent tax rate on earnings over 1 million euros, for which other professional clubs will be liable."
426,12/02/2014,23:48,Football: Berbatov scores to send Monaco through in French Cup,Dimitar Berbatov scored an extra time winner to send Monaco through to the last eight of the French Cup as his new side beat 10-man Nice 1-0 on Wednesday and keep alive their hopes of the domestic double this season.,"The former Fulham forward's goal - his first since moving to Monaco last month - came in the 113th minute of a turgid affair at Nice's Allianz Riviera ground. The 33-year-old Bulgarian met a speculative cross from teammate Lucas Ocampos to divert the ball into the net from five yards out with Nice's keeper Mouez Hassen well-beaten. Berbatov had come on as a second-half substitute, to make only his second appearance for the Monegasques, who currently lie second in France's Ligue 1 five points adrift of defending champions Paris Saint Germain. It was a game of few chances and little excitement with neither side looking like winning until Berbatov pounced. After a dull first half with few clear opportunities for either side, the game burst into life straight after the break, with the dismissal of Nice's Timothee Kolodziejkczak. He was adjudged to have hit Monaco defender Ricardo Carvalho and was promptly sent off, but obviously aggrieved by the decision he took several moments to leave the pitch. Monaco came closest to breaking the deadlock on the hour mark when a header from Ocampos flashed narrowly wide of the left upright. But it was 10-man Nice who should have scored when Mathieu Bodmer seized on a loose ball from a corner just seven yards from goal in the 76th minute but his flick was well-saved by Monaco's goalkeeper Sergio Romero. Both sides had made several changes from their weekend Ligue 1 fixtures. Nice brought in Hassen and Jeremy Pied from the team which lost 2-1 at Valenciennes at the weekend, while Monaco boss Claudio Ranieri, who admitted before the game that the Cup was not his priority this season, made four changes from the side which drew 1-1 with Paris Saint-German on Sunday. In Wednesday's other results, Rennes won 1-0 at Auxerre, Guingamp beat L'Ile Rousse 2-0 and amateur side Moulins from France's fourth tier beat Sete 3-1 to head into the quarter-finals. Lyon, the 2012 winners, and Lens play each other on Thursday for the final place in the quarter-finals."

He is due to miss Ligue 1 games against Monaco, Saint Etienne and defending champions and leaders Paris Saint Germain. Landreau is currently third in Didier Deschamps' pecking order to keep goal for France at the World Cup finals in Brazil behind Tottenham's Hugo Lloris and Steve Mandanda of Marseille. Landreau has 11 caps to his name. He made his debut in the 2001 Confederations Cup, and was a member of the French squad that reached the 2006 World Cup final, although coach Raymond Domenech didn't give him any playing time. After falling out of favour - he was overlooked for Euro 2008 - he earned a recall in 2012 from Deschamps, with Cedric Carrasso making way."

""It was a good game with lots of chances,"" reflected Monaco manager Claudio Ranieri. ""I hope PSG will win the Champions League for French football, and leave a few points for Monaco...."" Lurking at the back post, Pastore, who was drafted into the PSG side as replacement for injured striker Edinson Cavani, was able to score from close range after a corner had been flicked-on from defender Alex. Monaco's response to going behind was immediate and they should have been level just six minutes later, but Emmanuel Riviere squandered a great chance pushing a rebound from Sirigu wide with the goal at his mercy. But it was not all one-way traffic. PSG should have doubled their lead when Ibrahimovic, of all people, squandered a fine opportunity from just five yards out after good play on the left flank between Pastore and Maxwell. The second-half was a more scrappy affair with PSG largely in control. PSG came closest to scoring when Ibrahimovic fired in a fierce free-kick from the edge of the area which Monaco's Croatian keeper Danijel Subasic did well to turn wide in the 55th minute. Both sides had a chance to secure victory in the final minutes. First Fabinho was denied in the 89th minute from giving Monaco - who brought on former Fulham striker Dimitar Berbatov for his debut in the 64th minute - victory after his thunderous shot was well-saved by PSG's Sirigu.

Claudio's Ranieri's men are five points adrift of PSG, and with Colombian star Falcao ruled out for the season with a knee injury, Monaco turned to former Manchester United striker Berbatov in the January transfer window to help fill the void. Berbatov arrived on loan from Premier League strugglers Fulham, with the Bulgarian saying a recommendation from ex-teammate, and former Monaco defender, Patrice Evra convinced him to swap England for the Cote d'Azur. Looking ahead to his first match in Monaco colours, Berbatov said: ""It's the best possible way (to start). ""You play against one of the biggest clubs in football, one of the best players in football (Zlatan Ibrahimovic), so what else can a player want? ""It's going to be a fantastic opportunity for me. ""They are favourites, but they're coming to ours so it will be difficult for them. ""It won't be easy, but we can win Sunday,"" added the 33-year-old, who could start on the bench should Ranieri elect to keep faith with in-form duo Emmanuel Riviere and Valere Germain up front. PSG kept their hopes of a domestic double intact on Tuesday as two goals from Ibrahimovic saw the capital club edge past Nantes 2-1 to seal a place in the final of the League Cup. With several key fixtures on the horizon, including the Champions League last-16 tie against Bayer Leverkusen, PSG are entering what coach Laurent Blanc has dubbed ""money-time"" and is counting on his side to perform. Midfielder Yohan Cabaye, thrust into the midst of a title race after signing from Newcastle United last month, knows victory against Monaco would steer Laurent Blanc's men ever closer to defending their crown. ""It won't be over, there are still 14 matches to play. But a win would bring us closer to the title,"" said the France international, who could be in line for his full debut. Defender Gregory van der Wiel echoed the thoughts of his teammate, adding: ""We want to win. We feel strong.

I was looking for something new,"" said Berbatov, who played alongside the France left-back at Old Trafford between 2008 and 2012. However, he said that the presence of enigmatic Italian coach Claudio Ranieri - another familiar face from his days in England - was also a factor in convincing him to make the switch to a new country. ""I decided to come here because it's a great team. I know the coach. He was working in England, so it was an easy decision to make. I have never been here in France but I think the football, it's really good. ""It's a new experience for me and it's a new adventure for me. I had the chance to train with my new teammates and it was really, really special because I saw how talented the players are that Monaco have."" Considered something of a maverick and known for his languid style, Berbatov, who has also played for Bayer Leverkusen and Tottenham Hotspur, believes his way of playing will help him be successful in the French game. ""You guys, when you watch the game, you want to be entertained, not fall asleep. This is my goal,"" he added. ""Today I saw really nice things from my teammates, really talented players, so it's going to be good for me to work with them and hopefully my style of play is going to be good for the team and for the French league as well."" Berbatov was unveiled to the press along with Monaco's two other January signings, Nigerian left-back Elderson Echiejile and Tunisian centre-back Aymen Abdennour. Echiejile has already made his debut since signing from Braga, but Abdennour, who arrived on an initial six-month loan deal with an option to take up a permanent four-year contract in the summer, will not be able to play for at least another two to three weeks with a thigh injury.

""Cavani will start running again soon but we didn't want to aggravate it so we will not take any risks. We have a big squad and we need to use it when there are injuries,"" added Blanc. ""As for Cabaye, I think he is ready to play. Physically he is fine. He has blended naturally into the squad. If I need to use him I won't hesitate."" The second semi-final on Wednesday sees Lyon play host to second-tier Troyes at the Stade de Gerland as they continue their quest for success on four fronts this season.

""I'm disappointed, I thought Monaco deserved the win,"" said Ranieri. ""It was a good game, but that's football,"" the Italian added. Lorient, who came into the match in 10th spot and within touching distance of the European places, took a shock lead on 13 minutes when Monaco failed to clear a corner kick. Kevin Monnet-Paquet picked up the loose ball following a poor clearance and whipped in a cross that Cameroon striker Vincent Aboubakar met with a firm header to beat Croatian 'keeper Danijel Subasic. However with half-time looming, Ranieri's men equalised on 41 minutes thanks to a clinical finish from Valere Germain. Emmanuel Riviere was the catalyst as he broke into the penalty area before laying off a perfect pass for Germain who made no mistake from close range. The second half provided a more balanced affair with both teams struggling to create clean scoring chances before Jeremie Aliadiere appeared to grab the winner with 17 minutes left. The striker who began his career at Arsenal before spells at Celtic, West Ham, Wolves and Middlesbrough banged the ball home from a rebound to pile the pressure on Monaco before Kurzawa came to their rescue. Monaco now know next Sunday's home clash against Paris Saint-Germain is a must-win situation with their deficit increased to five points after the leaders defeated Bordeaux 2-0 on Friday. Later, Saint-Etienne moved to within one point of third spot with a 3-0 defeat of Valenciennes at home. Lille who are in possession of the final Champions League spot travel to Nice on Sunday. Nantes failed to put pressure on the leading pack as they fell 1-0 at second-from-bottom Sochaux - a win would have lifted them to fifth ahead of the Sunday slate. Reims meanwhile lost 4-2 at home to Montpellier, Evian and Ajaccio's key relegation battle ended all square at 1-1, and Guingamp lost 3-2 at Bastia."
438,01/02/2014,11:50,Football: Monaco dominate deadline day with double swoop,Monaco added to the capture of Bulgaria striker Dimitar Berbatov by signing powerful Tunisia defender Aymen Abennour right at the end of the January transfer window.,"Tunisian international Abdennour, 24, signed from Monaco's Ligue 1 rivals Toulouse, initially on loan but with an option to turn the deal into a permanent four-year agreement in the summer. ""Aymen Abdennour is a very solid defender with a profile that we didn't have in the squad. We have been following him for a long time and so we are very satisfied to have reached a deal with Toulouse to bring him to Monaco,"" vice-president Vadim Vasilyev told the club's website. That deal was passed just before the January transfer window slammed shut and came after the announcement that former Bayer Leverkusen, Tottenham Hotspur and Manchester United striker Berbatov had joined until the end of the season from Fulham to cover for the injured Falcao. Falcao suffered a serious knee injury playing in a French Cup tie last month and is set to miss the rest of the season as well as the World Cup in Brazil. After making major waves in the transfer market last summer, Monaco were one of the busiest French clubs again in the January window, although in general Ligue 1 is spared from the chaotic scenes that come on the final day of the window in England. Monaco had earlier signed Nigerian left-back Elderson Echiejile from Braga in Portugal and giant Ivorian striker Lacina Traore from Anzhi Makhachkala, although the latter was then loaned out to Everton. Paris Saint-Germain settled for just the one January signing in France midfielder Yohan Cabaye, who joined from Newcastle United for a fee of up to 23 million euros (£19m, $31.4m) including bonuses on Wednesday. Cabaye made his PSG debut from the bench in Friday's 2-0 Ligue 1 win against Bordeaux and almost marked the occasion with a goal, hitting the post from a late header. The most notable moves elsewhere in France on deadline day came at Saint-Etienne, where Algeria left-back Faouzi Ghoulam was sold to Napoli for a reported six million euros ($8.1m) and was replaced with Benoit Tremoulinas, capped by France but who had been with Dynamo Kiev. Les Verts also brought back France midfielder Josuha Guilavogui on loan, six months after selling him to Atletico Madrid."
439,31/01/2014,14:22,Football: Chelsea sign teenage Frenchman Zouma,Premier League giants Chelsea announced on Friday that they have signed 19-year-old French centre-back Kurt Zouma from Ligue 1 side Saint-Etienne on a five-and-a-half-year contract.,"The powerful French Under-21 international, who made his first-team debut at the age of 16, will be loaned back to Saint-Etienne until the end of the season. ""Chelsea Football Club has today (Friday) signed Kurt Zouma from St. Etienne,"" read a statement on the Chelsea website. ""He will remain on loan at the French club for the rest of the season."" Chelsea did not disclose how much they had paid to sign Zouma, but reports in the British media and in France suggested that the transfer fee was around £12 million ($19.8 million, 14.6 million euros). Zouma is Chelsea's fourth signing of the January transfer window, after Nemanja Matic, Mohamed Salah and Bertrand Traore. Manager Jose Mourinho said that Chelsea had moved quickly to sign Zouma in order to fend off interest from other clubs, but he revealed that the teenager may be immediately loaned out when he arrives at the end of the season. ""If we don't do it now, probably we can't do it in the summer because other clubs were also very strong on him,"" Mourinho told reporters during his weekly press conference. ""So we did it. Now he stays at Saint-Etienne, pre-season he will join us. We will see if it is to stay or if it is to go on loan."" Upon returning to Chelsea last year, Mourinho spoke of his desire to leave a long-term legacy at Stamford Bridge, and he congratulated the club for signing another highly regarded young player. ""He's another young player in the profile of some Chelsea signed in the couple of last years,"" Mourinho said. ""We liked the profile, we think he's very much adapted to the Premier League. He is a young player for a position where we also need the future. ""He's a player with big potential, physically ready. One thing is to be physically ready, another thing is to be tactically ready. Well done Chelsea."" Zouma, who had also been linked with Inter Milan and Monaco, recently completed a 10-match ban for a challenge that fractured the leg of Sochaux's Thomas Guerbert during a Ligue 1 match last November."
440,30/01/2014,16:05,"Football: Cabaye will make impact at PSG, says Blanc",Paris Saint-Germain coach Laurent Blanc insisted on Thursday that Yohan Cabaye will make his presence felt with the French champions despite the fierce competition for places.,"The 28-year-old France midfielder completed his transfer to the Ligue 1 leaders from Newcastle United on Wednesday, penning a three-and-a-half-year deal in the capital for a fee which is reported to be worth 23 million euros (£19m, $31.4m) including bonuses. Now Cabaye, who played under Blanc for France, must try and work his way into the coach's favoured 4-3-3 formation, where Blaise Matuidi, Marco Verratti and Thiago Motta are considered the first-choice trio in the centre of the park. However, Blanc said Cabaye was just the player he was looking for and said he had no doubts the former Lille man will get enough game time between now and the end of the season to guarantee his place in the France squad for the World Cup. ""I'm very satisfied. I said when the transfer window opened that I would be satisfied if we could bring in one extra player in midfield,"" said Blanc at a press conference ahead of Friday's home match against Bordeaux at the Parc des Princes. ""We had a good number of propositions but there weren't many who had all the characteristics we were looking for. ""I am happy because I know him well. But when I spoke to the directors a month ago I only gave them the profile I was looking for, not the name. ""He will play, you will see. When you have a three-man midfield, if you have four, five or six players who can play there it's not too many. ""People don't ask such questions of Bayern, (Manchester) City, Milan or Juve. The best three play, and then you get injuries and suspensions."" Indeed, with Italy playmaker Verratti suspended and Adrien Rabiot struggling with a knee problem, Cabaye could be thrown straight into the team on Friday, as long as his transfer is officially ratified in time. ""We have not received the letter. We are hoping it will arrive later today (Thursday). If it comes through, he will be in the squad. ""Otherwise he will have to wait until next Tuesday,"" he said, when PSG travel to Nantes in the semi-finals of the League Cup. A win for PSG against Bordeaux will see them move provisionally six points clear at the top of Ligue 1 before second-placed Monaco go to Lorient on Saturday."
441,30/01/2014,02:30,Football: Cabaye ready to be thrown into PSG side,New signing Yohan Cabaye says he is prepared to be thrown straight into the Paris Saint-Germain side when the Ligue 1 leaders host Bordeaux at the Parc des Princes on Friday evening.,"The 28-year-old France midfielder completed his transfer from Newcastle United on Wednesday, penning a three-and-a-half-year deal in the capital for a fee which is reported to be worth 23 million euros (£19m, $31.4m) including bonuses. Cabaye, who made his name with Lille and played under PSG coach Laurent Blanc in the French national side, faces fierce competition for places in the Paris line-up, with Blaise Matuidi, Marco Verratti and Thiago Motta considered the first-choice trio in a 4-3-3 system. However, there could be an early opportunity for Cabaye to impress against Les Girondins with young Italian playmaker Verratti suspended and Adrien Rabiot, another option for Blanc, struggling with a knee problem. ""I am in a hurry to make my debut and represent ny new club. I feel fit and I hope to be in the squad and to participate,"" Cabaye said at his unveiling at the Parc des Princes on Wednesday evening. Cabaye also admitted that he had heard of the supposed scepticism about his signing from star players Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Thiago Silva, but there can be little doubt that PSG's rivals would love to be able to call on a player of his quality. The reigning champions sit three points clear at the top of the table and have a trip to second-placed Monaco to come next weekend. It is therefore crucial for them to get back to winning ways against Bordeaux after a 2-1 home defeat to Montpellier in the French Cup and a 1-1 draw at Guingamp in their last two outings. Blanc still has concerns surrounding the fitness of Ezequiel Lavezzi and captain Silva, while Bordeaux strike duo Cheick Diabate and Guillaume Hoarau are struggling for fitness just now, as is playmaker Ludovic Obraniak. Francis Gillot's side have already lost three times to PSG this season, but they did beat Saint-Etienne 2-0 last weekend and a surprise victory here could see them go fourth. ""There is no magic formula,"" said ex-PSG striker Hoarau when asked what was needed to beat the league leaders. ""You need a little bit of everything. We can't afford to let them play their game. People say they are not at their best just now - I'm not sure we can use that term but we need to hope that they perhaps don't play at 100 percent."" Monaco may be without the injured Radamel Falcao for the rest of the season but they didn't miss the Colombian in last weekend's 2-0 win against Marseille and will hope to make it eight victories in 10 league games when they visit Lorient on Saturday. Lorient themselves have lost just once in 10 in the league, though, and are usually a tough proposition on their artificial pitch in Brittany. Third-placed Lille go to Nice on Sunday looking to halt a sequence of four league games without a win in a match that could see talented right-back Sebastien Corchia make his debut following his move from Sochaux. ""I had other opportunities but I preferred to come to Lille because the coach (Rene Girard) phoned me personally. They are an ambitious club who will help me progress,"" said Corchia, who has in the past been linked with Bayern Munich and Juventus. Another club who have been busy in the January transfer window are Rennes, who could have new recruits Paul-Georges Ntep, Ola Toivonen and Kamil Grosicki in their side when they entertain Lyon on Sunday. Lyon, inspired by former Rennes playmaker Yoann Gourcuff, are aiming to extend a run of 12 matches without defeat in Brittany. Fourth-placed Saint-Etienne entertain Valenciennes on Saturday while Marseille, in fifth, are at home to Toulouse on Sunday. Fixtures (kick-offs 1900 GMT unless stated)"
442,28/01/2014,15:09,Football: Crisis club Marseille out to stop the rot,French giants Marseille will aim to stop the recent rot when they host struggling Valenciennes in a Ligue 1 match initially postponed earlier this month.,"Having sparred earlier in the season with top two Paris Saint-Germain and Monaco, Marseille have now slumped to ninth in the table following a dismal run of form that also saw them bundled out of both the French Cup and League Cup competitions over the last two weeks. They have only one win in their last six league matches and three defeats in a row in all competitions. What's more, their notoriously fiery fans turned viciously against them last week with one hardline ultra group blasting the players as ""sub-human"" in an internet posting that was later taken down. Not only are matters on the pitch and in the stands causing concern but rumours are rife that the dressing room is far from a harmonious place. Jose Anigo's team, the 1993 European champions, currently sit nine points off the Champions League qualifying positions, although they do have a game in hand. Their one saving grace on Wednesday is that they will be entertaining a team in dire straits having recently dropped into the relegation zone. With home matches against Toulouse and Bastia next up, a victory is a must if the nine-time champions are to start to turn their increasingly miserable season around. Even so, Anigo is far from confident, saying: ""Winning twice in a row at home is not easy, so three times!"" As for Valenciennes, their coach Ariel Jacobs is wary of a potential backlash from the angered home side. ""I don't like to speculate on the level of morale at our opponents,"" he said. ""Marseille are coming off three matches without a win, being eliminated from two cup competitions, will there be a revolt? ""We don't know. Do they have pressure and doubts? We don't know that either. ""We can't rely on that, we have to be ready physically and mentally; Marseille's quality will ensure this is a tough match."""
443,26/01/2014,16:55,Football: In-form Lyon win again,Lyon continued their superb recent form with a 3-0 win over struggling Evian on Sunday to close in on the European places in Ligue 1.,"Bafetimbi Gomis turned and fired in his eighth league goal of the campaign to put Remi Garde's side ahead on 19 minutes at the Stade de Gerland, before Evian had Ghanaian defender Jonathan Mensah sent off six minutes prior to the interval. OL found time to double their lead before the break as Alexandre Lacazette chipped over Bertrand Laquait and into the net. And Lacazette secured victory inside the final quarter of an hour as he finished after being set up by substitute Jimmy Briand at the end of a breakaway, taking his tally for the season to 12 goals in the process. Remi Garde's side have started 2014 with six successive wins in all competitions and are now unbeaten in 12 games since a 4-0 defeat away to Paris Saint-Germain at the beginning of December. That remains their only defeat in their last 18 outings and Sunday's victory saw them move provisionally up to fifth place in the table, three points adrift of Saint-Etienne before Les Verts face Bordeaux later on Sunday. Also on Sunday, Monaco begin life without injured top scorer Radamel Falcao when they play host to Marseille at the Stade Louis II. Claudio Ranieri's side can move to within three points of Ligue 1 leaders PSG, who needed a late Alex equaliser to earn a 1-1 draw away to Guingamp on Saturday."

The draw is enough for the defending champions to extend their lead at the top of the table to six points, although second-placed Monaco can trim the gap back to three with a win against Marseille on Sunday. PSG had endured a mixed week, thumping Nantes 5-0 to underline their superiority over the rest of Ligue 1 before being surprisingly eliminated from the French Cup by Montpellier. At the Stade du Roudourou, coach Laurent Blanc was without injured captain Thiago Silva, so Marquinhos lined up in the heart of the defence, while there was a first start in Ligue 1 since the beginning of December for Javier Pastore. And against opponents who had not won in six league games and had scored just three times since the start of November, PSG for once struggled to stamp their authority on proceedings. Zlatan Ibrahimovic had a shot from 40 yards turned around the post by Guy Roland Ndy Assembe with the visitors' best chance of the first half, but that came just two minutes before the interval. Guingamp were a greater threat at the other end, with the 21-year-old Rachid Alioui taking advantage of a rare start to volley just wide early on and then send in a long-range free-kick that moved in the air and was turned desperately onto the crossbar by PSG 'keeper Salvatore Sirigu. Edinson Cavani had an effort correctly ruled out for offside at the start of the second half, and the game looked set to peter out to a goalless draw on a difficult pitch. However, the home side had other ideas and took the lead in the 84th minute when striker Yatabare stole a yard on Marquinhos to head in from a right-wing corner. It was the Malian striker's sixth league goal of the campaign, and his first since early October, and it sparked wild scenes of celebration among the packed crowd inside a stadium which boasts a capacity greater than that of the small town of Guingamp itself. However, the giants from the capital were rescued soon after when Brazilian centre-back Alex got to a corner before Ndy Assembe to head home and restore parity. ""It is always difficult to win games. We came here to win even if we had a lot of respect for Guingamp,"" said Blanc. ""It is disappointing but I am still satisfied that we never gave up and came back to get a deserved point. ""We were not as good today. Why? I don't want to hide behind it but the state of the pitch was deplorable. It is the case for both sides but it handicaps the team that plays the most football. ""We knew it would be difficult and we have to get on with it. It maybe won't be the last time either, but we were not exactly helped."" Monaco will now look to close the gap without the services of top scorer Radamel Falcao, who underwent knee surgery on Saturday after suffering a serious injury in a French Cup win at Chasselay in midweek. Third-placed Lille could only manage a 1-1 draw at home to Rennes on Friday despite Salomon Kalou giving them the lead, and they have now gone four games without a win. Saint-Etienne can move to within a point of the podium with a win at Bordeaux on Sunday, while in-form Lyon are also in action on Sunday against Evian. Elsewhere on Saturday, the meeting between Toulouse and Bastia was called off because of the wet weather in south-western France."

The LFP in March 2013 issued Monaco with an ultimatum -- telling the Ligue 1 side to move their registered company across the border into France by June 2014 or risk getting kicked out of the French league. The dispute arose as French clubs felt Monaco received considerable financial advantages falling under the less onerous tax regime of the Principality. Friday's deal comes ahead of a scheduled Council of State hearing next week to rule on the affair. Confirming the settlement the LFP declared: ""Monaco have agreed to pay a voluntary...and one-off sum of 50 million euros to the LFP and have stopped their action before the Council of State."""

While their hopes of winning an unprecedented haul of four trophies went up in smoke, Blanc remained philosophical heading into Saturday's trip to Guingamp. ""It was a typical Cup match and sadly it was us that went out which is disappointing,"" said the former France and Bordeaux coach. ""If we can take something positive out of it, it's the fact that we have one competition less to worry about and our calendar will be less packed. ""Certain players needed game time and it showed (against Montpellier), but the Cup serves for that purpose too,"" he added. Monaco come into their Sunday evening tie at home to Marseille five points behind the capital club, but despite qualifying for the last 16 of the French Cup on Wednesday, they were counting the cost of a potentially season-ending knee ligament injury to star striker Radamel Falcao. The Colombian was stretched off just before half-time of the 3-0 win over fifth division Chasselay leaving his Italian coach Claudio Ranieri blaming the officials. ""If Falcao has something serious, it is the referee's fault,"" said Ranieri. Teammate Jeremy Toulalan also expressed his concern about the man who has found the back of the net nine times in league action this season. ""It doesn't look very, very good,"" expressed the playmaker as Falcao's World Cup hopes looked slim. Lyon are now the only French club maintaining a bid for four trophies after they sailed through their French Cup tie at amateur side Yzeure. Yoann Gourcuff's spectacular return to form has been the foundation for Remi Garde's men and they are also into the knockout phase of the Europa League as well as the League Cup semi-finals. While their chances of overhauling PSG remain far-fetched as they face a 19-point deficit, a win at home to Evian on Saturday could bring them within six points of the final Champions League spot. Third-placed Lille have staggered in recent weeks and hold just a three-point advantage on Saint-Etienne as they host Rennes in the weekend curtain raiser on Friday. Saint-Etienne meanwhile will look to compound Bordeaux's dismal exit in the French Cup after the holders were sensationally dumped out of the competition by amateur club L'Ile-Rousse in Corsica. The weekend's key relegation ties feature last-placed Ajaccio at home to Herve Renard's second-from-bottom Sochaux while Valenciennes are four points from safety as they host mid-table Lorient.

However, the visitors have improved recently under coach Rolland Courbis and took the lead 20 minutes in when Daniel Congre headed in a Siaka Tiene cross. Home coach Laurent Blanc left Zlatan Ibrahimovic on the bench at kick-off, although that allowed Edinson Cavani to play in his favoured central striking position and the Uruguayan converted a Lucas Digne centre to draw PSG level on the half-hour. There were chances at both ends after that but it was Montpellier who snatched a winner midway through the second half, Victor Hugo Montano heading in a corner to stun the home support. While Montpellier had their Colombian striker to thank for taking them through, an injury to his compatriot Radamel Falcao overshadowed Monaco's 3-0 victory at Chasselay earlier. Falcao crumbled to the ground following a challenge by Soner Ertek inside the Chasselay area -- for which no penalty was given -- just before the interval and needed lengthy treatment before being carried away on a stretcher. He had given the principality club the lead just before the half-hour mark, tapping into an empty net after Valere Germain had headed down a cross for his 11th goal in French football. Emmanuel Riviere replaced the former Atletico Madrid striker after half-time and went on to score two more goals in a game that was played at Lyon's Stade de Gerland. The injury to Falcao and the fall-out from it somewhat marred what should have been a special occasion for fourth-tier strugglers Chasselay and their star player, veteran former Monaco captain Ludovic Giuly. ""When you play against a team from a lower division, they are going to play really hard. That's normal, and that is what I tell my players before the match but it's not possible for a referee to blow his whistle for free-kicks without ever booking anyone,"" moaned Monaco coach Claudio Ranieri after the game. ""If Falcao has something serious, it is the referee's fault. ""Everyone wants to play like in England and let the game go. It's not possible here. The referee must see when there is a foul and blow his whistle."" Meanwhile, Monaco released a statement in which they said: ""The player Radamel Falcao was hit in the left knee. Must await further tests in the coming days to clarify the exact nature of the injury."" Ertek himself admitted to being upset at the potential implications of his challenge. ""I am gutted. I honestly don't think I touched him,"" he said. ""Did he hurt his own ankle? Did I touch him accidentally? I don't know but it ruined my match."" The injury to the 60 million-euro (£50.4m, $82.5m) striker also stole the headlines from tiny Corsican club L'Ile-Rousse, of the fifth division, who stunned the holders Bordeaux. In a game played in Ajaccio because their own ground was not deemed suitable for the tie, L'Ile-Rousse held out at 0-0 for 120 minutes before winning 4-3 in a penalty shoot-out. Toulouse were also knocked out, losing 2-1 at fourth-tier Moulins, but Lyon survived a scare in their tie away to fourth-tier club Yzeure, winning 3-1 after falling behind in the 75th minute. Yzeure, from central France, had eliminated Ligue 1 Lorient in the previous round but Jimmy Briand quickly brought the 2012 Cup winners level before a terrific Yoann Gourcuff strike put them in front and Steed Malbranque sealed the win late on. There was considerable drama on Tuesday too as Marseille lost 5-4 at home to south-coast rivals Nice while three other Ligue 1 sides -- AC Ajaccio, Sochaux and SC Bastia -- all lost to second-tier opponents. As a result, only seven Ligue 1 clubs will enter the draw for the last 16 of the competition."

Emmanuel Riviere replaced the former Atletico Madrid striker after half-time and went on to score two more goals in a game that was played at Lyon's Stade de Gerland. The injury to Falcao and the fall-out from it somewhat marred what should have been a special occasion for fourth-tier strugglers Chasselay and their star player, veteran former Monaco captain Ludovic Giuly. ""When you play against a team from a lower division, they are going to play really hard. That's normal, and that is what I tell my players before the match but it's not possible for a referee to blow his whistle for free-kicks without ever booking anyone,"" moaned Monaco coach Claudio Ranieri after the game. ""If Falcao has something serious, it is the referee's fault. ""Everyone wants to play like in England and let the game go. It's not possible here. The referee must see when there is a foul and blow his whistle."" Meanwhile, Monaco released a statement in which they said: ""The player Radamel Falcao was hit in the left knee. Must await further tests in the coming days to clarify the exact nature of the injury."" Ertek himself admitted to being upset at the potential implications of his challenge. ""I am gutted. I honestly don't think I touched him,"" he said. ""Did he hurt his own ankle? Did I touch him accidentally? I don't know but it ruined my match."" The injury to the 60 million-euro (£50.4m, $82.5m) striker also stole the headlines from tiny Corsican club L'Ile-Rousse, of the fifth division, who stunned the holders Bordeaux. In a game played in Ajaccio because their own ground was not deemed suitable for the meeting with one of France's biggest clubs, L'Ile-Rousse held out at 0-0 for 120 minutes before winning 4-3 in a penalty shoot-out. Lyon survived a scare in their tie away to fourth-tier club Yzeure, though, winning 3-1 after falling behind in the 75th minute. Yzeure, from central France, had eliminated Ligue 1 Lorient in the previous round but Jimmy Briand quickly brought the 2012 Cup winners level before a terrific Yoann Gourcuff strike put them in front. Steed Malbranque then sealed their win late on. Later on Wednesday, Ligue 1 leaders Paris Saint-Germain entertain Montpellier at the Parc des Princes. There was considerable drama on Tuesday as Marseille lost 5-4 at home to south-coast rivals Nice at the Stade Velodrome while three other Ligue 1 sides -- AC Ajaccio, Sochaux and SC Bastia -- all lost to second-tier opponents."
451,21/01/2014,02:25,Football: Monaco face former hero in David versus Goliath Cup tie,"The romance of the Cup is very much alive in France, where Monaco's trip to fourth-tier amateurs Chasselay in the last 32 on Wednesday will see them come up against one very familiar face.","The principality side, second in Ligue 1, will look to avoid an upset when they meet opponents who are battling to avoid relegation from the French Amateur Championship. Chasselay are struggling despite the presence in their side of one of the most decorated players in the recent history of French football. Now 37, Ludovic Giuly enjoyed two spells with Monaco, captaining them on their run to the 2004 Champions League final first time around and then returning for a season in the second division two years ago. In between, the little winger won the Champions League and two Spanish titles with Barcelona, had a spell with Roma and spent three years at Paris Saint-Germain, helping them beat Monaco in the 2010 French Cup final. After ending his top-level career last year, Giuly returned to his native Lyon and joined tiny Chasselay, his very first club who are coached by Stephane Santini, son of former France boss Jacques Santini. Together, they are plotting the downfall of Radamel Falcao's Monaco in a game that will be played at Lyon's Stade de Gerland rather than at their own modest home, the Stade Ludovic Giuly. ""This is like a jubilee for me. It couldn't be better. We will try to pull off a shock,"" said Giuly, and plenty of other minnows will try to do the same thing. Lille, who are third in Ligue 1, are preparing for a derby against fifth-tier minnows Croix, who hail from the suburbs of the northern French city. Meanwhile, in-form Lyon go to fourth division outfit Yzeure, who eliminated Ligue 1 Lorient in the last round, and the holders Bordeaux go to Corsica to face Ile-Rousse. There are also two all-Ligue 1 ties, with Marseille facing Nice in a south-coast derby that has added importance for both teams given that the French Cup is their only chance of winning a trophy this season. ""It is an objective for us because it's a trophy so we will do everything we can to win it,"" said OM coach Jose Anigo ahead of the match at the Stade Velodrome. The last two Ligue 1 champions also go head to head, with Paris Saint-Germain hosting Montpellier at the Parc des Princes, where the capital club have not lost since November 2012. Already five points clear at the top of Ligue 1 and through to the semi-finals of the League Cup, PSG are chasing an unprecedented domestic treble and few expect them to have any problems against a struggling Montpellier side, even if they have shown signs of improvement recently.

The match will now be staged at an unspecified later date, while there were also doubts surrounding the meeting of Nice and Ajaccio further along France's Mediterranean coast. On Friday, Saint-Etienne moved to within three points of the Champions League places by defeating third-placed Lille 2-0, Brandao and Franck Tabanou netting for Les Verts while Florent Balmont was sent off for Lille. Leaders Paris Saint-Germain and second-placed Monaco are both in action on Sunday, taking on Nantes and Toulouse respectively."

Lille have somehow managed to stay in touch with their financially stronger rivals, after former Montpellier title-winning coach Rene Girard fashioned a first half of the season that saw them lose just three times in 19 outings. The northern outfit, who last won the French title in 2011 under current Roma boss Rudi Garcia, come into the weekend four points off top spot as they await eighth-placed Reims in the final match on Sunday evening. Monaco coach Claudio Ranieri said earlier this week that he wants to slash his extensive squad during the transfer window but admits it is a luxury problem that most managers would love to have. ""I would like to reduce the squad because it is not easy to train with 24 or 25 players,"" said the much travelled Italian, whose former clubs include Inter Milan, Roma, Juventus, Valencia, Atletico Madrid, Chelsea and Napoli. ""It is not always easy to sell players but I am professional and the players are all professional, but to have so many players allows me to have more choice for my selection,"" he added. His Colombian striker Radamel Falcao finished the first half of the season with nine league goals, six behind PSG top scorer Zlatan Ibrahimovic, and his goal last weekend helped the Cote d'Azur club into the next round of the French Cup as they came back to defeat lower division Vannes 3-2. PSG were forced to spend several days in Brittany as they awaited the necessary conditions to play their twice-postponed cup tie against Brest before finally prevailing 5-2 on Wednesday. Ibrahimovic was once again their catalyst with a first-half hat-trick to sink the second division side. Laurent Blanc's side have lost just one match in all competitions this season, a league defeat at bogey side Evian. Saint-Etienne sit alone in fourth after defeating Evian 1-0 in a rescheduled midweek fixture as they overtook Bordeaux. They can keep their run of form going at Guingamp on Saturday, albeit with 90 minutes added football in their legs, after the Evian triumph. Bordeaux have closed in on the European places despite a dreadful start to the campaign, but a 13-point deficit to PSG may likely be a bridge too far as they get set to tackle Toulouse at home on Saturday. Marseille, Nantes and Reims are locked in a tie for sixth on 29 points and play Evian away, Lorient at home and Lille away respectively. Second from bottom Sochaux have been busy in the early days of the window as coach Herve Renard brought in two of his former Zambian African champions Stoppila Sunzu and Nathan Sinkala, as well as Marseille's Ghanaian striker Jordan Ayew on loan. Renard, who is in charge of his first Ligue 1 side, has his work cut out to erase the team's six point ladder to safety. They return to action with a testing trip to seven-time champions Lyon, while third from bottom Valenciennes are three points behind Montpellier heading into a key home tie against Bastia.

""It was a difficult match against a very good Nantes team,"" said Nice midfielder Eric Bautheac after their 2-0 win. ""We finished 2013 well and have started 2014 well which is good because it's the end of our bad run of results.

Falcao's compatriot James Rodriguez tied the match just before the break before Belgian midfielder Ferreira Carrasco avoided extra-time and a potentially embarrassing exit, with the winning goal for the Ligue 1 high-flyers four minutes from the conclusion of a spirited Cup tie. Monaco brought a squad assembled for a budget of 130 million euros to the west of France for a fixture against a Vannes outfit put together for just three million euros.

PSG concluded their winter training camp with a 1-0 defeat to Real Madrid in Doha on Thursday, but Blanc declared himself satisfied with his team's showing against the Spanish giants as they prepare for the second half of the campaign and their entry into the national knockout competition. ""We were as good as them, if not better, in many areas. The work we have done here has been very hard but very good,"" said Blanc of the Madrid clash. ""We have been very demanding with the players and they have responded well."" Blanc will start with a strong side against Brest, although Christophe Jallet has a back problem that may require surgery. The capital club, who have won the French Cup eight times, are not the only leading name faced with a tie against lower-league opposition in Brittany this weekend. Monaco, who sit second in the top flight, travel to third-tier strugglers Vannes with the focus on whether Colombian striker Radamel Falcao will start a game for the first time since November 24. The former Atletico Madrid man made his comeback after a thigh complaint as a substitute in the shock 2-1 home defeat to Valenciennes just before Christmas. Bordeaux travel to amateur outfit Raon l'Etape, a team they beat on penalties on the way to winning the competition last season, while elsewhere there are a number of ties between Ligue 1 sides.

459,01/01/2014,22:45,Football: Rivals worried by PSG threat - president,"Paris Saint-Germain president Nasser Al-Khelaifi insisted that rivals are ""worried"" about the threat posed by his club and launched a passionate defence of his home country Qatar in an interview with AFP on Wednesday.","Qatar-owned PSG are in the Gulf state on a winter training camp and will play Real Madrid in a glamour friendly in Doha on Thursday before returning to France to resume their domestic campaign. The French capital club have emerged as one of the most powerful names in football since being bought out by Qatar Sports Investments in 2011, and are now a genuine threat to the likes of Madrid, Barcelona and Bayern Munich on the European stage. They have been helped by the signing of a huge sponsorship deal with the Qatar Tourism Authority, which could net the club up to 200 million euros ($274m) a year. That deal raised eyebrows at a time when UEFA are trying to implement their Financial Fair Play rules, but Al-Khelaifi says PSG are doing nothing wrong. ""I don't understand. Are they worried about the competition itself or about the sponsors? Sometimes they are worried by PSG as a club,"" he told AFP. ""Maybe that's the reason. We respect every club, we don't enter into any other club's subjects or internal affairs. This is between us and UEFA. ""Of course it's a real contract, we had a meeting with the financial fair-play committee. We have been very transparent, we have answered every question. ""What I understand is that Qatar invest a lot in sport to promote the country. This is a big part of the investment of Qatar, investing in PSG. ""Because today everybody talks about PSG and Qatar. So I think this is something that gives a huge exposure. It helps tourism and that's what we explained (in relation to FFP)."" Al-Khelaifi, a former tennis player, also sought to defend Qatar against allegations that the country has abused the rights of workers involved in construction projects ahead of the 2022 World Cup, which it will host. ""As a Qatari, it hurt me of course,"" he said. ""Someone took very badly of my country. I know my country. The law is very strict. No one in our country from the government or the people would accept seeing foreign companies go against the law. ""Honestly, I think (criticism of Qatar) was unfair. I make mistakes myself...but it's not because I make mistakes that my country is bad."" Under Al-Khelaifi's presidency, PSG's outlay on players has been enormous, capped by the 60 million-euro ($82.5m) recruitment of Uruguayan striker Edinson Cavani last summer. The January transfer window is now open, and PSG have been linked with moves for several players this month, including Chelsea star Juan Mata, Juventus and France midfielder Paul Pogba and Yohan Cabaye of Newcastle United. However, Al-Khelaifi played down suggestions that the club will add to coach Laurent Blanc's squad this month. ""Today I don't think we need to recruit anyone. We have a strong team, very well organised. But you never know. The mercato (transfer window) is lasting one month, you can have injuries, lots of things can happen,"" he said. ""Of course the coach wants to buy players. If I was a coach I would like to buy everybody. He's very ambitious, he wants the team to be stronger. We'll see what will happen. ""It's a long-term project. We know what we want, our objectives. It's not just buying players. We need to build the new history of the club. The club has won the title three times and we need more trophies."" PSG have a Champions League last-16 tie with Bayer Leverkusen to look forward to and are also on course to retain the Ligue 1 title, sitting three points clear of Monaco at the top of the table halfway through the season. When Blanc was appointed in the summer to replace Real Madrid-bound Carlo Ancelotti, few thought he would remain at the Parc des Princes for the long term, but Al-Khelaifi said he is delighted with Blanc. ""We started something with Laurent Blanc and we're so satisfied with his job. I'm satisfied with the choice we made with him,"" said the 40-year-old."
460,19/12/2013,11:17,Football: Barthez close to joining PSG coaching staff,"Former France goalkeeper Fabien Barthez is in talks to join his 1998 World Cup winning teammate Laurent Blanc as part of the Paris Saint-Germain coaching staff, the Ligue 1 leaders have revealed.","Barthez who enjoyed an illustrious career as a player which included notable spells with Marseille, where he won the 1993 Champions League, as well as Monaco and Manchester United, appears close to striking a deal, according to PSG coach Blanc. ""We have spoken about it but I think you (the media) are confirming certain things that aren't yet in place,"" Blanc, who was also a teammate of Barthez at United, told football weekly France Football. ""It's hopefull. It would be the same role that he had with the France team when I arrived and for which I kept him. He was a consultant. ""I think his experience at the highest level can be beneficial to the goalkeepers at PSG,"" continued Blanc who left the France job following the team's quarter-final exit at Euro 2012 and was replaced by Didier Deschamps. ""Will it happen? I don't know anything. Fabien is interested but there is nothing definite for the moment."" Barthez has also been active away from the football pitch and has recently embarked on a successful career as a race car driver."
461,18/12/2013,11:47,Football: Monaco emerge as only threat to dominant PSG,"Paris Saint-Germain began what they hope will be an era of dominance in French football in 2013, a year that was also marked by the return of Monaco as a force and the national team's dramatic qualification for the World Cup.","Nineteen years after they were last crowned champions, PSG won their third title and their first trophy since the Qatari takeover at the Parc des Princes in 2011 under Italian coach Carlo Ancelotti. The capital club's strength compared to the rest of the country was frightening, epitomised by player of the year Zlatan Ibrahimovic. His goals helped the side reach the Champions League quarter-finals, where they bowed out on away goals to Barcelona, and his impact was such that the verb 'to zlatan' became commonly used slang in French. Glamour was added during the second half of last season by David Beckham's cameo at the Parc des Princes, the veteran Englishman finishing his glittering career with a Ligue 1 winner's medal. In a touch of class, Beckham promised to donate his salary to a local children's hospital, but PSG's success came at a big cost to owners Qatar Sports Investments, who spent huge sums building a formidable squad. As sports daily L'Equipe said: ""Never has a French league title come at such a price for the owner of a club"". And turmoil soon followed. Ancelotti left for Real Madrid, while sporting director Leonardo departed too after being banned from all official functions for 14 months for shoving a referee. Ancelotti was replaced by former France coach Laurent Blanc, who was considered to be little more than a stop-gap when appointed but who has succeeded in further improving the team. Few would bet against them winning a second successive title and making another big impression in the Champions League in the New Year. The year saw other grand old names enjoy success, with Bordeaux winning the French Cup and Saint-Etienne ending a 32-year trophy drought when they lifted the League Cup. But Monaco now appear to be the only realistic threat to PSG's dominance. Promoted back to Ligue 1 after a two-year absence, their billionaire Russian owner Dmitry Rybolovlev splashed the cash, including an outlay of 60 million euros ($82.4m) on Radamel Falcao from Atletico Madrid. That deal was briefly a French league record until PSG hit back with the 64 million-euro recruitment of Edinson Cavani from Napoli, and a two-way fight for supremacy was underway amid concerns that Ligue 1 was about to become as lopsided a contest as the Barcelona and Real Madrid-dominated Spanish league. Monaco's rivals have set about challenging their right to benefit from the favourable tax laws in the principality, that particular imbalance having been made all the more acute by the French government's introduction of a 75 percent tax rate on earnings over a million euros which almost led to a strike by angry clubs. But, as that row drags on, the French have good reason to be proud of their national team again. Didier Deschamps's side toiled for much of 2013, but their remarkable recovery from a 2-0 first-leg defeat to Ukraine in their World Cup qualifying play-off in November raised spirits. Les Bleus won the second leg 3-0 at the Stade de France to book their ticket to the 2014 finals. Now there is hope that a team featuring Ballon d'Or candidate Franck Ribery can make an impression in Brazil as they build towards Euro 2016, which France will host. By then, some of the exciting young stars who helped France win this year's under-20 World Cup in Turkey, including Paul Pogba, Lucas Digne and Florian Thauvin, should be key players in the full national team. No wonder French Football Federation president Noel Le Graet felt compelled to describe the end of 2013 as ""a new beginning"" for the sport in the country."
462,12/12/2013,19:51,Football: Falcao to miss trip to Guingamp - Ranieri,"Record-signing Radamel Falcao will miss Monaco's Ligue 1 trip to Guingamp on Saturday, coach Claudio Ranieri revealed on Thursday.","The Colombian hit-man has missed Monaco's last three matches, meaning he has not played since being substituted in the 1-0 win over Nantes on November 24. He is suffering from a hamstring niggle but rumours are rife in the French press that all is not well between player and coach, something both have denied. ""I'm very happy at Monaco,"" Falcao said in French at an improvised press conference at the club shop, where he was signing autographs. ""My wife is very happy to live here. There's no problem with the coach, no problem with the doctor and no problem with the team. ""I've just got a little problem with a (hamstring). But I'll soon be playing again."" Earlier, Ranieri had announced the 27-year-old's comeback was on hold again. ""He won't play against Guingamp. He and I hope he'll be present for the match against Valenciennes (on December 20),"" said Ranieri. Every week, though, the Italian has claimed Falcao is close to a return, only for him to be ruled out. After the 1-0 win at Ajaccio on Sunday, Ranieri had said he thought his 60-million-euro ($83m) signing would be fit on Saturday. But Monaco released a statement explaining that he was continuing ""treatment on the muscular discomfort (scarring of an old tear to the hamstring of the right thigh) which remains painful."" ""The improvement is progressive but will not allow participation in the next match,"" added the statement. Earlier that day, French sports daily L'Equipe claimed the case surrounding Falcao's injury was a ""mystery"" while adding that his absence from the pitch was ""unexplained"" and that the club were being ""silent"" about his injury. It continued, saying ""all (the elements) are there to create a problem around Radamel Falcao"". As well as Falcao himself, France international midfielder Jeremy Toulalan also rubbished the rumours. ""What's being said about him, I don't think it bothers us or worries us,"" said the 30-year-old. ""And we've shown that. I've been through it myself. The most annoying thing is for him. The most bothered is him. He'd like to be playing. But we're continuing to advance without him, even though surely it would better with him. ""As soon as there's a little thing you (the media) plunge into it. I don't have the impression that there's any problem. But even if I say that, you'll keep going. That's the game. For us, there's no problem. ""I've had injuries like that. You feel like you'll never get over it and you do everything to do so. ""The most important thing is that he comes back on top form because we're going to need him over the course of the season."""
463,08/12/2013,23:39,Football: Riviere strikes as Monaco go second in France,Emmanuel Riviere scored his eighth goal of the season to give Monaco a 1-0 win over 10-man Ajaccio on Sunday and cut the gap on Ligue 1 leaders Paris Saint-Germain to two points.,"Riviere struck in the 75th minute as Monaco replaced Lille, who had lost 1-0 at Bordeaux earlier in the day, in second spot. PSG stayed top on Saturday with a 5-0 demolition of rock-bottom Sochaux. ""The matches are always complicated and difficult,"" said Monaco coach Claudio Ranieri. ""Ajaccio played very deep but I saw that we had a desire to win. I am satisfied with three points."" With top scorer Radamel Falcao out of action with a thigh strain for a third successive match, Monaco's scoring onus once again fell on the shoulders of his Colombian compatriot James Rodriguez who had netted twice in his last two games. But it was Anthony Martial who had the first shot on target after 16 minutes with the teenager's fierce drive well-saved by Ajaccio's Mexican goalkeeper Francisco Ochoa. Ivory Coast striker Gadji Celi Carmen Junior had Ajaccio's first attempt on goal after 30 minutes, but Monaco goalkeeper Danijel Subasic saved well. Martial again came close early in the second half but a diving header went just wide. Ajaccio's task became even tougher just after the hour mark when Jean-Baptiste Pierazzi was red-carded for a foul on Rodriguez. Once Riviere had grabbed the deserved lead, Monaco twice came close to increasing their lead with Rodriguez and Portuguese international Joao Moutinho both denied by the woodwork from free-kicks. Nigerian goalkeeper Vincent Enyeama's run of not conceding a goal ended after 1,062 minutes on Sunday with an own goal by Lille team-mate Simon Kjaer in the clash with Bordeaux. The Danish defender deflected a harmless looking shot by Bordeaux's Landry N'Guemo which tantalisingly hit the post before entering the net in the 28th minute. It was the first time Enyeama had had to pick the ball out of his net since September 15 in the 2-0 defeat by Nice. It also proved to be the only goal of the game. Enyeama had been closing in on the overall Ligue 1 record of 1176 minutes held by Gaetan Huard for Bordeaux during the 1992-93 campaign. On Saturday, Zlatan Ibrahimovic scored twice and created two goals as PSG routed Sochaux. The big Swede took his league goals tally to 13 thanks to an all-round masterclass which helped PSG quickly recover from their midweek loss to Evian in what was their first defeat of the season.

464,08/12/2013,23:24,Football: Riviere strikes as Monaco go second in France,Emmanuel Riviere scored his eighth goal of the season to give Monaco a 1-0 win over 10-man Ajaccio on Sunday and cut the gap on Ligue 1 leaders Paris Saint-Germain to two points.,"Riviere struck in the 75th minute as Monaco replaced Lille, who had lost 1-0 at Bordeaux earlier in the day, in second spot. PSG stayed top on Saturday with a 5-0 demolition of rock-bottom Sochaux. With top scorer Radamel Falcao out of action with a thigh strain for a third successive match, Monaco's scoring onus once again fell on the shoulders of his Colombian compatriot James Rodriguez who had netted twice in his last two games. But it was Anthony Martial who had the first shot on target after 16 minutes with the teenager's fierce drive well-saved by Ajaccio's Mexican goalkeeper Francisco Ochoa. Ivory Coast striker Gadji Celi Carmen Junior had Ajaccio's first attempt on goal after 30 minutes, but Monaco goalkeeper Danijel Subasic saved well. Martial again came close early in the second half but a diving header went just wide. Ajaccio's task became even tougher just after the hour mark when Jean-Baptiste Pierazzi was red-carded for a foul on Rodriguez. Once Riviere had grabbed the deserved lead, Monaco twice came close to increasing their lead with Rodriguez and Portuguese international Joao Moutinho both denied by the woodwork from free-kicks. Nigerian goalkeeper Vincent Enyeama's run of not conceding a goal ended after 1,062 minutes on Sunday with an own goal by Lille team-mate Simon Kjaer in the clash with Bordeaux. The Danish defender deflected a harmless looking shot by Bordeaux's Landry N'Guemo which tantalisingly hit the post before entering the net in the 28th minute. It was the first time Enyeama had had to pick the ball out of his net since September 15 in the 2-0 defeat by Nice. It also proved to be the only goal of the game. Enyeama had been closing in on the overall Ligue 1 record of 1176 minutes held by Gaetan Huard for Bordeaux during the 1992-93 campaign. On Saturday, Zlatan Ibrahimovic scored twice and created two goals as PSG routed Sochaux. The big Swede took his league goals tally to 13 thanks to an all-round masterclass which helped PSG quickly recover from their midweek loss to Evian in what was their first defeat of the season. That setback ended PSG's 36-match undefeated run and it was Sochaux who were cast in the role of fall guys on Saturday.

465,07/12/2013,19:18,Football: Ibrahimovic steers PSG to five-goal triumph,Zlatan Ibrahimovic scored twice and created two goals as Paris Saint-Germain crushed hapless Sochaux 5-0 to go four points clear in Ligue 1 on Saturday.,"The big Swede took his league goals tally to 13 thanks to an all-round masterclass which helped PSG quickly recover from their midweek loss to Evian in what was their first defeat of the season. That setback ended PSG's 36-match undefeated run and it was rock-bottom Sochaux who were cast in the role of fall guys on Saturday. Ibrahimovic scored twice in the last five minutes after Thiago Silva, Ezequiel Lavezzi and Edinson Cavani, with his 11th of the season, had also hit the target. PSG were on top from the start at the Parc des Princes where Sochaux had lost on their last five visits, conceding 16 goals. Ibrahimovic had two early opportunities -- grazing the post in the eighth minute before smashing a free-kick into the wall, five minutes later. Their pressure told after 14 minutes with the big Swede once again involved. His pass to the far post allowed Silva to slot the ball right-footed past Pierrick Cros in the Sochaux goal. Ibrahimovic then freed Thiago Motta who was thwarted by the busy Cros. PSG continued to toy with the visitors with Marco Verratti, Cavani and Maxwell causing a string of problems. Cavani came closest to adding a second goal just on the stroke of half-time when his 20-metre drive was kept out by Cros. PSG were rewarded for their endeavour with a second goal in the opening minute of the second half. Lavezzi scored from a Motta pass although there was a hint of offside when the Argentine striker collected the ball. On the hour mark, Cavani made it 3-0 and again Ibrahimovic was involved. The Swede crossed for Cavani at the far post who controlled the ball before quickly hitting the target. Ibrahimovic deservedly grabbed the fourth in the 85th minute with a brutally-struck free-kick from 20 metres which fizzed past the despairing dive of Cros. Cavani then teed-up Ibrahimovic in the 89th minute for the fifth. Lille can close the gap on PSG to one point with a win at Bordeaux on Sunday while third-placed Monaco, who are five points off the lead, meet Ajaccio. Earlier Saturday, flagging Marseille sacked manager Elie Baup, the dismissal coming at the end of a week when the south coast club suffered two successive Ligue 1 defeats. The 1-0 loss to Nantes on Friday, which followed a similar reverse at Lille left Marseille in fifth and they now trail PSG by 13 points. ""Elie Baup has left after talks between the (club) president and the coach at the end of training on Saturday morning,"" said a Marseille spokesman. The Velodrome club's sporting director Jose Anigo, a former manager at the club himself, will assume temporary control up to the French league's winter break. ""He will be in the dug out against (Borussia) dortmund on Wednesday night."" The 58-year-old Baup was appointed at the start of the 2011-2012 season, replacing current France manager Didier Deschamps and guiding Marseille into second place behind PSG last season. In contrast to last term, this season has been marred by a run of poor performances in the league and the loss of all five matches in the Champions League. Baup is the second manager to leave his Ligue 1 job in 48 hours, after Montpellier split with Jean Fernandez on Thursday -- the latter was replaced by veteran Rolland Courbis on Saturday. Anigo's first match at the helm is against Borussia Dortmund in the sixth and final Champions League group game with only pride at stake on Wednesday."
466,05/12/2013,12:11,Football: PSG cling to top spot as rivals close in,"Following Paris Saint-Germain's shock defeat in midweek at Evian and a milestone week for Ligue 1 goalkeepers, the race in France is wide open with three games remaining until the winter break.","PSG coach Laurent Blanc suffered his first defeat in charge since replacing current Real Madrid handler Carlo Ancelotti, and it was the capital club's first defeat in 36 matches, one short of the team record. The unexpected setback has allowed Lille to close within one point and Monaco two, after both clubs picked up wins over Marseille and Nice respectively, heading into the weekend's action. It was also a notable week for veteran goalkeepers Mickael Landreau of Bastia and Lille's Vincent Enyeama. Landreau, who began his incredible career between the sticks for Nantes in 1996 at just 17, set a new mark for top flight appearances in midweek when he raised the bar to 603, one better than former Monaco custodian Jean-Luc Ettori who set the previous record between 1975 and 1992. Nigeria's African champion Enyeama was also very much the talk of the league when he extended his number of minutes without conceding a goal to 1035 with a match-winning performance against Marseille. He is now within 141 minutes of the Ligue 1 all-time record of 1176 minutes unbeaten, held by Gaetan Huard and set in 1993. ""In the dressing room, it was incredible, everyone congratulated me,"" confessed Enyeama following the 1-0 win and passing the mythical 1000 minute mark. ""Above all, I am just very proud to be here and be a part of this team,"" he added. Landreau equalled Lettori's mark last Sunday with a clean sheet during Bastia's 2-0 win over Evian before breaking the record against Corsican neighbours Ajaccio in a 1-1 draw on Wednesday. Ettori, 58, was diplomatic after losing his long standing record. ""It is not just an anecdote and created a buzz,"" he said in reference to his mark. ""Six hundred and three matches is not insignificant, it's huge in fact and I'm happy for Mickael,"" said Ettori. ""I played 750 matches for the same club (all competitions) and that is a record that is going to last, in fact I think it will never be broken,"" he added. At PSG, Blanc's men have a chance to bounce back with what appears to be a home banker against rock bottom Sochaux on Saturday while Monaco host equally struggling Ajaccio and Lille travel to in-form Bordeaux. Nantes have positioned themselves just one point behind fourth placed Marseille and the two teams meet in a Friday clash at the Velodrome, with Elie Baup's position as OM coach potentially on the line. League Cup holders Saint-Etienne, were beaten by Rennes in midweek, and await the buoyant Evian side after their best win of the season over PSG. Lorient and Rennes meet in Brittany, Reims and Nice will do battle in the Champagne-region and Valenciennes are at home to Guingamp on Saturday. Struggling 2012 champions Montpellier will have a caretaker coach for the trip to Toulouse in the remaining match after coach Jean Fernandez resigned on Thursday.

That goal came just seconds after Javier Pastore had missed a glorious chance to bring the defending champions level, and the result ends PSG's unbeaten record under Laurent Blanc. Indeed, the capital club's sequence of Ligue 1 matches without defeat ends at 26, one short of the club record set in their title-winning 1993-94 campaign. And their overall run without losing in all competitions ends at 36 matches, also one short of the club record. However, that sequence does not include a defeat to Evian on penalties in the quarter-finals of the French Cup last season, and now the club from the shadow of the Alps can claim to be PSG's bogey side. ""This win is marvellous for all our fans, the whole region. I have to congratulate my players,"" said Evian coach Pascal Dupraz, who nevertheless admitted his frustration that his side were unable to produce such performances on a regular basis. Blanc did not dwell long on the run coming to an end. ""We had our chances in the first-half and we can have regrets about the loss because we should have opened the scoring and that could have meant a different result,"" he said. Blanc's side are now just a single point clear of Lille at the top of the table, with the northern side having beaten Marseille 1-0 on Tuesday, with Nolan Roux scoring a stoppage-time winner as Nigerian goalkeeper Vincent Enyeama kept his 11th consecutive clean sheet. Meanwhile, Monaco are just one point futher behind in third after they won 3-0 away to Nice in a Cote d'Azur derby on Tuesday, achieved without Radamel Falcao, as the Colombian missed a second successive game due to injury. James Rodriguez, Emmanuel Riviere and Lucas Ocampos got the goals for Claudio Ranieri's men, as Nice fell to a sixth straight defeat. Elsewhere on Wednesday, veteran goalkeeper Mickael Landreau broke the record for the most appearances by any player in France's top flight as he started for Bastia in their Corsican derby draw with Ajaccio. French international Landreau played his 603rd Ligue 1 game, three days after equalling the previous record held by former Monaco 'keeper Jean-Luc Ettori, in a game played on neutral ground on the mainland at the Stade Parsemain, home of second-tier club Istres. But Landreau, formerly of Nantes, PSG and Lille, was unable to help Bastia beat their island rivals as the game ended in a 1-1 draw, a late Eduardo strike for Ajaccio cancelling out Florian Raspentino's early opener. ""It is fabulous to experience this and to be able to share it,"" said Landreau after the match. ""The game was played behind closed doors, but I prepare for every match in the same manner. ""I can feel what this represents, and it is massive."" Saint-Etienne missed the chance to reclaim fifth spot as they went down 3-1 away to Rennes in Brittany, with Argentine striker Silvio Romero scoring his first two goals in French football for the hosts. Bordeaux inflicted a first home defeat on Guingamp since the opening day of the season, winning 1-0 thanks to a solitary Julien Faubert strike, while Lorient increased the pressure on beleagured Montpellier coach Jean Fernandez with a 2-0 victory at the Stade de la Mosson. Maxime Barthelme put Lorient ahead before Cameroon international forward Vincent Aboubakar scored his ninth goal of the season from the penalty spot at the death after the home side had been reduced to nine men by the dismissals of Vitorino Hilton and Abdelhamid El-Kaoutari.

Monaco stayed third and moved to within two points of PSG when they beat ailing Nice 3-0 later on Tuesday with Emmanuel Riviere ending a scoring drought dating back nine games as he grabbed the second goal to help his side to their third successive win.

""What can I say! I am just enjoying the moment,"" Enyeama told Bein Sport. ""It's not just me, though, it is the whole group. We stay strong like a team. We have the spirit and the strength.

The former France striker shrugged off a defender and only had Enyeama to beat but the goalkeeper proved equal to the task blocking Gignac's shot and when the rebound fell to Valbuena his shot drifted wide. One double save in the second-half in particular stood out, Dimitri Payet's fierce strike being batted away by Enyeama but straight to Gignac out wide right in the area, but his curling effort was tipped away by the goalkeeper.

Marseille won for the third time in a row on Friday with a 2-0 success over 2012 champions Montpellier, currently struggling at the wrong end of the table. That ensured they remained within sight of the top three but should they lose to Lille at the Stade Pierre-Mauroy, they could find themselves distanced to eight points off the top three by the end of the midweek fixtures. With Lille on a 10-game unbeaten streak and Monaco looking to have got over their November blip and back to winning ways these last two weeks, Marseille know they cannot afford to come away empty-handed from the north. And they will be looking to in-form forward Florian Thauvin to continue his recent goalscoring run against his former employers. Thauvin had a difficult start to life on the south coast after his protracted summer move from Lille, and he is not expecting to be welcomed back with open arms. ""The match at Lille will be like any other. I'll get a tough reception but I'm going there to win and take three points,"" said the 20-year-old, who has scored four goals in his last four league matches. ""I'm delighted to be doing good things for the team. It was my objective to repay the confidence the club has shown in me. I think I'm doing that well now,"" he added. Lille coach Rene Girard is hoping his side can continue the impregnable form they've been showing in remaining unbeaten, both in terms of results and goals conceded, for their last 10 matches. ""Ten matches in a row without conceding a goal, that's a first in my career,"" said Girard. ""That shows the character of this team, the lads are committed, we can play them out of position -- they make sacrifices, they turn up."" Lille have had one less day to recover, though, having played on Saturday. ""The Marseille game is coming quickly and it'll be tough,"" added Girard. ""We'll try to recover well, we don't have much of a choice. ""We're not going to complain, it would only use up more energy."" Monaco, meanwhile, travel to the Allianz Riviera on Tuesday to face local rivals Nice. Italian coach Claudio Ranieri has said he is quietly optimistic that record forward signing Radamel Falcao will be fit to return having missed the 2-0 success over Rennes. Having gone three matches without a win, which saw them drop to third having spent most of the early part of the season at the top of the table, Monaco have now won two in a row. France midfielder Jeremy Toulalan believes they can continue in that vein right up to Christmas. ""Now we have a match on Tuesday against Nice, a derby,"" he said. ""We need to win again, the aim is to win all our remaining matches up to Christmas. ""We've just gone through a tricky patch, I hope that was just that. ""I always said we'd have one, afterwards you have to react but the hardest thing is to be consistent."" Champions and leaders Paris Saint-Germain will be looking for revenge when they travel to Evian on Wednesday. The minnows, better known for their bottled water, were the last side to beat the Parisians, on penalties in a French Cup quarter-final back in April. Their last league defeat, 26 Ligue 1 matches ago, was to Reims at the beginning of March. Fixtures (1800 GMT unless stated)"
474,01/12/2013,23:44,Football: Ibra scores twice as PSG outclass Lyon,Paris Saint-Germain underlined their superiority over the rest of the French top flight on Sunday as Zlatan Ibrahimovic netted twice in a 4-0 win against Lyon at the Parc des Princes.,"Ibrahimovic scored both of his goals from the penalty spot as he moved clear at the top of the Ligue 1 scorers chart, while South Americans Edinson Cavani and captain Thiago Silva also found the target to help PSG continue their unbeaten record in all competitions this season. They remain four points clear of Lille and five ahead of Monaco at the top of the standings after easing past a Lyon side who once dominated the French scene themselves but who are currently languishing in mid-table. But while Lyon coach Remi Garde accepted that his team are ""not competing in the same league as Paris"", opposite number Laurent Blanc insisted the scoreline was not necessarily a fair reflection on the game. ""The size of the scoreline could make you think it was easy from beginning to end, but Lyon made life difficult for us early on,"" he said. ""If we keep playing at 100 percent, I think it will be very difficult to beat PSG. But we need to avoid complacency and be at our very best every game."" The build-up to the match was overshadowed by the news that both team buses were stoned on the way to the stadium, while Lyon lost Bafetimbi Gomis to injury in the warm-up. In his absence, OL played with a three-man central defence and for much of the first half they succeeded in frustrating the hosts. They were also helped by referee Antony Gautier's decision not to award a penalty when Cavani went down under a challenge from Bakary Kone 16 minutes in. Alexandre Lacazette had been left to plough a lone furrow up front for Lyon and he had the visitors' best opportunity of the first half, creating space for himself inside the box and lashing a shot against the bar. But PSG got their noses in front nine minutes before the interval when Cavani met a corner from the left and headed in through the legs of Yoann Gourcuff, who was standing on the near post. Five minutes later, the Uruguayan was brought down again inside the box. This time, Lyon goalkeeper Remy Vercoutre was the culprit, and a penalty was awarded. Ibrahimovic sent Vercoutre the wrong way as he coolly chipped into the net, and Lyon's chances of getting back into the game appeared to be over by the interval. They conceded again on the hour mark, though, Brazil skipper Silva converting the loose ball following a corner for his first ever goal in Ligue 1. And there was more pain to come for the visitors as Ibrahimovic beat Vercoutre from the spot once again after being fouled by Samuel Umtiti, taking his tally to 20 goals in his last 13 games for club and country. PSG are now unbeaten in 26 Ligue 1 matches and maintain a safe distance from Lille, who won 1-0 at northern neighbours Valenciennes on Saturday as Nigerian goalkeeper Vincent Enyeama extended his remarkable run without conceding a goal to 945 minutes. Meanwhile, Monaco proved too strong for Rennes on Saturday despite being without the injured Radamel Falcao -- James Rodriguez and Anthony Martial scoring in a 2-0 triumph. Elsewhere on Sunday, Mickael Landreau equalled fellow goalkeeper Jean-Luc Ettori's record of 602 appearances in France's top flight as he kept a clean sheet for Bastia in a 2-0 win over Evian. The 34-year-old French international began his career at Nantes in 1996 and won the title with Les Canaris in 2001 before spells at Paris Saint-Germain and Lille, with whom he won the double in 2011. ""I have worked so hard to get to this point. I am enormously lucky,"" said Landreau after drawing level with Ettori, who spent his entire career at Monaco between 1975 and 1992 and picked up nine caps for France. Milos Krasic and Wahbi Khazri got the goals for Bastia, who are eighth, while Brazilian forward Jussie scored twice in Bordeaux's 4-0 win against hapless Ajaccio in Sunday's other game."

He has now drawn level with Ettori, who spent his entire career at Monaco between 1975 and 1992 and picked up nine caps for France, six of them at the 1982 World Cup where the side lost in the semi-finals against West Germany. Landreau, who has played 11 times for his country, remains part of the France set-up under Didier Deschamps and looks likely to appear at his second World Cup next year in Brazil following a role as a squad member in 2006 when Les Bleus lost in the final against Italy on penalties. On-loan Serbian winger Milos Krasic put the Coriscan side in front four minutes inside the second half before Tunisian international Wahbi Khazri sealed the result in stoppage time. Landreau, who was appointed captain for the match, helped Bastia move into the upper half of the table, while Evian remain fifth from bottom. Earlier on Sunday, Bordeaux rumbled to their biggest win of the season as they crushed relegation threatened Ajaccio 4-0 to move ninth in Ligue 1. Leaders Paris Saint-Germain host Lyon later on Sunday attempting to extend their one point cushion on Lille with Monaco third a further point back after both the chasing teams won Saturday against Valenciennes and Rennes respectively. At the Chaban-Delmas stadium, Brazilian Jussie was the catalyst for Bordeaux, scoring the opening and closing goals while Gregory Sertic and Nicolas Maurice-Belay were also on target. ""It's very pleasing to score a double, as much as the victory,"" said the 30-year-old Jussie, who joined Bordeaux in 2007 from Lens after beginning his career at Brazilian club Cruzeiro. ""We've been in a bit of a black period, even if we weren't losing much, but this relieves the pressure a bit,"" added the striker, who took on French nationality in 2011 and was part of the championship winning team under current PSG coach Laurent Blanc in 2009. ""When everyone does their bit, it's a lot easier and the team worked hard in the second half. We had a great desire to win and even if we wobbled a bit, we stayed calm and continued to get forward, and scored goals.""

477,01/12/2013,04:41,Football: Foreign investors changing European football landscape,"Asian tycoons, Russian oligarchs, Arab sheikhs, American businessmen - 10 years after Roman Abramovich's takeover of Chelsea, European clubs remain targets for wealthy foreign investors, and rarely for their love of the shirt.","From Chelsea to the recent buyout of Italian giants Inter Milan by Indonesian media mogul Erick Thohir, a long list of clubs on the continent have changed hands over the last decade. The trend is most striking in England's Premier League, where the environment is more welcoming to potential investors, with many clubs listed on the stock exchange. In total, 11 of the 20 clubs in England's cash-rich top flight are in foreign hands. But investors have also turned their attentions to other European leagues, notably France, where clubs are not weighed down by massive debts as is often the case in Spain and Italy and are not protected in the same way as in Germany, where the law prevents any private investor from owning more than 49 percent of a club's shares. As a result, Paris Saint-Germain were bought out by Qatar Sports Investments in 2011 and Russian billionaire Dimitry Rybolovlev took control of Monaco in December of the same year before going on to dramatically revive the fortunes of the principality club. ""The influx of money has an immediate impact on the market. The first thing these new owners do is pay huge sums for the best players. That causes inflation and sometimes a sporting imbalance with clubs who can no longer keep up,"" says Didier Primault, co-director of the Centre for the Law and Economics of Sport (CDES) in Limoges, France. The CDES have produced a report for the European Union as part of their efforts to regulate the football transfer system. In their report, the CDES have noted that the greatest inflation occurred following Abramovich's arrival at Chelsea in 2003, after Manchester City were bought by the Abu Dhabi United Group in 2008 and last summer, when PSG and their Ligue 1 rivals Monaco fought with each other to break the French transfer record while Spanish giants Real Madrid and Barcelona also splashed out. Fortunes have been used up to clear clubs' debts, with 200 million euros ($267m, £167m) of Thohir's initial investment in Inter going on reducing the Nerazzurri's arrears. But lavishing such sums on debt management and buying players is sometimes done without any regard for the economic logic of the state of the markets at that moment in time. The recent case of Monaco was a perfect example, with the principality club marking their promotion back to France's top tier by spending 167 million euros in the summer transfer window. Then there was the remarkable policy of another Russian billionaire, Suleiman Kerimov, who turned unfashionable Anzhi Makhachkala from the volatile region of Dagestan into a major player on the European stage by spending big to bring in a whole host of players in 2011, notably Cameroonian striker Samuel Eto'o, who was rumoured to be the world's highest-paid player when he signed from Inter. More recently, Malaysian Vincent Tan has steered Cardiff City into the English Premier League for the first time, but his methods - including changing the club's colours from blue to red and putting a family friend in charge of player recruitment - have not gone down well with supporters. ""There are different types of investors,"" says Frederic Bolotny, a consultant on the economics of sport. ""Some are looking for indirect benefits, as part of a political strategy, such as Qatar's ownership of PSG. Others are more irrational. ""Abramovich at Chelsea or Rybolovlev at Monaco are looking for respectability regardless of whether they can make money out of it. ""Not of all of these investors can be compared."" Indeed, cases in which foreign investors actively look to make money - such as the Glazers at Manchester United - are very rare. The gradual introduction of Financial Fair Play (FFP) rules by European football's governing body UEFA in a bid to stop clubs spending more money than they actually generate should - in theory - prevent more instances of such irrational spending as have become commonplace. ""I don't see how all this can go on once financial fair play is in full force,"" says Bolotny, who points a finger towards the ""golden contract, completely out of keeping with the market"" that PSG recently agreed with the official Qatar Tourism Authority and which will eventually net the French capital club 200 million euros. PSG will have to provide details of the agreement to UEFA before they consider the deal in relation to FFP. How UEFA go about curbing what seems to be a clear way of avoiding the FFP regulations remains to be seen, but if they do succeed in bringing the European game back to a healthier financial footing, will mega-rich foreign investors continue to show such an interest in the sport on the continent?"

It was a welcome boost for Elie Baup's team, who were beaten 2-0 by Arsenal in the Champions League on Tuesday, ahead of their trip to second-placed Lille this coming Tuesday. ""It's a historic match because it's Marseille's 1,000th victory in the league,"" said Baup. ""But most of all it was important to win the three points, that's three wins in a row now."" France under-20 star Thauvin was the catalyst for the victory, scoring for the fourth league match in a row. ""It's a source of pride to be playing and making a difference,"" said Thauvin. I'm delighted to be contributing to the team. We had a difficult October with the defeats (five out of five in all competitions). Now we're just winning. ""If we keep going like this we'll climb back up the table."" The former Lille player pounced on a mistake by the Montpellier defence to beat goalkeeper Geoffrey Jourdren from close range after 36 minutes. Despite a difficult start to life at Marseille, he was in fine form on Friday night and could even have opened the scoring earlier in the 22nd minute, only for Jourdren to come out and dive at his feet to snuff out the danger. It wasn't easy for the former European champions, though, as Victor Montano came within inches of sliding home an equaliser at the back post with the goal at his mercy in the 57th minute. Benjamin Mendy also had to charge back to stop Souleymane Camara shooting when one-on-one with goalkeeper Steve Mandanda. Montpellier coach Jean Fernandez said his team paid for a slow start. ""I'm frustrated with the first half because we didn't play well,"" he said. ""We lacked the technical accuracy needed to put Marseille under pressure. ""We played better in the second half and did everything we could to equalise. If I want to stay positive, I look at the second half."" Montpellier remain 16th in the table, just five points above the relegation zone. The killer second came in stoppage time as Khalifa secured Baup a victory in his 501st Ligue 1 match as a coach."

Champions PSG had won 3-0 at Reims on Saturday. In Sunday's late kick-off, substitute Mounir Obbadi's 70-minute strike kept Claudio Ranieri's Monaco in the chase as they came away with all three points from fellow newly-promoted side Nantes. Monaco's first win in four games puts them third in the table five points off the pace. Rene Girard's Lille extended their run to nine games without conceding a goal as Nigerian international goalkeeper Vincent Enyeama has kept his slate clean for 855 minutes of action. ""I don't know if we're going to be able to compete with PSG. For the moment Paris are four points ahead, you can't say that they've pulled ahead,"" said Girard. It was a largely unconvincing display from the northerners who struggled to create anything despite playing the final 34 minutes with a numerical advantage following Oscar Trejo's red card. ""The sending off totally changed the direction of the match,"" complained Toulouse coach Alain Casanova. ""When I see my player with three stitches it makes me think there surely must have been a foul beforehand. ""He was given his marching orders and I regret it because we were really causing them problems on the technical front. We found ourselves with ten with half an hour to go and they didn't have many chances."" Enyeama was required to save his side on three occasions from Ben Yedder, Issiaga Sylla and Adrien Regattin. But Souare found space at the back post from Florent Balmont's cross from the right to head home and snatch the three points. The Nigerian international goalkeeper admitted his side had luck on their side. ""I made great saves, are you sure?!"" he said. ""We were lucky because they had a player sent off while they had been playing very well up until that."" Meanwhile, Saint-Etienne got back to winning ways at Nice despite the absence of their fans. Around 250 visiting fans were evacuated from Nice's Allianz Riviera stadium after coming under fire from sections of the home support, who tore up seats and threw them at their rival supporters. The visitors however let their football do the talking with Mevlüt Erding scoring his first goal for Saint-Etienne after 23 minutes, lifting his side to sixth. It was a fourth straight defeat for Nice, who were hit by a string of injuries, with an error from third goalkeeper Luca Veronese, 22, accounting for the goal. On Saturday, PSG kept their unbeaten start to the season intact with a dominant 3-0 win at Reims. Lucas Moura and Jeremy Menez shared goals either side of half-time and Zlatan Ibrahimovic added a late insurance marker as Laurent Blanc's men rumbled to their 10th victory in 14 outings. Lyon were held 1-1 at home by relegation threatened Valenciennes, while Lorient picked up a rare away win by thrashing French Cup finalists Evian 4-0. The three other Saturday matches between Montpellier and Guingamp, Rennes at home to Bordeaux and Sochaux entertaining Bastia all finished 1-1.

Baup, who has seen his struggling outfit eliminated from Champions League action with two games to play in the group phase, received a welcome tonic following the international break as the Velodrome giants moved one point above Nantes. It was a tetchy encounter that featured five yellow cards, but only one against the 1993 European champions. ""There were some very interesting things, 17 shots, goals. We tried to keep the ball moving quickly and using width to go forward,"" said Baup. ""It was good to score three goals away from home against an Ajaccio team who really dug in,"" he continued. ""We saw our players (France) qualify for the World Cup and it has given everyone a boost of enthusiasm. We had a very bad run of results and now we're on a bit of a good run again, and there's still five matches until the winter break. ""We need to try and take maximum points,"" concluded Baup.

They have a score to settle with Hubert Fournier's side after losing 1-0 at the Stade Auguste-Delaune last season, although remarkably they have not lost in the league since that match on March 2, a run of 24 games. Indeed, the capital club have not lost any of their 18 matches in all competitions this season, but Saturday's opponents are in formidable form themselves. Reims have lost just once in 13 matches, a run that has seen them beat Lille, Lyon and Marseille, and draw with Monaco, while they also knocked the principality club out of the League Cup. They come into the weekend in sixth position and Fournier is hoping his side can spring another surprise. ""We need to make sure we have no regrets at the end of the game,"" he said. ""If a little window opens, we need to enter it. We must believe we can cause an upset."" Their chances of doing so may be helped by the fact PSG's preparations have been hindered by the late return from international duty of numerous players. Record signing Edinson Cavani was not due to return to France until Friday morning after helping Uruguay qualify for the World Cup in a play-off against Jordan and coach Laurent Blanc admitted that he is likely to be rested. While some members of his squad -- including Blaise Matuidi, who helped France beat Ukraine in remarkable fashion in their decisive World Cup play-off -- will be on a high, others had a less enjoyable experience playing for their countries. That was the case for Zlatan Ibrahimovic, whose Sweden side missed out on a place in Brazil after losing to Portugal. ""I would have been happier had Zlatan qualified for the World Cup with Sweden, (but) now we need to try to fulfil our objectives at club level, and I know that Zlatan's personal aims are high. That will help ease his disappointment,"" Blanc said. ""You can expect changes to the team,"" he added. ""(But) those who have stayed here during the international break do not necessarily have a greater chance of playing the next game."" Conditions are likely to be tricky, with temperatures in France having plummeted in recent days, and Blanc is not taking anything for granted. ""They will be especially motivated and we expect a difficult game. We have not been able to prepare in the best possible manner. ""I am afraid of them, just as I am afraid of any team. Another thing that concerns me at the moment is the weather because pitches are not going to be in great condition. Our philosophy is based on playing football, and to do that we need a good pitch."" Elsewhere, second-placed Lille entertain Toulouse on Sunday looking to extend a run of eight games without losing or even conceding a goal, while Nantes, in fourth, face third-placed Monaco. Two of France's most famous clubs, both were promoted back to Ligue 1 in the summer, but while big-spending Monaco were expected to compete near the top of the table, Nantes have surprised observers with their impressive form. Les Canaris have lost just once in seven outings and a win will see them leapfrog Monaco on goal difference, with Claudio Ranieri's men having won just one of their last four.

With a lack of concentration in the Rennes defence Ayew struck right-footed from near the penalty spot for the Ghana striker's first goal in 10 months of Ligue 1 action. In the 73rd minute Rennes were awarded a penalty after Kassim Abdallah fouled Foued Kadir. Oliveira stepped up to take the spot kick but his effort was denied by Marseille keeper Mandanda, much to the delight of the travelling fans. This stalemate, after three losses in the league and two in the Champions league, lifted Marseille up to fifth, on 18 points. Rennes are one point behind in eighth. Marseille manager Elie Baup suggested the draw signified that his team had ""character"". But he warned: ""There's still lots of work to do...but this will do us good."" Asked if he was concerned after conceding an early goal he remarked: ""Rennes always start at 2,000 kilometres an hour, we knew that, and had to hold on. We did well to come back at them. ""Now we've stopped the bleeding, we've got to continue with the cure."" Later, Lyon ended their five-match winless run with a 2-0 home victory over Guingamp, Reims ran out 4-2 winners over Bastia, Valenciennes came away from their trip to Ajaccio as 3-1 victors, Evian/Thonon saw off Toulouse 2-1 and Sochaux and Saint Etienne ended 0-0. The Ligue 1 summit is occupied by defending champions Paris Saint Germain, who moved three points clear of Monaco with a 4-0 rout of Lorient on Friday. The result at a rain-drenched Parc des Princes extended PSG's unbeaten league run to 23 games. The goals came from Lucas, Jeremy Menez and an Edinson Cavani double. ""We scored goals, created lots of chances and kept the ball despite the difficult weather conditions,"" said manager Laurent Blanc. ""Our philosophy for the game is the same whatever team we put out. There are players who have little playing time but they always demonstrate their qualities."" Monaco have the chance to draw level with PSG on Sunday with a win at Lille. Later Saturday, Ajaccio sacked Fabrizio Ravanelli as coach after the 3-1 home defeat to Valenciennes left them second from bottom of the table. ""We have decided to call a halt to our collaboration with Fabrizio Ravanelli,"" said Ajaccio president Alain Orsoni. ""It wasn't an easy decision."" Ravanelli is the third Ligue 1 coach to be sacked this season after Eric Hely at Sochaux and Daniel Sanchez at Valenciennes."

The performance was a perfect riposte to Blanc's eve-of-match warning about the danger of complacency seeping into his swashbuckling team and their laboured 2-2 draw with Saint Etienne last time out. The former France boss needn't have worried as this Friday night run out against struggling Lorient left PSG only six games shy of the club record of 37 games without losing. ""This is a very good result. The satisfaction is at all levels, individually and collectively,"" said Blanc. ""We scored goals, created lots of chances and kept the ball despite the difficult weather conditions. ""Our philosophy for the game is the same whatever team we put out. There are players who have little playing time but they always demonstrate their qualities."" Blanc retained his preferred 4-3-3 system with Cavani filling in the role of Swedish star striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic, missing with an injured knee. PSG raced into a three minute lead when Brazil midfielder Lucas, unattended by the far post, volleyed the ball past Lorient keeper Fabien Audard in a move begun by Lucas Digne. Menez doubled their advantage five minutes before the interval, outfoxing Baptiste Reynet, who had come on to replace the injured Audard between the Lorient posts. The Ligue 1 champions were running riot in the rain and Cavani's header made it three after stoic work by Lucas to tighten their grip on the game before they headed off to the dressing rooms. Lorient never looked capable of fighting their way back and the final word fittingly went to PSG when Cavani fired in a rebound after a late corner taken by Menez to cap a good night's work in the French capital. That was the Uruguayan's ninth of the season and he now heads the Ligue 1 scoring charts. While Lorient were left hovering just three points above the relegation zone for PSG this win will act as an ideal springboard to next week's Champions League date with Anderlecht. Monaco, who had sat second on goal difference before Friday's action in the French capital, can reduce the gap when they face third-placed Lille on Sunday."

There will be a first lockdown in the professional game since 1972, scheduled for the last weekend of November, after a unanimous vote against Socialist President Francois Hollande's controversial supertax initiative. According to Ligue 1 teams, the new law, if implemented next year, would leave them with a 44 million euro tax bill and keep foreign talent away. On the pitch, Swedish star Zlatan Ibrahimovic hit a majestic four goals during PSG's 5-0 humiliation of Belgian side Anderlecht in midweek.

498,18/10/2013,02:35,Football: PSG sweating on Ibra fitness ahead of Bastia,Champions Paris Saint-Germain are sweating on the fitness of star striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic ahead of the visit of Bastia on Saturday.,"PSG trail big-spending rivals Monaco on goal difference at the top of a Ligue 1 table increasingly developing into a two-horse race, already at this early stage of the season. Those two remain the only unbeaten sides after nine games and have both returned from the Velodrome cauldron with maximum points from a trip to their only potential challengers, Marseille. But the news is not good for PSG as Ibrahimovic was injured when playing for Sweden last Friday. He started training on his own on Thursday but the thigh problem could yet see him miss Saturday's match. It would be a further blow for the Parisians, who will already be without suspended midfield pair Thiago Motta, who was sent-off against Marseille, and Marco Verratti, whose booking against the same team led to his ban. Brazilian centre-back Marquinhos insists, though, that the champions have the squad to make light of any absences. ""They (Motta and Verratti) are two very important players for us but we have a big squad with quality players to replace them and in whom we have every bit of faith,"" he said. While they may be missing certain players, PSG can count on a rapidly improving Marquinhos, who said he was fatigued when he first arrived at the club from Roma at the start of the season. ""It was very difficult for me. I was out of condition when I arrived,"" he said. ""Physically (I'm now at 100 percent), yes, and mentally. But I still think I can improve a lot. I'm keeping my feet on the ground and continuing to improve."" Marquinhos, who cost 30 million euros ($41 million) from Roma even though he is still only 19, has one eye on earning a World Cup berth with his country. ""Why not? I have to dream and believe in myself. To play in the World Cup in my home country would be a dream,"" he added. Bastia are also likely to be without a crucial player in former PSG goalkeeper Mickael Landreau, who is suffering from a hamstring problem. Landreau is closing in on the record number of Ligue 1 appearances held by former Monaco goalkeeper Jean-Luc Ettori. He has 596 compared to Ettori's 602 and is set to break the record at the beginning of December should he play every one of Bastia's matches until then. Such matters won't concern PSG, though, who are simply looking for three points to ensure Monaco, who travel to second-from-bottom Sochaux on Sunday, do not get away from them. Monaco look set to recall France midfielder Jeremy Toulalan, who has been out since the beginning of September with a groin strain. ""I've been through a physical training programme and I'm better now, I'm ready to play,"" he said. In other matches, Marseille were looking to bounce back to form following their home defeat to PSG in the Cote d'Azur derby away to Nice in Friday night's early game. Marseille coach Elie Baup was expecting to have striker Andre-Pierre Gignac fit again after a toe injury, although winger Dimitri Payet was suspended. Nice's greatest worry was over the state of their pitch at the Allianz Riviera following the French Top 14 rugby match between Toulon and Clermont played there on October 5.

The mega-rich title-holders from the capital will be guaranteed their usual warm welcome in the Mediterranean port city, home to arguably the most passionate fans anywhere in France. As it stands PSG trail Ligue 1 leaders Monaco on goal difference while Marseille are a point further back in third. There is plenty of incentive, then, for Elie Baup's side to continue their impressive record at home to PSG down the years. OM have lost just one of their last nine home meetings with the club from the capital, with that 4-2 reverse coming in October 2008. However, Marseille's recent record has been rather patchy, with just two wins from seven games since the beginning of last month, and they come into the clash off the back of a chastening 3-0 defeat away to Borussia Dortmund in the Champions League on Tuesday. ""We know the importance of the game,"" said Baup. ""We need to put the Champions League to one side and start focusing on our domestic league once again. ""We have been on a good run, like Paris, so I don't think the defeat (in Dortmund) will leave any traces."" PSG are unbeaten in 11 matches in all competitions this season and have not lost in 19 games in Ligue 1 since a 1-0 loss at Reims on March 2. It is their longest unbeaten sequence since a record 27-game stretch during their title-winning 1993-94 campaign and their display in beating Benfica 3-0 in the Champions League on Wednesday would have made for ominous viewing for anyone with Marseille connections. ""We are eager for the Marseille game to come around but we need some time to savour this win first,"" said PSG coach, former OM defender, Blanc after the performance against Benfica. ""Marseille will be the last game of a long series (of seven games in 23 days) and we play football to be involved in matches like this,"" added PSG goalkeeper Salvatore Sirigu. One man who will not play in the game is captain Thiago Silva, who is still sidelined with a thigh injury, while Marseille are hoping striker Andre-Pierre Gignac -- scorer of a brace in a 2-2 draw between the clubs at the Velodrome last season -- can return after a toe problem. Meanwhile, Monaco, who have already taken four points from trips to Marseille and Paris this season, will be hoping to extend their unbeaten start when they entertain Saint-Etienne in the principality on Saturday afternoon. ""Saint-Etienne are a direct rival for us. I think they will be competing at the top of the table right to the end of the season,"" said Monaco coach Claudio Ranieri, who has doubts over left-back Layvin Kurzawa and former Saint-Etienne striker Emmanuel Riviere and will be without Jeremy Toulalan for the game. That could open the door to a starting berth for Colombian winger James Rodriguez, who has struggled to make an impact since his 45 million-euro ($61m) summer move from Porto. ""For James Rodriguez, it is a problem of mentality,"" explained Ranieri. ""He thinks like a forward but must also defend."" The three sides tipped to fight it out at the top of the table before the season began have already opened up a gap on the rest, but Lille have lost just once in six games to climb up to fourth before hosting Fabrizio Ravanelli's Ajaccio. Lyon have won just one of their last six games before travelling to Montpellier, who are traditionally strong at home, on Sunday. Fixtures (kick-offs 1800 GMT unless stated)"

Up until Sunday, Colombian Radamel Falcao and Frenchman Emmanuelle Riviere had scored all of Monaco's goals in the league. Reims almost snatched a shock winner in the 86th minute but Togo international Floyd Ayite was denied by Monaco's Croatian 'keeper Danijel Subasic despite being clear on goal. In a feisty finale, Reims had Atlia Turan sent off for a second bookable offence with two minutes left, but Monaco were unable to capitalise. Claudio Ranieri's men however, have seen their two-point cushion at the top slashed to goal difference over Paris Saint-Germain who defeated Toulouse 2-0 on Saturday, as both clubs ended the weekend's action with identical records of five victories and three draws. ""We gave up a stupid goal early in the match and it's the second time we've started badly,"" explained Monaco captain Eric Abidal. ""It was important to be collective and efficient and we didn't do that. Reims played well and tryed to catch us on the counter but we just weren't clinical in front of goal. ""Even when they were down to ten men, they still created chances."" Marseille are in third on 17 points with Lille and Nice in fourth and fifth respectively, just ahead of Nantes and Saint-Etienne. Promoted Nantes continued their fine start to the campaign earlier on Sunday with a display reminiscent of the style that made them eight-time champions as they defeated Rennes 3-1. The afternoon kick-off at Rennes's Stade de la Route de l'Orient produced a feisty derby that was eventually taken over by the 'Canaries' thanks to strikes from Filip Djordjevic, Serge Gakpe and an injury time clincher from Lucas Deaux. ""We had a very good first half and produced good play and created good chances,"" said their 50-year-old Armenian-Franco coach Michel Der Zakarian. ""We should have been 3-0 up at half-time because we should have had a clear penalty and after we had a black spell at the start of the second half."" His slick passing formation outwitted their hosts in midfield and which led to Djordjevic's headed opener after just 17 minutes. In front of a crowd of some 25,000, Rennes, who suffered only their second league defeat, pushed forward in search of an equaliser only to slip further behind with a brilliant Nantes second on the stroke of half-time. Togo international Gakpe, cut into the box before turning two defenders inside out and then hooking a low shot around Rennes 'keeper Benoit Costil and into the far corner. Nelson Oliveira then broke through for Rennes on 55 minutes after the ball pin-balled into his path and he made no mistake with his one-on-one duel against Nantes number one Remy Riou to pull it back to 2-1. Der Zakarian's men then had to endure a nerve shredding finale before Lucas Deaux finished off a counter-attack deep into injury time to make the scoreline 3-1. Fabrizio Ravanelli's Ajaccio side followed their first win of the season against Lyon in midweek with a hard earned 1-1 draw at home to 2012 champions Montpellier. The Corsican side went behind when Ajaccio-born midfielder Remy Cabella converted a ninth minute penalty before grabbing a share of the points with Ronald Zubar's header 10 minutes before the break."

Radamel Falcao scored twice at the Stade Louis II on Wednesday to take his season's tally to a league-best seven goals, as Monaco extended their best start to a Ligue 1 campaign. ""As a striker of course I'm always happy when I score and that was again the case in the victory against Bastia,"" said Falcao. ""For us it was important to win, thanks to the victory, we stay top,"" added the Colombian. Ranieri, though, said it was premature to cast Monaco, who only returned to the top flight this season after a two-year absence, as genuine title challengers despite their strong start. ""I think it's too early to say we've sent out a signal (to the other teams) but we continue to reaffirm our good start to the season. ""With the results we play with confidence and calmness,"" said Ranieri, who dismissed the significance of being first in the table so early in the campaign. ""The standings? The important thing is the way in which the team moves forward,"" explained the Italian. On Sunday Monaco travel to mid-table Reims who have lost just once in seven outings and conceded only one goal since mid-August. Second-placed PSG, who are in the middle of a run of five fixtures in 15 days, return to the capital on Saturday to host Toulouse. Alain Casanova's men were languishing in the bottom three a fortnight ago but back-to-back victories have catapulted Toulouse up to 11th. Meanwhile, PSG put the disappointment of Sunday's 1-1 draw with Monaco behind them as Edinson Cavani struck the decisive goal in a 1-0 win away to Valenciennes. ""We got the main thing, the three points, because there was a lot of fatigue (on Wednesday). We had a difficult match but it won't be the first, nor the last this season,"" said PSG midfielder Blaise Matuidi. ""We had to recover the two points dropped at home to Monaco, and we did that. Now we have to continue our march forward,"" added the France international. The fixture marks a return to the Parc des Princes for Clement Chantome, who left Paris in the summer to join Toulouse on loan. Despite strong ties to PSG, who are unbeaten so far this term and have not lost any of their last 18 Ligue 1 games, a confident Chantome insisted Toulouse were capable of causing a surprise this weekend. ""We should go there to play the game. PSG are a beatable team when they doubt (themselves),"" said Chantome. Marseille, who are a point behind PSG in third, visit Lorient in Saturday's early game seeking to build on Tuesday's 2-1 win over Saint-Etienne. Joint-leading scorer Andre-Pierre Gignac could return for Marseille after the burly forward was back in training on Thursday following a toe problem, while Jeremie Aliadiere may be welcomed back into the Lorient line-up after a six-week injury lay-off. Elsewhere, Lyon will seek to bounce back from a defeat to lowly Ajaccio when they host Lille, while Saint-Etienne are at home to Bastia and Rennes entertain Nantes in a local derby. Valenciennes go to Sochaux, who are without a coach following the resignation of Eric Hely, in a bottom of the table clash. Fixtures (kick-off 1800GMT unless stated)"

505,25/09/2013,23:18,"Football: Monaco stroll past Bastia, narrow win for PSG","Ligue 1 leaders Monaco extended their best start to a Ligue 1 campaign with a 3-0 victory at home to Bastia on Wednesday, while Paris Saint-Germain kept pace with a 1-0 win at Valenciennes.","Emmanuel Riviere opened the scoring for the hosts before league-leading scorer Radamel Falcao netted twice to maintain Monaco's unbeaten record and return Claudio Ranieri's side to the top of the table after PSG had temporarily gone first. A fifth win in seven games for the principality outfit moved them onto 17 points, two ahead of defending champions PSG, with Marseille one point further back. Both goalkeepers were tested early at the Stade Louis II with Wahbi Khazri drawing a pair of saves from Monaco custodian Danijel Subasic, while Bastia's Mickael Landreau had to be at his best to keep out Riviere and Layvin Kurzawa. However, Landreau's resistance was broken on 39 minutes as James Rodriguez played in Riviere who held off Francois-Joseph Modesto before steering a shot just inside the near post for his sixth goal of the season. Falcao then scored for the fourth straight game two minutes later as he ran onto Joao Moutinho's through ball before firing past Landreau. The Colombian added his second of the evening a minute from the end, taking his tally to a Ligue 1 best seven goals, as he pounced on Yannick Ferreira Carrasco's blocked effort to steer beyond a helpless Landreau. Earlier, PSG's record signing Edinson Cavani netted the only goal at the Stade du Hainaut in first-half stoppage time as Laurent Blanc's side won 1-0 away to struggling Valenciennes. ""We burned a lot of energy in the Monaco match and only had three days to recover. It was a difficult match in all senses,"" said PSG coach Blanc. ""But the important thing is to have taken the three points because we'll have plenty of matches like that over the course of the season."" Javier Pastore twice went close in the opening stages but both 'keepers were relatively untroubled in a quiet first 45 minutes before Cavani struck two minutes into first-half stoppage. Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who on Tuesday signed a contract extension tying him to the club until 2016, carried the ball from well inside his own half before picking out the angled run of Cavani, who shot low first time across Nicolas Penneteau into the far corner. The hosts responded after the break with Marco Verratti forced to clear off the line from a Lindsay Rose header. Anthony Le Tallec then had Salvatore Sirigu scrambling across his line as his free-kick whistled just wide of the post. The former Liverpool striker, though, missed an excellent chance to haul the home side level late on as Mathieu Dossevi's effort was deflected into his path but Le Tallec failed to make any contact from six yards out as PSG held on for a narrow win. Defeat for Valenciennes extended the northerners' losing streak to six, leaving them second from bottom on just three points. Elsewhere, goals from Salim Arrache and Aboubacar Demba Camara gave Fabrizio Ravanelli's Ajaccio their first victory of the season as they recorded a 2-1 win at home to Lyon. Martin Braithwaite's 72nd-minute winner handed Toulouse a 1-0 win over Lorient, while promoted Guingamp routed basement club Sochaux 5-1, Nantes beat Nice 2-0 and Bordeaux drew 0-0 with Reims."
506,24/09/2013,23:14,Football: Marseille get back to winning ways,Marseille put their recent patchy form behind them to beat Saint-Etienne 2-1 at the Stade Velodrome in Ligue 1 on Tuesday evening.,"After a fine start to the season, OM had gone four matches without a win in all competitions before hosting Les Verts. However, Saint-Etienne had not won in Marseille since August 1979, when Michel Platini was among the scorers, and their miserable record in the fixture was extended as they failed to fully recover from the concession of two first-half goals. Elie Baup's side came flying out of the blocks and opened the scoring in the 22nd minute when Benjamin Mendy connected first-time with a Mathieu Valbuena cross from the right, his shot bouncing over the stranded Stephane Ruffier and into the net. The young full-back's first Ligue 1 goal was followed by a first top-flight goal for midfielder Giannelli Imbula four minutes later. Imbula slotted low past Ruffier from a Rod Fanni cross at the end of a fine Marseille move, to leave Saint-Etienne facing a second straight defeat already. The visitors were handed a lifeline just after the half-hour mark when Alaixys Romao was harshly adjudged to have handled a Yohan Mollo cross right on the edge of the area and Faouzi Ghoulam stepped up to slot the penalty past Steve Mandanda in goal. However, they could not find an equaliser, and might have lost by more goals, with Ruffier notably saving twice from Valbuena before the interval. ""After they came back to 2-1 we found things a bit more complicated,"" admitted Baup, speaking to Canal Plus television after the game. ""But we have played well since the start of season, even in losing to Monaco and Arsenal, and we were rewarded tonight."" The win takes Marseille above Saint-Etienne and provisionally into second place in the table, behind leaders Monaco on goal difference before the unbeaten principality club play host to Bastia on Wednesday. Earlier on Tuesday, Lille followed up their weekend 2-0 win at Sochaux with a convincing 3-0 home victory against Evian. Salomon Kalou's neat back-flick turned a Florent Balmont shot into the net to give Lille an early lead in France's far north, and the unfortunate Jesper Hansen then scored an own-goal 32 minutes in. The Danish goalkeeper, who was making his Ligue 1 debut, did well to tip a Nolan Roux header onto the bar, but the ball then richocheted off him and into the net to make it 2-0. Ronny Rodelin then took advantage of poor defending to seal the victory in the second half. Among the other games on Wednesday, defending champions Paris Saint-Germain, who trail the leaders by two points, go to struggling Valenciennes without captain Thiago Silva, who faces six weeks out with a thigh injury."

Claudio Ranieri's side welcome 10th-place Bastia to the Stade Louis II as part of a full programme of midweek fixtures in France, leaving Monaco just three days to recover from Sunday's trip to the capital. ""It's a very good point to pick up. It was a difficult match against an excellent Paris team,"" said Monaco midfielder Mounir Obbadi of the draw in the capital. ""Now, we have to recover very quickly because we play again (on Wednesday) against Bastia, another very difficult match,"" added the Moroccan. Monaco are one of the league's two remaining unbeaten sides, along with PSG, and 60-million-euro ($81 million) striker Radamel Falcao has adapted well to life in Ligue 1, having netted five goals in six matches, including the equaliser on Sunday. ""Both teams tried to win and had their chances. In the end it was a draw. The most important thing for us is that the result keeps us top of the standings,"" said Falcao. ""We're making strides as a team. Personally, I'm especially happy to have scored because we stay first,"" added the Colombian. PSG, who climbed a spot to second after surpassing Saint-Etienne on goal difference, travel to lowly Valenciennes, who have lost five in a row following their lone victory on the opening weekend of the season. France midfielder Blaise Matuidi praised Monaco's display on Sunday but conceded the Parisians felt they should have won and vowed that PSG would bounce back at the Stade du Hainaut. ""Monaco showed they have a good team, even if I thought we were better than them (on Sunday). We'll hope to return to winning ways with a victory at Valenciennes on Wednesday,"" said Matuidi. Despite netting a fifth-minute opener, Zlatan Ibrahimovic endured a difficult evening against Monaco, spurning several chances to add to his haul, and echoed Matuidi's sense of regret. ""We're disappointed because we should have won the match. We played at home and we had a lot of chances. We scored but made an error for their equaliser and we paid for it,"" said the Swede, whose goal was just his second of the campaign. ""This season there's more pressure on us. We're the champions and everyone wants to beat us."" Ibrahimovic's partnership with club record signing Edinson Cavani again failed to sparkle, but the former stressed the need for patience. ""My understanding with Cavani? It's coming, it's coming,"" said Ibrahimovic. PSG will be without captain Thiago Silva, who could be out for several weeks, after the Brazilian defender sustained a thigh injury at the weekend. Third-place Saint-Etienne travel to Marseille on Tuesday knowing that a victory at the Velodrome would send Christophe Galtier's side top, for 24 hours at least. However, Marseille, who are a point behind Tuesday's opponents, could also move to the summit should they win by a three-goal margin. The hosts will be without forward Andre-Pierre Gignac, though, who was ruled out for seven to 10 days with a toe problem. Elsewhere, Nice, fresh off a 4-0 thumping of Valenciennes in the opening game at their new Allianz Riviera stadium, travel to Nantes, while Lyon are away to winless Ajaccio. Evian go to Lille on Tuesday and Montpellier entertain Rennes on Thursday. Fixtures (kick-off 1700GMT unless stated)"

Ranieri, meanwhile, kept faith with the team that beat Lorient 1-0 last weekend as Mounir Obbadi continued alongside Geoffrey Kondogbia in central midfield with Jeremy Toulalan still out injured. Ibrahimovic had endured a slow start to the season with just one goal prior to Sunday, but last year's leading scorer made an immediate impact at the Parc des Princes as he gave PSG a fifth-minute lead. Thiago Silva's raking downfield ball picked out the run of left-back Maxwell who crossed for Ibrahimovic to volley past Danijel Subasic from close range. The hosts were dealt a blow on the quarter-hour, though, as Silva limped off with a hamstring injury to be replaced by Zoumana Camara. Falcao then hauled Monaco level on 20 minutes as he threw himself at Joao Moutinho's teasing cross into the box, the Colombian bravely putting his body on the line to head beyond Salvatore Sirigu. Monaco's Yannick Ferreira Carrasco fired just over on the volley shortly after, while Edinson Cavani dragged a shot wide of the far post after clever interplay between himself and Ibrahimovic. The Swede then wasted a glorious chance to add to his tally and restore PSG's advantage as he headed over after being left completely unmarked as Lavezzi swung in a dangerous free-kick. And Ibrahimovic was again guilty of botching another opening just moments later. Played through by Marco Verratti, the striker elected to cut back onto his right foot and, rather than shooting, over hit a chip towards the far post as he tried to pick out an advancing Lavezzi. There was further frustration for Ibrahimovic after the interval as he flicked a low cross from Lavezzi the wrong side of the post. Ferreira Carrasco volleyed wide when well placed, while substitute James Rodriguez and Layvin Kurzawa took turns to test Sirigu from distance but the contest began to peter out as the second half wore on. However, Cavani twice very nearly snatched all three points for PSG in stoppage time. The Uruguayan was firstly denied by a fantastic sliding intervention from Andrea Raggi after he chested down Blaise Matuidi's lofted pass and shot on the turn before he sent a header narrowly wide of the near post as Monaco withstood a late threat. ""We played a very good match, unfortunately we weren't able to get that decisive goal,"" said PSG midfielder Blaise Matuidi. ""We put them in difficulty, we had the chances but we failed to take them. We can be happy with the performance we produced, (it was) one of the best of the season.""

Marseille were struggling following a 2-1 reverse against Arsenal in their Champions League group opener in midweek as Elie Baup's men ran into a frustrating Corsican side who stifled their attack. ""We played 48 hours after an intense match against Arsenal which sapped us of a lot of energy,"" explained Baup. ""We had a lot of possession in the second half and it's a pity we couldn't convert that into a goal. ""We need to remain solid and congratulate the squad after four away matches in six games. Even when we were in trouble, we showed strong mental strength,"" he added. OM 'keeper Steve Mandanda was called into action during a frantic first-half that saw him halt Sebastien Squillaci as well as diverting shots from Tunisian Wahbi Khazri and Romanian striker Claudiu Keseru. ""These kind of matches, when we had three good chances, and if you put one of them away is the key to victory,"" said Bastia coach Frederic Hantz. ""We're happy with the point. At the end of the match, when you look at Marseille who were coming off a series of important matches, it didn't surprise me that they took control. ""There is a certain amount of satisfaction to hold one of the best teams in France and we feel like we're advancing which is positive,"" he added. ""We're a bit disappointed not to win especially after our first half but we're happy with our progress and to hold a big team in the championship."" During the second half, Marseille took control but failed to convert their chances, notably from French international winger Mathieu Valbuena and Florian Thauvin which could have made the difference. Second-placed Saint-Etienne's 2-1 home defeat against Toulouse on Friday kept them on 12 points while Marseille stay in fourth, behind PSG on goal difference. Bastia retain their place in the upper half of Ligue 1 on eight points, five behind Claudio Ranieri's Cote d'Azur outfit. Elsewhere, Montpellier threw away a 2-0 advantage as they were held to a 2-2 draw at French Cup finalists Evian that leaves both clubs camped in the lower half. Reims battled to a 1-1 draw against Guingamp and Lille took advantage of a Nolan Roux brace to see off Sochaux 2-0 away."

516,20/09/2013,22:35,Football: High-flying St Etienne felled by Toulouse,"Toulouse inflicted a 2-1 come-from-behind defeat on high-flying Saint Etienne on Friday, the first win of their campaign at the sixth attempt lifting them out of the relegation zone.","League Cup holders St Etienne turned up at the Pyrenean city on a high with victory assuring them of the Ligue 1 lead, at least until big-spending Monaco's visit to champions Paris Saint Germain on Sunday. And Les Verts, out of the Europa League,  began promisingly, with Romain Hamouma capitalising on a mistake from Toulouse goalkeeper Ali Ahamada to put the visitors into an 18th minute lead. This was the 26-year-old's third goal of the season. The home side drew back level after the hour when Danish striker Martin Braithwaite, a close season recruit, slid home a close range effort. Guinean defender Issiaga Sylla completed the comeback with quarter of an hour remaining, to give Toulouse a much-needed lift and leave Saint-Etienne treading water in second, on 12 points, sandwiched between billionaire duo Monaco and third-placed PSG. Toulouse's reward was to move up four places to 15th. Sunday's headline encounter at Parc des Princes, the first clash of the season between two of Europe's newest financial heavyweights, is set to indicate who has the early edge in France. Both teams are off to unbeaten starts although Monaco come into the match one point clear of Saint-Etienne while PSG are two points back but starting to change gears after an eye-catching 4-1 win over Olympiakos in midweek gave their Champions League quest a dream start. On Saturday, fourth-placed Marseille and last season's runners-up, travel to Bastia."
517,17/09/2013,20:58,Football: Wenger not underestimating Marseille,"Marseille may be the outsiders in a testing Champions League Group F, but Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger knows his team cannot afford to underestimate the French club on Wednesday.","The two clubs renew acquaintances at the Stade Velodrome in their group opener on Wednesday, two years after their last meeting in the south of France, when a last-gasp Aaron Ramsey goal secured a 1-0 win for the Gunners. A limited Marseille side surpassed expectations to reach the quarter-finals that season and, with many of those who participated in that campaign remaining on the books, they have progressed under coach Elie Baup. While the presence of Arsenal as well as last season's Champions League runners-up Borussia Dortmund and Italy's Napoli makes Marseille the outsiders, Wenger believes the French team boast an excellent mix of defensive solidity and attacking flair. ""It is the toughest group. All four teams have a chance of qualifying,"" said Wenger at an eve-of-game press conference at the Velodrome on Tuesday. ""On average, you need 10 points to qualify. We can't say now that we will get nine points at home, so the start of the competition is very important for the confidence of the team. We will try to win. ""Marseille is a city where the people are always very passionate and the team is usually very hard to beat,"" he said ahead of the match at a ground which retains a wonderful atmosphere despite currently being closed on one side for reconstruction. ""They are strong defensively, physically strong. And they have a fearsome attacking quartet of (Mathieu) Valbuena, (Andre) Ayew, (Dimitri) Payet and Andre-Pierre Gignac, players who are all capable of making the difference. ""Some say that Dortmund and Napoli are our main rivals, but I would say they are at the same level."" Wenger, whose team lie just one point behind Liverpool at the top of the Premier League, is without a host of players due to injury for the game, including Santi Cazorla, Lukas Podolski, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Mikel Arteta. However, Mesut Ozil and Olivier Giroud have been passed fit to play after illness and a knee problem respectively. Despite the presence of such talents in the English side, Marseille goalkeeper and captain Steve Mandanda insisted that he is not afraid and is just relishing being back in Europe's elite club competition. ""Why would we be scared? These are magnificent matches to play in and the reason why we play in the first place,"" said Mandanda, who is a survivor from the last meeting of the clubs here. Meanwhile, Marseille coach Baup dismissed suggestions that his team have a responsibility to boost France's standing in the European game at a time when few Ligue 1 clubs other than Paris Saint-Germain appear capable of genuinely competing at the very highest level. ""Our game (in France) has taken an interesting turn in terms of policy,"" said former Bordeaux coach Baup. ""Our under-20 team won the World Cup, our under-19 team got to the European Championship final, and coaches are trying to get their teams to play football. ""We can see this in our national teams but also in our clubs. We have two clubs (PSG and Monaco) with big budgets, comparable to the best teams in Europe, and they have attracted good players. ""All that means that our UEFA coefficient will improve over time."" Baup will be able to welcome back Ghana star Ayew after he served a domestic suspension at the weekend, so new signing Florian Thauvin will likely drop out of the line-up."
518,17/09/2013,02:10,Football: Buoyant Arsenal seek winning start in tough group,In-form Arsenal face Marseille on Wednesday wary of the need to hit the ground running in what was just about the toughest Champions League group they could have been given.,"The Gunners have won their last five matches in all competitions, and sit in a lofty position at the top of the Premier League after Saturday's 3-1 win at Sunderland. That sequence of results, combined with the feel-good factor generated by the arrival of record signing Mesut Ozil from Real Madrid, ensures that confidence is high in Arsene Wenger's squad just now, even if they continue to be plagued by injuries. Santi Cazorla was the latest man to arrive in the treatment room, with an ankle problem ruling him out for the next few weeks, and the Spain star joins the likes of Lukas Podolski and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain on the sidelines. The increasingly pivotal Olivier Giroud should be fit, however, despite picking up a knee knock in the win at Sunderland, and Wenger certainly hopes so after admitting that the France striker ""is the player at the moment that would be very difficult to replace."" A return to a ground he knows well from his days with Montpellier would be a special occasion for Giroud, as Arsenal seek to extend their record of never having lost away to a French club. ""I know Marseille very well, it is a big atmosphere there and an amazing crowd,"" Giroud told the Arsenal website. ""I am sure we will fight as we need a first win in the Champions League to start well. We need to be strong. Even though we have a lot of injuries, we have a lot of quality and we need to win this game."" These clubs met in the group stage two years ago, an Aaron Ramsey goal in injury time securing a 1-0 win for Arsenal at the Stade Velodrome before the clubs drew 0-0 in London. Amid all the talk about Ozil, who impressed on his debut at the weekend, Ramsey has been Arsenal's outstanding player in the opening weeks of this season. The Welshman scored three times in the 5-0 play-off round win over Fenerbahce and was at it again on Saturday, netting a brace. Nevertheless, it is the arrival of Ozil that has lifted the mood among Gunners fans and raised hopes that their team can progress from the group stage for a 14th consecutive campaign despite the presence of last season's runners-up Borussia Dortmund and a Napoli side to be taken seriously under Rafael Benitez. Marseille started the Ligue 1 season with three consecutive wins but needed a late equaliser from Brazilian defender Lucas Mendes to come away from Toulouse with a point on Saturday. While hoping to push fancied duo Paris Saint-Germain and Monaco all the way on the domestic front, there was an acceptance by coach Elie Baup as soon as the draw was made that his team were very much the outsiders in Group F. ""The other three teams are superior to us but we can be the surprise package,"" said Baup at the time. Baup says hard work and an intensive pressing game will be the keys to unsettling Arsenal at a Stade Velodrome which will attract a crowd of around 45,000 despite remaining partially under construction. Nevertheless, the 1993 European champions can boast considerable attacking potential with the likes of Mathieu Valbuena, Andre-Pierre Gignac and Dimitri Payet being joined by France under-20 World Cup winner Florian Thauvin, who completed a protracted transfer from Lille just before the deadline and will hope to make his home debut. ""He has trained a lot and run a lot but he has hardly played any games,"" said Baup of the talented Thauvin, who had previously been monitored by Arsenal and who made his first appearance for Marseille at Toulouse on Saturday. ""I know he is not yet ready but he needs to reacclimatise to playing competitive games."""

Big-spending Monaco could go back to the summit if they win at home to Lorient on Sunday. New Turkish attacking signing Mevlut Erding, formerly of PSG, may have drawn a blank but his supporting act stepped up to the mark in fine style. Corgnet slotted into an empty net on 17 minutes after home goalkeeper Nicolas Penneteau had denied Hamouma. The latter then doubled the advantage on 47 minutes, beating Penneteau with a fine strike from 20 yards. Corgnet wrapped up the victory with a shot through Penneteau's legs from Hamouma's cross six minutes later. Valenciennes' sole response came from a generously-awarded penalty when the referee gave handball against Bayal Sall. Midfielder Corgnet said it was his positioning further forward, behind the front man, that had made the difference. ""That's two matches now that I've played in the hole (behind the striker), my favourite role,"" he said. ""We've been playing better these last two matches and it's a pleasure to be a part of this team."" Earlier, former European champions Marseille had needed a late goal from Brazilian defender Lucas Mendes to snatch a point against the team that began the day bottom of the league. Victory would have taken the team from Provence back to the top of the table, a position they had lost when going down 2-1 at home to Monaco before the international break. ""We had some good periods, especially in the first half, some real quality moves, well co-ordinated, but we didn't turn them into goals,"" said Marseille coach Elie Baup. Marseille created, and squandered, several opportunities, including a shocking miss by Dimitri Payet, who failed to find the net while goalkeeper Ali Ahamada lay helpless on the ground. Ahamada then made an important save to deny France winger Mathieu Valbuena before Toulouse took a shock lead as Wissam Ben Yedder slotted home a pass from Dane, Martin Braithwaite. It would have been enough to secure a first win of the season but Mendes headed home a Valbuena free-kick three minutes from time to earn a point. Even so, Baup's team will need to up their game considerably if they are to gain anything at home to Arsenal in the Champions League in midweek. ""we will have to go looking to make things happen with mental strength, we will have to work hard because our team depends on a lot of collectivity,"" said Baup. On Friday, France midfielder Blaise Matuidi put PSG ahead from a precise Zlatan Ibrahimovic pass before Brazilian winger Lucas Moura sealed the victory for Laurent Blanc's team in the second half. It was a dominant performance from the champions against woeful opponents as PSG demonstrated they are starting to find their feet under Carlo Ancelotti's replacement. Sochaux dropped to the bottom of the table following a 1-0 defeat at Nantes, who moved up to sixth. Reims are fifth after a goalless draw at Montpellier while Ajaccio continue to fall -- they are now just one place above the relegation zone - following a 3-2 defeat at home to Evian.

Their last goal came in March in a 3-1 win over Georgia at home, but since then they have lost 1-0 to Spain in their European zone qualifying Group I, been beaten in friendlies by Uruguay (1-0) and Brazil (3-0) and played out a goalless draw with Belgium in another friendly. If France go another 21 minutes in Belarus on Tuesday without finding the net, they will also set an absolute national record for the number of consecutive minutes without troubling the scoreboards. And yet Deschamps says he is not worried, although he admits their struggles are becoming a problem. ""I'm not worried but if we're there (setting a new record) it's because we've got problems. I'm assessing it and doing everything to improve it,"" said Deschamps. ""Our problem for five matches is that we haven't scored. From that point of view it's impossible to win matches. We have to find a way to improve that. ""I don't have any miracle solutions but we shouldn't beat ourselves up either, we need to keep persevering to reverse this tendency. ""We need to work hard and add a bit more technical precision, more quick-wittedness and that part of success and luck that you have at certain times and is missing at others."" Deschamps has persisted with Real Madrid forward Karim Benzema, although he hauled him off after an hour in Tbilisi. But the 25-year-old has now gone 20 hours and 26 minutes without hitting the net for club and country. Until now, he has been an indisputable fixture in Deschamps's team but there was a sign on Friday that change is afoot. Never before had Deschamps replaced his first-choice forward so early in a competitive fixture. What he went for instead at that juncture was a combination of Arsenal's Olivier Giroud alongside Marseille's Pierre-Andre Gignac, not that either looked any more likely to endanger the goal netting. But despite drawing five straight blanks, Deschamps denied the crux of the problem was a lack of talent. ""The attacking players have quality because they score for their teams,"" he said. ""I have players playing in Ligue 1, others in big clubs playing in the Champions League. The more I have, the better it is.

Finishing above the reigning European and world champions may be beyond Les Bleus, but they should still be strong enough to claim second place and a spot in November's two-legged play-offs. Nevertheless, to win in Georgia -- where Spain toiled to a 1-0 win earlier in the campaign -- and go on to reach next year's finals in Brazil, France must sort out their problems in front of goal. Following last month's 0-0 friendly draw in Belgium, France have now gone six hours without scoring since their 3-1 win against the Georgians at the Stade de France in March. It is largely because of their struggles in front of goal that Deschamps's side have lost four of their six matches in 2013 and the focal point of criticism amongst fans and the media has been Karim Benzema. The Real Madrid striker is supposed to be the national team's star man, and yet he has not scored in 19 and a quarter hours on the field at international level since bagging a brace in a friendly against Estonia ahead of Euro 2012. ""Karim keeps being mentioned because of his lack of goals for us. I hope he puts an end to that as soon as possible,"" bemoaned Deschamps before the squad departed on Wednesday for Tbilisi, where the game will be played at 2215 local time (1815 GMT) to fit in with peak television viewing times in France. Benzema has no shortage of support from his colleagues, with Arsenal defender Laurent Koscielny saying: ""His qualities can't have disappeared overnight. He just needs that trigger to regain his confidence. The team is right behind him."" But while France boast the 2012-13 European player of the season in their ranks in Franck Ribery, as well as Marseille's Mathieu Valbuena, who excelled in the home win against Georgia, Deschamps must decide who to play in front of his chief creators. He has options beyond simply sticking with Benzema at the head of a 4-2-3-1, with one being to pair the 25-year-old with Arsenal's Olivier Giroud, scorer of the winning goal in last weekend's north London derby against Tottenham Hotspur. Another option is for Deschamps to hand a start to Andre-Pierre Gignac, the burly Marseille striker who was handed his first call-up since the 2010 World Cup after scoring three goals in the first three games of the Ligue 1 season. ""The coach must make choices. We are lucky to have quality strikers and that should give us strength rather than be a problem,"" insisted Arsenal full-back Bacary Sagna. ""Giroud is as much at ease at his club as he is with France. But we point the finger at Karim because he is a centre-forward and that is unfair. The rest of us players need to give him more support."" Elsewhere, with Tottenham's Etienne Capoue and Lyon's Clement Grenier having pulled out due to injury, it seems likely that Josuha Guilavogui and Geoffrey Kondogbia will play together in central midfield. Kondogbia won his first cap against Belgium last month before joining Monaco from Sevilla for 20 million euros ($26.8 million), while Guilavogui last weekend left Saint-Etienne for Atletico Madrid. Temuri Ketsbaia's Georgia side have collected just four points from five games and have scored just three goals in that run."

529,01/09/2013,23:28,Football: Monaco go top in France after Velodrome victory,Newly promoted Monaco went top of Ligue 1 after coming from behind to defeat Marseille 2-1 in a thrilling encounter at the Velodrome on Sunday.,"The home side took the lead on the stroke of half-time when a Mathieu Valbuena corner from the left was headed home by Brazilian defender Lucas Mendes for his first goal in the French top flight on 43 minutes. However the lead was short lived as Monaco took advantage of some sloppy Marseille defending to equalise through Colombian record signing Radamel Falcao who crashed the ball home three minutes inside the second half for his third goal of the season. Frenchman Emmanuel Riviere then stole the headlines with 11 minutes left as he latched onto a sweet through ball from Portuguese midfielder Joao Moutinho before slotting the ball past former French number one Steeve Mandanda. It was Riviere's league leading fifth goal of the season. ""I finished off the work,"" said Riviere. ""My speed is my greatest quality and Im at 100% this season. ""It is my confidence which explains my success and the work I've put in. ""What is missing is finishing but my ambition is to target the France national team,"" he added. On a sour note for the 2004 Champions League finalists, Falcao came off with just over 15 minutes left with a right ankle problem although details of the injury remain uncertain. Monaco take their early season tally to 10 points from four matches while Saint-Etienne go joint second on nine with Marseille after defeating Bordeaux 2-1 earlier in the day and defending champions Paris Saint-Germain are on eight. Saint-Etienne bounced back from their midweek Europa League disappointment to beat Bordeaux 2-1 at home while Montpellier came back twice to force a 2-2 draw against fellow southerners Nice. At the Geoffroy-Guichard stadium where Saint-Etienne crashed out in the play-off round on Thursday, losing to Danish side Esbjerg 5-3 on aggregate, Sunday was another matter as goals from Romain Hamouma and captain Loic Perrin ensured there was no European hangover for Christophe Galtier's side. Meanwhile Nice played their last home match at the Stade du Ray before moving into a new venue but despite leading 1-0 and 2-1, Claude Puel's men were pegged back by the 2012 champions in an entertaining 2-2 draw. Galtier's side made it three wins from four as their midweek European disaster was put to one side and put them right in the thick of the title race on nine points. ""I expected a reaction after our Europa League elimination and the best response was the one we produced on the pitch even if there were times we suffered from fatigue and people playing out of position,"" said Galtier afterwards. ""It's a good win as we were coming off a big disappointment,"" he added. Josuha Guilavogui was held out of the hosts' squad with the France midfielder on the verge of a move to Atletico Madrid, but despite his absence Saint-Etienne went in front on eight minutes. Banel Nicolita was afforded too much time on the right and his teasing cross was volleyed expertly past Bordeaux goalkeeper Cedric Carrasso by Hamouma. The home side came close to a second just before half-time as Fabien Lemoine rattled the post, and Perrin went onto double their advantage five minutes after the break as he nodded in Benjamin Corgnet's free-kick. Ludovic Obraniak ensured the hosts were made to face a nervy finish as he cut the deficit with a thunderous strike in the 90th minute, but Saint-Etienne held on to record a third win in four outings and climb up to second."

However, Ezequiel Lavezzi got what proved to be the winner in the 74th minute, firing home the loose ball after a Lucas effort had been blocked on the line by Gabriel Cichero. With his choice of a 4-4-2 formation coming in for some criticism after the defending champions were held by Montpellier and then Ajaccio in their opening two games, PSG coach Laurent Blanc opted for a three-man attack here, with Lavezzi brought back in alongside Cavani and Zlatan Ibrahimovic. ""We could go back to the 4-4-2 but also (try out) other systems. We need to find a system which gives us balance,"" said Blanc. ""We have an attacking potential that many other clubs envy but we mustn't forget that to win a match we have to defend well."" Even against a five-man Nantes defence, PSG threatened to run riot in the early stages, with home goalkeeper Remy Riou racing off his line to deny Ibrahimovic before Cavani's first-time half-volley flashed just wide midway through the first half. Shortly after, Ibrahimovic and Cavani combined for the opening goal, with the latter racing on to the Swede's pass before firing low past Riou. Yet the visitors could not build on that and only a fine Salvatore Sirigu save prevented Cichero from equalising for Nantes from an overhead kick just before the break. The hosts did draw level soon after the restart when the unfortunate Alex, under pressure from Papy Djilobodji, saw a Jordan Veretout free-kick rebound off him and into the net at the back post. Sirigu then had to save well to keep out a net-bound Alejandro Bedoya header, but PSG silenced the 37,000 crowd when Lavezzi scored what proved to be the winner. Earlier on an attritional weekend in France's top flight, Nice were held to a goalless draw by Ajaccio in Corsica, while Saint-Etienne dropped their first points of the league campaign, going down 1-0 away to a young Lille side. Salomon Kalou scored the only goal from the penalty spot to deny Les Verts the chance to move level at the top of the table with leaders Marseille. ""Saint-Etienne are a team who often pose us problems,"" acknowledged Kalou, mindful that it was they who pipped Lille to a European place at the end of last season, having also knocked them out of both domestic cup competitions. Marseille end the weekend two points clear of Monaco at the summit after maintaining their perfect start to the season with a hard-fought 1-0 win at Valenciennes, Andre-Pierre Gignac netting a late winner.

In contrast to Marseille, Lyon's perfect start to the campaign was ended in a 1-0 home defeat to Reims, as Odair Fortes's deflected effort gave the visitors the points after Clement Grenier had missed a penalty for the hosts in a second half delayed for 35 minutes because of torrential rain at the Stade de Gerland.

Marseille have struggled regularly in Valenciennes recent campaigns and saw their run of six straight victories at the start of last season ended with a comprehensive 4-1 loss at the Stade du Hainaut. A repeat of such a defeat never looked on the cards, as Marseille created the most of what chances there were. Gignac chipped wide with Penneteau off his line in the 20th minute, while Mathieu Valbuena volleyed just over shortly before the interval. Baup threw on recent signing Saber Khalifa for his debut for the final 11 minutes and the game finally came to life. There was a huge escape for the visitors when Steve Mandanda saved from Mathieu Dossevi before Aurelian Chitu somehow failed to net the follow-up, and Gignac made Valenciennes pay moments later when he netted his third goal in as many games. Opa Nguette then squandered another glorious chance for the hosts as OM hung on for the win.

The result left Elie Baup's side provisionally two points clear at the top of the table with a maximum nine points from three games, although Lyon could join them later if they beat Reims at the Stade de Gerland. Marseille have struggled in Valenciennes recent years and saw their run of six straight victories at the start of last season ended with a comprehensive 4-1 loss at the Stade du Hainaut. A repeat of such a defeat never looked on the cards, as Marseille created the most of what chances there were. Gignac chipped wide with Penneteau off his line in the 20th minute, while Mathieu Valbuena volleyed just over shortly before the interval. Baup threw on recent signing Saber Khalifa for his debut for the final 11 minutes and the game finally came to life. There was a huge escape for the visitors when Steve Mandanda saved from Mathieu Dossevi before Aurelian Chitu somehow failed to net the follow-up, and Gignac made Valenciennes pay moments later when he netted his third goal in as many games. Opa Nguette then squandered another glorious chance for the hosts as OM hung on for the win.

French football authorities ordered that the match be played without paying spectators as a punishment for incidents at the end of Monaco's last home game of last season, when fans set off flares and invaded the pitch.

On the pitch, sixty-million euro signing Radamel Falcao is off to an impressive start with two goals in two games since his move from Atletico Madrid. The Colombian celebrated the birth of his new daughter on the eve of his strike against Montpellier last Sunday which helped spark a 4-1 rout of the 2012 champions.

They travel to promoted Nantes in the final match of the weekend on Sunday desperate for a return on their massive investment which led them to their first French title last season since 1994 and a narrow defeat in the Champions League quarter-finals against Barcelona. The 'Canaries' are expected to employ a defensive formation that worked so well for Ravanelli's men at the Parc des Princes. ""We could be spending the match defending in the final 20 metres,"" warned Nantes coach Michel Der Zakarian. Marseille and Saint-Etienne are also sitting pretty on six points from two matches as they get set for away matches at Valenciennes and Lille on Saturday and Sunday respectively. Seven-time French champions Lyon lead Monaco by the paltry advantage of having scored one more goal but their season hit an oil slick in midweek as they were completely outclassed by Spanish side Real Sociedad 2-0 in the first leg of their Champions League qualifying tie at the Stade Gerland.

545,17/08/2013,22:15,Football: Marseille and Saint Etienne join Lyon at summit,Marseille and Saint-Etienne joined Lyon at the top of Ligue 1 with respective victories over Evian and Guingamp in France on Saturday.,"Lyon, who defeated Sochaux 3-1 on Friday, lead on goal difference with the trio of teams locked on maximum points after two outings. At the Velodrome, French international Andre-Pierre Gignac inspired Marseille to a 2-0 defeat of Evian with a brilliant opener on 16 minutes before the home side then made the points safe with 23 minutes left when Dimitri Payet pounced on a rebound for his third goal of the young season. ""The numbers speak for themselves,"" said delighted Marseille coach Elie Baup. ""We've got six points, scored five and conceded one so we've got our season off to a very good start."" Saint-Etienne, who picked up their first silverware last season since winning the league in 1981 title when they won the League Cup, continued where they left off with a deserved 1-0 win over promoted yet pointless Guingamp. The only goal of the match was a flowing move on 52 minutes that was superbly finished off by Fabian Lemoine after a one-two on the edge of the box. Bordeaux gave themselves a hard nights' work when defender Marc Planus was shown a straight red card after just 28 minutes for a shocking tackle on Israeli international Eden Ben Basat but managed to escape with a 1-1 draw at Toulouse. The visitors, who last won the title under current PSG coach Laurent Blanc in 2009, took the lead just before half-time when Malian international Cheick Diabate broke the offside trap and beat Toulouse keeper Ali Ahamada with a close range finish. The lead lasted just two minutes however as Toulouse equalised through Ben Basat who shook off an earlier disallowed goal and blasted home a loose ball after a mixup in the Bordeaux defence. Europa League hopefuls Nice bounced back from their 4-0 thrashing at Lyon last weekend with a 2-1 win over Rennes as they got off to a bright start with a 20th minute opener from Argentine Dario Cvitanic against Rennes. Rennes got the perfect tonic before half-time when Nelson Oliveira scored in the dying seconds of the opening 45 minutes before a defensive howler put Nice back in front. An unforgivable mistake from Nigerian Ejike Uzoenyi - who was last man back - handed the ball on a plate to Jeremy Pied who calmly slotted in past astonished Rennes 'keeper Benoit Costil for three priceless points. Bastia were also the benificiaries of poor defending as they notched up their first points of the season with a 2-0 win over Valenciennes thanks to a Gianni Bruno tap-in with 14 minutes left before a powerful header from Adama Ba three minutes later carried the Corsicans home. Elsewhere, Reims handed new Lille coach Rene Girard his first defeat since moving from Montpellier where he won the 2012 title as they ran out 2-1 winners just outside Paris. Champions Paris Saint-Germain host Ajaccio on Sunday and Monaco have their home opener against Montpellier while the other match features Lorient at home to Nantes."
546,16/08/2013,02:25,Football: Blanc hoping for Cavani impact as PSG make home bow,"Paris Saint-Germain play their first home game since Laurent Blanc replaced Carlo Ancelotti as coach of the Ligue 1 champions when they entertain Ajaccio at the Parc des Princes on Sunday evening, with memories of last season's struggles against the Corsicans still fresh.","The capital club were held to goalless draws in both meetings with Ajaccio in 2012-13, but those results did not prevent them from comfortably winning the Ligue 1 crown in May. Former France coach Blanc has been at the helm for six weeks now, and oversaw the Champions Trophy win against Bordeaux in his first competitive game at the helm before a 1-1 draw in Montpellier in last weekend's league opener. In both games, PSG have had to come from behind, with Brazilian full-back Maxwell earning them a draw at the Stade de la Mosson after they had trailed at the interval against opponents who pressed and harried tirelessly. With Corsican sides renowned for their aggression, and Ajaccio coach Fabrizio Ravanelli determined to make his team difficult to beat, PSG could face a frustrating evening on Sunday. However, Blanc will hope that 64 million-euro (US$85.4m, £54.6m) record signing Edinson Cavani can have an impact on his home debut after almost scoring as a substitute in Montpellier. ""Certainly,"" Blanc said when asked if the Uruguayan former Napoli striker, who started pre-season training late, will feature against Ajaccio. ""But the question is will he start. That is a decision we will take. He is a little bit behind with his preparation and has had some fitness problems."" Ajaccio lost 1-0 to Saint-Etienne last weekend, but Ravanelli will relish the occasion in the capital having already experienced the heat of the Parc des Princes during his days as a Marseille player. In November 1997, the Italian striker played a central part in a controversial victory at the ground for PSG's bitter rivals, diving to win a penalty that was converted by...Laurent Blanc. ""It is a great thing to return to Paris, especially as a coach. It is a real pleasure,"" said Ravanelli. ""We know we will be playing against an extraordinary team with extraordinary means. But even if we lose we will come out with our heads held high, because we know we can enjoy a good season."" Earlier on Sunday, Monaco, tipped as PSG's most likely title challengers, will look to build on their opening-day win at Bordeaux when they welcome Montpellier to the Stade Louis II. Claudio Ranieri's side. a mixture of expensive summer acquisitions and exciting young talent, won 2-0 in Bordeaux, with Radamel Falcao netting a debut goal after his 60 million-euro move from Atletico Madrid. And in midweek they won an appeal against a three-point deduction handed down as a punishment for a trouble at the end of a game last season, so confidence will be high at the principality club. Confidence is also high in Marseille after OM cruised to an opening-day win in Guingamp. They play host to Evian on Saturday, although recent signing Saber Khalifa is unlikely to make his debut against his former club in that encounter as he builds up his fitness. After thumping Nice 4-0 last weekend, Lyon travel to Sochaux on Friday, the match being brought forward to help Remi Garde's side prepare for next midweek's Champions League play-off, first leg against Real Sociedad. ""Sochaux are a team that like to play football and don't worry about their opponents. That's the club's culture,"" said Garde. ""We are expecting a tough game. We need to confirm our good form and try and cause them as many problems as possible."" In the pick of the other matches, Nice face Rennes at the Stade du Ray, although that match will be played behind closed doors as a punishment for fan misbehaviour last season.

One fan also attacked the referee in the incident, which came after Monaco secured promotion back to the top flight. Monaco had said they should be treated like any other club, criticising the sanction -- which also includes a suspended one point deduction -- as unduly harsh and disproportionate. Monaco opened their Ligue 1 account on Saturday with a 2-0 win against Bordeaux. The FFF said the behind-closed-doors match was applicable from the club's next match on Sunday against Montpellier."

Payet doubled the advantage for the 1993 European Cup winners just two minutes later after good work from Ayew down the left before making it 3-0 after just a quarter of an hour. Malian international striker Mustapha Yatabare pulled one back with 16 minutes remaining after Marseille keeper Steve Mandanda had first saved a penalty from the same player seven minutes after the restart, but Marseille were good value for the three points. Earlier Sunday, Brazilian striker Brandao struck the only goal to ensure a 1-0 win for Saint Etienne and spoil Fabrizio Ravanelli's debut as Ajaccio coach. The 44-year-old Italian, who won the Champions League with Juventus in 1996 but has only two years coaching experience at youth level, could only look on as former Marseille marksman Brandao gave the League Cup winners a perfect start to the season. Crowd trouble before the match between both sets of supporters put a stain on the opening weekend of the season. Saint-Etienne's team bus was bombarded with missiles from the Corsican club's fans as they arrived at the stadium which led to a series of incidents including supporters from both teams and security personnel. Lyon are the early leaders on goal difference after crushing Nice 4-0 on Saturday while there were also wins for Monaco, Lille, Nantes, Rennes and Valenciennes. Defending champions Paris Saint-Germain experienced frustration as they were held to a 1-1 draw at 2012 champions Montpellier in the opening match of the season on Friday. There was controversy during Valenciennes' 3-0 win at home to Toulouse after referee Stephane Jochem, officiating his first top flight game, awarded a spotkick for what he deemed a foul by Burkina Faso international Steeve Yago on Grégory Pujol only to change his mind several minutes later and red card Serbian Uros Spajic instead.

""I was curious to see my team against Bordeaux who are a good side with big, strong players and who are very compact on the counter-attack."" Despite the win, Monaco only clinched a single point after they were deducted two following crowd trouble last season. There were also opening day victories for Lyon, Rennes, Valenciennes and Lille while champions Paris Saint-Germain were held to a 1-1 draw at Montpeller on the opening day of the season on Friday. At the Stade Gerland, seven-time champions Lyon coasted to a 4-0 win over hapless Nice after taking a 13th-minute lead when Alexandre Lacazette won a battle in the box before banging home from what replays appeared to indicate an offside position. Clement Grenier then doubled the lead for Remi Garde's men nine minutes inside the second half after good work from former French player of the year Yoann Gourcuff as the team got the ideal preparation to face Real Sociedad in the final round of Champions League qualifying in the first leg on August 20. Lacazette added a second and guaranteed top spot albeit on goal difference with his second of the match with 22 minutes remaining before Gourcuff put a gloss on the scoreline with a late fourth. Nantes got off to a flying start on their return to the top flight for the first time since 2009 when Serbian international Filip Dordevic slipped the ball past Bastia 'keeper Mickael Landreau who began his fine career with Nantes at 17. Valenciennes took the lead at home to Toulouse in controversial fashion when the referee awarded a soft penalty after contact between Steeve Yago on Gregory Pujol, but inexplicably sent off Serbian defender Uros Spajic who had little to do with the action. Regardless, Maor Melikson converted the penalty on 37 minutes. Jose Saez made the points safe on 52 minutes when he crashed home a low shot after a close range header came back off the crossbar following a corner and Pujol tucked away the third in the dying seconds.
