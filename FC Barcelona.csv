0,13/02/2021,23:14,Messi leads Barca to thumping Alaves win,Barcelona might not be able to catch Atletico Madrid but they may fancy their chances against Paris Saint-Germain after Lionel Messi scored twice in a 5-1 thrashing of Alaves on Saturday.,"Messi fired in two sensational long-range efforts and would have had a hat-trick at Camp Nou had a dubious VAR decision in the first half not ruled Antoine Griezmann offside. He did tee up a second of the night for the 21-year-old Francisco Trincao and was instrumental in Junior Firpo adding a fifth too, a flamboyant scoop freeing Griezmann to send a pass to Firpo at the back post. Victory means Barca trail Atletico Madrid by eight points again after Atletico had temporarily pulled 11 clear thanks to a hard-fought 2-1 win over Granada earlier on Saturday. Barcelona and Real Madrid have both played a game more than Atleti, with Zinedine Zidane's side facing Valencia at home on Sunday. Atletico's win was a significant psychological boost on the back of slipping up for the first time in nine games at home to Celta Vigo earlier this week. Their advantage may prove too large to close but Barcelona's tie against PSG in the Champions League, which looked to have the French side as firm favourites when the draw was made in December, now feels harder to call. Mauricio Pochettino's side will probably be favourites ahead of the first leg at Camp Nou on Tuesday but Barca have certainly found form in recent weeks, and Messi looks close to his lethal best. The question is whether a free-flowing attack, full of talent and orchestrated by Messi, can hurt PSG enough to make up for what remains a shaky defence, depleted by injuries and vulnerable to the counter-attack. With Gerard Pique and the emerging Ronald Araujo both out injured, Frenkie de Jong filled in again in central defence, although the Dutchman has arguably been Barcelona's most improved player this year in the midfield three. Instead there was a start for Ilaix Kourouma in midfield, the 18-year-old academy product who assisted Trincao's opening goal but whose misplaced pass led to Luis Rioja briefly giving Alaves hope. After Trincao had swept home, Messi thought he had made it two, pouncing on a rebound after Griezmann missed but the goal was ruled out, even though replays suggested Griezmann was onside. Messi made amends soon after, latching onto a Sergio Busquets pass, darting in-field and ripping a shot in off the post. Rioja capitalised on Ilaix's mistake just before the hour but Barca pulled away with three goals in six minutes. Pedri's pass freed Messi but he failed to round Fernando Pacheco and instead the ball spilled out for Trincao to score his second. Messi slammed a stinging strike into the top corner from 25 yards to make it 4-1 before perhaps the goal of the night came last, Messi scooping over for Griezmann, who volleyed to the back post where Firpo could not miss. Atletico had earlier swerved a second consecutive slip by squeezing past Granada at Los Carmenes, a victory secured by Angel Correa's fortuitous winner in the second half. There was a hint of luck in Granada's equaliser too, Yangel Herrera's shot deflecting off Marcos Llorente, who had himself put Atletico in front only three minutes earlier. ""The most important thing today was the fight and the energy of the team,"" said Simeone afterwards. At the full-time whistle, he shook his fists and sprinted down the tunnel, his relief evident at the end of a game that could easily have seen more points dropped for his side. Luis Suarez had scored in six of the previous seven games but for once the 34-year-old was not the matchwinner, with Llorente and Correa -- two unsung heroes this season -- instead proving the difference. Llorente's goal was his seventh of the season while his lay-off for Correa was his sixth assist. ""As coaches trophies are wonderful because they fill you with excitement and glory,"" Simeone said of Llorente. ""But when you work with a footballer and see them grow, you feel even more joy and more enthusiasm to keep doing what you're doing."""
1,11/02/2021,16:34,Injured Neymar out of PSG's Champions League clash with Barcelona: club,"Neymar will miss Paris Saint-Germain's Champions League last 16, first leg match against his former club Barcelona due to a groin injury, the French club said Thursday.","The Brazilian forward suffered the injury in PSG's 1-0 win against Caen in the French Cup on Wednesday, ruling him out of the game in Spain on February 16."
2,10/02/2021,23:40,Sevilla double leaves Barca with mountain to climb in Copa del Rey,Barcelona's hopes of winning the Copa del Rey this season were left hanging by a thread on Wednesday after Sevilla won the first leg of their semi-final 2-0.,"Jules Kounde furthered his growing reputation as one of the world's most exciting central defenders by scoring a stunning goal at the Ramon Sanchez Pizjuan before Ivan Rakitic came back to haunt his former club by adding a second late on. The 22-year-old Kounde dribbled past three Barca defenders and shot into the corner while Rakitic's strike turned a setback for Ronald Koeman's side into what now looks like a formidable challenge to make the final. The winner will meet either Athletic Bilbao or Levante, who play the first leg of their semi on Thursday, in the final. ""The result is a bit unfair, the reward feels too much for them,"" said Koeman. ""The return will be complicated at 2-0 but we have had chances and we have to keep going. At home, this team is capable of anything."" Koeman had described the cup as Barcelona's ""shortest route"" to a trophy this term and the sight of Kounde ghosting through his defence hardly inspires confidence ahead of next week's meeting with Paris Saint-Germain. Barca face PSG at Camp Nou in the first leg of the Champions League last 16 on Tuesday. Yet all is not lost in the cup. Although Koeman fielded his best available XI, after resting players against Real Betis in La Liga last weekend, he will also hope to have injured defenders available again for the return game at Camp Nou on March 3. With Ronald Araujo and Gerard Pique out, Koeman played a patched-up back four of Jordi Alba at left-back, the left-footed Junior Firpo at right-back, right-back Oscar Mingueza at centre-back, alongside Samuel Umtiti, who is still regaining sharpness after a string of injuries. ""We are halfway through the tie with the hardest half to come,"" said Sevilla coach Julen Lopetegui. Lionel Messi was quiet but forced a decent save from Bono early on after a superb pass by Antoine Griezmann, with Sevilla the better side in the first half and deserving their goal. Kounde carried the ball out from deep in his own half and bounced the ball off Suso before advancing into Barcelona's defensive third. He ghosted past Griezmann, darted inside Sergio Busquets and with Alba dragged left, nicked it around the legs of Umtiti before driving into the far corner to complete a stunning individual effort. Barca had Marc-Andre ter Stegen to thank for denying Sergio Escudero a second but neither side looked keen to risk conceding by pushing too hard for a goal after half-time. Yet Sevilla were gifted one with five minutes left as Oliver Torres' ball over the top freed Rakitic, who had options inside. Rakitic went alone, blasting into the roof of the net and refusing to celebrate, but putting Sevilla in sight of the final."
3,09/02/2021,15:40,PSG lose Di Maria for Barca Champions League tie,"Argentinian forward Angel Di Maria will miss the first leg of Paris Saint-Germain's Champions League last 16 match at Barcelona, coach Mauricio Pochettino said on Tuesday.","Di Maria suffered a thigh injury during the 2-0 Ligue 1 win against Marseille on Sunday and ""he will not be at the Camp Nou"" for the game on February 16, Pochettino said. ""Angel is an important player for us but we have a big squad with players who can win matches for us,"" the coach added. Di Maria, the 32-year-old former Manchester United winger, has been ever-present in the PSG lineup since Pochettino joined the club in December, lining up alongside Neymar, Kylian Mbappe and Mauro Icardi in a high-powered attack. Despite the bad news about Di Maria, last year's Champions League finalists hope to be able to select first-choice goalkeeper Keylor Navas, who is expected to return from a groin injury to resume training later this week."
4,08/02/2021,14:20,"Bayern fume, Mbappe flies, Zlatan's milestone: European talking points","Bayern Munich's preparation for the Club World Cup was disrupted despite victory, Kylian Mbappe rediscovered his supersonic speed and Lionel Messi starred from the bench, while Zlatan Ibrahimovic notched his 500th club goal at the weekend.","AFP Sport rounds up some of the main talking points from across the continent: Bayern Munich's weekend started well, Kingsley Coman's deflected strike securing a 1-0 win at Hertha Berlin on Friday as they maintained a seven-point lead at the top of the Bundesliga from RB Leipzig. They then boarded a plane for Qatar in preparation for a night flight to the Club World Cup, but the necessary de-icing of the aircraft meant they were refused permission for take-off due to a ban on flights between midnight and 7:00 am. That meant a departure seven hours later than planned, ruining plans to train on Saturday and hampering preparations for Monday's semi-final against Al Ahly. ""Those in charge (at the airport) don't have an inkling of what they've done to our team,"" Bayern chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge said. ""Of course it was not optimal,"" said Joshua Kimmich. ""Nonetheless I think that we will be able to win the match."" It was what made Kylian Mbappe so breathtaking when he first broke through but it was something that had not been seen so often this season. On Sunday the France star produced a stunning sprint to finish off a counter-attack and score Paris Saint-Germain's opener in a 2-0 win at Marseille. Mbappe's run was clocked at an incredible 36 kilometres per hour, but he managed to slow down enough to control Angel di Maria's pass and score his 16th Ligue 1 goal this season, as PSG stayed third, three points behind leaders Lille. ""The feeling is coming back because I am playing every game now,"" said Mbappe, who was often on the bench in Thomas Tuchel's final matches in charge but has hardly missed a minute under new coach Mauricio Pochettino. ""I am finishing games stronger. I am not so burnt out. It can only be a good thing."" PSG's Champions League last 16, first leg in Barcelona is just eight days away. The last time Lionel Messi came off the bench in La Liga, he was introduced at half-time and scored twice in a 5-2 win over Betis. On Sunday he again came on as a substitute against Betis, this time in the 57th minute. Moments later he scored Barcelona's equaliser, and he then played a key part in their second before fellow substitute Francisco Trincao's late strike secured a 3-2 win. Messi was rested at the start along with Frenkie de Jong and Pedri, with coach Ronald Koeman appearing to prioritise Wednesday's Copa del Rey semi-final, first leg at Sevilla, and with the PSG Champions League tie approaching too. Barca, like Real Madrid, are seven points behind La Liga leaders Atletico Madrid, who have two games in hand and play on Monday against Celta Vigo. Zlatan Ibrahimovic's brace was key in setting AC Milan on the way to a 4-0 win over Crotone that kept them two points clear of Inter atop Serie A, but it also saw the former Sweden striker reach a remarkable milestone. The goals were his 500th and 501st at club level since starting out with Malmo in 1999. Now 39, he is in his second spell with Milan and his hoping to win a second Scudetto with the Rossoneri, after starring in their 2011 title triumph. Ibrahimovic scored 14 goals that season and already has 14 this season, in just 11 appearances. Mesut Ozil made his second substitute appearance in five days for new club Fenerbahce but could not help turn Istanbul's Intercontinental derby, as Galatasaray headed back to the European side of the Bosphorus with a 1-0 win. Ozil had helped set up a goal in Fenerbahce's 2-1 win at Hatayspor last Wednesday. Against Galatasaray, the ex-Arsenal man came on for the last 27 minutes with Fenerbahce already trailing. It is shaping up to be quite a title run-in in Turkey, with Galatasaray, Besiktas and Fenerbahce all level on 48 points at the top."
5,07/02/2021,23:47,Super-sub Messi leads Barcelona comeback against Betis,Lionel Messi scored his fastest league goal as a substitute as his strike 136 seconds after coming on inspired Barcelona to a 3-2 victory over Real Betis on Sunday.,"Messi was among several key players rested, with Ronald Koeman seemingly prioritising Wednesday's Copa del Rey semi-final against Sevilla ahead of Barca's fading title challenge in La Liga. Defeat would have called that decision into question but Messi drove in an equaliser less than three minutes after coming on in the second half and then helped set up Francisco Trincao to score a late winner, the 21-year-old's first goal for Barcelona. ""He changed the game,"" said Koeman, when asked about Messi. ""It's a bit about the cup game but we also have to decide when the best moment is to rest players. The cup is the shortest route to a title this season."" Koeman's side sit seven points behind La Liga's leaders Atletico Madrid, who have played two games fewer and face Celta Vigo at home on Monday night. Success also came at a cost as Barca's best available central defender Ronald Araujo was forced off with an ankle injury early on. With Gerard Pique already a long-term absentee, Araujo's fitness will be a huge concern, especially with a Champions League last 16 first leg at home to Paris Saint-Germain to come, a week after the test against Sevilla. Betis will wonder how they managed not to take at least a point from a wild contest at the Benito Villamarin but Barcelona sustain their momentum, this their sixth league victory in a row. They were hit early by the injury to Araujo, whose ankle caved under the weight of an awkward fall. Frenkie de Jong came in at centre-back and his partner Clement Lenglet should have given Barca the lead but headed wide from five yards out with nobody near him. Betis made them pay with a brilliant opening goal on the break. Ousmane Dembele lost the ball upfield and Betis poured forward, the ball shifted right to Emerson who motored round Jordi Alba and squared for Borja Iglesias to slam home. Juanmi might have made it two but was denied by Marc-Andre ter Stegen before Messi came on for Miralem Pjanic in the 57th minute and equalised in the 59th. Dembele returned a pass to the Argentinian on the edge of the area and he drove a sizzling shot inside the post. Nine minutes later, Barca were in front, Alba's cross mishit by Antoine Griezmann, only for the ball to cannon in anyway off the legs of Victor Ruiz. Betis were not finished yet and neither was Ruiz, the defender making amends by heading in Nabil Fekir's crossed free-kick with 15 minutes left. Yet Barcelona had one more trick up their sleeve as Messi weaved in from the left and his chipped pass was headed into the path of the 21-year-old Trincao, whose thundering shot flew in off the crossbar."
6,06/02/2021,16:29,"Messi happy again at Barcelona, says Koeman",Ronald Koeman said on Friday he believes Lionel Messi is happy again at Barcelona but admits only the Argentina forward will decide his future at the club.,"Messi can leave for free when his contract expires in June, with Manchester City and Paris Saint-Germain both expected to make a fresh attempt to sign the striker. ""There is only one person who can decide his future and it is him,"" coach Koeman said. ""I would like him to stay for many more years and I try to make sure he is happy, like he is at the moment. ""Leo gives the team a lot of quality and we need him. He improves the morale and the energy of the team but his future is in his hands."" But Barca have been improving in recent weeks under the Dutch boss as they look to make it six La Liga wins in a row when they travel to Real Betis on Sunday. Their revival has coincided with a return to form for Antoine Griezmann, who has scored seven goals in his last eight games, including two in a 5-3 Copa del Rey win over Granada on Wednesday. ""I remember the call I made to him when I joined Barca,"" said Koeman. ""I told him I had a lot of confidence in him. I know he was not as effective at the beginning as he has been lately. ""But I never had my doubts about him and he is self-critical. He is important and he has always worked hard to get back and find his best. You can't ask for more"". Griezmann is among a number of players to have regained form, with his France teammate Ousmane Dembele also enjoying a resurgence. ""I don't know what has happened in previous years but he has improved a lot physically,"" said Koeman. ""He's great, he goes one-on-one, he's fast. I love this player. He is very involved, he is very happy and we have to continue like this."" Koeman confirmed Sergi Roberto is out with a thigh strain and will miss the Champions League first leg against Paris Saint-Germain later this month."
7,03/02/2021,23:43,Griezmann double inspires Barca cup comeback against Granada,Antoine Griezmann led Barcelona back from the brink on Wednesday as the Catalans beat Granada 5-3 after extra-time to win a riveting cup tie and reach the Copa del Rey semi-finals.,"Barca looked set to crash out at Los Carmenes when Granada led 2-0 with two minutes of normal time remaining but Griezmann scored one goal in the 88th minute and then set up Jordi Alba for a dramatic equaliser in the 92nd. Griezmann then headed his team in front in extra-time only for Granada's Fede Vico to make it 3-3 with a penalty. Yet Frenkie de Jong's finish and a thumping volley from Alba, also set up by Griezmann, sent a relieved Barcelona through."
8,02/02/2021,13:39,Supporters groups dismiss 'dangerous' European Super League plan,"Plans to create a breakaway European Super League for an elite group of the continent's wealthiest clubs have been dismissed as ""unpopular, illegitimate, and dangerous"" by a collective of supporters groups.","""It would destroy the European model of sport, which is based on commonly accepted principles such as sporting merit, promotion and relegation, qualification to European competitions via domestic success, and financial solidarity,"" said a statement released on the initiative of Football Supporters Europe (FSE) and signed by more than 100 groups of supporters of club sides and national teams. ""It would also undermine the economic foundations of European football, concentrating even more wealth and power in the hands of a dozen or so elite clubs,"" the statement added. Among the signatories were Liverpool's Spirit of Shankly Supporters' Union as well as groups from Arsenal, Chelsea, Manchester City, Manchester United, Tottenham Hotspur, Paris Saint-Germain, Bayern Munich, Borussia Dortmund, Atletico Madrid, Barcelona and Real Madrid. Documents containing details of the Super League, first reported last month by British newspaper The Times, proposed a 20-club tournament with 15 permanent members, including the English Premier League's 'Big Six', three each from Spain and Italy, two from Germany and one from France. Five other clubs would qualify annually, the report said, but founding members would receive up to 350 million euros ($425m) each just to join the competition. At the same time discussions are still ongoing about the future format of the UEFA Champions League, currently the world's most lucrative and prestigious club competition which is due for reform of some kind from 2024 onwards. ""We recognise that the game is in desperate need of broad reform. ""But proposals to this end must seek to revive the competitive balance in European competitions, protect domestic leagues, promote the interests of fans, and encourage fairer revenue distribution,"" the statement added. ""A European Super League would achieve none of these objectives -- quite the opposite."" Javier Tebas, the president of Spain's La Liga, is one of the leading voices against the project, which he insisted is ""not going to happen"" in an interview with AFP at the weekend. ""The whole system will be against it and it won't just sit on its hands. It's going to fight,"" said Tebas, who also accused FIFA chief Gianni Infantino of supporting the plan, which he says has been driven by Real Madrid president Florentino Perez, as well as the American owners of Liverpool, Manchester United and AC Milan."
9,01/02/2021,15:38,Barcelona presidential rivals insist Messi is worth it,"Two of the candidates in Barcelona's presidential election, Joan Laporta and Victor Font, insisted on Monday that Lionel Messi ""generates more"" than he earns, after his ""colossal"" club contract was published in a Spanish newspaper.","""Leo generates much more income than the money he costs,"" Joan Laporta, who is seeking to regain the presidency, told Rac1 radio. ""We have done a study and he generates a third of Barca's total income."" ""It's not only the economic return,"" Laporta said. ""But also the emotional and sporting return, and the vivid moments he gives us."" Messi is in the last year of his contract. On Sunday, under the headline ""the colossal contract that ruins Barcelona"", El Mundo published details of the current deal, signed in 2017. It said Messi could have earned 555 million euros ($674 million) by the time the deal expires. Barcelona responded by saying it was not the source of the leak and it planned to sue El Mundo. The club did not, however, contradict the details. Laporta is one of three candidates for the election on March 7. One of his rivals, Font, spoke on Onda Cero radio. ""To imply that Barca is ruined because of Messi is an absolutely erroneous conclusion,"" he said. Both candidates condemned the ""leak"" to the Madrid newspaper and both promised they would do everything to keep Messi at Barca. ""We have to do everything possible to keep Messi, in 2017 and today too,"" said Font. Laporta, the president when Messi first broke into the Barcelona team, agreed. ""I will do everything possible to keep Messi at Barca. I have had signals that he is happy in Barcelona, that he wants to stay."""
10,01/02/2021,14:47,"Messi fuels Barcelona revival, Marseille violence, Poch beaten: Talking points from around Europe","Lionel Messi kept up his improved form in La Liga as Barcelona won again amid more controversy about the Catalans' finances, while there was drama on and off the field in France and the Milan clubs continue to fight it out at the top of Serie A.","AFP Sport rounds up some of the main talking points from across the continent: Barcelona have said they will take legal action against Spanish newspaper El Mundo after it published details at the weekend of Lionel Messi's current contract, which it says is worth up to 555 million euros ($674 million) over four years. El Mundo called it the ""colossal contract that ruins Barcelona"", just as the Catalans are wrestling with a dire financial situation, worsened by the pandemic, and with Messi's future currently up in the air. Yet the Argentine underlined his value to Barca by scoring a superb free-kick in their 2-1 win over Athletic Bilbao. Barca are unbeaten in 10 n La Liga, winning eight, with Messi scoring eight times in that run. However, both Barcelona and Real Madrid are 10 points behind leaders Atletico Madrid, who beat Cadiz 4-2 and still boast a game in hand. Marseille's weekend game against Rennes in Ligue 1 was postponed after angry supporters attacked the club's training ground, while the players were there, in what was called ""a frenzy of unjustifiable violence"". Local police said 25 arrests were made and seven officers were injured after several hundred Ultras stormed La Commanderie in a protest against the club leadership and the team's poor recent run of results. Marseille's owner, the American tycoon Frank McCourt, called the protestors ""thugs"" and likened the incidents to last month's storming of the US Congress. The growing crisis comes with the former Champions League winners having slumped to ninth in Ligue 1 and after coach Andre Villas-Boas indicated he will leave at the end of the season. On the pitch in France, the title race is hotting up after reigning champions Paris Saint-Germain suffered their first defeat under new coach Mauricio Pochettino, conceding at the death to lose 3-2 at struggling Lorient despite Neymar scoring two penalties. It was a fifth defeat in Ligue 1 this season for PSG, who are third, three points behind leaders Lille. Lille beat Dijon 1-0, while Lyon are two points off top spot in second after scoring late to beat Bordeaux 2-1. It could even become a four-way fight. Monaco are six points off the lead after winning their last five games. Bayern Munich maintained their seven-point lead at the top of the German Bundesliga by beating Hoffenheim 4-1 as Robert Lewandowski scored his 24th goal of the league campaign. After a mini slump, the Bavarians have now four on the bounce and remain well clear of nearest rivals RB Leipzig. The result against Hoffenheim also allowed Hansi Flick's side to exact perfect revenge for their 4-1 defeat away to the same opponents in September, in what was their only loss in 46 matches in all competitions across a remarkable 2020. The only cloud on Bayern's weekend came as midfielder Corentin Tolisso was dropped and fined for getting a tattoo, therefore falling foul of Covid-19 quarantine regulations. Zlatan Ibrahimovic's spat with Romelu Lukaku dominated the headlines last midweek as Inter beat AC Milan in their Coppa Italia derby. On Saturday Ibrahimovic missed a penalty for the fourth time this season but Ante Rebic followed up to score and Franck Kessie later netted another spot-kick as Milan won 2-1 at Bologna. That result kept the Rossoneri two points clear of Inter at the top of Serie A, as Antonio Conte's side beat Benevento 4-0 with Lukaku scoring a brace at San Siro. The Belgian is on 14 league goals for the season and Inter remain best-placed to overhaul Milan, even if Roma, Juventus, Lazio and Napoli all also won at the weekend."
11,31/01/2021,23:09,Messi shows his worth but Atletico stretches lead,Lionel Messi underlined his worth to Barcelona by scoring a sensational free-kick on Sunday but Atletico Madrid are in charge of La Liga after beating Cadiz to stand 10 points clear at the top of the table.,"Messi's stunning effort in a 2-1 win over Athletic Bilbao had been matched by the Argentinian's friend and former team-mate Luis Suarez, who earlier curled in a superb free-kick of his own in Atletico's 4-2 victory over Cadiz. Atletico end the weekend even further ahead after Real Madrid's defeat by Levante on Saturday, which means Zinedine Zidane's side are now level with Barca on points, both of them struggling to keep pace in the title race. ""Every game is an important step towards reaching the goal we set ourselves at the start of the season,"" said Diego Simeone. ""We have to keep pushing each other."" Barca's win at least maintains their momentum while Messi's 650th club goal may have carried extra satisfaction for the Argentinian, who had the details of his contract published in the Spanish newspaper El Mundo on Saturday night. El Mundo claimed the deal signed by Messi in 2017 shows he could earn up to 555 million euros over its four years, describing it as ""the colossal contract that ruined Barcelona"". ""Someone has done it with bad intentions to cause problems,"" said Ronald Koeman. ""You have to respect a player who has given so much to Spanish football and to this club. I didn't have any doubts that it wouldn't affect him on the pitch."" Few can argue with Messi's contribution in that regard, with the 33-year-old showing against Bilbao why the club have gone to such lengths to keep him. Bilbao briefly drew level through a Jordi Alba own-goal early in the second half but Antoine Griezmann's strike secured Barca their third consecutive victory, with Ousmane Dembele and Frenkie de Jong both impressive again. Asked what Messi worth is to the team, Griezmann said: ""What a question, we are enjoying him, he is a legend. I hope we can keep enjoying him for many more years."" But Barcelona continue to be haunted by the spectre of Suarez, whose tremendous free-kick and then a penalty helped Atletico push their advantage into double figures. While Messi's free-kick was closer and bent perfectly into the top right-hand corner, Suarez's shot was further out and hit harder, a fizzing effort that curled into the left side of the net. ""The other day they were practising free-kicks,"" said Simeone. ""I told him we had not seen him score many goals from free-kicks so that's why I smiled when I saw him score this one."" ""After spending so long at Barca with Messi, it was difficult,"" added Suarez. He was the driving force again, his two goals making it nine in his last eight games and 14 now for the season. His goals and assists have now earned Atletico 12 extra points in the league, with Barcelona's decision to let him leave, especially for title rivals, seeming more misjudged by the week. It could get even worse for them and Real Madrid, given Simeone's side still have a game in hand over each of them. Both would have been given hope by a rousing display from newly-promoted Cadiz, who were inspired by the relentless Alvaro Negredo. The 35-year-old scored twice, could have had a hat-trick and certainly did not deserve to be on the losing side. But Suarez's double, between goals from Saul Niguez and Koke late on, sealed another three points for Atletico, who now have the La Liga crown within reach, even with half of the season left to play."
12,31/01/2021,16:08,Barcelona to sue over claims Messi contract worth 555 million euros,"Barcelona will take legal action against the Spanish newspaper El Mundo after it published details on Sunday of Lionel Messi's current contract, which it says is worth up to 555 million euros ($674 million) over four years.","Barca responded by also insisting they were not responsible for the leak, although the club did not deny the details of the report. El Mundo say the deal signed by Messi in 2017 is the ""largest in the history of sport"" and called it the ""colossal contract that ruins Barcelona"". The 33-year-old could end up collecting a maximum of 555,237,619 euros before it expires on June 30 this year, if all conditions were met. With six months left of the deal to run, ""the player has already earned 511,290,052 euros, almost 92 per cent of the possible total"", the report claims. The leak comes as Barcelona are wrestling with a dire financial situation, worsened by the pandemic, and with Messi's future still up in the air, given the striker can leave the club for free this summer. ""In view of the information published today in the newspaper El Mundo, in relation to the professional contract signed between FC Barcelona and the player Lionel Messi, the club regrets its publication given that it is a private document governed by the principle of confidentiality between the parties,"" said Barcelona in a statement. ""FC Barcelona categorically denies any responsibility for the publication of this document, and will take appropriate legal action against the newspaper El Mundo, for any damage that may be caused as a result of this publication. ""FC Barcelona expresses its absolute support for Lionel Messi, especially in the face of any attempt to discredit his image, and to damage his relationship with the club where he has worked to become the best player in the world and in football history."" According to the report, Messi earned 115 million euros just for signing the contract in 2017 and among his potential bonuses is a 3,548,644-euro reward for winning the Champions League and 2,365,766 euros for winning La Liga, El Mundo claims. His club contract dwarfs those of the other top earners in global sport. Patrick Mahomes, the Kansas City Chiefs quarterback, last year signed the biggest contract in North American sport, worth a minimum of 450 million dollars, but it is 10 years long. Cristiano Ronaldo's contract with Juventus is worth a reported 30 million euros a year, but bonuses may have taken it up to 70 million euros last season. Ronaldo also earns more from endorsements than Messi. Messi is set to decide in the coming months whether he wants to stay at Barcelona or leave the club he joined as a 13-year-old and where he has become arguably the greatest player of all time. Frustrated with Barca's decline in recent years, the Argentinian also feels unfairly blamed for worsening performances on the pitch. Manchester City and Paris Saint-Germain are the favourites to sign Messi if he chooses to leave."
13,29/01/2021,10:29,Odegaard and Puig symptomatic,Riqui Puig scored his first goal for Barcelona against Elche last weekend after being circled as one of the world's most exciting talents almost a decade ago.,"In 2014, the Barcelona newspaper Mundo Deportivo revelled in the 14-year-old born in Catalonia, who knew Xavi Hernandez personally and might even one day play like him. ""He's a great little footballer,"" the Catalan newspaper wrote. ""He plays between the lines and he's got fantastic talent. Just as fantastic as his personality."" In the same year, Martin Odegaard, only a year older than Puig, was already representing Norway and being shown around Real Madrid's training ground, not because he had joined them but because they were trying to persuade him to. ""Martin Odegaard is 15 years old and already tired,"" wrote Marca. ""Of hearing offers from all the big clubs in Europe."" And yet seven years later, Puig was being substituted on Wednesday by Ronald Koeman with Barca 1-0 down to Rayo Vallecano in the Copa del Rey. Odegaard was being shown around another training ground this week, this time in Hertfordshire in England, where he joined Arsenal on loan. ""Martin has been playing at the top level for a while,"" read Arsenal's statement. Puig, now 21, is staying to fight for his place while Odegaard, 22, has opted for a fresh start but both have been sidelined by their coaches, despite hopes they would be key as their clubs look to the future. The disappointment has created tension, with Koeman increasingly agitated by what he sees as too hard a push for Puig to be in his team. ""It's as if I have a problem with him and that is not the case,"" said Koeman. ""It's not good for me or for Riqui."" Zidane's future is in doubt, in part because he refuses to embrace the club's vision for the future, which has Odegaard at its heart. ""You have to prove yourself with the competition there is here, which is fierce,"" said Zidane. ""You have to show it."" Which begs the question, have they shown enough? And have they been given the chance to? After a decade of dominance in Europe, Barcelona and Real Madrid are at the end of an cycle, both facing up to a need to change while also unsure how to implement it. Zidane was brought back to clear up the mess in 2019 while Koeman was perceived as someone able to begin the transition. But neither can afford to wait for Puig and Odegaard to live up to the hype. Their jobs depend on results, particularly while their teams are struggling, adrift in La Liga and no longer considered elite in the Champions League. Atletico Madrid are looking to extend a seven-point lead over Real Madrid when they play away at Cadiz on Sunday. And with stadiums still empty, the feel-good factor of a favourite like Puig playing in front of fans is gone too. When he slaloms through, there is no surge of support in the stands. When he is substituted, there are no complaints either. It is possible Puig and Odegaard are not quite good enough, that both will have distinguished careers, but elsewhere, where the demands are less intense. In their positions, particularly, Barca and Madrid only accept the best. And yet the stagnation also points to the awkwardness of Spain's two biggest clubs ushering out the old and bringing in the new. Odegaard may be the future but few would argue he should be playing ahead of Luka Modric against Levante on Saturday. Puig might be an expert passer but at what cost would it be to Barca's solidity in Sunday's game against Athletic Bilbao? Where Koeman has promoted youth it has often been through necessity, Ronald Araujo impressing at centre half, Sergino Dest filling a void at right back, Pedri dazzling in attacking midfield. But for those not quite ready, expectation is not only discarded but perhaps detrimental, the need for patience even less appealing to coaches focused on averting crisis. Instead, Odegaard has gone and Puig stays but both remain in limbo, years on from when the excitement first began to build, still waiting for their moment to come. Fixtures (all times GMT)"
14,27/01/2021,23:19,Messi marks return with goal as Barca come from behind to beat Rayo,Lionel Messi marked his return from suspension with a goal in the Copa del Rey on Wednesday as Barcelona survived a scare against Rayo Vallecano to reach the quarter-finals.,"With Real Madrid and Atletico Madrid already out, another upset looked on the cards when Fran Garcia gave Rayo a surprise lead at Vallecas early in the second half. But Messi tapped in Antoine Griezmann's pass to equalise before turning creator, sending Jordi Alba through, with Frenkie de Jong at the back post to seal a 2-1 victory. Rayo sit fourth in Segunda, Spain's second tier, after being relegated from the top flight in 2019, with their fans and players at loggerheads with the club's president Raul Martin Presa amid the club's decline. A victory over Barcelona, 30-time winners of the competition and now strong favourites to make it 31, would have delivered a brief boost to morale, even if this compelling cup tie never had the tension it deserved without the ground's usually raucous fans. Still, Barcelona coach Ronald Koeman will be relieved to have made it to the quarter-finals and to see Messi on target again, the Argentinian taking his tally for the season to 15 goals. Messi had sat out the previous two games suspended after being sent off in the Spanish Super Cup final defeat by Athletic Bilbao but looked refreshed and ultimately made the difference again. There were less positive outings for Riqui Puig, Francisco Trincao and Junior Firpo, who all missed an opportunity to impress Koeman, who promptly whisked all three off after Rayo took the lead. Koeman was full of praise for De Jong. ""He's a more complete player now. As well as building from behind, his ability to arrive in the box at the right moments is helping us to create and above all score goals,"" said the Barcelona coach. ""We are still in the cup and we are recovering our level in the league. We have to keep going."" In the last eight, Barca join Sevilla, who had earlier made light work of struggling Valencia. Valencia were beaten 3-0, their focus now on avoiding relegation from La Liga. Real Betis, Villarreal and Levante also progressed on Tuesday. Barca hit the woodwork twice in the first half. De Jong flicked a finish onto the crossbar and Puig struck the post after Trincao's shot spilled out. Messi was collecting the ball from deep and driving through midfield but both he and the weaving Puig were often frustrated by a committed and aggressive Rayo defence. Rayo rode their luck too, another effort grazing the crossbar early in the second half, this time from Messi, who opted to curl a free-kick towards the top corner from wide on the right. But Rayo survived and when their first chance came, they took it. Breaking at speed, the ball was played wide to Alvaro Garcia, who stopped and then went again, leaving Clement Lenglet for dead. His fired cross was fumbled by Neto, with Fran Garcia in the right place for a tap-in. Koeman responded by throwing Jordi Alba, Pedri and Ousmane Dembele on for Puig, Firpo and Trincao. Alba pulled back for Pedri and then De Jong threaded through Griezmann, who looked up and gave Messi an open goal at the back post. The substitutes took Barca to a different gear and 10 minutes later, the comeback was complete as Messi clipped a spinning ball over the top for Alba to run onto and he slid a pass for De Jong to score his fourth goal in seven games."
15,26/01/2021,19:45,Barcelona sets March 7 for delayed presidential election,"Barcelona on Tuesday announced March 7 as the intended date for the football club's delayed presidential election and will, for the first time, allow postal voting.","The vote was originally scheduled for January 24 but postponed in the face of increased Covid-19 restrictions in Spain. The regional government in Catalonia has since modified the law governing votes at sports clubs to allow a postal ballot. The club said that members over the age of 65 would also be able to vote from home. The club had originally planned to set up polling stations across Spain and Andorra but said on Tuesday that ""the forecast that the current restrictions on various territories of the state will be maintained until the date of the elections, makes it impossible."" The club said five polling sites will be open in Catalonia and one in Andorra for members who want to vote in person. The three candidates to succeed Josep Maria Bartomeu, are Victor Font, Toni Freixa and former club president Joan Laporta. Bartomeu resigned last October. Since then, the club has been run by a management team presided over by Carles Tusquets."
16,26/01/2021,19:21,Koeman recalls Messi to cup squad and says players can ignore Barca money woes,"Barcelona coach Ronald Koeman said on Tuesday that he did not think his players were distracted by the club's financial problems and called for ""focus"" when they visit Rayo Vallecano in the cup.","Koeman has recalled Lionel Messi to the squad for Wednesday's round-of-16 trip to second-division Rayo after a two-match ban for a red card in the Spanish Super Cup final loss. Koeman told a press conference that the Argentine was ""looking forward to it"" but refused to say if Messi would start. ""Leo is very keen to play and to win things, he is used to winning trophies, he is a winning player and wants to be in every game, tomorrow when we get there I will announce the team,"" said Koeman, adding that the ban has allowed Messi to rest. ""He's in good spirits, fresh, not bothered, to win things we need a fit Messi."" Barca released their financial report for the 2019/2020 season on Monday, which revealed debts of 1.173 billion euros ($1.426 billion) including 730.6 million euros is short term, much of it outstanding instalments on player transfers. Local media have reported that Barcelona have postponed to February the payment of player wages originally scheduled for December. ""I don't know if it's true, sometimes things come out in the press that are not true, I have to ask about it,"" Koeman told a news conference. He said the squad were concentrating on football. ""I've seen them focused on our work and I haven't seen them worried about this issue,"" said Koeman. Barcelona needed extra time to eliminate third-tier Cornella in the previous round, the night after Real Madrid had been eliminated by another Segunda B club, Alcoyano. ""We're playing a complicated game, against a complicated team and we have to be good, very focused and in the game to get through,"" Koeman said. ""We have to work hard, put in the intensity and hopefully we can win without any problems,"" said Koeman."
17,22/01/2021,16:02,Barcelona appeal against Messi two-game ban rejected: source,"Barcelona's appeal against Lionel Messi's two-match ban following his sending-off in the Spanish Super Cup final was rejected on Friday, sources from the Spanish Football Federation told AFP.","It means the Argentine will not be able to play for Barcelona in Sunday's game away at Elche in La Liga. Messi served the first match of his suspension as the Catalans won 2-0 in extra time away to near neighbours Cornella, of Spain's third-tier Segunda B division, on Thursday in the Copa del Rey. He was sent off late in extra time in Sunday's Super Cup final in Seville against Athletic Bilbao, which Barcelona lost 3-2. Messi saw the first red card of his Barcelona career, on his 753rd appearance, for lashing out at Athletic's Asier Villalibre."
18,22/01/2021,00:42,Koeman says Barca 'not serious' after missing two penalties in cup win,Ronald Koeman criticised his Barcelona players for missing two penalties on Thursday as they needed extra time to end the cup run of third-division side Cornella and reach the Copa del Rey last 16.,"Goals from Ousmane Dembele and Martin Braithwaite in extra time sealed a 2-0 victory for Barca but only after Miralem Pjanic and Dembele had both failed to score penalties in normal time. Pjanic and Dembele join a list of five Barcelona players to have missed penalties this season, along with Lionel Messi, Antoine Griezmann and Braithwaite. ""I don't understand because normally there are enough players who can score penalties,"" said Barca coach Koeman. ""Maybe they are scary, I don't know. Several players have failed and, above all, if you score one of the two penalties, you calm down. ""You cannot miss two penalties as Barca players. It's not serious."" Barca were looking for a reaction on the back of their shock loss to Athletic Bilbao in the Spanish Super Cup final on Sunday, when Messi was sent off for the club for the first time. With Messi suspended, a rotated line-up laboured to victory after a third consecutive extra-time in eight days. Pjanic missed the first penalty in the 39th minute after Ronald Araujo went down under a high foot from Albert Estelles, Cornella goalkeeper Ramon Juan diving low to his right. Griezmann and Braithwaite both failed to finish early in the second half and then Griezmann blazed over on the volley after a clever free-kick from Pjanic. Another penalty presented a golden opportunity in the 80th minute after another Estelles error, this time a handball. Dembele stepped up but the result was the same, his driven effort down the middle again kept out by Ramon Juan. Cornella, who beat Atletico Madrid in the previous round, saw their resistance last only two minutes into extra time as the power of Dembele's shot from distance was too much for the keeper, who could only divert the ball in off the crossbar. Estelles completed his nightmare night by being sent off before Braithwaite added a second on the counter-attack."
19,20/01/2021,18:07,Koeman hopes Messi's ban will be reduced,Ronald Koeman hopes Lionel Messi's two-match ban will be reduced after he was sent off for the first time ever playing for Barcelona in the Spanish Super Cup final defeat by Athletic Bilbao on Sunday.,"Koeman also responded on Wednesday to Paris Saint-Germain sporting director Leonardo claiming Messi was on their wish list, by saying he would be interested in PSG's Neymar and Kylian Mbappe too. Messi saw red after swinging an arm at Bilbao's Asier Villalibre towards the end of extra-time, just before Barca went down 3-2 in Seville. The 33-year-old is now due to miss the trip to Cornella in the Copa del Rey on Thursday and Sunday's La Liga game away to Elche, but Barca have submitted an appeal. ""The club has told me the ban is for two games and the club does not agree and now we'll see,"" said Koeman. ""There is a case to be made and hopefully his sanction will be reduced. If not, we will play two games without Leo."" Messi had been struggling with a thigh problem in the build-up to the final but Koeman said Barcelona's captain is fit again. ""He has trained without problems this morning so that means that he has recovered well from the last game and he is fine for when he has to play after his ban. We wait to see how many games it is,"" said Koeman. Messi's rare act of petulance prompted more speculation about his happiness and future at Barcelona. His contract expires in the summer and Leonardo told France Football this week that ""great players like Messi will always be on PSG's wish list"". When those comments were put to Koeman, he said: ""If they ask me if I'm interested in Neymar and Mbappe, I would also say yes. I don't know what might happen in the future but what we have to do is try to have the best possible squad."" The surprise loss to Athletic Bilbao ended a run of nine games unbeaten for Barcelona and prevented Koeman from lifting his first trophy as the club's coach. ""We were gutted, which is normal, especially on the day of the game and the day after,"" said Koeman. ""But there is no time to wallow because in my opinion we are on a good path and we have to prepare for the game tomorrow."""

""But obviously now is not the time to talk nor to dream about that. ""Yet we are at the top table of those who are following the case closely."" Pochettino played down reports in Spain linking France World Cup winner Kylian Mbappe with a move to Real Madrid. ""I've no doubt about the fact that Kylian loves being in Paris,"" he said."

22,19/01/2021,15:25,Messi banned for two matches,Lionel Messi was banned for two matches on Tuesday following his first ever sending off for Barcelona.,"The Argentine forward was shown a red card at the end of Sunday's 3-2 extra-time defeat to Athletic Bilbao in the Spanish Super Cup final after lashing out at Asier Villalibre. Messi had twice been sent off playing for Argentina, including at the 2019 Copa America, but never in 16 years and 753 matches with Barcelona's first team. The six time Ballon d'Or winner's ban was announced by the Spanish Football Federation with Barca later revealing their intention to appeal the sanction on their star player. Messi shook off a thigh problem to start in Seville and was required to play all 120 minutes as Barca attempted to take the game to penalties. Instead, the 33-year-old lost his temper at the end of a combative contest, reacting to a late challenge from Villalibre by swiping his hands across the back of his opponent. Messi was red-carded 15 years ago for Barca but it was with the reserves in a third division match, according to Spanish statistician Alexis Martin-Tamayo. Messi would miss games against third-tier Cornella away in the Copa del Rey on Thursday and Elche on Sunday in La Liga."
23,18/01/2021,13:46,"Messi sees red, 'fearful' Juventus, PSG back top: Talking points from around Europe","Frustration got the better of Lionel Messi as he saw red in the Spanish Super Cup final, while Inter dealt a major blow to Juventus's Serie A title hopes but Paris Saint-Germain are back on top in France.","AFP Sport rounds up some of the main talking points from across the continent: Lionel Messi was sent off for the first time in 753 appearances for Barcelona at the end of his side's 3-2 extra-time defeat by Athletic Bilbao in the Spanish Super Cup final in Seville, after lashing out at Asier Villalibre in a moment that seemed to encapsulate his recent frustration with his boyhood club. Messi had twice been shown a red card playing for Argentina, including at the 2019 Copa America, but never in more than 16 years with Barcelona, before Sunday. His dismissal came right at the end of extra time, after Athletic had scored a late equaliser to force the additional 30 minutes and then a stunning Inaki Williams strike gave the Basques a 3-2 win and their second Super Cup in six years. Barcelona had hoped to win their first trophy under Ronald Koeman and Messi had been in good form, with four goals in his club's previous two league games. ""Do I excuse him? I'd need to see it again,"" said Koeman of the incident. Andrea Pirlo's hopes of leading Juventus to a 10th straight Serie A title in his first season as a coach took a major knock as the reigning champions lost 2-0 away to Inter, one of the clubs he represented as a player. Arturo Vidal -- a former teammate of Pirlo's at Juve -- and Nicolo Barella scored the goals as Inter, coached by ex-Juventus boss Antonio Conte, moved level on points with leaders AC Milan, who have a game in hand to play on Monday. Juve, who had been on their best run of the season with three straight league wins, are now seven points off top spot. ""We couldn't have put in a worse performance than this,"" said Pirlo, who said his side were ""fearful"" and too defensive. They now play Napoli in the delayed Italian Super Cup on Wednesday. Paris Saint-Germain were without their new coach Mauricio Pochettino for their game at Angers after the Argentine tested positive for Covid-19. But, three days after winning his first trophy in management in the Champions Trophy against Marseille, he watched from afar as PSG ground out a 1-0 win that took them back to the top of Ligue 1. Layvin Kurzawa's goal made the difference, before former leaders Lyon saw their 16-game unbeaten run ended in dramatic fashion in a 1-0 home defeat against Metz. They were denied a late opener by a marginal offside call, and conceded in the 90th minute to Aaron Leya Iseka. Lyon are now third, two points off PSG who lead from Lille on goal difference. Lille beat Reims 2-1 with a last-minute Jonathan David winner. Bayern Munich coach Hansi Flick was facing up to his first mini-crisis in charge as his side lost 3-2 at Borussia Moenchengladbach last weekend and then went out of the German Cup on penalties to second-tier Holstein Kiel. However they got back on track as Thomas Mueller's strike secured a 2-1 win over Freiburg on Sunday to move Bayern four points clear at the top of the Bundesliga from RB Leipzig, who drew 2-2 at Wolfsburg. With Bayer Leverkusen and Borussia Dortmund slipping up as well, it seems doubtful that any of their rivals have the consistency needed to stop Bayern winning a ninth straight title, although there is still a long way to go. Benfica and Porto are Portugal's two most successful clubs and between them have won each of the last 18 league titles. On Friday they played out a 1-1 draw at the Estadio do Dragao, with Moussa Marega cancelling out Alex Grimaldo's opener before the Iranian Mehdi Taremi was sent off for Porto. It was a result that left the two teams level on 32 points from 14 games, and perhaps the big winners were Sporting. Looking for their first title since 2002, they stay four points clear and unbeaten, although they were held 1-1 at home by mid-table Rio Ave. Sporting are due to face Benfica later this month."
24,18/01/2021,00:38,Messi sees red as Bilbao stun Barca to win Spanish Super Cup,"Lionel Messi was sent off for the first time playing for Barcelona as Athletic Bilbao stunned the Catalans to win the Spanish Super Cup on Sunday, a dramatic final finishing 3-2 after extra-time.","Moments before Bilbao's momentous triumph was confirmed, Messi threw an arm at Asier Villalibre, who had earlier scored a 90th-minute equaliser in normal time to deny Barca victory. Antoine Griezmann's double looked to have sealed the trophy but Villalibre intervened before Inaki Williams' fabulous strike three minutes into extra time proved decisive. Messi shook off a thigh problem to start in Seville and was required to play all 120 minutes as Barcelona attempted to take the game to penalties. Instead, the 33-year-old lost his temper at the end of a combative contest, reacting to a late challenge from Villalibre by swiping his hands across the back of his opponent. It meant a first ever red card for Messi in 753 appearances for Barcelona, to go with his two reds for Argentina in 2005 and 2019. ""After so many years in football, Leo knows perfectly well when he is fit to play,"" said Barca coach Ronald Koeman. ""We talked and he said he was in a good place to start. He has survived the game, given the maximum, nothing more."" Messi's anger will take some of the limelight away from Bilbao, who had already denied the competition a Clasico final by beating Real Madrid in the semi on Thursday and now have completed the set. It means a title and the perfect start for Marcelino Garcia Toral, who only took over as coach less than two weeks ago. But there was praise too for his predecessor Gaizka Garitano, who oversaw this team reaching the Copa del Rey final last season, which earned qualification in the first place. ""This is for Gaizka Garitano and his coaching staff as well who brought us here,"" said Williams. Organisers at the Spanish Football Federation might have hoped for the global attraction of a Clasico, especially as the coronavirus pandemic had already kept the tournament in Spain rather than the lucrative Saudi Arabia, where it was played last year. Yet this was a frantic final, with a hugely surprising result. Barca arrived on the back of a nine-game unbeaten run and a trophy, even a minor one, would have turned encouraging signs in recent weeks into more tangible evidence of a revival under Koeman. ""It is not a step back,"" he said ""Always winning titles is helpful to show that we are on the right track, but it is only one game, it is a Super Cup, and we will show in the next few games that we are on the right track."" Bilbao were the better side in the first half, more decisive in possession and more aggressive out of it. But both teams created little for 40 minutes and then in two minutes both had scored. A brilliant pass created each of them, Messi the instigator for Barca. He collected from the right and threaded through for Jordi Alba on the left, whose cut-back was intended for the Argentinian but spilled out to Griezmann, who could not miss. Marcelino hurled his water bottle to the ground in disgust but his team were soon level. Williams played the pass, his clipped ball over the top catching Alba off-guard, with Oscar De Marcos sneaking in and half-volleying home. Raul Garcia thought he had his third goal in four days when he headed in just before the hour but Barca survived. With 10 minutes left, Griezmann struck again, Alba's cross evading the Bilbao defence and finding the Frenchman, who steered in at the front post for what looked like the winner. Instead, Bilbao scored in the 90th minute to send the game to extra-time and then the 93rd to lead for the first time. Villalibre was allowed to volley in from close range but there was little Barca could do about Williams' effort, the striker cutting inside from the left and whipping a tremendous shot into the top right-hand corner. Unai Nunez might have sealed it but failed to connect. Griezmann almost rescued it but fired high on the volley with his right foot. Then Villalibre left a shoulder in on Messi, who reacted, scuttling after his opponent and swinging an arm around the back of his head. Messi and Barca were beaten."
25,16/01/2021,18:47,Koeman hopeful on Messi fitness for Super Cup final,Barcelona coach Ronald Koeman says he is optimistic Lionel Messi will be fit for Sunday's Spanish Super Cup final against Athletic Bilbao after injury forced him to miss the semi-final.,"The Argentina forward was left out of the squad for Wednesday's penalty shootout victory over Real Sociedad after complaining of discomfort during last week's 4-0 La Liga win over Granada. ""He trained on his own yesterday (Friday). We have a session this evening, he wants to train, so we'll see how he feels afterwards and if he wants to play or not,"" Koeman told a news conference on Saturday in Seville. ""Tomorrow morning we'll see how his body reacts to the session, but we have high hopes that he'll be there for the match."" Messi was pictured with strapping on his left thigh as he watched the semi-final from the stands in Cordoba. Barca won 3-2 on penalties following a 1-1 draw after extra time. ""Every player needs to be 100% to start the game, it's not the last game of the season, we still have a lot of games after this one,"" said Koeman. ""The final decision will be the player's."" Messi is the club's leading scorer this season with 14 goals in all competitions, his return to form of late coinciding with Barca's nine-game unbeaten run after a poor start under the Dutchman. ""It's always important to win things to prove that you are on the right track,"" said Koeman. ""It's not the most important title as a player but it's a title. ""Each title you win, it's another line on your list of honours. It's important for the players and for the club."""
26,15/01/2021,15:40,"Barcelona presidential elections postponed due to Covid-19 restrictions, club confirm",Barcelona announced on Friday that the club's presidential elections have been postponed after a rise in coronavirus cases prompted heavy restrictions in the region.,"The elections were set for January 24 but the Catalonian government told the club on Friday morning that exceptions to the rules would not be made to allow people to vote. The delay means Barcelona will not have a new regime in charge for the last week of the January transfer window while Lionel Messi's future is set to remain unresolved for a while longer. Messi's contract expires at the end of June, when he could leave the club for free, having failed in an attempt to secure an exit last summer. A new date has not been set for the elections but the club said in a statement it would ask the Catalonian government to allow people to vote by post. The statement read: ""For its part, the club has understood the impossibility of holding elections on the scheduled date due to mobility restrictions decreed by the Catalan Government in the current context of pandemic, which is why the date of the elections must be delayed. ""In this sense, the club has asked the Catalan Government to evaluate the possibility of modifying the current sports legislation in order to enable voting by post on the new date of the elections, a request that the Government has undertaken to study."" Joan Laporta, Victor Font and Toni Freixa are the three candidates who will stand, after each gained the required number of signatures from club members. Laporta and Font are considered the two favourites to win. Laporta was Barca president between 2003 and 2010, overseeing the appointment of Pep Guardiola as coach and his hugely successful first two years in charge. Laporta also claims to enjoy a close relationship with Messi and insists the Argentinian can be persuaded to stay. Font, meanwhile, has framed himself as the candidate for the future, although he has also been clear Messi signing a new contract would be a priority. Font has been keen to emphasise his close ties with Xavi Hernandez, the club's former midfielder touted as a potential replacement for Ronald Koeman as coach. Laporta, Font and Freixa are bidding to succeed Josep Maria Bartomeu, who brought his turbulent tenure as president to an end in October, following mounting pressure from fans and his public falling out with Messi. After a dismal year on the pitch, Barca fans will hope a new president brings a fresh start but the winning candidate will be constrained by the club's dire financial situation, caused by an enormous wage bill and worsened by the consequences of the pandemic. Shortly before Bartomeu resigned in October, Barcelona had announced losses of 97 million euros for the previous season, with debt more than doubling to 488 million euros. The team are third in La Liga, seven points behind Atletico Madrid, who have two games in hand. An interim board has been led by Carles Tusquets since October. The three candidates will meet with Tusquets later on Friday when a new election schedule could be confirmed."
27,14/01/2021,00:37,Barca reach Spanish Super Cup final after Ter Stegen penalty heroics,"Marc-Andre ter Stegen's heroics ensured Barcelona edged past Real Sociedad on penalties on Wednesday to reach the Spanish Super Cup final, without the injured Lionel Messi.","Messi was watching on as Ter Stegen did his best to fill the void in Cordoba, the goalkeeper immense both in the shoot-out and during normal time, which had finished 1-1. Frenkie de Jong's header was cancelled out by a penalty from Mikel Oyarzabal, who then missed in the shoot-out, one of two crucial saves made by Ter Stegen before 21-year-old Riqui Puig hit the winning shot. ""I wasn't down to take one but we needed one more taker and I stepped forward,"" said Puig. Barca advance to meet either Real Madrid or Athletic Bilbao in the final on Sunday, when Messi is expected to be available again, although coach Ronald Koeman was cautious at full-time. ""We have to wait,"" he said. Koeman's team have a mountain to climb in La Liga's title race but they are improving, now nine games unbeaten and with a trophy in their grasp. This is the second year of the Spanish Super Cup's new format, which has four teams playing each other in a semi-final and final. Athletic Bilbao and Real Sociedad joined after reaching the final of last season's Copa del Rey, which is still to be played, while Barcelona finished runners-up to Madrid in La Liga. Yet while last season's version controversially took place in Saudi Arabia, the pandemic means this year's semis are in Cordoba and Malaga, with the final to be played in Seville. Barca were the better side in the first half but had Ter Stegen to thank for not conceding early as Alexander Isak sped into the area only to see his chipped finish saved by the goalkeeper. It was De Jong's dash to the near post that brought the first goal, an Antoine Griezmann cross hanging just long enough for the midfielder to get there first and direct a superb header in. Yet De Jong gave Real Sociedad a way back just after half-time, the ball striking him on the hand and allowing Oyarzabal to equalise from the spot. Barca nearly pulled ahead instantly as De Jong swivelled in the box, only to take an unnecessary extra touch. Ousmane Dembele fired just wide and Trincao, on as a substitute, also had a chance to win it before the 90 minutes were up. Zaldua unleashed in extra time but Ter Stegen tipped over. Dembele's finish was saved too while Adnan Januzaj poked wide at the end of a brilliant run and then hit the post with a free-kick. Into the shoot-out, and Jon Bautista's first attempt was parried away by Ter Stegen, only for De Jong to hit the post. But Oyarzabal, who had scored earlier from the spot, this time missed, Ter Stegen guessing right again. Dembele scored before Willian Jose struck the post. Miralem Pjanic tucked in and so did Mikel Merino under pressure. Griezmann could have won it but ballooned over before Januzaj converted for 2-2, which left it up to Puig to win it for Barca, the youngster slamming home for a spot in the final."

Barca coach Ronald Koeman said on Tuesday the striker had felt discomfort during his side's 4-0 La Liga win over Granada on Saturday, when he was substituted in the second half. Messi trained on Monday and Tuesday but missed the last session before the match on Wednesday morning. The winner of Barcelona and Real Sociedad will face either Real Madrid or Athletic Bilbao, who play in the other semi-final on Thursday."
29,12/01/2021,16:26,Real Madrid defend Super Cup repatriated from Saudi to storm-hit Spain,"Despite the concerns about a crammed fixture calendar in a season badly impacted by the coronavirus pandemic, Spain is going ahead with its four-team Super Cup this week as Real Sociedad and Athletic Bilbao provide the opposition for Barcelona and Real Madrid.","However, after being taken to Saudi Arabia in January 2020, the Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) is organising this year's version in Andalusia, with the final on Sunday at La Cartuja in Seville. From the shores of the Red Sea back to Spain, which has been battered in recent days by Storm Filomena delivering the country's worst snowfall in decades as well as brutally cold temperatures. Barcelona play Real Sociedad in the first semi-final on Wednesday in Cordoba, before trophy holders Madrid face Athletic Bilbao in Malaga on Thursday, with the winners remaining in southern Spain to contest Sunday's final. All of the games will be behind closed doors. In ordinary times the RFEF would not have given up on its controversial money-spinning Saudi venture, after initially agreeing a 120 million-euro ($146m) three-year deal to play an expanded four-team competition in the Middle Eastern Kingdom. That agreement also included the option of three more years, but the lack of fans allowed in Saudi stadiums led the Federation to renegotiate its contract and bring the tournament back home. The move abroad followed in the footsteps of Italy and France, who have taken their own equivalents of the Super Cup -- between the previous season's league champions and domestic cup winners -- to foreign shores in recent years. This time the competition sees reigning La Liga champions Madrid and runners-up Barcelona joined by the two finalists from last season's Copa del Rey, an all-Basque final which was postponed due to the health crisis and has still not been played. That means current La Liga leaders Atletico Madrid are not involved, while Real will not go into their semi-final in the best shape after a build-up impacted by the winter storm. Zinedine Zidane's team were left stuck in the northern city of Pamplona for three nights due to the weather, leaving on Monday after drawing 0-0 with Osasuna on Saturday in a game which Zidane and his players felt should not have gone ahead. ""We are not puppets who should have to play all the time. We made the effort but we need to think about the travel involved too,"" complained goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois. Instead of returning to the capital, they flew straight to Malaga to prepare for the Super Cup. Athletic, meanwhile, had their game away to Atletico in Madrid postponed because of the snow -- their plane circled the sky awaiting permission to land before being forced to return home. Their hope is to be able to play their Basque neighbours in the final on Sunday before they eventually clash again in the delayed Copa del Rey showpiece. ""We are not used to winning trophies and it would be special and unforgettable,"" admitted their Spanish international centre-back Inigo Martinez. Before that game Barcelona will hope to continue their perfect start to 2021 against a Real Sociedad side who were top of La Liga but have won just one of their last nine league games. ""We are close to a first title of the season and we come into this full of excitement because we are on a good run,"" said Barca midfielder Sergio Busquets. Spanish Super Cup fixtures (2000 GMT)"
30,11/01/2021,12:35,"Messi on form, a new American star and Bayern beaten: Talking points from around Europe","Lionel Messi is bang in form in the new year, Schalke avoided matching the Bundesliga record for the most consecutive games without a win and there was a very rare defeat for Bayern Munich.","AFP Sport rounds up some of the main talking points from across the continent: Lionel Messi looks like a man on a mission at the start of 2021 and what could be his final six months as a Barcelona player. On Saturday he scored twice -- including direct from a free-kick, one of his late-career specialities -- in a 4-0 win at Granada. That followed a masterful double and two shots off the post in a 3-2 midweek victory at Athletic Bilbao. Before that he provided the assist for Frenkie de Jong's winner at Huesca, and Barcelona have won three out of three since the turn of the year, while Messi is now La Liga's top scorer. Maybe it's not too late for Ronald Koeman's side to challenge for the title: they are third, four points behind leaders Atletico Madrid, albeit having played three games more. Matthew Hoppe is the latest young American to break through in the Bundesliga and he is already a hero for Schalke supporters. The California-born 19-year-old, who made his debut in November, had never scored a senior goal before netting a hat-trick -- the first ever for an American in the Bundesliga -- in the 4-0 defeat of Hoffenheim that rescued the Royal Blues from equalling an unwanted record. Their first win since January 17 last year, after 30 games without, prevented them from matching Tasmania Berlin's infamous German top-flight record of 31 games without a victory set in 1965/66. Hoppe has given hope to a whole club, and suddenly Schalke have new cause for optimism as they bid to beat the drop. They are off the bottom, above Mainz, but they remain in the relegation zone. Bayern Munich had begun to look a little less irresistible on a run of eight straight Bundesliga matches in which they had conceded the opening goal. But they had won five and drawn three of those matches. Then on Friday they were 2-0 up away to Borussia Moenchengladbach only to lose 3-2, just their second Bundesliga defeat since losing at the same ground in December 2019. It is a result that keeps the Bundesliga title race very much alive, although Hansi Flick's team have a winnable run of matches upcoming and they remain top, two points clear of RB Leipzig, who lost 3-1 at home to Borussia Dortmund, for whom Erling Braut Haaland scored twice. Third-placed Bayer Leverkusen are four points off the top after drawing 1-1 with Werder Bremen. Three days after a 3-1 home loss to reigning champions Juventus which ended a 27-game unbeaten run in Serie A stretching back to June, AC Milan bounced back to beat Torino 2-0 at San Siro. With second-placed city rivals Inter drawing at Roma, Milan are now three points clear at the top of the table, and remain seven ahead of Juventus, who are fourth but do have a game in hand. Added good news for Milan came with the return of veteran top scorer Zlatan Ibrahimovic as a late substitute for his first appearance since November 22 after injury. The Swede came on for Rafael Leao, who had earlier scored his third goal in five games. Can Zlatan now fire the Rossoneri to their first Scudetto since 2011? Mauricio Pochettino got his first victory as coach of Paris Saint-Germain, a 3-0 defeat of Brest, but it is Lyon who lead halfway through the Ligue 1 season. They claimed the symbolic title of autumn champions after coming back from 2-0 down to draw 2-2 at Rennes on Saturday with Memphis Depay scoring one fine goal before setting up Jason Denayer's equaliser. Rudi Garcia's team are unbeaten in 16 games although both PSG and Lille are just a point behind, and there is a very long way to go. Ensuring Depay stays to see out the remainder of his contract rather than leaving this month will be crucial."
31,09/01/2021,20:47,Messi revival continues as Barca thrash Granada,Lionel Messi is back in form and Barcelona are finding their feet after a 4-0 demolition of Granada on Saturday put them within four points of the top of La Liga.,"Messi scored twice to make it four goals in three matches since the turn of the year and his resurgence has coincided with an upturn for the team too, this victory Barca's third on the bounce. It puts them in sight of league leaders Atletico Madrid, even if Diego Simeone's side now have three games in hand. Atletico's match against Athletic Bilbao earlier on Saturday was postponed due to the snowstorm that has engulfed Spain this weekend. Messi's double, the second a sweetly-struck free-kick, came between two strikes from Antoine Griezmann, who is also enjoying a revival after a disappointing 18 months at Camp Nou. Some had wondered if Messi would ever get back to his best following an underwhelming start to the season but his latest contribution makes him the league's top scorer on 11 goals. After attempting to leave Barcelona last summer, the 33-year-old's recovery always felt dependent on him rediscovering his own motivation and focus. But Barca coach Ronald Koeman deserves credit for the rejuvenation of players like Griezmann, Ousmane Dembele and Frenkie de Jong, all of whom have improved significantly in recent matches. Barcelona's recovery has a long way to run, with unresolved issues on and off the pitch very likely to resurface before the end of the season. Yet Koeman will hope a corner has been turned and at a good time, with the Champions League last 16 tie against Paris Saint-Germain to come next month and a large chunk of the league calendar still remaining. Barca's first goal was fortunate, with Roberto Soldado seemingly surprised to have the ball passed at him by Sergio Busquets. Soldado's lashed clearance saw the ball sliced backwards to Griezmann, who touched and shot past Rui Silva. Griezmann was the instigator for the second goal too, the Frenchman driving forward to the edge of the area before transferring inside to Messi. Messi was given the yard he needed to shift onto his left foot and curl home. Messi made it three from a similar position, just on the edge of the box, this time the ball was stationary. Pedri had been prevented from running into the box and Messi fired the resulting free-kick low, perfectly into the corner. Griezmann made it four, firing in a scooped pass from Dembele on the turn. Messi went off with almost half an hour left, his work already done. Atletico's game at home to Athletic Bilbao was called off, with the snowfall in Madrid on Friday the heaviest since 1971. Bilbao's players were unable to land in the city and returned to Bilbao early on Friday evening. Seville was among the areas spared the awful weather conditions, with Sevilla able to play against Real Sociedad and win a five-goal thriller 3-2. Youssef En-Nesyri grabbed a hat-trick in a frantic match at the Ramon Sanchez Pizjuan, where four goals were scored in the first 14 minutes before En-Nesyri decided it early in the second half. Defeat means Real Sociedad have won only one of their last six matches. They drop to fifth in La Liga, level on points with Sevilla."

33,08/01/2021,03:10,No room for complacency as Atletico's rivals find their rhythm,"Real Madrid have hit their stride and Barcelona are gaining momentum but Atletico Madrid have stayed strong at the top of La Liga, ahead of what could prove a crucial month in the title race.","A surprise loss to third division side Cornella in the Copa del Rey on Wednesday came in stark contrast to Atletico's form in the league, where only defeat to their capital city rivals last month blots an otherwise perfect run of results that stretches back to mid-October. Two narrow victories over Getafe and Alaves last week made it four league victories on the bounce since Atletico's setback at the Alfredo di Stefano stadium, where a hesitant, passive performance offered Madrid reassurance. Atletico had caved when it mattered most and many thought that spelled danger for their prospects longer-term. But while Zinedine Zidane's Madrid have used the derby victory to string together an unbeaten run of eight games, seven of them wins and five with clean sheets, Atletico have also responded. Luis Suarez scored consecutive winners against Getafe and Alaves, his tap-in at Mendizorroza on Sunday prompting the kind of celebrations to suggest his team genuinely believes they can go the distance. ""We have to keep going down this path,"" said coach Diego Simeone. ""The league is complex, there are lots of traps and you have to be constantly prepared, you can't let yourselves relax."" When Madrid last put together a run like this, it was to secure last season's title, as Barcelona wilted with the trophy in sight. Yet Atletico have marched on, even if the last-gasp nature of their win against Alaves, coupled with Wednesday's defeat by Cornella, means there can be no room for complacency this weekend. ""Everyone wants to win and in the second half of the season there is no longer the same calmness,"" Simeone said. ""It will be tougher, with teams fighting to save themselves, to qualify for Europe. You have to stay alert."" Atletico face Athletic Bilbao on Saturday and then Sevilla on Tuesday, two tough games that will again test their mettle, especially as Bilbao will be eager to secure a first win under new coach Marcelino Garcia Toral. Madrid, in contrast, have what appears to be a kind period in front of them. Their next six matches are all against teams currently in the bottom seven of the table, starting at Osasuna on Saturday. When they lost away at Shakhtar Donestsk at the start of December, Zidane was back in the firing line but the Frenchman has reverted to his most trusted players and his side have quickly recovered. Barcelona look rejuvenated too, their 3-2 win over Athletic Bilbao on Wednesday coming after a scintillating performance from Lionel Messi. He scored twice and could have had a hat-trick while the likes of Ousmane Dembele, Pedri, Antoine Griezmann and Frenkie de Jong all contributed to a slick attacking display. It was also enough to rekindle their hope, even if a seven-point deficit behind Atletico, who have two games in hand on both the Catalans and Madrid, still looks a large gap to close. ""There is always a chance,"" said Koeman. ""The season is very long. You can have ups and downs in a season and it may be that a team that is doing very well will suddenly find it difficult."" If Barca can win away at Granada on Saturday, belief will grow. Madrid travel to Osasuna later on Saturday night. Earlier in the day, Sevilla, in sixth, face Real Sociedad in fourth."
34,06/01/2021,23:12,Messi back to his best in Barca win,Lionel Messi was back to his scintillating best on Wednesday as he scored twice in a 3-2 win for Barcelona over Athletic Bilbao in La Liga.,"Barca trailed to an early Inaki Williams strike at San Mames but responded with a slick attacking performance that had Messi at the heart of it. It was Messi's cross that led to Pedri's equaliser and then the Argentinian could have had a hat-trick, only for VAR and the woodwork to intervene. But this was a vintage display from the 33-year-old, perhaps his best of the season so far, at a time when his future at Barcelona remains up in the air. His double helped Barca reduce the gap behind La Liga's leaders Atletico Madrid to seven points, even if Atletico will be hard to catch, given they also have two games in hand. Only a late mistake took some of the shine off Messi's night, a poor pass allowing Iker Muniain to score and make the result look closer than it was. Bilbao had scored in the third minute and the 90th, each time exposing Barcelona's defensive frailties that remain unsolved. Yet in between, Ronald Koeman's team were able to dictate the match and demonstrate why going forward they are still a force to be reckoned with. Pedri was excellent again, his sumptuous backheel for Messi's first goal another indication of the 18-year-old's talent and his understanding with his captain. Ousmane Dembele, meanwhile, enjoyed one of those virtuouso nights where his speed, invention and confidence made him look every bit like one of the world's most exciting players. Bilbao were playing their first game under new coach Marcelino Garcia Toral, who led Valencia to win the last completed Copa del Rey by beating Barca in the final. He was springing off the bench and clenching his fists in the third minute after Williams raced in behind, touching inside the scrambling Clement Lenglet before driving home. But Barcelona were invigorated. Sergino Dest should have scored after a neat exchange between Messi and Antoine Griezmann before Pedri did, Messi's looping cross to the back post cushioned back across for Pedri to nod in. Dembele was almost unplayable, drifting inside one minute and darting forward the next but it was Pedri's vision that created Barca's second. Messi sent him through, the youngster cutting inside before seeing Messi behind him. Pedri backheeled, wrongfooting the Bilbao defence and goalkeeper, with Messi sliding in the finish. Griezmann was denied after more good work by Dembele while Messi had a goal ruled out and then nicked the crossbar with a curling effort from distance. Bilbao were still in it and might have equalised early in the second half, with the lively Williams and Raul Garcia both going close. Yet their hopes were dashed just after the hour when Messi struck again. He sent the ball wide to Griezmann via Pedri and when the pass came to the near post Messi was there to stroke in off the crossbar. Messi could have had his hat-trick but hit the post again when Dembele's cross was dummied by Griezmann before a misplaced Messi pass allowed Muniain to pull one back for Bilbao. It was Messi's first mistake of the night."

""FC Barcelona and Getafe CF have reached an agreement for the loan of the player Carles Alena until the end of the 2020/21 season,"" Barca said in a statement. Alena has long been circled as a potential star of the future after coming through at Barca's La Masia youth academy but he has been unable to establish himself in the first team. He failed to make much of an impression during a loan spell at Real Betis last season and has made only five appearances for Barca this term under new coach Ronald Koeman. The Spaniard scored on his debut in the Copa del Rey in November 2016. ""Alena is a player for the future that has to play,"" said Koeman on Tuesday. ""He has decided to look for an exit."""

The pressure is already mounting on Koeman, whose future could become more uncertain when the club's new president is voted in later this month. Asked when his methods will deliver better performances, Koeman said: ""Little by little we are going to see it. We have tried to take the team forward and to prepare them for the championship but we have important players out injured and I have a squad I have not been able to change much. I need more time to impose my ideas."" Koeman confirmed midfielder Carles Alena will be allowed to leave, with the 23-year-old expected to join Getafe on loan. But there are not likely to be many arrivals this month at Camp Nou, given the club's perilous financial situation. ""Every coach, every January is thinking about how they can improve their team,"" said Koeman. ""I have made a plan of ins and outs. If it is possible or not depends on the club. If not, we continue with what we have."" Barcelona had to postpone training on Tuesday after two members of staff had tested positive for coronavirus. Another round of tests was carried out on Tuesday morning but the club reported no further positive cases and training went ahead on Tuesday evening. ""We were calm,"" said Koeman. ""There are things in life it is not possible to control."" Barca will be up against an Athletic Bilbao side playing their first game under new coach Marcelino Garcia Toral, the former Valencia boss appointed on Sunday after the sacking of Gaizka Garitano. Bilbao sit ninth in La Liga, having won only six of their 17 league games this term. ""When you get the chance at a great club like Athletic, you have to answer quickly,"" said Marcelino on Tuesday. ""Any football man knows what this club means in this league. It is an exciting project."""

Messi has been free to negotiate with other clubs since Friday. But, as Laporta pointed out, the Barcelona star said in an interview on Spanish television on December 27 that he had ""decided nothing"" about his future. ""I don't know yet,"" Messi said. ""I'm focused. I'm not thinking about how the season is going to end."" Messi has spent his entire career at Barcelona and made his first-team debut during Laporta's first presidency. Laporta called Messi's wait-and-see approach ""positive"", although the Argentine star said in the interview that ""the club is going through a difficult time"" and that it would be ""complicated to bring it back to the level it was at"". Tired of a club in perpetual crisis with three coaches in the space of a year and disappointing results, such as the humiliating 8-2 defeat to Bayern Munich in the Champions League in August, Messi asked to leave the club at the end of last season before changing his mind. Laporta is one of nine candidates to replace Josep Maria Bartomeu, who resigned in October three months before his presidential term was due to end. The vote is on January 24. Under Laporta the club won 12 trophies including four La Liga titles and two Champions Leagues. Laporta said his experience gives him an ""advantage"". ""I have credibility with Leo,"" Laporta said. ""He has always told me that everything I promised him has come true. He knows that if I give my word, I keep it."" Among his opponents for the Barca presidency are Emili Rousaud and Toni Freixa, former members of the club's board of directors, Jordi Farre, the promoter of the motion of censure that pushed Bartomeu towards the exit, and Victor Font, who is standing alongside former Catalan playmaker Xavi Hernandez."

Karim Benzema has been the driving force behind Real's excellent December run, claiming key goals in wins over Athletic Bilbao, Eibar and Granada after securing the club a spot in the Champions League knockout phase. Eden Hazard is also in line to feature after recovering from his latest injury setback. The Belgian was an unused substitute in last week's victory over Granada and has made just three league starts this campaign. Real coach Zinedine Zidane hopes the short festive break afforded to his players over Christmas will not interrupt the momentum built over a domestic five-game winning streak. ""We're going to keep working hard. We have an awful lot of games, we should be pleased with what we're doing,"" said Zidane. ""We're going to lose games again, but we're going to try to win as many as possible. From time to time it's inevitable."" Atletico have responded well to the 2-0 defeat by Real earlier this month that snapped their 26-match unbeaten league run. However, the loss of Kieran Trippier is a substantial blow to a defence that has conceded just five goals in 13 matches, easily the fewest in the division. The England defender, an ever-present for Atletico in La Liga and Europe this term, was recently hit with a 10-week ban for breaching betting rules and will be unavailable until March. The club is said to be considering an appeal. Diego Costa has reportedly asked to terminate his contract for family reasons, having just returned from a blood clot that sidelined the Brazil-born Spain international for a month. Joao Felix is expected to return after missing the 2-0 win at Real Sociedad, although the Portuguese star hasn't scored in the league since November 7. Barcelona will bid to end a turbulent 2020 on a winning note at home to Eibar, but Ronald Koeman's side will be without Lionel Messi after the Argentine was granted an extended break as he recovers from an ankle knock. The six-time Ballon d'Or winner admitted his aborted departure in the summer had affected him at the start of the season, but stressed he felt ""excited"" to play under Koeman. ""Barca is my life, I'm in love with the club. And the city, my children were born here,"" Messi said in an interview with Spanish TV channel La Sexta broadcast on Sunday. ""I feel good right now, ready to fight for everything."" The Celta Vigo forward, the leading Spanish scorer in La Liga three of the past four years, has inspired a turnaround at Balaidos after the team won just one of their first 10 matches. The 33-year-old Aspas, who in November became the club's all-time leading scorer in the top flight, has netted eight times in 15 appearances this term and led Celta back into the top half following four wins in five games before Christmas. Much like with Real and Benzema, who is level at the top of the scoring charts with Aspas, Celta's success in 2021 could heavily rely on the former Liverpool attacker. 500 - Diego Simeone will take charge of his 500th match as Atletico boss against Getafe on Wednesday. He has won 300 games since his appointment in December 2011. 35 - Lionel Messi has been involved in more La Liga goals than any other player this year. The Argentine has scored 19 times and provided 16 assists. 9 - the number of games without a win for Real Sociedad across all competitions. Two weeks ago the Basques held top spot, but three successive defeats have dropped Imanol Alguacil's side six points off the pace."
44,28/12/2020,15:13,Messi says Barca 'my life' but stays tight-lipped on future,"Lionel Messi remained coy on his future at Barcelona in a long interview broadcast on Sunday in which he called the Catalan giants ""my life"".","Speaking to Spanish TV channel La Sexta, Messi insisted that he was ""excited"" to play under coach Ronald Koeman this season despite trying to leave the club where he has played his entire senior career last summer. He said that at the time he felt like he ""needed a change"", but his attempted exit was blocked amid a spat with former Barca president Josep Maria Bartomeu. Messi's contract expires at the end of the season and from next month he will be free to negotiate a move away from Catalonia. ""Barca is my life, I'm in love with the club. And the city, my children were born here,"" Messi said in an interview conducted earlier this month. ""It's true I had a bad time in the summer. It came from everything that happened before the summer, how the season ended, the burofax (how Messi communicated his desire to leave), all of that. ""I carried that into the start of the season a little bit."" Bartomeu stepped down in October and a new Barcelona president will be elected on January 24, after which 33-year-old Messi is expected to begin talks over whether to extend his career-long stay. ""I feel good right now, ready to fight for everything. I feel excited,"" he said. Messi said he is under no illusions over the position Barca find themselves in, with the financial problems exacerbated by the coronavirus pandemic likely to hamper player recruitment. ""I know the club is going through a difficult period and that makes everything surrounding Barcelona difficult, but I am motivated,"" he said. He described Barca's situation as ""really bad"" and poured scorn on the idea that Neymar could make a shock return to Catalonia. ""To do that you need money, and there is no money. Neymar would cost a lot,"" Messi said. Much of the talk surrounding Messi's departure centred around the possibility he might reunite with Pep Guardiola at Manchester City, although there are also reports of him potentially lining up alongside Neymar at Paris Saint-Germain. Messi won three La Liga titles and two Champions Leagues in his four seasons under Guardiola, and was full of praise for his former boss. ""Pep has something special. He makes you see things in one way: how he prepares for matches, defensively, how to attack,"" he said. ""He told you exactly how the match was going to be, how you had to attack to win."""

Messi has already missed two matches for Barca in December, as he sat out their Champions League fixtures at Dynamo Kiev and Ferencvaros. Messi has played 18 times this season for the five-time European champions, scoring 10 times. His last goal, the third in a 3-0 win at Real Valladolid on Wednesday, took the Argentine past Pele for the number of goals scored for one club. His strike in the 65th minute took him to 644 goals, one more than the number Brazilian icon Pele scored for Santos. After a troubling start to the campaign Barca have taken 10 points from their last four games and sit fifth in La Liga. However Ronald Koeman's side find themselves eight points behind league leaders Atletico Madrid, with Barca having also played one game more."
46,23/12/2020,13:47,"Messi's record untouchable, predicts Lineker","Lionel Messi's all-time goalscoring record for one club will never be broken, former England and Barcelona forward Gary Lineker has predicted.","Messi beat Pele's record of 643 goals for one club when he scored Barcelona's third goal, and the 644th of his Barca career, in the 3-0 win against Valladolid on Tuesday. Records are there to be broken, as Messi has proved, but Lineker says this one is untouchable. ""To beat Messi's 644 goal record, someone will have to score an average of 43 goals a season for 15 years....for one club,"" Lineker, now a BBC presenter, tweeted alongside an incredulous icon. ""This is a record that no one thought would ever be beaten. It will never be beaten again."" The 33-year-old Argentina star rewrote the history books on Tuesday when he collected Pedri's neat backheel and struck the ball past goalkeeper Jordi Masip in the 65th minute. Messi scored his first goal for Barca in 2005. His has beaten the total Pele amassed for Brazilian club Santos from 1956 to 1974. ""When I started playing football I never thought I would break any records. And even less the one I achieved today,"" Messi posted on Instagram. ""I can only thank all those who helped me over the years, my teammates, my family, my friends and all those who support me every day."" Messi's latest career landmark comes in the wake of his failed pre-season bid to quit Barca after they were thrashed 8-2 by eventual winners Bayern Munich in the Champions League quarter-fnals. That showdown between the club and the six-time Ballon d'Or winner has been put to one side as he continues to excel on the pitch, although he said in an interview this week that he had had a ""very bad time"" this summer. ""I see Messi happy. He is working hard, and he is a very important part of our attacking game,"" said Barca coach Ronald Koeman after Tuesday's win. Messi now has his sights on Pele's record for most international goals by a South American. He has 71 compared to Pele's 77 for Brazil. Unlike Pele though, he is yet to win a World Cup. Messi's Argentina side lost to Germany in the 2014 World Cup final."

""I can only thank all those who helped me over the years, my teammates, my family, my friends and all those who support me every day."" Messi had equalled Pele on Saturday in a 2-2 draw with Valencia. The two men scored at almost an equal rate for their clubs. It was the 33-year-old Argentine's 749th competitive match for Barca, meaning he has scored a goal every 1.16 games. The Brazilian scored 643 goals in 757 matches with Santos, where he played between 1956 and 1974, or one every 1.17 matches. ""Like you, I know what it's like to love wearing the same shirt every day. Like you, I know that there is nothing better than the place we feel at home,"" Pele wrote to Messi on Instagram after the Argentine tied the record. ""Congratulations on your historic record, Lionel. But above all, congratulations on your beautiful career at Barcelona. Stories like ours, of loving the same club for so long, unfortunately will be increasingly rare in football. I admire you very much."" Messi, a six-time Ballon d'Or winner, is by far the highest scorer in Barca history (Cesar Rodriguez is next on 230 goals), the highest scorer in the history of the Spanish league championship (451 goals, ahead of Cristiano Ronaldo's 311), and the player who has won the most trophies with the Catalan club (34, including four Champions Leagues). ""I see Messi happy. He is working hard, and he is a very important part of our attacking game,"" said Koeman after the win. Pele claims to have scored more than a thousand goals, counting all the matches he played, official and unofficial. But in competitive matches Pele appears to be second to Austrian and Czechoslovakian striker Josef Bican, who football historians have calculated scored 805 goals between 1931 and 1955 playing for half a dozen clubs and three national teams. Pele, with between 757 and 767 goals in competitive matches over his career, which also include 92 Brazil internationals and two seasons with the New York Cosmos, is ahead of Messi with 714 for club and country and the more travelled Cristiano Ronaldo (754). Pele still holds the record for most international goals by a South American with 77 for Brazil but Messi has 71 for Argentina."

But Messi was left frustrated as a dogged Valencia forced a draw that leaves Barcelona eight points behind leaders Atletico Madrid, who beat Elche 3-1 earlier in the day. Barcelona started slowly and went a goal behind to Mouctar Diakhaby's unchallenged header from a corner after half an hour. Antoine Griezmann earned the penalty that led to Messi's record-equalling goal when the Frenchman was nudged over by Jose Gaya. Messi's spot-kick was saved by Jaume Domenech but the ball rebounded and from Alba's dinked cross, the Argentine headed the ball into the net to draw level with Pele. Barcelona went ahead thanks to a superb scissor kick from Uruguayan Ronald Araujo. But Valencia's pressure was rewarded when Maxi Gomez got in front of Barca central defender Oscar Mingueza to turn in a cross and equalise. Philippe Coutinho drove a shot just wide with 12 minutes remaining and Messi curled a free-kick wide but Barcelona were forced to share the points."

50,16/12/2020,16:44,"Lewandowski hopes to break Messi, Ronaldo monopoly as world's 'Best'",Robert Lewandowski is confident of being named FIFA's best male footballer on Thursday on the strength of his 55-goal haul to help Bayern Munich win the treble last season.,"The Poland striker, Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo are shortlisted in the men's category for FIFA's 'The Best' awards. ""We were the best, there's no doubt about that,"" Lewandowski said on Wednesday ahead of the online ceremony at FIFA headquarters in Zurich. After a season ""when you've scored a lot of goals and won everything, I don't think there's anyone I can compare myself to,"" the 32-year-old added confidently. His goals helped Bayern lift the Bundesliga, German Cup and Champions League trophies in 2019/20 as top-scorer in all three competitions. Lewandowski has already been named the footballer of the year for Germany and Europe. Croatia's Luka Modric, voted 'The Best' FIFA men's footballer in 2018, is the only player to have broken Ronaldo and Messi's domination since 2008. Ronaldo has been voted player of the year five times, one less than Messi. Can the Poland striker - who team-mate Thomas Mueller has dubbed 'LewanGOALski' - break the mould? ""There's no one who deserves it as much as Robert,"" said Bayern boss Hansi Flick, who is shortlisted for coach of the year alongside Liverpool's Jurgen Klopp and Leeds boss Marcelo Bielsa. Bayern captain Manuel Neuer - who along with Jan Oblak and Alisson Becker is up for the best male goalkeeper award - says Lewandowski is ""unique"". ""I'm really happy to have him in my team - and not to have to play against him,"" Neuer quipped. The various category winners will be decided by the votes of the captains and head coaches of all the national teams, plus more than 200 media representatives, while fans can also vote. England's Lucy Bronze, Pernille Harder of Chelsea and French defender Wendie Renard are in the running for the women's award. However, Bayern players are only too aware of the dangers of getting their hopes up. Former Munich winger Franck Ribery was crestfallen in 2013 - when Bayern also won the treble - to have been voted third behind Ronaldo and Messi. A year later, Neuer had to settle for third behind the superstars despite outstanding displays to help Germany win the 2014 World Cup. Lewandowski scored in Bayern's 8-2 thrashing of Barcelona in the quarter-finals of the Champions League in August with Messi on the losing team. A footballer from a Bundesliga club has never been voted as the world's best player. Lothar Matthaeus, the only German voted FIFA world player of the year, was at Inter Milan when he achieved the feat in 1991. Lewandowski would not be surprised if Messi wins it again on Thursday, adding: ""we'll have to wait 100 years until someone like him is born again""."

Voting will be held on January 24, 2021,"" the body said in a statement. The final approval comes after Barca reached an agreement with the Catalan regional government two weeks ago. Coronavirus concerns have made this the first time the club's elections have been decentralised, with 10 voting locations for Barca's 110,000 members dotted around Spain. They can cast their vote at Barca's Camp Nou as well as in the cities of Girona, Tarragona, Tortosa, Lleida, Madrid, Valencia, Seville, Palma and Andorran capital Andorra la Vella. Among the seven candidates for election is former president Joan Laporta, who made his candidacy official two weeks ago. Laporta was at the helm from 2003-2010, a period which included four La Liga titles and two Champions League triumphs."
52,13/12/2020,23:50,"Messi saves lacklustre Barca, Sociedad reclaim top spot","Lionel Messi saved Barcelona from another embarrassing result by scoring the decisive goal in a 1-0 win over lowly Levante, while Real Sociedad returned top of La Liga on Sunday.","Messi struck with 14 minutes remaining of a lacklustre display from Barca at the Camp Nou which will do little to ease fan fears following their 3-0 hammering at the hands of Juventus midweek. Ronald Koeman's side are still way off the pace in the title race, nine points behind Sociedad who reclaimed first place despite only drawing 1-1 with Eibar. Barcelona do however have two games in hand on the Basque outfit. Atletico are level on 26 points with Sociedad and also have two games in hand while Real Madrid are now just three points behind the leaders having played one less after beating their local rivals 2-0 on Saturday. Villarreal are four points off the lead in fourth after drawing 1-1 at Real Betis, who are one point behind Barca in ninth. ""The team is working well, they gave the maximum,"" said Koeman. ""We still lack a little confidence in ourselves, in our game, but we had a lot of chances, and I have nothing to say about the attitude of the players in this match."" Barca managed to force several saves from Aitor Fernandez, with the Levante goalkeeper doing particularly well to push away a stinging shot from Martin Braithwaite in the 16th minute and Antoine Griezmann's header five minutes later. However the best chance of the opening period fell to Jorge de Frutos in the 12th minute, the Spaniard somehow shooting straight at Marc-Andre ter Stegen after the ball broke kindly for him right in front of goal. Barca continued to dominate possession in the second half but if anything looked less threatening, with Fernandez being called into action largely for shots that were hit straight at him. However with Levante looking more comfortable than a side of their level should at the Camp Nou, Messi saved his team with a clinical finish off the post after collecting Frenkie de Jong's pass. It was hardly the sort of display to honour Sergio Busquets' 593rd appearance for the club, which takes him level at fourth of all time for matches played for Barca alongside Carles Puyol. However the three points are a boost ahead of the visit of Sociedad on Wednesday, which is then followed up by another home clash with Valencia on Saturday. Earlier Ander Barrenetxea gave Real Sociedad the lead in San Sebastian with a thumping strike in the 20th minute, but Sergi Enrich turned home with 25 minutes remaining to send his team 10th on 15 points. Sociedad would have had a bigger gap between them and Atletico had Igor Zubeldia's 80th-minute tap-in not been ruled out by VAR for an extremely tight offside. Sunday's draw was Sociedad's sixth in as many games in all competitions, and came after another 1-1 draw at Napoli on Thursday which saw them squeeze into the last 32 of the Europa League. Granada won 1-0 at Elche in Sunday's other match, a win that keeps them one point ahead of Barcelona."
53,10/12/2020,15:44,Barcelona's Griezmann says ending Huawei contract over Uighurs claims,Barcelona's World Cup-winning footballer Antoine Griezmann said Thursday he was ending his sponsorship contract with Huawei over reports the Chinese telecoms giant was involved in the surveillance of Uighur Muslims.,"Frenchman Griezmann said on Instagram: ""Following strong suspicions that Huawei has contributed to the development of a 'Uighurs alert' through the use of facial recognition software, I am immediately ending my partnership with the company."" US-based surveillance research firm IPVM said in a report Tuesday that Huawei had been involved in testing facial recognition software in China that could send alerts to police when it recognised Uighur minorities' faces. China has come under intense international criticism over its policies in the resource-rich Xinjiang territory, where rights groups say as many as one million Uighurs and other mostly Muslim minorities have been held in internment camps. China defends the camps as vocational training centres aimed at stamping out terrorism and improving employment opportunities. Griezmann, a 29-year-old forward who was one of the leading members of the France team that won the 2018 World Cup in Russia, has been a Huawei brand ambassador since 2017. He has featured prominently in a giant advertising campaign for the company in France. AFP has contacted Huawei France for comment. Griezmann made his name with Real Sociedad in Spain before moving to Atletico Madrid in 2014. He joined Barcelona in a 120-million-euro ($145.5 million) deal in 2019 and is expected to be part of the French squad for next year's European championships. His decision to end his Huawei contract comes at a time when French sports figures, especially high-profile footballers, are increasingly making their voice heard on social and political issues. In posts on his social media accounts last month, Griezmann expressed his disquiet at a video showing French policemen beating a music producer. The video was one of the factors that led President Emmanuel Macron to declare that there is an ""urgent need"" to reform the police. On Wednesday, the Paris Saint-Germain team containing Griezmann's World Cup teammate Kylian Mbappe walked off the pitch with their opponents from Istanbul Basaksehir in protest at allegedly racist language used by a match official in a Champions League game. Huawei earlier this year became the world's top mobile phone seller."
54,08/12/2020,23:34,Ronaldo scores twice as Juve crush Messi's troubled Barcelona,"Cristiano Ronaldo struck twice from the penalty spot to win his battle with rival Lionel Messi and guide Juventus to a 3-0 win over Barcelona on Tuesday, earning the Italians top spot in Champions League Group G.","The former Real Madrid striker and his Argentina counterpart traded Ballon d'Or wins for a decade between 2008-2017 and were figureheads for the duelling Spanish giants, but there was only one winner at the Camp Nou as they met for the first time since Ronaldo's departure for Juve in 2018. Andrea Pirlo's Juventus lost 2-0 at home against Barcelona in October without Ronaldo, sidelined with Covid-19, but were greatly improved and earned the first Champions League away win against Barcelona since Bayern Munich triumphed in 2013. Both sides, tied on 15 points, were assured of qualification before kick-off, but Juve's three-goal victory handed them a superior head-to-head record. ""When you have this desire to sacrifice yourself and an infallible sniper, like Ronaldo, you are sure you can win these matches,"" Bonucci told Sky Sport Italia. ""As we showed in the derby (win over Torino), if we play with this desire, we bring home the results we want. The next step is to do this in all our games."" Ronald Koeman, reeling from Barcelona's 2-1 defeat by promoted minnows Cadiz on Saturday in La Liga, reacted by making four changes but the hosts started badly. It only took 13 minutes for Ronaldo to break the deadlock, slotting home from the penalty spot after the referee deemed Ronald Araujo's challenge on him a foul. Juventus did not relent and their pressure led to a second goal, US midfielder Weston McKenzie volleying home Juan Cuadrado's sweetly clipped cross in the 20th minute. The Catalans and their captain Messi finally woke from their slumber, as the attacker had one effort blocked by Matthijs de Ligt and another saved by veteran goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon, while Pjanic lashed over the bar. Ronaldo notched his second from the penalty spot in the 52nd minute after Clement Lenglet handled clumsily in the area, as the hosts imploded. Antoine Griezmann, who was invisible in the first half, grazed the crossbar with a looping header from a Messi free kick, and Buffon beat out another effort, with De Ligt's pressure enough to stop Martin Braithwaite converting the rebound. Leonardo Bonucci had a fourth goal ruled out for offside after he tapped in Ronaldo's effort from close range, with Messi trying in vain at the other end to answer Ronaldo, but he found the 42-year-old Buffon in his way time and time again. Griezmann was critical of his own side after they fell to their first home Champions League group stage defeat since 2009. ""We were not good enough, they over-ran us in the first half, we lacked everything,"" he told Movistar. ""A lack of attitude, desire, wanting to run, defending, attacking, everything was bad."" Barcelona goalkeeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen was also unhappy. ""There are two things, one thing is individual mistakes, and the other is how the team defends, these are different things,"" he said. ""Right now teams can score against us in any given moment. This is very tough, we need to come out of this, and work very hard."""
55,06/12/2020,18:06,Dembele injury adds to Barcelona's problems,The bad news continued for Barcelona on Sunday when the club reported that injury-prone French forward Ousmane Dembele tweaked his right hamstring in the loss to Cadiz the day before.,"""It is minor and the progress will determine his availability,"" said Barca in a statement. Spanish media estimated he would be out for one to two weeks. Dembele suffered a string of serious injuries to his right hamstring last season and appeared in only nine games for Barcelona. This season he has already played 12 times and scored four goals, including one in a Champions League victory at Ferencvaros on Wednesday. He came on at half-time in Cadiz, with Barcelona already a goal down in a match they eventually lost 2-1. He joins a growing injury list at the Camp Nou. Teenage phenomenon Ansu Fati, Sergi Roberto and defender Gerard Pique all suffered serious injuries in November and will be out until next year. Defender Samuel Umtiti is another long-term casualty. Manager Ronald Koeman has been rotating other players who are carrying knocks, including goalkeeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen and defender Clement Lenglet. Both returned to the team on Saturday and made costly errors. The loss in Cadiz dropped Barcelona to eighth, 12 points behind leaders Atletico Madrid. Both clubs have played 10 games. ""A gap of 12 points to a team as strong as Atletico Madrid is a lot,"" said Koeman on Saturday. ""There are still games to be played, but if we don't improve our attitude and our consistency away from home, we can't have a say."" Ter Stegen made his first error after eight minutes, staying on his line at a corner and then flapping at a soft close-range header from Alvaro Gimenez. With the scores level after 64 minutes, Lenglet, in his won penalty area, failed to control the ball from a Barcelona throw-in. Ter Stegen charged out but whiffed on his attempted clearance, knocking the ball against Alvaro Negredo who rolled it into an empty net. ""We conceded goals that I can't think of other teams I've coached letting in,"" said Koeman. ""We have to improve. When you don't have the ball, you have to go into battle with your opponent. I'm very disappointed. ""The attitude was not good tonight, not only from the defenders."" Barcelona have won just four games in La Liga but have been imperious in the Champions League, winning all five games. ""They are different competitions,"" said Koeman. ""Defeat is difficult to explain. We were coming off good games."""

""It's a gigantic step backwards for our chances to fight for La Liga, you have to see it like that,"" the Catalans' coach Ronald Koeman said. ""A points difference of 12 points with a team as strong as Atletico is enormous,"" he added. Koeman made three changes from the midweek Champions League win at Ferencvaros with goalkeeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen coming in for Neto. But Ter Stegen made a first costly error in Andalusia after eight minutes as Alvaro Gimenez claimed his second goal in as many games. The Barca defence failed to clear a corner which fell to Ter Stegen, but his weak parry onto his own line was tapped in by Gimenez. Koeman's men were all-square after 56 minutes as Jordi Alba's low cross was deflected into his own goal by defender Pedro Alcala. But Ter Stegen's second costly error came eight minutes later. Clement Lenglet made a hash of Alba's throw in before Ter Stegen failed to clear under pressure from Negredo and the former Manchester City striker claimed his third goal league goal of the campaign. Under-pressure Zidane said Madrid's scrappy 1-0 victory in Seville was significant after a testing run of results. Sevilla goalkeeper Bono guided Vinicius Junior's effort into his own net in the second half, allowing Zidane's side to take the three points and move up to third in the table, six points behind Atletico. Following two defeats in the past three games, including a 2-0 defeat to Shakhtar Donetsk in midweek that leaves Real's Champions League qualification hopes in the balance, Spanish press reports have linked former Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino and ex-Madrid forward Raul to Zidane's job. Zidane said he was satisfied with the points after a ""difficult"" time. ""These are three very important points for us. It's a well-deserved win, against a very good opponent, who can put you in trouble at any time. We got through this,"" he said. ""It has been a bit difficult lately, today we have to enjoy it, be happy, but nothing more."" Atletico, now unbeaten in 26 games in La Liga, moved to the top of the table after France international Thomas Lemar and Spain midfielder Marcos Llorente scored for Diego Simeone's men against Valladolid. Atletico are among five clubs to remain without a domestic defeat in Europe's main five leagues since the start of the season. Real Sociedad, who have lost just once in the league this term, could regain the lead if they beat Deportivo Alaves on Sunday."

""We have the squad to do that, a competitive team even if we rotate players,"" he added. On Friday, Barca coach Ronald Koeman criticised interim club president Carles Tusquets who said earlier in the week they should have sold the record six-time Ballon d'Or winner during the summer. The 33-year-old made an attempt to leave the Camp Nou before backing down in September, although he is free to leave next year. Additionally, Brazilian Leonardo said talks are ongoing with France World Cup winner Kylian Mbappe about a new deal, with his contract up in June 2022. ""It's moving along well.

""We cannot control the statements from outside, but those from inside the club, I believe that it is different,"" he said. Tusquets said on Thursday that ""economically speaking, I would have sold Messi in the summer. Economically speaking, it would have been desirable"". Messi made an attempt to leave Barcelona this summer before backing down, although he is free to leave next year. Koeman said he considered Tusquets' statements ""a personal opinion and I respect any opinion, but Leo has this season with Barca and he will decide his future. Hopefully it will be here"". ""We know Leo's situation and he is the one who must decide his future. ""I don't know any more about figures, it's not my job. My job is to prepare the team, play well and win,"" said Koeman. Former Barcelona star Neymar, sold to Paris Saint-Germain in a world record deal in 2017, said this week he would like a reunion with Messi. ""What I want most is to have fun with him on the pitch again,"" Neymar told ESPN. ""I want to play with him for sure. Next year we have to do it."" Tusquets ruled out buying back the Brazilian, but Messi will be a free agent when his contract expires in June. PSG are one of the candidates to lure the Argentine away from Camp Nou although Manchester City are widely believed to be the main suitors. Asked if he would like to have Messi and Neymar playing together for Barca, Koeman said: ""I don't like to talk about individual but as a club, as a coach, as a Barcelona fan, you always want to have the best players in the world."" Tusquets also warned that the club's finances, stretched by the lack of spectators due to the coronavirus pandemic, meant players will not be paid in January. Koeman said ""the players and I as coach have reached an agreement with the club"". Although Barcelona have been imperious in the Champions League, they are struggling in La Liga and travel to Cadiz in seventh place, 10 points behind leaders Real Sociedad. ""The season is still long,"" said Koeman. ""But we cannot afford to lose more points""."

With Messi having spent the last close season trying to engineer a move away from Barcelona, who are suffering badly from the economic impact of the coronavirus, Neymar perhaps feels a reunion in Paris is more likely than his return to the Camp Nou. Meanwhile PSG are pondering how to deal with Neymar's contract, and that of Kylian Mbappe, which both expire in 2022. The Qatar-owned club are also feeling the effects of the pandemic, which has slashed ticket revenue in particular, with games in France being played behind closed doors. Qualifying for the Champions League last 16 would provide a financial boost. Thomas Tuchel's team only require a draw at home to Istanbul Basaksehir next week to seal their progress. ""I didn't come to Paris to play in the Europa League,"" Neymar told Brazil's Esporte Interativo. However, Tuchel warned: ""We have almost qualified, which means we have not qualified yet. That is the reality. Being almost pregnant does not mean you are pregnant."" Last season's Champions League runners-up are a work in progress and they have allowed the chasing domestic pack to catch up. A loss at Monaco and a draw with Bordeaux in their last two matches have left PSG just two points clear of Lille, Lyon, Monaco and Montpellier in Ligue 1. PSG go to Montpellier this weekend knowing a defeat would knock them off top spot. Montpellier, though, are without their top scorer Andy Delort after he tested positive for coronavirus for the second time in three months. The ambitious Cote d'Azur club reacted to suffering their fifth straight defeat against Bayer Leverkusen in the Europa League on Thursday by sacking coach Patrick Vieira. The France 1998 World Cup-winning midfielder took the club to seventh and then fifth in the last two seasons but had been under pressure with Nice in the bottom half of Ligue 1, despite being expected to progress this season following considerable investment from the club's British owners Ineos. Appointed in 2018, Vieira had been hampered in recent weeks by the loss of veteran captain Dante to a serious injury. He has been replaced by his assistant, Adrian Ursea. The 53-year-old Romanian, who has spent much of his playing and coaching career in Switzerland, had been an assistant to previous Nice coach Lucien Favre and returned last year to work under Vieira. Ursea's first game in charge will be away at struggling Reims on Sunday. 4 - The number of points separating the top six in Ligue 1. Marseille, in sixth, are four points behind leaders PSG but have two games in hand on the teams above them. 3 - If PSG fail to win at Montpellier they will have gone three Ligue 1 games without winning for the first time since April 2019. 9 - Lyon have injected life into their season on a run of nine games without defeat, leaving them just two points off top spot."
60,03/12/2020,17:16,Interim Barca president said he would have sold Messi,Interim Barcelona president Carles Tusquets said Thursday he would have sold Argentine star Lionel Messi in the summer.,"Messi made an attempt to leave Barcelona this summer before backing down. He can talk to other clubs in January and leave for free when his contract expires in June, with Manchester City expected to make a renewed attempt to lure the 33-year-old away from Camp Nou. ""From an economic point of view, I would have sold Messi this summer. Economically, that would have been desirable,"" Tusquets told Catalan radio Rac1. ""La Liga imposes salary caps and that would have helped us,"" Tusquets said when asked what a potential transfer would have offered. Tusquets, who took over as interim president after the resignation of Josep Maria Bartomeu in October, all but ruled out a return of Neymar to Barcelona from Paris Saint-Germain. ""If he comes as a free agent, that could work, but if we don't sell, we won't be able to recruit. It won't be possible, unless the next president (who will be elected on January 24) has a miracle in his hands,"" said Tusquets. Barca's financial status, Tusquets added, was ""worrying, very bad, but with hope"". ""We will not be able to pay salaries in January,"" he said. ""In January, the players will not be paid, but it's not serious. The players have two big paydays, in January and July. That has been delayed, as have title bonuses."""

France striker Griezmann has struggled to find his best form since joining from Atletico Madrid almost 18 months ago, but the 29-year-old appears belatedly to be hitting his stride under Koeman. While Barca lag 10 points off the pace in Spain, albeit with games in hand, the Catalans can complete a perfect group-stage campaign for the first time since 2002-03 with victory at home to Juventus next week. They will finish top of the section if they avoid defeat. ""We played well. We've won five matches out of five, playing some good football and scoring quite a few goals. I hope we can continue this run in the league,"" Koeman told Movistar. ""We saw that we have a very good team. We were able to rest several players, but those who played showed we have the expertise."" Despite the absence of Messi, goalkeeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen, Philippe Coutinho and injured pair Gerard Pique and Ansu Fati, a heavily rotated Barca ripped the Hungarian champions apart in the opening half-hour. Griezmann's clever back-heel flick from a Jordi Alba cross set the visitors on their way 14 minutes into a freezing night at the Puskas Arena. Martin Braithwaite soon poked in a second from a similar position following an Ousmane Dembele assist, capping a 33-pass move with his fourth goal in three games. Dembele crashed home a penalty after Braithwaite was upended by Abraham Frimpong, with Koeman withdrawing Alba and Sergio Busquets at half-time and giving some playing time to youngsters Carles Alena, Riqui Puig and Konrad de la Fuente."

Before the match, the club played 'The Song of the Birds' by Catalan cellist Pablo Casals as the teams stood around the centre circle where a Maradona shirt was laid on the centre spot. Lionel Messi, who has inherited Maradona's legendary Argentina number 10 shirt, bowed his head. Flags at the Camp Nou flew at half mast, Maradona's image was displayed on every screen and digital advertising hoardings while a club official held a framed Maradona Barcelona shirt. The Catalans have been struggling in La Liga and started the game 14th. On Friday, Koeman said the best tribute his team could pay Maradona was to ""show what we can do on the pitch"". He recalled Messi and Frenkie de Jong, who were not in the squad for Tuesday's 4-0 Champions League win at Dynamo Kiev, and also started Antoine Griezmann, who was on the bench in Ukraine. Barcelona took the lead after 29 minutes when the ball lobbed into the net off Martin Braithwaite's knee following a scramble in front of goal. Messi seemed to be attempting a tribute to Maradona's famous 'Hand of God' goal against England in 1986 as he leapt after the floating ball stretching his left arm toward it but the referee deemed he did not make contact. It was Braithwaite's first goal at the Camp Nou and followed the Denmark forward's midweek strike in Kiev. Griezmann scored with a powerful left-foot volley from outside the box in the 42nd minute. The France World Cup winner then passed up a shooting chance in the 56th minute to roll a pass across the goal and set up a tap-in for Philippe Coutinho. As Barcelona rediscovered their cutting edge, Ousmane Dembele had a strike ruled out for offside. Messi got his goal in the 74th minute with a dazzling strike. He picked up the ball in midfield, danced past two defenders and smashed a rising left-foot shot into the top far corner. He celebrated by pulling off his Barcelona shirt to reveal a vintage Newell's Old Boys jersey from Maradona's one season with the club in Rosario, Argentina. ""It was a great moment,"" said Koeman. ""Leo's goal, his gesture dedicated to Maradona."" ""It was something very big. We Europeans don't realise how big Maradona is in Argentina."" Earlier this week, Newell's tweeted a photograph from Maradona's debut showing a six-year-old local prodigy, in the same black and red shirt, doing ball tricks for the crowd at half-time.

The reduction in their wage bill represents a welcome financial lifeline for Barca, hit hard by the loss of gate receipts at the Camp Nou and other effects of Covid-19 prevention measures. Barca's acting president Carles Tusquets has described the financial situation as ""not dramatic, but very worrying"". Tusquets assumed temporary control following Josep Maria Bartomeu's resignation last month. Restoring Barca's finances will be one of the items on the top of the new president's in-tray with the election for Bartomeu's successor to be held on January 24. A new candidate entered the race for the job on Friday in Joan Laporta, who occupied the position between 2003 and 2010 and led the club to 12 major titles."
65,24/11/2020,23:17,Barca stroll into last 16 after thrashing Dynamo Kiev,Barcelona qualified for the Champions League last 16 with two games to spare on Tuesday as Martin Braithwaite scored twice in a 4-0 win over Dynamo Kiev.,"Lionel Messi was among a handful of key players rested for Barca but Braithwaite's double, as well as goals from Sergino Dest and substitute Antoine Griezmann saw the Catalans safely through, joining Juventus in progressing from Group G. First and second place are still to be settled, with Barcelona playing away at Ferencvaros next week before a potential decider at home to Juve, who beat the Hungarian side 2-1 in Turin thanks to a late Alvaro Morata winner. After taking maximum points from their first three games, Ronald Koeman took the chance to rotate as Messi and Frenkie de Jong were left out of the squad completely while Jordi Alba and Griezmann were both on the bench. Instead, Koeman named a youthful line-up that included a senior debut for Oscar Mingueza in central defence, with Francisco Trincao, Pedri and Carles Alena also given chances to impress. There will certainly be tougher opponents than Dynamo to navigate but Mingueza delivered a composed display and may be trusted again given Barcelona's current shortage in defence. Gerard Pique, Samuel Umtiti and Ronald Araujo are all out injured. Braithwaite certainly did his chances no harm by taking his total number of goals for Barca from one to three, the first a penalty, and a deserved return for his tireless performance up front. Victory also continues Barca's excellent form in Europe, which comes in stark contrast to their struggles in La Liga, where they sit 12th in the table following Saturday's 1-0 defeat by Atletico Madrid. Dynamo were also depleted, without their top scorer Viktor Tsyhankov, who was ill, and they never really threatened their opponents like they did in the return fixture last month. They will now battle Ferencvaros for third place and qualification for the Europa League. Barcelona dominated the ball in the first half but were unable to breach a determined Dynamo defence, even if there was little threat from the home side, even on the break. The opening goal came from an unlikely source as Dest fired a pass into Alena and while the ball was returned to Braithwaite on the edge of the box, Dest took over, carrying it into his stride and shooting into the far corner for his first goal for the club. Braithwaite's time would come five minutes later as he finished off Alena's corner at the back post and then he made it three from the penalty spot, after being pushed in the back by Denys Popov as he tried to head in Alba's cross. Popov had already blazed wide what was perhaps Dynamo's best chance at the back post while Koeman had made changes bringing on Griezmann, Alba and Riqui Puig. Puig should have added a fourth but skied Dest's cutback over before Greizmann did, capping a lively cameo by driving in and rounding off a comfortable victory."
66,23/11/2020,14:57,"Phenomenal Haaland, trouble for Barcelona and PSG: European football talking points","Barcelona and Paris Saint-Germain look vulnerable after weekend defeats, while Erling Braut Haaland laid down another marker, Zlatan Ibrahimovic keeps on scoring too, and Norwegian club Bodo/Glimt have a record which will take some beating.","AFP Sport rounds up some of the main talking points from across the continent: If Barcelona thought keeping Lionel Messi against his will would suffice to make them contenders in La Liga this season, it is not working. The Argentine was a peripheral figure as Ronald Koeman's team produced a mediocre performance and lost 1-0 to Atletico Madrid on Saturday, a result which left them 12th in La Liga, nine points behind Diego Simeone's team in second. They are 12 points behind leaders Real Sociedad, albeit with two games in hand. The Basque club are flying, having equalled a club record of six straight league wins, while Barcelona have won just once, and lost three times, in the same period. Atletico are possibly now the title favourites, unbeaten in 24 league games, and it all points to the Catalans facing a fight just to finish in the top four. All the more so as the injuries are piling up: Against Atletico they saw Gerard Pique go off with a serious knee injury and lost Sergi Roberto to a thigh tear. Both are expected to be out for two months. Erling Braut Haaland keeps on breaking records. On Saturday the Norwegian sensation, aged 20 years and four months, scored four times in the second half in Borussia Dortmund's 5-2 win at Hertha Berlin, becoming the youngest player to net four in one Bundesliga game. Named last week as the winner of the Golden Boy for Europe's best young player, as awarded by Italian sports daily Tuttosport, he has 10 Bundesliga goals for the season and 15 in all competitions. Not to mention six for his country. Haaland's figures have been mindblowing since he burst onto the scene last season with Salzburg, and he has now scored a total of 23 goals in 22 Bundesliga matches following his move to Dortmund in January. That beats the tally of Hamburg legend Uwe Seeler, who scored 20 in his first 22 outings of the first Bundesliga season in 1963/64. Kylian Mbappe, that other young striking phenomenon, has now scored 99 goals for Paris Saint-Germain since signing from Monaco in a 180 million-euro deal ($215m) deal in August 2017. On Friday he grabbed a first-half brace to put PSG 2-0 up away against his old side, but the champions imploded in the second half and ended up losing 3-2, with a late Cesc Fabregas penalty deciding the game. After eight consecutive Ligue 1 wins, PSG's momentum has been stalled and they are now just two points clear of Lille at the top. And their defensive weaknesses may come back to haunt them in a crucial Champions League clash with RB Leipzig this midweek. Presnel Kimpembe is suspended for that match, and Abdou Diallo is in the firing line after his error gifted Monaco the crucial penalty. The jury remains out on last season's Champions League finalists. Will Haaland and Mbappe still be banging in the goals as they approach 40? Zlatan Ibrahimovic is, and AC Milan are on top of Serie A. On Sunday the Swede scored twice before limping off with a thigh strain as the Rossoneri won 3-1 at Napoli to stay two points ahead of Sassuolo at the top, and remain unbeaten. Ibrahimovic is the top scorer in Italy with 10 goals, despite turning 39 last month. Milan coach Stefano Pioli must hope the veteran forward is not missing for too long. The early indications are he will be out for at least 10 days. Milan's other goal-scorer in Naples was Jens Petter Hauge, the winger signed from Bodo/Glimt at the start of the season. Hauge's old club have coped fine since his departure and on Sunday became Norwegian champions for the first time. From the small town of Bodo, just north of the Arctic Circle and a 16-hour drive from Oslo, Bodo/Glimt are the northernmost top-flight champions ever according to sports data experts Gracenote who say they have stolen that particular prize from KA Akureyri, former Icelandic title winners. Bodo/Glimt have won the league with five games to spare and will enter next season's Champions League. bur-as/td <org>BORUSSIA DORTMUND</org>"
67,23/11/2020,14:02,"Barcelona coach Koeman rests Messi, De Jong for Dynamo Kiev clash","Barcelona coach Ronald Koeman said Monday that Lionel Messi and Frenkie de Jong will not feature against Dynamo Kiev in the Champions League this midweek, instead being given a rest.","Barca travel to Ukraine on top of Group G with a perfect nine points after three games, three points ahead of second-placed Juventus, but they are a lowly 12th in La Liga after losing 1-0 to Atletico Madrid on Saturday. ""We've decided not to take Leo or Frenkie because our situation in the Champions League is quite comfortable,"" Koeman told reporters ahead of Tuesday's game. Messi, 33, has played every Barca match so far this season and also played the full 90 minutes for Argentina four times over October and November. Midfielder De Jong, who is 10 years Messi's junior, has also played every match for the Catalan giants as well as five international fixtures for the Netherlands in the same period. ""The players need a break and we think it's time for them to rest ... Both have played almost every minute and come from playing with their national teams,"" Koeman added. ""Sometimes, you have to protect your players because the calendar is incredible."" Injuries to several key players including Ansu Fati, Sergio Busquets and Gerard Pique have forced Koeman to rotate. Antoine Griezmann and promising teen Pedri are expected to lead the attack while Clement Lenglet will lead the defence in the absence of both Pique, who picked up a knee injury on Saturday, and Samuel Umtiti."
68,22/11/2020,14:17,Blow for Barca as Pique knee injury confirmed,"Barcelona's Gerard Pique has sustained a serious knee injury, the club confirmed on Sunday, with the defender expected to be out for at least two months.","Pique cried as he hobbled off the pitch during Barca's 1-0 defeat by Atletico Madrid in La Liga on Saturday following a colission with Angel Correa. ""Tests have shown that he has a grade 3 sprain in the internal lateral ligament and partial injury to the anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee,"" said Barcelona in a statement. The club also confirmed that Sergi Roberto, who can play right back or central midfield, will be out for two months after tearing a muscle in his thigh. There was no official estimate for Pique's return but reports in the Spanish press have suggested he could be out for anything between two and six months. Pique's absence leaves Barca with Clement Lenglet as their one fit central defender, given Samuel Umtiti and Ronald Araujo are also out injured. Frenkie de Jong has occasionally dropped into defence in recent weeks but the situation is far from ideal for Ronald Koeman, whose side slipped to their third league loss of the season against Atletico. Barca sit 10th in La Liga but have fared better in the Champions League, sitting top of Group G with nine points out of nine ahead of Tuesday's game away at Dynamo Kiev."
69,29/10/2020,13:23,New era to bring hope but no quick fix,"Ronald Koeman threw his arms around Lionel Messi and in that moment all seemed well again, Barcelona toasting the resignation of Josep Maria Bartomeu as president on Tuesday by beating Juventus 24 hours later.","""This was our best performance of the season,"" said Koeman shortly after, having just seen Messi score a penalty to cap a 2-0 win in Turin, which sent his side top of their Champions League group after two games played. By the end, Bartomeu's divisive regime had soured everything at Barca, his relationship with key players shot. It was possible even to detect a sense of liberation in their performance, a team suddenly given a point to prove. Yet while few will lament his departure, the initial uplift will be more difficult to sustain, as deep-rooted problems take longer to fix. Among the fans, the biggest hope will be change at the top brings a change of heart for Messi. When asked why he wanted to leave in August, Messi said: ""The truth is there has been no project or anything for a long time"". He said there were ""many things"" behind his unhappiness. The first he referred to was ""wanting a winning project"". But that winning project that Messi wants, namely in the Champions League, may not come for a while, even without Bartomeu. And at least with him, Messi had a reason to leave that even Barca fans could understand. In fact, a large section of supporters seemed to be on Messi's side, even if it meant their captain ending up in the shirt of Manchester City. Instead, a new president will promise innovation and bring hope. They will pledge to do everything to persuade Messi to remain. Some candidates might hang their campaigns on it. Against this new backdrop, Messi could find his exit harder to justify, the momentum of change pulling him in. If the old Barcelona made it impossible for him to stay, how does he reject a new Barcelona, that makes it possible for him not to leave? In an interview with La Vanguardia last week, Gerard Pique said the only thing he told Messi in the summer was: ""Leo, it's a year. Then new people will come."" They will come within three months now and that offers more time than expected. There is the bulk of a season to get a sense of what the new leadership feels like, including a transfer window in January. As the season goes on, there will be more speculation about the possibility of a new coach. Asked on Wednesday night if Bartomeu's resignation had changed his situation, Koeman said: ""I don't think so. If something changes they have to tell me."" But Koeman's credit as the coach hired in the depths of a crisis, by an unpopular president, when other, more desirable candidates were either not available or not willing, remains low. Koeman has said he will not be replaced if this season is a success but who defines what that success looks like? The bar for him is likely to be high. Uncertainty over Koeman's future raises questions about the players' commitment to him over the next few months and the commitment of the new board to backing him with the signings he wants, like Memphis Depay, in January. Although if there is no money to spend, there will be little choice. Bartomeu left a club that just posted losses of 97 million euros ($113.5m) for last season. He said he had agreed for Barcelona to join a European Super League ""to guarantee the club's future"". It means the spending spree that usually heralds a new era is impossible, even if selling expensive players should be easier to sanction for a board that had no stake in buying them. Antoine Griezmann, Ousmane Dembele and Philippe Coutinho, signed for around 350 million euros combined, could all be sold for lower fees, with less embarrassment. But without a new contract signed, Messi can still leave for free. The one thing that stays the same at a club now fully in flux."
70,29/10/2020,00:06,Juventus fall to Messi's Barcelona,"Cristiano Ronaldo missed Juventus' Champions League clash against Lionel Messi's Barcelona, two weeks after testing positive for coronavirus, with the Italian giants losing 2-0 at home on Wednesday in his absence.","Messi, 33, set up Ousmane Dembele to put Barca in front after quarter of an hour in Turin, adding a second himself from the penalty spot in stoppage time. Alvaro Morata had three goals ruled out for offside for Juve who played the final five minutes a man down after Merih Demiral was sent off for a second yellow card. Barcelona are top of Group G with six points after two games with Juventus on three. The reverse fixture takes place at the Camp Nou on December 8. ""This was our best game all season,"" said Barcelona coach Ronald Koeman. ""This is a big win against an important European side and we were able to play the football we're trying to impose. ""I'm very happy with the game and the character displayed by the team, it is a great victory."" It was a first defeat for new Juventus coach Andrea Pirlo whose last game as a player for the Turin giants was a loss to Barcelona in the 2015 Champions League final. ""We knew it would be a difficult game, they are further along the path, they have players more experienced in these games, while we are under construction,"" said Pirlo. ""We need to grow. I hope to have the other players back soon. ""I have no other solutions, those who play have to stay 90 minutes, so it's difficult when there are matches close together."" The 35-year-old Ronaldo, the top scorer in the history of the competition with 130 goals, was furious at missing the game. The Portuguese superstar had needed to test negative 24 hours before the game to take part in his sixth Champions League meeting against Argentine Messi. They have not faced off since the five-time Ballon d'Or winner left Real Madrid for Juventus in 2018. Hours before kick-off, Ronaldo posted a photo on Instagram, stating: ""Feeling good and healthy! Forza Juve! #finoallafine."" Adding a comment for his 241 million Instagram followers on the swab tests used to detect the virus, he said: ""PCR IS BULLSHIT."" He later removed that post. Ronaldo then posted a video of himself wearing the Juventus jersey running on a treadmill in his home gym, jumping off for his usual goal celebration before giving the thumbs up and wishing his teammates 'good luck'. Ronaldo first tested positive for Covid-19 on October 13 while playing with Portugal, and has been in self-isolation since returning to Italy. He has reportedly tested positive 18 times. The loss could have been heavier for Juve as under-pressure Koeman's side bounced back after a 3-1 defeat against Real Madrid at the weekend followed a 1-0 loss to Getafe. Barcelona president Josep Maria Bartomeu also resigned on Tuesday along with his board of directors, following mounting pressure from fans and his public falling out with six-time Ballon d'Or winner Messi. ""After the defeat against Real Madrid it was important to get off to a good start,"" said defender Sergi Roberto. ""We're delighted, there are only two goals' difference but it could have been a lot more. We dominated, we created chances."" Barcelona were firing on all cylinders with three early chances. Leonardo Bonucci closed down Messi with Wojciech Szczesny punching out a strike from former Juventus midfielder Miralem Pjanic and an Antoine Griezmann follow-up hitting the post. The breakthrough came when Messi pinged a sublime cross-field ball for Dembele who ran at two defenders before his long-range strike deflected off Federico Chiesa and looped in over Szczesny. Morata had the ball in the net just after but the goal was ruled offside after a VAR viewing, with Messi sending the ball wide after 23 minutes off a Griezmann back-heel flick. Morata latched onto a Juan Cuadrado cross to turn home after half an hour, but again he was ruled offside. A VAR review then denied him for a third time on 55 minutes. Juventus saw Demiral dismissed in the closing minutes, and Messi sealed victory from the spot following a foul by Federico Bernardeschi on Ansu Fati for his 117th Champions League goal."
71,04/10/2020,17:23,Barcelona thrash Real Madrid,"Barcelona crushed Real Madrid 4-0 in the first ever women's Clasico on Sunday, with Madrid president Florentino Perez deciding against attending the club's inaugural women's match.","Goals from Patri Guijarro, Lieke Martens and Alexia Putellas, as well as an own-goal by Madrid goalkeeper Maria Rodriguez, gave Barca an expected victory in an historic fixture. This was the first ever official fixture played by Madrid's women's team and the first ever against Barca, the club's most prestigious rival and the reigning Primera Division champions. Luis Rubiales, the president of the Spanish football federation, and Spain women's coach Jorge Vilda were both at Valdebebas to watch the game. But Perez was absent, choosing instead to travel to see Madrid's men's team play against Levante in La Liga later on Sunday. It was no surprise the Clasico took place at Madrid's training ground, where the men's team are also staging home games while the Santiago Bernabeu undergoes renovation work. Although Zinedine Zidane's side are given the prime pitch at the Alfredo di Stefano Stadium Madrid put the women's game against Barca out on Pitch 11. Barcelona founded a women's team in 1988 and won their first Spanish title in 2012. They have gone on to claim the trophy another four times since, including last season, when they also reached the Champions League final. Madrid, meanwhile, are embarking on their debut campaign with a women's team, having absorbed the already-established female club CD Tacon last summer. The transition began last year when Tacon started using Madrid's training facilities and bolstering their squad with nine new signings. Madrid have a lot of catching up to do on Barca, who demonstrated their superiority and might have scored more were it not for some good saves from goalkeeper Rodriguez. Patri put her name to the fixture's first goal when her shot deflected in after 19 minutes before Rodriguez turned into her own net after some excellent work by Caroline Graham Hansen. Martens and Alexia made the result more emphatic in the last 25 minutes."

After Barcelona's disastrous finish to last season, Planes, who was named in his post in August, has been conducting a squad overhaul with new manager Ronald Koeman. The 23-year-old Demebele, who has suffered a series of hamstring injuries since arriving from Dortmund in 2017, has been linked with a move away. ""We hope to be able to take advantage of his footballing talent. I am convinced that he will have a great year with us"", Planes told a press conference to introduce teenage Dutch defender Sergino Dest. ""There are four days left of mercato, it's an atypical mercato. A lot can happen,"" Planes added. He signalled that two French defenders, World Cup winner Samuel Umtiti and 20-year-old Jean-Clair Todibo, could be following Luis Suarez, Ivan Rakitic and Arturo Vidal out of the club. ""For Umtiti, we wish him all the best. He is a great player, but at the moment he is going through a bad situation, which is typical of injuries in football,"" Planes said. ""Jean-Clair has several offers. He wants to have time to play and grow up in another team, and that must be respected."""
73,02/10/2020,14:58,"Fati an early ray of optimism for Messi, Koeman's Barcelona",Barcelona's biggest win over the summer might have been preventing Lionel Messi from leaving but Ansu Fati could yet be the one to lead Ronald Koeman's recovery.,"A brilliant start to the season for the 17-year-old continued on Thursday with another goal, his third from Barca's opening two La Liga games, which have seen them score seven and concede none. Add in Fati's first international goal against Ukraine last month, which made him Spain's youngest ever scorer, and the sense is of a teenager ready to be trusted now by both his club and his country. Barcelona have needed a player like Fati, his pace and penetration down the left the perfect foil to the more considered creativity of Messi, Antoine Griezmann and Philippe Coutinho. He makes opposition defences sit deeper, nervous of his runs in behind, and gives the team a more direct alternative when possession becomes predictable. It was the role intended for Ousmane Dembele but the France attacker's injuries have curtailed his opportunities and Fati has stepped into the void. ""Ansu is a great talent,"" said Koema last week. ""There aren't many players at his age that have the level needed to play for Barca. He has to learn things but he has made his debut for the senior team for a reason. ""For me he is a player of the future but at his age today he is already very impressive."" Born in Guinea-Bissau but raised in Seville, where he moved aged six, Fati has a fearlessness that scares defenders but most impressive is his maturity, the ability to shoot with a cool head and make the right decisions under pressure. ""Ansu is young but he deserves to be playing,"" said Sergi Roberto after the 3-0 win over Celta Vigo on Thursday. ""I hope he can keep it up."" When Ernesto Valverde gave him his debut at the start of last season, Fati had not even played for Barcelona B. 'A star is born', wrote Mundo Deportivo but after an explosive start, he faded a little, in part because Valverde was determined not to ask too much from him too soon. But Koeman could now be the beneficiary, even if it remains unlikely Fati will be able to sustain his current level of performance over the next eight months. His body may not be physically ready for that demand and it would be a surprise if some degree of mental fatigue did not take its toll too. Yet for now, Koeman has an infectious talent, providing Barca the boost to morale they so dearly needed, not only to blur the memory of the last few months but also to vindicate their new coach and his project. When Luis Suarez was allowed to join Atletico Madrid, Messi vented his frustration with another swipe at club president Josep Maria Bartomeu. But even Suarez's double on his Atletico debut on Saturday was overshadowed by Fati, who scored twice against Villarreal and earned a penalty, converted by Messi. Already, the leap is being made to annoint Fati as Messi's successor, as well as his partner-in-chief, a weight Koeman will surely be keen to release. But Barca's boss will welcome the optimism and excitement for the future that Fati brings, even if he knows there are obstacles still to be overcome. On Sunday, Sevilla will certainly offer a much sterner test as Julen Lopetegui's side look to prove they are ready to play a more serious role in the title race this term. Atletico Madrid have the same ambition, with Villarreal up next on Saturday following Wednesday's goalless draw at at Huesca. Real Madrid head to Levante on Sunday."

Between them they have won 11 of the last 12 Ballons d'Or. The two heavyweights were drawn in Group G along with Dynamo Kiev of Ukraine and Ferencvaros, the Hungarian club returning to the group stage for the first time in quarter of a century. ""The match against Barcelona will be a great challenge and it will be fascinating because it confronts those who, in my opinion, are still the two best players in the world,"" said Juventus vice president Pavel Nedved. Meanwhile, beaten 2020 finalists Paris Saint-Germain will have a chance for revenge against Manchester United, who ousted the French club in the last 16 two seasons ago. PSG will also come up against RB Leipzig in Group H. The sides met in last season's semi-finals in Lisbon in August, with Paris winning 3-0 before losing to Bayern Munich in their first ever final appearance. Completing the group is Istanbul Basaksehir, who are appearing in the tournament proper for the first time. English Premier League champions Liverpool, who won the Champions League in 2019, will face Ajax as well as Atalanta and Midtjylland of Denmark in Group D. Holders Bayern will take on Atletico Madrid and will also have a short trip across the border to Austria to take on Salzburg in Group A. Lokomotiv Moscow are other team in the section. ""The pressure is on you straight away in the Champions League when you are the holders,"" pointed out Bayern's Thomas Mueller. Manchester City will face Porto, Marseille and Olympiakos in Group C as they continue their hunt for a first European Cup. Other notable match-ups will see 13-time European champions Real Madrid meet Inter Milan in Group B and Chelsea come up against debutants Rennes as well as Europa League winners Sevilla in Group E. Chelsea signed goalkeeper Edouard Mendy from Rennes last week. The group stage starts on October 20, and all six rounds of games will be crammed into eight weeks in a schedule that is even more packed than usual because of the coronavirus pandemic. UEFA will release the fixture schedule on Friday, when the draw for the Europa League also takes place. This season's final is scheduled to be staged on May 29 in Istanbul, which was initially the host for last season's final before UEFA was forced into a change of plans because of the health crisis. UEFA has said that teams playing in the Champions League and Europa League will be able to open stadiums to up to 30 percent capacity, subject to the approval of local authorities. Away fans will not be allowed ""until further notice"", but the announcement that limited crowds can return will be welcomed after last season's Champions League and Europa League were both completed behind closed doors."

Dest will offer competition at right-back after Nelson Semedo was sold to Wolves. He made 35 appearances for Ajax last season, after making his debut in July. The United States international becomes Barcelona's fifth arrival of the transfer window, joining Miralem Pjanic, Trincao, Pedri and Matheus Fernandes in moving to Camp Nou. The signing also continues the club's attempts to refresh the squad. ""It's a matter of changing things, having young players for the future of this Barca,"" said Ronald Koeman on Wednesday, when asked about Dest. Barcelona's statement added: ""Sergino Dest combines many excellent qualities needed in a full back: attacking when called for, solid defensively, unruffled in possession and creative with it. ""The defender has the ability to take players on and his pace is a virtue going forward and defending. Those qualities will be on display from now on in a Barca shirt, a challenge for a fearless young full back."""

The Spanish press reported last year that Spanish tax authorities were pursuing Neymar for fiscal fraud dating back to his time at Barcelona, but it is the first time that the information has been officially confirmed. The Spanish tax office, contacted by AFP, did not say whether Neymar's presence on the list was linked to his 2013 transfer to Barcelona from Brazilian club Santos. But it said that to appear on the list of the highest debtors the individuals had to fulfil several criteria, including missing the final deadline to pay the debt."
77,30/09/2020,14:57,"Messi's happiness not in my hands, says Koeman",Barcelona coach Ronald Koeman has said Lionel Messi's happiness is not in his hands but admits he was pleased to hear the Argentine saying on Tuesday he wants to end his disputes with the club.,"Koeman also confirmed Ajax defender Sergino Dest is ""almost certain"" to join Barca, with the 19-year-old expected to complete his medical on Wednesday before completing the move. The signing of Dest would continue the shake-up at Barcelona, who have allowed Luis Suarez, Ivan Rakitic, Arturo Vidal and Nelson Semedo all to leave as they try to reduce the wage bill and refresh their squad. Messi was forced to stay and expressed his disappointment at the way Suarez was pushed out to Atletico Madrid but in an interview with Diario Sport published on Tuesday, the 33-year-old said he wanted to ""put an end"" to the ""disagreements"". ""I don't know if after Messi's words I will have a quiet life as coach of Barcelona, I don't think so, there is always something, but of course it is very positive that the captain has come out like that asking us to be united,"" Koeman said in a press conference on Wednesday. ""This was very positive and hopefully everything will be a bit quieter than it has been recently."" Koeman was asked if he thinks Messi is happy at Barcelona. ""I don't know if I have that sort of thing in my hands. As a coach we have to look to make a better team for him, where he can shine, and look for a position in the team where he can deliver the best performances that he has always delivered for this club. ""I have seen in these four weeks that he lives for football, even in training matches he does everything to win and I think that winning matches is the remedy for Leo to be happy in this team."" Dest will offer competition at right-back after Semedo was sold to Wolves. ""Sergino is doing his medical and still the contract has to be signed so until he has signed, I prefer not to give an opinion,"" Koeman said. ""But it's almost certain that he will be here and then we will have a young full-back. It's also a matter of changing things, having young players for the future of this Barca."" Koeman said the future of Ousmane Dembele, who has been linked with a move to Manchester United before the end of the transfer window, is not up to him. ""The first thing to say is it's up to the club and the player,"" said Koeman. ""While the player is with us, I am going to count on him. He has not played the last match because there are other players and Ansu (Fati) has shown he is a very good player for this team so he has to wait for his chance to play. ""He was better physically in the first few weeks, he had a little dip last week, but today he has trained well, so I want to say I am counting on him."" Barcelona play away at Celta Vigo on Thursday after winning their opening La Liga game 4-0 against Villarreal on Sunday."
78,29/09/2020,03:05,"Fati soars, Jovic disappoints, optimism for Atletico: La Liga talking points","Real Madrid, Barcelona and Atletico Madrid will all be hoping to build on their first wins of the season as La Liga heads into its fourth round of games this week.","Here, AFP looks at five talking points ahead of the midweek fixtures. For the first time in a long time, Barcelona can enjoy some calm after a 4-0 win over Villarreal in their first match of the season on Sunday. Lionel Messi scored on his first competitive appearance since attempting to leave in the summer but most exciting was the performance of the 17-year-old Ansu Fati, who scored twice and won a penalty. Ronald Koeman must decide how to make the most of the teenager, whose maturity on the pitch belies his age and whose body might not be ready to start every week. But Fati's pace, movement and decision-making are all so impressive it will be difficult to leave him out, as Barca look to build on that win at Celta Vigo on Thursday. Real Madrid coach Zinedine Zidane switched to a 4-4-2 formation during his team's 3-2 win at Real Betis on Saturday as Luka Jovic was deployed up front alongside Karim Benzema. But the Serbian striker failed to take his chance, instead enduring another underwhelming night before going off with 18 minutes to go. It remains to be seen whether Zidane persists with Jovic at home to Real Valladolid on Wednesday, or at all, given Madrid could yet decide to let their 60 million-euro (today $70 million) signing leave before the end of the transfer window. When Eden Hazard regains fitness, that spot next to Benzema will belong to the Belgian so Jovic's window of opportunity may be small. Time would appear to be running out. Atletico scored 19 fewer goals than champions Real Madrid last season and 35 fewer than Barcelona. So hitting six against Granada on Sunday offered some early encouragement that this season's Atletico, boosted by the arrival of Luis Suarez in attack, can put those scoring problems behind them. Suarez stole the show after scoring twice on his debut but Joao Felix was arguably the biggest plus for Diego Simeone, who will hope the 20-year-old's excellent display is the start of a more consistent campaign. Atletico go up against newly-promoted Huesca on Wednesday, the kind of game they slipped up in too often last season. Even defeat by Real Madrid could not knock Real Betis off the top of the table, as Manuel Pellegrini's team enjoy the benefits of a strong start and more games played than the traditional powerhouses three weeks into the season. But there is cause for optimism longer-term as Betis began with wins against Alaves and Real Valladolid, before matching Madrid for prolonged spells until their opponents pulled away in the second half. With the likes of Nabil Fekir, Sergio Canales and Joaquin, this Betis squad has not lacked for attacking talent but solidity at the back has too often been an afterthought. On Tuesday they travel to Getafe, looking to prove they can be harder to break down against one of the division's best defensive sides and a potential rival for Europe. Villarreal face Alaves on Wednesday, with pressure already on both coaches. Villarreal have four points from their opening three games but a 4-0 hammering at the hands of Barcelona on Sunday, as well as a draw at home to newly-promoted Huesca means Unai Emery could do with a victory. Alaves, meanwhile, are second bottom after managing just a point from their first three games, with Pablo Machin seeking a first win at la Ceramica. Valencia have also made a stuttering start, a draw at home to Huesca on Saturday coming on the back of a surprise loss away at Celta Vigo. New coach Javi Gracia has already expressed disappointment with the club's summer transfer dealings, meaning credit with the board may be lacking if results do not improve. They play away at Real Sociedad on Tuesday."
79,26/09/2020,15:07,Koeman says he has no doubts about Messi,"Barcelona coach Ronald Koeman has said he has no concerns about Lionel Messi ahead of their first La Liga game of the season on Sunday, after the Argentinian took another swipe at the club over the departure of Luis Suarez.","Koeman was also keen to point out it was not solely his decision to let Suarez join Atletico Madrid, with the Dutchman insisting he is not the ""bad guy in the movie"". Messi criticised how Suarez was pushed out as Barca try to reduce their wage bill, saying ""you deserved a goodbye for what you are"" before adding: ""But at this point nothing surprises me anymore"". Barcelona play Villarreal on Sunday at Camp Nou and Messi is expected to start, having reintegrated with the squad since claiming he was denied a transfer this summer. Koeman said in a press conference on Saturday he was not worried about Messi, despite his captain's latest show of frustration. ""It is normal for a player to be a bit sad when a friend of theirs leaves after the years that they have had together, it is part of football,"" said Koeman. ""But the most important thing for me is how he has been. In training and in games, I think Leo has been an example for everyone, in his commitment to the club and to the team. I have no doubts about Leo in this regard."" Suarez scored 198 goals for Barcelona to become their third highest goalscorer in history but the 33-year-old was deemed expendable after the team's disastrous end to last season. Koeman was reported to have held a direct and short telephone conversation with Suarez about his future but Barca's new coach claims the decision was not only his. ""At first it was like I was the bad guy in the movie,"" said Koeman. ""It's not like that because from the first day or after my call with Luis I showed respect for the player and the person he is. ""He trained to the maximum from the first day and I always told him it could be difficult for him to play but if he stayed he would be one of the squad and could work like the others. ""That's what I told the club too but these are decisions made by the club. Before signing the contract the club was thinking about changing things and I have tried to support those decisions. ""But it was not only my decision as a manager, they are decisions of the club as well."" Suarez follows Ivan Rakitic, Nelson Semedo and Arturo Vidal in leaving Barcelona this summer but the club have struggled to afford replacements. ""The economic situation of the club is very complicated and it could be that they can't bring in what I want,"" said Koeman. ""I knew that and I accept it and if I stay with these players, I will work very hard to improve them."""
80,25/09/2020,14:58,"'Nothing surprises me anymore,' says Messi lamenting Suarez departure","Lionel Messi said on Friday the way Luis Suarez had been let go was another sign of problems at Barcelona but ""the truth is nothing surprises me anymore.""","The day after the Uruguayan striker had bid tearful goodbyes to Barcelona after the club sent him to Atletico Madrid, Messi expressed his sadness and dismay. ""You deserved to be sent off as what you are: one of the most important players in the history of the club,"" Messi wrote. ""And not to be fired in the way they did it."" Suarez replied to Messi's post by praising the Argentine and aiming veiled criticism at Barca's management. ""You are the number, don't let a few people blur what a giant you are for the club and for the world of football,"" wrote Suarez. Neymar, who completed the MSN attacking trio from 2014-2017 before leaving for Paris Saint-Germain, joined the thread with a terse: ""Incredible how they do things."" Messi has a long-running feud with club president Josep Maria Bartomeu which intensified after they were humiliated 8-2 by Bayern in a Champions League quarter-final in August. Messi tried to force his exit before accepting he would have to see out the final year of his contract. Meanwhile, two of his closest friends on the team, Suarez and the Chilean Arturo Vidal have left. Monaco midfielder Cesc Fabregas, who had two spells at the Camp Nou, told a press conference he was unhappy at the way some players had been treated by Barcelona. ""We are talking about players who gave their lives for Barca,"" he said. ""It makes me sad."" ""Football isn't just about what's on the pitch. Behind the scenes there are many things, and above all people."" ""The club is going through difficult times,"" Fabregas said, before pointing out that Bartomeu faced an election soon. ""I think a lot will change. I hope that the club will be better."" The 33-year-old Suarez completed his medical in Madrid on Friday and joined Atletico on a two-year deal. ""I'm going to keep playing, with fresh motivation, with the objective to show I can continue competing,"" Suarez said. On Thursday, Suarez, who scored 198 goals for Barca to become the third highest goalscorer in club history, cried as he bid an impromptu farewell to the club. Messi's was also sentimental on Friday. ""Today I went into the dressing room and the awful truth hit me,"" Messi posted. Messi and Suarez were neighbours in the beachside suburb of Castelldefels and would arrive at training together. ""How difficult it is going to be not to continue to share the days with you, both on the pitch and off it"" wrote Messi in a post accompanied by seven pictures of the two men together, sometimes with their families. ""We are going to miss you very much. It's been many years, many cups of mate, lunches, dinners...Many things that I will never forget."" ""I love you very much, I love you very much. See you soon, my friend."" Suarez responded in a similar tone. ""Thank you, my friend, for your words, but more than that, thank you for being the way you are, for what you were from the first day with me and my family,"" wrote Suarez. ""I will always be grateful to the human Messi, the funny and sentimental one, because everybody knows about the player."" Barcelona will face Suarez's new club at least twice, in La Liga, this season. ""It's going to be weird to see you with another shirt and much more to face you,"" wrote Messi. ""But I wish you all the best in this new challenge."" Suarez had already pointed out that the two have faced each other in before in highly-charged games. ""I've already played against him in the Uruguay-Argentina matches, playing against each other is not going to change the feelings we have for each other,"" Suarez said."
81,25/09/2020,03:23,Koeman's revolution needs instant results as Barca start against Villarreal,"Barcelona have kept Lionel Messi, discarded Luis Suarez and hired Ronald Koeman but the new era begins against Villarreal on Sunday when change must bring results.","A shortened break has not made it any easier for Barca, who are attempting in a matter of weeks the kind of renovation most elite clubs would give themselves years to carry out. Forty-four days will have passed since they were humiliated by Bayern Munich in the Champions League, the match that was followed by their coach being sacked and greatest ever player trying to leave. Messi was forced to stay and the early indications are he will make good on his promise to give his all this season, as Barcelona look to wrestle back the title lost to Real Madrid in July. On his first day back, Messi arrived more than an hour early and in his first week, he trained on the team's days off in what looked like an effort to make up for lost time. He has played in all three friendlies and scored twice in the second, when a hand clasp with Koeman was poured over by the Spanish press and was generally taken as a positive step. ""He is excited about Koeman's project,"" Barcelona president Josep Maria Bartomeu told TV3 last week. ""The important thing is he plays for Barca, at his home. We want him to retire at the club."" But it is hard to imagine Messi's thinking has dramatically changed since he angrily admitted defeat in his pursuit of a clause in his contract he thought allowed him to depart for free. He has watched on as Suarez, his best friend, neighbour and third highest goalscorer in the club's history, found out through the media his time was up, able eventually to join title rivals Atletico Madrid on Wednesday. Arturo Vidal, another close friend of Messi's, has also been let go, sent to Inter Milan for next to nothing. And Bartomeu, whom Messi has blamed for the decline in recent years, remains, insistent he has no intention of resigning. As well as Suarez and Vidal, Ivan Rakitic and Nelson Semedo have gone while only youngsters - Trincao, Pedri and Matheus Fernandes - have come in, as well as the 30-year-old Miralem Pjanic, whose swap with Arthur Melo was confirmed in June. Instead, renewal is likely to come not from a change of personnel but the system and pecking order. Koeman looks ready to deploy a 4-2-3-1 with the two holding midfielders picked from Pjanic, Frenkie de Jong and Sergio Busquets, with Busquets perhaps set to be most regularly left out. Up front Antoine Griezmann will take over from Suarez as partner-in-chief to Messi, potentially with Messi as the central striker and Griezmann just behind. Ansu Fati, Ousmane Dembele, Trincao and Philippe Coutinho are expected to be the main contenders for the attacking spots out wide. The 19-year-old American international Konrad de la Fuente has also impressed. There will be little change in defence, where Semedo's exit has left the club searching for a new right-back but Jordi Alba, Clement Lenglet and Gerard Pique will continue ahead of Marc-Andre ter Stegen. For Koeman, there may be some patience with teething problems early on but not much. If Messi had gone, there would have been more. Koeman only needs to look at his predecessor Quique Setien to know reform must be accompanied by results. Like Setien, Koeman's authority is already fragile given presidential elections in March could bring a new regime, who in turn could bring their own coach. Those elections could even happen sooner if a vote of no confience against Bartomeu is passed by the club's members next month. Change at the top would certainly encourage Messi but the Argentinian's happiness is likely to be most connected with performances on the pitch. Barcelona, and Koeman, need a good start."

He leaves as the club's third highest scorer with 198 goals behind Cesar Rodriguez (232) and Lionel Messi (634). The move to Barcelona's La Liga rivals follows a failed attempt to join Juventus. Juve coach Andrea Pirlo disclosed last week a deal was unlikely because of delays in the Uruguayan's bid to get an Italian passport. On Tuesday, prosecutors in Perugia said they suspected Suarez of cheating to pass his Italian language test with the aid of examiners suspected of helping him. The exit of the 33-year-old from Camp Nou comes as Koeman attempts to reshape Barcelona. As well as Suarez, the Dutchman has shown the exit to Arturo Vidal and Ivan Rakitic, while French defender Samuel Umtiti is also set to leave.

Catalan daily Sport confirmed: ""Luis Suarez left the Sant Joan Despi training centre in tears. The Uruguayan player greeted his teammates for his last training before signing his exit papers."" ""At the end of the session the Uruguayan said goodbye to those who were his teammates over the past six years,"" Spanish sports daily Marca reported. At the start of the week Marca endorsed an earlier report on RAC1 radio announcing that the 33-year-old was ""no longer a Barcelona player"". It said that he decided to forgo a percentage of this season's salary in return for being allowed to leave. All the signs are that he is poised to join Diego Simeone's Atletico, who like Barca make their La Liga seasonal bow this weekend. ""It's done, Luis Suarez is going to Atletico,"" Marca announced on its front page on Wednesday. Suarez's days at Barca were numbered ever since new coach Ronald Koeman included him in a list of players he said he wouldn't be counting on for the new season.

Local prosecutor Raffaele Cantone, a former head of Italy's National Anti-Corruption Authority, had been carrying out an investigation since February into University for Foreigners officials over various irregularities. Suspicions over Suarez were aroused by an overheard conversation. ""But what do you think, that we're going to fail him? Today I have the last lesson (with Suarez) and I have to prepare it because he barely speaks a word"" of Italian, Stefania Spina, one of the people targeted by the investigation, is claimed to have said according to prosecution documents cited by Italian media. Asked by a colleague what level Suarez ""should pass"" in Italian, Spina reportedly replied: ""He should not, he must, he will pass, because with a salary of 10 million (euros) per season, you can't make him fail"" his exam, ""even if he doesn't know how to conjugate verbs and speak in the infinitive.""

A vote will then be held and if two thirds of voting members go against Bartomeu, he will have to step down, with an election held perhaps as early as January. ""Right now, no-one is considering resigning,"" said Bartomeu. ""The club is not going to stop. The board is surprised by the number of signatures but we respect democracy and the club's laws."" Bartomeu said the club are still trying to freshen up the squad before the transfer window closes on October 5 but admitted there are financial constraints. ""Barca, like many clubs in Europe, has less income,"" said Bartomeu. ""We cannot sell tickets, the museum is closed. We suffer from a lack of resources and we have to adapt."" ""At the moment there is no space for new players to arrive if others do not leave,"" he added."
86,18/09/2020,15:53,Guardiola has no complaints despite missing out on Messi,Pep Guardiola said Friday that only Lionel Messi knows if a move to Manchester City is a possibility next year after the Argentine reluctantly decided to stay at Barcelona this season.,"In an explosive interview earlier this month, Messi blasted Barcelona president Josep Maria Bartomeu, accusing him of not keeping his promise to allow him to leave for free at the end of the last campaign. Instead, Messi was forced to stay or face a court battle with the club he has played for his entire career. City were believed to be in the driving seat to sign the six-time Ballon d'Or winner if he left Catalonia. ""I don't have to explain anything. I think Leo explained quite well his feelings, I don't have anything to add,"" Guardiola said ahead of City's first game of the new season, away to Wolves on Monday. ""He is a Barcelona player, the club I love and (I have) nothing more to say."" Messi will be able to leave Barca for free next summer but his former coach Guardiola, who was Barcelona's most successful-ever manager with 14 trophies in four years between 2008 and 2012, is in the dark over whether he is keen to come to Manchester. ""I don't know,"" he said. ""I cannot talk about the intentions from other people."" In the aftermath of Messi's U-turn, City's summer transfer business in bringing in Ferran Torres from Valencia and Nathan Ake from relegated Bournemouth seems underwhelming. Guardiola's men won just the League Cup last season as they finished 18 points behind runaway champions Liverpool. But after spending hundreds of millions during four years in charge at Abu-Dhabi backed City, Guardiola insisted he had no complaints over the lack of signings so far in the window. ""Since day one when I arrive here, I am more than satisfied with what I had in the team and I know the club do absolutely everything not just for me, for the team, for all of us to do our best,"" he said. ""What is going to happen will happen. If we stay with the players we have, I will be happy. I never am going to complain about this. I am a lucky person to have these players to be in this club."" Sergio Aguero will miss the start of the season due to a long-term knee injury, while Aymeric Laporte will also be absent on Monday due to a lack of pre-season training after testing positive for coronavirus."
87,17/09/2020,19:15,Bartomeu to face vote of no confidence from Barcelona members,Barcelona president Josep Maria Bartomeu is set to face a vote of no confidence after a petition to remove him gained the required number of signatures from members on Thursday.,"If the signatures are approved, a vote will be held in October, when two thirds of those voting must go against the current board in order to trigger presidential elections. Those elections would take place some time between November and January, an advance on the current schedule, which will not see them happening until March. Bartomeu and his regime have overseen a period of chaos and decline at Barca, which culminated in Lionel Messi trying to leave the club this summer. Messi accused the board of having ""no project or anything for a long time"". He also said Bartomeu had ""broken his word"" over a clause in his contract that Messi claimed allowed him to go for free. The Argentina forward could still depart when his contract expires next summer but a different board could change his thinking before he is able to negotiate with other clubs in January. Victor Font, one of the leading rival candidates to become Barcelona's president, has linked his candidacy to the arrival of Xavi Hernandez, Messi's former teammate, as coach. The motion against Bartomeu was brought forward by 'Mes Que Una Mocio' (More Than A Motion), who announced on Thursday they had 20,731 signatures, significantly more than the 16,520 needed to reach the second stage. The signatures will be presented to the club for approval later on Thursday."

The Argentine scored his first after 45 minutes, spinning on the edge of the penalty area and drilling a shot in off the base of the far post. He scored his second, with a deflected shot, after 50 minutes. He went off after an hour. Messi only returned to training at the start of last week after saying he wanted to leave the club. Messi started Barcelona's first friendly on Saturday, playing 45 minutes without scoring in a 3-1 victory over third-tier Gimnastica Tarragona. Earlier on Wednesday, La Liga president Javier Tebas said he was pleased Messi had stayed at Barcelona. ""Messi is important for our competition,"" said Tebas, at an event to promote the Liga sticker collection. ""He is a player who was born in our competition... and hopefully he will finish his career in our league."" Barcelona used 20 players in Wednesday's game at the club's training centre but neither Uruguayan forward Luis Suarez nor Chilean Arturo Vidal appeared. Barcelona are due to start their league campaign on September 26 or 27 against Villarreal."

Responding on Twitter, Aulas said: ""The president of Barcelona told me on Sunday that Barca are really suffering from the Covid crisis and were not able to make an offer."" Koeman has been on the hunt for a striker after telling Uruguayan Luis Suarez he wasn't in his plans for the coming season. Depay played an important role in Lyon's progress to the Champions League semi-final and scored a hat-trick in their opening Ligue 1 win of the season over Dijon. However, he had announced that he did not wish to extend his Lyon contract, which expires next summer, and has never hidden his desire to play ""for a bigger club"".

""All 25 of us will be important and I believe in the spirit of the group."" Pjanic's transfer from Juve to Barcelona was part of a financial operation involving Arthur Melo going the other way, allowing both clubs to boost their profit figures for the year. Barca said they paid 60 million euros ($67.4m) plus a potential five million euros in bonuses for the Bosnian playmaker while Juventus would pay 72 million euros plus 10 million in variables for Arthur. ""Leaving Juve was difficult,"" said Pjanic. ""I have left an incredible club but a footballer always wants to grow and have new challenges. After nine years in Italy I needed new goals and Barca was my dream."" Sitting alongside Pjanic was Barcelona's new sporting director Ramon Planes, who was asked about the future of Luis Suarez. Suarez was not included in Ronald Koeman's squad on Saturday for a friendly against Gimnastic Tarragona, with the club keen for the Uruguayan to leave. ""Luis has been an important player for Barca in recent years and for this he deserves the utmost respect,"" said Planes. ""Since the end of the season we have been fully involved in a process of change, with the coach and our ideas. ""But we must respect, above all, the players and their contracts.

93,15/09/2020,13:04,Messi joins exclusive club of sporting billionaires,"Lionel Messi may have had to stay put at Barcelona but the Argentine legend did succeed in joining one new club this year -- the one reserved for sporting billionaires, according to Forbes magazine.","The Argentine striker's career earnings of over one billion dollars (840 million euros) places the six-time Ballon d'Or winner in a group of mega-wealthy sports figures containing just Tiger Woods, Floyd Mayweather and his great rival on the pitch, Cristiano Ronaldo. Forbes said that in 2020 Messi was the best paid footballer in the world with an income of $126 million from his Barca salary ($92 million for the 2020/2021 season) and $34 million from sponsors and other sources. The 33-year-old knocked Juventus forward Ronaldo ($117 million) off the top of the football salary chart with Paris Saint-Germain's Neymar ($96 million) in third place. Forbes' top 10 earning players made a combined $570 million this season, a jump of 11 percent despite the disruption caused by the coronavirus pandemic to European leagues and the global economy. Michael Jordan is also in the billionaire's club but the basketball legend's fortune has largely come after retirement through his longstanding contract with Nike and acquisition of NBA franchise Charlotte Hornets. Messi remains at Barcelona this season after conceding defeat in his attempt to leave without triggering his 700-million euro release."

Messi only returned to pre-season training on Monday and has worked on the squad's days off as he tries to make up for lost time following a chaotic few weeks. Koeman said last month he only hoped to keep players who wanted to be at the club and he then held a meeting with Messi, in which he reportedly took a hard line with the Argentinian. But after Messi's explosive interview with Goal last week, in which he said he had been forced to stay but pledged to give his all for the team, Koeman struck a more conciliatory tone on Friday. ""I have already said it several times that Messi is the best,"" said Koeman. ""Messi when he is physically fit is a very important player as he has shown for many years and I hope he can repeat it this year."" Earlier on Friday, Barcelona's vice president Pau Vilanova said the club had taken heed of Messi's criticism after the 33-year-old expressed his frustration with the direction of the team. It is the first time someone on the Barca board has spoken publicly since Messi declared his position. ""We are very happy that Messi is with us and has joined this exciting project,"" said Vilanova on Friday. ""You have to take his words into consideration and for this reason we are starting a recovery. For this reason we are beginning a new, fresh and exciting project.""

""In this case he will continue and he will be motivated."" Messi was particularly critical of Barcelona's president Josep Maria Bartomeu, whom he accused of going back on his word over an agreement to let him leave. ""We hope and wish that there is a respect and togetherness so the club can function,"" said Vilanova. ""Obviously, there are people from the club who are talking to him."" After Barcelona's historic 8-2 defeat by Bayern Munich in the Champions League, Bartomeu brought forward the presidential elections, which will be held on March 20 and 21. But more than 7,500 members have signed a petition to be rid of him sooner, with 16,500 signatures needed to trigger a vote of no confidence. ""We have set the date of the assembly and the elections,"" added Vilanova. ""In short, we are working for the good of Barca."" Despite the controversy over Messi and the dismal end to last season, Koeman insists the mood in the squad is good. ""It has been very positive,"" he said. ""The players are working very well, there is a lot of intensity in training. ""We have become more physical and now we have to work more on tactics but in all training sessions the players have shown a lot of encouragement, interest and intensity and that is very important because you play as you train.

Fati is unlikely though to feature in Barca's friendly against Gimnastic Tarragaona on Saturday. They then have two more friendlies against Elche and Girona before beginning the season against Villarreal at the end of the month. Fati is one of the most exciting prospects for the new campaign in La Liga. He scored on his first start for Spain on Sunday against Ukraine to become the country's youngest ever scorer at the age of 17 and 311 days."

A club statement reported that others returning to the main group were Philippe Coutinho, Sergio Busquets, Frenkie de Jong and Ansu Fati. Messi faces another season with the Catalan club after losing his stand-off with Barca president Josep Maria Bartomeu over a 700 million-euro release clause. Koeman's first match in charge since replacing Quique Setien in the aftermath of last month's humiliating 8-2 Champions League pounding by Bayern Munich is a friendly against third division opposition on Saturday."
98,06/09/2020,22:55,Fati makes history as Spain thump Ukraine,Ansu Fati became the youngest goalscorer in the history of the Spanish national team on Sunday by scoring in Spain's 4-0 win over Ukraine.,"Aged 17 years and 311 days, Fati scored in the 32nd minute at the Alfredo di Stefano Stadium, when he cut in from the left and curled into the bottom corner. It came after a spell-binding opening half an hour from the youngster, whose driving run had already earned a penalty for Sergio Ramos to convert. Ramos then headed in to make it two before Fati made history on his first start for Spain, beating the country's previous youngest scorer, Juan Errazquin, who scored three goals aged 18 against Switzerland in 1925. Manchester City's new signing Ferran Torres made it four late on as Spain registered their first victory in this season's Nations League to go top of League A's Group 4. Luis Enrique's side had opened with a 1-1 draw on Thursday against Germany, whose second game ended in another 1-1 draw away at Switzerland. Fati impressed off the bench against Germany, enough to be handed his first start by Luis Enrique on the left of Spain's front three. He took his chance by putting on a mesmerising display, the only shame that there were no fans in the stadium to see it. ""At that age it's easy to get birds in your head,"" said Luis Enrique afterwards. ""But he is mature enough to know that the path he is taking is the best to take as a player. He's quiet and humble."" Fati is now the youngest player to score for Spain, for Barca in La Liga and the youngest to score in the Champions League as well. ""When we choose the squad, we don't look at the age,"" Luis Enrique added. ""That doesn't mean you don't have to understand that he's going to play bad games and he's going to make lots of mistakes. It's part of learning but that kind of confidence isn't normal."" Born in Guinea-Bissau, Fati and his family moved to Seville when he was a young boy. He joined Barcelona's La Masia academy aged 10 and made his first team debut at the start of last season, becoming the second youngest player ever to play for the club. He became the their youngest ever scorer in La Liga after scoring off the bench versus Osasuna and then scored on his first start for the Catalans too, against Valencia in September, aged 16. The next day, Barcelona newspaper Mundo Deportivo wrote ""A star is born"" and he continued breaking records by hitting the winner against Inter Milan in the Champions League in December. Fati was expected to be given his debut for Spain earlier this year but he had to wait as fixtures were postponed due to the coronavirus pandemic. Ukraine never got to grips with the winger, who won a penalty in the third minute, converted by Ramos, and then almost scored with a bicycle kick. He fired wide of the far post after another darting dribble down the left and after Ramos headed in, he finally scored, cutting in from the left and ripping the ball into the far bottom corner. Spain eased up in the second half but there was still time for a fourth, Torres finishing well at the back post to cap a memorable night."

100,05/09/2020,12:09,Messi concedes defeat in Barcelona battle but future still in doubt,Lionel Messi's grudging acceptance that he will have to stay put at Barcelona after losing his stand-off with club president Josep Maria Bartomeu has left the Argentine superstar's future still in doubt.,"The 33-year-old, who was absent from Barcelona training on Saturday the day after announcing he would reluctantly stay at the club, launched a stinging attack on Bartomeu claiming he had broken his word to let him leave. The absence of any new contract means that even if he is not allowed to leave this summer, Messi could enter negotiations with other teams from January 1 and leave for free when his current deal expires in July. The feeling that Messi's reluctant decision was by no means the end of the affair was clear in Spanish daily Marca's headline: ""Messi stays, the crisis too"". Bartomeu could yet respond with his resignation, having previously indicated he would step down if Messi publicly said he was the problem and agreed to stay. ""It has been a long time since there has been a project or anything at all,"" Messi said in what another sports daily Mundo Deportivo described as his ""devastating"" interview with Goal on Friday. ""They are always juggling and plugging gaps."" Messi believed he had a clause in his contract that meant he could leave for free at the end of last season but Barca said that option expired on June 10. ""The president always said that at the end of the season I could decide if I wanted to go or if I wanted to stay and in the end he didn't end up keeping his word,"" Messi said. ""And this is the reason why I am going to continue in the club... because the president told me that the only way to leave was to pay the 700-million-euro release clause."" He described that as ""impossible"", adding that he could never take ""the club that I love"" to court. Messi failed to appear at Barca's Joan Gamper training complex for Saturday's training session attended by players including Gerard Pique, Jordi Alba and Philippe Coutinho. According to local media, he must first pass the Covid-19 test he deliberately missed last Sunday with a return to the squad possibly on Monday. He could then figure in new coach Ronald Koeman's first fixture, a friendly against third division Nastic on September 12. Barcelona responded to Messi's pledge by posting a picture of the striker on Instagram in the club's new kit, with the caption: ""I'm going to give my best. My love for Barça will never change"". Messi had requested to leave the club he joined as a boy following Barcelona's humiliating 8-2 defeat to Bayern Munich in the Champions League, with Abu Dhabi-backed Manchester City the favourites to sign him. His lawyers sent Barca a burofax on August 25 stating his intention to depart but Messi insisted he had he made his feelings clear to Bartomeu long before. ""I told the club, especially the president, that I wanted to go,"" said Messi. ""I've been telling him all year. I believed it was time to step aside. ""I believed that the club needed more young people, new people and I thought my time in Barcelona was over, feeling very sorry because I always said that I wanted to finish my career here. ""It was a very difficult year, I suffered a lot in training, in games and in the dressing room. Everything became very difficult for me and there came a time when I considered looking for new goals, new horizons. ""It wasn't because of the Champions League result against Bayern, I had been thinking about it for a long time. I told the president and the president always said that at the end of the season I could decide if I wanted to go or if I wanted to stay and in the end he did not end up keeping his word."" Barcelona ended the season without a trophy for the first time since 2008, which also extended Messi's unsuccessful run in the Champions League to five years. He has scored 634 goals and won 34 titles with the club that he joined as a 13-year-old and where he came through the ranks at La Masia. Despite his unhappiness at having to stay, the Argentinian insists he will give his all for the team next season under Koeman, who is trying to overhaul the squad. ""I am going to continue at Barca and my attitude is not going to change, no matter how much I have wanted to go,"" Messi said. ""There is a new coach and a new idea. That's good, but then we have to see how the team responds and if it means we can compete or not. What I can say is that I'm staying and I'm going to give my best."""
101,05/09/2020,03:44,Hometown left deflated but still hopeful after Messi snub,Rosario had dared to dream but was left disappointed after the Argentine city's most celebrated son Lionel Messi announced he was staying at Barcelona.,"When Messi told the Spanish giants last week he wanted to quit the club, some back in his home town and at Newell's Old Boys, the club where he played junior football, allowed themselves to imagine the 33-year-old superstar returning home to play for his boyhood team. Despite the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, a week ago hundreds of Newell's fans organized a joyous and colorful vehicle procession through the town under the banner: ""Your dream, our hope."" But after 10 days of anxious waiting, there was to be no fairytale homecoming. Despite Friday's deflation, many Newell's fans still believe the prodigal son will one day return home. ""No one in their right mind could imagine that he would come back now,"" Diego Schwarzstein, an endocrinologist who treated Messi as a boy, told AFP. ""I'm from Rosario, a Newell's fan and I desperately want to see him here; but for now, it's wishful thinking. ""I'm not frustrated that he's not coming now because it wasn't realistic to think about this. ""But if he retires from football without coming to Newell's, then I would feel great frustration. ""I hope that he will indulge himself -- and also give us Newell's fans that pleasure too."" The diminutive Messi left Newell's at the age of 13 as his family emigrated to Spain after Catalan giants Barcelona offered to pay for his growth hormone treatment, among other benefits. At the age of 10, he had been diagnosed with growth hormone deficiency. ""Every time there is talk of his contract renewal, we fans dream, even though we know it's very difficult because his reality is in Europe now,"" said Lisandro Leoni, a journalist and ""Leper,"" as Newell's fans are known. ""But we also know that he's a fan of this club, so we never lose hope that, at some time and even if for only one season, he'll wear our jersey."" ""We've always got that hope that Leo will wear the Newell's jersey, but we have a lot of respect for his decision,"" said Roberto Mensi, part of the group that organized the vehicle procession. ""Last week's event was a gesture of affection that we wanted to give Messi, so he would know that we love him and the doors here are always open."" As for the club itself -- a hotbed of talent that includes the likes of renowned coaches Marcelo Bielsa, Gerardo Martino and Mauricio Pochetino, who all played for the team -- it has remained tight-lipped over the issue. Messi, known as ""The Flea"" in Argentina, has always said he would love to return home to play for the club. Although he left Rosario 20 years ago, he always returns for the New Year celebrations with his family and that of his wife Antonella Roccuzzo. Locals were delighted when the couple decided to celebrate their 2017 wedding in the city, bringing over several Barcelona stars with them. A few weeks ago, Messi donated 50 ventilators to the city's hospitals to help treat patients suffering from Covid-19. He owns several homes, a luxurious apartment, an iconic bar and an exclusive country club in Rosario, the third biggest city in Argentina. Messi also still owns his simple childhood home in a middle class neighborhood that his friends have covered with murals that pay tribute to Rosario's greatest export. Newell's were founded in 1903 and named after Isaac Newell, an English teacher who pioneered football in Argentina. They have been Argentine champions six times, the last of those in 2013."
102,04/09/2020,21:19,Messi admits he is forced to stay at Barcelona but long-term future in doubt,Lionel Messi said on Friday he will stay at Barcelona but only because the club's president Josep Maria Bartomeu broke his word to let him leave.,"Messi's stinging attack on Bartomeu and the club means his future still remains in doubt. Even if he is not allowed to go this summer, 33-year-old Messi can negotiate with other teams from January 1 and leave for free when his contract expires in July. Bartomeu could yet respond with his resignation, having previously indicated he would step down if Messi publicly said he was the problem and agreed to stay. But three hours after Messi's explosive interview with Goal, Barcelona had not made any public statement. ""It has been a long time since there has been a project or anything at all,"" Messi said. ""They are always juggling and plugging gaps."" Messi believed he had a clause in his contract that meant he could leave for free at the end of last season but Barca said that option expired on June 10. ""The president always said that at the end of the season I could decide if I wanted to go or if I wanted to stay and in the end he didn't end up keeping his word,"" Messi said. ""And this is the reason why I am going to continue in the club... because the president told me that the only way to leave was to pay the 700-million-euro release clause. ""This is impossible, and then the other way was to go to trial. I would never go to court against Barca because it is the club that I love, that gave me everything since I arrived, it is the club of my life, I have made my life here."" Messi had requested to leave the club he joined as a boy following Barcelona's humiliating 8-2 defeat to Bayern Munich in the Champions League, with Manchester City the favourites to sign him. His lawyers sent Barca a burofax on August 25 stating his intention to depart but Messi says he made his feelings clear to Bartomeu long before. ""I told the club, especially the president, that I wanted to go,"" said Messi. ""I've been telling him all year. I believed it was time to step aside. ""I believed that the club needed more young people, new people and I thought my time in Barcelona was over, feeling very sorry because I always said that I wanted to finish my career here. ""It was a very difficult year, I suffered a lot in training, in games and in the dressing room. Everything became very difficult for me and there came a time when I considered looking for new goals, new horizons. ""It wasn't because of the Champions League result against Bayern, I had been thinking about it for a long time. I told the president and the president always said that at the end of the season I could decide if I wanted to go or if I wanted to stay and in the end he did not end up keeping his word."" Barcelona ended the season without a trophy for the first time since 2008, which also extended Messi's unsuccessful run in the Champions League to five years. He has scored 634 goals and won 34 titles with the club that he joined as a 13-year-old and where he came through the ranks at La Masia. Messi said his decision to leave left his wife and three sons distraught. ""When I told my family that I could go it was a drama,"" he said. ""They all started crying."" Despite his unhappiness at having to stay, the Argentinian insists he will give his all for the team next season under new coach Ronald Koeman, who is trying to overhaul the squad. ""I am going to continue at Barca and my attitude is not going to change, no matter how much I have wanted to go,"" Messi said. ""I will do my best. I always want to win, I am competitive and I don't like to lose ever."" Messi was absent from pre-season training last week as he continued to try to force a move. ""I said before we couldn't win the Champions League. Now I don't know what will happen,"" he added. ""There is a new coach and a new idea. That's good, but then we have to see how the team responds and if it means we can compete or not. What I can say is that I'm staying and I'm going to give my best."""
103,04/09/2020,14:59,"Messi release clause not valid, Jorge Messi tells La Liga","Jorge Messi, the father and agent of Lionel Messi, published a response to La Liga on Friday, insisting the Barcelona striker's 700-million-euro release clause no longer applies.","Messi senior claims the release clause is removed once the player takes up the option in his contract to leave for free, which Messi's side believe he did when he notified Barca by burofax on August 25. In the letter addressed to La Liga president Javier Tevas, Jorge Messi claims to quote a clause in Messi's contract that says: ""This release clause will not apply when the player's decision to unilaterally rescind the contract takes effect from the end of the 2019-2020 season."" La Liga had backed up Barcelona's position last weekend by announcing that Messi's release clause remains valid. And the Spanish league reacted almost immediately by reiterating their stance and saying Jorge Messi's interpretation of the contract was ""out of context"" and ""far removed"" from its wording. Jorge Messi's bullish statement indicates his son remains committed to leaving Barca this summer, despite suggestions the 33-year-old's stance could be softening. However, there has been no overt declaration that Messi will still depart, perhaps offering some hope to Barcelona supporters. The validity of the release clause in Messi's contract is important because its existence means Messi could be liable to pay the amount himself if he joined another club but lost a subsequent legal battle in court. Barcelona believe the option in the player's contract that allowed him to leave for free expired on June 10. Messi's side insist the deadline was the end of the season, which was extended into August due to the pandemic. Notably, Jorge Messi did not mention a specific date when quoting that clause in his statement. ""We do not know which contract you have analysed and what is the basis that leads you to conclude there was an applicable release clause if the player decided to unilaterally end his contract at the end of the 19-20 season,"" he wrote. He adds that it was an ""obvious error on your part"". Messi's father had held talks with Barcelona president Josep Maria Bartomeu on Thursday but both sides reiterated their arguments and no agreement was reached."
104,03/09/2020,14:26,Messi's father says he could stay at Barca - reports,"Jorge Messi, father and agent of Lionel Messi, appeared to concede his son could remain at Barcelona this season, according to footage broadcast by Spanish media on Thursday.","Messi senior seemingly replied ""yes"" when asked by a reporter if they had considered the possibility of staying at the club for another season and then leaving for free next year, in a video recorded by Spanish TV station Cuatro. The images were captured as Jorge Messi pulled into a parking garage reportedly for another day of meetings with the family's lawyers. He had arrived in Barcelona on Wednesday, landing at the private terminal in El Prat airport on a flight from the Argentine city of Rosario. Six-time Ballon d'Or winner Messi boycotted Barcelona's first pre-season training session on Monday, as he tries to force his way out of the club he joined as a 13-year-old. Messi also failed to attend a coronavirus test at Barcelona's training ground on Sunday. Messi's father was followed throughout the city by reporters and TV crews on Wednesday, and told reporters it would be ""difficult"" for his son to stay at Barcelona. According to local reports, club directors met with Messi and his advisors for more than two hours on Wednesday, but neither party was willing to alter their stance. Further negotiations are expected to be held in due course between Barcelona and Messi's entourage, which also includes his brother Rodrigo. Barcelona insist their captain remains under contract until June 2021 and will only depart if his 700-million-euro ($833 million) release clause is activated, a stance that has been backed up by La Liga, who say that release clause still applies. But Messi and his lawyers argue he is allowed to go for free this summer according to another clause in his contract, which they claim was triggered on August 25 when a burofax stating Messi's intention to leave arrived at Camp Nou. Abu Dhabi-owned Manchester City have expressed an interest in signing him."
105,02/09/2020,21:35,"Messi has 'earned right' to leave Barca, says Ramos",Sergio Ramos said Wednesday that Lionel Messi should be allowed to decide on his future as the Argentine superstar attempts to force his way out of Barcelona after two decades at the club.,"""He has earned the right to decide his future. I don't know if he is doing it in the best way,"" Ramos said ahead of Spain's opening UEFA Nations League clash with Germany in Stuttgart. ""For Spanish football, for Barca and for us who like to beat the best, we would like him to stay."" Ramos has been one of Messi's fiercest rivals as Barca have battled it out for domestic and European dominance with the Spain captain's club side Real Madrid. The pair are roughly the same age and have both won a host of major honours as their teams shared the La Liga title almost uninterrupted over the last 16 seasons. The 34-year-old centre-back said that the departure of one of the greatest ever players would be a big blow for Spanish football. ""Leo makes the Spanish League and his team better, he makes the Clasicos more beautiful because you like to win while being against the best and he is one of the best in the world. ""He has earned the right to decide for himself."" Messi, who has been at Barca since he was 13, is in a stand-off with the Catalan giants which is threatening to descend into an expensive and bitter legal battle as the club insist a 700 million-euro ($833 million) release clause needs to be activated before he be allowed to leave. Messi boycotted Barcelona's first pre-season training session on Monday and also failed to attend a coronavirus test at Barcelona's training ground on Sunday. He and his lawyers argue he is allowed to go for free this summer according to another clause in his contract, which they claim was triggered on August 25 when a fax stating Messi's intention to leave arrived at Camp Nou. Abu Dhabi-owned Manchester City are the firm favourites to sign Messi, partly due to his previous success with City coach Pep Guardiola."
106,02/09/2020,18:41,Could a Messi departure unlock Barcelona rebuilding project?,"Barcelona would be shattered if Lionel Messi left the club he has graced since he was a boy, but could the departure of arguably the world's top player create the financial conditions to rebuild?","The Argentinian maestro, who has been with the club since he was 13, handed in a transfer request after Barca's humiliating 8-2 thrashing by Bayern Munich in the quarter-finals of the Champions League. After all the highs of his 21 years with the club, this was one step too far for Messi. The focus, naturally enough, has been on the football ramifications for Barcelona: how would a Messi exit affect them on the pitch as they try to rebuild under new coach Ronald Koeman? But equally important for the Barca board is the financial implication of allowing the 33-year-old, who earns over 100 million euros ($118 million) in salary and bonuses per year, to take his brand to another club. The Catalans, however, are in deep financial difficulty. Quite apart from the 200 million euros it claims to have ""lost"" since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, Barca have been carrying a net debt of nearly 200 million euros since 2019. The club has taken out a loan of 140 million over five years with an American investment fund to help pay off the debt. And it has a massive player payroll, reported to be 542 million euros in the 2018-2019 season. So, in simple commercial terms a transfer fee, even if well below the 700 million euros quoted in his disputed release clause, would be a welcome windfall. ""Negotiate, agree, and smile,"" wrote FC Barcelona journalist Xavier Bosch in a column in Mundo Deportivo on Tuesday, asking everyone to ""act intelligently"". That may be harder done than said in the world of football, where passion often overrules economic pragmatism. Not surprisingly the supporters do not want to see the player nicknamed La Pulga (The Flea) leave, even though his performances in the last year suggest a slight waning of his considerable powers. But his transfer could be the real starting point on and off the field for the reconstruction of a club that not so long ago was the yardstick and envy of the world. ""I like Messi a lot, but I like Barca even more,"" former club president Joan Gaspart told the Marca sports daily last week. ""It is the club that is in control, not the player. If Messi leaves for an amount lower than that of his clause, it will be more humiliating than the 8-2"" against Bayern, he said. According to Football Leaks, Messi's annual gross salary in 2018, including bonuses, was more than 100 million euros, almost double that of his former teammate Neymar. The Brazilian, who left Barcelona for Qatari-owned Paris Saint-Germain in 2017 for a world record fee of 222 million euros, is paid around 52 million euros in salary per year. ""There has been a lot of talk about the fact that Barca have a very high payroll but a large part of that sum was intended for Leo and Luis Suarez,"" economist and FC Barcelona specialist Juan Maria Gay de Liebana told AFP. So in simple terms, even if they recruit another high-profile replacement, Barcelona could slash a chunk of cash from the payroll. And that might give Koeman, who arrived in August to replace Quique Setien, some wiggle room in recruiting new players to fulfil his vision for the team. But the business of football is never as straightforward as that. ""At 854 million euros, Barca have the highest turnover among the biggest European clubs,"" said Gay de Liebana. ""The main core of their income comes from marketing (381 million euros) and TV rights (298 million euros) so it's clear that the departure of Leo Messi will negatively affect Barca's figures."" Without Messi, Gay de Liebana believes that Barca's sponsorship contracts, including deals worth 55 million per year with Rakuten and 19 million euros with Beko, could be significantly reduced. And without Messi -- and assuming a return to the days of pre-coronavirus attendances at La Liga matches -- will there still be so many tourists travelling to watch a game at Camp Nou and buying a Messi replica jersey as a souvenir? The departure of the six-time Ballon d'Or winner -- as well as the possible transfer of Suarez who, according to the press, is not in Koeman's plans for the 2020-2021 season -- would thus mark a major blow for Barca's marketing income while considerably reducing the club's payroll. With 100 million euros per year more in its coffers and a relatively cut-price replacement in the dressing room Koeman's Barca may well be able to begin the reconstructive surgery the team so urgently needs if it is to bounce back from that mauling by Bayern and regain the Spanish title from Real Madrid."
107,02/09/2020,17:15,Coutinho returns to Barca after Bayern loan spell ends,"Bayern Munich formally bid farewell to Brazil playmaker Philippe Coutinho on Wednesday after his year-long loan deal from Barcelona expired with the newly-crowned European champions declining, as expected, to sign him permanently.","""With his creativity and excellent technique, he livened up our game in this triple-winning season,"" said Bayern chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge, who made it clear last month they would not bring Coutinho to Munich permanently. The 28-year-old rebooted his career in Bavaria after a frustrating period in Barcelona following his high-profile transfer from Liverpool in 2018. Coutinho netted 11 goals, creating nine more, in 38 games for Bayern, including scoring twice in the 8-2 mauling the Germans handed his club Barcelona in the jaw-dropping Champions League quarter-final. He also came on as a second-half replacement in Bayern's 1-0 win over Paris Saint-Germain in the Lisbon final. Coutinho struggled to make the starting side in Munich once Bayern head coach Hansi Flick replaced Niko Kovac last November, preferring Thomas Mueller in the attacking midfield role at the Brazilian's expense. Having paid 8.5 million euros ($10 million) to have Coutinho on loan, Bayern opted not to use the buy option of 120 million euros. ""Making any further investments of this magnitude in these difficult economic times... are also difficult for us,"" Rummenigge said in mid-August. However, Coutinho seems to have a future in Barcelona. New head coach Ronald Koeman reportedly phoned him on Monday to assure the Brazilian he is part of his planning for the coming season."

""I didn't talk to Pep,"" Jorge Messi said. ""Not to anyone.""

Rakitic, who had a year left on his contract at the Camp Nou, spent three seasons with Sevilla and won the Europa League in the 2013/14 season right before he made his big switch in 2014. He was one of several Barcelona players who were reportedly told they were not part of new manager Ronald Koeman's plans. On Monday, Lionel Messi boycotted Barca's first pre-season training session as the striker upped the stakes in his battle to leave this summer. After skipping coronavirus tests on Sunday, Messi missed Koeman's first session in charge since being appointed last month.

Messi's attendance or absence will be his first public demonstration since the burofax that stated his intention to leave for free arrived in the offices of Camp Nou on Tuesday evening and shocked the world of football. Barcelona's newly-appointed sporting director Ramon Planes said on Wednesday the expectation was Messi would be present on Sunday for testing and then training on Monday as usual. But while Messi was initially inclined to comply and avoid escalating tensions further, his lawyers have since advised him to stay away, Catalunya Radio were reporting on Saturday. Taking part in the team's pre-season programme ahead of La Liga starting on September 12 could damage his legal case if his departure ends up being settled in court. Barcelona insist a clause included in Messi's contract that allowed him to go for free this summer had to be activated by June 10 and is therefore no longer valid. The only way Messi will be allowed to depart, the club argue, is through his release clause, set at 700 million euros ($833 million) until his contract expires on June 30, 2021. But Messi's side believe the clause refers not to a specific date but to 10 days after the end of the season, which this year was extended into August due to the pandemic, with the Champions League final only played last weekend.

The assumption will be that Messi is prepared to do whatever it takes to quit the club he joined as 13-year-old boy, and where most expected him to continue all the way through to retirement. Instead, bitterness and resentment could accompany the unthinkable process of Messi being punished by Barcelona for absence, in the form of fines or a reduction in salary.

""Which is not to sell and, if possible, to renew the contract of Messi."" Yet every stance is arguably now a negotiating ploy and Messi's return on Sunday might only offer false hope to the fans. Bartomeu made it known through the Spanish press on Thursday that he would resign if Messi said publicly that he was the problem and agreed to change his mind. But Messi has instead asked for a meeting, not to negotiate, but to begin facilitating an amicable and dignified departure. ""Messi's decision to leave Barca irreversible,"" read Diario Sport on Saturday. Manchester City remain favourites to sign the 33-year-old, whose basic salary alone amounts to around 60 million euros. If Barcelona and Messi decide to avoid a lengthy legal process, a compromise selling price of around 100 million euros could be within reach for City, while eliminating their less wealthy rivals. Messi has reportedly spoken to City coach Pep Guardiola already but others remain in the running, including Paris Saint-Germain, Inter Milan and Juventus. The Italian sides would likely require a much-reduced price to afford any deal. But Juve might view the chance to combine Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo as an historic sporting and commercial opportunity too good to pass up. All of them will be watching eagerly on Sunday."
115,28/08/2020,15:29,'No chance' Klopp rules out Liverpool move for Messi,"Jurgen Klopp said on Thursday there is ""no chance"" of Liverpool signing Lionel Messi, but the German admits the unsettled Barcelona star would be a great addition to the Premier League.","Messi has told Barcelona he wants to leave after growing unhappy with the club's problems on and off the pitch. The Argentina forward has been linked with a move to Manchester City, where he could link up with his former Barca boss Pep Guardiola. Paris Saint-Germain, Inter Milan and Juventus have also been mooted as potential destinations for Messi if he gets his wish to quit the Camp Nou. Klopp insisted he would love to have Messi, but made it clear the 33-year-old would not end up at Anfield. ""Interest? Who doesn't want to have Messi in their team? But no chance,"" Klopp told reporters. Liverpool finished 18 points ahead of second placed City last season as they won the English title for the first time since 1990. And Klopp conceded Liverpool's bid to retain the Premier League crown would clearly be under threat if Messi joined City. But the former Borussia Dortmund boss believes it would be a significant coup for English football to have one of the world's greatest ever players in the Premier League. ""It would obviously help Man City and make it more difficult to beat them,"" Klopp said. ""For the Premier League it would be great, but I am not sure the Premier League needs that boost."""
116,27/08/2020,11:22,Messi has shown he is ready to put the boot in at Barca,"Lionel Messi has provoked a football frenzy by announcing he wants to leave Barcelona, the club he joined as a 13-year-old in 2000 and has led to four Champions League titles.","This has been a season of problems, on and off the field for Barcelona, but Tuesday's declaration of divorce, though more extreme than anything in his past, is not the first sulk in Messi's 20 years at Camp Nou. Despite a reputation as a discreet and approachable team-mate, the Argentine has repeatedly lost patience with other Barca players. In September 2012, he gesticulated angrily at Spanish striker David Villa, forced to play on the wing, for failing to cross the ball quickly enough against Granada in La Liga. Messi's gestures effectively confirmed rumours circulating for several months of tensions between the two, who were no longer speaking to each other. Once, in training, Messi reportedly told striker Cristian Tello: ""You're new here and you're nothing at all. Pass me the ball. You're here to play for me."" Chilean striker Alexis Sanchez, who arrived in 2011 at a cost of 37 million euros ($53 million at the time), is said to have attracted Messi's wrath. ""Considering how bad you are, I've no idea how you cost so much,"" Messi once told Sanchez. Messi also feuded with Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Samuel Eto'o, who both fled to Italy. Already a four-time Ballon d'Or winner and at the peak of his career, Messi signed a five-year contract extension in February 2013, with an estimated salary of 12 million euros. A few months later, his long-time rival Cristiano Ronaldo signed a deal with Real Madrid worth 17 million euros a year. The Argentine reacted by demanding a pay rise. Javier Faus, Barca's vice-president in charge of finance, responded that there was no reason ""to improve the contract of someone who already received a rise six months ago"". Messi abandoned his usual media discretion to respond that Faus ""knows nothing about football"". The spat ended with Faus making a public apology. ""Messi is right, I don't know anything about football,"" he said. ""It was just a little misunderstanding that we sorted out with him and his father. We gave him a new contract."" A year later, the Argentine's salary rose to more than 20 million euros, making him the best-paid footballer in the world. In January 2015, coach Luis Enrique reportedly interrupted a training session to accuse Messi of making himself ""the master of the dressing room"". Luis Enrique relegated Messi to the bench for the next match against Real Sociedad. He did not take part in the next training session, officially for medical reasons. Messi fuelled rumours of his possible departure by following Chelsea, and two of their players, Cesc Fabregas and Filipe Luis, on Instagram. To this day, he only follows four clubs: Newells Old Boys, where he started, Barcelona, Chelsea and Manchester City. By 2017, Messi's contract was running out and a climate of tension had built up around negotiations. Luis Suarez, Messi's attacking partner, became involved, calling for the extension ""at all costs"". Sporting director Oscar Grau replied that he would use ""common sense and discretion"". In the mixed zone after a game in January, Suarez fired back: ""What we need to do is extend it, not show common sense."" The soap opera ended when Messi finally signed a deal on November 25 that ran to 2021, and, according to ""Football Leaks"" documents, lifted his salary to more than 70 million euros. The deal also included a ""loyalty bonus"" of 70 million euros if Messi sees out the contract. In February, Messi reacted angrily after Eric Abidal, the club's then sporting director, said players were to blame for the sacking of coach Ernesto Valverde the month before because they were ""not giving all they could."" Messi responded on Instagram, telling his former team-mate to ""name names"" and saying ""those in charge of sports management should also face up to their responsibilities""."
117,26/08/2020,16:47,Top European clubs circle as Messi calls time at Barcelona,Lionel Messi's bombshell request to leave Barcelona is expected to spark a legal battle over a multi-million-dollar buy-out clause but also raises the question of which club could afford him in the heat of the coronavirus pandemic.,"Messi's priority has always been to be part of a ""winning project"" at Camp Nou, and newly-appointed sporting director Ramon Planes on Wednesday hailed the Argentinian a ""winner"" the Catalan club was working hard to keep. As it stands, Messi is Barca's record scorer and has been part of a team that has amassed four Champions League titles, 10 La Liga titles and six Copa del Rey trophies. The 33-year-old's latest season, however, was not only devoid of trophies (for the first time since 2008), it was also defined by chaos and ended in humiliation with a 8-2 Champions League quarter-final defeat by eventual champions Bayern Munich. Messi, a six-time Ballon d'Or winner, has not asked for a transfer to put his feet up for the final years of his career. This is a considered move aimed at bolstering his successes, and in one competition in particular. The Champions League has become his obsession, which puts all of Europe's super-clubs in contention and eliminates the less intensive, or more romantic, options, at least for now. With a reported weekly salary of nearly one million euros, those able both to afford Messi, and convince him, may only be Paris Saint-Germain and Manchester City, with Inter Milan a third, more distant option. City would appear favourites but the club have always trodden carefully around the prospect of Messi. Their sporting staff, including coach Pep Guardiola, sporting director Txiki Begiristain and chief executive Ferran Soriano, all have connections with Barcelona they are keen to respect. For PSG, whose frustration in Europe has been comparable to City's, even if they broke new ground by reaching last weekend's final, Messi would also represent a seismic addition to the Qatari project. A Neymar-Messi-Kylian Mbappe front three would not be a difficult sell. Staying at Barcelona remains a possibility, however, particularly if under-pressure president Josep Maria Bartomeu decides to resign. But despite calls from fans and rival candidates, there is no suggestion yet that Bartomeu is considering his position. Bartomeu's new sporting director Planes, named in place of Eric Abidal a day after Quique Setien was sacked as manager following the Bayern defeat, said on Wednesday that Messi's want-away demand was ""a very important story"". ""But our idea at the club is still to build a new winning cycle around the best player in the world. We are not contemplating any kind of departure because what we want is for Messi to stay."" Planes added: ""You have to have enormous respect for what Messi is and for his history. ""I think the future is positive. I am an optimist. We need experienced players, like Leo Messi... We are putting every effort into ensuring that the relationship between Barca and Messi will continue. We are working internally to convince Leo."" Planes stressed that there was ""not an argument between Messi and Barca -- neither deserves it"". ""We are working to make Barca a winner. There is no division within the club over Leo. Anyone who knows football wants him to stay here to win again. He's a winner."" Barcelona are understood to believe Messi's release clause expired in June, and that he remains under contract until the end of the 2021 season. ""In principle, this clause expired on June 10, but the unusual nature of this season disrupted by the coronavirus opened the way for Messi to ask to be released from his contract now,"" wrote Marca newspaper. ""It's the first step towards opening negotiations over his departure, on the basis of which his release clause amounts to 700 million euros ($828 million)."" Messi joined Barcelona's youth academy at the age of 13 and made his debut in 2004 as a 17-year-old, before going on to score a club-record 634 goals. According to Spanish media, Messi met with new manager Ronald Koeman last week and told the Dutchman he currently saw himself ""more out than in"" at the club. Koeman has vowed to ""fight to put Barca back on top"" and said at his unveiling he was hopeful Messi would remain at the club for several more years. The Lisbon loss to Bayern, Barca's heaviest in Europe, exposed an ageing team that Messi repeatedly had said was simply not good enough as his relations with the club hierarchy grew increasingly strained."
118,26/08/2020,07:42,"Messi divorce: 'bombshell' fax signals end of era, legal fight at Barcelona","Six-time Ballon d'Or winner Lionel Messi told Barcelona he wants to leave -- on a free transfer -- in a ""bombshell"" fax on Tuesday that is expected to spark a legal battle over a buy-out clause worth hundreds of millions of dollars.","Signalling the end of an era at Barcelona, where Messi is the record scorer and has won four Champions League titles, the disgruntled Argentine wants to terminate his contract ""unilaterally"" by triggering a release clause, a source told AFP. Relations have plummeted this year and speculation swirled about Messi's departure after this month's humiliating 8-2 Champions League quarter-final defeat to Bayern Munich, which left Barca without a trophy for the first time since 2007. The 33-year-old's demand, faxed by his lawyers, prompted protests against Barcelona's under-fire president Josep Maria Bartomeu outside the Camp Nou where Messi, synonymous with the club's most successful period, is worshipped by fans. ""I don't see him anywhere else. I can't believe it,"" said Ruben Tejero, 28, one of about 100 fans at the stadium calling for Bartomeu to resign. ""I prefer to think it's an ultimatum given to management for Bartomeu to go."" Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain and Inter Milan are among those to have been linked to Messi, who is among the greatest players in history and has wages to match, with a reported weekly salary of nearly a million euros. ESPN reported that Messi spoke last week with Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola about a possible move. A Barcelona-based Brazilian journalist also said Messi wants to play under his former Barcelona coach. Barcelona have yet to react officially but are understood to believe Messi's release clause expired in June, and that he remains under contract until the end of the 2021 season. ""In principle, this clause expired on June 10, but the unusual nature of this season disrupted by the coronavirus opened the way for Messi to ask to be released from his contract now,"" wrote Spanish sports daily Marca. ""It's the first step towards opening negotiations over his departure, on the basis of which his release clause amounts to 700 million euros ($828 million)."" Messi joined Barcelona's youth academy at the age of 13 and made his debut in 2004 as a 17-year-old, before going on to score a club-record 634 goals. But his future at Barca was thrown into serious doubt by the 8-2 loss to Bayern, the first time Barca had conceded eight goals in a game since losing to Sevilla 8-0 in the 1946 Spanish Cup. The defeat has sparked drastic changes. Coach Quique Setien was sacked after barely six months in charge, and sporting director Eric Abidal was also dismissed. According to Spanish media, Messi met with new coach Ronald Koeman last week and told the Dutchman he saw himself ""more out than in"" at the club. Koeman has vowed to ""fight to put Barca back on top"" and said at his unveiling he was hopeful Messi would remain at the club for several more years. But Koeman has reportedly told Luis Suarez he is no longer part of Barca's plans, delivering a similar message to Arturo Vidal, Ivan Rakitic and Samuel Umtiti. ""The club needs changes,"" said defender Gerard Pique following the Bayern demolition. ""Nobody is untouchable, least of all me. Fresh blood is needed to change this. We've hit rock bottom."" Argentine sports daily Ole described Messi's wish to leave as a ""complete bombshell"", but he has had regular disagreements with the club's board in recent times. The Lisbon loss, Barca's heaviest in Europe, exposed an ageing team that Messi repeatedly had said was simply not good enough. He said it in February and again in July, when a rant in the aftermath of handing Real Madrid the title turned into a brutal, but honest, assessment of their season. As his relationship with the club hierarchy grew increasingly strained, Messi also reacted publicly when Abidal appeared to blame the players for the sacking of Ernesto Valverde in January. He also led the fightback from the Barcelona players over a dispute with the board in March regarding pay cuts during the coronavirus pandemic. ""Respect and admiration, Leo. All my support, friend,"" tweeted Barca great Carles Puyol, a long-time former team-mate of Messi, to which Suarez replied with two applause emojis. Vidal also tweeted: ""When you shut a tiger in a cage he doesn't give in, he fights back."""

""But if there's something I've learned, it's that we must never take anything for granted, not even the things we think of as being the most normal. ""The lives we are living now teach us that.""

Pjanic will ""not be travelling to Barcelona for 15 days, when he will be expected to report for duty with the FC Barcelona team,"" Barca's statement said. The Bosnia international, who is reported to be on holiday in Italy, will therefore miss the start of pre-season training on August 31 under new coach Ronald Koeman. The 2020-21 La Liga campaign is due to begin September 12. Pjanic, 30, was signed in June by Barca for 60 million euros ($70.7 million) as part of an arrangement which saw Brazilian midfielder Arthur move in the opposite direction for 72 million euros.

The Swede also played alongside Koeman for two years at Feyenoord between 1995 and 1997. Since his retirement in 2009, Larsson has coached Landskrona, Falkenberg and Helsingborg in his homeland. Schreuder, 47, left Hoffenheim in June over a difference of opinions about the club's direction. The Dutchman, who had previously served as assistant manager, rejoined the Bundesliga side last year from Ajax to take over after Julian Nagelsmann left for RB Leipzig.

""He has the quality to play with us. He has excellent statistics, the only player with a better minutes played/ goals scored ratio at Barca is Lionel Messi,"" Enrique said. ""He has everything so to become an important player in the squad,"" he added. Enrique returned to the Spain job in November after resigning last June to take care of his daughter, Xana, who died of cancer. The former Real Madrid and Barcelona midfielder has also included uncapped Wolves attacker Adama Traore, Manchester City defender Ferran Torres and Sevilla's Sergio Reguilo, but Barca's Jordi Alba and Atletico Madrid's Saul Niguez miss out. ""If I could have I would have picked 30 players... But it's impossible. The PSG players could have been there as well as Dani Ceballos and Gerard Moreno... But I can't pick them all,"" Enrique said.

The 57-year-old Koeman, who had been in charge of the Netherlands since 2018, replaces Quique Setien, who was sacked after the Catalans were humiliated 8-2 by Bayern Munich in the Champions League quarter-finals on Friday. He becomes the fifth Dutchman to coach Barcelona after Rinus Michels, Johan Cruyff, Louis van Gaal and Frank Rijkaard. In his six seasons as a Barca player Koeman made 264 official appearances, scoring 88 goals as he shone in Cruyff's 'Dream Team', winning four consecutive La Liga titles between 1991-94. He also struck the winner in the 1992 European Cup final, the Catalan club's first ever success in Europe's top club competition. ""It was written, one day, Ronald Koeman was to coach Barca.

The image from the other day is not the one we want to return to, not me, nor the players, directors, supporters, anyone."" The Bayern capitulation was the first time Barca had conceded eight goals in a game since losing to Sevilla 8-0 in the 1946 Spanish Cup. Koeman said he would stick to his preferred Dutch style of possession-based football, staying true to the club's tradition, but rowed back on suggestions the likes of Luis Suarez, Sergio Busquets and Jordi Alba could all be leaving the club. ""If decisions need to be made, we'll take them,"" said Koeman. ""A player who is 31, 32 years old, he's not finished. It's all about the hunger he has to want to be at this club and give the maximum.""

""He still has a year on his contract, he's part of Barca. I don't know if I need to convince him. He's the best player in the world.

The 57-year-old, who becomes the fifth Dutchman to coach Barcelona after Rinus Michels, Johan Cruyff, Louis Van Gaal and Frank Rijkaard, will hold a press conference later Wednesday at 1600 GMT. ""More than 30 years after his arrival as a player, Koeman arrives once again as coach at the club that he helped win their very first European Cup back in 1992,"" Barcelona said in a statement headlined ""Return of a Barca legend"". ""Koeman, the hero of Wembley, is back,"" the club added, a day after president Josep Maria Bartomeu revealed the Dutchman would take over. That night back in 1992, Koeman secured his place in Barca history, scoring the winning goal to claim the Catalan club's first ever success in Europe's top club competition. As a player, Koeman arrived in Barcelona in 1989, at the time the second most expensive signing in the club's history behind Diego Maradona. In his six seasons as a Barca player Koeman made 264 official appearances, scoring 88 goals as he shone in Cruyff's 'Dream Team', winning four consecutive La Liga titles between 1991-94. Koeman's coaching career, however, has been mixed and he arrives with the Catalans in crisis. Setien was fired on Monday after the embarrassment against Bayern which meant Barca finish the season trophy-less for the first time since 2007. Earlier on Tuesday sporting director Eric Abidal was axed, paying the price for the Bayern trouncing and internal conflict that took place during a league season that saw them surrender the La Liga title to Real Madrid. Ex-France international Abidal was replaced Wednesday by Ramon Planes. Koeman will leave his role as coach of the Netherlands to his assistant Dwight Lodeweges, while the national federation searches for a full-time replacement. The Oranje take on Poland on September 4 and Italy three days later, in Amsterdam as part of the UEFA Nations League. ""It was an honour to be the national coach of the Netherlands,"" said Koeman, who would have been in charge for the 2020 European championships, now postponed by a year because of the coronavirus pandemic. ""For the past two-and-a-half years I have done everything I can to achieve successes with the Oranje. ""I look back with pride on what we have achieved together in that period.

""It's someone the supporters know well, not just as a player but also as a coach."" According to reports Koeman and his agent were negotiating a two-year contract late on Monday, with the second year dependent on the outcome of the presidential elections. Koeman is a hero at Barca after shining in Johan Cruyff's 'Dream Team', with whom he won for La Liga titles in the row between 1991 and 1994. He also scored the winning goal in the 1992 European Cup final -- the Catalan club's first ever success in Europe's top club competition. He has said coaching Barcelona would be his ""dream"" job, and he leaves his country's national team after two-and-a-half years in charge to grab his opportunity. His coaching career has been mixed and he arrives with Catalans in crisis. Setien was fired on Monday after the embarrassment against Bayern which meant Barca finish the season trophy-less for the first time since 2007. Earlier on Tuesday sporting director Eric Abidal was axed, paying the price for the Bayern trouncing and internal conflict that took place during a league season that saw them surrender the La Liga title to Real Madrid. Abidal was criticised for his handling of the dismissal of then coach Ernesto Valverde in January. The former left-back blamed the players for Valverde's dismissal in an interview, provoking an angry reaction from the club's normally discreet superstar Lionel Messi. Bartomeu's own position is also under threat according to reports with June's presidential elections moved forward to March 15. Mauricio Pochettino was also considered as a replacement for Setien but his previous comments dismissing Barca due to his links with rivals Espanyol have counted against him. Bartomeu announced he would be putting the full weight of Barca's resources behind the new coach, promoting that ""the renewal of the workforce will be as deep as it takes for the new project to be successful"". ""We will set ourselves up to win everything. It is a goal, a necessity, and an aspiration,"" he said. He insisted Messi would be the ""cornerstone"" of Barcelona under Koeman, with rumours the Argentin forward was looking to leave the club for which he has played his entire senior career. ""Messi remains the best player in the world. He is number one and he is with us,"" said Bartomeu. ""Every project we do, we do it knowing that we have the best player in the world... And in the new project, Koeman can absolutely count on Messi. ""Messi wants to end his career at Barca, he has said it several times.

Thomas Mueller and substitute Philippe Coutinho both scored twice for Bayern alongside Ivan Perisic, Serge Gnabry, Joshua Kimmich, Robert Lewandowski who also netted. Barcelona had only a David Alaba own goal to show before Luis Suarez offered brief hope with a second-half goal. The quarter-final in Lisbon had been a chance for Ter Stegen, 28, to advance his claim to take over from Neuer, 34, as Germany's goalkeeper. The pair had a war-of-words last September as the Barcelona goalkeeper questioned why Neuer remains first choice under national team head coach Joachim Loew. However, Neuer comfortably won Friday's dual, wrong-footed only by Alaba's mistimed clearance and Suarez's strike. Neuer can expect to be in Germany's goal for their Nations League matches against Spain and Switzerland early in September. ""We are of course very euphoric. This is something very special,"" said Germany team-mate and Bayern midfielder Leon Goretzka. ""It will probably only sink in during the coming days."""

""It doesn't depend on me. There needs to be a wider reflection, taking into account the situation and the importance of this defeat which is so painful."" Defender Gerard Pique called for sweeping changes at the Camp Nou in the wake of the defeat, the worst in Barcelona's distinguished European history. Setien was already under huge pressure, despite only being appointed as the successor to Ernesto Valverde in January, with Barcelona having relinquished the Spanish title on his watch, finishing second to Real Madrid in La Liga. They were hoping to make up for a disappointing domestic campaign in the 'Final Eight' in Lisbon but were instead utterly outclassed by Bayern at the Estadio da Luz. Speaking to Spanish television station Movistar Plus, Bartomeu said: ""Now is not the time for decisions, it is the time to apologise to the members, the Barcelona fans, because it was not a good day for them."" ""We are hurting, but once we get to next week we will start making decisions."" Setien called the defeat ""tremendously painful"" and hinted that he knew what was coming. ""I am aware of what such a defeat means. I think what happens today needs to be analysed with a bit more perspective,"" he said. ""The credibility of a coach is diminished when this happens, clearly. That is obvious, but that does not bother me right now."""

Ivan Perisic, Serge Gnabry, Joshua Kimmich and Robert Lewandowski were also on target for Bayern, with Barca's goals coming via a David Alaba own goal and a second-half strike from Luis Suarez. ""We have hit rock bottom. This is not the first, nor the second, nor the third time. We are not on the right path,"" said Pique. ""Coaches and players follow one another, but it has been several years since we have been able to be competitive on a European level. ""We all have to think internally and decide what is best for the club, for Barca. Tonight was unacceptable for Barcelona."" Five-time winners Barcelona's last Champions League title came in 2015 and Friday's rout followed being beaten to La Liga title by bitter rivals Real Madrid. ""It was a horrible match. It leaves a bad feeling, a disgrace,"" added 33-year-old Pique. ""It's very hard to take but I hope it will be useful for something, for us to all think about it. ""The club needs changes. And I'm not talking at the level of the coach or the players, but structurally the club needs changes of all kinds. ""We must bring in new blood to change this dynamic, and if necessary, I would be the first to leave."""
129,14/08/2020,23:05,Record-breaker Mueller steals the show from Lewandowski and even Messi,Thomas Mueller claimed a Champions League record Friday as the Germany reject stole the limelight from Robert Lewandowski and Lionel Messi as Bayern Munich routed Barcelona in their Champions League quarter-final.,"Mueller netted twice in Lisbon as Barcelona conceded four goals in the first-half of a Champions League game for the first time as Bayern went 4-1 up at half-time. Substitute Philippe Coutinho also scored twice in Bayern's 8-2 hammering. The 30-year-old Mueller capped an outstanding display by passing Philipp Lahm's record to become the German with the most Champions League appearances on 113 games. In the build up, there had been fierce debate as to whether Lewandowski or Messi is the better player. However, it was Mueller who stole the show, underlining his status as Barcelona's nemesis with six goals in five games against the Spanish giants. Mueller scored against Barcelona when Bayern bowed out in the Champions League semi-finals in 2014/15. He also netted three goals over two legs against Barcelona seven years ago when Bayern romped to a 4-0 win in Munich and 3-0 away in the semi-finals on the way to winning the 2013 Champions League title. After creating a record 21 assists in the Bundesliga last season - many of them finished by Lewandowski - Mueller outshone the Champions League's top-scorer this season in Lisbon with two superb first-half goals. He took a return pass from Lewandowski with just four minutes gone to fire past Barca's Germany goalkeeper Marc-Andre Ter Stegen. After Bayern defender David Alaba turned the ball into his own net on seven minutes, Bayern emphatically re-established their lead by bossing the Barca midfield with goals by Ivan Perisic and Serge Gnabry. Mueller made it 4-1 on 31 minutes when he fired in Joshua Kimmich's low cross at the far post to leave Barcelona shell-shocked at the break. His form in 2019/20 had already proved that Germany head coach Joachim Loew arguably wrote Mueller out of his plans far too soon. Following Germany's disastrous 2018 World Cup campaign, when the holders went out in the group stages, Mueller was unceremoniously dumped by Loew in March 2019 alongside defenders Mat Hummels and Jerome Boateng. However, Mueller has responded by making a mockery of Loew's decision and proven emphatically why former Bayern coach Niko Kovac was wrong to start him on the bench this season. When Kovac was sacked in November, his replacement Hansi Flick reinstated Mueller, who has been a key factor with 14 goals this season. He has been the central cog in attack as Bayern romped to an eighth straight Bundesliga title, lifted the German Cup and remain on course to add the Champions League title."
130,14/08/2020,22:54,Bayern humiliate Messi's Barcelona 8-2,"A merciless Bayern Munich inflicted a humiliating, record defeat on Barcelona on Friday, recording a scarcely believable 8-2 victory in their Champions League quarter-final in Lisbon to leave Lionel Messi forlorn and surely hastening in the end of an era in Catalonia.","Thomas Mueller scored twice either side of goals from Ivan Perisic and Serge Gnabry in a stunning opening 31 minutes at an empty Estadio da Luz, with a David Alaba own-goal having briefly brought Barcelona back level. Luis Suarez pulled it back to 4-2 at one point in the second half, but Barcelona then caved in, with Joshua Kimmich getting Bayern's fifth before three more goals in the final stages, one for the prolific Robert Lewandowski and two for substitute Philippe Coutinho. That was the really humiliating part for the beaten side, with Coutinho on loan in Bavaria from Barcelona, who spent huge money on signing the Brazilian in 2018. The game was eerily reminiscent of Germany's 7-1 destruction of Brazil in the 2014 World Cup, a game in which Mueller also played and scored. Germany went on to win that World Cup and Bayern look a good bet to win this Champions League, although they will surely face a sterner test in the semi-final regardless of whether it is against Manchester City or Lyon. This was their 19th consecutive victory in all competitions, and a 28th game unbeaten for Hansi Flick's side. They have now scored 39 goals in nine Champions League outings this season. But the story of this game is Barcelona's remarkable capitulation and the question is what happens to them now. Messi was 27 when they last won the Champions League in 2015. He is 33 now and this game may make up his mind that he needs to finally leave the Camp Nou if he is to win it again. Barca have just about been here before: They were torn apart by Bayern in the 2013 semi-finals, losing 7-0 on aggregate, but this was eight goals in 90 minutes. And with an ageing team featuring six players aged 31 or older, this has to be the end of an era. Coach Quique Setien will not survive. His team, having already come second to Real Madrid in La Liga, simply could not cope with Bayern's pressing. Bayern went ahead in the fourth minute as Mueller controlled a ball in from the left by Perisic and played a one-two with Lewandowski to scuff a shot low past compatriot Marc-Andre ter Stegen. They did leave themselves open at the back and parity was restored when Alaba, in attempting to stop a Jordi Alba cross, sliced the ball over Manuel Neuer and into his own net. For a very brief spell Barca were even on top, as Neuer was forced into a key save from Suarez and a Messi cross came back off the far upright. But Bayern, suffocating their opponents with their pressing, went back in front midway through the first half. Gnabry won back possession on the edge of the final third before feeding Perisic, who fired past Ter Stegen and into the far corner. That was the first of three goals in a 10-minute spell. Leon Goretzka's deft touch over the top took out Clement Lenglet and Gnabry drilled home to make it 3-1. Then Mueller stole in front of Lenglet to turn in Kimmich's delivery from the right for 4-1. Suarez briefly gave Barca something to cling to as he controlled Alba's ball in from the left, bodyswerved away from Jerome Boateng and fired home. Yet there would be no comeback, as Kimmich converted Bayern's fifth following a remarkable assist by Alphonso Davies, and then Lewandowski headed in Coutinho's cross to make it six. As Barcelona collapsed, Coutinho made it seven in the 85th minute at the end of a move started when Messi was robbed of possession and then had time to score another in the 88th minute."

""The club has informed the relevant sporting and health authorities as well as tracing all the people who have had contact with the player so that they can undergo the corresponding PCR tests."" Umtiti had not travelled anyway to Lisbon due to injury, with Barcelona up against Bayern Munich there on Friday in the Champions League quarter-finals. His infection comes after Barca youth team player Jean-Clair Todibo also tested positive on Wednesday. It continues a spate of positive tests among Spanish clubs in recent weeks after Real Madrid, Atletico Madrid, Sevilla, Valencia and Athletic Bilbao have all been among the clubs to report cases."
132,13/08/2020,19:59,Vidal declares Barca 'best team in the world' ahead of Bayern test,Arturo Vidal has warned Bayern Munich his Barcelona team are the best team in the world ahead of their Champions League quarter-final in Lisbon on Friday.,"And Barca coach Quique Setien was in confident mood too, insisting Bayern's in-form striker Robert Lewandowski is ""clearly"" not at the level of his captain Lionel Messi. Their comments come after former Bayern midfielder Lothar Matthaus told German newspaper Bild earlier this week Lewandowski has overtaken Messi as the best player in the world and he no longer fears Barcelona. Vidal spent three years at Bayern, who are deemed heavy favourites to reach the semis after winning the German title and hammering Chelsea, while Barca crumbled in La Liga. But Vidal said on Thursday Barcelona's opponents should not be complacent. ""They are very confident but tomorrow they aren't playing against a Bundesliga team, they're playing against Barca and Barca is the best team in the world."" Barcelona surrendered the Spanish title to Real Madrid after winning only seven of their 11 matches following the restart. They then laboured to a 3-1 win over Napoli in the Champions League last 16 on Saturday. Asked about the expectation that Bayern will go through, Vidal said: ""I get it. We are the best team in the world but in La Liga we haven't shown it in the last few games. ""We lost the league but we have Leo, we have other players and if we play well, we can beat anyone. Tomorrow we have to show it in the field."" Messi is likely to be key at the Estadio da Luz, with some suggesting all Barcelona's hopes rest on the 33-year-old's shoulders. Yet Bayern have their own trump card in Lewandowski, who has scored an astonishing 53 goals in 44 games for his club this season. Messi has hit 31 goals in 43 matches for Barca. ""Lewandowski is a great footballer but he is not at the level of Leo, clearly,"" said Setien. ""Lewandowski is in great form, he has scored 13 goals in the Champions League and it is true that he is very well supported by many teammates who can also do damage. ""He's in a great moment but Leo is too. We saw it the other day against Napoli."" Setien also denied Barcelona's chances are entirely dependent on their captain. ""Messi can help win the game, obviously, but I have always believed in the strength of the team,"" Setien said. ""You also have to help Messi, give him the ball. He can create his own fireworks but without the strength of the team, Leo would not be Leo, like any player."" Setien said Ousmane Dembele will be in the squad and could feature but the France World Cup winner is unlikely to start after being out since November with a hamstring tear. ""It's satisfying for everyone even to have him in the squad and he is in a position to play a few minutes if we need him,"" said Setien. ""He's been out for almost a year, it's true, but we believe he could go out and play well."" The tie will be a single match in line with the reformed Champions League format from the quarter-finals onwards, with the winner to meet either Manchester City or Lyon for a place in the final on August 23."
133,13/08/2020,04:32,Messi's toughest task as Barcelona face up to Bayern Munich,Lionel Messi might never have been faced with a more daunting task at Barcelona than engineering a victory against Bayern Munich in Lisbon on Friday.,"The only surviving former winners of European club football's greatest prize -- with five titles each -- meet in a heavyweight Champions League quarter-final behind closed doors at the Estadio da Luz. It is not often that Messi's Barcelona come into such a big European tie as the underdogs, but they have this time, with Quique Setien's team having lost out to Real Madrid in the Spanish title race while Bayern appeared flawless on the way to winning a German league and cup double. Messi is now 33, yet Barcelona appear more reliant on him than ever. He scored twice against Bayern in the quarter-finals in 2009 when Barcelona went on to win the Champions League under Pep Guardiola. He hit four against Arsenal the following year and five against Bayer Leverkusen in 2012 but on both occasions, Barca were favourites. Messi also sank Real Madrid at the Santiago Bernabeu in 2011 when his double in the first leg of the semi-final, including one of the finest goals the competition has ever seen, transcended a rivalry that had been dragged to its ugliest point. And he was part of perhaps the tournament's greatest comeback, the 6-1 destruction of Paris Saint-Germain in 2017 after Barcelona lost 4-0 in the first leg of that last-16 tie. Yet this time threatens to be different. With Luis Suarez and Antoine Griezmann alongside him, Frenkie de Jong and Sergio Busquets behind him and Jordi Alba out wide, Messi should not be on his own. Even in defence, Gerard Pique still has a claim to be the best defender in La Liga and Marc-Andre ter Stegen is among the most impressive goalkeepers in the world. ""Bayern are playing really well and are full of confidence but we have the weapons to beat them,"" Griezmann told Barca TV. But the sense remains that Messi must perform if Barcelona are to defeat Bayern, widely seen as the favourites to lift the trophy on August 23, at the end of the express knock-out tournament in Lisbon. It will take something very special not only to lift his own team out of the doldrums but also to neutralise an opponent that many believe are the most complete side in Europe. Barcelona therefore must first of all hope that Messi shows no ill effects from the ankle knock he suffered in last weekend's last-16, second-leg win over Napoli -- he has been back training normally. The Catalans should certainly wonder how it got to this point, given they spent more than 500 million euros ($590m) over the last three seasons, bringing in players that should have complemented, not isolated, the Argentine. The worry is that Bayern might not just beat Barcelona at the Estadio da Luz, but humiliate them. If they do, Setien is likely to pay with his job, even if he only took over as coach in January, replacing Ernesto Valverde, who was also unable to shake this current crop into life. The alternative is a statement performance that vindicates Setien, establishes him for next season and sends Barcelona into the semi-finals with the kind of momentum that could even take them all the way. ""We have to be optimistic, we are in good shape,"" said Setien after the Napoli game. However, it would be a surprise to see Barcelona go on and lift the trophy, and it seems unthinkable they could do it without an intervention from Messi, who must be wondering too how the club that won the treble five years ago have come to rely on him so completely. The challenge is not beyond Messi. But Barcelona must know he deserves more."
134,13/08/2020,03:10,'Like Ronaldo and Messi' - Ter Stegen and Neuer square off in Champions League,Barcelona goalkeeper Marc-Andre Ter Stegen has the chance to advance his claim for Germany's Number One shirt when he faces Bayern Munich and their veteran shot-stopper Manuel Neuer in Friday's Champions League quarter-final.,"The 34-year-old Neuer has been Germany captain since Bastian Schweinsteiger retired in 2016. However, Ter Stegen is itching to usurp him as Germany goalkeeper, but there is not much to separate the pair. ""In several areas that characterise modern goalkeepers, I consider them to be equal,"" said Bodo Illgner, Germany's goalkeeper thirty years ago when Lothar Matthaeus lifted the World Cup at Italy 1990. The 53-year-old says the pair are similar in their ""play on the line, in one-on-ones, their charisma, and even in a penalty shoot-out"". Illgner believes Neuer has a more commanding presence ""as a boss in his own penalty area"". After years as second choice for Germany, the 28-year-old Ter Stegen, who has made 24 international appearances, finally ran out of patience last September. He caused a stir by saying he could not understand why Neuer, Germany's goalkeeper since 2010, remains undisputed first-choice under head coach Joachim Loew. Bayern's outspoken former president Uli Hoeness waded into the ensuing debate saying that Ter Stegen had ""no right"" to claim the position. Neuer, voted the world's best goalkeeper for four years straight until 2016, is in the twilight of his career. Now Ter Stegen has the chance to show who is the best goalkeeper on the Champions League stage. Neuer has the physical edge as he stands 1.92 metres to Ter Stegen's 1.87m, and makes every centimetre count when he is bearing down on a striker in the penalty area. Both 'keepers also initiate play from their own area. ""Both are great when it comes to being an 11th outfield player. Neuer has been the absolute benchmark in this area, but Ter Stegen has become a bit better than the original,"" Illgner said. Benedikt Howedes, Neuer's team-mate in Brazil when the Germans won the 2014 World Cup, compares the pair to two giants of the game. ""It's like comparing (Lionel) Messi and (Cristiano) Ronaldo - they're both great,"" says Hoewedes, who recently retired. In Saturday's last 16 ties, Ter Stegen shaded it as he was only beaten when Napoli's Lorenzo Insigne converted a penalty in Barcelona's 3-1 win. Neuer was impressive in Bayern's 4-1 win over Chelsea, but was beaten by a fierce shot from Tammy Abraham just before half-time. While critics point to the mistakes Neuer has become susceptible to in recent years, when he occasionally mistimes runs from his box, his enjoys an untarnished reputation in Germany as a world-class goalkeeper. Such is the faith shown by Bayern Munich that his contract expires in June 2023 -- just after turns 37. Ter Stegen has two years left on his contract, but Barcelona are eager to extend his deal. Both goalkeepers face world-class finishers on Friday. Neuer is up against both Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez, while Ter Stegen faces the Champions League's top-scorer Robert Lewandowski, who has 13 goals in seven European matches this campaign. Bayern midfielder Leon Goretzka, who has played with both for the national team, says Germany is spoiled for choice. ""You can say they are the two best goalkeepers in the world,"" Goretzka said Tuesday. ""It's good to have 'Manu' at the back, he brings a sense of security, but Marc-Andre has become world-class."" cpb-ryj/gj <org>SPORT LISBOA E BENFICA - FUTEBOL</org>"

""It is nice - after playing against (Juventus star Cristiano) Ronaldo a few times - to play the other formative player of the last decade. ""That can only be done collectively,"" the 25-year-old central midfielder said of Messi, ""because he is a gifted footballer"". ""I don't know how, but we have to force our game on them."" Messi scored his 31st goal this season on Saturday and is looking to lift the Champions League for the fifth time in his career with Barcelona. Treble-chasing Bayern, however, have won all 13 games since the coronavirus lockdown restart. They underlined their impressive form on Saturday when Robert Lewandowski, the Champions League's top scorer, netted twice and created two more in the last 16, second-leg rout of Chelsea to seal a 7-1 thrashing on aggregate. Bayern are chasing the treble having already won an eigth straight Bundesliga title and lifted the German Cup, but Goretzka says Barcelona present a true test. ""There is no easy way now. We are here in the sun in Portugal and are preparing for a knockout game in the Champions League,"" he said. ""We're really up for it. Knockout matches are great."" While Barcelona are packed with stars alongside Messi, Goretzka says Bayern are far more than just Lewandowski's goals. ""At the moment, we're playing as a unit, in addition to the quality of the individual players. ""We have a clear plan in hand and our intensity without the ball can make the difference."" But he admitted being wary of Arturo Vidal, Barca's ex-Bayern midfielder. ""I got to know him for a few weeks and played against him many times. He has a first-class mentality with amazing fitness,"" added Goretzka. ""I noticed that during fitness tests - which I took next to him - he can go beyond the pain threshold."""

The draw means a rotated Madrid side surrendered the perfect record of 11 victories out of 11 since Spanish football came back from its coronavirus-enforced suspension while Karim Benzema fell short of Lionel Messi in the battle for the golden boot. Gareth Bale was left out of Madrid's squad completely for what might have been his last La Liga fixture for the club. Zinedine Zidane said afterwards it was a ""techinical decision"". Messi had earlier scored twice in a 5-0 win over Alaves, enough for him to claim a record seventh 'Pichichi Trophy' and to give Barcelona a boost ahead of the return leg of their last 16 Champions League tie against Napoli next month. The double took Messi's league tally to 25 goals for the season and put him four clear of Benzema, who endured a quiet night against Leganes, with Sergio Ramos and Marco Asensio on target. The odds were always against Leganes but a miracle looked possible when Roger Assale equalised with 12 minutes left to find a winner. But chances were missed and a penalty appeal was turned down, meaning they join Real Mallorca and Espanyol in Segunda next season. ""The lads are broken,"" said Leganes coach Javier Aguirre. ""We had it within our grasp."" Real Sociedad and Granada, meanwhile, took the last two Europa League spots, with Getafe and Valencia missing out. Villarreal had already secured fifth place. Granada thrashed Athletic Bilbao 4-0 and qualification caps an incredible season for the club, who were only promoted from Segunda last term. ""Our aim was to stay up so to finish in the Europa League is a dream for us,"" said Granada striker Roberto Soldado. Real Sociedad snuck into sixth place after Adnan Januzaj's 87th-minute goal clinched a 1-1 draw away at Atletico Madrid. Messi finishes as La Liga's top scorer for a record seventh time, pulling clear of Telmo Zarra's six while playing for Athletic Bilbao in the forties and fifties. ""I'm never that bothered about the individual prizes and I would have preferred it to have come with a league title like before,"" added Messi. Setien said on Saturday he still believes Barcelona, at their best, can win the Champions League next month. And a sparkling attacking display certainly gave a glimpse of what is possible, even if Napoli in the last 16, and potentially Bayern Munich in the quarter-finals, will offer a completely different test. There could be fitness concerns for Setien too ahead of the second leg against Napoli. Clement Lenglet hobbled off with what looked like a groin problem, with Antoine Griezmann and Samuel Umtiti already out injured. But Setien has increasingly been putting his faith in youth and the 20-year-old Puig impressed again in midfield while 21-year-old Ronald Araujo gave a composed, albeit largely unchallenged, performance in defence. The 17-year-old Ansu Fati opened the scoring at the near post before Puig teed up Messi to stride through and finish. Luis Suarez capped a superb move by heading in his 17th league goal after Jordi Alba had volleyed Messi's pass across, with another Puig through ball allowing Nelson Semedo to lash in a fourth. Messi had the last word with a smart finish on the half-volley. Madrid looked to have to have the game won when Asensio finished off Isco's pass but Leganes pulled level as Assale nipped in to set up a dramatic last 10 minutes. With Celta still being held, they only needed a goal to survive and Javier Aviles might have got it only to miskick at the back post and then failed to connect from a corner. Replays showed Luka Jovic touched the cross with his hand but referee Guillermo Cuadra was not convinced and even goalkeeper Pichu Cuellar going up for a 94th-minute corner could not give Leganes the goal they needed."

Ansu Fati, Luis Suarez and Nelson Semedo also chipped in for an emphatic victory against an Alaves side who looked off the pace after guaranteeing survival earlier in the week. Barca had their fate confirmed on Thursday too, when defeat to Osasuna handed Real Madrid the title and brought scrutiny on all areas of the club, including the future of Quique Setien as coach. Messi delivered a stinging assessment after the game but Setien said on Saturday he still believes Barcelona, at their best, can win the Champions League next month. ""Today was very different,"" said Messi. ""We have taken an important step in terms of attitude and commitment and things can follow on from that. We have shown we can change."" Unless Benzema runs riot against Leganes, Messi will finish as La Liga's top scorer for a seventh time, pulling clear of Telmo Zarra's six while playing for Athletic Bilbao in the forties and fifties. This sparkling attacking display certainly gave a glimpse of what is possible when Messi, Suarez, Fati and the promising Riqui Puig find their rhythm but Napoli in the last 16, and potentially Bayern Munich in the quarter-finals, will offer a completely different test. There could be fitness concerns for Setien too. Clement Lenglet hobbled off with what looked like a groin problem, with Antoine Griezmann and Samuel Umtiti already out injured. Suspensions for Gerard Pique, Junior Firpo and Ivan Rakitic meant Setien was able to name only three outfield players on his bench. But Setien has increasingly been putting his faith in youth and the 20-year-old Puig impressed again in midfield while 21-year-old Ronald Araujo gave a composed, albeit largely unchallenged, performance in defence. Barcelona were three goals up before half-time and could have had more. They hit the woodwork three times in the first 15 minutes as Puig and Arturo Vidal both rattled the crossbar before Messi's curling shot hit the post. Fati finally opened the scoring when Messi's deflected cross looped up to the near post, where the 17-year-old was quickest to react. Suarez spurned a one-on-one after a brilliant Puig pass and Puig was also involved in the second, weaving inside and teeing up Messi to stride through and finish. Vidal went close with a flicked header from Messi's cross before Suarez capped a superb move by heading in his 17th league goal after Jordi Alba had volleyed Messi's pass across. Another Puig through ball just before the hour allowed Semedo to lash in a fourth, only for Messi to have the last word with a smart finish on the half-volley."

Messi added that unless there was ""a lot of change"" the team would lose to Napoli as well next month in the Champions League, comments some have taken as a shot at his coach. But Setien maintains he has no problem with Messi's assessment. ""Not at all, I think in certain moments we all say things that can be taken badly,"" said Setien, ahead of Barcelona's final league game of the season on Sunday away at Alaves. ""I don't give it much importance. The feeling I get is we are absolutely aware that we have a very important competition to come and we want to reach the final and win it."" Barca face a second leg at home against Napoli in the last 16, with the tie in the balance after a 1-1 draw in the first leg. The winner will play Bayern Munich in the quarter-finals, assuming they finish the job against Chelsea. ""We have to improve in some areas but you can't convince me everything has been a disaster, it hasn't,"" said Setien. ""We have to be more consistent, more reliable. If we manage to have a game like the one we played against Villarreal, where everything went well, it will undoubtedly give us a chance to win the Champions League."" Setien said he and the players held a meeting on Friday and admitted there had been disagreements. ""There are things on which we agree and other things that we don't, that's normal,"" he said. ""Everyone's concern is to improve the team. We are trying to find solutions so things change and that is what the meeting was all about, preparing for the future with optimism."" But Setien's position is already unstable, with failure in the Champions League likely to prompt another change after Ernesto Valverde was sacked in January. Barcelona could finish the season without a trophy for the first time in 12 years. Asked if he had thought about resigning, Setien said: ""I always knew things were not going to be easy. At no time have I had the feeling of really wanting to leave."" Setien has named only 16 players in the squad for the game against Alaves, including three goalkeepers, meaning he can only make three outfield substitutions. Arthur Melo, who has agreed to join Juventus next season, is unavailable after he reported an ankle injury."
142,17/07/2020,12:39,Messi rages as failing Barca lose La Liga and risk getting even worse,"Barcelona made it all about the Champions League and after surrendering La Liga to Real Madrid, now it is all they have left.","Winning the title last season for an eighth time in 11 years was never going to be enough. Winning the double had not been either the year before. La Liga and the Copa del Rey had become Barca's default, their domestic dominance taken for granted and then diminished by disappointment in Europe. A mess of a season could still be saved by the Champions League but even the most optimistic of fans expect the worst against Bayern Munich, Barcelona's probable opponents in the quarter-finals. Many, including Lionel Messi, are worried even about getting past Napoli, with the pandemic-delayed last 16 matchup poised at 1-1. ""I said long ago that if we continued in this way, it would be very difficult to win the Champions League and that has been shown to be the case in La Liga too,"" said a frustrated Messi after the loss to Osasuna on Thursday. ""If we want to fight for the Champions League we will have to change a lot because otherwise the match against Napoli, we will lose that as well."" Just over a year on from almost winning the treble, Barcelona look set to finish without a trophy of any kind for the first time in 12 years. And yet the concern is not so much the many failures of this season but the possibility they could be just the start. Messi is 33 and his anger is directed primarily at the board, whose leadership has left Barcelona with a team seemingly neither for the present nor the future. There has been no succession plan for Messi since Neymar joined Paris Saint-Germain in 2018 and that world record fee has been squandered on players that have failed to settle or been sold to balance the books. Antoine Griezmann, bought for 120 million euros, left Atletico Madrid for the Camp Nou and what he thought would be the pinnacle of his club career. Yet earlier this month, he was reduced to coming off the bench, against Atletico, in injury-time. And it is not just Messi nearing the end. Gerard Pique, Sergio Busquets, Luis Suarez and Jordi Alba are all 31 or older. Off the pitch, political blunders have angered the dressing room, with Messi issuing a public rebuke to sporting director Eric Abidal in February over the sacking of Ernesto Valverde. Removing Valverde might have been understandable last summer after two successful years appeared to have run their course. But a change mid-season, with Barca top of the table, and to a coach like Quique Setien, whose ideas need time to be absorbed, now looks reckless. Setien has admitted managing a squad like Barcelona's has been a challenge for him. He has intimated that some players need to think more about the team. He has made mistakes too and it remains to be seen if he pays with his job. Bartomeu has said Setien will stay for the Champions League but the 2-1 home defeat by Osasuna intensified the doubts. ""I hope so,"" said Setien, when asked on Thursday if he would be in charge next month. But with presidential elections at the club to come next year, the position is not an attractive one for an elite coach. If Bartomeu's successor loses, Victor Font, a rival candidate, wants to appoint Xavi Hernandez. It means either Setien or his replacement face the prospect of one full season in the job, all the while lacking either authority or certainty in the long term. Zinedine Zidane has shown what can be done with an ageing Real squad that appears dead on its feet. But it is hard to see who could perform an equivalent rescue act at Barca or who would be prepared to do it with this board still in place. Without money to spend in the aftermath of the coronavirus pandemic, the answer could be to turn again to youth, with Riqui Puig and Ansu Fati already breaking through this season. Yet in a dysfunctioning team, desperate to win before Messi retires, that approach offers no guarantees. Messi's clock hangs over everything, with every failure enhanced by the sense that the club's greatest ever player is being wasted. The biggest worry now is it could get even worse."
143,17/07/2020,00:32,Messi predicts Champions League failure if Barca fail to change,"A frustrated Lionel Messi called for change after Barcelona handed the La Liga title to Real Madrid on Thursday, warning the team will lose in the Champions League as well if they fail to improve.","Barca's title challenge ended with a whimper at Camp Nou, where they were beaten 2-1 by Osasuna while Madrid's 2-1 victory at home to Villarreal ensured they were crowned Spanish champions. Defeat increases the pressure on coach Quique Setien, who took over in January with Barcelona sitting top of the table. Club president Josep Maria Bartomeu has said Setien will remain in charge for the Champions League next month, when Barca play their second leg at home to Napoli, with the last-16 tie in the balance at 1-1. ""The feeling of the team is that it tries but can't do it, that we leave a lot to be desired in many areas and today in the first half I think they were better than us,"" Messi said after the loss to Osasuna. ""I said long ago that if we continued in this way, it would be very difficult to win the Champions League and that has been shown to be the case in La Liga too. ""If we want to fight for the Champions League we will have to change a lot because otherwise the match against Napoli, we will lose that as well."" Messi scored a brilliant free-kick against Osasuna but it was not enough. Madrid pulled seven points clear of Barcelona ahead of Sunday's final round of games. ""We didn't expect or want to finish like this but it almost sums up the whole year,"" said Messi. ""We have been very inconsistent, very weak, beaten on intensity or desire. ""They created chances very easily and scored. During the whole year we have been inconsistent and we have lost a lot of points where we shouldn't have. This game showed what this year has been about for us."" Messi has been critical of the board this season and suggested everyone at the club should take their share of the blame. ""After the break Madrid have not lost any games and they deserve credit for that but we have also helped them a lot,"" said Messi. ""We lost a lot of games that we should not have lost and we have to be self-critical, starting with the players, but it has to be a total self-criticism from everyone because we are Barcelona and we are obliged to win the matches whatever happens and instead look at us."" If Barcelona come through against Napoli, they will face Bayern Munich in the last eight, with a compressed format of single legs all the way through to the final. ""I think we need a little air, this break will be good for us, to clear our heads, forget about everything that has happened,"" said Messi. ""It has been very bad from December until now but it is the Champions League and there are four games that can give you a trophy that we all want. But we have to change a lot and be very self-critical."""
144,13/07/2020,13:45,"Talks with Inter over Martinez have 'stopped', says Barca's Bartomeu",Barcelona president Josep Maria Bartomeu said on Monday discussions with Inter Milan over the possible signing of Argentina striker Lautaro Martinez had stopped.,"The 22-year-old Martinez, who has scored 17 goals in all competitions for Inter this season, has been heavily linked with a move to the Camp Nou. ""We spoke with Inter a few weeks ago but now the discussions have stopped. Now we are not speaking,"" Bartomeu told Catalan television. ""We have to finish La Liga and the Champions League and then see what the priorities are."" He also said Barca were not anticipating making a summer move for former forward Neymar, who Paris Saint-Germain made the world's most expensive player in 2017. ""I don't think PSG will put any player on the market and Neymar is a PSG player,"" he said. There have been fresh doubts about the future of Lionel Messi in recent weeks, with the six-time Ballon d'Or winner reportedly frustrated with the club's failure to build a world-class squad. Spanish media reported earlier this month Messi had broken off negotiations on extending his contract, which expires next year. ""With Messi we talk, we have talked and we will talk,"" insisted Bartomeu. ""He is the best player in football history and has years in football ahead. I have no doubt that he will stay with Barca. His future is here in football and after football."" Bartomeu also confirmed under-pressure coach Quique Setien would stay in his post at least until the end of the season. ""We went to Setien's house to talk about the future, about the planning for the next season."" Barcelona sit second in the La Liga table with two matches remaining, one point behind arch rivals and leaders Real Madrid, who play their game in hand against Granada later on Monday."
145,12/07/2020,13:33,Griezmann may miss season finale due to thigh injury,Antoine Griezmann looks set to miss the rest of the season afer Barcelona said on Sunday the France attacker had a thigh injury.,"The World Cup winner went off at half-time of Saturday's 1-0 win over Valladolid after apparently asking to be subbed. ""He came off because he had a problem,"" Barcelona coach Quique Setien said Saturday. ""It was him who asked for the change."" ""Tests this morning have shown that first-team player Antoine Griezmann has a muscle injury in the quadriceps of his right leg,"" Barca said on their website. ""He is therefore not available for selection at the present time,"" a statement said of the 29-year-old who has scored 15 goals in 46 games this season. It would appear Griezmann will miss Barcelona's final La Liga matches with Real Madrid needing five points from their final three games to win the title. Barca also face a Champions League last-16 second leg on August 8 after drawing 1-1 at Napoli before the lockdown."
146,11/07/2020,21:58,Messi tees up victory as Barcelona cling on to fading title hopes,"Lionel Messi made it 20 assists for the season in Barcelona's stodgy 1-0 win over Real Valladolid on Saturday, even as his team's La Liga challenge appears almost over.","Messi teed up Arturo Vidal's winner at Jose Zorilla to become the first player to provide 20 assists in Spain's top flight since Xavi Hernandez in 2009. Victory for Barca means Real Madrid cannot clinch the title on Monday by beating Granada but only an incredible collapse will prevent them putting their name on the trophy later in the week. If they beat Granada, Madrid will win La Liga by prevailing at home to Villarreal on Thursday, regardless of Barcelona's results. Overall, Madrid need only five points from their remaining three matches to secure their third La Liga title in eight years. ""We are doing things that deserve more than where we are,"" said Barca coach Quique Setien. ""To win La Liga, I don't know, because our rival is winning everything."" Yet even as Barca's turbulent domestic campaign draws to a close, Messi continues to shine. His delightful pass for Vidal in the 15th minute, a scoop between two Valladolid defenders, triggered more remarkable milestones. As well as matching the best La Liga total for assists by one player in the last 11 years, Messi extends his own career-best number of assists in a single league season. He also becomes only the second player in the 21st century from the five major European leagues to hit 20 goals and 20 assists in the same campaign, after Thierry Henry in 2002-03. Messi has halted negotiations to extend his current contract, which expires in 2021, perhaps to express frustration with the running of the club. As Barcelona's title challenge has wilted, Setien's position has come under scrutiny too, despite him only taking over in January. But he was bold against Valladolid, deploying a 3-5-2 formation, with Nelson Semedo and Jordi Alba as wing-backs and the versatile Sergi Roberto dropping into the back three. Luis Suarez started on the bench but replaced Antoine Griezmann at half-time, the Frenchman enduring one of his quieter displays before having to go off injured. ""He came off because he had a problem,"" Setien said. ""It was him who asked for the change."" After playing Messi behind Suarez and Griezmann against Villarreal on Sunday, Setien appears to be experimenting, perhaps with an eye on the Champions League's resumption next month. Or he may be making the best of a stretched squad that appears to be feeling the effects of fatigue. Setien only named five outfield players on the bench. ""We've had a lot of games, a lot of wear and a lot of players playing a lot of minutes. It's not rocket science,"" he said. ""When you're tired, you lose more balls, make bad decisions. It's normal."" The system worked well in the first half but Barca's problem of converting possession into chances remained and Valladolid grew in confidence late on. Defeat leaves Valladolid 14th but survival looks all-but secured, with seven points between them and the bottom three. Griezmann snatched at an early finish inside the box before Vidal showed him how it was done. Messi recovered the ball on the edge of the area and after receiving it back from Semedo, scooped it through to Vidal, who gathered and unleashed all in one movement to find the far corner. Valladolid's Kike Perez raced clear of Gerard Pique but lost his footing at the crucial moment before Messi weaved through but drove wide. Marc-Andre Ter Stegen had to make two saves in the second half as Valladolid pushed, the first from an Enes Unal header and the second in injury-time, after Sandro Ramirez was allowed space at the back post. Earlier, Celta Vigo surrendered a valuable point in the relegation battle by conceding in the 91st-minute to Osasuna, Jose Arnaiz sealing a 2-1 win. Defeat means Celta stay four points clear of the bottom three but having played a game more than those below them."
147,10/07/2020,05:56,Van Bronckhorst 'can't imagine' Barcelona without Messi,"Former Barcelona defender Giovanni van Bronckhorst told AFP that he hopes Lionel Messi will finish his career at the Camp Nou, as speculation swirls about the superstar's future.","Messi is reportedly frustrated with Barcelona's failure to build a top-notch squad, and tired of purported leaks from the Spanish club which paint him in a bad light. Radio station Cadena Ser reported last week that the Argentine had broken off negotiations on extending his contract, which runs until 2021, and was thinking of leaving. Dutchman van Bronckhorst, 45, who is now coaching Guangzhou R&amp;F in China, told AFP: ""I would love to see him be part of Barcelona for his whole career. ""He's one of the (few) players to stay his whole career at the same club. ""I admire him as a person and a player and hopefully he will stay there. That's what I'd love to see."" Van Bronckhorst left Arsenal for Barcelona in 2003 and won the Champions League in 2006, when a young Messi was already building a fearsome reputation. ""I've known him since he was 16 and now he's 33,"" said Van Bronckhorst. ""He's developed into a great human being, he's a family man and he's more than capable of making his own decisions about where his future lies and whether he leaves. ""He will decide himself, but I can't imagine a Barcelona without him."" Barcelona president Josep Maria Bartomeu this week responded to the storm of speculation by saying that the club had ""an obligation"" to keep Messi, calling him ""the best player in history"". Messi, who said in February he did not believe Barcelona could win the Champions League on current form, has had regular disagreements with the club's board. He reacted publicly when sporting director Eric Abidal appeared to blame the players for the sacking of Ernesto Valverde in January. He also led the fightback from the Barcelona players over a dispute with the board in March regarding pay cuts during the coronavirus pandemic."
148,09/07/2020,00:00,Barcelona stay in touch with Real Madrid and send down rivals Espanyol down,Barcelona kept their faint title hopes alive and doomed Espanyol to relegation on Wednesday as Luis Suarez's goal proved the winner in a pivotal Catalan derby at the top and bottom of La Liga.,"A cagey contest at Camp Nou exploded into life for six frantic minutes at the start of the second half as Ansu Fati and Pol Lozano were sent off, leaving each side with 10 men before Suarez struck. Suarez profitted after another superb contribution from a reinvigorated Antoine Griezmann, his backheel setting up Lionel Messi to shoot, with Suarez turning in the rebound. This 1-0 victory was a far cry from the sparkling 4-1 win over Villarreal on Sunday but it moves Barca to within a point of Real Madrid, who play their game in hand at home to Alaves on Friday. Espanyol, rooted to the bottom of the table, will be relegated. They sit 11 points adrift of safety with only three games left to play. ""Life or death"" read the front page of Mundo Deportivo on Thursday morning - for Barcelona, who had to win to stay in touch with Madrid, and for Espanyol, given they needed a victory to prolong their survival effort. Griezmann's combination with Suarez and Messi, coming after his sumptuous chip against Villarreal, sustains the Frenchman's momentum but this was more of a gritty win against an Espanyol team that hit the post at 0-0 and had chances. With the superior head-to-head and a kind last four fixtures, Real Madrid remain firm favourites. ""We have to win our next three games,"" said Suarez. ""What Madrid do is up to them. If they drop points, fantastic. We just have to be there if they do."" Espanyol needed to win but have not beaten Barcelona in the league since 2009 when Mauricio Pochettino was in charge and Rufete, the team's fourth coach this season, accepted Messi's commiserations at the final whistle with a look of resignation. The club's supporters this week expressed anger after a ""shameful season"" under the Chinese Rastar Group, which took majority control in 2016. Only Barcelona, Real Madrid and Athletic Bilbao have spent more seasons in the top flight than Espanyol, who after 26 consecutive campaigns there must now rebuild. ""We ask forgiveness from our fans,"" said Javi Lopez. ""We know these are tough moments for us but for our fans as well. This season nothing has gone right. It's our fault and we are committed to coming back stronger."" Barcelona had a lot of the ball in the first half but did little with it and in fact Espanyol had the better chances on the counter-attack. Adri Embarba sped away down the right after honing on goal his finish had to be blocked by the outstretched right leg of Marc-Andre ter Stegen. Ter Stegen was called upon again before half-time and this time Didac Vila raced clear down the left, his shot rebounding off the goalkeeper and Clement Lenglet before falling back to Vila, who hit the far post. Quique Setien acted at the break, bringing Fati on and shifting Sergi Roberto to right-back but the 17-year-old lasted only five minutes, a high challenge on Fernando Calero earning in him a straight red card on review. But any advantage Espanyol had was short-lived because Lozano then flew in high on Gerard Pique, with his studs up, and was also sent off to make it 10 against 10. With the numbers equal but the spaces bigger, Barcelona could attack with greater freedom and they took the lead three minutes later. A delightful Griezmann backheel teed up Messi to shoot and the ball spilled out for Suarez to tap in. Messi almost added a second with a thumping volley at the back post while Espanyol wanted a penalty in injury-time when a shot hit the shoulder of Arturo Vidal. The appeals were rightly waved away. Villarreal had earlier beaten Getafe 3-1 to reduce the gap behind Sevilla in fourth to three points. Santi Cazorla scored two penalties for Villarreal to all-but end Getafe's own hopes of Champions League qualification. Sevilla play away at Athletic Bilbao on Thursday."
149,07/07/2020,19:15,Barca say CAS 'dismiss' Neymar appeal by Santos,Barcelona say they have been cleared by the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) over claims of fraud during the 2013 signing of Neymar from Brazilian club Santos.,"In the case that came before the CAS Santos claimed Barcelona owed them over 61 million euros ($69 million) from the 2013 transfer. ""The Court of Arbitration for Sport has dismissed the appeal made by Santos to FIFA in which the Brazilian club claimed a payment of 61,295,000 euros in damages from FC Barcelona and the corresponding sporting bans with regards to the transfer of Neymar Jr."" The CAS also ordered Santos to pay Barcelona's court costs and cleared the Catalan club of making any illegal payments. ""The CAS considers that the contract between Santos and the player was ended by mutual agreement and that FC Barcelona did not behave in a fraudulent manner when it signed a pre-contract with Neymar Jr, nor when it signed a transfer agreement with Santos."" Neymar left Barcelona for Paris Saint-Germain in 2017 for a world record transfer fee of 222 million euros."
150,07/07/2020,13:10,'We have obligation to re-sign Messi' says Barcelona president,"Barcelona president Josep Maria Bartomeu responded to a storm of speculation by saying on Tuesday that the club had ""an obligation to re-sign"" Lionel Messi, calling him ""the best player in history"".","""Normally we do not explain the discussions with players but it is evident that we have the obligation to re-sign him"", Bartomeu told Catalan radio station Rac1. ""He is the best player in history. He has many years of football left."" Bartomeu also said Barca coach Quique Setien would keep his job despite a run of unconvincing form since La Liga's restart that has seen the reigning champions lose top spot to Real Madrid. The president said he was happy with the direction of the club and maintained he had been right to replace Ernesto Valverde in January. Bartomeu also said Barcelona are trying to have the second leg of the Champions League second leg against Napoli played at the Camp Nou instead of at a neutral venue. Last week, another radio station, Cadena Ser, reported that Messi had broken off negotiations on extending his contract, which runs until 2021, and was thinking of leaving Barcelona. The report said Messi was frustrated with the club's failure to build a winning squad and was tired of leaks from the club which paint him in a bad light. He was also reportedly upset at reports that the players had got Valverde fired. But Bartomeu said: ""I see a relaxed Leo... He has said many times that he wants to finish (his career) at Barca."" Bartomeu, who must stand down in 2021, insisted that he sees Messi ""retiring at Barca under another president because he will sign for another spell."" Bartomeu said he spoke to his captain on Saturday. ""I talk to the players very often. Not only with Leo, but also with the group, especially with the captains. Besides, lately we have a lot of topics to talk about,"" said Bartomeu. Before beating Villarreal 4-1 on Sunday, Barcelona had drawn three of their previous four matches and slipped four points behind Real in the title race, putting Setien under pressure. ""Setien will continue, of course,"" said Bartomeu. ""I am quite happy with the development we are showing in the games despite the draws. ""I do not regret the change of Valverde. The team needed a boost. Setien knows our DNA, the model and he has brought fresh air and new ideas and is working hard,"" said Bartomeu before adding that ""coaches, evidently, need results."" ""If La Liga, which will be difficult, is not won then comes the Champions League in August. We have to try to win one and then the other,"" said Bartomeu. He said that Barca are trying to ensure home advantage for the second leg of the Champions League tie against Napoli. The clubs drew the first leg 1-1 in Naples on February 25 before the season was interrupted. ""We are fighting for the second leg of the round of 16 to be played at the Camp Nou. UEFA, if the situation is normal, knows that we would play here,"" Bartomeu said In Spain, one of the countries most affected by the pandemic, one of the main outbreaks has been in an inland area of Catalonia, where regional authorities on Saturday announced the isolation of some 200,000 inhabitants in an area around the city of Lerida, about 150 kilometres (93 miles) west of Barcelona."
151,07/07/2020,02:48,Barca wake from slumber to give glimmer of hope to Setien,"""Barcelona haven't thrown in the towel"", read the front page of Mundo Deportivo after a night that offered hope to the team and a lifeline for their coach Quique Setien.","Setien has been in charge for only three months of competitive football but looked likely to be out in the cold by next season, following Tuesday's draw away at Atletico Madrid. Three draws in four games, deteriorating performances and unrest in the dressing room were all stacking up against Barca's new coach but the loudest alarm bell of all was rung by his captain. Frustrated with the lack of direction at the club, Lionel Messi halted talks about extending his contract beyond 2021 and his current plan is now to leave, said Spanish radio station Cadena Ser. Messi's principal grievance is not with Setien but Barcelona's board who, under president Josep Maria Bartomeu, have overseen a string of political blunders off the pitch and a period of decline on it. With presidential elections to come next year, Messi's hesitation may be aimed at undermining this regime to accelerate change, but Setien was undoubtedly caught in the crossfire. Amid the chaos at Barcelona, he has increasingly looked like a bystander, ""a passenger"" according to Antoine Griezmann's father, demonstrated all too literally by his lack of influence in team talks. Messi ignored him and his number two Eder Sarabia during one water break and the contrast was unfortunate against Atletico, whose players huddled round, hanging on the every word of their coach Diego Simeone. And yet the 4-1 victory over Villarreal on Sunday gave a glimpse of what this Barca could look like under Setien and what presumably the board were hoping for when they appointed him in January. Free-flowing, dynamic, confident, it was the team's best performance under Setien and perhaps their most complete all season. Some complaints were answered too as Griezmann started, played well, scored a sensational chip and combined instinctively with Luis Suarez and Messi. The passing was quicker and the chances more regular, a welcome improvement after a series of plodding displays in which possession too often came at the expense of end product. And Setien was bold, dropping Messi back into a more central attacking position behind Griezmann and Suarez, who was then taken off after an hour with the result still not yet secure. It was a morale-boosting win that will surely come too late for Barca's title bid given Madrid's four-point lead and a friendly looking run-in. But it might renew some faith in Setien, from Bartomeu, who visited his house for discussions last week, and from Messi, whose approval is the one that really counts. Removing Setien this summer would be another admission of failure for Barca, who would have to pay compensation they cannot afford and find a replacement for a job that might prove difficult to promote. This is a squad that needs renovating at a time when funds are no longer readily available while the prospect of presidential change next year would offer a new coach little long-term security. Xavi Hernandez is waiting in the wings, with his new Al-Saad contract reportedly containing a break clause that allows him to join his former club at any time. Setien, for another season at least, would be the easier option then but a failing team will not help Bartomeu and it will not bring comfort to Messi either. At 33, every year for him is precious. Barcelona have four games left and then the Champions League next month, with the chance to resuscitate one of their most disappointing seasons in recent memory. Setien's future depends on it."
152,04/07/2020,18:33,Messi doubts reflect chaos at Barcelona,Barcelona may be about to lose the league but losing Lionel Messi would be much harder to stomach.,"Messi's contract is due to expire next year and the Argentinian has reportedly stopped talks due to frustrations with the direction of the club. ""Messi is planning to leave Barca,"" Spanish radio Cadena Ser said on Thursday. ""Right now, Messi's idea is to finish his contract in 2021 and leave Barcelona. Messi has stalled on the extension of his contract. Negotiations had started very well, with a good understanding between the two parties, but recent events have made Messi reconsider everything."" Asked about suggestions Messi plans to leave Barcelona, coach Quique Setien said on Saturday: ""I won't speculate about this because I haven't heard from him so I'm not aware of him saying anything. ""I see him well, everything else is speculation that I won't get involved in. We speak about what we have to speak about and nothing else."" Barcelona play away at in-form Villarreal on Sunday evening. Real Madrid could by then have extended their lead at the top of the table. They face Athletic Bilbao a few hours earlier. Real manager Zinedine Zidane was asked about Messi's potential departure on Thursday. ""I don't know what will happen but we hope not because he is in this league and we want the best in this league,"" said Zidane. Messi said in February he did not believe Barcelona could win the Champions League on current form. The 33-year-old has also had regular disagreements with the club's board, headed by president Josep Maria Bartomeu. Messi reacted publicly when sporting director Eric Abidal appeared to blame the players for the sacking of Ernesto Valverde in January. He also led the fightback from the players over the dispute with the board in March regarding pay cuts during the coronavirus pandemic. ""We cannot help but be surprised that from within the club there are those trying to put us under the microscope or apply pressure for us to do something that we have always been clear that we would do,"" said Messi. Barcelona's presidential elections are due to be held in 2021, when Bartomeu will have to step aside. Among those set to run is Victor Font, who wants to appoint Messi's former team-mate Xavi Hernandez as coach. Yet Barca's form, as well as suggestions of unrest in the dressing room, have placed scrutiny on Setien's job in the short-term. He has a contract until 2022, with a break clause in 2021, but it remains to be seen if he is in charge for next season, or even the Champions League in August. ""I have experienced it other times,"" said Setien, when asked about the uncertainty. ""It is not something I can control. This the circus that we are in and we accept it. ""I don't exhaust myself by reading or listening to the noise around me."" Xavi replacing Setien would reinvigorate Messi, and perhaps the team, but the Spaniard is unlikely to take charge while Bartomeu is still in place. That means Xavi would have to wait at least another year. Messi's reluctance to continue contract negotiations could be a political ploy aimed at undermining the current board further. But at 33, he also does not have time to waste. Unless Barcelona unexpectedly go all the way next month, it will be five years since the world's best player has won the Champions League.

The former Lyon defender has made 18 appearances for Barca this season but was sidelined for almost two months between September and November with foot and knee injuries. Umtiti, who has battled a series of injuries since helping France win the 2018 World Cup, also hurt his calf shortly after the team returned to training following the coronavirus lockdown in May. He has featured in just two of Barca's six games since the restart, starting last weekend's 2-2 draw at Celta Vigo. Defending champions Barca trail leaders Real Madrid by four points in La Liga with five matches left to play."
154,01/07/2020,17:17,An expensive mistake? No place for Griezmann as Barcelona title hopes fade,"Barcelona's hopes of retaining the Spanish title look to be slipping away after Tuesday's 2-2 draw with Atletico Madrid, and the decision to leave Antoine Griezmann on the bench for almost the whole game appeared to sum up the malaise which has taken hold in the Catalan capital.","Twice Barcelona led against Atletico at the Camp Nou only to be pegged back and forced to settle for a third draw in their last four La Liga outings which leaves them a point behind leaders Real Madrid having played a game more. The scenario was a repeat of last weekend, when Quique Setien's team were ahead twice away at Celta Vigo only to draw 2-2. Real can now go four points clear by beating Getafe on Thursday, while also boasting the head-to-head advantage over their title rivals. And yet while Barca desperately needed three points against Atletico, Setien saw no reason to send on Griezmann until the 90th minute. The French World Cup winner was also only brought on as a late substitute against Celta, but Tuesday amounted to a humiliation for Griezmann against his former club, who sold him for 120 million euros ($135 million) last summer. Sergi Roberto and 17-year-old Ansu Fati had already come on before Setien turned to Griezmann as a last-minute replacement for Arturo Vidal. When asked about the bit-part role to which his former player was restricted, Atletico coach Diego Simeone's reply was as cutting as it was short. ""Speechless"", said the Argentine. ""It is true that it is hard bringing him on like that, for a player of his level. But the circumstances forced me to do it,"" said Setien. ""I could have taken a different decision, not brought him on for example, but you always have the hope that a player like him can win you the game."" Setien added that he would not be apologising to the 29-year-old and claimed the player would understand why he was left out. Nevertheless, Setien's handling of Griezmann can only increase the pressure on the coach, who has not won over those who doubted his ability to succeed at the Camp Nou after he was appointed in January. Having excelled under Simeone at Atletico, Griezmann always appeared an unnatural fit for Barcelona, wedded to their 4-3-3 formation or variations thereof. The Frenchman looks even more out of place with Luis Suarez back fit to team up with Lionel Messi in attack. Messi scored his 700th career goal on Tuesday. Griezmann, meanwhile, has just eight goals in La Liga this season, his lowest return since netting seven for Real Sociedad in 2011/12. He has scored just one league goal in 2020, not enough when you are one of the most expensive footballers of all time. More importantly for Setien, a third straight title looks beyond Barcelona. When appointed in January, the 61-year-old ex-Betis coach admitted he could not promise to make his team win. ""But I promise that my team will play well,"" he said. They are not even doing that, and it is impossible to watch this Barca side and not long for the glorious football played by Pep Guardiola's team almost a decade ago now, or even Frank Rijkaard's dazzling side of several years before that, when Messi was just emerging. ""I am used to finding myself in difficult situations. I might not be as happy as I was at the beginning, but inside I am doing fine,"" Setien said, while insisting that the dressing room was behind him. Time is running out already for Setien, not least because time is running out for Messi to win trophies with Barca. The Argentine, who has 22 La Liga goals this season, has just turned 33. Missing out on what would be an 11th La Liga crown in 16 years would be one thing, but the pressure is building towards the latter stages of the Champions League, due to be played in August. Messi and Barca have not won that trophy since 2015. They still need to get through a last-16 second leg against Napoli in order to qualify for the final eight in Lisbon."
155,01/07/2020,01:35,Messi scores 700th goal but Atletico draw hurts Barca's title hopes,Lionel Messi scored his 700th career goal but Barcelona suffered another blow to their La Liga title hopes after a 2-2 draw with Atletico Madrid on Tuesday.,"Messi chipped in a penalty to reach another astonishing milestone at Camp Nou but twice Atletico hit back with spot-kicks of their own, Saul Niguez converting both after Barca took an early lead through Diego Costa's own goal. The result gives Real Madrid the chance to move four points clear at the top of the table if they can overcome Getafe at home on Wednesday, a formidable lead with five games left. Atletico stay third, two points ahead of Sevilla, who won 3-0 at Leganes. With a superior head-to-head, it would take a dramatic capitulation for Real Madrid not to lift the trophy from here but there is no guarantee Barcelona can finish strongly enough even to create pressure. This was their third draw in four matches and with suggestions of disharmony between the players and coaching staff, the future of coach Quique Setien looks bleak too. ""From the dressing room I feel supported, yes,"" he said. ""And regarding the meeting with the board, I will not say what was said in that."" Setien was also asked about his job on Monday and had to play down the significance of a frank exchange of views in the dressing room following Saturday's draw at Celta Vigo. Messi had also caused a stir by appearing to ignore Setien's assistant Eder Sarabia during a water break at Vigo and on Tuesday it was impossible to ignore the contrast with Atletico's players, who huddled around Diego Simeone while 50 metres away Setien stood alone. At full-time, Setien stared into space with the look of a coach that is running out of time but he had taken bold decisions, leaving 120-million-euro signing Antoine Griezmann on the bench and handing another start to 20-year-old Riqui Puig. ""It's true that taking him out of the team like that is hard for a player of his level but the circumstances forced me to do it,"" said Setien of Griezmann. ""Tomorrow I will speak to him, not to apologise, but it is a decision he has to understand."" Yet it started well for them as Costa endured a nightmare first quarter of an hour, first diverting Messi's corner into his own net after misjudging the flight of the ball at the near post. Then he missed a penalty, won after the excellent Yannick Carrasco left Gerard Pique for dead and then cut back inside Arturo Vidal, who stuck out a leg. Costa's shot was saved but VAR showed Marc-Andre ter Stegen had sprung off his line too early and Atletico were given a second chance. This time Saul took the ball and he scored the equaliser. Messi dinked over the sliding Renan Lodi and then whistled a curling effort past the far post. His deflected free-kick forced Jan Oblak to adjust his feet and palm over. Finally, it was laid on a plate for him shortly after half-time. Felipe clipped Nelson Semedo and Messi, with the 700th in sight, chipped the ball delicately down the middle. But every time Barca pulled away, Atletico pegged them back. Another penalty was awarded, again instigated by the speedy Carrasco, who made the most of the slightest touch from Semedo. Saul took responsibility again and while Ter Stegen got a hand to it, the ball squirmed into the corner. Vidal twice went close, the second time heading wide Jordi Alba's cross, and Thomas Lemar might even have won it for Atletico in injury-time. For Barca, the draw was damaging enough. Earlier, Sevilla's Oliver Torres scored twice and Munir El Haddadi added a third to see off Leganes and boost their hopes of holding onto fourth place. Sevilla sit five points ahead of Getafe, having played a game more. Leganes stay 19th, nine points adrift of safety."
156,29/06/2020,16:44,Setien in the spotlight but familiar flaws haunt Barcelona,The weight of blame may be shifting again towards their coach but Barcelona's failures in the draw away at Celta Vigo on Saturday go deeper than Quique Setien.,"Setien admitted on Monday he is ""new to this situation"", a novice when it comes to the challenge of massaging egos of elite players and managing their frustrations. Barca's board might have foreseen that being a problem in January, when they tasked a talented coach with winning the Champions League, a competition in which he was yet to oversee a single match. They were attracted to Setien's dedication to a Barcelona-style too, even if an identity shift mid-season, amid a chaotic transfer window, always looked impossible. Instead, engrained fragilities remain five months later, three of them with neither training nor matches. And all of them resurfaced against Celta, where the 2-2 draw that might set Real Madrid on their way to the title ran like a checklist of Barca's all-too familiar flaws. There was capitulation, an inability to defend a lead or soak up pressure seen previously on a grander scale against Roma and Liverpool, defeats that have perhaps never been expunged from this team's psyche. It was another stumble away from home too, making it 23 points from 16 games on the road this season, three fewer than 13th-placed Southampton have mustered in the Premier League. And when Celta tore away on the counter-attack, they found space at will, driving through the heart of a Barcelona midfield that has long been exposed by speedy opponents on the break. Yet their trump cards were in play too: the brilliance of Lionel Messi, the goals of Luis Suarez and the match-turning saves of Marc-Andre ter Stegen, who clawed one off the line late on to at least preserve a point. Repeatedly, those players have lifted this Barcelona side above themselves, carrying them even to consecutive La Liga titles, each time with a lead of more than 10 points. They could still make it a third, if Madrid follow up five wins out of five by caving during a run-in that looks significantly kinder than Barca's. But even if the unexpected happens in the remaining six games of the season, another domestic success for Barcelona will feel hollow and few expect them to threaten in the adapted Champions League in August, not even Messi. ""The way we are now I don't think it's enough to win the Champions League,"" he told Mundo Deportivo in February. Their players argued in the dressing room on Saturday because they know they are way off. Messi ignored Setien's assistant Eder Sarabia, frustrated at the end of yet another campaign where the club has wasted his talent. Messi, Sergio Busquets and Gerard Pique have all taken shots at the board in recent months. Under president Josep Maria Bartomeu, decisions seem to be taken haphazardly, without direction and often with the financial merits in mind. Arthur Melo came on as a substitute on Saturday, the 23-year-old once with Barca's DNA in his veins, who was circled as the long-term replacement for Xavi Hernandez. Instead, Arthur will be sold to Juventus as part of an accounting merry-go-round that allows the board to balance the books before June 30. Antoine Griezmann came on too, the 120-million euro signing from Atletico Madrid who was reportedly never wanted by key players and has been rarely played in his best position. Of the 11 that started at Balaidos, six were 31 or older, and at least three were reportedly offered to Paris Saint-Germain last year in a botched attempt to bring back Neymar. Barcelona face Atletico Madrid at Camp Nou on Tuesday, looking to salvage their season but the future already looks bleak for Setien. He was asked about his job on Monday, five months after he arrived. ""Victories hide many things, defeats reveal them,"" he said. ""Sometimes the results don't depend on me."""
157,27/06/2020,19:32,Title blow as Barcelona draw with Celta,"Barcelona's title hopes suffered a hammer blow on Saturday as they were held to a 2-2 draw by Celta Vigo, handing Real Madrid the chance to move two points clear at the top of La Liga.","Luis Suarez twice put Barca in front at Balaidos with his first goals since January but Iago Aspas bent in a late free-kick to earn Celta a draw, in what could prove a pivotal moment in the title race. Barcelona edge a point ahead of Madrid but Zinedine Zidane's side will hope to take a big step towards becoming champions by winning away at bottom club Espanyol on Sunday. Madrid own the superior head-to-head against Barca and have won four out of four since La Liga restarted earlier this month. With a kinder run-in than the Catalans, who play Atletico Madrid next on Tuesday, the trophy appears to be Madrid's to lose. ""The feeling is a negative one,"" said Suarez afterwards. ""If we want to stay in the title race and have it in our hands we have to win all our games. But we now have to rely on Madrid to drop points."" Suarez played his best game since undergoing knee surgery in January, his first goal coming from a surprise free-kick from Lionel Messi, who crossed when everyone expected him to shoot. Yet Barcelona's defensive frailties hurt them again and Celta should even have won it in injury-time, only for Nolito to miss a golden chance at the back post. Celta climb to 16th, eight points clear of the bottom three. Quique Setien answered calls to start 20-year-old Riqui Puig and 17-year-old Ansu Fati, and the duo impressed, injecting energy and speed into Barca's attack. Antoine Griezmann was left on the bench and when he came on, he was on the side of the wall that Aspas breached with his free-kick to find the bottom corner. Messi was at the heart of everything going forward and it was his early corner that Gerard Pique headed against the crossbar. With a free-kick on the edge of the area in the 20th minue and a 700th career goal in sight, Messi sized up the sprawl of Celta defenders in front of him. But with everone expecting a shot, Messi clipped a cross towards the post, where Suarez headed in. Messi even tried to score from a corner but Celta had chances too on the break. A poor clearance from Marc-Andre ter Stegen went unpunished by Fedor Smolov, who then overhit his pass when Aspas was clear. Brais Mendez slid through and hit the post. The warnings went unheeded and when Arturo Vidal played a careless pass early in the second half, Celta capitalised. Aspas sent Okay Yokuslu sprinting in behind and he squared for Smolov to tap in. Celta look invigorated but Barca landed a sucker-punch. Denis Suarez lost possession under pressure from Fati, Messi played into Luis Suarez, who backed in, turned and drove into the far corner. It looked like they had weathered the storm but Celta hit back again, Aspas curling around the side of the wall and into the corner with two minutes left. They should even have won it in injury-time as Denis Suarez teed up Nolito at the back post but a scuffed finish let Ter Stegen save on the line."
158,26/06/2020,18:19,"No word from Barca on Arthur departure, says Setien","Quique Setien said Friday that Barcelona had not told him that Arthur Melo was leaving the Catalan giants, with the Brazil midfielder being tipped to move to Juventus.","""I'm counting on him and he has a chance to play,"" Setien told reporters ahead of Barca's La Liga match at Celta Vigo on Saturday. ""We need to make sure that this noise doesn't affect him and that he is able to give his very best. The club has not told me that he will be sold."" Spanish and Italian media report that Arthur, 23, will move to Serie A leaders and reigning champions Juve, with Miralem Pjanic moving in the other direction. The Gazzetta Dello Sport reports that the deal will see Juve pay Barca 10 million euros ($11.2 million), and that Arthur has agreed personal terms with Juve. ""I don't now if he will leave, some people say it's better to keep him because of his young age, others the opposite,"" added Setien. ""He will be with us until the final match of the season, and if he thinks of leaving afterwards, he needs to manage that, think about the fact that he still has things to do here, leave a good memory and be honest until the end."" Barca are second in La Liga, level on 68 points with leaders Real Madrid, and go into Saturday's clash at Celta Vigo with a tight tussle for the title awaiting them with seven games remaining in the season. ""(The current situation) is not normal, it all to play for and any player in that situation knows that the season is not over,"" said Setien. ""I don't doubt for a minute the professionalism and the honesty of the players until the last day."""
159,26/06/2020,03:48,La Liga title race in the balance but Madrid seize momentum,Real Madrid and Barcelona are neck-and-neck in the closest title race in Europe as La Liga's top two have enjoyed an almost faultless return since Spanish football resumed two weeks ago.,"But Barca's performances have been less convincing than their results and a draw away at Sevilla has allowed Madrid to clear a two-point deficit and reclaim first place due to a superior head-to-head. Beneath them, Atletico Madrid have surged into third, their concerns of missing out on Champions League qualification evaporating almost entirely as their top-four rivals have crumbled around them. The three-month suspension has also had varying effects at the bottom, where Celta Vigo and Eibar have managed to pull away, leaving Real Mallorca, Leganes and Espanyol with a mountain to climb. Here, AFP Sport draws five conclusions from the first two weeks since La Liga resumed. When Real Madrid restarted, many wondered whether the recovery of Eden Hazard might propel them ahead of Barcelona down the final straight. But Karim Benzema has been the catalyst for four wins out of four, the Frenchman coming back at his sharp, confident and clinical best. Benzema's touch and volley against Valencia may be goal of the season while his link-up with Hazard could finally offer an answer to the void left by Cristiano Ronaldo. Hazard's fitness is still a worry. The Belgian came off after an hour against Mallorca on Wednesday as Zinedine Zidane appears keen to manage his minutes. But the defence has been rock solid again, with Thibaut Courtois making a crucial save against Valencia that might yet prove a pivotal moment. That steel, and Benzema, makes Madrid favourites. Barcelona have taken 10 points out of 12 and even a draw away at Sevilla hardly deserves to be called a slip-up. Yet their performances have left the unavoidable sense that they will drop more points during the run-in and perhaps against difficult opponents coming up. They play away at a resurgent Celta Vigo on Saturday before hosting in-form Atletico Madrid three days later. They then visit Villarreal, who have shot up into contention for the top four. On form, Barca would be confident against all three but Quique Setien's side have looked ponderous, with even Lionel Messi seeming frustrated in a 1-0 win over Athleic Bilbao on Tuesday. Riqui Puig and Ansu Fati have injected some much-needed energy off the bench and it might be that Setien has to trust in youth if Barcelona are to keep pace. For now, they are clinging on. Atletico Madrid were sixth, one point outside the top four before Spanish football returned. Two weeks later, they are third, with a six-point cushion ahead of fifth. Concerns about the club missing out on the Champions League were very real, particularly as Atletico have been one of the clubs worst-affected financially by the coronavirus pandemic. But three wins and a draw make them favourites to finish third, let alone fourth, with Marcos Llorente key in his new, more advanced role of second striker. Atletico's resurgence has been even more effective as their rivals have floundered. Real Sociedad and Getafe have failed to muster a single victory between them since coming back while Valencia and Sevilla have managed only one win each. Atletico are in the driving seat. Any hopes the suspension would reinvigorate La Liga's bottom three have so far come to nothing as Espanyol failed to consolidate after beating Alaves while Mallorca and Leganes have slid further from safety. Instead, those just outside have pulled away as Celta Vigo stormed to consecutive victories, one of them a 6-0 hammering of Alaves, while Eibar outplayed Valencia on Thursday to make it three games unbeaten. Alaves, whose have lost the advantage of their passionate home support, and Real Betis, who sacked their coach Rubi, are both out of form, but would appear to have just enough of a gap to stay safe. La Liga's promise to complete the season looks almost certain to be fulfilled but its innovations have been unable to remove the hollowness of games without fans. Fake crowd noise has given only an impression of normality while the virtual supporters in the stands are a pale imitation of the real thing. On the pitch, cooling breaks are increasingly being turned into teamtalks by coaches and the five substitutions per team has often deflated second halves, when multiple changes make it hard for viewers to keep up. Adaptation was inevitable but supporters will be relieved when normality is eventually restored."
160,24/06/2020,01:01,Barcelona grind out Bilbao win to put pressure back on Madrid,"Barcelona limped to a 1-0 win over Athletic Bilbao on Tuesday that sends them back to the top of La Liga, for 24 hours at least, three points ahead of Real Madrid.","Only a goal from substitute Ivan Rakitic in the 71st minute prevented Barca from another stalemate after a draw at Sevilla on Friday had allowed Real to go top on head-to-head. Madrid will return to the summit if they beat struggling Real Mallorca on Wednesday but Barcelona's victory at least puts the pressure back on Zinedine Zidane's side, whose upward momentum is yet to be reflected by the table. This Barca performance though was hardly a statement of intent, devoid of chances, lacking zip and tinged with frustration rather than the free-flowing football Quique Setien was appointed to bring in. ""We knew it was going to be complicated,"" Setien said. ""Also because of the situation there is some anxiety because there's less and less margin for error. ""Sometimes we didn't play with that composure and that showed in the first half when were more inaccurate than usual. We gave some belief and confidence to Athletic."" Lionel Messi looked particularly wearied by his team's display. The Argentinian was creator-in-chief again but the dependence on him was high and he remains one away from the 700th goal of his career. Rakitic is likely to be among a handful of players allowed to leave this summer. He has not been a regular this season and this was his first Barca goal since the Clasico in March last year. ""It's a difficult period but we have to stick together,"" said Rakitic. ""It was an important goal, it was a tough game, it was hard for us to open the game up."" Arthur Melo started, despite reports he could be close to joining Juventus, and struggled. Sergio Busquets picked up a yellow card and will be suspended against Celta Vigo on Saturday but that should be a simpler assignment than the ones that come after against in-form Atletico Madrid and Villarreal. Athletic Bilbao stay 10th after suffering their first defeat since La Liga returned. They created the better chances in the first half. Inaki Williams, playing his 150th game in a row, darted in behind and Yeray Alvarez should have scored when free at the back post but missed from four yards. Messi cut a frustrated figure as he tried to create a spark but his efforts from distance, including one chip easily collected, hinted at desperation too. In the second half, Messi's lifted pass found Antoine Griezmann clear in the area but Unai Simon was quick to close the space and Griezmann failed to react. Griezmann's disappointing night came to an end when he was replaced by Ansu Fati, who headed over with his first touch. Riqui Puig also came on and it was the 20-year-old's pass that started the attack for the goal. Messi crossed to the back post and Arturo Vidal's header should have been cleared by Mikel Balenziaga. Instead, he gave it back to Messi, whose reverse pass was taken on by Rakitic, who bundled through and finished. Raul Garcia had an open net late on after Gerard Pique and Marc-Andre ter Stegen both evaded a cross but he failed to connect. Fati struck the post with a rebound in injury-time. Earlier, Atletico Madrid continued their surge towards Champions League qualification by winning 1-0 at Levante to climb to third, thanks to an early own goal by Bruno Gonzalez. Since matches restarted in Spain two weeks ago, Atletico have taken 10 points from a possible 12 and are now six points clear of fifth, as their top-four rivals have crumbled around them. One of them is Getafe, who continued their post-suspension slump as they were held to a 1-1 draw against struggling Real Valladolid. Getafe are fifth but without a win in the four games since La Liga resumed. Valladolid are 15th, seven points clear of the relegation zone. Levante stay 11th."

After his team's slip-up, Gerard Pique admitted it would be ""very difficult to win this league"" and said Real Madrid might not drop any more points during the run-in. ""Nothing changes,"" said Zidane in a press conference on Saturday. ""People can say one thing or another but what interests me is the game tomorrow. I have my opinions but I am not going to say them because the same could happen or the complete opposite. ""Everyone can give their opinion but we are thinking of the next match. It's what engages us and nothing else."" Madrid have beaten Eibar and Valencia since the return from the three-month suspension and Karim Benzema has continued his excellent season by taking his tally to 21 goals in 38 games. Benzema scored twice against Valencia, with the second goal a stunning control and volley into the top corner. ""I don't think much has changed with Karim, maybe just his age and experience,"" Zidane said. ""He has been here for many years now and to me he is the same player but he knows it's always possible to improve and that's what he is doing. ""He takes care of himself and has a lot of ambition. People are always interested in how much he is scoring and if he doesn't score, everything is bad. But that's not how I look at it. ""He gives us so many things and if he scores goals, all the better, but I am not interested in a number nine that only scores and otherwise doesn't affect the game. Karim does both."" Marco Asensio also enjoyed a special night against Valencia as he scored with his first touch after coming on to make his first appearance in a year. Asensio had been out with a anterior cruciate ligament injury. ""I am happy with what happened but he has to go step by step,"" said Zidane. ""We have time, we don't now think that's it, he must play every game, no, we have to stay calm. After a serious injury you have to go slowly and that is what we and him are doing."""

After their emphatic 3-0 win over Valencia on Thursday, Zinedine Zidane's side will move level on points with the Catalans if they beat Real Sociedad on Sunday and above them due to their superior record head-to-head. ""Seeing what we've done in the last two rounds, it's going to be very difficult to win this league,"" said a despondent Pique afterwards. ""From what I've seen, it's very hard to see Real Madrid dropping points."" Sevilla, in third, and Valencia, in eighth, always looked capable of shifting the dynamic at the top of the table, with Madrid capitalising to climb back to the summit for the first time since they beat Barcelona on March 1. Asked about Pique's analysis, Barcelona coach Quique Setien said: ""I think it comes from frustration. I am optimistic. I think it will be tough for anyone to take maximum points."" A valuable point for Sevilla, meanwhile, gives them a five-point cushion over Getafe in fifth, albeit having played a game more. Barca could have few complaints at the Ramon Sanchez Pizjuan. They never really troubled Sevilla for any prolonged period and the closest Lionel Messi came to scoring the 700th goal of his career were a pair of free-kicks tipped over. The sight of goalkeeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen jogging up for a late corner demonstrated how big a blow they considered dropping points to be. Yet Real Sociedad are still in the hunt for Champions League qualification and will offer Madrid no guarantees on Sunday while games against Getafe, Athletic Bilbao and Villarreal mean there are still plenty of hurdles for Zidane's team to overcome. Barcelona though would appear to have the tougher run-in, with Athletic Bilbao, Atletico Madrid, Villarreal and local rivals Espanyol coming up. Messi was well-contained by Sevilla and it could be the Argentinian was feeling the effects of a third consecutive 90 minutes in nine days. Setien chose not to rest his captain in either of two comfortable wins over Leganes or Real Mallorca. Instead, Antoine Griezmann dropped to the bench, with Martin Braithwaite preferred in the front three alongside Messi and Luis Suarez, who made his first start since January after recovering from a knee injury. Sevilla's Jules Kounde shot just wide of the post early on but Barcelona controlled the opening 30 minutes, even if chances were few and far between. Messi's curled free-kick was headed off the line by Kounde and Braithwaite almost had a tap-in when Tomas Vaclik spilled, but the ball was hacked away. The half ended with a scuffle and Messi was at the heart of it, squaring up to and then pushing over Sevilla's centre back Diego Carlos. Messi was unhappy with Carlos' challenge on Suarez but escaped punishment. Ever Banega came on at half-time for Sevilla and gave them more purpose in midfield. Munir El Haddadi's shot from the angle was palmed away by Ter Stegen. The game opened up in the final 15 minutes as Jordi Alba made a crucial block to prevent Munir's pass setting up an easy finish in the middle. Alba might then have teed up a winner too but Suarez swept the defender's pull-back over the bar. Sergio Reguilon, on loan at Sevilla from Madrid, had the best chance but he failed to connect with his weaker right foot. Earlier, Gerard Moreno's winner gave Villarreal a 1-0 win away at Granada, putting them within touching distance of the top four. Real Mallorca claimed a 1-1 draw against fellow strugglers Leganes thanks to a stunning late free kick from Oscar Rodriguez."

After 33 appearances, Messi now has 26 goals this season. In his last eight games, he has seven goals and eight assists. The 17-year-old Ansu Fati had earlier given Barcelona the lead, continuing his breakthrough season with a fifth goal in eight league starts. Leganes could have made the reigning champions feel uncomfortable if Miguel-Angel Guerrero had taken either of two golden early opportunities but the first was cleared off the line and the second denied by the post. ""We had a bit of luck at the beginning,"" admitted Barca coach Quique Setien. But his team's reward for a rather underwhelming performance is a five-point advantage over Madrid, who can reduce that back to two by winning at home to Valencia on Thursday. Valencia will be a more thorough examination of Madrid's sharpness after the three-month break and Barca can expect tougher tests to come than Leganes too, starting with a trip to third-placed Sevilla on Friday. Setien will hope Gerard Pique recovers from a nasty challenge that means he will need stitches in his shin. ""It split his shinpad,"" said Setien. ""We hope it's not serious."" Leganes have dropped to the bottom of the table and look doomed to relegation, their chances of survival damaged by Barcelona snatching away their top scorer Martin Braithwaite as an emergency signing in February. Leganes were not alone in feeling the rule had hurt them disproportionately and their sense of injustice might have been deepened by the fact Braithwaite was left on the bench for the entire 90 minutes. Barcelona controlled possession in the first half but created little and would have been behind early on if Guerrero had been more precise. First, Javier Eraso sprinted clear and despite taking too long to shoot, the ball spilled out for Guerrero, whose drive hit the foot of Clement Lenglet on the line. Guerrero had another go moments later, this time from an acute angle, but his rasping half-volley flew across the area and shaved the far post. Barca were laboured, even as they dominated the ball, but Leganes might have been tiring by the 42nd minute when Junior Firpo's bustling run allowed Fati to take an instinctive shot, which he fired through the legs of Rodri Tarin and into the bottom corner. In the 69th minute, Messi gave his team the cushion they wanted, earning a dubious penalty with a storming run. He won the ball on the halfway line, nutmegged one defender and held off two more. After an exchange with Luis Suarez, he was finally knocked over, even if it appeared less of a foul than the previous attempts to stop him. Messi curled into the bottom corner. Suarez had come on for Fati and Sergio Busquets, Gerard Pique, Arthur Melo all departed too as Setien turned his attention to Sevilla. Leganes coach Javier Aguirre was sent off for whistling on the sidelines in injury-time. Earlier, Getafe dropped more points in the race for Champions League qualification as they failed to break down Espanyol despite their opponents playing most of the match with 10 men. A goalless draw represents a missed opportunity for Jose Bordalas' side and they could even have lost to Espanyol, who had Bernardo Espinosa sent off in the 16th minute but are building momentum. Getafe stay fifth, level on points with fourth-placed Real Sociedad, who will play their game in hand at Alaves on Thursday. Getafe could also be overtaken if Atletico Madrid win on Wednesday against Osasuna. Espanyol move to within two points of safety after resuming with a 2-0 victory over Alaves on Saturday. Villarreal stayed in the hunt for the European places by beating Real Mallorca 1-0. Carlos Bacca's early finish leaves Villarreal seventh, three points from fourth. Mallorca remain 18th."
166,15/06/2020,16:03,Barca coach enjoying luxury of choice as empty Camp Nou awaits,Barcelona coach Quique Setien rejoiced Monday in having key players like Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez fit for the hectic La Liga title run-in ahead of hosting struggling Leganes at a Camp Nou devoid of fans.,"Suarez made his first appearance since knee surgery in January, replacing Antoine Griezmann in the second half as Barca shrugged off a three-month La Liga coronavirus lockdown with a 4-0 stroll in Mallorca on Saturday. And Messi's two assists, a goal, and 90 minutes played suggest Barca's captain has overcome the tightness in his thigh from earlier this month. Setien's side welcome Leganes on Tuesday while two points clear of Real Madrid, who face Valencia 48 hours later. Explaining the Griezmann substitution the coach said the French World Cup winner was an ""undeniable"" plus for his team. ""He's played in practically every match but now there are more players and you have to spread game time around more. ""As the matches come and go there will be changes. The idea is that all the players are fresh, that they can handle the run of games with the guarantee of not getting injured so that they can all give their best."" Turning to Messi he praised his ace act's performance: ""That's why he's the best player in the world and we are fortunate to have him."" While his players may be present, Setien was unsure of how his team would cope performing in front of an empty Camp Nou, with matches closed to fans to combat the spread of COVID-19. ""Let's hope that it won't have any effect on us and that we play well and win. ""Football loses some of its fuel when staged in front of empty stands."""
167,14/06/2020,14:59,La Liga takes legal action against pitch invader,"La Liga have said they will launch criminal proceedings against the pitch invader who ran on during Barcelona's match against Real Mallorca on Saturday, which was supposed to be behind closed doors.","In the 52nd minute of Barca's 4-0 win at Son Moix, a man wearing an Argentina shirt with Lionel Messi's name on the back entered the pitch and posed for a picture on his phone near Jordi Alba. He was not wearing either a mask or gloves and was chased before being caught and escorted away by security. La Liga has imposed strict a medical protocol for matches, which resumed in the top flight on Thursday with Sevilla's victory over Real Betis. Fewer than 300 people are allowed into stadiums and games are closed to the public. ""La Liga will file criminal actions against the invader who entered the pitch without permission and broke the protocols established in current health legislation and disobeyed the orders of private security personnel,"" a statement from the league said. ""His actions constitute a crime."" It added: ""La Liga wants to express its absolute condemnation of this type of conduct that jeopardises the health of others and the integrity of the competition."""
168,13/06/2020,21:21,Messi starts as Barcelona resume against Mallorca,Fears over Lionel Messi's fitness were eased when the Argentine star was named to start for Barcelona in their first match in three months against Real Mallorca on Saturday.,"Messi had caused concern by missing three training sessions this month with tightness in his thigh but rejoined his teammates on Monday and was named in the starting line-up by coach Quique Setien. It will be the first time the 32-year-old has played since he scored the winner against Real Sociedad on March 7. That victory sent Barcelona back to the top of the table, two points ahead of Real Madrid. Messi has scored 24 goals in 31 appearances for Barca this term. La Liga returned on Thursday as Sevilla beat Real Betis 2-0, bringing an end to 93 days without matches while the coronavirus suspension was in place. Teams will play their remaining 11 fixtures in less than six weeks, with the season scheduled to finish on July 19."
169,11/06/2020,17:28,De Jong relishes return of La Liga title race,"""What you have to understand is I really, really like football,"" says Barcelona midfielder Frenkie de Jong. ""It's not pretend. I enjoy every minute of it.""","De Jong's first touch at the Camp Nou came between a thumbs up and a smile. As he juggled the ball in his new kit, the crowd cheered and as they cheered, he smiled again. It was July 5 last year and De Jong was being unveiled after a 75 million-euro ($85m) move from Ajax. On his first day, the Dutchman arrived at his new flat to find a restaurant booked for him and his girlfriend by Sergio Busquets, the player many assumed De Jong was bought to replace. Later, he met Lionel Messi, whose name he had printed on the back of a Barca shirt he owned as a boy. ""Maybe it makes him feel old but he was already the best player when he was very young so I think it's more because of that,"" De Jong, who at 23 is almost 10 years younger than Messi, tells AFP. ""I dont have it anymore, it got too small for me."" It brings into focus the speed of his rise. Ajax sporting director Marc Overmars first spotted De Jong playing for the under-16s and what stood out was not only his ability to distribute, but dribble. ""When I was young I used to play a lot with my friends and it felt natural to beat players so I kept doing it at Willem II and then Ajax,"" De Jong says. ""We don't see it as much in the game now, I think because the spaces are so much smaller. Wingers used to get one against one but now there are always two people in front of them. ""The tactical aspect is more important and the physical ability is better, so opponents run harder to close the spaces. It makes it harder but it's a challenge I enjoy."" De Jong's first season in Spain has been assured, with 23 starts out of 27 in the league before it was suspended in March due to the coronavirus pandemic. But by his own admission, there is so much more to come as Barcelona prepare to return to action in Mallorca on Saturday. ""I have played some games that were good and others that were average or below average even,"" De Jong says. ""I had a bad period, I never played really badly I don't think, but I know I can do a lot better."" The interrupted season also has 11 games remaining. Barcelona are top, two points ahead of Real Madrid, but still adapting under new coach Quique Setien, who was appointed in January. ""The last round before we stopped we took back first place but we weren't in our best shape,"" De Jong says. ""The league was changing a lot, we weren't consistent but Madrid weren't either. ""I think we have already progressed since the new coach came in. You saw the team was already growing and I think we will be a better team than the one you saw before the suspension."" As always, much could hinge on Messi, whose fitness has become a concern after he missed three training sessions last week with tightness in his thigh. ""He's looked good to me,"" says De Jong. ""I'm not on the medical staff but there was nothing bad."" Luis Suarez has recovered from a knee injury, an unexpected bonus after his season was presumed to be over. ""I'm so happy he is back and I have to say in training he looks sharp, his movement has been great. To me, he looks more than ready to play,"" De Jong says. Suarez's return could even tip the balance. Is he under-appreciated? ""Under-appreciated, yes, I think so. If you look at his statistics, he is maybe the best number nine there is,"" De Jong says. ""Look at his goals, his assists, he definitely gets the credit from me. For me, there's no debate about him. He can contribute a lot to us and the team will be better with him in it."" Under the strict health guidelines brought in, games without fans could ease Barcelona's problems away from home while most assume an extra two substitutions will favour the bigger clubs as well. ""I think it will be an advantage for us,"" says De Jong. ""We have a strong bench so we will not be losing as much quality as other teams."" It will be a first for everyone and for De Jong, a first La Liga title race reaching its climax too, but he plans to enjoy it. ""Of course the pressure is high but I think I'll always be like this,"" he says. ""When I'm smiling on the field it's because I'm enjoying playing or seeing someone else doing something extraordinary. I still try to play with the same freedom that I've played with my whole life."""
170,10/06/2020,03:15,Lifelines for Hazard and Suarez as La Liga title race looks to forgotten stars,"When La Liga stopped they were not expected to play any part in the rest of the title race but when the season resumes on Thursday, Eden Hazard and Luis Suarez could be set to decide it.","Hazard was looking beyond Real Madrid to the Euros after undergoing surgery on his right foot in March while some felt Suarez had played his last game for Barcelona after having a knee operation in January. Instead, both have been thrown a lifeline, Suarez to preserve his career at Barca and Hazard to kickstart his with Madrid. After Real Madrid paid 100 million euros ($108.4 million) to sign him from Chelsea last year, fans sprinted outside the Santiago Bernabeu to beat the queues for Hazard's unveiling, and around 50,000 made it inside. However questions were soon being asked about his weight in pre-season, and he has struggled with injury all season. Every time he has come back, Hazard has needed time to find form, initially lacking that burst of speed and change of direction that at his best, can leave a defender for dead. But reports from Valdebebas have been positive, with Thibaut Courtois saying on Sunday he had been surprised by the Belgian's ""rhythm"" before adding a note of caution. ""We can't expect him to be on top form without playing,"" he said. Barca coach Quique Setien has been similarly circumspect over Suarez, who is also not renowned for quick returns to sharpness after time away. ""He is better than we expected,"" Setien said on Sunday. ""But the question is how ready he is after so long out and whether he is ready to start."" Despite winning the Clasico on March 1, Madrid were in a slump before the hiatus, that 2-0 victory over Barcelona their only win in five games. They lost the defensive steel that saw them go 21 matches unbeaten either side of Christmas and a familiar bluntless, still lingering from Cristiano Ronaldo's departure, remains. Hazard was supposed to help fill the creative void but 11 games over five and a half weeks offers no room for rustiness and, unlike Suarez, this is still a new team to him. Fifteen appearances in 10 months hardly breeds familiarity. Barca meanwhile need bodies as they have only 19 fit senior players, which leaves them surprisingly ill-equipped to capitalise on two extra substitutes. The club sold back-ups in January to raise funds for a striker that never arrived and instead they were left to exploit La Liga's emergency signing rule in February to poach Martin Braithwaite from Leganes. But Suarez brings experience and quality, not to mention the best out of Lionel Messi. In full flow, Messi could see off Real Madrid but the Argentinian has had his own injury problems this season, the latest a minor thigh complaint that led to him missing three training sessions last week. Barcelona have a two-point advantage and the marginally more favourable fixtures, particularly as the usually heated atmospheres at Sevilla and Alaves will be negated by empty stands. They play Atletico Madrid at home too but have not lost to them at Camp Nou in 14 years. Yet bubbling distrust of the Barca board could resurface at any moment and Madrid have the better head-to-head record, meaning they only need to be level on points to be crowned champions. They play away at high-flying Real Sociedad and Athletic Bilbao but more important could be how they take to their new training ground home, the Alfredo di Stefano Stadium, while renovation work continues at the Bernabeu. Madrid have Marco Asensio fit again while Gareth Bale has been the fittest of anyone in training. Zinedine Zidane's knack for winning knock-out tournaments might even be well-suited to a 39-day sprint finish. Zidane was close to the sack in September but almost a year later, only one thing is certain. Nothing is the same."
171,08/06/2020,14:18,Messi back in Barca training ahead of Mallorca restart,Lionel Messi trained again with his teammates on Monday to give Barcelona a massive boost ahead of their La Liga return against Mallorca on Saturday.,"Messi has been suffering from tightness in his right thigh and had not trained fully since last Tuesday. He sat out sessions on Wednesday and Friday before working alone at Camp Nou on Saturday. But Barcelona said in a statement their captain has re-joined ""the rest of the team in the week of the return to competition in the Spanish league"". Asked if Messi would be able to face Mallorca, Barca coach Quique Setien told Movistar on Sunday night: ""Messi is not the only one that has not trained and felt some discomfort. ""It's what has happened to everyone or practically everyone since they have been back. ""It is some minor tightness and we have it under control. He is doing perfectly and will not have any problem."" Setien also gave an update on the fitness of Luis Suarez, who has been given the green light by the club to return after undergoing surgery on his right knee in January. ""He is better than we expected,"" Setien said. ""But the question is how ready he is after so long out and whether he is ready to start."" Barcelona sit two points clear of Real Madrid at the top of La Liga, which will resume on Thursday with Sevilla against Real Betis after a three-month break due to the coronavirus pandemic. There are 11 rounds left to play, with fixtures expected to take place every day until the season ends on July 19."
172,08/06/2020,03:10,Unfamiliar homes offer Barca and Madrid fresh challenge in frenzied title race,"""I've missed this place,"" Lionel Messi said after stepping onto the Camp Nou grass for the first time in three months but when Barcelona return to action he knows it will not be the same.","Instead, La Liga's frenzied title race will take another step into the unknown as Barca run out into the biggest and now emptiest stadium in Europe after Real Madrid switch to a different home altogether. Two points separate Spain's greatest rivals ahead of the return to top-flight games on Thursday, when the derby between Sevilla and Real Betis will end a 93-day hiatus and launch a five-week sprint to the finish. When games were suspended on March 12, Madrid had handed first place back to Barcelona, just after beating them at the Santiago Bernabeu, a seemingly significant shift in momentum that lasted exactly a week. Given the many frailties of the two teams, few could predict who will emerge the stronger from the final 11 games of the season but a fresh factor will be who adapts better to strange surroundings. Instead of their 81,000-capacity stadium in the city-centre, under renovation this summer, Real Madrid will play at the 6,000-seater Alfredo di Stefano Stadium, usually the home of the club's reserve and under-18 teams, at their training ground in the northern suburbs. Barcelona, meanwhile, will trade the advantage of Europe's largest home crowd for the challenge of its most empty arena, where the absence of fans will, in numerical terms at least, feel starker than anywhere else. ""It's the first time we have to play games without the fans,"" said Madrid's Toni Kroos earlier this month. ""The team that adjusts best to this situation is the one that will win."" For Barca, it will not be the first time. Lionel Messi, Luis Suarez, Sergio Busquets, Gerard Pique, Sergi Roberto, Jordi Alba and Marc-Andre ter Stegen all played against Las Palmas in October 2017, when the club closed its doors at Camp Nou in protest against the game going ahead amid political unrest. They won 3-0 but while that was a one-off, this time there are five home games to navigate, including Atletico Madrid, who would be more easily overcome with the help of a crowd. Leganes and Espanyol, sitting 19th and 20th respectively, may feel emboldened too. ""I love that connection with the fans, it's what allows us to feel those moments of happiness, to live them,"" said Barca's Arturo Vidal. ""But we will have to adapt."" On Saturday, the team held their first full training session at Camp Nou in almost seven years and Real Madrid have been trying to acclimatise too, with Zinedine Zidane overseeing regular meetings at their new ground. The pitch replicates exactly the 105 x 60-metre measurements of the Bernabeu while the club's groundsman, Paul Burgess, has been moved over to work on the surface. But innovations are needed, with the club having to improve the lighting for broadcasting, add advertising boards and install the technology for VAR. For Zidane, the setting is familiar because he led Madrid's reserve side, Castilla, for 28 games there before taking charge of the first team. He even made his last appearance there in a Real Madrid shirt, to open the stadium in 2006. Dani Carvajal, Sergio Ramos, Casemiro, Fede Valverde, Vinicius Junior, Lucas Vazquez and Rodrygo all came through the ranks playing on the Alfredo di Stefano grass. Yet six home games against Eibar, Valencia, Mallorca, Getafe, Alaves and Villarreal offer no guarantees and, unlike Barcelona's opponents, those teams will not even feel an historic anxiety. For them, the Alfredo di Stefano Stadium might feel more like a neutral venue. ""Personally, I would prefer to play at the Bernabeu,"" said Ramos. If home advantage is less certain, Barcelona could suffer most. They have collected the most home points so far in the division and nine more than Real Madrid. But if they find away points are easier to collect, Barcelona have more room for improvement than Real. The unknowns make an erratic title race even more unpredictable."

La Liga leaders Barcelona play their first match since mid-March at Real Mallorca next Saturday. Suarez will be fit to play for the first time since undergoing knee surgery in January after reporting feeling no pain following training.

Barcelona said Messi should return to training ""in a few days' time"", but his absence raises doubts over his fitness ahead of the trip to Mallorca. Like all La Liga teams, Barca will have had only 10 days to train together when competitive matches resume on June 11, following the three-month break due to the coronavirus pandemic. ""Leo Messi has a minor right quadriceps injury and trained in isolation, doing specific exercises to avoid unnecessary risks with just eight days remaining before Barca finally get back to playing matches,"" a club statement read. ""He should be able to rejoin his team-mates in a few days' time."" Messi has endured an injury-interrupted season. The 32-year-old was out for six weeks between August and September with a calf injury and then at the end of September missed another week with a problem in his left thigh. But after regaining fitness, Messi quickly found form, scoring 24 goals in 31 appearances so far this term to help Barcelona sit two points clear at the top of La Liga. Barca added the team will train on the pitch at Camp Nou on Saturday as coach Quique Setien ""works to get his players ready for the return to football, but with games being played behind closed doors""."

""I feel very good, adapting to training with my team-mates. Returning after an injury is always difficult, because you are a little scared but I'm enjoying being back,"" Suarez told the club's website. La Liga is set to restart with the Seville derby on June 11 and to be completed on July 19, yet the expectation is players will be subjected to safety protocol for several months and stadiums will not be full again until next year. ""We are not used to playing in so much heat in the middle of summer. We are adapting to playing without a crowd which will be peculiar,"" he said. ""We will continue to focus on winning games to win the league title, which is what we all want."" ""As time goes on, everything is getting back to normal, despite the death of so many people,"" he added. Defending champions Barca hold a two-point lead over Real Madrid at the top with 11 rounds of matches still to be played."

The law could favour the bigger clubs like Barcelona, who have deeper squads and better players ready to come off the bench. But Setien believes Barca, who are two points clear at the top of La Liga, will also find opponents are now fresher towards the end of games. ""I think it will actually harm us,"" Setien said on Friday night in a video conference with the Las Palmas Football Federation. ""We know we settle a lot of matches in the final minutes.

An agreement may even harder to strike this summer given the financial implications of the coronavirus pandemic, although reportedly Barcelona could offer players in exchange. ""I would love to be able to coach him some day,"" said Setien, speaking to beIN Sport late on Friday. ""We are talking about an exceptional level. Fortunately I have already fulfilled one of my dreams, which was to coach (Lionel) Messi but I would be delighted if Neymar comes."" Neymar previously formed a successful attacking trio with Luis Suarez and Messi at Barcelona but Suarez's future is uncertain.

Asked if Suarez was fully fit, Setien said: ""No, I think he's in a good condition and has been working with the group. But we see that he lacks a bit of confidence.

La Liga chief Javier Tebas is hopeful matches will return from June 12 but admitted the exact timing will depend on the health authorities in Spain and the trajectory of the virus."
182,13/05/2020,19:44,Injured Dembele returns to Barca training ground,"Barcelona forward Ousmane Dembele will be able to continue his recovery from a hamstring injury at the club's training ground after passing a test for coronavirus, the Spanish champions announced on Wednesday.","Dembele underwent surgery on his troublesome right hamstring in February, when Barca said the Frenchman would be out for around six months. He had initially sustained the tear in November but suffered a relapse on February 3 after returning to training. ""Ousmane Dembele returned to the Ciutat Esportiva this Wednesday after passing the mandatory test to continue with his recovery from the rupture suffered in his right hamstring,"" a club statement read. The statement was accompanied by a picture of the 23-year-old wearing a protective mask and gloves, while giving a thumbs up as he arrived. Dembele joined Barcelona in a deal worth up to 147 million euros ($160.5 million) from Borussia Dortmund in 2017 but his time in Spain has been ravaged by injury. He has managed only 35 La Liga starts for Barca in his three seasons at the club. Barcelona returned to training last Friday. Players are carrying out work individually ahead of La Liga's potential return on June 12."
183,09/05/2020,15:57,Umtiti suffers calf knock in second Barca training session,"France defender Samuel Umtiti has picked up a calf injury in just the second session since Barcelona returned to training from the cornonavirus quarantine, the Spanish champions announced on Saturday.","Barca said that Umiti picked up an injury to his right calf during Saturday's training session at the club's Joan Gamper facility, but did not specify how long the 26-year-old would be out for. Spanish media report that he will be unavailable for two or three weeks, so will likely be back in time for a potential June 20 restart for football in Spain as the country attempts to loosen coronavirus restrictions. The 26-year-old Umtiti joined Barca from Lyon in 2016 after he helped France to the final of Euro 2016. He had further success with France in their successful 2018 World Cup campaign. He played 16 times for the Catalan giants this season before play was suspended in March, and was twice injured earlier in the campaign, causing him to miss 10 matches between September and November last year. Barca returned to training at the club's facility on Friday after almost two months on lockdown in defence against a virus that has killed over 26,0000 in Spain. Footballers in Spain restarted training following the announcement last week of a government plan that aims to end quarantine for professional players. Individual training sessions are the first step to what La Liga hopes will be a return to action in June that will complete the 2019-20 season behind closed doors."
184,08/05/2020,19:57,Barca return to training as La Liga eyes restart,Barcelona returned to training on Friday after the La Liga champions allowed their stars to enter their facility to prepare for a potential restart to football in Spain.,"Lionel Messi and company took the fields at Joan Gamper training centre for individual sessions, for which the players arrived alone in kit and took to the three pitches without passing through the changing rooms. As well as doing their routines, they were also subjected to tests to see what effect two months of coronavirus quarantine has had on their bodies. ""Finally we are getting back to normal. We hope to carry on and that soon we can get back to enjoying what we like to do most,"" Arturo Vidal told sports daily Marca. Sevilla, Villarreal, Osasuna and Leganes also returned to training, while Real Madrid -- who were two points behind league leaders Barca when play stopped in mid-March -- will likely start again on Monday should their players pass virus tests carried out on Wednesday. That would mark almost two months since Real had been placed in quarantine following a positive test for a member of the club's basketball team. According to Spanish media, none of Real's players have suffered from virus symptoms, but Zinedine Zidane will have to do without Serb attacker Luka Jovic after Real announced on Friday he had fracture his right heel. Footballers in Spain have restarted training following the announcement last week of government plan that aims to end quarantine for professional players. Individual training sessions are the first step to what La Liga hopes will be a return to action in June that will complete the 2019-20 season behind closed doors. The first aspect of a four-phase de-escalation programme allows a maximum of six players on the pitch at any one time. La Liga's programme will then permit training in small groups before a return to larger team sessions. In the fourth and final phase, in early June, the government has said outside events can go ahead when attended by fewer than 400 people. League president Javier Tebas has said ""it is not an option"" to cancel the season given the economic fallout, estimating it would cost clubs around a billion euros ($1.08 billion). On Thursday, Leganes coach Javier Aguirre said La Liga will resume on June 20 and end on July 26, although league bosses refused to confirm his claim they had told him the dates. ""La Liga has just informed me officially and I am very happy about that because we have now scheduled the training sessions,"" Aguirre told Marca Claro."

Players at Madrid, including Eden Hazard and Karim Benzema, also underwent health checks at Real's training base on the outskirts of the city. Results from the coronavirus tests are typically known within 48 hours. The testing is part of the league's strict medical protocol with which teams must comply before a return to training. Atletico Madrid, who will also carry out tests Wednesday, are aiming to resume training immediately once the results are known if all goes to plan. ""It's been a very strange time for us. We've never gone as long without touching a ball and we are eager for it all to restart,"" said Atletico midfielder Marcos Llorente. ""Each week they sent us training programmes adjusted a bit to each player and I think we are ready to return."" The first of a four-phase de-escalation programme announced by the Spanish government last week would allow players to initially train alone, with a maximum of six players allowed on the pitch. Players will be expected to arrive on club premises already in their kit and wear a mask and gloves when not training. After each session they will be given a bag with clothes for the next day. La Liga's programme will then permit training in small groups before a return to larger team sessions. In the fourth and final phase, scheduled for early June, the government have said outside events can go ahead when attended by fewer than 400 people. La Liga is proposing to complete its season behind closed doors, with games starting again in the middle of June. ""People's health is paramount, so we have a comprehensive protocol to safeguard the health of everyone involved as we work to restart La Liga,"" league president Javier Tebas said on Monday. ""Circumstances are unprecedented, but we hope to start playing again in June and finish our 19/20 season this summer.""

Once approved, clubs can initiate the league's programme for players to train alone, then in small groups, before finally in larger team sessions. Barcelona confirmed they had passed their inspection on Tuesday morning.

187,30/04/2020,03:00,Braithwaite: People see me as the emergency signing but I deserve to be at Barca,"Martin Braithwaite was Barcelona's emergency signing in February, a quick-fix to replace the injured Ousmane Dembele, but for him the move goes back 10 years to a broken leg and a notebook.","In his first meeting with the club's president Josep Maria Bartomeu and technical secretary Eric Abidal, Braithwaite was told one of the main reasons Barca were buying him was his mentality. ""I felt like they really knew me,"" Braithwaite says in an interview with AFP. ""They knew how strong I am mentally and they said that was one of the things that made them go for me. They thought I was up for the test."" The toughness they saw owes much to when Braithwaite was 18 and playing for Esbjerg FB in Denmark. A broken leg prompted him to transform his attitude and start writing objectives down in a notebook. ""I was already a professional footballer but I wasn't respecting the job and I wasn't respecting the boy that had a dream to be here,"" Braithwaite says. ""I took it for granted."" A year later, Braithwaite was in a hotel after joining Toulouse when he took out his notebook again. ""I came to a page of some objectives, maybe three or four years earlier, and I saw I had written Toulouse,"" Braithwaite says. ""When I saw that, I thought, 'Wow, the power of the mind is really strong'. ""And when I was 27 or 28, I wrote I would play for one of the biggest clubs in the world. Now I'm here, where I said I would be 10 years ago."" Braithwaite draws upon his childhood too, when a hip condition called Legg-Calve-Perthes left him in a wheelchair between the age of five and seven. ""I remember I felt sad. I felt embarrassed,"" he says. ""I was just a kid who wanted to play. I remember the look people would give me, like I was different. ""Of course, I came through that and look where I am today but at the same time it makes me humble and grateful for the things I have."" For some, Barcelona buying Braithwaite was a result of opportunism, through the use of an obscure La Liga rule, and caused by bad planning, after a chaotic transfer window left the squad short. But Braithwaite sees it as hard work paying off. Even during lockdown, he adds extra training to the club programme and watches videos of his teammates, learning where they move, run and pass, to speed up his adaptation. ""People see me as the emergency signing because that was how I got here,"" he says. ""What people don't know is that for so many years I've put in my mind that I want to be here. It's not a coincidence. ""I'm at Barca, I signed for four years and I see my future here."" But his departure from Leganes left a bitter taste, even if few blamed Braithwaite for completing a dream move, not even Leganes, who were ""fantastic, they understood"". The rule that allowed Barcelona to sign a player outside the transfer window due to injuries meant Leganes, in the relegation zone, were unable to replace their top scorer, who joined the league leaders. ""Yeah, maybe the rule should be changed,"" Braithwaite said. ""I understand because Leganes lost one of their main players, they can't get a replacement and they are in a difficult situation. I completely understand that."" Braithwaite played three games for his new team before the coronavirus caused La Liga to be suspended and he impressed, his willingness to run in behind and strike combinations with Lionel Messi quickly earning the praise of Barcelona fans. ""It's not difficult when you play with Messi. You just have to run and the ball is at your feet,"" he says. But off the pitch, Barca have been consumed by political controversies, which have continued even as the games have stopped. Last month, the players' distrust of the board resurfaced around negotiations over wage cuts. ""Honestly inside the club there is a really good atmosphere,"" Braithwaite says. ""We're not focusing on what is happening on the outside, we just want to play."" The season restarting is complex too, with La Liga's current plan to reintroduce training gradually before resuming games in June behind closed doors, which could last until next year. ""It's out of my control,"" says Braithwaite. ""If the people in charge feel there is no risk in going back, I trust them. This is bigger than football right now, it's about people's health. We have to move cautiously."" Braithwaite's dedication means he has a better chance than most of hitting the ground running. But even he admits playing for Barcelona has occasionally caused his ice-cool demeanour to slip. ""When I'm playing and training, I'm doing what I always do,"" he says. ""But sometimes at the start I would catch myself in the mirror at the training ground. I would see the badge on my shirt and I would think, 'Damn, I'm really here'."""
188,24/04/2020,12:43,'Everything clouds over and goes dark' - Iniesta on depression at Barcelona,"Andres Iniesta has described his struggle with depression while playing for Barcelona, which his mother says was a ""bottomless pit"" that caused her 25-year-old son to ask to sleep with his parents.","Iniesta recalls his experience with the illness in a Rakuten TV documentary, 'Andres Iniesta - The Unexpected Hero', which was released on Thursday and covers his move to Japanese side Vissel Kobe in 2018. After winning the Champions League under Pep Guardiola in 2009, Iniesta was battling injury and then hit by the death of his friend Dani Jarque, the 26-year-old Espanyol defender who suffered a heart attack. ""The days pass and you realise you're not improving, you don't feel good, you're not yourself. Everything clouds over and goes dark,"" Iniesta said. On Jarque's death, Iniesta added: ""That was like a body blow, something powerful that knocked me down again and I was pretty low, clearly because I wasn't very well."" Iniesta's depression is described by those closest to him, including his mother Maria Lujan and father Jose Antonio. ""I noticed he wasn't well one night when we were sleeping downstairs and he came down and said, 'mum can I sleep here with you?'"" Maria said. ""Then the world came down on my head."" Jose Antonio said: ""Our 25 year-old son coming down at midnight and wanting to sleep with his parents means he can't be well. He said, 'I'm not well dad'. I said, 'what's wrong?' 'I don't know, I don't feel well.'"" Iniesta's father admitted he thought his son might have to take a break from football. ""At one stage I thought he would have to stop because the most important thing was him,"" said Jose Antonio. Iniesta began having sessions with psychologist Inma Puig, who said the Spaniard's recovery owed much to those around him, including Guardiola. ""Guardiola said this is the first time I've been in this situation as a coach,"" said Puig. ""I remember he said, 'the most important thing now is Andres, the person not the player'."" ""They're people and this is a very human thing which affects millions of people around the world,"" said Guardiola. ""They have to know we are there for them."" ""Guardiola tried to get him out of that bottomless pit he was in,"" said Iniesta's mother Maria. Iniesta came through Barcelona's La Masia academy and went on to win nine La Liga titles and four Champions Leagues with the club. He also lifted the World Cup with Spain in 2010, after scoring the winning goal against the Netherlands in the final. Despite receiving a hero's farewell from Barca, Iniesta hinted his relationship with the board influenced his decision to go to Japan. ""People at the club never imagined I could leave,"" Iniesta said. ""It's like everything, in relationships if you don't discuss things at the right time there comes a time when there's no way back."""
189,23/04/2020,03:50,"Mourinho's ambush of Guardiola and Barca, under a volcanic cloud","Ten years ago this week, Barcelona limped home from a Champions League semi-final first-leg defeat blaming a volcano thousands of kilometres away and stoking the smouldering fires of Jose Mourinho's feud with their club and their coach.","The eruption of Eyjafjallajoekull on Iceland had sent a plume of ash drifting across Europe, grounding flights and playing havoc with the sports calendar. A MotoGP race scheduled for Japan on April 25 was postponed until October because teams and riders could not get there. As bad luck would have it, Newcastle United faced the longest away trip in English football on April 19. They made the 650-kilometre (404-mile) journey to Plymouth Argyle for a Monday night game by coach and won, 2-0, to secure promotion and relegate the hosts. In Europe, Lyon travelled 730 kilometres to face Bayern Munich in the Champions League on April 21. For the Europa League semis on April 22, Fulham went 950 kilometres by bus to Hamburg. In order to face Atletico Madrid in Spain, Liverpool covered 2,000 kilometres by train to Bordeaux, changing in London and Paris, and then went the last 700 kilometres by plane. Lyon and Liverpool both lost 1-0, a disadvantage neither could overturn in the second legs. Fulham drew 0-0 on their way to their first European final. But the most volcanic encounter began at San Siro on April 20. Barcelona made their 1,000-kilometre trek to Milan over two days, spending a night en route in Cannes. Coach Pep Guardiola used the 14 hours on the coach to show his squad match videos but they also watched Invictus and Inglourious Basterds. Meanwhile, in Milan, Mourinho schemed. This tie might have marked the start of his spiky battle with Guardiola, but it was not the start of Mourinho's grudge with Barcelona. Mourinho had joined Barca in 1996, when his mentor, Bobby Robson, became coach. Mourinho translated, but also organised training and played an increasing role in coaching, taking over the B team under Robson's successor, Louis van Gaal. Guardiola was team captain for most of Mourinho's time at the club. Mourinho made an explosive return with Chelsea in the Champions League in 2005. Barcelona won the first leg 2-1 but that game was marred by Mourinho accusing Barca coach Frank Rijkaard of visiting referee Anders Frisk at half-time. Frisk ended up quitting after death threats from Chelsea fans. Chelsea won the second leg 4-2 to advance. Mourinho had got the better of his former club. In 2008, Guardiola and Mourinho were the candidates to replace Rijkaard before the Catalan native got the job. They first met as coaches in the 2009/10 group stage. At the Camp Nou, Barcelona, who had won the trophy in Guardiola's first season, beat Inter 2-0. In April, the stakes were higher. Barcelona were unhappy with their bus trip and unhappy that the hosts refused to water a scuffed pitch. Inter played like the away team, sitting back even after Pedro gave Barcelona a 16th-minute lead. Wesley Sneijder levelled by half-time. Maicon and Diego Milito struck in the first 15 minutes of the second half to give Inter a 3-1 win. Yet the job was only half over. As Barcelona talked of rising from the ashes and reaching the final in Madrid, Mourinho began rubbing salt into Barcelona's sores. ""We want to follow a dream,"" Mourinho said. ""But it's one thing to follow a dream and another to follow an obsession. For Barcelona it's an obsession. ""To have a Catalan flag in the Bernabeu is an obsession."" For the return leg, Inter flew to Barcelona but when they got to the Camp Nou, they parked the bus. Four men marked Lionel Messi and the entire team defended deep even before Thiago Motta was sent off in the 28th minute. Barcelona only broke through once, when Gerard Pique scored four minutes from time. At the end, as Mourinho ran to the Inter fans to celebrate his ""most beautiful defeat"", the Barcelona ground staff turned the sprinklers on. Inter went on to beat Bayern 2-0 in the final at the Bernabeu. Mourinho later boasted of his ""strong, cynical, intelligent, pragmatic team"" and in 2010, when the dust had cleared, his pragmatism had won. He was back in Madrid the following season, determined to bring down Barcelona again as coach of Real. But, as their rivalry grew poisonous, Guardiola got his revenge in the 2011 semi-finals and Barcelona bounced back to win a treble."

When they sold 24-year-old Lenglet to Sevilla for 5 million euros in January 2017, Nancy negotiated a sell-on clause for 12 per cent of any transfer profit. The second tier outfit's statement explained that when the France defender moved to Barca in July 2018 for a fee of ""more than 35 million euros"", Sevilla argued that because Lenglet had activated a release clause he had not been sold but released. But CAS, like FIFA, ""considered that Sevilla FC could not use this release clause as an excuse to avoid its obligation to pay."" Nancy, who have a budget of around 15 million euros this season and were 12th in Ligue 2 when the season was interrupted by the coronavirus pandemic, said Sevilla had 45 days to pay."

You will forever live in our hearts. Rest in peace,"" the club tweeted. Spanish sports daily Marca said Antic had been suffering from a serious illness for a long time. Antic, who first moved to Spain as a player with Real Zaragoza in 1978, managed Atletico across three different spells between 1995 and 2000 and led the club to a league and cup double in his first season. He also coached Barcelona during the second part of the 2002-03 campaign after replacing the sacked Louis van Gaal. His first stint at one of Spain's big clubs came during a 10-month spell with Real in 1991-92. On the international stage, he led his native Serbia to the 2010 World Cup, where his team beat Germany 1-0 in the group stage but failed to advance to the knockout rounds. The Serbian football federation paid tribute to Antic as it confirmed the news of his death on its website. ""All those who knew Radomir will from now on have an emptiness in their heart and Serbia can be proud to have had such a man who was abroad and represented a source of pride,"" the federation said. After leaving Partizan Belgrade in 1976 to sign for Fenerbahce, Antic moved to Zaragoza for two years before finishing his career in England with Luton Town. He helped the club achieve promotion to the English top flight in 1982, and scored the goal that helped them stay up on the final day of the following season. ""We are devastated to learn of the passing of Town legend Radomir Antic, at the age of 71. A true Hatters hero, for promotion and preventing relegation. The thoughts of all at Kenilworth Road are with his family and friends at this terribly sad time. Rest in peace, Raddy,"" the club tweeted."
196,03/04/2020,00:13,Suarez 'hurt' by criticism of Barca players' pay cut delay,"Uruguay star Luis Suarez complained on Thursday that he has been ""hurt"" by criticism of him and fellow millionaire Barcelona players for the time it took to agree to pay cuts to help out other club employees.","Argentine superstar Lionel Messi announced on Monday that Barca's players had agreed to a 70 percent pay cut and to make contributions to ensure the club's non-playing staff could be paid in full during the state of alarm in Spain caused by the coronavirus pandemic. Footballers across Europe's top leagues have come under fire as some clubs have made cuts to their non-playing staff or their salaries while many wealthy players have yet to see their incomings affected. ""It hurts because we were the first to want to reach an agreement,"" Suarez told Uruguayan radio station Sport890. ""We know the situation the club is in, the situation the world is in right now and it was a minimal detail (holding up the agreement). ""But people have said things like us players didn't want to give in; that the basketball and handball players came to an agreement and we didn't. ""We hadn't come to an agreement because we were waiting to find the best solution for the club, and to our benefit and trying to help the employees."" In announcing the agreement, Messi had directed a thinly veiled swipe at the Barca board, led by president Josep Maria Bartomeu, whom he accused of undermining the players during recent negotiations. His lengthy Instagram post was shared by a slew of teammates, including Suarez. Striker Suarez, who has remained in Spain unlike some of his European-based international teammates such as Edinson Cavani and Diego Godin, called on Uruguay to impose a strict lockdown. ""It's the best solution for everyone. I know it's difficult in Uruguay where many people live day to day ... but if we don't all come together and go in the same direction, it's going to be difficult to come out of this situation,"" he said. Uruguay has partially closed its borders, shut schools and shopping malls and advised people to social distance and stay at home, but hasn't imposed a lockdown. So far, the country has had 350 coronavirus cases and four deaths."

Atletico Madrid have said the club will impose salary reductions on staff whose hours have been affected while Espanyol have also confirmed pay cuts, although for sporting staff only. ""For our part, the time has come to announce that, as well as the reduction of 70 per cent of our salary during the State of Alarm, we will also make contributions so the club's employees can collect 100 per cent of their salary while this situation lasts,"" Messi wrote. He added: ""We want to clarify that our desire has always been to apply a drop in salary because we fully understand that this is an exceptional situation and we are the first ones who have ALWAYS helped the club when asked. ""Many times we have even done it on our own initiative when we thought it necessary or important. ""Therefore, it never ceases to amaze us that from within the club there were those who tried to put us under the magnifying glass and tried to add pressure to do something that we always knew we would do.""

It added: ""In the case of the football first team the reduction will be more than 70 per cent as agreed with the club.

199,29/03/2020,16:45,Xavi wants 'total harmony' to return to Barcelona as coach,Xavi Hernandez has reiterated his desire to coach Barcelona in the future but suggests he will not return until a different board brings a new sense of direction to the club.,"Hernandez is in charge of Al-Sadd in Qatar and turned down an approach in January after Barca sacked Ernesto Valverde, which led to the surprise appointment of Quique Setien. In an interview with Spanish newspaper La Vanguardia published on Sunday, Xavi said Neymar would be a ""spectacular signing"", and singled out former Spain defender Carles Puyol and the one-time Dutch winger Jordi Cruyff as people he would like to work with. Yet the relationship between Barcelona's board, led by president Josep Maria Bartomeu, and the players has remained tense, with Lionel Messi's public criticism of technical secretary Eric Abidal among a number of off-field controversies. ""I am clear that I want to return to Barca, I am very excited,"" said Xavi, who was asked if a change of board would be needed for it to happen. ""Obviously I would like to be in tune with everyone,"" he said. ""In the dressing room there can't be a negative or toxic atmosphere."" ""Everything has to fit,"" Xavi added. ""I would like to come in with people from my environment that could form a good team."" Pushed on whether working with the current board would be a deal-breaker, Xavi said: ""It wouldn't be definitive but I insist I would like to have total harmony. I don't know if that can happen... I have nothing against anyone and I don't have a bad relationship with Bartomeu. Xavi mentioned the likes of Puyol, whom he played with under Pep Guardiola, and Cruyff, son of Johan and former Barca and Manchester United winger, as the kind of people he would like to work alongside. ""I would like to work with people in whom I have confidence, with whom there is loyalty,"" said Xavi. ""We are talking about Carles Puyol, who was captain of Barca, and Jordi Cruyff, a very good businessman with a lot of experience as a technical secretary."" He also said Neymar, whom the Catalans tried and failed to sign from Paris Saint-Germain last summer, would be a ""spectacular signing"". ""Most of the squad seems extraordinary,"" Xavi said. ""The base is very good. I would sign forwards, like Neymar. I don't know if he would fit in a social sense but in football terms I have no doubt he would be a spectacular signing."""
200,26/03/2020,23:55,Barcelona to cut salaries in virus fight,Barcelona said Thursday they were slashing salaries to counter the financial fall-out from the coronavirus although the Spanish giants did not specify if all of its employees would be affected by the move.,"All football has been suspended in Spain where the virus has so far killed more than 4,000 people with 56,000 confirmed cases. ""The suspension of competitions, following the epidemic of Covid-19, entails the cessation of all activities, sporting and non-sporting, of our club,"" said a statement released by Barcelona. The club, it added, had taken a ""series of measures to mitigate its effects and reduce the economic consequences of this crisis."" ""Essentially, it is a reduction in the working day, forced by the circumstances, and consequently a proportional reduction in the remuneration provided for in the respective contracts."" The Catalan club did not specify, however, the scale of the cuts or if all of its employees are affected."
201,29/01/2020,18:27,Setien keen for Barcelona to sign striker,"Barcelona coach Quique Setien said on Wednesday it would be ""interesting"" if the club signed a striker this month to replace the injured Luis Suarez.","Suarez is expected to miss the rest of the season after undergoing surgery on his right knee, with Barca keen to buy a replacement to play in the centre of their attacking trio. Negotiations with Valencia over a deal for Rodrigo Moreno have reportedly stalled while Arsenal's Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Lautaro Martinez of Inter Milan would be difficult to lure mid-season. ""First of all I'm happy with what I have,"" said Setien in a press conference. ""It would be interesting for us if a player could come but I always focus on what I have. If anyone comes they will be welcome but if not, I will work with the squad that I have."" Barcelona play Leganes at home in the last 16 of the Copa del Rey on Thursday, when the pressure will be higher than usual following Saturday's surprise 2-0 defeat away at Valencia in La Liga. The loss was Setien's first in only his second league game in charge and has raised early doubts about his appointment after the sacking of Ernesto Valverde. Asked if he had spoken to club president Josep Maria Bartomeu, Setien said: ""He has always given me confidence. He told me to give myself time, there are still some staff whose names I don't know. He told me to take my time, be calm and work as I have always done."" Barcelona's defeat at Mestalla allowed Real Madrid to pull three points clear at the top of the table and the manner of their performance was particularly worrying. Setien's style ensures Barca dominate the ball but they failed to create chances while defensive frailities remain unsolved. ""More time and less pressure would be a lot better, that's true,"" Setien said. ""But we understand the requirement to compete and achieve results. At the same time we need these concepts to see results. ""Here these players do a lot of the things already that we were going to tell them to. Other players are new or don't have the experience of the DNA of this club. ""We know their needs and the expectations that there always are at clubs like this. We will do it as quickly as possible and we are providing a lot of information to the players so they can catch up. ""There is a lot of work still to be done and fortunately the intelligence of these players is a great help."" Barca are hoping to win the Copa del Rey for a fifth time in six years. Leganes are 19th in La Liga."
202,25/01/2020,19:01,Barca beaten by Valencia in early blow for Setien,Quique Setien's honeymoon period lasted less than a fortnight as he tasted his first Barcelona defeat on Saturday in his second La Liga game in charge after a 2-0 loss to Valencia.,"A Jordi Alba own goal and Maxi Gomez's strike at Mestalla raised early doubts about Setien's appointment and gave Real Madrid the chance to move three points clear at the top of the table when they visit Real Valladolid on Sunday. Sevilla jumped into third, above Atletico Madrid and five points behind the top two, after they beat Granada 2-0. Barcelona had most of the ball but Valencia had the best chances as Gomez missed a penalty and also hit the crossbar in the first half. Gabriel Paulista saw a third goal ruled out late on. While performances under previous coach Ernesto Valverde were stodgy and familiar failings went unresolved, he left a side in first place. Setien promised a new style but few will cheer a team that loses. Despite dominating possession, Barcelona did little with it and as Valencia grew in confidence, they ceded control too. ""There are things they have not understood or maybe we have not have explained ourselves well,"" Setien said afterwards. ""In the first half, quite frankly, we were bad."" The question is whether Setien is trying to impose too much too soon and perhaps whether this group are even well-suited his ideas. ""The players have to adapt to the coaching staff to understand,"" said Sergio Busquets. ""There were some good things but we have to improve."" Valencia climb to fifth and continue to improve under Albert Celades. This success came without their captain Dani Parejo and, largely, without star striker Rodrigo Moreno, who has been linked with a January move to Barcelona. The hosts hardly touched the ball for the first six minutes, their fans whistling as they urged a more aggressive approach. But the plan was to sit and absorb and it worked, with Barcelona unable to cut through or create a single clear chance. And when Valencia did intervene, they were more dangerous too. With their first attack they won a penalty as Jose Gaya slipped past Gerard Pique and would surely have scored from eight yards before being brought down. Pique was booked and, with Parejo absent, Gomez stepped up, only for his driven shot to be well saved by Marc-Andre ter Stegen, albeit with the help of half a yard's headstart off his line. Barca were riding their luck. Sergi Roberto's header cannoned off Pique but fell just close enough for Ter Stegen, who parried a Gomez shot onto the crossbar and almost spilled another to Kevin Gameiro. Referee Gil Manzano puts his hands together as if to apologise after failing to play advantage when Ferran Torres was clear but the frustration of Valencia's fans turned to ecstasy shortly after half-time. Pique's flicked header landed at the feet of Gomez, whose driven effort took a cruel deflection off Alba and flew in. Setien traded the patience of Arthur Melo for the physicality of Arturo Vidal and Rodrigo came on to a rousing reception. Barcelona exerted some pressure and Lionel Messi led the way, hauled to the ground by Francis Coquelin and then denied by a brilliant Gabriel tackle. He fired past the post, headed wide and saw a curling free-kick saved. Yet just as a Barcelona equaliser began to feel inevitable, Valencia struck again. A quick throw caught Alba out of position and Torres did well to cut inside and switch to Gomez. He took a touch and curled into the corner. Gabriel thought he had a third after volleying in from a corner but VAR persuaded Manzano there had been a push. When Messi ballooned a late free-kick and threw his arms up in despair, Valencia knew their win was secure. Sevilla celebrated the club's 130th anniversary by brushing aside Granada as Luuk de Jong met Jesus Navas' cross to put them in front while Nolito's subtle finish made it two before half-time. ""It was a complete performance,"" said Sevilla coach Julen Lopetegui."
203,23/01/2020,17:56,Aston Villa sign Barcelona youngster Barry,Aston Villa announced the signing of promising teenage striker Louie Barry from Barcelona for a fee of about one million euros ($1.1 million) on Thursday.,"Birmingham-born Barry joined the Spanish champions from West Bromwich Albion in July 2019. The highly rated 16-year-old was reported to be unsettled by changes to Barcelona's coaching set-up and jumped at the chance to join Villa, the club he supported as a child. When Barry signed for Barcelona, the club described him as ""one of the best young players in English football"" but he made just 10 appearances for their youth teams, scoring two goals. The England youth international will link up with West Brom's former academy manager Mark Harrison, who took up a similar position at Villa in September. ""It sends a powerful message about the ambition of this football club. We're delighted. Louie is a local person and his family are all Villa fans, as is Louie,"" Harrison told Villa's website. ""He is still a very young man but as he's developed, he's always been one player that you recognise as having outstanding attributes."""
204,08/01/2020,19:44,"Spanish Super Cup in Saudi Arabia due to money, says Valverde",Barcelona coach Ernesto Valverde said Wednesday the Spanish Super Cup is being held in Saudi Arabia because of the money on offer and admits he preferred the previous format.,"Barca face Atletico Madrid in the second semi-final on Thursday after Real Madrid take on Valencia on Wednesday. The winner will play for the trophy at the King Abdullah Sport City Stadium in Jeddah on Sunday. This is the first year the Spanish Super Cup has been held in Saudi Arabia, after a controversial three-year contract worth 120 million euros was struck with the Spanish Football Federation (RFEF), who run the competition. The clubs will also benefit financially. For participating alone, Real Madrid and Barcelona will earn around 6 million euros while Atletico and Valencia will make around 3 million euros. But the RFEF have faced accusations of betraying local Spanish fans while critics also question the association with a country long-condemned for its treatment of women and record on human rights. ""I know there has been a lot said about this competition but the bottom line is football has become a business and as a business it looks for income,"" said Valverde at a press conference in Jeddah. ""That's the reason we are all here."" Previously, the Spanish Super Cup has been held in Spain in August, before the start of the league season and involving only the winners of La Liga and champions of the Copa del Rey. But the RFEF has not only changed the location but expanded the format, with the next two highest placed teams in La Liga also now taking part. ""It's a completely different format to what we're used to,"" said Valverde. ""It was always the first title and the opener of the season and to me that seemed fine. ""It's been changed and let's see, it will be judged once it has happened. It's interesting, with four good teams, but from a sporting point of view, I'm not sure."" Valverde's press conference was delayed by over an hour after the team's bus got lost on the way. ""We certainly know the city a bit better now,"" he said with a smile. ""There was a small mistake because the driver thought the press conference was at the stadium where Real Madrid and Valencia are playing tonight. He realised before we got there but then there was a bit of traffic so we were late."""
205,07/01/2020,15:30,Turan returning to Barcelona from Basaksehir,Turkish international Arda Turan ended his loan spell with Basaksehir Istanbul on Tuesday and will return to Barcelona after two years marked by violence on and off the pitch.,"""During a meeting yesterday, our player Arda Turan asked approval from our president Goksel Gumusdag to leave to write a new chapter in his career,"" the club said in a statement, adding that Gumusdag approved the request. Turan, 32, joined Basaksehir in January 2018 on loan from Barcelona where he had struggled to impose himself since leaving from Atletico Madrid in 2016. He made only 39 appearances for the Super Lig club, who failed to lift any trophies during his stint with the team. One of Turkey's best-known sportsmen and a strong supporter of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the midfielder lately made more headlines for his violent antics. Turan was given a 16-match suspension after shoving and verbally abusing a referee in May 2018. In September, he received a suspended sentence of almost three years over a brawl involving a famous singer at an Istanbul nightclub."
206,05/01/2020,00:25,China's Wu Lei strikes late as Espanyol hold 10-man Barcelona,Barcelona were pegged back by La Liga's bottom club Espanyol on Saturday as Wu Lei struck late to secure a dramatic 2-2 draw in a thrilling Catalan derby.,"Luis Suarez appeared to have inspired another turnaround at the RCDE Stadium after he cancelled out David Lopez's opener with a deft half-volley before digging out an exquisite pass for substitute Arturo Vidal to finish. But a red card for Frenkie de Jong with 16 minutes left gave Espanyol renewed hope and Chinese forward Wu emerged the hero, firing past stand-in goalkeeper Neto to rescue a point in Abelardo Fernandez's first game in charge. ""De Jong's sending off hurt us,"" said Barcelona coach Ernesto Valverde. ""We could have scored a third and then in one play we conceded. We had the game under control. The red card unsettled us a little."" Barcelona remain top of the table but only on goal difference, their two-point advantage removed after Real Madrid earlier clinched an impressive 3-0 win away at Getafe. Atletico Madrid moved up to third after beating Levante 2-1. Espanyol have not beaten their local rivals in the league since 2009 and are still four points from safety, yet this performance should do wonders for morale. They will be hoping for another rescue mission from new coach Abelardo, who took over Alaves with six points from 13 games in 2018 and led them to 14th. ""This can be a turning-point,"" he said. ""But we have to compete just like today because it won't be easy."" Barca now switch their attention to the Spanish Super Cup in Saudi Arabia next week, where a Clasico final awaits if Real Madrid beat Valencia in the last four and they can overcome Atletico. But Valverde will have much to ponder after defensive problems again undermined his team against the league's bluntest attack. Lopez was unmarked as he headed in Marc Roca's cross in the 23rd minute while at the other end chances were few and far between, with Lionel Messi going closest with a header at the back post. Vidal came on at half-time for Ivan Rakitic and Suarez worked his magic, angling his foot perfectly to divert Jordi Alba's cross inside the near post before picking out Vidal to make it 2-1 nine minutes later. De Jong received a second yellow card for pulling Jonathan Calleri's shirt but Barcelona were in command until the 88th minute when Wu struck. Freed by an excellent reverse pass by Matias Vargas, the 28-year-old shot across Neto and into the far corner. Espanyol might even have won it in injury-time as Calleri raced clear, only to fire over with two team-mates free inside him. Real Madrid made a more impressive start to their year as they picked apart a robust Getafe side, even without the suspended Sergio Ramos and injured Eden Hazard. Raphael Varane was the instigator of two goals at the Coliseum Alfonso Perez, first pressuring Getafe's David Soria into a missed punch and an own-goal, before himself heading home a cross from Toni Kroos. ""I'm happy with his performance but it's especially important when Sergio Ramos isn't there, to have another leader,"" said Madrid coach Zinedine Zidane. Luka Modric added a third deep into injury-time after a brilliant first-time pass by Gareth Bale had set Madrid away on the counter-attack. Thibaut Courtois appears finally to be finding his best form after a rocky start since his summer move from Chelsea, making three strong saves before Varane's second gave Madrid breathing space. ""He saved us two or three times in the first half, he was key,"" said Zidane. Atletico have struggled for goals this season but scored two in five minutes at the Wanda Metropolitano as Angel Correa converted Kieran Trippier's cross in the 13th minute before Felipe Monteiro added a second in the 18th. In between, Levante also equalised through Roger Marti and they might have snatched a point at the end only for Jan Oblak to produce a brilliant save to deny Enis Bardhi."
207,03/01/2020,18:57,Barcelona to be without goalkeeper Ter Stegen,Barcelona goalkeeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen will miss the derby match against Espanyol on Saturday through injury and is unlikely to play in next week's Spanish Super Cup.,"""It is true that he has some problems in the tendon,"" said coach Ernesto Valverde in a press conference on Friday. ""He will not be available tomorrow and for the Super Cup it will be difficult too. He will return after the Super Cup."" The club had said on Monday that Ter Stegen is undergoing treatment on a problem with his right knee. Barcelona said the decision to begin treatment was made after the team's last league match before the winter break against Alaves. Asked if Ter Stegen might need surgery, Valverde said: ""I don't know, I'm not a doctor, but we have not spoken about that. Our plan is that he will get better and we have not gone to that extreme."" Ter Stegen's absence means Neto will likely play in goal. The 30-year-old signed from Valencia last summer but has only made one appearance for his new club, against Inter Milan when Barca had already qualified for the Champions League's last 16. ""He has a great attitude, both in training every day and when he has played,"" Valverde said. ""We have no doubts about him."" Espanyol are bottom of La Liga but will be hoping to spring a surprise against their Catalan rivals in what will be their first game under new coach Abelardo. ""They are in a difficult situation but in a derby you play with your heart and they are going to try to give themselves a lift,"" Valverde said. Barcelona have allowed 21-year-old midfielder Carles Alena to join Real Betis on loan but Valverde said he does not expect more departures in the January transfer window. ""Alena has left, I thought that if it happened it wasn't going to be so soon but he had a chance to leave because of a clause in his contract,"" Valverde said. ""We have one less player now but I am not thinking about any others leaving."" Arthur Melo will also miss the game against Espanyol with a hip injury while Ousmane Dembele is still recovering from a hamstring problem."
208,02/01/2020,19:08,Barca and Real continue title tussle ahead of Super Cup,Barcelona and Real Madrid recommence their war of attrition on Saturday as Spanish league action returns briefly before the pair controversially head off to Saudi Arabia for next weekend's Super Cup.,"League leaders and defending champions Barcelona have an easy trip to cross town rivals Espanyol, who are floundering at the bottom of the table. However Espanyol hired former Barca player Abelardo Fernandez in the hope of turning their fortunes around after losing to second-bottom Leganes just before the Christmas break. Ernesto Valverde's Barca are unbeaten in all competitions since the start of November and sit two points ahead of Real Madrid despite some below-par performances. Madrid meanwhile return to action off the back of three straight draws before the break, including a goalless stalemate in the politically charged 'Clasico' in December. They have a trickier task than Barca too, with another derby against a Getafe side showing that their fifth-placed finish last year was no fluke. Coach Zinedine will be without the injured Eden Hazard for the clash, captain Sergio Ramos is suspended, although James Rodríguez, Brazilian Marcelo and Lucas Vázquez are all available. Both Barca and Real may switch up their line-ups given their controversial voyage to Saudi Arabia to contest the Super Cup, alongside Atletico Madrid and Valencia, from January 8. The decision in November hold a four-team tournament in Saudi Arabia in the European winter for the next three years has caused a storm in Spain. Spain's public broadcaster RTVE refused to bid for the rights to the match due to it being held in a country where ""human rights are not respected"". Barca will face Atletico and Valencia will play Real before the final on January 12, a radical revamp to what has traditionally been a the season's curtain raiser between the league champions and Copa del Rey winners. The tournament's scheduling means that La Liga will take another break while the Super Cup is being played, with league action restarting on January 17. Atletico will go to the tournament looking over their shoulder in the league. Diego Simeone's side were wildly inconsistent before the winter break, and have found goals hard to come by despite spending 126 million euros ($142 million) on Joao Felix in the summer. Fourth-placed Atleti have score just 20 times in 18 matches and have Getafe, Real Sociedad, Valencia and Athletic Bilbao all snapping at their heels for the final spot in the Champions League.

A crowd of football fans, including many wearing the Barcelona strip, gathered near the entrance as Suarez's clubmates Sergio Busquets and Jordi Alba arrived along with Ballon d'Or winner Messi and his wife, Antonella Roccuzzo. Brazilian star Neymar was also there, local media said. Uruguay striker Suarez and Balbi exchanged ""rings inscribed with their respective names, made from white gold and diamonds"", according to a statement. The couple met when Suarez was 14 and started seeing each other soon afterwards. They were married in 2009 and have three children."
211,21/12/2019,18:20,Messi shines in sparkling Barcelona Christmas stroll,Barcelona go into the brief Spanish winter break on top of La Liga after a glittering show from Lionel Messi helped the defending champions beat Alaves 4-1 on Saturday.,"Real Madrid, who drew 0-0 in Barcelona in the midweek Clasico, can draw level top on 39 points but behind on goal difference if they win at home to Atletico Bilbao on Sunday. Seville are assured third place over Christmas on 34 points after their 2-0 win in Mallorca. French star Antoine Griezzman put Barca ahead with a lovely snap-shot from outside the area after a slick exchange with Messi on 14 minutes. ""I needed to score a goal before the holidays, now I can go into them happy with myself,"" said the French World Cup winner who has scored just seven goals since his summer move. ""We have a great team with some of the best players around and when we don't click, well, there's always Messi."" Messi had already had a better strike ruled out by a harsh VAR decision, while Mohican-haired Chilean forward Arturo Vidal had tried a dramatic overhead effort that the Alaves 'keeper just about stopped with his feet. Vidal bagged a second just before half-time when put into open space on the right as Barcelona overwhelmed the visitors, but they should have gone into the break more than 2-0 ahead. Pere Pons pulled one back on 56 minute for Alaves with neither Gerard Pique nor the returning Samuel Umtiti on hand as his header flew home from close range. Even with four defenders around him, Messi was unstopabble on 69 minutes as he unleashed a trademark left foot strike from outside the box. The goal illustrated why the diminutive attacker recently won a sixth Ballon d'Or. A sweetly-struck Luis Suarez penalty made it 4-1 on 75 minutes."
212,18/12/2019,22:28,"Barcelona, Real stalemate in politically-charged Clasico","Barcelona and Real Madrid could not be separated on Wednesday in a Clasico that was briefly interrupted by Catalan independence protests, when dozens of yellow beach balls were thrown onto the pitch at Camp Nou.","After being postponed in October, there were renewed fears of unrest around Spain's most famous fixture. Protestors held banners, waved flags and even threw inflatable beach balls. However, although serious disruption inside the ground never materialised, there were clashes outside. Twelve people were injured when police charged hundreds of masked protesters who set garbage bins on fire, according to emergency services. The protesters, many of them carrying Catalan separatist flags, began setting up barricades in the middle of the street which they then set on fire, after police arrived in dozens of police vans. The match was less eventful than expected, with neither side ever really at their best and both, perhaps in the end, happier not to win than to lose. A goalless draw means Barcelona stay top of La Liga, ahead of Real on goal difference while the historic score in league meetings between the two rivals remains 72 victories apiece. Gerard Pique and Sergio Ramos both made clearances off the line in the first half but the best chance arguably fell to Lionel Messi, only for the Argentinian to uncharacteristically scuff his finish. ""More than a Clasico"", read the frontpage of Barcelona daily Mundo Deportivo on Wednesday morning ahead of a fixture that while always politically charged, had assumed even greater significance than usual. The game was originally due to be played on October 26 and the 53 days since seemed only to swell expectations around what Democratic Tsunami, the Catalan independence protest group, might do to disturb the most watched club match in the world. Yet in truth, there was less than expected. Only in the 55th minute of the second half was the game paused for a minute as stewards ran on to collect dozens of yellow beach balls that had been thrown onto the pitch. Blue banners bearing the slogan of Democratic Tsunami: 'Spain, sit and talk', were also held up. Four hours before kick-off, thousands had gathered at all four corners of the stadium to hold the same blue banners and wave Catalan flags, while some blocked traffic too. Both teams had departed from the same hotel and aside from whistles and insults directed at the Madrid team bus, both arrived without incident. Club president Florentino Perez gave a thumbs up as he walked in. Gareth Bale was last to get off, by which time he might have known he was starting for the first time in four matches. Ramos played in his 43rd Clasico, a record for any player in history. For Barcelona, Sergio Busquets was included in the line-up first announced before he was swapped out for Ivan Rakitic. Barca claimed it had been a communication error. If it was, it was not the first mistake of the night, with a frantic first half full of them. Real were the better side in the opening half an hour although Luis Suarez might have scored early had he controlled Jordi Alba's cross at the back post. There was a goalline clearance at both ends as Casemiro's header bounced up and had to be hooked away by Pique before Thibaut Courtois punched out to Messi but his shot was blocked by Ramos. Karim Benzema and Fede Valverde both tested Marc-Andre ter Stegen and Jordi Alba wanted a penalty for a Dani Carvajal handball but VAR was unmoved. Raphael Varane had a better case at the other end after having his shirt pulled by Alba. Ten minutes into the second half, stewards ran on to collect the beach balls and shortly after, Barcelona twice should have scored, only for Messi and Suarez both to fluff finishes in quick succession. Bale grazed the side-netting and the excellent Frenkie de Jong drove at Courtois after a neat one-two. Bale then did score with 15 minutes left but his provider Ferland Mendy was a fraction offside. Neither team wanted to go for broke in the latter stages."

Many held Catalan flags and blue banners that carried the group's slogan - 'Spain, sit and talk' - as well as the words 'Freedom, rights, self-determination'. ""We must take advantage of the magnitude of this match so the world can see our situation from Europe and around the world,"" said Antoni Rabull, a 73-year-old retiree. There was a visible police presence outside the stadium but there was little sign of trouble as protestors stayed true to Democratic Tsunami's pledge to carry out its demonstrations peacefully. ""To perform the action of Democratic Tsunami it is essential that the game can be played and the fans with tickets can enter the stadium,"" read a message posted by the group's official Twitter account. Police were also stationed outside the nearby Hotel Princesa Sofia, with players, coaching staff and referees instructed to gather there and then leave together for the match two hours before kick-off. Around 3,000 security personnel will be posted around the stadium after renewed fears of unrest. The original fixture in October had to be postponed due to violent demonstrations breaking out across Catalonia.

As well as the massive security presence in Barcelona, the numbers of private security staff in the stands will also be increased to reduce the threat of pitch invasions that could interrupt the game. ""The operation will ensure that the Clasico is played normally,"" said the chief commissioner of the Catalan regional police Eugeni Sallent. Democratic Tsunami hopes to transmit its message -- 'Spain, sit and talk' -- through the world's most watched club football fixture, which has an estimated global audience of 650 million. Barcelona have historically had a close association with Catalan nationalism, with Camp Nou routinely used as a setting for flags, banners and chants in support of the cause. The club could suffer the consequences of any altercations or interruptions during the game. At a meeting in Madrid last week, the RFEF warned it ""will apply the regulations in force,"" which range from heavy economic sanctions to the closure of Camp Nou to supporters."

215,18/12/2019,07:46,Zidane says Real Madrid only focused on football amid fears of Clasico unrest,Zinedine Zidane has said he is not worried about Wednesday's Clasico between Real Madrid and Barcelona being overshadowed by Catalan independence protests.,"The fixture was originally scheduled for October 26 but had to be postponed and there are renewed fears of unrest at Camp Nou, where Madrid and Barca will be playing for first place in La Liga. ""I am not worried about anything,"" said Zidane in a press conference on Tuesday. ""I am happy we are about to play a Clasico. It was the same when I was a player, these are the matches you live for, and you are focused only on what happens on the field."" Democratic Tsunami, the protest group in favour of Catalan independence, has called publicly for its supporters to gather at the stadium four hours before kick off at 1900 GMT. A large-scale safety operation will be deployed around the match involving 3,000 security personnel while both teams have been instructed to travel to the stadium from the same hotel. ""It's something different but the rules are the rules,"" said Zidane. ""They said we have to leave together so we're leaving together."" Zidane added: ""We never thought this game would not go ahead. What we have to do is put all our energy into the match because the rest, we could spend a week talking about it."" Barcelona and Real Madrid sit first and second in La Liga and level on points, with Barca only ahead on goal difference. Both teams have found form in recent weeks, in part due to the excellent form of their strikers. Madrid's Karim Benzema has nine goals in his last eight games while Lionel Messi has scored 14 in 12. ""We know we are facing a very good team, we know the player they have in Messi, but we also have our weapons,"" Zidane said. Eden Hazard, Marcelo, James Rodriguez, Lucas Vazquez and Marco Asensio will all miss the match through injury. Gareth Bale is fit again but has not started since Madrid's win over Alaves on November 30. ""Bale is with us, he is training well,"" Zidane said. ""He is an important player and tomorrow, he will be prepared like everyone else."""
216,18/12/2019,07:46,Zidane and Valverde to meet in Clasico battle of the survivors,Zinedine Zidane and Ernesto Valverde might have been fearing for their jobs if they had lost a Clasico back in October but its postponement means that on Wednesday they can face each other feeling more secure.,"Stalling in the autumn, Real Madrid and Barcelona have rolled through the gears in the lead-up to Christmas, meaning the winner of Wednesday's crunch meeting at Camp Nou will move seven points clear of third place. More importantly, in what increasingly looks like a two-pronged title chase, the winner will pull three ahead of the loser, with one round Liga matches left before the two-week winter break. Yet even for the loser, providing defeat is not a humiliation, the consequences will not be so grave. The gap in the table will be small and considering where both these teams were only a few weeks ago, when every week brought a new name linked with coaching jobs and every goal conceded planted another seed of doubt. For Real Madrid, Jose Mourinho was out of work and in the public eye, his increasingly frequent media showings even appearing to irk the usually immoveable Zidane. ""Football forgets what you've done in the past,"" said Zidane in October. ""I'm not going to tell you what they say doesn't bother me because it bothers me, but I can't prevent people giving their opinions."" For Barcelona, Ronald Koeman had surged into view after the Dutch Federation confirmed a clause in his contract that allows him to join Barca after Euro 2020 next summer. But if the rumours were an irritation, form on the pitch was a real concern. Barcelona's malaise was short-lived. They won only two of their opening five games. Results improved but performances were ponderous and the weaknesses all-too familiar, the kind that had also gone unfixed before, only to prove costly later in the season. In that sense, Valverde was carrying the weight of previous disappointments and he was blamed for a leaky defence, lack of style and failure to get the best out of Antoine Griezmann. ""At the start of the season, it's not about winning one title, it's about winning three or four,"" said Valverde in November. ""So the frustration when you don't win a game is high."" Zidane also shouldered burdens from last season. Even if it was not his team that limped its way through the final months, he was in charge and some wondered why nothing had changed. Suspicions grew when Madrid drew two of their first four league games and were thrashed away at Paris Saint-Germain. When they lost away at newly-promoted Mallorca, a week before the Clasico was meant to be played, it felt like results might unravel. ""We must have consistency,"" said Zidane. ""We have to have more life in our game."" Madrid did that as Zidane found a more settled side including the dynamic midfielder he has long-wanted in Fede Valverde as well as an 18-year-old gem in Rodrygo and arguably the world's most in-form striker in Karim Benzema. Eden Hazard got fit too and sparkled in spells before injuring his ankle earlier this month, which will rule him out until the new year. As Madrid hit their stride, Barcelona accelerated to keep up and the uncertainty around Valverde, although not gone, has, for now at least, faded. Their improvement cannot be entirely credited to the return of Lionel Messi, but his eight goals, including two hat-tricks, and four assists in six games have certainly helped. Griezmann is finding his feet too, with three goals in his last five. ""It is true we were struggling but we have also done things well,"" Valverde said last month. ""Leaders in La Liga, first in our Champions League group. We have to follow our path."" Judgement on Zidane's second coming will be guided by Madrid's staying power in the league while for Valverde, success will hinge on Europe, where recapturing the trophy after four barren seasons seems now to be the minimum for Barcelona. Storms may lie ahead but as La Liga approaches its halfway point, Zidane and Valverde are still intact. This Clasico is a battle of leaders, but survivors too."
217,16/12/2019,01:55,Benzema looks to put Messi in Clasico shade,Karim Benzema is finally filling the void left by Cristiano Ronaldo and on Wednesday his task will be to trump Lionel Messi.,"It will be the fifth Clasico since Ronaldo departed Real Madrid in 2018 and Spain's most prestigious fixture has not been quite the same without him, a duel lost between the world's two greatest players. But Benzema's surge means Madrid have rediscovered their punch up front while Barcelona know their opponents now possess a player who may not be able to rival Messi but, like him, could win this match on his own. ""We often talk about Karim these days,"" said Real coach Zinedine Zidane after Benzema scored against Espanyol this month. ""He's matured and I think that's what makes the difference. ""We all have small defects, things to improve. But what he is asked to do is to chase and he does it, to score goals and he does it. I can't ask anything more of him, only that he continues like this."" When Ronaldo was sold to Juventus, the theory was Benzema would have to be more prolific and Gareth Bale more prominent, a chance for the Welshman to finally to revel in the limelight. In truth, only one of them has fulfilled those hopes even if Bale's trajectory has again been flattened by fitness issues and Benzema's only began to turn upwards after Madrid's disastrous start to last season, which saw two coaches sacked in five months. Yet few could argue he has been Real Madrid's best player for the majority of 2019, ahead of Eden Hazard, signed for 100 million euros last summer, and Luka Modric, last year's winner of the Ballon d'Or. He has been more consistent than Sergio Ramos and more straight-forward than Bale, despite the possibility of a criminal trial still hanging over him for his alleged role in the blackmail case involving Mathieu Valbuena in 2015. That controversy still denies Benzema a place in the French national team and while Didier Deschamps' blackout has been vindicated by France's World Cup triumph last year, they continue to miss out on one the world's most lethal centre forwards. ""I work for Madrid,"" Benzema said on Sunday after he scored Madrid's 95th-minute equaliser against Valencia. ""What is said over there I don't listen to."" Perhaps that has been to Madrid's advantage and the test now for this resurgent Benzema is to define the biggest games in the way Messi has done his whole career. This season, Benzema has 16 goals in 21 matches -- more than Messi's 14 in 16 -- and he has nine in his last eight. Since Zidane returned in March, Benzema has 24 goals in 30. There is no doubt his performances have improved since Zidane came back. For many years Benzema was the foil to Ronaldo but he has become the complete package on his own -- a provider, chaser and scorer. ""What has changed is the number of goals,"" Benzema said. ""I have a lot of confidence in myself."" Zidane has been asked many times about Benzema's contributions and often he says what he likes most is the 31-year-old's focus on the team. ""We always talk about goals, but it's what he does for the others that I hold onto most,"" said Zidane last month. For Messi, the emphasis appears reversed as Barcelona increasingly spend matches trying to find ways to unleash their magic number 10. Invariably, Messi delivers, not just in the routine fixtures but when it matters most. In 41 meetings with Real Madrid, he has 26 goals. In 35, Benzema has nine. Fresh from winning a record sixth Ballon d'Or earlier this month, not to mention scoring eight goals and two hat-tricks in his last six games, Messi is in scintillating form. But Benzema is in the form of his life too and, at this moment, it could be him who owns this first Clasico of the season, that will decide who goes top of La Liga. Real Madrid are counting on it."
218,14/12/2019,18:13,Barca pegged back by Real Sociedad after Ter Stegen error,Barcelona gave Real Madrid the chance to go top of La Liga ahead of Wednesday's Clasico at Camp Nou as they were held to a 2-2 draw by high-flying Real Sociedad on Saturday.,"A mistake by Barca's usually excellent goalkeeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen gifted la Real an equaliser in a thrilling contest at Anoeta between two of the division's most attacking teams. Antoine Griezmann and Luis Suarez looked to have turned the game around after Mikel Oyarzabal scored an early penalty but Real Sociedad claimed a deserved point as Ter Stegen parried into the path of Alexander Isak. Madrid will pull two points clear at the top of the table if they win away at in-form Valencia on Sunday, which could prove a significant psychological boost ahead of their crunch meeting with Barcelona in midweek. Real Sociedad, meanwhile, move to within three points of Sevilla in third and showed why many have them circled as genuine challengers for Champions League qualification this season. Barca may have had one eye on their next encounter, particularly given renewed fears of unrest around the Clasico, which had to be postponed in October due to Catalan independence protests. Yet Real Sociedad were excellent value for their point, with Martin Odegaard, the Norwegian playmaker on loan from Real Madrid, delivering a majestic display to help his parent club's title bid. Barcelona were on the ropes for much of the first half an hour as Real Sociedad moved the ball quickly through the lines, with Odegaard the orchestrator. Odegaard gave Sergio Busquets a torrid time and too often Barca were opened up through the middle. On one occasion, Nacho Monreal might have shot but chose to cross, forcing Gerard Pique into a last-ditch clearance. The home goal though came from a corner as Busquets was spotted tugging Diego Llorente's shirt. The offence seemed minor but referee Javier Alberola had a clear view. Oyarzabal made no mistake from the spot. Barcelona were yet to create a genuine chance but in the 38th minute they were level as Suarez freed Griezmann, who drew the goalkeeper before scooping his finish brilliantly into the net. The visitors improved after half-time and were ahead within four minutes of the restart. Busquets clipped a ball over the top of Llorente, who stepped up at the wrong time, allowing Lionel Messi to skip free. He generously sidefooted left to Suarez, who had an open goal. Pique almost made it 3-1 but his header was cleared off the line by Mikel Merino. Instead Real Sociedad levelled. Monreal's cross caused panic and Ter Stegen parried the ball straight to Isak, who had a simple finish five yards out. Both teams pushed tentatively for a winner, perhaps wary of each other's threat on the break. Pique was adamant he deserved a penalty in injury-time as he and Llorente were both guilty of pulling each other's shirt at the back post."
219,14/12/2019,15:04,"Real Madrid not thinking about Clasico, says Zidane",Zinedine Zidane has brushed off suggestions Real Madrid could be distracted by the upcoming Clasico when they play in-form Valencia in La Liga on Sunday.,"Madrid face a difficult game at Mestalla, just three days before taking on Barcelona at Camp Nou in a match that could decide who goes top of the table. But Zidane's team cannot afford to underestimate Valencia, who have registered three consecutive victories, including one away at Ajax on Tuesday that secured qualification for the Champions League last 16 as group winners. Valencia sit eighth, while Barcelona and Madrid are level on points in first and second respectively. Asked about the Clasico, Zidane said in a press conference on Saturday: ""I'm not thinking about that at all and I include everyone who works here at the club in that. ""Our only concern is tomorrow's game. The rest may be close but at the same time it's far away. Tomorrow's game has all my energy and about Wednesday, I'm not interested."" After Barcelona, Real Madrid play at home to Athletic Bilbao, to complete a tough week before La Liga's Christmas break. Zidane admits it will be ""difficult not to rotate"" in the three fixtures and it remains to be seen whether Gareth Bale is given some minutes against Valencia, after he was left on the bench against Club Brugge on Wednesday. Bale has just recovered from a thigh injury sustained earlier this month. ""The other day Gareth didn't play but he is here and I am counting on him,"" Zidane said. ""The important thing is he is available and ready."" Zidane also has a dilemna over whether to select Casemiro against Valencia, given the Brazilian will be suspended for the game against Barca if he picks up a yellow card. Madrid are short of other options in defensive midfield. ""I have to pick a starting line-up thinking only about tomorrow's game - if I think about Wednesday, that would be a mistake,"" said Zidane. ""I always talk with the players because I'm interested in the feelings they all have. And with Casemiro, it's the same. We know his importance and what he gives to the team."" Ferland Mendy is banned against Valencia and Marcelo is out with a calf injury, meaning Nacho Fernandez or Eder Militao are likely to fill in at left-back. James Rodriguez trained alone on Saturday as he continues his recovery from a knee problem and will not be ready this weekend. Eden Hazard (ankle), Lucas Vazquez (toe) and Marco Asensio (cruciate ligament) are all out."
220,13/12/2019,17:23,Valverde says looming Clasico not distracting from Real Sociedad,Barcelona coach Ernesto Valverde insisted on Friday that his team were not looking beyond Saturday's La Liga match at Real Sociedad at the upcoming Clasico clash with Real Madrid.,"""The Clasico always grabs a lot of attention, but the players are much more aware of the next match because the Clasico is four days later,"" Valverde told reporters ahead of the trip to San Sebastian. The match at Barca's Camp Nou was originally scheduled for October 26 but was postponed as political protests by Catalonian separatists peaked. It is set to go ahead on Wednesday with heightened security after protest groups said they will target the match. However Barcelona president Josep Maria Bartomeu said on Thursday that the Clasico will be played and will not be postponed again. ""On Wednesday, we will think about what will happen on the field in the 90 minutes that is strictly football, strictly sporting and nothing else,"" said Valverde when asked if the team would change their routines because of the security surrounding the Clasico. ""We'll see what we do from Sunday, we're not thinking a bit beyond tomorrow's game. ""I do not want to distract from what we have tomorrow, because for us three points against Real Sociedad is the same as the three points against Real Madrid."""
221,13/12/2019,16:51,Neymar hits Barcelona with fresh lawsuit,"Brazilian forward Neymar has filed a fresh lawsuit against Barcelona to demand some three million euros of unpaid wages from his previous stint at the Spanish club, a judicial source said Friday.","The lawsuit was filed ""a few weeks ago"", the source told AFP, confirming a report published in Spanish daily newspaper El Mundo which said the Paris Saint-Germain player was suing the Catalan giants to collect ""3.2 million euros ($3.6 million) relating to his July 2017 salary"". According to the newspaper, Neymar alleges Barcelona withheld part of his salary when he quit the club to join the French side in 2017. Neymar's shock transfer to PSG for a then-world record 222 million euros ($250 million at the time) came less than a year after he signed a contract that would have kept him at the Spanish club until 2021. The 27-year-old player argues Barcelona ""did not pay him his final salary as a 'reprisal' for having claimed his extension bonus"", El Mundo reported. Neymar has already sued Barcelona to demand the paymenet of 64.4 million euros which he negotiated with the club in 2016 in exchange for the extension of his contract until 2021. A Barcelona court in September heard both sides in the dispute, but is yet to issue its ruling. Barcelona say they paid Neymar a first tranche of 20.75 million euros before he left for PSG, but did not pay him the rest. The player then sued to collect the rest of the sum. Barcelona counter-sued to demand that Neymar return the 20.75m euros he had already been paid."

Spain's most prestigious fixture was originally scheduled for October 26 but had to be postponed following a wave of pro-independence demonstrations in Barcelona which saw protesters hurl rocks at security forces and set up fiery barricades. Police ""will guarantee that the match goes ahead, fan access to the stadium and security both on and off the pitch,"" the Catalan interior affairs chief, Miquel Buch, told a news conference. Around 1,000 officers from Catalonia's regional police force, the Mossos d'Esquadra, will be deployed along with 2,000 agents from other police forces and private security agencies, Mossos chief commissioner Eugeni Sallent added. The deployment is usual for matches deemed ""high risk"" but this time it was boosted by ""hundreds"" of extra agents both inside and outside the statement because of the call to protest by Democratic Tsunami, he added. The agents will guard the vicinity of the Camp Nou beginning on Wednesday morning to ensure that the teams, referees and fans can enter the stadium without problems. They will also cordon off the area to ensure demonstrators can not get close to the stadium. Democratic Tsunami have urged protestors to gather at four points around Camp Nou from 4:00 pm (1500 GMT), four hours before kick-off. The group denied Friday on Twitter that it wanted to ""block or suspend the match"". ""On the contrary, we want to invite the whole world to see it,"" it added. Thousands of people have registered their interest online in attending the protest action. ""One of the most complex scenarios would be an invasion of the pitch. It is an extreme situation which in principle we don't contemplate as being probable but it is possible,"" said Sallent. Democratic Tsunami has in the past blocked access to Barcelona's airport and cut the main highway linking Spain to France for two days. The planned rally at the Camp Nou is the latest in a series of demonstrations that began two months ago when Spain's top court jailed nine Catalan separatist leaders over their role in a failed 2017 bid for independence. If a pitch invasion were to take place then Barcelona, which is responsible for security inside the stadium, could face hefty fines and be ordered to stage future matches behind closed doors. Barcelona has long been associated with Catalan independence. The club's fans often wave the yellow and red striped Catalan independence flag and hold up banners at the Nou Camp proclaiming in English that ""Catalonia is not Spain.""

Spain's most prestigious fixture was originally scheduled for October 26 but had to be postponed following a wave of pro-independence demonstrations in the city. ""I can say that the Clasico will be played, it will not be postponed again,"" Bartomeu said at a Christmas press event in Barcelona. ""It is everyone's responsibility to ensure it goes ahead. We know that we live in a complicated period in Catalonia but that can be compatible with sport.

""The club is preparing for the Clasico with complete normality and we tell our fans to come with their family and friends. ""Together we have to deliver a Clasico that is a celebration of sport and of people. We want peace and calm."" Democratic Tsunami have urged protestors to gather at four points around Camp Nou from 4:00 pm (1500 GMT), four hours before kick-off. ""In an exceptional situation, we should act in an exceptional way,"" said a statement from the group on Tuesday. The rally is the latest in a series of demonstrations that began two months ago when Spain's top court jailed nine Catalan separatist leaders over their role in a failed 2017 bid for independence."
224,10/12/2019,23:39,Fati makes history,Teenage prodigy Ansu Fati became the youngest player to score a Champions League goal as a second-string Barcelona side beat Inter Milan 2-1 to send the Italians crashing out of the competition on Tuesday.,"The 17-year-old Guinea-Bissau-born attacker picked up a Luis Suarez cross to fire home four minutes from time to become the youngest player to score in the Champions League. Barcelona were already through to the knockout stages as Group F winners and they left six-time Ballon d'Or winner Lionel Messi at home. But Serie A leaders Inter needed a win over the La Liga leaders or to match Borussia Dortmund's result at home to Slavia Prague to qualify on their superior head-to-head record. Instead the Germans made it through to the knockout rounds with a 2-1 win to finish three points ahead of third-placed Inter, who go into the Europa League. ""Seeing replays of Fati's goal hurt,"" said Inter coach Antonio Conte. ""It's a goal that cut our legs from under us and killed us from all points of view. ""We lacked that pinch of cynicism and precision to finish off. I have little to reproach my players, they have given everything."" Debutant Carles Perez had put the Spaniards ahead after 23 minutes at the San Siro, but Romelu Lukaku drilled in a equaliser just before the break to keep the hosts in the tie. Inter's forward pair of Lukaku and Lautaro Martinez had three goals ruled offside between them, two for the Argentine who has already scored five times in the competition this year. ""There was a lot of newness because we also changed our system,"" said Barcelona coach Ernesto Valverde. ""We had a few problems at the beginning because they put us under pressure, but little by little we managed to come out better. ""The scorers were young players, even very young for Ansu, who is a born scorer. ""It's a matter of pride that it's a player who is from our team. We want to win the Champions League, like the others."" Suarez had started on the bench with Antoine Griezmann and Perez leading the Spaniards attack. The Spaniards weathered an early Inter blitz on goal buoyed by the 72,000 crowd. Danilo D'Ambrosio blasted over in front of goal after just five minutes, with Lukaku having a goal ruled offside minutes later. But Perez made the breakthrough with Arturo Vidal setting up the 21-year-old to beat Samir Handanovic in the Inter goal. Martinez sent Lukaku through for the equaliser and the Belgium forward's effort took a slight deflection to beat Neto. But the Italians lost momentum after the hour mark with their midfield depleted with injuries to Stefano Sensi, Nicolo Barella, Alexis Sanchez and Roberto Gagliardini. Conte sent on Matteo Politano and Sebastiano Esposito for the final push as news filtered through that Dortmund were leading Slavia 2-1, and Inter needed to win. Martinez had the ball in the net on 80 minutes, but again it was ruled out for Lukaku's offside position. Finally Fati broke through to seal the win late for Barcelona and deny Inter a return to the knockout stages for the first time since the 2011-2012 season."

It is not clear who runs the shadowy protest group which emerged in September and on the day of the verdict managed to rally 10,000 demonstrators at Barcelona airport, paralysing all transport links and forcing the cancellation of more than 100 flights. Last month, its activists also staged a two-day protest blocking a key motorway linking Spain and France."

The Spaniards are also sure of finishing top of Group F as they have 11 points from five games. Antonio Conte's Inter still have to book their place in the last 16. They are second, level on seven points with Borussia Dortmund who host Slavia Prague.

228,07/12/2019,23:56,Messi hat-trick breaks La Liga record as Barca put five past Mallorca,Lionel Messi broke yet another record by hitting his 35th La Liga hat-trick on Saturday as Barcelona thrashed Real Mallorca 5-2 to keep pace with Real Madrid at the top of the table.,"A trio of vintage Messi finishes contributed to five stunning Barca goals, the best of them arguably belonging to Luis Suarez, whose brilliant backheel capped a free-flowing move, involving seven different players. ""I knew I had a little gap, my last resort was to try a backheel,"" said Suarez. ""I was surprised,"" added Barcelona coach Ernesto Valverde. ""It was an extraordinary goal."" But at the end of a week in which Messi claimed a record sixth Ballon d'Or, it was the Argentinian etching his name into the history books again after pulling clear of Cristiano Ronaldo's 34 La Liga trebles to stand alone. ""Unbelievable,"" said Valverde. ""It was a celebration of the Ballon d'Or."" The efforts of Messi and Suarez overshadowed Antoine Griezmann's opener but that was impressive too, the Frenchman applying a sumptuous chip after being assisted by his own goalkeeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen. An exhibition of creativity at Camp Nou allowed for the occasional lapse in defence and Mallorca's Ante Budimir twice reduced the deficit to 2-1 and 4-2, even if a comeback never looked likely. Instead, Messi underlined his status as the world's finest footballer with another sublime performance, instant evidence for why he was presented with his latest Ballon d'Or trophy on the pitch before kick-off. Messi now has 12 goals this season, the highest in the division and one ahead of Real Madrid's Karim Benzema, who had scored one and set up another in an equally comfortable 2-0 victory over Espanyol a few hours earlier. It means Madrid and Barcelona are back level on points at the top of the table, with Barca ahead on goal difference. Sevilla, in third, are four points further back. Benzema's own irresistible form in parallel with Messi adds an intriguing sub-plot to the upcoming Clasico on December 18, which looks increasingly likely to decide who will sit first over the Christmas break. ""We're talking about Karim a lot recently, in a good way,"" said Madrid coach Zinedine Zidane. ""He's getting older and that's made a difference, his maturity. ""None of us are perfect. But he's asked to chase and he does it. He's asked to score and he does it. I can't ask for more, only that he keeps doing it."" After rocky starts, La Liga's most successful two clubs also appear to be hitting their stride ahead of what is shaping up to be a crunch meeting in 11 days' time. Messi in this mood will be hard to stop. For his first goal, he cut in from the right and bent the ball into the top left-hand corner and his second was almost a carbon copy, Suarez setting it back for his partner to hit the same spot. In between, Budimir latched onto an excellent reverse pass by Salva Sevilla to briefly give Mallorca hope after Griezmann had opened the scoring, racing onto Ter Stegen's through ball and scooping it over Manolo Reina. Suarez hit the post and then stumbled after skipping around Reina but he made up for both two minutes before half-time with arguably the goal of the night. Ten passes, involving seven different players, ended with Suarez with his back to goal and somehow the Uruguayan dug out a superb shot with the back of his foot that span into the far corner. Frenkie de Jong had been instrumental in the build-up. Budimir capitalised on a rare Ter Stegen error to head in before Messi completed his hat-trick with seven minutes left. Sergi Roberto pulled back for Suarez, who set it up for Messi. His shot clipped the crossbar on its way in. Earlier, Benzema gave the assist to his compatriot Raphael Varane before scoring his 15th goal of the season. Varane's goal came in the 37th minute after Benzema had bundled through on the edge of the box. With his left foot, Varane stabbed into the far corner. Vinicius Junior, lively on his first start since October 19, might have made it two after tearing away on the break but he failed to beat Diego Lopez at his near post. Benzema also missed from a Vinicius cross but finally got his goal with 11 minutes left. He threaded in Fede Valverde with a smart reverse pass and then continued his run, before meeting the pull-back and finding the corner. Defeat means Espanyol stay 19th in the table, five points adrift of Mallorca in 17th."
229,05/12/2019,13:40,Hazard to miss Clasico after tests reveal ankle fracture,"Eden Hazard is set to miss the Clasico against Barcelona after further tests revealed a fracture in his right ankle, Real Madrid confirmed on Thursday.","Hazard was forced off during the draw with Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions League last week and despite Zinedine Zidane saying after the match he had suffered a ""bad twist"", Madrid announced the Belgian had been diagnosed with ""bruising"". But further tests have shown a fracture, with Hazard now expected to be out for around four to six weeks. It would mean he will sit out the Clasico at Camp Nou on December 18. ""After tests performed on our player Eden Hazard by the Real Madrid Medical Services during the process of improving the bruising in his right leg, he has been diagnosed with an incomplete external fracture in that area,"" a club statement. Marcelo is also likely to miss the game against Barcelona after the capital city club confirmed the defender has suffered an injury in his left calf. But Hazard's absence is the bigger blow to Zidane's side, who sit second in La Liga, behind Barca only on goal difference. It would have been the 28-year-old's first Clasico since he joined Real Madrid from Chelsea for 100 million euros ($110 million) last summer. Hazard had shown glimpses of his best form in recent weeks after a slow start in Spain, in part due to a thigh strain he picked up at the beginning of the season. Madrid play Espanyol at home on Saturday before three consecutive away games, against Club Brugge in the Champions League, Valencia and Barca. Their last fixture before the Christmas break will be at home to Athletic Bilbao."

""FC Barcelona and the player Ansu Fati have agreed on an improved contract until June 30, 2022, with two years optional, and on his release clause, which moves from 100 to 170 million euros,"" Barca said in a statement.

""I would like to stay here forever, but I have to be realistic and live from day to day."" Vidal has scored four league goals this campaign despite being a bit-part player. The former Juventus star did not say where he might move to. ""There are always offers, but for the moment I'm focused on Barcelona, working and helping my team as much as possible,"" he added. Vidal has slipped behind close-season arrival Frenkie de Jong and Ivan Rakitic in the pecking order at Barca, who lead rivals Real Madrid on goal difference at the top of the La Liga table. ""Matches go by, everyone tries to be good, to be prepared for when it will be their turn,"" he said. ""But the players still enjoy being the protagonists, playing every game, and I haven't had that opportunity."""

The striker was then handed a three-month suspension for comments he made after the game, in which he accused CONMEBOL, the governing body of South American football, of corruption. In-form Manchester City forward Sergio Aguero has been recalled after missing out on the last four friendlies, while Manchester United defender Marcos Rojo remains in the squad following his surprise recall after the Copa America. In Messi's absence, Argentina have played four friendlies, drawing against Chile (0-0) and Germany (2-2) while thrashing Mexico 4-0 and Ecuador 6-1. They face Brazil in Saudi Arabia on November 15 and then Uruguay in Israel on November 18. Messi's ban ends on November 3. The five-time Ballon d'Or winner has endured an injury-hit start to the season after hurting his foot in August and then his thigh in September.

236,31/10/2019,14:47,Barcelona's players offered to change contracts to sign Neymar,Gerard Pique has said Barcelona's players offered to alter their own contracts to help the club buy Neymar from Paris Saint-Germain last summer.,"Barca attempted to re-sign Neymar, sold to PSG for a world record 222 million euros ($249 million) in 2017, but the two teams were unable to agree a deal. Key players, including Lionel Messi, were eager for the Brazilian to return and Pique says they tried to help the club's president, Josep Maria Bartomeu, complete the transfer while satisfying UEFA's Financial Fair Play rules. ""What we proposed to the president was that we could tweak our contracts because we knew there was an issue with Fair Play,"" Pique told Cadena Ser on Wednesday night. ""Instead of getting paid what we were owed for that year, we could transfer it to the second, third of fourth year so Ney could come. ""Ultimately we wanted to support the club and if we could help in some way, we had no problem with that."" Neymar earns 38 million euros a year at PSG and the financial implications of signing the 27-year-old would be huge. ""We told him, 'you live in a golden prison',"" Pique added. ""But in football anything can happen and the door is open."" Pique also said the postponement of last Saturday's Clasico between Barcelona and Real Madrid was unnecessary. The fixture has been rescheduled for December 18 after violent protests broke out last week in Catalonia, following the imprisonment of nine pro-independence leaders. ""My opinion is the postponement was unnecessary,"" said Pique. ""Common sense says that in Spanish stadiums there has not been any violence. We are civilised people. ""That same weekend the Espanyol-Villarreal game was played and nothing happened. And why isn't something going to happen on December 18 if it was going to happen before? The situation will be similar. ""It was magnifying a problem that wasn't a problem in the first place."" Pique is also the founder of Kosmos, the investment group leading the revamp of tennis' Davis Cup, which begins in its new format in Madrid on November 18. The 32-year-old said the plan is for the new one-week competition with 18 teams to expand to two weeks and 24 teams, although Roger Federer has expressed scepticism about the changes. Asked if he would mind Roger Federer changing football, Pique said: ""Not at all."" Pique added: ""We sent him a letter and were surprised by his statements. They see the Davis Cup as competing with the tournament he has."""

The RFEF disciplinary committee ruled that Dembele's reaction constituted an ""attitude of contempt or disregard for referees"" and suspended the Frenchman for two matches. It means Dembele is unavailable for Barca's upcoming La Liga fixtures away at Eibar on October 19 and at home to Real Madrid on October 26.

238,09/10/2019,13:08,Messi says tax problems made him want to leave Barcelona,Lionel Messi has admitted he wanted to leave Barcelona when he was under investigation from the Spanish tax authorities but insists now he intends to finish his career at the club.,"In an interview with Catalan radio station RAC1, Messi also said he had expected Neymar to sign for Real Madrid last summer after Barca failed to strike an agreement with Paris Saint-Germain. Messi and his father Jorge were found guilty of defrauding Spain of 4.1 million euros in taxes between 2007 and 2009, for which they paid close to 10 million euros and Messi was handed a 21-month suspended prison sentence. Asked on Tuesday night if he had ever wanted to leave Barcelona, Messi said: ""In 2013-14, when I started having the tax problems, it was very difficult for me and my family."" ""My children were young and we had a very bad time. At that time, I had it in mind to leave, not because I wanted to leave Barca but because I wanted to leave Spain. I felt mistreated and I didn't want to be here anymore."" The 32-year-old's current contract expires in 2021 and Messi believes extending his deal ""will not be a problem"". ""Today it is clearer that my idea is to finish here,"" Messi said. ""For how I am at the club, for what I feel, and for the family and the children and how settled we are in this city. I would not like to disrupt that. ""Of course anything can happen but in principle, the idea is to stay here."" Messi began playing football aged six for Newell's Old Boys, the Rosario club he supports in Argentina. ""I always dreamed of being able to play again for Newell's and to have the experience of playing football in Argentina,"" he said. ""But I have already told them that sometimes you have to think about what is best for your family."" Messi was keen to be reunited with Neymar last summer but Barcelona were unable to agree a fee with PSG. ""I honestly thought at one time, especially in this market, that if he did not come here, he would go to Real Madrid Madrid because I thought he wanted to leave,"" Messi said. ""I wanted Ney to come because as a footballer, he is one of the best in the world. He is unpredictable, different and having him in our team would have given us more options."" Barcelona did sign Antoine Griezmann from Atletico Madrid, despite him rejecting the Catalans the year before. Messi denies suggestions of a rift between him and the Frenchman. ""The first year when we wanted to sign Griezmann, I said he was one of the best and that the best are always welcome,"" Messi said. ""I have never had problem with him coming. So it's a lie."" Messi also offered his support to Barcelona coach Ernesto Valverde, who has been under pressure after a bumpy start to the season followed the team's Champions League collapse against Liverpool in May. ""It was not the coach's fault but it was also not my decision for him to stay,"" Messi said. ""The club decided Valverde would continue and for me that was a joy, good for stability and he is a coach we support and love. ""If another coach comes, we will be with him. To achieve success, we all have to be united."" Messi scored his first goal of the season in a 4-0 thrashing of Sevilla on Sunday, after two months spoiled by calf and thigh injuries. ""I'm still a bit short but I'm feeling better,"" Messi said. ""My legs hurt against Sevilla but it's what happens when you come back. I'm getting closer."""
239,08/10/2019,17:00,Griezmann all smiles at Barcelona - Lenglet,"Antoine Griezmann is just as happy playing for Barcelona as he is for France despite rumours of dressing room unrest amid an underwhelming start at the Catalan giants, his club and national side team-mate Clement Lenglet said on Tuesday.","""I am with him at the club and he is very happy there too. He's someone who is smiling every day and that doesn't change when he arrives in the French team,"" Lenglet told reporters ahead of France's Euro 2020 qualifiers against Iceland and Turkey. ""He makes the most of everything, he loves making jokes and he doesn't change whether he's with the French team or Barcelona."" Griezmann was left on the bench for Barca's 4-0 drubbing of Sevilla on Sunday after failing to live up to his 120 million-euro ($135 million) price tag in the opening weeks of the season, scoring three goals in nine games. Lionel Messi has also denied suggestions of a rift between him and the Frenchman, who joined from Atletico Madrid in July, as he struggles to find a settled position in Ernesto Valverde's three-man forward line. ""For me, he's a player that has just arrived -- and at a club like Barca, who play a little differently from other clubs -- and he's already scored three goals. He works a lot for the team. ""He helps us a lot with his talent, with his defensive effort, because he is a player who sacrifices a lot for the team. I don't think there is any problem with Antoine Griezmann."" Griezmann was replaced in Barca's starting line-up against Sevilla by another French forward, Ousmane Dembele, who scored before being sent off for dissent late on. Dembele will miss the clash with Real Madrid on October 26 if banned for two games, continuing a disjointed start to the campaign for the 22-year-old, who has already sat out six games this term through injury. ""If he gets consistent game time, he is a player who has all the qualities to play for the French team,"" said Lenglet, who is expected to start France's Euro 2020 qualifiers against Iceland on Friday and Turkey on Monday. ""Unfortunately he got this red card that will slow him down a bit again. He has a lot of talent, he's unpredictable, he has qualities that are quite unusual. But it takes experience so he can play matches and perform."""

""It was crucial for us,"" said coach Ernesto Valverde whose team ended the game with nine men. ""It has been a strange start to the season and we have not added all the points we would have wanted."" Suarez launched the flurry, his stunning left-footed bicycle kick arguably even better than the volley he scored in the Champions League win over Inter Milan on Wednesday. Vidal then finished a superb passing move that involved all 11 Barca players and Dembele powered through to make it three before Messi added a fourth in the second half. The match descended into farce late on as Barcelona's debutant Ronald Araujo was sent off and Dembele followed after collecting a second yellow card for dissent. The referee's report said Dembele was dismissed for calling Mateu Lahoz ""very bad"". He could now miss the Clasico on October 26. ""Dembele's is a mystery,"" said Valverde. ""It is very difficult to get words out of him in Spanish, so what he said couldn't have been very long."" By then, the game was long gone as victory pushed Barcelona up to second in the table, two points behind Real Madrid and one above Atletico, who could have done with some of the Catalans' classy finishing in their goalless draw away at Real Valladolid. For all the turbulence and scrutiny on Valverde and Zinedine Zidane, Barca and Madrid head into the international break not only as the league's two frontrunners but with confidence and momentum too. Eden Hazard scored his first goal for Madrid in their 4-2 win over Granada on Saturday and Barca's star man is off the mark as well after his own injury-interrupted start to the season. This was Barcelona's fourth consecutive victory. Messi's return has increased the pressure on Antoine Griezmann, who was left out of the starting line-up following his quiet display against Inter. Dembele was preferred on the left of the front three. Sevilla, who drop to sixth, had eight shots to Barcelona's seven in the first half but were three down at the break. Luuk de Jong is yet to score since his move from PSV Eindhoven last summer and the 29-year-old had four excellent chances to break his duck, three of them before Barca had taken the lead. He fired Lucas Ocampos' pull-back straight at Marc-Andre ter Stegen, sidefooted wide and mistimed a header. In the second half, Arthur lost possession on the edge of his box but still De Jong could not capitalise, lashing his shot against the post. In between, Barca had already made him pay. Suarez's effort was probably the pick of the trio in terms of difficulty, as he launched himself into the air, turned and threw his weaker left foot over the ball, and banged it into the net. Five minutes later it was two, this one a team goal, quite literally, as all of Barca's players touched the ball in 85 seconds of build-up. Arthur's cross was the 25th pass, finding the sliding Vidal who was just onside. The third three minutes later was about pace and power, and a mistake from Sevilla too, as Arthur robbed Fernando Reges. Dembele raced clear, fooled Diego Carlos with a dummy shot, before guiding the ball into the far corner. After his fourth miss, De Jong was taken off and Messi went close after a barnstorming run. The only surprise was that he had not yet scored and he fixed that in the 78th minute after Sevilla gave him a third attempt at a free-kick. This time he did not miss. The 20-year-old defender Araujo had come on for his debut in the 73rd minute and was sent off in the 87th for tugging down Javier Hernandez as Barcelona's last man. Dembele then saw red after picking up a second yellow card for dissent. Atletico's stalemate means they have managed only two wins from their last seven games in all competitions and they could even have lost if Valladolid's Sandro Ramirez had not skied a first-half penalty. Diego Simeone's side managed only one shot on target. Valladolid sit 13th, with two wins from eight games."
241,04/10/2019,02:40,Rollercoaster start leaves La Liga awaiting serious contenders,Real Madrid have hardly got going and Granada have just arrived but La Liga's chaotic opening few weeks means they face each other in an unlikely battle of first against second on Saturday.,"By the end of the eighth round in Spain, seven teams could potentially go into the international break at the top of the table, with Athletic Bilbao in seventh, only three points behind Madrid at the summit. In between, Barcelona sit fourth and Sevilla sixth, with those two also up against each other at Camp Nou on Sunday. Atletico Madrid and Real Sociedad complete the group of early front-runners. None have truly convinced after a merry-go-round of results against each other that leaves few patterns and many doubts. Madrid beat Sevilla but were held by Atletico while Granada beat Barcelona but lost to Sevilla. Real Sociedad beat Atletico but lost to Bilbao and Sevilla, who beat Granada and la Real but lost to Real Madrid. Bilbao, who visit Celta Vigo on Sunday, have not lost to any of the leading seven while Barcelona and Atletico, last season's champions and runners-up, have not beaten any of them. ""La Liga is complicated for everyone right now,"" said Atletico coach Diego Simeone last month. ""Everyone is trying to build some momentum."" After two years of domestic disappointment, Zinedine Zidane said in April the league would be Madrid's priority this season and they remain unbeaten, approaching Granada and have three consecutive clean sheets in the league. Yet aside from an excellent win away at Sevilla last month, Zidane's team have looked laboured, particularly at the Santiago Bernabeu, where the tension and frustration in the stands has regularly taken hold on the pitch. Eden Hazard has been sluggish and the midfield stodgy. Thibaut Courtois in goal was whistled on Tuesday, his popularity with the fans still to be established. ""Criticism doesn't affect me,"" Hazard said on Monday. ""I've never taken notice of it. Everyone expects me to score three goals in every game but you have to wait a bit, I've had an injury. Goals will come."" Madrid were held 2-2 by Club Brugge in the Champions League in midweek. If Granada were watching, they may have concluded there is little to fear this weekend. Promoted after finishing second in Segunda last term, Diego Martinez's side have made a remarkable start, even if their coach feigns ignorance about their heady place in the table. ""We are not interested,"" he said last month. ""I don't look at the table. In May, I will."" By then, few would expect Granada still to be among the leading pack. Sevilla and Athletic Bilbao look better equipped to last the distance and replace Valencia in the top four. Sevilla made 12 signings in the summer but have gelled quickly under Julen Lopetegui, even if their thrilling 3-2 victory over Real Sociedad last weekend was as nervy as it was needed following two consecutive defeats. Lopetegui knows better than most the fragility of strong starts. His Real Madrid side won four of their opening five league games last term before they lost form and he lost his job. In that way, hopes for an open title race may also be premature. At this stage 12 months ago, there were also three points between first and seventh. Barcelona led but were only one point better off than they are now. They went on to win the title by 11 points. Ernesto Valverde will be counting on a similar gathering of momentum after Barca made it three wins out of three by beating an impressive Inter Milan side on Wednesday, with a fit-again Lionel Messi back in the fold. After the game, Messi dismissed talk of rifts between the players and board while admitting in almost the same breath that the club's pre-season tours had hampered, not helped, the team's preparations. ""But I have no doubt we are going to get better,"" said Messi."
242,03/10/2019,00:39,Messi denies Barcelona rifts after Inter victory,Lionel Messi insisted on Wednesday there are no problems between him and Antoine Griezmann or between the players and Barcelona's board.,"Messi returned from injury to make his second start of the season against Inter Milan in the Champions League as Barca came from behind to win 2-1. Speaking after the match, Messi was asked about his relationship with Griezmann, who had said on Tuesday it was ""difficult"" to establish a connection with the Argentine while he had been injured. ""Obviously we have no problem,"" Messi said. ""There is a good relationship with everyone, the dressing room is united. We needed this victory and hopefully now we can kick on and continue in this way."" Luis Suarez scored a sensational double at Camp Nou and it was Messi that supplied the Uruguayan's 85th-minute winner, with a pass at the end of a weaving run down the right. Barcelona now sit level on four points with Borussia Dortmund in Group F. There have also been suggestions of a rift between Barcelona's players and the board, with Gerard Pique implying last weekend that articles critical of the team had come from higher up the club, however Messi denied the relationship had soured ""We are fine. The important thing is to talk about the triumph of today and against Getafe,"" he said. ""We have Sevilla now to finish well before the international break. We will try to win it because it creates a mess when there is no football so we want to finish well and go out on a high before the break."""
243,20/09/2019,16:05,Barcelona starlet Fati granted Spanish citizenship,"Barcelona's 16-year-old starlet Ansu Fati was granted Spanish citizenship on Friday, a government spokeswoman said, meaning he will be able to represent Spain at international level.","Socialist Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez's cabinet approved a request made by the justice minister to give the Guinea-Bissau-born forward Spanish citizenship during its weekly meeting, the spokeswoman said. Fati was just seven years old when he moved to Spain from an impoverished west African family and his startling talent meant he was invited to join Barcelona's prestigious youth academy 'La Masia' aged 10. In August, he became the youngest player to score for Barcelona in La Liga and on Tuesday, the club's youngest player to play in the Champions League. Spain's national coach Robert Moreno described Fati's full debut for Barcelona last weekend as ""mind-blowing"" after he scored one goal and set up another in a 5-2 win over Valencia. His first major tournament for Spain could come as early as October, when the 2019 FIFA U-17 World Cup kicks off in Brazil."
244,20/09/2019,02:25,Sevilla await weakened Real Madrid at Liga summit,Both Barcelona and Real Madrid travel to Andalusia this weekend in search of precious Liga points after stuttering form in Europe and in their domestic campaigns as table-toppers Sevilla await Zinedine Zidane's injury-stricken outfit.,"Real, thrashed in the Champions League by PSG midweek, face a daunting challenge to regroup at Sevilla, while Barcelona go to an unlikely mountain stronghold to face plucky Granada. Led by Julen Lopetegui, sacked by Spain on the eve of last year's World Cup for accepting a job at Real, the coach will have extra motivation to prove himself after flopping in the Madrid hot-seat. His current charges are on ten points from four matches, but Real can climb above them Sunday with an away win. ""Being top means nothing,"" Lopetegui said last week. ""But it does tell us the team is doing things well."" Sevilla did well again in the Europa League on Thursday coming back from a marathon trip to Baku with a 3-0 win at Qarabag. Real have lost on their last four visits to the Ramon Sanchez Pizjuan, and on six of their last seven trips there. Big-money signing Eden Hazard struggled on his first start for Real on Wednesday as the team failed to muster a single effort on target despite presence of Karim Benzema, James Rodriguez and Gareth Bale. ""It's complicated if you are not strong and don't get into the rhythm,"" said Zidane, under mounting pressure in his second spell at the club. Madrid goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois immediately turned his attentions on their trip to Seville. ""We're all in the same boat. We sink or swim together and we have a big match on Sunday, and that is what we need to focus on,"" said Courtois. ""We need to forget this defeat, it is hard but we have another game on Sunday and we need to focus on that,"" added Zidane. It may be stretching it to say his position is under threat at the moment, but another defeat this weekend might change that, and a derby away to Atletico awaits a week later. Lionel Messi is in line for his first league start of the season after he came on late at Borussia Dortmund in Europe in midweek. The Argentine wizard, who mised the beginning of the campaign with a calf injury, was unable to lift his team past the Germans, who held on for a 0-0 draw in their Champions League opener. Barca fans will hope his partnership with new signing Antoine Griezmann and Luis Suarez can revive memories of the fearsome attacking trident that lost much of its lustre following the 2017 sale of Neymar. With their stadium nestled in the Sierra Nevada not far from the ancient Alhambra fortress promoted, Granada are punching above their weight this season as their coach Diego Martinez admitted after last week's win at Celta Vigo. ""If you had told me when the calendar came out we'd have seven points already, I'd have thought you very optimistic,"" he said. 7 - After a determined comeback to draw 2-2 with Juventus in midweek, second-placed Atletico Madrid host Celta. Diego Simeone's men are unbeaten in seven home games with Saturday's opponents since the Argentine took charge. 7 - The number of goals scored by Sergio Ramos against Sevilla.

245,19/09/2019,16:49,Barcelona predict billion euro income this season,"Barcelona expect to record revenues of more than one billion euros for the 2019-2020 season, becoming the first football club to pass the mark, the Catalan club announced on Thursday.","According to figures released ahead of the general meeting of their ""socios"" (supporters, shareholders) scheduled for October 6, Barca expect a revenue of 1.047 billion euros ($1.16 billion) in the fiscal campaign just started, which is six percent more than last season when the club generated 990 million euros. ""It's an historic record for a sports club, it's better than the NBA and NFL franchises and other football clubs,"" Barcelona managing director Oscar Grau told a news conference. Barcelona president Josep Maria Bartomeu had set a strategic goal of being the first outfit to reach the one billion euro mark by the end of his presidency in 2021. Main sporting rival Real Madrid, president Florentino Perez targetted a similar goal. In the projected budget presented by Barca, the expenses amount to 1.007 billion euros for a net profit after tax of 11 million euros. Grau explained that ""one of the club's challenges"" was to ""reduce the payroll"" of its professional athletes. In 2019-2020, spending on sports salaries is expected to fall by three percent, from 525 to 507 million euros. The club has budgeted 73 million euros to finance the remodelling of Camp Nou and its surroundings, a vast project called ""Espai Barca"". Grau, who said in 2018 he was hopeful to find a title sponsor for the project by the end of the first half of 2019, said the club was continuing its research and studying alternative forms of financing. ""We want to make a good deal, we do not want to sell, so we are looking for a financial restructuring of Espai Barca so that the project does not stop,"" said Grau. Regarding the accounts for the 2018-2019 financial year, the treasurer Enrique Tombas confirmed the figures mentioned during the summer by the club: 990 million euros of turnover, 973 million euros of expenses and a profit after tax of five million euros."
246,17/09/2019,23:01,Messi returns as fearless Dortmund frustrate Barcelona,Lionel Messi returned from injury to make an innocuous first appearance of the season as Barcelona were held to a 0-0 draw away at Borussia Dortmund in their Champions League opener on Tuesday.,"Messi, who has missed the start of the season with a calf injury, came off the bench in a game which Barcelona were lucky not to lose after Dortmund captain Marco Reus missed a penalty and several chances in the second half. Lucien Favre's side delivered on their pre-match promise to play fearlessly against five-time European champions Barcelona, probing the visitors from the wings and repeatedly finding gaps in the back line. Both sides had chances in a game of cat and mouse in the first half, but it was Dortmund who looked the more likely to score. Reus was denied at point-blank range by goalkeeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen and Jadon Sancho fired the ball over the crossbar shortly before half-time. The hosts continued to turn the screw after the break, and were rewarded with a penalty when Nelson Semedo tripped Sancho in the box. Yet Ter Stegen denied Reus again from 12 yards, diving low to his left to beat away his Germany team mate's spot-kick. The Barcelona keeper has now saved four of the six penalties he has faced in the Champions League, and was called upon to stop Reus yet again later in the half as Dortmund continued to dominate. A luckless Reus also fired another good chance well high, while substitute Julian Brandt thundered a long-range effort against the crossbar. Messi had begun his 30-minute cameo by that point, having come on around the hour mark for Ansu Fati, the 16-year-old prodigy freshly crowned as Barcelona's youngest ever Champions League debutant. Yet the Argentine remained as blunt as his team mates in a Barcelona attack stifled by the impeccable defending of Dortmund elder statesmen Mats Hummels and Axel Witsel. He nonetheless had a chance to score the winner with the last kick of the game, but was denied by a desperate block from Thomas Delaney. The draw leaves the two teams joint bottom of Group F after one game, after Inter Milan and Slavia Prague played out a 1-1 draw earlier on Tuesday."
247,16/09/2019,21:17,Ter Stegen hits back at Neuer in Germany row,"Barcelona goalkeeper Marc-Andre Ter Stegen on Monday accused Manuel Neuer of making ""inappropriate"" comments in a war of the words between the two Germany stoppers.","The dispute between the two keepers arose after Ter Stegen expressed his frustration at a lack of opportunities to play for the national team last week. ""I don't think it is up to Manuel to express an opinion on my feelings,"" said Ter Stegen at a press conference ahead of Barcelona's Champions League clash with Borussia Dortmund on Monday. The undisputed number one at Barcelona, Ter Stegen has struggled to usurp Neuer as Germany number one, and claimed it was a ""tough blow"" to sit on the bench through Germany's two Euro 2020 qualifiers earlier this month. Neuer responded critically to the 27-year-old's comments, suggesting that Ter Stegen had hurt the team by speaking out. On Monday, Ter Stegen hit back, calling Neuer's comments ""inappropriate"". ""Everyone has seen how I have conducted myself over the last few years,"" he said."
248,16/09/2019,20:47,Messi comeback possible as Barcelona launch Champions League charge,Barcelona coach Ernesto Valverde said Monday that Lionel Messi could make his comeback against Borussia Dortmund as the Catalan giants launch a fresh assault on the Champions League title in Germany on Tuesday evening.,"Messi, who has missed the beginning of the season with a calf injury, was named in Barcelona's squad for Tuesday's Champions League opener, though it remains unclear whether the Argentinian will play. ""We will decide tomorrow. For the last week we have been unsure whether he will be able to play, but he has trained two or three times and made a good impression. We will see,"" said Valverde at a press conference on Monday. The Barcelona coach refused to say whether 16-year-old Ansu Fati, who became the club's youngest ever goalscorer earlier this month, would break another record by becoming the youngest ever Champions League debutant on Tuesday. ""If he plays, then it will not be because of the record,"" said the coach. Valverde said that his team were looking to put the past behind them after their dramatic semi-final defeat to eventual winners Liverpool in last season's Champions League. ""If you have one bad day, you can be knocked out of this competition. We lost just one match last season, but it was a decisive match,"" he said, adding that Barcelona wanted to go further this year than they had in the past two seasons. Yet Marc Ter Stegen, Barcelona's German keeper, who played under current Dortmund coach Lucien Favre at Borussia Moenchengladbach earlier in his career, warned that Dortmund would provide a tough first test. ""Lucien Favre is one of the best coaches I have ever worked under, and he will have thought of a way to hurt us,"" said the German. ""It is always difficult to come here, and we always struggled here with 'Gladbach, but we will try to win and get a good start to the competition."" ""It is a spectacular stadium and the supporters are always crazy, but we will try not to be influenced by that."" Barcelona have conceded six goals in four games this season and are yet to win away from home. ""We are conceding a lot of goals at the moment, we have to accept that and try to improve,"" Ter Stegen ""Some of the mistakes we are making are easy to correct."""
249,16/09/2019,15:10,Reus plots Dortmund path past Barcelona,"Borussia Dortmund captain Marco Reus insisted Monday that his team could beat Barcelona regardless of whether Lionel Messi plays or not, but feared however that Dortmund would 'have to suffer' when the two sides meet in the Champions League on Tuesday.","Messi is a doubt for Tuesday's game amid ongoing struggles with a calf injury, but Reus suggested Dortmund could win if they play to their own strengths instead of obsessing over the opponent. ""We have to concentrate on ourselves. We have a good team, we are at home, and we can win the game,"" said Reus at a press conference on Monday. ""It will of course be a tough game tomorrow, and we are going to have to suffer a lot,"" he said. Tuesday's Champions League opener is a baptism of fire for Dortmund as they look to qualify from a fiercely difficult group which pits them against Barcelona, Inter Milan and Slavia Prague. Yet Reus said his side were confident they could make a perfect start by beating Barcelona on Tuesday. ""It is important to start well in the group. We are confident enough to say that we can win the game,"" he said. ""We want to test ourselves against the best clubs. We have to be bold, push forward and try to score goals."" Both sides come into the game on the back of impressive results against top-four rivals in their domestic leagues at the weekend, as Dortmund thrashed Bayer Leverkusen 4-0, and Barcelona beat Valencia 5-2. The injured Messi watched that win from the stands, meaning he is still waiting to make his first appearance for Barcelona this season. The 32-year-old has been named in the squad for Tuesday's game, but is expected to make a cameo appearance at most in Dortmund. Reus said he hoped that Messi would be on the pitch on Tuesday evening. ""I would be happy if he played. They are better with him because he has abilities which nobody else has,"" said the Dortmund captain. Dortmund coach Lucien Favre said that it made little difference to his preparations whether Messi would play or not. ""They are good with or without him. They play 4-3-3,"" said the Swiss. ""They were very good against Valencia, when they had a 16-year-old playing in Ansu Fati."" ""They can play football, but they are also good on the counter-attack. We will have to be on our game for 95 minutes tomorrow, and be ready for everything."""
250,15/09/2019,13:21,"Teenager Fati lights up Barca, Benzema brilliance inspires Real","Ansu Fati, the 16-year-old starlet from Guinea Bissau, scored his second goal of the season as Barcelona breezed to a 5-2 win against Valencia on Saturday.","Karim Benzema netted twice for Real Madrid as they fought off a late comeback to beat Levante 3-2 as Eden Hazard made his La Liga debut. Atletico Madrid retained their place at the top of the table, but only by one point from Real Madrid after their first defeat of the season when they lost 2-0 at Real Sociedad at the Basque club's newly refurbished stadium. With Lionel Messi still out and watching from the stands at the Camp Nou it was left to Fati take the plaudits. Fati, who became the third youngest scorer in La Liga history when he came off the bench to net in a 2-2 draw at Osasuna this month, scored in the second minute, before providing the assist for Frenkie de Jong's seventh minute goal. The teenager got a standing ovation when he came off after an hour. Barca coach Ernesto Valverde marvelled at Fati's composure. ""It's not usual that on his first touch he scores, and on his second he sets up a goal,"" he said. ""To get used to being a Barca player is work for anyone, even more so for a boy so young, but he's a balanced kid, he strikes me as being at ease."" Kevin Gameiro got Valencia off the mark but a brace from the fit-again Luis Suarez meant Max Gomez's injury time second for the visitors was purely academic. The defeat left Valencia with just four points from four matches, leaving new coach Albert Celades -- a former Real Madrid assistant coach -- with a huge amount of work to do before the club play their first Champions League group game against Chelsea on Tuesday. At a rain-drenched Santiago Bernabeu, Benzema's goals came just six minutes apart in the first half before Casemiro put Real 3-0 up. However Levante, who had won their previous two outings, made a fight of it in the second half as they pulled goals back through Borja Mayoral and Gonzalo Melero. ""The second half was more difficult for us, but the overall feeling was positive,"" said coach Zinedine Zidane, whose team had drawn their previous two games. ""We have got the three points and we were incredible in the first half, the way we played, the goals, the commitment. We just need to stay focused for the full 90 minutes."" Hazard also came off the bench for the final half-hour to make his first La Liga appearance after a thigh injury had interrupted the start of his Real career following his 100 million-euro ($110 million) move from Chelsea. The Belgian could now start when Real go to Paris Saint-Germain for their opening Champions League game on Wednesday. ""I am happy for him,"" said Zidane. ""He will do us good. He is not ready yet though -- he has only trained four times with the team. But when everyone is fit, when we have our rhythm, we will hurt teams."" Gareth Bale will also be available to face PSG after suspension kept him out on Saturday, but Sergio Ramos will be unable to play because of a European ban. Real would have won by a greater margin here had it not been for some inspired goalkeeping from Aitor Fernandez, who produced a stunning one-handed stop to keep out a Benzema shot midway through the first half."
251,13/09/2019,21:23,Messi still out but Barcelona could welcome back Suarez,"Forward Luis Suarez could return to the Barcelona team for their La Liga game against Valencia, coach Ernesto Valverde said on Friday, adding that he was pessimistic about Lionel Messi's recovery.","""Suarez participated in a full training yesterday and again today,"" Valverde said. ""We hope he can play."" The 32-year-old Uruguayan limped off with a calf problem in a 1-0 opening-weekend loss to Athletic Bilbao on 16 August. At the time the club forecast he would be out for a month. A return Saturday would be in line with that prediction. On Thursday, Messi, who also has a calf problem, encouraged hopes that he would be back for Barcelona's opening Champions League game at Borussia Dortmund next Tuesday. His coach was more cautious on Friday. ""We think he's about to come back,"" Valverde said. ""I don't want to say anything to avoid creating expectations, but I think it will be difficult for Tuesday."" Barcelona have one win in three games, their worst league start since 2008. They received further bad news on Friday when centre-back Samuel Umtiti was ruled out for ""five to six weeks"" with the foot injury he suffered while training with the French national team last week. On Saturday, they welcome a Valencia team that has the same record but has been plunged into crisis following the surprising dismissal of coach Marcelino."
252,13/09/2019,01:02,Valencia in crisis as Barcelona and Chelsea clashes loom,"Valencia should be looking forward to a prestigious double-header against Barcelona in La Liga and Chelsea in the Champions League, instead find themselves in full-blown crisis after the sacking of coach Marcelino Garcia Toral.","Marcelino was fired on Wednesday and replaced by the former Barcelona, Real Madrid and Spain midfielder Albert Celades, who faces a tough baptism at the Camp Nou on Saturday. The sacking of Marcelino, 54, by Valencia's Singaporean owner Peter Lim has exposed frictions at a club that had been revived by the coach since his appointment in 2017. The two-time former Champions League runners-up are fresh from successive top-four finishes in La Liga and last season beat Barcelona in the Copa del Rey final to lift their first silverware in 11 years. However, Marcelino, the ex-Sevilla and Villarreal boss, was critical of the club's transfer policy over the close season, including attempts to sell Spain striker Rodrigo Moreno to Atletico Madrid. Rodrigo ended up staying, as did Marcelino, for the opening three matches of the campaign. But after taking four points from a possible nine, including a 2-0 win over Mallorca just before the recent international break, the coach has been ousted as the team prepare for two of their biggest matches of the season. ""I am sure you will do well wherever you go and wherever they let you work,"" said captain Dani Parejo in a very pointed Twitter post. The 43-year-old Celades, who had a spell as assistant coach at Real Madrid last season, is therefore stepping into a potentially hostile environment. ""Valencia is like a bull, a huge club,"" he said. ""I am not afraid. I know there are huge demands and I understand the concern. I don't have a lot of experience in club management."" After Saturday's game, Valencia travel to London to take on Chelsea in their opening match in Group H of the Champions League, in which they will also face Ajax and Lille. In Real Madrid's final outing before beginning their Champions League campaign away to Paris Saint-Germain, Zinedine Zidane's side entertain Levante on Saturday. They will do so without Gareth Bale, who is suspended after being sent off against Villarreal in Real's last outing. The Welshman also netted twice in the 2-2 draw. Ballon d'Or winner Luka Modric is also struggling with a groin injury, but the good news is that Eden Hazard could finally make his competitive debut following his summer move from Chelsea. The Belgian, signed for 100 million euros ($110 million), has not yet played in La Liga due to a thigh injury. 8 - Barcelona have endured a slow start to the season with a defeat away at Athletic Bilbao and then a draw at Osasuna in their last outing. However they have won their last eight home games in La Liga, although the last team to take anything from the Camp Nou was this weekend's opponents Valencia, in a 2-2 draw in February. 7 - With the Champions League about to begin, Spain's four representatives -- Barcelona, Real, Atletico Madrid and Valencia -- will all play seven matches in a busy next three weeks. 33,000 - Real Sociedad president Jokin Aperribay told sports daily Marca the Basque club have sold more than 33,000 season tickets for their newly refurbished stadium which will officially open when Atletico visit San Sebastian on Saturday."

That's normal after everything that happened around Ney, the way in which he left, the way he abandoned us. ""But when you look at the sporting angle, for me Neymar is one of the best players in the world and obviously would improve our chances of getting the results we want."" The summer transfer window saw an on-off soap opera surrounding the 27-year-old's apparent desire to leave PSG, who paid a world record 222 million euros ($264 million at the time) in 2017, with Barcelona and Real Madrid both linked. Ultimately he stayed in the French capital, at least for the time being. ""I am not disappointed,"" said Messi. ""I would have liked it if he had come and been with us but, as I have said, we have an exceptional squad to challenge for every title, even without him."" Messi denied reports he had used his influence to try and force the Barcelona board to push through the deal. ""Here, it is not me that gives the orders,"" he said. ""We never said that he had to be brought in. We didn't make any demands."" ""I don't know if the club (Barcelona) wanted it to happen. What I do know is that Neymar really wanted it. But I understand it is very difficult to negotiate with PSG.""

""It is worth remembering that Umtiti picked up the injury with the French national side."" The 25-year-old World Cup-winner has yet to play for Barca in La Liga this season, watching from the bench as they dropped five points in their first three games. Umtiti was not originally selected for Didier Deschamps' France squad for the September Euro 2020 qualifiers against Albania and Andorra, but was called up after Manchester City's Aymeric Laporte was ruled out with injury. He now faces a race against time to be fit for Barca's Champions League opener at Borussia Dortmund a week on Tuesday."

""Neymar did everything possible because it was what he wanted,"" Bartomeu told Barca's in-house television channel. ""I think now he has another strategy, another project and this season he will play for PSG."" His former club could not complete a deal to rescue the 27-year-old from his apparent nightmare in Paris, with Neymar so determined to return that sports daily L'Equipe reported he offered to pay 20 million euros ($22 million) from his own pocket towards the fee. It was reported Barca offered several of their players, including Ivan Rakitic and Ousmane Dembele, as makeweights in a possible deal, but Bartomeu said it was not the case. ""Barca had already planned their squad, but the opportunity to sign Neymar was one that came up in the market,"" he said. ""His signing was an extra -- it wasn't planned. ""Barca never offered our players. It was PSG who asked for them in the negotiations. ""The deal didn't go through because the club could not meet PSG's demands."" Since moving to the Parc des Princes, Neymar has appeared in barely half of his club's matches due to suspensions and injuries. Despite scoring 51 goals in 58 games in all competitions, Neymar has failed to inspire PSG to Champions League glory, with the capital club falling in the last 16 to Real Madrid and Manchester United respectively in his two seasons in France. emi-jc/iwd <org>MANCHESTER UNITED</org>"
256,03/09/2019,00:59,Neymar and PSG left to pick up pieces as transfer saga ends,"Neymar's decision to join Paris Saint-Germain in 2017 was motivated by a desire to establish himself as the best player in the world, but a troubled time in the French capital has left the Brazilian at risk of wasting the best years of his career.","The closure of the transfer window has finally brought to an end the lengthy saga surrounding the future of the world's most expensive player, who will stay at PSG having failed to get the move back to Barcelona he craved. His former club could not complete a deal to rescue the 27-year-old from his apparent nightmare in Paris, with Neymar so determined to return that sports daily L'Equipe reported he offered to pay 20 million euros ($22 million) from his own pocket towards the fee. PSG paid 222 million euros ($264 million at the time) for his services, while committing reported wages of 36 million euros a year. Yet he has not done nearly enough at the Parc des Princes in two seasons marred by injuries and interrupted by off-field distractions. In August 2017, the desperation of PSG's Qatari owners to win the Champions League appeared to fit with Neymar's own obsession with emerging from Lionel Messi's shadow and winning the Ballon d'Or. ""I would love for us to meet in two years and see what his value will be compared to today. At least double,"" said PSG president Nasser Al-Khelaifi at the time. However, since moving to the Parc des Princes, Neymar has appeared in barely half of his club's matches. When he has played he has frequently been brilliant, scoring 51 goals in 58 games. He has won back-to-back league titles and one Ligue 1 player of the year award. But the Champions League is what really matters, and when it has really mattered in Europe he has been absent. Foot injuries saw him miss three of the four Champions League knockout matches the club have played since his arrival. Without him, they lost in the last 16 to Real Madrid in 2018 and then to Manchester United this year. After suffering a broken foot for the first time in February 2018, Neymar missed the rest of PSG's season to be ready for the World Cup. Brazil went out in the quarter-finals. In January this year, Neymar fractured the same foot, missing the crunch part of PSG's season during three more months out. He has since missed the Copa America with an ankle injury and was accused of raping a Brazilian woman at a Paris hotel in May -- the case was dismissed in August by a Brazilian judge. Neymar has never learned French and has often appeared too busy with off-field distractions, including throwing lavish birthday parties and making a cameo appearance in his favourite Netflix series. He remains one of the biggest sporting celebrities on the planet, but he must put the last few months behind him quickly and deliver, otherwise there may well be nobody rich enough who is willing to take a chance on buying him next year. PSG supporters have made clear their unhappiness towards Neymar, yet those feelings can still change if he brings success on the pitch. In the boardroom, there is also the realisation of his commercial value -- when Neymar arrived, Al-Khelaifi spoke of ""a project of two brands: we're associating the Neymar brand and the PSG brand."" They have since signed major sponsorship and endorsement deals with the likes of Nike, with Neymar's presence alongside Kylian Mbappe playing a major role. ""PSG are a young club who need a big media profile to help them develop. That is what Neymar has brought, just like Zlatan (Ibrahimovic) or (David) Beckham before him,"" French sports marketing specialist Jerome Neveu told AFP. Ending the Neymar experiment might have allowed PSG to start afresh, although Mbappe and coach Thomas Tuchel had stated their wish that he stays. ""I like Neymar, I want to keep playing with him, with Kylian and with everyone,"" said Tuchel recently. Now all eyes will be on Neymar to see if he can put this episode to bed, although his three-game Champions League suspension means it may be some time yet before he makes any genuine impact."

Barca have also extended Rafinha's contract to prevent the Brazilian being able to leave on a free next summer. ""FC Barcelona and the Rafinha player have reached an agreement for the renewal of his contract until the end of the 2020/21 season,"" Barca said in a statement. ""Likewise, FC Barcelona and Celta have reached an agreement for the transfer of the player for the 2019/20 season."" Celta will pay Rafinha's contract and could owe Barcelona a further 1.5 million euros in potential add-ons. Brought through at Barcelona with his brother Thiago Alcantara, who is at Bayern Munich, Rafinha's career has been interrupted by serious knee injuries in 2015, 2017 and 2018. He has also struggled for minutes under Ernesto Valverde and looked set for another season on the fringes, behind the likes of Lionel Messi, Luis Suarez, Antoine Griezmann and Ousmane Dembele. Celta called it a ""particularly exciting return"" and said Rafinha, who grew up in Vigo, would add ""enormous quality, versatility, commitment and enthusiasm""."

259,31/08/2019,19:20,Barça pegged back despite Fati heroics,Ansu Fati became the third youngest player to score in La Liga on Saturday but the 16-year-old could not rescue Barcelona from being held to a 2-2 draw away at newly-promoted Osasuna.,"Fati equalised five minutes after coming on at half-time and Barca looked likely to complete the comeback when Arthur Melo, also on a substitute, made it two 13 minutes later at El Sadar Stadium. Yet Roberto Torres, who had given Osasuna an early lead, delivered a twist by scoring a late second from the penalty spot after Gerard Pique handballed. As Barcelona refuse to give up on their pursuit of Neymar before the transfer window closes on Monday, this was another reminder of the talent that already exists in their ranks. Coach Ernesto Valverde appears ready to look to the future rather than the past, with Carles Perez, a 21-year-old product of La Masia, also providing two assists on his second consecutive start. He should even have scored the winner but the concern will be that Barca needed Fati and Perez at all, even taking into account the injuries to Lionel Messi, Luis Suarez and Ousmane Dembele. Antoine Griezmann put on a statement display in the win over Real Betis last weekend but he was quiet again here and it remains to be seen whether the club's president Josep Maria Bartomeu feels negotiations for Neymar should now be pushed over the line. Guillermo Amor, Barcelona's director of institutional relations, told Movistar on Saturday the deal is not dead. ""The market closes soon but we still have a few days,"" said Amor. ""Nothing is done and we are waiting to see what can happen. Of course, something can happen at the last minute. We are calm."" Roberto Torres also came through the ranks at Osasuna and has more than 200 appearances for the club. His double means they are unbeaten from their first three games, having returned to the top flight for the first time since 2017. Both teams stood for a minute's silence before kick-off in a show of support for Luis Enrique, Barcelona's former coach and player, whose daughter Xana died aged nine last week. Barca's fans then chanted his name when the silence ended. Barcelona started badly and got worse in the second half, the opening 45 minutes strewn with misplaced passes and lacking a single chance for the visitors. Osasuna also forced the issue, pressing hard and showing more bite than Barca, with Brandon and Roberto Torres causing a raft of problems for the Barca back line. Their goal came from Brandon, who twisted and turned down the right to leave Clement Lenglet on the floor. He sent a cross to the back post where Nelson Semedo got caught and Roberto Torres smashed home. Barcelona never found their rhythm and it might have been Sergi Roberto putting a simple pass out of play that persuaded Valverde to make a half-time change. Fati came on for Semedo, with Sergi dropping into right back. The goal came from that side too as Perez crossed and Fati rose high, hung in the air and powered a header inside the post. Transformed, Arthur came on for Rafinha two minutes later and within a minute, Barca scored again. Perez provided the assist, freeing Arthur who used Jordi Alba's overlapping run to cut inside and curl into the far corner. The hard work looked done but Osasuna rallied. Juan Villar tested Marc-Andre ter Stegen and with nine minutes left, Pique handballed, allowing Roberto Torres to slide in the penalty for his second of the game. Perez might have won it for Barcelona in the 88th minute. He had only Osasuna's Ruben to beat but was caught in two minds and the chance was gone."
260,29/08/2019,18:52,Neymar takes part in PSG training amid reports of Barcelona deal,Neymar took part in training for Paris Saint-Germain on Thursday afternoon but will again not play for the French champions this weekend amid reports that an agreement had been reached that would see the Brazilian return to Barcelona.,"The world's most expensive player was the last to take to the training field in a session attended by a large contingent of journalists and broadcast live on PSG's own television channel. However, PSG coach Thomas Tuchel confirmed later at a press conference that the Brazilian would not play against Metz in Ligue 1 on Friday. ""Neymar is not with the squad because it is the same situation as before Toulouse (last week's game). Nothing has changed,"" said Tuchel, who also has Kylian Mbappe and Edinson Cavani out injured just now. Earlier on Thursday, Italian broadcaster Sky Sport claimed PSG had finally agreed to sell Neymar back to Barcelona, two years after signing him for 222 million euros ($264 million at the time). Meanwhile, Catalan radio station RAC1 reported that Barcelona president Josep Maria Bartomeu was in Monaco -- where the Champions League group stage draw was due to take place on Thursday evening -- and would take part in negotiations with PSG. Neymar, scorer of 51 goals in 58 appearances in his two years at PSG, has not featured at all for his current club this season amid the uncertainty surrounding his future."
261,28/08/2019,19:18,Neymar waits as PSG mull latest Barcelona offer,Neymar trained with his Paris Saint-Germain teammates on Wednesday as reports in France and Spain indicated a protracted deal to take him back to his old club Barcelona may still be reached before the transfer deadline.,"The transfer window closes on Monday, September 2, leaving Barcelona in a race against time to come to an agreement with PSG that would allow the Brazilian to get his desired transfer back to the Camp Nou. French sports daily L'Equipe reported that, after previous failed attempts, Barcelona had made a new offer of 160 million euros ($177.3m), paid in two instalments, which could convince PSG to finally sell, provided at least one player is thrown in as a makeweight. According to Le Parisien, Barcelona are willing to pay a slightly lower fee, between 140 and 150 million euros, while also offering Croatian midfielder Ivan Rakitic as well as allowing Ousmane Dembele to return to France on loan. However, the agent of 22-year-old French World Cup-winning winger Dembele insisted his client was not interested in being used as bait in a deal for Neymar. ""Ousmane is 100 percent staying. There is no chance of him leaving. He wants to establish himself at Barca and he will,"" Moussa Sissoko told French television station TF1. Dembele has endured an injury-hit two years at the Camp Nou since being signed by Barcelona for an initial 105 million euros from Borussia Dortmund immediately after Neymar's world record 222 million-euro switch to PSG. In Catalonia, radio station RAC1 has reported that Barcelona have taken out a loan in order to have the funds needed to pay for Neymar's transfer, having already spent 120 million euros in the close season to sign Antoine Griezmann from Atletico Madrid. Wednesday's reports from both sides of the Pyrenees came after Barcelona director Javier Bordas had raised hopes in Catalonia on Tuesday night as he spoke to reporters after returning from a meeting with PSG counterparts. ""We are continuing negotiations, we are closer to a deal,"" he said. Meanwhile, a move to Real Madrid now seems increasingly unlikely for Neymar, who took part in PSG's training session ahead of the French champions' next league game at Metz on Friday. The 27-year-old, scorer of 51 goals in 58 appearances in his two years at PSG, has not featured for his current club this season amid the uncertainty surrounding his future. On Tuesday, the player revealed one of his dreams had come true as he made a cameo appearance in his favourite Netflix show. Neymar appeared in the crime drama La Casa de Papel (Money Heist) having originally been edited out pending the outcome of his rape case. Once Brazilian police dropped their investigation last month, Netflix re-released the episodes to include the 27-year-old. ""I was able to fulfil my dream and be part of my favourite series. And now I can share Joao (his character) with you all,"" he told his 44 million Twitter followers."
262,24/08/2019,20:02,Tuchel and Valverde tight-lipped over Neymar future,"Paris Saint-Germain coach Thomas Tuchel said Neymar is ""ready"" for Sunday's Ligue 1 game but whether he plays depends on developments in the Brazilian's bid to leave the club.","Barcelona coach Ernesto Valverde, meanwhile, claimed on Saturday that he is in the dark over any fresh bid for the 27-year-old. Neymar is angling for a return to Spain but reports this week suggest PSG have rejected an offer from Real Madrid of 100 million euros ($111 million) plus players. Neymar arrived amid deafening fanfare from Barcelona two years ago as the world's most expensive player in a 222 million euros deal. Barca's own attempt to bring him back to the Camp Nou on loan with an obligation to buy for 160 million euros at the end of the season has also been reportedly rejected in Paris. Tuchel toyed with reporters on Saturday when asked if his wantaway forward would figure for the first time since injuring his ankle at the end of May. ""He can play (against Toulouse) if the situation between him and the club is clear.....today it's not clear, perhaps tomorrow it will be,"" he said. Pressed, the German added that Neymar was ""ready to play"" but that the final decision rested with the club's sporting director. ""Perhaps you have to speak to Leonardo,"" he suggested. ""Neymar's had a good week (training) with all the squad, a week with a lot of work and intensity."" The transfer window closes in France, Spain and Italy on September 2, meaning time is fast running out for a deal to be done. Valverde remained tight-lipped when asked again about Neymar in a Barcelona press conference on Saturday. ""There are certain players like Neymar that create a lot of interest,"" Valverde said. ""I don't know anything about it, we'll see what happens. First of all, he is a PSG player and we have to worry more about tomorrow's game than anything else."""

""If he is not 100 per cent, I think he won't play,"" said Valverde in a press conference on Saturday. ""We have to wait for training, I can't predict anything. I don't know if we can count on him, or not, or to what extent."" Valverde will be particularly eager to have Messi back after Barcelona's 1-0 opening defeat to Athletic Bilbao in La Liga last weekend, during which both Luis Suarez and Ousmane Dembele were injured. It leaves Griezmann as the only fully-fit striker for the game at home to Betis but the Frenchman was quiet against Bilbao, struggling to make an impact on his first competitive start for the club. ""He is settling in more and more every day,"" Valverde said. ""What we want is for him to be involved a lot in the game. We know if he is involved, if he is busy and gets on the ball, he can be decisive. ""The other day against Athletic at San Mames, he was not as involved as we would have liked but it is also up to us to help him, to allow our strikers to participate more. ""We have to make our possession more productive, we have to work hard to bring them into play because we know they can be dangerous. It is the same for Antoine."" Dembele and Suarez are not expected back until after the international break after they picked up hamstring and calf injuries respectively. Valverde also refused to comment on reports that Dembele skipped club medical tests last weekend to spend time in France. ""I don't want to talk too much about the Dembele thing,"" Valverde said. ""People always make a lot out of things to do with him so I am not going to comment."""

265,23/08/2019,02:30,Troubled Barcelona look to Messi for inspiration,Lionel Messi could be ready to play against Real Betis on Sunday and Barcelona could do with him back.,"In other circumstances, Messi might have left it another week, having missed the whole of pre-season with a calf injury he sustained in his first training session back. But after re-joining his team-mates on Wednesday, the temptation will be to put Messi straight to work, to lift the mood and minimise the chances of what would be a disastrous second slip in La Liga. One defeat, by Athletic Bilbao inside a bouncing San Mames on the opening night and inflicted by a freakishly brilliant bicycle kick in the 89th minute, might ordinarily have been accepted as a blip. ""San Mames is always a difficult place to play,"" said Gerard Pique. ""When you're not at your best, they make you look stupid."" Yet memories of Barcelona's capitulation in May remain fresh. The humiliation in the Champions League and submission in the final of the Copa del Rey mean this team and, in particular, their coach begin the season very much on the back foot. Ernesto Valverde is never far from blame, suspicion about his style and suitability always bubbling under the surface, despite the fact he is hoping to become the first Barca coach since Pep Guardiola to win three La Liga titles in a row. When Messi tweaked his calf, it was assumed an attacking roster of Luis Suarez, Antoine Griezmann and Ousmane Dembele would cope. Instead, Suarez and Dembele both picked up strains against Bilbao while Griezmann delivered the sort of hesitant display to suggest he may also need time to adapt. ""This league is hard,"" Griezmann said. ""We have to bounce back."" Another muscle injury for Dembele, his fifth in two years at Barcelona, is a concern, especially after the 22-year-old reportedly took time off in France instead of undergoing medical tests. It all means Messi's return carries added urgency, even if it remains more likely the Argentinian will come off the bench at Camp Nou than be named in the starting line-up. The lure of Neymar also grows, even if Barcelona are yet to agree a deal with Paris Saint-Germain. The prospect of Real Madrid jumping in too, surely plays on the mind of president Josep Maria Bartomeu. Coming into the season, it was Madrid with the darker clouds hanging over them after a poor pre-season left some wondering whether Zinedine Zidane, more than Valverde, would soon be feeling the heat. Instead, a retro-looking side, without a single summer signing, and with Gareth Bale, opened up last weekend with an assertive 3-1 win away at Celta Vigo. ""We had difficulties in pre-season with our results but not our work,"" Zidane said. ""It was essential to start this way, by playing well and winning."" Bale was excellent and with Eden Hazard not expected back until after the international break, the Welshman should continue his reintegration against Real Valladolid on Saturday. ""We have to turn over a new leaf,"" said Sergio Ramos. ""We can't regret or celebrate what's happened before. We start from scratch."" Atletico Madrid made a winning start too, at home to Getafe, even if a slightly nervy 1-0 win felt rather familiar, despite a handful of attacking signings this summer, including the hugely talented Joao Felix. Still, Getafe were arguably the toughest opponent to break down last season. Atletico might have more joy on Saturday away at Leganes. Fixtures (all times GMT)"
266,21/08/2019,19:57,"Messi back in training, in contention to face Betis",Lionel Messi gave Barcelona a timely boost on Wednesday by returning to training with the rest of the squad after a calf injury.,"Messi trained alone in the morning before joining his team-mates in the afternoon, increasing hopes that Barca's captain could play a role against Real Betis in La Liga on Sunday. He strained his calf on August 5 in his first training session back following the Copa America and subsequently missed the club's pre-season. It would be a surprise if Messi started at Camp Nou, but Barcelona coach Ernesto Valverde will be eager to have his star available again, particularly after his team suffered a surprise 1-0 defeat by Athletic Bilbao in their opening league game last weekend. Messi's absence has been compounded by injuries to other strikers. Luis Suarez is expected to be out for around a month after hobbling off with a calf problem against Bilbao. Ousmane Dembele injured his hamstring and will need five weeks to recover. Antoine Griezmann, the 120 million summer signing from Atletico Madrid, is the only fully-fit forward, with Rafinha and 21-year-old Carles Perez possible options to play behind him. The shortage up front has intensified speculation that Paris Saint-Germain's Neymar could return to Barcelona before the transfer window closes in Spain on September 2. PSG sporting director Leonardo admitted earlier this month that the club were in ""advanced negotiations"" to sell Neymar but a deal is yet to be agreed with Barca, who have already spent around 250 million euros this summer."

The Argentina star has already been ruled out of the team's trip to Florida for a one-off friendly against Napoli in Miami on Wednesday.

""Messi will remain in Barcelona and will now not travel to the USA for the club's tour. His availability to come back to action will be dictated by his recovery from the injury."" Messi, who was at the Camp Nou on Sunday for the squad presentation ahead of the match against Arsenal, said he was sorry to be missing the Florida trip. ""I wanted to be with the team and with the people who follow us in the US,"" said Messi. ""This time it will not be possible but we will meet again soon. I kiss you all.""

Barca are aiming for European glory this campaign after suffering Champions League humiliations against Roma and Liverpool the last two seasons. Before the match captain Lionel Messi addressed those defeats -- which saw Barca throw away comfortable first-leg leads before being dumped out -- in a speech to the crowd.

The La Liga champions added that they retain ""an interest in case of a future sale of the Brazilian"", while Zenit said that they were ""delighted to welcome Malcom"" to the Russian Premier League outfit. The 22-year-old, who is yet to play for the senior Brazil side, leaves after just one season in Catalonia, during which he played 24 times in all competitions and scored four goals.

The 21-year-old, a product of Barcelona's academy, played a one-two inside the box and nutmegged the goalkeeper for his first goal, and fired a stunning left-footer for his second in the dying minutes. Iniesta had his chances and 28,000 fans sighed their frustration as he put a fierce shot just wide. ""It was my first goal for Barcelona and I'm glad to score even two,"" Perez said. ""It's been my dream to score goals for this great team since my childhood,"" he added. Iniesta said: ""I am glad Barcelona were able to come here and play. It was a good game honestly as we played well."" The World Cup-winner, who lifted 32 major trophies with Barcelona, signed for Kobe last May in a deal worth a reported $30 million a year. Iniesta, 34, became team captain in April. Kobe also announced the signing of Belgium defender Thomas Vermaelen, after the 33-year-old reportedly turned down an offer to join countryman Vincent Kompany at Anderlecht. Saturday's win wrapped up Barcelona's pre-season friendlies in Japan following their 2-1 loss to Chelsea earlier this week.

Vermaelen, who is reported to have turned down an offer to join Vincent Kompany at Anderlecht, passed his medical and visited the club's training complex. ""I'm very excited to be here to help the team, to improve the team,"" he told a news conference in Kobe, western Japan, ahead of a friendly between Bercelona and Vissel Kobe. ""I will do all my best to make this team better and I will show you that I will give my everything for this club,"" he said. Vermaelen said he planned to share his experience at Barcelona with the Japanese club, saying: ""I try to bring the complete package into this team."" Vermaelen began his career at Ajax before moving on to Arsenal and Barcelona with a loan spell at Roma. He has played 74 times for Belgium, most recently in the 3-0 Euro qualifier win against Scotland in June. Vissel Kobe are currently 15th in the 18-team J-league."
272,26/07/2019,15:22,Iniesta ready for face-off against ex-team Barcelona,"Barcelona legend Andres Iniesta is looking forward to taking on his former teammates when his Vissel Kobe meets Barcelona this weekend for a friendly, saying Friday the face-off will be ""an honour.""","The match Saturday in the Japanese city of Kobe will be a reunion of sorts, with Barcelona's current line-up facing ex-teammates Iniesta, David Villa and Sergi Samper, all now Vissel players. It will be the first time Iniesta has met his former team on the pitch. ""We all feel that it is such an honour to play Barca,"" Iniesta told reporters through a Japanese translator. ""The team, Barcelona, is special... It will be a very important match for us,"" he said. World Cup-winning Iniesta, who lifted 32 major trophies with Barcelona, signed for Kobe last May in a historic J-League deal worth a reported $30 million a year. The 34-year-old was appointed the team's captain in April. The friendly is Barca's last match in Japan before they head home, and midfielder Sergio Busquets said the chance to meet Iniesta on the pitch ""means a lot"" to the players. ""Now he is in Japan and having new experiences. But it does not change the fact that he is a very important friend still,"" Busquets said. ""Now I am giving him these kind words, but tomorrow on the pitch I won't be able to be like this. We will fight with full strength."" The match comes after Chelsea defeated Barcelona 2-1 in their friendly in Saitama north of Tokyo earlier this week in a game that saw the unofficial debuts of World Cup-winning French striker Antoine Griezmann and former Ajax midfielder Frenkie de Jong. Manager Ernesto Valverde said he wanted to see the new arrivals getting used to playing with the team and hoped for a better result for Saturday's match. ""I'm sure you saw the game the other day, in which they both played. I want them to play better than that with other players,"" he said. Defender Gerard Pique will not play on Saturday as a precaution due to discomfort in his left thigh, Valverde said. Iniesta's signing was viewed as a timely boost to the J-League, which once attracted luminaries such as Brazilian great Zico and former England striker Gary Lineker when it began in 1993 but has struggled to tempt marquee players in recent years."

Simons refused a contract worth 200,000 euros ($222,000) a year from Barcelona, a huge amount for a prospect from the club's training centre La Masia, according to Spanish newspaper Mundo Deportivo. He also walked away from a chance to be quickly integrated into Barcelona's youth team, the newspaper reported. The Dutch starlet, known for his long, curly hair, had earlier announced to his 1.7 million social media followers that he was quitting Barcelona, without saying where he was heading. The young player, whose agent is the influential Mino Raiola -- the agent of players such as Paul Pogba and Matthijs De Ligt among others -- joins a club desperate for European honours after years of heartache. Simons is expected to debut for the French champions in their youth team which plays in Youth Champions, a junior version of the Champions League."

Griezmann, a Barcelona target, had already said he would not turn up, Madrid sports daily Marca reported on Saturday, with Atletico then telling AFP that ""it changes nothing"". ""He us under contract with our club until 2023 and must resume training tomorrow like all the other players,"" they added. On Sunday evening, the club tweeted pictures of players arriving at Los Angeles de San Rafael where Atletico traditionally hold their pre-season training, including recent record signing Joao Felix, a teenage Portuguese striker. Griezmann announced in May that he would be leaving Atletico but could not reveal his destination until his release clause dropped from 200 million euros ($225 million) to 120 million euros on July 1. On Friday, Atletico accused Barcelona and Griezmann of a ""lack of respect"" after the Catalan giants' president Josep Maria Bartomeu revealed that the two clubs had held talks about the France international. Atletico confirmed that they had held a meeting on Thursday, at Barca's behest, to discuss a deal for World Cup winner Griezmann at the lower price. They also said Griezmann had told them he struck a deal with Barcelona in March. Griezmann joined Atletico from Real Sociedad in 2014 and has scored 133 goals in 257 appearances."

Barcelona announced the signing of De Jong in January for a 75-million-euro ($84.3 million) fee on a five-year deal which started on July 1. ""Of course I was thinking about other clubs which were interested, but it's a normal process,"" he said. ""I considered my options, which was best for me, Barcelona came to see me, they convinced me... ""The decision was easy for me. They said they had every confidence in me, that they thought I would be a key player for Barca in the future."" Reigning Spanish champions Barcelona have been looking to strengthen after a humiliating Champions League semi-final loss to Liverpool, and president Josep Maria Bartomeu also said on Friday they had held talks with Atletico Madrid over a possible signing of French forward Antoine Griezmann. De Jong thinks that playing with the best players in the world, like five-time Ballon d'Or winner Lionel Messi, will help him improve. ""Of course, he (Messi) is the best,"" he said. ""I'm very happy to play with him and I'm also looking forward to playing with the whole team. ""All the players here are really talented, not just Messi."" He joins a long list of Dutch players to sign for Barcelona, initiated by Johan Cruyff's moves there, also from Ajax, as a player in 1973, and as a coach in 1988. ""The Netherlands and Barcelona have always had a connection,"" De Jong added. ""It's about playing in a similar way with the philosophy of Ajax and of Barca, which for me is obviously great."" De Jong was a mainstay of the Ajax side last term, scoring three goals in 52 appearances, while also breaking into Ronald Koeman's Netherlands team and winning nine international caps."
276,05/07/2019,18:27,Barcelona hold talks with Atletico over Griezmann signing,"Barcelona have held talks with Atletico Madrid over the potential signing of forward Antoine Griezmann, the Catalan giants' president Josep Maria Bartomeu revealed on Friday.","French star Griezmann, who has long been linked with a move to Barcelona but last year opted to stay in the Spanish capital, has a release clause of 120 million euros ($134.6 million) in his contract. But Barcelona want to sign the 28-year-old World Cup winner without activating the clause. ""Yesterday (Thursday), we had a meeting,"" said Bartomeu. ""Oscar Grau, our general manager, met with Miguel Angel Gil (Atletico's general manager) in Madrid and we began to ask him if it was possible that this (scenario) can happen. ""There is an interest, that's why we got together."" Griezmann signed for Atletico from Real Sociedad in 2014 and has since scored 133 goals in 257 appearances for Diego Simeone's men. He has also netted 29 times in 70 international games for France, winning the 2018 World Cup and claiming the Golden Boot at Euro 2016 as 'Les Bleus' lost in the final on home soil to Portugal. Barcelona won their second straight La Liga title last season but are looking to reinforce their squad after failing again in their bid for a first Champions League triumph since 2015 -- suffering a humiliating loss to Liverpool in the semi-finals having won the first leg 3-0 at the Camp Nou."
277,03/07/2019,16:23,Ex-Barcelona president Rosell cleared on appeal,"Spain's National Court has cleared former FC Barcelona president Sandro Rosell of money laundering, it announced Wednesday, after prosecutors appealed a first acquittal in April.","Rosell, who spent 21 months in jail pending his trial, had been accused of ""large-scale money laundering"" of close to 20 million euros ($23 million) relating to television rights and sponsorship deals in Brazil. In April, the Madrid-based National Court, which deals with major financial cases, acquitted the 55-year-old of the charge, as well as his wife and four other people who had been on the bench too. It said that ""after evaluating the evidence presented during the trial, the accusations were not proven"", prompting prosecutors to appeal. On Wednesday, the court said its appeals chamber had confirmed the first acquittal. The Rosells had been accused of hiding money illegally obtained by Ricardo Teixeira, the former head of the Brazilian Football Confederation, for television rights to Brazil friendly matches. Rosell had previously lived and worked in Brazil, where he forged business links. He had also been suspected of having received money illicitly as part of Nike's sponsorship deal with the Brazilian team. Rosell was Barcelona president from 2010 to 2014, when he resigned over murky transfer dealings that brought Brazilian striker Neymar to the club from Santos."
278,01/07/2019,12:56,La Liga president Tebas fears Neymar return would damage image of the league,La Liga president Javier Tebas has said he would rather Neymar does not return to La Liga if he cannot improve his behaviour.,"Neymar left Barcelona to join Paris Saint-Germain for a world record fee of 222 million euros in August 2017, but could make a surprise move back to Camp Nou this summer. ""In my opinion if Neymar behaves better, he can be a great player,"" Tebas told Spanish radio station Onda Cero late Sunday. ""But I think behaviour and the values that we set as a competition are also very important. I prefer another type of player. ""Neymar is a great player, but if the example off the pitch is not correct, then to be honest I'd prefer him not to come to the Spanish league."" Neymar has denied allegations he raped a woman in Paris and last month attempted to prove his innocence by making public what he claims is an exchange of messages between them. Spain's tax authorities are also investigating Neymar over a bonus he earned at Barcelona and the transfer fee paid to him by PSG, while he remains in dispute with Barca regarding a loyalty payment of 26 million euros. On the pitch, Neymar will miss the first three games of next season's Champions League for insulting match officials following PSG's defeat to Manchester United. And PSG president Nasser al-Khelaifi insisted last month he will not tolerate any more ""superstar behaviour"", comments some took to be directed at the 27-year-old. ""The more great players you have, the better it is for the competition,"" Tebas added. ""In the case of Neymar, my opinion is that the behaviour off the pitch does not seem very appropriate, nor is it very good for the competition. ""The news is always about whether the player has done this or that. We have worked a lot in this league to represent the right values and we don't want to change that image."" Neymar spent four years at Barcelona between 2013 and 2017, winning the Champions League and two La Liga titles. He scored 68 goals in four seasons at the club."
279,01/07/2019,08:33,Barcelona midfielder Denis Suarez returns to Celta,"Barcelona midfielder Denis Suarez has agreed to move back to his boyhood club Celta Vigo on a four-year deal, the Spanish champions said.","Celta Vigo, based in Spain's northwestern Galicia region, will pay the Catalan giants 12.9 million euros ($14.7 million) plus 3.1 million euros in variables, Barcelona said in a statement late on Sunday. ""Barcelona would like to publicly express its gratitude to Denis Suarez for his commitment and dedication and wish him every bit of luck and success in the future,"" it said. The 25-year-old came through Celta Vigo youth academy before moving to Manchester City aged 17 but he never played a competitive game for the Premier League side. He left the English club for Barcelona in 2013. After a season with Barcelona's reserve team and another year on loan at Sevilla, the former Spain Under-21 international joined Villarreal on a permanent deal. He returned to Barcelona in 2016, this time to the Catalan club's first team but failed to find a regular spot on the starting lineup. Suarez went on loan to Arsenal in January but his second spell in England ended prematurely due to injury."
280,27/06/2019,13:23,"Neymar wants Barcelona return, says club's vice-president","Brazilian superstar Neymar wants to return to Barcelona two years after quitting the club to join Paris Saint-Germain, Barcelona's vice-president said Thursday.","""What is correct, at the current time, what I have read, what I have heard, which seems exact, is that Neymar wants to come back to Barcelona,"" Jordi Cardoner told a press conference at the Camp Nou. But he stressed that Barcelona had made no contact so far with the world's most expensive footballer who joined the French champions for 222 million euros ($252 million). For the moment the club acknowledged Neymar's interest in returning to Barcelona but said there was no recruitment effort on their part to resign him. ""To say that Barça is working on recruiting Neymar, that is something I cannot agree with,"" Cardoner said. ""For the moment all that is happening -- and not only with Neymar -- is that a number of players would like to play for a great club like Barcelona. We will see what happens in timely fashion."" ""We are currently working on the phase of deciding which players we will not be keeping on next season,"" said Cardoner. ""We are recruiting no-one at the moment, especially not this player (Neymar) with whom we have had no contact."" However, media reports indicated that intermediaries between PSG and Barca had hammered out the terms of the deal which would free the Brazilian star to return to Barcelona this summer. According to other Spanish media reports this week, Neymar has offered to take a pay cut of 12 million euros a year to return to the club and Barca have reached a 'verbal agreement' to take him back. The 27-year-old spent four years at Camp Nou, winning the Champions League in 2015 and two La Liga titles in a potent attacking trio alongside Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez. Any return for Neymar would likely require Barca to raise funds through sales. Antoine Griezmann is expected to join from Atletico Madrid for 120 million euros while Frenkie de Jong has already signed for 75 million euros from Ajax. The pay cut would see Neymar's salary clipped from around 36 million euros at PSG to the 24 million euros he received at Barca prior to his departure in 2017, according to the reports."
281,26/06/2019,11:15,Bayern consider bid for Ousmane Dembele - report,"Bayern Munich will consider a move for Barcelona winger Ousmane Dembele if they fail to sign Leroy Sane from Manchester City, Bild newspaper reported on Wednesday.","With veteran wingers Arjen Robben and Franck Ribery leaving the club, Bayern had targeted Germany international Sane as they look to bolster their attack ahead of next season. ""If the Sane transfer fails, Bayern also have Ousmane Dembele on their list,"" wrote Bild. France international Dembele, 22, was linked to Bayern before joining Borussia Dortmund from Rennes for 15 million euros ($17m) in 2016. A year later, he became the most expensive outgoing or incoming transfer in Bundesliga history when Dortmund sold him to Barcelona for 125 million euros. With his current contract set to expire in 2022, questions remain over whether Bayern could afford to sign the French international. Bayern broke their own transfer record with the 80-million-euro signing of French defender Lucas Hernandez earlier this year, as they look to rejuvenate their squad in what club president Uli Hoeness has called ""the biggest investment programme in our history"". Yet their recruitment drive has stalled in recent weeks, with Hoeness openly admitting that first-choice target Sane may prove to be too expensive. The Bayern president also insisted last month that the club would not break the 100-million-euro mark for a single player this year."
282,10/05/2019,11:44,Suarez to miss Copa del Rey final,"Luis Suarez will be out for four to six weeks after undergoing surgery on a knee injury, Barcelona announced on Friday.","Suarez will miss the Copa del Rey final against Valencia on May 25 and also faces a fight to be fit for the Copa America in Brazil next month. Uruguay's first game is against Ecuador on June 16, just over five weeks after Suarez had the operation on Thursday. ""Suarez was subjected last night to an arthroscopy on the right knee due to an internal meniscal injury,"" read a club statement released on Friday. ""His approximate time out will be between four and six weeks."" Suarez has a better chance of playing in Uruguay's second and third group games, against Japan on June 20, and defending champions Chile on June 24. But his absence from the cup final in Seville is a major blow to Barcelona, who can secure their second domestic double in as many years by beating Valencia. Suarez will also miss Barca's final two La Liga games at home to Getafe on Sunday and away to Eibar the following weekend. The striker played the full 90 minutes of Tuesday's shock 4-0 defeat to Liverpool, which ended the club's hopes of reaching the Champions League final. Suarez has scored 21 goals in La Liga this season, fewer only than Lionel Messi, and 27 in all competitions."
283,09/05/2019,23:42,Suarez undergoes surgery for knee injury,Barcelona striker Luis Suarez underwent surgery on a knee injury on Thursday and could be a doubt for their Copa del Rey final against Valencia later this month.,"Suarez played the full 90 minutes of Barca's shock 4-0 defeat to Liverpool on Tuesday, which ended their hopes of reaching the Champions League final. But the club announced on Thursday that Suarez needed an operation, with the cup final just over a fortnight away on May 25. ""Luis Suarez has an internal meniscal injury to the right knee and will be subjected today to an arthroscopy,"" read a club statement. Suarez is unlikely to face Getafe at home in La Liga on Sunday before Barcelona play away to Eibar the following weekend in their last league game of the season. Ernesto Valverde's side have already been crowned champions and could seal consecutive domestic doubles by beating Valencia, even it is unlikely to make amends for the collapse against Liverpool."
284,08/05/2019,12:16,Liverpool's never-say-die spirit leaves Klopp's men on brink of glory,Liverpool's incredible Champions League triumph against Barcelona gives Jurgen Klopp's men the chance to end a season to savour as kings of Europe for a sixth time.,"Even fortress Anfield has arguably never seen a night like it. The Spanish champions were thrashed 4-0 on Tuesday despite holding a 3-0 lead after the first leg of the semi-final, and the absence of two of Liverpool's biggest weapons in Mohamed Salah and Roberto Firmino through injury. Salah, ruled out by concussion suffered in a bruising 3-2 win at Newcastle on Saturday that kept Liverpool in the Premier League title race, set the tone for an unforgettable night by arriving at Anfield wearing a T-shirt emblazoned with the slogan ""Never Give Up"". That message sums up a sensational season for the Reds, who are on course to post the third-highest points tally in Premier League history but look like losing out to relentless defending champions Manchester City. ""I said to the boys before the game: 'I don't think it is possible but because of you I think it is possible' because they are really mentality giants,"" said Klopp. Redemption for Liverpool and Salah now awaits in Madrid on June 1 against Ajax or Tottenham a year on from losing the final in Kiev to Real Madrid after an early shoulder injury forced the Egyptian off. ""When we were in Kiev it was not brilliant and then the plan was to go to Madrid and get it in there finally, and now we go there in three weeks' time,"" added Klopp. ""Last year we felt we have to go back, we cannot let it stand like this. Now we get another chance and we will go for it. I am not sure it will happen again, it is so special."" Heroic European comebacks form part of Liverpool's DNA. The last time they lifted the Champions League in 2005, AC Milan thought the trophy was won with a 3-0 half-time lead. Now Lionel Messi can be added to the list of those to have felt the power of Anfield. Messi's double towards the end of the first leg appeared to have turned the tie decisively in Barca's favour. However, he was well marshalled in the return leg, while Liverpool had their revenge on Luis Suarez and Philippe Coutinho, who both left Merseyside for sunnier climes in Catalonia. Instead, it was the unlikely duo of Divock Origi and Georginio Wijnaldum, who had scored just one Champions League goal between them in their careers before Tuesday, who both scored twice. ""It presents an opportunity for some of the other lads to come in, make a name for themselves and make themselves heroes,"" said Trent Alexander-Arnold on the eve of the game, when it was confirmed Salah and Firmino would be absent. ""If we do overturn the deficit tomorrow then whoever scores, their name will always be remembered because I am sure it will be one of those really special nights."" Origi and Wijnaldum wrote their names in Anfield folklore while Alexander-Arnold himself, Liverpool born and bred, ensured at just 20 he too will always be remembered. His quick-thinking caught a team of experienced Champions League winners completely cold 11 minutes from time with a corner that picked out Origi unmarked to fire into the top corner. ""A genius moment,"" said a proud Klopp. ""I saw the ball flying in the net and I had no clue who took the corner or who scored -- it was too quick for me. Now I saw it back, (it is) incredibly smart how two players connected in the moment."" Players and fans connected for the full 95 minutes, much as they have all season. ""This club is a big heart and tonight the heart was pounding like crazy, you could hear it and feel it all over the world,"" added Klopp. Now 10 months of hard work requires just one final big effort to be rewarded with a sixth European Cup."
285,08/05/2019,10:45,Another Champions League 'disaster' leaves Valverde future in doubt,"Barcelona and Lionel Messi walked out at Anfield as probables for a Champions League, Cup and Liga treble but walked off with coach Ernesto Valverde possibly facing the sack.","Shortly after their 4-0 capitulation on Tuesday which sent Liverpool through to the Champions League final on the back one of the competition's greatest ever comebacks, Barca president Josep Bartomeu dodged guaranteeing the future of his coach Ernesto Valverde. ""We are all very emotional now because of the elimination,"" said Bartomeu. ""We have to raise our spirits because there is a Copa del Rey final to come. There will be difficult days for everyone but we have to lift our heads."" Another Cup final to erase the disappointment of another failure in the Champions League except, just like last year, even a domestic double will not come close. It was supposed to be the season Barcelona laid to rest the ghost of the Stadio Olimpico, where they inexplicably conceded three in Rome, one year after they let in three in Turin, two years after they were stunned in Madrid. Three consecutive quarter-final defeats, all away from home. This was one stage further and Liverpool were more capable than Roma, Juventus or Atletico but Barca's latest loss was the worst of them all. ""We ask for forgiveness because even after Rome, it happened again,"" said Sergio Busquets. They had won La Liga on April 27, with three games to spare, when Bartomeu said: ""Our target is the treble"". If it felt like the president was denying his team the chance to celebrate, it was because La Liga, which Barcelona have now won eight times in 11 years, is no longer enough. ""Making the extraordinary normal,"" it said on the players' victory t-shirts. To be extraordinary, Barca had to deliver in Europe where, unlike in Spain, their record diminishes their impact on this era which, for many, at least in terms of style and talent, is tinted in red and blue. This has been Messi's era too, but not in the Champions League, where he owns four titles, one fewer than Cristiano Ronaldo and equal to most of the squad of Real Madrid. Some of Barcelona's players joked their captain had cranked up the pressure when he pledged in August to bring ""that beautiful cup"" back to Camp Nou. But the expectation, and the armband, seemed to bring the best out of Messi, 12 goals his second best ever return in the tournament and only a couple short of his highest tally in 2012. His last two left Liverpool three down and surely out, even if the score flattered Barca and overlooked what had been their fiercest opponent all season. It should have been enough. Valverde had rested all 11 of his first-leg starters against Celta Vigo on Saturday just as Liverpool, with seven of the same 11, were churning out a win over Newcastle. Liverpool should have been exhausted, without two of their first-choice forwards, Mohamed Salah and Roberto Firmino, both injured. Barca should have been prepared too, their memories of the past three seasons painful enough to prevent complacency and recent enough to harden their resolve against the inevitable onslaught of Anfield. Instead, they crumbled, unable to find that stubbornness that has carried Madrid, a less coherent team, to success again and again in the Champions League. ""I do not know how it's going to affect me,"" Valverde said. ""But here we are, the coach has to take responsibility."" There will be calls for change, particularly from those fans who have never been convinced by Valverde, suspicious of his more pragmatic tendencies and, perhaps, underwhelmed by his placid approach. Valverde signed a new contract in February, albeit only until 2020, and, out of Europe, he boasts a record that is almost faultless. If he was to leave in the summer, he could depart having won consecutive doubles, lost two games in the Champions League and only four in La Liga, with half of those coming after the title was already secured. This season, Barcelona have been brilliant, sitting nine points ahead of Atletico Madrid and 15 clear of Real, who they were 17 better than last year too. ""No way,"" said Luis Suarez, when asked if the coach was to blame. ""The players are the ones who were on the field. If his approach was good in the first leg, it was good again now."" But the Champions League was the one they wanted, and the objective was the treble. ""There will be time to reflect,"" said Bartomeu. ""For the second year in a row, it's a disastrous night."""

Stand-in striker Divock Origi and substitute Georginio Wijnaldum both scored twice as Klopp was forced to cope without injured star attacking duo Mohamed Salah and Roberto Firmino. ""Do not adjust your reality. This really is happening. There have been glorious, entirely improbable games in Liverpool's European history, including the mind-bending highs of Istanbul,"" said the Guardian. ""But this was something else, an effort of will that, frankly, took the breath away. On a rapturous night Liverpool's season of chasing to the end narrowed first to a fine point, then burst into the most extravagant life as a 1-0 half-time lead against Barcelona became two, then three, then four. ""With 79 minutes gone, the most celebrated team of the modern age had been reduced to bunch of mooching, stumbling yellow-shirted spectators."" Liverpool have gone toe-to-toe with Manchester City all season in one of the most gripping Premier League title races ever but look like falling just short of winning their first English top-flight title since 1990. Now they have the chance to overshadow City's achievement and be crowned kings of Europe for a sixth time in Madrid next month. For the Daily Mail's Martin Samuel, it was better even that Liverpool's comeback in Istanbul from 3-0 down against AC Milan to win the Champions League final in 2005. ""At the end of this wonderful, unbelievable, fantastical game, Jurgen Klopp linked arms with his players, facing The Kop as the whole of Anfield, including some among the bereft Catalan enclave, sung 'You'll Never Walk Alone',"" he said. ""One had the feeling this was the moment he had been working towards since the day he set foot on Merseyside. This spirit. This togetherness. This performance. This passion, this emotion: it was all here, every last drop of what he wanted to achieve. And yet, there is still such a long way to go."" The Telegraph said Liverpool's success could be written in the stars. ""No team does this in the second leg of a Champions League semi-final without wondering if the hand of destiny is not ushering them down an alternative path to glory to the one they have chased all season. ""On Monday night, Manchester City edged the Premier League just a little further from Liverpool's grasp which felt monumental -- and then came Tuesday night when the response at Anfield was, quite frankly, stupendous."" And the Independent said Liverpool had produced a night of pure fantasy. ""When the curtain comes down on this season, and for many years to come, Liverpool fans will bond over the belief and the disbelief of this night. ""'The Barcelona game', they'll say, and that'll be all they need to say. A night when Anfield heaved with the heft of the impossible, when a crowd of thousands and an audience of millions lost itself in the mad, dangerous intoxication of football."""

However, Origi -- making a rare start -- and substitute Wijnaldum both netted twice as Barca for the second season in succession surrendered a three-goal first-leg lead to exit the Champions League. ""With any other team I wouldn't think it was possible. They are really mentality giants,"" Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp said. ""It is unbelievable the season we had, the games we had, the injuries we had now. ""Going out there and putting in a performance like this on the pitch is unbelievable. I am really proud to be the manager of this team. ""What they did tonight was really special. I will remember it forever."" Liverpool will face either Dutch side Ajax or Premier League rivals Tottenham in the final on June 1 in Madrid and will likely be favourites to be crowned European champions for the sixth time. The Reds' stunning victory brought back memories of when they last lifted the trophy in 2005 when they overturned a 3-0 half-time deficit in the final against AC Milan in Istanbul. However, Klopp underlined the importance of his side writing their own history even if their bid for a first Premier League title for 29 years falls short behind Manchester City this weekend. ""We believed in this chance, we didn't compare it with Istanbul or whatever,"" added Klopp. ""We want to create our own history. We need new chapters obviously and the boys did it."" Despite the despondency of losing Salah and Firmino, Klopp's men never lost faith and were accompanied by a typically raucous Anfield atmosphere for a European night. Origi would almost certainly not have started had Salah and Firmino been fit. But the 24-year-old Belgian has made a habit of scoring important goals in Liverpool's title challenge and had his first ever in the Champions League on seven minutes on the rebound after Marc-Andre ter Stegen had denied Jordan Henderson's initial effort. ""We know this club is the mix of atmosphere, emotion, desire and football quality. You cut off one and it doesn't work, we know that,"" Klopp said. ""This club has a big heart. The heart was pounding like crazy, you could hear it and feel it all over the world. I am so happy we could give the people this experience."" Barcelona boss Ernesto Valverdewas left to face up to the second major European embarrassment of his time in charge. The Spanish champions blew a 4-1 first-leg lead to bow out at the quarter-finals against Roma last year. ""The most hurtful thing is to repeat it,"" said Valverde, who may struggle to hold on to his job despite guiding Barca to two La Liga titles. ""When you have a collapse of this nature we will have a few horrible days ahead."" His side were left to rue not taking their chances in the first half after weathering Liverpool's early burst. Lionel Messi had seemingly turned the tie in the Catalans' favour late in the first leg with a brilliant free-kick and his first effort was tipped over by Alisson Becker before the Brazilian denied his international teammate Philippe Coutinho. Liverpool were seemingly dealt another injury blow as Andy Robertson was withdrawn at half-time, but he made way for Dutch international Wijnaldum with James Milner moving to left-back. Wijnaldum's impact was massive. He was picked out by Trent Alexander-Arnold's low cross and drilled under Ter Stegen. And from Liverpool's next attack, Xherdan Shaqiri picked out Wijnaldum to head home at the Kop end. ""Once again we showed that everything is possible in football,"" said Wijnaldum. ""I was really angry at the manager that he put me on the bench but I had to do something to help the team when I came on."" Valverde tried to restore some order as Coutinho, who cost £142 million ($186 million) when moving from Liverpool to Barcelona in January 2018, was replaced for the second time in the tie. The change briefly had an impact, but Barca were inexplicably caught cold from a quick Alexander-Arnold corner 11 minutes from time that picked out Origi completely unmarked to fire high past Ter Stegen. ""A genius moment,"" Klopp of Alexander-Arnold's quick thinking. ""I saw the ball flying in the net and had no idea who took the corner and who scored the goal."""

""If we do overturn the deficit tomorrow then whoever scores, their name will always be remembered because I am sure it will be one of those really special nights."" Salah was stretchered off during Liverpool's tense 3-2 win at Newcastle on Saturday that kept alive their chances of a first Premier League title in 29 years after colliding with Magpies' goalkeeper Martin Dubravka. ""It's a concussion so that means he would not even be allowed to play,"" Klopp said on Monday. ""He feels OK but it is not good enough from a medical point of view that is all. He's desperate (to play) but we cannot do it."" Klopp, speaking before Manchester City ensured they remain in the driving seat for the Premier League title by beating Leicester 1-0 on Monday, was realistic about his side's chances of progressing to a second consecutive Champions League final. But the German refused to give up hope. ""Together with our supporters it was a long season and there is at least a little chance to make it even longer,"" Klopp added. ""Two of the world's best strikers are not available tomorrow night and we have to score four goals against Barcelona to go through after 90 minutes. ""It doesn't make life easier, but as long as we have 11 players on the pitch, we will try it."" Luis Suarez scored the opening goal against his former club in last week's first leg at the Camp Nou, but ahead of his return to Anfield, the Uruguayan warned his current teammates of the lift playing on home soil will give Liverpool. ""To play at Anfield is like playing with an extra man for what the fans transmit to the Liverpool players,"" said Suarez. And Barcelona coach Ernesto Valverde believes attack will be the best form of defence as if the Catalans get an away goal, Liverpool will need to score five. ""What we have to do is score,"" said Valverde. Suarez will be joined by Lionel Messi and Philippe Coutinho on his return to Anfield after a £142 million ($186.5 million) move to Barca from Liverpool last year. But the often-injured Ousmane Dembele is absent for the visitors due to a hamstring problem and Valverde believes the Frenchman's absence will be felt just as much as Salah and Firmino. ""We don't want any player to be injured. It would have been extraordinary to see them all on the field. They are all important,"" he said. ""Dembele's absence is a problem. Against a team that concedes space (in behind) it is always important to have player like Ousmane."""

290,06/05/2019,19:17,Suarez thanks Liverpool for helping him to the top,"Barcelona striker Luis Suarez returns to Anfield on Tuesday hoping to dump Liverpool out of the Champions League semi-finals, but remains eternally grateful to the Reds for helping him win a move to the Catalan giants.","Suarez shone on the field during a turbulent three-and-a-half years at Liverpool, that included long bans for biting Chelsea's Branislav Ivanovic and racially abusing Patrice Evra of Manchester United. His role in leading Liverpool to the brink of a long-awaited Premier League title in 2013/2014 saw Barca splash out a then club record fee despite another biting incident on Italian defender Giorgio Chiellini at the 2014 World Cup that saw him banned by FIFA for four months. That faith has been rewarded as Suarez has enjoyed great success in Spain, winning four La Liga titles, the Champions League in 2014/15 and four Spanish Cups. And he believes his time at Liverpool was the springboard to making him one of the world's best strikers. ""Liverpool gave me a lot to make me better. My time there made me more professional, make me improve technically, many things,"" he said on Monday. ""To be captain of Liverpool was something unique in my career. We were fighting for the Premier League and you are left with the sensation we were just one step away. ""I am among the elite of football, I am at Barcelona, thanks to what Liverpool made me as a player."" Suarez scored the opening goal against his old club as Barca took a commanding 3-0 first leg lead last week to defend at Anfield. However, he warned the Spanish champions of making the same mistakes they did in throwing away a 4-1 lead against Roma in last season's Champions League quarter-finals and knows that Liverpool can be a different team on home soil. ""We have come off the blow of last season when we had a good advantage (from the first leg). We have thought about that a lot and we know that they have an extra edge here in front of their fans. ""To play at Anfield is like playing with an extra man for what the fans transmit to the Liverpool players."" However, if Liverpool are to spring an unlikely comeback, it will be without two of their major goal threats as Mohamed Salah and Roberto Firmino miss out through injury. ""Firmino and Salah are important players for them, but that does not change our preparation for the game,"" added Suarez. ""They have other players, most of them internationals and we need to pay them plenty respect."""
291,06/05/2019,13:34,Concussed Salah out of Champions League clash against Barcelona,"Liverpool will be without top scorer Mohamed Salah for Tuesday's Champions League semi-final, second leg against Barcelona after manager Jurgen Klopp revealed he was concussed in a 3-2 win at Newcastle.","The Egyptian was stretchered off at St James' Park on Saturday due to a head knock sustained as he challenged Newcastle goalkeeper Martin Dubravka for a high ball. ""It's a concussion so that means he would not even be allowed to play. So that's it,"" said Klopp at his pre-match press conference on Monday. ""He feels OK but it is not good enough from a medical point of view that is all. He's desperate (to play) everything but we cannot do it."" Klopp will also be without Brazilian striker Roberto Firmino due to a groin injury as his side face the huge challenge of trying to overturn a 3-0 first leg deficit to make the Champions League final for a second consecutive season. ""Two of the world's best strikers are not available tomorrow night and we have to score four goals against Barcelona to go through after 90 minutes,"" added Klopp. ""It doesn't make life easier, but as long as we have 11 players on the pitch, we will try it."" Liverpool have a rich history of stunning comebacks in European football, most famously lifting the Champions League in 2005 after trailing the final 3-0 to AC Milan at half-time. In Klopp's first season in charge in the quarter-finals of the Europa League in 2016, the Reds also came from 3-1 down in the final 25 minutes to beat his old side Borussia Dortmund 4-3. However, the German coach is aware of the extra difficulty of not just scoring at least three against the Spanish champions, but also not conceding a vital away goal to the likes of Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez that would leave Liverpool needing to score five to progress. ""I imagine the place will be rocking even before we score to be honest, but we not only have to score, we have to deny Barcelona from scoring,"" he added. ""It doesn't happen too often that Barcelona don't score at all. We know how big the challenge is. ""This team is so wonderful we will try 100 percent, but that doesn't mean it will all work out."" While, Liverpool edged a bruising battle with Newcastle to remain in the hunt for a first Premier League title in 29 years, Barcelona boss Ernesto Valverde could afford the luxury of making 11 changes for a 2-0 defeat at Celta Vigo on Saturday having already sealed the La Liga title. And Klopp admitted he could have one eye on Sunday's final league game of the season at home to Wolves with his team selection. ""We have to make a lot of decisions. Tomorrow night will be the third game in six days and Barcelona changed 11 positions on Saturday, so that is a massive difference as well of course,"" he said. ""Together with our supporters it was a long season and there is at least a little chance to make it even longer. ""But if not, these are the last two home games of an incredible season and I think we should celebrate that with a good performance on the pitch and a very, very good performance in the stands."""
292,06/05/2019,02:15,Battered and bruised Liverpool face balancing act against Barcelona,"Liverpool emerged victorious from a bruising battle against Newcastle to remain in the hunt for the Premier League title, but may have sustained too many wounds to summon a Champions League semi-final comeback against Barcelona on Tuesday.","A late double from Lionel Messi in the Camp Nou on Wednesday has left Jurgen Klopp's men with a mountain to climb to overturn a 3-0 first leg defeat if they are to reach a second consecutive Champions League final. Liverpool have overcome such deficits before in the Champions League, most famously in the 2005 final against AC Milan. But hopes of another famous European comeback at fortress Anfield were dealt a blow when Mohamed Salah was stretchered off with a head knock as Liverpool edged out Newcastle 3-2 on Saturday to move two points ahead of Manchester City at the top of the Premier League. Salah watched a thrilling end to the match at St. James' Park in the dressing room as his replacement Divock Origi headed home fellow substitute Xherdan Shaqiri's free-kick four minutes from time. Origi, who also scored a 96th-minute winner to beat Everton in the Merseyside derby in December, Shaqiri and Daniel Sturridge have made important contributions in a supporting role to a club record points tally for Liverpool this season. ""We are always ready to get on the pitch and make a difference,"" said Liverpool left-back Andy Robertson. ""The lads who have been left at home and lads who are on the bench and haven't come on, they are buzzing for us. ""There's no egos in this squad and that's why we are where we are today and long may it continue."" However, with Roberto Firmino already ruled out due to a groin injury, few would give Liverpool any hope of overhauling a three-goal deficit without two of their prolific front three should Salah not start. Klopp therefore has a difficult balancing act deciding whether it is worth emptying the tank of his injury-hit squad once more on Tuesday or to save their legs for Wolves' visit to Anfield on the final day of the Premier League season. ""We are now qualified for the league final, which is brilliant,"" said Klopp at taking the title race to the final game of the season. Despite a sensational season, Liverpool's chances of winning either trophy are fading. To have any hope of a first league title in 29 years, Klopp's men must hope that Manchester City's relentless run of 12 straight league wins comes to an end either at home to Leicester in their game in hand on Monday, or at Brighton come Sunday. Barcelona will also not be complacent heading to Anfield a year on from letting a 4-1 first leg lead against Roma slip away in the quarter-finals. Messi made it clear from before the season began that the Champions League was his and Barca's primary target in his first campaign as club captain. Moreover, while Liverpool toiled on Tyneside on Saturday night, Barca coach Ernesto Valverde had the luxury of making 11 changes for an inconsequential 2-0 defeat to Celta Vigo having already wrapped up the Spanish title. Yet, Origi's winner at Newcastle personified Liverpool's persistence and refusal to give up. Four times in their last seven league outings Liverpool have won the game in the final 10 minutes. Now they must harness the same belief if Barca are to be given a fright at Anfield. ""If we do fall short this season we will be back next season and we just need to keep going and keep going, and hopefully get what this club deserves,"" added Robertson. ""First of all Tuesday, a hell of a task, but if we can get a wee bit of luck then hopefully we will progress."""
293,06/05/2019,02:10,Valverde warns Barcelona to be wary of history at Anfield,Ernesto Valverde wanted to keep Barcelona's feet on the ground after their 3-0 win over Liverpool so he hit his players where it hurt.,"""Liverpool are a team that can make any opponent suffer,"" he said in the press conference after the match. ""And of course last year we had a three-goal advantage in the quarter-finals. And we were knocked out."" Valverde knows that loss to Roma still rankles with his players, barely a week passing without one of them referencing the game that defined their season last year and could yet shape this one too. The tie looked over after a 4-1 thrashing at Camp Nou only for a 3-0 loss in Rome to complete one of the great Champions League comebacks and send the Italians into the semis. That Real Madrid went on to win the tournament for a fourth time in five years rubbed salt into the wound. ""It is a thorn in our side,"" said Luis Suarez in September. But it was not just that Barca had fallen short, for a third consecutive year. It was the way they had thrown it away. ""We feel like there is this scar,"" Clement Lenglet told AFP Sport in February. ""This match did us some harm. We want to erase that and have a beautiful season to forget it. We want to soothe the scar."" Thirteen months on, Liverpool will hope the doubt that lingers and, perhaps, the pressure to make amends can help them pull off what would surely be the club's most remarkable turnaround since the 2005 final in Istanbul. ""We have no reason to be complacent,"" Valverde said. ""The result is good, I have no doubt about that, but the tie is still open."" Liverpool are stronger than Roma were. They have scored three or more goals 19 times this season, against opponents like Paris Saint-Germain, Manchester United, Arsenal and Porto. An early goal at Anfield on Tuesday and belief would surge. But Barcelona are stronger too and another collapse, even against a team as dangerous as Liverpool, would be an even greater surprise. When Roma left the first leg with a three-goal deficit, few could have predicted what would come next. But Barcelona had been stuttering for weeks, flattered by positive results that masked underwhelming performances. Valverde's team are more convincing this season, almost faultless since February with 14 wins in 17 games, the two draws and a single defeat coming only after key players were rested. Rotation means they are fresher too. Suarez has said he regrets playing three days before Roma against Leganes, as Valverde exhausted his team in pursuit of an unbeaten season in La Liga. This year, Lionel Messi played just over half of the minutes he could have in April while against Celta on Saturday, Valverde rested all 11 players that started the first leg against Liverpool. ""We have the advantage of being champions already,"" Valverde said. ""Of course we will try to use it."" Perhaps most importantly, last year's failure in the Champions League is what motivates Barcelona now more than ever. Messi stood on the pitch at the start of the season and pledged to bring that ""beautiful cup back to Camp Nou"". He has played like a man on a mission ever since, with 12 goals in this season's competition already, two short of his best ever return in 2012. Messi's late double leaves Liverpool with a mountain to climb. ""The truth is we had a chance at the end and it would have been better to win 4-0 than 3-0,"" Messi said afterwards. ""It is a very good result but we are going to a very difficult stadium, with a lot of history, and that put you under a lot of pressure. We know it's not over."""
294,05/05/2019,14:04,Dembele doubt for Liverpool after Barca confirm hamstring injury,"Barcelona have confirmed Ousmane Dembele sustained a hamstring injury in their defeat to Celta Vigo on Saturday, with the Frenchman unlikely to recover in time to face Liverpool in the Champions League on Tuesday.","Dembele was taken off in the sixth minute against Celta as a much-changed Barca side were beaten 2-0 in La Liga. ""The tests performed this Sunday have confirmed that the French player of the first team has a muscular injury in the femoral biceps of the right thigh,"" Barca said in a statement on Sunday. ""The player is out and his recovery will decide his availability."" Ernesto Valverde rested all 11 players that started in Barcelona's 3-0 win over Liverpool in the first leg of the semi-final last week, but the injury to Dembele is a blow. The Frenchman would have been in contention to start at Anfield, perhaps instead of Philippe Coutinho, who was whistled during the first leg at Camp Nou when substituted in the second half. Valverde will hope to have Dembele back for the Copa del Rey final against Valencia on May 25 in Seville, as well as a potential Champions League final on June 1 in Madrid. Dembele missed almost four months with a hamstring strain last season and suffered from problems in the same area in January and March, sitting out for another month each time. ""We think it's a muscle tear,"" said Valverde after the match on Saturday. ""It is not from fatigue - he didn't play much against Liverpool - and it is not the same leg as last time. It's just one of those things."""
295,05/05/2019,00:11,"Klopp to 'wait and see' on Salah head injury, Firmino to miss Barca clash",Liverpool's Mohamed Salah was stretchered off with a head knock during the 3-2 win at Newcastle on Saturday leaving manager Jurgen Klopp sweating on the Egyptian's fitness ahead of Tuesday's Champions League clash with Barcelona.,"And Klopp will definitely be without another of his prolific attacking trident with Roberto Firmino ruled out due to a groin injury. Liverpool face a monumental task to overturn a 3-0 first leg deficit against Barca if they are to reach the Champions League final for the second consecutive season. Salah was caught by Newcastle goalkeeper Martin Dubravka as they challenged for an aerial ball 20 minutes from time at St. James' Park. ""We'll have to see. He took a blow to the head. He watched the game in the locker room, he was OK, but we have to do more tests,"" Klopp told Sky Sports. Firmino was not involved on Saturday and Klopp confirmed he will miss Barca's visit. ""He will not be ready for Tuesday and the rest we will see,"" said the German on the possibility Firmino could be fit for Liverpool's final league game of the season against Wolves on May 12. Salah had earlier scored his 26th goal of the season to put Liverpool 2-1 in front, before Salomon Rondon levelled early in the second-half to make it 2-2. Divock Origi then headed Liverpool's late winner as the Reds went back to the top of the Premier League."
296,04/05/2019,23:11,Under-strength Barca beaten by Celta,Barcelona rested all 11 players that started against Liverpool in the Champions League but paid the price on Saturday as they were beaten 2-0 by struggling Celta Vigo in La Liga.,"Lionel Messi, Luis Suarez and Philippe Coutinho were all among those left out ahead of the return at Anfield on Tuesday but Barca were not unscathed, after Ousmane Dembele hobbled off early in the first half. The club later confirmed Dembele sustained a hamstring injury and will undergo tests on Sunday but it seems unlikely the Frenchman will be fit to face Liverpool in the semi-final second leg. Dembele missed almost four months with a hamstring strain last season and suffered from problems in the same area in January and March, sitting out for another month each time. Defeat will hardly trouble Barcelona, who wrapped up their 26th La Liga title last weekend, but victory comes as a major boost for Celta, who move five points clear of the bottom three with two games left to play. Real Valladolid and Girona, both just beneath them, may feel disappointed by Ernesto Valverde's team selection, particularly given his side took six and four points off them respectively this season. The result also means Rayo Vallecano are relegated after they were thrashed 4-1 by Levante earlier on Saturday. Rayo needed Celta, the only team they could catch, to lose all three of their remaining matches. Barcelona will now quickly turn their attention back to Liverpool, who at the same time on Saturday were playing Newcastle in the Premier League, making only four changes to their own line-up from the side that lost 3-0 at Camp Nou on Wednesday. Liverpool won 3-2 but Mohamed Salah was stretchered off in the second half. Barca's changes created the strange spectacle of Celta giving a guard of honour to youngsters like Jean-Clair Todibo, Carles Alena, Moussa Wague and Riqui Puig before kick-off. Dembele lasted only six minutes and was replaced by Alex Collado, the 20-year-old midfielder thrown on for his first-team debut. Puig was perhaps the most impressive of the fledglings and he teed up Barca's best chance in the first half but Wague's shot was well saved by Ruben Blanco. Celta came on strong in the second 45 and thought they had taken the lead when Gustavo Cabral's header was palmed out by Jasper Cillessen to Nesto Araujo, who finished. Araujo was shown by VAR to have been a fraction offside. But Celta did not have long to wait. In the 67th minute, with Todibo off injured, Barca were briefly down to 10 and Maxi capitalised, brilliantly volleying in Ryad Boudebouz's cross in at the near post. There was still time for one more in the 88th minute as VAR spotted a handball by Wague in the area and Aspas converted to confirm a crucial win. Atletico Madrid had earlier missed the chance to ensure they finish above Real Madrid for a second consecutive year after they slipped to a surprise 3-0 defeat by Espanyol. Atletico needed only a point to guarantee second place in La Liga, with two games left to play, but Espanyol were deserving winners at the RCDE Stadium thanks to Diego Godin's own-goal and two strikes from Borja Iglesias, the second a penalty. ""The first goal changed the game, the second one made us worse,"" said Atleti coach Diego Simeone. ""Espanyol were deserving winners. They were better and they had more chances,"" he added. Real Madrid face Villarreal on Sunday but a third-place finish seems inevitable. To overtake their city rivals, Real will need to win all three of their remaining games and hope Atletico lose both of their last two."
297,02/05/2019,12:24,Liverpool have no time to lick wounds after Barcelona defeat,Liverpool have no time to fret over their chastening Champions League defeat at the hands of Barcelona as they scramble to prevent their season from fizzling out without any silverware to show for it.,"After the hammer blow of two late Lionel Messi goals at the Camp Nou, which gave Barcelona a 3-0 win in the first leg of the semi-final, Jurgen Klopp's men must raise themselves for the challenge of Newcastle in the Premier League on Saturday. Despite already posting a club record points tally of 91 with two games remaining, a Liverpool defeat would give Manchester City the chance to retain the title at home to Leicester on Monday. ""They don't have to think about the next game against Barcelona, now we play Newcastle,"" said Klopp after Wednesday's defeat in Spain. ""That's all our focus. We go to the hotel, have a proper sleep, get up in the morning, fly home and then prepare for Newcastle. ""Whatever happens, these boys, I couldn't be more proud of them."" There was plenty for Klopp to be proud about in Catalonia despite a first defeat in 20 games. Liverpool had more possession and shots on goal as they pressed and penned the Spanish champions back, particularly after Luis Suarez had come back to haunt his former club with the opening goal in the 26th minute. ""I can work really well with this game. I will use this game to show the boys what is possible,"" added Klopp. ""It was brave performance that was very passionate, very lively and in a lot of moments creative and direct. ""There will be a moment when I can convince the boys again how important this game was for us for our development because I really think it was the best away game we played in the Champions League. That's a very important message for us, not for the world outside."" However, while Sadio Mane and Mohamed Salah missed huge chances, the magic of Messi swung the tie heavily in Barca's favour. If Messi's first goal 15 minutes from time was opportunistic, his second was out of this world. The Argentine's 600th goal for Barcelona was fired into the top corner with unerring accuracy from a long-range free-kick. ""In these moments he's unstoppable,"" admitted Klopp. A second leg at fortress Anfield is still to come, but ending a 29-year wait to win the Premier League was always Liverpool's primary target for the season. Now into his fourth season in charge, Klopp has still to win a trophy with Liverpool. But if his maturing side were denied by individual brilliance in Barcelona, it is the collective class of City, led by former Barca boss Pep Guardiola, that looks likely to deny them a much-desired title. For the seventh game in a row, Liverpool would go back on top with a victory over Newcastle, led by their former manager Rafael Benitez. However, with City on a 12-game Premier League winning run, Liverpool still need the champions to slip up either at home to Leicester or away at Brighton on the final day of the season to stand a chance of winning the title. ""I think mentally, we shouldn't be affected,"" said Liverpool defender and Professional Footballers' Association player of the year Virgil van Dijk. ""I won't be. It was a tough game but we have a big game at the weekend and we are still in the race. We want the same performance without conceding the goals."""
298,02/05/2019,03:29,Klopp hails 'unstoppable' Messi after Barca star shines in CL semi,"Jurgen Klopp admitted Lionel Messi was ""unstoppable"" on Wednesday after he left Liverpool needing a miracle to reach the Champions League final.","Luis Suarez poked in against his former club before Messi hit a late double, the second a stunning free-kick for his 600th Barca goal, as his team took a 3-0 lead from a pulsating semi-final first leg ahead of next week's return at Anfield. ""He's unstoppable,"" said Klopp afterwards. ""Obviously we couldn't defend the free-kick. What a strike. He's a world-class player but I knew that already. It's no surprise."" Klopp could only smile after Messi's curling shot nestled in the top corner but this result was harsh on his side. They matched Barcelona in the first half, dominated them early in the second and could still have left with an away goal after Messi's brilliant brace, only for Mohamed Salah to hit the post. ""I said to the boys I was proud of how we played against a side like this,"" Klopp said. ""If you lose away it's not a massive problem as long as you score a goal. That's our problem tonight - it doesn't make our life any easier."" Messi and Suarez did what they have done all season, their tallies now at 47 and 27 goals respectively in all competitions. It had been a breathtaking contest befitting two of Europe's most exhilarating teams. The first half was electric, a reel of chances, breaks and blocks, while the second was tense, a tactical battle where Barca dared Liverpool to over-exert. The comeback will be even tougher for them given Barcelona, with La Liga wrapped up, will surely rest a host of players against Celta Vigo this weekend while Liverpool, a point behind Premier League leaders Manchester City, will have to be at full throttle again away at Newcastle on Saturday. ""They can still make us suffer,"" said Barca coach Ernesto Valverde. ""The result is good but the tie is open."" Messi was already fresh, after playing just over half the La Liga minutes he could have done in April, and he looked sharp early on, weaving through the centre while for Liverpool, the sensational Sadio Mane raced down the left. The attacks were scintillating but the defending was good too. Andy Robertson scrambled across to block Messi's finish from six yards and moments later it was Sergi Roberto on the slide, preventing Mane from sprinting clear. Messi wanted a penalty when the ball jumped up on Joel Matip and Naby Keita went off injured in the 25th minute, replaced by Jordan Henderson. A minute later came the goal. Arturo Vidal sprayed the ball left to Philippe Coutinho, who cushioned back for Jordi Alba. Alba shaped to cross but instead curved a perfectly weighted pass to the near post, where Suarez nipped in. Liverpool came again. Mane scampered in behind then flicked the ball round Sergio Busquets. He should have scored too, Henderson's cross finding him free from eight yards but the shot flew over. Barca took control just as Suarez began to lose it, irked by James Milner barging Messi into the sideboards after the Argentinian had danced past Robertson. But Liverpool were re-energised at the start of the second half. Marc-Andre ter Stegen pushed away shots from Milner and Salah, and held a Milner drive. Then Messi intervened, striking twice in seven minutes. His own run started the first, setting Sergi free to square to Suarez. Off balance, Suarez could only knee the ball against the crossbar but it came back for Messi, who chested and finished into an open net. Two was tough on Liverpool but Messi was not done. The free-kick was central, 30 yards out. He whipped it over the wall and into the top corner. Barca were delirious but Liverpool almost grabbed an away goal when a clearance on the line fell kindly for Salah, who hammered against the post. It could have been a lifeline. Liverpool are on the brink."
299,30/04/2019,19:01,Messi's motivation spurs on Barcelona,Ivan Rakitic has said Lionel Messi's desire to win the Champions League is proving an inspiration for Barcelona ahead of their Champions League semi-final first leg against Liverpool on Wednesday.,"At the start of the season, Messi stood on his home pitch and pledged to bring ""that beautiful cup back to Camp Nou"" after three consecutive years of Barca crashing out in the quarter-finals. They will host Liverpool this week, four days after celebrating winning La Liga on Saturday, and with a Copa del Rey final to come next month against Valencia. It means a treble is in their sights. ""Whenever our captain says something the rest of us follow,"" said Rakitic at a press conference on Tuesday. ""Leo has been a La Liga champion 10 times in 15 years and of course, after seeing him lift the cup (on Saturday) with such happiness, that motivates everyone. ""If Leo is happy to win every title, it makes us even more eager too. We know we're Barca, we have to give everything and following the best player in history gives us more confidence to do that."" A domestic double last season could not make up for failure in Europe, after a 3-0 defeat by Roma ensured Barcelona were left watching Real Madrid triumph again. ""We want to be in the final but we have to understand the last few years weren't the best for us,"" Rakitic said. ""We have to learn from that."" The pressure is particularly intense for Messi, whose four Champions League titles include only one in the last seven seasons and still fewer than the five of Cristiano Ronaldo. Asked if Messi has to win the Champions League this year, coach Ernesto Valverde said: ""Nobody has to do anything. We embrace the challenge to win but there is no obligation. Every team that starts in September wants to play in games like this."" Liverpool coach Jurgen Klopp has caused a stir by dismissing the idea his players could be intimidated at Camp Nou, which he described as ""just a stadium"". Rakitic believes Barcelona's home advantage is significant. ""I understand he wanted to take a bit of pressure off his players, he wants them to see it as another stadium. All I can say is playing at Camp Nou is a different thing, something special and you have to respect that."" Valverde added: ""Our fans can be decisive. We feel it, our rivals have felt it and we hope it will be the same tomorrow."" Liverpool have lost only once in the Premier League this term and are still fighting with Manchester City to win the title. Mohamed Salah, Sadio Mane and Roberto Firmino already boast 68 goals this season between them. ""We need to stop them running at our defence,"" Rakitic said. ""We are going there to score but we mustn't lose our heads."" ""We know how valuable a clean sheet is but our aim is to win,"" said Valverde. ""We know in these ties one good game is not enough, you need to play two great games. If you switch off for five minutes against Liverpool, they can finish you off."""
300,30/04/2019,18:54,Liverpool upbeat over Firmino's fitness,Liverpool are increasingly confident Roberto Firmino will be fit to face Barcelona at the Camp Nou in Wednesday's first leg of their Champions League semi-final against the La Liga giants.,"The Brazil forward missed Friday's 5-0 Premier League win over Huddersfield with a small muscle tear, but was still included in the 23-man squad selected by coach Jurgen Klopp and took part in team training on Tuesday before flying to Spain later in the day. ""We all knew from the beginning it would be a race,"" Klopp told Liverpool's website when commenting on Firmino's fitness. ""We don't have to make a decision today because there's no game today, we can wait. ""It looked good so far, but I have until tomorrow to make that decision,"" added the German, whose side are also battling Manchester City in a title race that looks destined to go to the wire. Meanwhile Fabinho was passed fit after the midfielder missed the 5-0 thrashing of Huddersfield following a head injury sustained in the previous game against Cardiff. ""Every human being needs time and he needed that time, but if the Huddersfield game had been a day later he could have played,"" Klopp said. Mohamed Salah also appeared to confound rumours of an injury scare by taking a full part in Tuesday's training session."
301,30/04/2019,02:36,Coutinho sale launched Liverpool European elite return,"Liverpool have grown used to seeing their prized assets snatched away by Spanish giants over the past decade, but the sale of Philippe Coutinho to Barcelona has helped lay the foundations for a successful rebuild at Anfield.","Coutinho, who has struggled to match the expectations of his £142 million ($183 million) price tag, will come up against his former team at the Camp Nou on Wednesday as Liverpool travel to Catalonia for the first leg of their Champions League semi-final on the back of a 10-game winning run. Liverpool learned their lesson from the departures of Xabi Alonso and Javier Mascherano to Madrid and Barcelona that quickly dismantled the title-challenging team put together by Rafael Benitez and the devastating effect of losing Luis Suarez to Barca had five years ago. With the Spanish champions desperate for star power when Neymar walked out to join Paris Saint-Germain in August 2017, the Reds hierarchy dug their heels in and drove the price up for the Brazilian. Coutinho finally got his dream move in January 2018, but by that time the centrepiece to the construction that has seen Jurgen Klopp reawake the five-time European champions as a force on the continent had been put in place. Virgil van Dijk's £75 million move from Southampton made the Dutchman the world's most expensive defender ever and was roundly questioned at the time. However, his impact has been so transformational on Liverpool's hitherto leaky backline that he became the first defender in 14 years to be crowned the Premier League players' player of the year on Sunday. ""From the first moment I was so excited about the opportunity to work together and now you are the man,"" said Klopp in his congratulatory message to his talismanic centre-back. Coutinho's five years at Anfield produced plenty of spectacular goals, but he did not win a trophy and Liverpool only even qualified for the Champions League twice in that time. Van Dijk's first five months helped nail down a top-four Premier League finish and a run to last season's Champions League final, which ended in a 3-1 defeat to Real Madrid thanks to two huge errors from goalkeeper Loris Karius. More of the Coutinho money was then spent on recruiting Brazilian number one Alisson Becker from Roma, while Klopp's midfield options were bolstered by the arrival of Fabinho, Naby Keita and Xherdan Shaqiri last summer. Liverpool were also able to tie down the prolific front three of Mohamed Salah, Sadio Mane and Roberto Firmino on long-term contracts to ensure they stay put or command huge fees to leave like Coutinho. That excellent off-field organisation has been rewarded on the pitch by a club record points tally of 91 with two Premier League games of the campaign still to go. Klopp has described delivering a first top-flight title in 29 years as the ""holy grail"", but his side would still need a slip up by relentless defending champions Manchester City to win the league. For all the progress made, the German is yet to win a trophy since arriving at Anfield in October 2015. The pain of missing out on the Premier League once more despite a record-breaking campaign would be eased substantially if there was a Champions League final against Tottenham or Ajax to look forward to on June 1. And beating Barca would carry the extra satisfaction of showing Coutinho how little he has been missed on Merseyside."
302,30/04/2019,02:10,Another chance for Barca's old guard to leave heavier stamp on Europe,It was ten years ago Alex Ferguson dubbed them the best team he had ever faced but those left from Barcelona's iconic generation still have work to do.,"Three remain and when Lionel Messi, Sergio Busquets and Gerard Pique line up against Liverpool on Wednesday, they may wonder if this could be their best chance of another, and perhaps final, Champions League triumph. Pep Guardiola's mesmeric side had just danced around and dizzied Manchester United in 2009, their 2-0 victory completing an historic treble, when Ferguson conceded: ""Nobody has given us a hiding like that."" But not long after the final whistle at Wembley, Ferguson expressed doubts too, about the longevity of that Barca group and then, whether they could ever be replaced. ""Great teams go in cycles and the cycle they're in at the moment is the best in Europe,"" he said. ""How long it lasts and whether they can replace that team...they have the philosophy but it's difficult to say if you can find players like Xavi, (Andres) Iniesta and Messi all the time. Probably not."" Xavi and Iniesta have gone, succeeded by the all-encompassing Ivan Rakitic and, more recently, Arthur Melo, who could mature into the kind of player his predecessors would admire. Messi, who turns 32 in June, Busquets, who will be 31 in July, and Pique, already 32, have hung on, driving the club through fresh cycles of success. But in some ways perhaps, Ferguson was right. They could never sustain the Guardiola method in full, in part because pressing began to neutralise possession but mainly because that group of players was unique. In the Champions League, glory came again quickly in 2011, United again the victims, but from 2012 to 2018, it followed only once more, after beating Juventus in 2015. When Barcelona outplayed United in 2009, they had already won La Liga, the first of eight league titles in 11 years, the last of those confirmed by victory over Levante on Saturday, when Messi scored the winner. ""Our objective now is the treble,"" said president Josep Bartomeu. He knows domestic dominance has been tarnished by underachievement in Europe and, regardless of whether they win another double this term, this team's season will be defined by them beating Liverpool, and then either Tottenham or Ajax on June 1. Messi, Busquets and Pique have played in 34 Champions League semi-finals matches between them and while the likelihood is there will be more to come, nothing is guaranteed. If the next takes as long to arrive as this one, Messi will be almost 36. When Ernesto Valverde took charge at the start of last season, Barcelona were wounded by consecutive Super Cup defeats to Real Madrid. ""For the first time I feel inferior to them,"" said Pique. Now they sit 18 points ahead of them in the league, having finished 17 clear of them last season. But inferiority in Europe still rankles. It is Madrid's name on the cup next to four of the last five years. And for the remnants of one of Barcelona's most symbolic eras, time is running out to put it right. There are green shoots emerging, a new cycle - Arthur, Ousmane Dembele, Clement Lenglet and Carles Alena - coming through. ""I hope I can be part of the new wave,"" Lenglet told AFP Sport in February. ""There is a regeneration of the squad that is preparing for the future and I hope to be a part of that."" Frenkie de Jong could face Barcelona in the final in Madrid, in what would be his last Ajax appearance before joining the Catalans in July. He may not replace Busquets but the 21-year-old will, at the very least, challenge him. Pique has been one of his team's standout players in central defence but there are plans there too. The 19-year-old Jean-Clair Todibo arrived from Toulouse in January and Matthijs de Ligt could follow De Jong from Ajax in the summer. As for Messi, there may never be a successor but four Champions League titles, one fewer than Cristiano Ronaldo, means there is a sense hanging over the club of a record unfinished. In that way, Liverpool could encounter the same problem Manchester United did a decade ago. ""We never got control of Messi,"" Ferguson said. ""But a lot of people will end up saying that."""
303,30/04/2019,02:02,Liverpool's flying full-backs ready for Barca test,"Neither Trent Alexander-Arnold nor Andrew Robertson have Lionel Messi's star power, but the buccaneering Liverpool defenders could play just as vital a role as the Barcelona captain in their mouth-watering Champions League semi-final.","Virgil van Dijk has hogged the spotlight among Liverpool's defenders with a superb campaign that earned the Dutch centre-back the Professional Footballers' Association player of the year award. Ahead of Wednesday's first leg against Messi's Barca, Robertson and Alexander-Arnold have emerged as essential contributors to Liverpool's bid for Champions League glory. With 24 assists between them in all competitions, England right-back Alexander-Arnold and Scotland left-back Robertson are pivotal figures in Jurgen Klopp's game-plan. Robertson's 11 assists have equalled the Premier League record for a defender and Alexander-Arnold is not far behind, with nine, making Liverpool's full-backs are as much wingers as defenders. It has become the most demanding, tactically significant position in the Liverpool team. Without Robertson, 25, doing the job of two players with his lung-bursting runs up and down the flanks, Senegal winger Sadio Mane would not have the freedom to move infield, from where he has scored 24 goals this term. Mohamed Salah's licence to roam from the wing is only possible because there is less need to track back defensively while Alexander-Arnold, 20, tirelessly covers every blade of grass on the right. Klopp's bold system has reaped rich rewards as rivals struggle to find a way to turn off the supply line fuelled by Robertson and Alexander-Arnold. In producing perfectly weighted crosses for Mane's double and a Van Dijk goal, Alexander-Arnold became the youngest Premier League player to create three goals in a single fixture when Liverpool thrashed Watford in February. Then, when Robertson supplied Roberto Firmino with Liverpool's opening goal against Tottenham recently, Alexander-Arnold matched him by crossing for Salah's header that led to Toby Alderweireld's decisive late own goal. They are the kind of key contributions that have become commonplace this season and Robertson admits the pair's friendly rivalry is spurring them to ever greater heights. ""I always try and go forward. Sometimes my passes don't find people. But I do try and create. If I get two assists, I expect Trent to get three,"" Robertson said with a smile. ""We all need to chip in with goals and assists. It's not just the front three. It's not just the defence that keeps clean sheets, either. It's a team game."" Liverpool's unlikely heroes have taken contrasting routes to the top. Liverpool-born Alexander-Arnold is the soft-spoken prodigy who still lived with his mum at the start of this season, such has been the rapid nature of his rise from the club's academy Robertson started his career in obscurity at Queen's Park and Dundee United before joining Liverpool from Hull for £8 million ($10.3 million) in 2017 -- a deal that Klopp says came at a time when ""there weren't 500 clubs asking about him"". Now comes the acid test of the duo against Barcelona in the Camp Nou. Inspired by the sublime Messi, Barca have scored more than 130 goals in all competitions already this term and wrapped up the Spanish title at the weekend. But, while he acknowledges the threat posed by Messi, Luis Suarez and company, Robertson believes Liverpool should stick to their guns. ""We know we'll have our hands full defensively but we all defend as a team and we attack as a team. If me and Trent have time to go forward, we will do it. It's not going to stop us,"" Robertson said. ""We know that we can create goals and chances, so why change that? But look, we will learn from the game and move from that and see how it pans out. ""It's a challenge we all look forward to."""
304,29/04/2019,14:14,Van Dijk not eying Messi's crown as world's best,"Virgil van Dijk was crowned the Premier League's Player of the Year by his peers on Sunday, but the Liverpool defender insists he is not thinking of battling Lionel Messi to win the Ballon d'Or.","Van Dijk will come up against the five-time Ballon d'Or winner when Liverpool travel to Barcelona for the first leg of their Champions League semi-final on Tuesday. Messi has scored 46 goals this season as Barca have wrapped up another La Liga title with three games to spare and remain on course for a treble of league, Copa del Rey and Champions League. ""That's not something that's on my mind at all,"" said Van Dijk at the prospect of rivalling Messi. ""There are currently players walking around in this football world that are out of this world basically and they've been doing it for many years. ""I'm very happy how I perform at the moment, how consistent I'm performing, that I'm fit as well. I think I just need to not look too far ahead."" Liverpool head to the Camp Nou on a run of 10 consecutive wins in all competitions, but have still not been able to usurp Manchester City at the top of the Premier League. Jurgen Klopp's men trail the champions by one point with two games to play and face a tricky trip to Newcastle sandwiched between both legs of their semi-final with Barcelona. ""Right now we're in a tight title race, in the Champions League semi-finals against a fantastic team, where probably the best players are playing so we just take it game by game,"" added Van Dijk. ""For us, now it's time to focus on Barcelona midweek and then we have a big game at Newcastle away as well. ""I won't look too far ahead and the only goals I will set are personal goals with Liverpool."""
305,27/04/2019,23:56,La Liga belongs to Barca again as dominance leaves rivals in turmoil,Barcelona may yet prove they are the best team in Europe but they are indisputably the best in Spain after they wrapped up their fourth La Liga title in five years on Saturday.,"Barca are now nine points clear of Atletico Madrid with three games left to play, while Real Madrid look set to finish a second consecutive season trailing the champions by double figures in terms of points. The failings of Real, who now own the pitiful record of winning the league only once in seven years, are laid bare by the table but a smaller margin flatters Atletico too, masking what has, in truth, been a procession for the best part of four months. ""Our first goal is consistency, being the best every day,"" Ernesto Valverde said in September. At the start of January, Barca's advantage was five points, February six, March seven and April eight. Some then hoped there could be a race when they drew 4-4 at Villarreal but a few days later they had beaten Atletico and that was that. The stuttering form of those beneath them has certainly helped. Even if Barcelona had collapsed, Real were too far behind to capitalise while Atletico, fragile away from home, have never looked capable of the winning run required. ""For us next year, the league must be our number one priority,"" Real coach Zinedine Zidane said on Wednesday. But the faults of the Madrid pair belong to them not Barca, who have now been crowned kings of Spain eight times in 11 years, a period of dominance that was started by the historic treble-team of Pep Guardiola, consolidated under Luis Enrique and now elongated by Valverde. ""What we have done over the last years will go down in history,"" said Sergio Busquets. Valverde may never convince those who take his pragmatism to be a sign of mediocrity and his veering from the iconic style of Guardiola as contrary to the ideals of Barcelona. Winning the Champions League would surely appease the doubters, particularly if it amounted to Valverde's own treble, with a Copa del Rey final against Valencia to come next month in Seville. ""We have to close out the title as soon as possible, without letting go,"" Lionel Messi said. ""Then we can think about Liverpool and the semi-finals."" But the reputation of this Barcelona team, and their coach, is unfairly shaped by what has gone before, not least because most of those players have gone too. Messi, Busquets and Gerard Pique were the only ones present both in 2009 and 2019. Instead, Valverde adapted, by retaining some of the old, attacking verve while adding athleticism, shape and defensive discipline. When he arrived, two Super Cup defeats to Madrid prompted Pique to admit Barca felt inferior. Not now. Madrid, thrashed 5-1, Huesca, hammered 8-2, Sevilla, twice beaten 4-2, Espanyol, Levante and Real Betis, each sent packing 4-0, 5-0 and 4-1 respectively, are all testament to this Barcelona's exhilarating streak. Messi's 34 goals are too. If he can find four more in the three games left, it will be his best La Liga return since his 43 in 2015. His partner, Luis Suarez, has 21 and together, they have scored more than every team in the division except Real Madrid and Sevilla. But it was far from a two-man show. Many times, goalkeeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen came to the rescue while Jordi Alba has scored and assisted more goals than any other defender in the league. Pique has been immense in recent months and alongside him Clement Lenglet has made light of an injury-spoiled year for Samuel Umtiti. Arthur Melo looks a future star in midfield while Ousmane Dembele's early problems with fitness and indiscipline have given way to the scintillating talent that convinced Barca he was worth 105 million euros two years ago. There have been concerns too. Defensively, Barcelona were suspect until Christmas and Busquets, who turns 31 in July, has too often been exposed in midfield. Both issues could yet resurface against Liverpool next week. Philippe Coutinho left Anfield to join the elite but is yet to find his place. The January signings of Jeison Murillo and, in particular, Kevin-Prince Boateng were bizarre. But none of those blips derailed the dominance of Barca. Instead, Real Madrid were persuaded to sack their coach, twice, while Atletico kept theirs but now face an exodus of players in the summer. For both, uncertainty is the result of inferiority. Neither could argue that in 2018/19, Barcelona were not, by a distance, better than the rest."
306,27/04/2019,05:02,Martens eyes Barcelona Champions League double,Barcelona forward Lieke Martens wants the club to make it a Champions League double by winning both the men's and women's tournaments this season as reward for the work they are doing in women's football.,"Barca's female side take a 1-0 lead into their semi-final second leg at home to Bayern Munich on Sunday while the men's team begin their own bid to reach the final against Liverpool next week. ""It would be amazing for the club if both teams win the Champions League,"" Martens told AFP. ""I think that it's so great that a big club like Barcelona is putting so much into women's football, it's what we need. Women's football is getting bigger and bigger and Barcelona really get it."" In a World Cup year, women's football has enjoyed extra prominence in Spain this season after a record crowd of 60,739 turned out to watch Atletico Madrid play Barcelona in March, just over a month after 48,121 watched Athletic Bilbao play Atletico at San Mames. The drive has been for women's teams to become more visible to supporters, a trend that would be enhanced by Barcelona winning the Champions League for the first time this season. ""It will be a tough game against Bayern, we all know that, but it's also a big opportunity,"" said Martens, whose side are also competing with Atletico for the Spanish title. ""I think we are in a good period now, we feel very confident, we've had good results in the last few months and the mood in the squad is great."" Lyon, who lead Chelsea in the other semi-final, are attempting to become European champions for a fourth year in a row, while taking their overall tally to six. Barca, like Bayern, are yet to reach a final. ""We have to stay focused, we can create a surprise,"" Martens said. ""I don't know when this journey is going to end but the priority is to play well and then we will see if we reach the final or not. ""We all know it's going to be a very tough game, that Bayern have a lot of qualities as well. It's going to be a tight game but we believe we have the quality to win."" Martens has cited Ronaldinho as one of her idols growing up and she will be hoping to emulate the Brazilian's international success this summer, as she tries to lead the Netherlands to World Cup glory. The 26-year-old star of the Dutch side that won the European Championship title in 2017 has scored 11 goals in 23 appearances this season and feels she can still improve as she regains form and fitness. ""I feel fine now but at the start of the season I had a lot of injuries so I didn't feel 100 per cent,"" Martens added. ""It's good that I'm getting closer and closer to my best level. I still feel there are some parts of my game that I can do better but I'm always critical of myself. We have important games ahead so I have to keep this form going."""
307,26/04/2019,21:20,Barcelona want La Liga trophy and 'powerful boost' ahead of Liverpool semi,"Clinching La Liga before their Champions League semi-final with Liverpool would give Barcelona a ""very powerful"" boost, coach Ernesto Valverde said on Friday.","The runaway Spanish league leaders are nine points clear with four games to play. They will seal the title if Atletico Madrid lose on Saturday afternoon or if they beat visiting Levante in the evening. If both games are drawn, that would also be enough for Barcelona ahead of Liverpool's first-leg visit on Wednesday. Valverde admitted that he might rotate some players, but, he added, ""we have four days until the Liverpool game and I know that winning tomorrow with what it means to win a title is something very powerful looking ahead to Wednesday's game, much more than any fatigue we may suffer."" The Barcelona coach said that it would be impossible for his players to put the Liverpool game entirely out of their minds when they face struggling Levante. ""You will always have something in your head,"" he said. ""But I want to set that apart, especially because of the importance I give tomorrow's game. We would like it to be the exclamation point on the league."" This would be an eight title in 11 seasons for Barcelona. ""The fact that our club has won so many in this space of time, says a lot about how seriously we take it,"" he said. But it would be the first time since 2011 that Barcelona have clinched the title at home. ""We have the opportunity to win the title, to be able to celebrate it with our fans, and that is an incentive and no one wants to lose."" Traditionally, the Liga champions have had to wait to receive the trophy. This year that might change. Spanish media has reported both that the Spanish Football Federation president Luis Rubiales will be at Camp Nou, ready to make a presentation if Barcelona clinch the title, and that he won't, out of respect to Levante. ""I hope that tomorrow the president of the federation has work to do,"" said Valverde. ""It would be nice. It has never been done in La Liga, that a team receives the trophy when it wins, as happens in other leagues."" ""We give a lot of value to the league title, which is what the 20 teams were all pursuing from the start,"" Valverde said. ""We know that there are other trophies, like the Spanish cup or the Champions League, that depend on specific moments,"" he said. ""In La Liga, on the other hand, you always have to hit the target or miss it only very rarely."""
308,24/04/2019,18:25,Spain court acquits former Barcelona president of money laundering,"A Spanish court on Wednesday acquitted former Barcelona president Sandro Rosell, who spent nearly two years in pre-trial custody, of money laundering.","Rosell, his wife and four others, were accused of ""large-scale money laundering"" of close to 20 million euros ($23 million) since 2006, relating to television rights and sponsorship deals in Brazil. But the National Court, which handles major criminal cases, said it had acquitted all six accused because ""after evaluating the evidence presented during the trial, the accusations were not proven"". ""As such, given the doubts that were raised, the principle of 'in dubio pro reo' must apply,"" said the court, using the Latin for 'when in doubt favour the accused', referring to the presumption of innocence. Prosecutors had initially called for the ex-Barca boss to be jailed for 11 years but during the trial they reduced this request to six years. Rosell was arrested in May 2017 but given conditional release in February 2019 just after the start of his trial. ""It's great news that puts things in their place,"" Rosell's lawyer Pau Molins told reporters after the ruling was issued. ""Sandro Rosell had been killed civilly and socially, we are going to see how we can recover (the reputation) of an innocent person who has spent so much time in prison,"" added Molins, who successfully defended Spain's Princess Cristina when she went on trial in 2016 for tax fraud. Rosell, 55, had previously lived and worked in Brazil, where he forged business links. The Rosells were accused of hiding money illegally obtained by Ricardo Teixeira, the former head of the Brazilian Football Confederation (CBF). The case centres on several contracts signed by Teixeira between 2006 and 2008 by a Saudi company based in the Cayman Islands for the television rights to 24 Brazil friendly matches. A company owned by Rosell played the role of intermediary in the negotiation of these contracts and according to the court pocketed nearly 8.4 million euros. The company also collected a loan of five million euros which was destined for Teixeira. Another company owned by Rosell collected 12 million dollars (10.7 million euros) for his participation in the negotiation of a sponsorship deal signed by sports apparel giant Nike, his former employer, and the CBF. Prosecutors and the police accused these firms of being shell companies used to launder money but the court ruled that ""it could not be ruled out that they had a real activity"". Teixeira has been indicted by US Justice Department prosecutors investigating the FIFA corruption scandal. ""JUSTICE has been done. I hope Sandro can return to his former life,"" La Liga president Javier Tebas tweeted after the news that Rosell had been acquitted broke. Rosell was Barcelona president from 2010 to 2014, when he resigned over murky transfer dealings that brought Brazilian striker Neymar to the club from Santos. He is waiting to be tried in another case for corruption, fraud and tax evasion related to Neymar's transfer to the Catalan giants in 2013, and is also facing another trial for tax evasion."
309,24/04/2019,15:50,La Liga to be Real Madrid's number one priority next season - Zidane,Zinedine Zidane said on Wednesday La Liga will be Real Madrid's top priority next season after they were mathematically ruled out of the title race with five games left.,"Barcelona's victory over Alaves confirmed that Madrid cannot be crowned champions given they sit 16 points behind the Catalans with only 15 still to play for. Despite incredible success in the Champions League, it means Madrid have now won the Spanish title only once in seven years while Barca are on the cusp of securing their fourth in the last five, and eighth in 11. ""For us next year, the league must be our number one priority,"" Zidane said. ""It's the longest competition, it's the one that cannot be missed and I'm going to put that in the heads of my players. ""It will be our bread and butter for sure, without devaluing the rest, because we try to fight on all fronts at this club, but our bread and butter will be La Liga."" Barcelona's 26th league title will be confirmed on Wednesday night if Atletico Madrid are beaten at home to Valencia. If Atletico avoid defeat, Barca can wrap it up with a win at home to Levante on Saturday. ""We have 33 titles,"" Zidane said. ""Barca are doing well, I will admit when a rival is doing well, but in history, Real Madrid has more league titles. ""But they have been doing better lately and we need to change the dynamic."" Madrid are likely to be busy this summer, with Gareth Bale heading a long list of players who could depart while Chelsea's Eden Hazard is among those expected to arrive. ""Even if we always work together with the club, the coach has a say in relation to players and the profiles of players he wants,"" Zidane said. ""There has not been much recruitment during the last two or three years. This year there will certainly be a little more."" Thibaut Courtois has shaken off a thigh injury and is available to face fourth-placed Getafe on Thursday, meaning Zidane must again decide between the Belgian and Keylor Navas. Zidane was loyal to Navas during his first stint in charge and has said again that next season there will be no debate about his first-choice goalkeeper. ""What I would like to do I won't say,"" Zidane said. ""I would like a lot of things but sometimes they are not done, sometimes the opposite even. ""But this is not the time to talk about this today. Thibaut is available and so is Keylor."" Zidane said Vinicius Junior is not yet ready despite returning to training after almost two months out with an ankle ligament injury. ""He won't get any minutes tomorrow, he has to work again,"" Zidane said. ""We have to give him time."" Getafe's remarkable bid for Champions League qualification has them sitting two points ahead of both Valencia and Sevilla. They beat Sevilla 3-0 at home on Sunday."
310,24/04/2019,00:18,Messi rested as win over Alaves edges Barca closer to the title,Barcelona will win La Liga on Wednesday if Atletico Madrid lose to Valencia after a 2-0 victory over Alaves gave them a 12-point lead at the top of the table.,"Lionel Messi started on the bench at Mendizorrotza on Tuesday in a move that made clear just how comfortable Barca are in this title race, its conclusion surely now only a matter of when rather than if. Should Atletico avoid defeat to Valencia at the Wanda Metropolitano, the Catalans will still be crowned champions on Saturday at the Camp Nou with a victory over Levante. They could even have it wrapped up before kick-off on Saturday if Atletico fail to take at least four points from Valencia and Real Valladolid, the latter whom they face a few hours earlier on Saturday. ""It's an incredibly valuable win,"" coach Ernesto Valverde said. ""In the end however much as people say the league is won, it has to be achieved on the field. ""We are at the gates now, needing three points more with four games ahead. It is an immense joy to be in this position after so many months of work."" Real Madrid, who play their game in hand against Getafe on Thursday, sit 16 points adrift in third. Alaves stay eighth, their hopes of a Europa League spot fading fast. Messi came on as a substitute in the 61st minute shortly after his team had scored twice, Carles Alena guiding one into the corner before Luis Suarez, in Messi's absence, took and dispatched a penalty. Valverde leaving out his captain and star player, presumably with an eye on next week's Champions League semi-final against Liverpool, was a luxury Barcelona have earned and can afford. Liverpool, still jostling with Manchester City in the Premier League, are unlikely to feel the same sort of confidence when they face Huddersfield on Friday. ""The idea at half-time was to play Leo because the result was not clear,"" Valverde said. ""But regarding the Golden Boot and that sort of thing, we are only focused on what we have to do to win. ""Leo has a lot of individual challenges ahead but today it was time to rest."" Other players were preserved too. Jordi Alba, Clement Lenglet and Arthur Melo all began on the bench, allowing Samuel Umtiti more minutes as he recovers from a knee injury, while the struggling Philippe Coutinho started in a front three with Ousmane Dembele and Suarez. Alena, the 21-year-old Spaniard, scored his second La Liga goal and showed again why many believe he could be a key figure for Barcelona in the years to come. Suarez's goal, meanwhile, was his 21st in the league and marks the fourth consecutive season in which he has passed the 20 mark for Barca. He might have scored earlier but shot straight at Fernando Pacheco when sent clear in the opening stages, while Coutinho followed up but his rebound was blocked. Sergi Roberto fired over from inside the area but it was his run down the right that created Alena's opener in the 54th minute. After a neat exchange with Arturo Vidal, Sergi played inside, through the legs of Suarez and to the feet of Alena. He controlled and placed the ball coolly into the corner. Six minutes later, and one before the introduction of Messi, Suarez doubled the lead from the spot. Umtiti bundled in on the line and as VAR checked him for offside, Alaves' Tomas Pina was shown to have handballed moments before. Suarez made no mistake. Messi hit the woodwork, his shot well saved by Pacheco, and Coutinho drove wide late on. Two was enough for the win and, possibly, the title."
311,20/04/2019,22:52,Barca on cusp of La Liga triumph after win over Real Sociedad,Barcelona are closing in on their eighth La Liga title in 11 years after Clement Lenglet and Jordi Alba both scored in a 2-1 win over Real Sociedad on Saturday.,"Victory means Barca only have to beat Alaves on Tuesday and then Levante next Saturday to be crowned champions at Camp Nou, while three points against Alaves will be enough on its own if Atletico Madrid then lose to Valencia on Wednesday. Whether in three days or seven, it is now surely only a matter of when rather than if Ernesto Valverde's side successfully defend their trophy, despite Atletico keeping the gap to nine points after they edged past Eibar earlier on Saturday. ""We have to get it out of our heads that we are nine points clear,"" Valverde said. ""We now have three days until we play again and it will be difficult."" Wrapping it up early though would allow Barcelona the luxury of focusing completely on the Champions League, which could give them an advantage over their semi-final opponents Liverpool, who seem to be embroiled in a Premier League race to the finish with Manchester City. But this was no stroll, with Real Sociedad pulling level in the second half thanks to Juanmi's equaliser, even if parity lasted less than two minutes. Lionel Messi might not have scored but it was his cute pass that teed up the excellent Alba to score the winner after Lenglet had earlier powered in a header from Ousmane Dembele's cross. Barcelona stumbled out of the blocks this season but they are now tearing down the home straight. This was their 21st league game without defeat while Real Madrid sit 16 points behind them ahead of their game at home to Athletic Bilbao on Sunday. ""You always look at the matches of Real Madrid because you always consider them a rival,"" Valverde said. ""In their case, they may be thinking about next season."" It was a surprise when Messi failed to score with two free-kicks in the first half while Sociedad could have been in front but Juanmi was denied by Marc-Andre ter Stegen and Willian Jose spurned the rebound. There was nothing complicated about Lenglet's opener, the Frenchman rising high above two defenders and heading into the corner for his first league goal in a Barcelona shirt. Ter Stegen and Alba were fortunate not to be punished for a mix-up and then La Real did score, in the 62nd minute, as Juanmi slid to connect with Mikel Merino's brilliant through ball. But in the 64th minute, Barca were ahead again as Messi weaved one way and then the other before finding Alba to his left. The defender jinked inside and drove a shot into the far corner. Earlier, Atletico Madrid had needed Thomas Lemar to come off the bench and find an 85th-minute winner against Eibar as they stretched their lead over Real Madrid to seven points. Without Antoine Griezmann and Diego Costa, who were both suspended, Diego Simeone's side looked set for a stalemate that would have given Real at least a sniff of second place. Instead Lemar, on as a substitute, tucked in Koke's cross to deliver another timely boost to Atleti's morale, in the same week their star goalkeeper Jan Oblak extended his contract with the club until 2023. Lemar's goal will have done the Frenchman's confidence no harm either, after a difficult debut season following his 60 million-euro move from Monaco last summer. Simeone will expect more next term."
312,19/04/2019,15:47,Barcelona can wait as Klopp eyes Cardiff and Huddersfield,Jurgen Klopp is adamant that their upcoming Premier League matches against Cardiff and Huddersfield are just as important as their mouth-watering Champions League semi-final against Barcelona as they chase down a domestic and European double.,"They will be huge favourites to beat both strugglers Cardiff and already relegated Huddersfield, but Klopp is taking nothing for granted in the Reds' quest to win their first domestic title since 1990 as they tussle with champions Manchester City. ""These are all massive games,"" said Klopp ahead of Sunday's match in Cardiff. ""None of them are won before we start. ""Everybody thinks a lot about Barcelona but before Barcelona it's Cardiff and Huddersfield and it's exactly the same importance to us as the other games."" While Liverpool eased into the last four of the Champions League with a 4-1 win at Porto, City saw their bid for an unprecendented quadruple ended by Tottenham Hotspur after what would have been a decisive goal in stoppage time was ruled out by the video assistant referees. By a bizarre quirk of the fixture list, City play Spurs in the Premier League on Saturday, and Liverpool now turn their attention to a Cardiff side whose bid to remain in English football's top flight was revived by their 2-0 win at Brighton on Tuesday. ""Neil (Warnock) and Cardiff have gained a lot of confidence in the last game and rightly so,"" he said. ""It was a massive game against Brighton, if Cardiff had lost that game then the fight for the league would be finished but now it starts again for all the teams. ""Everything came together and that's what makes football so exciting. They believe in their chances and I would do the same, so we have to show we are ready for this battle."""
313,18/04/2019,14:11,Barcelona against weekend Champions League games - Bartomeu,"FC Barcelona president Josep Maria Bartomeu has spoken out against the idea of staging Champions League games at the weekend, as suggested in a recent proposal to reform the competition.","""Barcelona's position is clear: national league games must be held at the weekend, and Champions League games during the week,"" he said in an interview with German newspaper Sueddeutsche Zeitung on Thursday. Bartomeu did offer broad support for Champions League reform, however, saying that the competition had to develop. The controversial reform plans put forward by the European Club Association (ECA) in March envisaged dramatic changes to the Champions League from 2024, ranging from the introduction a three-tiered system to the scheduling of weekend fixtures. The plans prompted widespread criticism, most notably from the Europe's major domestic leagues, amid fears that they represented the introduction of a European Super League via the back door. Bartomeu, who sits on the executive board of the ECA, said on Thursday that he saw the plans as an ""evolution, not a revolution"". ""There are different ideas,"" he said. ""Right now in 2019, we don't know what (the reforms) will look like."" Yet the 56-year-old claimed that he was ""against Super Leagues"", and insisted that Barcelona would resist weekend fixtures in European competition. ""The Spanish league is very important for us. As a club we need to protect it and ensure that it remains interesting,"" he said. Somewhat surprisingly, Bartomeu also said that he ""liked"" FIFA's plan to expand the Club World Cup to a 24-team competition, which has been met with criticism from the ECA. The Barcelona said that he was in favour of a ""new Club World Cup"", but admitted that there was still ""need for discussions"". ""The clubs and players are the protagonists, so FIFA should listen to them,"" he said. ""We are the ones who take the risk, who invest in the infrastructure. So we need to talk about the calendar, the format and the distribution of income."""
314,17/04/2019,17:13,United condemn racist abuse of Young,Manchester United have condemned racist abuse of their defender Ashley Young on social media in the aftermath of their Champions League elimination at Barcelona.,"Young was targeted on Twitter following United's 3-0 quarter-final second-leg defeat on Tuesday. The foul abuse of Young brought swift condemnation from United, who said in a statement: ""Manchester United utterly condemns racist social media comments posted around yesterday's Champions League fixture. ""We are working to identify individuals involved and we will take the strongest possible action we can against them. ""There is no place for racism within our game, or in society as a whole, and we are committed to working to make football free from all forms of discrimination."" The 33-year-old was partially at fault for Barcelona's first goal as his clearance was blocked, leading to Lionel Messi scoring as the hosts went on to win 4-0 on aggregate. Anti-discrimination campaigners Kick It Out called upon the social media platform to act following a series of incidents. The organisation said via its own Twitter account: ""Yet another black player, this time Ashley Young, targeted with racist abuse on social media after tonight's Champions League game. ""Again, we're left asking @TwitterUK the same question -- when will you take serious action to tackle the rampant discrimination on your platform?"" Twitter was swift to respond, confirming that the posts concerned had violated its abusive behaviour policy and that the account holders would be required to remove them before they could tweet again. Premier League stars Mohamed Salah, Danny Welbeck, Raheem Sterling, Michy Batshuayi, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Moussa Sissoko have all received abuse over the same platform in recent years. England's black players were subjected to repeated chants during their Euro 2020 qualifier in Montenegro last month, while Tottenham defender Danny Rose revealed recently he has ""had enough"" of racism in football and ""can't wait"" to quit the game."
315,17/04/2019,13:30,Messi demands more after imperfect Barca blow away United,Lionel Messi lit up Camp Nou and devastated Manchester United before firing a warning to Barcelona that they cannot start slowly again.,"Barca were superior to United in all departments for the best part of 80 minutes on Tuesday, a 3-0 win perhaps even flattering for their opponents, who were two down in 20, both goals belonging to Messi. By the time Philippe Coutinho had curved in a third to send Ernesto Valverde's side into the Champions League semi-finals, United's stirring opening was long-forgotten, except by Barcelona's captain. ""We put on a spectacle,"" said Messi. ""But we came out cold and looked nervous in the first five minutes. We cannot come out like that in a Champions League match. Five bad minutes can knock you out."" ""We have shown who we are,"" Messi added, and in some ways, they were a perfect picture of their season. Thrust into a position of comfort by their mesmeric number 10, Barca put on an exhibition of attacking, possession football, all tricks, flicks and bicycle kicks. But there was also a nervousness at the start, seen briefly against Lyon in the previous round too, that suggests their desperation to win this tournament for the first time since 2015, and win it for Messi, does not weigh lightly. ""We had a lot of motivation for this tie, I can't deny it,"" said Valverde. ""Especially after not being in the semis for a long time and after last year's painful defeat. We were extremely focused."" And United's early threat was genuine. Their knack of breaking through central midfield, with only space and a backpedalling Barca defence ahead of them, exposed a fragility against pace and counter-attack that has never been far away. Liverpool carry a 2-0 lead over Porto into their second leg in Portugal on Wednesday and if it is to be them in the semi-finals, Mohamed Salah, Roberto Firmino and Sadio Mane might justifiably feel there is a weakness to exploit. ""We have had five difficult minutes because they started strong,"" said Valverde. ""But then there were another 85 minutes where we were not too bad."" Most deficiencies can be rectified by Messi, whose 109th and 110th goals in the Champions were, mysteriously, his first in a quarter-final since 2013. ""It was a streak he was always going to break,"" said Sergio Busquets. He also has potentially three extra games now to reduce the gap on Cristiano Ronaldo's unbeaten 126, after Juventus were knocked out by Ajax. ""You can plan as many tactics as you like,"" said United's coach Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. ""If you give him time and space, he will score."" When Messi pledged to bring ""that beautiful cup back to Camp Nou"" at the start of the season, the sense was of reordered priorities, that he and Barcelona would push harder in Europe, even if it came at the expense of their form in La Liga. Real Madrid and Atletico Madrid's failings have ensured the price has been small, with Valverde able to rest 10 players against Huesca last weekend and still see his team sitting nine points clear. An eighth league title in 11 years will become a double if they beat Valencia in the final of the Copa del Rey, and a treble, if they can see off Liverpool or Porto and then Manchester City, Tottenham or Ajax at Atletico's Wanda Metropolitano on June 1. If it is to be three consecutive English opponents, Messi might be pleased. He is now the fourth highest scorer against the Premier League's top-six sides, with 24 goals, despite never having played in the Premier League. ""We are not going to ask say sorry for having Messi,"" Valverde said. ""Although it certainly is lucky for us."""
316,17/04/2019,13:10,Reality bites in Barcelona as Man Utd remain miles behind,This time there was no Manchester United Champions League miracle at the Camp Nou as the magic of Lionel Messi and the visitors' mistakes helped Barcelona cruise into the semi-finals of the Champions League.,"Twenty years on from scoring the goal that crowned United champions of Europe in Catalonia, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was shown the long road ahead if he is to guide the Red Devils back to those heights again. Messi scored twice, the second of which owed much to a handling error from David de Gea. The final blow was delivered by a former Liverpool player, Philippe Coutinho, as Barca won 3-0 on Tuesday night and 4-0 on aggregate. ""We have said all along that this isn't going to change overnight and the next few years will be massive for us to get to the level of Barcelona,"" admitted Solskjaer. The Norwegian has been handed a three-year contract to bridge that gap, but the timing of tying down Solskjaer late last month now looks questionable. A wonderful run as a caretaker, capped by coming from 2-0 down to beat Paris Saint-Germain 3-1 in the French capital to progress on away goals in the last 16, made Solskjaer's case for the job on a permanent basis hard to ignore. However, five defeats in seven games have followed what now looks even more of a freak result in Paris. Moreover, the two games United did win in that run were highly unconvincing 2-1 victories at home to Watford and West Ham. After the latter last weekend, Solskjaer admitted his side ""got away with it."" ""It did not take the wondrous talents of Lionel Messi to show the scale of rebuilding necessary for this Manchester United squad,"" wrote The Times. ""Wolverhampton Wanderers and West Ham United have done that easily enough in recent weeks."" United now face a challenge just to make the Champions League next season. Sitting sixth in the Premier League, they have five games to make up ground on Tottenham, Arsenal and Chelsea to claim a top-four finish. Solskjaer must immediately raise the spirits and standards of his squad to keep United in top over the next 10 days. A tricky trip to Everton, who have beaten Chelsea and Arsenal in the previous two home games, awaits on Sunday before title-chasing Manchester City and Chelsea visit Old Trafford next week. However, there are, it seems, few players Solskjaer can depend on. Captain Ashley Young was at fault for Messi's opener and is symptomatic of United's wasted millions in the six years since Alex Ferguson's retirement. A 33-year-old converted right winger, plugged in at left-back, was always likely to struggle against the five-time Ballon d'Or winner. ""United fielded a team of mix-and-match defensive parts. Four of the back five were brought to the club by Sir Alex Ferguson, who has, for all the fond nods and sighs, been gone quite a long time now,"" wrote The Guardian. Paul Pogba did little to spark more admiring glances from Real Madrid at the Camp Nou with another anonymous display when needed most by United. Even De Gea, so often the saviour in the ruin of the post-Ferguson years, this time let his side down. ""We did well to get here,"" added Solskjaer in a desperate attempt to spin a positive line, but ultimately highlighting what is United's new reality. ""We have got a rebuilding job, but that starts with the coaches and the players and one or two additions to the squad will happen in the summer."" For a club that likes to boast about its wealth, but has failed to make the Champions League semi-finals in eight years, just one or two signings would be window dressing."
317,16/04/2019,22:54,Barcelona hammer Manchester United to reach Champions League semis,Lionel Messi pounced on two Manchester United mistakes to score twice and end their hopes of another Camp Nou comeback as Barcelona breezed into the Champions League semi-finals on Tuesday.,"After an excellent start, United were undone twice in four minutes by Messi, who first nicked the ball off the careless Ashley Young and then watched as a weak shot from distance squirmed underneath David de Gea. Philippe Coutinho, in perhaps his best performance of the season, added a third with a curling effort into the top corner and by the end, an outclassed United might have been relieved the score was not more traumatic than 3-0, 4-0 on aggregate. A dizzying opening spell, in which Marcus Rashford had hit the crossbar, was long-forgotten, even if it could offer Barcelona's next opponents some encouragement. Liverpool, who take a 2-0 lead to Porto on Wednesday, are the most likely obstacle between Barca and their first Champions League final since they last won this tournament in 2015. Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mane might feel encouraged. Instead, United's pair of early errors made this another night about Messi and ensured any faint hopes of repeating the comeback against Paris Saint-Germain, or even the famous 1999 rescue act against Bayern Munich, on this same pitch, were dashed. Messi now has his 109th and 110th Champions League goals and, potentially, three extra matches to reduce the gap on Cristiano Ronaldo's 126, after Juventus were dumped out by Ajax. Barcelona's fans celebrated that too. United's coach Ole Gunnar Solskjaer had urged his strikers to be more lethal here but it felt ominous that even before kick-off, Rashford, Anthony Martial, Romelu Lukaku and Alexis Sanchez had hit 42 goals this season, while Messi on his own had 43. Around an hour before kick-off, Alex Ferguson was on the side of the pitch, shaking hands with Ryan Giggs and sharing words with Solskjaer, the scorer of that goal against Munich here 20 years ago. They could have hardly have asked for a better start. United were brilliant for eight minutes and could have been ahead within 30 seconds as Rashford raced onto a curving Paul Pogba pass and toed away a shot, which Marc-Andre ter Stegen bravely left to graze his own crossbar. Barca were flustered, so much so the crowd even cheered with relief when Arthur Melo played his team's first convincing pass. Then, Barcelona had their own eight-minute flurry as United almost conceded a penalty, ruled out after Fred took the ball before bringing down Ivan Rakitic, and then did concede, twice, to Messi. Both could have been avoided, even if Young's turn on the edge of his own box was punished in devastating fashion. Young lunged in to atone for his mistake but Messi skipped away from him, poked it through Fred's legs and then whipped the ball past into the corner. The second was simpler. Fred and Scott McTominay closed in on Coutinho and the ball spilled out to Messi, whose dribbling shot with his right foot should have drawn a routine save. Instead, De Gea let is squirm under his body for 2-0. Pogba lashed out at the increasingly influential Arthur and Barca could have had a third before half-time, De Gea scrambling across to save on the line when Sergi Roberto should have finished. Messi could have had his hat-trick too after Luis Suarez found him with a superb cutback and there was an almost comical sequence in the second half when the Argentinian played with his United chasers before finally being bundled over by McTominay. Rashford might have made it interesting if he had controlled Pogba's ball over the top but Barcelona were in exhibition mode, helped by a vintage Coutinho curler after he had cut inside from the left. Messi even attempted a bicycle kick and there were celebrations from the home fans when news went round that Ajax had taken the lead in Turin. They believe this is their year."

""We are another year older and we want to make sure it doesn't happen again. We have to take those losses into account and use them to move forward."" Valverde urged his players to seize the opportunity. ""I think we all take examples of things happening in the past and use them to spur us on,"" he said. ""That's fine but I prefer to take charge of your own destiny. You won't be given something that falls from the sky. We have to earn it."" United's greatest threat in recent weeks has tended to come on the counter-attack but Solskjaer insists they cannot afford to sit back. ""There are freak results against Barcelona when you have 10 or 15 percent possession and they don't win but normally they do win,"" Solskjaer said. ""We need to stamp our authority on the game."""

""We are another year older and we want to make sure it doesn't happen again. We have to take those losses into account and use them to move forward."" Valverde urged his players to seize the opportunity. ""I think we all take examples of things happening in the past and use them to spur us on,"" he said. ""That's fine but I prefer to take charge of your own destiny. You won't be given something that falls from the sky. We have to earn it."" United's greatest threat in recent weeks has tended to come on the counter-attack but Solskjaer insists they cannot afford to sit back.

321,15/04/2019,19:32,Messi fit for Barca as United attempt another comeback,"Barcelona coach Ernesto Valverde has said Lionel Messi is in ""perfect"" condition to face Manchester United in the second leg of their Champions League quarter-final on Wednesday.","It is four years since Barca last reached the semis of Europe's premier competition but a 1-0 victory at Old Trafford makes them firm favourites ahead of the return at Camp Nou. Messi was among 10 players rested for the goalless draw against Huesca on Saturday after a hefty challenge from Chris Smalling last week left him with a swollen nose and cheek. ""He is fine,"" said Valverde at a press conference on Tuesday. ""He has recovered perfectly from the blow he suffered. He was fine after a couple of days. ""It is true that during the match he was a little stunned but he is in perfect condition and does not have any problems ahead of tomorrow's game."" Valverde said Ousmane Dembele could also feature after he played for 67 minutes against Huesca, having recovered from a hamstring injury. ""I don't know to what extent because he has been out for four weeks,"" Valverde said. ""But he is ready to play."" Barcelona have lost only one home game in the Champions League in 10 years but United will take hope from their last 16 comeback against Paris Saint-Germain, when they overturned a 2-0 first-leg defeat to go through. ""That memory from PSG will help the players and us as a team, that we know we can turn things around,"" coach Ole Gunnar Solskjaer said. ""Barcelona here at the Nou Camp is a difficult prospect but the memory will live with the players, it's not long ago."" Barca goalkeeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen is confident his team can avoid a repeat. ""The good thing is we play differently to PSG,"" he said. ""But United are dangerous and the result from the first leg is dangerous, it is a very small advantage."" Solskjaer might also draw upon his own experience of the Camp Nou, in 1999, when he scored a 93rd-minute winner as United came from 1-0 down to beat Bayern Munich 2-1 in the Champions League final. ""Of course it's a fantastic memory for me. It's the only time I've been on the pitch here,"" Solskjaer said. ""I dont mind if we score in the 93rd minute. If we get to injury-time we are a fit team."" Barcelona's recent history in this competition has been more painful as United look to follow Juventus, Atletico Madrid and Roma in sending them out in the quarter-finals for a fourth year in a row.

322,15/04/2019,10:38,Quarter-final curse looms as Barca and Messi look to set record straight,Four years have passed since Lionel Messi last reached a Champions League semi-final and his drought has become a source of unease for Barcelona ahead of their latest attempt on Tuesday.,"Manchester United are the ones looking to emulate Atletico Madrid, Juventus and Roma by sending Barca out in the quarters for a fourth year running but for the Catalans, another failure would be unforgivable, not least because of the implications for their captain. ""Last season we did the double but we all felt bad about how it went in the Champions League,"" Messi said in August. ""We promise this season we will do all we can to bring that beautiful cup back to Camp Nou."" Barcelona's dominance in Spain has been shaped by Messi, who only this month overtook Iker Casillas as the player with the most La Liga victories, 335, in its history. Those wins have helped them capture seven of the last 10 league titles, a figure that will surely become eight from 11 next month, given their nine-point lead at the top of the table. There could be an historic fifth consecutive Copa del Rey too if Ernesto Valverde's side beat Valencia on May 25. But in Europe, Barca would appear under-marked, with only one success in the last seven years, three in 10 since Pep Guardiola took charge in 2008 and set in motion what has felt, in playing terms at least, like an iconic era. The list of clubs etched onto the cup hoisted at the Wanda Metropolitano on June 1 will instead show a decade swallowed up by Real Madrid, whose domestic failings in that period have been exonerated by four Champions League triumphs in five years. ""Obviously it's infuriating,"" Luis Suarez said. ""Madrid have made history and it's a thorn in our side."" Messi's record is similarly unbalanced. He has nine La Liga titles and is by a distance the competition's top scorer, with an astonishing 414 goals. Cristiano Ronaldo, closest in second, has 311. But in the Champions League, Messi has lifted the trophy four times, a relatively modest return given it puts him on a par with 11 current Real Madrid players alone, including Nacho, Casemiro and Dani Carvajal. This year, Ronaldo is hunting his sixth. And while Messi dwarfs the Portuguese for goals in La Liga, the opposite is true in Europe, where Ronaldo has 125 goals to his 108. The game's most illustrious pair could yet meet in this year's final, should Barca capitalise on their 1-0 first-leg win over United and then overcome either Liverpool or Porto in the semis. Ronaldo and Juventus, meanwhile, would have to beat Ajax, and then either Manchester City or Tottenham. A showdown in Madrid would throw an even brighter glare on Messi's record compared to Ronaldo, whose sensational hat-trick against Atletico Madrid last month only enhanced the sense this tournament belongs to him. Messi is not one to complain, particularly given he cannot be blameless in Barca's underachievements in Europe. But the fans are frustrated, with last season's double doing little to ease the disappointment of the collapse against Roma. And his teammates feel it too, the weight of history on their shoulders from a need to square arguably the game's greatest ever player with a Champions League haul that befits that status. ""It is an important trophy,"" Suarez said after following up the league title by winning the Copa del Rey last season. ""But this does not hide what happened in Rome."" It means the pressure on Barcelona in this competition runs deep, a psychological burden that perhaps United, or their next opponents, will use to their advantage. For Messi, there is work to do."
323,15/04/2019,02:30,Sunk cost of Sanchez holding Man Utd back,Manchester United travel to Barcelona on Tuesday needing another miraculous Champions League fightback from a 1-0 first-leg defeat on home soil to make the semi-finals.,"The return of the club's highest earner from a six-week injury layoff to make the voyage to Catalonia in such circumstances should be a source of inspiration. However, it is symptomatic of Alexis Sanchez's decline in 16 months at United that the Chilean makes his comeback behind Marcus Rashford, Romelu Lukaku, Anthony Martial and Jesse Lingard in Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's pecking order. Sanchez signed reportedly the most lucrative contract in Premier League history when joining from Arsenal last January, earning close to £400,000 ($520,000) a week plus a series of bonuses. Unfortunately for the Red Devils, there has not been much cause for bonus payments as Sanchez has scored just five goals in 41 appearances for the club and only twice so far in his first full season at Old Trafford. Sanchez left Barcelona for the Premier League in 2014 in search of a more prominent role after being squeezed out by the arrival of Neymar at the Camp Nou and with Luis Suarez soon to complete a fearsome front three alongside Lionel Messi. Now into their thirties, Suarez and Messi still pose Barca's biggest threats, combining for 66 goals this season. By contrast, a hard-running style and years of grind for club and country seem to have burned Sanchez out having just turned 30 in December. In four consecutive summers between 2014 and 2017, he helped Chile reach the last 16 of the World Cup, win two Copa America titles in two years and then make the final of the Confederations Cup. So durable for much of his career, Sanchez's time at United has been permeated not only by poor performances but a series of injuries. Falling down the pecking order in a Barca squad laced with star talent and built around arguably the best player ever in Messi is one thing. Now Sanchez is a mere spectator even to a United side that has scored just once in five Champions League home games this season and failed to manage a single shot on target in the first leg against Barca. The splash on Sanchez's contract also threatens to cost the club dearly, either in lucrative new deals, or losing some of their best players. Solskjaer credited a fortunate 2-1 win over West Ham on Saturday to a stunning save from David de Gea. ""We have one of the best goalkeepers in the world,"" said the Norwegian, but De Gea's future is far from certain as he holds out for a pay packet at least on par with Sanchez with his current contract set to expire in 2020. Paul Pogba is also in talks over a new contract and reportedly wants to be the club's highest earner if United are to ward off interest from Real Madrid. A run of four defeats and two highly unconvincing 2-1 home wins over Watford and West Ham since United stunned Paris Saint-Germain with a 3-1 win in the French capital to make the last eight has laid bare how much surgery is needed on Solskjaer's squad, even if they hold onto De Gea and Pogba. Instead, it is Sanchez they would love to ship out if a buyer can be found to fund his wages. A Champions League quarter-final at the Camp Nou is exactly the sort of stage United's number seven was signed for. But with a £75,000 appearance fee included in his contract, it seems Solskjaer and United have decided there is little point throwing good money after bad."
324,13/04/2019,18:34,Much-changed Barcelona held by Huesca,"Barcelona held back for Manchester United by resting every outfield player possible on Saturday, including Lionel Messi, as La Liga's runaway leaders were held to a goalless draw by Huesca.","Goalkeeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen was the only one to keep his place at El Alcoraz as coach Ernesto Valverde made clear his focus is on sealing progress to the Champions League semi-finals after the 1-0 first-leg win at Old Trafford in midweek. Messi was left out of the squad completely while the suspended Gerard Pique posted a picture on social media of him watching the game on television, with a bowl of paella on his lap. The draw gives Atletico Madrid the chance to reduce the gap at the top of the table to nine points if they can beat Celta Vigo at home later on Saturday but, with six games left after this weekend, the difference is likely to prove irrelevant. For Huesca, who are bottom of the table in their first-ever season in Spain's top flight, a hard-earned point means they sit five adrift of safety, albeit having played a game more than those immediately above them. Their survival bid remains unlikely but alive. Malcom came closest to a winner, his shot hitting the post, but Huesca were good value for the draw and could even have snatched victory themselves in the second half. Messi left Manchester with a swollen nose and cheek on Wednesday after a clattering challenge from Chris Smalling but there is little concern about the Argentinian being fit for the return game at Camp Nou. Barca's huge advantage at the top of La Liga has afforded them the luxury now of prioritising success in Europe, the only issue perhaps for Valverde the small matter of maintaining momentum. Overall, they were better than Huesca but never really got out of second gear. Like Pique, Luis Suarez was also banned while Ivan Rakitic, Sergio Busquets and Clement Lenglet were among those rested. Ousmane Dembele came in after recovering from a hamstring injury and, after playing 67 minutes, his chance of a start next week would appear enhanced. Dembele came closest to a goal in the first half after a brilliant reverse pass from the talented Riqui Puig, one of a number of youngsters given a chance to impress. Another was Jean-Clair Todibo, who saw a header saved while Kevin-Prince Boateng, also handed a rare outing after his arrival in January, was unable to connect with a low Dembele cross. Huesca had their moments as Enric Gallego burst through but shot wide and then he wanted a penalty after Ter Stegen slid through the back of his legs to claim the ball. Malcom struck the post with a fizzing drive but despite Jordi Alba, Philippe Coutinho and Arthur Melo all coming on in the second half, Barca could not find a way through."
325,12/04/2019,16:51,Valverde considers resting Messi ahead of United return,Lionel Messi could be among a number of players rested by Barcelona on Saturday as Ernesto Valverde keeps one eye on their Champions League second leg against Manchester United.,"Valverde said on Friday that Messi may be spared the trip to Huesca, who sit bottom of La Liga, after a collision with United's Chris Smalling on Wednesday left the Argentinian with a bruised nose and cheek. ""It's possible,"" said Valverde, when asked about the chance of Messi sitting out this weekend. ""He's fine but it was a big hit. He was affected the day after and during the match, it was like being hit by a truck. We will analyse him later but it is a possibility."" Luke Shaw's own-goal meant Barca took a 1-0 victory away from Old Trafford and they can afford to rotate ahead of the return, given they sit 11 points clear at the top of La Liga. Kevin Prince-Boateng and Jeison Murillo, who have hardly featured since joining in January, could be given rare outings while Ousmane Dembele is likely to make his first appearance in a month after recovering from a hamstring injury. ""There will be changes tomorrow because the calendar is very congested,"" Valverde said. ""Another intense match is waiting for us tomorrow and then again on Tuesday, so we will make changes."" If Dembele comes through the game against Huesca unscathed, the Frenchman could be in line to start against United at Camp Nou. ""Tomorrow's game is important for Dembele but not because of United, because of tomorrow,"" Valverde said. ""We must make an effort to focus on the three points because we need them. ""We can't forget that we need ten points to be champions, no matter how much we think that we might be there already. ""We are not far away. We have to win three games and draw another and that has to start tomorrow."""
326,12/04/2019,02:55,Pique inspiring Barca to rediscover defensive steel,Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez might be the deadliest attack in Europe but Barcelona's success in the Champions League could rest on their increasingly mean defence.,"After their 1-0 win over Manchester United at Old Trafford on Wednesday, Gerard Pique said Barca are tighter at the back than they have been all season. ""We put in an excellent performance defensively, we're in our best form in defence of the season,"" Pique said. ""The early goal relaxed us and we knew how to cope with the situation, the fact we didn't concede helps us a lot."" Barcelona face a trip to La Liga's bottom-club Huesca on Saturday, when Ernesto Valverde is likely to rotate his line-up ahead of the return leg against United three days later. An 11-point lead at the top of the table has earned Barca that luxury, while United face West Ham the same afternoon, still scrapping for a place in the Premier League's top four. To turn the tie around, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's team will have to score at least once at Camp Nou, where their opponents have endured only one defeat in 52 matches and, in the Champions League, one in 10 years. Nerves could yet affect Barcelona, whose entire season seems to hinge on their performance in Europe, but they now have a defence too that can step up when the attack stalls. Messi, bruised and bloodied, was quiet against United, a muted display typical of his team, who struggled for their usual fluency going forward. Instead, it was Pique that shone, the 32-year-old delivering arguably his best showing of the season as part of an impressive, disciplined defensive display. ""We were very conscientious,"" said Jordi Alba. ""Sometimes you go on the attack and leave the defence open but we sat in more and balanced the game."" Under Valverde, Barcelona's free-flowing, passing style has been given a more pragmatic edge, with solidity and athleticism deemed key ingredients to allow Messi and Suarez to thrive. But the defensive rigour had slipped. After conceding less than half a goal a game in the first half of Valverde's opening campaign, Barca were conceding more than a goal a game for the second half of last season and the first half of this one. Four league matches without a win in September and October were underpinned by errors at the back. There are signs though that they have tightened again. In the last 12 league games they have kept six clean sheets, with the goals conceded now back below a goal per game. In all competitions, they have shut out Lyon, Real Madrid, twice, Atletico and Manchester United in the past three months alone. ""Pique and Lenglet are a great pairing, they are the security for us,"" Sergio Busquets said on Wednesday. ""They are playing at a very high level,"" added Valverde. Barca's dominance means Real Madrid and Atletico are left battling for second place, with Real away to Leganes on Monday after Atletico host Celta Vigo on Saturday. Diego Simeone will be without Diego Costa, who has been handed an eight-match ban by the Spanish football federation for insulting referee Gil Manzano during last weekend's defeat at Camp Nou. Atletico have appealed but if unsuccessful, Costa will not play again this season. Real are now only two points behind their city rivals ahead of their game against Leganes, with all eyes on Zinedine Zidane's team selection again. Gareth Bale endured another difficult afternoon as Real scraped past Eibar last time out and it remains to be seen if the Welshman keeps his place. Whistled again by supporters at the Santiago Bernabeu, Bale's future in Spain has perhaps never looked less certain. ""Bale, with all his experience, is used to it,"" said Casemiro on Thursday. ""When the fans whistle a player, they are whistling all of us. We cannot forget the titles and goals that he has given us."" Fixtures (all times GMT)"
327,11/04/2019,14:01,Lukaku calls for Man Utd 'arrogance' against Barcelona,"Romelu Lukaku called on Manchester United to play with ""arrogance and confidence"" against Barcelona as they seek to overturn a 1-0 defeat in the first leg of their Champions League quarter-final.","Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's side face an uphill battle at the Camp Nou next week after Luke Shaw's own goal gave Barca a 1-0 win in Wednesday's match at Old Trafford. United rallied after that early setback and unsettled Ernesto Valverde's side, giving Lukaku and his teammates confidence of a memorable turnaround in Spain next Tuesday. ""We have to believe and have the desire and more quality than today,"" said the Belgium striker. ""Be better on the ball and then you never know what can happen in football. ""I don't think we played with the same arrogance and confidence on the ball (early on). Second half we tried and the first 20 minutes of the second half we were there. ""It's something we have to do for the whole 90 minutes over there and not concede a goal and score early."" That approach worked well at Paris Saint-Germain last month as United made Champions League history by becoming the first side to progress after losing the first leg at home by two or more goals. The Parc des Princes triumph was the highlight of a topsy-turvy campaign for the Old Trafford giants, but even during the difficult Jose Mourinho era they managed to seal a last-gasp 2-1 comeback win at Juventus. Asked if those two matches will play on Barcelona's mind, Lukaku said: ""Yeah, but I don't think they will look at us. We have to look at ourselves, get a result and give our all, run as much as we can."" Wednesday saw United fail to muster a shot on target for the first time in a Champions League match since 2005, but there was some promising build-up play. ""Definitely (they are beatable),"" Lukaku added. ""On the day you can score from one chance and that's what they did today. ""There was a lack of concentration and they scored a goal and from that moment on we tried to control, but I think over there we have to do a better job and stay focused a bit more, we know they have players who make late runs. ""For us we have to go with the desire, be focused and when the chance comes, we have to score."""
328,11/04/2019,12:37,Pogba says Man Utd can hurt Barcelona in the Camp Nou,Paul Pogba says Manchester United can hurt Barcelona at the Camp Nou as Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's side plot another unlikely Champions League comeback following their 1-0 home defeat.,"Luke Shaw's own goal from a Luis Suarez header was the difference in Wednesday's first leg of the quarter-final at Old Trafford, where United failed to muster a single shot on target but largely shackled Barca's glut of attackers. Solskjaer's men face an uphill battle but they will travel with memories still fresh of their remarkable recovery last month to beat Paris Saint-Germain on away goals after losing the home leg 2-0. French World Cup winner Pogba was encouraged by how United largely kept Barcelona quiet. ""I think it was a good game,"" the midfielder said. ""Obviously we were playing against Barcelona, one of the best teams in the world, but we gave them some problems as well. ""They gave us some problems but we know where we can hurt them. Now it is one leg gone, you have the other one and we are going to give everything on this one."" Asked if United could beat the Spanish league leaders, Pogba said: ""Of course. If you don't believe that you can beat them, you just let them go through. ""Of course we believe that we can beat them. We are Manchester United. Even if they are Barcelona, we are Manchester United and we play in the Champions League like they do and we can go through, of course."" Winning at the Camp Nou will be a tough ask but Pogba said the PSG comeback breeds positivity. ""Probably Paris will be in their minds for sure because they saw what we can do against PSG,"" he said. ""Obviously they will be comfortable on their own pitch but let us see. We'll see what happens at the end. I think maybe the chances that we get we have to put them in and be careful. ""They didn't have really a lot of chances. Maybe one when David (de Gea) made a great save but then after that they were not that dangerous, not a lot of chances. ""So, try to avoid this and be a killer in front. That's it."""
329,11/04/2019,12:07,Goal-shy Man Utd pray for another Champions League miracle,Manchester United's powers of recovery carried them to a first Champions League quarter-final in five years but even Ole Gunnar Solskjaer admits beating Barcelona in the Camp Nou is maybe one mountain too many to climb.,"Unlike their experience in losing the first leg of their last-16 tie on home soil 2-0 to Paris Saint-Germain, United were not outclassed by the Catalan giants in a 1-0 defeat on Wednesday. However, on a night when Lionel Messi was left bloodied by a charging Chris Smalling and had little impact after playing his part in creating Luke Shaw's 12th-minute own goal, Barca were still comfortable winners. ""Messi received a black eye and a bloodied nose but Manchester United did not lay a glove on Barcelona,"" was the verdict of the Daily Telegraph. Implausibly, Solskjaer's men turned the PSG tie around with a famous 3-1 victory in Paris, but the task of overturning a home defeat against a side of serial Champions League winners is an even tougher one. ""It will be a greater achievement winning that one with the history of Barcelona,"" said Solskjaer. ""They are not used to losing at home."" The scale of the task is shown by the fact that Barca have not lost a Champions League game at Camp Nou since 2013, racking up 27 wins and three draws in 30 matches since. That is a home European record that the Red Devils can only envy. Solskjaer famously won the Champions League for United as a player at Barca's Camp Nou against Bayern Munich in 1999. But he also played a part in a less-heralded moment of the club's history, a first-ever home defeat in European football, at the hands of Fenerbahce in 1996. Fortress Old Trafford provided the launchpad for Alex Ferguson's sides to regularly compete for Champions League glory. However, those days seem long gone. Barca, without ever needing to approach their best, became the fourth visiting side in the past six Champions League games to come away from Manchester victorious. United's only win in that run was a turgid 1-0 victory over Swiss champions Young Boys in November. That match also contained their only goal in five Champions League games at Old Trafford this season, scored by Marouane Fellaini, who Solskjaer was happy to let leave the club in January. Against Barcelona, the hosts did not even manage a single shot on target in a Champions League game for the first time since 2005. ""Those statistics are not bright are they?"" Solskjaer admitted. ""We cannot defend that, not scoring goals at home."" Defeat was a fourth in five games for Solskjaer since the remarkable fightback in Paris. That win helped land him the job on a permanent basis last month after a brilliant caretaker spell in charge, but as his immediate impact begins to wear off, familiar failings have begun to appear. The Norwegian boss was reluctant to single out his strikers, citing a lack of creativity. ""We have to provide a bit more ammunition for them and chances for them,"" he said. Solskjaer called on Paul Pogba to ""run the game"" ahead of Barca's visit but instead it was 22-year-old Scott McTominay he praised afterwards for wrestling back control of the midfield after a poor start. Romelu Lukaku was ineffective up front before being replaced 22 minutes from time, while Ashley Young's wretched display at right-back showed a rebuilding job is also needed at the other end of the pitch. Solskjaer's early success allowed United fans to dream and, after Paris, they will believe anything is possible in Barcelona. However, it has also merely papered over cracks that need more permanent solutions come the summer transfer market."
330,11/04/2019,11:09,"Barca target Jovic to stay at Frankfurt, says father",The father of Eintracht Frankfurt star striker Luka Jovic has told German newspaper Bild that his son will snub Barcelona and stay at the Bundesliga club next season.,"Serbian striker Jovic, 21, has been linked with several of Europe's top clubs after a breakthrough season in which he has scored 24 goals and fired Frankfurt into the last eight of the Europa League. Ahead of Frankfurt's quarter-final first leg with Benfica on Thursday, Jovic's father said that, while Spanish giants Barcelona have made an approach, his son is more likely to stay at Frankfurt next season. ""Luka has had requests, including one from Barcelona, but is not interested,"" Milan Jovic told Bild on Thursday. ""He doesn't know if he can play football there -- he wants to get to the Champions League with Eintracht and stay there."" ""He came to me a few days ago and said 'Dad, it's not about the money, I want to play football'."" ""He is very close friends with the other young players in the team."" Frankfurt are currently on course for a top four finish in the Bundesliga, which would see them qualify for the Champions League next season. Jovic himself has said that he would be open to staying at Frankfurt if the team make it into Europe's top competition. ""I would like to play here next season. If we get to the Champions League, they will find it hard to get rid of me,"" he told Bild earlier this season. Though Jovic is technically on loan from Benfica, Frankfurt confirmed in March that they have the option to buy him this sumer for ""less than seven million euros"" ($7.9m). With clubs such as Barcelona reportedly prepared to pay much more, Frankfurt hope either to hold on to their star striker or sell him on at a substantial profit. Yet Jovic's father told Bild that his son has always been grounded and turned down offers from Borussia Dortmund, Schalke and Arsenal as a boy."
331,11/04/2019,00:28,"Beating Barcelona tougher than PSG, admits Solskjaer","Manchester United face an even tougher task to turn around the 1-0 deficit from the first leg of their quarter-final with Barcelona than their miraculous comeback away to Paris Saint-Germain in the last 16, coach Ole Gunnar Solskjaer admitted on Wednesday.","United became the first side to ever overcome a 2-0 first leg defeat at home to reach the last eight with a 3-1 win in Paris last month. But Solskjaer, who scored the winner when United won the Champions League at the Camp Nou in 1999, believes Barca's prestigious European history makes beating the Spanish champions a different prospect to PSG. ""Of course the PSG performance away gives us hope and belief we can do it, but we know we are playing against probably the favourites for the tournament,"" said Solskjaer. ""It will be a greater achievement winning that one with the history of Barcelona. They are not used to losing at home."" Luke Shaw's early own goal was all that separated the sides on the scoresheet, but Barca comfortably edged towards a first Champions League semi-final in four years as United failed to register a single shot on target. ""It leaves a good taste in the mouth to win here, but we know it is not a big enough lead given what happened (with United) in the last round,"" said Barca coach Ernesto Valverde. Much has been made of Luis Suarez's Champions League goal drought on the road and while the Uruguayan has still not officially netted an away goal in the competition since September 2015, he had a huge hand in Barca's winner. Lionel Messi drifted in behind the United defence and his cross hung up to the back post was headed goalwards by Suarez, the ball flicking off Shaw on its way past David de Gea. An errant offside flag briefly threatened to spoil Suarez's delight. However, the goal was quickly given on a VAR review and the former Liverpool striker took extra glee at having the last laugh with a fist pump in front of the Stretford End. ""The value of the goal doesn't change if another player gets the last touch or not,"" added Valverde. The early goal should have settled the Catalans into their stride as their dominance of possession touched close to 90 percent in the opening stages. Yet they offered United plenty of encouragement with Sergio Busquets in particular off the pace. ""It is very difficult over the course of a season to always be at the highest level,"" said Valverde. ""To win away from home in the Champions League you have to suffer."" United defender Chris Smalling had said ""bring it on"" at the prospect of facing Messi on the eve of the game. And he left the Argentine bloodied from the nose as he careered into an aerial challenge on the half-hour mark. Messi was quickly back on his feet and into the heart of the action, but it was Philippe Coutinho who came closest to extending Barca's advantage before the break with a thunderous low shot that De Gea did brilliantly to repel with his feet. Moments later United could easily have been on level terms, but the hosts' best chance of the half fell to the wrong man as Marcus Rashford picked out Diogo Dalot only for the Portuguese to completely miscue his header across goal. However Rashford also failed to make proper contact with his big chance early in the second-half when Ter Stegen could only punch a cross into his path. The Red Devils have now failed to score and have lost in four of their last six home Champions League games. ""Those statistics are not bright, we cannot defend not scoring goals at home,"" added Solskjaer. ""But away from home we beat Juventus, we beat PSG and we have to go to Barcelona and win that one."" The result could have been worse for Solskjaer's men as Suarez fired into the side-netting before De Gea used his feet to good effect once more to deny Jordi Alba."
332,10/04/2019,23:10,Shaw own goal hands Barca control of Man Utd tie,"Manchester United have another monumental task on their hands in the Champions League after Luke Shaw's own goal gave Barcelona a 1-0 quarter-final, first leg lead at Old Trafford on Wednesday.","Shaw turned Luis Suarez's header into his own net after just 12 minutes and despite being far from their best, Barca comfortably held out to edge towards a first Champions League semi-final in four years. United produced one of the European Cup's finest ever comebacks from a 2-0 first-leg defeat at home to Paris Saint-Germain in the last 16. However, on the ground where manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer completed another famous fightback to win the competition as a player in 1999, United must repeat the trick at the Camp Nou in six days' time. Much has been made of Suarez's Champions League goal drought on the road and while the Uruguayan has still not officially netted an away goal in the competition since September 2015, he had a huge hand in Barca's winner. Lionel Messi drifted in behind the United defence and his cross hung up to the back post was headed goalwards by Suarez, the ball flicking off Shaw on its way past David de Gea. An errant offside flag briefly threatened to spoil Suarez's delight. However, the goal was quickly given on a VAR review and the former Liverpool striker took extra glee at having the last laugh with a fist pump in front of the Stretford End. The early goal should have settled the Spanish champions into their stride as their dominance of possession touched close to 90 percent in the opening stages. Yet, they offered United plenty of encouragement with Sergio Busquets in particular off the pace. Marcus Rashford shrugged off an ankle injury to start and provided by a distance United's biggest threat. A free-kick from the England international flew just wide inside the first five minutes and he sent another dipping effort from range just over Marc-Andre ter Stegen's crossbar. United defender Chris Smalling had said ""bring it on"" at the prospect of facing Messi on the eve of the game. And he left the Argentine bloodied from the nose as he careered into an aerial challenge on the half-hour mark. Messi was quickly back on his feet and into the heart of the action, but it was Philippe Coutinho who came closest to extending Barca's advantage before the break with a thunderous low shot that De Gea did brilliantly to repel with his feet. Moments later United could easily have been on level terms, but the hosts' best chance of the half fell to the wrong man as Rashford picked out Diogo Dalot only for the Portuguese to completely miscue his header across goal. Rashford, though, also failed to make proper contact with his big chance early in the second-half when Ter Stegen could only punch a cross into his path. United enjoyed the better of the opening stages in the second half, but lacked a creative spark to open Barca up with Paul Pogba too often picking the sideways pass rather than looking to thread the eye of a needle towards Rashford and the ineffective Romelu Lukaku. Barca boss Ernesto Valverde reacted by introducing midfielders Sergi Roberto and Arturo Vidal from the bench in order to restore to control. And as United chased in vain for an equaliser, the visitors began to create chances again in the final quarter. Suarez fired into the side-netting before De Gea used his feet to good effect once more to deny Jordi Alba. Anthony Martial had one final big opportunity to send United to Catalonia next week on level terms, but a heavy touch allowed the faultless Gerard Pique to intervene and condemn the Red Devils to a fourth defeat in their last six home Champions League games."
333,09/04/2019,19:54,"Barcelona must kill off comeback kings Man Utd, says Pique",Gerard Pique says Barcelona must learn from last season's Champions League collapse against Roma and be wary of Manchester United's powers of recovery ahead of Wednesday's quarter-final clash.,"Defender Pique, who was part of the United squad that won the European Cup in 2008 before returning to Catalonia, was on the winning side as Barca beat United in Champions League finals in 2009 and 2011. Pique won the tournament for a fourth time in 2015 but in each season since, the Spanish league leaders have fallen at the quarter-final stage. The most painful exit came last year when they blew a 4-1 first leg lead by losing 3-0 to Roma to bow out on away goals. United are in the last eight for just the second time since the sides last met in the final, but also showed their capacity to fight back by overturning a 2-0 first-leg defeat at home to beat big-spending Paris Saint-Germain in the last 16. ""The game against PSG is a great example. They (PSG) were better, but you cannot let United off the hook because they have a great team and a great history as they showed in Paris,"" Pique said on Tuesday. ""We learned (from Roma) that things happen, even if it seemed unimaginable that they will. ""We learned that you cannot let an opponent back into a tie if they are not killed off. That will help us for facing a team like United. ""If at any point we can kill off the tie, we have to do it."" Tasked with derailing Barca's bid for a third treble since 2009 and stopping an in-form Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez, United will be cast in the role of underdog just as they were in the last round. The appointment of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer as the new permanent manager of the English giants has coincided with a dip in form, with United losing three of their four games since winning in Paris. But the Norwegian is also seeking inspiration from the PSG tie and believes his side have learned from what they did wrong in losing the first leg on home soil. ""Of course when you get Barcelona, with the quality of their team, we know we need to step up our game,"" said Solskjaer. ""We know we need to perform to our best levels, which we didn't against PSG at home. The outcome of the second leg against PSG has given the players and supporters belief that the same is possible against Barcelona."" United's comeback at the Parc des Princes was even more remarkable as Solskjaer was without 10 first-team players. He is short-handed once more, with Ander Herrera, Antonio Valencia and Eric Bailly absent through injury. However, Solskjaer is hopeful that Marcus Rashford and Nemanja Matic will be fit for the first leg despite failing to take a full part in training on Tuesday. ""He needed an extra warm-up and hopefully he won't get a reaction,"" said Solskjaer on Rashford's fitness. ""Let's see tomorrow, but hopefully he can be ready."" With Rashford a doubt, United are even more in need of an inspirational performance from Paul Pogba. The Frenchman will return from suspension after being sent off in the first-leg defeat to PSG. Pogba has yet to truly shine on the Champions League stage for United but with speculation he could be tempted by a summer move to Real Madrid, Solskjaer called on the club's record signing to focus on his job tomorrow and rise to the big occasion. ""At Paul's best he can run a game like this,"" said Solskjaer. ""Paul is looking forward to tomorrow. He is a Manchester United player and he is one of our big performers on the big stage. ""He knows the game against PSG was not his greatest moment. He is only focused on tomorrow playing well against Barcelona and I cannot see him not playing for Manchester United next season."""
334,08/04/2019,15:42,Dembele in Barca squad for United Champions League match,French striker Ousmane Dembele is close to shaking off a thigh strain and was named in Ernesto Valverde's Barcelona squad on Monday for the Champions League quarter-finals first-leg at Manchester United.,"The 21-year-old World Cup winner has excelled on both flanks this season after a slow bedding in process at Barcelona, but has been on the sidelines since March 16 with a thigh muscle problem. Valverde said he had chosen the still-struggling winger in his squad for Wednesday's game because he needed all hands on deck. ""Dembele is on the list despite not yet being fully fit,"" said Valverde, who added that Dembele had taken part in full training on Monday. Dembele, who scored in Barcelona's 5-1 victory over Lyon in his last Champions League outing, had originally been expected to miss four weeks. The former Dortmund and Rennes forward missed Barca's 2-0 win at Atletico Madrid on Saturday as the club target a La Liga, Copa del Rey and Champions League treble they achieved in both 2009 and 2015. Belgium defender Thomas Vermaelan will miss the trip to England with his own thigh issue."
335,12/03/2019,16:28,Another opportunity knocks for struggling Coutinho at Barca,"Philippe Coutinho was always going to have a hard time filling the void left by Andres Iniesta but just over a year into his Barcelona contract, the Brazilian might not have expected this.","Substituted during Barca's win over Rayo Vallecano at the Camp Nou on Saturday, Coutinho was whistled by a small section of his own fans as he trudged off, replaced by World Cup winner Ivan Rakitic. The Brazil playmaker has fallen behind Ousmane Dembele in the pecking order and, even with the youngster struggling for fitness ahead of their Champions League second leg against Lyon on Wednesday, Coutinho's place is not guaranteed. Lyon took a goalless draw from the opening leg. Signed for 160 million euros ($180 million) 14 months ago, Coutinho was supposed to become one of the drivers of this Barcelona team, an indispensable part of the starting line-up, not a back-up for an unpredictable, albeit supremely talented, 21-year-old. When Dembele sprained his ankle in January, Coutinho was given a run in the side but his performances were largely underwhelming and when Dembele recovered, the French youngster returned to the side. ""Philippe is having a good season,"" Gerard Pique said last weekend. ""He obviously cost a lot and that means there are higher expectations but it is what it is. You have to accept the reaction of the fans because at the end of the day they're our fans. ""We all have to give him support because we need him at his best in the final stage of the season and I'm sure he will be."" Coach Ernesto Valverde is already being asked about Coutinho's future, with a move back to England regularly touted in the Spanish press. Barcelona president Josep Maria Bartomeu has been forced to insist he is ""not for sale"". In La Liga this season, Coutinho has started 16 of Barcelona's 27 matches and has come on as a substitute in nine. He has four goals and two assists, and has not completed 90 minutes since January. The problem has been, in part, not of his own making. He arrived six months before Iniesta waved goodbye and the theory went that his craft, vision and skill made him a natural successor to one of the club's greatest ever playmakers. But, despite trying him deeper in midfield, Valverde was unconvinced. Coutinho was pushed further forward, into the left of the front three, where his ability to cut inside and create, or shoot, seemed a better fit. The trouble is that Lionel Messi likes to do the same from the right and, at times, the pair have seemed to be occupying the same spaces. If Coutinho submits to Messi, the game passes him by. If he tries to match the Argentinian's output, the tendency has been to try too hard, with wild shots, complicated passes and weaving runs into busy areas of the pitch. ""We're at a club where there's an incredible demand to win,"" said Valverde after the win over Rayo. ""We're always hoping our players can produce something but it doesn't always happen. Sometimes things come off, sometimes they don't. But his work rate is there for everyone to see."" There is a psychological element too. Those that know him well speak of Coutinho as a shy character, one that has always made an impact through performances rather than ego or self-belief. At Liverpool, he said he watched videos of Steven Gerrard and after arriving at Barcelona, he pledged to the do the same with Iniesta. But it would not be a surprise if Coutinho's price tag weighed heavy and the idea he could plug the gap left by Iniesta even heavier. Valverde maintains, publicly at least, he is not concerned, but the opportunities at a club like Barcelona will not be endless. The game against Lyon is another chance. ""The thing with Philippe is he takes risks, he tries to make things happen,"" Valverde said last month. ""He is being watched through a magnifying glass at the moment but we have faith. We believe he'll keep moving forward."""
336,12/03/2019,03:00,"Lyon hoping Fekir, Depay rise to the occasion in Barcelona","Lyon go to Barcelona for their Champions League last 16, second leg on Wednesday hoping to pull off a shock result with the tie still open after a goalless draw in France last month.","The odds appear stacked against the French club -- it is nine years since they won a Champions League knockout-round tie, while Barcelona are unbeaten in their last 29 home games in the competition, winning 26 of those. Bruno Genesio's team could also be without their influential Brazilian centre-back Marcelo after he pulled up injured at the weekend, but they do have two potential match-winners further forward. Lyon's prospects of a top-three finish in France and a return to next season's Champions League were compromised in a 2-2 draw at Strasbourg on Saturday. Genesio rested a host of key players and the move backfired as OL surrendered a two-goal lead in the second half. Nabil Fekir was one of those who started the game on the bench, although he came on late as Lyon looked for the winner. The club captain is Lyon's main man, and one for the big occasion after featuring for France on their run to World Cup glory last year. Scorer of 12 goals this season, the 25-year-old was missed in the first leg against Barcelona as he served a suspension but will be back in an attacking midfield role on Wednesday. ""When Nabil is on the field, we know what to expect, he's a great player who gives us reassurance. He has already shown his importance on the European scene,"" said teammate Martin Terrier of Fekir, who scored in Lyon's 2-1 win at Manchester City in the group stage and also netted the decisive goal against Shakhtar Donetsk that clinched their place in the last 16. Can he repeat the feat at the Camp Nou? Lyon's detractors see them as a side who can mix it with the best one week only to go missing in games they are expected to win. They took four points from Manchester City in the group stage and beat Paris Saint-Germain last month before holding Barcelona in the first leg. But Saturday's match in Strasbourg encapsulated that inconsistency after they seemed to have the points in the bag thanks to Moussa Dembele's double. If Lyon's Jekyll and Hyde nature is summed up by one player, then it has to be Memphis Depay. The Dutchman has relaunched a career that stalled at Manchester United since moving to France for an initial 16 million euros in January 2017. So much so that he recently said in an interview with a Dutch magazine that he wanted ""a new transfer to a top-level club this summer. Lyon is a big club but it's not one of the five best in Europe."" Unfortunately, the 25-year-old's comments came in the midst of a goal drought that would last for three-and-a-half months, taking in 17 appearances. However, he broke that by scoring in consecutive games before watching the entirety of Saturday's match from the bench to keep him fresh for Barcelona. ""Throughout the period where he wasn't scoring, he was still helping the team,"" said Genesio last week. ""Now he has been rewarded for his efforts -- in football, you get what you deserve."" Genesio must decide whether to start the ex-PSV Eindhoven star on the left wing, or use him as a central striker rather than top scorer Dembele."
337,11/03/2019,13:45,Spanish tax authorities investigating Neymar: report,"Spain's tax authorities are investigating the bonus Neymar earned when he extended his contract with Barcelona as well as his world-record transfer to Paris Saint-Germain, daily newspaper El Mundo reported Monday.","The authorities are looking into whether the Brazilian paid tax in Spain related to the two deals, the newspaper said. Contacted by AFP, the tax office refused to comment on the report. Neymar was a tax resident in Spain in 2017, the year he transferred from Barcelona to Paris Saint-Germain on a five-year deal for a world record 222 million euros ($249 million). The 27-year-old Brazilian international and Barcelona are already battling in court over a bonus the player was paid when in 2016 he signed a new five-year deal with the Catalan giants just nine months before joining PSG. A hearing over that case is scheduled for March 21 at a Barcelona labour court. The tax authorities have asked the labour court for all the information it has regarding this case, El Mundo said. The court declined to comment. After Neymar agreed to move to the French side, Barcelona refused to pay the player 26 million euros which were part of a bonus it promised him when he extended his contract with them. Barcelona are suing Neymar for 8.5 million euros for breach of contract and to demand he return the amount of the bonus money which it did pay him. Neymar, in turn, is suing Barcelona to demand his former club pay his entire renewal bonus. His is just one of several famous footballers who have fallen foul of Spain's tax authorities in recent years. A Spanish court in January handed Portuguese striker Cristiano Ronaldo a suspended two-year prison sentence for committing tax fraud when he was at Real Madrid. The player, who joined Italian side Juventus last year, also agreed to pay 18.8 million euros in fines and back taxes to settle the case, according to judicial sources. Barcelona's Lionel Messi, once Ronaldo's big La Liga rival, paid a two-million-euro fine in 2016 in his own tax wrangle and received a 21-month jail term. The prison sentence was later reduced to a further fine of 252,000 euros, equivalent to 400 euros per day of the original term."
338,08/03/2019,16:50,"Lyon, Rennes carrying French hopes in Europe after PSG exit","Paris Saint-Germain's repeated Champions League failures may reflect badly on French football, but Lyon and Rennes are still both in contention to qualify for European quarter-finals.","PSG are licking their wounds and reflecting on where they go from here after their humiliating exit at the hands of Manchester United in the last 16, one that has damaged the reputation of Ligue 1 abroad. ""The elimination of Paris is not good for our standing in Europe, nor for our image,"" said Monaco coach Leonardo Jardim, who took his team to the Champions League semi-finals in 2017. Jardim expressed hope that Lyon can do better when they face Barcelona away in their last 16, second leg next Wednesday. A 0-0 draw at home in the first leg means Bruno Genesio's side head to the Camp Nou for the return still in with a chance, even if they are by no means the favourites. For one thing, they have World Cup-winning captain Nabil Fekir back available after suspension kept him out of the first leg. In addition, Memphis Depay is back among the goals, scoring in each of the last two games after previously going three and a half months without finding the net. Lyon have already shown in taking four points off Manchester City in the group stage that they can mix it with the best teams on the continent, although Genesio insisted PSG's elimination does not add extra pressure for his side. ""We are competitors and we wanted to qualify regardless of PSG's result, so we will still want to do so. It changes nothing,"" said Genesio on Friday. ""I was very disappointed for their coach, their players and for French football. It just shows that in football everything is possible and you are never safe from anything."" Before going to Barcelona, Lyon face mid-table Strasbourg at the Stade de la Meinau on Saturday looking to stay on track for a top-three finish in Ligue 1. OL are five points behind second-placed Lille and five better off than Marseille in fourth -- only the top two qualify automatically for next season's Champions League. Meanwhile, Rennes can be optimistic about their chances of progressing to the Europa League quarter-finals after beating Arsenal 3-1 on Thursday in their last 16, first leg in Brittany. They head to London for the return next week after coming from behind to beat an Arsenal side who played more than half the game with 10 men, although their coach Julien Stephan sought to take the pressure off his team. ""Despite the victory, for me, Arsenal remain favourites given their past and their experience,"" said Stephan, who was appointed in December. ""The only thing I think is that we will need to score there, at least once, if not twice."" Regardless of what happens in the return, this is already Rennes' best ever European run. To put the result into some context, Arsenal are just one point behind Manchester United in the Premier League, while Rennes are 10th in Ligue 1, 34 points adrift of leaders PSG. Rennes are at home to relegation-threatened Caen on Sunday, but PSG will not play -- their game at Nantes was postponed with authorities concerned about the impact of ongoing ""yellow vest"" protests in France. Thomas Tuchel's team will be back in action next Tuesday away at Dijon. Fixtures (all times GMT)"
339,08/03/2019,14:46,Real Madrid exit a warning for Barcelona - Valverde,Ernesto Valverde has refused to rule Real Madrid out of the title race but says their Champions League exit should serve as a warning to Barcelona when they play Lyon next week.,"Barca are at home to Rayo Vallecano on Saturday in La Liga, four days before hosting Lyon in Europe, with the tie hanging in the balance following a goalless draw in the first leg. Their position is more comfortable in the league, where they sit seven points ahead of Atletico Madrid and 12 in front of Real, but Valverde insists there is no room for complacency. ""I do not rule out any team, none of us do,"" Valverde said at a press conference on Friday. ""Atletico is now the closest rival and our objective is to keep this distance at least. I do not rule out Real Madrid either out of respect and because of the maths. ""We see the Real Madrid situation from a distance and with respect, because we know that football is what it is, a lot can change in a week. ""When we see there are teams that go out of the Champions League after having good leads, and teams that are strong and powerful, it tells us how difficult it is to go through. Nobody is safe."" Barca face Rayo, who are 19th in La Liga, on the back of consecutive victories over Real at the Santiago Bernabeu. ""There are certain matches that get a lot of focus in the season,"" Valverde said. ""But it is those with less focus that either give you the title or take it away."" But Valverde admitted he could rest players with the game against Lyon in mind, although there was no place for Kevin-Prince Boateng in his squad, despite the striker joining in January to provide cover for Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez. ""Someone has to stay out,"" Valverde said. ""He has to work to turn it around."" Clement Lenglet is suspended and Thomas Vermaelen injured, meaning Samuel Umtiti could start as he continues to regain sharpness following three months out with a knee injury. ""He is coming back little by little and trying to recover his best level,"" Valverde said. ""But when it's been a while, you always need some time."""
340,03/03/2019,12:19,Unhappy Madrid were too soft against Barca - Mourinho,"Jose Mourinho accused Real Madrid of lacking fight and looking unhappy against Barcelona on Saturday, just as the pressure cranked up on coach Santiago Solari after a second successive Clasico defeat.","Mourinho has been among those mentioned as a possible replacement for Solari, as Madrid have been knocked out of both the Copa del Rey and, realistically, La Liga's title race within four days. The fact that both losses came at the hands of Barca, and at the Santiago Bernabeu, compounds the misery. After losing 3-0 in the cup on Wednesday, Madrid were inferior again in the rematch, as Ivan Rakitic's delightful chip earned Barcelona a 1-0 win. ""I think it was not a happy performance,"" Mourinho said as a pundit for bEIN Sports. ""It was not the performance of a happy team, of a team with great belief and self-esteem. ""Clearly they are now in a zone after a few bad results, especially after the cup match, where they are in a low. They couldn't bring to the game what I used to call the temperature of the big matches. They were passive. ""I cannot speak about a bad performance, it is just a soft performance. Sometimes you play like this against medium teams and in the end, you get a positive result, but against the top teams you have to do a lot more than this if you want to win."" Former Real Madrid president Roman Calderon has claimed Mourinho will take over in the summer. ""I'm pretty sure he has general information about the club of his passion,"" Mourinho said. ""But he knows more than me because I know absolutely nothing about it at all."" Mourinho also said it was ""very flattering"" to hear Spanish Football Federation president Javier Tebas saying last month La Liga missed coaches like him and Pep Guardiola. Many will see Mourinho's comments as conveniently timed given Solari now appears particularly vulnerable. When Solari took charge in November, Madrid were seven points behind Barcelona but that gap now stands at 12. They have also lost three consecutive games at home for the first time in 15 years. ""Football is about being clinical and they were much more clinical,"" said captain Sergio Ramos. ""It is true with the consistency Barca are showing, they have increased the gap on us again and taken another important step towards winning the league."" Madrid's season, and perhaps Solari's future, will again depend on them winning the Champions League. They carry a 2-1 lead into the second leg at home to Ajax on Tuesday. ""We need the league for fitness and rhythm so we must continue working and keep winning games,"" Ramos said. ""We have another final in the Champions League on Tuesday and we will fight for it. In the league we will try to reduce the gap."""
341,03/03/2019,08:32,Barcelona beat Real Madrid to edge closer to La Liga title,Barcelona won their second Clasico in four days on Saturday and Real Madrid might have to win the Champions League if Santiago Solari is to be in charge for the next one.,"After knocking them out of the Copa del Rey on Wednesday, Barca returned to the Santiago Bernabeu for a 1-0 victory that surely eliminates their greatest rivals from the title race too. Lionel Messi and Sergio Ramos locked heads after Ramos flung an arm into Messi's face but, despite the scoreline and a few half-chances, that was about the most trouble Madrid caused. Messi would have been proud of Ivan Rakitic's delightful chip, a rare moment of precision that in the end settled another Clasico high on vigour but lacking in either real quality or rhythm. ""What we wanted was to deliver our best and to inflict damage on our rival,"" Barca coach Ernesto Valverde said. ""We have done that."" The onus was on Madrid, not only to make amends for their defeat in midweek but to reduce the nine-point gap between them and La Liga's leaders. Instead, Barcelona extended it to 12 and the way their players jumped up and down in front of the away fans after the final whistle suggested they felt this was a major hurdle overcome. Barcelona also now own 96 victories in this fixture to Real Madrid's 95, the first time they have been in front in 87 years. When Solari took over in November, his team were seven points adrift of the Catalans and the fact the deficit has almost doubled since might not reflect the improvement in performances. But this was the first time Madrid have lost three in a row at home in 15 years and these are surely the matches president Florentino Perez will remember when he considers his coach's future next summer. ""You go through spells, sometimes everything goes for you and sometimes it doesn't,"" said Solari. ""In these two games it hasn't."" All that realistically remains now is the Champions League, in which Madrid will carry a 2-1 lead into Tuesday's second leg at home to Ajax. Europe has rescued them before and it also revived Gareth Bale, who endured another frustrating night on only his third start in 10 games. Bale was largely anonymous again and when substituted in the second half, he departed not just to a scattering of whistles from the home crowd but a chorus. ""He tried, like the rest of the players,"" said Solari. It took Busquets 89 seconds to be booked and only a few more for Bale to send the free-kick over the bar but Madrid started with purpose, like a team determined to right the wrongs of before. Their early impetus faded though as Barca, driven on by Messi, took control. Messi skipped through three players in midfield and was furious with Ousmane Dembele when he missed his late run into the box. He then weaved in behind with the help of a Luis Suarez touch but, to everyone's surprise, the trademark lifted finish floated wide. Rakitic showed him how to do it. He played the ball wide to Sergi Roberto, continued his run behind Ramos and received it back, before feathering a delightful chip over Thibaut Courtois. Barca were comfortable but the game erupted on the stroke of half-time. Ramos won the ball from Messi but, with his arm outstretched, left it long enough to catch his opponent in the face. Messi pointed to his lip and then butted heads with Ramos but referee Alberto Mallenco saw nothing worthy of punishment. Madrid pushed for an equaliser but their desperation showed. Benzema failed to connect while Vinicius Juniors' rushed shot was blocked. Bale was hauled off just after the hour, replaced by Marco Asensio, and even Isco came on in the 76th minute, for his longest appearance since the end of January. Raphael Varane might have snatched a late equaliser but his header was weak. Barcelona were left celebrating again."
342,01/03/2019,19:13,Barcelona look to land knock-out blow on Real Madrid,Ernesto Valverde believes Barcelona can inflict a hefty blow to Real Madrid's morale by winning a second Clasico in four days on Saturday.,"Barca knocked Madrid out of the Copa del Rey with a 3-0 victory at the Santiago Bernabeu on Wednesday and will go 12 points clear of their opponents in La Liga if they can repeat the result this weekend. ""It is very difficult in two consecutive matches against the same team to get the same result,"" Valverde said on Friday. ""We want to go for the win because it would be an important blow to their morale for the remaining matches. It would also take points off Madrid, who are a direct rival to us. ""We know it won't be easy. The other day, despite the result, we saw the difficulty of playing there. ""But when one team wins, it is true that what they gain is confidence and the team that loses wants another match as soon as possible to make amends. That is how both teams are at this point."" Madrid, with Vinicius Junior particularly dangerous down the left, created a handful of excellent chances on Wednesday before Barca scored three in the second half. Asked if he had a special plan to contain Vinicius, Valverde said: ""We have a special plan and that is that we have to do it together. He is unpredictable and the other day we had problems. We have to be wary of him, that is obvious."" Vinicius' form has made it harder for Gareth Bale to get in the team but Santiago Solari insisted on Friday that the Welshman is still a key player for Real Madrid. Bale has been a substitute in seven of Madrid's last nine games and his place in the side on Saturday is not guaranteed, after starting on the bench again in midweek. Asked about the importance of players like Bale, Solari said: ""They are still important, titles are won by whole squads. Bale has played in every game since returning from injury and he is scoring goals. He did it in the Club World Cup and in the Champions League final too."" There was a scattering of whistles when Bale came on in the semi-final second leg, after a week in which the Welshman had been heavily criticised in the Spanish press. ""I have nothing to say to the fans,"" Solari said. ""Everyone knows what Bale can do and they know what he has given to the club. The fans express themselves with great respect."" Another win for Barcelona in the Clasico this weekend would all-but end Real Madrid's fading title challenge. ""We are back on our feet,"" said Solari. ""We go into this game with all the enthusiasm and spirit of the previous match, trying to improve what we can, and do again what we did well. We must cut the gap."" Solari said Isco is available again after he recently recovered from a back injury. The midfielder is yet to start a league game since Solari's appointment as coach."
343,01/03/2019,01:09,Barcelona eye double triumph over Real Madrid but defensive doubts remain,"After knocking Real Madrid out of the Copa del Rey, Barcelona now have the opportunity to send their rivals packing in the title race too.","Barca's 3-0 victory on Wednesday means Barca will return to the Santiago Bernabeu on Saturday with a spring in their step, even if Madrid were the better side and had the better opportunities until the chaotic final 30 minutes, when a Luis Suarez double and Raphael Varane own goal gave victory to the Catalans. ""They had more chances in the first half, it's true,"" said Gerard Pique. ""But in the second we knew how to get at them. They left more space and in 10 to 15 minutes we scored three goals."" A repeat this weekend in La Liga would leave Santiago Solari's side 12 points adrift of Barcelona, who would effectively have an extra point's advantage given their superior head-to-head record. That would be a gargantuan gap to make up with 12 games left. Atletico Madrid are closer, seven points back, and they still have to play Barca in April, albeit at the Camp Nou, where they have not won in 18 visits. But there is no doubt bumping Real out of the chase would be a major step for the Catalans. They should feel confident if recent form between the two sides is any guide. The Copa del Rey win was Barcelona's fourth in six games at the Bernabeu and in each of those they have scored three or more. This season alone, their aggregate total against Real reads 9-2. And while Madrid will take heart from the handful of golden opportunities they created, it was their opponents that showed the killer instinct, delivered by players used to producing when it matters most. ""When Luis Suarez is in the area, he is at 200 per cent,"" said Valverde. The question for Barca is also what these showings against the defending European champions say about their own chances in the Champions League. A goalless draw at Lyon in the first leg leaves their last 16 tie delicately poised ahead of the home return next month and if Barca do come through, sterner tests will lie ahead. Suarez's brace on Wednesday continues a timely return to form while Lionel Messi showed against Sevilla last weekend that he is ready to call upon his scintillating best when required. It is in defence where doubts remain. The ease with which Madrid opened Barca up on the counter-attack suggests there is still a vulnerability on the break, which teams in the Champions League will be better placed to exploit. Midfield has been bypassed too easily all season while neither Nelson Semedo nor Sergi Roberto have really convinced at right back. There is still time to tighten up and Samuel Umtiti's return to fitness will be a welcome boost if he can find sharpness before the end of the season. But for those that crave success in the Champions League, more than either La Liga or the Copa del Rey, there is room for improvement. ""We are happy to go through but we have do have to do some things a lot better,"" Valverde said. ""There are important matches to come."" Atletico Madrid play a resurgent Real Sociedad on Sunday while Getafe's surprise challenge for Champions League qualification continues away at Real Betis."
344,01/03/2019,00:01,Rodrigo sends Valencia into Copa final against Barcelona,Valencia set up a Copa del Rey final clash with Barcelona on Thursday as Rodrigo's second-half goal sealed a 1-0 second-leg win over Real Betis at the Mestalla.,"A 2-2 first-leg draw had given Valencia the edge as they looked to deny Betis a home final on May 25, and Marcelino's men put in a solid performance to reach a first major final since winning the competition in 2008. ""We have suffered a lot this season and the team deserved this reward, we have had very difficult moments,"" Marcelino told Spanish television. ""We deserve better than the results show. There have been many draws, a few defeats. We are always competitive."" On-loan Paris Saint-Germain forward Jese Rodriguez came close to netting the crucial opening goal for Betis six minutes before the interval, but was denied by home goalkeeper Jaume Domenech. Marcelino's Valencia struck first in the 56th minute as Kevin Gameiro teed up Rodrigo to lash in his fourth Copa goal of the campaign after his stunning quarter-final hat-trick against Getafe. Betis, who had let a 2-0 lead slip in the first leg, struggled to put Valencia under any pressure, with Loren's late header wide the closest they came as the hosts ran out 3-2 aggregate winners. On Wednesday, Barcelona moved to within one win of a record fifth successive Copa del Rey with a clinical 3-0 victory over Real Madrid in the first of two Clasicos in four days. Real were wasteful at the Santiago Bernabeu as they looked for an aggregate lead after a 1-1 first-leg draw, and a late Luis Suarez double and Raphael Varane's own goal made them pay."
345,22/02/2019,02:40,"Barca, Real Madrid wrestle fatigue and form ahead of Clasico double-header",Real Madrid and Barcelona face two Clasicos in four days next week but La Liga's greatest rivals are not so much revving up for the double-header but crawling reluctantly towards it.,"This weekend, Barca travel to fourth-placed Sevilla on Saturday and Madrid to Levante on Sunday, when priorities, rest and rotation will all be high on the agenda again. Santiago Solari pointed to exhaustion following his team's latest loss at home to Girona, four days after they came from behind to beat Ajax, eight after defeating Atletico Madrid and 11 after holding Barca to a draw at the Camp Nou. ""The fatigue is not only physical, it is mental, it affects our concentration,"" Solari said. ""Obviously we have come from an important period, with a lot of hard games. We have to overcome it because it might be that our energy levels dipped in the second half."" Girona were outplayed in the first period but scored twice in the second, both goals coming in the final 25 minutes, to end what had begun to look like a serious Real resurgence in the title race. Instead, Barcelona now own a nine-pont cushion over Real, seven over Atletico, and even if that lead is dented this weekend, there remains room for error ahead of the league game at the Santiago Bernabeu. By then, the two clubs will already have squared off in the second leg of the Copa del Rey semi-final, in the same stadium, where Madrid's motivation might be greater given Barca have won the cup four times in a row. The dilemma for Solari is that preserving key players against Levante risks another slip which, combined with Barca winning at Sevilla, would surely spell the end of any fading title hopes. ""We will continue fighting on all three fronts that we have open,"" Solari said. ""We have to keep trying to reduce the gap."" The most disappointing aspect of their defeat to Girona was that Barcelona have been stumbling themselves, a stodgy 1-0 win over Real Valladolid doing little to restore confidence after three consecutive draws. A stalemate away to Lyon in the Champions League on Tuesday should not prove too damaging to their chances of progress but Barca have now scored only twice in four matches. Luis Suarez has lost form and Lionel Messi appears yet to have regained full fitness. ""I would worry if we did not create any chances,"" coach Ernesto Valverde said in France. ""Football is all about results. But I get more nervous if the opposition are missing chances."" Valverde has more wiggle room than Solari, both in the league, due to his team's healthy advantage, and the cup, which comes a distant third this season in the club's list of priorities. Messi could even sit out any, or all, of the next three games in a bid to be sharp for the business end of calendar. But momentum is on the line too. Defeat to Sevilla would swell the sense of a dip while succumbing to Real, in either match, let alone both, could knock morale just as much as it might boost their opponents´. Perhaps most buoyant are Atletico Madrid, fresh from their 2-0 triumph over Juventus at a bouncing Wanda Metropolitano on Wednesday. Diego Costa was busy on his first start in almost three months but Alvaro Morata impressed off the bench. A front three with Antoine Griezmann could compromise the Frenchman's attacking freedom, which leaves Diego Simeone with his own selection problem ahead of Saturday's game at home to Villarreal. Sevilla have managed only one win in their last eight league games and could drop out of the top four if they are beaten by Barcelona."
346,20/02/2019,15:37,Three Lyon players become latest victims of game-time burglaries,"Three Lyon players were burgled while their club was playing Barcelona in the Champions League, continuing a recent pattern for players and officials at big French clubs.","Police said they were called at 0045 on Wednesday morning to the home of attacker Memphis Depay, in the Lyon suburb of Ecully. Thieves had forced a window and took goods, mostly fashion items, of an unspecified value. Depay had already been burgled last September, while Lyon were playing Nice. On that occasion property worth more than one million euros was taken. Midfielders Lucas Tousart and Pape Cheikh Diop, who both came off the Lyon bench in the second half of the goalless draw, returned to their homes in the suburbs to the same unpleasant surprise. Thieves broke down a basement door at Tousart's home in Chaponost and took a bag and ""multimedia"". There were also signs that thieves tried to break into his car, said the local gendarmerie. Burglars broke in through Cheikh's terrace in Limonest and stole jewels and branded clothing. Officials and players in Marseille and Paris have also been the targets during games in recent months. The home of Marseille president Jacques-Henri Eyraud was robbed during the night of February 8 while he was in Dijon watching the team in Ligue 1. Forward Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting's house was broken into twice: once while PSG were playing in November and again in December by burglars who fled when they set off the alarm. PSG captain Thiago Silva was burgled in December while playing at the Parc des Princes. In December 2017, the Paris apartment of then-PSG coach Unai Emery was robbed as his team played Strasbourg."
347,20/02/2019,12:47,Concern for misfiring Suarez as goals dry up for Barcelona,"The image of a frustrated Lionel Messi with his hands on his hips in Barcelona's 0-0 Champions League draw in Lyon on Tuesday may reverberate the most around the world, but it is Luis Suarez's form in front of goal that is causing most concern in Catalonia.","Suarez laboured throughout much of the Champions League last 16, first leg in France, although he came as close as anyone to scoring for Barcelona when he fired just wide from a Jordi Alba cutback 20 minutes from time. Barca's recent struggles away from home at the business end of the Champions League go on -- it is now six matches without an away win in the knockout rounds, with just one goal scored in that time, since beating Arsenal 2-0 three years ago. Suarez, meanwhile, has now gone 16 away matches without scoring in the competition since a draw at Roma in the group stage in 2015. That adds up to more than 24 hours in total. ""I'd be worried if he were not creating chances, but he has always had chances, he creates them for his teammates, and he is a constant headache for opponents,"" said coach Ernesto Valverde in defence of the 32-year-old. Suarez has 16 goals in all competitions this season, but only one in his team's last eight matches. ""Maybe he is saving them for the games to come,"" added Valverde. The performance has added to the worries back in Catalonia, with Barcelona ""unable to translate their overwhelming dominance into a goal"", as the daily Sport put it on Wednesday. They had 24 attempts at goal, but just five were on target. ""Nobody had the punch, precision, sharpness or clarity to kill the game,"" said El Pais, with Barcelona ""victims of a negative run, all blinded, including the infallible Messi. It's a mystery"". It is not just their away form in Europe that is an issue -- Valverde's team have now won just one of their last five matches, drawing the other four. They have scored just once in their last three outings, and that was a Messi penalty against Valladolid last weekend. While drawing against a Lyon side deprived of their World Cup-winning captain Nabil Fekir due to suspension could be seen as a missed opportunity, the result also needs to be put into context. Lyon had already taken four points from Manchester City in the group stage and recently beat Paris Saint-Germain in Ligue 1. They have not lost in Europe this season. Barcelona should still finish the job in the return at the Camp Nou on March 13. After all, of their last 29 home matches in the competition, they have won 26 and drawn three, losing none. Messi -- who made his 130th Champions League appearance on Tuesday, equalling Andres Iniesta's tally of games in the competition -- has not been at his majestic best in the last couple of weeks, but he has scored 30 goals this season. It would be wrong to question him, but fatigue has to be a worry for the Argentine and his team. Tuesday's game was Barca's 13th in 2019 in all competitions, and this is an ageing side. While a young Lyon team featured nine players aged between 20 and 25, Barcelona fielded five players in their 30s at the Groupama Stadium. All of them -- Gerard Pique, Sergio Busquets, Ivan Rakitic, Messi and Suarez -- are vital, and Valverde needs them at their best in the weeks ahead. There are two trips to Real Madrid to come in the next 10 days, one in the Copa del Rey and one in La Liga. An eighth league title in 11 seasons seems likely, but there is work to be done if they are to be the side to end Madrid's recent dominance in the Champions League, starting up front."
348,20/02/2019,00:10,Valverde finds positives as Barcelona draw blank in Lyon to leave tie open,Barcelona coach Ernesto Valverde shrugged off his team's struggles in front of goal after they were held to a 0-0 draw away at Lyon in the first leg of their Champions League last-16 tie on Tuesday.,"The Spanish side had most of the chances at the Groupama Stadium, with Luis Suarez firing just wide in the second half, although it was Lyon who came the closest when Martin Terrier hit the bar early on. Lionel Messi and co. were once again left frustrated on the road at the business end of the competition, and have now gone six away matches without winning in the Champions League knockout rounds, scoring just a single goal in that time. It is a run that goes back three years. Desperate to end Real Madrid's recent European dominance, Barca must now finish the job when the teams meet again at the Camp Nou on March 13, but Lyon remain in the tie. Barcelona's form needs to improve between now and then, though -- they have drawn four of their last five matches in all, and have scored just once, from a penalty, in their last three outings. ""We played good football, but you have to hit the target as well, and we didn't,"" Valverde said. ""We are on the right road, though, and the tie is still up in the air. We will try to win it in front of our fans."" He added: ""I am not happy with the result, but I am happy with the performance and with what we created. ""We didn't score, but that is how it is. It is not easy to win away from home in the Champions League."" The visitors -- who started with Sergi Roberto in midfield rather than the out-of-form Philippe Coutinho -- had good reason to be wary of their hosts, who have excelled in big games this season. Bruno Genesio's team had taken four points from a possible six against Manchester City in the group stage and recently won at home to Paris Saint-Germain in Ligue 1. They are still unbeaten in Europe this season, although this was their sixth consecutive draw. ""It's a satisfying result because it leaves us with a chance for the second leg, and we didn't concede. If we can score at the Camp Nou we'll have a chance of going through,"" said Genesio. He admitted that he had hoped for an even better performance, but Lyon were missing their World Cup-winning captain Nabil Fekir due to suspension here. It was the 21-year-old Terrier who surprisingly started in his place, and he delivered the most exciting moment of the first half for the crowd of almost 58,000 with a thunderous strike from 20 yards out in the ninth minute that was tipped onto the bar by Marc-Andre ter Stegen. The same player later shot over at the end of a fantastic move, while Houssem Aouar had earlier been denied by the goalkeeper, but it was Barcelona who enjoyed the longer spells of possession. Ousmane Dembele -- one of two Frenchmen in the away line-up -- came closest for them in the first half, although their best chances came after he had been replaced by Coutinho midway through the second period. Suarez came within inches of breaking the deadlock 20 minutes from time, firing narrowly wide from Jordi Alba's cutback. He has now gone 16 away matches without scoring in the competition. Coutinho had a powerful shot beaten away by Anthony Lopes, with the Lyon goalkeeper also frustrating Messi and Sergio Busquets as Barcelona dominated but departed without a potentially precious away goal. ""It is a little bit of a disappointment, but there is still the second leg to come and we hope to do better,"" said defender Clement Lenglet. At least they extended their unbeaten record against Lyon to seven matches, but there remains hope for the French club ahead of the return."
349,19/02/2019,23:04,Barcelona draw blank as Champions League stalemate gives Lyon hope,"Barcelona will hope to make home advantage count in the return after Lionel Messi and his team-mates drew a blank in Lyon on Tuesday, the first leg of their Champions League last-16 tie ending in a goalless stalemate.","The Spanish side had most of the chances at the Groupama Stadium, with Luis Suarez firing just wide in the second half, but it was Lyon who came the closest when Martin Terrier hit the bar early on. Ernesto Valverde's side once again left frustrated on the road at the business end of the competition, and have now gone six away matches without winning in the Champions League knockout rounds, scoring just a single goal in that time. It is a run that goes back three years. Desperate to end Real Madrid's recent European dominance, Barca must now finish the job when the teams meet again at the Camp Nou on March 13, but Lyon remain very much in the tie. Barcelona's form needs to improve between now and then, though -- the Catalans have drawn four of their last five matches in all, and have scored just once, from a penalty, in their last three outings. With Arthur missing due to injury, Valverde opted to play Sergi Roberto in midfield here, leaving the out-of-form Philippe Coutinho on the bench alongside Arturo Vidal. That may have been an acknowledgement that the visitors were wary of Lyon's flying left-back Ferland Mendy, who has been linked with Barca in some quarters. The visitors were certainly right to be wary of a Lyon side whose best performances this season have come against the big boys -- four points from a possible six against Manchester City in the group stage and a recent win at home to Paris Saint-Germain in Ligue 1. The French club were without their World Cup-winning captain Nabil Fekir due to suspension though, and it was the 21-year-old Terrier who was surprisingly handed a start in his place. Terrier is an unassuming talent, but he delivered the most exciting moment of the first half for the crowd of almost 58,000 with a thunderous strike from 20 yards out in the ninth minute that was tipped onto the bar by Marc-Andre ter Stegen. The same player later shot well over at the end of a fantastic move from the home side, while Houssem Aouar had earlier been denied by the goalkeeper, but it was Barcelona who enjoyed the longer spells of possession. The Catalans looked more assured on the ball, at least until they reached the Lyon penalty area. Ousmane Dembele -- one of two Frenchmen in the away line-up -- came closest for them in the first half, but their best chances came after he had been replaced by Coutinho midway through the second period. Suarez came within inches of breaking the deadlock 20 minutes from the end, firing narrowly wide with a first-time shot from Jordi Alba's cutback. Coutinho then had a powerful shot beaten away by Anthony Lopes, with the Lyon goalkeeper also frustrating Messi and Sergio Busquets as Barcelona dominated but departed without a potentially precious away goal. At least they extended their unbeaten record against Lyon to seven matches, but there is still hope for the French club ahead of the return."
350,18/02/2019,20:08,Valverde calls on Barcelona to overcome away-day challenge in Champions League,Barcelona coach Ernesto Valverde hopes his team have learned the lessons of last year' humiliation in Rome as they look for a rare win on the road in the Champions League in Tuesday's clash with Lyon.,"The Spanish champions are in France for the first leg of their last-16 tie, their first knockout match in the competition since their shock collapse in last season's quarter-finals. Then, Barcelona lost 3-0 away to Roma to bow out on away goals after winning 4-1 in the first leg at home. They have not won any of their last five away games in the Champions League knockout rounds, losing four of them while scoring just once and conceding 13 goals. ""It shows that it is a hard competition, but challenges are there to be overcome,"" said Valverde at a press conference at Lyon's Groupama Stadium on Monday. He pointed out that his team had performed well on the road in this season's group stage, taking seven points from a possible nine and notably beating Tottenham Hotspur 4-2 at Wembley. ""It was also said that we couldn't score goals but we have done that this season against difficult opponents like Tottenham and Inter."" The humiliation against Roma last season clouded Valverde's debut campaign in charge at the Camp Nou, despite the Catalans winning a domestic double. But they came into this season spurred on by a desire to end Real Madrid's recent dominance in Europe as they look to lift the Champions League trophy for the first time since 2015. ""When we came into that match (against Roma), I remember everyone telling us they were the best opponents for us, that they were the weakest side, but that did not help us,"" Valverde added. ""We need to come into these games not with our guard down but with our guard up."" Barcelona come to France having lost just twice in the last three months, and both losses came in Copa del Rey ties they eventually won over two legs. Their recent performances have been patchy, however, with three straight draws preceding Saturday's laboured 1-0 win over Valladolid, secured thanks to a Lionel Messi penalty. ""Our problem has always been away from home, but it also depends on the order of the two legs,"" said midfielder Sergio Busquets, who played when Barcelona drew 1-1 in Lyon at this stage 10 years ago, on the way to a 6-3 aggregate victory. ""We know how to suffer, which you have to do in every game, especially in the Champions League."" The return will be at the Camp Nou on March 13, and Busquets added: ""You get chances in every game, and we need to try to improve on previous years and get a good result for the second leg."""
351,18/02/2019,18:08,Man City match-ups give Lyon inspiration ahead of Barcelona clash,"Lyon coach Bruno Genesio says his team's performances against Manchester City in the group stage prove they can compete with Barcelona in Tuesday's Champions League last 16, first leg.","The French club are in the knockout phase of the competition for the first time in seven years after emerging from their group unbeaten. They beat Pep Guardiola's City side 2-1 away before a 2-2 home draw with the Premier League leaders. ""They are two teams who have the same way of playing -- they like to have possession of the ball, and they like to attack,"" Genesio said at a press conference at Lyon's Groupama Stadium on Monday. ""The experience can help us -- we played really well in the two games against City, and if we were capable of doing it against them, we can do it again."" An inconsistent Lyon side are often their own worst enemy, and they are a huge 16 points behind Ligue 1 leaders Paris Saint-Germain in third place, having played two games more. However, they are the only team in the league to have beaten PSG this season, winning 2-1 at home earlier this month. That was after they lost 5-0 in Paris back in October despite being the better team for long spells. ""Even in Paris we managed to raise our game against a Champions League side,"" Genesio pointed out. ""We need to have confidence and belief as well, but I think Barcelona will raise their game compared to recent matches."" Lyon's biggest problem is that captain Nabil Fekir will miss the first leg. The World Cup winner scored the goal that gave them a 1-1 draw at Shakhtar Donetsk in their last group game to take them through, but a booking a few minutes later means he is suspended here. ""Nabil is our captain and our leader from a technical viewpoint, so obviously it is difficult,"" Genesio said. ""He is capable of being decisive and often performs very well in these games, but being a team is also about coping with absences and having players who can take his place. We will do what we can in the absence of Nabil."" Genesio also admitted that there are doubts surrounding the fitness of both Jason Denayer and Tanguy Ndombele. Belgian defender Denayer suffered an adductor injury in Friday's 2-1 win over Guingamp in Ligue 1, while French international Ndombele -- a vital presence in midfield -- has been struggling with an ankle problem and did not play at the weekend. ""In my head my starting line-up is clear, but what the doctors tell me might make me change my mind,"" the coach added."
352,17/02/2019,15:07,Umtiti set for Barcelona return against Lyon,Samuel Umtiti is set to make his long-awaited return from injury after Barcelona named him in the squad on Sunday to face Lyon in the Champions League.,"A knee problem has caused Umtiti to play only once in almost five months but the defender resumed training at the end of January and has been included in Barca's squad for the trip to Lyon on Tuesday. Umtiti is unlikely to start the first leg against his former club but his availability is a plus for coach Ernesto Valverde, with difficult fixtures to come. After Lyon, Barcelona face a trip to Sevilla in La Liga before two Clasicos in four days, the first in the Copa del Rey and the second in the league, both at the Santiago Bernabeu. Umtiti's absence left Barca short in central defence. They signed Jeison Murillo on loan from Valencia in January while Jean-Clair Todibo's summer move from Toulouse was also brought forward."
353,17/02/2019,13:39,Neymar's father denies any contact with Barca over return,Neymar's father reiterated on Sunday that there has been no attempt to contact Barcelona over a possible return to Spain for the world's most expensive player.,"Neymar joined Paris Saint-Germain for a world record fee of 222 million euros ($251 million) in August 2017 but has repeatedly been linked with a move back to Barcelona. ""Barca are a huge club, we were very happy over there,"" Neymar Sr told TF1 on Sunday. ""It's impossible to leave a player like him out of these (transfer market) rumours. But it's a lie, there hasn't been a call with Barca."" ""There are two people who speak for Neymar: himself and me. Neither of us has spoken about this intention to return to Barcelona,"" he added. ""These rumours amuse us a lot. These journalists are funny. The future is in Paris, the present is in Paris."" Neymar Sr took to social media last month to brand a report in Spain which claimed he had begged Barca to re-sign his son from PSG as ""fake news"". The Brazilian forward is currently on the sidelines after he was ruled out for 10 weeks with a metatarsal injury suffered in a French Cup win over Strasbourg on January 23. PSG hope the 27-year-old, who suffered a fracture to the same right foot at the end of February last year, will be back in time for a potential Champions League quarter-final. The French club hold a 2-0 lead over Manchester United ahead of the return leg at the Parc des Princes in their last-16 tie. Neymar Sr also called on referees in France to offer his son more protection. ""It's not the French league that is the problem, it's the referees who must protect the players,"" he said. ""If fouls aren't whistled, if unsporting behaviour goes unpunished... that's the problem."""
354,27/01/2019,22:49,Bale back with a bang as 10-man Madrid beat Espanyol,Gareth Bale needed just two minutes to mark his return from injury with a goal as 10-man Real Madrid held on for a 4-2 victory over Espanyol on Sunday.,"Bale had been out since January 3 with a calf strain but made an instant impact off the bench at the RCDE Stadium, where Karim Benzema continued his own rich vein of form by scoring twice. Sergio Ramos was also on target with a brilliant header before Leo Baptistao kept Espanyol in sight. Bale and Benzema seemed to have wrapped things up but Raphael Varane was sent off with 18 minutes left and substitute Roberto Rosales drove in to set up a nervy finish. Madrid, however, survived for their fifth win in sixth matches, even if it was only enough to restore the 10-point difference behind Barcelona, who had earlier seen off Girona 2-0, with Lionel Messi scoring a sublime chip. They may not be closing the gap on the league leaders but Madrid are gaining momentum, with the resumption of the Champions League just around the corner. Benzema now has 15 goals this season and his first was a simple finish in the third minute, as he pounced on a rebound from Luka Modric's shot. Ramos is their second top scorer with 10, his excellent header looping into the far corner, before Baptistao gave Espanyol a lifeline with an emphatic shot from the edge of the area. But Benzema added a third on the stroke of half-time and when Bale, after replacing Vinicius Junior, made it four, it looked like the game was up. Instead, Varane was sent off for bringing down Pablo Piatti as the last man and Rosales set Madrid's nerves jangling by chesting and volleying past Thibaut Courtois with nine minutes left. Madrid held on and while Benzema's surge, and Bale's fitness, could yet prove key to their second half of the season, particularly in the Champions League, in La Liga it is Messi, and Barca who lead the way. Messi's brilliant chip, his ninth goal in as many games, came after Nelson Semedo had given them an early lead, before Bernardo Espinosa's red card consigned Girona to 39 minutes with 10 men. The home fans were left incensed by that decision, as well as Messi's reaction they believed caused it, but the Argentinian's goal offered the perfect riposte. ""We struggled in the first half a bit but after the red card we had to dominate the game,"" Barca coach Ernesto Valverde said. ""It was a tough match, they pushed us a lot."" Outside the stadium before kick-off, propped up on a railing, was a sign with an ironic message scrawled: ""Miami, here we come"". La Liga had hoped to drag this game across the Atlantic to promote Spanish football and the two clubs had supported the idea, with various perks dangled in front of fans, including free flights and tickets, not to mention the chance to be part of something ""historic"". The setting probably would have made little difference to the result - just the integrity of the competition - given Girona, now 14th, are without a win in 10 matches while Barca have managed eight league victories in a row. Girona hustled and harried their opponents in the opening minutes but Semedo's goal was soft as they failed to clear three times before he swept the ball home with his left foot. Barca could have made it two, only for Philippe Coutinho to hit the goalkeeper. It was one of a handful of underwhelming moments from Coutinho, whose tepid display will have done little to assauge his doubters. Girona grew into the game but any momentum was checked shortly after half-time as Espinosa caught Suarez from behind and, after protests from Messi, was shown a second yellow card. Messi was jeered and for a while the fury spurred Girona on. But he had the final say as Luis Suarez threaded through Jordi Alba, who squared to him. Out rushed Yassine Bounou but Messi's scoop was so good, even the diving Porro was powerless to keep it out. Some of Girona's fans, previously enraged, now stood up to applaud."
355,26/01/2019,16:29,Atletico the greatest threat to Barca's La Liga hopes - Valverde,Barcelona coach Ernesto Valverde has admitted he views Atletico Madrid as a greater threat to his side winning La Liga this season than Real Madrid.,"Atletico, who play Getafe on Saturday, sit five points behind Barca in the table while Real's stuttering campaign means they are already 10 adrift of the league leaders. Real have shown signs of a return to form in recent weeks, having won four out of their last five matches, including an impressive victory over Sevilla. Sevilla sit third, ahead of Real on goal difference, but after playing a game more. ""We look more at who is immediately behind us,"" Valverde said at a press conference on Saturday. ""I value both Atletico and Real Madrid very highly because one is a great team and the other never gives up. But you have to look more at the one that is five points behind."" Barcelona have made four signings in the January transfer window, their latest move a 75-million-euro ($85.5 million) deal for Ajax midfielder Frenkie de Jong, who will arrive in July. De Jong has said he spoke to both Manchester City coach Pep Guardiola and Paris Saint-Germain's Thomas Tuchel before making his decision, but not Valverde. ""You cannot talk to a player who has a contract elsewhere and it's not my way of doing things,"" Valverde said. ""I have nothing more to say about it."" Kevin Prince-Boateng has also arrived from Sassuolo and Jeison Murillo from Valencia, each on loan, while Jean-Clair Todibo has agreed to join from Toulouse next summer. Asked if he has the final say on signings, Valverde said: ""I talk to the technical committee and we have normal conversations. I never speak in absolute terms, that someone has to come, no ifs or buts. We speak generally and talk about options."" Valverde has admitted the club could allow fringe players to leave this month, with Denis Suarez and Malcom both linked with moves away. Suarez was dropped from the squad to face Sevilla in the Copa del Rey on Wednesday to make way for Boateng, while Malcom started, but struggled, and came off after 63 minutes. Both are in the squad to face Girona. ""He has many qualities,"" said Valverde, speaking about Malcom. ""He is direct and can make something happen. ""He has to be more aggressive and have more consistency in his game. Nothing is missing but there are others who play and you have to choose between them all."" Barcelona's game against Girona at Montilivi on Sunday had been the fixture identified by La Liga to be played in the United States. The plan, however, fell through due to a lack of support from governing bodies like FIFA and the Spanish FA (RFEF), although both Barca and Girona had supported the idea. ""I saw it as a distant option,"" Valverde said. ""They had to fulfil conditions for it to be played in Miami that in the end were not fulfilled. ""We were willing to play where they said, it was not important to us and I didn't lose sleep about it. We will see in the future."" Ousmane Dembele will miss the game this weekend with an ankle injury while Samuel Umtiti is still recovering from a knee problem. Rafinha is also out with a ruptured cruciate ligament."

""While there is the possibility, a shred of hope, we ask that you please #NoDejenDeBuscar (don't stop searching) for Emiliano.

Messi's plea comes after Sala's father and other players, including Bordeaux's Valentin Vada and Leganes' Uruguayan attacker Diego Rolan, begged authorities to continue the search. Sala's family have asked that Nantes not to commemorate their former teammate at this weekend's French Cup clash with third-tier Entente Sannois Saint-Gratien. ""We ask you to respect the family who absolutely refuse to talk about mourning and ask us to keep believing,"" Nantes captain Valentin Rongier told more than 300 Nantes fans who came to an open training session on Thursday. ""It is for this reason that we are not going to have a minute's silence or a minute's applause because we still have hope."""
357,25/01/2019,12:25,Barcelona transfer flurry leaves modest Madrid in the shade,The January transfer window is supposedly a market for desperate buyers but Barcelona sit five points clear at the top of La Liga and have made more signings than any other team in the division.,"On Monday, it was Kevin-Prince Boateng doing kick-ups at the Camp Nou and three days later came Frenkie de Jong, the 21-year-old Dutch midfielder for whom Barca will pay Ajax 75 million euros ($85 million), with a further 11 million euros due in add-ons. ""In De Jong, we add talent, youth and a player with Barca style,"" said president Josep Maria Bartomeu. ""He will be a key player in the next few years."" Boateng and De Jong, who will join in July, follow Jeison Murillo from Valencia, a central defender for the present, and Jean-Clair Todibo from Toulouse, another to mould for the future, who will also arrive in the summer. Barcelona go up against Catalan neighbours Girona on Sunday and a few hours later, less than 70 miles away, Real Madrid play Espanyol. Madrid's most expensive player will be Vinicius Junior, the 18-year-old signed for 45 million euros last summer. Gareth Bale, who is injured, is the only one more costly and they signed him six years ago. Since then, the European champions have spent more than 50 million euros just once, on James Rodriguez, who is now on loan at Bayern Munich and not expected to return. Barca have smashed that total five times in the same period, twice more than doubling it, to bring in Philippe Coutinho and Ousmane Dembele. Those deals were propped up by the sale of Neymar, which helped the club announce record revenues of 914 million euros for last season. They predict another jump to 960 million this term. But Real's finances are also in good shape. They expect to report figures of 752 million euros for 2018-19, with their president Florentino Perez confident his club can be the first to reach a billion. ""The only way to remain independent is to be financially healthy,"" Perez said in September. ""That is the base of our sporting success."" Perhaps Madrid's reduced transfer spending is due to planned improvements to their Santiago Bernabeu home, for which a 575 million euro loan will be taken out. But Perez has insisted it will not impact the team, while Barcelona are also upgrading the Camp Nou, at a cost of 400 million euros. Perez could instead be keeping his pockets full for a fresh tilt at Neymar next summer, with the Brazilian's future at Paris Saint-Germain seemingly uncertain. Neymar would be the kind of star name to fill the void left by Cristiano Ronaldo and there would be added satisfaction in bringing back the player that trained at Valdebebas as a 14-year-old, only to sign for Barcelona when he was 21. In recent years, Madrid's strategy has been to target youth. ""We are strengthening our search for young players that will become the next great players of the sport,"" Perez said in July. But, despite their historic success in Europe, Barca's splurge must make them nervous. Key players have shows signs of age or left, Neymar remains at Paris Saint-Germain and the Catalans are 10 points ahead, firmly on course to win their eighth La Liga title in 11 seasons. ""We have to get closer to the top,"" coach Santiago Solari said on Thursday. Madrid could save face by winning the Champions League again but the task will be harder this year without Ronaldo, who scored 15 goals en route to them hoisting the trophy in May. Perez also failed to replace him last summer. Atletico Madrid, Barca's closest challengers, are expected to complete a deal for Chelsea's Alvaro Morata this month but not before Saturday's game at home to Getafe. Sevilla, in fourth, play at home to Levante."

359,24/01/2019,00:07,Barcelona left with mountain to climb after cup defeat by Sevilla,Barcelona's hopes of winning a fifth consecutive Copa del Rey were dented on Wednesday as they were beaten 2-0 by Sevilla in the first leg of the quarter-finals.,"Lionel Messi was rested and Luis Suarez left on the bench as Kevin-Prince Boateng made his debut for Barca in a match that Sevilla might even have been disappointed not to win by more. Even so, Pablo Sarabia and Wissam Ben Yedder each scored in the second half at the Ramon Sanchez Pizjuan to leave their opponents facing an uphill task if they are to rescue next week's second leg. ""We played a great game, it's a shame it doesn't settle the tie,"" said Sevilla coach Pablo Machin. ""In Barcelona, anything can happen. They have turned around bigger defeats than this."" Ben Yedder celebrated his goal by unveiling a t-shirt in support of Argentine striker Emiliano Sala, the player who is feared to have died in a plane crash on his way to join new club Cardiff City in Wales. ""Para mi hermano fuerza E. Sala"", the message read, meaning, ""For my brother, be strong"". Barcelona had thrashed Sevilla 5-0 in last year's final, when Andres Iniesta delivered a masterclass in what was one of his final appearances for the club. Winning a domestic double, however, did little to ease the disappointment of crashing out of the Champions League and Ernesto Valverde is clearly keener to rotate in the Copa del Rey this season. Messi and Sergio Busquets were left out completely while Luis Suarez, Philippe Coutinho and Jordi Alba all started on the bench, only to come on as substitutes in the second half. ""I thought it was for the best,"" Valverde said. ""But when you make changes you take risks."" Boateng, who has joined on a six-month loan deal from Sassuolo, was signed to spare Suarez nights like these and he did little particularly wrong, or spectacular, before being replaced after 63 minutes. Barca's biggest signing of the transfer window was announced three and a half hours before kick-off, a 75-million euro deal for Frenkie de Jong to join from Ajax in the summer. ""He is an exciting signing for the club,"" Valverde said. ""He is for both the future and the present."" They could have done with some of the 21-year-old's craft in the first half, which was high on intensity but low on precision as both sides traded blows but failed to create much of note. A quick free-kick sent Ben Yedder free and he fooled the sliding Gerard Pique with a dummy only to shoot wide, off-balance. Barca's best early chance fell to the out-of-sorts Malcom but he took the ball too far left after nipping round Juan Soriano and hit the side-netting. Sevilla had been the better team and their dominance continued after half-time. Just before the hour-mark, they scored, as the lively Quincy Promes did brilliantly down the left and his cross fell to Sarabia at the back post. Sarabia's drilled the bouncing ball into the far corner, with the offside Ibrahim Amadou darting across Jasper Cillessen's line of sight. Barca brought on Suarez and Coutinho, who almost made an instant impact. Suarez's first contribution was to lose the ball and his second was to win it back. Coutinho was given a free shot at goal but fired over. Sevilla could have made it two but Ever Banega headed over and then they did, as his cross grazed Sergi Roberto on its way to the back post, where Ben Yedder had timed his run perfectly. He slid in to bolster his team's advantage."

The 31-year-old is the club's second January signing after defender Jeison Murillo also joined on loan from Valencia. ""I don't believe there will be any more arrivals,"" Valverde said at a press conference on Tuesday. ""Although of course you can never be 100 percent sure."" However, Valverde admitted Denis Suarez could be allowed to leave and also appeared unsure about the future of Malcom. ""It's true, it's possible Denis will leave but I don't know what will happen,"" Valverde said. On Malcom, he added: ""Until the 31st (of January) we can't say anything for sure but we are not going to be left short of players. He has to fight to play more. We expect a lot from him."" Boateng will provide cover up front for Luis Suarez and Lionel Messi after Munir El Haddadi was sold to Sevilla earlier this month. Barcelona have already played 31 games this season and, as well as leading the title race in La Liga, are into the latter stages of the Champions League and Copa del Rey. ""I have not talked to the coach,"" Boateng said at a press conference earlier on Tuesday. ""But I know I have not come to play in the starting line-up because there are incredible players in this team. I'm here because of my experience and to help."" Valverde later confirmed the plan will be for Boateng to provide cover for Suarez. ""He has been brought in above all as a number 9,"" Valverde said. ""In case there is a problem with Luis Suarez."" Boateng, who turns 32 in March, has represented 10 different clubs including AC Milan, Borussia Dortmund, Tottenham and Portsmouth. He also has experience of La Liga, having spent a season at La Palmas in 2016-17. Deployed more as an attacking midfielder earlier in his career, he believes he is now best suited to the role of striker. ""At my age, the role of number nine is perfect for me,"" he said. ""I think it's a plus that I can play in different positions but I feel very comfortable as a number nine."" Boateng added: ""I'm here to play well and to try to stay for more years here. That's my goal."" Alongside Boateng was Barcelona's sporting director Eric Abidal, who was asked about the club's pursuit of Ajax midfielder Frenkie de Jong. The 21-year-old is considered one of the most talented youngsters in Europe. ""This question has to be asked to the player, he knows there is interest from many clubs and he will make his decision,"" Abidal said. ""We can only wait, like everyone else."" Barcelona play Sevilla in the first leg of the Copa del Rey quarter-finals on Wednesday, after beting Leganes in controversial circumstances last week. Leganes claim Barca defender Juan Brandariz ""Chumi"", who played in the first leg, should have been suspended. The Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) have rejected the appeal but Leganes said on Monday they plan to take the case to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS). ""It is not in our hands,"" Valverde said. ""We have done what we thought we should do, the law is there and we prepared for the game. I do not have much to say about it."""

""The agreement includes an eight-million-euro ($9 million) purchase option,"" the club said. The arrival of Boateng, 31, will provide much-needed cover for Luis Suarez up front in Ernesto Valverde's squad following the departure of Munir El Haddadi to Sevilla. The fiery forward has been a successful stopgap many times before, which Barca boss Ernesto Valverde valued in his decision to bring him in. ""He doesn't seem to need much time to adapt, he knows his stuff and can start playing straight away,"" Valverde. ""He's comfortable in many positions, as a central striker or playing off another striker, and even deeper too,"" Valverde told the club website. The player himself was upbeat about the move when journalists spoke to him at the airport in Italy. ""Barça, I'm coming! I'm sad to leave Sassuolo but this is a great chance,"" Boateng said, according to a SKY Twitter feed. ""But don't ask me about Real Madrid. I only want to focus on Barcelona and I hope to score at Bernabéu for the next Clásico,"" Boateng said. The player will be presented to press and fans Tuesday at noon on the Camp Nou pitch, the club revealed. Born in Germany, the half-brother of Bayern Munich defender Jerome Boateng moved back to Serie A last year after helping Eintracht Frankfurt win the German Cup. He has scored five goals in 15 games this season for Sassuolo. ""With experience of playing in four of the biggest leagues in Europe, the Premier League, the Bundesliga, Serie A and La Liga, he is a man who has scored goals wherever he has been,"" FC Barcelona said. The former Tottenham Hotspur, AC Milan and Schalke 04 player has previously had a spell in Spain, with Las Palmas in 2016-17."

365,05/01/2019,16:36,"Umtiti close to Barca return, says Valverde","Barcelona defender Samuel Umtiti could resume training this month, coach Ernesto Valverde said on Saturday.","World cup winner Umtiti has struggled with a knee injury since the start of the season and, in December, began a programme in Qatar to help his recovery. He has played only eight games this campaign, the last against Atletico Madrid on November 24. Valverde, however, is hopeful the Frenchman could soon make a return. ""We think that in a couple of weeks he can start training again with the team, we'll see how things are going,"" Valverde said at a press conference. ""I always try to be optimistic and I would like that to happen. I think he has positive feelings, let's see."" Umtiti's absence has left Barca short in central defence, with Thomas Vermaelen also injured for much of the season so far. The club have signed Jeison Murillo on loan from Valencia to provide cover for Gerard Pique and Clement Lenglet, currently the only two fit centre-backs. ""Our idea was that Jeison would be available as soon as possible and he knows the league,"" Valverde said. ""He's going to have to play and we hope to see the best of him,"" he added. Valverde's own future remains uncertain, despite Barcelona sitting top of La Liga, three points clear of Atletico Madrid. His two-year contract expires in the summer and while there is an option to extend by another year, a decision has not yet been taken. ""It is true the contract was for two years plus one and at the end of the season it is necessary to decide,"" Valverde said. ""We will discuss it later, we are not even halfway through the season. There has always been a good relationship. If you lose one game, you are in trouble here but I have a contract with Barca."" Barcelona begin 2019 with a tough trip to Getafe on Sunday, who sit seventh in La Liga, boasting a defensive record bettered only by Atletico Madrid. Real Madrid, meanwhile, are now seven points adrift of the top but Valverde refused to rule them out of the title race. ""We still consider Madrid a candidate for the title,"" Valverde said. ""Sometimes the gaps seem great but they are not so much, just two and a half games, and we see them as one of our rivals."" ""This year La Liga is tighter, everything is more compressed. But always it is better if we are first."" Barcelona confirmed on Saturday that Sergi Roberto and Malcom are available again after recovering from hamstring and ankle injuries respectively.

""The only contact made was during the month of August and one week ago. In both cases, this contact was made with PSG's sporting management to show FC Barcelona's interest in player Adrien Rabiot."" PSG said earlier in December that they will allow the 23-year-old, whose contract expires in the summer, to join another club at the end of the season due to his reluctance to sign a new deal. His agent Veronique Rabiot, who is also his mother, said the following day that the situation between the French champions and her son had completely deteriorated. Barcelona, who were banned from signing players for a year in 2014 for breaking rules over the international transfer of players aged under 18, have been at pains to point out that they have not signed any deal prior to the transfer window opening on January 1. ""FC Barcelona have always wanted to work with the utmost transparency in their dealings with PSG and with any other club,"" said the statement. FC Barcelona refute the existence of any type of agreement with PSG player Adrien Rabiot."" Rabiot, who has made more than 150 top-flight appearances, has been agitating for a transfer for some time. He also rejected a chance to be on standby for France's World Cup-winning squad."
367,21/12/2018,02:45,Barcelona's defensive problems fester despite healthy Liga lead,"Barcelona's title charge has been riddled with defensive problems and just as they looked to have found stability, another one landed at their feet.","Their 5-0 win over Levante last weekend may have been a triumph for attacking fluency, not to mention Lionel Messi, who scored a hat-trick, but more surprising was the clean sheet, their third in a row in the league for the first time since March. ""We are on a positive run,"" Gerard Pique said. ""We are playing better, conceding less and scoring goals, it's all very positive."" But after Thomas Vermaelen, their fourth-choice central defender, hobbled off with a calf strain, the Barca board moved on Thursday to sign on loan Colombian international Jeison Murillo despite the 26-year-old having played only one La Liga match all season. Ernesto Valverde had already switched to three at the back after Nelson Semedo withdrew last-minute due to pain in his knee. And now Vermaelen is expected out for at least a month while Samuel Umtiti, Pique's principal partner, is in Qatar, hoping to find a solution to his own niggling injury to his knee. The Frenchman's return date is unknown. That leaves Clement Lenglet, who is experiencing a predictably up-and-down debut season, and Pique, who has improved in recent weeks, but started the season off the pace, like a 31-year-old with his sharpest days behind him. ""It can't be that we concede every game,"" Messi said in October. ""We have to be stronger defensively. We are following a year when it was very hard to score against us."" Barca are still three points clear at the top of the table, although 11th in terms of goals conceded and, given Real Madrid have changed coach and Atletico Madrid won just one away game all season, they might have hoped for a heftier cushion. In the past, Valverde could have looked within for cover but Barca's youth ranks are not as prolific as they once were. Oscar Mingueza, Chumi Brandariz, Jorge Cuenca and Ronald Araujo are all defenders for the club's B team but none, seemingly, are deemed ready to step up. Instead, the rumour mill has gone into overdrive, with a replacement sought in January ahead of the start of the knock-out stages of the Champions League. Lyon were the opponents drawn for the round of 16 on Monday and the French side have already proven themselves dangerous against Manchester City in the group stages. Memories remain fresh too of the four goals Barca conceded against Roma on their way out of the quarter-finals in April. Valencia's Jeison Murillo, the 26-year-old Colombian, appears most likely to come in but he will do well to find his feet straight away. The demands on playing style at Barcelona are unique and most recruits need time to adapt. The defensive leaks have other sources too, namely in midfield, where Sergio Busquets has sometimes looked sluggish, particularly when team-mates have been caught upfield and opponents pour forward on the counter-attack. Adrien Rabiot is expected to join from Paris Saint-Germain, where his contract expires next summer, but his arrival would likely come in June not January. Celta Vigo could prove generous opponents on Saturday, given their tendency is to retain possession and attack. Ninth in the table, they boast the third most goals scored, as well as the fourth most conceded. There is also Messi, who tends to make light of deficiencies at the back. He scored three and set up two more against Levante to take the Ballon d'Or's fifth best player to 20 goals in 19 games this season. His 34 in 68 last season saw him collect Europe's Golden Shoe award on Tuesday. ""The truth is I had no idea that all this would happen when I started,"" Messi said. Real Madrid's involvement in the Club World Cup final in Abu Dhabi offers Barcelona, and the chasing pack, a chance to extend the gap before the winter break. Atletico and Sevilla are both two points ahead of Real and three off the lead. Diego Simeone's side face Espanyol, who could have gone top last month but have lost five games in a row since. Sevilla travel to 16th-placed Leganes on Sunday. Fixtures (all times GMT)"

Barcelona said that they will have an option to make the deal for Murillo permanent in June for 25 million euros ($28.7 million). Spanish media reported that Barca coach Ernesto Valverde had made a special request for the club to sign Murillo, despite the 26-year-old having played only one La Liga match all season.

Considered one of the best centre-backs in the world, the left-footed Frenchman has played just eight games for Barcelona this season because of the recurring pain in his knee. The 2018 World Cup winner played in the 1-1 draw with Atletico Madrid at the weekend but that was his first game in almost two months due to the pain which returned after the bruising game in Madrid. ""Samuel Umtiti will follow a plan of conservative treatment with the objective of curing the discomfort in his left knee,"" Barce reported on their website Friday. ""The player will travel to Doha, Qatar where he will follow this therapeutic plan under the supervision of the club's medical services.""

Sergi Roberto had been the player replaced, with Barcelona also confirming on Sunday he has a hamstring injury and is expected to be out for three to four weeks. Barcelona did not offer a timescale for Rafinha's recovery but anterior cruciate ligament injuries often take several months to heal. A club statement said: ""Rafinha has a rupture of the anterior cruciate ligament of the left knee. In the next few days we will proceed with surgical treatment."" Sergi is likely to miss Barca's remaining Champions League group games against PSV Eindhoven and Tottenham, as well as La Liga fixtures at home to Villarreal and away to Espanyol. On Sergi, the club added: ""Sergi Roberto will be out for between three to four weeks with a rupture of the hamstring in his left leg."" Unlike Sergi, Rafinha has not been a regular in Barcelona's line-up this season, but the Brazilian enjoyed a run in the side while Lionel Messi was injured last month.

""At the last meal I had with Miguel, we spoke about lots of things other than that situation, but we did touch on the issue,"" Simeone said on Friday. ""But there is still nothing (concrete). We have not talked about money, or how many years, or anything. ""But it is true that Miguel has proposed the idea that some time during the rest of the season we should come together to start talking about continuing together."" As well as Simeone, Atletico will be keen to secure the future of Jan Oblak, the team´s star player alongside Antoine Griezmann. Oblak´s current contract expires in 2021 but reportedly has a release clause set at 100 million euros, a sum unlikely to deter clubs interested in one of the world's best goalkeepers. ""I know the club is working hard towards Jan staying with us,"" Simeone said. ""We have chatted with him this week and he is very clear about what he wants, what he needs. ""Obviously he knows that we also need him. He is a very important figure in the present and the future of this club."" Atletico will leapfrog Barcelona if they win at the Wanda Metropolitano on Saturday but have not beaten the reigning Spanish champions in the league since 2010. ""It has always been difficult for us against Barcelona, I believe Barcelona has been the best team in the world,"" Simeone said. ""They have not had the consistency in Europe in the last few years that they have had in the league but their record in Spain is tremendous and it has cost us a lot. Tomorrow is a new opportunity."" Atletico are likely to be without injured trio Diego Godin, Jose Gimenez and Juanfran this weekend but Koke, Thomas Lemar, Stefan Savic and Lucas Hernandez could all return."
372,23/11/2018,18:18,Atletico well-placed to beat Barca and end miserable winless streak,Atletico Madrid will have to overcome an eight-year winless streak if they are to beat Barcelona and jump above their rivals in La Liga on Saturday.,"Here, AFP Sport looks at five areas where the game could be won and lost at the Wanda Metropolitano: Atletico have finished in La Liga's top three for the past six years running but have not beaten Barcelona in the league since 2010, with 16 games going by without a victory for Diego Simeone's side. Perhaps their cautious approach is well-suited to their opponents, although they have beaten Barca twice in the Champions League knockout stage, or perhaps there is a psychological barrier and a lack of belief they can go toe-to-toe with them. They have a great chance this weekend. Ernesto Valverde's team are coming off the back of a bad defeat by Real Betis. Their defence is vulnerable while Philippe Coutinho, Ivan Rakitic and Marc-Andre ter Stegen are all struggling for fitness. Antoine Griezmann has made no secret of his desire to win the Ballon d'Or, in fact his very public cravings even drew criticism from Real Madrid captain Sergio Ramos in September. Griezmann has won the World Cup and Europa League in 2018 but his numbers are still some way off the likes of Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo. There is room to improve in the big games too. Messi has been relentless in this fixture, scoring 28 goals in 36 games against Atletico. They are his second favourite opponent, behind Sevilla and just above Real Madrid. Messi delivers against the biggest teams, while Griezmann is yet to prove he can consistently as well. Griezmann against Messi is a battle for the purists but for those that like the grittier side of the game, Sergio Busquets and Rodri Hernandez go head-to-head in midfield. Busquets, 30, still has years left but some of his performances this season have not been at his usual standard. When Barca have lacked control, Busquets has been over-run. Rodri is not the finished article but has shown poise and vision beyond his relatively youthful age of 22. Their performances will be of particular interest to Luis Enrique, with Rodri touted to be Busquets' successor as Spain's defensive midfielder in chief. After 12 games, Barcelona have already conceded 18 goals in La Liga, more than 13 of the other 19 teams in the table, including Leganes who sit in the relegation zone. Less than a third of the way through the season, they have let in more than half of the 29 goals they shipped last term when they won the title. They are almost already at the 21 they conceded when crowned champions in 2015. Gerard Pique has been error-ridden, Samuel Umtiti injured and Clement Lenglet still finding his feet. Too often Ter Stegen has had to come to the rescue. Barca might yet score their way to trophies but if Atletico are brave this weekend, they will get chances. Barca's problems at the back may be eased by Atletico's shortcomings up front, where key players have so far failed to deliver. In La Liga, Griezmann is the team's top scorer with three goals, ahead of Thomas Lemar, bought for 60 million euros last summer, on two. Diego Costa is yet to even get off the mark, his league drought now stretching all the way back to February. Under Simeone, Atletico have always relied on a sturdy defence but the pressure to produce clean sheets has increased. Costa and Griezmann's partnership will be crucial to the team's success this season."
373,23/11/2018,03:12,Atletico look to leapfrog Barcelona in wide open La Liga,Atletico Madrid have a chance to take advantage of a topsy-turvy La Liga campaign when they host champions Barcelona on Saturday with the chance to take top spot this weekend despite their own patchy form.,"Diego Simeone's side are just a point behind leaders Barca despite having drawn five times and lost once, together as many matches as they have won. They are battling to overtake Barca alongside Sevilla and surprise package Alaves, who are both level on 23 points with Atleti. Alaves, promoted in 2016, finished 14th last term but will go top if they win away at Leganes on Friday night, while Sevilla could potentially be leaders on Sunday night despite languishing in 13th place in September. Even Real Madrid are in touch, just four points back despite having gone more than eight hours without a goal at one point and having been without a permanent coach for two weeks before Santiago Solari was upgraded from interim to full-time boss. This season every time a challenger has clicked into gear they seem to click out again, in turn offering fresh impetus to their stumbling rivals around them. Barca were verging on crisis in September before reeling off six wins and a draw away at Valencia. Then they were blown away by Real Betis, flattered even by the 4-3 scoreline. ""We have managed to play the way we want against the big teams, but against other teams with less potential we have not,"" defender Gerard Pique said. ""If we want to win titles we have to be strong against everyone, the difficult ones and everyone else."" Atletico may have put a miserable start behind them but last month, they suffered their heaviest defeat under Diego Simeone, a 4-0 loss to Borussia Dortmund. Before the international break, they needed two goals in the last 10 minutes to beat Athletic Bilbao. The last time Atleti prevailed over Barca in the league was 2010, when they had Spain keeper David de Gea in goal and Argentina striker Sergio Aguero up front. Lionel Messi proved the difference in March with a bending free-kick, and in the summer too for Antoine Griezmann, who decided he would be better off in the lead role he holds with Atletico rather than playing second fiddle at Barca. Griezmann has not shied away from his craving to clinch the Ballon d´Or this year but despite winning the World Cup and Europa League, the sense is he will come up short, as he is not consistently dominating these kind of fixtures in the way players like Messi do. There will be a battle of old against new in midfield, where Sergio Busquets, 30, goes up against Rodri Hernandez, eight years his junior. Rodri is still rough around the edges but has poise, judgement and the ability to set the tempo. Busquets has done that job at the highest level over the past decade but he has been among those most at fault in Barca's worst performances this season. Any result at the Wanda Metropolitano will benefit sixth-placed Real Madrid, whose first game with Santiago Solari as their permanent coach comes at Eibar early Saturday afternoon. Four wins, 15 goals scored and only two conceded point to nothing less than a transformation, which gave Madrid president Florentino Perez an easy solution to fill the vacancy left open by the sacking of Julen Lopetegui. Solari has a kind run of fixtures until Christmas, broken only by a league clash against Valencia and Roma in the Champions League next week, which gives his side the chance to re-emerge as serious challengers to Barca's crown.

374,20/11/2018,19:19,"Costa back fit, Godin unavailable for Barca clash",Striker Diego Costa returned to training on Tuesday but defender Diego Godin will miss Atletico Madrid's top-of-the-table clash with Barcelona this weekend.,"Former Chelsea forward Costa has been suffering from a foot injury which kept him out Spain's recent fixtures against Croatia and Bosnia, but photos on the club's website showed him training. Uruguayan Godin has a problem with his thigh and the 124-time capped international missed his country's friendlies against Brazil and France. ""I know what I have, I know myself, I know my body, it is a tear that will take a few weeks, 20 days or a month,"" Godin told Marca. Left-back Lucas Hernandez is fit for the fixture between table-topping Barca and third-placed Atletico but central defender Jose Maria Gimenez is a doubt to face the La Liga champions. Coach Diego Simeone faces a selection headache at the heart of his defence with Montenegro's Stefan Savic also out with a calf issue. Simeone admitted he would have to call up Atletico B teenager Francisco Montero or move Saul Niguez from his usual position in central midfield. ""It is possible that Montero will play while there is also the chance that Saul will play at centre-half which he has done in several games,"" the Argentinian boss said. The Wanda Metropolitano's pitch has been replaced in time for Saturday's game. After Atletico's 1-1 draw at Monaco on November 11, Costa criticised the surface which was laid only last September. ""The pitch is shameful, it's fatal,"" Costa told El Mundo. ""Wanda's turf is horrible, we can not have such a bad pitch,"" he added."
375,20/11/2018,16:18,Philippe Coutinho set for Barcelona return,"Barcelona forward Philippe Coutinho has returned to training ahead of this weekend's La Liga match against Atletico Madrid after missing two weeks with a thigh problem, the club announced on Tuesday.","The 26-year-old former Liverpool player has not featured for the side at the top of the table since the 1-1 Champions League draw at Inter Milan on November 6. Barca's last game was a 4-3 home defeat to Real Betis on November 11, their first league loss at the Camp Nou in more than two years. Reports in the Spanish press say the world's third most expensive player could be given the green light on Friday to feature in Saturday's first against third clash against Atletico at the Wanda Metropolitano. It would be a boost for coach Ernesto Valverde who is already without the injured and suspended Croatia midfielder Ivan Rakitic."
376,19/11/2018,19:11,"Barca's Dembele should be 'more responsible', says Luis Suarez","Luis Suarez, a three-time biter of opposition players, said Monday that Barcelona teammate Ousmane Dembele should be ""more responsible"" after he reportedly missed training following a marathon nocturnal video gaming session.","Dembele was dropped by the Spanish champions for last week's shock 4-3 home defeat to Real Betis following what coach Ernesto Valverde called a ""sporting assessment"". But sports daily As reports that the Catalans are worried not only that he might be addicted to gaming, but also that it might ruin his career at the club. And Suarez, no stranger to disciplinary issues himself, says that the 21-year-old France international, signed for an initial fee of 105 million euros, needs to follow the more virtuous example set by some of his Barca colleagues. ""Ousmane knows that football is a privilege for every player, maybe he should concentrate more and be more responsible regarding certain things,"" the Uruguay striker told reporters ahead of his country's clash with France at the Stade de France on Tuesday. ""There are examples of professionalism at Barca that he can draw inspiration from. He'll continue to learn, with that self-confidence that will enable him to succeed at Barcelona."" Suarez has attracted controversy throughout his career. He was banned for biting players during his time at Ajax -- where he was nicknamed ""Cannibal"" by the Dutch press -- and Liverpool. But he most famously took a chunk out of Italy defender Giorgio Chiellini during Uruguay's final group game in the 2014 World Cup, throwing himself to the ground as Chiellini showed bite marks and Italy's players protested to the referee. Amid the chaos Uruguay won a corner and scored the winning goal that took them through and knocked 10-man Italy out. Suarez was handed a record nine-game World Cup ban and barred from any football-related activity for four months by FIFA, meaning that he was unable to make his debut for Barca until late October that year. In 2011 he was banned for eight matches by the Football Association for racially abusing Patrice Evra during a clash between Liverpool and Manchester United."
377,11/11/2018,23:24,"Barca suffer first league home defeat in two years, Real boost Solari hopes","Barcelona lost at home in La Liga for the first time in more than two years as Real Betis pulled off a stunning 4-3 victory on Sunday, despite Lionel Messi scoring twice on his return from injury.","Barca last endured a league defeat at the Camp Nou against Alaves in September 2016 but, following 42 games unbeaten, their run was ended by a brilliant, counter-attacking display from Betis. Three hours later, Real Madrid were putting the finishing touches to a 4-2 win away at Celta Vigo, a result expected to earn Santiago Solari an extension to his tenure as coach. Real have now posted four consecutive victories since Solari was put in temporary charge while the gap behind Barca has been reduced to four points. ""He has done excellently,"" Madrid club director Emilio Butragueno said afterwards. ""We are very happy with how things have gone."" On his future, Solari said: ""We'll see. I don't usually plan too far ahead but in principle, it´s my day off tomorrow."" Barca's shock defeat came despite a return for Messi, whose two goals, one from the penalty spot and another deep into injury-time, proved little more than consolations. ""We don't leave with the feeling Betis were the better team,"" coach Ernesto Valverde said. ""I don't want to take any credit away from our opponent but we could have countered them better."" It was the first time ever that Messi scored twice and Barcelona lost, but they stay top of the table, even if three clubs now lurk just one point behind. Atletico Madrid, whom they face at the Wanda Metropolitano after the international break, Sevilla and Alaves lead the chasing pack. Alaves beat Huesca 2-1 earlier on Sunday, while Sevilla won by the same scoreline at home to Espanyol, Wissam Ben Yedder prodding in an 89th-minute winner. ""Top of the table is fine, I won't deny it,"" Valverde said. ""It should also help us to realise it is never easy to win."" Betis' reward for beating Barca is to climb to 12th. Quique Setien's side may have pulled back on the sumptuous, attacking football that earned them a sixth-place finish last term but, in full flow, they remain one of Spain's most difficult opponents to stop. ""We have been a brave team in every way,"" former Spain international Joaquin said. ""Winning at the Camp Nou requires concentration and doing everything very well. We played a great game."" Betis seemed faster, sharper and hungrier while Barcelona's midfield was repeatedly carved open on the break. It took five passes for the opener, the last a first-time drive from William Carvalho to free Junior Firpo down the left. He weaved inside Sergi Roberto and struck hard into the net. Barca had chances but Betis were soon pouring forward again, with Junior's cross evading everyone except Giovani Lo Celso on the opposite flank. His cute cut-back picked out Joaquin, who stabbed in Betis' second. Arturo Vidal replaced the jaded Arthur Melo at half-time and, in the 68th minute, Barca pulled one back, with Jordi Alba tugged down by Cristian Tello, and Messi converting the penalty for his eighth league goal of the season. But the recovery stalled three minutes later as Marc-Andre ter Stegen let Lo Celso's shot slip through his fingers and drop into the far corner for 3-1. Barca were not done yet. Two substitutes combined for a second, Munir El Haddadi laying on Vidal but no sooner had the comeback begun again, it was halted. First, Ivan Rakitic was sent off, a second yellow card for a late challenge on Lo Celso, and then Sergio Canales tapped in Betis' fourth from Junior's cross. Messi added his second in injury-time but there was to be no more late drama. Madrid's win was more straightforward as Karim Benzema opened the scoring, a sublime touch and turn making space for a crisp finish into the corner. Benzema's shot then cannoned in off Gustavo Cabral before Hugo Mallo's sweet volley gave Celta hope. Sergio Ramos, however, chipped in a late penalty, Cabral was sent off for a second yellow card and Dani Ceballos wrapped up the points with a superb long-range strike. Brais Mendez scored a second for Celta in injury-time. The only blot for Solari was a spate of injuries which saw Casemiro, Sergio Reguilon and Nacho all forced off. Gareth Bale also took a knock to his left ankle in the first half but was able to continue."
378,10/11/2018,14:28,Messi ready as Barca drop Dembele,Ernesto Valverde has indicated Lionel Messi and Samuel Umtiti are both ready to return for Barcelona against Real Betis on Sunday but Ousmane Dembele has been dropped.,"Messi has been out since breaking his arm against Sevilla on October 20 while Umtiti has been nursing a knee problem and has not played since September 26. Both are included in the squad to face Betis in La Liga this weekend but there was a surprise omission for Dembele. Valverde said the 21-year-old had been left out after a ""sporting assessment"". Messi's return would come as a major boost to Barca. Their captain was included in the travelling squad to face Inter Milan on Wednesday but was not deemed fit enough even for the bench. Asked if he could play 90 minutes against Betis, Valverde said: ""We will see, but he's lost his fear of falling or struggling against an opponent. ""You have to get that out of your head, you cannot be thinking if you are about to make a bad movement. I have seen him training well and with confidence."" Messi's absence should have been a golden opportunity for Dembele but the winger's form has been mixed in recent weeks, while Luis Suarez, Philippe Coutinho, Rafinha and Malcom have all impressed. ""Everyone can interpret it how they want but this is a team,"" Valverde said. ""I'm looking for the best for the team and that's it."" Barcelona paid around 105 million euros to sign Dembele from Borussia Dortmund last year but injury and inconsistency have plagued his career in Spain so far. ""Let's hope he can make the most of all his talent so the team benefits and also the club, which has made a great investment in him,"" Valverde added. Umtiti has been a key player for Barca but the defender's place in the starting line-up this weekend is not guaranteed, given Clement Lenglet has done well alongside Gerard Pique during the team's strong run. ""It is great news that Lenglet has shown his level,"" Valverde said. ""Far from being a problem, it is perfect to have more possibilities, we will see tomorrow who plays."" Barcelona sit three points clear at the top of La Liga and will hope for another victory against 14th-placed Betis, before the start of the international break. Valverde also praised his full-back Jordi Alba, who earned a recall to the Spain squad for the first time under new coach Luis Enrique. ""We have seen Jordi improve every day,"" Valverde said. ""Every coach asks for something and his start to the season is spectacular. A call-up to the national team is well-deserved."" Coutinho will not play against Betis. The midfielder is recovering from a hamstring strain."
379,09/11/2018,02:30,Solari to make closing argument for revived Madrid job,Santiago Solari is pitching for more than just three points as Real Madrid continue their revival under the interim coach and head to Celta Vigo aiming for their fourth straight win.,"Solari's time as the European champions' stop-gap following Julen Lopetegui's sacking will expire over the international break, and club president Florentino Perez needs to decide whether to take the Argentine on permanently. Real have bounced back under Solari, with Wednesday's 5-0 drubbing of Viktoria Plzen a clear sign of life in the struggling giants. A win at bouncing Balaidos could well be enough to convince Perez the job should be Solari's, at least until the end of the season, when a more established alternatives could be available. ""We're doing fine with him,"" striker Karim Benzema said on Wednesday. ""I don't see a coach coming for one or two months, for me Solari has to stay until the end of the season. He's a great coach. Now we have more confidence and we are going to fight."" Few could begrudge Solari the opportunity to prove himself after stepping up from Madrid's B team to take charge. Madrid have scored 11 and conceded none since Solari's arrival, against admittedly modest opposition -- Melilla from the Spanish third tier, Real Valladolid at home and Plzen. Luck has also played its part, as Vinicius Junior's deflected shot prevented what looked set to be a stalemate against Valladolid with seven minutes to play. A draw there and Solari's tenure might never have got off the ground. However it was Solari's decision to bring on the 18-year-old Vinicius, whose youthful exuberance produced an ambitious strike at the end of a weaving run. Celta will offer a sterner test this weekend. They are the third highest scorers in the division and in Iago Aspas boast the sort of smart finisher Madrid might have signed in the summer. Aspas' eight goals this term puts him one up on Lionel Messi, who could return on Sunday when league leaders Barcelona host Real Betis after three weeks out with a broken arm. Messi was included in Barca's travelling squad to face Inter Milan on Wednesday but watched from the stands as his side reached the Champions League knockout stages with a 1-1 draw at the San Siro. ""We wanted him to travel with the team, to train to see how he was,"" coach Ernesto Valverde said. Valverde has been afforded the luxury of easing Messi back by his team's strong run without him. Reaching the last 16 in Europe came after five wins on the bounce, four of them without Messi, including one against Inter at home and the 5-1 hammering of Real Madrid. A tricky period of fixtures continues against Betis and ends at Atletico Madrid after the international break. Luis Suarez's with six goals in his last five games have been integral but Jordi Alba has arguably been Barca's player of the season so far. His form has forced Spain coach Luis Enrique to concede defeat in his mysterious stand-off with the full-back, calling Alba up for the first time on Thursday. Diego Costa and Koke missed out on the squad with injury as Atletico Madrid head into their clash with Athletic Bilbao on Saturday with a dizzying list of absentees. Thomas Lemar, Diego Godin and Stefan Savic were also missing for Tuesday's impressive 2-0 win over Borussia Dortmund, in which Jose Gimenez pulled up with a muscle problem. Fourth-placed Atleti are four points behind leaders Barca and looking to build on the momentum gained in midweek and leapfrog Sevilla and Espanyol, who play each other in Andalusia on Sunday."
380,28/10/2018,23:02,Ramos says players in the dark about Lopetegui future,Sergio Ramos insists Real Madrid's players have been told nothing about a change of coach after their 5-1 defeat to Barcelona on Sunday left Julen Lopetegui on the brink of the sack.,"Luis Suarez scored a hat-trick as Madrid were ripped apart at Camp Nou and familiar failings in defence were exposed again. Philippe Coutinho and Arturo Vidal scored either side of Suarez's treble while a Marcelo goal briefly threatened a comeback early in the second half. The European champions have now managed only one victory from their last six matches and reports in the Spanish press on Sunday night indicated Lopetegui could be removed as soon as Monday, with Antonio Conte ready to take charge. ""We have to wait, they have not told us anything,"" Ramos said after the match. ""These are decisions not made by us so we have to keep a cool head, look at ourselves and try to change things to get better results. ""We will see what happens in the coming hours and tomorrow but the players are always with the coach to the death."" Conte is available after he was sacked by Chelsea in July. He had led them to the Premier League title in his first season but they finished fifth in his second, and missed out on Champions League qualification. The Italian would be taking over a Madrid team that now sits ninth in La Liga and seven points behind Barca, who returned to the top of the table. Ramos insisted, however, the title is not lost yet. ""There are people that would believe, others that wouldn't,"" Ramos said. ""I have won La Ligas from 10 points behind. The key to success is to work. Madrid never gives up when it can turn the situation around."""
381,28/10/2018,20:10,Lopetegui defiant despite thrashing by Barcelona,Julen Lopetegui wants to remain in charge of Real Madrid and believes he can turn their season around despite a 5-1 thrashing at the hands of Barcelona on Sunday.,"Luis Suarez scored a hat-trick to leave Lopetegui's future in serious doubt. After going more than eight hours without a goal earlier this month, Madrid have now managed just one win in six matches. ""I feel sad at the moment, (but) want fully to remain in charge,"" Lopetegui said. ""This is a big blow but I am strong enough to know everything can be turned around. There is a long way to go and I have a lot of faith in this group of players."" Philippe Coutinho opened the scoring at the Camp Nou while Arturo Vidal headed in a fifth to cap a late flurry of three goals in 15 minutes. Madrid had threatened a comeback when Marcelo made it 2-1 early in the second half but they were defensively frantic again while mistakes from Raphael Varane and Sergio Ramos proved costly. Defeat means they stay ninth in La Liga, seven points behind Barcelona, who return to the top of the table. ""We all know how the world of football works, and the final responsibility lies with the coach,"" Lopetegui said. ""I am not stupid but here we win together and lose together. I still believe we are at an early stage of the season and Madrid this year will celebrate. ""It is hard, a defeat is always hard, even more at Barcelona. We have the feeling that we could have turned the game around, we had chances to equalise, and go on and win."" Ernesto Valverde was under pressure too last month but as Madrid's dip has deepened, Barca have found their rhythm. They have now taken 13 points from a possible 15 across the league and Champions League, through a difficult run of opponents. ""I'm very happy because we know the talent our opponent has,"" Valverde said. ""We can enjoy it now but if it helps us win the league, I will enjoy it even more."" On Suarez, Valverde added: ""It seems normal to me. Last year, people were saying he didn't score enough but I know the work he puts in and he gets the rewards that he deserves."""
382,28/10/2018,18:19,Suarez hits hat-trick as Barcelona blow away Madrid,Barcelona ran riot in the Clasico on Sunday as Luis Suarez scored the hat-trick that will surely spell the end of Julen Lopetegui's spell as Real Madrid coach.,"Barcelona were 5-1 winners at the Camp Nou, dominant for all-but a 15-minute spell after half-time when the otherwise hapless Madrid briefly threatened a comeback. All the failures that have underlined their recent problems under Lopetegui were on show here, poor finishing, dreadful defending and key players performing well below par, let alone their best. Philippe Coutinho scored the first and Arturo Vidal the last but in between the game belonged to Suarez, who terrorised Madrid from start to finish and made light of Lionel Messi's injury-enforced absence. For Lopetegui, it is now one win in six games, as Madrid fall seven points behind Barcelona, who return to the top of the table. This defeat was reminiscent of the 4-0 thrashing that spelt the end of Rafael Benitez's time in charge two years ago but while Benitez survived two more months, Lopetegui may not last the week. Much was made of this being the first Clasico without either Messi or Cristiano Ronaldo in 11 years but Suarez's masterclass will mean this contest lives long in the memory. Madrid looked dazed in possession and dizzy out of it as Barca repeatedly opened them up down the left early on. Sergio Busquets was allowed time to wait for Jordi Alba's zooming run past both Gareth Bale and Nacho, with the full-back's touch on the run perfectly pushed into the area. Suarez rushed past but Coutinho held his ground by the penalty spot, where Alba found him with the cut-back. It was the move's 30th pass, the most for a goal in a La Liga Clasico in 13 seasons. On the touchline, Lopetegui stood motionless. Varane clapped but his team-mates looked shell-shocked. Sergio Ramos thrashed a pass across his own box to Nacho, who hacked it to the feet of Arthur, his shot parried away by Courtois. Still, Barca needed the help of VAR for the second. Suarez was too quick to the ball at the near post and Varane bundled him over. It was a clear penalty, which Suarez converted for his seventh goal in 11 games against these opponents. His eighth and ninth were still to come. Gerard Pique should have headed in while a promising Madrid free-kick somehow ended with another Barca sprawl on the counter-attack. The visitors were fortunate to be only two down at half-time but the game was a mirror image after the restart. Varane had gone off, with a muscle problem the club said, for Lucas Vazquez, with Nacho moving to centre-back. Vazquez was key to Madrid's goal, his disguised pass allowing Isco to pick out Marcelo, who finished for his third in three games. Suddenly, it was Barca making the mistakes. Sergio Ramos headed over, Luka Modric hit the inside of the post and Isco's finish was blocked after Rafinha ran into trouble. Madrid were less transformed at the back, where Suarez acrobatically volleyed onto the post before Alba fired just wide. As Madrid's momentum faded, Suarez landed the knock-out blow. Sergi Roberto chipped a cross into the box but the ball had neither the pace nor the angle to be headed in easily. Suarez, however, generated both himself to leave Courtois stranded. If that was a masterclass in adaptation, his third was a demonstration of finesse. Ramos was pushed off the ball by Sergi Roberto, who freed Suarez. Suarez feathered the ball over Courtois for his hat-trick. Madrid were finished but the humiliation was not over yet as Ousmane Dembele crossed for Vidal to head home a fifth. Suarez could even have had a fourth in injury-time but Courtois saved. Five was more than enough."
383,27/10/2018,14:56,"Watch out for 'wounded' Madrid, warns Barcelona coach Valverde","Barcelona coach Ernesto Valverde has warned his team to beware a ""wounded"" Real Madrid side as the hosts head into Sunday's Clasico at the Camp Nou without the injured Lionel Messi.","""We know what Madrid are like, they are more dangerous when they are wounded,"" said Valverde at a press conference on the eve of the game. His opposite number Julen Lopetegui is under enormous pressure ahead of the match, with Real having taken just one point from their last four games in La Liga. Madrid ended a five-match winless run in all competitions by beating Viktoria Plzen 2-1 in the Champions League in midweek, but that unconvincing performance may have only delayed the inevitable for Lopetegui. Defeat at the Camp Nou and Real would be seven points behind their great rivals at the top of the table. Conversely, though, a win may just buy Lopetegui some time, and Barcelona do come into the game without Messi after he suffered a fractured arm against Sevilla last weekend. Valverde has not forgotten the promise the reigning European champions showed when they took 13 points from a possible 15 to start the season. ""There were moments at the start of the season when Madrid were brilliant in possession and in terms of the pressure they put teams under,"" he warned. ""They are now on a bad run, but they also have enough about them to overcome these things, just as we do with the absence of Messi."" It will be the first Clasico without either Messi or Cristiano Ronaldo since 2007. ""Cristiano was an important player, but we all need to look forward, that is what we are doing and I imagine that is what Madrid are doing,"" added Valverde. The 54-year-old, who spent two years as a Barcelona player, also insisted that the meeting of Spain's two fiercest rivals has not lost any of its aura without the two greatest players of the current era. ""The Clasico existed before that. The Clasico has always been the Clasico, and there were even flying piglets,"" he said, with a reference to a meeting of the sides in 2002, when Barcelona fans threw a pig's head at Luis Figo, their former idol who had crossed the divide to join Real in 2000. ""There has always been tension."""
384,27/10/2018,03:41,'It hurts in the depths of my soul' - Messi absence a disaster for his fanatical fans,"Barcelona will miss Lionel Messi on Sunday - his goals, his dribbles, his presence as much as anything - but the angst will be gone with the help of three weeks' rest and a sling.","For the fans that came to see him, not the match or the teams, but him, the disappointment will be harder to shake. This will be the first Clasico without either Messi or Cristiano Ronaldo since December 2007, when Julio Baptista's winner was the difference in a 1-0 win for Real Madrid. There have been 35 games between them since. Messi has lit up more than a few - the hat-trick in 2007, the two free-kicks, and that run, leaving five Madrid players for dead, Sergio Ramos twice. In a stall on Carrer d'Aristides Maillol, lining the western edge of Camp Nou, a vendor stands under a collection of red and yellow scarves, behind him pinned up shirts with Messi, 10, on their backs. ""We will sell Messi shirts here even 20 years after he retires,"" he says. ""Nothing will change on Sunday."" What does a Clasico mean without Messi? ""No hay"". ""There isn't one"". Which isn't true of course. It was 1902 when Barcelona first appeared in Madrid for the semi-final of the Copa Coronacion. There have been 199 of them without Messi and there will be many more after he has gone. But in this current era, this fixture, at Camp Nou, is about him more than anyone else. Everyone wants to witness Messi once, still more on the biggest stage. When he stayed down clutching his broken right arm against Sevilla last weekend, it was a blow for Barca but a blow too for the thousands that thought they were eight days away. More than 8,000 kilometres away in Whitehorse, northern Canada, Barcelona fan Myles was one of those watching. He has 'MESSI' as his car number plate. His six years supporting means he has only ever known the club with Messi in it. ""I consider myself a big Barca fan but I have a special obsession with Messi,"" he says. Myles and his girlfriend paid 500 euros each for tickets to this Clasico. Their 19-hour flights, each way, cost a combined 1600 Canadian dollars. ""To say I was shell-shocked when he got injured is an understatement,"" Myles says. It is not about the money. ""In a scenario where it was guaranteed Messi would play I would have paid north of 2000 dollars for tickets."" The sense of time running out increases the stakes for these far-away fans. Messi turned 31 in June and this next meeting is a sneak peak into the future. Not long away, supporters will wonder if every Clasico could be his last. Lucas is from Texas, celebrating his 10-year wedding anniversary in Spain. He will go alone to the Camp Nou on Sunday, where he has shelled out 1400 US dollars on a VIP ticket. ""I knew it was a once in a lifetime opportunity for me,"" Lucas said. ""I thought it could be my first, and likely only time, watching Messi play."" There are the family connections too, like Marta and her brother Javier, who have flown over from Tenerife, and have been Barcelona fans since they were children. ""We support Barca but we love Messi,"" Marta said. ""Our hope has always been to see Barca at the Camp Nou but even more exciting was to see the best player in history. The injury against Sevilla left us so disappointed."" And those that came out of national pride like Laucha, who has travelled from Viedma in Argentina. ""I am a Boca Juniors fan and the expense was considerable, but Messi is Messi,"" she said. ""This opportunity will probably not come again for me. It hurts in the depths of my soul."" Samantha from England, whose husband is taking their fanatical eight-year-old son as a birthday present, would even accept a sighting. ""Perhaps he could still walk around the pitch and wave,"" she says. There is no other footballer that attracts so much adulation so far around the globe as Messi. As the biggest teams are increasingly watched more on screens than from stands, by supporters with no tangible link to their cities, the most recognisable players are becoming just as iconic as their clubs. When one website advertised tickets on Twitter for last weekend's game between Barca and Sevilla, the bait was catching Messi in full flow. ""Sevilla are one of #Messi's favourite victims,"" it read. Madrid are too. He has 26 goals in 38 games against them, but not on Sunday. For his opponents, relief. For some of his fans, regret, and the hope the chance will come round again."
385,27/10/2018,03:40,The Money Clasico - Real Madrid and Barcelona's race to a billion,"Barcelona against Real Madrid is a rivalry that goes back 116 years, to a pitch drenched in horse manure and spectators that cheered players falling over as much as them scoring a goal.","Barca won that first meeting in May 1902, 3-1, but more than a century on the landscape looks rather different. Two of the world's greatest clubs are engaged in a battle off the pitch just as fierce: the race to one billion euros. This autumn, their presidents, Josep Maria Bartomeu of Barcelona and Florentino Perez of Madrid, each made clear their desperation to cross the line first. The revenue milestone is not just financial, it is a mark of status, proof of success, another notch in the debate about which club is bigger. In five years, Madrid's turnover has soared from 521 million euros to a projected 752 million euros for the 2018/19 season. Barca pocketed 490 million euros five years ago. This season they expect to make 960 million. ""Either club could be the first one to do this,"" Esteve Calzada, Barcelona's marketing director between 2002 and 2007, and now boss of Prime Time Sport group, told AFP this week. But there is still work to do. ""It will take a few more years unless either club sells a player before then for 400 million euros,"" said Placido Rodriguez Guerrero, professor at the University of Oviedo and researcher in sports economics. Success on the pitch counts for a lot. Winning trophies swells the sums made from broadcasting rights and activates pre-agreed bonuses. Barcelona will receive from their shirt sponsor Rakuten an extra 1.5 million euros if they win La Liga this season and another 5 million euros if they triumph in the Champions League. The clubs can target global stars that boost visibility and merchandise sales, by the sheer weight of their talent and profile. During the 2000s, it was a policy that made its name in Madrid, as the likes of David Beckham, Zinedine Zidane and Luis Figo were all signed for hefty fees. In recent years, the club has reined in its spending. ""It can be positive in the short term to have a superstar, they join because of the brand and then help build the brand further,"" says Michael Goldberg, senior vice president at the global credit rating agency DBRS. ""But we don´t believe having a star enhances credit that much over the long-term. Cristiano Ronaldo leaving Madrid will not do much damage unless it´s the beginning of the end and it becomes a regular pattern."" Instead, the clincher is likely to lie in stadium plans. Barca's Camp Nou and Real's Santiago Bernabeu are set to undergo major overhauls from 2019, with the aim of enhancing commercial advantages. At a time when clubs like Tottenham in the Premier League are struggling to keep the cost of a new ground below 1 billion pounds, the projects of Barca and Real Madrid appear relatively cheap. For 400 million euros, Barcelona will increase the capacity of Camp Nou from 99,000 to 105,000 and install a roof. Madrid will not increase the 81,000 seats in the Santiago Bernabeu but will take out a loan of 525 million euros to add a roof and a metal envelope around the current structure. Perez has indicated they expect the updates to bring in more than 150 million euros of additional revenue per year. Added to that is the issue of naming rights, which can be a sensitive issue for fans, particularly when stadiums carry a deep sense of history and identity. Madrid are yet to find a buyer but Barca have said they are ""optimistic"" they will agree a title-partner by June next year, in an agreement worth 200 million euros. ""Naming is a crucial issue,"" says Calzada, who estimates the rights could be worth 15 to 20 million euros each year. ""But there is an obstacle because we are talking about a redesign of these two stadiums, it is not a new stadium where it is much easier to start again with a new name."" There is also the need to break new ground internationally. Next year, Barcelona will fly to Asia for their summer tour while the club have expressed support for La Liga's highly-controversial plan to stage a fixture against Girona in January in the United States. ""The future for commercial is about tapping into worldwide fanbases,"" adds Benjamin Dennis, a writer at DBRS. ""Fans in Miami will get to see a competitive match and that could be a difference maker if Barca play more games abroad."" In the race for financial superiority, nothing is off-limits."
386,26/10/2018,03:30,Barca await stumbling Madrid as Lopetegui looks for lifeline at Camp Nou,Julen Lopetegui said it was the happiest day of his life being named coach of Real Madrid but he could not have imagined this.,"Four and a half months, 138 days, nine La Liga games. One defeat at Camp Nou on Sunday and that might well be that. If Florentino Perez's mind is already made up, the result against Barcelona may not matter. A draw, or even a Madrid win, is not beyond the realm of possibility. After all, this game rarely has much respect for form and Lionel Messi is injured. ""It's a great game for us in this moment because we have no choice but to stand up,"" Toni Kroos told AFP this week. ""We have to show how good we are against a difficult opponent and I think we can do it."" A surprise success would make sacking Lopetegui harder to justify but five games without a win, more than eight hours without a goal, these are not quickly forgotten either. There were disgruntled whistles at full-time on Tuesday, the home fans deflated after watching a team that featured UEFA's best goalkeeper, defender and player hang on for a 2-1 victory over Viktoria Plzen. After the match, Lopetegui talked about turning points and changing dynamics but his demeanour perhaps betrayed the truth. ""I don't often smile anyway,"" he said. Madrid's chaotic performance had weakened his position, not strengthened it. Isco insisted on Monday that if they fire the coach, they should fire the players too. Lopetegui might have added the one the club did let go last summer took an average of 50 goals a season with him. Players though are never accountable - certainly not ones crowned European champions only five months ago - and besides, the coach sets the tone. He instils confidence, which leads to creativity and precision. He also sets the rules and for some, perhaps Perez included, this team has been indulged for too long. For their part, the players might argue they have struggled before and come through, not least under Zinedine Zidane last season. ""The confidence in my opinion is not a problem,"" said Kroos, whose Germany coach Joachim Loew is among those considered a potential successor to Lopetegui. ""We have many champions in the World Cup and the Champions League, and we have shown we can turn around tough situations. Remember that in the last few years, we have not only played good games, there have been bad ones too. ""We are creating, we are doing everything we can to get good results and that proves we are behind the coach. He is a very good coach in my opinion and I'm confident we can turn this around with him."" Opposite Lopetegui this weekend will be Ernesto Valverde, watching his Barca side with their own superstar extracted too. This will be the first Clasico without Lionel Messi or Cristiano Ronaldo since December 2007. The strikers then included Ruud van Nistelrooy and Robinho for Madrid, Samuel Eto'o and Ronaldinho for Barcelona. Messi will return, in three weeks if his right arm heals as expected, but Ronaldo's permanent absence has weighed heavier with every chance missed. When Barca went three games without a win last month, the feeling was both clubs were in crisis. Lopetegui was under pressure, but so was Valverde. Then Messi blew away Tottenham at Wembley and, a day later, Madrid lost 1-0 to CSKA Moscow, lacking the snap and spark Ronaldo once provided and that Messi had given the night before. Momentum has diverged since. Two more Madrid defeats followed to leave Lopetegui on the brink while Barca are now 10 points from 12 and top of the table. ""Madrid will be even more dangerous,"" Valverde said on Wednesday. ""They will come here to demonstrate all the strength they have."" He also knows failure to put away a wobbling rival will see the doubts circling again, but win, and a seven-point gap opens up. Or, Madrid can cut it to one, with only a single game, at home to Real Valladolid, against an opponent in the top half before Christmas. It will either be a chance for a Lopetegui revival or, the perfect start for his successor."
387,25/10/2018,16:08,Marcelo delivers Real boost ahead of Clasico against Barcelona,"Real Madrid defender Marcelo trained on Thursday, according to pictures posted by the club, and could be fit to face Barcelona in La Liga on Sunday.","Marcelo took a kick to his right ankle late on during Madrid's 2-1 Champions League win over Viktoria Plzen on Tuesday, casting doubt over his involvement in the upcoming Clasico at Camp Nou. However, photos published on the club website showed Marcelo training, and playing with the ball, without any visible strapping around his foot. Marcelo insisted he was ""fine"" after the Champions League match at Santiago Bernabeu but the Brazilian underwent tests on Wednesday. His recovery would be a boost to Madrid, who face Barca after winning just one of their last six games in all competitions."
388,24/10/2018,23:04,Barca cruise past Inter without Messi,Rafinha replaced Lionel Messi and helped Barcelona win without him as the Brazilian scored the opener in a 2-0 Champions League victory over Inter Milan on Wednesday.,"With Messi out for three weeks and Real Madrid next up at the Camp Nou on Sunday, the question was whether Barca could cope without their star player and captain. The answer may not have been resounding -- they lacked some punch before Jordi Alba added a late second -- but this controlled performance will certainly send them into the Clasico with a spring in their step. Luis Suarez, Arthur and Philippe Coutinho were all excellent in Messi's absence. Victory all-but secures Barcelona's passage to the Champions League last 16 too. They have nine points from three games and now sit top of Group B. Messi was watching in the stands with his son Ciro and his fractured right arm in a sling. As soon as the ball left the centre circle, the fans sang his name. Barca had drawn with Athletic Bilbao in the only other match this season he had not started, and that could have been a defeat were it not for him setting up the equaliser. Even the club had posted an article on its website this week entitled ""no need to panic"", detailing their ""not so bad"" record without him. Rafinha, who was playing on loan at Inter only five months ago, was a surprise replacement. Ousmane Dembele was the one expected to come in and the fact the Frenchman remained on the bench until the end does not speak well of his current status. Messi was 22 when Barcelona last played Inter, a 3-2 aggregate win for the Italians in the 2010 semi-finals that remains arguably the peak of Jose Mourinho's career. As well as Rafinha, Coutinho spent five years at Inter while Mauro Icardi started out in Barca's academy, ironically leaving in part due to Rafinha. Icardi was quiet but had the first chance, beating Marc-Andre ter Stegen to Ivan Perisic's low cross but stabbed his finish over. Clement Lenglet's header was denied by the feet of Samir Handanovic before Rafinha combined nicely with Suarez but failed to finish. It was a warning, because the same pair connected again for the opening goal. Rafinha started the move, the ball spilling out of a midfield tussle and into his path. He sent it right to Suarez, whose chipped cross reunited with Rafinha, who had continued his run and sidefooted home. Coutinho went closest to another before half-time, his free-kick deflecting inches wide, but Inter had a better spell after the break. Ter Stegen had to scoop away a Perisic cross and Matteo Politano, on as a substitute, should have capitalised on some careless defending. Barca came again. Suarez wiggled through, Lenglet hit Handanovic from close range and Coutinho struck the crossbar after a sensational counter-attack, begun by a brilliant Arthur flick. Arthur departed to a standing ovation soon after and with eight minutes left, Alba finally made sure of the win. He pushed Ivan Rakitic's ball past Milan Skriniar and drove into the far corner. There was there still time for one more Messi chant before the final whistle blew."
389,24/10/2018,00:24,Lopetegui confident he will be in charge against Barca,"Julen Lopetegui has said he is ""absolutely convinced"" he will still be Real Madrid's coach for the Clasico against Barcelona in La Liga on Sunday.","Madrid hung on for a 2-1 win over Viktoria Plzen on Tuesday as goals from Karim Benzema and Marcelo secured a much-needed, albeit unconvincing, victory. Lopetegui said he hoped the result would prove a ""turning point"" for his team, who had lost three games on the bounce. The result puts the European champions level on points with Roma in Group G of the Champions League and offers Lopetegui some respite ahead of this weekend's trip to the Camp Nou. Asked if he will be in the dug-out against Barca, Lopetegui said after the match: ""I am absolutely convinced of that yes. We won and we are already thinking from tomorrow about preparing for Sunday."" Real Madrid director Emilio Butragueno also appeared to confirm on Tuesday night that Lopetegui would be in charge against Barcelona. ""Yes, yes, as normal, absolutely,"" Butragueno said. ""I really believe in this type of game, it is very important to stay calm, be together, trust the players. ""We live it as normal, it's football and it's true, we hear rumours, but we go with confidence to Camp Nou."" Madrid's players, including Sergio Ramos, Marcelo and Isco, have been pledging their support to Lopetegui since the loss at home to Levante on Saturday. Benzema was Madrid's star performer against Plzen and offered his backing afterwards. ""The boss is very good, the players are with him,"" Benzema said. ""It is important the coach feels the confidence of his players and I have a lot of confidence in him."" Madrid have struggled for goals in recent weeks but they were a threat going forward against Plzen, who looked on course for a straightforward defeat when Marcelo made it 2-0 early in the second half. Patrik Hrosovsky, however, pulled a goal back with 12 minutes left and Madrid were left hanging on at the end. The final whistle was accompanied by disgruntled whistles from the home fans. ""I have not noticed anything special, the fans are sensible and treat us fantastically well,"" Lopetegui said. ""I would have liked to achieve a more comfortable victory but the most important thing is the three points."" Marcelo's involvement against Barcelona could be in doubt after he sustained an impact injury late on. ""He has taken a very heavy blow but it seems that it is a knock and not a muscular issue,"" Lopetegui said. ""I hope he will recover but we have to wait."""
390,23/10/2018,18:36,Let's miss Messi while we're winning - Valverde,Ernesto Valverde has challenged Barcelona to miss the injured Lionel Messi while they are winning without him.,"Barca face Inter Milan on Wednesday without their star striker, who is expected to be out for three weeks after fracturing his arm against Sevilla on Saturday. Messi's absence comes at a bad time, given his team face Inter in the Champions League before the first 'Clasico' of the season against Real Madrid on Sunday. ""It is clear it will affect us a lot,"" Barcelona coach Valverde said on Tuesday. ""But at the same time it is a chance to prove ourselves without him. ""We have important matches and a lot of motivation going into them. It is a period for us without Messi and we want to miss him while we´re winning."" Barca have been accused of 'Messidependencia', an over-reliance on the Argentinian, who inspired them to a 4-2 victory over Tottenham in their last Champions League outing. Barcelona sit level with Inter on six points in Group B. ""I don´t really give any thought to 'Messidepenencia',"" Valverde said. ""If Messi plays, it is obvious he will influence the style of the team. We depend on Messi, like we do other players, but Messi is the best. ""He is the best we've seen and now among all of us we have to make his absence less noticeable because we don't have his genius."" With Messi out, Valverde could bring in Ousmane Dembele at the Camp Nou, the 21-year-old who enjoyed a bright start to the season but has lost his place in recent weeks. Dembele joined Barcelona from Borussia Dortmund for 105 million euros last year but his first campaign was blighted by injury while doubts remain about the Frenchman's habit for losing possession. ""Anyone can lose the ball, the problem is the reaction you have afterwards,"" Valverde said. Barcelona appear to have turned a corner, however, after backing up their sensational win over Spurs with a draw away at Valencia and victory at home to Sevilla. A positive result against Inter would set them up nicely for Sunday's clash against Madrid, whose poor form has put the future of coach Julen Lopetegui in doubt. ""I have a great relationship with him,"" said Jordi Alba, Barca's left-back, who played under Lopetegui for Spain. ""He showed a lot of faith in me and I have a lot of respect for him. I wish him well and hope he continues longer because he deserves it."" Luis Suarez could sit out the game against Inter. Suarez missed training on Tuesday due to personal reasons."
391,23/10/2018,03:35,Messi injury gives Barca and Dembele chance to prove their worth,Barcelona's lowest ebbs are invariably followed by questions about Lionel Messi but the issue of over-reliance may become clearer over the coming weeks.,"The sight of Messi on the ground, grasping his right arm, during Barca's win over Sevilla on Saturday prompted reactions inside Camp Nou normally reserved for the conceding of goals. Hands behind heads, fingers over mouths, the concern became real shortly after the final whistle when the club confirmed Messi had fractured his radial bone. His absence leaves Barca vulnerable when they need him most, for a run of fixtures that includes Inter Milan in the Champions League on Wednesday, the Clasico against Real Madrid on Sunday, before a return match against Inter in Italy at the start of next month. If he takes longer than expected to recover, he could miss tricky games against Real Betis and Atletico Madrid in La Liga too. Barcelona have grown used to accusations of dependence, not least when results have taken a turn for the worse. When Ernesto Valverde left Messi on the bench for the 1-1 draw at home to Athletic Bilbao last month, the argument was given added weight by him coming on and making the assist for their equaliser. ""This is Barcelona,"" Messi afterwards. ""We have a strong team and we have enough not to have to depend on one player."" The same point was raised last season, when Messi, as a substitute, inspired a late fightback from two goals down against Sevilla and scored in the 89th minute. He played the entirety of the Champions League collapse against Roma but then the criticism was Barca had failed to find the answer when Messi had not provided it. There is no team in the world that would not look worse with Messi extracted. As Real Madrid are proving in the absence of Cristiano Ronaldo, a striker's goals are difficult to replace but so too is the aura. ""Emotionally we know when Messi is there he gives us more confidence because he is the best in the world,"" Pique said on Saturday. ""But it does not have to affect us."" To maintain a resurgence built on wins over Tottenham and Sevilla, as well as a draw away to Valencia, Valverde will have to find the solution. On Monday, Marca listed six options in a ""casting for replacements"" - Ousmane Dembele, Rafinha, Munir El Haddadi, Malcom, Carles Alena and Sergi Roberto. Alena, the 20-year-old midfielder, is an exciting talent, while Malcom, only a year older, scored 12 goals for Bordeaux last season. But Dembele is the most obvious. Messi's position on the right of the front three is where he is most comfortable, rather than off the left, where the 21-year-old has often been made to adapt so far. After a debut season blighted by injuries, Dembele started the first six games of this one, scoring five goals. But doubts remain about him in big games, where his habit for losing possession can be punished by opponents quick in transition and clinical on the counter-attack. When Barca went three matches without a win, he was dropped. ""He is not yet fully aware of what it means to play at the highest level,"" said France coach Didier Deschamps last month. ""He still needs to learn,"" Valverde said last weekend. It would be a surprise if Dembele was not at least given the chance at Camp Nou against Inter, who are level on points with Barca in Group B, having also beaten PSV Eindhoven and Tottenham. Second place might have been the limit of Inter's ambitions when the draw was made but with Messi out, they might spy an opportunity. ""It is a pity,"" said Mauro Icardi. ""And a big blow for them."""
392,20/10/2018,23:56,Barca victory tarnished as injured Messi set to miss three weeks,Lionel Messi is expected to be out for three weeks with a fractured right arm but his last contribution was to help send Barcelona back to the top of La Liga on Saturday.,"Messi scored and then went off injured as Barca beat Sevilla 4-2 at Camp Nou, in a six-goal thriller that never looked like ending in anything other than a home win. Any joy at jumping above in-form Sevilla, however, was tarnished by Messi's injury, which will now rule him out of next weekend's Clasico against Real Madrid. A Barcelona club statement read: ""Tests carried out on Leo Messi have confirmed that he has a fracture of the radial bone in his right arm. He will be out for approximately three weeks."" It means Messi will also miss the Champions League match at home to Inter Milan on Wednesday, and probably the return trip to Italy on November 6, as well as league games against Real Madrid and Rayo Vallecano in between. ""It is clear it is a blow,"" Barca coach Ernesto Valverde said. ""We know what he gives us and we know what he does to the opposition. ""We have to prepare ourselves, it is clear we are going to notice the loss of Messi but we have players that can cover."" Messi fell to the ground following a tussle with Sevilla's Franco Vazquez and, as his right hand tried to cushion the landing, his elbow appeared to buckle. Messi was helped off the pitch by medical staff and, despite having his right arm heavily strapped, he was finally substituted in the 26th minute. ""Emotionally, we know when he is there, he gives us more confidence because he is the best in the world,"" Gerard Pique said. ""But it does not have to affect us."" Philippe Coutinho had opened the scoring and Luis Suarez's penalty, which he also earned, made sure of victory before a three-goal flurry in the final 11 minutes. Pablo Sarabia and Luis Muriel twice reduced the deficit to two for Sevilla, either side of a sweeping volley from Ivan Rakitic. Even without Messi, Barca might be confident of seeing off Madrid, whose slump had continued on Saturday with a 2-1 loss at home to Levante. Barcelona, meanwhile, seem to have sparked a rival. Since drawing at home to Athletic Bilbao last month to make it three games without a win, they have blown Tottenham away at Wembley, taken a point away to Valencia and now eased past Sevilla, who came into the weekend top of the table. Barca fans had chanted, ""don't touch the badge"" before kick-off after president Josep Maria Bartomeu had announced plans to change the club crest had been shelved. They were soon celebrating a goal too as Coutinho bent a sumptuous right-footed shot into the far corner with only two minutes on the clock. Messi doubled the advantage, racing clear on the counter-attack before jinking inside and curling into the bottom corner with his left foot. It was his last significant involvement. ""He did enough didn't he?"" Sevilla coach Pablo Machin said aftwerwards. Ousmane Dembele was Messi's replacement but Suarez took on the mantle, too quick to his own heavy touch and brought down by Sevilla goalkeeper Tomas Vaclik. Suarez buried the penalty. The game seemed up but Marc-Andre ter Stegen had to make a brilliant double save to deny Sarabia and then Wissam Ben Yedder with his thigh. Sarabia gave Sevilla hope with 11 minutes left, his shot deflecting off Clement Lenglet and in, but Rakitic took the steam out of any comeback with a well-struck volley. Muriel added what proved only to be a consolation in injury time."
393,19/10/2018,03:40,Barcelona and Real scrap for revival as Clasico looms,"Real Madrid and Barcelona cannot avoid heading into next week's Clasico under pressure but each have two games to lift the mood at least, ahead of the pivotal clash at the Camp Nou.","Eight games into La Liga and both Julen Lopetegui and Ernesto Valverde are feeling the heat, forced to defend poor runs that have seen their teams manage a combined total of two wins from their last 10 games. Madrid's slump feels the more entrenched, given they are without a goal in 360 minutes, discounting injury time, and three of their last four matches have ended in defeat. While Barca can point to their riveting win at Wembley over Tottenham, and then a point gained in Valencia, Madrid have endured successive setbacks away to CSKA Moscow and Alaves. They have two home games to clear the fog, and winnable ones too, against Levante in La Liga on Saturday before Viktoria Plzen visit on Tuesday in the Champions League. A pair of victories, and just as importantly, some goals, would earn Lopetegui much-needed breathing space. He is already being asked about his future in the same job he sacrificed Spain and the World Cup for in June. ""A coach does not think about this, we are in October,"" Lopetegui said after Alaves' first league win at home to Real Madrid since 1931. ""The only positive is we are close to the top of the league, the most important thing now is to recover the injured players and then calmness will come by winning games and scoring goals."" Injuries have certainly not helped. Marcelo and Isco are both expected back against Levante while Gareth Bale has been training again this week, albeit on his own. All three would provide an attacking boost. Karim Benzema is struggling with a hamstring strain but the forward might anyway be less missed. Seven games without a goal have seen calls grow louder for Mariano Diaz to be given a chance and Lopetegui may now be able to oblige, without the unwanted dig at the Frenchman's confidence. Lopetegui is also right to draw comfort from the table, as Barcelona's stumbles mean his team are only two points off the top, where Sevilla are the surprise frontrunners. Barca face Sevilla on Saturday night in an unexpected duel of first and second, where the onus will be on Valverde's men to make a statement. Sevilla have won four league games on the bounce and, in one of those, thumped Real Madrid 3-0. They also continue a run of blockbuster ties for Barca, which has already included Spurs and Valencia, and will stretch deep into November. After Sevilla, they play at home to Inter Milan on Wednesday and Real Madrid on Sunday. At the start of next month, they face Inter again in Italy, Atletico Madrid and Real Betis. A win this weekend and Barcelona might feel a corner has been turned. Level with the Catalans are Atletico Madrid, whose resurgence after a slow start is already in full swing. ""We are the annoying team, that will always come between Barcelona and Real Madrid,"" said Antoine Griezmann last week. Atletico visit struggling Villarreal on Saturday, looking to make it eight games unbeaten. The real surprise leaders of the weekend, however, could be Alaves, who were playing in Spanish football's third tier only five years ago. They will go top, even if only temporarily, with a win away at Celta Vigo on Friday. Fixtures (all times GMT)"

The 31-year-old was not in court in Munich to hear the judge's verdict as he played in Chile's 1-0 win over Mexico on Wednesday, which ""professionally prevented"" his appearance in Bavaria, his lawyer said. Vidal and his half-brother were both found guilty after attacking another man at Munich's Crowns Club in September 2017, which was reportedly caught on security camera. Vidal's half sibling Sandrino, 25, was fined 18,000 euros, based on 120 days salary at 150 euros per day -- a higher penalty because he also threw a glass during the incident. Since joining Barcelona Vidal has struggled for game time in the star-studded midfield, only twice being included in the starting line-up in eight Spanish league matches."
395,17/10/2018,17:49,Ex Barca boss Rosell faces February trial for money laundering,"Former Barcelona president Sandro Rosell will go on trial for money laundering in February, Spanish judicial sources revealed on Wednesday.","Rosell, his wife and four others are accused of ""large-scale money laundering"" of at least 19.9 million euros ($23 million) since 2006 relating to television rights and sponsorship in Brazil. Prosecutors at the Madrid-based National Court have called for the ex Barca boss to be jailed for 11 years and fined 59 million euros. Rosell and his wife are accused of hiding money illegally obtained by Ricardo Teixeira, the former head of the Brazilian Football Confederation. Rosell had previously lived and worked in Brazil, where he forged numerous business links. The case centres on a deal signed by Teixeira in 2006 with a company based in the Cayman Islands for the television rights to 24 Brazil friendly matches. Altogether, Rosell and his wife allegedly received close to 15 million euros in their accounts as part of the deal. They pocketed 6.6 million euros with 8.4 million destined for Teixeira, prosecutors say. The trial will open on February 25, and run until March 27."

The trip raises the possibility of a reunion with Andres Iniesta, who joined Japan's Vissel Kobe in May after 22 years at Barcelona. Fernando Torres also departed La Liga in the summer for the J-League, where the striker plays for Sagan Tosu. ""Barca will travel to Asia next summer to get closer to local fans and partners, and plans to visit China and Japan during the pre-season, as part of the global expansion and brand development strategy,"" the club wrote in a statement. ""Football is growing at a fast pace in countries like China and Japan, where the club not only wants to develop commercially, but also to capture and retain fans."" Barcelona president Josep Maria Bartomeu has emphasised the importance of the Asian market to the club, who have a stated aim of reaching one billion euros in revenue by 2021. The announcement also comes after Barca agreed a four-year deal with Japanese e-commerce company Rakuten to become their main shirt sponsor from last season."

""Tests carried out this morning confirm that first team player Thomas Vermaelen has a right hamstring injury. He will be sidelined for approximately six weeks,"" the club said in a statement. The injury leaves Barcelona short of options in defence as the team is already without French centre-back Samuel Umtiti who has a knee injury, with only Gerard Pique and Clement Lenglet at their disposal."
398,11/10/2018,20:09,Turkey football star Turan probed over 'fight with singer',"Istanbul prosecutors have opened an investigation after Turkish football star Arda Turan, currently on Barcelona's books, was reportedly involved in a fight with a Turkish pop star in which he broke the singer's nose.","Turan, who is this season playing for Istanbul side Basaksehir while on loan from Barcelona, was summoned to give a statement to Istanbul police over the fight with singer Berkay Sahin, state-run news agency Anadolu reported. The Hurriyet daily said he was released after giving a statement to police in questioning that lasted for three hours. Turkish media said that Turan became involved in the fight earlier this week with Sahin outside a nightclub in Istanbul that ended with the singer's nose broken. In a bizarre sequence of events, Turan then went to the hospital where the singer was being treated clutching a gun and begging to be shot and forgiven, the Haberturk daily said. The attacking midfielder has for years been Turkey's best known footballer and is a supporter of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. But he has become notorious for poor behaviour both on and off the field. He was banned for a record 16 games by the Turkish football authorities in May after he shoved and verbally abused a referee in a game for Basaksehir. Turan had joined Basaksehir last season on loan from Barcelona, where he had largely endured an unhappy spell on the bench after joining from Atletico Madrid. Erdogan attended Turan's wedding when the footballer married Aslihan Dogan in March last year. He won 100 caps for Turkey but looks unlikely to return to international duty in a new-look side."

The former Juventus man is up against Croatia's Ivan Rakitic and Brazilian trio Philippe Coutinho, Arthur and Rafinha for places in a quality-packed Barca midfield. He recently took his frustration out by posting messages on his Instagram account featuring angry or frustrated emojis, notably following Barca's 4-2 Champions League win over Tottenham. Segura, speaking to the Catalan daily Sport, said: ""A professional has to show respect for his team-mates, for the dressing room and for the coach even if the decisions that are taken are not always the ones he expects."" ""Vidal knows he's made a mistake and that he's lacked respect for his teammates. I'm sure he will make amends."" Barca coach Ernesto Valverde, meanwhile, suggested he was not aware of Vidal's complaints. ""We're a team,"" Valverde said at the weekend. ""I don't know what the players are putting on social media but no one tells me anything. ""Maybe Arturo is angry because of a domestic accident, what do I know?"""
400,07/10/2018,23:44,Barcelona held at Valencia as Sevilla go top in Spain,Sevilla are the surprise leaders in La Liga after Lionel Messi could only rescue a draw for Barcelona away to Valencia on Sunday.,"Barca started the day at the top of the pile and then Atletico Madrid enjoyed a couple of hours at the summit after edging past Real Betis at the Wanda Metropolitano. Sevilla, however, usurped them both by beating 10-man Celta Vigo and Barca were unable to reclaim the lead in the late kick-off, held by Valencia to a 1-1 draw at the Mestalla. It means Ernesto Valverde's side are a point behind Sevilla and without a league victory now in four matches, a dip that comes in stark contrast to their enthralling triumph over Tottenham in the Champions League on Wednesday. Messi, mesmeric at Wembley, was on target again, his driven shot into the corner cancelling out a bizarre opener for Valencia, scored after just 78 seconds. Ezequiel Garay claimed the final touch but Daniel Parejo's corner had been flicked on by Geoffrey Kondogbia, missed by Thomas Vermaelen and skimmed through off Gerard Pique's back. Philippe Coutinho should have won it for Barcelona in the second half but took too long to pull the trigger and Jose Gaya was able to make the block. ""When we don't win we always think of it as two points lost,"" Valverde said. ""After Leo's goal, we tried everything but they defended well and we couldn't get the goal we wanted."" For Valencia, now unbeaten in six, this was another step in the right direction, even if they are finding it difficult to turn draws into wins. They move up to 14th. ""Leaving Barca for 90 minutes practically without a chance means that we have worked very well,"" Valencia coach Marcelino said. Atletico and Sevilla's success also pushed struggling Real Madrid down to fourth. Julen Lopetegui's side endured a shock defeat away by Alaves on Saturday. For all the talk of crisis at the top two clubs, however, this was Sevilla's day. Pablo Sarabia headed in to open the scoring at the Ramon Sanchez Pizjuan before Celta defender Nestor Araujo was sent off for picking up two yellow cards in as many minutes. Wissam Ben Yedder doubled the lead and while substitute Sofiane Boufal pulled one back for Celta, it proved too little to late. The victory is Sevilla's fourth on the bounce in the league. ""At the the moment we are playing with a lot of confidence,"" Ben Yedder said. ""We are showing we can be consistent."" Atletico had earlier continued their own strong run after Angel Correa's goal proved decisive in an untidy 1-0 win over Real Betis. Atletico sat seven points behind Real and Barca after winning only one of their opening four league games but as their rivals have stumbled, Diego Simeone's side have sprung into form. ""We look at everything quietly and continue to improve,"" Simeone said. ""We have grown."" Simeone can take some of the credit too for the latest victory, after throwing on both Correa and Thomas Partey as substitutes in the second half. Thomas provided the assist. ""When the players respond, the coaches look better,"" Simeone said. ""The teams that challenge up the top of the table are there because of the players they can bring off the bench."" The contest was billed as a classic clash of styles, with Atletico's stubborn defence up against the free-flowing Real Betis, who lit up the league last season with their flurry of goals. ""A great coach once said, the best Plan B is always to do Plan A better,"" said Betis coach Quique Setien. They could also have gone top with a win, such is the scrunched nature of the top half, but instead Betis slip to eighth. ""We have less points than our performances deserve,"" Setien added."

402,04/10/2018,15:13,"Messi, Coutinho, Arthur all impress as Barca blow away Spurs",Lionel Messi appears a man on a mission in the Champions League this season after making it five goals in two games following Barcelona's 4-2 win over Tottenham on Wednesday.,"Three quarter-final exits in a row have left Barca, and Messi, desperate to make amends. He began with a hat-trick against PSV Eindhoven at the Camp Nou last month and delivered another statement performance at Wembley. ""He is simply the best in the world,"" said Jordi Alba, who himself provided a trio of assists, but was still left out of the Spain squad on Thursday. ""We are a team together - but Leo makes us better in everything."" A mesmeric display included Messi scoring two, hitting the post twice, and having a creative hand in the other pair of goals scored by Philippe Coutinho and Ivan Rakitic. It was a familiar tale of woe for English opposition, against whom the Argentinian has now scored 21 goals and registered six assists in total, more than any other nationality or club. He is already the top scorer in this season's Champions League, two ahead of Paulo Dybala, Edin Dzeko and Neymar. ""The image of Barca beating a team of great quality, despite their injuries, was a clear warning that this year the Champions League is Messi's obsession,"" wrote Barcelona daily Mundo Deportivo. ""The Argentinian gave no respite to Tottenham,"" wrote Diario Sport. ""They could do no more than hold their breath every time Leo touched the ball."" For Barca coach Ernesto Valverde, it was simple: ""Messi always delivers."" After a turbulent week, which had included two draws and a defeat in La Liga, Valverde rolled the dice again, replacing Ousmane Dembele with Arthur Melo and pushing Philippe Coutinho out of the middle trio and into the attack. Coutinho is considered by Barcelona to be the natural successor to Andres Iniesta but he was lethal further forward while the 22-year-old Arthur, on his first Champions League start, showed maturity beyond his years. ""Arthur's first recital as a Barca player could not have come at a better time or in a better place,"" wrote La Vanguardia. ""The person in charge of his signing deserves a medal."" Diario Sport even compared Arthur to Xavi. ""A team like Barça needs talent and vision in midfield and Arthur brings it,"" it read. ""At a huge stadium like Wembley, he did not crumble."" The success of Arthur and Coutinho, however, raises question marks for Dembele and Arturo Vidal, with the latter the more experienced option to replace Coutinho in midfield. Vidal, who came on in the 87th minute, posted a photo of an angry face on Instagram shortly after the match, while this was a setback too for Dembele, after an encouraging start to the season. Both could be given a chance to impress in a crunch game away to Valencia on Sunday, when Barcelona will be hoping to transfer their faultless form in Europe to La Liga. ""If we played all the matches at the same level as this one, we would win all the competitions every year,"" said Alba. After Valencia, Barca's difficult month continues with three home games, starting against Sevilla and ending with 'El Clasico' against Real Madrid on October 28. In between, they could all but wrap up qualification to the Champions League last 16 by seeing off fellow challengers Inter Milan. ""Nothing has changed,"" Valverde said. ""We are a team that tries to take the game, tries to dominate, but football is the way it is. ""When you go through a time when you have not won some games, it is difficult to react as the team has done. We have reacted."""
403,04/10/2018,01:12,'He's the best': Messi rocks sloppy Spurs,Mauricio Pochettino admitted Tottenham had only themselves to blame for Lionel Messi's mesmerising masterclass in Barcelona's 4-2 Champions League win at Wembley.,"Pochettino's side found it impossible to subdue Messi as Barcelona ended their three-match winless streak in emphatic style. The Spanish champions punished a howler from Tottenham goalkeeper Hugo Lloris to take a second minute lead through Philippe Coutinho. Ivan Rakitic volleyed a stunning second goal for Barcelona before Harry Kane reduced the deficit after the break. That set the stage for Messi to seize the spotlight once again as he netted twice either side of Erik Lamela's deflected effort for Tottenham. Messi's brace was just reward for an irresistible display from the Argentina legend. Messi already has five goals in the Champions League this season after hitting a hat-trick against PSV Eindhoven in Barcelona's group opener. But Tottenham boss Pochettino claimed his side had made it easy on Messi with the error-prone start that forced them to throw players forward, leaving spaces at the back that the deadly Messi was able to exploit. ""Messi doesn't surprise me. We conceded the first goal and it is very difficult because that sets the game. We paid for that,"" Pochettino said. ""We had to give spaces when we were looking for a result. What happens is players like him can finish you off. ""After 45 minutes we didn't concede one chance to Messi. Of course in the second half when it's 2-0 and you give more space, it's so difficult to stop this type of player. ""He is the best in the world. With a lot of space it is unbelievable how he runs and dribbles. ""In the second half he was decisive. He's got that capacity and hunger for scoring."" Pochettino was frustrated that Tottenham gifted the initiative to Barca so easily, but he took heart from the way they pushed their star-studded opponents harder in the second half. ""Against a team that needed to win, to concede after two minutes, it destroyed the plan,"" Pochettino said. ""After making those mistakes, the first half was difficult for the team to be confident and play the way we planned. ""It's hard to assess the game. When you play a team like Barcelona you cannot afford to concede these type of chances. ""But for me, most important was the second half. We did everything to come back. We showed character and I'm so proud of the players."" Tottenham's hopes of qualifying for the last 16 from Group B are now in grave danger after two successive defeats. Having lost to Inter Milan and Barcelona, Pochettino knows Tottenham must win their next European fixture at PSV Eindhoven later in October. ""We still need to play four games. We are going to have it in our hands to be in the next stage,"" he said. ""Of course it will be tough because now there are must-win games."" After three La Liga games without a win, including a shock loss to lowly Leganes, this was a morale-boosting success for Barcelona. Another setback would have added to the sudden sense of crisis around the club. And relieved Barcelona boss Ernesto Valverde admitted he was pleased with his side's stylish response to their recent woes. ""It's true that after a few bad results it was very important to do well today and we responded very well,"" he said. ""We want to always dominate and we did. Our response was very strong and effective. ""It was a great game against a difficult team."" Valverde was especially impressed with the way Barca stood up to late Tottenham pressure. ""The game was very intense. When it was 3-2, Tottenham made it very difficult for us,"" he added. ""We had a few problems in the game but we solved them and we just want to continue like this. ""I'm very happy with the players. Today's game was key for us."""

Messi, who had earlier twice hit the post, then got on the scoresheet in between goals from Harry Kane and Erik Lamela, before the Argentina superstar grabbed his second late on to seal victory. ""After a few bad results it was important to do well today. Our response was very good,"" said Barca coach Ernesto Valverde. Barca head Group B on six points alongside Inter Milan, but Mauricio Pochettino's side face a vital double-header against PSV Eindhoven after failing to collect a point from their opening two matches. The Tottenham boss admitted Spurs had few answers for Messi as his team was left with an uphill struggle to reach the knockout stages. ""He's a fantastic player,"" said Pochettino. ""His average performance is this type of game. He's always above everything."" Inter, the last Italian club to win the Champions League in 2010, again recovered from a goal down to beat PSV 2-1 in the Netherlands. A cracking Pablo Rosario strike put PSV ahead, but Inter levelled through Radja Nainggolan moments after visiting goalkeeper Samir Handanovic somehow escaped a red card for handling outside his area. Mauro Icardi, whose late goal stunned Spurs a fortnight ago, was the hero again for Luciano Spalletti's men as he pounced on hesitant defending to net the winner on the hour. PSG rebounded from their 3-2 defeat by Liverpool with an attacking masterclass against 1991 European Cup winners Red Star at the Parc des Princes. Neymar curled in a sublime free-kick to open the scoring on 20 minutes, quickly doubling his tally before Edinson Cavani, Angel di Maria and Kylian Mbappe also found the target. Former Germany international Marko Marin popped up with a consolation for Red Star, with Neymar completing his hat-trick from another stunning free-kick. ""I really liked the effort made by the whole team, but Neymar was sensational,"" said PSG coach Thomas Tuchel. ""He is one of the best players in Europe and that is very, very important for us."" Carlo Ancelotti's Napoli top Group C on four points after Lorenzo Insigne delivered a 90th-minute winner at home to Liverpool, who are level on three alongside PSG. Dries Mertens hit the bar for Napoli late on, but there was still time for Insigne to nick all three points at the death as he slid to poke in a cross from Jose Callejon. ""Tonight we showed this group won't just be hard for Napoli, but for everyone involved,"" said Ancelotti. ""It means a lot to us to have won against the finalists from last year."" Antoine Griezmann scored two goals to lift Atletico Madrid, last season's Europa League winners, to a 3-1 victory over Club Brugge in Spain. Arnaut Groeneveld cancelled out Griezmann's opener with a thunderous strike from the left wing, but the France international restored Atletico's lead before Koke made the points safe in stoppage time. ""I said it last season and I'll say it again -- Griezmann is the best player in the world,"" said Atletico coach Diego Simeone. Borussia Dortmund lead Atletico at the top of Group A on goal difference following their 3-0 defeat of a struggling Monaco outfit. Jacob Bruun Larsen broke the deadlock in Germany shortly after his introduction as a half-time substitute, with Paco Alcacer finding the net just minutes after smacking a penalty against the bar. Marco Reus fired in a third from a Bruun Larsen cross, leaving Dortmund and Atletico on six points apiece ahead of their upcoming home-and-away meetings. In Group D, American international midfielder Weston McKennie hit an 88th-minute winner as struggling Schalke edged Lokomotiv Moscow 1-0. Porto are joint-top with Schalke following a 1-0 win over Galatasaray courtesy of Moussa Marega's second-half goal in Portugal."
405,03/10/2018,23:06,"Messi, Rakitic light up Wembley as stylish Barca sink Spurs",Lionel Messi's Wembley masterclass and a sublime strike from Ivan Rakitic got Barcelona back in the groove as they clinched a pulsating 4-2 victory against Tottenham on Wednesday.,"Ernesto Valverde's side arrived in London for the Champions League Group B tie amid a mini-crisis after failing to win their last three La Liga games. But the Spanish champions have fond memories of the English national stadium, where they won the European Cup in 1992 and 2011, and they were revitalised by the sight of the iconic venue. Aided by a rush of blood from Tottenham goalkeeper Hugo Lloris, Barcelona went ahead after only 92 seconds as Philippe Coutinho scored their quickest Champions League goal since 2005. Rakitic stole the spotlight midway through the first half when the Croatia midfielder struck with a thunderous half-volley. In a dramatic second half, Tottenham's Harry Kane reduced the deficit before the majestic Messi added Barcelona's third. Erik Lamela's deflected strike kept Tottenham in the hunt, but Messi capped a mesmerising performance in the final moments to give Barca a second successive group-stage victory as they emerged from their recent struggles. Tottenham are in danger of crashing out at the group stage for the second time in three years. Mauricio Pochettino's side have lost both of their group matches after a 2-1 defeat at Inter Milan in their opener. They head to PSV Eindhoven for their next European fixture on October 24 knowing a win is essential as they already trail Barca and Inter by six points. It took Messi less than two minutes to show reports of Barca's demise were greatly exaggerated. Taking possession on the halfway line, Messi was pressured by Son Heung-Min, but his devastating response was simply sublime. Messi twisted away from Son as if swatting away an annoying fly, then unfurled a perfectly-weighted pass that picked out Jordi Alba's run behind Tottenham defender Kieran Trippier. Alba alertly picked out Coutinho on the edge on the penalty area and, with Lloris having needlessly rushed off his line, the former Liverpool forward was able to fire into the empty net. It was a bad mistake by Lloris in the French World Cup winner's first appearance since August after a torrid period marred by a thigh injury and his arrest for drink-driving. Tottenham were decimated by injuries to Christian Eriksen, Dele Alli and Mousa Dembele and it took 25 minutes before they finally had a shot when Kane brought a routine save from Marc-Andre ter Stegen. That was only a brief respite for Tottenham as Valverde's team doubled their lead in the 28th minute. Once again the creation and execution were breath-taking. Messi clipped a pass to Luis Suarez before Coutinho smartly hooked the ball back from the touchline to the edge of the area, where Rakitic launched himself into the air for an agile half-volley that flashed past Lloris. Messi was toying with Tottenham and it seemed only a matter of how many Barcelona would win by when he glided away for a shot that struck a post early in the second half. Spellbound by Messi's magic, Tottenham backed off again moments later as the striker hit the woodwork for a second time. Yet Kane gave Tottenham a lifeline when the England forward netted against the run of play in the 52nd minute. Powering into the Barca area with intent, Kane side-stepped Nelson Semedo and planted a powerful low strike into the far corner for his 10th goal in 12 Champions League appearances. Messi had the perfect response in the 56th minute when he cantered onto Alba's pass and side-footed past Lloris. Tottenham refused to surrender and Lamela set up a tense finale when his 66th minute shot deflected off Clement Lenglet and flew past ter Stegen. But Messi had the last word when he slotted home from Alba's cross to ease Barca's nerves in the 90th minute."
406,02/10/2018,20:32,Kane eyes matching Messi's goal spree,Harry Kane has set his sights on matching the goalscoring standards set by Lionel Messi as the Tottenham Hotspur striker prepares for his shoot-out with the Barcelona legend.,"Kane and Messi will be the leading men at Wembley on Wednesday when Tottenham host Barcelona in a crucial Champions League clash. Messi has already scored eight times this season, including a hat-trick in Barca's European demolition of PSV Eindhoven, taking his career tally for the club to well over 500 goals. Kane has been prolific for Tottenham over the last four years, but he admits he needs to become even more ruthless with his finishing to approach the jaw-dropping statistics compiled by the Argentina forward. ""He set the standard, he and Cristiano Ronaldo have gone above the normal standard, when they are scoring 50 or 60 goals a season,"" Kane said on Tuesday. ""As a striker I want to try and match that. He's definitely set the standard for the rest of us and he still is. ""It motivates me to get even better and improve and hopefully one day score as many, if not more, than he has. ""It's a great test for us. As players you want to play against the best in the world and Messi is certainly that, a fantastic player, and we will do our best to stop him."" Kane is now a marked man around Europe himself, though, having outgunned the likes of Messi and Ronaldo to win the Golden Boot at the World Cup. The England captain started the season slowly with fears he, like many of his Spurs team-mates, is suffering a World Cup hangover. But he scored twice at Huddersfield Town on Saturday to take his tally for the season to five goals. ""He is a difference maker,"" said Barcelona coach Ernesto Valverde. ""He is a danger with any ball played into him. We have to bear him in mind and expect him to be at his best."" Tottenham lost their opening Champions League group game at Inter Milan, leaving the Premier League side with little margin for error as they try to qualify for the knockout stages. Barca have wobbled domestically of late, with two draws and a defeat, to La Liga's bottom side Leganes, in their last three matches. And their record on the road in the Champions League in recent seasons is abysmal, winning just one and scoring two goals in their last seven away European games. Wembley, though, brings back special memories for the Catalans, who have won the European Cup twice at the home of English football, in 1992 and 2011. ""We are aware that away from home it has been more difficult for us,"" added Valverde. ""We are prepared to change that and there couldn't be a better scene to do so."" Spurs took the scalp of Champions League holders Real Madrid at Wembley last season, and Kane is hoping for a repeat against the Spanish champions. ""We've got to prove we can beat the best teams in the world and we need to do that against Barcelona,"" added Kane. ""Barcelona might play better than Real Madrid did last season. We need to produce that same energy, the crowd were amazing that night. ""If we can get them on their feet as soon as possible, create some chances and take one or two it would put us in a great position."" Spurs, though, will have to deal with a mounting injury list with Christian Eriksen, Mousa Dembele, Jan Vertonghen and Dele Alli ruled out, although captain Hugo Lloris could return in goal."
407,02/10/2018,18:18,Barca keep open possibility of January signings as revenues rise,Barcelona have left the door open to buying a player in January despite not including mid-season signings in the club's budget announced on Tuesday.,"Barca announced record revenues of 914 million euros for last season, with a net profit of 13 million euros after tax. They are predicting another revenue jump to 960 million euros for 2018-19. The budget does not anticipate players joining in January but club chief executive Oscar Grau insisted there is still a chance of new arrivals. Barcelona have been heavily linked with a move for Paul Pogba, whose future is uncertain at Manchester United. ""This budget does not provide for any signings in January but as I always say, a budget is a statement of intent,"" Grau said during the presentation of the club's economic report. ""If there is a demand, we will study it carefully. The budget does not provide for it but we can find ways to adapt. The message is that it is not in our plans but if it is financially viable, we do not close the door."" President Josep Maria Bartomeu wants Barcelona to record revenues of 1 billion euros by 2021, an ambition that is shared by Real Madrid chief Florentino Perez. Pogba cost Manchester United 105 million euros in 2016 but, it is thought, the World Cup winning midfielder would bring significant revenue benefits. Barca's latest revenue rise for 2017-18 was pushed by a boost of 155 million euros in transfer income. The club sold Neymar to Paris Saint-Germain for 222 million euros in August 2017. The wage bill for sport, which had risen from 365 million euros to 520 million euros last season, is expected to drop to 492 million euros for 2018-19. This follows a number of player departures in the summer, including Andres Iniesta and Paulinho. Barcelona also confirmed on Tuesday that work on the Camp Nou is expected to begin at the end of the season. Upgrades are due to include a roof and increase capacity from around 99,000 to 105,000, at a cost of 400 million euros."

410,02/10/2018,04:16,Messi back at Wembley looking to make up for lost time in Europe,"As Lionel Messi lay on the Wembley grass, his left hand grasping the Champions League trophy and his right pumping the air, he must have thought there would be many more European glory nights to come.","It was 2011 and Barca had beaten Manchester United 3-1. ""No one has given us a hiding like that,"" Alex Ferguson said. They were so much better than the rest that many predicted a decade of European dominance after that mesmerising display. ""We have a challenge with Barcelona, we all do,"" Ferguson said. Messi had scored his side's second. Barcelona bounced in front of the photographers, the club's name carved into the trophy for a fourth time. For the 23-year-old Messi at the front, it was a third Champions League triumph in six years. But there has been only one in the seven seasons since, when Luis Enrique led his 2015 Barca to a brilliant treble. To make matters worse, arch-rivals Real Madrid have been crowned European champions four times and three times in a row since 2016. ""They have made history and it's a thorn in our side,"" Luis Suarez said. Messi returns to Wembley to face Tottenham on Wednesday with happy memories but all of this weighing on his shoulders. For most players, four Champions League titles is unthinkable but for Messi, playing through this era of Barcelona, it feels light. ""It's time we won the Champions League,"" Messi told Catalunya Radio last month. The club feel it too. Winning La Liga has become more routine than remarkable. Even last season's double barely laid a finger on the disappointment of a third straight quarter-final exit, following a collapse at Roma when the Italian side overturned Barca's 4-1 first leg lead. Ernesto Valverde bore the brunt of the criticism, the most popular slight being that he exhausted the players in a league that had long been won. The other, always lurking, was that he had relied too much on Messi. Both have bubbled ever since and then burst to the surface last week when Barca, with key players rested, failed to record a win in three consecutive league games. They drew at home to Girona and lost to bottom club Leganes. Valverde persisted, and it was Messi's turn on the bench against Athletic Bilbao. He came on, and set up the equaliser, but that only gave greater weight to the argument Barcelona cannot do without him. ""LaMessidependencia,"" (""the Messi dependence"") Madrid daily AS termed it on Monday, before listing all the relevant statistics. But the problem is perhaps less how to cope without Messi than how to overcome deficiencies elsewhere in the team. Barca's defence, the platform of their domestic success last season, is shaking, with fingers pointing at Gerard Pique whose mistakes have become too frequent to be ignored. The midfield, without Andres Iniesta, lacks thrust while new signings Arturo Vidal, Clement Lenglet and Malcom are still bedding in. As for Messi, pressure is nothing new. Argentina proved at the World Cup that he cannot carry a poor team, but he can certainly inspire a good one. In 2011, they relied on him too. ""We have great players but without him we would not be able to play the way we do,"" Pep Guardiola said, as his team celebrated on the Wembley turf. ""We have hard work, talent and tactics that help, but Messi is unique, irreplaceable. He gives us that something extra."""
411,02/10/2018,04:13,Barca clash has special meaning for Spurs boss Pochettino,"In dire need of a famous victor to revive his team's Champions League campaign, Mauricio Pochettino will draw on the memory of the most cherished success of his career when Tottenham host Barcelona on Wednesday.","Pochettino's side can ill afford a damaging defeat against the Spanish champions after conceding two late goals to lose their opening Group B match 2-1 at Inter Milan. A loss against Lionel Messi and company at Wembley would leave Tottenham facing a tough task qualifying for the knockout stages in their remaining four games. It is a perilous situation that leads Tottenham boss Pochettino to recall the day his Espanyol team upset the odds in the Barcelona derby to start his journey to managerial stardom. Pochettino's three years in charge of Espanyol came after he spent nine years with the club, in two spells as a player. That time in the trenches made Pochettino a favourite son of Espanyol's fans, giving the Argentine a special affinity for the rivalry with Barca. Given Barcelona's history and financial might in contrast to the less glamorous Espanyol, it is little surprise Pochettino found it tough to get the better of the superpower from the other side of town. In nine local derbies against Barca, Pochettino's team managed only one win, with five defeats and three draws. But that lone success remains a touchstone moment for Pochettino. Back in February 2009, Pochettino secured the first win of his managerial career in the most unlikely circumstances as lowly Espanyol stunned Pep Guardiola's star-studded Barca in the Camp Nou. It was Espanyol's first victory at the home of their rivals for 27 years and, even now, Pochettino can't quite believe it happened. ""I don't know how we did it. All the people were saying Espanyol were dead and had no chance,"" he said. ""It was a special victory and an unbelievable memory."" Pochettino's special relationship with Espanyol has seen him refuse to contemplate the possibility of ever managing Barcelona, even though it would rank as a step up from Tottenham. The 46-year-old believes taking charge at the Camp Nou would be a betrayal of the deep roots he planted during his time in Catalonia. ""It motivates me being a periquito (Espanyol's nickname) and living so many years in Barcelona,"" he said in quotes reported by Marca this week. ""Going back to the city is always nice and playing against Barcelona, too. It is always motivating."" Asked whether it is certain that he will never manage Barca, he replied: ""It's something that is more than understood. ""I have a lot of friends in Barcelona, who are from the Blaugrana and for whom I have enormous respect, but my path, and that of Barcelona, are different, opposite directions, and coaching there would be impossible."" Having enjoyed an impressive Champions League group stage win over Real Madrid last year, Pochettino knows Tottenham are capable of toppling Barca as well. Crucially, they go into the game with Harry Kane back in form after the England striker shrugged off his early-season lethargy to net twice in Saturday's 2-0 win at Huddersfield. Tottenham haven't been at their best so far this term, but neither have Barca, with Ernesto Valverde's side failing to win any of their last three league games. They did start their European challenge with a 4-0 drubbing of PSV Eindhoven however and Pochettino admits the long ball style played by Huddersfield at the weekend wasn't the best preparation for facing smooth-passing Barca. ""We are the third or the second team in the Premier League with most possession, but this was a different game,"" Pochettino said. ""It was a game where the ball was more in the air than on the grass. I think if you were here you realised it was a massive fight between both teams. ""We'll see what happens on Wednesday. I'm sure it will be a completely different game than it was at Huddersfield."""
412,29/09/2018,19:16,Valverde accepts blame for Barca defeat after Messi rested,Ernesto Valverde admitted his gamble to rest Lionel Messi backfired on Saturday as Barcelona drew 1-1 at home to Athletic Bilbao to make it three games without a victory.,"Messi came on in the 55th minute at the Camp Nou and it was the Argentinian's shot that was turned in by another substitute, Munir El Haddadi, with six minutes left to play. By then, however, Oscar de Marcos had given Bilbao a deserved first-half lead and despite a late rally, Messi and Barca could not find a winner. After drawing at home to Girona and being beaten by Leganes, Barca will head to Wembley to face Tottenham in the Champions League on Wednesday short of rhythm and lacking confidence. The last time Bilbao took a point at the Camp Nou, Valverde was sitting in the away team's dug-out, in 2004, during his first spell as Bilbao coach. Now in charge at Barca, he will have questions to answer, having made the bold decision to rest Messi with Spurs in mind, along with Sergio Busquets. Barca will surrender top spot in La Liga if Real Madrid beat Atletico in the city derby later on Saturday. Bilbao move up to 14th. ""Leaving Messi on the bench is absolutely my responsibility,"" Valverde said. ""He has four games in 10 days and I think it's good for Leo to rest, like Busquets, thinking of the Champions League. ""I know it was the right decision. It was a risk and on this occasion, it didn't come off."" Lack of rotation was chief among the criticisms levelled at Valverde after they crashed out of the Champions League quarter-finals last season, with Luis Suarez admitting he regrets playing 90 minutes against Leganes, three days before the collapse against Roma. Valverde has certainly acted. Of the preferred 11 that started a 4-0 win over PSV Eindhoven two weeks ago, eight have started at least one of the three games since on the bench. The trouble is that seven of those have been required to come on as substitutes. ""We can't expect Messi just to come on and fix things,"" Suarez said. ""We should have won the game before he came on, that's why we are Barca."" Bilbao took the lead in the 41st minute and could have scored earlier. Inaki Williams' attempted lob had Marc-Andre ter Stegen beaten but drifted wide. Ter Stegen had to push Raul Garcia's effort over and was then rounded by Williams but the angle proved too tight. Finally, four minutes before half-time, Ousmane Dembele conceded possession and Markel Susaeta's cross was perfectly weighted to evade the scrambling Sergi Roberto at the back post, where De Marcos slid the ball home. Valverde waited until 10 minutes after the break before introducing Messi and Busquets. Sergi and Arturo Vidal made way, the latter with a glare and shake of the head. Messi got to work. His bending free-kick looked destined for the corner, only for De Marcos to head off the line and another shot hit the post. Munir replaced Dembele and made the difference. Messi shot twice, the first scrambled away by Simon but the second fizzed across the face of goal for Munir to divert in. Barca wanted a winner and they had six minutes to find one. There was to be no late drama, however, as Bilbao claimed a well-deserved point."
413,28/09/2018,16:07,Valverde downplays Umtiti injury fears,Ernesto Valverde is optimistic the knee injury suffered by Barcelona defender Samuel Umtiti will not prove serious.,"Umtiti missed training on Friday ahead of Barca's game at home to Athletic Bilbao on Saturday, with the club confirming his left knee as the problem. Reports in the Spanish press suggested Umtiti could be out for a period of months but Valverde has indicated the Frenchman could return even against Valencia on October 7. In between, Umtiti was already missing Wednesday's Champions League game against Tottenham through suspension. ""He has discomfort in his knee and he cannot play on Wednesday anyway,"" Valverde said. ""We are going to see for the following game, if we can recover him in time. In principle we think he will be with us again soon."" Umtiti's absence against Bilbao and Spurs will likely mean Clement Lenglet, a summer signing from Seville, partnering Gerard Pique in defence. Thomas Vermaelen is another option. Lenglet, however, was sent off on his first start for the club against Girona last weekend while Pique is enduring a dip in form, after his error helped Leganes snatch a shock 2-1 win on Wednesday. Asked about Pique's focus, Valverde said: ""I see that he is very focused on football."" Five points dropped in two games has also allowed Real Madrid and Atletico, who play each other on Saturday, to close the gap at the top of La Liga. Real Madrid are below Barca only on goal difference, while Atleti are now just two points back. ""Of course we need the points,"" Valverde said. ""Any team needs the points but for us even more so, because every team Barcelona loses, there is an earthquake."""
414,28/09/2018,04:27,Real struggles spice up Madrid derby against resurgent Atletico,Diego Simeone described Atletico Madrid's sluggish start to the season as a wake-up call but it was Real Madrid's nightmare in Seville that threw a whole new complexion on Saturday's city derby.,"Atletico were seven points adrift of the top of La Liga after drawing to Eibar two weeks ago, and it was not out of the question their rivals were loading up for a knock-out blow at the Santiago Bernabeu this weekend. 'Atleti' were staring at the possibility of a double-digit deficit which, even as early as October, would have been a big gap to close. ""This is a wake-up call,"" Simeone said at the time. ""It is the best thing that can happen to us."" But after back-to-back wins Atletico come into Saturday's game just two points behind Barcelona, who top the table on goal difference, and Real -- who drew away at Athletic Bilbao before being hammered 3-0 by Sevilla on Wednesday. ""We are getting used to winning again,"" said Atletico's Filipe Luis, while Angel Correa added: ""This is the Atletico we want."" Some had put a line through Atletico a month ago but they will move above Real with a win -- and could even go top if Barca's dip continues at home to Bilbao. What is clear is that neither Barcelona nor Real Madrid were as formidable as their early form suggested, while Atleti were perhaps undersold by their lumbering out of the blocks. All three have shown they are fallible. Real were torn apart in 39 first-half minutes at the Ramon Sanchez Pizjuan, which might have been marked down as a one-off were it not for Sevilla capitalising on the same counter-attacks Espanyol had attempted the week before, but failed to exploit. Atleti have also been wasteful up front. Antoine Griezmann has been indecisive, and Diego Costa is without a league goal since February. There is also Griezmann's recent spat with Real's Sergio Ramos to add another layer of intrigue. Ramos dismissed the Frenchman's suggestion he could do little more to win the Ballon d'Or. ""Ignorance makes you bold,"" Ramos said. Perhaps the difference is Griezmann is yet to win the Champions League and in that regard, he shares the same ache as Barcelona, whose pursuit of success in Europe appears already to be disrupting their domestic rhythm. Many Barca fans have still not forgiven Ernesto Valverde for last season's quarter-final collapse against Roma and chief among the complaints was his failure to rest key players. This week he left out Philippe Coutinho, Ivan Rakitic and Samuel Umtiti against Girona and, albeit with 10 men, they drew 2-2. He left out Luis Suarez and Jordi Alba against Leganes on Wednesday, and they lost 2-1. ""Obviously it is easy now to talk about the rotations,"" Valverde said. ""In the end, matches are analysed on results -- but you can't win the league with only 11 players."" Barca host Bilbao on Saturday, four days before facing Tottenham at Wembley and Umtiti's suspension means one player he cannot leave out against Spurs is Gerard Pique, even if the defender's error-count must be a concern. Clement Lenglet is likely to replace Umtiti in London and could be given another run-out this weekend after being sent off against Girona. Elsewhere, Sevilla travel to Eibar on Saturday while Valencia, still without a win this season, play away at Real Sociedad. Fixtures (all times GMT)"
415,27/09/2018,00:28,Barca and Madrid endure surprise La Liga defeats,Barcelona conceded twice in 68 seconds and Real Madrid were three down at half-time as La Liga's two title favourites were each stunned by surprise defeats on Wednesday night.,"Barca's 2-1 loss to relegation fighters Leganes was the greater shock but Madrid's beating was more emphatic, blown away 3-0 by Sevilla after a torrid 39 minutes at the Ramon Sanchez Pizjuan. For both, it was their first defeat of the season and for both, defensive fragility was the key factor, which will be a major concern with the second round of Champions League games to come next week. By the end, Atletico Madrid, who had cruised to victory over Huesca on Tuesday and play Real on Saturday, were the biggest winners. After a stuttering start, Diego Simeone's side will jump above Real with a win at the Santiago Bernabeu. Sevilla can be a formidable opponent on their own patch but few expected Leganes to inflict what was only Barcelona's second league defeat in 17 months. ""We are in a very difficult moment that was unexpected,"" Barca coach Ernesto Valverde said. Gerard Pique committed the decisive error, his fluffed clearance allowing Oscar Rodriguez to score Leganes' second goal in two incredible minutes at Estadio Municipal de Butarque. Nabil El Zhar had nodded in an equaliser moments before and by the end Philippe Coutinho's sumptuous early volley was reduced to little more than a footnote. After drawing at home to Girona on Sunday, albeit with 10 men, Valverde's selection also came under scrutiny, after he opted to rotate for the second time in three days. Against Girona, it was Coutinho, Ivan Rakitic and Samuel Umtiti on the bench and just as they all had to be called upon in the second half at the Camp Nou, so were Luis Suarez and Jordi Alba this time. ""Of course the coach is responsible, a losing coach always feels responsible,"" Valverde said. ""But obviously it is easy now to talk about the rotations - in the end, matches are analysed on results - but you can't win the league with only eleven players."" Barcelona face Athletic Bilbao on Saturday and then Tottenham at Wembley in the Champions League four days later but one point from two of La Liga's lesser opponents is a concern. So is the form of Pique, who was also at fault against Girona and will almost certainly start against Spurs, with Umtiti suspended. ""You have to judge the whole team, not individuals,"" Sergio Busquets said. ""There are no excuses. We have to concede fewer goals and be more solid. Today the league isn't lost but we might miss these three points at the end of the season."" Real Madrid, who were just kicking off as Leganes closed out, could have pulled three points clear at the top but instead were three down at half-time for the first time in a league game since 2003, also against Sevilla. Twice Jesus Navas sped away on the counter-attack, and twice he found Andre Silva, the first time with a deliberate cut-back, the second when his shot was palmed out for a rebound. Wissam Ben Yedder added a third six minutes before the interval, volleying in from close range after the Madrid defence had pushed out. ""We had a bad first half,"" Madrid coach Julen Lopetegui said. ""Especially a bad start, when they scored two goals and set the tone for the game. ""We have to pick ourselves up, we have another important game in three days so we congratulate Sevilla and recognise we have not played how we wanted."""

Today the league isn't lost but we might miss these three points at the end of the season."" Things began well enough. Lionel Messi darted one way and then the other, before passing left to Coutinho. His touch sent the ball spinning into the air but the Brazilian adjusted, cutting his right foot across the ball and sending a brilliant volley into the bottom corner. Messi hit the crossbar soon after with a curling effort and a second seemed a matter of when rather than if. Instead, Leganes found a foothold and Youssef En-Nesyri should have equalised, only to head straight at Marc-Andre ter Stegen. Then from the 52nd minute, they scored not one, but two. First, Barca were ripped open on the break as Thomas Vermaelen failed to stop El Zhar heading in at the back post. Barca kicked off, Coutinho conceded possession and one long ball forward caused chaos again. Pique attempted to clear the cross but, off balance, succeeded only in slicing it to Oscar, who slammed it into the net. Seven minutes later, Suarez was on and then Alba and Malcom too, but it took until the 80th minute for Barca to go close. It was to no avail as Leganes goalkeeper Pichu Cuella palmed away Coutinho's shot before jumping up to tip over the rebound from Rakitic."
417,24/09/2018,15:40,Spanish players union veto Liga game in Miami,"The Spanish players union (AFE) on Monday rejected plans by La Liga to stage a regular-season game in the United States, following a similar refusal by the Spanish football federation (RFEF).","An AFE statement said La Liga had not responded to questions about the planned game between Girona and Barcelona in Miami. It said that ""faced with a lack of information"" it opposed the game taking place. On Friday, the RFEF expressed its formal opposition to moving the game from Girona to the United States. FIFA President Gianni Infantino has also expressed doubts about the move. The sharp refusal by the AFE, which had already indicated concern over the health risks to players of such a trip, is a new blow for La Liga, which argues that the initiative will expand its international audience. Real Madrid President Florentino Perez said Sunday his club would refuse to play a Spanish League game in the United States. For their part, Barcelona and Girona have said they are in favour of the idea of playing in Miami on January 26."
418,23/09/2018,23:13,Pique rescues point for 10-man Barca against Girona,American fans will be licking their lips if this is what awaits Miami's Hard Rock Stadium in January after Barcelona and Girona played out an enthralling 2-2 draw at the Camp Nou on Sunday.,"There were four goals, one for Lionel Messi and two for Girona's Cristhian Stuani, not to mention a controversial red card shown to Barca defender Clement Lenglet. Gerard Pique salvaged a point for the hosts to complete his own blockbuster night, after clearing one shot off the line before making mistakes for each of Girona's goals. By the end, Barca had surrendered their perfect record in La Liga, as well as a two-point advantage over Real Madrid. They return to the top of the table, but only on goal difference. Girona move up to sixth. Hanging over this game was always the wider prospect of it not being returned, given La Liga's desire to move the reverse fixture at Girona's Estadi Montilivi on January 26 to the United States. Barely a day passes without another opinion added, with Real Madrid president Florentino Perez ruling out his own club participating on Sunday morning. ""Absolutely no,"" Perez said. For all the opposition, however, there was a noticeable lack of complaint at the Camp Nou, where there were chants for Catalan independence but precious little in opposition to a trip to Miami. A point may not be viewed as a bad return either for Barca, having played through the best part of an hour with 10 men, but the changes made by coach Ernesto Valverde failed to hit the mark. Lenglet came in for Samuel Umititi, presumably to bed in next to Pique, given Umtiti will be suspended for Barcelona's next Champions League game against Tottenham later this month. But Lenglet was sent off in the 35th minute with Barca one up, while Arthur and Arturo Vidal - also brought in - were taken off before the hour. Only Nelson Semedo survived until the end. Messi and Pique had made changes too, each shaving their beards, but it had contrasting effects based on the evidence of the first half. Within 19 minutes, Messi had put Barca ahead, a slick finish into the corner finishing off Vidal's pass for the Argentinian's eighth goal in six games this season. Pique, however, was at fault for the equaliser, a lethargic attempt at a clearance allowing Stuani to latch onto Aday Benitez's cross and poke the ball past Marc-Andre ter Stegen. Girona had been spurred on by Lenglet's red card, after VAR showed the French defender landed an elbow into the face of Pere Pons, and referee Jesus Gil deemed it deliberate. Ten minutes later, Stuani had struck. The red card rippled through the French contingent as Lenglet's dismissal meant Ousmane Dembele was replaced by Umtiti at half-time. It made little difference as Girona, and Stuani, scored another six minutes after the restart, with Pique again the one culpable. First, he was outrun by Portu and then he brought the striker down from behind for what was probably a penalty. But Portu jumped to his feet and while his shot was pushed away by Ter Stegen, Stuani was well-placed to bang the rebound into the roof of the net. Valverde replaced both Vidal and Arthur with Philippe Coutinho and Ivan Rakitic just before the hour, and Messi struck the crossbar with a free-kick soon after. He was involved in the last goal too as a brilliant exchange with the excellent Luis Suarez saw the latter's shot loop across the box. Pique leapt high to head in. Earlier, Ben Yedder had scored a hat-trick as Sevilla thrashed Levante 6-2 while Real Betis came from behind to draw 2-2 at home to Athletic Bilbao. Valencia and Villarreal drew 0-0."

""I have a contract and I have a possibility to extend it a year more,"" Valerde said. ""The contract is there but we know what can happen in a season and the season is long. You have to see how the team does. ""Everything seems good but we are still in the month of September and we have a lot ahead."" Coaches like Pep Guardiola and Luis Enrique have left Barca in recent years after citing the fatigue involved in managing at the Camp Nou. ""I don't know about exhaustion or anything like that,"" Valverde said. ""We are still in September, there is plenty of room to feel exhausted, it is only just beginning."" Barcelona won La Liga and the Copa del Rey last season in Valverde's first year at the club. After their shock Champions League exit to Roma in the quarter-finals, however, reports suggested his future was in doubt. Barca president Josep Maria Bartomeu has said the club will want to know Valverde's position by March. ""I do not remember the deadline but the ideal date to know the future would be about the month of March,"" Bartomeu told Spanish radio station Onda Cero last week. ""I would like him to continue because we are happy with his work. Just look back at the results and performances of last year.""

The RFEF has sent a letter to La Liga explaining its opposition is down to ""the lack of documentation"", including the agreement between La Liga and the US company which will host games in the country. The federation argued that it is not clear if the agreement has the approval of all the top-flight clubs, and that it might affect the fairness of La Liga because one team would effectively lose a home game. Earlier this month, Barca president Josep Maria Bartomeu and Girona president Delfi Geli both signed a request from La Liga to the RFEF for their match on January 26 to be held at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami. RFEF president Luis Rubiales has previously voiced opposition to the idea, while the Spanish players' association (AFE) has maintained that players will have the final say."
421,19/09/2018,13:15,Messi and Dembele shine but work still to do for Barcelona,"Lionel Messi had said it was time Barcelona won the Champions League again and he played like a man on a mission on Tuesday, scoring a hat-trick in a 4-0 demolition of PSV Eindhoven.","It was his eighth treble in the competition, taking him above the record of seven he shared with Cristiano Ronaldo to sit unmatched at the top of the list. Messi marked other milestones too. He has now scored in 14 different Champions League campaigns, with only Raul and Ryan Giggs ahead of him on 15 and 16 respectively. Three times, Messi has hit hat-tricks in his opening game. ""He makes the extraordinary look ordinary,"" said Barcelona's coach Ernesto Valverde. ""Messi is a man of his word,"" wrote Marca. ""He said he wanted this Champions and he led by example."" The first goal was impressive enough. Ousmane Dembele had earned a free-kick, the reward for a weaving run forward, a yard outside of the penalty area and slightly right. PSV's wall edged forward, desperate to close the gap, but Messi arced the ball over all of them, spinning it away from Jeroen Zoet's left hand and into the top corner. ""He has an incredible left foot,"" Ivan Rakitic said. ""A lot of the time when he takes free-kicks you may as well go directly to the place where you're going to celebrate them."" Marca described it as a ""Maradonian touch"". Eight free-kicks converted this year, another personal record broken. If the World Cup proved anything, however, it is that Messi cannot do it alone and Barcelona will need others to shine if they are to end their Champions League hiatus. After three straight quarterfinal exits, the last a humbling collapse against Roma, this was a clean slate, a chance, at least to start to put things right. Andres Iniesta has gone but he was not too much missed on this occasion at the Camp Nou, where Philippe Coutinho sparkled and could have had his own hat-trick had his shooting been more precise, while Dembele might have been man of the match before Messi stole the show. With a turbulent debut season, blighted by injury, behind him, Dembele looks like a player back on track. He won the free-kick for Messi but his goal was a peach too. Turning between two PSV midfielders, he drove into the space and curved the ball into the bottom corner from 25 yards. ""In a team there is room for everyone, good passers and also for those that can break through,"" said Valverde. ""That's where we need Dembele."" The 21-year-old has five goals, already one more than his total last term. ""He was dazzling,"" wrote AS. ""Those five goals in six games have buried the worst year of Dembele's life."" Messi, Dembele, Coutinho, and Luis Suarez too, caused havoc but four goals still flattered Barcelona. ""4-0 is too heavy,"" PSV's coach Mark van Bommel said afterwards, and he was right. They had three good chances to take the lead and Hirving Lozano might have equalised in the second half too, had Gerard Pique not made a scrambling last-ditch block. Too easily opened up on the counter-attack, Barca will be punished by better teams later in the tournament. For now, this was an important win, to expunge the memories of Rome, and for morale. ""We're still not 100 percent,"" Rakitic said. ""We keep working."""
422,19/09/2018,13:15,Messi and Dembele shine but work still to do for Barcelona,"Lionel Messi had said it was time Barcelona won the Champions League again and he played like a man on a mission on Tuesday, scoring a hat-trick in a 4-0 demolition of PSV Eindhoven.","It was his eighth treble in the competition, taking him above the record of seven he shared with Cristiano Ronaldo to sit unmatched at the top of the list. Messi marked other milestones too. He has now scored in 14 different Champions League campaigns, with only Raul and Ryan Giggs ahead of him on 15 and 16 respectively. Three times, Messi has hit hat-tricks in his opening game. ""He makes the extraordinary look ordinary,"" said Barcelona's coach Ernesto Valverde. ""Messi is a man of his word,"" wrote Marca. ""He said he wanted this Champions and he led by example."" The first goal was impressive enough. Ousmane Dembele had earned a free-kick, the reward for a weaving run forward, a yard outside of the penalty area and slightly right. PSV's wall edged forward, desperate to close the gap, but Messi arced the ball over all of them, spinning it away from Jeroen Zoet's left hand and into the top corner. ""He has an incredible left foot,"" Ivan Rakitic said. ""A lot of the time when he takes free-kicks you may as well go directly to the place where you're going to celebrate them."" Marca described it as a ""Maradonian touch"". Eight free-kicks converted this year, another personal record broken.

423,18/09/2018,22:24,Messi scores hat-trick as Barcelona thrash PSV,Lionel Messi pictures the Champions League ending with him hoisting the trophy and it began with him scoring a hat-trick on Tuesday as Barcelona put four goals past PSV Eindhoven.,"An early kick-off at Camp Nou meant that before most of the tournament's teams had even named their line-ups, Messi was up and running, his sumptuous free-kick from the edge of the area nestling in the top corner, exactly where it was intended. Messi would have his second and third before the end, and a record eighth Champions League treble, but the game was up by then thanks to a superb strike from the excellent Ousmane Dembele. Only when Barca were three ahead was Samuel Umtiti sent off for a second yellow card, meaning he will miss the trip to Wembley to face Tottenham next month. Even with 10 men, Messi completed his set for a 4-0 win. Dembele's goal was worthy of deciding any match but this was Messi's night. After a miserable World Cup trying to retrieve the irretrievable Argentina, Barcelona's now-captain proved his quality again to any doubters that are left. Four goals already in La Liga, seven overall, neither age nor Cristiano Ronaldo's exit from Spain appear to have taken the edge off. ""Normally if you score a hat-trick you frame it,"" said Barca coach Ernesto Valverde. ""But he makes the extraordinary routine."" Even if Messi remains as good as ever, his team will need others to step up. Philippe Coutinho was impressive here and, after a difficult debut campaign, Dembele is finding his rhythm, and his place. ""Just as there is room for players that pass, there must be others that can make things happen,"" Valverde said. The 21-year-old's driving run earned Messi his free-kick while a sizzling shot brought the goal his bustling display deserved. Perhaps more importantly, this victory was a clean slate for Barcelona. It was exactly 23 weeks ago that Roma pulled off one of the greatest comebacks ever seen in this competition and sent the club into a depth of disappointment that, in truth, not even winning the double could alleviate. Instead, Madrid rubbed salt into the wound by making it look easy and winning their third in a row. ""It is a thorn in our side,"" Luis Suarez said. ""It's time to win the Champions League,"" said Messi. PSV's coach Mark van Bommel knows what it feels like to walk out at the Camp Nou - he had a successful, albeit short, spell playing for Barca - but few of his players did. Nick Viergever was one of them, for Ajax in 2014, but it was his rash challenge on Dembele in the 31st minute that conceded the free-kick a yard outside the penalty area. Messi sized it up and sent it spinning away from the hand of Jeroen Zoet and into the top corner. It was his eighth free-kick scored in 2018. He has never scored more in a year. The contest bristled at the start of the second half. Suarez's delightful chip beat Zoet but not the crossbar. PSV were still in it and could have equalised when Hirving Lozano's finish was blocked, crucially, by Gerard Pique. Then three goals arrived in 15 minutes. First Dembele, after leaving two PSV midfielders for dead with a dragback, unleashed into the bottom corner. Van Bommel's destructive instincts kicked in. ""We should have stopped him,"" he said. Messi then latched onto a lob from Ivan Rakitic to slot home before Umtiti was sent off for a cynical block on Lozano. It made no difference. Suarez set up Messi's third, a brilliant flick allowing his captain the last word, after he had also had the first."
424,18/09/2018,12:08,FIFA president Infantino has doubts about La Liga match in Miami,FIFA president Gianni Infantino has expressed concern about La Liga's proposal to stage a fixture between Girona and Barcelona in the United States.,"The two clubs have each approved a request submitted to the Spanish Football Federation for the match to be played at the Hard Rock Stadium in Miami on January 26. It was originally scheduled as a home game for Girona, at their Estadi Montilivi. The idea has proven controversial. Girona would be surrendering the advantages of playing at their own home ground, which in theory could benefit Barcelona. Infantino said on Tuesday: ""I think I would prefer to see a great MLS game in the US rather than La Liga being in the US. In football, the general principle is that you play a 'home' match at 'home', and not in a foreign country."" La Liga president Javier Tebas responded on Twitter. He wrote: ""I will remind the president of FIFA that in the MLS, three teams of Canada participate, and Toronto is the current champion, and also in Canada there is another professional league."" Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver all compete in the MLS but play home fixtures in their own cities, in Canada. Infantino also confirmed the plan will need approval from the Spanish and US Football Federations, as well as UEFA and CONCACAF, the governing bodies in charge of European and North American football respectively. He added: ""FIFA should also express a view on the matter, not least since it would have implications for football at a global level as well."" La Liga is discussing playing one game per season in the US as part of a 15-year agreement with the media company Relevent. Girona supporters have been offered a ""compensation package"", which is believed to include free flights to the US, as well as 5,000 tickets for the reverse fixture at the Camp Nou later this month. The offer to play the game abroad has been accepted by Girona, who have described it as ""a great opportunity to expand and grow, not only for the club but also for our city and our territory"". Barcelona coach Ernesto Valverde said on Friday: ""Everything is still far away. It has been discussed with the players and there is an intention (for the match to be moved)."" Real Madrid coach Julen Lopetegui believes moving the game would undermine the equality of the league. ""I'm not in favour of it,"" Lopetegui said on Friday. ""I think we should all play in the same conditions, on the same pitches - that's what makes the league equal."" La Liga has said the match is part of a long-term project, ""targeted at promoting football in the United States and Canada""."
425,16/09/2018,23:53,Barca desperate to make amends in Europe with memories of Rome still fresh,"Almost exactly an hour after the final whistle, Barcelona posted a tweet: ""Congratulations to @realmadrid for winning the 2017/18 Champions League title.""","Underneath some fans demanded the message be deleted immediately while others claimed it as a classy touch. ""We are rivals, not enemies"", one wrote. Meanwhile, Barcelona's key players - Lionel Messi, Gerard Pique, Luis Suarez, Andres Iniesta - stayed quiet. Some had recently posted pictures of themselves surrounded by their families, with the World Cup just around the corner. But from the words that have been spoken since, and despite the club's stately message, it is clear Madrid's triumph hit home. Barcelona had failed and this made it even harder to bear. ""Obviously it's infuriating (for us),"" Suarez said in an interview with RAC1 earlier this month. ""Madrid have won the Champions League in each of the last three years. They have made history and it's a thorn in our side."" Chiefly, perhaps, because Barca will feel they were better than Madrid last season. They blew them away in a 3-0 flurry at the Santiago Bernabeu and then played with 10 men for the second half at the Camp Nou and still drew 2-2. They even led with a man fewer until Gareth Bale's late equaliser. They also finished an enormous 17 points clear of them to win La Liga, a gap that admittedly swelled when Zinedine Zidane began prioritising games in Europe, but even by February, before the Champions League knock-outs kicked into gear, Barcelona were 16 ahead. A pattern has emerged in recent years that both clubs are keen to break. Barcelona dominate domestically, while Real Madrid reign in Europe. Barca have won seven out of the last 10 league titles, Madrid only two. Real have claimed four of the last five Champions League crowns, Barcelona the other one. But while Madrid's victory over Liverpool was a final blow, it was the defeat to Roma, and the manner of it, that was the moment of realisation. Throwing away a 4-1 lead by losing 3-0 in Italy was not perceived as just careless, it was unforgivable. ""Without personality, without Messi and without any fight, Barca were shipwrecked at the Olimpico against an immensely superior team that lowered the Barca players from their artificial pedestal,"" read Madrid's daily newspaper AS the following morning. ""We have to endure the pain,"" said coach Ernesto Valverde. ""There will be some tough days."" His team were stinging for the rest of the season, even as they completed the double by thrashing Sevilla to win the Copa del Rey. Before the match, reports had surfaced that Valverde could be sacked regardless of the result. After, the players were asked if victory made up for their Champions League exit. The prevailing answer was no. ""It is an important trophy,"" Suarez said. ""But this does not hide what happened in Rome."" Motivation is one thing but shifting weight onto the Champions League will demand practical adjustments too. Valverde was accused last season of over-exerting his players in the league, particularly when it was clear it was won. Three days before the capitulation to Roma, the likes of Messi and Suarez were playing 90 minutes to beat 14th-placed Leganes. Valverde has indicated he will adapt. Ahead of their Group B opener at home to PSV on Tuesday, Sergio Busquets and Philippe Coutinho started as substitutes in Saturday's win over Real Sociedad, even if both were needed before the end. Messi, who turned 31 in June, may also need to be preserved if he is to add a fifth Champions League success to his collection. Now captain, he appears hungrier than ever. ""It's time to win the Champions League,"" Messi told Catalunya Radio earlier this month. ""We've been knocked out in the quarter-finals three seasons in a row and maybe the last one was the worst of all because of the result and how the match was played. ""I think we have to aim for that, as a club, as a team and as a collective. We have a spectacular squad and we can do it."""
426,15/09/2018,18:41,Barcelona fight back to beat Real Sociedad,Barcelona came from behind to beat Real Sociedad on Saturday as Atletico Madrid lost further ground in the La Liga title race by drawing at home to Eibar.,"Seven points is now the gap between Atleti and Barca, who were in danger of slipping up themselves when Aritz Elustondo put Real Sociedad in front at Anoeta. But the hosts missed a series of excellent chances and paid the price, as two goals in three minutes from Luis Suarez and Ousmane Dembele clinched a hard-fought 2-1 win. ""The league is defined by these kind of games,"" Suarez said afterwards. ""Last year we also came back from 2-0 after many years without winning here. The reaction says a lot about this team."" Atletico rallied too, Borja Garces equalising with virtually the last kick of the game, but there were no celebrations at the Wanda Metropolitano. Garces' strike was enough only to rescue a 1-1 draw for Diego Simeone's side, who had looked on course for defeat when Eibar's Sergi Enrich bundled home in the 87th minute. Barcelona might easily have dropped points too had their opponents been more clinical. Mikel Oyarzabal and Theo Hernandez both could have made it 2-0 after half-time but the former blazed over and the latter was denied by Barca keeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen. Within minutes, they were behind, as two crosses caused havoc in Real Sociedad´s defence, with Suarez and Dembele perfectly placed to pounce. Barca coach Ernesto Valverde had made the surprise decision to omit Sergio Busquets from his starting line-up, presumably with Tuesday´s Champions League opener against PSV Eindhoven in mind. But it was testament to the hosts' performance that Busquets was called upon in the second period after Philippe Coutinho had also been introduced at half-time. ""In the first half they closed us down well but Philippe coming on in the second half helped changed the dynamics,"" Suarez said. Simeone might also have liked to keep one eye on their Champions League game against Monaco on Tuesday, but a victory was much-needed following defeat to Celta Vigo two weeks ago. Antoine Griezmann and Diego Costa, however, were both sloppy in the final third and Eibar might even have scored earlier, twice denied by the woodwork. It means Atleti have now recorded their worst league start since 2009. ""I would worry if we had not created those chances to score,"" Simeone said. ""The team also showed a reaction after their goal. We continued to push forward and managed to take a point."""
427,11/09/2018,20:32,Barcelona and Girona support La Liga request for match in Miami,Barcelona and Girona have both signed a request for their La Liga fixture in January to be played in Miami.,"The formal request was submitted by La Liga to the Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) on Monday, with the support of both Barca president Josep Maria Bartomeu and Girona president Delfi Geli. The proposal asks permission that the game, originally scheduled as a home match for Girona at their Estadi Montilivi, be played at Hard Rock Stadium on January 26. A La Liga statement on Tuesday also said a ""compensation package"" on offer has been ""welcomed"" by 'Aficiones Unidas', an association of club fan groups in Spain. The package is believed to include free flights for up to 1,500 Girona fans, as well as 5,000 tickets for the reverse fixture at the Camp Nou later this month. As well as the RFEF, La Liga is likely to seek permission from the Spanish sports council and US Soccer Federation, as well as UEFA and CONCACAF, the governing bodies in charge of European and North American football respectively. La Liga is discussing playing one game per season in the United States as part of a 15-year agreement struck with the media company Relevent. The idea has proven controversial, with RFEF president Luis Rubiales voicing opposition while the Spanish players' association (AFE) has maintained that players will have the final say. After a meeting with La Liga in Madrid on Monday, AFE said it had ""conveyed the discomfort of the players due to a lack of information about the agreement to play a league match in the United States"". The offer was accepted by Girona, who said in a statement last week: ""It is a great opportunity to expand and grow, not only for the club but also for our city and our territory."" La Liga added on Tuesday that the match is part of a long-term projected, ""targeted at promoting football in the United States and Canada""."
428,10/09/2018,19:13,Liga match in America - players to decide,"Players will have the final say on whether a La Liga fixture between Girona and Barcelona will be staged in the United States, the Spanish players´ association (AFE) said on Monday.","Moving the match to the US was formally proposed by La Liga during a meeting in Madrid with AFE, the body that represents footballers in Spain. AFE released a statement, which said: ""The players, through AFE, will be the ones who make a final decision on the match to be played in the United States."" It also confirmed that La Liga had proposed ""Girona v Barcelona as the match which is played in the United States in the month of January 2019"". The fixture is scheduled for January 27 and was originally listed as a home game for Girona, at their Estadi Montilivi. La Liga, however, is discussing playing one game per season in the US as part of a 15-year agreement struck with the media company Relevent. After consulting with players in August, AFE president David Aganzo had said they were ""outraged"" and ""unanimous"" in their opposition to the idea. He also refused to rule out the possibility of strike action. AFE said on Monday it had ""conveyed the discomfort of the players due to a lack of information about the agreement to play a league match in the United States."" La Liga has agreed to provide a ""descriptive report"" on the project, which AFE will pass on to the players. Javier Tebas, La Liga´s president, told Spanish radio station Onda Cero on Friday that ""Girona against Barcelona will 90 per cent be played in the United States"". Tebas also said only clubs that volunteer to play abroad will do so and that ticket holders would be offered free flights to attend. The offer has been accepted by Girona, who said in a statement last week: ""It is a great opportunity to expand and grow, not only for the club but also for our city and our territory."" Barcelona vice-captain Sergio Busquets, however, was among those attending the meeting in August with AFE, when players voiced their opposition to the idea. The Spanish Football Federation is also against the proposal."
429,05/09/2018,13:05,Pogba always welcome at Barca - Suarez,Luis Suarez believes Paul Pogba should be challenging for more trophies than he is at Manchester United and would always be welcome at Barcelona.,"Pogba has endured a turbulent two years since returning to Old Trafford for a then world-record fee of 105 million euros ($121.7) and his relationship with coach Jose Mourinho has become strained. The 25-year-old rediscovered his best form away from his club, for France in the summer, when he inspired Les Bleus to World Cup glory in Russia, beating Uruguay and Suarez on the way. But since Alex Ferguson retired in 2013, United have failed to go close in either the Premier League or Champions League, while Barca have won three La Ligas in that time and the Champions League once. ""Pogba is an elite player who has won everything and we always want to have the best,"" Suarez told RAC1 on Tuesday. ""He is a player that has a lot of quality and who is one of the key players at United, and I think he would like to compete for more than he is competing for now. ""But that's how it is, he does not belong to Barcelona but he will always be welcome."" One Champions League crown in five years, however, represents a disappointing return for Barca, particularly while rivals Real Madrid have dominated the tournament, winning it three times in a row. Lionel Messi, now captain after Andres Iniesta´s departure, has expressed his own desire to make amends, with the striker also coming off the back of a harrowing World Cup with Argentina. ""He's really motivated, even more so after the World Cup and the Champions League,"" Suarez said. ""But it's a really difficult competition to win and Messi can't win it on his own. It has to be a team effort, as good as he is. ""Obviously it's infuriating for us because Madrid have won the Champions League in each of the last three years. They have made history and it's a thorn in our side."" One criticism levelled at coach Ernesto Valverde last season was that he overworked his players in La Liga, despite Barca enjoying a significant advantage at the top. Suarez shoulders the blame too, pinpointing a league victory against Leganes when he played 90 minutes, three days before they were beaten in Europe by Roma. ""When you pass 30 you begin to realise there are times when you have to rest,"" Suarez said. ""I regret a lot the game against Leganes at home when we had a big lead in La Liga and the quarter-final with Roma three days later. I played the whole game and you get a bit tired. ""You have to manage things to be at your best in the big games. I think the coach is seeing those little details."" Suarez turned 31 in January and scored 25 league goals last term. He would like to finish his career at the Camp Nou but admits it will be difficult. ""It's complicated,"" Suarez said. ""Look at players like Xavi and Andres (Iniesta), they are players who have been ingrained in the club but they have not been able to finish here. ""I am aware the day I do not have the level to play for Barca I would have to leave but the desire of every player is to end here."""
430,12/08/2018,10:43,Sevilla threaten to pull out of Super Cup against Barcelona,Sevilla have threatened to pull out of Sunday's Spanish Super Cup clash with Barcelona if the La Liga champions field more than three non-EU players.,"The Spanish football federation (RFEF) said on Saturday that there would be no restrictions on players from outside the EU for the Super Cup, despite only three being allowed in squads for league matches. Sevilla said they could withdraw from the game in Tangier, Morocco, if Barca name an ""improper lineup"". ""Sevilla FC is surprised by the RFEF's announcement 24 hours before the Super Cup,"" Sevilla said in a statement. ""It has said that as many non-EU players as desired can be registered. In their last statement for the 2018-2019 season, only three were due to be allowed, without exception. ""The club's legal department is studying the matter and should FC Barcelona line up with more than three non-EU players, it would present possible ground for withdrawal due to an improper line-up."" New signings Malcom, Arturo Vidal and Arthur will likely be Barca's three non-EU players on Sunday, although Brazilian centre-back Marlon has also travelled with the squad. Philippe Coutinho has reportedly acquired a Portuguese passport through his wife in the last week, while his fellow South Americans Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez are already EU citizens. Sevilla qualified for the match as last season's Copa del Rey runners-up, after Barcelona won the league and cup double."
431,09/08/2018,19:30,"Everton complete triple deal for Mina, Andre Gomes and Bernard",Everton completed the signings of Yerry Mina and Andre Gomes from Barcelona and Brazilian free-agent winger Bernard on Thursday in a triple deadline-day swoop for the Premier League club.,"Mina, a 23-year-old central defender who scored three goals in three games for Colombia at the World Cup, will move to Goodison Park in a 30.25 million euro (£27 million, $35 million) deal with the Catalan giants, plus 1.5 million more in add ons, Barcelona confirmed. One of Mina's goals in Russia was against Everton's England goalkeeper Jordan Pickford to send a dramatic last 16 tie into extra-time. However, Mina failed to impress in just six appearances for Barca since signing from Palmeiras in January. And Barca were keen to cash in on the 23-year-old, who cost just 11.8 million euros seven months ago. Likewise, Portuguese international Gomes has failed to establish himself as a first team regular since joining from Valencia for an initial 35 million euro fee in 2016. His season-long loan will cost the English club 2.25 million euros, Barca said in a statement. Bernard, a 25-year-old capped 14 times by Brazil, was a free agent after his contract with Shakhtar Donetsk expired and said Portuguese manager Marco Silva played a big role in attracting him to the club. ""I chose Everton because of all the things I had heard about Marco Silva and after speaking to him I was happy with what he said to me,"" Bernard told Evertontv. ""The manager made me feel confident about playing here. He is a very good coach and he has achieved really good things at other clubs."
432,08/08/2018,10:53,Pogba keen to leave United for Barcelona - reports,"France World Cup star Paul Pogba is determined to end his fractious relationship with Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho and move to Barcelona, according to British media reports on Wednesday.","The 25-year-old -- who scored in the 4-2 World Cup final win over Croatia -- has agreed terms with Barcelona for a deal worth £89.5 million ($115 million, 100 million euros) over five years, according to the Daily Mail. The reported agreement would see him pick up £346,000 a week, almost double what he earns at United. The Sun claims the former Juventus star -- who joined United for a then world-record fee of £89 million in 2016 -- has demanded the Premier League side increase his wages from £180,000 to £380,000 a week so he is paid almost on a par with Chilean star Alexis Sanchez, otherwise he will leave. United, though, would be most reluctant to sell him, with the Daily Mail reporting they have already rejected a bid by Barcelona of £44.5 million plus Colombian central defender Yerry Mina and Portuguese midfielder Andre Gomes. Mourinho has expressed his frustration over the club's transfer policy, and Pogba's departure would leave little time for executive chairman Ed Woodward to find a suitable replacement with the Premier League transfer window due to close on Thursday. The club has had to deny the claim that Pogba sent a text message to Woodward demanding he be allowed to leave. The Frenchman is keen to move to Barcelona -- the Spanish transfer window does not shut till the end of the month -- to play with Argentina superstar Lionel Messi, while his close friend and former Juventus team-mate Arturo Vidal also recently moved to the Catalan giants. Essentially, though, Pogba's unhappiness stems from the deterioration in his relationship with Mourinho, who not only does he blame for his muted performances for United since his move but also for his qualified praise of his performances for France at the World Cup. ""Paul was like the (France) team. He started average and ended top,"" Mourinho told beIN Sports on United's unhappy tour of the United States last week. Pogba, though, is believed to have been more upset by what followed in the interview as Mourinho implied being in an enclosed environment over six weeks ensured he focused just on football and not on outside matters such as commercial contracts. Pogba's super agent Mino Raiola -- who was also instrumental in bringing Romelu Lukaku to United last summer -- has remained out of the fray, refusing to comment on links with Barcelona. ""I will never make declarations about Paul,"" said the Dutch-Italian agent, who is reported to have earned just over £40 million when Pogba moved to United. ""You have to speak to Manchester United,"" added Raiola. Former United star Rio Ferdinand told Wednesday's edition of the Daily Mail that Mourinho needed to fit the team around Pogba's sublime talent, but accepted the player needed to adapt too. ""It's down to the manager to get the best out of him, setting the team up and setting Pogba up in the right way to achieve the best,"" said the former England central defender. ""But Pogba needs to play his part in that. ""It's a case of the player and manager getting an understanding for each other and getting the best out of the player."""
433,18/05/2018,00:15,Stars set to say farewell on La Liga's final weekend,La Liga's winners and losers are settled and the European qualification spots decided but for a collection of star players the final weekend of the season will be anything but a dead rubber.,"Here, we look at five talking points ahead of the last weekend in La Liga: Zinedine Zidane would appear to have it clear in his mind what does and does not work in Europe. Through Real Madrid's journey to the final, he has put great faith in the likes of Lucas Vazquez and Marco Asensio while Gareth Bale, Isco and even Karim Benzema have found their places less secure. Benzema and Isco, however, have proven their coach's stance can be turned and now Bale must try to follow suit. His man-of-the-match performance against Celta Vigo last weekend would surely have made an impact on Zidane and another similar display against Villarreal on Saturday might sneak him a starting spot in the final. Cristiano Ronaldo has shaken off an ankle sprain but the decision is whether to risk the Portugese's fitness this weekend or, by leaving him out, his sharpness against Liverpool. After 674 matches and 22 years associated with the club, Andres Iniesta will bid farewell to Barcelona, who host Real Sociedad on Sunday. A grand closing ceremony is planned, with the Camp Nou crowd set to form the message 'Infinito Iniesta' on both sides and Iniesta's number eight at either end. After the match, the 34-year-old will lift the La Liga trophy and it is likely Barca coach Ernesto Valverde will substitute his midfielder to allow the club's fans one final standing ovation. Torres' departure will be no easier to stomach for Atletico, whom the forward has supported since he was five years old. An 128th goal for the club against Eibar on Sunday would bring the house down. Atleti won the Europa League at a canter on Wednesday, thanks to a 3-0 win over Marseille, but silverware may not be enough to convince their two star players to stay. Antoine Griezmann, who scored twice in Lyon, looks particularly likely to move, with Barcelona expected to activate the striker's 100 million-euro buyout clause before the start of the World Cup. Jan Oblak has proven himself among, if not at the top of, the world's elite group of goalkeepers and Diego Simeone may face a fight to hold onto the Slovenian too. It is impossible to know whether had Barcelona been able to throw Messi on for the final 19 minutes against Levante last weekend, their unbeaten season would still be intact. Luis Suarez made it 5-4 in the 71st minute but Messi was not in the squad and Barca could not find an equaliser. Messi did play 16 minutes of Wednesday's friendly against Mamelodi Sundowns, a match commemorating 100 years since the birth of Nelson Mandela. Even with the World Cup approaching for the Argentinian, Barca's unbeaten season mattered. It was their chance to add some gloss to a campaign still soured by their Champions League exit to Roma. Without Messi, that chance was lost. Levante could be forgiven for not wanting the season to end. Paco Lopez took charge in March with the team in danger of relegation and has now overseen eight wins in 10 matches. If they follow up their stunning victory over Barca by beating Celta Vigo on Saturday, and other results go their way, Levante could still finish 11th. This summer promises to be a busy one but with Lopez committing himself to the club next season, better times should lie ahead. For Sevilla, a late surge under temporary boss Joaquin Caparros has secured Europa League qualification ahead of Saturday's game against Alaves but off the pitch, much is still to be decided including the positions of coach and sporting director.

434,15/05/2018,14:32,"Post Barca, Iniesta to decide between China or Japan","Barcelona captain Andres Iniesta says he will decide ""next week"" whether to continue his decorated career in either China or Japan.","The 34-year-old Barca icon is bringing the curtain down on his two-decade stay with the Spanish champions, with his last game for the club he joined at the age of 12 coming on Sunday. ""There are two scenarios, China or Japan, and each has its advantages,"" he told Spanish radio Onda Cero overnight Monday. ""There are some minor details to be sorted out, we're weighing everything up and will pick which one we decide is the best option."" The Spanish midfielder added: ""Next week, when everything is over, we'll decide. Then, there's the World Cup, I want to get this resolved so that I can focus. ""One option is more advanced than the other..."" Last week both China's Chongqing Lifan and Japan's Vissel Kobe, owned by Barca sponsors Rakuten, denied making big money moves for the Spanish star. Iniesta's comments appear to rule out a move to Australia's A-League which had been suggested as his preferred destination by Spain's Sport website. Iniesta, a wine producer, has acknowledged that the economic aspect of the deal he eventually choses is ""relatively important"". He is keen to expand his wine label from his native region of Castilla-La-Mancha into new markets. But he stressed that the over-riding factor was quality of life the new position would offer his wife and three children. Iniesta announced in April his intention to leave Barcelona at the end of the season - Sunday's finale at the Camp Nou against Real Sociedad promises to be an emotionally-charged affair."
435,13/05/2018,23:36,Barcelona's unbeaten season ended by five-star Levante,Philippe Coutinho hit a hat-trick but could not save Barcelona's unbeaten season as the Catalans were left stunned by an extraordinary 5-4 defeat to Levante on Sunday.,"Ernesto Valverde rested Lionel Messi for his team's penultimate match of the campaign but it was a defensive horror-show that allowed Emmanuel Boateng to score three times and Enis Bardhi twice at the City of Valencia Stadium. The La Liga and Copa del Rey champions trailed 5-1 after an hour and still came within a whisker of a sensational comeback as Coutinho's second and third goals, and a Luis Suarez penalty, set up a grandstand finish. But Levante held on for a thrilling victory, which ends their opponents' hopes of becoming the first ever club to finish a 38-game La Liga season as invincibles. After drawing at home to Real Madrid last weekend, despite playing the second half with 10 men, and thrashing Villarreal, Barcelona sat just two games away from the historical feat. It was 1932 when the last side, Real Madrid, went unbeaten in the top-flight but even that was across only 18 matches, in a 10-team division. This was Barcelona's first league loss since slipping up against Malaga on April 8 last year and while it has minimal impact on the table, Valverde will have questions to answer, not least with regards to leaving out Messi. ""We are angry not to have come through this game and not to have the opportunity to finish unbeaten,"" Valverde said. ""But in a season some matches go your way and some don't. I think this result was harsh in all respects but at other times this season, like in Seville, we could also have lost."" This defensive collapse was reminiscent of their Champions League meltdown against Roma, which has soured an otherwise successful campaign. The unbeaten record was supposed to help atone for the European failure. ""Obviously we wanted to finish the league undefeated,"" Sergio Busquets told beIN Sport. ""But this does not take away everything we have done otherwise this season - everything we have achieved in league, the run we managed across two seasons - but, it is a shame."" For Levante, this is their eighth win in 10 matches under new coach Paco Lopez, who took charge with the club in danger of relegation but has overseen a remarkable transformation. They move up to 15th. Paco's players exploded out of the blocks and pulled ahead in the ninth minute when Boateng nipped in at the near post after Jose Luis Morales' weaving run down the left. Bardhi hit the woodwork with a lifted finish over Marc-Andre ter Stegen but Barca failed to heed the warnings and Boateng made it two after half an hour, latching on to Sasa Lukic's threaded ball through. Coutinho pulled one back with a rasping shot before half-time but three Levante goals in 10 minutes after the interval sent the home fans into delirium. Bardhi's blistering shot restored the two-goal advantage before Boateng completed his hat-trick as Barca's defence was ripped apart again on the break. Another counter just before the hour ended with another crisp Bardhi finish, as Barca were now staring at a four-goal deficit. The game looked dead but Coutinho scored twice in six minutes, the first a close-range finish after Ousmane Dembele's shot spilled loose, the second an instinctive shot from the edge of the area. When Boateng brought down Busquets in the area and Suarez drove the penalty down the middle with 20 minutes left, it felt inevitable Barca would find a fifth. But without Messi even to bring on, Levante withstood the late onslaught and should even have scored a sixth only for Ruben Rochina to prode wide after a dreadful backpass by Busquets. It was the final mistake of an error-strewn display."

Messi is in line to win the ""pichichi"" for top scorer this season having already grabbed 34 goals, nine clear of Cristiano Ronaldo in second."
437,11/05/2018,01:36,Barca visit in-form Levante with unbeaten season on the line,Barcelona may have navigated their way past Real Madrid and Villarreal this week but their first ever unbeaten La Liga season is not quite over the line yet.,"Ernesto Valverde's side visit Levante on Sunday, whose lowly position of 16th betrays a late surge in form, which has included four consecutive victories and only one defeat in their last 10 games. Barca are clear favourites. They held on for a 2-2 draw at home to Real on Sunday, even after Sergi Roberto was sent off at the end of the first half, before thrashing sixth-placed Villarreal 5-1 on Wednesday. But if those two games have caused any fatigue, or even complacency, among Spain's league and cup winners, Levante could be primed to take advantage. When Paco Lopez replaced Juan Ramon Lopez Muniz as coach at the start of March, Levante had won only one of their last 22 games. Since he took charge, only Atletico Madrid have played them and tasted victory. ""It was important to change the dynamics but I don't know what changed so much,"" Lopez said. ""What we have is attitude and commitment and that has been the key."" Valverde has downplayed the importance of his team finishing the campaign as invincibles but after already winning a domestic double, it would represent something of a cherry on top. No team has ever finished a 38-game La Liga season without losing and Barca would be the first in any format since Real Madrid managed it across an 18-match schedule in 1932. With Real standing on the brink of a third consecutive Champions League triumph, their Catalan rivals need to claim every accolade they can get. ""In this club you are expected to win everything,"" Valverde said. ""We have not won everything but it is also true we had difficulties at the start of the season and we have exceeded many expectations. ""We had a terrible day in Rome in the Champions League and that has hung over us. But still, it has been a great season."" Zinedine Zidane has paid lip-service to the idea of a strong finish in the league, not least to maintain momentum ahead of their season-defining Champions League final against Liverpool in Kiev. But a heavily-rotated Real side's 3-2 defeat to Sevilla on Wednesday, when they trailed 3-0 in the 86th minute, offered a more accurate indication of the Frenchman's priorities. Real host Celta Vigo on Saturday, when it is almost certain that Cristiano Ronaldo, still recovering from a sprained ankle, will be absent. If Zidane recalls other key players it will be to prevent rust rather than to preserve hopes of beating Atletico Madrid to second. Vigo's own ambitions of sealing a place in the Europa League have extinguished but there remains a three-way battle for two spots between Villarreal, Sevilla and Getafe. Real Betis, in fifth, cannot drop out although they could still sink to seventh, which would involve playing an awkward qualification play-off in July. They host the current incumbents Sevilla on Saturday. Getafe, meanwhile, entertain Atletico while Villarreal visit already-relegated Deportivo La Coruna. Getafe may enjoy the benefits of an under-strength Atletico team, who play Marseille in the Europa League final on Wednesday. ""I have tunnel vision, like a horse,"" Atletico coach Diego Simeone said. ""I have Getafe and the final. I don't hear or see anything else."""

In a statement on Wednesday, the federation's Competition Committee said Sergi had violated Article 98 of the disciplinary code, in which an aggression is considered ""malicious"". The Committee has imposed a more minor punishment for such cases, which can incur bans of up to twelve matches. Sergi was sent off on Sunday at the end of the first half against Real Madrid, in a match that ended 2-2."
439,09/05/2018,22:17,Dembele double edges Barca closer to unbeaten season,Ousmane Dembele scored twice as Barcelona thrashed Villarreal 5-1 on Wednesday and edged closer to their first ever unbeaten season in La Liga.,"Lionel Messi volleyed in a sumptuous pass from Andres Iniesta at Camp Nou to put Barca three up at half-time after Philippe Coutinho and Paulinho had scored one apiece in the first 16 minutes. The second period, however, belonged to Dembele, who capped an excellent individual display with two goals after the Frenchman's sensational run had also earlier set up Coutinho. Villarreal managed a consolation when Pablo Fornals' shot deflected in off Nicola Sansone but any fears Ernesto Valverde's side would feel the effects of Sunday's 'Clasico' proved unfounded. The league leaders moved 15 points clear of Atletico Madrid at the top while Villarreal stay sixth. Barca drew last weekend against Real Madrid, despite playing the entire second half with 10 men, and they now need only avoid defeat in matches away at Levante and home to Real Sociedad to complete the campaign as invincibles. It would be the first time a team has finished a 38-game La Liga season unbeaten and the first in any format since Real avoided defeat in a division of only 10 teams in 1932. Already crowned champions and winners of the Copa del Rey, Barca were controversially denied a guard of honour by Real but Villarreal were happy to perform the 'pasillo' as the hosts walked out before kick-off. Valverde left some key players out, with Marc-Andre ter Stegen, Luis Suarez, Jordi Alba and Ivan Rakitic all missing from the starting line-up. Messi, however, was included despite calls for the Argentinian now to be rested ahead of this summer's World Cup. It meant a start for Dembele, who took his chance to impress with the stand-out performance of the night. Dembele has endured a difficult debut season since joining for 147 million euros from Borussia Dortmund last year but Barcelona president Josep Maria Bartomeu has said this week he is not for sale, and the 20-year-old delivered the perfect response. His run that set up Coutinho's opener in the 11th minute was arguably the moment of the match as he picked up the ball 10 yards inside Villarreal's half before driving past three defenders and unleashing a shot. Villarreal goalkeeper Sergio Asenjo palmed the ball away but only to Coutinho, who was left with a tap-in. Paulinho doubled Barca's lead five minutes later after a brilliant Iniesta pass allowed Lucas Digne to slide the ball across goal. Paulinho finished at the back post. Iniesta was at the heart of the home side's third too, this time a chipped ball playing in the darting Messi, who side-footed home on the volley. Villarreal pulled one back after half-time when Fornals' shot clipped the shoulder of Sansone to wrong-foot Jasper Cillessen. But Dembele grabbed a late brace, his first an easy finish after a brilliant run by Rakitic down the right, his second coming after he sped away from Villarreal's defence, and lifted the ball over the helpess Asenjo."

The Atletico CEO said the club's stance was very clear. ""Not once have we negotiated for Griezmann nor do we have any intention to do so,"" he said in a statement issued on the team's official website. ""A few months ago, I personally expressed to Barcelona's president that our player isn't for sale nor are we going to sell him,"" he continued. ""At the same time, I let him know that his inappropriate conduct was against the integrity of the competition..."" The uncertainty over Griezmann's future could not have come at a worse time for Atletico as they prepare for next week's Europa League final against Marseille. Marin added: ""We're fed up with Barcelona's attitude. ""That a president, player and a board member speak the way they've done about the future of a player with an existing contract and just a few days before disputing a European final, is an absolute lack of respect towards Atletico."" He said Atletico would be demanding compensation from Barcelnoa should ""the player exercised his right to nullify his contract due to their pressure throughout the season"". He finished off by declaring ""enough is enough. I hope this statement serves its purpose and that us Atletico fans can enjoy this moment and prepare ourselves for a final like we should."" Marin's plea followed a report by Cadena Cope radio station that ""Barcelona have told Atletico Madrid they are going to pay Antonie Griezmann's get out clause. And Atletico know the player will be leaving at the end of the season"". That came after Atletico president Enrique Cerezo refused to clarify Griezmann's future after domestic media suggested Cerezo had met the player for dinner in a bid to persuade the Frenchman to stay at Atletico, with the promise of a bumper new contract. Cerezo has denied meeting Griezmann for talks but the Atletico president was also not definitive on the 27-year-old's future.

Chongqing said Iniesta wouldn't be joining ""as a player"" but left the door open to future cooperation with the midfielder, who has promotional and marketing links with the city. Chongqing added that they wanted to support the ""healthy development of Chinese football"" -- a reference to China's clampdown on heavy transfer spending and focus on homegrown talent. ""Our club will never violate the development prospects of Chinese football and we are determined to make due contributions to the healthy development of Chinese football,"" a statement said. It added: ""The other sports industry sections of our club's controlling shareholder have in-depth cooperation with Mr. Iniesta in sports brokerage, sports marketing, and youth training and education. ""We don't rule out that in the future there may be more in-depth cooperation between the two sides in the Chinese market, but this does not mean that Mr. Iniesta will join the club as a player."" Japan's Vissel Kobe, named in Spanish media as a possible next club for Iniesta, had no comment on Tuesday when approached by AFP. Football Federation Australia also made no comment after Spain's Sport website named the A-League as Iniesta's ""preferred destination"". Chongqing, in southwest China, had emerged as a surprise contender to snare Iniesta -- one of the finest midfielders of his generation -- despite not being a traditional heavyweight in Chinese football. Their only major success was the FA Cup in 2000, but Iniesta has travelled to the city of 30 million people in the past for promotional events and worked closely with the sports marketing agency Desports. Desports was founded by Chinese businessman and Chongqing chairman Jiang Lizhang, who was said to have been spearheading attempts to lure Iniesta. Chongqing are the second Chinese club to rule out a move for Iniesta, after Tianjin Quanjian threatened legal action to quash reports linking them with the player. A skyrocketing series of expensive deals was brought to a halt last year when the CFA introduced a 100 percent tax on foreign transfers over 45 million yuan ($7 million), with proceeds going into a fund for youth development."

It should not give rise to speculation."" Griezmann has scored 30 goals in 51 games this season and can end the campaign by winning the Europa League, with Atletico up against Marseille in the final later this month. Any deal with Barcelona would place in further doubt the future of Ousmane Dembele, who has endured a difficult first season at the Camp Nou. Dembele joined Barca from Borussia Dortmund for 147 million euros last year and Bartomeu insists the 20-year-old will not be leaving this summer. ""It's not on the table,"" Bartomeu said. ""Dembele is one for the future and we expect a lot from him in the next few seasons."""
445,07/05/2018,12:55,Barca hold on for draw against Real - five things we learned,Barcelona emerged from a thrilling Clasico the more satisfied on Sunday as the 10-man Catalans edged closer to a first unbeaten La Liga season following a 2-2 draw with Real Madrid.,"Cristiano Ronaldo and Sergi Roberto both missed the second half at Camp Nou, the first injured, the second sent off, as Gareth Bale's late strike rescued Real a point. Lionel Messi had given Barca the lead after early goals from Ronaldo and Luis Suarez. Barca, already crowned champions, remain 15 points ahead of Real in the table but this clash was about more than just points. Here, we look at five things we learned from a controversial contest. If Sunday's match proved anything, it is that the Clasico always means something. Eight yellow cards and one red pointed to the heat in the game, which fizzed throughout and briefly erupted during five bad-tempered minutes at the end of the first half. Without the usual relevance to the league table, and with their differing fates in La Liga and the Champions League, this match came down to a basic need to prove one team was better than the other. Barca will claim Real scraped a draw against opponents down to 10 men for half of the match while Real will say they were without their star player for the same time, and perhaps longer at full fitness. And that is not to mention the many grievances against the referee, from both sides, that could have swung the result. In the end, the debate was left open. Zinedine Zidane's nightmare, far more than a defeat at Camp Nou, would surely have been to lose Cristiano Ronaldo to injury less than three weeks before the Champions League final. Real now face an anxious wait to discover the extent of the damage, with tests due to be carried out on Monday. After the match, Zidane reported that Ronaldo had said it was only a ""small problem"" but in the same breath admitted the striker was a ""little bit worried"" by the swelling. The hope will be that Ronaldo played on for 31 minutes after his collision with Gerard Pique because the damage was not significant, rather than made it worse to avoid sitting out a Clasico. Either way, the Portugese will now endure the unwanted attention that comes with sustaining an injury so close to a crunch game. Liverpool will watch with interest. Perhaps if there was a match to demonstrate all the attributes that pushed Barcelona to a domestic double, this was it. There was the individual brilliance of Messi, who steered the momentum by putting his side ahead with a superb solo effort in the second half. There was the important save from Marc-Andre ter Stegen, who denied Ronaldo early on. There was the grit and resilience instilled by Ernesto Valverde, as Barca played for 45 minutes a man down but still eked out a draw. There was the standing ovation for Andres Iniesta and valuable opener from Luis Suarez. There was also a little bit of luck, as Real were denied a clear penalty late on when Jordi Alba booted Marcelo. This was Barca, not always at their mesmerising best, but gutsy and, in the league at least, unbeatable. Gareth Bale had the last word and he will hope Zidane was listening. After being left on the bench for both semi-final legs against Bayern Munich, and taken off at half-time against Juventus, Bale is most likely to start the Champions League final against Liverpool as a substitute. He has three more games to change Zidane's mind and this was a decent start, his goal, a left-footed curler into the top corner, reminiscent of the forward at his sensational best. But it was not all plain-sailing for Bale, who was lucky not to be sent off for thrusting his studs into Samuel Umtiti's calf and, for large spells, was a bit of a bystander out wide. This was Bale's 15th goal in 24 games this year, an impressive record, but perhaps Zidane was left still wanting more. This would have been a fascinating test-case for VAR, a match that was ultimately decided by poor refereeing decisions but defined by its fluency, tempo and aggression. La Liga will introduce video technology next season and Zidane, rather pointedly, said: ""Then we'll see how a match like this turns out."" But the bad calls hindered both teams. VAR might have ensured Real were awarded a late penalty, Bale was sent off, Suarez penalised before Messi's goal and a second Suarez goal, ruled out for offside, stood. But would the game have been better for it? Perhaps more accurate, but the stoppages would also have killed its rhythm. This match showed why VAR can be valuable but cannot be intrusive."

Ronaldo was replaced at the interval after hurting his ankle in the process of scoring while Barcelona's Sergi Roberto was sent off in first-half stoppage time."
447,05/05/2018,19:03,It was not worth trying to change Iniesta's mind - Valverde,Barcelona coach Ernesto Valverde has admitted he did not try to change Andres Iniesta's mind when the midfielder told him he was leaving around a month ago.,"Valverde also said he ""does not care"" if Real Madrid refuse to give Barca a guard of honour before Sunday's Clasico, with the hosts coming into the match as La Liga and Copa del Rey champions. The meeting of Spain's two biggest teams at the Camp Nou will be Iniesta's last, after he announced he will be leaving Barcelona at the end of the season. Iniesta, who is expected to complete a move to China, has been key in recent months but Valverde said there was no point trying to persuade the 33-year-old. ""He told me around a month, a month and a half ago,"" Valverde said. ""I was not going to say anything, we exchanged opinions, it was a very thoughtful conversation. ""When the person who tells you is someone who has his kind of experience, not like a younger player where you can try to direct him, you don't try to convince him or make him think more about it."" Iniesta's finale will be one of a number of sub-plots running around this weekend's fixture, which carries minimal significance in terms of the La Liga table. But the perception of each club's season is at stake. Barcelona can add an unbeaten league campaign to their domestic double, while Real are looking to spoil the streak ahead of what they hope will be a triumphant Champions League final later this month. ""La Liga, for coaches, is the one that tells you how a team has been for the whole year. In the end, the best one wins,"" Valverde said. ""In the Champions League, more factors come into play - good luck, bad luck, sometimes in the Champions League there are more candidates able to win. ""I'll take everything. When you analyse it, you always think about what you have lost."" Valverde was reluctant to be drawn on the bubbling issue of the guard of honour after Zidane had repeated on Saturday Real would not perform one this weekend. Zidane attributed his reasoning to Barca, who refused to make the gesture for Real in December after Los Blancos had won the Club World Cup. ""We've already talked a lot about that and it certainly is not going to be important,"" Valverde said. ""It seems good to me, I do not care."" Valverde also tried to downplay the significance of comments made by Luis Suarez, in which the striker appeared to refer to Atletico Madrid's Antoine Griezmann as if he was already a Barcelona player. ""He's welcome,"" Suarez told Radio Uruguay. ""He's not coming to take anyone's place, but with the ambition to do big things with the best club in the world. I'm proud Barca keep signing players of such quality."" Valverde said: ""I have no doubt that he is speaking figuratively because we are all respectful of an opponent's players. Nobody takes for granted something we do not know will happen."""

Deportivo La Coruna made the gesture ahead of their game against Barca last weekend while Barca gave Real a guard of honour at the Santiago Bernabeu in 2008, after Los Blancos had already won the league. But Barcelona bucked the trend when the two teams met in December, opting against honouring Real's success in the Club World Cup as Barca argued they had not taken part in the competition. ""I'm not the one who decides,"" Zidane said on Saturday. ""After the Club World Cup, it wasn´t important for them to give us a guard of honour. ""They said they weren't in the competition, but that's a lie, because you get into the Club World Cup through the Champions League. ""They didn't give us one, so what's most important is respecting what they have done. They´ve won the double and I respect that, and I congratulate them on that. ""But we're not going to do something for them which they didn't do for us."" Barcelona coach Ernesto Valverde said in December the 'pasillo' had ""lost its original essence"", adding, ""I would not do it and I would not want it to be done to me"". There is a sense in Spain the ceremony has become more about humiliating the defeated team, rather than congratulating the champions. Real may, however, choose to pay tribute to midfielder Andres Iniesta, who will be playing his last Clasico before he leaves Barcelona at the end of the season. ""He is a player we admire, he's not just any player,"" Zidane said. ""We will wave to him, congratulate him and wish him the best of luck for the future."" This meeting of La Liga´s two most glamorous clubs will have minimal affect on the table, given Barca are unassailable and Real, now concentrating on the Champions League final, are safe inside the top four. But Barca are four games away from finishing their first league season unbeaten while Real may be hoping to maintain momentum ahead of their showpiece clash against Liverpool. Zidane is still likely to rest Raphael Varane and Isco, who are struggling with calf and shoulder injuries respectively. Dani Carvajal also remains out with a hamstring problem. ""Give up in the league? Under me it will not happen,"" Zidane said. ""We have to finish as high as possible and what matters most to me is to prepare for the Champions League final and that is done through our intensity in the matches. I'm convinced of that."""
449,04/05/2018,15:21,Barca desperate to maintain unbeaten La Liga record - Digne,Barcelona defender Lucas Digne has admitted he and his team-mates are desperate to avoid surrendering their unbeaten La Liga record to Real Madrid on Sunday.,"Barca are four games away from adding a first invincible La Liga season to their domestic double but this weekend they host a Real side in form, and buoyed by their run to the Champions League final. This Clasico at the Camp Nou may not carry much importance in terms of the table but Real's success in Europe is threatening to overshadow Barca's success in the league. Digne, speaking exclusively to AFP, said finishing the campaign undefeated has now become key. ""It's that consistency, it shows the hard work of the whole group throughout the season, it's huge,"" Digne said. ""Of course, this is a record the team now wants to go for. It is important for us and we will give everything to hold on to it."" Barca also still feel the need to atone for their Champions League collapse against Roma, which hangs over the club, despite their domestic success. Real's subsequent march to the final has only deepened the sense of disappointment. ""Real winning the Champions League is still hypothetical, it is not done yet,"" Digne said. ""There are two sides to our season -- we would have hoped to go further in the Champions League and we thought we could have won it but that didn't happen. ""The double is still something exceptional and we are still undefeated in the league. We have to remember it is still a very strong season."" There is an undercurrent that this meeting with Real will go some way to defining how Barcelona's season is perceived. When it comes to El Clasico, there is no such thing as a dead rubber. ""Quite simply, it's the biggest match in the world,"" Digne said. ""There is an expectation that is just amazing and a rivalry between the two clubs that goes back a very long way. ""It is felt from the supporters, to the players, to everyone. It is really a special atmosphere."" Digne is coming to the end of his second season at Barca, having joined from Paris Saint-Germain in 2016. He remains the number two to Jordi Alba at left-back but is highly thought of by coach Ernesto Valverde, with whom he enjoys a strong relationship. ""The coach has added so much to us tactically and defensively -- we are much stronger and the results prove it,"" Digne said. ""He asks us to defend properly because we are a team that attacks a lot. We have become more balanced and harder to beat."" Real have indicated they will not be giving the champions a guard of honour but the suggestion is the teams may come together to salute Andres Iniesta, who is playing his final Clasico before leaving at the end of the season. Digne places the 33-year-old among the finest players in the history of the game. ""I am proud to have played with a player like him,"" Digne said. ""For me he's one of the greatest players of all time, an idol on and off the field. We will do everything we can on the pitch to say thank you."""
450,04/05/2018,03:30,'Clasico of honour' - Real look to crash unbeaten Barca's party,"Real Madrid can transform their own season by beating Liverpool in this month's Champions League final, and on Sunday they can dent Barcelona's by becoming the first team to defeat the Catalans in La Liga.","This 'clasico' at Camp Nou will have minimal impact on the league, with Barca already crowned champions and Real's passing interest in pipping Atletico to second place diminished by their ambitions in Europe. But there is still much at stake in what Madrid's daily newspaper Marca has billed ""the clasico of honour"". It could even be argued this match will go some way to defining the seasons of these two teams. Barca, in particular, have been careful in celebrating their domestic double, their players aware of the disappointment that lingers from their Champions League crash in the quarter-finals. Even as they ordered pizza and slurped beer from the top of their open-top bus down Las Ramblas this week, it was noticeable how many interviews still referenced the disappointment in Rome. ""The elimination in the Champions League, it hurt us because it was unexpected,"" said Barca coach Ernesto Valverde. ""But it is very difficult to do what we have done and now what are we going to do? We keep trying."" To soften the blow, Barca's best response was to win the Copa del Rey and La Liga and finish unbeaten in the league for the first time, while hoping Real do not go all the way in the Champions League. The latter two are still to be decided. Real's march towards a 13th European triumph has certainly weighed heavily on Barcelona, whose sense of absence has been heightened by the progress of their rivals. ""It's amazing to be in a Champions League final for the third time in a row and have the chance to win it for the fourth time in the last five years,"" Real midfielder Toni Kroos said on Tuesday. ""It's hard for me to find words to describe that. When it comes to the Champions League, we have extra motivation."" Barca are looking to avoid defeat this weekend, and in their last three league games against Villarreal, Levante and Real Sociedad to seal a historic season. But if Real snatch a victory at the Camp Nou and also see off Liverpool, perhaps the balance is tipped in their favour. It will certainly be the last 'clasico' for Andres Iniesta as a player while Gareth Bale may also wave goodbye to this fixture, with the Welshman expected to consider his future at Real in the summer. The suggestion is both teams could give the departing Iniesta, Barca's captain, a guard of honour, even if Real refuse to do so for Barcelona's La Liga triumph. Bale was again a substitute against Bayern Munich on Tuesday, meaning he has now started only one of Real's six Champions League knock-out games. Zidane has been playing Bale, and resting key players, in La Liga matches but he is not likely to field a weakened team this weekend. Elsewhere, Sevilla will play their first match under their caretaker coach Joaquin Caparros on Friday against Real Sociedad. Vincenzo Montella was sacked after last weekend's loss to lowly Levante, which left the team eighth in the table and a point outside the Europa League qualification places. ""We have changed some subtle things but there is no time,"" Caparros said on Thursday. ""Our work with the players so far has been more than anything emotional."" Atletico Madrid, who are five points ahead of Real, host struggling Espanyol on Sunday."
451,30/04/2018,00:12,"Barcelona have been far superior in La Liga, says Messi","Lionel Messi revelled in Barcelona's seventh La Liga title in 10 seasons on Sunday, saying his team were ""far superior"" to their domestic rivals during their double-winning campaign.","The Argentinian star scored a brilliant 30th La Liga hat-trick as Barca survived a scare to beat Deportivo La Coruna 4-2, wrapping up the club's 25th league title with four matches to spare and keeping their hopes of an unbeaten season alive. ""We have been far superior to our rivals, we haven't lost a match during the whole season,"" Messi told Barcelona's in-house television channel. ""It's a very special Liga in that sense, because we haven't lost a single match. We've had some tough times and we've overcome everything without losing, which is unbelievable."" Regaining the top-flight crown from Real Madrid also secured Barcelona their third double in four years after thrashing Sevilla 5-0 in last weekend's Copa del Rey final. The only blemish on their season was a stunning Champions League quarter-final loss to Roma when they blew a 4-1 first-leg lead to be dumped out at the Stadio Olimpico. ""We lost just one in the Cup and disappointingly another in the Champions League,"" added Messi, who leads the La Liga scoring charts with 32 goals this term. ""That was an unexpected result in view of our shape. But we take a lot of merit to win a title as difficult as this without losing a game."" The five-time Ballon d'Or winner also paid tribute to captain Andres Iniesta. The 33-year-old midfielder came off the bench in the 87th minute at Deportivo to make his 670th Barcelona appearance just two days after announcing that he will leave the club at the end of the season. ""It's a shame for us and the club, but he deserved to go like that,"" said Messi. ""We deplore what happened in the Champions League, it prevented him from going out with a treble, but he's leaving in an impressive fashion. ""This double is more than deserved for Andres, for all he has given to this club. I am very happy for him and wish him all the best."""

On Sunday, he came off the bench for a brief cameo appearance as Barcelona defeated Deportivo La Coruna 4-2 at a Riazor stadium which stood to honour him. ""This feels good. The championship is a competition that lasts all year, it is about consistency and the team deserved this title,"" said Iniesta. ""It has been a great season with the Copa del Rey and now La Liga."" On the ovation he received from Deportivo fans when he made his 87th-minute entry, he said was overwhelmed, especially as the home side had been relegated as a result of the defeat. ""These are indescribable emotions. On a personal level, as a sportsman, there are no words when you receive such affection in such a difficult situation for the fans. ""I am eternally grateful for all the messages received from the heart. In all my career, I tried to be a good sportsman, a good person, being respectful. ""I have been fortunate to experience unique situations. I am very grateful."""
453,29/04/2018,23:02,Barcelona storm to La Liga title but work to be done this summer,Barcelona will bid a glorious farewell to Andres Iniesta after winning La Liga on Sunday to seal a domestic double but this season may mark the end for more than just the 33-year-old midfielder.,"Iniesta is calling time, for some prematurely, on his 22-year association with the club he joined as a 12-year-old and he goes out on a high after Barca turned what threatened to be a transitional, even turbulent, campaign into a tremendous one. They wrapped up the title with four games to spare, 11 points ahead of Atletico Madrid and 15 clear of Real. They have been top since beating Espanyol in their third game on September 9. They are 41 league matches unbeaten and four away from becoming the first ever side to finish a single La Liga calendar as invincibles. As title races go, this one was a whitewash but all the more surprising then, that this Barca side will not be remembered particularly fondly, even by their own supporters. Before last weekend's Copa del Rey final against Sevilla, which they won 5-0, Barcelona's daily sports newspaper Mundo Deportivo wrote Ernesto Valverde's future as coach could be in doubt if they missed out on the double. When Barca threw away a 4-1 advantage to lose to Roma in the Champions League quarter-finals, the same publication described it as a ""disaster"", ""disgrace"" and, most damaging of all, ""deserved"". That collapse will still hang over the title celebrations, because it was not a one-off -- this was Barca's third consecutive exit in the last eight -- and because Real's march towards the final has heightened the sense of absence. But more than their departure in Europe, Valverde's team have departed from tradition in the way they have won. Barca have scored 87 goals, with four matches left. Since Pep Guardiola's first season in charge, they have won the title seven times, with their goals scored column for those years reading 105, 98, 95, 115, 110 and 112. This team was not always entertaining and occasionally it was even dull, but it was organised, disciplined and never knew when it was beaten. Late escapes against Espanyol, Atletico and Sevilla preserved the undefeated run and maintained momentum. The dogged 1-0 victory over Atletico in March all-but delivered the title. Lionel Messi's free-kick proved decisive that day and the Argentinian has arguably been the difference all season, offering creativity, penetration and a league-high 32 goals to a team not so blessed with attacking imagination. But even if underwhelming on the eye and perhaps over-reliant on Messi, Valverde and his team deserve even greater credit considering where they began in August. When the unexpected sale of Neymar to Paris Saint-Germain was followed by Super Cup defeats home and away by Real Madrid, many concluded Barca's squad had been worsened by the transfer market, not improved. Despite the impressive job Valverde has done since, that will have to be rectified this summer. In the Copa del Rey final, only three players in the starting line-up were younger than 29 -- Samuel Umtiti, Sergi Roberto and Philippe Coutinho. With Iniesta gone, only Messi, Sergio Busquets and Gerard Pique will be left of Guardiola's 'tika-takas', the latter pair both showing signs this season that Barca could do with a more capable back-up. Coutinho is expected to fill Iniesta's shoes, although that gargantuan task cannot be completed overnight, and Antoine Griezmann's potential arrival from Atletico would allow the 31-year-old Luis Suarez more regular rest next term. But on the flanks and in midfield, Barca need more quality and depth. As well as Messi, they have relied on the brilliant Marc-Andre ter Stegen in goal too often. Barcelona's domestic dominance has been as relentless as it has been remarkable but this ageing squad is creaking and in need of renovation. To do it again, and do better in Europe, it will need to be a busy summer."
454,28/04/2018,19:39,"'Best team' wins La Liga, insists Barca coach Valverde","Midfield legend Andres Iniesta is set to quit while arch rivals Real Madrid are prepping for a 13th Champions League, yet Ernesto Valverde insists his Barcelona side are still the best team in Spain.","A win at Deportivo La Coruna on Sunday would see Barcelona seal their 25th La Liga title, and first since 2016, with four games to spare. Having wrapped up the first part of a league and Cup double with a 5-0 Copa del Rey final rout of Sevilla last week, Valverde insisted Saturday: ""When the league started in August, we were all on the start line and we all know that, at the finish, it's the best team who wins. ""The best team of the lot wins La Liga."" He added: ""We've been working hard from day one, and now we have a few opportunities (to win the league) but if possible we want to wrap it up tomorrow (Sunday)."" Iniesta's imminent departure from Barcelona at the end of the campaign has given Valverde a headache about how to re-balance his team once the 33-year-old midfield maestro finally quits the Camp Nou. And Barca's failure to reach the last four of Europe's premier club competition for the third consecutive season -- while Real bid for another final appearance following a 2-1 semi-final, first leg win over Bayern Munich -- has led to speculation about Valverde's future. But Valverde, who suggested Barcelona, like many other Catalonians, were affected by the ""difficult"" circumstances of a protracted but failed pro-independence movement, is hoping to honour his contract, which expires at the end of 2019: ""When you arrive at such a big club you face big tests every week, every day in training. ""But up until now it's been an extraordinary experience and I hope it will continue. ""There have been great times, not so great times and difficult circumstances off the pitch including the general (political) situation in Catalonia this past year. ""But we've all tried to overcome those difficulties and move on. That's why I'm particularly happy about how things turned out. ""During the season we always hear talk about the coach in one way or another, but this is all speculation. I have a contract for next season and I'm happy here."" Unearthing another Iniesta would go a long way in making amends for Barca's sorry Champions League quarter-final exit to Roma earlier this month. But Valverde does not expect to find another player with Iniesta's vast array of silky-smooth playmaking skills any time soon. ""Iniesta is irreplacable, it's difficult to imagine that one day another player will do as well as Iniesta,"" said Valverde. ""When such a special player leaves, you have to find a different balance in the team, different ways to play. ""The style of our game is defined and is very clear. But no one can give us what Iniesta gives us."""
455,27/04/2018,16:15,"Zidane, Guardiola, Lopetegui pay tribute to Iniesta",Real Madrid coach Zinedine Zidane has paid tribute to Andres Iniesta after he said he was leaving Barcelona and believes the midfielder should have won the Ballon d´Or in 2010.,"Iniesta announced on Friday he will be leaving Barca at the end of the season, bringing an end to a 22-year association with the club. He is expected to move to China but is yet to name his next team. The 33-year-old has enjoyed a glittering career, winning eight La Liga and four Champions League titles, but has never claimed football's most prestigious individual award. Iniesta was beaten to the Ballon d´Or by Lionel Messi in 2010, despite clinching the World Cup that year with Spain, and scoring the decisive goal against Holland in the final. ""What I'm going to say will maybe make headlines tomorrow,"" Zidane said with a smile on Friday. ""I think he really deserved to win the Ballon d´Or when he won his World Cup, he had an exceptional year and he finished the World Cup by winning it, by scoring (in the final), so obviously that year he would have deserved it."" It was the period when Iniesta was arguably at his best, as Barcelona won three consecutive league titles under Pep Guardiola, as well as the Champions League twice. ""I could spend a lot of minutes talking about him, he's another part of the history of Barca in the last 15 or 20 years which would not be possible without him,"" Guardiola said. ""I just want to say thank you because he helped me to understand the game better. ""Just watching him do what he does on the football pitch despite the amount of tackles, the way he's a professional... I thank him so much for what he has done. ""When he decides to retire, maybe a decade from now, he will come back into football - at Barcelona especially - and he can teach others what he's shown on the pitch."" Iniesta is expected to announce his international retirement after this summer´s World Cup, when he will be hoping to go out on a high by winning the tournament again with Spain. Spain coach Julen Lopetegui has no doubt about Iniesta´s motivation in Russia. ""Andres is a player absolutely in the first class,"" Lopetegui said. ""I would not speak of Andres in the past, I speak of him in the present. The recognition he has had at all levels of international football is not earned by chance. ""How he has won and how he has behaved in victory makes him loved in all the stadiums in Spain and abroad, and that is a treasure very few players in history can have. ""He has maximum motivation to be at the World Cup and to finish well with his team like he did with Barca in the Copa del Rey final."""
456,27/04/2018,16:06,"Iniesta, humble Galactico, breaks hearts with Barca farewell",Andres Iniesta's decision to part ways with FC Barcelona leaves a massive hole at the legendary club and in the hearts of football lovers everywhere.,"Widely considered one of the greatest players of his generation and among the most gifted midfielders of all time, Iniesta, 33, said Friday he would close his Barcelona career at the end of the season. But he will also be remembered as the humble Galactico, almost the anti-star, who spurned the bling and trappings of the modern football hero for the life of a quiet family man away from the media glare. Even so the modest, diminutive national treasure who scored the winning goal for Spain in the 2010 World Cup final and led Barcelona to the treble in 2009 and 2015, steps away from Camp Nou as the most decorated Spanish player of all time with more than 30 trophies for club and country. ""You have to say he is the most important player of this winning era that started in 2004,"" said Barcelona president Josep Maria Bartomeu. ""He arrived here at the age of 12 and has had his entire career here. He has been a shining example both for the sport and himself personally, right until the last game last weekend (in the Copa Del Rey). All parents would want to have a son like Iniesta."" And all teams would like to have the creative genius and the character of the 1.70m (5ft 7in) wizard known for his dribbling and penetrative dashes that cut through the best defences the world over the past 14 years. For Lionel Messi, Iniesta's steely inner strength when the going got tough was as important as the outward brilliance. ""On the pitch I like him to be near me, particularly when a game takes a turn for the worse, when things get difficult. That's when I say to him: 'Come closer',"" the Argentinian star was quoted as saying in Iniesta's book, 'The Artist'. Few Barcelona players have won a standing ovation from fans of bitter rivals Real Madrid but Iniesta earned the rare tribute when he led Barca to a stunning 4-0 win in the Classico at the Bernabeu stadium in 2015. Born in the village of Fuentealbilla, between Madrid and Valencia, where a bronze statue commemorates him, Iniesta was scouted by Barcelona as a 12-year-old. He has been a rock through a career with four Champions League and seven Spanish league titles after making his debut at 18, scoring 57 goals in 669 club appearances. ""He's so good that it is impossible not to play him,"" said Iniesta's former Barcelona boss Pep Guardiola. ""Nobody has a better reading of space and time. ""But, above that, he has the ability to unbalance opposition teams. He is the player that always kills you in attacks and he is always there in the biggest games."" Yet, just as key to Iniesta's status as a national treasure in Spain as his World Cup winner, is a humility often at odds with modern football and the ostentatious lifestyle of its highly paid stars. ""Hero? No way,"" he told El Pais on how his life changed after the goal against the Netherlands in Johannesburg that clinched the 2010 World Cup for Spain. ""Heroes are those who fight against illnesses, or who have to emigrate to feed their children. ""I am a privileged man who plays football and who, sometimes, has the luck to make people happy by scoring a goal or giving a pass to help win a game. ""That is the good thing about this national team, that we have given joyful days to those anonymous heroes who don't often get the chance to smile."""
457,27/04/2018,15:37,Five questions as Iniesta announces Barcelona departure,Andres Iniesta announced on Friday he will leave Barcelona at the end of the season after 22 years at the club.,"Here, we look at five key questions around the Spaniard´s departure. Why is he leaving now? Iniesta was awarded a ""lifetime contract"" by Barcelona in October, allowing the Spaniard the chance to decide when he felt it was the right time to leave. That responsibility may have played on Iniesta´s mind because he admitted the main motivation behind his decision was to finish at his best, while he was still winning titles and before he started to ""deceive"" the club. Iniesta has been one of Barcelona´s key players this season, but he was determined to go out at the top. Where will he go next? Iniesta revealed in March he had an offer to move to China, with Chongqing Dangdai Lifan the club expected to win the race for his signature. But the 33-year-old said on Friday there were still details to be finalised on his next move, perhaps with a view to the negotiations to come. Interested European clubs will be disappointed, however. Iniesta reiterated he will never play against Barcelona, adding ""all scenarios not in Europe are possible."" Will he still play at the World Cup? If selected, and he will be, Iniesta will play for Spain in Russia. After finishing at Barca with what will almost certainly be a domestic double, he will hope to end his international career lifting the biggest prize in the game. The expectation is he will then announce his retirement from international football, with a glittering trophy cabinet that already boasts the World Cup in 2010 and the European Championships titles from 2008 and 2012. How will Barca replace him? In short, Iniesta is irreplaceable. His influence off the pitch at Barcelona, as well as on it, has been enormous, as demonstrated by members of the first team and the club´s board attending his press conference on Friday. Philippe Coutinho, signed for 160 million euros from Liverpool in January, is perhaps most similar in style but it would be too big a burden to expect the Brazilian to step into Iniesta´s shoes. Barca will have to find a new direction. How will he be remembered? At his peak, Iniesta was a symbol of Spanish possession-based football and to this day, many maintain he should have won the Ballon D´Or in 2010, when he finished second to Lionel Messi. Off the pitch, Iniesta has always been a quiet and unassuming individual but that has not diminished the affection felt for him by fans. Even supporters of Espanyol, Barca´s bitter rivals, applaud the midfielder after he celebrated his World Cup winning goal in 2010 by lifting up his shirt to reveal a tribute to Dani Jarque, Espanyol´s captain who died the previous year. It was a touching gesture and as good a way as any to sum up Iniesta."
458,27/04/2018,14:03,Iniesta to leave Barcelona at the end of the season,"Andres Iniesta confirmed on Friday he will leave Barcelona at the end of the season, bringing the curtain down on a phenomenally successful career at the club, but said a move to China is yet to be finalised.","In a press conference attended by members of the first team and the club's board, Iniesta said he wanted to finish at Barca ""feeling useful, feeling important and still winning titles"". Iniesta is expected to continue his career at a club in the Chinese Super League but remained tight-lipped on his next destination. The 33-year-old revealed only that it will be outside Europe, reiterating he would never play against Barcelona. After joining Barca's academy, La Masia, aged 12, Iniesta blossomed into one of the Catalans' greatest ever players, winning four Champions League and eight La Liga titles, and lifting the World Cup with Spain. Struggling to hold back the tears, Iniesta said: ""I understand that in the near future I will not be able to give the best of myself in all senses, both physically and mentally. ""If I had imagined finishing my career here, it would have been like this, feeling useful, feeling important and still winning titles. ""It's a very difficult day for me because I've been here all my life and to say goodbye to my home and my life here is very hard."" Iniesta's short speech was greeted by applause and the congratulations are likely to continue on Sunday, when he can collect his ninth La Liga title. Barcelona need only a point against Deportivo La Coruna to be crowned champions. It would secure a domestic double in Iniesta's farewell campaign, after a thumping win over Sevilla clinched the Copa del Rey last weekend. Iniesta capped a typically elegant performance at the Wanda Metropolitano with a wonderful finish, shimmying past goalkeeper David Soria and tapping in his 57th club goal, on his 669th appearance. He would not be short of suitors this summer among the world's elite clubs but Iniesta, who already has an offer from China, will not be staying in Europe. ""There are things to talk about, things to finalise,"" Iniesta said. ""The only thing I have always said is I would never compete against my club so all scenarios that are not in Europe are possible."" Among those likely to be disappointed is Iniesta's former coach Pep Guardiola at Manchester City, who has reportedly tried to push the merits of a move to England. Guardiola's Barca team, which won La Liga three times in a row between 2009 and 2011, as well as the Champions League twice, enjoyed Iniesta at his mesmorising best. During that period, Iniesta became the poster-boy for fluid, possession-based football, for which this decade of Spanish dominance will be forever remembered. He would have won the Ballon d´Or in 2010 but finished second to Lionel Messi. ""To play with Messi has been and still is an honour and a privilege,"" Iniesta said. ""To share with him so many magical moments is a privilege because I understand there is no other player like him. As a team-mate and a footballer, being so close to him has been unique and magical."" A glorious farewell with the Spanish national team is also possible at the World Cup this summer, after which Iniesta is expected to call time on an international career that has included winning the World Cup in South Africa in 2010, between consecutive successes at the European Championships in 2008 and 2012. Iniesta's succession will not be easy, particularly for Barcelona, whose original 'tika-takas' are now down to Messi, 30, Sergio Busquets, 29, and Gerard Pique, 31. It is hoped Philippe Coutinho, bought from Liverpool for 160 million euros in January, can help fill the void. Asked how he would like to be remembered, Iniesta said: ""It's easy, I want to be remembered as a great football player and a great person. I've wanted to represent this club in the best possible way and I hope I have achieved it."""

Chongqing coach Paulo Bento, who was in charge of Portugal at the last World Cup, said: ""This is a rumour and it is very difficult to comment on rumours. ""But I don't think there is any fan or coach in the world that doesn't like a player like Iniesta,"" the Portuguese said, according to Chinese media reports, after Chongqing won 2-0 at Anhui Hefei in the fourth round of the Chinese FA Cup on Wednesday. Iniesta, who has been central to Barcelona and Spain's success over more than a decade, looks set to leave his boyhood club at the end of the season. He is keeping tight-lipped about his future, but he has been strongly linked for months with a move to the CSL and most recently Chongqing, whose only major trophy was the Chinese FA Cup in 2000.

There was no sign of age catching up with the Spaniard at the Wanda Metropolitano where Iniesta capped a sublime performance by scoring Barca's fourth goal. He looked tearful as he departed to a standing ovation in the second half, from some Sevilla fans too, before hoisting the Copa del Rey trophy aloft. ""This week I will make my decision public but we will always have days like today,"" Iniesta said. Asked if this was his last final with Barcelona, Iniesta added: ""It's a possibility. In a few days I'll make it public and nothing more. Today is a very special and emotional day."" The top sponsor of China club Chongqing Dangdai Lifan told the state-run Xinhua news agency Saturday he was ""positive"" they would sign Iniesta, who had earlier this year also been linked with fellow Chinese Super League outfit Tianjin Quanjian. ""I will say what the decision is this week,"" said Iniesta. ""I think it's a little clear but we will see."" Lionel Messi scored in between a first-half double for Luis Suarez as Barcelona ran riot to secure their fourth Copa del Rey triumph in as many years. Philippe Coutinho converted a late penalty to make it 5-0. But Iniesta was the man of the moment, his fourth goal a moment of individual brilliance after a superb shimmy left Sevilla goalkeeper David Soria helpless to save the finish. ""Today he played a match as such a high level, it seemed that he was 25 years old,"" Sevilla coach Vincenzo Montella said. ""It would be difficult to find another player to replace him."" Barcelona coach Ernesto Valverde said: ""When I was a player I would have given my right arm to do what he and Messi do. It's a stroke of good luck to have him."" This was the sixth time Iniesta has won the Copa del Rey, adding another trophy to a remarkable collection that already includes eight La Liga titles, three Champions League crowns and a World Cup. He will win a ninth La Liga title if Barcelona beat Deportivo La Coruna next weekend. ""It was a great night in all ways, on a collective and personal level,"" Iniesta said. ""We will try to add the League to leave a good taste in people's mouths. It is a day of many emotions and I am very happy."" Barca defender Jordi Alba said: ""It has been and is a pleasure to share a changing room with him today, he is number one in his position and as person. ""The decision that he takes should be respected because he deserves it. But the day Iniesta leaves is the day we will all cry. We will miss him."""
462,22/04/2018,02:03,Barca hammer Sevilla to win 30th Copa del Rey,Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez inspired Barcelona to what will surely be the first part of a domestic double this season as they thrashed Sevilla 5-0 on Saturday to win the Copa del Rey.,"Messi had scored once and Suarez twice before even the half-time whistle had blown at the Wanda Metropolitano, with the sublime Andres Iniesta and Philippe Coutinho later compounding Sevilla's humiliation. Barca's exhilarating display earns them their 30th triumph in this competition and fourth in a row, having reached the final in each of the last five years. But, despite hugs and high-fives at the end, the real celebrations will be put on ice until next Sunday, when victory over Deportivo La Coruna will confirm Ernesto Valverde's side as La Liga champions too. Even a clean sweep of the domestic trophies, perhaps polished by La Liga's first ever unbeaten season, will not eradicate the lingering disappointment from Barca's Champions League exit to Roma. But this performance, as easy on the eye as it was emphatic, will certainly serve as a counter-point to those that believe Valverde's team have been efficient, rather than exciting this season, and overly reliant on Messi. ""Winning the Cup does not hide the disappointment in Rome,"" Suarez said after the match. ""But at the beginning of the season anyone would have signed for a double."" Messi was, of course, superb again on Saturday but this was not a one-man show. Suarez scored his 31st and 32nd goals of the season while Iniesta delivered one of those effortless displays, in which at times he was virtually unplayable. If this is to be the 33-year-old's last Barca final before departing for China, it was a fitting farewell, with only goalkeeper Jasper Cillessen absent from the 10-man huddle that engulfed the Spaniard following his shimmying fourth. By the time Coutinho converted his penalty in the 69th minute, Barca were simply sharing the goals around. For Sevilla, defeat was always the most likely scenario but this was a whitewash. Sitting eighth in La Liga, even Europa League qualification now looks an outside bet and there may be repercussions for coach Vincenzo Montella and some of his players in the summer. ""Barcelona has been superior in everything, they have extra-terrestrial players,"" Montella said. "" I'm very sorry for the fans who have been fantastic, sorry for the disappointments. I have seen crying in the dressing room but tomorrow, we have to work."" Amid ongoing political unrest between Catalonia and the Spanish government, Barca fans whistled during the national anthem before kick-off, with king Felipe VI watching on. Their jeers, however, were drowned out by the chants of Sevilla supporters. When the first goal arrived it came from a long Cillessen punt downfield as Coutinho found himself free behind the Sevilla backline and squared for Suarez to stab home. Iniesta hit the bar with a rasping shot from distance and soon they were two up, Jordi Alba keeping the ball alive with a backheel that Messi slammed into the roof of the net. Messi could have had a second were it not for an incorrect offside call and then a cynical foul by Sergio Escudero, for which he was lucky only to receive a yellow card. Both mattered little, however, as Messi set Suarez free in the 41st minute, and the Uruguayan slid a third under David Soria. It was another one-two, with Messi again the pivot, that released Iniesta in the second half as the midfielder's dummy-shot left Soria scrambling and an open net for the midfielder to finish into. Resigned to their fate, Sevilla's fans sang to the end, even as Coutinho despatched a penalty to make it five after the ball had struck Clement Lenglet on the arm. All that was left was for Iniesta's substitution to be given a standing ovation before the captain hoisted the trophy, perhaps for the final time."
463,20/04/2018,19:24,"Valverde, Barca looking to put European exit behind them in Cup final",Barcelona coach Ernesto Valverde knows victory in Saturday's Copa del Rey final against Sevilla would go some small way towards making up for the disappointment of their recent Champions League exit.,"""After a big defeat we want a big victory. We have the opportunity to put that little disappointment behind us,"" Valverde said at a press conference on the eve of the game, which will be played at Atletico Madrid's Wanda Metropolitano stadium. Barca are hoping to lift one piece of silverware this weekend before going on to secure the Spanish league title -- they can still complete the entire La Liga season unbeaten. But their domestic success so far this season has been overshadowed by the nature of their Champions League exit. They lost to Roma in the quarter-finals on away goals, capitulating 3-0 in Italy after a 4-1 win at home in the first leg. Barcelona have won the Copa del Rey in each of the last three seasons, including defeating Sevilla 2-0 after extra-time in Madrid in 2016. ""It would be something significant for the club because they have won this final in recent years and it is not an easy thing to do,"" said Valverde. The last team to win the Cup four seasons running was Athletic Bilbao in the early 1930s. A victory for the Catalans would set them up nicely for their next La Liga outing, when a victory at Deportivo La Coruna would secure the title. That is if they are not crowned champions on Sunday, which will be the case if Betis win away to Atletico. ""In La Liga we have five 'match balls' left and we just need to take one of them, but we will try to do it as soon as possible,"" added Valverde, although he had a warning for his side ahead of Saturday's final. ""We have still not won anything yet. The title is still up for grabs. We were also favourites (against Roma) and we got knocked out. We need to take the final step."""
464,20/04/2018,02:19,No room for error as Barca face Sevilla in Copa del Rey final,Barcelona and Sevilla will know the success of their respective seasons is on the line when they go head to head in the Copa del Rey final on Saturday.,"The Cup would certainly have been third on Barca's list of priorities only a month ago, but the shattering Champions League defeat to Roma has altered perceptions of what might have otherwise have been a stellar campaign. Unbeaten in La Liga and virtually certain to win the title, a domestic double may not be enough to remove the lingering disappointment from Rome, particularly if arch rivals Real Madrid clinch their third consecutive European crown. ""I live with a little anxiety,"" Barca midfielder Philippe Coutinho said Thursday. ""But it is a very important and very happy moment, playing a final only two or three months after arriving."" Another surprise loss this weekend would certainly settle the argument, even if it seems strange to declare a team under pressure six days after they marked the longest unbeaten run in La Liga history. In moulding his team around organisation, hard work and the irrepressible Lionel Messi, Barcelona coach Ernesto Valverde has steered this team away from the club's more free-flowing, attacking traditions. He has proven a master of extraction, drawing the very best from a squad that unexpectedly lost one of its star strikers in Neymar last summer, and owns far less talent than its predecessors. Sevilla have fewer questions to answer in terms of entertaintment. Since Vincenzo Montella took charge in December, they have beaten Atletico Madrid, twice, Manchester United and drawn with Bayern Munich and Barcelona. They have also conceded five goals at home to Real Betis and lost to minnows Alaves, Eibar and Leganes. In their draw against Barca, they shipped two goals in the 87th and 89th minutes. ""We know how they play, that they have quality and a fast counter-attack,"" Coutinho said. ""The most important thing is to think about ourselves, how we have to play and what we should do to win."" Sitting seventh in the table and 17 points adrift of the top four, a trophy -- particularly with a win over Barca -- would diminish a disappointing league position and enhance their run to the Champions League quarter-finals. Lose, and there will be little left to cling onto. ""We have a great opportunity to win a title for the club,"" Sevilla midfielder Pablo Sarabia said. ""We have to think about the good things from this season. ""It is true we have not been consistent in the league but in the Champions League we have made history and in the cup we have the opportunity to lift a trophy."" While Barca, the defending champions, are chasing their 30th Copa del Rey triumph in the Wanda Metropolitano stadium's first tournament final, Sevilla are bidding to win their sixth, and first since 2010. Barca fans are expected to jeer Spain's national anthem before kick-off amid ongoing political unrest between Catalonia and the Spanish government. ""I'm not going to say anything,"" Valverde said. ""I just want the players to respect each other."" Atletico Madrid, who remain 12 points behind Barca in second place after a chastening 3-0 defeat at Real Sociedad on Thursday, will look to make amends at home to fifth-placed Real Betis on Sunday while Celta Vigo and Valencia face off on Saturday. Valencia sit three points behind Real Madrid, who will be using their well-timed weekend off to prepare for the first leg of Wednesday's Champions League semi-final against Bayern Munich.

465,14/04/2018,18:26,Barca set new La Liga record after 39 games unbeaten,Barcelona set a new La Liga record by extending their unbeaten run to 39 games with a 2-1 victory over Valencia on Saturday.,"Luis Suarez and Samuel Umtiti were both on target as Barca passed the 38 matches Real Sociedad managed without defeat between 1979 and 1980. Dani Parejo gave Valencia brief hope with an 87th-minute penalty. The win at the Camp Nou, which was more comfortable than the scoreline suggested, also eases fears that Tuesday's Champions League collapse against Roma could affect Barcelona's march to the league title. Ernesto Valverde's side are now 14 points clear at the top of the table, before second-placed Atletico Madrid play their game in hand against Levante on Sunday. Valencia stay third, one point ahead of Real Madrid, who are also in action on Sunday, away to Malaga. There is no doubt Barca's shock defeat in Italy still lingers, and may still, even if the Catalans secure the first part of an expected domestic double by winning the Copa del Rey next weekend. But it should take little away from their faultless form in the league, which means the last time they tasted defeat outside a cup competition was against Malaga just over 12 months ago. This was already a club record run, now eight games better than the 31 unbeaten Pep Guardiola's brilliant team strung together in the season of 2010-11. It would now seem only the home Clasico against Real Madrid on May 6, and perhaps an awkward trip to Celta Vigo on Tuesday, stand in the way of Barcelona finishing the league campaign as invincibles. Despite their exertions in Rome, Valverde resisted the temptation to rest key players, with Philippe Coutinho and Paulinho coming in for Ivan Rakitic and Nelson Semedo. Barca showed few signs of lost confidence early on and after 15 minutes they took the lead, Coutinho drifting in from the right and, after spotting Suarez's angled run, poking a superb pass in behind. Suarez took the finish first time and swept the ball inside the near post. Valencia, however, found a foothold and arguably were the better side by the end of the half. Pique, already booked, endured a difficult 45 minutes and as he and Marc-Andre ter Stegen dallied at the back and the latter's skewed pass fell to Carlos Soler. Soler played in Rodrigo Moreno but Ter Stegen made up for his mistake by pushing the shot onto the bar. Barcelona started the second half like they began the first though and five minutes after the restart, they doubled their advantage. Umtiti beat Gabriel Paulista to Coutinho's corner and while his header was parried by Neto, Valencia's goalkeeper could only push it in off the post. Valencia's belief was dwindling and two acrobatic volleys, from Lionel Messi and then Andres Iniesta, almost added a spectacular third, as the first flew just over and the second was parried by Neto. There was time for a tense finish after substitute Ousmane Dembele brought down Jose Gaya in the area and Parejo's feeble penalty squirmed under the body of Ter Stegen. But Barca's morale-boosting win was never really in doubt."

""When you do things badly, you commit lots of mistakes and we didn't adapt to the game. It is a massive disappointment given the season we had been having."" Barcelona went to Rome leading 4-1 after the first leg of their quarter-final tie, but a 3-0 loss at the Stadio Olimpico condemned the five-time European champions to a defeat on away goals. It is their third consecutive exit from the competition in the last eight. ""We always try to give the maximum but we are knocked out and now feel everyone's pain. We had high hopes this season and it has escaped us again,"" added the 33-year-old, who also acknowledged that the game could have been his last in the competition for Barca amid uncertainty about his future beyond this season. Barcelona fell behind to an Edin Dzeko goal inside six minutes with Daniele De Rossi netting a 58th-minute penalty before Kostas Manolas headed in the crucial goal eight minutes from the end. The defeat came with Barca currently on course to win La Liga and with a Copa del Rey final against Sevilla approaching later this month. They are unbeaten in La Liga and had only previously lost once all season, to Espanyol in the Copa del Rey. ""I would be lying if I told you we can take something positive from this,"" midfielder Sergio Busquets told beIN SPORTS. ""It is a very sad way to fall after the result we had. They were superior to us in all aspects."" Meanwhile, Barcelona president Josep Maria Bartomeu apologised to the club's supporters. ""The dream for all of us was to reach the semis and I'm very sorry to all the Barcelona fans in the world,"" he told Catalunya TV."

Jurgen Klopp's Liverpool side will host Pep Guardiola's City at Anfield for the first leg, either on April 3 or April 4, as the sides play each other for the first time in Europe. It will also be the first meeting of two English clubs in the last eight of the Champions League since Manchester United overcame Chelsea at that stage in the 2010-2011 season on their way to the final. City's director of football Txiki Begiristain said: ""We know each other very well, they are a very offensive team, the truth is it is going to be a great couple of games."" Cristiano Ronaldo and his Real teammates will be happy to be playing the second leg of their tie at their Santiago Bernabeu stadium against Juventus, whose experience proved lethal to English club Tottenham in the last 16. Real Madrid director Emilio Butragueno said it would be a ""very special match"" ""Juventus played against Tottenham, which had extraordinary results and was superior, and yet, despite the difficulties, came through. They have a competitor's mentality."" Real thrashed Juventus 4-1 in last year's final in Cardiff. Former Roma captain Francesco Totti meanwhile said his club were excited about the prospect of taking on Barcelona and Messi, who scored his 100th Champions League goal in the comfortable 3-0 defeat of Chelsea on Wednesday. ""Meeting Barcelona in the quarter-finals of the Champions League -- that's a match that will be hard to forget,"" Totti told BeIN Sport. Roma's sporting director Monchi joked: ""You can't say we were very lucky with this draw."" German giants Bayern face Sevilla, the surprise slayers of Manchester United in the last round, but goalkeeper Sven Ulreich said they were relieved to avoid one of their major rivals. ""There are harder draws. It's doable, but Sevilla have shone in Europe and they have won three Europa Leagues,"" Ulreich said. ""So we'll be very focused when we go over there (for the first leg) and then we'll do the business at home."" Sevilla's sporting director Oscar Arias said: ""This is very difficult. We are facing one of the historic clubs of European football, a great club in this competition. But we are up for it.""

468,16/03/2018,01:40,Dembele and Barca look to maintain La Liga surge against Bilbao,"Two hundred days after becoming Barcelona's most expensive signing, Ousmane Dembele finally scored his first goal for the club against Chelsea in the Champions League.","Now, the 20-year-old will be hoping to be given the chance to sustain his momentum as Barca turn their attention back to La Liga and the visit of Athletic Bilbao on Sunday. Dembele cost the Catalan club 105 million euros ($124 million) last summer and that figure could swell to 150 million if a number of performance-related bonuses are triggered. But the former Borussia Dortmund forward has struggled to live up to the hype in his debut season in Spain. Dembele suffered a hamstring injury on his first league start and did not play again for his new team until January, by which time Barca were flying in La Liga and about to sign another attacking talent in Philippe Coutinho. Coutinho's arrival has made the competition even fiercer for the final spot up front alongside Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez but, with the Brazilian ineligible against Chelsea and Paulinho left on the bench, Dembele took his chance. A superb finish into the top corner put Barca two up in the first half and Dembele's provider, Lionel Messi, showed his delight by leaping onto his team-mate and slapping his chest. As French compatriot Samuel Umtiti joined the celebrations with a synchronised jump-bump, the relief was palpable that Dembele's Barca career had finally gained lift-off. ""It's about acclimatisation,"" Barcelona coach Ernesto Valverde said. ""He has not been harmed by it. There was the injury, which was a set-back, and coming from another type of football. ""Otherwise, he has to get used to the ways in which we move, either when attacking with possession, or defending as a team with high pressure. ""When we play with a very strong team like today, we sacrifice and play together, he has enjoyed it. He is a very young player with a great future ahead."" Valverde's analysis was a clear indication that Dembele still has work to do and it may be he finds himself rotated out of the starting line-up this weekend. Certainly, Barca cannot afford to dwell on their 3-0 win over Chelsea, with Atletico Madrid eager to cut an eight-point gap at the top of the table. Bilbao, however, are stranded in 12th, too far from either the relegation or European spots and with one day less to rest following their Europa League second leg against Marseille on Thursday. Atletico, meanwhile, visit Villarreal on Sunday as Diego Simeone's side desperately look to tug Barca back into a title race. ""My hope is that we arrive in the last five matches still in with a chance,"" Simeone said after last weekend's win over Celta Vigo. Real Madrid coach Zinedine Zidane has also refused to discount a comeback, but making up 15 points on Barcelona in their ten remaining games seems unlikely. Instead, Real can hold off Valencia to finish third while gaining rhythm ahead of their Champions League quarter-final in three weeks. Gareth Bale will be hoping to win back his place in Zidane's best team by then after the Welshman was left out of the starting line-up for both last 16 legs against Paris Saint-Germain. Real are at home on Sunday to Girona, who are seventh and still very much in contention for a Europa League spot in what is the club's debut season in the top flight. ""Going to the Bernabeu and not having to feel pressure about anything is not a privilege but an opportunity,"" Girona coach Jordi Guerrero said. ""We have to try to step forward and achieve our dream."" Elsewhere, fourth-placed Valencia are at home to Alaves on Saturday and fifth-placed Sevilla travel to Leganes on Sunday.

Barcelona beat Antonio Conte's side 3-0 in the second leg to win the tie 4-1 on aggregate. Chelsea released a statement on Thursday, which read: ""The incidents were brought to the attention of UEFA immediately and information we collect will form the basis of a report the club will send to the relevant authorities and organisations."" After the game, Chelsea requested those affected to contact the club and a spokesman said they were ""aware"" of the incidents that took place. Barcelona are responsible for security around their stadium and if found to have been at fault, the Spanish club could face a fine from UEFA. A UEFA spokesman has said it is still gathering evidence before taking the matter forward. Tension between football fans and security officials in Spain is high, after a police officer died amid riots before a Europa League fixture between Athletic Bilbao and Spartak Moscow last month. Last year, eight Leicester supporters were arrested by Spanish police before the team's Champions League quarter-final with Atletico Madrid."
470,15/03/2018,16:21,Champions League centurion Messi still has more goals to achieve,Marcos Alonso's attention had been diverted for only a second and Lionel Messi was through.,"It was not in the last minute, when tired legs and minds are most vulnerable to lapses in concentration, but the third, when Chelsea's rearguard should have been at its sharpest. Alonso was hardly to blame. The ball ricocheted off him in the penalty area to Luis Suarez and momentarily the full-back's gaze followed to the Uruguayan's foot. Behind, Messi scampered into space, controlled and drove under the body of Thibaut Courtois. Nine of Chelsea's 11 players were yet to even touch the ball. There were spells at the Camp Nou on Wednesday when Messi seemed to be playing within himself. In the first half, a few minutes passed when he even locked into an area on the right wing, receiving possession, keeping it, winning a free-kick, taking a throw-in. The ball was switched to the other flank but came back and Messi had hardly moved. It was as if he had been set a challenge to dictate the match from as small a space as possible. Chelsea had chances, and Messi admitted afterwards Barcelona's place in the Champions League quarter-finals had not felt safe, until he slammed in a third for 3-0, 4-1 on aggregate. ""It was a really tough game,"" Messi said. ""But we played strong as a team. Scoring so early meant we could control the game, but we didn't feel we had finished the tie until we got our third goal. Until then, we had to fight hard and suffer to achieve a very important qualification for the team."" Messi's second of the night was his 100th in the Champions League, coming after 123 games, 14 fewer than it took Cristiano Ronaldo to reach the same mark. He now has 541 goals in 625 Barcelona appearances and 37 in 46 this season. ""I never thought I would see a better player than Diego Maradona,"" former Barcelona striker Gary Lineker said on BT Sport. ""He's the best dribbler I've ever seen, the best passer I've ever seen and he scores more goals than anyone I've ever seen."" But with Messi, there is a need to look at what is left as well as what has already been and the 30-year-old might consider this season a prime opportunity to bolster what is his, relatively, light Champions League haul. Since his first in 2006, Messi has clinched three more, but only one since 2011. His total of four Champions League triumphs puts him on a par with the likes of Ronaldo, Gerard Pique, Andres Iniesta, Xavi, Samuel Eto'o and Clarence Seedorf. No player has yet managed to win five. If the current era is to be remembered in the shade of blue and red stripes, Barcelona and Messi might therefore feel there is work still to be done. Barca own a meagre five European crowns to Real's 12, with the Catalans' deficit extended in recent years rather than cut. And then there is the World Cup, Messi's holy grail. Four years ago in Brazil, he was named player of the tournament but in the final, against Germany, he flashed wide of the far post with only Manuel Neuer to beat and the score goalless in the second half. Germany went on to win 1-0. Messi will want to put that right in Russia, where he can collect the last major honour to have eluded him and silence those that maintain his career will always carry an asterisk until he does. ""We are delighted that Messi's form gives us the chance to dream,"" Argentina coach Jorge Sampaoli said on Thursday, ahead of upcoming friendlies against Italy and Spain. ""With the great patch that Messi is going through, with the World Cup coming soon, the dream is to take advantage of it and for the team to achieve a connection with him."" Messi will be 31 this summer, 35 by the time the next World Cup concludes in Qatar, and no-one would bet against him being there too. But these next few months would appear to offer a rare chance to break new ground."
471,15/03/2018,02:13,Magical Messi will never leave Barcelona - Conte,Antonio Conte said he believed Lionel Messi will remain at Barcelona for the rest of his playing days after watching the Argentine maestro destroy Chelsea's Champions League hopes.,"Messi, 30, scored twice and set up a goal for Ousmane Dembele as Barca beat Chelsea 3-0 at the Camp Nou on Wednesday for a 4-1 aggregate triumph. The double took Messi to 100 Champions League goals while his opener, coming after 129 seconds, was the fastest goal of his illustrious career. Messi has frequently been linked with a big-money move to the Premier League but Conte is convinced the striker will retire at Barcelona. ""I think Leo wants to stay until the end of his career with Barcelona,"" Conte said. ""We're talking about an impossible situation. I repeat: we must have great respect for this player. We are talking about a fantastic player. ""I think he wants to stay in Barcelona for the end of his career. I think it's the right way for him. He's writing with his team-mates a great story with Barcelona."" After full-time, Conte left the field with a congratulatory arm around Messi's shoulder but Chelsea had chances too, most notably through Marcos Alonso and Antonio Rudiger, who both hit the woodwork. Alonso also thought he should have been awarded a penalty in the second half after he went down under the challenge of Gerard Pique. Chelsea striker Olivier Giroud believes his team deserved more. ""Obviously on both matches I regret the posts or bars that we could have. You have to have some success, a little luck,"" Giroud said. ""What will stick in the throat is the penalty not given where it is quite obvious that Marcos is pushed in the back or he would have at least tried to shoot. It's very hard, I think it would have changed the game."" Messi, however, once again proved the difference, applying two clinical finishes through Thibaut Courtois's legs and, in between, teeing up Dembele to score his first Barcelona goal. ""He knows in certain moments stars have to come out. He forces himself to do that,"" Barcelona coach Ernesto Valverde said. ""There's no guarantee that he's going to score, but he is a fantastic player. We enjoy him. We're lucky enough to be seeing something that will go down in history."" Off the field, however, Barcelona may face questions from UEFA about the treatment of spectators before the game outside the stadium. Chelsea have invited any fans who experienced problems to contact the club. A Chelsea spokesman said: ""We are aware of reports of incidents outside the ground before the game where a number of Chelsea fans were hurt. ""We ask that our supporters contact us with accounts of their experiences of this evening's arrival at the stadium so that we can take this up properly with the authorities."""

He had already put Barcelona ahead after just three minutes, beating Chelsea goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois at his near post with Ousmane Dembele adding the second on 20 minutes after being set up by Messi. Barcelona join Real Madrid, Sevilla, Manchester City, Liverpool, Juventus, Roma and Bayern Munich in Friday's quarter-final draw."
473,13/03/2018,20:01,"Hazard should aim to copy ""genius"" Iniesta - Conte","Chelsea manager Antonio Conte has described Barcelona's Andres Iniesta as a ""genius"" and challenged Eden Hazard to emulate the Spaniard by winning major trophies.","Iniesta faces a race against time to be fit for Wednesday's Champions League clash at the Camp Nou, with the tie delicately poised following a 1-1 draw in the first leg. The midfielder has been included in the squad after recovering from a hamstring injury and his return would represent a major boost to Barca's hopes. Conte said Chelsea would have to play the ""perfect game"" to reach the quarter-finals and they will need Hazard to deliver too. Hazard has grown frustrated in recent weeks with his lone role up front but when asked to compare the Belgian with Iniesta, Conte said: ""We're talking about two different players with different careers. Iniesta won a lot in his career, Hazard has to start winning important trophies."" On the impact of Iniesta's possible return, Conte added: ""I like to compare him with Andrea Pirlo. We are talking about a genius of the football. ""I don't know if tomorrow he could play. In this type of game it's right to face the best players and you don't hope they will miss out with injury."" Chelsea were unfortunate only to take a draw from the first leg at Stamford Bridge, where Lionel Messi's equaliser spoiled an otherwise dominant Blues performance. But Barca are still unbeaten in La Liga and Messi will be well-rested, having sat out Saturday's win over Malaga to attend the birth of his third child. ""We must have the game to play with concentration, stay with our head in every moment,"" Conte said. ""We have to know there are moments we have to suffer because that is not only for Chelsea but every team against Barcelona must be ready to suffer and be compact. ""With the ball you must then have in your head and your heart the feeling you will have the chance to score."" Conte said Antonio Rudiger is in contention after recovering from muscle fatigue but Ross Barkley (hamstring) and David Luiz (ankle) are out."
474,13/03/2018,17:49,Barca will make late call on Iniesta before Chelsea - Valverde,"Barcelona will make a late decision on whether captain Andres Iniesta is fit to face Chelsea in the Champions League on Wednesday, coach Ernesto Valverde has confirmed.","Iniesta sustained a hamstring injury against Atletico Madrid on March 4 but the midfielder took part in a light training session on Monday ahead of the last-16 second leg at the Camp Nou. The first leg finished 1-1. ""It's clear when a match like this arrives, a player tends to risk,"" Valverde said on Tuesday. ""What we have to decide is whether the risk is excessive."" Iniesta could be replaced by Paulinho in the starting line-up but the Spaniard's absence would represent a major blow to his team's hopes of reaching the quarter-finals. ""We know what Andres brings to the team, not only on the pitch but as a captain,"" Barcelona midfielder Sergio Busquets said. ""You give him the ball and he always knows what he has to do to create chances. Everything that he contributes is postive. He is training and we hope he plays."" Lionel Messi, however, is available again, after the Argentinian missed Saturday's win at Malaga to attend the birth of his son, Ciro. ""He will be fine,"" Busquets said. ""In fact he will be more motivated than what we are used to and physically he is going to be great, after having an extra game's rest. I hope that this is perfect."" Busquets was also asked whether he thought Messi, who scored his team's crucial away goal at Stamford Bridge, would ever leave Barcelona and move to the Premier League. ""He is at home here,"" Busquets said. ""He has a great changing room, he is winning titles, has a great project, is winning collective and individual awards. ""In the end all these positive things are difficult to find elsewhere, so the Premier League is a league that maybe you would like to play in but if you have to balance the positive and the negative out of here, it is very difficult to leave."""
475,13/03/2018,09:54,Chinese club threatens legal action over Iniesta speculation,Tianjin Quanjian have threatened legal action in a bid to stamp out speculation that Barcelona captain Andres Iniesta will soon be joining the Chinese club.,"The 33-year-old Spain midfielder has been linked with a summer move to the Chinese Super League (CSL), which has attracted a number of big-name foreign players. Veteran defender Javier Mascherano left Barcelona in January for Hebei China Fortune, joining the likes of the Brazilians Hulk and Oscar in the CSL. But Tianjin moved to quash the rumours about Iniesta, issuing a statement saying: ""Our club solemnly state that such news reports are false."" ""For all false reports about our club, we reserve the right to solve it through legal means,"" the statement said. Barcelona daily Sport said last month that Iniesta, who will be 34 in May, had been offered 35 million euros a season to switch to Tianjin. Iniesta, scorer of the winning goal for Spain in the 2010 World Cup final, signed a ""lifetime contract"" with Barca last October. However, Barca's January signing of Philippe Coutinho from Liverpool in a 160-million-euro deal suggested they are planning for a future without the veteran. Ambitious Tianjin already have Brazilian forward Pato and Belgian international midfielder Axel Witsel on their books. They were previously linked with striker Diego Costa, who is now at Atletico Madrid after leaving Chelsea."
476,13/03/2018,01:45,Conte's caution fails to harness best of Hazard,Chelsea manager Antonio Conte faces a conundrum of balancing his tendency for caution with the English champions' need to score to get past the might of Barcelona in the Champions League last 16 on Wednesday.,"Conte's plan to contain and counter-attack on the La Liga leaders nearly worked to perfection in the first leg three weeks ago as Willian put the hosts in front and also hit the woodwork twice. But one Andreas Christensen error cost Conte's men dear as Barca pounced for a vital away goal when Andres Iniesta set up Lionel Messi to finally net against Chelsea at the ninth attempt and give Barca the upper hand from a 1-1 draw. However, whilst Willian shone in Conte's strikerless set-up, Eden Hazard was unable to exert the influence he desires on the biggest stage in an unfamiliar centre-forward role. ""We need to repeat the game we played at Stamford Bridge and to try to exploit the chances to score,"" Conte told Chelsea TV following Saturday's 2-1 win over Crystal Palace, hinting that he will opt for a similar approach at the Camp Nou. ""It's important to understand that we must be prepared to suffer, if we play with Hazard as number nine, or if we play with (Olivier) Giroud or (Alvaro) Morata as number nine and Hazard as number 10."" Hazard certainly suffered when deployed once more in a central role as Chelsea were passed off the park by Manchester City in a 1-0 defeat nine days ago. ""When you leave the pitch you have the impression that you've ran [a lot], but that you haven't played a game of football,"" said Hazard as City recorded a Premier League record 902 passes and Chelsea failed to muster a single shot on goal. ""We could have played on for three hours, and I wouldn't touch a ball. ""For me personally it's difficult to play a good game when you only touch the ball three times."" The root of Hazard's discontent is Conte's lack of faith in either club record singing Morata or Giroud, who was hastily recruited on the final day of the January transfer window as a more physical option. Hazard's best displays throughout his Chelsea career have come when playing off a focal point, most notably in two Premier League title winning seasons alongside Diego Costa. A fallout with Conte meant Costa was hastily dispatched by the Italian at the end of last season despite playing a huge role in delivering the title. Morata was bought to replace his Spanish international team-mate and initially struck up an excellent relationship with Hazard. However, an alarming dip in form allied to injury problems has seen Morata make just one start in two months and fail to score since Boxing Day. Likewise, Giroud has made just three starts and scored one goal since crossing London to join from Arsenal. On the eve of the first leg, Hazard welcomed comparisons to five-time Ballon d'Or winners Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo, but admitted he had to produce far more on a consistent basis in the Champions League to justify such comparisons. ""If you want to be one of the best, you have to play well in the big games,"" said the Belgian, whose contract expires in 2020. But after Conte claimed playing in a more open style against City and Barcelona would be ""stupid"" given their superior quality, Hazard may be forgiven for wondering if he can realise his ambitions at Stamford Bridge should Chelsea fail to make the quarter-finals for a fourth straight season."
477,11/03/2018,15:05,Barcelona agree option to buy Brazilian star Arthur,"Barcelona have reached agreement with Brazilian club Gremio to sign Arthur, a 21-year old midfielder.","The Spanish club said in a statement on Sunday that they can activate an option to sign Arthur in July by paying a basic 30 million euros ($36.9mn) plus 9mn in add ons. Earlier Spanish media reports had suggested Arthur would join next winter, after the South American campaign. The deal follows a sustained courtship Arthur helped propel Gremio to the final of the Copa Libertadores last year and was impressive as they beat Lanus of Argentina, 3-1, on aggregate in the final. He did not finish the second leg, limping off in the second half with a torn ankle ligament. The injury meant Arthur missed the Club World Cup in December. He will join compatriots Coutinho and Paulinho in the Barcelona midfield."
478,11/03/2018,00:07,Barcelona stroll past Malaga without Messi,Lionel Messi was away attending the birth of his son but Barcelona still had more than enough to beat 10-man Malaga 2-0 on Saturday and move 11 points clear at the top of La Liga.,"Messi was watching the game on a television in hospital as Luis Suarez and Philippe Coutinho put his team two up inside half an hour at La Rosaleda, before Samuel Garcia was sent off in the 30th minute for a dangerous tackle on Jordi Alba. Down a man and without a win in 12 matches, Malaga might have feared a rout but Barca settled for a straightforward victory, perhaps with one eye on Wednesday's Champions League last-16 clash against Chelsea. On Messi's withdrawal, Barcelona coach Ernesto Valverde said: ""I found out this (Saturday) morning, before leaving home, I had already been called by the delegate of the club and he had told me the circumstances surrounding Leo. ""We already more or less knew when it might happen. It wasn't very difficult to replace him because I had a clear idea of how the game would go."" Messi is expected back against Chelsea at the Camp Nou, where the score is 1-1 from the first leg, but Valverde will have been delighted with how his attackers filled the void, as Suarez, Coutinho and Ousmane Dembele all delivered excellent displays. In particular, Dembele's brilliant turn and pass was bettered only by Coutinho's flicked finish for what was a superb second goal. ""He has that ability,"" Valverde said of Dembele. ""Today I think had more success than at other times, but the good thing is that he always goes at the opponent, always challenges them, always tries to dribble, and we need people like that."" The win means Barca extend their advantage over second-placed Atletico Madrid, who can pull the deficit back to eight points with a win over Celta Vigo on Sunday. Malaga, meanwhile, remain rooted to the bottom of the table. Earlier on Saturday, Zinedine Zidane labelled Cristiano Ronaldo as ""from another galaxy"" after the striker's double dragged Real Madrid to a 2-1 win over Eibar. Ronaldo headed in an 84th-minute winner at Ipurua, having earlier put Real in front with an emphatic near-post finish. Eibar's Ivan Ramis had equalised in between to give the home side hope. But Ronaldo's two goals mean he has now scored in seven consecutive games and boasts a remarkable 13 goals overall in that period. The 33-year-old's tally for club and country this season stands at 35 goals in 37 appearances. ""For me he's from another galaxy,"" Real coach Zidane said. ""He knows that he will score. He is a different, special player. The statistics speak for themselves."" Real move four points behind second-placed Atletico Madrid, while Eibar stay eighth. Gareth Bale started up front alongside the Portuguese, while Luka Modric and Toni Kroos, fit enough only to come off the bench in midweek, returned. Modric was excellent throughout, the Croatian providing a sublime pass with the outside of his foot for Ronaldo's opener. ""It's true that after 15, almost 20 days, Luka came in and played a great game,"" Zidane said. ""He is an important player for us and what he did, he did very well."" Valencia remain a point behind Real and all but ended Sevilla's hopes of finishing in the top four by beating Vincenzo Montella's men 2-0. Sevilla trailed Valencia by eight points before kick-off but that gap was stretched to 11 after two goals from Rodrigo Moreno sealed a comfortable victory."

481,09/03/2018,18:20,Valverde dismisses talk of Neymar returning to Barca,"Barcelona coach Ernesto Valverde has dismissed reports suggesting Neymar could leave Paris Saint-Germain and return to the Catalan giant as ""fantasy"".","In the same week that PSG crashed out of the Champions League, and only seven months after he joined the club for a world record 222million euros ($264 million), Neymar´s future has grown uncertain. Spanish sports newspaper Mundo Deportivo claims the Brazilian, recovering from surgery on a broken foot in Brazil, has made contact with Barca to ask how he can engineer a return. The article adds Neymar has explained he made a mistake in leaving the club, was wrong to want independence from Lionel Messi and has been disappointed by the standard of opposition in Ligue 1. Asked about the reports on Friday, Valverde said: ""It seems to me a fantasy and we do not know where it came from or where it will end. ""It is a fantasy and we are not going to speak about rumours when we know it would not end here."" Barca, however, is not the only club Neymar is reportedly targeting as a potential way out of PSG. Madrid-based newspaper AS reports Neymar´s father has met with Real Madrid, who are ready to pay 400million euros to sign the striker. Real coach Zinedine Zidane said on Friday: ""Neymar could play in all the clubs because he is very good, like many players. ""I´m not going to talk about a player that is not mine. On the 400 million, they paid 220 million and when they bought me they paid 72. ""It seemed crazy to me and 10 years later they are paying 220 million. It may well be that in the next 10 years someone will pay 400m, or sooner, I do not know."" Mundo Deportivo concedes Neymar´s courting of Barcelona may even be a tactic to justify a move to Real, given the Catalan club are likely to reject any chance to re-sign the 26-year-old. Barcelona are still embroiled in a financial dispute over a bonus due to Neymar last summer, which the club cancelled when they believe it became clear he was moving to PSG. Neymar missed PSG's last 16 loss to Real on Tuesday after undergoing surgery on a broken foot in Brazil last week."

483,09/03/2018,12:40,Barca visit bottom club Malaga with Chelsea firmly in mind,Barcelona enjoy breathing space again at the top of La Liga and Ernesto Valverde can afford to keep one eye on Chelsea when his side visit bottom club Malaga on Saturday.,"While the Catalans´ 1-0 win against Atletico Madrid last weekend extended the gap at the summit to eight points, their advantage over Chelsea in the Champions League is more precarious. Barca take a 1-1 draw, and an away goal, to the Camp Nou on Wednesday but Chelsea controlled much of the first leg in London and will fancy their chances of an upset. With Andres Iniesta already nursing a hamstring injury and Denis Suarez out with a groin strain, Valverde will be wary of further damage against a Malaga side without a victory in 15 attempts. It means key players are likely to be rested and others given the opportunity to stake a claim, particularly in attack, where the third spot next to Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez is yet to be established. Ousmane Dembele has endured a difficult debut season, plagued by problems with fitness and form, but the forward has shown signs of improvement and played in the Catalan Super Cup win over Espanyol on Wednesday. ""He tried to get involved in play and has worked on individual moves,"" Valverde said. ""This is useful, little by little, we hope he translates it into La Liga games."" Dembele is jostling for position with the creative Philippe Coutinho, preferred against Atletico, and Paulinho, who offers the most defensive resilience from the front. Anything but a comfortable win at La Rosaleda Stadium would represent a major shock. Malaga were, in fact, the last team to beat Barcelona in La Liga, with a 2-0 victory in April, but few players from that triumph are still at the club while the coach, Michel, was sacked in January. His replacement, Jose Gonzalez, has overseen six defeats in a row. It means Atletico will hold little hope of their deficit being cut this weekend but the challenge for Diego Simeone´s men is to stay in touch by beating ninth-placed Celta Vigo on Sunday. A 3-0 thrashing of Lokomotiv Moscow in the Europa League on Thursday has already recovered the winning feeling, with Atletico registering eight victories on the bounce before they were halted by Messi´s 25-yard free-kick. After the win over Lokomotiv, Simeone was asked about taking charge at Paris Saint-Germain next season and he indicated his focus by replying: ""Celta."" Real Madrid, meanwhile, swap Paris Saint-Germain and the Parc des Princes for Eibar and the Ipurua Municipal Stadium, the smallest stadium in La Liga with a capacity of just over 7,000. Zinedine Zidane´s team will be flying high after overcoming the biggest assignment of their season in Paris and, like Barcelona, it may be that star players are given time off. Gareth Bale is unlikely to be among those rested, however, after the Welshman missed out on the starting line-up against PSG. Bale´s reaction this weekend will be significant. Elsewhere on Saturday, Sevilla host Valencia, needing a victory to reignite their hopes of qualifying for the Champions League. Los Rojiblancos sit fifth in the table, eight points behind Valencia, knowing anything but a win this weekend would all-but end their top-four hopes."
484,06/03/2018,18:01,"Man City can't compare to Barca, Madrid yet - Guardiola","Manchester City can't yet consider themselves the equal of Barcelona or Real Madrid, City manager Pep Guardiola has insisted despite a stunning season that has seen his side installed as Champions League favourites.","The runaway Premier League leaders will secure their place in the last eight of the Champions League for just the second time in their history barring a remarkable last 16, second leg collapse when they host Basel on Wednesday, boasting a 4-0 first leg lead. Guardiola sees City's status as favourites ahead of former clubs Barcelona and Bayern Munich, and holders Real Madrid as a testament to their form this season. ""When I am talking about we are favourites to win the Champions League, it's an honour,"" Guardiola said on Tuesday. ""If you don't play good at Manchester City... the people are not going to say that because we don't have (a) legacy."" However, Guardiola, who won the Champions League twice in a glorious four-year spell at Barcelona, believes the experience of the two Spanish giants in Europe's premier club competition gives them an upper hand. Madrid and Barca have combined to win the Champions League for the past four years, and Guardiola cited Madrid's 3-1 win over Paris Saint-Germain in the first leg of their blockbuster last 16 clash as evidence of why league form can count for little in European competition. ""Before the first game against PSG people said 'Madrid is not good, PSG is going to win, is a top team' and Madrid win 3-1 because Madrid has 12 Champions Leagues and it is a lot. ""It is a different competition, it is moments. Tomorrow we have the chance to be in quarter-finals for the second time in our history and that is so important."" City won their first trophy of Guardiola's reign in charge by beating Arsenal in the League Cup final nine days ago, and seem destined to add the Premier League title as they hold a 16-point lead at the top of the table. However, the Catalan coach rejected suggestions he is building a dynasty like he did at Barcelona. ""It's not good for us comparing with that team because that team dominate the last decade with different managers and different players. They won a lot, a lot of things. ""We won just the first title so to be or think about joining this kind of team you have to be there a long, long time and a long time means many years."" Midfielder Ilkay Gundogan scored twice in City's stroll past Basel in the first leg in Switzerland three weeks ago. However, the German, who reached the Champions League final with Borussia Dortmund in 2013, also stressed City can't get ahead of themselves with tougher tests to come from the quarter-finals on. ""I think the results of the last games, it doesn't matter if in the Champions League, Premier League or other competitions because they were quite good, so a lot of people try to see us at the same level as Barca, Real Madrid or Bayern Munich, but we still feel like we need to compete with them. ""We are not there yet. We are on a very good way and, if we have to play one day against them, we want to be ready."""

Griezmann has been in sparkling form in recent weeks. The Frenchman has scored seven goals in his last two matches and 12 in his last nine. ""Antoine is an extraordinary footballer and when he is at his level like this, he is one of the best, and it is clear that in his present position he is in the perfect place,"" Simeone said on Saturday. ""Except for the five months when he joined and the beginning of this season, he has always been very consistent and to be consistent in football is very difficult. ""Lionel Messi, Cristiano Ronaldo, they become what they are by having continuity, they do not get tired of scoring goals, they do not get tired of winning titles, and this is the goal of those who are pushing to get closer to this place."" Atletico against Barcelona has been billed as a battle between Griezmann and Messi, who himself has 34 goals already this season. Simeone admitted there is no plan that can fully contain the Argentinian forward. ""Having a footballer like Lionel, who is in an extraordinary moment, it is clear that there is no strategy that can control something that we all want to control,"" Simeone said. ""It is impossible because what he has is something natural."" For Barcelona, the challenge is to regain momentum and confidence, following Thursday's 1-1 draw at Las Palmas. Ernesto Valverde's men looked uncatchable when they pulled 11 points clear at the top in January but a patchy run of form has given Atletico hope. ""It is a situation where we have to live with this intention and give everything to win the game, because the prize is very juicy, for us to be ahead of second by eight points,"" Valverde said. ""In this we have to focus. They will also think: 'we can get to two'. If we draw everything remains the same, but whoever wins makes an important jump."""

Atletico thrashed Leganes 4-0 on Wednesday night. Lionel Messi's brilliant free-kick looked set to restore their advantage to seven points ahead of this weekend's showdown at the Camp Nou but two decisions from referee Antonio Mateu helped lowly Las Palmas take a share of the spoils. First, Mateu overlooked a handball from goalkeeper Leandro Chichizola outside the box, which could have drawn a red card, and then he awarded a penalty when the ball struck Lucas Digne on the arm. Former West Ham striker Jonathan Calleri made no mistake. Barcelona will feel hard done by given Digne's handball looked entirely accidental, with Gerard Pique on the pitch after the final whistle venting his anger at the officials. ""We do not know what happened in this play,"" Valverde said afterwards. ""From the field I found it unspeakable, but these are things that happen."" Even after Calleri's equaliser, however, the visitors had 42 minutes to find a winner and, in truth, they created little. The question now is whether three days is enough for Barcelona to recover, physically and mentally, before facing an Atletico team hunting their ninth win on the bounce. ""The match comes fast,"" Valverde said. ""But that's how it is. There remains a bad taste, after not winning here when we thought we could have done."" Valverde had already lamented the scheduling this week but Luis Suarez started, despite sitting one yellow card away from a suspension, which he successfully avoided. It is hard to think of two better players than Messi and Suarez in a two against one but the former's final pass to the latter was underhit and the first big chance of the game was lost. Messi seemed determined to atone for his error and in the 21st minute he won a free-kick after another irrepressible run to the edge of the box. The Argentinian planted the ball left-footed into the top right-hand corner. The first controversy came on the stroke of half-time as Chichizola came rushing out of his area but, after skewing his clearance, the keeper quickly stopped the ball with his hand. Mateu blew only for the interval. Any sense of injustice was then doubled three minutes after the break, when Mateu awarded Las Palmas their penalty. Barca failed to clear a cross into their box and as the ball cannoned off the back post, it struck the oblivious Digne on the arm. Calleri coolly dispatched the spot-kick. On came the extra firepower, as Philippe Coutinho and Ousmane Dembele replaced Aleix Vidal and Andres Iniesta but Barca rarely troubled Las Palmas in the latter stages. They must improve on Sunday."

The first controversy came on the stroke of half-time as Chichizola came rushing out of his area but, after skewing his clearance, the keeper quickly stopped the ball with his hand. Mateu blew only for the interval. Any sense of injustice was then doubled three minutes after the break, when Mateu awarded Las Palmas their penalty. Barca failed to clear a cross into their box and as the ball cannoned off the back post, it struck the oblivious Digne on the arm. Calleri coolly dispatched the spot-kick. On came the extra firepower, as Philippe Coutinho and Ousmane Dembele replaced Aleix Vidal and Andres Iniesta but Barca rarely troubled Las Palmas in the latter stages. They must improve on Sunday."
488,25/02/2018,14:00,Barcelona defender Nelson Semedo to miss five weeks,Barcelona said on Sunday that Portuguese defender Nelson Semedo will be out for five weeks with an injury he picked up in Saturday's 6-1 win over Girona.,"The club said the player had damaged a muscle in his left thigh. If Semedo is out until the end of March, he will miss at least six matches, including the Spanish league encounter with second-place Atletico Madrid next Saturday and the second leg of the Champions League tie with Chelsea on March 14. Semedo, a 24-year-old fullback, joined from Benfica for a reported fee of 30 million euros ($37 million) last summer and has appeared in 26 games for Barcelona, starting 20."
489,25/02/2018,00:10,"Messi never fails to surprise us, says Barcelona coach","Barcelona coach Ernesto Valverde admitted Saturday that Lionel Messi never fails to surprise him as the Argentine maestro scored twice, including a cheeky free-kick, in the 6-1 comeback win over Girona.","The La Liga leaders overcame going a goal down to cruise to a victory which gave them a 10-point advantage at the top with a Luis Suarez hat-trick and debut league goal for Philippe Coutinho ensuring the three points. ""It's difficult to get used to, especially because we're talking about a player about whom we say we've seen it all, but Messi always surprises you,"" said Valverde. Messi, who now has 30 goals in all competitions this season, had Valverde reaching for the superlatives for his free-kick which bamboozled Girona when he coaxed the ball along the floor instead of over the top and into the net. ""We all expected to see how he would get it over the wall but he hits it under. You see it and you think it's easy. Leo just makes it look easy, but it's not that easy,"" said the coach. The match was also special for Messi from a personal point of view as it was the first since the death of his maternal grandfather at home in Rosario in Argentina."
490,24/02/2018,22:26,Coutinho scores first Barcelona league goal,Philippe Coutinho scored his first La Liga goal for Barcelona on Saturday in their game against Girona at the Camp Nou.,"The 25-year-old Brazilian, who joined from Liverpool for 160 million euros ($192 million euros) last month, cut inside in the 66th minute before bending a magnificent shot into the far corner from the edge of the box to put Barca 5-1 ahead. It was Coutinho's second goal for the club after getting off the mark in the Copa del Rey win over Valencia earlier this month."
491,24/02/2018,15:43,Rafinha hoping to make Inter move permanent,Brazil midfielder Rafinha said Saturday he wants to make his loan move to Inter Milan permanent this summer after taking advice from Barcelona stars Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez before leaving Spain.,"The 25-year-old -- who was out eight months last year with a knee injury -- is on six months loan from Barca and Inter have an option to buy for a reported 35 million euro ($43 million). ""Leo Messi, Luis Suarez and others all told me that I was going to a big world class club with a lot of history behind it,"" Rafinha told Gazzetta Dello Sport. ""I was going crazy thinking about (Brazil's) Ronaldo and Adriano (when they were at Inter). ""I was already enchanted by the San Siro when empty, but with the fans in there too, it's a unique stadium."" Despite making just four appearances off the bench so far Rafinha said he was progressing at his own pace and looking forward to the Milan derby next weekend. ""Certain little pains are normal after months out of action. (Coach) Luciano Spalletti's idea of using me as a substitute for the moment is very intelligent. I do feel ready to start if needed and if he asks, I will be up for that. ""The Milan Derby is a game the whole world talks about, it's on the same level as Barcelona-Real Madrid or River Plate-Boca Juniors."" ""I want to continue here next season,"" he continued. ""I see myself staying at Inter, because I didn't just come here thinking to recover my form and then return to Barcelona. Of course, then obviously my future depends on what Inter decide."" Rafinha is no stranger to Italy, as his father is Mazinho, who played for Lecce and Fiorentina in the early 1990s. ""My father confirmed to me that there are a lot of tactics in this tournament. It's like a university of football."" Rafinha knows Inter captain Mauro Icardi from their time in Barcelona's youth academy and now wants to contribute to the three-time European champions' return to the Champions League. ""We've got everything it takes to achieve a Champions League spot,"" he added despite Inter's recent struggles which have seen them slump to fifth in Serie A. Rafinha -- whose older brother Thiago plays for Bayern Munich and the Spanish national side -- joined Barcelona aged 13 and rose through the ranks. He has scored one goal in two games for Brazil but injuries blighted his Barca first team chances."

Mundo Deportivo claimed Barca director of football Robert Fernandez went to Porto Alegre ""to seal the transfer of Arthur, with whom the club have reached a deal starting from January 2019"". The 21-year-old is expected to arrive during next season's winter transfer window, although Madrid-based Marca suggested he could join the club this summer if Barca reduce the number of non-EU players in their squad. Arthur starred in last year's Copa Libertadores final as Gremio defeated Lanus of Argentina 3-1 on aggregate to claim the title for a third time. But a leaked photograph of Fernandez alongside the Brazilian in a Barca shirt sparked controversy with the player still under contract at Gremio."
493,21/02/2018,12:28,Willian confident of Champions League progress despite Messi magic,Chelsea's Willian is confident Antonio Conte's side can pull off a shock win in Barcelona after he came close to upstaging Argentine superstar Lionel Messi in their Champions League clash at Stamford Bridge.,"Nine years on from a hugely controversial semi-final between the clubs, Andres Iniesta and Messi combined once more to ensure the Catalans ended the first leg of the last-16 tie the happier of the two sides with a 1-1 draw. This time roles were reversed for Barca's two all-time greats, with Iniesta providing the pass for Messi to score his first goal in nine attempts against Chelsea after pouncing on a mistake from 21-year-old centre-back Andreas Christensen. It is not as fatal a blow as when Iniesta fired a late goal into the top corner from Messi's calm cut-back in 2009 in a match that famously saw the hosts have four penalty appeals waved away by Norwegian referee Tom Henning Ovrebo. But Conte says his side will need to do ""something incredible"" in Catalonia in three weeks' time to progress. The Italian was left to rue a case of what might have been. His tactical plan to sit deep, cede possession and hit Barca with the pace of goalscorer Willian, Eden Hazard and Pedro Rodriguez worked a treat for 75 minutes. Despite flashes of brilliance, in particular when one slaloming first-half run left Antonio Rudiger tackling thin air, there was always one Chelsea body too many between Messi and the goal for the Argentine to get through. Barca midfielder Ivan Rakitic compared Chelsea's tactics to a handball team, huddled around the edge of their area. But Messi had the final word as Barcelona capitalised on a rare Chelsea defensive error, scoring his first goal against the west Londoners to equalise Willian's second-half goal with 15 minutes to go. Hazard had spoken on the eve of the game about having to do more in Europe's premier club competition to justify comparisons with the five-time World Player of the Year and his eternal Real Madrid rival Cristiano Ronaldo. Instead, it was Willian who shone brightest. The Brazilian sent Barca two huge warnings before the break of his threat from range as he beat Marc-Andre ter Stegen to his right and then his left, only to see both efforts come back off the post. He finally broke the deadlock in the 62nd minute, arrowing a low shot past the Barcelona goalkeeper following a short corner. Willian saw enough in Chelsea's performance at Stamford Bridge to suggest they can upset the odds in the second leg. ""In a difficult game we played very well,"" he told the club's website. ""We had to stay compact, we had a plan and we did exactly as we expected. ""They had the ball and we expected to counter-attack, and we could win this game. But we did not and the result is still open, we have to go there and try to win. ""Barcelona had more possession but they did not create more dangerous chances to score. We can go there and make the game. ""To play in the Nou Camp is totally different and we have go there with the same mentality and try to win the game."" Conte gave a glowing assessment of the 29-year-old Brazilian's performance. ""Willian has the potential to play this type of game in any game. I hope that to see this type of performance for a long time,"" said Conte of a player who has not always been first-choice this season. ""When you play this way, the coach doesn't have a doubt and you play."""
494,21/02/2018,01:30,Chelsea capable of the 'incredible' to spring Barca surprise - Conte,"Chelsea manager Antonio Conte believes the English champions can do ""something incredible"" by knocking Barcelona out of the Champions League at the Camp Nou on March 14, despite blowing a lead to draw the first leg of their last-16 tie 1-1.","Willian gave reason to a bold team selection from Conte on Tuesday by putting the English champions ahead just after the hour mark, having also hit the woodwork twice before half-time. However, Barca pounced on a very rare Chelsea mistake on the night as Andres Iniesta intercepted a slack pass by Andreas Christensen and squared for Lionel Messi to slot home his first goal in nine appearances against Chelsea. ""We must be realistic. We are talking about Barcelona. They show tonight to be a strong, fantastic team,"" said Conte. ""We have showed that if we are ready to work very hard together defensively, but continue to have the right feeling when you win the ball when you have the chance to score, we can try to do something incredible at the Nou Camp."" Conte named a front three without a recognised centre-forward with Willian and Pedro Rodriguez either side of Eden Hazard, while the 21-year-old Christensen started in place of club captain Gary Cahill. And Conte refused to pin the blame on the inexperienced Dane for conceding. ""I think it was a great performance, an incredible performance,"" added Conte. ""We're talking about a player he's only 21. It's great that he can play this game with this maturity. I am very happy. For me he was one of the best players tonight."" Barcelona enjoyed nearly 70 percent of the possession, but lacked the penetration to open up Chelsea's well-organised defence. ""At times it seemed like a handball match, because they sat back and waited,"" said Barca midfielder Ivan Rakitic. ""It is difficult when they have eight players behind the ball."" However, Conte defended his tactics, saying it would be ""crazy"" to approach facing Barcelona any other way. ""When you play against Barcelona you know very well that if you want to face them box-to-box then you are crazy and you go to lose the game, not 1-0, (but) 4, 5, 6-0,"" said Conte. ""You must play with intelligence, especially if you know that (Barca) level is up on us. You must play an intelligent game, we are not stupid."" Chelsea's former Barca midfielder Cesc Fabregas, though, stressed the importance of going to Catalonia in three weeks' time with attacking intent rather than just trying to keep Barcelona at bay for as long as possible. ""We have to go there to attack and score because 90 minutes defending at the Nou Camp is an eternity,"" said Fabregas, who played for Barca between 2011 and 2014. ""It is a suicide mission."" Messi's goal was the first a Barcelona player has scored in an away Champions League match for six games. And whilst Barca boss Ernesto Valverde welcomed the slight advantage gained from a sub-standard performance, he warned Chelsea possess the threat on the counter-attack to still land a knockout blow. ""It is very important to have scored here and logically both teams will respect their own style in the second leg. They have the attacking resources to cause us problems. ""It is important to have the advantage, but it is far from decided."""
495,20/02/2018,23:56,Messi ends Chelsea drought to give Barcelona last-16 edge,Chelsea manager Antonio Conte rued one costly mistake as Lionel Messi gave Barcelona the upper hand from the first leg of their Champions League last-16 tie by salvaging a 1-1 draw at Stamford Bridge.,"Messi struck for the first time in nine games against Chelsea 15 minutes from the end, as Andres Iniesta punished the English champions once more when he intercepted Andreas Christensen's slack pass across his own box to tee up the five-time World Player of the Year. Willian's fine strike just after the hour mark had put Chelsea in command after he had hit both posts in the first half. Chelsea must now score when they travel to the Camp Nou on March 14 to have any chance of making the last eight. ""Against this opponent, this type of player like Messi, (Luis) Suarez, Iniesta, if you make a mistake you pay,"" said Conte. ""There is a bit of disappointment. But at the same time this game must give us a lot of confidence to trust that in the second leg the qualification is open."" Nine years on from combining for a stoppage-time equaliser in a highly controversial semi-final at Stamford Bridge to send Barca to the final, Iniesta and Messi swapped roles as this time the Spaniard provided the pass and Messi the finish. ""We failed to create clear-cut chances despite having domination of the game. In the end it came from an error from them and we took advantage,"" said Barca coach Ernesto Valverde. ""It is a good score given we were behind and clearly there is everything left to decide in the second leg."" Conte sprang a surprise before kick-off by leaving out both Olivier Giroud and Alvaro Morata with Eden Hazard instead operating in the middle of a front three. And it was Hazard who sent the first warning that Barca were in for an uncomfortable evening when he fired just over from 20 yards five minutes in. Chelsea constantly tried to surround Messi with three or four blue shirts to limit the Argentine's threat, but he dug out a cross to the far post where an unmarked Paulinho headed Barca's best chance of the first-half wide. Barca then went on to dominate possession, but the visitors lacked penetration and were lucky to go in level at half-time. Willian scored twice from outside the box against Hull City in the FA Cup on Friday, and was inches away from another long-range stunner when he curled onto the post from 25 yards with Marc-Andre ter Stegen beaten in the Barca goal. Barca had kept six clean sheets in their previous seven Champions League games, but once again had good luck rather than good defending to thank four minutes before the break when Willian hooked another effort from outside the box off the woodwork. ""Willian could have had a hat-trick -- but we go home sad because a fantastic performance is not a fantastic result,"" Chelsea's former Barca midfielder Cesc Fabregas told BT Sport. ""We have to go there to attack and score because 90 minutes defending at the Nou Camp is an eternity, it is a suicide mission. We have to play our game."" Barca appeared to have restored order early in the second period, but failed to learn their lesson of Willian's danger from the edge of the box. A short corner was worked into the Brazilian's path and he arrowed a low shot past the rooted Ter Stegen. However, Barca remain unbeaten in 31 La Liga and Champions League games under Ernesto Valverde thanks to a late rally. Christensen's dangerous ball across his own box was a gift for an old scourge of Chelsea in Iniesta and Messi made no mistake by sweeping low past Thibaut Courtois for his 28th goal of the season."
496,19/02/2018,22:19,"More needed to justify Messi, Ronaldo comparisons - Hazard",Eden Hazard admitted he must show more on the Champions League stage for Chelsea if he is to justify comparisons to five-time Ballon d'Or winners Lionel Messi or Cristiano Ronaldo.,"Hazard goes head-to-head with Messi when Barcelona visit Stamford Bridge in the first leg of their last-16 clash on Tuesday. The Belgian has won Player of the Year awards for his part in leading Chelsea to two Premier League titles, but is yet to take Europe's premier club competition by storm. ""It's good to be compared with the greatest ever, Messi or Ronaldo,"" said Hazard. ""I try to do my job and try to reach their level, because they are the best in the world. ""Every season I try and do my best. When we play this kind of games, we need to perform. ""If you want to be one of the best, you have to play well in the big games. This is a big game."" Hazard has long been linked with a move to Barca's biggest rivals, Real Madrid. And whilst he insisted he remains happy in London, he refused to completely rule out a move to Spain. ""I have two years left on my contract. I'm happy here, my family is happy here,"" he added. ""I'm just focused on the game tomorrow and to the end of the season. I don't think much about the future because you never know what happens in the future."" Hazard, who is Chelsea's top scorer with 15 goals this season, was highlighted by Barca midfielder Ivan Rakitic as the biggest threat to the Catalans. ""For me he is,"" said the Croat when questioned whether Hazard is world class. ""He is maybe the most important player for Chelsea. ""We have to be ready tomorrow to stop him. He is really fast one against one, he is in really good form in his last games and we have to be ready for him."" However, Barca coach Ernesto Valverde pinpointed under-fire manager Antonio Conte as the English champions' biggest strength. Comfortable wins over West Brom and Hull in the past week have slightly eased the pressure on Conte, who has publicly clashed with Chelsea's hierarchy over recruitment this season. The real test, though, comes against a Barca side that are unbeaten in 30 games in La Liga and Champions League under Valverde. ""He is one of the best coaches in the world, with an incredible CV,"" said Valverde. ""Not just for winning the Premier League here with Chelsea but what he did at Juventus, (and) the (Italian) national team. ""His teams are very well-worked tactically, they know what to do in every moment of the game ""For me it is a challenge to face a team coached by him."" Conte, though, said he welcomed the pressure of the Champions League stage and the challenge of what he described as ""one of the best teams in the world"". ""If you want to compete at the maximum level, you have to live with this pressure. A team like Chelsea in every game must have the right pressure,"" said the Italian. ""If we want to stay at this level, the pressure must be your friend, not your enemy."" Messi has won just one and failed to score in eight previous meetings against Chelsea. Conte, though, admitted to still losing sleep over how to stop the Argentine. ""We are talking about the best player in the world,"" he added. ""Messi has the capacity to solve the situation and create a chance when you are not seeing the chance to score."""
497,19/02/2018,01:29,Barca visit presents Champions League stage Conte craves,Barcelona's visit to Chelsea on Tuesday gives Antonio Conte the perfect opportunity to reaffirm his stature as one of Europe's greatest coaches.,"""To play against Barcelona is a great challenge for us,"" Conte said after easing the pressure on his job with back-to-back home wins over West Brom and Hull in the past week. ""We must be excited to play this type of game, especially against this team. I consider Barcelona one of the best teams in the world."" Conte also considers himself one of the best coaches in the world, referring to himself despite a recent 4-1 drubbing at Watford as ""a winner."" He does so with some justification. In a glittering coaching career, Conte made Juventus title winners again with three consecutive Serie A titles after a five-year drought. He also surpassed expectations by leading an Italy side short on star names to the quarter-finals of Euro 2016, and delivered the Premier League in his debut season at Chelsea. However, a second season slump at the Bridge and his fractious relationship with the club's hierarchy means most believe the Italian won't last at Chelsea beyond the end of the season at the latest. Whether it is to convince Roman Abramovich and close aid Marina Granovskaia he should remain in charge next season or to attract the attention of Europe's other giants who may be looking for a coach come the summer, Conte needs Champions League nights to remember. His two years in the competition at Juventus ended in a 4-0 quarter-final aggregate thrashing from Bayern Munich and an embarrassing group stage exit behind Galatasaray. Conte complained then it was impossible for Italian sides to compete at the latter stages of the Champions League. It didn't help his case then that his successor Massimiliano Allegri then led Juve to two Champions League finals in three seasons. There have been similarities between Conte's final days at Juventus and many of his public outbursts against the Chelsea ownership this season over his lack of input over recruitment and how much is spent. ""I think I'm a bit of a disaster to convince the club to buy the players,"" Conte said last week. ""I have to speak more with the managers who are very, very good to persuade their clubs to spend money and buy top players."" Conte may then welcome his meeting with the more softly-spoken Ernesto Valverde this week. In Valverde's eight-month spell in charge, Barca have smashed their club record transfer fee twice for Ousmane Dembele and Philippe Coutinho. Yet, it is in a very different way that Conte may be able to learn from Valverde as neither Dembele or Coutinho have made much impact on Barca opening up a seven-point La Liga lead and booking their place in the Copa del Rey final. Instead, Valverde has made the best of what he inherited to turn Barca from the depths of a pre-season crisis into potential treble winners. Neymar's decision to walk out on the club for a world record 222 million euros to Paris Saint-Germain was a huge loss that Valverde has used as an opportunity to reconstruct a more solid side that maintains the firepower of Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez in attack. A change from Barca's traditional 4-3-3 to a 4-4-2 has seen them concede just once in their six Champions League games to date, and 11 times in 24 La Liga outings. Meanwhile, the space left unoccupied by Neymar has unleashed left-back Jordi Alba as an attacking threat. Alba was on target as Barca equalled a club record by avoiding defeat for a 31st straight La Liga game in a 2-0 win at Eibar on Saturday. Most of all, Valverde's calm has restored stability to a club that badly needed a steady hand after a tumultuous summer. That may be the lesson Conte and Chelsea can learn from most of all before careering towards another messy divorce at the end of the season."
498,18/02/2018,18:24,"Gameiro, Costa on target as Atletico keep up Barcelona chase",Kevin Gameiro came off the bench to score one goal and make another for Diego Costa as Atletico Madrid beat Athletic Bilbao 2-0 in La Liga on Sunday.,"It was another clinical performance from Diego Simeone's side, who have now recorded four consecutive league victories, all without their mean defence conceding a goal. They remain second, seven points behind unbeaten league leaders Barcelona, who won 2-0 at Eibar on Saturday ahead of their Champions League last 16, first leg away to Chelsea. Former Chelsea striker Costa returned for Atletico at the Wanda Metropolitano after injury prevented him from taking part in their 4-1 Europa League win over FC Copenhagen in Denmark on Thursday. Atletico created little in the first half to get the crowd of just over 60,000 out of their seats. However, they livened up after the restart, and in particular after Gameiro was sent on for Koke just before the hour mark. It was Atletico's French connection that led to the opening goal midway through the second half, with Antoine Griezmann setting up Gameiro, who took a touch before firing low past Kepa Arrizabalaga and into the far corner for his fifth league goal of the season. Gameiro then turned provider with a fine through ball for Costa, who fired home to secure the points with 10 minutes remaining, the goal his second in La Liga since returning to Spain. ""We are not stopping, we are playing well at the moment, and we are enjoying ourselves,"" said Gameiro when asked about his team's pursuit of Barcelona at the top of the table. Atletico, who have conceded a paltry nine goals in 24 La Liga games this season, will hope to stay within striking distance of Barcelona before going to the Camp Nou in a fortnight. Simeone's side are also nine points clear of third-placed Valencia, who came from behind to win 2-1 at bottom club Malaga on Saturday. Real Madrid, in fourth, are at Betis on Sunday evening. Earlier on Sunday, Real Sociedad beat struggling Levante 3-0 at Anoeta."
499,16/02/2018,18:59,Valverde hopeful Iniesta will stay at Barca amid China speculation,Barcelona coach Ernesto Valverde is hopeful Andres Iniesta will stay at Barcelona following reports his captain has offers on the table to move to China at the end of the season.,"""I can't comment on every story in every newspaper. This has not happened, and we want Andres to stay, to keep scoring and creating goals for us,"" Valverde said at a press conference on Friday ahead of the trip to Eibar in La Liga. Barcelona daily Sport claimed on Friday that Iniesta, 33, has an offer to join Tianjin Quanjian in the Chinese Super League worth as much as 35 million euros ($43.5 million) per season. Scorer of the winning goal for Spain in the 2010 World Cup final, Iniesta signed a ""lifetime contract"" with Barca last October. However, he will be 34 in May and Barca's move to sign Philippe Coutinho from Liverpool last month in a 160 million-euro deal indicated that they are planning for a future without him. Javier Mascherano left Barca at the end of January to join Chinese side Hebei China Fortune. Asked if he was worried about more of his players being tempted to accept mega-bucks offers from the Far East, Valverde said: ""At the moment it has only happened with Mascherano and I am not going to make myself go crazy thinking about these things before they have happened."" He added: ""We have not got time to think about these just now given all that we are playing for."" Barca face in-form Eibar at Ipurua on Saturday looking to continue their unbeaten record in La Liga this season and consolidate their lead at the top of the table, which is currently seven points over Atletico Madrid. The Catalans face Chelsea in the Champions League next Tuesday, but they come into the weekend fresh from a first free midweek in 2018. ""We have had a clear week and we needed that just to have a bit of a margin and get ready to go again,"" said Valverde, whose side have drawn their last two league outings against Espanyol and Getafe. ""After our draw the other day, tomorrow's match (Saturday) is even more important. ""We have not won anything yet. The season is going very well but it all depends on the dynamic. There is still a long way to go."" Valverde, who has Thomas Vermaelen back in training again, believes the fact that Chelsea were due to play their FA Cup tie against Hull City on Friday night gives them an advantage ahead of the Champions League last 16, first leg in London. ""Our tiredness has been mental more than physical, but this extra day that Chelsea have, from a physical point of view, gives them an advantage."" Asked if he would have liked the Eibar game to have been moved to Friday, he replied: ""I would have liked that."""
500,16/02/2018,02:05,Barcelona face tricky Eibar trip as Chelsea lie in wait,"Before their Champions League clash with Chelsea in London, Lionel Messi and Barcelona put their unbeaten record in La Liga on the line against Eibar in the rather less glamorous surrounds of Ipurua on Saturday.","The modest 7,000-seat ground in the Basque Country welcomes a Barca side who have laboured to draws against Espanyol and Getafe in their last two outings. Those results have allowed Atletico Madrid to cut Ernesto Valverde's side's lead at the top of the table to seven points, with the clubs due to meet at the Camp Nou early next month. Barca's advantage is still significant, and they have no major injury worries, but the danger is that the return of the Champions League is a distraction for them. ""We will need to proceed with caution because a bad result can mean that you suddenly go from having a very good year to not such a good one,"" Gerard Pique warned this week at a sponsor's event, where the talk was of Chelsea rather than Eibar. The Basque side, though, have lost just once -- a narrow 1-0 defeat to Atletico -- since the start of December, and are in contention to qualify for Europe. ""We have been playing well for the last two months and getting good results, but we know what we have in front of us on Saturday,"" warned their coach Jose Luis Mendilibar, once a colleague of Valverde's in their playing days. Atletico host Athletic Bilbao on Sunday and will be hoping to have Diego Costa back after the striker sat out the Europa League trip to Copenhagen. Real Madrid, meanwhile, travel to Seville to face Betis hoping to build on their fine Champions League win against Paris Saint-Germain. Zinedine Zidane's side are still fourth in the table behind Valencia -- who go to Malaga -- but they have taken 10 points from the last 12 available in the league. ""We have gone through a difficult phase, but in the last few weeks we have raised our game,"" Toni Kroos told German media after the PSG clash. ""I am confident that we have a lot of success ahead of us."" Real are 17 points adrift of Barcelona, but they do have a game in hand to come at Leganes next midweek. Sevilla, meanwhile, are in Gran Canaria to face Las Palmas, where they will again be without Ever Banega. Coach Vincenzo Montella will be hoping the Argentine playmaker can return for next week's Champions League clash with Manchester United. Aged 24, Loren has enjoyed a remarkable introduction to the elite. Promoted by Betis from their B team to the senior side, the forward netted twice in a win over Villarreal on his debut a fortnight ago and followed that by scoring the only goal in the victory at Deportivo last Monday. ""He is powerful, great one-on-one, and technically good,"" said Jose Juan Romero, who coached Loren in the reserves. ""He has had to tread through a lot of mud to get here."" Indeed, just three years ago, Loren was playing on some less desirable pitches in Spain's fourth tier. Born in Marbella, his journey to the top has not been a typical one. The son of a former Sevilla player, Loren even dreamt of doing something more stereotypically Andalusian. ""I wanted to be a bullfighter, but the first time I stood in front of a cow I decided that I had to stick to football,"" he told Cadena Cope. On Sunday, he comes up against Real Madrid."

The decision means that Atletico's home game with Betis in La Liga, scheduled for that weekend, will have to be moved. Barcelona's home game with Villarreal and the match between Sevilla and Real Madrid have already been moved from that weekend to Wednesday, May 9. Atletico's ground was the only realistic option to host the final, with Real Madrid never likely to agree to stage the game at their 81,000-capacity Santiago Bernabeu. Barcelona have won the Copa del Rey in each of the last three seasons and will be appearing in their fifth consecutive final. Next season's Champions League final will also be played at the Wanda Metropolitano."

In irresistible form in front of goal in 2018, Suarez had the ball in the net just before half-time with a great finish from a Lionel Messi free-kick, but the home celebrations were cut short by the offside flag. The Uruguayan striker then saw his header kept out by a brilliant Vicente Guaita save as the match moved into stoppage time, with Barca failing to score at home in La Liga for the first time since November 2016. Ernesto Valverde's side remain unbeaten in La Liga after 23 games, extending their longest run without losing from the start of a campaign. However, they are now only seven points clear at the summit from Atletico Madrid, who won 1-0 at Malaga on Saturday with an early Antoine Griezmann goal. The Rojiblancos visit the Camp Nou in three weeks. ""We don't like to draw at home, but that's football. Our opponents defended really well and we were unable to score,"" Valverde told beIN Sports. ""Maybe we lacked a bit of spark, that's possible. It is strange for us not to score here at our stadium."" With Samuel Umtiti banned, Thomas Vermaelen not fit and Gerard Pique only on the bench, Valverde handed a first start to January signing Yerry Mina and partnered him in central defence with Lucas Digne. That pair were rarely overly troubled, but at the other end Valverde's decision to bring both Paco Alcacer and Philippe Coutinho into the line-up did not have the desired impact. They both lasted just over an hour, with Coutinho forcing a fine save from Guaita from a curling strike in the 58th minute. Meanwhile, Ousmane Dembele came on in the second half for his first appearance since his latest spell on the sidelines, but the young France forward was also incapable of breaking down the Getafe back line. Former Arsenal midfielder Mathieu Flamini came on towards the end to make his debut for Getafe, who are 10th. Real Madrid moved back up to third with a comprehensive 5-2 win over Real Sociedad on Saturday in which Cristiano Ronaldo scored a hat-trick for the first time this season. However, they are still 17 points adrift of Barcelona, albeit with a game in hand. Valencia, who have lost their last six games in all competitions, have the chance to move back above Madrid if they can win at home to Levante later on Sunday (1945 GMT). Earlier, Sergio Rico was the hero for Sevilla with a penalty save and several key interventions as his side boosted their European hopes with a 1-0 win over Girona. The only goal of the game at a sunny Sanchez Pizjuan was scored just over 30 seconds into the second half, with Pablo Sarabia making sure the ball went in after a Joaquin Correa effort was stopped on the line. But, before that, Rico had intervened to prevent the home side going behind just prior to the interval, diving to his right to save an Aday Benitez penalty awarded for a handball by Luis Muriel. Sevilla, who will face Barcelona in the Copa del Rey final in April and host Manchester United in the Champions League on February 21, are sixth in La Liga."
503,10/02/2018,14:22,Dembele set for latest Barcelona comeback,Ousmane Dembele is in line to make his latest comeback for Barcelona when the leaders of La Liga take on Getafe at the Camp Nou on Sunday.,"The young France forward has endured a campaign ravaged by injury since his 105 million-euro ($124 million) move from Borussia Dortmund in August, a fee that could eventually rise to as much as 145 million euros. He spent three and a half months on the sidelines with a hamstring tear and had only been back a couple of weeks when a thigh problem suffered in the 4-2 win at Real Sociedad in mid-January put him back on the treatment table. If the 20-year-old can stay fit, he could have a role to play in the impending Champions League last-16 tie with Chelsea, the first leg of which will be played in London on February 20. ""It depends on the work he does, but he is a player in whom we have a lot of hope,"" said coach Ernesto Valverde when asked if Dembele would play in Sunday's game. ""We need to go carefully, but let's see if he can bring something to the team in what is a decisive stage in the season. ""He has the quality to help us. He has been training with the squad for a while now. He will come back bit by bit, but we think the game tomorrow (Sunday) is a good time for him to be there."" Barca are still unbeaten in La Liga this season, but this game against mid-table Getafe comes less than 72 hours after Valverde's side beat Valencia to secure their place in the Copa del Rey final. Gerard Pique is a doubt after coming off hurt late in that match -- he has been included in the squad but the Spain defender did not train with the rest of his team-mates on Saturday. ""It is true that he has a problem and we took a risk on him the other day because it was a decisive game,"" said Valverde. ""If he didn't train then there is a reason for that. ""After tomorrow's game we have a long week with time to recover from our efforts in January. We need to touch wood but we are hoping for no more setbacks."" With Thomas Vermaelen out, Colombian international centre-back Yerry Mina could make his first start since signing from Palmeiras last month. He could be partnered by Sergio Busquets. jed-as/pb <org>BORUSSIA DORTMUND</org>"
504,08/02/2018,22:48,Coutinho opens account as Barcelona reach Copa del Rey final,Philippe Coutinho came off the bench to score his first goal for Barcelona in a 2-0 win at Valencia on Thursday that saw his new club ease into another Copa del Rey final.,"Coutinho broke the deadlock in the 49th minute of the semi-final, second leg at Mestalla, having only come on at the start of the second half. It was the first time the Brazilian had found the net since his blockbuster 160 million-euro ($192 million) move from Liverpool in early January. Ivan Rakitic then swept home the second goal eight minutes from the end as holders Barcelona secured a place in the final for the fifth season running. Winners of the trophy in each of the last three campaigns, the Catalans will face Sevilla in the final set for the weekend of April 21 and 22. Sevilla beat Leganes 2-0 on Wednesday to go through 3-1 on aggregate. ""For me it is my first final, so it is a very special moment,"" Coutinho told Spanish TV station Gol. ""I am very happy. I had been searching for this goal in my first few matches. Today I got it and it helped the team get through to the final."" Valencia were hoping to reach the final for the first time since they won the trophy under Ronald Koeman in 2008, beating Barcelona in the last four on the way. Trailing 1-0 from the first leg after Luis Suarez's strike separated the teams at the Camp Nou last week, Valencia almost levelled the tie on aggregate early on. However, Rodrigo's header beat Jasper Cillessen in the Barca goal only to come back off the bar. Lionel Messi had come close on a couple of occasions for the visitors in the first half, but it was the introduction of Coutinho that swung the tie decisively their way. Barca coach Ernesto Valverde sent his recent recruit on in place of Andre Gomes, and Coutinho quickly made his mark, turning in a Suarez cross at the back post. Valencia had centre-back Ezequiel Garay carried off and then saw Cillessen make an incredible save to deny Jose Gaya from point-blank range in the 74th minute. They were condemned to a sixth straight defeat in all competitions as Suarez pounced on a Gabriel Paulista error and set up Rakitic to make it 2-0 on the night. The only slight setback for Barca was the sight of centre-back Gerard Pique coming off hurt late on, with Colombian international defender Yerry Mina coming on for his debut."
505,07/02/2018,14:11,Man Utd's Sanchez accepts suspended Spanish sentence for tax fraud,Manchester United striker Alexis Sanchez has struck a deal with Spanish authorities to accept a 16-month suspended jail sentence for tax fraud in return for avoiding a trial.,"Sanchez, who joined United from Arsenal last month, faced being tried over a one-million-euro ($1.23 million) fraud linked to image rights in 2012 and 2013 during his time at Spanish giants Barcelona, according to details of the deal seen by AFP. The 29-year-old Chilean forward is rumoured to be the highest paid player in the Premier League following his move to United, reportedly earning around £500,000 ($710,000, 571,000 euros) a week before tax. He is one of a number of high-profile players to have fallen foul of the tax laws in Spain. Last month, Real Madrid's Croatian midfielder Luka Modric paid Spanish fiscal authorities close to one million euros to settle his own image rights tax case."
506,05/02/2018,00:07,"Pique keeps Barca unbeaten, Atletico cut gap","Gerard Pique salvaged a 1-1 draw for La Liga leaders Barcelona at city rivals Espanyol on Sunday, keeping their bid for an unbeaten campaign on track, while Atletico Madrid edged out Valencia to cut the gap at the top to nine points.","Ernesto Valverde's men were in danger of falling to their first league defeat of the season when Gerard Moreno nodded the hosts ahead midway through the second half, but centre-back Pique met a Lionel Messi corner in the 82nd minute to snatch a point. Barcelona are now nine points clear at the top of the table from Atletico Madrid, who beat third-placed Valencia 1-0 at the Wanda Metropolitano. The Catalan derby was played in pouring rain and Valverde slammed the ""dangerous"" pitch. ""Even though it was raining, we thought that the pitch would hold, but then we saw that the grass was not going to hold up and that the pitch was becoming dangerous,"" the Barcelona coach said. ""On our passes from defence the ball could get stuck in a puddle and that's why things got difficult. ""We give a lot of value to this draw, because it was hard to get because of this scenario and because it's a derby and we didn't want to lose."" The five-time European champions also set a new club record of 22 matches unbeaten to start a league season on Sunday, and are still in the hunt for a La Liga, Copa del Rey and Champions League treble. ""We are still up there (top of the table). The conditions for them and for us were not the best, but it was an entertaining game,"" Barca captain Andres Iniesta told BeIn Sports. They were far from at their fluent best against a stubborn Espanyol whose point drags them eight clear of the relegation zone, although Philippe Coutinho came close to scoring his first goal since joining from Liverpool last month when he struck the crossbar in the first half. Faltering champions Real Madrid are 19 points adrift of arch rivals Barca in fourth, after throwing away two points in a 2-2 draw at Levante on Saturday. Atletico took advantage of Barcelona's draw to revive their slim title hopes, as Angel Correa produced a moment of magic to win the game. Neither side managed to create many chances in a sloppy first half, with Saul Niguez seeing a long-range effort palmed away by Valencia goalkeeper Neto, while Simone Zaza dragged a shot wide for the visitors. But Correa stunned Neto with a magnificent long-range strike when nothing appeared on in the 59th minute, with the ball flying into the top corner from 25 yards out to give the 22-year-old Argentinian his sixth league goal of the season. Valencia plugged away but never truly threatened an equaliser, with Diego Simeone's hosts doing enough to keep Barca looking over their shoulders. But star forward Antoine Griezmann was whistled by the home fans late on, when he opted to run down the clock instead of pushing for a second goal. The Frenchman has had an up-and-down relationship with the Atletico supporters since saying last year he wanted to leave the club in the future. ""Griezmann did what he had to do... That's normal, people want to win,"" coach Simeone said. ""The players are the ones who best interpret what they have to do on the pitch. Griezmann made only good choices tonight, even though he didn't score and couldn't finish. ""Everyone is happy, all the fans are celebrating at home and everyone is happy."" Earlier on Sunday, Girona moved into the top half of the table as Uruguayan international Cristhian Stuani scored a double in a 2-0 win over Athletic Bilbao, while Getafe and Leganes played out a goalless draw."
507,03/02/2018,14:59,Valverde cautious as Dembele resumes Barcelona training,"Ousmane Dembele, who is recovering from injury, has resumed light training with the Barcelona squad, coach Ernesto Valverde said on Saturday adding that he would be ""prudent"" with the winger.","Dembele has been hampered by injuries since his transfer from Dortmund last summer for 105 million euro ($124 million), plus add-ons. The 20-year-old attacker took part in a training session on Saturday, three weeks after his second thigh injury of the season. The first injury, a few days after the Frenchman's arrival in Barcelona, required surgery and kept him out until January. When Dembele returned, he re-injured the thigh. ""He did part of the session with the squad and next week he'll join in more, little by little,"" Valverde told a news conference. ""We'll see when he's available."" Barcelona are 11 points clear in La Liga and resume their Champions League campaign, against Chelsea, on February 14. ""Of course he's not ready to play right now, we'll try to be cautious with him, just like we were when he was recovering from his previous injury,"" Valverde added. ""He has had a little relapse and we are going to make sure it does not happen again."" Dembele is not in the squad for the derby match against Espanyol in La Liga on Sunday. Victory would set a new club record of 22 matches unbeaten from the start of the season. Before this season, the longest Barcelona had stayed unbeaten was 21 games under Per Guardiola in 2009-2010.

""A semi-final, it's the chance to play a final and we must give everything to get there. ""Valencia will do the same thing. Reaching a final doesn't happen every day,"" added Valverde, whose side have already beaten Celta Vigo and local rivals Espanyol in the cup this month. Barcelona, the record 29-time champions, are attempting to become the first team to lift the cup four years in a row since Athletic Bilbao in the 1930s. They will be strong favourites to reach a fifth successive final, with Valencia missing a trio of key players -- Goncalo Guedes, Geoffrey Kondogbia and Ezequiel Garay -- through injury. ""They're feeling the effects of lots of matches this January,"" said Valverde, who spent six months in charge of Valencia between 2012 and 2013. Barcelona thrashed Valencia 8-1 on aggregate -- following a 7-0 win in the first leg -- at the same stage of the competition two years ago, but Valverde acknowledged a repeat scoreline is unlikely. ""It won't be like the last time, a 7-0 is not normal for a first game. Valencia were in a delicate position then, but now they have a team that is good enough to win any match."""

The midfielder has moved to the Spanish club for an undisclosed fee and will initially join up with the Barcelona B squad. Barcelona B compete in Spain's second-tier Segunda division, which is the equivalent of the English Championship. Barca have an option to extend the 18-year-old's contract by a further two years. London-born McGuane graduated from Arsenal's youth academy after joining the Premier League club at under-six level. ""We would like to thank Marcus for his contribution and wish him well at Barcelona,"" an Arsenal statement read. England Under-19 midfielder McGuane played twice for Arsenal's first team this season in Europa League ties against Red Star Belgrade and BATE Borisov. Speaking about McGuane last year, Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger said: ""He is a defensive midfielder, and overall he can play as a wing-back or even a centre-back in training."" A Barcelona statement added: ""McGuane's deal will keep him at Barca for three seasons, plus two option years. The buy-out clause has been set at E25m."""

Watford, who are 10th in the Premier League, last week appointed Spaniard Javi Gracia as their new coach after sacking Marco Silva. Deulofeu, a 23-year-old Spanish international, has already played in England, featuring for Everton on loan in 2013-14 before the Merseyside club signed him permanently in 2015.

Luis Suarez had broken the away side's tough resistence with a sweet volley from Andres Iniesta's cross 18 minutes from the end, setting the stage for Messi's dramatic and stylish winner. The Argentine's strike ensures that Barca stay unbeaten in the league, and keeps Atletico Madrid 11 points back despite their 3-0 hammering of Las Palmas earlier. Barca coach Ernesto Valverdes said he was happy with Coutinho who had started Thursday's Copa del Rey clash with Valencia on the bench before making a second-half appearance. ""Players are not machines who can fit in at once, like a new part,"" said Valverde. ""He did well, he wanted the ball. This is one more step for him. The other day, he played 25 minutes, this time a little more, he will integrate little by little."" With Diego Costa out injured, Atletico took a while to get going and had to wait until the 61st minute to open the scoring, Antoine Griezmann latching on to Juanfran's fine ball down the right flank before dinking neatly over Las Palmas stopper Leandro Chichizola. ""The first half was not very good but the coach gave us a good talking to at half-time, and we responded well,"" said Griezmann, whose goal was just his seventh in the league this season but his fourth in league and cup since the turn of the year. ""I feel good, I've started the year well and I hope to continue the goals and assists."" Frenchman Griezmann started the move that led to Atletico's second, intercepting a loose pass and setting Angel Correa free to scamper down the pitch and feed Fernando Torres, who shifted the ball onto his right foot and lashed home just his second goal of the season, the 600th scored by Atletico in all competitions during Diego Simeone's seven-year reign as coach. An easy tap-in from Thomas Partey after great work from Yannick Carrasco two minutes from time completed the second-half rout of a desperate Las Palmas, who remain second from bottom and five points from safety. Sevilla were denied the chance to close within three points of Real Madrid and the Champions league places after Angel Rodriguez scored a controversial equaliser deep in stoppage time to snatch a 1-1 draw for Getafe at the Roman Sanchez Pizjaun stadium. Luis Muriel had slid in a 72nd-minute opener for hosts but with seconds to spare Juan Cala challenged Sevilla keeper Sergio Rico for a hopeful high ball, and with the Sevilla fans and players clamouring for a free-kick, Angel lashed home the leveller and celebrated under a hail of whistles and boos."

""I've said it many times that my own personal objective is to help the team win titles. We hope to finish this season in the best way possible and it's going very well so far,"" said five-time Ballon d'Or winner Messi. ""There's still a lot of football to play but luckily things are panning out well and we came back well against Espanyol."" Messi said the club's coach Ernesto Valverde, who took over in the last close season should be given credit for the upswing in results after a disappointing final season under Enrique that was compounded by Real Madrid winning the league and the Champions League. ""The new coach was very clear in telling us what he wanted, which was rather similar to what we did before really,"" said Messi.

520,20/01/2018,19:39,Barcelona deny reports of Griezmann agreement,"Barcelona have ""strongly"" denied claims made by Spanish daily Sport on Saturday that they have reached an agreement to sign Antoine Griezmann from Atletico Madrid at the end of the season.","""The Atletico Madrid forward has agreed to join Barcelona and will be under (coach) Ernesto Valverde's orders next season,"" Sport said, adding that Griezmann's current buy-out clause of 200 million euros ($240 million) drops by half on July 1. However, Barcelona later took the unusual step of releasing a statement to deny the reports from the Catalan newspaper. ""FC Barcelona strongly denies the information that has appeared over the course of the last few hours in different media regarding Atletico Madrid player, Antoine Griezmann, and an alleged deal with our club,"" said the statement on the Catalan club's website. Such a reaction can be explained by the fact that Atletico have complained to FIFA about ""repeated contacts"" between Barca and the France striker. ""FC Barcelona expresses its objections in the face of these events and reiterates its full respect for the institution of Atletico Madrid,"" added the statement. Barcelona have been scrambling to add high-quality players to their squad since Paris Saint-Germain lured Brazilian star Neymar to France in a world-record signing last August. Philippe Coutinho joined from Liverpool this month in a 180 million-euro ($220 million) deal. Not wanting to add fuel to the fire, Valverde played down the transfer talk at his press conference ahead of Sunday's trip to Betis in La Liga. ""Griezmann is a great player who plays for another club whom we respect,"" he said. ""When the transfer window is open, we are in a world where there is speculation on a daily basis and we have to live with that. ""But if you're asking me if Griezmann is a good player, well obviously he is a good player. But I repeat what I always say: I prefer to talk about my own players."" Sport says it believes Griezmann's transfer will take place after the World Cup in Russia, where he will have a key role for France, who are among the favourites. Another Catalan daily, Mundo Deportivo, reported in December that the player's family had lunch with the Barcelona president Josep Maria Bartomeu to smooth the way for the transfer. Brazilian born Spain striker Diego Costa joined Atletico from Chelsea in September, and has proved to be the club's top performer since his debut two weeks ago. Barcelona, whose stars Lionel Messi, Luis Suarez and Andres Iniesta are all in their thirties, signed Ousmane Dembele from Borussia Dortmund for 105 million euros last summer, but the 20-year-old French rising star's campaign has been marred by injury."

The Catalan daily also points out that while Griezmann currently has a buyout clause of 200 million euros ($240 million), that figure drops by half on July 1. Barcelona have been scrambling to add high-quality players to their squad since Paris Saint Germain lured Brazilian star Neymar to France in a world record signing in August.

522,19/01/2018,12:18,Sergi Roberto signs new Barcelona deal,"Sergi Roberto has signed a three-year contract extension with Barcelona, tying him to the leaders of La Liga until 2022, the club announced on Friday.","Barcelona said the deal included a 500 million-euro ($614 million) buyout clause for the 25-year-old, whose existing deal was due to expire in 2019. Spanish press reports said that deal had included a buyout clause worth just 30 million euros, a figure that made them vulnerable to approaches from rival clubs. The announcement comes just a day after Barcelona revealed that Gerard Pique had extended his contract by three years to 2022."
523,19/01/2018,02:05,Barcelona stay calm after seeing unbeaten run end,Andres Iniesta has insisted that nobody at Barcelona is panicking after the runaway leaders of La Liga saw their long unbeaten run come to an end.,"Lionel Messi missed a penalty as the Catalans lost 1-0 away to local rivals Espanyol in the quarter-finals of the Copa del Rey on Wednesday, although the holders can still turn the tie around in the second leg next week. ""What nobody was expecting was that we would not lose a game until now,"" Iniesta told reporters while visiting a Barcelona hospital on Thursday. It was a first defeat in 30 games in all competitions for Ernesto Valverde's side, who have still not lost in La Liga. ""It is football, it is sport, and you always have to play in very intense matches,"" added Iniesta, with Sunday's trip to Betis to come before the return against Espanyol. ""It is not a one-off tie and in the second leg we will try to change things. For the defeat to plant doubts would be to see it from a very negative viewpoint after so many matches without losing."" Iniesta said that he hoped to be back soon from an injury that he described as ""only a strain"", while Barca are also without their two record signings Philippe Coutinho and Ousmane Dembele due to thigh problems. Dembele is out for three to four weeks after hurting himself in last week's 4-2 victory at Real Sociedad. Betis are the great entertainers in La Liga -- their last two games have seen them win 5-3 and 3-2 -- and coach Quique Setien has urged his players to attack the leaders at the Benito Villamarin. ""Barcelona are very difficult (to play against). We will be brave, I'm sure,"" Setien told Cadena Ser. ""It is our destiny to play, to win the ball back in the opposition half and go after them to try to pose them problems."" With Real Madrid mired in crisis, Atletico Madrid are Barcelona's nearest challengers, sitting nine points back in second place. Diego Simeone's side entertain Girona as they seek to bounce back from a 2-1 home loss to Sevilla in the Copa del Rey. Centre-back Diego Godin is banned but Diego Costa can return after suspension. Valencia, a further two points back in third, will be confident of beating a Las Palmas side in wretched form -- the bottom-of-the-table side from the Canary Islands have lost their last two matches by an aggregate score of 10-0. Meanwhile, at the Bernabeu, Zinedine Zidane's faltering reigning champions host Deportivo on Sunday. A 1-0 home defeat to Villarreal last weekend made it the first time Real had suffered back-to-back home league defeats in more than eight years. They have taken just one point from their last three La Liga outings while doubts are being raised about Cristiano Ronaldo's future at the club beyond this season. Zidane has said that he ""can't imagine a Madrid without Cristiano"", but the Portuguese superstar will be 33 next month and he has just four league goals this season. Ronaldo was left out of the squad for Thursday's 1-0 Copa del Rey victory at Leganes along with Karim Benzema and Gareth Bale. They should all return against Deportivo. ""Real Madrid are Real Madrid. I don't think they are in crisis. The demand is always on them to win and so when they don't, it seems that everything is going badly. But they can beat you at any moment,"" warned Depor's Adrian Lopez."
524,18/01/2018,16:36,Neymar cost Barcelona over 200 mln euros,"FC Barcelona shelled out more than 200 million euros ($245 million) for Neymar including his salary and the ""countless hidden clauses of the transfer,"" Spain's El Mundo daily said Thursday.","If confirmed, this would be greatly superior to the 57.1 million euros the club said it paid for his 2013 transfer, or even the 83.3 million euros later estimated by Spanish authorities probing irregularities in the move. The 25-year-old and his parents have been ordered to stand trial over the transfer, as have Barcelona president Josep Maria Bartomeu and his predecessor Sandro Rosell. El Mundo based its information on documents handed over to Spanish prosecutors by Brazilian authorities, which are also probing the football star for tax evasion. A judicial source, who refused to be named, confirmed to AFP that prosecutors had indeed received those documents. But the source wasn't able to give any concrete figures, adding prosecutors received the documents in August last year. The Spanish judge in charge of the case has still not set a date for the trial and has to decide whether he can accept the latest information as evidence, as it arrived after the probe was closed, the sources say. According to El Mundo, the documents were given to Brazilian authorities by ""the former right-hand man of the footballer's father, Eduardo Musa."" The daily says the deal between Barcelona and Neymar's entourage was divided into two parts. On the one hand was ""the footballer's salary, which went up to 71 million euros before tax in five years,"" and on the other hand ""many fictitious contracts... that reach 134 million."" Among these contracts, El Mundo includes an agreement to play friendly matches with Santos, Neymar's former club, which never took place. The case against Neymar initiated with a complaint from Brazilian investment company DIS, which owned 40 percent of Neymar's sporting rights at the time of his transfer. DIS received just 6.8 million euros -- 40 percent of the 17 million euros fee paid to Santos -- with the company claiming it was cheated out of its real share because part of the transfer fee was concealed by Barcelona, Santos and the Neymar family. Spanish prosecutors have recommended that Neymar be handed a two-year jail sentence and fined 10 million euros. Sentences of two years or less are habitually suspended for first time offenders in Spain."
525,18/01/2018,11:46,Pique extends Barcelona deal,Resurgent Barcelona were given a fresh boost Thursday when key defender Gerard Pique signed a contract extension until 2022.,"Having recently lost Brazilian superstar Neymar in an aggressive contract buy out by Paris Saint-Germain, Barcelona have put a 500 million euros ($611 million) buy out clause in Pique's new contract. ""The club and the player have agreed terms on a new deal through to June 30, 2022. We will announce when the official signing will take place in a couple of days,"" Barcelona said on their website. The 30-year-old joined Barcelona from Manchester United in 2008 and has proved an increasingly steady presence as centre-back with the Catalans winning three Champions Leagues and six Spanish Liga titles during his tenure. The 6ft 4in (1.94m) Pique was part of the Spain side that won the 2010 World Cup and the 2012 European Championships. Barcelona currently top the Spanish League with a nine points lead over Atletico Madrid, but are an impressive 19 points clear of fourth placed arch-rivals Real Madrid."
526,15/01/2018,14:26,Barcelona's Dembele suffers new injury setback,"Barcelona's Ousmane Dembele has been ruled out for ""three to four weeks"" in a new blow for the French forward, his club announced on Monday.","Dembele hurt himself after coming off the bench in the second half of Sunday's 4-2 win away to Real Sociedad in La Liga. The injury is different to the hamstring tear that ruled him out for three and half months. ""After the game against Real Sociedad, Dembele had a problem with his left thigh and tests have confirmed that the player has suffered a hamstring injury of the semitendinosus muscle that does not affect the area operated on earlier in the season,"" Barcelona said in a statement published on their website. ""The injury will mean he will be out for a period of around three to four weeks."" He now faces a race against time to be ready for the first leg of Barca's Champions League tie against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge on February 20. Dembele only returned at the start of this month after tearing his hamstring in September. The fitness problems have blighted the start of his career at Barcelona following his 105-million-euro ($124 million) move from Borussia Dortmund in August that could rise to as much as 145 million euros. Barcelona also said that Andres Iniesta ""has a problem in his right calf and his recovery will determine his return to action for the coming matches."" Iniesta was an unused substitute in Sunday's game as Barcelona came from two goals down to win 4-2 at Anoeta. Ernesto Valverde's side are already unable to call on new record signing Philippe Coutinho until the end of the month after he arrived with a thigh injury following his Spanish record 160 million-euro transfer from Liverpool."
527,13/01/2018,12:34,Basaksehir say Turan loan agreed with Barcelona,Turkish league leaders Istanbul Basaksehir on Saturday announced they had reached an agreement to sign midfielder Arda Turan on loan from Barcelona.,"""Arda Turan is returning to his country wearing the orange kit (of Basaksehir). This is not just a transfer for Basaksehir, but a transfer for all of Turkey,"" club president Goksel Gumusdag said in a statement. In a tweet, the club shared a video of a crossword being filled in with the key answers being ""Arda Turan."" Basaksehir have risen rapidly over the last two seasons to rival the established Istanbul triumvirate of Besiktas, Fenerbahce and Galatasaray. Barcelona and the Istanbul club agreed on a one-and-a-half year loan with an optional extra year, state broadcaster TRT Spor and Hurriyet daily reported. Gumusdag visited Barcelona earlier this week to meet Turan. The 30-year-old joined Barcelona in 2015 after four successful seasons with Atletico Madrid but has been unable to hold down a first team place. Turan receives an annual salary of around eight million euros at the Catalan club, according to Spanish media. He quit international football last June after former coach Fatih Terim threw him out of a training camp following a fracas with a reporter on a plane. Turan then declared two months later he was ready for a recall. Turan has also expressed open support for President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, attending rallies to back ""my commander-in-chief"" following the July 2016 attempted coup."
528,12/01/2018,20:10,Lionel Messi -- 'the 100 million-euro man',"Lionel Messi, who recently penned a lucrative new contract with Barcelona, could comfortably earn more than 100 million euros every year, according to a report released by France-based Mediapart.","Journalists from European Investigation Collaborations (EIC) claimed to have seen the details of the updated contract signed by Messi on November 25. According to the report, Messi is guaranteed around 70 million euros a year in salary and image rights with more coming from a 63.5 million euro signing bonus and 70 million euro ""loyalty bonus"" for the period of the contract which stretches to 2021. The mind-boggling deal, revealed as part of ""Football Leaks"" was to offset an approach for the Argentine from great rivals Real Madrid. The group claimed that in June 2013, an email exchange between the player's lawyer Inigo Juarez and his father Jorge, explained that Real were prepared to shell out the 250 million euro release clause that Messi commanded."

530,11/01/2018,23:48,Messi puts on masterclass for watching Coutinho,Lionel Messi put on a masterclass in front of new recruit Philippe Coutinho as Barcelona trounced Celta Vigo 5-0 Thursday to ease into the Copa del Rey quarter-finals 6-1 on aggregate.,"Coutinho, dressed in a black shirt dotted with white stars, was in the stands at the Camp Nou for the first time since his 160 million-euro ($192 million) move from Liverpool. It didn't take long for the Brazilian star to appreciate the playing riches on show on the pitch. Level at 1-1 after the first leg, the three-time defending champions were 4-0 up by half-time. Messi grabbed the opening two goals in the 13th and 15th minutes, both finished with a sublime first touch with his left foot, both created by Jordi Alba. Messi then returned the favour by setting up Alba to score past the hapless Sergio Alvarez in the Celta goal before Luis Suarez made it 4-0 on the night after 30 minutes when the Uruguayan burst through the defence. The tie petered out in the second half but French international Ousmane Dembele showed why Barcelona paid 105 million euros for him last year when he dribbled past three defenders from the halfway line before being denied by a desperate tackle. Dembele did have time to set up the fifth goal of the night three minutes from the end when his corner was headed home from close range by an unmarked Ivan Rakitic. ""It's luxury to have Leo in the side, he's the best in history. We always look for each other to score goals and today we have done it twice,"" said Alba. Earlier Thursday, Espanyol overturned a 2-1 loss in the first leg to defeat Levante 2-0 with Leo Baptistao and Gerard Moreno on target either side of half-time. Sevilla also progressed with a 2-1 win at home to second-tier Cadiz for a 4-1 aggregate. Wissam Ben Yedder, after 31 minutes, and Joaquin Correa in the 54th minute, were on target for Vincenzo Montella's team. On Wednesday, Real Madrid laboured to a 2-2 draw with Numancia to progress to the quarter-finals 5-2 on aggregate. In a much-changed side, Lucas Vazquez scored both of Real's goals after the 11th and 59th minutes. But on both occasions, their modest visitors fought back thanks to a brace from Guillermo on the stroke of half-time and then after 82 minutes. Numancia ended the game with 10 men after captain Dani Calvo was red-carded in the dying moments. Leganes, a modest club from the Madrid suburbs, reached the quarter-finals for the first time in their 89-year existence. Despite losing 2-1 at Villarreal, who are currently sixth in La Liga, Leganes progressed on away goals having won the first leg 1-0. Moroccan international Nabil El Zhar scored the crucial away goal for mid-table Leganes on the half-hour mark."
531,11/01/2018,12:15,Colombia centre-back Mina joins Barca,"Colombia centre-back Yerry Mina joined Barcelona from Brazilian side Palmeiras on Thursday on a five year contract for a fee of 11.8 million euros ($14mn), the Catalan club announced.","The 6ft 5in (1.95m) 23-year-old is set to fill the void left by Javier Mascherano, who is on the verge of a 10mn euro switch to China's Hebei Fortune. The Colombian international will be Barcelona's second signing of the January transfer window after Philippe Coutinho's 160 million-euro capture from Liverpool. Mina has a 100mn euro release clause attached to his contract. With Mascherino set to leave and injured young French centre-back Samuel Umtiti widely reported to be in talks with Manchester City, Barcelona had faced being left with only two recognised centre backs in Gerard Pique and Thomas Vermaelen."
532,08/01/2018,19:02,Coutinho completes 160-million-euro Barcelona move,"Philippe Coutinho said he is targeting titles at Barcelona after finally completing his ""dream"" 160 million-euro ($192 million) move from Liverpool on Monday.","The Brazilian signed a five-year contract in a ceremony sitting alongside Barca president Josep Maria Bartomeu, making him the third-most expensive player in history. ""It's an honour for me, a great honour, but also a dream to be here,"" Coutinho said after posing on the Camp Nou pitch in a Barcelona shirt. ""I have my goals; to get here, to be happy, win titles and have fun -- I only think about that."" Minutes before the midfielder put pen to paper after a whirlwind few days, the club said a thigh injury would delay his debut until the end of January. The runaway La Liga leaders also claimed that Liverpool had cut their original asking price from 200 million euros, after a long-running transfer saga dating back to the summer window. ""Due to a contractual issue and due to Liverpool's desire, we cannot provide the exact figures, but there has been a very significant reduction (in price),"" said Barcelona vice-president Jordi Mestre. Barca's swoop for Coutinho is outranked only by Paris Saint-Germain's stunning world record 222 million-euro signing of Neymar from Barcelona last year, and the Paris club's capture of French striker Kylian Mbappe in a deal which will be worth 180 million euros when the teenager completes his initial loan deal later this year. Coutinho's arrival will help Barcelona move on from the humiliation of losing Neymar, and his presence alongside Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez will help take the pressure off another of the club's stars, 33-year-old midfielder Andres Iniesta. But the Brazilian international insisted he would not be replacing Neymar or Iniesta in Ernesto Valverde's side. ""Neymar is a huge player... But we have different characteristics and I've come here to find my space,"" Coutinho said. ""I spoke with him. He told me about the city, the players and told me that this club has an amazing dressing room. ""Iniesta, for me, is a genius. What I like most is being in the group and being able to play, the rest is a question for the coach."" Bartomeu said the club had secured ""one of the stars of world football"" and admitted that Liverpool had put up a fight to keep the player. ""It was not easy and other clubs expressed an interest in him, but he was determined to come here,"" the president said. Barcelona made three bids for Coutinho last year, but Liverpool stood firm. In the end, the lure of a huge profit on a player they paid just £8.5 million for when he joined from Inter Milan in 2013 proved too strong for the English club. Coach Valverde predicted Coutinho will comfortably fit into his star-studded team, and he could now make his debut at home to Alaves on January 28. Coutinho played with Suarez for 18 months at Liverpool before the Uruguayan made the same move to Spain in 2014. ""It's an honour to be able to play with him (Suarez) again,"" Coutinho added. ""He's helped me a lot, wrote to me a lot and explained to me about the club and city... He even visited a few houses for me! He's a very close friend."" Valverde admitted that it would be a challenge to find a position for Coutinho, with the Spanish title looking a formality and the player cup-tied for the Champions League. ""I have seen him play in various positions -- on the right, the left, in the middle, on the wings,"" said Valverde. He is likely to be used to give Iniesta a rest, keeping the veteran midfielder fresh for the Champions League as Barcelona seek to wrest the trophy back from bitter rivals Real Madrid. Rio-born Coutinho scored 54 goals for Liverpool in all competitions, although he won no silverware during his five-year stay at Anfield. His departure is a blow to Liverpool as he had returned to top form after an injury-hit start to the season, scoring seven goals in the last eight games of 2017. Liverpool have been tipped to quickly reinvest their windfall from the Coutinho sale, with Leicester City winger Riyad Mahrez and Monaco's Thomas Lemar both linked with a switch to Anfield."
533,08/01/2018,16:47,Barcelona claim Liverpool cut Coutinho price,Barcelona vice-president Jordi Mestre claimed Liverpool slashed their original asking price for Philippe Coutinho after the Brazilian playmaker completed his 160-million-euro ($192 million) move to the Catalan giants.,"Coutinho signed a five-year contract to end a long-running transfer saga on Monday with Mestre revealing that Liverpool had originally asked for 200 million euros. The news will be poorly received on Merseyside, where fans were assured the Premier League club had tried to keep hold of their star. ""Due to a contractual issue and due to Liverpool's desire, we can not provide the exact data, but there has been a very significant reduction (in price),"" the Barcelona director told a press conference at the Camp Nou. ""This time the reduction in their price was enough for us to authorise the transfer."" ""We didn't want to put the club's whole economy and heritage at risk,"" explained Mestre, a 55-year-old who was director of the youth academy before becoming vice-president for sports at Barca. Mestre may have been referring to demands made for Coutinho in July when Barcelona tabled three solid offers for Coutinho in the wake of an aggressive transfer struggle that saw Paris Saint-Germain take Neymar from the Catalans for a world record 222 million euros. Barcelona then bought Ousmane Dembele from Borussia Dortmund for a deal that could reach 147 million euros and Mestre said the club had been reticent to put themselves at financial risk."
534,08/01/2018,13:05,Coutinho Barca start delayed by injury,"Philippe Coutinho will not be able to make his debut for Barcelona until the end of January because he has a thigh injury, the club said on Monday.","""Coutinho has an injury to his right thigh and he is expected to be out for around three weeks,"" Barcelona said on their website. Coutinho, 25, will be officially unveiled by Barca later on Monday, completing a 160-million-euro ($192 million) move from Liverpool, making it the third richest transfer in history. The Brazilian midfielder could in theory make his debut on January 28 when Alaves visit the Camp Nou in La Liga."
535,07/01/2018,22:04,Coutinho hails 'dream come true' in joining Barcelona,"Philippe Coutinho has described his move from Liverpool to Barcelona as ""a dream come true"" after appearing at the Camp Nou for the first time on Sunday ahead of his official unveiling.","""Barca fans, I'm here now. It's a dream come true! I hope to see you tomorrow,"" said Coutinho, who will be presented to supporters on Monday, in a short video clip released by Barcelona. The 25-year-old posed for photographers at the Camp Nou wearing a tracksuit top in the colours of the club a day after Barcelona confirmed a 160 million-euro ($192 million) deal to buy him. It is the third-biggest transfer in football history and a club record deal for Barcelona. He is due to officially sign his contract at 12:30 local time (1130 GMT), with an appearance on the Camp Nou pitch set and a press conference also set for Monday afternoon. ""Now I want to play, win trophies and make the supporters happy. Those are my objectives,"" Coutinho told Barca TV. The Brazilian has agreed a deal through to 2023 at the Camp Nou and is looking forward to playing alongside Lionel Messi, Luis Suarez and Andres Iniesta, players he described as ""idols"". Coutinho has already played alongside Suarez for 18 months at Liverpool before the Uruguayan made the same move in 2014. ""Everybody knows about his quality. He has been playing at the highest level for years now and that is important,"" Suarez told Barca TV about the new arrival. ""Now we need to make sure he feels at home because we know that changing club is always difficult, but I think he is the type of player who will fit well into the team."" Barcelona fans see Coutinho as the long-term successor to Iniesta, and coach Ernesto Valverde is aiming to make the most of the Brazilian's ability to play in a range of positions. ""I think he can bring a lot to the team. He scores and sets up goals, and going forward he can help us a lot as he can play both inside and out wide,"" remarked Valverde after Barcelona's comfortable 3-0 La Liga win over Levante on Sunday. ""He is versatile and we can take advantage of his versatility."" The deal had been in the pipeline for months, but having previously tried to avoid talking about the Brazilian, Valverde can now look forward to welcoming him into his squad for a busy second half of the season. ""It is a signing that has been talked about for a long time, although it was not something I was keen to discuss,"" said Valverde, whose team are still unbeaten in La Liga and sit nine points clear of Atletico Madrid at the top of the table. Capable of playing on the wing and in a more withdrawn midfield role, Coutinho's arrival provides a wealth of new options to Valverde, although he will not be able to play in the Champions League knockout phase having already featured in the competition for Liverpool. ""We will wait until I have seen him train for a day at least until we talk about that,"" added Valverde when pressed on where the ex-Inter Milan man would fit into his team. ""It is true that I have seen videos of him playing in different positions, for Liverpool and for his country. But let's wait and see. ""I hope he adapts quickly, although good players adapt quickly to any circumstances."""
536,07/01/2018,20:40,"Barcelona to unveil Coutinho, the $192 million man",Philippe Coutinho will be unveiled as Barcelona's latest star recruit on Monday with coach Ernesto Valverde predicting the world's third most expensive footballer will comfortably fit into a team already containing global superstar Lionel Messi.,"The Brazilian playmaker was in the Spanish city on Sunday to tie up his 160-million-euro ($192 million) move from Liverpool but will only be presented on Monday to the media at 1130 GMT. ""Coutinho is a player who I think can bring a lot to us,"" said Valverde. ""He's an important signing."" Valverde admitted that it will be a challenge shoehorning the 25-year-old into a team which boasts the talents of Messi, Luis Suarez and Andres Iniesta. ""We'll wait until I see him train at least a day until we talk about all this. It's true I have seen him play in various positions -- on the right, the left, or in the middle, on the wings. ""We will evaluate all of this...but, of course, I don't think he will play as a goalkeeper."" Spanish league leaders Barca beat Levante 3-0 on Sunday at the Camp Nou, but Coutinho was not in the stands with the club wanting attention turned solely on the match and not their new recruit. But they still highlighted his arrival. ""Bem-vindo! Welcome! Benvingut! ¡Bienvenido!"" Barca tweeted to Coutinho along with a waving hand sign and a video showing a shirt bearing his name in a locker. The swoop for Coutinho -- which contains a 400-million-euro release clause -- is the third biggest transfer in football. It is outranked only by Paris Saint-Germain's world record 222m-euro signing of Neymar from Barcelona last year, and PSG's capture of French striker Kylian Mbappe for a deal that will eventually be worth 180 million euros. Rio-born Coutinho arrived at Liverpool from Inter Milan for a mere £8.5 million ($11.5 million) in January 2013 and scored 54 goals for the club in all competitions, although he won no silverware during his five-year stay at Anfield. One of the first Barcelona players to welcome the new recruit was compatriot Paulinho, who scored in Sunday's win. ""He's a great player, a magnificent player,"" said 29-year-old Paulinho. ""I am certain he will be a great help for Barcelona to reach their objectives. ""We hope to see him play with us as soon as possible."" Barcelona had tried to sign Coutinho last summer and his departure is a blow to Liverpool as he had just returned to top form after an injury-hit start to the season, scoring seven goals in the last eight games of 2017 to put his side firmly in the Champions League places. ""It is no secret that Philippe has wanted this move to happen since July, when Barcelona first made their interest known,"" said Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp. ""Philippe was insistent with me, the owners and even his teammates this was a move he was desperate to make happen."" For Barcelona, Coutinho's signing allows the club to move on from the bitter experience of losing his Brazil teammate Neymar to Qatar-backed PSG last summer. Coutinho's age is highly attractive to Barca, whose three main stars -- Messi, Suarez and Iniesta -- are all in their thirties. Iniesta will be 34 in May. French media group beIN Sports reported late Saturday that Liverpool will immediately spend 55 million euros of their windfall on Leicester City winger Riyad Mahrez. However, reports in England said Liverpool's main target to replace Coutinho is Monaco midfielder Thomas Lemar, who Arsenal tried to sign in August. Former Liverpool defender Phil Thompson said his old club had probably got the better deal and questioned Coutinho's decision to join Barca now because he will not be able to play in the Champions League for them this season having already appeared for Liverpool. Both clubs are in the last 16 of the competition. ""It's hard to get my head around what Philippe is going to gain because he can't play Champions League football for them, they are running away with the league, and he's got the World Cup at the end of the season,"" Thompson said on Sky Sports. ""Will he play regularly every week at Barcelona? I'm not too sure. Philippe could have carried on (at Liverpool). He could have been playing in the Champions League."""
537,07/01/2018,19:52,Barca's Valverde hails Coutinho signing,Barcelona coach Ernesto Valverde is looking forward to working with Philippe Coutinho after the club announced his arrival in a record-breaking deal on Saturday.,"Coutinho, 25, will move from Liverpool in a deal worth 160 million euros ($192 million), the third-biggest transfer in football history and a club record deal for Barcelona. The Brazilian has agreed a contract through to 2023 at the Camp Nou, with Barcelona fans seeing him as the long-term successor to Andres Iniesta, and Valverde is aiming to make the most of the Brazilian's adaptability and ability to play in a range of positions. ""I think he can bring a lot to the team. He scores and sets up goals, and going forward he can help us a lot as he can play both inside and out wide,"" remarked Valverde after Barcelona's comfortable 3-0 La Liga win over Levante on Sunday. ""He is versatile and we can take advantage of his versatility."" The deal had been in the pipeline for months, with Barca failing with several bids in August after losing Neymar to Paris Saint-Germain in a world-record 222 million-euro deal. And having previously tried to avoid talking about Coutinho, Valverde can now look forward to welcoming him into his squad for a busy second half of the season. ""It is a signing that has been talked about for a long time, although it was not something I was keen to discuss,"" said Valverde, whose team are still unbeaten in La Liga and sit nine points clear of Atletico Madrid at the top of the table. ""He is here now, and good luck to him, because if he has luck then it will be good for us."" Capable of playing on the wing and in a more withdrawn midfield role, Coutinho's arrival provides a wealth of new options to Valverde, although he will not be able to play in the Champions League knockout phase having already featured in the competition for Liverpool. ""We will wait until I have seen him train for a day at least until we talk about that,"" added Valverde when pressed on where the ex-Inter Milan man would fit into his team. ""It is true that I have seen videos of him playing in different positions, for Liverpool and for his country. But let's wait and see. ""I hope he adapts quickly, although good players adapt quickly to any circumstances."" Lionel Messi sent Barca on their way to victory against Levante with a goal on his 400th La Liga appearance, which was followed up by strikes from Luis Suarez and Paulinho. Paulinho, a team-mate of Coutinho's with Brazil, said: ""He is a great player, a magnificent player. I am certain he will really help Barca to attain our objectives this season. We hope to see him playing for us as soon as possible."""
538,03/01/2018,18:56,"Coutinho? I prefer my players, says Barca coach Valverde","Barcelona coach Ernesto Valverde shrugged off speculation over an imminent swoop for Liverpool star Philippe Coutinho on Wednesday by insisting: ""I prefer the players I currently have in the team.""","Brazilian international forward Coutinho has been linked with a 150 million euro (£134 million; $180 million) switch to the Spanish giants in the current transfer window just as he was when the English side thwarted a series of approaches from Barca last summer. ""I have nothing to say on the subject of Coutinho, he isn't one of our players,"" said Valverde. ""He is at another team and we respect the fact that he is at another team. He is a great player and we don't know what is going to happen in the future. ""However, I much prefer the players that I currently have in my team and they are the ones who concern me."" Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp has also refused to get caught up in the feverish speculation over the 25-year-old's immediate future. Rumours of a move to the Camp Nou were fuelled by pictures -- subsequently removed -- of a Barcelona shirt with Coutinho's name appearing on the website of Nike, the Catalan club's kit manufacturer, over the weekend. ""I heard about it. Somebody told me and I thought 'wow'. But I couldn't be less interested in anything in the world!"" Klopp said."
539,02/01/2018,20:28,Barcelona's Dembele set for Copa del Rey comeback,"Barcelona striker Ousmane Dembele, who has been sidelined since September, has been cleared to make his comeback in Thursday's Copa del Rey clash against Celta Vigo.","The French international has not played since tearing his hamstring at Getafe on September 16, just three games into his Barca career following a 105-million-euro ($124 million) move from Borussia Dortmund that could rise to as much as 145 million euros. ""After a lengthy recovery process from an injury to the femoral biceps on his left thigh, the 20-year-old Frenchman is now available for (Barcelona coach) Ernesto Valverde,"" Barcelona said on Tuesday. Holders Barcelona will face Celta Vigo, coached by former Barca goalkeeper and assistant manager Juan Carlos Unzue, in the last 16 of the Copa del Rey, the Spanish Cup."
540,31/12/2017,16:15,Nike advertise Coutinho Barcelona shirt,An apparent gaffe by Nike has fired speculation that Philippe Coutinho could leave Liverpool for Barcelona in the January transfer window.,"The sportswear giant, who manufacture Barcelona's kit, advertised a Barca shirt on their website with the Brazilian midfielder's name on it. Headlined ""Where the magic happens"", the page, which has since been taken down, continued with the message: ""Philippe Coutinho is ready to light up Camp Nou."" Coutinho is sponsored by Nike and wears their boots. He handed in a transfer request in August after Barcelona had a bid for the Brazilian rejected, but the Reds then turned down a further two offers. The current La Liga leaders had offered over £100 million ($135 million), but Liverpool owners Fenway Sports Group publicly stated Coutinho was not for sale. The 25-year-old missed the start of the season with a back problem but has been in outstanding form recently, scoring seven goals in his last eight games."
541,23/12/2017,16:53,Hurting Madrid refuse to throw in the towel - Zidane,Real Madrid boss Zinedine Zidane accepted responsibility for a bruising 3-0 El Clasico defeat on Saturday that left the European champions 14 points adrift of Barcelona at the top of La Liga on Saturday.,"However, the Frenchman insisted Madrid will come back stronger in the new year after La Liga's winter break and refused to concede the league to Barca. ""We are down because it is a defeat that hurts,"" said Madrid boss Zinedine Zidane. ""Madrid never give up, whatever happens. It is a difficult moment because we've lost by three goals. I could say we don't deserve it, but that is football."" Defeat leaves Madrid still down in fourth with Barca now nine points clear of their closest challengers Atletico Madrid. Zidane took the surprise decision to start Mateo Kovacic for the first time in La Liga this season to try negate the threat of Lionel Messi as the Croatian had so successfully when Real thrashed Barca 5-1 in the Spanish Super Cup on aggregate in August. However, after Madrid missed a host of first-half chances, Kovacic was powerless to stop Messi wrestling control of the game as the Argentine netted from the penalty spot after Luis Suarez's opener and then teed up Aleix Vidal for Barca's third in stoppage time ""Tomorrow they are going to hammer me, that is football but it won't change how I think or what I do,"" added Zidane. ""I am the coach and I will continue like this as long as I am here."" Any chance of a Real recovery after Suarez's opener was dented as Dani Carvajal also saw a red card for punching the ball off the goal line before Messi's spot-kick. ""The first goal comes from an error by us and the sending-off completely changes the complexion of the game,"" added Zidane. ""Playing with 10 men 2-0 down is very difficult both mentally and physically."" A 3-0 defeat is also Zidane's heaviest since he took charge of Real nearly two years ago. However, there didn't appear to be such a margin between the sides in the first 45 minutes as Madrid dominated. Cristiano Ronaldo miskicked with the goal at his mercy after just 10 minutes and Karim Benzema hit the post just before half-time. ""They pressed us very high and it forced us to play long,"" said Barca boss Ernesto Valverde. ""We couldn't play as we are used to. It was an open game with no side in command, but in the second-half we managed to impose our control on the game."" Valverde refused to accept he had tactically outfoxed Zidane and insisted Barca can't celebrate taking back the title from Madrid just yet with 21 league games still to come. ""Our intention is that no one beats us,"" he added when quizzed whether his side, on a 25-game unbeaten run, are capable of dropping enough points to led Madrid back into the title race ""Winning points is extremely difficult and losing them is easy. There is a long way to go."" However, whilst Messi once again shone, Valverde reserved special praise for Thomas Vermaelen who contributed to another clean sheet in the absence of the injured Samuel Umtiti. Vermaelen has been much-criticised since joining from Arsenal in 2014 for poor performances and unfortunate history of injuries. ""People ask me a lot about Vermaelen as if it seems something bad is going to happen. ""What I see is a player who trains well, plays, well, is strong and can play with the ball. ""At times in Barcelona we want to put on the bandage before there is a wound."""
542,23/12/2017,15:12,Dominant Barca move 14 points clear of Real Madrid,"Barcelona took a huge step towards regaining the La Liga title as goals from Luis Suarez, Lionel Messi and Aleix Vidal beat bitter rivals Real Madrid 3-0 at the Santiago Bernabeu on Saturday to open up a 14-point lead over the European champions.","In a recurring theme of this season Madrid were made to pay for Cristiano Ronaldo and Karim Benzema missing first-half chances as Barca took control after half-time. Suarez rounded off a flowing counter-attack to open the scoring before Messi blasted home a penalty after Madrid defender Dani Carvajal was sent-off for punching the ball off the goal line. And Messi was the creator as Vidal rubbed salt into Real's wounds deep into stoppage time. Victory extends Barca's unbeaten run to 25 games in all competitions as they moved nine points clear of second-placed Atletico Madrid and exacted revenge for a 5-1 thrashing on aggregate in the Spanish Super Cup at the hands of Real in August. Madrid do still have a game in hand over Barca to marginally reduce the gap at the top, but their efforts in the new year are now likely to be more focused on becoming the first side to win three consecutive Champions League titles in over 40 years. Despite the clash between the Spanish capital's and Catalonia's two giants taking place just two days after three parties favouring independence for the prosperous region from Spain retained an absolute majority in the Catalan parliament, there was little attention paid to politics inside the ground once the action got underway. Madrid fans unfurled a huge banner proclaiming it to be a ""white Christmas"" after they claimed a club record five trophies in 2017. However, it is Barca who will enjoy the upcoming winter break more after a second-half display which showed the turning of the tide their way since August has been no fluke. It could have been very different for the hosts if Cristino Ronaldo had buried a huge opportunity when he completely miskicked just 10 minutes in. Barca didn't threaten at all until the half hour mark when Messi finally found some room in a congested midfield to pick out Paulinho's late run and the Brazilian's acrobatic effort was matched by a flying save from Keylor Navas. Seconds later it was Marc-Andre ter Stegen to demonstrate why he has been one of the keys to Barca's success this season by getting an outstretched toe to turn Ronaldo's fiercely struck shot behind. Benzema was inches away from giving Real a half-time lead as he headed against the post two minutes before the break. However, Barca came out a different side in the second period to almost certainly put the title out of Madrid's reach. Nine minutes after the break Sergio Busquets's calm opened up the Madrid midfield as he fed Ivan Rakitic and Sergi Roberto eventually crossed to Suarez to apply the finishing touch. Suarez was spared the embarrassment of missing two huge chances in an incredible goal mouth scramble that led to Barca's second. Navas saved Suarez's first effort before he fired against the post with the goal at his mercy, but Paulinho's follow-up was punched off the line by Dani Carvajal. The Spanish international accepted his punishment of a red card and Messi dispatched the resulting penalty into the top corner to kill the game as a contest. Ter Stegen produced more heroics to ensure there was no Real fightback as he again denied Ronaldo. And Barca put the seal of a stunning victory in stoppage time when Vidal drove Messi's cut-back towards goal and the ball squeezed in under Navas."
543,23/12/2017,10:35,Madrid 'obliged' to win politicised El Clasico,"Real Madrid are ""obliged"" to beat Barcelona on Saturday (1200GMT) to maintain any hope of retaining La Liga in an El Clasico clash handed extra intrigue by the political cloud overshadowing ""the biggest game in world football"".","Barca could face an even more hostile atmosphere than normal in the capital in the wake of regional elections in Catalonia. Three parties favouring independence for the prosperous region from Spain retained an absolute majority in the Catalan parliament on Thursday. On the field, Madrid are the more needy side with the European champions trailing the league leaders by a mammoth 11 points at the top of La Liga albeit with a game in hand. ""It will be a massive game,"" said Real captain Ramos. ""It is the biggest game in the world. ""We are obliged to win more than ever for the situation we are in to try to keep ourselves in the fight for La Liga."" For the first time an El Clasico will kick-off at lunchtime as La Liga seeks more attention from Asian viewers with a potential audience of 650 million around the world tuning in to see Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi go head-to-head once more. And Ronaldo could be paired with Karim Benzema and Gareth Bale for the first time this season. Real's 'BBC' front three haven't played a single minute of action together, largely due to a series of injury problems for Bale. However, the Welshman returned to play his part in the Club World Cup success with the semi-final winner over Al Jazira. Ronaldo is also ""100 percent"" fit to play according to coach Zinedine Zidane despite the Portuguese returning to training with the rest of his teammates for the first time this week on Friday. ""He is 100 percent, he trained today and that is all that interests me,"" said Zidane, who unlike Ramos has tried to play down suggestions Madrid must win to remain in the title race. Barca boss Ernesto Valverde believes the spectacle on the field will not be affected by the reception the Catalan giants receive. Valverde's men also visited Madrid in October to face Atletico Madrid without problems amid heightened political tension following violent clashes in a banned independence referendum called by separatists. ""The atmosphere tomorrow will be good, I have no doubt about that,"" said Valverde. ""We went to play at Atletico Madrid close to October 1 when there was a lot of talk about the reception we would get and I think as a football man it is one of the best atmospheres I have seen. There was a good feeling between the teams, the fans and I expect tomorrow will be the same."" Madrid were the last side to beat Barca and in some style with a 5-1 aggregate thrashing in the Spanish Super Cup back in August. But, since then, the Catalans have bounced back under Valverde's guidance to go 24 games unbeaten in all competitions. To recover from Neymar's departure to Paris Saint-Germain for a world record fee, Barca have become ever more reliant on the brilliance of Messi and the Argentine has responded with 18 goals already this season. ""It will be important for us to win this game for what it means,"" said Messi as he picked up his award for being the top scorer in La Liga last season this week. ""A game against Madrid is special, it is at their place and we would take a significant advantage over them if we win."""
544,22/12/2017,15:03,Ronaldo 100 percent fit and has Real's respect - Zidane,Real Madrid coach Zinedine Zidane insisted Cristiano Ronaldo is 100 percent fit for Saturday's huge El Clasico clash against Barcelona despite playing a limited role in training this week.,"And the Frenchman urged Ronaldo to put his perceived desire for an improved contract from the European champions on the back burner to help Real get back into the La Liga title race. ""He is 100 percent, he trained today and that is all that interests me,"" Zidane said on Friday. Ronaldo, 32, said he would like to retire at Real after scoring the winner in last weekend's Club World Cup final, but that decision depended on those that run the club. The Portuguese star signed a new deal to 2021 with Real just over a year ago, but has since seen Neymar's move to Paris Saint Germain for a world record fee and a bumper new deal for Lionel Messi at Barcelona reportedly see them leapfrog Ronaldo as the world's best paid player. ""Cristiano just has to think about what he has done, what he is doing and what he means to this club,"" added Zidane. ""He deserves the full respect of the club and he has it. After the holidays we will talk about that for sure. At the moment the only important thing is the game tomorrow and for that he is 100 percent."" Ronaldo only returned to full training on Friday after receiving some rough treatment from Brazilians Gremio last weekend. However, he has rediscovered top form in recent weeks with five goals in his last four outings. Zidane's men trail Barca by 11 points in fourth place behind Atletico Madrid and Valencia, but they do have a game in hand on their rivals. Real captain Sergio Ramos claimed this week his side are ""obliged to win more than ever"" given their deficit in the title race, but Zidane claimed tomorrow's result won't be definitive no matter what happens. ""There is no anxiety. We need to think about playing a good match and not look at whether the difference is 11, eight or 25 points,"" said Zidane. ""The only thing we can control is playing well tomorrow."" Barca are undefeated in their last 24 games. However, they were beaten in both legs as Real romped to victory 5-1 on aggregate in the Spanish Super Cup in coach Ernesto Valverde's first two games in charge back in August. Back then Barca were mired in institutional crisis caused by Neymar's departure. Yet, Valverde has cannily reconstructed the Catalans around a sold defensive base that has conceded just eight goals in that 24-game unbeaten run and relied on the brilliance of Messi going forward. ""It's true that at the time we had just lost an important player for the team and we had the negative result here that conditioned the tie. At their place, they played very well and were the better team,"" said Valverde. ""Since then we have got better bit-by-bit and got the results that mean we are top of the league."" The tension on the field could be accompanied by an even more hostile atmosphere for Barca than normal in the capital in the wake of regional elections in Catalonia that saw three parties favouring independence for the region from Spain retain an absolute majority in the Catalan parliament. However, Valverde played down concerns as Barca also visited to Madrid to face Atletico in October without problems amid heightened political tension following violent clashes in a banned independence referendum called by separatists. ""The atmosphere tomorrow will be good, I have no doubt about that,"" he added. ""We went to play at Atletico Madrid close to October 1 when there was a lot of talk about the reception we would get and I think as a football man it is one of the best atmospheres I have seen. There was a good feeling between the teams, the fans and I expect tomorrow will be the same. ""Logically the Bernabeu will support their team, but I think it will be a good game."""
545,22/12/2017,12:05,Ronaldo back in Real training ahead of El Clasico,Cristiano Ronaldo returned to full training on Friday with his Real Madrid teammates to quash fears he could miss Saturday's huge El Clasico clash with Barcelona at Real's Santiago Bernabeu.,"The world player of the year received rough treatment as he scored the winner in the Club World Cup final over Brazilians Gremio last weekend, but Ronaldo had insisted he would be fit for the lunchtime visit of league leaders Barca. Ronaldo didn't train with the rest of the Madrid squad on Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday as a precaution. Madrid will need Ronaldo in the form he has shown of late having scored five goals in his last four games as the European champions look to claw their way back into the title race. Zinedine Zidane's men trail Barca by 11 points and are in fourth place also behind Atletico Madrid and Valencia, but they do have a game in hand on their rivals."
546,22/12/2017,02:20,Barca tempted by Griezmann as transfer window set to open,Barcelona are making moves to bring Atletico Madrid star Antoine Griezmann to the Catalan capital while Manchester City are eyeing Alexis Sanchez as clubs around Europe prepare for the January transfer window.,"The winter window opens at one minute past midnight on January 1, but Barca are looking for a belated Christmas present in the France international. Both players will likely move in the summer but deals could be struck in January, with Sanchez holding out for a reported £400,000-per-week ($535,000) deal from the runaway Premier League leaders when his contract runs out at the end of the season. Mundo Deportivo claimed Barca president Josep Maria Bartomeu has had dinner with Griezmann's parents and sister, who manages the player's affairs, and the club are looking to tie him down to a deal that would see him move in the summer. Not even Atletico's complaint to FIFA about Barca's public pursual of their star is likely to stop the move from happening, with Barca director Guillermo Amor as good as admitting the meeting took place. In August, Griezmann's former agent Eric Ohalts revealed that the France forward would have moved to Manchester United in the summer had FIFA not upheld a transfer ban that stopped the Madrid club from buying any reinforcements, and now Barca are ready to swoop. Barca still have full coffers after receiving 222 million euros ($263 million) from the world record-busting sale of Neymar to Paris Saint-Germain and Griezmann's 100 million euros buyout clause means the club only need to agree personal terms, avoiding the problems they encountered when they failed to sign Philippe Coutinho from Liverpool in August. Barcelona are however still keeping tabs on Coutinho and could make a lower bid than the 100 million euros they were prepared to pay in the summer. After the Neymar signing, Paris Saint-Germain have got to sell players to comply with Financial Fair Play (FFP) rules. Inter Milan are among those looking at PSG midfielder Javier Pastore, who admitted last month he was ""disappointed"" at his lack of first-team action. PSG coach Unai Emery admitted that Brazilian midfielder Lucas Moura and French international striker Hatem Ben Arfa are interested in leaving in January, but said nothing about Pastore and Angel Di Maria, who has expressed his annoyance at being forced out of the first team by new arrivals Neymar and Kylian Mbappe. Liverpool and Arsenal are keen on PSG's Julian Draxler, but the German international has revealed that he has no plans to leave Paris after finding a new role in Emery's team. The Qatari-backed Parisians were rumoured to be interested in AC Milan's rising star goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma, but after reports of the stopper complaining about being coerced into signing his summer six million-euro contract extension, the club and player -- and crucially his powerful agent Mino Raiola -- have made moves towards a reconciliation. PSG have given themselves an FFP boost after agreeing the 35-million-euro sale of 21-year-old talent Gonzalo Guedes with Valencia, where the Portugal international is currently on loan from the Ligue 1 leaders. The sharks are circling Arsenal, as not just Sanchez but other attacking stars Mesut Ozil and Olivier Giroud head towards potential Gunners exits. City were denied Sanchez on the summer's deadline day, but City boss Pep Guardiola has indicated he may now wait until the summer before making his move. Sanchez is reportedly unhappy at Arsenal, and the London club are prepared to open negotiations with City -- knowing that Chelsea and Real Madrid are also both interested -- to avoid seeing the Chilean star leave on a free transfer in the close season. City's local rivals Manchester United are looking at the Gunners' other attacking star Ozil, with Henrikh Mkhitaryan the likely player to make way for the Germany international. United boss Jose Mourinho is a long-time admirer of his former Real Madrid charge but the Reds could wait until his contract expires at the end of the season if no-one else makes a winter move. Giroud could leave as Borussia Dortmund look for a partner for star striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang. Chelsea's attacking dynamo Eden Hazard is a top target for Real Madrid, and should the Belgian make a post-World Cup move to Spain, Real's Marco Asensio is keen on joining Guardiola at City. Real are not normally a club that does business in the winter window. Chelsea are pondering an £80 million bid for Monaco star Thomas Lemar, with Blues striker Michy Batshuayi a potential makeweight as he seeks first-team football to boost his chances of making the Belgian World Cup squad. Crystal Palace winger Wilfried Zaha is also a target for Antonio Conte's side, as is Southampton defender Virgil van Dijk, who was denied a summer move to Liverpool, while out-of-favour Blues centre-back David Luiz has Juventus and Real Madrid keen on his signature."
547,21/12/2017,16:10,Ronaldo fitness worry ahead of Clasico,"Cristiano Ronaldo trained alone on Thursday ahead of Real Madrid's clash against Barcelona this weekend, after sustaining a knock to his calf during the Club World Cup in Abu Dhabi.","The Portugal star received rough treatment as he scored the winner in last Saturday's 1-0 victory over Brazilians Gremio in the final, but Ronaldo had insisted he would be fit for the visit of Barcelona. ""Cristiano Ronaldo trained alone out on the pitch, both with and without the ball,"" Real wrote on their website, two days ahead of Saturday's Clasico at the Santiago Bernabeu. Following Real's return to Spain, the five-time Ballon d'Or recipient had remained in the gym on Tuesday and Wednesday before finally lacing up his boots for an individual training session on Thursday. Spanish sports daily As reported it was simply a ""precaution"" as Real look to trim the 11-point gap between themselves and leaders Barcelona, who are unbeaten in La Liga this season. ""He will play in the Clasico barring last-minute surprise,"" the paper added. Zinedine Zidane's Real, who also trail Atletico Madrid and Valencia, are fourth in the table and realistically must win this weekend to remain in the running for the Spanish title."
548,21/12/2017,01:45,Madrid demands the best even of 'Galactico' groundsman,"""The expectations of Real Madrid are to have the best,"" they could easily be the words of world famous player or coach, but it is the club's English groundsman Paul Burgess who is reflecting on the demanding culture at the Spanish giants.","Burgess's work will be seen by an estimated television audience of 650 million people when newly crowned world champions Madrid host Barcelona in El Clasico on Saturday (1200GMT). However, he is used to dealing with that pressure having been lured to Real in Galatico style in 2009 after winning Premier League groundsman of the year three times in 12 years at Arsenal. ""Real Madrid and Spain is like the dream move for anybody whether it be the groundsman, the footballer or the press officer,"" Burgess told AFP on a cold and grey Madrid morning with preparations for the Clasico in full swing. ""That'll be the sunniest place in Madrid today,"" he added pointing to the rows of high-powered lights beaming down on one side of a pitch that has to cope with plus 40 degree heat in summer and freezing temperatures in winter. ""For El Clasico there is obviously more build-up, more cameras on the side of the pitch, everyone is talking about it so there is more pressure from the outside."" A two-week layoff since Real's last home game, though, has ensured Burgess's best work will be on show for the big day. ""The pitch for El Clasico will be better than say a Champions League game because for a Champions League game you have the opposition training the night before,"" he said. ""Going into El Clasico we've got a two-week build up, the conditions look pretty good so the pitch will be in great condition not only for Real Madrid but also for Barcelona. It will be a nice pitch and the best team will win."" The best team in recent times has tended to be Madrid, who have won five trophies in a calendar year in 2017 for the first time in the club's storied history. ""100 percent,"" joked the affable 39-year-old when quizzed as to how much success is down to him. ""I think the pitch certainly adds value, but the bottom line is the pitch is the same for both teams and it is down to the team to perform on the day. We do our best to give them what they want."" Unlike Real's star names and faces, though, Burgess tends to only get the criticism when things go wrong rather than acclaim as the trophies roll in. ""The only time I get feedback is if there is a problem. That is the correct way. I don't go round looking for compliments, I don't say to Cristiano (Ronaldo) 'nice goal'. That's his job and my job is to produce a good surface."" He recalls a ""tough"" conversation with Jose Mourinho on the eve of the Portuguese's first match in charge in 2010 due to a summer ""outbreak of disease"". However, the importance of a perfect pitch isn't just reflected in how good it looks on TV, but can be vital in keeping multi-million euro players fit. ""They are paying serious money for these guys and they want them playing football, not injured. Something like 80 percent of injuries are non-contact with another player, so the only contact is with the grass. ""That doesn't mean 80 percent of injuries are the fault of the grass, it could be bad diet, fatigue, but certainly a percentage is down to the pitch so it is very important we have dialogue between the medical department and my department to try and create consistent, comfortable surfaces for them to play on."" That desire to stop avoidable injuries has seen Burgess travel the world looking at the latest technologies to bring back to the Bernabeu and Madrid's vast Valdebebas training complex. ""I'm always trying to be a bit of a pioneer in my industry. By doing that you do make mistakes as well, but you try to be at the forefront of any new technology and Real Madrid reap the rewards of that. ""They invest in that, they should be applauded for what they are doing. They want to be the best and want to do everything they can to be the best."" Just like for players and coaches, that investment brings increased pressure. ""When you are working for a big club it is more extreme. If we win it is the best thing in the world, if we lose it's a disaster. ""I'm just part of that, but we have more good days than bad days and that's the important thing."""
549,20/12/2017,13:47,Five political El Clasico clashes,Real Madrid host Barcelona on Saturday (1200 GMT) in a match more laced with political tension than normal in the aftermath of local elections in Catalonia on Thursday called by the Spanish government to try and dissuade a drive for independence in the region.,"Here, AFP Sports looks at five other matches where political influence has hung over El Clasico. In June of 1943 Barca travelled to Madrid holding a 3-0 first leg lead in the semi-finals of the General's Cup, a precursor to today's Copa del Rey. Barca didn't just not make the final, they were smashed 11-1 in a record El Clasico defeat that remains to this day. As the name of the trophy suggests, it was in the early years of General Francisco Franco's dictatorship after Spain's brutal civil war (1936-1939). Years later, Barca players complained of not only being struck by missiles thrown from the crowd by being intimidated by the police and referee. Whilst Barca's Camp Nou became a haven for Catalan expression that was banned during Franco's dictatorship (1939-1975), Real Madrid enjoyed a golden age on the pitch including winning the first five European Cups. Much of that success was down to the signing of star Argentine forward Alfredo di Stefano, who ended up at Madrid after a bureaucratic tug of war between Barca and Real. Di Stefano had been playing for Colombian side Millonarios but had walked out on River Plate to join them so both clubs had to be compensated, whilst at one point the Spanish federation even decided Di Stefano should be shared by Barca and Madrid on a season-by-season basis. Barca eventually withdrew from the deal and counted the cost just weeks later as Di Stefano scored twice in a 5-0 thrashing in October 1953 as Real went onto win the league for the first time in 21 years. In 1970 Madrid were in the rare situation of needing to win the General's Cup to qualify for Europe after finishing fourth in La Liga. In the semi-finals they took a 2-0 lead into the second leg against Barca at the Camp Nou. The Catalans chances of a famous comeback were on course as they led 1-0 on the night until Basque referee Jose Emilio Guruceta Muro awarded a penalty to Madrid for a challenge that didn't appear to be a foul and occurred well outside the penalty area. Amancio Amaro converted the spot-kick provoking Barca captain Eladio to confront Guruceta for which he was sent-off. As the bad blood spilled over towards the end of the match, fans invaded the pitch and with police unable to stem the tide, Guruceta suspended the game five minutes from the end. Days later Barca were handed the maximum 90,000 peseta ($1,285) fine. However, Guruceta was also banned from refereeing for six months. In the years to come fans would chant ""Guruceta"" at referees to express their anger at bad decisions. Barca rode a wave of emotion to win the first Clasico following Franco's death on December 28, 1975. Carles Rexach, who would go onto be remembered as the man who signed Lionel Messi for Barca, scored the winning goal in the 89th minute for a 2-1 victory that was accompanied by a wash of Catalan flags. Barca's own website describes the game as ""the most wanted, dreamed of and applauded victory."" In October 2012, Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo shared four goals as the match ended 2-2, but a spectacle also unfolded off the field that has continued to this day. A month after 1.5 million people took the streets to support Catalonia's drive for independence, according to local police forces, chants in favour of independence rang around the Camp Nou in the 17th minute of each half to mark the fall of Catalonia in the Spanish War of Succession in 1714. That tradition has continued for the past five years and is even more vociferous for every visit by Madrid."
550,20/12/2017,02:10,Politically divided Spain united by El Clasico rivalry,"Often symbolised as pitting the pride of Catalonia against Spain's capital, the 'El Clasico' between Barcelona and Real Madrid is a match laced with political and social as much as sporting tension.","Even more so this week when the sides face off in Madrid on Saturday lunchtime just over 36 hours after polls will close in local elections in Catalonia that were called over the crisis caused by the region's drive for independence. ""They have a very strong ideological connection,"" political scientist Pablo Simon told AFP. ""On the one side are Real Madrid, who normally can be said to have a more conservative and nationalist fan base."" By contrast, Simon cites Barca's 'more than a club' motto as being rooted in a sense of Catalan identity. The sights and sounds of their Camp Nou and Santiago Bernabeu stadiums reflect that difference. In Barcelona, Catalan flags, including the independence-supporting Estelada, are commonly flown, while the crowd at Europe's biggest stadium chant in favour of independence in the 17th minute of each match to mark the fall of Catalonia in the Spanish War of Succession in 1714. At the Bernabeu, Spain flags are splattered across the stadium, while cries of ""Viva Espana"" rang around on October 1 in the hours following a violent crackdown by Spanish police forces on a referendum on independence called by separatists in Catalonia. However, for all their differences, El Clasico and particularly the fear of losing the matchup should Catalonia gain independence, unites both sets of fans. ""It is the derby of Spain and it feels like it is impossible to be neutral,"" Sid Lowe, a Spanish football journalist and author of the book ""Fear and Loathing in La Liga"" on the rivalry, told AFP. ""It is a unifying event. No-one wants to lose this game, even in the event of Catalan independence."" La Liga president Javier Tebas has repeatedly warned Barca would not be allowed to continue playing in the Spanish league if the drive for independence is followed through. However, that is a scenario both clubs refuse to envisage with many believing threats from Tebas, who attended a nationalist march earlier in the year, are aligned to his own political beliefs. ""I want to tell all members that the intention of the club is to continue playing in La Liga. Right now our participation is guaranteed,"" Barcelona president Josep Maria Bartomeu told the club's AGM in October. ""I can't contemplate a Spain without Catalonia, nor La Liga without Barca,"" Real Madrid president Florentino Perez told Spanish newspaper El Espanol. Bartomeu's board has tried to tread a fine line by defending Catalonia's institutions following the Spanish government's application of home rule, but also not coming out in favour of independence. Barca played Las Palmas behind closed doors on October 1 in protest at the violence at the polling stations. However, even outspoken pro-independence campaigners like former Barca president Joan Laporta have called for Barca to remain in La Liga. ""No one at Barcelona wants to lose this game even though that potentially contradicts their political or social position,"" added Lowe. The most-watched football match in the world will attract a potential TV audience of 650 million people who will tune in to see five-time Ballon d'Or winners Cristiano Ronaldo of Real and Barcelona's Lionel Messi. ""It paralyses normal life in Spain,"" added Simon. ""That's why we always recommend to go to the theatre or the cinema at that time because they will be empty."" Yet, the fact that what could happen to Barca, and by extension El Clasico, has played such a big role in the independence debate is a sign of the match's deeply-rooted importance to Spanish society as something more than just a sporting event. ""On the face of it the fact we are concerned about the impact for football from Catalan independence is absurd because there are so many other things to be worked through,"" added Lowe. ""Yet, it is the one that has occupied people the most. Will Barcelona still be in the league? Will there still be a Clasico? And no one wants that to be lost."""

""FC Barcelona and Hebei Fortune have reached an agreement for Javier Mascherano to move to the Chinese Super League for 10 million euros,"" Sport reported. ""However, the transfer will not be completed until Samuel Umtiti (currently injured) is back on the pitch or a new central defender is signed."" Colombian international Yerry Mina of Palmeiras and out-of-favour Manchester United defender Daley Blind are targets to relace the experienced Argentine, according to Sport. French international Umtiti is exepected to be out until the end of January with a torn hamstring suffered against Celta Vigo earlier this month. Mascherano joined Barca from Liverpool in 2010 and has won a total of 17 trophies with the Catalan giants, including four La Liga titles, four Copas del Rey, three Spanish Super Cups, two Champions Leagues, two European Super Cups and two Club World Cups."
552,19/12/2017,16:22,Atletico report Barca for illegal Griezmann approach,"Atletico Madrid reported Barcelona to football's governing body FIFA over illegal contact made to star forward Antoine Griezmann, Atletico club sources confirmed on Tuesday.","""The complaint has been presented for repeated contact between Barcelona, the player and his team,"" an Atletico source told AFP. Griezmann renewed his contract until 2022 in June and Atletico consider contact made by Barcelona not only breaks FIFA's rules, but could also affect the integrity of La Liga. Barcelona lead the league with Atletico their closest challengers six points behind in second. ""He is a player under a long contract and this can't happen. Moreover, the club considers that it could affect the competition where Barca are currently top and Atletico second,"" added the Atletico source. Barca were slapped with a one-year transfer ban for the illegal recruitment of foreign minors by FIFA that was served in 2015. Should the Catalan giants be found guilty, they could be handed another ban on registering new players. Barcelona-based sports daily Mundo Deportivo reported on Sunday that Barca's president Josep Maria Bartomeu had recently met with Griezmann's family. The Catalan giants are expected to be willing to pay the French international's 100 million euro ($117.8 million) buyout clause at the end of the season to avoid negotiating with Atletico. Barca's director of institutional relations Guillermo Amor turned down the opportunity to deny a meeting had taken place later on Sunday after Barca's 4-0 thrashing of Deportivo la Coruna. ""If the paper says it then it is possible it is like that,"" Amor told Movistar TV. ""There could have been a coming together."" Griezmann, 26, agreed to sign a new contract with Atletico in June after the club had an appeal against a transfer ban rejected. Top scorer at Euro 2016, Griezmann said it would have been ""dirty"" to walk out on the club when they couldn't replace him until January. However, Atletico coach Diego Simeone accepted last week that Griezmann's departure at some point in the future is inevitable. ""Of course Griezmann will be able to leave at some point, as Diego Costa, Diego Ribas and Arda Turan have gone,"" Simeone told French sports daily L'Equipe. ""If a player comes to me and says, 'coach, I have a chance of a lifetime and want to leave', and if he's left everything on the pitch for me like Griezmann, I'll say, 'no problem'."" Griezmann has scored 90 goals in 179 games for Atletico since joining from Real Sociedad in 2014 and led Los Rojiblancos to the 2016 Champions League final, scoring twice to eliminated Barca in the quarter-finals. However, he was also caught up in a Twitter storm on Sunday after posting a picture of himself blacked up and mimicking a Harlem Globetrotter basketball player from the 1980s. ""I recognise that it was clumsy of me. If I have offended people, I apologise,"" he wrote shortly after and deleted the photo after receiving a wave of criticism."
553,19/12/2017,02:50,La Liga chases Asian cash with early Clasico kick-off,"For the first time, Spanish football's showpiece event, El Clasico between giants Real Madrid and Barcelona, has been scheduled for a lunchtime kick-off (1200GMT) on Saturday as La Liga seeks to capture Asia's attention and its cash.","""We are keen to provide our fans in Asia the opportunity to watch Real Madrid and Barcelona face off at a time that is convenient to them,"" La Liga's Chief Communications Officer Joris Evers told AFP. With a potential television audience of 650 million people, according to La Liga, El Clasico is the most watched club match around the world thanks to its unique mixture of star protagonists and a fierce rivalry fostered over decades both on the field and off it by the distinct cultural differences between Catalonia and Madrid. ""It is the ideal shop window, the marquee match to show to people Spanish football,"" Jose Maria Gay de Liebana, professor of economics at Barcelona University and an expert in Spanish football finances, said to AFP. However, it is not just a boom in lucrative television rights that La Liga and its two biggest clubs are seeking with an early start this weekend, but a showcase for all of their lucrative sponsorship contracts. Last year Barcelona signed a club record shirt sponsorship deal worth a minimum of 220 million euros ($258 million) over four years with Japanese online retailer Rakuten. ""They want to sell their products to international markets, above all in Asia,"" added Gay de Liebana. According to a study carried out by consumer analytics specialists Nielsen Sports, last season's corresponding first La Liga Clasico of the season generated more than $42.5 million in media value for sponsors. ""The kick-off of the next El Clasico on December 23 is at 1300 Madrid time, 2000 in Shanghai, 1900 in Jakarta and 1730 in New Delhi,"" continued Evers. ""These are all locations where we know there are many La Liga fans and where we will be hosting events to celebrate El Clasico. ""Additional events are being held in various locations around Asia. Through this and other initiatives we want to make existing fans even bigger La Liga supporters and, of course, we want to attract new supporters as well."" Such events are a sign of La Liga's awareness of how the Spanish top flight lags behind England's cash rich Premier League in the battle for Asian based fans. The Premier League's estimated $3.9 billion income from domestic and international TV rights a season dwarfs La Liga's $1.9 billion revenue. Moreover, whilst Asia is the Premier League's biggest international market, it trails behind the Americas and the rest of Europe in La Liga's rights deals. ""We have changed kick-off schedules so that they can be seen at reasonable times here in Asia and we will continue to take steps to ensure that this part of the world can enjoy La Liga as much as possible,"" La Liga president Javier Tebas said at the opening of the league's new Singapore office earlier this year, just one of a series of new La Liga bases across the world. Tebas is acutely aware that Spain's privileged position at the top of the European game is coming under threat from the Premier League's economic power. He has repeatedly warned the Premier League could become the NBA of European football, capable of poaching Barca and Madrid's stars like Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo in the same way Barca were powerless to stop Qatar-backed Paris Saint Germain paying a world record 222 million euros for Neymar in August. Madrid and Barca have combined to win the Champions League in seven of the past 12 years. However, for the first time ever England will have five of the last 16 of the competition in 2018. However, Gay de Liebana believes La Liga's focus shouldn't rest solely on Asia, but take advantage of the cultural and linguistic advantages they have in Latin American markets, from where many of its current stars like Messi and Uruguay's Luis Suarez hail. ""They have to gamble and look towards South and Latin America. They are emerging countries where there is a rising middle class and greater spending power,"" he added."

""FC Barcelona player Rafinha was medically cleared by doctors on Monday,"" the club said in a statement. ""After an arthroscopic procedure to fix the injury to his internal meniscus, the Brazilian midfielder has been working hard in order to be able to return to action."" Rafinha is expected to have to wait until the new year to make his return, though, with Barca boss Ernesto Valverde insisting he doesn't want to take any risks for this weekend's El Clasico away to Real Madrid."

However, Barca appear willing to meet his 100 million euro ($118 million) buyout clause as they seek to again unite Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez with a prolific attacker following the departure of Neymar to Paris Saint-Germain in August for a world record 222 million euros. ""Barca settled on Griezmann as an objective for 2018 and they spoke with his entourage to see if he was willing to wear the blue and red shirt,"" reported Barcelona-based Mundo Deportivo. ""After receiving a 'yes' in response, an agreement was reached with the French goalscorer involving Pep Segura, Barca's general manager, and Robert Fernandez, the director of football. ""President Josep Maria Bartomeu has now entered to finalise the operation."" the newspaper reported adding that ""Bartomeu met recently with Griezmann's family to eat in Barcelona."" Griezmann, 26, agreed to sign a new contract with Atletico in June after the club had an appeal against a transfer ban rejected. The top scorer at Euro 2016, Griezmann said it would have been ""dirty"" to walk out on the club when they couldn't replace him until January. However, Atletico coach Diego Simeone accepted this week that Griezmann's departure is inevitable. Many of Atletico's other outstanding players, including strikers Fernando Torres, Sergio Aguero, Radamel Falcao and Diego Costa, have also left in recent years for pastures new. ""Of course Griezmann will be able to leave at some point, as Diego Costa, Diego Ribas and Arda Turan have gone,"" Simeone told French sports daily L'Equipe. ""If a player comes to me and says, 'coach, I have a chance of a lifetime and want to leave', and if he's left everything on the pitch for me like Griezmann, I'll say, 'no problem'."" Atletico are also likely to come under financial pressure to sell after moving into a new 310-million euro stadium in September and falling to make it into the last 16 of the Champions League for the first time in five years. The club have also already committed to nearly 100 million euros in transfers for January with Costa returning from Chelsea and Spanish international Vitolo joining from Sevilla."

""We are staying with the same plan. We think he will be ready in January,"" said Valverde on Saturday after Dembele returned to training this week. ""Any other plan would be premature and run a risk."" Victory over Deportivo la Coruna on Sunday will open up an 11-point advantage for the Catalans over Madrid ahead of their trip to the capital next weekend, albeit Real would have a game in hand. However, Valverde refused to admit that Barca can deliver a knockout blow to Madrid's chances of retaining the title with victory at the Bernabeu. ""We don't know what will happen, but our job is obviously to try and win both games,"" added Valverde. ""It doesn't concern me that people speak so much about the Clasico before tomorrow's game, but we won't make that mistake."""

Iniesta's last gasp equaliser eight years ago after Chelsea had been denied a series of penalty claims by Norwegian referee Tom Henning Ovrebo allowed Barca to reach the final on away goals as they completed the club's first ever treble of Champions League, La Liga and Copa del Rey. ""Great memories come to mind, some of the best that I could have experienced,"" Iniesta said on Wednesday. ""The first thing I thought after the draw was that it will be a very tough tie against a strong team in every sense."" Iniesta was absent through injury as Barca preserved their eight-point lead at the top of La Liga on Sunday. However, he expects to return for Deportivo la Coruna's visit to the Camp Nou on Sunday to get match sharp ahead of an El Clasico clash with Real Madrid to end Barca's year on December 23. ""I'm more or less ok, if I was completely fit I would be with the team (training). It wasn't really an injury but more of a niggle,"" he added. ""For Sunday I hope to be available.

And their pressure told when Suarez rounded off a fine team move before Messi blasted home a second to get the Catalans back to winning ways after successive draws with Valencia and Celta Vigo in La Liga. Valencia remain Barca's closest challengers five points back, but Atletico Madrid also maintained their title charge with a 1-0 win at Real Betis to stay six points off the top. Real Madrid are eight points back in fourth and Barca will have the chance to go into El Clasico away at Real in two weeks' time with an 11-point lead over their rivals. Barca host Deportivo la Coruna next weekend, whilst Madrid are in action at the Club World Cup in Abu Dhabi. Gerard Pique nearly gave Barca the perfect start at the Ceramic Stadium, where they have struggled in recent seasons, as his header came back off the crossbar from Messi's corner just four minutes in. However, Barca dominance of possession was largely stale before the break as Villarreal posed the greater threat on the counter-attack. Nicola Sansone had the hosts' best effort that forced Marc-Andre ter Stegen into a stunning one-handed stop high to his left. Messi orchestrated the visitors' attacking threat after the break as he constantly freed Jordi Alba down Barca's left. Paco Alcacer was denied by Sergio Asenjo from Alba's low cross before the left-back teed up Messi for a cushioned effort that drifted inches wide. Villarreal had to survive the final half hour a man light when Raba was dismissed for connecting with his studs on Busquets' ankle as the Spanish international cleared. Another Alba cross was turned onto the post by Suarez on the stretch. However, the Uruguayan finally broke Villarreal's resistance after exchanging a neat one-two with Alcacer to round Asenjo and net his seventh goal of the season. And Messi secured all three points seven minutes from time as he was played in by Busquets to smash past the helpless Asenjo. Earlier, Atletico bounced back from the disappointment of being dumped out of the Champions League in midweek to keep their title challenge afloat at Betis. The hosts dominated possession throughout but were made to pay for their lack of cutting edge, as well as some fine goalkeeping by Jan Oblak. By contrast, Atletico were clinical even in the absence of the injured Antoine Griezmann as Saul Niguez slid in at the back post to turn home Sime Vrsaljko's cross with their first serious attack on the half-hour mark. ""They played some spectacular football today, but we took advantage of the chance we had,"" Atletico midfielder Koke told BeIN Sports Spain. Betis posed more of a goal threat after the break but were denied by Oblak, who produced a wonder save to turn Cristian Tello's sweetly struck half-volley behind for a corner. ""One team had the ball, which was Betis, and they tried many different ways to damage us, but the team was very strong defensively,"" said Atletico boss Diego Simeone. At the other end of the table, Malaga and Athletic Bilbao secured big away wins to ease their relegation fears.

560,05/12/2017,23:24,Much-changed Barca still too good for Sporting,Barcelona rounded off an unbeaten Champions League group stage as Paco Alcacer's header and a late own goal from Jeremy Mathieu secured a 2-0 win over Sporting Lisbon on Tuesday.,"Juventus will join the Spanish giants in the last 16 after they too were 2-0 victors away at Olympiakos, relegating Sporting to the consolation of a place in the Europa League in the new year. With Barcelona already guaranteed top spot in Group D, Lionel Messi was left on the substitutes' bench for the second consecutive Champions League game as Ernesto Valverde made eight changes from the side that started Saturday's 2-2 draw with Celta Vigo. Sporting needed to inflict Barca's first home defeat in the Champions League for five years to have any chance of joining the Catalans in the knockout stages. However, the Portuguese side showed little ambition until falling behind. ""They were the ones that had the obligation to win the game, but they waited until making changes in the second half to try to beat us,"" Valverde told BeIN Sports Spain. ""We are always obliged to try and take the game to the opponents for the team we have and the style this club has played with for many years. ""Sometimes we do it in a more brilliant way than others, but our intention is always the same."" Barca pressed for an opener before the break but lacked the magic Messi so often provides to unlock a packed defence. Luis Suarez nearly provided the spark when he cut inside Uruguayan international teammate Sebastian Coates, but placed his shot too close to Sporting goalkeeper Rui Patricio. Alcacer opened the scoring just before the hour mark by flicking home Denis Suarez's corner at the near post past a helpless Patricio. And despite going in front, Valverde still handed Messi the final half-hour moments later as he replaced Aleix Vidal. Bas Dost had a huge chance to at least hand Sporting a point, but he was left hugging fellow Dutchman Jasper Cillessen in disbelief after the Barca 'keeper parried his effort from point-blank range. A fifth clean sheet in six Champions League games means Barca have so far proved the meanest defence in the competition. ""It is true we are performing well on that front and our goalkeepers are giving us a lot,"" added Valverde. ""Today Cillessen had an extraordinary save."" Messi was denied his 98th Champions League goal by a stunning stop from Patricio 10 minutes from time. However, Barca got hand a helping from one of their former players to round off the scoring in stoppage time when Mathieu turned Denis Suarez's cross into his own net with Alcacer waiting to apply the finishing touch once more."
561,04/12/2017,17:40,Mascherano still needed at Barcelona - Valverde,"Barcelona coach Ernesto Valverde has closed the door on Javier Mascherano leaving the Catalan giants in January due to Barca's lack of fit centre-backs, despite the defender suggesting that he wanted to end his time at the club.","Samuel Umtiti, who has replaced Mascherano as Gerard Pique's regular partner at the heart of the Barca defence, was ruled out for two months after tearing a hamstring in a 2-2 draw at home to Celta Vigo on Saturday. Mascherano himself is also currently sidelined with a hamstring injury, while former Arsenal captain Thomas Vermaelen has endured a series of injury problems since joining Barca in 2014. ""Masche is our player and we are counting on him. We want him to recover as soon as possible and a believe in him a lot,"" Valverde said on Monday ahead of Barca's Champions League clash with Sporting Lisbon on Tuesday. Mascherano had last week raised the possibility that his eight-year spell with Barcelona could be coming to an end due to his lack of game time this season. ""After so long it is clear I don't have much more to give to the club in the future,"" Mascherano told ESPN Deportes. ""I don't say that with a heavy heart, it is the opposite. I have had the most marvellous years of my career at this club. ""I am the type of person that knows when it is time to end an era."" However, Umtiti's absence means Mascherano is in line to start Barca's trip to Real Madrid on December 23, and Valverde is even evaluating whether to reinforce his central defence in January. ""We have time to assess. We know Sam's injury is a long one but he will return in January,"" added Valverde. ""When there are injuries it can change your plans, but, in principle, at the moment we are happy with what we have."" Barca are already assured of their place in the Champions League last 16 as Group D winners, meaning Valverde is likely to heavily rotate his side for Sporting's visit to the Camp Nou. The Portuguese side could join Barca in the last 16 with victory if Juventus fail to win away at Olympiakos. And Valverde raised the possibility that midfielder Sergio Busquets or left-back Lucas Digne could be called on as auxiliary centre-back options. ""Busquets has played at centre-back before, so has Digne. We know we have to look for solutions."""

However, rumours of a move back to Spain with the European champions surfaced after Neymar clashed with new strike partner and Suarez's international teammate Edison Cavani back in September. ""No, not at all,"" Suarez told Spanish sports daily Marca on Monday when asked about the prospect of Neymar moving to Madrid. ""Sincerely, I don't see it. I know how Neymar is and the admiration that he had for Barcelona and his teammates. I don't see him now going to play for Real Madrid."" Along with five-time World Player of the Year Lionel Messi, Suarez and Neymar formed one of the deadliest strike forces of all-time as they won two La Liga titles and a Champions League in three seasons together. However, despite a bitter fallout between the club and Neymar after PSG paid the Brazilian's buyout clause, Suarez insists he has only admiration and love for his former colleague. ""Ney is now mature enough and was completely aware of the decision he took,"" added Suarez. ""I am sure it was painful because he was happy here, but we all have to accept that he had other challenges he wanted to take on. ""It was an understandable decision that he took with his family. There is no reproach, only admiration and pure love for what he gave this club and the relationship we had during those years."" And Suarez said he had no role in calming tensions between Cavani and Neymar. ""No, I was an outsider. They weren't situations that I could control."""
564,03/12/2017,13:20,Iniesta sidelined by calf strain,"Barcelona captain Andres Iniesta will miss Tuesday's Champions League meeting with Sporting Lisbon, the Catalan giants confirmed on Sunday.","Iniesta asked to be replaced early in the second-half of Barca's 2-2 draw at home to Celta Vigo on Saturday, but he could return as early as next weekend for a testing La Liga visit to Villarreal. ""Tests have confirmed that Andres Iniesta has a strain in the calf of his left leg. The player will be out for the next game,"" Barcelona said in a statement. Iniesta is unlikely to be the only Barca star left out for the visit of the Portuguese side with Ernesto Valverde's men already guaranteed top spot in Group D with a game to spare. However, injury problems are mounting for Valverde with influential centre-back Samuel Umtiti ruled out for two months after tearing his hamstring on Saturday."
565,02/12/2017,17:46,Umtiti eight-week absence rubs salt into Barca wounds,Barcelona's failure to beat Celta Vigo in a thrilling 2-2 draw at Camp Nou on Saturday was compounded by the news defender Samuel Umtiti will be sidelined for eight weeks due to a torn hamstring.,"Umtiti will now be absent for Barca's visit to Real Madrid in the first Clasico of the season on December 23. ""Tests have confirmed that first team player Samuel Umtiti has a right hamstring injury. The approximate time out is eight weeks,"" Barcelona said in a statement. In doubly bad luck for Barca, when the French international pulled up 20 minutes from time, Iago Aspas sprinted in behind the Barca defence and teed up Maxi Gomez to hand Celta a share of the points. ""It was a series of unfortunate incidents in the one move,"" lamented Barca boss Ernesto Valverde. Umtiti has been a rock at the heart of the Barca defence as the Catalans had conceded just six goals in their previous 20 games prior to Celta's visit. ""It is a problem to lose an important player like Samuel, who was in great form."" Umtiti will also miss La Liga clashes with Villarreal, Deportivo la Coruna, Levante, Real Sociedad, Real Betis and Alaves either side of Spain's winter break, as well as the last 16 and potentially the quarter-finals of the Copa del Rey should Barca progress. However, he should be fit to return for the Champions League last 16 in February with Barca already having secured their place in the knockout phase as Group D winners. Barca captain Andres Iniesta also asked to be replaced just five minutes into the second half. However, Valverde is more optimistic that his absence won't be a prolonged one. ""He asked for the change,"" said Valverde. ""We don't know if it is a significant injury or not because he then continued to play on for a little while longer."" Celta became the first visiting side in La Liga to take anything away from the Camp Nou since Real Madrid a year ago. ""They took advantage of counter-attacks and our mistakes, it is a shame,"" said Barca midfielder Sergio Busquets. Aspas sprung Barca's offside trap to put Celta in front on the break after Marc-Andre ter Stegen had produced a stunning save from Gomez after 20 minutes. However, Barca went on to dominate the rest of the game and turned the match around thanks to goals from Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez before Umtiti's unfortunate injury. ""We showed more, we went for the game more and we were more intense, but football is like this,"" added Busquets. ""It's not about what is fair, it is about who scores most goals. ""They scored twice, they were efficient and got a point."" Barca did remain unbeaten and opened a five-point lead at the top over Valencia. However, Valencia can whittle that down to two points with victory at Getafe on Sunday. Real and Atletico Madrid can close to within six points of the leaders with victory over Athletic Bilbao and Real Sociedad respectively later on Saturday."
566,01/12/2017,11:03,Five things to look out for in La Liga,Barcelona look to extend their four-point lead at the top of La Liga against an old friend turned foe in Celta Vigo coach Juan Carlos Unzue on Saturday.,"Meanwhile, Real Madrid travel to a struggling Athletic Bilbao with their eyes firmly on one of Athletic's rising stars. Here, AFP Sport looks at five things to look out for in La Liga this weekend. Gareth Bale's emergence off the bench to save a faltering young Real side from embarrassment against third-tier Fuenlabrada in the Copa del Rey earned the Welshman rave reviews in the Spanish press on Wednesday. Marca declared Bale had been handed a ""fresh start"" after a year dogged by a series of injuries. Yet, he could be absent again at San Mames due to a niggling calf problem having missed training for the past two days. Unlike Bale, Keylor Navas didn't help Madrid on his return to action after six weeks out by turning Fuenlabrada's opener into his own net in midweek. Kiko Casilla was also at fault for Malaga's second goal at the Bernabeu last weekend, intensifying Real's search for a new goalkeeper. According to reports, the new man will be Athletic's Kepa Arrizabalaga, who has been one of few shining lights in a hugely disappointing season for Bilbao. Arrizabalaga didn't feature as the Basques did suffer Cup humiliation at the hands of tiny islanders Formentera on Wednesday, edging coach Jose Angel Ziganda closer to the sack. Unzue returns to the Camp Nou hoping to continue Celta's record of beating Barca once in each of the three previous seasons when he was assistant to Luis Enrique. Celta's daring approach against the Catalans in recent years has though had mixed success. Whilst they have twice hit Barca for four at home, in their last two visits to the Catalan capital Celta have been smashed 6-1 and 5-0. Las Palmas are looking for already their third coach of the season after Pako Ayestaran was sacked on Thursday. Ayestaran was only appointed in September when Manuel Marquez resigned. How the Islanders must wish they had held on to the man they will face this weekend back when Quique Setien brings Real Betis to the Canary Islands. Setien not only kept Las Palmas up in the previous two seasons, but did so thanks to some thrilling attacking football. That has continued at Betis, whose 13 La Liga games this season have produced 50 goals. However, contractual differences with the board saw Setien walk out in the summer and left Las Palmas in the lurch. Valencia kept their unlikely title challenge alive by holding Barca at home last weekend. That point came at a cost, thought, as PSG loanee Goncalo Guedes suffered a broken toe that is expected to keep the Portuguese winger out for the rest of the year. Guedes's three goals and five assists have played a huge part in Valencia's revival. However, a kind fixture list during Guedes's absence offers Valencia hope with a visit to Getafe on Sunday followed by Celta, Eibar and Villarreal before the winter break."
567,29/11/2017,22:19,"Barca, Sevilla ease into Copa del Rey last 16",Holders Barcelona eased into the last 16 of the Copa del Rey by thrashing Real Murcia 5-0 at the Camp Nou on Wednesday to complete an 8-0 aggregate victory.,"Already leading 3-0 from the first leg, Barca boss Ernesto Valverde made 10 changes from Sunday's top-of-the-table clash at Valencia with Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez among those to drop out. Paco Alcacer kept up his fine strike rate this season with his fourth goal of the campaign from just over 400 minutes on the field when he headed home Aleix Vidal's pass on 16 minutes. Barca had to wait until 10 minutes into the second-half to double their advantage when captain for the night Gerard Pique tapped into an empty net from another Vidal cross. Vidal then completed a fine team move himself when he headed home Nelson Semedo's cross. And fine finishes from Denis Suarez and Jose Manuel Arnaiz rounded off the scoring. Wissam Ben Yedder scored twice in the opening six minutes as Sevilla cruised past Cartagena 4-0 to seal a 7-0 aggregate win in the absence of coach Eduardo Berizzo. Berizzo underwent surgery on a cancerous tumour of the prostate on Tuesday with his assistant Ernesto Marcucci taking charge whilst he recovers. Paulo Henrique Ganso and Joaquin Correa were also on target for the five-time winners. Third tier Lleida pulled off a stunning comeback and the upset of the Cup so far by overcoming a 2-0 deficit on the night and 3-0 on aggregate to oust Real Sociedad on away goals. Diego Llorente and Juanmi put the La Liga side in a commanding position before half-time, but second-half goals from Aitor Nunez, Manu Molina and Bojan Radulovic handed Lleida a famous win. The returning Gareth Bale helped Real Madrid overcome a scare of their own to reach the last 16 on Tuesday despite being held 2-2 at the Santiago Bernabeu by Fuenlabrada in a 4-2 aggregate win. Celta Vigo, Leganes, Levante and Numancia have also sealed their places in the last 16."
568,27/11/2017,01:11,Valverde proud at Barca's response to ghost goal fury,Barcelona coach Ernesto Valverde praised his side's temperament to bounce back from being denied a clear opening goal scored by Lionel Messi and falling behind to salvage a 1-1 draw at Valencia on Sunday.,"A point maintains Barca's four-point lead over Valencia at the top of La Liga, but the Catalans were forced to do it the hard way after Messi's 30th minute strike that slipped through Valencia 'keeper Neto's legs was somehow not seen to have crossed the line by the officials. Unlike in Europe's other top leagues, La Liga has so far refused to introduce goal line technology due to cost concerns. ""Messi's goal was very clear,"" said Valverde. ""The important thing is to not let the tension of the game overcome you and we didn't lose our concentration against a very strong opponent."" ""It was a good game, a little marred by one controversial moment."" ""We know the potential Valencia have at home and although we don't go away completely satisfied, we managed to take something positive from the game."" After a first-half performance well below the form they have shown so far this season, Valencia improved markedly after half-time and went in front when Rodrigo tapped home from close range. However, Barca responded to protect their unbeaten record in La Liga this season when Messi's splendid pass was volleyed home by former Valencia left-back Jordi Alba eight minutes from time. ""It was a monumental error by the referee,"" blasted Alba to Movistar. ""Even I could see it was in from the middle of the pitch. We saw the replay at half-time and it's clear."" La Liga intends to introduce video assistant refereeing (VAR) for controversial decisions next season. However, Barca midfielder Sergio Busquets believes that is too late for a league that likes to market itself as the best in the world thanks to the presence of Messi and Real Madrid's Cristiano Ronaldo. ""La Liga has the best players in the world and the best league also deserves the best technology,"" said Busquets. A share of the spoils allows Real Madrid and Atletico Madrid to close back to within eight points of Barca at the top of the table. Yet, Alba believes Valencia's stunning start to the season means they deserve to be treated as title contenders. ""I played here for many years and it is always difficult to win here,"" added the Spanish international. ""They are clear candidates. There is a long way to go, but they are well organised and know what they want to do."" Valencia boss Marcelino Garcia Toral, who has rejuvenated Los Che after two seasons in the doldrums, was forced to watch from the stands as he served a touchline ban. Assistant coach Ruben Uria admitted the hosts had been handed a huge slice of luck and also backed the introduction of technology as soon as possible. ""It is a shame that these situations still arise."" ""We are in favour of technology and this time it has fallen in our favour."""
569,25/11/2017,12:26,Messi extends Barcelona contract until 2021,"Lionel Messi ended months of speculation when finally putting pen to paper on Saturday to extend his contract with Barcelona until 2021, the club announced, making official an agreement reached in July.","Barca had announced in the summer that Messi, 30, had committed his future to the club but the Argentine had not signed the new deal. With his previous contract set to expire in 2018, Messi could have left Barca for free next summer had he not extended his deal. ""FC Barcelona and Lionel Messi signed on Saturday morning a new contract that will keep the Argentinian superstar at the club through the 2020/21 season,"" read a club statement. ""The buyout clause was set at 700 million euros ($835 million)."" The steep rise in the five-time World Player of the Year's buyout clause is designed to avoid any repeat of Paris Saint-Germain's capture of Neymar from Barcelona by paying the Brazilian's 222 million-euro buyout clause in August. Barca first announced an agreement with Messi back on July 5, but pressure has been mounting on beleaguered club president Josep Maria Bartomeu to get Messi to put pen to paper after a turbulent summer for the Catalans. Neymar's departure sparked an institutional crisis and Bartomeu was heavily criticised for failing to ward off PSG with a higher buyout clause and a haphazard search for replacements in the final weeks of the transfer window. Bartomeu did though manage to see off a vote of no confidence measure launched by disgruntled fans thanks to Barca's fantastic start to the season, in large part inspired by Messi's form. Bartomeu had previously claimed the deal was all ""agreed and signed"" via Messi's father and agent Jorge Horacio Messi. Yet, to eradicate any doubts, Bartomeu now also has the image he craved of a smiling Messi tying the remainder of his peak years to the club. Messi's 30 trophies are, along with teammate Andres Iniesta, the most in Barca's history, including eight La Liga and four Champions League titles. The diminutive Argentine, who joined Barca at the age of 13, has also smashed 523 goals in 602 games to become the Catalans' all-time top goalscorer. ""Obviously, a lot of time has passed and a lot of things have happened, both on and off the pitch since then, but the excitement and desire remains the same,"" Messi told Spanish sports daily Marca on Saturday, a day after picking up his fourth golden boot as the top goalscorer in Europe last season. News of Messi's renewal also comes as a huge boost to the leaders of La Liga ahead of Sunday's top-of-the-table clash at Valencia (1945 GMT). Barca lead a revitalised Valencia by four points, with both Real Madrid and Atletico Madrid a further six points adrift, thanks to a club record start of 11 wins and one draw from 12 games. Despite leaving Messi on the bench, Barca also sealed their place in the last 16 of the Champions League with a 0-0 draw at Juventus on Wednesday."
570,21/11/2017,22:34,Valverde revisits defeat to prepare for Juve clash,"Barcelona coach Ernesto Valverde admitted on Tuesday that he watched last season's 3-0 defeat by Juventus ""over and over"" to prepare for their Champions League return to Turin on Wednesday.","Juventus beat Barcelona in the last eight thanks to a three-goal hammering at the Allianz Stadium and a goalless draw at the Camp Nou on their way to the final in Cardiff, where the Italians were beaten by Real Madrid. ""I watched that first leg over and over to prepare. That was a knockout round and the circumstances are different now, but we do know Juve start very strong and we must be ready for that initial assault,"" said Valverde, who replaced Luis Enrique last May. This season Juventus fell 3-0 in Barcelona and Valverde expects the Italian side to come out firing on all cylinders after their Serie A title defence took a knock with a 3-2 defeat at Sampdoria. ""When such a big team loses a game, they want to immediately make up for it, so I expect a strong reaction from Juventus,"" said the Barcelona coach. ""Juve were in great shape last season and won, but it'll be a very different game tomorrow and they are certainly motivated to make up for their defeat at Camp Nou."" Valverde refused to be drawn on comparisons between Italy and Spain, with Juventus having lost two Champions League finals to Spanish clubs and Italy falling to Spain as they failed to qualify for the World Cup for the first time in 60 years. ""They are not linked. They lost the two finals but they reached them and that was a success,"" he said. ""We respect Juventus, Roma and all of Italian football. I don't think you can say anyone is the favourite tomorrow, as these are two strong teams playing on level terms. ""The (failure to qualify for the) World Cup is more surprising because it has been many years since that happened. ""In these cases you always think of changing everything. Sometimes it's useful to change things but other times it just needs a little patience."" Juventus coach Massimiliano Allegri believes his team ""does not have big problems"" despite the Sampdoria defeat. ""Historically, we've had some hiccups at this stage of previous seasons too, but we've always done well over the course of the whole campaign,"" he said of the six-time reigning Serie A champions. ""Barcelona haven't lost in 14 league games and four Champions League games. Right now they have a greater balance than us. ""It will be a difficult match against them and we need to qualify, but nothing has been decided yet. ""Of course, we have to be aware of (Lionel) Messi who is an exceptional player. Even if there are just 10 centimetres of space, he will take the ball into places no other players would even think of trying. He is a difficult player to stop."""
571,21/11/2017,22:16,Rakitic would give World Cup spot to Buffon,Barcelona's Croatian international Ivan Rakitic said Tuesday he would love to tell Italian goalkeeping great Gianlugi Buffon to take his place in the 2018 World Cup.,"Rakitic will meet Buffon in Wednesday's Champions League clash with Juventus in Turin, just a week after Buffon tearfully retired from international duty as Italy crashed out of the World Cup. ""I feel like telling Buffon to go in my place, as what he's done for football is incredible, simply unique,"" said midfielder Rakitic when asked why Italy failed to advance from their World Cup play-off against Sweden while Croatia eliminated Greece. ""When a child writes out his ideal team, he always puts Buffon in goal. It's really a shame he isn't able to finish his career by competing in a sixth World Cup and I'd honestly love to give him that chance. ""I saw the pictures of him after the match against Sweden. It makes you empathise with him whatever your team. It's a real shame that a player like that doesn't have the chance to play his final World Cup."" Buffon, 39, later replied on Twitter. ""Dear Ivan, as a goalkeeper I might still play but playing for Croatia as a midfielder in your place might not be a great idea: Joking apart, your words have been a great gift."" Buffon -- who earned a record 175 caps for Italy over 20 years -- had been targeting a record sixth World Cup appearance in Russia. He announced his international retirement after the 1-0 play-off defeat which saw Italy miss the World Cup for the first time in 60 years. Playing likely his final season with Juventus, Buffon has one final ambition: to win the Champions League, after finishing runner-up twice in the past three years."
572,20/11/2017,01:30,"Real, Barca eye progress as Atletico fear exit","Holders Real Madrid, Barcelona and Manchester United headline a selection of teams who can secure a place in the last 16 of the Champions League this week.","Liverpool, Chelsea and Juventus are also within reach of a spot in the knockout phase, but Atletico Madrid appear destined for an early exit, with Serie A high-flyers Napoli also in deep trouble. Playing Tuesday (all times 1945 GMT unless stated) Spartak Moscow v Maribor (1700 GMT) Sevilla v Liverpool The winner of Liverpool's match at Sevilla will qualify. The two sides played out an entertaining 2-2 draw at Anfield on the opening matchday, and another point for five-time European champions Liverpool would still see them book a last-16 spot for the first time since 2008/09 if Spartak lose at home to Maribor. Russian champions Spartak cannot be eliminated on Tuesday and would secure at least third place with a draw. Slovenian outfit Maribor have to win and hope Sevilla lose to Liverpool to stay in knockout round contention. Manchester City v Feyenoord Napoli v Shakhtar Donetsk Serie A leaders Napoli host Shakhtar needing to win and score at least two goals to keep their hopes alive. The Italian side lost 2-1 in Ukraine in the reverse fixture, so need to level their head-to-head record with Shakhtar to take the group to a final matchday. Pep Guardiola's Manchester City will wrap up top spot in the group with a home win over pointless Feyenoord, or with a draw if Shakhtar lose in Naples. Besiktas v Porto (1700 GMT) Monaco v RB Leipzig Turkish champions Besiktas are on the cusp of the last 16 and will secure top spot with a draw. If Leipzig fail to beat Monaco, then they will finish in the top two regardless. Two-time champions Porto will book their ticket to the knockout stage with a victory in Istanbul if Leipzig do not win in the principality. Last season's semi-finalists Monaco have to win and hope Porto do not to have any chance of replicating their feats from last term. Borussia Dortmund v Tottenham APOEL v Real Madrid After their famous 3-1 win over the holders at Wembley last time out, Spurs just have to match Real's result on Tuesday to secure first place. Zinedine Zidane's Spanish champions will qualify with a win over Cypriots APOEL, and with a point if struggling Dortmund fail to see off Tottenham. A pair of draws against the Germans have kept APOEL's slim chances alive, but they will be out if they do not pull off a shock win over Real. Playing Wednesday CSKA Moscow v Benfica (1700 GMT) Basel v Manchester United Manchester United require just a point away to Basel to qualify and secure top spot as Jose Mourinho's team close in on a first appearance in the knockout phase since 2013-14. Paul Pogba's return from injury at the weekend inspired United to a 4-1 rout of Newcastle, just their second win in five league outings, while Zlatan Ibrahimovic also made his comeback following a serious knee injury. Basel could also qualify with victory over United if CSKA Moscow lose at home to Benfica, who must win to retain any outside chance of advancing. Paris Saint-Germain v Celtic Anderlecht v Bayern Munich Paris Saint-Germain and Bayern Munich are already guaranteed of their spots in the last 16, with Celtic and Anderlecht scrapping to continue their continental adventure in the Europa League. Unai Emery's PSG have scored 17 goals without conceding to record four straight group-stage wins, while Edinson Cavani scored twice more as they pulled six points clear in France following a 4-1 defeat of Nantes. Bayern have been rejuventated by the appointment of 72-year-old Jupp Heynckes, winning all eight matches since he replaced Carlo Ancelotti. Qarabag v Chelsea (1700 GMT) Atletico Madrid v Roma Roma can seal their place in the next round with a point at Atletico Madrid, while Chelsea will progress with victory over Qarabag -- or if Atletico fail to win in Spain. Diego Simeone's side -- finalists twice in the past four seasons -- have drawn four of their matches so far and appear heading to a premature exit. Buoyed by their 2-1 derby win over local rivals Lazio, Roma can wrap up first place with victory if Chelsea are denied all three points in Azerbaijan. Juventus v Barcelona Sporting Lisbon v Olympiakos Lionel Messi and Barcelona will qualify and clinch top spot with a draw against last year's finalists Juventus. Massimiliano Allegri's Juve slumped to a rare defeat on Sunday, as Gianluigi Buffon and Andrea Barzagli were rested for a 3-2 loss at Sampdoria. But the six-time reigning Italian champions can move through to the knockout round if they avoid defeat and Olympiakos get a result at Sporting. Both sides in Lisbon realistically must win to harbour any hope of staying in contention."
573,19/11/2017,17:36,"Barca appeal Pique ban, Suarez yellow",Barcelona announced on Sunday they will appeal yellow cards shown to Gerard Pique and Luis Suarez in Saturday's 3-0 win at Leganes.,"Unless his appeal is successful, Pique will miss next Sunday's top of the table clash at Valencia. ""FC Barcelona informs that it has decided to appeal to the competition committee for the yellow cards shown to Gerard Pique and Luis Suarez during the course of Leganes-FC Barcelona,"" Barca said in a statement. Pique was booked in the first half for a slight pull on Nordin Amrabat, with Barca boss Ernesto Valverde describing the yellow card as ""excessive"". Without the Spanish international, Valverde is likely to be forced into handing Thomas Vermaelen his first La Liga appearance of the season at Mestalla with Javier Mascherano out for a month due to a hamstring injury. Suarez was booked for impeding Leganes goalkeeper Ivan Cuellar clearing the ball early in the second half, but he got his revenge by celebrating in front of Cuellar after netting his second goal of the game as the Uruguayan ended a five-game goal drought."
574,18/11/2017,19:13,Suarez double stretches Barca's La Liga lead,Luis Suarez ended a five-game goal drought with a double as Barcelona extended their lead at the top of La Liga with a flattering 3-0 win at Leganes on Saturday.,"Barca now lead second-placed Valencia by seven points ahead of their trip to the Mestalla next weekend, with both Real Madrid and Atletico Madrid 11 points adrift before they face off in the Madrid derby later on Saturday (1945 GMT). However, two simple Suarez finishes from close range either side of half-time and Paulinho's late tap-in glossed over another under-par performance from Ernesto Valverde's men, who were again thankful to a fine display from goalkeeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen. ""The important thing was to win,"" Suarez told BeIN Sports Spain. ""We always try to play our best in every game but sometimes it is not possible."" Suarez was refreshed after sitting out international duty with Uruguay over the past fortnight and had the ball in the net after just four minutes, but Jordi Alba had already been flagged for offside as he supplied the cross for the former Liverpool striker. Leganes have enjoyed a fine start to just their second ever season in the Spanish top flight and a repeat of the 5-0 thrashing Barca dished out on their visit to Butarque last season was never likely as the hosts went onto enjoy the better of the opening half. ""Perhaps 0-3 is a bit excessive. They played well enough for the gap between the teams to not be so great,"" said Barca boss Valverde. The busy Nordin Ambrabat fired a shot over after a positive run at the Barca defence before Gabriel Pires also dragged an effort wide when well-placed at the edge of the box. However, Leganes' good work in the opening half hour was undone by a goalkeeping error when Ivan Cuellar limply palmed Paco Alcacer's driven cross into the path of the grateful Suarez to smash home his first goal for a month. ""I wasn't anxious. The important thing was to feel good again and help the team,"" added Suarez. Barca's joy was tempered moments later when Gerard Pique was booked for bringing down Amrabat meaning he will be suspended for next weekend's clash at Valencia. Amrabat was the creator once more for Leganes' best chance before the break when he released Alexander Szymanowski inside the area, but the Argentine's curling effort was turned to safety by the in-form Ter Stegen. The German goalkeeper was called into action again early in the second period when Leganes substitute Claudio Beauvue was too quick for the Barca defence only to fire straight at Ter Stegen. In contrast, just as in the first half, Barca were ruthlessly efficient in front of goal to double their lead on the hour mark. Lionel Messi's dinked pass released Alcacer and after Cuellar parried his first effort, Suarez drilled home the rebound for his second of the afternoon. Barca rode their luck to hold out for a 12th clean sheet in their last 17 games as Ter Stegen saved one-on-one from Amrabat and Beauvue blasted well over when unmarked 10 yards out. However, Barca piled more pressure on the chasing Atletico and Real ahead of the Madrid derby and rubbed salt into Leganes' wounds when Paulinho rolled into an empty net when a loose ball broke off Messi in stoppage time."

""It is clear it is an important week given the opponents we are facing,"" said Valverde on Friday. ""We have a lot of games in the run up to Christmas in which a lot is at stake in all three competitions."" However, having thrown away the title last season with defeats at Malaga, Deportivo la Coruna, Celta Vigo and at home to Alaves, Valverde wants Barca's minds concentrated on Leganes. ""Above all as a coach you are alert to these type of games. Last year at these type of grounds they lost points."" It is three months since Barca tasted defeat when they were swept aside 5-1 on aggregate by Real Madrid in the Spanish Super Cup. And Valverde warned that just as Madrid have subsequently struggled, Barca too will go through difficult spells over the course of the season. ""Back then it seemed Real Madrid were going to win everything and we said at some point they would have to lose. It is the same for us now. ""There is no point celebrating three months (unbeaten). Things keep moving on and we have another game tomorrow."" Injury-prone centre-back Thomas Vermaelen could be drafted in for his first league appearance of the season with Javier Mascherano out for a month with a hamstring problem. First-choice central defenders Gerard Pique and Samuel Umtiti are both just one yellow card away from being suspended for the trip to Valencia next weekend. The midfield trio of Andre Gomes, Rafinha and Sergi Roberto are also absent through injury, but Luis Suarez is fully fit and refreshed after being handed a rest during the international break by Uruguay."

The absence of the 33-year-old former Liverpool player means coach Ernesto Valverde will have little opportunity to rest his first-choice centre-back pairing of Gerard Pique and French international Samuel Umtiti. Valverde could be forced to turn to Thomas Vermaelen, who has managed just 90 minutes for Barcelona this season although he has just played back-to-back international matches for Belgium. Mascherano will miss Barca's final Champions League group games against Juventus on November 22 and then Sporting Lisbon on December 5. The club will be hoping he has recovered in time for the clash with Real Madrid at the Bernabeu on December 23."

Loud cries of ""freedom"" also rang around Europe's largest stadium sporadically throughout the 90 minutes. Two other banners reading ""Freedom for political prisoners"" and ""Europe shame on you"" were held up by the Barca singing section behind one of the goals. Barca coach Ernesto Valverde last week joked such off-field distractions appeared to be helping his side and once again they weren't fazed in registering a 10th win in their opening 11 La Liga matches. The hosts could have scored three times in the opening 10 minutes as Clement Lenglet cleared off the line from Sergio Busquets, David Soria denied Luis Suarez and Ivan Rakitic fired a long-range effort inches wide. Alcacer was the surprise choice in Valverde's starting line-up and he opened the scoring on his first league start since the first day of the season. Suarez's cross-field pass was miscontrolled horribly by Sergio Escudero and fell perfectly for Alcacer to slot past the advancing Soria. Barely a threat before half-time, Sevilla came out a different side after the break and levelled just before the hour mark when Guido Pizarro bulleted home Ever Banega's corner. Barca reacted immediately, though, and just six minutes later got the winner when Alcacer turned home Rakitic's precise cross at the near post. On his 600th Barca appearance, Lionel Messi had the chance to make the game safe when his low effort was saved by Soria, but Barca held on to move 11 points clear of Real Madrid, who face Las Palmas on Sunday (1945 GMT). Valencia remain Barca's closest challengers, four points back, as they swept aside Leganes 3-0 for a club record seventh straight league win. ""No one will go undefeated through 38 games, but we are going to enjoy the moment,"" said Valencia coach Marcelino Garcia Toral. ""In the dressing room there is no euphoria, there is realism and constant analysis. ""We know how difficult it will be to keep this up, it's practically impossible."" Dani Parejo's clever free-kick that skidded underneath the Leganes wall got Valencia off to a perfect start on 14 minutes. The hosts had to wait until 19 minutes from time to seal the points with a blistering counter-attack that ended with Spanish international Rodrigo heading home Manchester United loanee Andreas Pereira's cross. And the team spirit in this Valencia side was demonstrated when habitual penalty-taker Parejo let Santi Mina take responsibility from the spot eight minutes from time to round off the scoring. ""It was a phenomenal (gesture). They worked it out themselves and I prefer it like that,"" added Marcelino. ""It goes to show the atmosphere there is within the group, which is the foundation for us to perform like this."" By contrast, Atletico Madrid's struggle for goals continues but Diego Simeone's men were bailed out by Thomas Partey's 91st-minute winner in a 1-0 victory at Deportivo la Coruna. A 1-1 draw at home to Azerbaijani champions Qarabag all but ended Atletico's Champions League campaign in midweek amidst a run of one win in eight games. And they suffered from a familiar lack of creativity at Riazor with Simeone even substituting star frontman Antoine Griezmann 10 minutes from time. However, a relieved Simeone punched the air in delight when Ghanaian midfielder Partey curled home Gabi's layoff from a free-kick on the edge of the box to pass Griezmann and join Angel Correa as Atletico's top scorer this season on four goals."
578,04/11/2017,15:03,Free-scoring Valencia put pressure on Barca,Valencia swept aside Leganes 3-0 on Saturday to continue their stunning form with an eighth straight win to close to within a point of La Liga leaders Barcelona.,"Marcelino Garcia Toral's side also moved ahead of Barca as the league's top scorers with 30 goals in their first 11 games as Dani Parejo, Rodrigo and Santi Mina found the net. Barca can reopen a four-point gap at the top of the table when they host Sevilla later on Saturday (1945 GMT) at the Camp Nou. Parejo has been one of many players rejuvenated by Marcelino's arrival at Mestalla after two seasons in the doldrums for Valencia. The captain's clever free-kick that skidded underneath the Leganes wall got Valencia off to a perfect start on 14 minutes. Leganes had only conceded five goals in their 10 previous La Liga games to climb into seventh. However, the Madrid side's lack of cutting edge up front was exposed as they went on to enjoy the better of the first-half but failed to take their chances as Claudio Beauvue blazed over and Javier Eraso fired too close to Neto in the Valencia goal. On loan Paris Saint-Germain winger Goncalo Guedes has been Valencia's star performer in recent weeks and the Portuguese was inches away from his fourth goal of the season when he struck the post early in the second period. The hosts had to wait until 19 minutes from time to seal the points with a blistering counter-attack that ended with Spanish international Rodrigo heading home Manchester United loanee Andreas Pereira's cross. And the team-spirit in this Valencia side was demonstrated when habitual penalty taker Parejo let Mina take responsibility from the spot eight minutes from time to round off the scoring."

""The midfielder from Reus (Roberto) has a torn right hamstring which will keep him out for approximately five weeks,"" Barca said in a statement. ""(Gomes) with an injury in his right hamstring will be sidelined for around three to four weeks."" Both players will miss league games against Sevilla and Leganes, as well as a Champions League trip to Juventus. However, Gomes could be in contention to face his old club Valencia in a top of the table La Liga clash on November 25 or 26. Despite drawing a blank in a Champions League group game for the first time in five years, Barca remain well on course to reach the last 16 as they hold a three-point lead over Juventus with a point in Turin enough to also guarantee top spot in Group D."
582,28/10/2017,23:24,Messi maintains under-par Barca's lead over resurgent Valencia,Barcelona recorded their best ever start to a La Liga season as coach Ernesto Valverde enjoyed a successful return to Athletic Bilbao thanks to goals from Lionel Messi and Paulinho in a 2-0 win on Saturday.,"Valverde has now overseen 12 wins and a draw from his first 13 La Liga and Champions League matches as Barca reestablished their four-point lead at the top of the table over Valencia, who beat Alaves 2-1 earlier on Saturday. The Catalan giants also move eight points clear of rivals Real Madrid, who are in action on Sunday amidst a backdrop of political turmoil as they travel to Catalonia to take on Girona. ""The truth is we struggled a lot, especially in the second-half,"" Barca midfielder Sergio Busquets told Movistar TV. ""They had chances to equalise, but with a counter-attack at the end we scored the second which leaves us with this spectacular start."" Valverde left Bilbao in the summer and his impact has been felt just as much in Bilbao as it has in Barcelona -- Athletic have now one just one of their last 12 matches in all competitions. ""Athletic pressed us hard in the second-half and made it difficult,"" said Valverde. ""We gave the ball away a number of times and, without creating too many clear-cut chances, Athletic are always a threat when the ball is bouncing around the area."" The hosts started the brighter and only a stunning save from Marc-Andre ter Stegen prevented Aritz Aduriz from slotting Athletic in front on 19 minutes. Barca, and Messi in particular, grew into the game as the half wore on and the Argentine should have opened the scoring when he hit the woodwork for already the 10th time this season with the goal at his mercy from Luis Suarez's pass. Messi was at the heart of another flowing team move to break the deadlock eight minutes before half-time. He exchanged one-twos with Paulinho and Jordi Alba before sweeping home the left-back's low cross. Paulinho should have extended the visitors' advantage when he smacked the crossbar moments later, but an under-par Barca had to withstand plenty of Athletic pressure after the break. Raul Garcia's header also hit the woodwork, while Ter Stegen produced another stunning stop from Aduriz five minutes from time. But Barca held out to record a ninth clean sheet in their last 13 games, and added a second deep into stoppage time when Paulinho tapped home the rebound after Kepa Arrizabalaga had parried Suarez's first effort. After two seasons in the doldrums, Valencia's stunning revival under Marcelino Garcia Toral continued as they remain Barca's closest challengers with victory in Vitoria. Simone Zaza blasted Valencia into the lead 10 minutes before half-time from Manchester United loanee Andreas Pereira's cut-back for his ninth goal of the season. Alaves levelled through Alexis's header early in the second period, but Rodrigo's penalty after Rodrigo Ely handled a cross inside his own box gifted the visitors all three points. ""It has completely changed, not just our level of play but also our mentality,"" Zaza said of Valencia's upturn in form since Marcelino took charge in June. ""The coach has helped a lot in that. Now we are competitive and can compete against anyone. ""We are second and we have to enjoy it. We don't know how far we can go, but we have a lot of ambition."" Atletico Madrid remain fourth, level on 20 points with Real Madrid, but their stumbling season continued as they were held 1-1 at home by Villarreal for their fifth draw in 10 Liga games. Diego Simeone's men's problem has largely been finding the net but they went in front just after the hour mark in spectacular fashion as Angel Correa cushioned Antoine Griezmann's volleyed pass into his path before slotting home at the near post. However, in another recurring theme of Atletico's season, they sat far too deep in trying to defend their lead and were punished nine minutes from time when Carlos Bacca flicked home a header from a corner. ""If the team continues with that aggression and intensity, better times will come,"" insisted a defiant Simeone, whose side face a must-win Champions League clash against Qarabag of Azerbaijan on Tuesday."
583,27/10/2017,18:41,Barca coach coy on Catalonia crisis,Barcelona coach Ernesto Valverde repeatedly batted away questions on the Catalonia crisis on Friday insisting it was not his role to enter the political fray.,"With Catalonia's regional parliament approving a declaration of independence dominating news Friday Valverde was preparing Barcelona for an away game at Athletic Bilbao in Spain's La Liga. ""Everyone has their responsibility,"" he said refusing to speak about the political crisis. ""I am the coach of Barcelona and I will try to have my team win,"" he said ""I'm just focussed on winning this match,"" said Valverde. Bombarded with consistent questions on the crisis Valverde remained stoic. ""Its not for me to draw conclusions, but like everyone I have my own opinion on the matter,"" he said. ""But I would like to remain solely focussed on the sporting side of things."" ""Nothing has happened yet and so far we are talking about assumptions (about the crisis). It's okay drawing conclusions but let's just talk about reality,"" he said. ""And the reality is that tomorrow we have a game and we will try to win it."" ""Athletico are very strong at home and always have been. Their fans get behind them and the team never gives up,"" he said of Saturday's rivals who sit 11th in La liga 14 points behind Barca. ""And they always seem very motivated when we go there, its a real classic every time we go. ""It's a game everybody wants to play in, it's a stressful game against a dangerous team,"" he added."
584,21/10/2017,22:46,Barca roll on calmly amidst Catalan chaos,Barcelona dismissed another day of political chaos in Catalonia to continue on their merry way at the top of La Liga by beating Malaga 2-0 at the Camp Nou.,"Spanish Primer Minister Mariano Rajoy announced on Saturday that Madrid will move to dismiss Catalonia's separatist government and call fresh elections in the semi-autonomous region. In protest 450,000 independence supporters piled onto the streets of Barcelona to voice their anger. However, other than the usual cries in favour of independence in the 17th minute to mark the fall of Catalonia in the Spanish War of Succession in 1714 and sporadic chants of ""freedom"", it was business as usual for Barca. Earlier, club president Josep Maria Bartomeu insisted Barca will not be used as a political tool in the political battle over independence. ""We are not an instrument to be manipulated for political interests, whatever they may be,"" Bartomeu told club members at Barca's annual general meeting (AGM). ""Nobody can appropriate our badge or flag."" The club has backed Catalonia's right to self-determination, but refused to position itself either in favour or against independence. And despite being criticised by both sides of the independence debate for his neutral stance, Bartomeu went largely unchallenged at the AGM as members happily passed a budget backed by a club record revenue of 897 million euros ($1.06 billion) for the 2017/18 season. That calm transferred onto the pitch as an 11th win in 12 La Liga and Champions League games this season leaves Barca four points clear of Valencia, and eight ahead of rivals Real Madrid, who host Eibar on Sunday. Barca had failed to win four of their last six games against Malaga, but any threat the winless Andalusians could continue that run evaporated inside two minutes in fortuitous fashion for the hosts. Gerard Deulofeu flicked home his first ever goal for the club with aplomb, but Malaga couldn't believe the goal was allowed to stand despite the ball clearly having gone out of play before Lucas Digne crossed into the penalty area. Barca, though, created precious little else before half-time and had to wait until 11 minutes into the second period to make the game safe when Lionel Messi teed up Andres Iniesta to fire into the top corner via the aid of a deflection. Luis Suarez should have rounded off the scoring, but somehow fired wide with the goal at his mercy after great work from Messi and Sergi Roberto. An eighth defeat in nine games leaves Malaga still firmly rooted to the bottom of the table and coach Michel ever closer to the exit door. Valencia remain Barca's closest challengers after thrashing Sevilla 4-0 at Mestalla. Paris Saint-Germain loanee Goncalo Guedes continued his sensational form by opening and rounding off the scoring in fine style. In between times Simone Zaza added his eighth Liga goal of the season before Santi Mina punished a slack Sevilla defence that has now conceded nine goals in five days after suffering a 5-1 rout at Spartak Moscow in the Champions League in midweek."
585,21/10/2017,16:12,Barca won't be used as political tool - Bartomeu,"Paris Saint-Germain superstar Neymar will be crucial to the development of fellow new recruit Kylian Mbappe, the club's vice-captain Marquinhos has told AFP.","Marquinhos also said he believes Neymar will do more to bring glory to the Qatar-owned Paris club than its former Brazilian number 10 Ronaldinho. Marquinhos and Neymar were on the same gold medal-winning Brazil team at the 2016 Rio Olympics and the defender believes the striker's leadership skills will be an important factor as the club go in search of titles this season. ""He's a wonderful player. When it's a big game that's when he shows the most character, the best attitude,"" Marquinhos said of the 25-year-old Brazilian who joined PSG for a world-record 222 million euros ($261.5 million) in the close season. ""He likes to take charge of things and he loves a boiling atmosphere,"" Marquinhos said. That approach will be tested on Sunday when PSG travel to Marseille for a Ligue 1 grudge match with the capital outfit sitting top on 25 points and OM third on 17. ""I know Neymar well and know he loves this kind of game,"" said Marquinhos. The 23-year-old defender, who is in his fifth season at PSG and has played over 20 times for Brazil, says Neymar's role as mentor to the 18-year-old Mbappe will help to shape the French international striker's game. ""Neymar knows how important he is for Kylian, as Messi was important for him, as Ronaldinho was important for Messi. ""Kylian is an adorable guy, and the two of them hit it off straight away,"" said Marquinhos. ""Even if they don't speak the same language, on the pitch you can see how well they get on. ""Both of them are capable (of winning the Ballon d'Or). The main thing is that it's magnificent to have the pair of them here,"" said Marquinhos. Ronaldinho, the Brazilian superstar of his time, lit up the Parc des Princes from 2001 to 2003. ""I hope he'll do even more than Ronaldinho because he's a wonderful player and he always wants to stand up and be counted on the pitch,"" Marquinhos said. PSG recruited Mbappe from Monaco just before the summer transfer deadline on an initial loan deal which is set to be made into a permanent move next year for 180 million euros."
586,21/10/2017,03:30,Catalan crisis leaves Barca between rock and a hard place,Barcelona president Josep Maria Bartomeu faces the club's members at an annual general meeting on Saturday fighting an increasingly difficult battle to balance the conflicting interests of fans in favour of Catalan independence and millions of supporters in the rest of Spain and around the world.,"A powerful symbol of Catalonia, Barca have been caught in the political crossfire since an independence referendum for the wealthy northeastern region of Spain, deemed illegal by the central government in Madrid, was marred by violent clashes as police forced their way into polling stations to seize ballot boxes on October 1. That Sunday afternoon, in conjunction with Barca's star-studded squad and after La Liga refused to postpone a match against Las Palmas at the club's iconic Camp Nou stadium, Bartomeu's board took the divisive decision to play behind closed doors as a protest. Two board members subsequently resigned over the decision to go ahead with the game. ""Our position is very clear, we want dialogue,"" Bartomeu reiterated after Wednesday's Champions League win over Olympiakos as a standoff between the Catalan and Spanish governments continues. The club have backed Catalonia's right to self-determination in a referendum, but never supported either side of the independence debate. Barca unfurled a near 2,500 metre squared banner displaying the message ""Dialogue, Respect, Sport"" before kick-off on Wednesday. However, that didn't go far enough for many just a day after two civil society leaders of the pro-independence campaign were jailed on charges of sedition. The Catalan National Assembly (ANC) and Omnium Cultural groups led by Jordi Sanchez and Jordi Cuixart were invited to the directors' box at the Camp Nou in midweek, but both refused the invitation. ""We believe that the message of FC Barcelona doesn't represent the feeling of the majority of the fanbase,"" the ANC said in a statement. Both groups had produced a banner calling for Sanchez and Cuixart's freedom that Barca prevented from entering the stadium for fear of reprisals from UEFA, who sanction any displays of a political nature and have previously fined the club for the flying of pro-separatist flags. Yet, with a 150,000 strong membership and 103 million Facebook followers, there are plenty Barca fans who would like the club to concentrate on points not politics. ""The club should always be an example of respect to a plurality of opinion among its members, who it is owned by, leaving politics to one side,"" various Barca supporters' clubs in the northern Spanish region of Leon said in a joint statement on Wednesday. ""On political issues, Bartomeu is cursed,"" online newspaper El Confidencial wrote on Thursday. ""For some he goes too far, for others not enough. No matter what he does, he never pleases anyone."" Bartomeu, therefore, faces a membership on Saturday, 92 percent of whom are resident in Catalonia, faced with an impossible mission. However, the 54-year-old, softly spoken businessman is a serial survivor of several club crises. He assumed the role of president after Sandro Rossell resigned over the murky transfer that brought Neymar to Barcelona in 2013 and, when pressured into calling early elections, rode the euphoria of winning a treble to secure a fresh mandate in 2015. Neymar's departure to Paris Saint-Germain in August provoked a vote of no confidence from disgruntled members which also failed to garner sufficient support to succeed. The Brazilian has so far not been missed as Barca lead La Liga and their Champions League group with a stunning record of 10 wins and one draw from their opening 11 games in all competitions. And one of the primary orders of business on Saturday will be to pass a budget for the new season backed by a record revenue of 897 million euros ($1.06 billion). Finances may ultimately be the tipping point for how Barca position themselves. La Liga president Javier Tebas admitted this week the league's booming TV rights contracts would lose at least 20 percent of their value should Barca be cut adrift in an independent state. And the financial repercussions for Barca would be even more severe. ""They wouldn't be able to have world-leading figures,"" Jose Maria Gay de Liebana, professor of economics at Barcelona University, told AFP of a squad currently boasting the likes of five-time World Player of the Year Lionel Messi. ""They would become a medium-sized club."""
587,18/10/2017,22:49,"No Pique, no problem as 10-man Barca cruise",Barcelona shrugged off an early Gerard Pique red card and the distractions of a first match at the Camp Nou since a violent crackdown of an independence referendum in Catalonia to beat Olympiakos 3-1 on Wednesday.,"A Dimitrios Nikolaou own goal and second-half strikes from Lionel Messi and Lucas Digne ensured a comfortable evening for the hosts on the field, while the political tension sweeping across Catalonia was seen in the stands despite a low turnout due to torrential rain. Barca lead Group D with a perfect record from three games, while Juventus remain three points behind thanks to a 2-1 win over Sporting Lisbon. A near 50-metre banner produced by the club called for ""Dialogue, Respect, and Sport"" before kick-off as Barca continued their plea for both sides of the political divide to reconcile their differences. Catalonia's separatist leader Carles Puigdemont must abandon his bid for independence from Spain on Thursday or face an unprecedented move by Madrid to seek a suspension of his region's autonomy. Barca's singing section also held up a banner reading 'Freedom for Catalonia', while there were habitual chants in favour of independence in the 17th minute of each half to mark the fall of Catalonia in the Spanish War of Succession in 1714. Those cries were briefly halted in the first period, though, as Barca went in front in the 18th minute when Nikolaou sliced Gerard Deulofeu's cross into his own net. The club have supported Catalonia's right to self-determination in a referendum, but stopped short of backing independence. Barca beat Las Palmas 3-0 behind closed doors on October 1 as a protest at the violent scenes across Catalonia, according to Barca president Josep Maria Bartomeu. However, the decision to go ahead with the match proved divisive as two Barca board members resigned in the aftermath and there were calls for Bartomeu to resign from supporters at the start of the second half. Barca announced on Tuesday representatives of pro-independence citizens' groups Omnium Cultural and the Catalan National Assembly (ANC) were invited after their leaders Jordi Cuixart and Jordi Sanchez were detained on Monday on charges of sedition. However, both organisations refused that offer. ""We believe FC Barcelona's message doesn't represent the majority of the fans. For that reason we reject the invitation to the directors' box,"" the ANC said in a statement on Twitter. Pique dominated headlines for his outspoken criticism of the police brutality on the day of the October 1 referendum and his subsequent treatment when on international duty with Spain as he was jeered. However, for once it was his performance on the pitch that was left open to criticism as he was stupidly sent off for slapping the ball into the net two minutes before half-time after picking up an early booking. Barca, though, shrugged off their numerical disadvantage as Messi scored his 100th goal in European competition and 97th in the Champions League on the hour mark. The Argentine dinked a free-kick towards goal, but needed the help of a poor effort from Olympiakos 'keeper Silvio Proto, who merely helped the ball on its way into the net. Messi was involved again for Barca's third three minutes later as his cutback was drilled home by Lucas Digne. Olympiakos pulled a goal back a minute from time as Nikolaou made amends for his earlier error with a towering header, but the Greeks remain rooted to the bottom of group without a point."

589,15/10/2017,01:50,Atletico-Barca 'spectacle' overshadows political backdrop,Players and coaches of both Atletico Madrid and Barcelona hailed the atmosphere at Atletico's Wanda Metropolitano on Saturday as the thrills of a 1-1 draw drowned out fears the match would be overshadowed by political tension sweeping across Spain.,"Barca's previous match was played behind closed doors as a protest to a violent police crackdown on an independence referendum in Catalonia, deemed illegal by the Spanish government, on October 1. The Catalan giants' visit to the Spanish capital was marked by a wash of Spanish flags and chants of ""Viva Espana"" (long live Spain), but fans at the 68,000 capacity were more enthralled by action on the field. Luis Suarez salvaged a point for Barca nine minutes from time to cancel out Saul Niguez's stunning first-half strike for Atletico. ""It was a great game, in a great atmosphere, in a great stadium and we take it as a good point despite the fact we wanted to win,"" said Barca coach Ernesto Valverde. ""What we like is playing and enjoying ourselves in a spectacular atmosphere like today,"" added Barca captain Andres Iniesta, who has called for dialogue between politicians on both sides of the independence debate. ""We played very well against a great team and what counts is that football is a spectacle."" Atletico only moved into the Metropolitano last month, but the stadium, which will host next season's Champions League final, has quickly received rave reviews. ""The stadium was marvellous,"" said Atletico boss Diego Simeone. ""It was a great night of football for everyone with two great teams."" Both Simeone and Valverde also agreed that Lionel Messi was the star of the show once more, despite failing to add to his 17 goals this season for club and country. Messi only arrived back in Barcelona late on Thursday after rescuing Argentina's floundering World Cup qualifying campaign with a stunning hat-trick in the altitude of Quito, Ecuador on Tuesday to ensure his presence at next year's showpiece in Russia. ""Evidently that journey didn't tire him out too much,"" said a smiling Simeone. ""Messi was extraordinary. Every time the ball went through him there was danger."" Messi hit the post and saw a free-kick saved by Jan Oblak with the last kick of the game as Valverde's men had to settle for a point after opening their league campaign with seven straight wins. ""More than for the journey, he was more worn out from the tension accumulated in the games, but Leo always responds and we know the respect he demands from the opposition,"" added Valverde. ""When he gets the ball there is always the sensation anything can happen."" Real Madrid closed to within five points of Barca with victory at Getafe earlier on Saturday, but Valverde was still content with Barca's response to going behind. ""We go away with a positive feeling. We have to value the point against a great opponent, who went in front, and when Atletico go in front they manage that advantage well. ""Their tight defensive lines near their area made it difficult in the first half. ""In the second, we created chances with more clarity and that push and spirit in the second half got us a point."""
590,13/10/2017,18:13,Barca trip to Madrid 'just a game' - Valverde,"Barcelona visit Atletico Madrid in their first trip to the Spanish capital on Saturday since a Catalan independence referendum marred by violence, but Barca coach Ernesto Valverde attempted to quash talk of political tension by insisting it is just ""a game of football.""","In their last outing, Barca played behind closed doors as the October 1 referendum, deemed illegal by the Spanish government, took place amid chaotic scenes as police seized ballot papers and clashed with voters leaving 92 injured, among nearly 900 who sought medical attention. That match was described by Barca captain Andres Iniesta this week as one of the ""worst moments"" in his career, whilst Gerard Pique, an outspoken defender of Catalonia's right to self-determination, broke down in tears when addressing reporters after the match. However, Valverde hopes the biggest game of the La Liga season so far is a chance for fans to escape the political tension sweeping Spain rather than indulging in it. ""We are going to kid ourselves. It is a game between two teams who want to fight for La Liga and will be an intimidating atmosphere, but it is a game of football,"" Valverde said on Friday. ""Football is for people to enjoy themselves. To support their team, suffer with their team and enjoy it more than anything else."" Only 250 tickets have been made available to away fans at Atletico's new 68,000 capacity Wanda Metropolitano. However, many Atletico fans have taken to social media to encourage supporters not to politicise the match by waving Spanish flags by using the hashtag ""our flag is red and white"" on Twitter. Pique was jeered when playing for Spain in Alicante last week, but he received support for his willingness to speak out from Atletico defender Filipe Luis. ""I am a fan of Pique even if at times I don't agree with what he says,"" the Brazilian told El Mundo. ""He puts himself out there, he doesn't hide behind his fame to not say what he thinks. ""It is admirable and I wish more footballers were like him."" Despite a series of distractions, including the loss of Neymar to Paris Saint-Germain and calls for Barca president Josep Maria Bartomeu to resign on top of the Catalonia crisis, Barca have started La Liga with a perfect record after seven games. ""They have made an enormous effort in the absence of Neymar to continue being a competitive team,"" said Atletico coach Diego Simeone, whose side are six points behind Barca in fourth. ""They are in the generation of Pique, (Sergio) Busquets, (Lionel) Messi, (Luis) Suarez and what they transmit to the rest allows them to remain competitive. That is what they have shown in their start to the season."" That spectacular form has been thanks to Messi's 14 goals in 11 appearances for Barca this season. And the five-time World Player of the Year also rescued Argentina's floundering World Cup qualifying campaign with a stunning hat-trick against Ecuador on Tuesday to ensure their place in Russia next year. However, Barca are often vulnerable immediately after an international break with the likes of Messi and Suarez only returning to training in Barcelona on Friday. ""Many of them have come from playing decisive games and the level of tension accumulated over the break is important,"" added Valverde. ""Atletico have also had players away and if is was a less attractive match it might worry me more. ""We are aware of how difficult it will be and the magnitude of the game helps to remain concentrated."" Iniesta is, though, expected to be fit after missing Spain's final World Cup qualifiers with a hamstring strain. Fixtures (all times GMT)"
591,12/10/2017,21:55,Mascherano to quit Argentina after World Cup,Veteran Argentina midfielder Javier Mascherano said Thursday he will step down from international duty after the 2018 World Cup.,"The versatile Barcelona star, who turns 34 next June, is Argentina's second most-capped player with 139 appearances for his country and played in the 2014 World Cup final defeat to Germany. He is also a four-time runner-up in the Copa America -- finishing on the losing side in 2004, 2007, 2015 and 2016. ""My time in the national team finishes in Russia, I won't go any further,"" Mascherano told Argentine TV station TyC Sports. ""(Coach Jorge) Sampaoli will decide if I should be selected for the World Cup or not."" Mascherano started Tuesday's 3-1 South American qualifying victory in Ecuador that guaranteed Argentina a place at next year's finals in Russia. He is four caps short of equalling Inter Milan legend Javier Zanetti's Argentina record. Mascherano joined Barcelona from Liverpool in 2010 and is under contract at the Camp Nou until 2019."
592,11/10/2017,18:04,Barca promise to try again for Liverpool's Coutinho,"Barcelona are planning a fresh assault on Liverpool's Philippe Coutinho in the January transfer window, the Catalan club's CEO Oscar Grau promised on Wednesday.","Barca were thwarted in their attempt to prise Coutinho away from Anfield during the summer with Liverpool placing a reported 200 million euros ($238 million) asking price on the midfielder. Despite the player trying to engineer a move, Liverpool turned down his late transfer request during the close season window. But Grau made clear the Spanish giants had not given up the chase. ""We are ready to sign Coutinho, or any other player (during the winter transfer window),"" he told a press conference. ""We have the money,"" Grau said, confirming the club's announcement in July of record income of 708 million euros ($812.8m) for 2016/2017 with an after-tax profit of 18m euros. Grau added: ""The most important thing is the demands from the management, and we will do everything possible to meet them. We want to have the most competitive team possible."" Barca experienced a tumultuous time during the summer transfer market, losing Coutinho's compatriot Neymar to Paris Saint-Germain for a world record 222 million euros, and bringing in Ousmane Dembele from Borussia Dortmund for 105 million euros. But Dembele has endured a nightmare start to life at the Camp Nou. The France international suffered a hamstring injury on his full La Liga debut ruling him out until January at the earliest."
593,11/10/2017,16:12,Barcelona must remain in La Liga - club director,"Barcelona must remain in Spain's La Liga, club general director Oscar Grau said on Wednesday following the signing by Catalan leaders of a declaration of independence.","""The budgets are based on participation in La Liga. I think that La Liga and Barca must continue together,"" Grau told a press conference at the unveiling of the club's 2016/2017 accounts. On the eventual impact on Barcelona's sponsors should the region break away from Spain, Grau said: ""Sponsors are very happy to be associated with Barca, with the club's structure, with its style of play, with its DNA, the values it promotes, and that is an asset we will always maintain."" Grau was speaking less than 24 hours after Catalan president Carles Puigdemont announced that he had accepted the mandate for ""Catalonia to become an independent state"" following the contested October 1 referendum. But in a speech to the Catalan parliament, Puigdemont immediately called for independence to be suspended, to allow for negotiations with Madrid. La Liga president Javier Tebas has repeatedly insisted that Catalan teams would not be allowed to continue in La Liga after independence. ""If the rebellion succeeds, we will work for a league without Barcelona,"" Tebas told BeIN Sports Spain this week. Tebas's reasoning is that Spain's sports law only allows teams from Spain and Andorra to participate in Spanish leagues. However, a change in legislation could allow Catalan teams to continue and many believe Tebas's hardline stance could soften should independence be established, not least due to the economic blow that losing Barca could have for La Liga. Barca have tried to walk a political tightrope by coming out in favour of Catalonia's right to self-determination, but stopping short of backing independence."
594,10/10/2017,16:05,Stoichkov to lose consul role over Catalan backing,"Bulgaria will seek to revoke the honorary consul status of former Barcelona football star Hristo Stoichkov over his backing of Catalan independence, the foreign ministry announced on Tuesday.","""We have started a procedure for releasing Hristo Stoichkov as honorary (non-paid) consul of Bulgaria in Spain, based in Barcelona,"" it said in a statement. ""The efficient execution of his duties as honorary consul will be hindered in the future as his latest public statements make his communication with the official Spanish authorities difficult,"" the ministry explained. Renowned for his sharp tongue, Stoichkov last week backed Catalonia's banned independence referendum, which took place on October 1. The 51-year-old, who is mostly based in the United States, also accused the Spanish government of being responsible for the violence that erupted during the poll. ""I don't care about Spain, I care about the people of Catalonia,"" he told recently Bulgarian state media. The rampaging left-sided striker joined Johan Cruyff's Barca in 1990 and scored a total of 162 goals in 336 games for them, many alongside the great Brazilian striker Romario. He won the Spanish league title five times and the European Cup in 1992 before winning the Ballon d'Or as the best player in Europe in 1994. He has always demonstrated his deep attachment to Catalonia ever since. Stoichkov, who was appointed to the role in 2011, is mainly based in the United States, according to the foreign ministry. The decision to remove him from the post is still subject to government approval. The Catalonian vote has sparked a major crisis in Spain, with Madrid not ruling out suspending the region's autonomy if separatists declare independence. Key European Union powers Germany and France have backed Spanish unity."
595,06/10/2017,12:24,Andres Iniesta renews Barca contract 'for life',"Barcelona tied down captain Andres Iniesta for the rest of his career as the club announced on Friday the 33-year-old midfielder has agreed a ""lifetime contract"".","""Iniesta signed a lifetime contract with FC Barcelona on Friday, in a deal that will keep him at the club for the rest of his career,"" Barca said in a statement. Along with five-time World Player of the Year Lionel Messi, Iniesta is Barca's most decorated player of all-time having won 30 trophies at club level, including eight La Liga titles and four Champions Leagues. Iniesta has also made the second highest number of appearances in a Barca shirt behind Xavi Hernandez with 639 since his debut 15 years ago. Born in the central Spanish region of Castilla-La Mancha before joining Barca at the age of 12, Iniesta is a beloved figure across Spain as he scored the winning goal in the 2010 World Cup final. Normally determined to shy away from the spotlight, Iniesta spoke out on Thursday to urge negotiation and prevent a spiralling political crisis over the battle for Catalan independence deepening. Hundreds required medical attention on Sunday as voters in a referendum on independence, deemed illegal by Spain's central government, clashed with police. ""I have never before publicly commented on situations that are so complex and involve such diverse emotions, but this situation we are experiencing is exceptional,"" Iniesta wrote in a Facebook post. ""One thing I know for sure: before we do any more harm, those who are responsible for all this must hold dialogue. ""Do it for all of us. We deserve to live in peace."" Iniesta has previously tended to do his talking on the field as a fundamental figure in Barca's most successful ever era. Alongside long-time midfield partner Xavi for both club and country, Iniesta formed the axis of Pep Guardiola's legendary side that won 14 trophies in four years between 2008 and 2012. His previous contract was due to expire at the end of the season and doubts over his future were raised when he refuted Barca president Josep Maria Bartomeu's claims a deal ""in principle"" was in place last month. Bartomeu has received fierce criticism for his handling of both sporting and institutional matters in recent months. He decided to play Barca's home game against Las Palmas on Sunday behind closed doors as a protest against events in Catalonia on Sunday, leading to the resignation of two board members. And Barca's haphazard approach in the transfer market following Neymar's world record 222 million euro departure to Paris Saint-Germain also saw Bartomeu face a vote of no confidence from disgruntled club members. However, in tying down Iniesta, Bartomeu has at least ensured that one of Barca's all-time greats will see out the rest of his career at the Camp Nou."
596,05/10/2017,11:56,Ex-Barcelona star Stoichkov backs Catalans,Former Barcelona favourite Hristo Stoichkov on Thursday backed the independence referendum in Catalonia and denounced the violence that marred the banned vote.,"""The leaders of Catalonia and the people who voted decided that the moment has come to separate and I will back them,"" Stoichkov, a Bulgarian, told his country's public broadcaster BNT. ""This is only natural. I've lived there for 27 years. I know what they have given me and what I have given them."" Renowned for his sharp tongue, 51-year-old Stoichkov accused the Spanish government of being responsible for the violent clashes that erupted during Sunday's poll in the wealthy northeastern region. Images of Spanish police beating Catalans taking part in the vote sparked international concern. ""The world saw it. This is inadmissible,"" Stoichkov said, adding that he felt ""insulted and indignant"". ""I don't care about Spain, I care about the people of Catalonia. Nobody wants blood and beatings,"" he fumed. The left-footed striker joined Barca in 1990 and scored a total of 162 goals in 336 games during an eight-year stay, which earned him a spot on Barcelona's Dream Team. Barcelona captain Gerard Pique has been the most prominent critic in the team of Spain's handling of the crisis, while the club's former manager and current Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola is an outspoken supporter of Catalan independence."
597,02/10/2017,20:49,Proud Pique a lightning rod in Catalonia chaos,Barcelona star Gerard Pique's tears of sadness and the vast empty stands as his team reluctantly played were two of the defining images of a violence-scarred independence referendum in Catalonia.,"Pique, an outspoken defender of the wealthy northeastern Spanish region's right to self-determination, had been able to cast his vote in an independence referendum deemed illegal by Madrid without obstruction on Sunday morning. Others were not so lucky as police fired rubber bullets and forced their way into activist-held polling stations to confiscate ballots, in many cases by violently removing activists. Clashes left at least 92 people confirmed injured out of a total of 844 who needed medical attention, according to Catalan authorities. ""I am very proud of Catalonia and all its people,"" an emotional Pique told reporters as tears welled up in his eyes after a routine 3-0 win over Las Palmas in an empty Camp Nou on an otherwise extraordinary day. ""Despite how much they are incited, and despite how much they (the Spanish authorities and security forces) want them to fall into the trap, they have demonstrated peacefully and sung loud and clear."" Amid scenes of chaos and confusion outside Barca's 99,000-capacity stadium, fans were left waiting for hours before a final decision to play behind closed doors was made less than half an hour before kick-off. ""I wouldn't have played,"" Barcelona's most successful ever coach and current Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola told Catalan radio station Rac1. ""If in the end you play this game, you do it with the public and all the consequences."" Pique described the match, played in near-silence, as the ""worst professional experience"" of his career. Barca had appealed to La Liga to postpone the game. However, when the football and security authorities refused to do so, the club feared a potential six-point penalty if they failed to fulfil the fixture. Barcelona's president Josep Maria Bartomeu claimed the decision to play behind closed doors was one of protest at events across Catalonia, while a section of Barca fan groups had threatened a peaceful pitch invasion to interrupt the match. The divided opinion over the decision was evident as two Barca board members resigned, Bartomeu confirmed after an extraordinary board meeting on Monday. Bartomeu also announced that Barca would take part in a general strike across Catalonia on Tuesday in protest at the violence. Barcelona-based daily Sport's front page read ""Shame"" above a picture of a desolate Camp Nou, and ""Dignity"" in defence of Pique. The reaction of Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy's government to the escalating crisis has drawn widespread criticism both in Spain and across the world. Pique said Rajoy was not up to the job of leading Spain. ""He travels around the world and doesn't even know how to speak English,"" he said. Tennis world number one Rafael Nadal said his ""heart sank"" at seeing the images from Catalonia as he prepared for the China Open in Beijing. He also pointed the finger at bickering politicians. ""It is the time for both sides to use their heads. For that there has to be a willingness on both sides,"" said Nadal. ""It is the moment to sit down, talk and reach points of agreement so that this is not repeated."" Pique's latest declarations have once again raised the debate over his role in the Spanish national team. Despite playing a crucial part of the Spain sides that won the 2010 World Cup and Euro 2012, Pique is routinely jeered when representing his country. Those jeers intensified in front of just a few hundred fans at an opening training session on Monday amidst chants of ""Pique leave the national team!"" He has already stated his intent to retire from international football after next year's World Cup, but insisted he could step aside sooner if Spain coach Julen Lopetegui or the federation believe his political stance to be problematic. Pique didn't make any comment as he joined up with the Spain squad on Monday, but continued to criticise the police's response via Twitter by posting links to videos of shocking police brutality."
598,01/10/2017,16:03,Barcelona-Las Palmas match to be played behind closed doors,Barcelona's La Liga match against Las Palmas will be played behind closed doors on Sunday (1415GMT) after the Spanish league refused to postpone the match.,"At least 91 people have been injured in clashes between police and activists in Catalonia on Sunday over an independence referendum for the region deemed illegal by the Spanish government. ""FC Barcelona condemns the events which have taken place in many parts of Catalonia today in order to prevent its citizens exercising their democratic right to free expression,"" Barcelona said in a statement. ""Given the exceptional nature of these events, the board of directors has decided that the first-team game against Las Palmas will be played behind closed doors, following the Professional Football League's refusal to postpone the game."""
599,29/09/2017,12:43,Barca on frontline of Catalan independence debate,"For many a beacon of Catalan identity, Barcelona are walking a fine line in the debate over a banned independence referendum in Catalonia, backing the vote without openly calling for secession from Spain.","After police last week detained key members of the team organising Sunday's referendum, the club issued a strongly-worded statement condemning the arrests in ""the defence of the nation, to democracy, to freedom of speech, and to self-determination"". Barca ""condemn any act that may impede the free exercise of these rights"", they added. The club issued the statement in response to ""very strong pressure from its (fan) base"", said Carlos Vinas, a Catalan historian at the University of Barcelona, who described Barca as Catalonia's ""unofficial national team"". Catalonia's independance debate has put Barca's ""more than a club"" motto to the test. In May they signed a manifesto backing an independence referendum in Catalonia, which Spain's central government has repeatedly refused to allow arguing it would violate the constitution. ""Since its foundation Barca has reflected the social and political ideas of Catalonia,"" said Carles Feixa, a sports anthropologist at the city's Pompeu Fabra university. Barca will host Las Palmas at their 99,000 capacity Camp Nou stadium in a Spanish La Liga match on Sunday when the contested vote is scheduled to take place, and some supporters want the team's players to wear the yellow and red Catalan flag as they have in other seasons. But club directors said Argentine star Lionel Messi and his teammates will wear their traditional red and blue jerseys and will focus on football rather than politics. Outspoken Barca defender Gerard Pique, though, has called on people to vote on Sunday. ""From today until Sunday, we will express ourselves peacefully,"" Pique posted in a message in Catalan on his Twitter account on Thursday. ""Don't give them any excuse. It is what they want. And we will sing loud and clear. #Wewillvote."" The club's stadium was closed under Spain's 1923-30 dictatorship of Miguel Primo de Rivera because fans would whistle when the Spanish national anthem was played. But during General Francisco Franco's 1939-75 dictatorship -- which repressed the Catalan language and nationalism -- the stadium was one of the few public spaces where the use of Catalan was tolerated. ""Barca was a substitute parliament"" at the time, said Feixa. ""What could not be said in the democratic arena was expressed by football."" And he believes the club continues to play this role today. Acts in support of Catalan independence at the Camp Nou have become more common in recent years as backing for secession has risen throughout the region, even though about half of all Catalans still want to remain a part of Spain. ""FC Barcelona is a nation that represents Catalonia,"" said Brazilian superstar Neymar on his departure from Barca to Paris Saint-Germain last month. At home matches Barca fans routinely chant ""Independence!"", jeer the Spanish national anthem and the king when he attends games, and wave Catalan separatist flags. A placard permanently hung at one end of the stadium reads: ""Catalonia is not Spain"". European football governing body UEFA, which opposes political messages in stadiums, has slapped Barcelona with fines over these acts, which has angered some of the club's Catalan supporters. The president of the Spanish league, Javier Trebas, a staunch defender of a united Spain, has warned that Barcelona would not be able to compete in La Liga if Catalonia gains independence. ""This has a counter-productive effect. Instead of calming people, they go even further,"" said Feixa. Catalan historian Jordi Casassas said Barca supporters have long had the idea the club is ""persecuted"" economically and legally. Many believe Pique is regularly jeered while playing for Spain because of his pro-Catalan stance off the pitch, Casassas added. Barca's training academy has formed top stars such as Xavi, Messi and Andres Iniesta but the club also long provided a bully pulpit for pro-independence advocates. Back in 1936 the president of the club, Josep Sunol, was a left-wing nationalist lawmaker. He was executed that year at the start of Spain's civil war by Franco's forces, becoming a martyr. Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola, a former Barca captain and coach, has long openly campaigned for Catalan independence. The club's ""most glorious period"" took place during the 2003-2010 mandate of pro-independence Joan Laporta as president, said Ramon Miravitllaas, journalist and author of the book: ""The Political Function of Barcelona"". But he complains that by adopting a position in favour of an independence referendum the club was ""breaking its own cohesion"" by excluding supporters who oppose secession. Barca are ""a sauce with many flavours"", with players and supporters from all social classes and parts of the world, and different political opinions, he added. Feixa points out that the club's founder, Joan Gamper, was Swiss, its most emblematic player, the late Johan Cruyff, was Dutch and its current star Messi is Argentine."

602,27/09/2017,22:59,Unlucky Coates gifts Barca win at Sporting,Sebastian Coates scored an unfortunate second-half own goal to gift Barcelona a 1-0 victory away to Sporting Lisbon in the Champions League on Wednesday.,"The Uruguayan centre-back unwittingly deflected a Lionel Messi free-kick into his own net on 49 minutes to hand the Spaniards a second successive win to start Group D. The five-time European champions head the section with a maximum six points, ahead of both Sporting and Juventus on three, with Olympiakos yet to pick up a point. Ernesto Valverde's Barca have proved unstoppable in La Liga so far, winning their opening six matches to pull seven points clear of defending champions Real Madrid while vanquishing Juve in their first group game in Europe. Messi drew level with former long-serving Barca captain Carles Puyol by making his 593rd appearance for the club -- trailing only Andres Iniesta (637) and Xavi (767). But the Argentine, one goal away from 100 in European competition, was largely subdued during a quiet first half in the Portuguese capital, with Cristiano Piccini flashing narrowly over for Sporting on 15 minutes. Sergi Roberto slipped in Luis Suarez as Barca finally threatened just before the half hour, but the Uruguayan was denied by Rui Patricio with the Portugal goalkeeper then holding well from a Messi header. Sporting's Marco Acuna tested Marc-Andre ter Stegen with a low drive, but Messi gradually grew in influence as the interval approached. He weaved his way through the home defence on 43 minutes only to find an old foe, ex-Real Madrid full-back Fabio Coentrao, slide across superbly to block his goal-bound effort. Sporting lost striker Seydou Doumbia to injury prior to the break, the Ivorian seemingly hurting himself following a theatrical fall on the edge of the Barca penalty area that earned him a yellow card. Dutch international Bas Dost, who scored a league-best 34 goals last campaign, replace Doumbia, but Barca broke the deadlock early into the second half as a Messi set-piece ricocheted about the Sporting six-yard box before trickling beyond Patricio. The Argentine's curling delivery in from the right brushed two Sporting heads with Suarez then nodding the ball against Coates who could only watch in horror as it dribbled over the line. Suarez unleashed a snapshot straight at Patricio as Barca searched for a second, but the visitors were grateful to Ter Stegen as the Germany international thwarted Bruno Fernandes' attempt for an equaliser. Former Tottenham Hotspur midfielder Paulinho went close to notching his third goal in four games late on when Patricio repelled the Brazilian, but Barca stretched their unbeaten run against Portuguese clubs to 15 matches dating back to 1987."
603,27/09/2017,16:39,"Barca focusing on football, not independence",Barcelona tried to distance themselves on Wednesday from a political crisis enveloping Spain ahead of an October 1 referendum on Catalan independence called by pro-secessionist politicians.,"The behaviour of fans at Barca's 99,000 capacity Camp Nou will be under the spotlight as they host Las Palmas in La Liga on Sunday, whilst the potentially historic vote is taking place. ""It will be an important day in the history of our country, but we have to focus on football,"" said Barca vice-president Jordi Cardoner. Spain's government and the country's constitutional court have declared the vote illegal. Among a number of measures being taken to impede the referendum, 14 regional government officials were detained last week. In response, Barca released a strongly-worded statement condemning the arrests in ""the defence of the nation, to democracy, to freedom of speech, and to self-determination."" A powerful symbol of Catalonia, Barcelona have been cautious not to support either side of the independence debate, but have backed the wealthy north-eastern Spanish region's right to decide at the ballot box. Chants in support of independence are also common at the Camp Nou in the 17th minute of each match to mark the fall of Catalonia in the Spanish War of Succession in 1714. ""I think that all members, fans and supporters will express what they think is right,"" added Cardoner on the likelihood of more pro-independence chants. ""We would ask that there is respect and above all that is happening in the country, we concentrate on the competition. ""For all of us in the stadium that day, the important thing is to win the game."" However, Cardoner did confirm Barca's players will perform their warm-up for Sunday's match in shirts matching the colour of the Senyera Catalan flag."
604,20/09/2017,00:04,Messi hits four as Barca maintain perfect start,Lionel Messi added four more goals to his soaring early season tally as a much-changed Barcelona maintained their 100 percent start to La Liga by routing Eibar 6-1 on Tuesday.,"Paulinho and Denis Suarez also netted for the second consecutive game as Barca stretched their lead at the top of La Liga to seven points over Real Madrid, who host Real Betis on Wednesday. Earlier, Valencia moved up to third as Simone Zaza scored a seven-minute hat-trick in a 5-0 thrashing of Malaga. Barca boss Ernesto Valverde heavily rotated his side for the first time since taking charge with six changes from Saturday's hard-fought 2-1 win at Getafe. And contrary to their fortunes last season, Barca's back-ups proved Valverde can take the luxury of resting some of his star names with Paulinho particularly impressive on his first start. The hosts had goalkeeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen to thank early on for not falling behind though as he made a smart save when one-on-one with Sergi Enrich just four minutes in. Messi opened the scoring in nonchalant fashion from the penalty spot on 21 minutes after Nelson Semedo had been felled by an ungainly challenge from Alejandro Galvez. Paulinho's 40-million-euro ($48 million) signing from Guangzhou Evergrande was one of a series of moves that drew stinging criticism for Barca's board following Neymar's world-record departure for Paris Saint-Germain. However, after coming off the bench to score the winner at Getafe, Paulinho powered home his second Barca goal from Suarez's corner seven minutes before half-time. Paulinho also played his part in Barca's third with a cute dummy that freed Messi and, when his shot was parried by Marko Dmitrovic, Suarez fired home the rebound. Enrich reduced the arrears when he capitalised on some sloppy Barca defending to slot home David Junca's cross. However, Messi quickly restored Barca's three-goal lead with a lovely measured finish from the edge of the box. The five-time world player of the year completed his 43rd career hat-trick just after the hour mark by prodding through Dmitrovic's legs from Paulinho's pass. And he added his 12th goal in just eight games this season three minutes from time after a neat one-two with Aleix Vidal. Barca lead second-placed Sevilla, who host Las Palmas on Wednesday, by five points with Valencia now just a point further adrift as their unbeaten start to the season under new coach Marcelino Garcia Toral continued at Mestalla. By contrast, a fifth straight defeat to start the season sees Malaga slip to bottom of the table and plunges coach Michel into further danger of becoming the second La Liga boss to be sacked this term. ""I am tremendously proud of the performance of the players. It is a joy to be able to enjoy it with our fans,"" said Marcelino. Santi Mina got the rout started after just 17 minutes with a neat header from Carles Soler's cross. Zaza then completed his first ever hat-trick with three clinical close-range finishes between the 55th and 62nd minute before substitute Rodrigo rounded off the scoring. And the former Juventus striker shrugged off a bust-up with Marcelino after being dropped for Saturday's 1-1 draw at Levante. ""I didn't have anything to prove,"" Zaza told BeIN Sports Spain. ""What happened on Saturday is already forgotten, I think it is normal that a player is angry when he doesn't play."""
605,19/09/2017,02:02,"Ronaldo back for Real, Deulofeu in for Dembele","Barcelona begin a four-month stretch without injured club record signing Ousmane Dembele, but will be expected to sweep aside Eibar to continue their 100 percent start to La Liga on Tuesday.","Cristiano Ronaldo returns from a five-match ban for Real Madrid 24 hours later at home to Real Betis, whilst Atletico Madrid face a daunting trip to Athletic Bilbao. Here, AFP Sports highlights five things to look out for in this midweek's fifth round of La Liga fixtures. Dembele's prolonged absence hands Gerard Deulofeu a chance he could only have dreamed about when resigning for his boyhood club in June. At the time Deulofeu was seen as able deputy to back up a front three of Neymar, Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez. But the 23-year-old has already enjoyed over three times as many minutes in his second spell at Barca than his first due to Neymar's departure and Dembele's misfortune. Deulofeu now has the chance he craved of a run in the Barca side until the new year and could even cement his place in the Spain squad for next year's World Cup if he turns his potential into consistent performances. A Suarez was back on the scoresheet for Barca at the weekend, but it was Denis who netted off the bench as Luis endured another 90 minutes to forget. The Uruguayan has scored just once this season having rushed back from an expected month-long knee injury layoff in just two weeks. Suarez looks slow, cumbersome and miles off the player who scored 59 goals two seasons ago. The visit of Eibar could be just what he needs to reboot, though, as he has bagged five in five games against the Basques and scored in all of his last four matches against them. ""I hope it is for the last game this season,"" said Zinedine Zidane at the prospect of missing Ronaldo for Sunday's vital 3-1 win at Real Sociedad as the European champions got back to winning ways in La Liga. The World Player of the Year's ""persecution"", as he described his ban, is over as he will be free to make his first league appearance of the season against Betis on Wednesday. His absence was most keenly felt in profligate Madrid displays in dropping points at home to Valencia and Levante. Ronaldo showed Real what they were missing with a double against APOEL Nicosia last midweek. But his enforced absence could yet benefit Madrid as it did last season when a delayed start to the campaign through injury meant a fresher Ronaldo hit top form in the final months of the season, scoring 10 goals in the Champions League from the quarter-finals on. A trip to Bilbao is often a litmus test for whether Atletico can mount a serious title challenge. It was after victory at San Mames in their title winning campaign in 2013/14 that Diego Simeone admitted for the first time his side could beat Madrid and Barca to La Liga. Atletico's unbeaten start to the season will be severely tested over the next week with Sevilla and Chelsea also visiting the Wanda Metropolitano. However, already trailing Barca by four points, Atletico can't ill afford that gap to grow if they are to maintain hope of a serious title charge. Luis Zubeldia became La Liga's first managerial casualty of the season after just four games in charge of Alaves without a point or even a goal. Malaga are the only other side yet to register a point and Michel could be next to go with another defeat at Valencia on Tuesday. Pepe Mel's position at Deportivo la Coruna is also in danger should the Galicians fail to get their first win of the season by inflicting more pain on Alaves."
606,18/09/2017,13:40,Dembele to undergo surgery on Tuesday,Barcelona's record 105 million-euro ($125 million) signing Ousmane Dembele will undergo surgery on the torn hamstring that has ruled him out of action for up to four months in Helsinki on Tuesday.,"""Dembele travelled on Monday morning to Helsinki, Finland, where he will undergo surgery to repair a rupture of the biceps femoris tendon in his left thigh,"" Barcelona said in a statement on Monday. ""Dembele was accompanied by team physician, Dr. Ricard Pruna. Dembele will be operated on Tuesday by Dr. Sakari Orava."" In pictures published by Spanish sports daily Marca, Dembele needed the aid of a wheelchair as he left Barcelona airport for the Finnish capital. The French international has made just three appearances for Barca since sealing his move from Borussia Dortmund last month for a fee that could rise to as much as 145 million euros based on performance-related bonuses. However, he looks set to miss the rest of the year after pulling his hamstring just 29 minutes into Saturday's 2-1 win at Getafe. The 20-year-old may have paid a heavy price for missing most of his pre-season preparation as he went on strike from training at Dortmund to try and force through his dream move to the Camp Nou. He will be sidelined for the rest of Barca's Champions League group campaign and faces a race against time to take part in the first El Clasico of the season against Real Madrid on December 23. At international level, Dembele will also be absent for France's final two World Cup qualifiers away to Bulgaria and at home to Belarus next month."

608,16/09/2017,22:55,"Griezmann saves Atletico blushes, Barca 7 clear of Madrid","Antoine Griezmann ensured Malaga didn't spoil Atletico Madrid's moving in party at their new 68,000 Wanda Metropolitano stadium with the only goal in a 1-0 win on Saturday.","The French international, restored to the side after a two-game La Liga ban, swept home Angel Correa's cross on the hour mark to move Atletico up to third in the table. Atletico remain four points adrift of Barcelona, though, as Paulinho scored his first Barca goal six minutes from time to continue their 100 percent record in a 2-1 win at Getafe. Atletico boss Diego Simeone had called on fans to recreate the intimidating atmosphere of the Vicente Calderon by turning their new home into a ""pressure cooker."" The noise matched the pre-match pomp as Spain's royal air force took part in a flyover, whilst the match ball was delivered by paragliders. Spanish king Felipe VI, an Atletico fan, was also in attendance, but after all the pre-match fan fare, there wasn't much for the crowd to get enthused about in the opening 45 minutes. Correa had Atletico's only two clear chances of the half as he blazed over and straight at Roberto Jimenez. At the other end Jan Oblak was forced into a fine save from ex-Atletico striker Borja Baston as Malaga broke dangerously. Atletico started the second period brighter as Roberto denied Koke and Saul Niguez before the deadlock was broken on the hour mark. Correa burst clear down the right and his low cross was expertly guided inside the near post by Griezmann on his weaker right foot. Malaga had one late chance to rain on Atletico's parade two minutes from time, but Oblak was again up to the task to turn Diego Rolan's fierce effort over the bar. Barca were also made to struggle as they had to come from behind at Getafe to open up a seven-point lead over Real Madrid, who travel to Real Sociedad on Sunday. However, Barca could be without record signing Ousmane Dembele for a number of weeks after the French winger hobbled off in the first half with a hamstring injury. ""Fortunately, it was an important test for us. We managed to turn the game around and that power of reaction the team had means a lot,"" said Barca boss Ernesto Valverde. Paulinho's 40 million-euro signing from Guangzhou Evergrande was just one of a number of much-criticised moves by the Barca board following the departure of Neymar to Paris Saint-Germain. But the Brazilian international showed his worth by smashing home Lionel Messi's through ball to score the winner. ""I'm very happy to score the goal. It was the winner which was the most important thing,"" Paulinho told Barca TV. ""It was a difficult game because Getafe have players with quality and we conceded the first goal but we were calm, had patience and went looking for the result."" Barca had barely replaced Dembele with Gerard Deulofeu before they fell behind six minutes before half-time. Sergi Roberto's headed clearance fell invitingly for Gaku Shibasaki, who made his name with two goals against Real Madrid in last year's Club World Cup final for Kashima Antlers, to thunder an unstoppable dipping volley beyond Marc-Andre ter Stegen. Valverde made another change at the start of the second period as Denis Suarez replaced Iniesta. And it was the substitute who inspired Barca's revival as he collected Roberto's cut-back from the right wing before bending the ball high past Vicente Guaita into the top corner. With Messi well-marshalled and Luis Suarez way off form for most of the second period, Getafe had chances to grab a winner themselves. However, the hosts were hit with a sucker punch when Paulinho burst onto Messi's through ball and smashed across the despairing Guaita into the far corner."
609,12/09/2017,22:44,Messi double inspires Barca to Juventus revenge,Barcelona defied an outgoing off-field crisis as another Lionel Messi-inspired display exacted revenge on Juventus to open their Champions League campaign with a resounding 3-0 win on Tuesday.,"Messi was involved in all three goals as he beat Gianluigi Buffon for the first time in his career to open the floodgates just before half-time. Ivan Rakitic added a second after Messi's run and cross opened up the Juventus defence before the Argentine rounded off the scoring by drilling home his second of the evening 19 minutes from time. Victory puts Barca on top of Group D alongside Sporting Lisbon, who were 3-2 winners at Olympiakos. Barca's start to the season has been dominated by calls for president Josep Maria Bartomeu to resign following Neymar's world record move to Paris Saint-Germain and the Catalan giants' bungled moves to replace the Brazilian. However, Ousmane Dembele impressed on his full debut following a 105 million-euro ($126 million) move from Borussia Dortmund, as Barca proved as long as they have Messi there is life after Neymar. Juventus showed even more upheaval since the sides last met in last season's quarter-finals with six changes from their trip to the Camp Nou just five months ago. The Italian champions progressed comprehensively 3-0 on aggregate back then and threatened to expose Barca again early on with Marc-Andre ter Stegen forced into three early saves to deny Mattia de Sciglio, Paulo Dybala and Miralem Pjanic. Dembele was showing plenty of promise, but often tried to beat one man too many in his quest to impress as Barca struggled to create early on. Their best effort before opening the scoring came when a Messi free-kick rebounded back into Luis Suarez's path and his fierce effort was turned over by Buffon. Dembele was involved in the move as Messi broke his personal duck against Buffon in the final minute of the first half. Messi picked up the Frenchman's pass before exchanging a one-two with Suarez and firing with unerring accuracy just inside the far post. Juventus had a big chance to respond right at the start of the second half, but Dybala couldn't match his international teammate's finish and he lifted his shot over the bar. Messi was inches away from his second as another rasping left-foot drive came back off the inside of the post, rebounded off the back of Buffon's head and dropped just wide. Yet, Messi was also fortunate to escape his first ever red card at club level moments later as he was booked by Slovenian referee Tomaz Klancnik for his attempts to get a Juventus player cautioned. Aided by his teammates, though, Messi continued his protests and could easily have been shown a second yellow by a more stringent official. His clash with the referee only seemed to inspire Messi to greater heights as he drove through the Juventus defence once more and, when his low cross was only partially cleared by Stefano Sturaro, Rakitic slotted home the rebound. Buffon momentarily denied Messi his double with a fine save from a free-kick. However, the veteran goalkeeper was helpless once more 21 minutes from time when Messi cut inside onto his left foot and buried the ball into the bottom corner for his eighth goal of the season already."
610,11/09/2017,02:23,Battle for control of Barca overshadows Juventus reunion,"A 5-0 derby win, an assist for 105 million euro ($126 million) purchase Ousmane Dembele on his debut and a four-point La Liga lead over Real Madrid ought to have brought some semblance of relief to Barcelona's beleaguered board.","Yet, no sooner had the celebrations died down from Luis Suarez's finish from Dembele's cross in the final minute of Saturday's thrashing of Espanyol, than cries for president Josep Maria Bartomeu to resign rang around the Camp Nou. In the eyes of the fans, Bartomeu and his cohorts deserve no reflected glory for the players' performances as they have been in open conflict with the dressing room during a chaotic summer precipitated by Neymar's departure for Paris Saint-Germain. Juventus' visit in the Champions League on Tuesday (1845GMT) could have offered the chance of a new start and for revenge for last season's quarter-final defeat by the Italian champions. Instead, the battle for control of the club between fans, players and president rages on. Even after Saturday's rout, supporters formed large queues to sign a vote of no confidence petition launched by a former presidential candidate Agusti Benedito. For all Barca's off-field problems, on the pitch they can still rely on Lionel Messi to iron out most difficulties. The five-time World Player of the Year's hat-trick at the weekend took his tally for the season already to six. However, Bartomeu's handling of Messi's future has become another stick with which to beat the club's board. Barca announced an agreement with Messi, whose current contract expires at the end of the season, to extend his deal to 2021 back on July 5. Yet, he has still to put pen to paper despite Bartomeu's insistence the wait for Messi's signature is merely a matter of time. The club claim the case of captain Andres Iniesta, whose deal also runs out next year, is the same. Bartomeu told Catalan daily Mundo Deportivo last week there was an agreement in principle for the 33-year-old to renew, only for the mild-mannered Iniesta to flatly refute that claim less than 24 hours later. The board's decision to repeatedly attack and even sue Neymar for breach of contract has also backfired. The ink on a club statement outlining their reasons for taking the Brazilian to court hadn't dried by the time a number of Barca's leading players including Messi and Suarez posted pictures online of them embracing their old teammate. ""This president is a joke,"" Neymar replied on social media site Instagram last week. The open conflict between the players and board was most clearly evidenced when Gerard Pique revealed the players knew of Neymar's intentions to leave as far back as Messi's wedding on June 30. Senior board members claim to have not been informed until days before Neymar's departure on August 2. Neymar's world record 222 million euro move sparked a wild goose chase in the final few weeks of the transfer window at Barca. Dozens of targets came and went with only Dembele and Brazilian international Paulinho arriving for grossly inflated fees. A 5-1 Spanish Super Cup aggregate thrashing by Real Madrid piled more pressure on Bartomeu. But league wins over Real Betis, Alaves and Espanyol have only served to show how much Barca need Messi. Bartomeu needs him to sign his new deal even more to quench the thirst for his resignation."
611,08/09/2017,02:00,"Dembele debuts, Atletico face resurgent Valencia",The most expensive player in Barcelona's history will take to the field for the first time on Saturday as Ousmane Dembele debuts in a Catalan derby against Espanyol.,"Atletico Madrid travel to a revitalised Valencia in the headline clash of the weekend, whilst there is an early start for champions Real Madrid. Here, AFP Sports looks at five things to watch from the La Liga weekend. The arrival of the 105-million-euro ($125 million) Frenchman is a much-needed tonic for Barca in the midst of continuing institutional chaos with ongoing public clashes between the board and leading players. President Josep Maria Bartomeu claimed new contracts for Lionel Messi and Andres Iniesta, whose deals expire next summer, were a matter of time on Tuesday only for Iniesta to flatly deny that claim a day later. On the field Barca need to ensure they don't suffer their habitual hangover from international breaks known locally as the ""FIFA virus"". This time last year Barca suffered a shock 2-1 home defeat to Alaves as Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez started on the bench following their international commitments. With Messi and Suarez only arriving back in the Catalan capital on Thursday after two crucial World Cup qualifiers in South America, Espanyol will rarely have a better chance for a first win at the Camp Nou since 2009. It has been a highly promising week for Atletico as inspirational coach Diego Simeone extended his contract till 2020, whilst the pitch was laid among finishing touches to the club's new 68,000 capacity stadium. Since Simeone took charge in 2011, Valencia have had 11 coaches. However, their latest hire in Marcelino finally appears to putting Los Che back on the right track. Valencia took a point from a thrilling 2-2 draw away to Real Madrid before the international break and have since been further boosted by the arrivals of Goncalo Guedes and Andreas Pereira on loan from PSG and Manchester United. Should Atletico emerge unscathed from the Mestalla not having lost ground on Real after three away games to start their season, a serious title challenge is realistic. La Liga president Javier Tebas has continued his war against PSG's free-spending since snatching Neymar away from Barcelona, accusing the Parisians and Manchester City of ""peeing into the pool"" in their disrespect for financial fair play. Tebas' concerns arise from his ambition for La Liga to rival the Premier League's interest around the world and getting television rights deals to match. With that in mind, kick-off times in Spain have become gradually earlier in recent years with an eye on Asian markets. Real's kick-off against Levante at 1300 local time (1100 GMT) on Saturday will go head-to-head with City's blockbuster clash against Liverpool. Overshadowed by the wealth and glamour of Real and Atletico, two of Madrid's more modest sides Leganes and Getafe have fought out their own rivalry in the lower divisions. However, they clash for the first time ever in the top flight on Friday night at Leganes' 11,500 capacity Butarque with the hosts even having the chance to leapfrog Barcelona to the top of the table after two wins from their opening two games. Exactly a year from the day he left, Lucas Perez returned to Deportivo la Coruna from Arsenal on the final day of the transfer window. ""Money doesn't make me happy. I move for emotions, for the feelings that I have,"" said Perez, claiming he had turned down more lucrative offers to force through a return to his native Galicia. Perez scored 17 goals in the 2015/16 season before his move and will need to fire if Depor are to avoid another year of battling relegation, starting with the visit of Real Sociedad on Sunday."
612,05/09/2017,23:26,Neymar: Barça president a 'joke',"Neymar labelled Barcelona president Josep Maria Bartomeu a ""joke"" as the war of wards between Barcelona's beleaguered board and the Brazilian star continued on Tuesday.","In interviews with Catalan newspapers Mundo Deportivo and Sport, Bartomeu claimed Barca would be better off without Neymar this season following his world record 222 million euro ($263.7 million) move to Paris Saint-Germain. With Bartomeu's handling of Barca's haphazard transfer policy being heavily criticised, he described the loss of Neymar as an ""opportunity"" for Barca to rebuild their midfield rather than pile resources into a superstar front three of Neymar, Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez. ""The trident was very good but it had its consequences,"" Bartomeu told Sport. ""It is an opportunity to return to the collective football in the middle of the field, which traditionally was Barca's strength. ""It is an opportunity, with a new coach, a new project. We need to stop being pessimistic!"" Bartomeu also criticised Neymar and his father and agent Neymar Sr's exit strategy. ""This president is a joke,"" Neymar replied in a comment about the news on social media site Instagram. A vote of no confidence motion has been launched by former Barca presidential candidate Agusti Benedito that could oust Bartomeu if it receives enough support from the club's members in the coming weeks. Neymar's departure sparked a shopping spree from Barca, who landed 20-year-old French winger Ousmane Dembele for an initial 105 million euro fee from Borussia Dortmund and Paulinho for 40 million from Chinese club Guangzhou Evergrande. However, Barca missed out on a host of other targets, including Liverpool's Philippe Coutinho, blaming the rampant inflation in the transfer market caused by PSG and Abu Dhabi-backed Manchester City. La Liga has asked UEFA to investigate both PSG and City for breaches of financial fair play rules. ""Qatar and Abu Dhabi are two countries that have two clubs,"" added Bartomeu. ""If Bayern Munich, Manchester United, Real Madrid or Arsenal buy a player from you, you know (the money) comes from football. ""But these two clubs distort the market."" Bartomeu also insisted a four-year contract extension for Lionel Messi has been signed by the player's agent and father, Jorge Horacio Messi. Barca announced an agreement with the five-time World Player of the Year in July, but Messi himself is yet to put pen to paper amid rumours he is unhappy with the running of the club. Messi's current deal expires in 2018 meaning he could leave Barca for free next summer. ""It is all agreed and signed,"" Bartomeu added. ""There are three contracts: one with Messi's foundation, that is signed by the president of the foundation and the player's brother; a contract with Leo Messi's image rights, that his father and administrator of his company have signed; and the work contract that Leo's father has signed."""

""Liverpool put a price of 200 million euros on a player that we wanted,"" Soler told reporters at a press conference held to explain Barca's haphazard signing policy this summer. Barca ended the window making a slight profit on transfers after receiving a world record 222 million euros from Neymar's move to Paris Saint-Germain. Despite splashing over 190 million on five signings, most notably 105 million euros on 20-year-old French winger Ousmane Dembele, Soler claimed Barca wouldn't been drawn into an arms race with the cash-rich Premier League and Qatar-backed PSG. ""We didn't want to put at risk the heritage of the club. This is a club of 150,000 members and has to be managed with coherence and responsiblity,"" added Soler. ""We won't get involved in the game of a market that has lost its way. ""This board won't put the club at risk. UEFA and the European Clubs Association (ECA) have to reflect and make a decision."" UEFA announced on Friday that PSG will be investigated for a potential breach of financial fair play (FFP) rules after adding Kylian Mbappe to the capture of Neymar from Monaco in a deal that could rise to 180 million euros. Soler dismissed claims that Barca's status as one of the world's leading clubs is being threatened by their inability or unwillingness to match the lavish spending of other clubs. ""We haven't lost any international status for having common sense and not putting the financial viability of the club at risk."" Barca also insist that five-time World Player of the Year Lionel Messi will soon sign a new contract, tying him to the club until 2021. The club announced the agreement of the deal with Messi, 30, on July 5, but the Argentine has yet to formally put pen to paper. ""I want to send a message of calm to the members.

""Barca will not sign Coutinho,"" Barcelona-based sports daily Sport reported in their online edition, citing sources close to the player. ""The club has taken the decision to not insist in the final hours of the market."" Barcelona have been under huge pressure to reinvest the 222 million euros the club banked from Neymar's world record transfer to Paris Saint-Germain last month. The Catalans have splashed 192 million euros on five signings, including 105 million on 20-year-old French winger Ousmane Dembele in a deal that could yet rise to 145 million depending on performance related bonuses. Coutinho hasn't played for Liverpool this season after submitting a transfer request with the club citing a back injury. However, he showed no sign of discomfort as he came off the bench to score as Brazil saw off Ecuador 2-0 in World Cup qualifying on Thursday before appearing to break down in tears during his celebration. ""Unfortunately, instead of being a happy time for him, for his family, it's a moment of anguish, disappointment and sadness,"" Neymar said of his international teammate's mood.

And Dembele expects to learn firsthand from Messi, who he described as the best player in history. ""It's an honour to be a part of Lionel Messi's team,"" added Dembele. ""He's a great player, the best player in the world, the best in the history of football and I am very happy to play in his team. ""I will learn, watch how he plays, and how he is on and off the field."" Dembele's Barca career got off to an inauspicious start as his presentation in front of 18,000 waiting fans at the Camp Nou was delayed for nearly two hours due to a paperwork issue in releasing his registration from Dortmund. With the supporters' patience tested there were whistles during the delay and chants for Barca president Josep Maria Bartomeu to resign. Barca's board has been under huge pressure due to the club's fading fortunes on the field and being caught cold by Neymar's decision to leave. The attendance was also well down on the 50,000 fans that welcomed Neymar on his presentation four years ago. ""With a player like Ousmane we have a competitive team that can aim, like every year, for the greatest success,"" said Bartomeu. Dembele finally emerged in Barca's famous red and blue strip, sporting the number 11 jersey vacated by Neymar. However, he will have to wait until at least September 9 to make his debut when Barca host Espanyol in a Catalan derby. Dembele announced himself as one of Europe's top prospects with a stellar season at Dortmund, scoring 10 goals, after joining from Rennes for just 15 million euros a year ago. However, he had been suspended by Dortmund since he boycotted training on August 10 in protest after the German club rejected Barca's first bid. Dembele becomes Barca's fifth signing of the summer after Marlon Santos, Gerard Deulofeu, Nelson Semedo and Paulinho. And the Catalan giants intend on completing at least one more deal before the transfer window closes on Friday with Liverpool's Philippe Coutinho top of their wish list.

The Ivorian blasted Nice in an explosive interview with Barcelona-based Mundo Deportivo on Monday, claiming the club had renagued on a deal to sell him to Barca by upping their asking price due to interest from Paris Saint-Germain. ""He is totally ruled out,"" said Fernandez. ""He is a player with excellent conditions, but, having analysed things, the priority is other positions."""
620,28/08/2017,14:08,Seri blasts Nice over broken Barca dream,Nice midfielder Jean Michael Seri has blamed the French club's greed for the breakdown of his dream transfer to Barcelona in an explosive interview with Catalan sports daily Mundo Deportivo.,"Seri's move to the Catalan giants broke down after Nice's Champions League qualifying defeat to Napoli last week amid reports Nice had upped their asking price due to interest from Paris Saint-Germain. ""After the match (against Napoli) I met with Barcelona's directors for more than an hour and they didn't tell me anything about not going through with signing me,"" said the Ivorian. ""I went home really happy; then the next day I read the news. I was stunned to see the move had broken down in an incomprehensible manner for me. ""I went to the Nice offices to see the board and find out what happened. I exploded! The walls shook. They didn't say anything to me, they didn't look me straight in the eye. ""It was clear what had happened. They had promised me one thing, but didn't keep their word and asked for more money."" Relations between Barca and PSG have been strained by Neymar's world record 222 million euro ($265 million) move to the French side, whilst Barca have sued the Brazilian star for breach of contract. Barca have already reinvested a large proportion of their windfall from Neymar's departure by making French winger Ousmane Dembele the second most expensive player ever in a 105 million euro move that could rise to 147 million depending on Dembele's performance. Seri remains hopeful he could yet be a Barcelona player before the transfer window closes this week, but insists he is also wanted by a host of other top European clubs if Barca's interest fades. ""I want to be optimistic and think that there is still a chance for the two clubs to get back around the table and reach an agreement,"" he added. ""We are not taking about any other club. ""Big European clubs like Juventus, PSG, Arsenal, Borussia Dortmund and Liverpool want to sign me."""
621,25/08/2017,17:54,Wunderkind Dembele has Barcelona wish granted,Fleet-footed winger Ousmane Dembele has finally been granted his dream move to Barcelona as Borussia Dortmund pocket a massive transfer fee for the precocious French talent.,"Having forced Dortmund's hand by going on strike and refusing to train, the German club were left with little choice but to suspend the temperamental 20-year-old and eventually sell him to the Spanish giants. The 105 million euros ($125 million) set to be forked out by Barcelona, not including potential add-ons, on Friday dwarfs the 15m euros Dortmund paid Rennes for Dembele in July 2016. The high-profile move on a five-year deal means Dembele will fill the boots of his idol, Neymar, as Barcelona look to bolster their attack after the Brazilian's record move to Paris Saint-Germain. Dembele joined Rennes' academy when he was 13 and having made his first team debut in November 2015, his silky skills combined with sudden bursts of pace and lethal crosses quickly dazzled defences. Barely into his teenage years at the time, Dembele said his inspirations were Lionel Messi and Neymar - the former will be his new team-mate and the latter is the man he is replacing. ""They're great players. I try to follow their games and copy what they do in training,"" said a youthful Dembele while still at Rennes. The 2015/16 season saw Dembele make his breakthrough, scoring 12 times in 26 games for Rennes in the French league and setting up five goals. In March 2016, he scored a hat-trick in the derby against Nantes in a 4-1 win just a couple months shy of his 18th birthday. The French club's then sports director Mikael Silvestre compared Dembele to Cristiano Ronaldo. ""I saw Cristiano Ronaldo arrive at the same age at Manchester United and Ousmane has the same characteristics which remind me of young Cristiano,"" said Silvestre. ""A talent like Dembele doesn't come along every season. You are lucky if you have one every 10 years."" Dortmund beat off reported interest from Barcelona, Manchester United and Bayern Munich to sign Dembele. The Frenchman announced his arrival with an audacious goal on Dortmund's tour of China, before the 2016/17 season, when the then 19-year-old made a mockery of the United defence to fire home in a 3-0 win. Despite the trauma of the April bomb attack on the Dortmund team bus, Dembele kept his composure to score when the Champions League quarter-final first leg was replayed a day later, resulting in a 3-2 defeat to Monaco. Arguably his best and most important goal for Dortmund was his left-footed strike to seal a 3-2 victory at Bayern Munich in the semi-finals of the German Cup. In May's final in Berlin, he gave Dortmund an early lead before Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang scored a second in a 2-1 win over Eintracht Frankfurt as Dembele claimed the only title of his career so far. Dortmund were able to hang onto Aubameyang, who attracted a reported offer of 80m euros from China's Tianjin Quanjian after scoring 31 league goals last season to dethrone Robert Lewandowski as the Bundesliga's top scorer. But despite having a contract until 2021, Borussia were effectively powerless to dampen Dembele's dreams once Barcelona came calling."
622,24/08/2017,20:54,Dembele on verge of 150m Barca deal - reports,Ousmane Dembele could soon become the second most expensive player in history as reports claim Barcelona have finally agreed a deal that could rise to 150 million euros ($177 million) for the wantaway 20-year-old.,"According to media outlets in Spain, France and Germany, Barca are prepared to break their own transfer record with an initial offer of 120 million euros supplemented by 30 million extra in add-ons. ""We're getting nearer to a decision, but one hasn't been reached yet,"" Dortmund's managing director Hans-Joachim Watzke told Sky, denying claims a deal had been finalised between the clubs' directors at Thursday's Champions League draw in Monaco. ""We are not the sort of club who does our business in public, we can only say that there is no fixed agreement."" Dembele, who cost Dortmund just 15 million euros from Rennes last year, has been suspended by Dortmund since he boycotted training on August 10 in protest after the German club rejected Barca's first bid. ""The club is working on the incorporation of players and when there is a definitive decision we will make an official announcement that explains the situation,"" Barca's general manager Pep Segura told BeIN Sports Spain. German newspaper Bild reported Dortmund could make an official announcement at midday (1000GMT) on Friday. Barcelona-based sports daily Mundo Deportivo claimed Barca are hopeful of presenting Dembele at the Camp Nou on Sunday or Monday. The saga also cost Dembele his place in the France squad for upcoming World Cup qualifiers against the Netherlands and Luxembourg on Thursday. ""Ousmane hasn't trained for a fortnight and he's waiting to see if the transfer will go ahead or won't go ahead,"" said France coach Didier Deschamps. Barca are in desperate need for reinforcements since being caught cold by Neymar's decision to join Paris Saint-Germain for a world record 222 million euros earlier this month. With just a week to go before the transfer window closes, the Catalan giants have had several attempts to land Dembele and Liverpool's Philippe Coutinho rebuffed, piling pressure onto already beleaguered president Josep Maria Bartomeu. Following Barca's 5-1 aggregate thrashing by Real Madrid in the Spanish Super Cup, the hashtag ""bartomeudimiteya"" (Bartomeu resign now) was a trending topic worldwide on Twitter. A growing split between Barca's top players and board was also evidenced this week as the likes of Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez posted photos on social media of them partying with Neymar just hours after the club announced they are suing the Brazilian for breach of contract. Barcelona were powerless to stop Neymar's move to PSG earlier this month as the French side met the buyout clause in his contract."

Barcelona are refusing to pay a 26-million-euro ($30.6 million) bonus to Neymar for signing a five-year contract renewal last year. In a separate issue, the Catalan giants are seeking 8.5 million euros in compensation from Neymar for breach of contract following his world record 222-million-euro move to PSG in August. Neymar's family hit back on Tuesday with their representatives expressing their ""surprise"" at Barcelona's compensation claim ""given that the player fully respected the contract valid at the time""."

England's Chelsea, Germans Bayern Munich, Monaco of France's Ligue 1, Portuguese giants Benfica, Serie A champions Juventus, Russians Spartak Moscow and Shakhtar Donetsk of Ukraine make up the rest of pot one. But if anything, pot two looks even stronger with both Manchester clubs, Borussia Dormtund, Atletico Madrid, Sevilla and Porto in alongside PSG and Barca. Dangerous sides including Tottenham Hotspur and Italian pair Napoli and Roma lurk in pot three, with Liverpool potentially joining them if they get past Hoffenheim on Wednesday evening. The final five qualifiers for the 32-team Champions League group stages will be known later on Wednesday.

626,22/08/2017,17:08,Barca seeking 8.5 million from Neymar over contract breach,"Barcelona are seeking at least 8.5 million euros ($10 million) from Neymar for breach of contract, the club said on Tuesday as the bitter fallout rumbles on from his world record 222-million-euro move to Paris Saint-Germain.","""In this lawsuit, the club demands the amount already paid as a bonus for the renewal of his contract for breach of contract, 8.5 million euros in damages, and an additional 10 percent in interests,"" Barcelona said in a statement. Neymar signed a new five-year deal with Barca in 2016, but the Catalans were powerless to stop his move to PSG just a year later as the French side met the buyout clause in his contract. Barca added the demand was lodged against Neymar on August 11 with Barcelona's employment court, eight days after his stunning move to Ligue 1. The Catalan giants have also passed the claim onto FIFA and the French Football Federation via the Spanish Football Federation to take what they see as ""the appropriate legal effects"". Moreover, Barca urged PSG to pay the amount they are seeking if Neymar -- who is reported to earn 30 million euros after tax for the next five years in Paris -- isn't able to meet their demands. The club's latest move comes two days after Neymar fiercely criticised Barcelona's under-fire board after scoring twice in a stunning home debut as PSG beat Toulouse 6-2 on Sunday. ""There are people in charge that shouldn't be there,"" Neymar told reporters. ""Barca deserve much more and everyone knows that."" Barcelona have also withheld a 26 million euro bonus due to Neymar for signing the renewal to his contract last year. ""The player hasn't fulfilled his contract with the club...given that breach the club will not pay this renewal bonus,"" Barcelona spokesman Josep Vives said on August 4."
627,22/08/2017,16:20,Dortmund stand ground with Barca-target Dembele,Borussia Dortmund say they will not negotiate with Barcelona over a price for Ousmane Dembele as the clock keeps ticking in their stand-off with the want-away winger.,"Dortmund suspended Dembele indefinitely on August 10 when the 20-year-old boycotted training in protest after the German club rejected an initial bid from Barcelona. The Spanish giants want to sign Dembele and Liverpool's Philippe Coutinho to replace Neymar, who left for Paris Saint-Germain for a record 222 million euros ($261m). However, Dembele has a Dortmund contract until 2021 and reports claim the Germans want 130 million euros for the player they paid Rennes 15m euros for last year. ""We are prepared to sell him and what we want is on the table,"" confirmed Dortmund's CEO Hans-Joachim Watzke, putting the ball firmly in Barcelona's court. ""When it's not met, Dembele will stay with us. ""We will not negotiate."" Last week, no sooner had Barcelona's general manager Pep Segura said they were ""close"" to a deal with Dembele than Watzke fired back things ""had not moved forward one millimetre"". Dembele has already quit his accommodation in Dortmund and moved back to France. However, if he fails in his bid to join Barcelona Watzke says he will have to eat significant humble pie with the Borussia squad. He was banned when Dortmund romped to a 3-0 win at Wolfsburg on Saturday in the opening Bundesliga match of the new season. Christian Pulisic, Dembele's replacement on the right wing, scored and set up a goal in a superb display. Officially, Watzke says Barcelona have until September 1, when the transfer window closes, to raise their offer. However, German daily Bild claim they have told Barcelona that they have until this Sunday to meet Dortmund's price. The ongoing saga has seen Watzke join calls for the transfer window to close one month sooner, on August 1 instead of September 1, to end a repeat performance. ""In the summer, the fans look forward to the season and when it starts, it should be about football, not this theatre,"" he grumbled. Having lost Robert Lewandowski in 2014 on a free-transfer to arch rivals Bayern, all Dortmund stars are now on water-tight contracts, which are regularly extended. Dortmund's stance with Dembele is a warning to any of their top players who might be tempted by big-name clubs. Particularly top scorer Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, who has made it clear he wants to play for Real Madrid one day. Dembele's attitude has been widely condemned in Germany, where there is a suspicion that the 20-year-old's behaviour has been heavily influenced by the Spanish giants. ""If Barcelona are behind it, then I have no respect for the club,"" Bayern Munich president Uli Hoeness said scornfully. Germany's head coach Joachim Loew says Dortmund are taking the correct stance over Dembele. ""I simply condemn it when a player who has a contract goes on strike and says that he wants to change clubs,"" said Germany's World Cup-winning coach. ""It is absurd when contracts are no longer worth anything. ""Dortmund's stance is absolutely right."" With Liverpool chasing Dortmund's US international Christian Pulisic, Borussia must show their players who's boss, added Hoeness. ""You have to show your strength as a big club, like Borussia Dortmund, either they get what they are asking for or, if not, then he stays. ""You have to show everyone who is lord in the house."""
628,20/08/2017,23:00,Barca honour terror attack victims in Betis win,"Barcelona got their La Liga season off to a winning start on Sunday, beating Real Betis 2-0 at a emotional Camp Nou following a pair of terrorist attacks in Catalonia.","Twin vehicle attacks on Thursday killed 14 people and wounded around 120 in Barcelona's bustling Las Ramblas boulevard and the nearby seaside resort of Cambrils. A minute's silence was held before kick-off, whilst Barcelona players wore black armbands and shirts with 'Barcelona' replacing individual names on the back. ""What happened was terrible, we hope this stops now because we are not afraid,"" Barca winger Gerard Deulofeu, who set up both goals, told BeIN Sports Spain. ""This victory is for those affected."" The decision for the match to go ahead with increased security measures put in place was part of a desire to ""recover normality"" in the words of Catalonia's president Carles Puigdemont. A defiant attitude was on show in the stands, although in common with many matches against weaker opposition, the 99,000 capacity Camp Nou was far from full. After the attack some fans, especially tourists, returned their tickets, the club said without giving figures. ""Their money was refunded to everyone, the circumstances are special and understandable,"" a club spokesman said. Fans in the Barca singing section borrowed a line from the club's anthem in a banner that read: ""No one can ever break us,"" whilst chants of ""we are not afraid"" rang out after the minute's silence. ""We can't live with fear, which is exactly the mentality that these situations normally cause and people don't want to leave the house,"" said Vanessa Hano, 28, an American Barcelona resident. ""I thought there would be like a collective hysteria but I see everything is normal,"" added Sandra Lorenzo, 41, as she sold drinks next to the stadium. ""I have worked here for 25 years at every match. They are not going to make me stay at home."" Prior to the attacks, Barca had endured a difficult start to the season on the field as shorn of Neymar following his world record 222 million euro ($261 million) move to Paris Saint-Germain, the Catalans were swept aside 5-1 on aggregate by Real Madrid in the Spanish Super Cup. Coach Ernesto Valverde admitted on Saturday events in the past few days had put the club's problems into perspective. However, despite also missing the injured Luis Suarez and Andres Iniesta, Barca rose to the challenge of raising the city's spirits with a dominant display. ""In the end you always have to move forward,"" said Valverde. ""Our idea was to be able to dedicate this victory to those affected."" With the mayor of Cambrils Cami Mendoza and chiefs of Catalonia's regional police force among those watching on, captain Lionel Messi led by example with Deolofeu and Paco Alcacer struggling to fill Suarez and Neymar's shoes up front. Messi smashed an early free-kick off the post and his presence was enough to pressure Alin Tosca to turn Deulofeu's low cross into his own net for the opener nine minutes before half-time. Deulofeu was the provider once more when Barca doubled their advantage three minutes later as Sergi Roberto slotted home from close range. Messi also posed the biggest threat of a low key second-half as he struck the woodwork twice more with rasping shots from outside the area."

Watzke has accused the Spanish giants of influencing the France international to force Borussia's hand. Barcelona want to sign Dembele and Liverpool's Philippe Coutinho to replace Neymar, who left for Paris Saint-Germain, but Dembele has a contract until 2021 with Dortmund. Reports claim the Germans want 130 million euros ($152m) for the player they paid Rennes 15m euros for last year. Dortmund have made it clear they will only sell Dembele if their price is met and Watzke is less than impressed with the role Barcelona are playing in the transfer saga. ""You have to talk about the role of the 'glorious' club Barcelona,"" Watzke told Sky. ""We met with their representatives, which commanded the respect, which I still had back then a few weeks ago, of such a big and serious club. ""In doing so, we found out that our ideas (over the price) are very far apart and therefore such a big gap could not be crossed. ""Then completely out of the blue, he didn't come to training. ""Do you honestly believe that a 20-year-old, without the benvolence of a new club, says 'I'm not coming to training'. ""Ousmane wouldn't have done that for any other club in the world -- we know that now."" Watzke says the chance of Dembele leaving is less than '50 percent' and if he stays, the winger will have to apologise to the Dortmund squad, some of whom have been highly critical of the Frenchman. Dembele has already packed up his house in Dortmund and moved back to France. ""Ousmane isn't dancing around us, he is simply refusing to work,"" said the 58-year-old Watzke. ""That is obviously something new, he has gone on strike and has been suspended. ""There are now two possibilities. ""Either Barcelona pay the sum we have imagined and, if they meet our demands promptly, the transfer will go ahead. ""We will not negotiate. ""And if they don't pay, then he will be back as of September 1st and I am sure he will really want to play then. ""However, if that happens, he will really have to apologise to the club and the team. ""The fact the team is distancing itself from his behaviour is normal. ""Ousmane is actually a nice bloke and what he is doing is, of course, not on, but I also did a lot of shit when I was 20 and if all that butter was smeared on bread today, it would make a fat sandwich.""

""Otherwise he will stay with us - it's as simple as that."" The 20-year-old Dembele attempted to force Dortmund into selling him to the Spanish giants by boycotting training last week, which led to him being indefinitely suspended, after Borussia rejected an initial bid. Barcelona are eager to sign Dembele and Liverpool's Philippe Coutinho to replace Neymar, who left for Paris Saint-Germain. Frenchman Dembele has a contract until 2021 with the German club. Reports claim Dortmund want 130 million euros ($152m) for the player they paid Rennes 15m euros for last year, after rejecting an initial offer of 80 million, plus a 40m bonus. Should Barcelona fail to meet the asking price, Dembele will have some bridges to build at Dortmund. ""Of course there is a way back and that will be on September 1 when a transfer is no longer possible,"" said Zorc. ""The decision will not be met on transfer deadline day, it will be before that. ""The situation is very challenging, we haven't said it was easy."" Zorc confirmed reports Dembele has left Dortmund. ""We know where he is, he's in France.

Liverpool have publicly stated that Coutinho is not for sale at any price and consider the figures being offered by Barcelona irrelevant. The 25-year-old Brazil playmaker, currently sidelined by a back problem, has submitted a transfer request. He signed a new five-year contract in January. Barcelona have targeted Coutinho and Borussia Dortmund winger Ousmane Dembele to plug the gap created by Neymar's world-record 222 million euro ($260.8 million) move to Paris Saint-Germain. Speaking on Thursday, Barca general manager Pep Segura said deals for the pair were ""close"". But Liverpool are refusing to budge and Dembele, 20, has been suspended by Dortmund after going on strike in a bid to force through a move. Coutinho joined Liverpool from Inter Milan in an £8.5 million move in January 2013 and is the key creative figure in Jurgen Klopp's team, scoring 14 goals in all competitions last season."

Dortmund have rejected claims by Barcelona's general manager Pep Segura that they are ""close"" to signing Dembele, with Spanish media reporting an offer of 80 million euros ($94m), plus 40 million euros in bonuses. With Dembele missing, Dortmund will play their first game of the 2017/18 Bundesliga season on Saturday at Wolfsburg and new coach Peter Bosz admits it is hard to ""blend-out"" the ongoing transfer saga. Should Dembele eventually return to training, ""you can assume we would tell him in no uncertain terms that his behaviour is not on and is damaging to the team"", Dortmund midfielder Gonzalo Castro told Bild. The German daily also report that Dembele has packed up and quit his rented house -- owned by current Liverpool and ex-Dortmund coach Jurgen Klopp -- having already returned to France. Castro is the latest Dortmund star to criticise Dembele after defender Sokratis Papastathopoulos said the Frenchman ""can't just do what he wants"". Ex-Dortmund player and coach Matthias Sammer said Dembele's behaviour threatens the fabric of the club. ""I am concerned about what is happening at Dortmund,"" Sammer told daily die Welt. ""The great strength of the club -- the family, the feeling of belonging together, the charisma -- is in danger. ""I can't understand anyone who doesn't come to training. This case is a new dimension."" However, Castro says he has some sympathy for Dembele. ""One must not forget, he is only 20 years old and we don't know who is behind his behaviour or who is advising him,"" said the 30-year-old Castro, a German international. ""I know from my own experience that I could not decide everything for myself at the age of 20. ""But it's also clear that there are employment contracts and the club must come first."""

Sporting director Robert Fernandez was less emphatic when asked about the deals later, although he was optimistic that both will soon be Barcelona players. ""Dembele and Coutinho are two important players that we like a lot and have done for a long time,"" said Fernandez at the unveiling of Brazil midfielder Paulinho, a 40 million-euro ($47 million, £36.4 million) signing from Chinese club Guangzhou Evergrande. ""They have the conditions, the age and could adapt to our football. They would be good to have here. That's the reality."" Under pressure to spend big after pocketing a world record 222 million euros from Paris Saint-Germain for Neymar, Barcelona have already had a £90 million bid for 25-year-old Brazilian attacking midfielder Coutinho rejected by Liverpool. Spanish media have also reported that Barcelona are prepared to pay an initial 80 million euros, plus 40 million in bonuses, to Borussia Dortmund for 20-year-old French winger Dembele. Fernandez added: ""With respect to Liverpool and Dortmund, when there are negotiations you need time, you need to work things into a favourable situation for players and ourselves. ""We still have days ahead of us, would like to move things faster, but (I) do admit they're two players we would like here. But it's the clubs who will have the final say on if we finally achieve those two transfers."" Liverpool and Dortmund have both been adamant that their respective players are not for sale, with the Premier League club's manager Jurgen Klopp insisting that no discussions are ongoing with Barcelona. ""No news from me because no-one told me anything different since we spoke last time about this,"" said Klopp on Thursday. Coutinho, currently sidelined with a back injury, last week handed in a transfer request that was turned down by Liverpool's American owners. There have been suggestions Coutinho could agitate for a move by effectively going on strike, but while he is still injured that is impossible. Klopp conceded it is a tricky situation for all parties, but was keen not to be seen criticising the Brazilian's attitude. ""To be honest I have nothing to say about his attitude because since he has had a back problem he has obviously not been in training,"" he said. In contrast to Coutinho, Dembele has been suspended indefinitely by Dortmund after skipping training in a personal protest to pressure the German club to sell him. He will not play in his current side's opening Bundesliga game against Wolfsburg this weekend but Dortmund CEO Hans-Joachim Watzke on Thursday rubbished the claims made by Segura. ""Barcelona have not managed to fulfil their wish to complete Dembele's transfer -- until now, they aren't one millimetre closer,"" Watzke told German magazine Kicker. Dembele, 20, was signed from Rennes just last year and has a contract until 2021. Barcelona are eager to complete the signings with their opening game of the season in La Liga coming at home to Betis on Sunday. The 2-0 defeat to Madrid on Wednesday saw them lose the Spanish Super Cup 5-1 on aggregate and also saw them lose Luis Suarez to injury. The Uruguayan striker suffered a knee injury in the game that means he will be out for around a month, ruling him out of Barca's first three league games and their first Champions League group match."

Watzke's comments referred to Segura's claim on Wednesday that Barcelona are ""close"" to completing a deal for Dembele as well as Liverpool's Philippe Coutinho. Dembele, 20, has a contract until 2021 and was suspended indefinitely by Dortmund last week for skipping training in a personal protest to pressure the German club to sell him to Barcelona. The Frenchman is suspended for Dortmund's opening Bundesliga match against Wolfsburg on Saturday, which is an unwelcome distraction for new Borussia coach Peter Bosz. ""It is not possible to completely blend it out, but I try to focus on the players who are here, which he isn't,"" said Bosz when asked about Dembele. ""I don't know what will happen, we have to be patient for a few more days."" Spanish giants Barcelona want to sign both Dembele and Coutinho as attacking reinforcements after losing Neymar to Paris Saint-Germain. According to Spanish media, Barcelona are offering 80 million euros ($93.5 million, £72.7 million), plus a bonus of 40 million euros, but Dortmund want 150 million euros for Dembele -- 10 times what they paid Rennes in 2016. Dembele's decision to strike has irked his team-mates. He missed Saturday's 4-0 win at minnows Rielasingen-Arlen in the first round of the German Cup when Gabon hot-shot Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang scored a hat-trick. Dortmund's tough-tackling defender Sokratis Papastathopoulos says Dembele should follow the example of Aubameyang, who has been linked to a big-money move to China but has been told that he is staying. ""Ousmane is a good lad, but he has to recognise that no player is bigger than the team,"" Sokratis told Thursday's edition of magazine Kicker. ""Everyone has to be clear that he must work for the team and fall in line. This also applies to Ousmane -- he can't just do whatever he wants."" ""Ousmane has done no good by going on strike. He should not forget that he still has a long-term contract at Dortmund,"" he added. Sokratis says he hopes Dembele will return to training soon. He remains suspended as Dortmund prepare for their opening game of the new Bundesliga season at Wolfsburg on Saturday. ""At first he has to get in touch with us again and come to training. Then we will see,"" said Sokratis. ""Ousmane has given a lot for us. He is a player who makes the difference and we need players like that. ""But we also need players who don't shut themselves out and who want to be part of our family. Apparently Ousmane doesn't want that."""
635,17/08/2017,16:10,New blow for Barcelona as Suarez ruled out for a month,Troubled Barcelona were dealt a new blow ahead of the start of the Spanish league season when Luis Suarez was ruled out for a month with a knee injury on Thursday.,"The Uruguayan striker suffered the injury in the second half of Wednesday night's 2-0 defeat away to Real Madrid in the second leg of the Spanish Super Cup, although he played on to the end as Barcelona lost 5-1 on aggregate. ""Luis Suarez will be out of action for around four weeks. Tests carried out on Thursday morning confirm that the Uruguayan has a distension in the posterior articular capsule in his right knee picked up in the second half of the Clasico on Wednesday in the Santiago Bernabeu,"" said Barcelona in a statement in English published on their website. The news means Suarez will miss Barcelona's first three games of the season in La Liga, at home to Betis on Sunday, away to Alaves on August 26 and at home to Espanyol on September 9. He will also miss Uruguay's World Cup qualifying ties against Argentina on August 31 and Paraguay on September 5 and is likely to sit out his club's first Champions League group game on September 12 or 13. Barcelona also revealed that defender Gerard Pique is a doubt for the meeting with Betis due to a groin strain, meaning further bad news for the Spanish giants whose summer has been overshadowed by the sale of Neymar to Paris Saint-Germain."
636,15/08/2017,20:15,Ronaldo ban sours Madrid's march towards more silverware,"Cristiano Ronaldo is banned, but it would take a huge upset for Real Madrid's trophy-winning streak to be ended by Barcelona on Wednesday (kick off 2100GMT) as they carry a 3-1 lead into the second leg of the Spanish Super Cup.","Ronaldo's five-match ban for pushing the referee after being controversially sent-off for diving in the first leg threatens to overshadow another glorious night for Real as they close in on a seventh trophy in less than two years under the tutelage of Zinedine Zidane. Madrid fans are planning a protest in the seventh minute against the treatment of the World Player of the Year, whilst Zidane was uncharacteristically angered by the ban. ""When you look at everything that happened, to think Cristiano won't play five games with us... it is infuriating."" Ronaldo came off the bench to give Madrid a 2-1 lead at the Camp Nou on Sunday with a sensational strike into the top corner. However, he was then booked for taking his shirt off in celebration and saw a second yellow card just two minutes later when he went down under pressure from Samuel Umtiti inside the area. The Portuguese captain then pushed referee Ricardo de Burgos Bengoetxea before leaving the field - an offence that carries a minimum four-game suspension. Madrid's appeal against his second yellow will be heard on Wednesday morning, but even if it is successful the ban will likely only be reduced from five to four games. Real, though, showed they can cope admirably without their all-time top scorer as even a man down for the final stages at the Camp Nou, they went onto extend their through Marco Asensio's sumptuous strike. Shorn of Ronaldo, Zidane is expected to make just one change from the side that started at the weekend with Luka Modric returning from suspension in place of Mateo Kovacic. And Zidane warned against complacency as Barca have won on three of their last four visits to the Bernabeu. ""In football nothing is over. We have to play really well because at any moment Barcelona can cause you problems,"" added the Frenchman. Defeat in Ernesto Valverde's first game in charge compounded a miserable start to the season for Barcelona after losing Neymar to Paris Saint-Germain. ""We have an adverse result going into the second leg, of that there is no doubt, but nothing is impossible,"" said Valverde. ""We maintain our idea of going there to win the game and bring back the title. Yes it is difficult, but we aren't going to give up beforehand."" Barca need to score at least three times to have any chance of turning the tie around, but can take hope from the fact they have scored 12 goals in their last four visits to the Bernabeu. ""Scoring three goals there won't be easy but we have done it many times,"" said midfielder Sergio Busquets. Still in search for a replacement for Neymar, Barca could be further weakened by the absence of captain Andres Iniesta who is doubtful after sitting out training on Tuesday. New signing Paulinho won't be involved as he doesn't arrive in Barcelona until Thursday."
637,15/08/2017,19:18,Barca lack firepower without Neymar - Busquets,"Barcelona midfielder Sergio Busquets reiterated his call for the club's board to strengthen in the transfer market on Tuesday, but warned replacing the departed Neymar will be almost impossible.","The Brazilian's absence was noticeable as Barca fell to a 3-1 Spanish Super Cup, first leg defeat at home to Real Madrid in the Catalans first game since Neymar moved to Paris Saint-Germain for a world record 222 million euro fee ($262 million). ""It is clear that with Neymar's departure the team has lost out offensively,"" said Busquets ahead of Wednesday's second leg at Madrid's Santiago Bernabeu (kick off 2100GMT). ""It's obvious that you realise what kind of player Ney is."" Busquets said in the immediate aftermath of Sunday's defeat that Barca had to sign after initial bids to land Liverpool's Philippe Coutinho and Ousmane Dembele of Borussia Dortmund were rejected last week. However, the Spanish international believes the only way to move on from Neymar's decision to jump ship to the French giants is for the Barca squad to be improved overall rather than finding a like-for-like replacement. ""Those that come in will be welcomed. With Neymar's departure there is a lack of attacking players, but as I said before getting better means improving in all positions and all aspects. ""Hopefully as many players of the highest quality can come in. ""There is only one Neymar and now that he is no longer with us we need to look forward and try to improve as a team."" Barca made Brazilian international midfielder Paulinho their first signing since Neymar's departure from Chinese club Guangzhou Evergrande for 40 million euros on Monday. And despite widespread scepticism over his ability to make an impact in Spain after a disappointing spell at Tottenham Hotspur before his move to China, Barca boss Ernesto Valverde insisted Paulinho will bring a different dimension to the Barca midfield. ""From a physical point of view he is a strong player that can offer us versatility,"" said Valverde. ""There isn't another player of his type in the team."""
638,04/08/2017,15:34,Annoyed Barca won't pay Neymar bonus,"Barcelona won't pay a 26 million euro ($30.8 million) bonus to Neymar for renewing his contract with the Catalan giants in 2016, a club spokesman said on Friday after his decision to join Paris Saint-Germain for a world record transfer fee.","Josep Vives admitted Barca had been left irritated by the Brazilian's decision to leave despite signing a new five-year deal last year as PSG paid his 222 million euro ($264 million) buyout clause to leave Barca powerless to prevent Neymar moving on. ""Any separation causes annoyance, especially when it is one not wished for by the club due to a unilateral decision on the part of the player,"" Vives told a press conference at the Camp Nou. ""The player hasn't fulfilled his contract with the club...given that breach the club will not pay this renewal bonus."" Barca had deposited the bonus with a notary to be paid on September 1 had Neymar remained at the club, but have already recovered the 26 million. During his presentation as a PSG player on Friday, Neymar said that ""at no point did I lack respect to the supporters or the club"" in deciding to bring to an end his four years in Catalonia. However, Vives insisted Barca are unhappy with the way in which his exit came about. ""There is annoyance at the decision, but also the way it came about."" Yet, Vives claimed Barca can bounce back from losing out on La Liga and the Champions League last season with the likes of Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez still among a star-studded squad. ""He is a great player, we have enjoyed him a lot, but the world doesn't end after Neymar,"" he added. ""It is not the first time that we have gone through a situation like this and the club has continued, grown and become more universal."" The move is not just a huge blow for Barca's prospects on the field, but their prestige as one of the world's richest and most successful clubs. It is 17 years since Barca last lost one of their prized assets against their will when Real Madrid paid Luis Figo's buyout clause for a then world record fee."
639,04/08/2017,13:15,What next for cash rich but Neymar-less Barcelona?,"Barcelona find themselves flush with 222 million euros ($263.5 million), but faced with replacing one of the world's best players after Neymar's move to Paris Saint-Germain smashed the world transfer record.","The Catalans' under pressure board don't have much time to react with the transfer window set to shut on August 31. However, they can still count on one of the most talented squads in the world led by the likes of Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez. Here, AFP Sports looks at what Barca must do to try and gain ground on bitter rivals and Spanish and European champions Real Madrid. Barca will suffer on the field for Neymar's absence, but seeing one of their prized assets snatched away to an inferior league is also a massive blow to Barca's prestige and a reminder of days they thought were long gone. The Catalans used to struggle to hold onto star names, particularly when Madrid's riches came calling. Luis Milla, Michael Laudrup and most famously Luis Figo crossed Spanish football's great divide. When Figo left in similar circumstances to Neymar as Madrid paid his buyout clause for a world record fee in 2000, it floored Barca on the pitch and in the boardroom. The money was wasted and they didn't win a major trophy for five seasons. Then came Messi and a host of world class home-grown talents to propel Barca to their most successful ever era, winning eight La Liga titles and four Champions Leagues titles in the past 12 years. In the 17 years since Figo left Barca have become a brand and one of the richest clubs in the world, plus they still have Messi. All of which should ensure the fallow period that followed Figo's departure isn't repeated. The biggest challenge for Barca president Josep Maria Bartomeu is now how much cash to splash in the next four weeks, especially after two years in which they have largely overpaid for little return in the transfer market on the likes of Andre Gomes, Paco Alcacer and Arda Turan. There will be pressure for the Catalans to reassert themselves by landing a marquee signing with Phillippe Coutinho, Ousmane Dembele, Paulo Dybala and Kylian Mbappe all linked. However, finding a like for like replacement for Neymar will be impossible --that is why he fetched a fee more than double the previous transfer record. With that in mind Barca may be better placed in the long run to save some money for future windows if they are not to end up poorer on the field and no better off financially from Neymar's move. Most worryingly for Barca's future is that Neymar has gone in his prime at 25, leaving behind an ageing squad. Messi and Suarez are both 30, as is defensive leader Gerard Pique, whilst captain Andres Iniesta is 34 and out of contract at the end of the season. One of the criticisms of Barca's evolution in recent seasons since Pep Guardiola's departure as coach in 2012 has been that graduates from the club's once famed La Masia academy have not been given a chance as the club turned to star signings such as Suarez and Neymar. ""Barcelona have been sleeping,"" Barca legend Xavi told the Tactical Room last month. ""They have to strengthen the youth academy."" In need of fresh blood, Barca could do with the academy that produced Messi, Xavi and Iniesta coming good once more. In Neymar's departing words: ""I made a trio with Messi and Suarez that made history. Conquered everything an athlete can conquer."" For three years the 'MSN' formed a thrilling front line arguably unrivalled in football history. In 110 matches together, they scored a combined 228 goals. Yet, by building the team around three forwards, other parts of the team struggled, most notably midfield which had been their strength in the glorious Guardiola years. The 'MSN' is no more, but if Barca use the Neymar funds to reinforce their midfield to back up the firepower still provided by Messi and Suarez, they will remain a force to fear in La Liga and the Champions League."

He will then be presented to fans at the same ground at 1345GMT on Saturday before the season-opening Ligue 1 fixture against promoted Amiens. PSG wasted no time in pressing Neymar's commercial value by announcing that shirts bearing his name will be on sale from 10h00 am (0800 GMT) Friday at the club's megastore on the city's iconic Champs Elysees.

""We can confirm that the legal representatives of the player attended La Liga to pay the clause and this has been rejected,"" a La Liga spokesperson told AFP. Neymar had been expected to complete his move to the French giants by the weekend after Barcelona announced the 25-year-old striker's decision to leave on Wednesday on the condition his buyout clause was met. La Liga president Javier Tebas has been an outspoken critic of PSG's move to snatch one of the Spanish league's biggest stars. Tebas believes the astronomical sums being spent by the French giants, including a reported 30 million euro salary after tax for Neymar, makes it impossible for them to comply with financial fair play regulations (FFP). ""La Liga is an entity that defends the interests of the clubs and right now it is defending Barcelona,"" said Marcos Galera, a lawyer and founding member of Spanish sports law specialists Agaz. ""But if you follow literally Spanish legislation, they had an indemnity clause agreed....and the rules are that if you have a clause agreed, you have to abide by it."" One option open to PSG and Neymar is for the money to be deposited with a notary and to seek an international transfer certificate through FIFA.

Among that party was Wagner Ribeiro, an advisor to the player, who claimed PSG would pay his 222 million euro ($260 million) buyout clause in the ""coming hours"". That would more than double the current transfer record set by Paul Pogba's £89.3 million ($111 million, 105.2 million euros) move to Manchester United last year. Media reports suggested that Neymar had gone to Porto, where PSG sporting director Antero Henrique had worked until recently, to undergo a pre-transfer medical. Sources told AFP that he will arrive in Paris on Thursday afternoon. Earlier, Barcelona ended weeks of speculation by publicly confirming for the first time the 25-year-old's wish to leave after four years at the Camp Nou. ""Neymar Jr, accompanied by his father and representative, communicated to FC Barcelona this morning his decision to leave the club,"" Barca said in a statement. ""The club have informed them that the buyout clause in his contract, that from July 1 is 222 million euros, must be paid in full."" Neymar has been tempted to Paris by an astronomical offer that would reportedly see his wages tripled to 30 million euros a year after tax. However, on the field he also faces the challenge of stepping out of the shadow of five-time World Player of the Year Lionel Messi to try and prove himself as the world's best. ""It was a huge pleasure having shared all those years with you, my friend @neymarjr,"" Messi posted on Instagram alongside a montage displaying some of the pair's finest moments together. ""I wish you lots of luck in this new stage in your life. See you soon tkm,"" he added. ""Tkm"" stands for ""te quiero mucho"" (I love you loads). ""Thanks brother. I will miss you man,"" Neymar replied. Presuming both clubs don't come to a late agreement, the buyout clause would have to be paid to Barcelona via Spain's La Liga to free the player from the contract he signed last year and runs until 2021. However, La Liga president Javier Tebas has threatened not to accept PSG's money over what he perceives as a failure on the French side's part to comply with UEFA's financial fair play rules (FFP). Clubs can be sanctioned by UEFA for making a loss of more than 30 million euros over a three-year period. ""We will not accept this money from a club like PSG,"" Tebas told Madrid sports daily AS on Wednesday. ""Especially when this club is infringing rules and laws."" Winning the Champions League for a first time is the dream driving PSG's owners Oryx Qatar Sports Investments (QSI) to fund a deal that could herald the start of a new era at the elite level of European football. Since QSI's takeover in 2011, PSG have failed to make it beyond the quarter-final stage - most notably blowing a 4-0 first leg lead to lose 6-1 to a Neymar-inspired Barcelona in the last 16 of last season's competition in March. Prising Neymar from the grip of Barca would truly announce PSG's presence as a contender for the likes of Barca, Real Madrid and Bayern Munich to fear. Neymar has formed one of the deadliest strike partnerships in football history with Messi and Luis Suarez over the past three seasons. Together they have won two La Liga titles, a Champions League and three Spanish Cups, whilst Neymar has scored 105 goals and provided 80 assists in just 186 games. However, his four-year spell in Spain has also been overshadowed by the murky transfer deal which brought him to Barcelona from Santos in 2013. He and his parents as well as Barca president Josep Maria Bartomeu face charges of fraud and corruption in an ongoing case brought by DIS, a Brazilian investment company. DIS owned 40 percent of the players' rights at the time of the deal and believe they were deliberately cheated out of their real share due to the complex structure of the transfer. dbh-lbx/pmr/lrb/kca/dj/jc <org>FFP</org> <org>MANCHESTER UNITED</org>"

""The club have informed them that the buyout clause in his contract that from July 1 is 222 million euros must be paid in full."" Such a fee would smash the current record £89.3 million ($111 million, 105.2 million euros) Manchester United paid for Paul Pogba last year. Neymar has also been given permission to not participate in training after making a brief appearance at Barca's training ground on Wednesday. Speculation over the 25-year-old's future has dominated the first few weeks of new Barca boss Ernesto Valverde's reign. Neymar arrived back in Barcelona on Tuesday from a fleeting promotional tour to China. He turned up for training at 9am local time (0700GMT) on Wednesday morning, but left less than an hour later after telling teammates ""he is leaving"", a Barca spokesperson confirmed. Presuming both clubs don't come to a late agreement, the buyout clause would have to be paid to Barcelona via Spain's La Liga to free the player from the contract he signed last year and runs until 2021. However, La Liga president Javier Tebas has threatened not to accept PSG's money over what he perceives as a failure on the French side's part to comply with UEFA's financial fair play rules (FFP). Clubs can be sanctioned by UEFA for making a loss of more than 30 million euros over a three-year period. ""We will not accept this money from a club like PSG,"" Tebas told Madrid sports daily AS on Wednesday. ""Especially when this club is infringing rules and laws."" Barcelona have also threatened to report PSG to UEFA over any potential breach of FFP. PSG have already been fined and saw their Champions League squad limited by UEFA for breaches of FFP in 2014. Winning the Champions League for a first time is the dream driving PSG's owners Oryx Qatar Sports Investments (QSI) to fund a deal that could herald the start of a new era at the elite level of European football. Since QSI's takeover in 2011, PSG have failed to make it beyond the quarter-final stage in recent seasons - most notably blowing a 4-0 first leg lead to lose 6-1 to a Neymar-inspired Barcelona in the last 16 of last season's competition in March. Prising Neymar from the grip of Barca would truly announce PSG's presence as a contender for the likes of Barca, Real Madrid and Bayern Munich to fear. Neymar has formed one of the deadliest strike partnerships in football history with five-time World Player of the Year Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez over the past three seasons. Together they have won two La Liga titles, a Champions League and three Spanish Cups, whilst Neymar has scored 105 goals and provided 80 assists in just 186 games. Yet, one justification for Neymar to jump ship on top of the reported offer to triple his salary to 30 million euros net a season, is a desire to move out of Messi's shadow if he is to end the Argentine and Cristiano Ronaldo's decade-long dominance to win the Ballon d'Or. Neymar's four-year spell in Spain has also been overshadowed by the murky transfer deal which brought him to Barcelona from Santos in 2013. He and his parents as well as Barca president Josep Maria Bartomeu face charges of fraud and corruption in an ongoing case brought by DIS, a Brazilian investment company. DIS owned 40 percent of the players' rights at the time of the deal and believe they were deliberately cheated out of their real share due to the complex structure of the transfer. Neymar was reported by Spanish media to be heading next to London to study the PSG contract with his father and his agent."

""The coach has given him permission to not train and to manage resolving his future."" Speculation over the 25-year-old's future has dominated the first few weeks of new Barca boss Ernesto Valverde's reign with PSG reportedly willing to pay Neymar's 222 million euro ($260 million) buyout clause. Such a fee would smash the current record £89.3 million ($111 million, 105.2 million euros) Manchester United paid for Paul Pogba last year. Neymar arrived back in Barcelona on Tuesday from a fleeting promotional tour to China after playing in all three of Barca's glamour pre-season fixtures in the United States against Juventus, Manchester United and Real Madrid. He arrived for training at 9am local time (0700GMT), but left left less than an hour later. Presuming both clubs don't come to a late agreement, the buyout clause would have to be paid to Barcelona via Spain's La Liga to free the player from the contract he signed last year and runs until 2021.

649,01/08/2017,23:55,Neymar keeps silence on return to Barcelona,"Brazilian superstar Neymar landed back in Barcelona on Tuesday evening, avoiding making any comment on the ongoing speculation about a possible world record transfer to Paris Saint-Germain.","The 25-year-old Barcelona forward was travelling back from China and had earlier posted a video on social media apparently from Dubai airport, amid suggestions that he could have been bound for Paris. He has remained silent while rumours swirl that he will join the French club, who are reportedly ready to pay the 222 million-euro ($260 million) buyout clause in his contract at the Camp Nou. Neymar, who was in Shanghai on Monday fulfilling a sponsor's engagement, had also posted a photo on Instagram with the caption in Portuguese: ""Lunch at half-way"". In another video posted from an aeroplane, Neymar joked around with an image messaging app that superimposed a Spanish flag and a small plane on his tee-shirt -- suggesting he was indeed headed home to Barcelona. The decor in that video was identifiable as from an Emirates aeroplane. Earlier reports claimed that he was headed from China to Doha to meet PSG's Qatari owners and pass a medical before a world-record transfer. But his being on an Emirates plane ruled out Doha as a possible destination given the diplomatic crisis between Qatar and its Gulf neighbours. And Neymar finally landed in Barcelona just before 9:00pm local time (1900 GMT), taking a backdoor exit to avoid the dozens of journalists and a few supporters -- some wearing PSG shirts -- who had been awaiting his arrival. A video filmed by a passenger and broadcast on Catalan television channel TV3 shows Neymar in an area reserved for flight crew. He is wearing headphones and avoids responding to fans asking if he is staying with Barcelona. ""FCB (Barcelona) and Neymar's entourage confirm that the player returns to Barcelona today. He will train tomorrow and continue with life as normal until everything is sorted out,"" tweeted Marcelo Bechler, the Brazilian journalist who first broke news of an ""agreement"" between the player and PSG on July 18. Barcelona, who lost 3-2 to Real Madrid in Miami on Saturday, the last match of a US tour, are due to train at 9:30am on Wednesday. ""Neymar and the rest of the squad are due at training,"" a club source told AFP. Barcelona's next match is on Monday in the annual Joan Gamper trophy, in which they will host Chapecoense, the Brazilian club whose team was decimated in an air disaster last November. Ernesto Valverde's side play their first official match on August 13 against Madrid in the first leg of the Spanish Super Cup. Neymar, though, has a nasty surprise awaiting him upon his return as Barcelona have blocked payment of a 26 million-euro bonus he is due, a source at the club said. ""These 26 million euros have been placed with a notary pending to see if the player continues,"" the source, who refused to be named, told AFP. The renewal bonus was agreed on a year ago when Neymar extended his contract with Barcelona until 2021, and was due to be paid to the player after he completed a year. But the club has decided to put it on hold while waiting to see how his transfer situation evolves. The contract Neymar signed also increased an early termination clause from 200 to 222 million euros, a sum which PSG are reportedly willing to pay. Neymar first made his name at Santos, the former club of Brazil legend Pele, with whom he won the Copa Libertadores and Brazilian Cup. A big-money move to Barca followed in 2013 as 56,000 fans turned up for his official unveiling at the Camp Nou. In his four years with the Catalans he has won the Champions League in 2015, La Liga twice, the Spanish Cup three times and one FIFA Club World Cup. Last year he also helped Brazil on home soil win the Olympic title for the first time. bur-ybl-dbh/pmr/cyp/as/pvh"
650,01/08/2017,13:36,Barcelona block Neymar's multi-million bonus,"Barcelona have blocked payment of a 26-million-euro ($31-million) bonus for star attacker Neymar as speculation mounts that he will move to Paris Saint-Germain, a source at the club said Tuesday.","The Brazilian football star, who is due to come back for training on Wednesday morning, is at the centre of an apparent tug of war between the two European giants in what would be the most expensive transfer fee in football history. Speculation is mounting that the 25-year-old could quit Barcelona for PSG for a world-record 222 million euros. ""These 26 million euros have been placed with a notary pending to see if the player continues,"" the source, who refused to be named, told AFP. The renewal bonus was agreed on a year ago when Neymar extended his contract with Barcelona until 2021, and was due to be paid to the player after he completed a year. But the club has decided to put it on hold pending to see how the situation evolves. The contract Neymar signed also increased an early termination clause from 200 to 222 million euros, which PSG is reportedly willing to pay. Neymar's future is the talk of Spanish football, and particularly Barcelona supporters. After a successful pre-season tour in the United States that saw Barcelona win against Juventus, Manchester United and Real Madrid, the footballer flew to China for a promotion trip. But he studiously avoided commenting on the situation. On Wednesday, Barcelona players resume training after their summer break, with a double session in the morning and in the afternoon. Neymar has been called to the training, the club source said, although Spanish sports media doubt he will show up."
651,31/07/2017,16:18,Neymar gets China red-carpet treatment as speculation grows,Neymar hit the red carpet in Shanghai on Monday as speculation mounted that the Brazil star could be set to quit Barcelona for Paris Saint-Germain for a world-record 222 million euros.,"The 25-year-old striker is at the centre of an apparent tug of war between the two European giants in what would be the most expensive transfer fee in football history. A training spat with new Barcelona signing Nelson Semedo during a pre-season tour in Miami ramped up chatter that Neymar could be about to swap Spain for the French capital. Neymar, who has remained tight-lipped about the transfer rumours, posted a message for Chinese fans on Weibo, China's equivalent of Twitter, after arriving for a promotional visit. ""Ni Hao China! I'm Neymar Jr. and I've just arrived in China,"" he wrote. ""I'm in Shanghai at the moment. I would like to send a huge hug to all my Chinese fans, thank you very much for your support."" He later posed for a scrum of photographers and television journalists and answered questions about fashion, before attending an evening event for a clothing brand. Neymar also posted on Weibo a picture of himself with fellow Brazilian forward Hulk, who plays in the Chinese Super League for Shanghai SIPG. Even following the training-ground bust-up in the United States, after which Neymar appeared to storm off, his Barcelona team-mates said they wanted him to stay at the Camp Nou. ""Neymar and I, we are very close and I want him to stay and I know the situation,"" defender Gerard Pique told ESPN FC. ""Right now he doesn't know what to do and we are trying to help him -- the ones (on the team) that are more close to him -- to take the right decision."" PSG's pursuit of Neymar has angered some in Spain, where football league chief Javier Tebas says he will file a complaint with UEFA for financial fair play breaches by the French club."
652,30/07/2017,11:17,Alves urges 'friend' Neymar to show courage,Veteran Brazil international full-back Dani Alves said he is hopeful superstar Neymar will join him at Paris Saint Germain but insisted he isn't using his personal friendship to sway the Barcelona forward's decision.,"The two were team-mates at Barca from Neymar's arrival in 2013 until Alves left to join Juventus a year ago. Having joined PSG, 34-year-old Alves hopes Neymar will show courage and decide to swell the French capital club's large Brazilian contingent, that includes forward Lucas Moura, and centre-backs Thiago Silva and Marquinhos. Neymar, 25, is involved in a tug of war between the two European giants with his potential transfer to Paris the major saga of the off season. ""I hope it will happen. I've got nothing to do with his decision, it's a very important decision for him,"" said Alves, after scoring in PSG's French Super Cup victory over Monaco in Tangiers on Saturday. ""Men have to make these kind of decisions. I hope he'll join us, he's one of my best friends and I always want my friends to be close by. ""I can't interfere in his decision. It's his decision to make but we'll welcome him with open arms if he comes."" PSG are allegedly weighing up whether or not to trigger Neymar's 222-million-euro ($261 million) release clause, which would more than double the biggest transfer fee ever paid, currently the £89 million (105 million euros, $115 million) Manchester United forked out to bring back France midfielder Paul Pogba from Juventus. Pogba was then instrumental in convincing his friend Romelu Lukaku to join United from Everton for £75 million earlier this month. But Alves says he won't be trying to influence his compatriot. ""I helped him once, I helped him come to Barcelona. I didn't make the decision for him, but I simply told him what there was at Barca, and he decided to go there,"" said Alves. ""Decisions are for the courageous. I'm the most courageous: I decided to quit Barca, to quit Juve; I always make my decisions. ""He has to decide for his maturity and his ideas about continuing to improve."""
653,30/07/2017,05:41,Pique lifts Barcelona as El Clasico lives up to hype,Gerard Pique delivered Barcelona's match winner over Real Madrid on Saturday as El Clasico Miami lived up to the hype.,"The Spanish international steered in a Neymar free-kick in the 50th minute to seal a 3-2 win for the Catalan giants in front of 66,014 at the Hard Rock Stadium. Lionel Messi, who put in a superb 64-minute performance, opened the scoring after just three minutes and when Ivan Rakitic doubled the lead soon after, the writing appeared to be on the wall for a sluggish Real Madrid side. Yet Zinedine Zidane's side quickly woke from their slumber and by the end of the first half, goals from Mateo Kovacic and Marco Asensio had pulled them level. What followed was entertaining, often breathless friendly fare before Pique struck that decisive goal. This was nothing more than a pre-season match and obviously wasn't going to affect the overall record between these two old rivals, which stands at 93 wins for Real, 91 for Barcelona -- who had won their most recent meeting with Messi's last-gasp winner -- his 500th for the club. Madrid had the last laugh in May, winning La Liga and the Champions League, but actually arrived in Miami off the back of two exhibition defeats - a penalty shoot-out defeat to Manchester United before Manchester City also did a number on them in Los Angeles, running out 4-1 winners. Barca, meanwhile, had beaten United and Juventus in International Champions Cup friendly competition, but the ongoing uncertainty surrounding Neymar -- and Paris Saint-Germain's reported readiness to make a 218 million-euro move for him -- has cast a serious cloud over their two-week stay in North America. The Brazilian started for Ernesto Valverde's side and while the rest of his team-mates head home he will fly to China to perform commercial obligations on behalf of the club. Valverde put off post-match questions about Neymar. ""I always try to talk about things that happen rather than things that might happen,"" he said. ""We are going to wait. From my perspective, we have Neymar in our team, we count on him and we have to see."" On Saturday it was Neymar starting alongside Messi and Luis Suarez while Gareth Bale, Luka Modric and Karim Benzema were all unleashed by Madrid manager Zinedine Zidane. Neymar's first involvement was to fall to the ground and clutch his ankle. For a moment it looked like his evening would be over before it began, though he was back on the pitch in time to see Messi open the scoring with just three minutes on the clock. The Argentine ace waltzed into the box and lifted a shot past Keylor Navas via a deflection off Raphael Varane. And it wasn't long before Navas was picking the ball out of the back of the net once again. On six minutes, Neymar, gradually moving more freely, squared the ball and it found Rakitic, whose finish was clinically struck in the seventh minute. Real had barely escaped their own half and were lucky not to fall further behind on 13 minutes when Suarez fired over from close range. Yet with Madrid's first effort on goal, Zidane's side pulled one back. Croatian Kovacic evaded a challenge just outside the box before arrowing the ball past the outstretched hand of Jasper Cillessen. Suddenly, the game was on. Benzema, who'd barely had a sniff, dragged just wide on 19 minutes with Cillessen beaten. Navas remained the busier keeper, however, and was on hand to repel Messi once again on 31 minutes. It was a key save because in the 36th Asensio levelled for Madrid. Los Blancos were counter-attacking dangerously and it was left to Modric who squared for the Spaniard who took full advantage of Jordi Alba missing the ball to rifle past a horribly exposed Cillessen. Although they came back from the early goals, Zidane was downbeat about his team's performance. But he said there was plenty of time to get things right before Madrid take on Manchester United in the UEFA Super Cup on August 8. ""Today was a game of two faces for us, one bad, one better,"" he said. ""Ultimately we are preparing for the eighth -- we will be ready."" Both teams retained their star men after the restart and it was Neymar whose pinpoint free-kick was steered home by Pique in the 50th. ""We made a good start, generated some good opportunities,"" Valverde said. ""Overall, we did well trying to dominate the match. ""I expect the best from Messi and all the players but he is extraordinary and we are aiming to win all the titles this season."" While the clash of the Spanish rivals was supposedly a friendly, Rakitic was lucky to escape a red card just after the hour mark when he appeared to push referee Jair Marrufo. Neymar departed on 72 minutes in what could have been his final performance in Barcelona colors. ""I don't want to speculate about Neymar,"" Valverde said. ""I see him in the same place I have seen him recently: on the pitch with us."""
654,29/07/2017,13:08,Training spat has Barca pals asking Neymar to stay,Barcelona star teammates said Friday they have begged Neymar to resist the temptation of moving to Paris St Germain after a training ground altercation with new signing Nelson Semedo.,"The French giants are supposedly ready to launch a record-breaking $256 million (218 million euros) move for Neymar, sparking exit fears as the Spanish club prepared for a Saturday ""El Clasico"" friendly matchup with Real Madrid at Miami. The unsettled 25 year-old Brazilian stormed off the practice pitch in disgust and has yet to commit his future to Barcelona ahead of the transfer deadline, still more than a month away. ""It's true, something did happen, but that's sometimes what happens in training,"" Barca midfielder Andres Iniesta said. ""All the talk about Neymar right now, everything is magnified. Things like this can happen. It's a personal decision for him, but of course we want him to stay."" Strike partner Luis Suarez has formed a deadly partnership with Neymar and echoed Iniesta's calls for the interest from PSG to be dismissed once and for all. ""As soon as he clarifies the situation it's better for us and him. He will have his say when he is ready and as a teammate I will support him,"" Suarez said. ""Our relationship won't change. We want him to stay."" Boss Ernesto Valverde swerved the media on the eve of the match with arch-rival Real, but Iniesta sang Neymar's praises. ""For me, he's one of the best players in the world. He brings so much to the team and hopefully he will stay for many years,"" Iniesta said. ""He is worth more than $200 million or $300 million. His playing style suits us and he can only improve with us."" Neymar made an appearance at a Nike shop in Miami on Friday afternoon to celebrate the release of his new boots. But the superstar striker refused to talk about the speculation and just posed for photographs with fans a day after the training spat at Miami's Barry University training complex. Barca are set to return to Spain after the clash at the home stadium of the NFL's Miami Dolphins, but Neymar is still lined up to travel to China on business for the La Liga giants."
655,28/07/2017,15:26,Neymar event off amid transfer talk: China organisers,"A promotional event in China featuring Neymar was cancelled because he and his advisers are ""busy with transfer issues"", organisers said, amid frenzied speculation about a record-breaking move. The Brazilian star forward, who is reportedly mulling a massive 222-million-euro ($260 million) move to Paris Saint-Germain from Barcelona, was due to meet fans at a luxury Shanghai hotel on Monday.","China's biggest online travel company Ctrip said on its official microblog Weibo account that the meet-and-greet was off. ""Neymar and (his) team are busy with transfer issues so he cannot guarantee he will be at the scheduled event on July 31 in Shanghai,"" Ctrip said. The player, currently in the US with Barca on a pre-season tour, has remained tight-lipped about a possible transfer."
656,27/07/2017,04:33,Neymar scores as Barcelona beat Man Utd 1-0,"Neymar, serene amid a frenzy of transfer speculation, scored the first-half goal that gave Barcelona a 1-0 victory over Manchester United on Wednesday in an International Champions Cup friendly.","The Brazilian striker, reportedly pondering a 222-million euro ($256.8 million) move to Paris Saint-Germain, showed why the French club would be willing to pay a world-record price to get him. He delivered his third goal in two matches in the exhibition tournament as Barcelona handed the English Premiership club their first defeat of the pre-season. After a bright start Manchester United struggled to contain Barcelona's star duo of Neymar and Lionel Messi. Neymar broke through in the 31st, stripping the ball from Antonio Valencia in the penalty area, turning and finding the net. The goal proved enough to give a second straight victory to new Barcelona coach Ernesto Valverde. Valverde made sweeping changes to the team that beat Juventus 2-1. Luis Suarez, Jordi Alba, Samuel Umtiti, Nelson Semedo, Sergio Busquets and 19-year-old midfielder Carles Arena were included in the lineup headed by Messi and Neymar. There were eight changes to the Manchester United team that defeated Real Madrid on penalties on Sunday, with captain Michael Carrick, Marcus Rashford and Jesse Lingard the only players to retain their starting spots. It was Manchester United who threatened first, when Rashford's cross found Romelu Lukaku in the area, but the Belgian couldn't find the net. Barcelona inexorably took control, and United goalkeeper David de Gea was given plenty of work by Neymar, Messi and Suarez. Messi came close in the 12th minute, his low effort sliding wide. A long-range effort from Lukaku, a fierce blast from Paul Pogba and a curling effort from Rashford all tested Barcelona keeper Jasper Cillessen in the space of minutes. But from there Barcelona dominated. De Gea denied Neymar from close range in the 28th, but had no answer for the Brazilian three minutes later. Valencia had got control of a pass from Messi, but Neymar was there to regain the ball, turning in close quarters and firing past de Gea to the delight of the Barcelona fans among the 82,000-strong crowd at FedExField -- home of the NFL's Washington Redskins. Three minutes before the break de Gea parried Suarez's scissor-kick to keep it 1-0 to Barcelona at halftime. Both coaches rang the changes at halftime, with Valverde replacing 10 players -- only leaving Cillessen in goal. Jose Mourinho made five changes in his Manchester United side, and the second half moved at a slower, less fluent pace. Anthony Martial, Andreas Pereira and Pogba all threatened, but Manchester United were unable to find an equalizer. The match was the last of Manchester United's US tour -- which included wins over Real Madrid, Manchester City and Major League Soccer's Real Salt Lake and Los Angeles Galaxy. They are due to take on Valerenga in Oslo on Sunday and then Sampdoria in Ireland before facing Real Madrid in the UEFA Super Cup on August 8. Barcelona, meanwhile will take on Spanish rivals Real Madrid in a pre-season ""Clasico"" in Miami on Saturday -- apparently still uncertain just how long they will have Neymar to rely on."

PSG are trying to lure the 25-year-old Brazilian to France and are ready to pay off his 222 million euro ($256.8 million) release clause and make the player the best-paid footballer on the planet. Last week Pique took to social media to say ""he's staying"" - but when pressed on the matter Tuesday ahead of a pre-season friendly in the United States against Manchester United he was less sure of himself. ""It's a personal opinion from the conversation that I had with him and my intuition,"" Pique said. ""But it's not official,"" he added. ""And it's not for me to say if he's going to stay or not."" The position sent a shudder down the spine at Barcelona. ""Pique retracts and feeds the uncertainty,"" the newspaper Sport said. ""The situation is eroding confidence at the club,"" columnist Tomas Andreu wrote in Sport. ""What really hurts here is the silence of the player himself, which in the end says a great deal."" Neymar departed the stadium without addressing reporters after starring in a 2-1 win over Juventus on Saturday. ""They (the club) did not expect the negotiations with PSG and the player to go this far,"" he said. At the same press conference, the Argentine defender Javier Mascherano said he had told Neymar to carefully weigh up the pros and cons. Mascherano added all the players, including Lionel Messi, had spoken the player to ask him to stay."

Neymar had kept the guessing game about his future bubbling away after posting a picture of himself looking pensive on Instagram on Friday. But there was little to suggest that the charismatic striker is overwhelmed by the transfer saga as he produced a bewitching performance in front of a sell-out 82,104 crowd at the MetLife Stadium in New Jersey. The Brazilian broke clear after only four minutes but saw a tame shot from near the edge of the area drift away from the goal. Barcelona, with Lionel Messi starting, looked by far the more threatening of the two teams with Aleix Vidal and Messi both drawing early blocks from the Juventus defence. At the other end Mario Mandzukic might have given Juve the lead on 14 minutes but his header from a Stefano Sturaro cross went wide. The Italians were made to rue Mandzukic's profligacy a minute later when Neymar fired the Catalans into the lead, playing a clever one-two with Paco Alcacer and drilling his finish past Gianluigi Buffon. Nine minutes later and Neymar grabbed his second, picking his way through a static Juventus defence before burying a low shot beyond Buffon once more. Neymar might have had a hat-trick three minutes from half-time, when Messi floated a delightful pass in behind the Juve defence for the Brazilian. Buffon on this occasion was equal to the challenge however and blocked safely. Barcelona rang the changes at half-time, withdrawing all but two of their starting line-up, Neymar exiting for Sergi Roberto and Arda Turan replacing Messi. Juventus also made a raft of substitutions which led to the introduction of Paulo Dybala, Gonzalo Higuain and Douglas Costa amongst others. The changes immediately gave Juve a sharper attacking edge and Dybala was quick to test Adria Ortola with a rasping shot on 62 minutes that was turned around for a corner. From the ensuing setpiece, Giorgio Chiellini nodded home Dybala's cross to make it 2-1. However it was Barcelona who finished the stronger of the two sides, with Luis Suarez repeatedly threatening to extend the Spanish side's lead."

Pensive Neymar stirs renewed PSG fever,Neymar's decision to post a photo of himself in thoughtful contemplation sparked a fresh wave of speculation that he is on the verge of sealing a world record 222-million-euro ($256.8 million) move from Barcelona to Paris Saint-Germain.,"The Instagram picture, even accompanied by a matching emoji, shows the 25-year-old Brazilian superstar stretched out on the pitch with his chin resting on his left hand. It garnered more than 1.5 million 'likes' within 12 hours of it being posted in the United States where Barcelona are on a pre-season tour. Three of the 'likes' came from PSG players -- winger Angel Di Maria, goalkeeper Kevin Trapp and midfielder Marco Verratti. French newspaper Le Parisien fuelled speculation Friday with an unsourced report that Neymar had told several Barcelona teammates of his intentions to join PSG, adding that the transfer is considered a done deal by some Barcelona players. That echoes media company Esporte Interativo's insistence that an agreement has been reached for Neymar to move to the French capital from Barcelona, where he has played since 2013. On Tuesday, PSG skipper -- and fellow Brazilian -- Thiago Silva gave a digital thumbs up to a mocked-up photo montage published by Esporte Interativo showing Neymar in a PSG shirt along with compatriots and prospective teammates in France. Barcelona coach Ernesto Valverde described the ongoing saga as a ""time of rumours"". ""We understand it's how it is. He is with us right now, one of us,"" said Valverde in East Rutherford where his team plays Juventus in a pre-season friendly on Saturday. That match will give Neymar a chance to display his coveted skills for the first time this summer. ""He's a player we love and we want,"" Valverde said. ""Not only football wise, but also for the things he brings to the locker room. ""There's no need to worry about something we don't know if it's going to happen or not. If it happens in the future, we'll see."" PSG skipper Thiago Silva told Le Parisien he had no idea if the Brazilian star was about to switch to the French capital. ""I don't know. I hear a lot from journalists and a player like Neymar would be an interesting addition to the PSG project,"" said Thiago, speaking in Florida -- where the French club takes on Tottenham in a friendly on Saturday. ""But, for the moment, it is especially important to prepare for the new season. After and if Neymar arrives it would be a good thing for the squad."" Is Neymar going to sign? ""Not yet,"" smiled the captain. In Spain, it was reported by Catalan media group RAC 1 that ""certain players"" at Barcelona have already tried to convince Neymar not to accept the PSG offer which would dwarf the 105 million euros Manchester United paid Juventus for Paul Pogba. Javier Mascherano said Neymar was ""the future"" of Barcelona as the Argentine pleaded with the striker to stay put. ""In the case of Ney, obviously he is young, and I hope he's here with Barcelona for many more years,"" Mascherano told American sports network ESPN. ""He is a really important player for the club. Because of his age, he's the future of the club, and we hope we can keep on counting on him."" However, it's believed the Brazilian is being seduced by the immense wealth on offer to him from the Qatari owners of PSG and by the opportunity to have a team built around him. The daily Sport newspaper also claimed that Luis Suarez has also attempted to persuade Neymar not to split up the MSN frontline at Barcelona made up of Lionel Messi, Suarez and the Brazilian star. Catalunya Radio said that the deal is ""95 percent complete"". One of the keys would be the payment to Neymar's father and agent of a ""premium exceeding the 40 million"" paid when the player controversially moved to Spain from Santos. Other reports have claimed that Neymar senior has recently met with, or is about to meet, PSG sporting director Antero Henrique. However, Barcelona vice-president Jordi Mestre insisted Tuesday that it is ""200 percent"" certain that Neymar will stay at the club. In a public game of tit-for-tat pronouncements, PSG coach Unai Emery hailed the Brazilian. ""Neymar has advanced his game massively and today he is one of the five best in the world,"" said Emery. ""Our president is working hard to attract top players and our fans would be content to count on a new top player to go along with the talent we already have."""
661,21/07/2017,20:41,"Neymar 'the future of Barca', says Mascherano","Barcelona defender Javier Mascherano calls Brazilian star Neymar the future of the Spanish giants, telling ESPN on Friday that he hopes the 25-year-old striker stays with Barca for years to come.","Neymar's future at the Camp Nou is in question amid reports the Brazil international could be set for a world-record transfer to Paris Saint-Germain. ""In the case of Ney, obviously he is young, and I hope he's here with Barcelona for many more years,"" Mascherano said in a posting on the US-based sports network's website. ""He is a really important player for the club. Because of his age, he's the future of the club, and we hope we can keep on counting on him."" Reports suggest Neymar has already told Barca teammates he wants to move, but Mascherano says such talk has not affected the Brazilian, who has scored 105 goals in 186 matches for Barcelona and 52 goals in 77 caps for his country. ""He's accustomed to the pressure and people talking,"" Mascherano said. ""There's always going to be rumours and news around him."" Asked what advice he might have for Neymar after his own pondering of a move to Juventus a year ago, the Argentine said he sees Neymar happy in Spain. ""It's really difficult to give advice,"" Mascherano said. ""Firstly, I'm not anyone to be giving advice and secondly, I see him really happy here, really happy. ""(Barca) are a club that have made it possible for him to perform at his best. But after that, each person has to make their own decisions."" Mascherano has seen the swirl of transfer market talks grow in intensity in recent years and bring issues for players at the heart of such speculation. ""The transfer market has been transformed recently into something quite fun,"" he said. ""Everyone in recent years is waiting for August 31 to see what's going to happen. It's part of what football has become, the most popular sport in the world, a big business and we are immersed in this business. For that reason, there's so much speculation and noise. ""Each player is different. There are people it affects more, others less. The speculation and all the noise that surrounds a club or a player is always going to exist because football is huge."" Barcelona are preparing for the upcoming campaign with matches against Juventus on Saturday in New Jersey, Manchester United on Wednesday in suburban Washington and against Real Madrid in Miami."
662,18/07/2017,15:17,Barca '200%' certain Neymar will stay,Barcelona vice-president Jordi Mestre insisted Tuesday that Brazilian star Neymar will be staying in Spain despite rumours linking him with a move to Paris Saint-Germain.,"Asked during a press conference if he could confirm Neymar would remain at Barca ahead of the 2017-18 season, Mestre replied: ""200 percent"". Reports in Spain have suggested PSG are looking to lure the 25-year-old to the Parc des Princes after snapping up Neymar's international teammate Dani Alves on a free transfer. ""PSG want to finalise the signing of Neymar this summer"", wrote Catalan daily Sport, while the Madrid-based AS newspaper led with the headline ""Neymar flirts with PSG"". PSG are reportedly attempting to take advantage of Neymar's desire to step out of Lionel Messi's shadow, with the French club prepared to build a team around the Brazil forward. ""In the background of Neymar's annoyance there's always a concern, which has to do with his role in the team and his wish to become a leader,"" wrote Sport. ""But you have to be aware that there are no shortcuts to leadership and it is something that is earned slowly, naturally and progressively,"" it added. According to Marca, PSG would be willing to stump up the 222 million euros ($256.8 million) required to trigger Neymar's release clause and would offer him a five-year deal worth 30-plus million euros a season. However, a report in French sports daily L'Equipe on Tuesday quoted a PSG club source as saying: ""We're not going to repeat the Neymar show. There is a huge release clause and you have to be realistic."" PSG have previously been linked with Neymar only for the striker to pen a new five-year deal with Barca last October."
663,17/07/2017,22:25,Barca announce record $800m revenue,Barcelona announced Monday record income of 708 million euros ($812.8m) for 2016/2017 with an after-tax profit of 18m euros.,"The Spanish giants said the healthy revenue was up 13m on the forecast figure in their budget for the period. A statement following the approval of the accounts at a board meeting disclosed the club has reduced its debt by 24.5m euros to 247m euros. The salaries of Lionel Messi, Luis Suarez, Neymar and co account for 66% of Barcelona's expenditure, the statement added. Barça say that the financial results fit into the club's strategic plan for revenue to top 1 billion euros by 2021. The Catalan side are ranked the fourth most valuable sports team in the world after the NFL's Dallas Cowboys, Major League Baseball's New York Yankees and Manchester United by Forbes magazine. Last season Barcelona relinquished their Spanish title to Real Madrid and were knocked out of the Champions League at the quarter-final stage by Juventus who went on to lose to Barca's arch-rivals Real in the final in Cardiff."
664,13/07/2017,21:38,Barcelona agree deal for Benfica's Semedo,"Barcelona have agreed a deal to sign Benfica right-back Nelson Semedo on a five-year deal, the Spanish club announced on Thursday.","Barcelona said Semedo would undergo a medical on Friday after Spanish press reports said they had agreed to pay a transfer fee of 30 million euros (£26.4 million, $34.2 million). The deal for the 23-year-old Portuguese international could see Benfica receive a further five million euros in bonuses, several Spanish newspapers said on Thursday. The fee would make Semedo the second most expensive defender in Barcelona's history behind Dani Alves, who cost 36 million euros including bonuses when he joined from Sevilla in 2008. The move for Semedo follows the return of Spain winger Gerard Deulofeu to the Camp Nou from Everton on a two-year deal. The Catalans, who have appointed Ernesto Valverde as coach to succeed Luis Enrique, have also extended Lionel Messi's contract until 2021."
665,13/07/2017,11:12,Messi vows to do 'best' under Valverde,"Barcelona star Lionel Messi shied away from making major promises for the coming season Thursday, pledging only to do his ""best"" under new coach Ernesto Valverde.","Messi said he was not familiar with Valverde's style, but voiced cautious hope. ""Well, I say the exact same thing I say all the time,"" he said at the team's celebration of a new sponsorship deal with Japanese e-commerce giant Rakuten at its Tokyo headquarters. ""Whenever I start a new season, there is a very clear-cut goal, which is FC Barcelona would do its best,"" said the Argentina international who recently extended his contract with the Catalan giants. ""Personally, I am very happy and looking forward to starting a new season,"" he said. ""Everything will become new (under Valverde). We are hearing a lot about his very good reputation,"" he said, adding that he held ""hopes on the new beginning."" ""We would like to do our best."" Teammate Arda Turan was more enthusiastic about the coming season. ""It's important that we are going to win all the titles this year. We can do it,"" the Turkey international said. They were joined by Neymar and Gerard Pique for the media event with Rakuten founder and chief executive officer Hiroshi Mikitani. Rakuten's four-year sponsorship deal, worth 55 million euros ($63 million) a year, will last through June 2021, with the option of a one-year extension. The e-commerce firm replaced Qatar Airways, Barcelona's shirt sponsor since 2013. Rakuten signed the deal as it seeks to expand overseas. The company already owns J-League side Vissel Kobe and professional baseball team Rakuten Golden Eagles."

667,07/07/2017,12:54,Messi is world's best paid player: Barcelona president,"Barcelona's Argentinian striker Lionel Messi, who recently extended his contract with the Catalan club, is ""the best paid player in the world,"" club president Josep Maria Bartomeu said Friday.","Barcelona announced Wednesday that Messi had agreed to extend his contract until 2021, in a deal that will keep the five times winner of the Ballon D'Or at the club until he is 34. No financial terms were disclosed but Bartomeu told the Barcelona sports daily Mundo Deportivo: ""He is the best player in the world and he is paid like the best in the world and in the history of football. ""He is the best paid sports player, because no one brings as much to his club as Leo Messi."" Prior to his contract extension, Messi was the third highest paid sportsman in the world with an income of $80, million of which 53 million was in salary and bonuses, according the ranking published by Forbes magazine in June. His great rival, Real Madrid's Cristiano Ronaldo of Portugal, topped the ranking with $93 million, of which 58 million was in salary and bonuses, ahead of American basketball player LeBron James ($86,2 million of which 31,2 million in salary and bonuses)."
668,05/07/2017,14:56,Messi commits to Barcelona until 2021,Lionel Messi has agreed to stay at FC Barcelona until 2021 in a deal that all but commits the star striker to ending his top-flight career at the Spanish giants.,"The megastar who joined Barcelona as a teenager 17 years ago will remain at the club until he is 34 under the new deal, the Catalan club announced Wednesday, ending months of speculation about the future of the five-time Ballon d'Or winner. ""The deal will be signed in the coming weeks, when Messi returns to the team for pre-season training,"" the club said in a statement, as the 30-year-old enjoyed his honeymoon just days after he wed his childhood sweetheart in Argentina. Messi has hinted in the past that he would like to return in the future to Argentina to play for his very first club, CA Newell's Old Boys in his hometown of Rosario, where he wed last week. But he has also said that his priority is to win more honours with Barca, the club he has called his home since he was 13. Club president Josep Maria Bartomeu has made keeping Messi at Barca a personal crusade. ""We wanted to ensure that the best player in the history of football remains at the club,"" he said. ""He plays here and he should retire here."" No financial details of Messi's new contact were disclosed, but Spain's Marca sports daily reported on Tuesday that the deal included a 300-million-euro ($340-million) termination clause. Under his current contract, due to run out in June 2018, Messi earns around 20 million euros a year in salary, according to Spanish media -- and this didn't include millions of euros in revenues earned from ads and performance-linked bonuses. Messi joined FC Barcelona in 2000 when he was just 13 years old in the youth training centre. ""He made his first team debut at just 16 years of age in a friendly against FC Porto, before making his debut the following season against Espanyol at 17,"" the club said in a statement. ""Shortly after, he scored his first senior goal with a clever lob against Albacete at the Camp Nou."" The deal announcement is likely to reassure fans and members of FC Barcelona, which has had a disappointing season by the club's own high standards. The club was eliminated from the Champions League in the quarter finals by Juventus, and came second behind arch-rivals Real Madrid in La Liga, though Barca did win the Copa del Rey. Messi's contract extension consolidates the much-feared ""MSN"" striking trio which also includes Brazil's Neymar and Uruguay's Luis Suarez. Both have also renewed their contracts until 2021. With 507 goals scored in 583 official matches, Messi is the club's all-time leading scorer and the top scorer in La Ligua historyand. He is widely considered the world's best player along with Portugal captain Cristiano Ronaldo, his Real Madrid rival. ""He's the best player I've ever seen on the pitch,"" said Ernesto Valverde, Barcelona's new coach, of Messi. Now 30, Messi could have been tempted by other horizons -- having been courted by clubs like PSG and Manchester City -- particularly as he was found guilty last year of tax fraud in Spain. But he has lived in Catalonia since his early teens, and currently resides in Barcelona with his now-wife Antonella Roccuzzo, their son Thiago, four, and Mateo, one -- both of whom were born in Spain. And Messi himself said in May that his aim as a footballer was to ""try and win the most titles possible"" with FC Barcelona."

""In the following days, the terms will be agreed with both Everton and the player. Deulofeu's contract will run until 30 June 2019."" Media reports in Spain said Barca will pay 12 million euros (£10.5 million, $13.7 million) for the 23-year-old, who spent the second half of last season on loan at AC Milan. Deulofeu has been capped three times at full international level and is currently at the under-21 European Championship in Poland with Spain, who face Germany in Friday's final."
670,23/06/2017,11:08,Prosecutors not against replacing Messi jail term with fine,"Prosecutors in Barcelona say they are not against replacing football star Lionel Messi's 21-month jail sentence for tax fraud with a fine, a spokeswoman announced Friday.","They said they were willing to give the 29-year-old a fine of 400 euros ($450) a day for the duration of the sentence -- an option that the defence of the Argentina international has also proposed. That would amount to more than 250,000 euros, although the court has the final decision over whether to go ahead with this option. The daily fine would come on top of the 2.09-million-euro fine Messi was also given when he and his father Jorge Horacio Messi were found guilty of tax fraud in a trial last year and sentenced to 21 months in jail. Both appealed, but Spain's Supreme Court last month confirmed the jail term for the Barcelona striker, although it reduced Messi's father's sentence to 15 months. The pair used companies in Belize, Britain, Switzerland and Uruguay to avoid paying taxes on 4.16 million euros of Messi's income earned from his image rights from 2007-09. The income related to Messi's image rights that was hidden includes endorsement deals with Danone, Adidas, Pepsi-Cola, Procter &amp; Gamble and the Kuwait Food Company. Messi is not the only football star to run into problems with Spain's courts, with Real Madrid striker Cristiano Ronaldo the latest to have been summoned to appear before a judge investigating tax fraud. He is due to be questioned on July 31 on suspicion of evading 14.7 million euros in taxes."

""I must adapt myself, or rather readapt, in a certain way. My goal is always to deepen the style, to revisit it once again."" Valverde, 53, has some big shoes to fill, Enrique having won nine of 13 possible trophies in his time at the helm. ""I must absolutely adapt to the style of the gameplan employed by the team, which has had so much success,"" said the coach, who signed from Athletic Bilbao. ""To have a very collective gameplan, based on midfielders,"" he said, adding that he wanted to win ""all competitions that we can"" next season. ""What I've always liked is that Barca manages to achieve its ends through its gameplan, without speculating, by going forward."" Valverde did not say what exactly he wanted to improve. ""We'll see over time,"" he said. ""In football, you always have to keep going forward. If you don't, you go backwards. But it's a progressive issue and we'll see little by little. ""To say what can be improved is a dangerous thing and I can only tip my hat to what my predecessor Luis Enrique, who is a great coach, achieved here. ""I have my idea about what can be done, not better but in a different way."" Turning to his motivation in joining Barca, Valverde said: ""I said I wanted a tough challenge and it's one the toughest. ""When a team like FC Barcelona calls you, you don't have to think about it too much."" Valverde also dismissed any worries about managing a squad packed with some of the world's best-paid and recognised players. ""I expect to find a squad of young players who want to win and will give the best of themselves,"" he said. ""We idealise too much all this, millionaire players and all that. I don't know many players who were born millionaires."" Working with Argentina's Leo Messi would be a ""unique experience"", the coach added. ""He's the best player I've ever seen on a pitch. Sometimes you could say Leo Messi has reached the summit, but he surprises you even more the following day. ""I hope to enjoy seeing him play and do everything possible to help him. And I hope he'll continue to surprise us."""

The Catalans missed out on La Liga to Real Madrid last weekend and were dumped out of the Champions League at the quarter-final stage by Juventus. And Pique wants his boss to go out as a winner in the last ever competitive game at Atletico Madrid's Vicente Calderon stadium. ""He is one of the best coaches in the history of the club,"" said the defender. ""He deserves a great final. The best way to leave would be on a high with a trophy and tomorrow is a good opportunity. ""I want him to leave as a winner."" However, Enrique himself warned against the threat posed by Alaves as the Basques played a huge role in costing Barca the league with a shock 2-1 win at the Camp Nou back in September. ""I have the chance to end my cycle with Barca with another title, but we are facing without doubt the revelation of La Liga this season."" Indeed, on a night of goodbyes at the Calderon, Mauricio Pellegrino could also be taking charge of Alaves for the final time with plenty of clubs eyeing the Argentine's services. As well as taking Alaves to their first Copa del Rey final, Pellegrino's men finished ninth on their return to the Spanish top flight after a decade in the lower leagues. ""I am very thankful to these boys for the work they have put in,"" said Pellegrino. ""There is not one of our players that doesn't deserve to play the final."" Whilst Alaves have never reached Spanish football's showpiece occasion before, they did reach the UEFA Cup final back in 2001. Liverpool edged a thrilling final 5-4 back then and Alaves captain Manu Garcia urged the club's fans to revel in the atmosphere as they did 16 years ago in Dortmund. ""This is a historic event,"" he said. ""It is a final and we only want to be champions. ""I want to tell the fans to enjoy the day as much as possible. ""As a youngster I experienced Dortmund, I have a lot of memories of that day and I want the fans to go there with their shirts, flags and scarves and be proud of Alaves."" Alaves' quest to make history will be helped by the absence of the suspended Luis Suarez. Barca also have no natural right-back available with Sergi Roberto also suspended after both players were sent-off in the second leg of a tempestuous semi-final against Atletico Madrid. However, Pique expects Barca to have the resources to cope. ""We have to face up to that problem. There are players here with the ability to replace them,"" he added. ""We are Barca. Whoever plays has to perform."""

However, he revealed back in March that he would not seek to renew his contract as he needed a rest after being worn down by the unique pressures that come with being Barca boss. ""Who knows if one day I coud return to the club to coach Barca,"" said Enrique. ""It is my home, my club, it's where I've felt most comfortable as a player and a coach."" Enrique has though endured a tempestuous relationship with the media during his time in charge and joked his return could provoke ""heart attacks"" in the press pack. ""Maybe I'll come back here on July 10 and take you by surprise...that would cause a few heart attacks,"" he added. ""I am young, I'm easy to get on with, so why not in a few years."" Barca won't be at full strength for the showpiece occasion as Luis Suarez and Sergi Roberto are both suspended after being sent-off in a bad-tempered semi-final, second leg against Atletico Madrid. However, Gerard Pique called on his teammates to give one of Barca's best ever coaches the send-off he deserves. ""He is one of the best coaches in the history of the club,"" said Pique. ""He deserves a great final. The best way to leave would be on a high with a trophy and tomorrow is a good opportunity."" Enrique led Barca to only the club's second ever treble of La Liga, Champions League and Copa del Rey in his first season in charge and backed that up with a league and Cup double last year. However, despite reports of dressing room bust-ups in his final campaign, Pique insisted he is a loved figure within the squad. ""It is easy to say the titles we have won,"" he added when asked for his best memories of the past three seasons. ""But it is better to be left with his way of being because he has been capable of winning over the dressing room. ""They have been three magnificent years."""
675,26/05/2017,01:50,Cup final last chance to salvage Barca's season,"Only victory in Saturday's Copa del Rey final against Alaves will salvage some pride from Barcelona's season and give coach Luis Enrique a successful send-off, whilst the Basques dream of lifting the trophy for a first time.","On a night of goodbyes as Atletico Madrid's Vicente Calderon hosts its final competitive fixture, Enrique will take charge of Barca for the last time. A win would complete a clean sweep of the Copa del Rey in his three seasons in charge. However, in contrast to the previous two years when Cup success was the icing on a successful season having won the treble in 2015 and a league and Cup double last season, Barca this time head into the end-of-season showpiece without a major trophy. ""Although it can be called the lesser of all the trophies, for us another trophy is at stake,"" said Barca captain Andres Iniesta. ""It will allow us to end the season on a high."" Enrique faces a selection headache with both Luis Suarez and Sergi Roberto suspended after being sent-off in a tempestuous semi-final win over Atletico back in February. Paco Alcacer is expected to be handed a rare big game start in Suarez's absence up front, whilst the Catalans are hopeful that Javier Mascherano will shrug off a hamstring problem to fill in at right-back. Even without Suarez, Barca still have plenty of firepower to call upon with Lionel Messi set to start his 700th match for club and country, whilst Neymar has netted in the final in the past two seasons. Manuel Pellegrino could also be taking charge of Alaves for the final time after a terrific campaign in which they have reached their first Cup final and finished ninth on their first season in a decade back in the top flight. And the Argentine believes Barca have merely come back down to earth after an ""abnormal"" run of success over the past decade. ""They have made the abnormal seem normal. For Barca, winning two or three trophies a season is normal. ""They have won so much that now it seems like they haven't had a good season."" Alaves have already shown the damage they can cause to Barca this season. A shock 2-1 win for the visitors at the Camp Nou in September ultimately cost Enrique's men the three points that separated them from Real Madrid in the title race come the end of the campaign. However, Alaves also suffered a Barca backlash when the visitors won 6-0 at Mendizorroza in February. ""They have the mentality of wanting to win every game. That is what they are used to,"" added Pellegrino. ""We need to play a very complete game to stand a chance."" The presence of Theo Hernandez adds extra intrigue as he too bids farewell after a highly successful loan spell at Alaves and probably to his parent club Atletico too. Left-back Hernandez looks set to become the first player since 2000 to cross the Madrid divide by signing for Real Madrid and has rebuffed the attentions of Barca to do so."
676,25/05/2017,18:01,Ex-Barcelona president Rosell held without bail,Former Barcelona president Sandro Rosell will remain in prison whilst being investigated for money laundering related to the sale of the Brazilian national football team's television rights after being denied bail on Thursday.,"After hearing Rosell's testimony before Spain's National Court on Thursday, Judge Carmen Lamela Diaz considered, in a decision made public by the court, that Rosell posed a flight risk, could destroy evidence and posed a risk of reoffending if granted bail, in a decision made public by the court. Rosell, 53, was arrested on Tuesday on suspicion that he and former head of the Brazilian football federation (CBF), Ricardo Teixeira, who is not part of the investigation, siphoned off 15 million euros ($16.8 million) in illegal commissions from TV rights deals. Rosell, his wife and three other accomplices who were also arrested on Tuesday, are accused of mounting a criminal organisation that ""laundered money from illicit commissions"" derived by Teixeira selling the rights to Brazil's matches. One of the other accused Joan Besoli was also denied bail, however both men can appeal the decision. The investigation is centred on a contract signed in 2006 to hand over the rights to 24 Brazil friendly matches to a company based in the Cayman Islands but tied to Saudi group Dallah Albaraka. The contract states that whoever bought the rights would have to pay into funds controlled by Rosell and Teixeira. In the court filing the judge suspects that Rosell received 6.58 million euros and Teixeira 8.393 million euros ""without the knowledge of the CBF and to its detriment."" The money was then transferred via a complex web of accounts to Andorra, a tiny principality wedged between Spain and France that used to be considered a tax haven. Teixeira, a former FIFA vice-president, has been indicted by US Justice Department prosecutors investigating the FIFA corruption scandal. Rosell resigned as Barcelona president in 2014 over the murky transfer dealings that brought Brazilian striker Neymar to the club from Santos. He was later cleared of all charges in connection with an alleged tax fraud case over the transfer following an agreement with prosecutors. Rosell will nevertheless be tried for fraud and corruption relating to a parallel complaint filed by Brazilian investment company DIS, which owned 40 percent of Neymar's sporting rights at the time of his transfer. DIS claim it was cheated out of its real share because part of the transfer fee was concealed by Barcelona, Santos and the Neymar family. A Spanish court earlier this month ordered Neymar and his parents to stand trial for alleged ""business corruption"" over the affair, making him the latest star from the Catalan club to have to take the stand. Five-time World Player of the Year Lionel Messi's appeal against a 21-month suspended jail sentences for tax fraud relating to his image rights was rejected on Wednesday."

""I'm not going to deny that I have an agent and obviously there are teams that are interested in me,"" said Valverde, who played for Barcelona between 1988 and 1990. ""It is not the first time that I have had offers from big clubs,"" he added. But Valverde said that he had no agreements with any club and not spoken directly to anyone. ""There is someone looking for an apartment for me in Rome, another who is looking for me a school in Barcelona..."" he joked of the media reports linking him to a new job."
678,24/05/2017,14:09,Spain Supreme Court confirms Messi fraud sentence,"Spain's Supreme Court on Wednesday confirmed a 21-month jail sentence and 2.09-million-euro ($2.25 million) fine imposed on Lionel Messi for tax fraud, months after the Barcelona football star lodged an appeal.","The Argentina international and his father Jorge Horacio Messi were in July 2016 found guilty of using companies in Belize, Britain, Switzerland and Uruguay to avoid paying taxes on 4.16 million euros of Messi's income earned from his image rights from 2007-09. The income related to Messi's image rights that was hidden includes endorsement deals with Danone, Adidas, Pepsi-Cola, Procter &amp; Gamble and the Kuwait Food Company. Both Messi, 29, and his father were given 21 months in jail -- prison terms likely to be suspended as is common in Spain for first offences for non-violent crimes carrying a sentence of less than two years. They appealed to the Supreme Court, which confirmed the sentence for the five-time world player of the year on Wednesday. However, it also reduced the term to 15 months jail for his father, taking into account that his football star son had paid back the defrauded money to tax authorities. The player and his father made a voluntary payment of 5.0 million euros -- equal to the amount of the alleged unpaid taxes plus interest -- in August 2013 after being formally investigated. During last year's trial, Messi had argued that he trusted his father with his finances and ""knew nothing"" about how his wealth was managed. Prosecutors had asked for Messi to be absolved, arguing there was no evidence that the player was aware of how his income was managed. But the Supreme Court said Wednesday that he would have known about his obligation to pay taxes. ""It defies logic to concede that someone who earns a large income does not know that he must pay taxes on it,"" the court wrote in its sentence. In its July sentence, the Barcelona court that initially found Messi guilty had argued that if the wealthy player was not punished, ""ordinary"" citizens could conclude that it was better to ""not show interest"" in their tax obligations. Messi's tax fraud trial had taken place against a backdrop of simmering voter anger over steep cuts to health and social spending, as the government struggles to bring Spain's public deficit down. Messi is far from the only Barca star to find himself embroiled in problems with the Spanish authorities. Brazil star and Barcelona forward Neymar and his parents are due to stand trial for alleged corruption over his transfer from Santos in 2013. Barca's Argentine defender Javier Mascherano also agreed a one-year suspended sentence with authorities for tax fraud last year. And former Barcelona president Sandro Rosell was arrested on Tuesday in a money laundering investigation related to the sale of the Brazilian national football team's television rights. Businessman Rosell, 53, had been manager of sporting goods giants Nike in Brazil before taking over as president of Barcelona in 2010."
679,23/05/2017,18:40,Ex-Barcelona president arrested in money laundering probe,"Former Barcelona president Sandro Rosell was arrested on Tuesday in a money laundering investigation related to the sale of the Brazilian national football team's television rights, officials said.","The authorities suspect Rosell and the former head of the Brazilian football federation, Ricardo Teixeira, of having siphoned off 15 million euros ($16.8 million) over the years, according to a source close to the investigation. Rosell's wife and three other people were also detained as part of the operation carried out in Spain's northeastern region of Catalonia, police said in a statement. ""The investigation concerns the crime of money laundering, through the collection of illegal commissions for the audovisual rights of the Brazilian national football team,"" the statement said. Earlier a police spokesman had said the money which is suspected of having been laundered came from the sale of image rights in the Brazilian national team. The authorities suspect the money was moved from Brazil to a Swiss bank account, and from there to a company owned by Rosell based in Andorra, a tiny principality wedged between Spain and France that used to be considered a tax haven. Rosell and Teixeira, who headed the Brazilian football federation between 1989 and 2012, are suspected of dividing up the bulk of this money amongst themselves. Rosell, 53, was manager of sporting goods giants Nike in Brazil and oversaw the contract for the national team to wear the US brand, before taking over as president of Barcelona in 2010. Teixeira -- a son-in-law and protege of the late Joao Havelange, who led FIFA for 24 years from 1974-1998 -- stepped down as head of the Brazilian football federation in 2012 amid corruption allegations. Brazilian authorities suspect Teixeira and Havelange of having received huge bribes from former Switzerland-based marketing company International Sport and Leisure (ISL) for granting it lucrative contracts. Police searched the homes and businesses of those arrested in Barcelona, Girona and Lleida in Catalonia and in Andorra as part of the operation. Rosell's home in an upscale Barcelona neighbourhood a short drive from the Camp Nou stadium was among the residences that were searched. Police officers removed boxes of documents from the home as journalists looked on. Rosell's wife, Marta Pineda, accompanied police as they searched another home belonging to the couple. Rosell resigned as Barcelona president in 2014 after being charged over alleged tax fraud relating to the club's signing of Brazil striker Neymar from Santos. He was later cleared of all charges in connection with the case following an agreement with prosecutors. Rosell will nevertheless be tried for fraud and corruption relating to a parallel complaint filed by Brazilian investment company DIS, which owned 40 percent of Neymar's sporting rights at the time of his transfer.

The investigation focuses on ""money laundering in companies linked to the image rights of the Brazilian football team,"" police added.

""Without doubt our consistency,"" said Enrique when asked why Barca missed out on the title. ""We let games get away that we haven't in other years. At the end of the day we've paid the price."" Barca won all of their last six games, including a thrilling 3-2 win away to Madrid last month. However, the damage was done by shock defeats at Celta Vigo, Deportivo la Coruna and Malaga, as well as at home to Alaves earlier in the campaign. ""The team did many things well this season, but the line that separates triumph form defeat is very small as we have seen. ""Hopefully, we can continue to win titles but there are rivals that want the same thing and are at our level."" Enrique, who announced his decision to step down at the end of the season back in March, has won eight trophies in three seasons in charge and can add another one with the Copa del Rey final to come against Alaves next weekend. ""We fought until the end,"" he added. ""We congratulate the champions and now think about the other title that we can still win."""

Barca said in a statement that Pique is ""recovering and readapting"" to training with the hope of being fit for the Copa del Rey final against Alaves on May 27. The Catalans need to beat Eibar to have any hope of winning a third consecutive La Liga title. However, their destiny is not in their own hands as they also need Real Madrid to lose at Malaga."

However, he claimed to have been ""privileged"" to have been in the role for three seasons. ""It will be a special night for me as it is the last league match as Barca coach,"" Enrique said on Saturday. ""When I accepted the job I knew it would be short-lived, no matter how much time I ws here. ""Barca's history is full of moments like this. People come and go. ""I am very proud to have formed part of that history. I am a privileged one and next season I will be at the Camp Nou for many games as a fan. ""It is not a goodbye, but a see you later."" Sunday will not be Enrique's last game in charge, though, as Barca can win the ninth trophy of his tenure in the Copa del Rey final next weekend against Alaves."
684,06/05/2017,17:53,Barcelona give backing to Catalan independence referendum,"Barcelona on Saturday gave their backing to a referendum for Catalan independence, which the region's president Carles Puigdemont wants to hold later this year.","A brief statement released by the reigning Spanish champions said they ""agreed with the National Pact for the Referendum, the campaign to gather support from institutions, organisations, those in elected office and individuals inside and outside Catalonia."" Catalonia is currently governed by the Junts Pel Si (Together for Yes) coalition that backs breaking away from the rest of Spain. Puigdemont has promised to hold a referendum in September, regardless of whether Spain's Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy agrees. Rajoy has already stated several times that he will not permit a referendum, saying the Spanish constitution does not allow it. A non-binding vote was held by the Catalan government in 2014, with more than 80 percent voting in favour of independence. Former Catalan president Artur Mas was given a two-year ban from public office for organising the referendum, which was illegal. Barcelona, who are currently top of La Liga and whose motto declares they are ""more than a club"", have always maintained close links with Catalanism. In recent years the Catalan separatist flag, known as the ""estelada"", has become a frequent symbol among the club's fans. The display of these flags at Champions League games has got Barcelona into trouble with UEFA, European football's governing body fining them 150,000 euros ($165,000) last year. UEFA regulations prohibit any ""messages of a political nature"" being shown at games. Barca initially said they would appeal the fine to the Court of Arbitration for Sport but later let it drop, while UEFA said they would review their rules on political symbols in stadiums."

An initial court statement had said Neymar and his parents were also accused of fraud, but a detailed court document seen later by AFP revealed the trio have only been charged with ""business corruption."" The two clubs, Barcelona and Brazil's Santos, have also been ordered to stand trial for fraud. Neymar's arrival from Brazil's Santos has been a huge success for the Spanish champions on the pitch but a judicial nightmare off it. The 25-year-old striker is being investigated in Brazil and Spain over his headline move to La Liga. The case initiated with a complaint from Brazilian investment company DIS, which owned 40 percent of Neymar's sporting rights at the time of his transfer. DIS received just 6.8 million euros -- 40 percent of the 17 million euros fee paid to Santos -- with the company claiming it was cheated out of its real share because part of the transfer fee was concealed by Barcelona, Santos and the Neymar family. The court suspects Santos was actually paid 25 million euros, which would mean DIS was cheated out of 3.5 million euros. Barcelona originally published the transfer figure as 57.1 million euros ($62.6 million), with 40 million euros of that given to the player's family and the rest to Santos. DIS has called for five-year sentences for Neymar and his parents, who acted as the player's representatives, eight years for Rosell and Bartomeu plus a mammoth 195-million-euro fine for Barca. Spanish prosecutors have recommended that Neymar be handed a two-year jail sentence and fined 10 million euros. Sentences of two years or less are habitually suspended for first time offenders in Spain. However, DIS also recommended that Neymar be banned from playing football during any judicial sentence. In July 2016 a judge ruled that irregularities in the transfer were detected, but said it was an issue for a civil court, not a criminal court to settle. But prosecutors successfully argued the player and his father were aware of potentially fraudulent dealings between Barcelona and Santos to the detriment of DIS to fully overturn that decision. The decision to order Neymar to stand trial is another blow to the image of the Spanish giants and the player himself. Barcelona hoped to bring an end to the murky affair when the club agreed to pay a 5.5-million-euro fine in a deal with prosecutors in June to settle a separate case and ensure the club avoided trial on tax-evasion charges over the transfer. Neymar is far from the only Barca star to find himself embroiled in problems with the Spanish authorities. Five-time World Player of the Year Lionel Messi and his father were given 21-month suspended jail sentences in July 2016 for tax fraud relating to the player's image rights. Barca's Argentine defender Javier Mascherano also agreed a one-year suspended sentence with authorities for tax fraud earlier this year. The off-field upheaval hasn't affected Barca, Neymar's signing being an undoubted sporting success as he has formed one of the most fearsome strike partnerships of all-time with Messi and Luis Suarez. Barca have won back-to-back Spanish league and Cup doubles with the trio and won the Champions League in 2015. Neymar signed a bumper new deal with the club to extend his contract until 2021 in July 2016 despite admitting he held talks with Paris Saint-Germain amidst interest from a host of top European clubs in luring him away."

It was Neymar's first red card for the club, but Enrique is wary of the fact he will be a target as Espanyol try to derail their city rivals' title chances. ""He is a specialist in putting up with these type of situations because if there is a player used to being fouled and, above all, fouled with force, it is Neymar,"" said Enrique on Friday. ""He has been sent-off very few times in his career. ""He is a player that controls his emotions well, but without doubt tomorrow is a game in which controlling your emotions will be vital and necessary."" Victory at the Bernabeu last weekend brought Barca back into the title race. However, with both Real and Barca locked on 78 points, it is Madrid who retain the upper hand as they have a game in hand with five games remaining to Barca's four. ""At this stage of the season every game is vital. At the Bernabeu it was because it was against a direct rival and not winning would have practically finished the title race. ""Now for the number of games left we need to win every game."" Neymar is expected to replace Paco Alcacer in Barca's only change from the side that started El Clasico last weekend.

Earlier this week, British newspaper The Sun quoted Xavi as saying that his friend and former coach Pep Guardiola wanted to sign Spurs star Dele Alli for Manchester City. This in turn prompted a response from Pochettino in which he labelled Xavi as his ""enemy"", because of the pair's rivalry when the Argentinian played and managed Barca's city rivals Espanyol. Xavi though said the whole incident was ""unbelievable"". ""I feel bad -- because the interview of The Sun was a fake -- and it's the reason of Pochettino's response,"" Xavi told AFP in Doha, where he now plays his football. ""I don't...(have) enemies in my life, even in football. ""Pochettino's not my enemy, he's not my enemy.""

A lot of players and former coaches of Espanyol go to Barcelona."" He added: ""I think he can, he's now one of the best coaches, in the Premier League. He could be a good possibility."" The ""fake"" row has now come full circle after Guardiola insisted that he was not interested in signing Alli, the 21-year-old who has just been named England's Young Player of the Year for the second season running. Tottenham currently lie second in the English Premier League, four points behind leaders Chelsea. Xavi also said he was convinced that Guardiola would succeed in England, despite the fact the Manchester City coach will end the season without a trophy for the first time in his career.

Michel himself had said he'd rather provide Real with a ""guard of honour"" than a ""blow"" when the European champions visit the Rosaleda on the final day of the season.

""He is the best player for me in history and I have seen a lot of football,"" said Enrique. ""In modern football when everyone is tactically and physically better he still makes the difference. ""The fact he has scored his 500th goal shows all of us as Barca fans are lucky to have him identified with the club."" The timing of Messi's strike also saw Barca gain revenge for Sergio Ramos's stoppage time equaliser in a 1-1 draw when the sides last met back in December. ""It is marvellous for us to win in the 92nd minute. It is something that is normally more a characteristic of our rivals, but we like to do it too,"" added Enrique. Barca lead at the top of the table thanks to their better head-to-head record. Madrid, though, still have the advantage as they have a game in hand.

However, he and Barca captain Andres Iniesta called on Messi, whose contract expires at the end of next season, not to follow him in leaving the Camp Nou. ""Barca is an incredible club with many years of history, but without doubt an important part of that history is Leo Messi,"" Enrique said. ""I think the great thing about Leo is that he continues to surprise,"" said Iniesta. ""After so many years he is still decisive. It is an honour and a blessing for the club to have him."" By contrast, Real Madrid boss Zinedine Zidane was left to lament his side's over adventurous nature after conceding in stoppage time after being reduced to 10 men. Messi had cancelled out Casemiro's opener before half-time. But Barca looked well on the road to victory when Ivan Rakitic's stunning effort put the visitors 2-1 in front before Madrid captain Sergio Ramos was sent off for a wild lunge on Messi. However, Madrid rallied when a man down as substitute James Rodriguez fired home an equaliser four minutes from time. ""Drawing the game with 10 men, to press high up the field is dangerous and we paid for that,"" said Zidane. ""I can't criticise the players for anything though. We gave our all, but we didn't manage to get the three points. ""We didn't deserve to lose, but that is football."" Madrid now need to take at least 16 points from their final six La Liga games to be guaranteed the title. ""There will be much more of a title race, but it is still in our own hands,"" added Zidane. Madrid were also dealt a fresh injury blow for the remainder of their league season and upcoming Champions League semi-finals against Atletico Madrid as Gareth Bale faces another spell on the sidelines. The Welshman lasted just 38 minutes on his return after missing Madrid's last two outings with persistent ankle problems. ""I don't regret anything,"" said Zidane over his decision to start Bale. ""I am disappointed for him. He started the game well and then the injuries we can't control. ""We will see what exactly the injury is and hope it is as little as possible."""
694,24/04/2017,01:57,'Best ever' Messi turns tables on Madrid,Barcelona coach Luis Enrique revelled in turning the tables on bitter rivals Real Madrid as Lionel Messi struck deep into stoppage time to edge a thrilling El Clasico 3-2 on Sunday.,"Messi's second goal of the night was his 500th for Barcelona and took the Catalans to the top of La Liga. ""He is the best player for me in history and I have seen a lot of football,"" said Enrique. ""In modern football when everyone is tactically and physically better he still makes the difference. ""The fact he has scored his 500th goal shows all of us as Barca fans are lucky to have him identified with the club."" The timing of Messi's strike also saw Barca gain revenge for Sergio Ramos's stoppage time equaliser in a 1-1 draw when the sides last met back in December. ""It is marvellous for us to win in the 92nd minute. It is something that is normally more a characteristic of our rivals, but we like to do it too,"" added Enrique. Barca lead at the top of the table thanks to their better head-to-head record. Madrid, though, still have the advantage as they have a game in hand. ""To score in the 92nd minute is a huge confidence boost,"" said Enrique, who will leave the club at the end of the season. However, he and Barca captain Andres Iniesta called on Messi, whose contract expires at the end of next season, not to follow him in leaving the Camp Nou. ""Barca is an incredible club with many years of history, but without doubt an important part of that history is Leo Messi,"" Enrique said. ""I think the great thing about Leo is that he continues to surprise,"" said Iniesta. ""After so many years he is still decisive. It is an honour and a blessing for the club to have him."" By contrast, Real Madrid boss Zinedine Zidane was left to lament his side's over adventurous nature after conceding in stoppage time after being reduced to 10 men. Messi had cancelled out Casemiro's opener before half-time. But Barca looked well on the road to victory when Ivan Rakitic's stunning effort put the visitors 2-1 in front before Madrid captain Sergio Ramos was sent off for a wild lunge on Messi. However, Madrid rallied when a man down as substitute James Rodriguez fired home an equaliser four minutes from time. ""Drawing the game with 10 men, to press high up the field is dangerous and we paid for that,"" said Zidane. ""I can't criticise the players for anything though. We gave our all, but we didn't manage to get the three points. ""We didn't deserve to lose, but that is football."" Madrid now need to take at least 16 points from their final six La Liga games to be guaranteed the title. ""There will be much more of a title race, but it is still in our own hands,"" added Zidane. Madrid were also dealt a fresh injury blow for the remainder of their league season and upcoming Champions League semi-finals against Atletico Madrid as Gareth Bale faces another spell on the sidelines. The Welshman lasted just 38 minutes on his return after missing Madrid's last two outings with persistent ankle problems. ""I don't regret anything,"" said Zidane over his decision to start Bale. ""I am disappointed for him. He started the game well and then the injuries we can't control. ""We will see what exactly the injury is and hope it is as little as possible."""
695,23/04/2017,10:58,Barcelona drop bid to play Neymar in Clasico,"Barcelona will not call up star forward Neymar for the potential title decider with Real Madrid, the Spanish champions said on Sunday, just hours before El Clasico.","""Given the legal uncertainty of the lack of a decision by the Court of Arbitration for Sport (TAD) with the game tonight less than 12 hours away, and to focus all attention on the sporting aspect, the club has decided not to call up Neymar,"" a Barcelona statement said. Barcelona appealed to Spain's TAD late on Friday over Neymar's three-game suspension in the hope it would be frozen, which would have allowed him to take part in Sunday's must-win showdown at Real."
696,23/04/2017,03:30,Neymar ban dispute rages ahead of Clasico,Neymar looks set to travel with the Barcelona squad for Sunday's El Clasico against Real Madrid as the Catalans continue to fight his suspension for the potentially title-deciding clash.,"The Brazilian is in the midst of a three-game suspension for his red card and subsequent sarcastic applause of the officials in Barca's 2-0 defeat to Malaga two weeks ago. Barca's appeal to Spain's Court of Arbitration for Sport (TAD) wasn't placed until after the court's normal meeting time on Friday. The club argue that until a ruling on the appeal is held, Neymar's ban should be suspended and therefore allow him to feature at the Bernabeu. ""The club asks TAD to present a ruling and, unless it confirms the player's ban, it grants the provisional suspension of the ban,"" Barca said in a statement. ""As a coach I am prepared to play with Neymar or without him,"" said coach Luis Enrique on Saturday. However, even if no ruling from TAD is forthcoming before kick-off on Sunday (1845GMT), Barca would be taking an enormous risk by playing Neymar as they could be sanctioned with defeat for fielding an ineligible player. Barca's desperation for Neymar to be involved speaks volumes as the side most in need of the points. Enrique says his last Clasico in charge is a must-win for the reigning La Liga champions. Madrid hold a three-point lead at the top with a game in hand on their rivals as they close in on a first La Liga title in five years. ""Given how close it is to the end of the season it is a decisive weekend,"" said Enrique. ""This time a Clasico can decide or almost decide the league or leave it very open. For us it is like a final, only a win will do."" Madrid could be boosted by the return of Gareth Bale from injury, but the fact the Welshman may not be risked is a further sign that Real have far more room for error. Bale has been sidelined by an inflammation of the muscles around where he suffered ligament damage in his right ankle that kept him out for three months earlier in the season. ""He will be with us on Sunday,"" said Madrid boss Zinedine Zidane. ""You will see tomorrow what team we are going to start with."" Should Bale not start, the on-form Isco is favourite to take his place, as he did for Madrid's thrilling 4-2 Champions League win over Bayern Munich after extra-time in midweek. Centre-backs Raphael Varane and Pepe are Madrid's only injury absentees meaning Zidane is expected to name the same starting XI as against Bayern. ""It is another important game. There is a lot of tiredness, but also a lot of excitement and desire to keep doing what we are doing,"" added the Frenchman. Only victory will salvage Barca's season just four days after crashing out of the Champions League at the quarter-final stage to Juventus. However, Enrique called on his players to embrace that challenge as an extra stimulus rather than be cowered by the pressure at the Bernabeu. ""For some it means it is a very attractive challenge and for others it means pressure,"" he said. ""I prefer to take it as an attractive and marvellous challenge. It's a chance to move level on points with Madrid."""
697,22/04/2017,14:56,Luis Enrique relishing Clasico with or without Neymar,Barcelona boss Luis Enrique said he has prepared for his last El Clasico against Real Madrid on Sunday with or without star forward Neymar.,"The Brazilian is expected to serve the second of a three-game ban for his red card and subsequent sarcastic applause of the officials in Barca's 2-0 defeat to Malaga a fortnight ago. However, the club have explored every option to have him available. An appeal to Spain's Court of Arbitration for Sport (TAD) was deliberately delayed until after the court's normal Friday meeting to decide on appeals in the hope that would automatically see the ban suspended. However, TAD could still call an emergency meeting on Saturday, and, even if they don't, Barca would risk being sanctioned with defeat for fielding an ineligible player should Neymar feature. ""I think the club are correct in their position to defend the club's interests,"" said Enrique, who is leaving Barca at the end of the season. ""As a coach I am prepared to play with Neymar or without him."" Barca trail Madrid by three points at the top of La Liga and have played a game more than their title rivals. And Enrique accepted Barca's hopes of a third straight title depend on winning at the Santiago Bernabeu. ""Given how close it is to the end of the season it is a decisive weekend,"" he added. ""This time a Clasico can decide or almost decide the league or leave it very open. ""For us it is like a final, only a win will do."" Barca were dumped out of the Champions League by Juventus in midweek, but Enrique believes his players should see the chance to bounce straight back against Madrid as an opportunity rather than extra pressure. ""For some it means it is a very attractive challenge and for others it means pressure,"" he added. ""I prefer to take it as an attractive and marvellous challenge. It's a chance to move level on points with Madrid."""
698,21/04/2017,18:51,Barca in last-gasp bid to have banned Neymar back for Clasico,Barcelona made a last-gasp bid to have star striker Neymar back for Sunday's critical Clasico clash with an appeal to a Spanish sports court against his three-game ban.,"As it stands the 25-year-old is set to miss the blockbuster showdown at the Santiago Bernabeu after being shown the first red card of his Barcelona career for two bookable offences in a 2-0 defeat at Malaga earlier this month that badly dented their hopes of retaining the Spanish title. ""With the Appeal Committee (Spanish federation) dismissing FC Barcelona's appeal for the three-match suspension of Neymar Jr, the club will appeal the decision to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (in Spain),"" Barcelona said in a statement. Neymar has already missed Barcelona's 3-2 win over Real Sociedad and will also miss Wednesday's game against Osasuna if the Spanish court (TAD) turns down the appeal."
699,20/04/2017,16:16,Spain Supreme Court reviews Messi tax-fraud sentence,"Spain's Supreme Court on Thursday started reviewing a 21-month jail sentence handed to Lionel Messi and his father for tax fraud after the Barcelona star lodged an appeal, a spokesman said.","But even if the sentence is maintained, neither Messi nor his father are likely to spend time behind bars, as is common in Spain for first offences for non-violent crimes carrying a sentence of less than two years. A spokesman for the Supreme Court said the case was being examined by five magistrates, a process that could last several days. News of the review comes just days before Barcelona face Real Madrid in El Clasico on Sunday with their Spanish league title at stake. Argentina international Messi and father Jorge Horacio Messi were found guilty last July of using companies in Belize, Britain, Switzerland and Uruguay to avoid paying taxes on 4.16 million euros ($4.5 million) of Messi's income earned from his image rights from 2007-09. Messi has always maintained he knew nothing about how his wealth was managed and trusted his father with his finances. His lawyers appealed the sentence. Messi's tax fraud trial took place in Barcelona last June against a backdrop of simmering voter anger over steep cuts to health and social spending, as the government struggles to bring Spain's public deficit down. The court argued in its ruling that the 29-year-old five-time world player of the year ""decided to remain in ignorance"" about how his finances were managed. It added that if the player was not punished, ""ordinary"" citizens could conclude that it was better to ""not show interest"" in their tax obligations. Messi was also fined 2.09 million euros and his father 1.6 million euros."
700,20/04/2017,15:15,Barca can turn Euro pain to Clasico gain - Enrique,Barcelona boss Luis Enrique insists his final season in charge can still end in glory despite bowing out of the Champions League at the quarter-final stage to Juventus.,"Juventus held onto their 3-0 first leg lead to progress to the last four by blunting Barca's star-studded attack in a 0-0 draw on Wednesday. Neymar left the field in tears, but around the Camp Nou there was appreciation for Barca's valiant effort by the near 100,000 crowd. ""It's a sad night, but we tried until the last minute and that was recognised by the fans at the end,"" said Enrique, who will step down at the end of the campaign. ""This is (a) team that never gives up, that fights for every title, doesn't relax and always accepts the challenge. ""It is a joy to belong to a club like this."" Barca travel to face eternal rivals Real Madrid in El Clasico on Sunday realistically needing to win to maintain their hopes of a third straight La Liga title. Madrid lead by three points at the top of the table, but also have a game in hand. ""Barca have a team built to compete, to win trophies and to face every challenge. ""It is clear we are very hurt to be eliminated from a competition that excites us so much, but now comes a key game against the leaders and a direct rival. ""We have to get ready to compete and I am sure we will do that."" Barca will be without Neymar at the Bernabeu through suspension and the Catalans will need Lionel Messi back in top form as the Argentine was off target with the only two clear chances the hosts created on Wednesday. ""We had 13 or 14 shots, but I think only one was on target, which are the ones that tend to do damage,"" added Enrique. Juventus are now in the last four for the second time in three years under coach Massimiliano Allegri. However, he believes they are far more equipped to win the Champions League for a third time than when they lost to Barca in the final two years ago. ""The self-belief of the team has grown a lot,"" said Allegri. ""There are only two players who started tonight who started the final in Berlin. ""That says a lot of how well the club has recruited. ""We are desperate to go as far as we can and achieve something extraordinary."" Barca defender Gerard Pique recognised that Juventus had deserved to go through over the two legs. ""Overall they were the better team and deserved to go through,"" he told BeIN Sports Spain. ""Little-by-little we started to create chances, but they built a mountain. It wasn't to be."" And Pique also called on the Barca players to reward the fans' support at full-time with victory in the Clasico. ""That the fans were still singing needs to be remembered. I think it is one of the few times I have seen the Camp Nou like that in a defeat. It moved me and makes me proud,"" he added. ""We will go to the Bernabeu to compete and try to win. ""In the last few years it has been good to us. We are not in our best moment, but we can win."""
701,20/04/2017,14:46,'Unbeatable' Juve hailed as Euro dream takes shape,"""Unbeatable"" Juventus can finally hand goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon an elusive Champions League title after making five-time winners Barcelona ""cry"" on their way to a spectacular Champions League semi-final exit on Wednesday.","Those were the headlines splashed across the front pages a day after rock-solid Juventus followed their impressive 3-0 first-leg win over the Spanish giants with a defensive masterclass that held Barca to a frustrating scoreless draw at the Camp Nou. As Juve celebrated a 3-0 aggregate win at a stunned but appreciative Nou Camp, Barcelona -- who beat Juventus on their way to triumph in 2015 -- crashed out of the competition after seeing stars Lionel Messi, Luis Suarez and Neymar fail to find the net over 180 underwhelming minutes. ""Fly Juve Fly"" was the front page headline on Italy's biggest-selling sports daily La Gazzetta dello Sport, which included a vignette showing teary-eyed Barca star Neymar being comforted by former club defender Dani Alves. Corriere dello Sport used the same dramatic picture of Alves and Neymar to fully illustrate the Brazilian starlet's disappointment. ""You made them cry,"" screamed Corriere's headline, while for Turin-based Tuttosport Juventus are simply ""Unbeatable"". Even Barcelona, outdone by Paulo Dybala's impressive brace and Giorgio Chiellini's 55th minute header in Turin last week, had to agree. ""Compliments to @Juventusfc for reaching the semi-final,"" the Catalan club wrote on its official Twitter page. To which Juventus replied: ""Thank @FCBarcelona, it's an honour to beat such a great opponent."" Juve go into Friday's semi-final draw along with Real Madrid, Monaco and Atletico Madrid -- all of whom have faced Massimiliano Allegri's men in recent European campaigns. For Barca defender Gerard Pique, though, the Italians showed enough over the two legs to merit another tilt at the trophy they last won in 1996 with a 4-2 penalties victory over Ajax. ""Over the two legs, they were better than us so they deserve to go through to the semi-finals. I think they can win the Champions League this season,"" said Pique. Gazzetta dello Sport suggested Juve's virtually ""impenetrable defence"" should also give 39-year-old club legend Buffon the chance to add a trophy from Europe's premier club competition to his long list of titles and accolades. ""It's your year. With a defence like this you can lift the trophy,"" said an inside-page headline. Currently on their way to a record sixth consecutive Serie A title and a third successive league and Cup double, Juve can also target an unprecedented club treble -- last achieved by an Italian club by Inter Milan under Jose Mourinho in 2010. ""Henceforth, there's no doubt: there's a smell of the treble in the air,"" wrote Gazzetta columnist Alessandro De Calo. While Allegri applauded the achievement of keeping a clean sheet against Barca, he believes there's more to come. ""It's almost unheard of for Barcelona to fail to score over two legs. But the lads need to realise they can do even better. We are slowly improving,"" Allegri told Mediaset Premium. ""I'm satisfied with what we're achieving but the onus is not on maintaining current form. Instead, we should aim to improve it."" After Real Madrid overcame Bayern Munich 4-2 on Tuesday to send the Bundesliga giants packing, Juve fans were celebrating. The Germans have stopped Juve in their tracks twice in recent seasons, at the quarter-final stage in 2013 then again in the last 16 last year. But after seeing his Juve side oust both Monaco, in the quarters, and Real, in the semis, on their way to a 3-1 final defeat by Barcelona in 2015, Allegri should be wary of Atletico. Runners-up to Real Madrid last year, the Spaniards have beaten Juve once and held them to a draw on their previous two meetings."
702,19/04/2017,22:40,Juventus hold firm to knock out Barcelona,Barcelona failed to produce another miraculous Champions League comeback as Juventus held out for a 0-0 draw at the Camp Nou on Wednesday to reach the semi-finals 3-0 on aggregate.,"The Spanish champions had overcome a 4-0 first leg deficit against Paris Saint-Germain in the last 16 with a dramatic 6-1 win back on home soil. But Juventus showed why they boast the best defensive record in the competition as Lionel Messi, Luis Suarez and Neymar were blunted as the Italians gained revenge for their defeat in the 2015 Champions League final. Juventus join holders Real Madrid, Atletico Madrid and Monaco in Friday's semi-final draw. Straight from kick-off the visitors seemed determined to learn from the French champions' mistakes. Massimiliano Allegri's men pressed high to prevent Barca dominating possession and enjoyed the better of the early chances. Former Real Madrid striker Gonzalo Higuain volleyed over from the edge of the area before only a brilliant challenge from Gerard Pique prevented Juan Cuadrado's cross providing Higuain with a tap in. Barca had to wait 19 minutes for their first clear sight of goal as they intricately worked the ball around a packed Juventus box before Messi fired inches wide. Messi then Gianluigi Buffon's palms for the first time on the half hour mark. At the other end, Higuain threatened again when he just couldn't get enough power on Miralem Pjanic's dinked cross to beat Marc-Andre ter Stegen. Neymar had been Barca's hero in a remarkable finish with two goals and an assist in the final minutes against PSG. Yet, he found it far harder up against friend and former Barca teammate Dani Alves and his frustrations at a perceived lack of protection from referee Bjorn Kuipers spilled over as he was booked just before half-time. Juventus also had the first big chance of the second half as Cuadrado fired across Ter Stegen but wide of the far post. Ter Stegen was then forced to turn behind another driven effort from the Colombian. Messi was being forced to come deep in search of possession, but he briefly had Juventus hearts in mouths with a low effort that was deflected inches wide. Barca boss Luis Enrique forlornly turned to Paco Alcacer from the bench as the hosts played with four forwards for the final half hour. Messi had another big chance after a rare Buffon handling error from a corner, but unfortunately for Barca it fell on his right foot and the Argentine fired well over. Sergi Roberto was Barca's unlikely hero with the 95th minute goal that sealed the 6-1 win over PSG six weeks ago. He nearly delivered another important and rare goal, but when the right-back's effort flew inches wide 20 minutes from time so did Barcelona's hopes. Juventus comfortably saw out the final stages to register their eighth clean sheet in 10 Champions League games this season. And the only negative news of the night for the Bianconeri was a yellow card for Sami Khedira that will rule the German international out of the first leg of their semi-final."
703,18/04/2017,15:43,Barca need five to beat Juve - Luis Enrique,"Barcelona will need to hit at least five goals past Juventus to produce another miracle Champions League comeback, but have nothing to lose according to outgoing coach Luis Enrique.","The Catalans made Champions League history by overcoming a 4-0 first leg deficit to beat Paris Saint-Germain 6-1 in the last round, but have another mountain to climb at the Camp Nou on Wednesday as they trail their quarter-final tie 3-0. ""We need to score fewer goals,"" said an upbeat Enrique facing what could be his last European game in charge. ""But bearing in mind the opponent could have chances and the goal can come at any moment, our objective is to score five."" Enrique foresaw Barca's recovery in the last 16, claiming an attack laced with the potential of Lionel Messi, Luis Suarez and Neymar was capable of scoring six against the French champions. And he called for an expected near 100,000 crowd to play their part as they did against PSG. ""We don't have anything to lose. We are free from pressure. Juventus have the semi-finals in their pocket and will have to decide whether to sit back or attack,"" he added. ""We only have one option which is to attack, attack and attack again. ""I am sure that if we score the first goal, the Camp Nou will score the second and the third will come of its own accord."" Barca captain Andres Iniesta was more cautious in his optimism, recognising the first leg in Turin had been ""a terrible result."" However, he believes Barca have the potential to at least create some doubt in Juventus minds. ""Nowadays teams respect us a lot. I am convinced they know we can cause them problems,"" said Iniesta. ""We have the potential, the players and reason to believe we can turn this tie around or at least get close to it. ""We need to create doubts so at some point they see the tie is in danger. ""Everything depends on playing a perfect game in every sense."" Barca scored three times in the final two minutes plus stoppage time as PSG froze in a grandstand finish six weeks ago. And Enrique insisted Barca can't lose belief even if the goals don't come early against a Juventus defence that has conceded just two in nine Champions League games this season. ""Don't leave in the 80th minute,"" he said in a message to the fans. ""We are going to try until the end. Those of us who experienced the game against PSG have another chance to experience a historic night. ""We have seen that Barca can score three goals in three minutes so we will stay together until the 95th minute."" Juventus defender Giorgio Chiellini won his latest battle with Luis Suarez in the first leg after the Uruguayan famously bit the Italian at the 2014 World Cup. Chiellini scored his side's third goal a week ago after Paulo Dybala's early double and insists Juventus will need all their experience to stand up to Barca's ""sharks"". ""We will have to play without fear because they are like sharks - they smell blood and they finish you off,"" he told Sky Sports Italia. The visitors were handed a big injury boost as Dybala has been passed fit to play despite picking up an ankle injury in Saturday's 2-0 win at Pescara. Barca will welcome back Iniesta and Neymar from the side that beat Real Sociedad 3-2 at the weekend with Messi's double in that match taking him within two of 500 goals for the club."
704,18/04/2017,02:10,Rising star Dybala is Messi's mirror image,"Diminutive, dynamic and armed with a deadly left foot, Paulo Dybala could be a prototype of a Lionel Messi clone.","The similarities between the two Argentines, who face off in Wednesday's Champions League quarter-final second leg between Juventus and Barcelona, have been noted by Dybala's strike partner Gonzalo Higuain among others. The fact that Argentina now looks for the next Messi rather than the next Diego Maradona is as good a testament to the five-time world player of the year's achievements as any. Hundreds of talented number 10s were christened as Maradona's heir before Messi turned even the ""Hand of God"" into distant memory. ""Messi is the best, he shows it every day,"" said Higuain, who joined Juventus in a fractious transfer from Napoli for 90 million euros ($96 million) at the start of the season and has played alongside Messi for most of his 68 Argentina caps. ""Paulo is still young. He is 23 and has the world at his feet,"" he told Premium Sport. The younger man won the battle in the first leg last week with a quickfire first-half double as Juventus claimed a commanding 3-0 lead. However to win the war, the Italian champions must resist for 90 minutes at the Camp Nou to prevent another famous Barcelona comeback. The Catalans overcame a record 4-0 first-leg deficit by beating Paris Saint-Germain 6-1 in the second leg at home in the last 16. ""It's one of my greatest nights in football,"" said Dybala after the first leg. ""Let's not ruin it now."" Last week in Turin was only the second time Dybala and Messi have graced the same pitch. The first time was a far unhappier experience for Dybala as he was sent off on his first start for Argentina. A tearful Dybala was consoled and bailed out by his captain that night as Messi scored the only goal in a 1-0 World Cup qualifying win over Uruguay last September. ""Messi told me to be calm, that these things happen and that it was the referee's fault,"" Dybala said afterwards. Yet, even a red card brought comparisons to Messi as he too was sent off for the only time in his career just minutes into his Argentina debut. Dybala's big break in the national team could yet come due to another piece of uncharacteristic Messi indiscipline. Messi is banned for three of Argentina's four remaining games of a floundering World Cup qualifying campaign, with Dybala clearly the most natural replacement. Even despite seeing red that night in Mendoza, Dybala achieved a long-awaited ""dream"". ""My dream was to play a one-two with him and I managed to do that,"" he said. ""It is incredible to play by his side."" Higuain knows more than most about the joys and pressures of playing next to Messi. The former Real Madrid man is often derided as the reason Messi has failed to win a major international trophy having missed gilt-edged chances in the 2014 World Cup and 2015 and 2016 Copa America finals. Matching Messi is an almost impossible task. At 23, he had already won the Ballon d'Or and is now just two goals off a remarkable 500 for Barcelona. However, Higuain recognises a common talent and points to Messi's consistency as the goal for his teammate to reach. ""He has the characteristics to become one of the best players in the world. ""After getting to the top so quickly, it is not easy to stay there for many years. ""There will be many ups and downs and you have to always maintain an equilibrium and not listen to the critics or the compliments."""
705,14/04/2017,15:57,Unrepentant Enrique plots new Euro revival,Barcelona boss Luis Enrique insisted he made no tactical errors in his side's 3-0 defeat to Juventus and talked up Barca's chances of another stunning Champions League revival on Friday.,"The Spanish champions suffered back-to-back defeats at Malaga and Juventus in the past week to severely damage their hopes of winning La Liga or the Champions League. However, having overcome a 4-0 first-leg deficit to beat Paris Saint-Germain in the last 16, Enrique is convinced Barca still have a shot at another miraculous comeback when the sides meet for their quarter-final return leg on Wednesday. ""If I wasn't able to get across to my players how I wanted them to play, I am responsible, but in the tactical planning for Turin I didn't make any mistakes,"" said Enrique, who will step down as coach at the end of the season. ""I don't doubt the team will have chances to turn the tie around, in fact it is easier than against PSG."" Barca will be without the suspended Neymar for Real Sociedad's visit on Saturday as he begins a three-game ban for sarcastically applauding the officials after receiving the first red card of his Barca career at Malaga last weekend. However, the Catalans have no room for error as they trail Real Madrid by three points at the top of La Liga, having played a game more than their title rivals. Madrid also host Barca in El Clasico next weekend. ""Everything depends on getting back on the road to victory against Real Sociedad and then we will see what happens in the Champions League,"" he added. ""We need the points as a morale boost to continue fighting for La Liga."" And Enrique called on the fans at the Camp Nou not to pick out those they feel were responsible for Barca's collapse in Turin in midweek. ""If they need to boo players, my advice would be to wait until the end of the season,"" he said. ""In this situation I only see the need to rebel and fight against all the adversity."""
706,12/04/2017,12:47,"""Disastrous"" Barca struggle to believe in new miracle","Outgoing Barcelona coach Luis Enrique turned on his misfiring stars after ""reliving a nightmare"" with his side's 3-0 humbling by Juventus in the first leg of their Champions League quarter-final.","Barca produced the biggest Champions League comeback of all time in the last 16, overturning a 4-0 first leg deficit by scoring three times in a crazy final 10 minutes to beat the French champions 6-1. However, a downcast and visibly angry Enrique said he found it ""harder to believe in a comeback"" than even the night in Paris that precipitated his decision to step down at the end of the season eight weeks ago. ""The first-half was a disaster, like it was the third half of the PSG game,"" said Enrique, who then took an out of character shot at the Barca players' attitude. ""I haven't been able to transmit my ideas well to my players because that was nothing like what I asked for. I feel very sad and impotent. What we saw was very serious. ""The positioning with the ball is my responsibility, but without it the intensity has to be different."" Enrique was filmed banging a table in his dugout in anger after watching a replay of Pablo Dybala's second goal in the first 22 minutes. In a recurring theme of Barca's season Giorgio Chiellini then exposed a weakness from set-pieces to add Juventus' third just after half-time. ""Crucified,"" ran the headline of Barca daily Sport alongside a picture of Enrique. ""Very sad. Very serious,"" said the front cover of its rival Mundo Deportivo. Enrique's announcement that he would not be renewing his contract a week after defeat in Paris appeared to have released the bubbling tension between players and coach as Barca's improved form provoked dreams of the possibility of a second treble in three seasons under the Asturian coach. Indeed, after Saturday's 1-1 draw between Real Madrid and Atletico Madrid, Barca had the La Liga title race back in their own hands. However, they kicked off a disastrous three days with a shock 2-0 defeat at Malaga to once again hand Real the initiative in the title race in which Neymar saw his first red card for the club. And the Brazilian's sarcastic applause of the officials as he left the field has seen him hit with a three-match ban, meaning he will miss next weekend's potential title decider with Real at the Santiago Bernabeu. Barca's hopes of a third straight Spanish title depend on winning that match, but defeat in Turin was just a continuation of the Catalans' poor away form this season. They have now been beaten five times on the road in 2017 and have conceded at least three goals in three of their last four Champions League games away from home. Producing another remarkable comeback against a Juventus defence that has conceded just twice in seven Champions League games this season seems even more unlikely than Barca's historic feat against PSG. Yet, as bad as they have been away from the Camp Nou, the force of nearly 100,000 fans and a front three of Lionel Messi, Luis Suarez and Neymar means Juventus will not relish their trip to Catalonia in a weeks' time. If there is any hope for Barca to cling to, it is that they have won all of four Champions League fixures at home this season by a combined 21 goals to one."

Having overturned a 4-0 first-leg deficit against Paris Saint-Germain in the last 16 by winning the return 6-1, Barcelona will need another stunning comeback in next week's second leg if they are to reach the last four."
708,11/04/2017,18:36,Neymar banned for Clasico against Real,"Barcelona's Brazilian superstar Neymar will miss a huge La Liga clash at Real Madrid on April 23 after being handed a three-game suspension, the Spanish federation said on Tuesday.","The 25-year-old forward was shown the first red card of his Barcelona career for two bookable offences as Barca's title defence suffered a big blow in a 2-0 defeat at Malaga on Saturday. However, he was handed an extra two-match suspension on top of the automatic one-game ban for sarcastically applauding the officials as he left the pitch. Barcelona are expected to appeal the decision. As well as missing a potential La Liga title decider at the Bernabeu, Neymar will be absent for home games against Real Sociedad and Osasuna. Madrid lead Barca by three points at the top of the table but also have a game in hand as they close on a first league title in five years. Neymar was booked in the first half at La Rosaleda for delaying a Malaga free-kick by tying his shoelaces in front of the ball and then charged into Roberto Rosales 25 minutes from time to see his second yellow card. ""I think the interpretation of the yellow cards is special,"" said Barcelona boss Luis Enrique after the game. ""We have to be very careful in some games because there were some ugly challenges from behind that went unpunished and tying boots was."" It is not the first time in recent weeks Neymar's attention to detail with his boots caught the eye. He changed his footwear whilst play was ongoing in Barca's two previous games against Granada and Sevilla, leaving his side temporarily down to 10 men. Neymar has a highly lucrative long-term sponsorship deal with Nike with suggestions his antics may be to ensure his boots get extra time on camera."
709,10/04/2017,01:32,Former Barca star Alves ready to stand up for Juve,"Dani Alves is known for standing up for his beliefs, and Juventus will expect nothing less from their ""champion"" right-back when they host his former club Barcelona in a must-win Champions League quarter-final.","A month after spectacularly overturning a 4-0 first-leg defeat to Paris Saint-Germain to prevail 6-5 on aggregate, Barcelona's Euro dream remains very much alive ahead of Tuesday's first leg in Turin. Even if, as Juve fans noted on Saturday with a fair amount of glee, the La Liga giants will lack their usual swagger following a shock 2-0 league reverse at Malaga in which Neymar suffered a rare sending-off. For Juve coach Massimiliano Allegri, who saw Alves get his hands on the 2015 trophy following a 3-1 defeat to Barcelona in the 2015 final, Saturday's defeat was a blip ""not worth taking into consideration"". ""For me, it's still the same Barcelona. When you have players like (Lionel) Messi, (Andres) Iniesta, (Luis) Suarez, and Neymar, you don't mess up games very often."" Allegri has called for a ""fearless approach"" as Juve look for a crucial first leg advantage, writing on Twitter: ""Calm, fearless and knowing what we're all about: coming next from Juve, a game that will leave all our fans in high spirits."" But when it comes to spooking the Spaniards, long-time Barca servant Alves would likely win hands-down. With a total of nine winners' medals, Alves became the second-most decorated player in European competition, behind retired AC Milan legend Paolo Maldini, during an impressive eight-season career at the Camp Nou. Before becoming the third-most expensive defender of all time when he joined Barcelona for 32.5m euros in 2008, Alves helped Sevilla to successive UEFA Cup wins in 2006 and 2007 and the UEFA Super Cup in 2006. With Barcelona, he added six La Liga titles, four Spanish Cups, three Champions Leagues, three UEFA Super Cups and three Club World Cups to his impressive haul. Although causing general surprise by joining Juventus last summer, Alves defiantly laid bare his true feelings only two months ago in Spanish newspaper ABC. Alves claimed he had been used as a pawn by a ""false and ungrateful"" board before he took revenge by signing a renewal with a clause that allowed him the ""classy stitch-up"" of leaving the club for free. ""I like to be where I am wanted, and if I am not wanted then I'll leave,"" Alves said. ""Leaving on a free (transfer) from Barcelona was a classy stitch-up. Over my last three seasons I always heard that Alves was leaving, although the directors never said anything to my face. ""They were very false and ungrateful. They didn't show me respect."" It is not the first time Alves, who famously picked up and ate a banana thrown at him by a Villarreal fan in 2014, has put his foot down with decision-makers. After a purported move to Liverpool in June 2006 fell through, Alves raged when Sevilla president Jose Maria del Nido refused an over-the-asking-price offer of 36m euros from Chelsea in 2007. ""In the four-and-a-half years I have been here I have given everything and I want more respect,"" said Alves. But just as Sevilla's loss was Barcelona's gain, Juventus are now reaping the benefits of a player still considered one of the best, offense-minded defenders of his generation. Despite breaking his leg in a shock 3-1 defeat at Genoa last November, Alves came off the bench to score a classy second for Juve in a 2-0 win over Porto last February. ""Alves is a champion, a guy with great drive and and enthusiasm who has won everything,"" gushed Allegri. ""Coming on for the last 20 minutes and doing what he did simply underlines his professionalism."" Incidentally, Alves's absence means he is likely to be one of just two changes from the Barca side that started the final against Juventus two years ago. With Sergio Busquets suspended, Javier Mascherano is expected to get a rare outing in the holding midfield role he was more accustomed to before joining Barca in 2010. Enrique will welcome both Gerard Pique and Ivan Rakitic back following suspension from the defeat at Malaga, while captain Andres Iniesta will also start after being left on the bench at the weekend."
710,09/04/2017,00:09,"Barca loss means nothing, says Allegri",Massimiliano Allegri played down the importance of Barcelona's shock league defeat at Malaga on Saturday as Juventus prepare to meet the La Liga giants for the first time since losing the 2015 Champions League final.,"Juventus host Luis Enrique's men in Turin on Tuesday in what is the sides' first meeting since the Catalans humbled Allegri's men 3-1 in Berlin two years ago. The Italians have improved since then and, having began this season's competition among the title favourites, head into Tuesday's quarter-final confident of at least earning a first-leg victory. But any psychological boost offered by 10-man Barcelona's shock 2-0 defeat in Malaga was rejected by Allegri, who expects Barca to be back to their clinical best. ""It's not worth taking into consideration, because Barcelona are used to playing these games (in Europe),"" Allegri told Premium Sport. ""For me, it's the same Barcelona. When you have players like (Lionel) Messi, (Andres) Iniesta, (Luis) Suarez, and Neymar, you don't mess up games very often."" Juventus warmed up for Tuesday's clash with a cagey 2-0 win over Chievo, Gonzalo Higuain hitting his second brace in as many outings to see Allegri's men go nine points clear of Roma, in second, ahead of their trip to Bologna on Sunday. But in a match that saw Juve playmaker Paulo Dybala sparkle, Juve missed chance after chance in front of goal. ""It was a difficult game, but we knew it would be like that. Chievo are a tough side, but we've got the three points,"" said Higuain, who could have added to his 23rd and 84th minute strikes only to fire inches wide of the upright late in the second half. For Allegri, an ugly win is still worth three points and he said Juve ""better be ready"" to make Barca's next away trip one to forget as well. ""We better be ready, because it's a quarter-final. We respect Barcelona but we go into this game knowing we have a great chance to make the next round,"" he added. """"We have to make it tough for them. When we get a chance to attack, we will, and when we have to defend we'll do that as well. It's simply a case of working hard."" Higuain, who set a 36-goal record in Serie A while with Napoli last season, took his Serie A tally for the season to 21 in 32 games. The former Real Madrid striker added: ""Now, we'll start thinking about Barcelona, and of recovering so we're in top condition. ""We're relaxed, it will be a hard game against a really great side but, just as we respect them, they'll also have respect for us."""
711,08/04/2017,22:53,Neymar sees red as Barca let Real Madrid off hook,Neymar was sent-off as Barcelona lost further ground on Real Madrid at the top of La Liga in a shock 2-0 defeat to Malaga on Saturday.,"Real are now three points clear and have a game in hand despite Antoine Griezmann's classy finish five minutes from time snatching a 1-1 draw for Atletico Madrid earlier at the Santiago Bernabeu. Neymar picked up the first red card of his Barcelona career for two bookable offences as the Catalans were left to rue letting Sandro Ramirez join Malaga for free last summer. Sandro exposed some awful defending from Jeremy Mathieu to sprint clear on goal and slot past Marc-Andre ter Stegen at his near post. Malaga also had the better chances of the second-half filled with controversy as Juanpi shot straight at Ter Stegen when clean through. Neymar had been shown his first booking for delaying a Malaga free-kick whilst tying his shoelaces and stupidly charged into Diego Llorente 25 minutes from time to see red. The hosts then had a goal wrongly ruled out for offside when substitute Adalberto Penaranda finished off a flowing counter-attack. However, Barca were also infuriated with referee Gil Manzano when he somehow awarded a free-kick on the edge of the box when Sergi Roberto had been brought down clearly inside the area. Malaga finally picked off the 10 men in the final minute when Pablo Fornals unselfishly squared for Jony to smash home from close range. Barca's defeat meant Real's disappointment earlier in the day was short lived. Pepe's towering header early in the second half looked to have Real heading five points clear at the top in the Madrid derby. However, Griezmann rounded Keylor Navas to slot home at the near post five minutes from time. ""It is a draw but we've lost two points. Clearly we deserved all three points today,"" said Madrid boss Zinedine Zidane. ""We played very well, but we lacked the second goal that would have allowed us to relax."" After a slow start, Real took control of the game as the first half wore on and only two stunning stops prevented Zidane's men from taking a half-time lead. Firstly, Jan Oblak tipped over Karim Benzema's effort after a neat one-two with Ronaldo had freed the Frenchman inside the box. Moments later Cristiano Ronaldo couldn't believe his eyes when his fierce goal-bound effort was turned to safety by Stefan Savic's incredible headed clearance from under his own crossbar. Real started the second half with intent as Ronaldo headed just wide before Oblak had to rush from his goal to block Benzema's volley from point-blank range. The European champions finally made the breakthrough seven minutes into the second period when Pepe rose highest in a crowded penalty area from Toni Kroos's free-kick to power a header into the far corner. However, Atletico responded to falling behind and should have been level on the hour mark when Yannick Carrasco played in Fernando Torres clear on goal. The former Spanish international failed to finish, though, as he fired straight at the onrushing Navas. Navas has faced a barrage of criticsm this season, but he made another smart stop to deny Griezmann levelling with an outrageous overhead kick attempt. The French international wasn't to be denied from an excellent through ball from Angel Correa with five minutes remaining, however, as he coolly fired past the advancing Navas at the near post for his 23rd goal of the season. ""We know we are a strong team with an incredible mentality,"" Griezmann told Spanish TV station Movistar. ""I could see my teammates had confidence, desire and the truth is we played a great game."""
712,07/04/2017,17:45,Allegri to reshuffle for Chievo as Juve await Barca,Mario Mandzukic is set to be rested but treble-chasing Juventus were warned to focus on Chievo despite the looming visit of Barcelona in the first leg of their Champions League quarter-final.,"Croatia international Mandzukic trained apart from the rest of Juve's squad this week as he recovers from an injury niggle, and with compatriot Mark Pjaca sidelined due to a serious knee injury, coach Massimiliano Allegri is set to reshuffle the pack. Allegri has mostly deployed a 4-3-1-2 formation this season that has seen Argentine playmaker Paulo Dybala sit in behind a front pairing of Mandzukic and Gonzalo Higuain. But that will change. ""Mandzukic remains a major doubt,"" Allegri told media in Turin on Friday. ""And I don't think we can afford to rest Higuain, even if putting Dybala into the striker's role could be a good idea. ""Paulo is a player who gets better the more he plays, so he needs to play."" Allegri needs to find the right balance between securing three points against Chievo and keeping legs, and minds, fresh for Tuesday. Juventus are keen to take revenge on the side that beat them in the 2015 Champions League final but Allegri said the Turin giants would keep their eye on one challenge at a time. ""We'll start focusing on Barcelona tomorrow night, although it is such a beautiful and fascinating challenge that it almost prepares itself,"" he said. A positive result against Barcelona on Tuesday would keep Juve in contention for a treble of trophies -- last achieved in Italy by Inter Milan in 2010. Days after a 1-1 league draw at Napoli last weekend, Juventus succumbed to a 3-2 Cup semi-final defeat in midweek on their second visit to the San Paolo stadium within a few days, yet still progressed to the final 5-4 on aggregate. They look a good bet at least for a domestic double but a record sixth consecutive 'scudetto' hasn't been sewn up yet. Juve's lead on closest challengers Roma was cut to six points last week, and with eight games remaining Allegri does not want to take any chances. ""We already dropped points in Naples, so we can't lose any more tomorrow,"" he said. ""We've come off two difficult games that took their toll both mentally and physically, so we can't afford to switch off. ""Roma can still reach 92 points, so we have to make it 93. There are still a lot of matches to be won yet."""

""Rafinha has had an arthroscopy in the right knee to solve an injury in the internal meniscus,"" Barca said in a statement. ""The estimated time out is four months."" Rafinha had to be replaced after just 17 minutes of Barca's 4-1 win at Granada on Sunday. The 24-year-old had become a key player in Barca boss Luis Enrique's switch to a 3-4-3 formation following a 4-0 thrashing by Paris Saint-Germain in the first leg of their Champions League last 16 tie in February. He scored seven goals in 28 appearances in all competitions this season.

And using the principles of kinesiology -- muscle monitoring to access information about a person's well being -- he has also helped the five-time Ballon d'Or winner shake off the niggling muscle issues that had increasingly plagued him in recent seasons. Although the 29-year-old Argentine ""struggled to adapt"" at first, after regular visits to the clinic in Venice he is now reaping the benefits, says Poser. ""I think he even cried tears of frustration,"" Poser told Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera on Friday. ""But he's now accepted it. There is no unique formula in kinesiology, but through testing we can see how food intake affects each and every muscle in the body."" Poser says he introduced major changes to Messi's diet, bringing in organic and seasonal foods. Those were just the final touches to a ""completely new lifestyle"", he claims. ""It's not just a case of changing diet,"" said Poser, who has also worked with footballers from Serie A sides Udinese and Palermo during a 30-year career. ""We live in a time in which foods contain too many contaminants and that can be seen in energy levels when measuring resistance and recovery. ""You don't become a professional player, and even less a phenomenon like Messi, just for the things you eat. ""Messi can still be Messi.

Messi began seeing Poser over two years ago, although it has taken time for him to benefit. In April last year Messi endured a noticeable rough patch, going five games without scoring -- a long stretch by his sky-high standards. What was supposed to be his final visit to Poser's clinic last week comes days before Barcelona face Juventus in Turin for the first leg of their Champions League quarter-final on Tuesday. Poser, however, can't give the Italian champions inside information on Messi. ""I don't know what kind of relationship we managed to develop because neither of us could speak the language of the other,"" he said. ""But he's a wonderful lad who is very humble.

716,05/04/2017,22:37,Messi shouldn't suffer Argentina burden - Sampaoli,Sevilla boss Jorge Sampaoli says that compatriot Lionel Messi should be the pride of Argentina rather than criticised for his failure to deliver a major trophy.,"Messi was in top form on his return from suspension and scored twice as Barcelona extended Sevilla's slump in a 3-0 win on Wednesday. But while he is a hero at the Camp Nou, Messi has not always had the same adulation in his homeland. ""There is a necessity for some people to win something solely thanks to Leo,"" said Sampaoli, who has been linked with taking over as Argentina boss for the rest of their faltering World Cup qualifying campaign. ""That seems like too much of a burden to me for a player who has given everything and who makes all of Argentina proud that he is the best in the world."" Messi was handed a four-match international ban for insulting an assistant referee in a 1-0 win over Chile on March 24. Without the five-time World Player of the Year, Argentina then lost 2-0 to Bolivia to fall to fifth in South American World Cup qualifying with only the top four guaranteed their places in Russia next year. Widespread reports in Argentina over the weekend claimed that Sampaoli would be the leading candidate for the job if coach Edgardo Bauza is sacked before the two-time world champions' next qualifier, away to Uruguay on August 31. Messi has been a beaten finalist three times with Argentina, at the 2014 World Cup and the 2015 and 2016 Copa America. After missing a penalty in a shootout defeat to Chile in 2016 he briefly announced his retirement from international football before reversing that decision two months later."

""If I am leaving Barca, which is my home, and with a great relationship with the club, my players and more, it is not to go to another team,"" Enrique said on Tuesday on the eve of his side's clash with Sevilla. ""I have been clear that it is simply due to fatigue and the need to rest. Where am I going to go that is better than here?"" Manchester City manager Guardiola also took a year out following his glorious four-year spell in charge between 2008 and 2012 citing fatigue before taking over at Bayern Munich. Both Enrique and Guardiola also started their coaching careers at Barca B and won the treble in their first season in charge with the senior side, but Enrique was less successful than his former teammate in one-season spells at Roma and Celta Vigo. Enrique's route to a second treble is a difficult one as Barca trail Real Madrid by two points, who also have a game in hand, in the La Liga title race and face Juventus in the Champions League quarter-finals this month.

However, since then Sevilla have been knocked out of the Champions League by Leicester City and tumbled out of contention for the La Liga title with Atletico Madrid passing them into third place. Sampaoli's future at the Sanchez Pizjuan is far from clear with long-term sporting director Monchi's decision to leave last week adding further uncertainty. What does seem obvious, though, is that Sampaoli would jump at the chance to coach compatriot Lionel Messi and Barca's host of other stars next season. ""I want to manage Messi to be able to watch him from the sideline every day."" Sampaoli told Argentine newspaper Ole last week. ""It is a unique dream to be able to see the best in the world up close."" Sampaoli may get his wish to coach Messi, albeit not on a daily basis with the Argentine Football Association reportedly set to offer him the chance to salvage their faltering World Cup qualifying campaign. Barca, meanwhile, look set to go in another direction with Athletic Bilbao coach Ernesto Valverde and Enrique's assistant Juan Carlos Unzue emerging as the favourites to take over next season. Wednesday's clash gives Sampaoli one last chance to impress the Barca hierarchy, whilst the Sevilla squad are focused on booking their place in next season's Champions League without needing to win a trick August qualifier by beating out Atletico for third place. ""It is difficult for us to accept right now, but we have to turn it around because we are the same team as five games ago when we were second,"" said striker Stefan Jovetic after a frustrating 0-0 draw at home to third bottom Sporting Gijon on Saturday. Unfortunately for Sevilla, though, Messi is back after missing his last two games for club and country through suspension. ""It is very difficult for a team with Leo playing well to lose,"" added Sampaoli. The five-time World Player of the Year's absence didn't prove a fatal blow to Barca's title hopes as Luis Suarez and Neymar both scored in Sunday's 4-1 win at Granada to remain just two points behind La Liga leaders Real Madrid. All three are set to be reunited, whilst Gerard Pique and Andres Iniesta also return for Barca after being rested from the start against Granada.

Turan turned out for Turkey in their 2-0 World Cup qualifying victory over Finland on Friday, but will have to sit out the friendly against Moldova on Monday.

""The club considers the four-match suspension imposed on the Argentine player to be unfair and totally disproportionate. ""Finally, FC Barcelona wishes to reiterate its support for Leo Messi, an exemplary player in terms of conduct, both on and off the pitch."" FIFA suspended Messi for four of Argentina's five remaining World Cup qualification matches after he was caught swearing at an official in the victory over Chile last week. The FIFA announcement fell just hours before Messi was due to captain Argentina against Bolivia late Tuesday. Argentina went on to lose 2-0 to the Bolivians to deal a fresh blow to their 2018 World Cup qualification campaign. Messi will also miss Argentina's qualifiers in Uruguay on August 31, at home to Venezuela on September 5 and against Peru on October 5."

""It is an honour for me to say the name of the stadium we are building at the training ground will no longer be the Miniestadi, but from now on will be the Johan Cruyff stadium,"" said Bartomeu. ""The club will also launch the creation of a commemorative statue in honour of Johan Cruyff which will be placed at the future Camp Nou."" Major redevelopment work at the Camp Nou is due to start in 2018. However, Barca have reserved the naming rights on the stadium for a major sponsorship deal to cover the estimated 420 million euros ($453 million) cost of the project. As part of the redevelopment, the Miniestadi, where Barcelona B currently play just metres away from the Camp Nou, will make way to a new arena for the Barca basketball team and increased commercial space. Barca B's new home stadium will be at the club's training ground on the western outskirts of the city. Jordi Cruyff also announced the family will donate a Barcelona shirt worn by his father and his Ballon d'Or trophy from the 1973/1974 season to a new Cruyff exhibition at the Barcelona museum. ""It is an agreement by which my father will always be present at the club that he loved,"" said Jordi Cruyff. Johan Cruyff was one of Barcelona's greatest ever players and coaches, winning 13 trophies in all including the club's first ever European Cup as coach in 1992."
726,19/03/2017,18:45,"Allegri plays down Dybala knock, looks to Barca",Massimiliano Allegri played down injury concerns over Juventus playmaker Paulo Dybala ahead of next month's Champions League clash with Barcelona after he was forced off early in Sunday's 1-0 win at Sampdoria.,"""He felt his flexor muscle tighten at the back (of his leg),"" Allegri told Sky Sport Italia. ""We've been watching it for the past few days, but it shouldn't be a concern."" Dybala has come into a rich vein of form for the Italian champions of late as they look to stay in contention for an ambitious treble of trophies in what could be another record-setting season. The Argentinian coolly beat Iker Casillas from the spot to secure a 1-0 last 16, second leg win over Porto on Tuesday that sealed a 3-0 Champions League aggregate win over the Portuguese. He also hit a late, controversial winner from the spot to seal a 2-1 win over AC Milan last week that put the Turin giants within sight of a record sixth consecutive Serie A title. But Dybala lasted less than half an hour on Sunday when he sat down on the pitch in pain before signalling his injury to the bench. He was replaced by Mark Pjaca, who was one of several Juve players to miss the target as the visitors held on to Juan Cuadrado's seventh-minute header to claim a 24th victory of the campaign. Napoli, 3-2 winners at Empoli, sit second at 10 points adrift although Roma can reclaim second spot and restore their eight-point deficit with a win later at home to Sassuolo. Next month's Champions League quarter-final match-up will see Juventus meet Barcelona for the first time since losing the 2015 final 3-1 to the La Liga giants in Berlin. Bu Allegri said the Italians should have nothing to fear. ""Facing teams like these should be the norm for a club like Juventus, and whether you go through or not, all the teams have to respect each other. I think we're doing that,"" he said. ""We will face Barcelona knowing that we can either exit or go through, but we'll do so on equal terms."""
727,18/03/2017,14:11,Difficult to rest Messi - Luis Enrique,"Barcelona boss Luis Enrique suggested Lionel Messi will have to be rested for some of an April packed with huge clashes, but that even the Catalan giants would struggle without the ""best player in the world"".","Messi has started every Barca game in 2017 and will do so once more when Valencia visit the Camp Nou on Sunday. However, the Spanish champions face 10 games in April after a two-week international break, including a two-legged Champions League quarter-final against Juventus and crucial La Liga clashes against Sevilla and Real Madrid. ""To do without the best player in the world is difficult, but we have thought about resting him,"" said Enrique on Saturday. Barca trail Madrid at the top of La Liga by two points, but have also played a game more than their eternal rivals. ""La Liga will be decided in the last few games. The most decisive part of the calendar is still to come,"" added Enrique. ""It is a brutal schedule for those us in European competition and those at the bottom are going to fight too."" Barca's route to a potential second treble in three seasons under Enrique before he leaves at the end of the campaign wasn't made any easier by a pairing with Juventus in Friday's Champions League draw. Enrique's men beat the Italian champions 3-1 in the final two years ago to complete the treble. And despite a significant turnover in personnel for Juventus in the intervening two years, he expects a ""frightening"" challenge. ""We have the final in Berlin fresh in our minds. ""They have changed players, but they are a difficult and frightening opponent of the standard you expect in the quarter-finals of the Champions League."" Off the field, tying down Messi's long-term future remains Barca's priority with just over a year to run on the Argentine's contract. However, club captain Andres Iniesta's deal is also due to run out in 2018. Iniesta said this week his intention was to sign a new deal but that he wouldn't hang around if his role within the squad deteriorated. And Enrique hopes Iniesta, 32, decides to stay rather than following former teammate Xavi Hernandez's example in playing out his twilight years in Qatar. ""There are two options when you get to the last few years,"" added Enrique. ""One is to stay with the club you always have been with, which is what I want. The other is to go like Xavi, which I also understand."""
728,14/03/2017,21:17,PSG condemn Barca collapse ref in letter to UEFA,"Paris Saint-Germain have sent a letter of complaint to UEFA about the referee who oversaw their spectacular collapse to Barcelona, accusing him of ruining their Champions League campaign.","The Spanish champions' historic win was overshadowed by a series of controversial calls from German referee Deniz Aytekin and he awarded them two penalties on the way to a 6-1 hammering last week to surge into the quarter-finals. A source with knowledge of the letter confirmed Tuesday media reports about the dossier sent to UEFA president Aleksander Ceferin; UEFA said that it had received a letter from PSG, giving no details of its content. The source told AFP that the letter was designed to ""point out a series of errors"" and ""errors of judgement"" by Aytekin. Under-pressure PSG coach Unai Emery said in the aftermath of Barcelona's miracle revival from a 4-0 first-leg deficit: ""We had chances to make it 3-2 and then the refereeing decisions, I don't know if they were right or not, but for sure they damaged us."" PSG president Nasser Al-Khelaifi was less forgiving. ""The outcome of the match could have been different with more clear-sighted officiating,"" he told Le Parisien newspaper at the weekend. ""Everyone saw that Angel Di Maria should have had a penalty that would have made the score 2-3 and kill any suspense. Not to mention that there was no penalty on (Luis) Suarez late in the game (which was awarded)."""

""Just because you win one game doesn't solve the problems of a season, nor does losing one mean all is lost,"" Suarez told BeIN Sports Spain. Barca boss Luis Enrique accepted it had been ""difficult"" for his side to lift themselves from the tiredness and euphoria of pulling off the biggest comeback in Champions League history from a 4-0 first-leg deficit. However, despite missing the injured Neymar, Suarez claimed Barca had enough recovery time to put in a better performance than they showed at Riazor. ""There was enough time to recover and we were aware that the league game was coming,"" added the Uruguayan. Barca now lead Real Madrid at the top of La Liga by just a point having played two games more. Madrid can move top later on Sunday with victory at home to Real Betis. And Enrique claimed it will take a ""very strong"" end to the season in Barca's remaining 11 league games to deliver a third consecutive title. ""Now we have to think that we still have matches against our rivals for the title to come,"" said Enrique. ""We are going to have to have a very strong end to the season to be able to opt for trophies."""

However, the Brazilian missed training on Saturday due to a left abductor strain and hasn't been included in Luis Enrique's 18-man squad. Neymar was pictured celebrating Barca's comeback along with three-time Formula One world champion Lewis Hamilton into the early hours of Thursday morning. Luis Enrique, though, insisted he is confident his side won't suffer a hangover at Deportivo with the Spanish title race on a knife-edge. ""I have trust in the experience of my players to know that we have a lot at stake,"" said Luis Enrique on Saturday. Barca lead Real Madrid at the top of the table by a point, but Madrid have a game in hand. Wednesday's exploits have raised hopes Barca can claim a second treble in three seasons as they are heavy favourites for the Copa del Rey final against Alaves. However, Enrique, who will leave the club at the end of the season, tried to temper expectations. ""We are aware that everything is still to be decided,"" he added. ""There are eight teams left in the Champions League, three competing for La Liga and two in the Cup. ""That means we can win zero, one, two or three titles. Right now we can only concentrate on Deportivo."" Midfielder Rafinha also misses out for Barca due to gastroenteritis."

The match is part of the International Champions Cup, the annual global exhibition series which features clubs from Europe and around the world. It is the first time Barcelona and Real Madrid have met in North America, organizers said.

732,10/03/2017,01:33,Neymar steps out of Messi's shadow to fuel treble talk,"For a victory ""defined by faith"" according to Barcelona boss Luis Enrique, the Catalans rose from the dead inspired by the man who never stopped believing.","""As long as there's a one percent chance, we'll have 99 percent faith,"" said Neymar before a ball had been kicked in Barca's stunning revival from a 4-0 first leg deficit to beat Paris Saint-Germain 6-1. A few hours, two goals and a vital 95th minute assist for Sergi Roberto to cap the biggest comeback in the history of the Champions League later, Neymar hailed his display as the ""best game"" of his career. ""This is the best game I have ever played. For what it meant, for what we experienced,"" said the 25-year-old. Neymar hasn't always had the easiest time since swapping Santos for Spain three-and-a-half years ago. The murky series of contracts that sealed his transfer have seen Neymar, his father and Barcelona dragged through the courts on corruption and tax evasion charges. Yet, it is for nights like Wednesday that Barca paid millions to recruit and then renew Neymar's contract till 2021 in October. Pre-match focus had framed the seemingly impossible comeback only realistic if Lionel Messi made it happen. Instead, three times in a frantic final seven minutes, it was Neymar, not Messi, that took responsiblity and dragged Barca back from the brink into a record 10th consecutive quarter-final. Firstly, he curled home a brilliant free-kick and then took over penalty duty, despite Messi having earlier converted from the spot, to leave Barca needing just one more. Amid the bedlam of nearly 100,000 voices at the Camp Nou, Neymar then calmly cut inside with Barca's last chance as the seconds ticked down to tease in the perfect cross on his weaker left foot for Sergi Roberto to apply the finishing touch. ""Not even in our wildest dreams could we dreamed the way it happened,"" Neymar posted on Instagram alongside a celebratory photo of he and Messi. ""The impossible is just a matter of opinion."" Messi and Real Madrid rival Cristiano Ronaldo have ruled the roost as the world's two best players since 2008 - sharing nine straight Ballon d'Or wins. However, Neymar's display on the biggest stage left many in little doubt he is the heir to their crown in the future. ""A night worthy of the Ballon d'Or,"" said Spanish sports daily Marca. ""With his speed, skill and powerful strike, PSG folded up against the best version of the Brazilian."" Neymar is used to carrying the biggest burdens. He took Brazil to the semi-finals of the World Cup on home soil in 2014 before his back was broken towards the end of a bruising quarter-final clash with Colombia. Some measure of revenge for that blow was taken by scoring the winning penalty as the hosts claimed a first Olympic gold at the Rio Games in August. Rather than be cowed, Neymar is inspired by the biggest moments when his side need him most. And he could be the key with a suddenly revitalised Barcelona eyeing a second treble of Champions League, La Liga and Copa del Rey in three seasons. ""We believed before and now even more (so),"" added Neymar. After partying into the early hours of Thursday morning with three-time Formula One world champion Lewis Hamilton, Barca and Neymar travel to Deportivo la Coruna on Sunday looking to avoid a hangover. ""It wouldn't be a bad thing if Barca went out partying,"" hopeful Deportivo boss Pepe Mel told radio station Onda Cero with his side sitting just five points above the relegation zone."

Barcelona were ahead after just three minutes when Luis Suarez headed in past goalkeeper Kevin Trapp from close range. It was 2-0 five minutes from half-time when PSG defender Layvin Kurzawa prodded the ball into his own net after Andres Iniesta had found the key pass with a clever backheel. Lionel Messi made it 3-0 from the penalty spot just minutes into the second half after Neymar was fouled as Barcelona appeared poised to complete their unlikely comeback. PSG's Uruguayan striker Edinson Cavani silenced the Camp Nou with a powerful right-foot drive just after the hour mark. But two goals from Neymar in three minutes -- one from a penalty -- brought the Spanish giants level before Roberto stabbed the winner in from close range.

""You have become legends,"" headlined the Barcelona Sport daily while El Munda spoke of the 'miracle of a lifetime.' Neymar presided over a final seven minutes that plunged PSG into a waking nightmare. He scored an 88th-minute free kick and a penalty in the 91st before setting up Sergi Roberto's clincher in the fifth minute of injury time, sealing the 6-1 win. The result sent the Spanish giants storming into the quarter-finals and left PSG in tatters. ""I know that we have made history. A team like this can do anything,"" Neymar told BeIN Sports. Germany's football bible, Kicker, spoke of a ""night of magic"" while Bild said simply ""Barcelona move mountains..."" The French press scrambled to find words harsh enough to describe PSG's shame. ""Crushed, trampled on, humiliated,"" said Le Figaro newspaper while L'Equipe sports daily said ""Indescribable."" The win recalled Manchester United's injury-time double to win the 1999 title against Bayern Munich in the same stadium, and Liverpool's victory in the 2005 final after being 3-0 down to AC Milan at half-time. ""It is a difficult night to explain with words,"" said Barca boss Luis Enrique, who will leave the club at the end of the season. ""It was a horror movie, not a drama, with a Camp Nou that I have seen very few times as a player or coach. ""What defines this victory is the faith that the players and fans had."" The defeat raised questions over the future of PSG coach Unai Emery, as club president Nasser Al-Khelaifi ominously called it ""very hard to accept"". ""This is a nightmare for everybody. Is Unai Emery still credible? This is not the moment to talk of this. After the game, we are all upset,"" said the Qatari. And PSG defender Thiago Motta's night went from bad to worse after he hit a supporter with his sportscar after flying back home early Thursday. Around 30 supporters were waiting for the players as they emerged from Le Bourget airport outside Paris. In chaotic scenes, Italian international Motta's car accelerated as supporters and photographers obstructed the road. One man banged on the vehicle and was struck by the car. He was taken to hospital but his injuries were minor, police told AFP. Emery admitted his team went to pieces in the final minutes, but said they were badly affected by the two second-half penalties given by German referee Deniz Aytekin. ""In the second-half it changed. The (Messi) penalty got them off to a great start, but I was already calmer because I could see the team was responding better, were better positioned on the pitch and could do damage,"" said the Spanish coach. ""We had chances to make it 3-2 and then the refereeing decisions, I don't know if they were right or not, but for sure they damaged us. Then in the last two minutes we lost everything we had recovered in the second-half."" Despite Luis Suarez's early opener, a Layvin Kurzawa own goal and Lionel Messi's penalty, Barca looked down and out when Edinson Cavani volleyed home what seemed to be the vital away goal for PSG. However, Neymar restored Barca's belief as he firstly fired home a sensational free-kick two minutes from time and then converted from the penalty spot. And substitute midfielder Roberto became the unlikely hero when he stretched to turn home Neymar's sublime chip over the defence, leaving the score 6-5 on aggregate as the crowd dissolved into ecstasy. ""I threw myself at it with everything,"" Roberto told BeIN Sports. ""We left Paris very down and now this is incredible. ""We were prepared for all this. The fans were like 10 extra players and in the end this is all for them."" Midfielder Ivan Rakitic said Barca had defied the critics after their first-leg humiliation in Paris three weeks ago. ""It's crazy. After Paris, many people spoke hard about our team but tonight was special, we made history,"" the Croatian told BT Sport. ""We know we are the best team in the world."" As well as staying on course for a sixth title, the 1992, 2006, 2009, 2011 and 2015 European champions set a new record by reaching their 10th straight quarter-final. Barcelona defender Gerard Pique, husband of Colombian pop star Shakira, predicted exuberant celebrations among the team's fans.

But on Wednesday night, in front of almost 100,000 people at the Nou Camp, PSG shipped three late goals in an incredible last seven minutes as Barcelona completed the greatest comeback in the history of the tournament, winning 6-5 on aggregate. ""When you win 4-0, then lose 6-1, it's very hard to accept,"" said PSG president Nasser Al-Khelaifi, the Qatari official whose country has poured millions of dollars into the French club.

""It is the entire PSG project that is threatened by this humiliation,"" it said. Emery, meanwhile, said PSG were damaged by German referee Deniz Aytekin's decisions to award two penalties to Barcelona -- both in the second half. Lionel Messi converted the first penalty on 50 minutes to make it 3-0, before PSG's Edinson Cavani scored what looked like a crucial away goal. But Neymar, after scoring an 88th-minute free kick, tucked away the second penalty in the 91st minute before Sergi Roberto got the vital goal in the fifth minute of injury time. ""The truth is we have let a huge opportunity get away and we are aware of that. In the first half it was more our fault than them playing well,"" said Spanish coach Emery.

In the last few minutes they played all or nothing and they have beaten us."" PSG's Belgian defender Thomas Meunier blasted his team-mates for allowing Barcelona to bully them. ""At 5-1 down, we were qualifying but we conceded a goal that we should not have conceded,"" he said. ""We acquiesced, we were victims and let them dominate us. ""Even when were 3-1 down we had lots of chances to score but we didn't take them. We made unacceptable mistakes and handed the game to them."""

Just when Barca looked down and out, trailing 5-3 on aggregate, Brazilian star Neymar restored hope when he curled home a sensational free-kick high into the top corner. And as the match entered stoppage time, Barca were awarded a second controversial penalty by the referee when Luis Suarez tumbled under a challenge form Marquinhos. Neymar sent goalkeeper Kevin Trapp the wrong way. The Brazilian then showed a cool head in the fifth minute of injury time when he cut inside before chipping into the box for substitute Sergi Roberto to extend his right leg just enough to beat Trapp and leave PSG floored. ""The truth is we have let a huge opportunity get away and we are aware of that. In the first-half it was more our fault than them playing well,"" said Spanish coach Emery whose side trailed 2-0 at the break. ""In the second-half it changed.

""We have nothing to lose and a lot to win."" The fierce criticism that came Enrique's way after their humiliation in Paris three weeks ago has eased after he announced last week that he will step down after three seasons as coach at the end of the campaign. Rather than show any ill-effects from Enrique's decision, optimism in the Catalan capital of a stunning fightback has soared after thrashing Sporting Gijon and Celta Vigo 6-1 and 5-0 respectively in their last two outings. ""Despite the fact that the result from the first leg is very one-sided, we are only halfway through the tie,"" added an uncharacteristically buoyant Enrique. ""In 95 minutes, an infinite amount of things can happen. ""I am convinced that at some point we will be close to qualifying. ""That isn't to say we will do it, but that we will be close. And, when you are close, our confidence will soar and theirs could start to diminish."" No team in the history of the Champions League has ever turned around a four-goal deficit. However, the statistics back up Enrique's confidence. The results from more than a third of his home games as Barca coach would be good enough to at least force the game to extra time. That record includes all three of Barca's Champions League games this season as they dismantled Celtic (7-0), Manchester City (4-0) and Borussia Moenchengladbach (4-0) by a combined score of 15-0. Luis Suarez was also bullish as he claimed if there is one team capable of mounting a historic comeback it is Barcelona. ""We are aware that it is a difficult situation to turn the tie around, but in football nothing is impossible,"" said Suarez. ""We have to be convinced that we can do it. If there is a team that can score four goals, I think it is Barcelona but with our philosophy of how to play and controlling the game."" However, the Uruguayan striker pleaded for patience from an expectant near 100,000 fans at the Camp Nou. An away goal for PSG would mean Barca would have to score at least six to have any chance of reaching the quarter-finals for a 10th straight season. ""We are aware that the game lasts 94 or 95 minutes and we have to be ambitious but also patient. ""We hope that the fans understand and we are the first ones that want to make history, but we have to play with a cool head."" Barca are at full-strength with captain Andres Iniesta replacing Rafinha or Ivan Rakitic likely to be the Enrique's only change from the side that thrashed Celta at the weekend."
741,07/03/2017,02:12,Barcelona believe in PSG 'miracle' mission,"Three weeks on from suffering a 4-0 humiliation at the hands of Paris Saint-Germain, Barcelona still believe that a Champions League ""miracle"" is possible at the Camp Nou on Wednesday.","Since that fateful night in Paris, Barcelona have regained both leadership of La Liga and their confidence ahead of the last 16, second leg. And despite the news that Luis Enrique will no longer be their coach next season, Barca showed no negative effects as Lionel Messi led a 5-0 destruction of Celta Vigo on Saturday in arguably the club's best performance of the season. ""Hopefully we can produce a miracle,"" said midfielder Ivan Rakitic. No side has ever overturned a 4-0 deficit in the knock-out stages of the Champions League. ""Evidently, it is very difficult, we are not stupid,"" accepted Enrique. Yet, by announcing his decision to go at the end of the season, Enrique has calmed the waters that raged as Barca were torn apart by a faster, more determined and precise PSG, who enjoyed the glorious European night they had long waited for since Qatar Sports Investments starting pumping millions into the club six years ago. Not everyone believes the tie is over, though. ""My advice to you, knowing Luis and the players a little, is not to talk too much, because they will be back and prove you wrong,"" former Barca and now Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola had said about the first leg. At the time very few, even in Barcelona, believed that. Now, 21 days on, they very much do. Enrique spoke on Friday of the ""relief"" at ending speculation over his future. And in following up a 6-1 thrashing of Sporting Gijon with the dismantling of Celta at the weekend, Barca had the air of a team with a weight removed. ""If the stars align we can turn that game around,"" Enrique added as he announced his decision last week. ""With this team you have to always believe,"" said Barca sporting director Robert Fernandez. ""We have a hugely difficult result against us against a magnificent team, but in football anything can happen."" If there is one side in world football with the firepower to dream it is Barcelona. On top of Messi, Neymar has come back into goalscoring form in the past week, whilst Luis Suarez already has 26 goals this season. Indeed, the results from over a third of Enrique's home games as Barca coach would be good enough to at least force the game to extra time. That record includes all three of Barca's Champions League games this season as they dismantled Celtic (7-0), Manchester City (4-0) and Borussia Moenchengladbach (4-0) by a combined score of 15-0. Meanwhile, Suarez is seeking inspiration from one of the best displays of the Enrique era as last season Barca thrashed eternal rivals Real Madrid 4-0 at the Santiago Bernabeu with Messi only available for the last half hour on his return from injury. ""If we were capable of scoring four goals against Madrid at the Bernabeu, why can't we score four against Paris at the Camp Nou,"" the Uruguayan told Spanish radio station Onda Cero. ""If we score two then they can begin to get nervous that we can pull it off because we know we are capable of it."""

But the Catalan giants go into the game buoyed by thumping 6-1 and 5-0 wins in their past two league matches and haven't given up hope of staging an unprecedented comeback. No side has lost 4-0 away from home in Europe and gone through in a two-legged tie, but with Barca's prolific front three of Neymar, Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez they cannot be entirely discounted. ""Against PSG we will run and fight and then we will see what happens,"" said Neymar. ""It's really important that our spirit is on the way up and our confidence too. I see us on the up and with confidence. On Wednesday we are going to play really well."" Barca knocked PSG out at the quarter-final stage in both 2012-13 and 2014-15, but the reigning French champions have the upper hand this time and January signing Julian Draxler is confident of reaching the last eight for the fifth year in succession. ""Many teams have lost 5-0 at the Camp Nou, we know that anything is possible,"" Draxler told PSG's club website. ""But deep down I'm convinced we'll qualify for the quarter-finals. ""I think it will be important to attack and not just think about defending."" Bayern Munich have one foot in the next round after thrashing Arsenal 5-1 at the Allianz Arena and look set to eliminate the Gunners in the last 16 for the third time in the past five seasons. ""We have a big advantage, but Arsenal are dangerous, so we have to go full throttle to win,"" said Spain international Javi Martinez, who netted his first goal of the season in Saturday's 3-0 victory at Cologne. Philipp Lahm will miss the game through suspension, but the Bayern skipper said his team-mates would aim to extinguish any lingering hopes Arsene Wenger's men have right from kick-off in London. ""We have to be highly focused and, most importantly, show Arsenal in the first quarter-hour they can forget the next round,"" Lahm said ahead of Tuesday's clash, with the Premier League side staring at a seventh straight last-16 exit. Holders Real Madrid head to Napoli as clear favourites after a 3-1 win in the Spanish capital, but such an advantage has not always proved a guarantee of success for the record 11-time champions. Real have held a similar lead on eight previous occasions in European competition but only progressed half of the time, providing Napoli with reason to dream they can pull off a shock. ""We believe in it. We know we can score two goals at the San Paolo. We also know it will be quite a job for our defenders,"" Senegalese centre-back Kalidou Koulibaly told AFP following Saturday's 2-1 win at Roma in Serie A. Borussia Dortmund trail 1-0 ahead of the visit of Benfica to Signal Iduna Park on Wednesday. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang missed a penalty as Kostas Mitroglou's second-half strike in Lisbon last month gave the Portuguese outfit the edge in their tie. But the Gabonese striker netted his 20th and 21st goals of the Bundesliga season in Saturday's 6-2 drubbing of Bayer Leverkusen to move back in front of Bayern marksman Robert Lewandowski at the top of the scoring charts. However, the victory came at a cost with Germany international Marco Reus ruled out for four weeks after tearing his hamstring. ""It's sad news, he (Reus) has been playing very consistently for weeks and at a high level,"" said Dortmund boss Thomas Tuchel. ""It's an enormous loss which tarnishes the win."""

""We will give everything from the first minute to the last,"" the Croatian international told Spanish TV station Movistar. ""We will try and hopefully we can produce a miracle."" Messi scored two incredible individual goals to open and close the scoring as Barca remained one point clear of Real Madrid at the top of La Liga. The five-time World Player of the Year had a hand in all three other goals too as he teed up Neymar for a sensational chip and crossed for Samuel Umtiti to score his first Barca goal, whilst Rakitic was also on the scoresheet. In their first outing since coach Luis Enrique announced he will step down at the end of the season, Barca produced arguably their best performance of the campaign. The Catalans also smashed Sporting Gijon 6-1 in their previous outing -- both scorelines which would be good enough when PSG visit in midweek. And Enrique said he couldn't have wished for a better build-up to the ultimate challenge. ""That it is one of our best performances in the last few months is without doubt,"" he said. ""If I had to choose the way in which we would go into the Champions League game against PSG it would be very similar to these last two games: scoring lots of goals, the team gaining confidence and the players getting stronger. ""I think we are in great form for a very difficult tie, that is not lost yet. ""I am sure we are going to have opportunities to get ourselves back in it and we will try until the death."" Enrique's name was chanted by an enthralled crowd at the Camp Nou on Saturday. Banners were also raised towards the end of the match willing Barca's players to believe in the most unlikely of comebacks against PSG. ""The fans value a lot what these players have won, the hunger they have and what they show in every game,"" added Enrique. ""In my time here I have never once seen a poor attitude in any of my players. ""Barca fans should be loyal and, above all, have confidence that the team can come back."""
744,03/03/2017,16:32,Enrique 'relieved' after revealing Barca exit,Barcelona coach Luis Enrique expressed relief on Friday at clearing up his future after confirming he would step down from his role at the end of the season.,"The 46-year-old announced his decision to leave the Camp Nou after three seasons in charge following Wednesday's 6-1 demolition of Sporting Gijon in La Liga. ""In a certain way, I feel a bit relieved. I'm focusing my attention on this thrilling end of the season, given the possibilities and the goals we have,"" Enrique said at a press conference ahead of Saturday's game with Celta Vigo. Enrique has won eight titles during his Barca reign, but the former Spain midfielder said his demanding nature shaped his decision to walk away from the club when his contract expires in June. ""It's a flaw I have as a coach: I don't disconnect. I'm switched on for many hours. It's not a general thing, I see lots of coaches working for many years who fully enjoy it. But that's not the case for me,"" he said. Enrique also refuted any notion that his departure was linked to possible dressing room discord. ""My current relationship with the changing room is perfect. This decision is personal and the reason is the one I gave you,"" he explained, having cited the need for a rest when confirming his impending exit in midweek. ""I don't regret anything about my attitude, my way of involving myself in this job. I certainly have lots of things to improve, but I'm very critical of myself and that's one of the reasons for my wear and tear."" Barca have won their last five league games to move a point above Real Madrid at the top of the table, although the Catalan giants have played a game more than their arch rivals. However, they face a monumental challenge to overturn a 4-0 deficit against Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions League last 16 when the teams meet in the return leg in Spain next Wednesday. ""We want to continue on this good run of wins and go into the match against PSG in the best shape possible,"" Enrique added."
745,03/03/2017,14:40,"Enrique exit surprised Barca, says Suarez",Luis Suarez admitted he and his Barcelona team-mates were caught off-guard by coach Luis Enrique's announcement that he will leave his position at the end of the season.,"Former Spain international Enrique confirmed he would walk away from the Nou Camp when his contract expires in the summer in the wake of Wednesday's 6-1 rout of Sporting Gijon. The win sent Barca a point clear of Real Madrid at the top, albeit having played one game more, and the Catalan giants will look to bid their coach farewell with a third league title in as many seasons. ""It has surprised us a little, we didn't expect it but it is an understandable decision and one that we accept,"" Suarez told Barcelona's club website. ""The job of coach is very difficult and requires lots of hours of hard work and he has to enjoy being with his family as well."" Enrique cited the daily grind of the pressure as Barca boss and insisted he needed time to rest as he explained on Wednesday the reasons behind his decision to step down. However, it was the sudden nature of his announcement rather than the decision to leave that shocked the most. ""In the summer he already told us he was considering this could be his final year,"" said Barca president Maria Josep Bartomeu. The 46-year-old Enrique has overseen the best part of three trophy-filled but turbulent seasons since replacing Gerardo Martino in 2014. He won the Champions League, La Liga and Copa del Rey in his first season as Barca claimed an unprecedented second treble in 2015, matching their feat from six years under Pep Guardiola. Barca then retained both their league crown and domestic cup title last year."
746,02/03/2017,11:53,Wenger not interested in Barcelona job,"Arsene Wenger said he had no interest in succeeding Luis Enrique as Barcelona coach on Thursday, but admitted his future as Arsenal manager remains up in the air.","Luis Enrique announced after Barcelona's 6-1 win over Sporting Gijon on Wednesday that he will step down from his role at the end of the season in order to take a break. Wenger, 67, is due to make a decision on whether to extend his 20-year association with Arsenal either this month or next and he reiterated that his preference would be to remain at the Emirates Stadium. Asked if he would be interested in moving to Camp Nou, he said: ""No, my preference has always been the same and will remain the same. ""Of course I am not looking for jobs in other clubs or jobs off other people. ""I am focused on me, getting to the next level and trying to improve and always trying to see what you can do better and reinvent yourself and that's what I try to do. That's basically it."" Wenger's position is once again under scrutiny after Arsenal fell off the pace in the Premier League title race and lost 5-1 at Bayern Munich in the first leg of their Champions League last 16 tie. Despite his long attachment to the club, he said he was not allowing sentiment to cloud his thinking about his future. ""I have been here for 20 years and I had many times the opportunity to leave so I don't think I have to convince you that my preference has always been Arsenal,"" he told a press conference at Arsenal's training base. ""But of course I am objective and lucid enough to make the right decision for myself and the club as well. The club is free to make the decision it wants and I will respect that."" Wenger also said he would not be worried about the potential impact of making a statement about his future similar to Luis Enrique's. ""I believe that the players have their targets, the team targets, and I don't think that can be detrimental. It can be positive as well,"" said the Frenchman, whose side visit Liverpool on Saturday."
747,02/03/2017,10:31,Luis Enrique calls curtain on Barca reign,Barcelona coach Luis Enrique's decision to remove any suspense over his future by confirming he will step down as coach after three trophy-filled but turbulent seasons at the Camp Nou at the end of the campaign was met with surprise on Thursday.,"""Goodbye leader,"" said the front page of Barcelona sport daily Mundo Deportivo in reference to Enrique's announcement coming on the same night Barca overtook Real Madrid at the top of La Liga. Normally a combustible character, the 46-year-old calmly explained his reasoning for not seeking to renew his expiring contract after a 6-1 thrashing of Sporting Gijon on Wednesday. Enrique cited the daily grind of the pressure as Barca boss and insisted he needs time to rest. ""Luis Enrique leaves as he has always been, faithful to who he is: unpredictable and indomitable,"" said Barcelona-based newspaper Sport. ""His announcement took almost everyone by surprise in a decision that was strictly his."" However, it was the sudden nature of his announcement rather than the decision to leave that shocked the most. ""In the summer he already told us he was considering this could be his final year,"" said Barca president Maria Josep Bartomeu. The conclusion has merely been precipitated by a 4-0 thrashing at the hands of Paris Saint-Germain two weeks ago that leaves the Catalans needing a historic comeback in next week's second leg to avoid elimination from the Champions League at the last 16 stage for the first time in 10 years. Enrique told the players his decision just minutes before going public at the end of his post-match press conference on Wednesday. ""We were all left a bit open-mouthed,"" admitted midfielder Ivan Rakitic. However, undercurrents of disagreement with major figures in the dressing room have been a feature of Enrique's time in charge. Captain Andres Iniesta and Sergio Busquets criticised his tactical set-up in the demolition by PSG a fortnight ago. Moreover, a bust up with Lionel Messi in January 2015 nearly cost Enrique his job after just six months in charge. Instead, he went onto win eight trophies in the last three seasons. Only the two greatest coaches in Barca's history -- Pep Guardiola and Johan Cruyff -- have won more. That figure could even rise to 10 as Barca face Alaves in the Copa del Rey final on May 27 in what is likely to be Enrique's last match in charge, and hold a one-pont lead over Real Madrid in La Liga, albeit Madrid do still have a game in hand. Yet, the criticism that followed Barca's dismantling in Paris centred around a feeling they have begun to lose their identity in the Enrique years. Far from the sides filled with home-grown players built around the midfield of the Guardiola years, Enrique's team has been about feeding the star front three of Lionel Messi, Luis Suarez and Neymar the ball as quickly as possible. In Barca's first outing after Paris last weekend -- a nervy 2-1 win over lowly Leganes only sealed by a late Messi penalty -- there was only one Spanish player in Barca's starting line-up for the first time in their history. Therefore, maintaining a sense of Barca's DNA in the next appointment is likely to be crucial to an under-fire board. For that reason former Barca player and highly experienced Athletic Bilbao coach Ernesto Valverde is a leading candidate. However, polls suggest the supporters' choice would be Sevilla's Jorge Sampaoli. Sampaoli, who has guided Sevilla to third in La Liga and the Champions League last 16 in a highly impressive first season in Europe, is also likely to be a popular choice with fellow Argentine Messi. The five-time World Player of the Year has just over a year to run on his contract and keeping Messi happy and willing to extend his deal will have a huge influence on who is chosen to succeed Enrique."
748,01/03/2017,23:31,Guardiola hails 'perfect trainer' Enrique,"Pep Guardiola described Luis Enrique as ""the perfect trainer"" after the Barcelona head coach announced he would step down at the Nou Camp at the end of the season.","Manchester City manager Guardiola, himself formerly in charge of the famous Catalan club, had already moved to kill off any speculation that he might be temped back to Barca. But after his team beat Huddersfield 5-1 to reach the sixth round of the FA Cup on Wednesday, Guardiola spoke warmly about Enrique and his place in Barcelona history. ""I have two reactions,"" said Guardiola. ""My first is like a Barcelona fan -- because it is the club of my heart -- and I am so sad. ""We are going to miss the perfect trainer for Barcelona -- his personality, his character. He has had two or three years and played some unbelievable football with unbelievable players. ""The second point is if he decided that, I can understand him completely and of course I wish him the best luck. And finally, like all the membership from Barcelona, I want to say thank you for all you have done in these three years at my club. ""As an FC Barcelona fan, it is sad because there are few managers in the world better than Luis Enrique. ""He is a master because as manager of FC Barcelona you must take tough decisions there and his team has played with the best for the last two or three years. ""I still think they are the best team in the world and I am upset he is not going to be there but I understand because I was there myself before and I wish him the best."""
749,01/03/2017,22:09,Luis Enrique to leave Barcelona at end of season,Barcelona coach Luis Enrique ended speculation over his future on Wednesday by confirming he will leave the Catalan giants at the end of the season.,"""I will not be the coach of Barcelona next season,"" Enrique said after Barca's 6-1 thrashing of Sporting Gijon in La Liga. ""It is a difficult, measured and well thought out decision and I think I have to be loyal to what I think."" Enrique's contract is due to expire at the end of the season. The former Barcelona captain has won eight trophies in his three seasons in charge, including a treble in his first campaign and a La Liga and Copa del Rey double last season. However, his future was placed in serious doubt after Barca's 4-0 thrashing at the hands of Paris Saint-Germain in the first leg of their Champions League last 16 tie two weeks ago. ""There are three exciting months ahead,"" Enrique added. ""We are in a difficult situation, especially in one competition, but with the help of everyone and if the stars align we can turn that game around. ""I will give my full dedication in these three months."" Like his friend and former teammate Pep Guardiola, who stepped down after four glorious years in charge of Barca in 2012, Enrique highlighted the pressures of the top at the Camp Nou as his reason to step down. ""The reason is the way in which I live this profession. It means very few hours of rest."" However, midfielder Ivan Rakitic said Enrique's decision left the Barca players ""open-mouthed"". ""The coach came into the dressing room and told us before the press conference,"" said Rakitic. ""We were all left a bit open-mouthed. We didn't know he was going to announce it today. ""He has all the support of the dressing room. We will do everything we can to do our best in the months to come."" Sevilla boss Jorge Sampaoli is the early favourite to take charge next season after leading the Andalusians to an unlikely La Liga title challenge and into the Champions League last 16 in his first season in Spain. Athletic Bilbao coach and former Barca player Ernesto Valverde is also a leading candidate. Victory over Sporting took Barca two points clear of Real Madrid at the top of La Liga, but Real have two games in hand. Unless Barca stage an unlikely comeback against PSG on March 8, Enrique's final game in charge will be against Alaves in the Copa del Rey final on May 27."
750,28/02/2017,15:33,Naive not to be Messi-dependent - Luis Enrique,"Barcelona boss Luis Enrique insists his side's reliance on Lionel Messi is perfectly normal when you have ""the best player in the world"" on your side.","Messi has kept Barca's La Liga title challenge alive with late winners in 2-1 wins over Leganes and Atletico Madrid in their last two outings to take his tally for the season to 35 goals in as many games. However, Barca have still to tie down Messi's long-term future at the Camp Nou. The five-time World Player of the Year has just over a year to run on his contract with talks over a new deal ongoing. ""It would be naive to think we wouldn't depend on the best player in the world,"" said Enrique on Tuesday. ""Hopefully we can depend on him for many years to come."" Victory at Atletico eased somewhat the mounting pressure on Enrique after a 4-0 thrashing at Paris Saint-Germain two weeks ago left the Catalans on the verge of bowing out at the last 16 of the Champions League for the first time in 10 years. In particular, his tactical shift from Barca's traditional possession based game to a more direct style designed to get the best out of a superstar front three of Messi, Luis Suarez and Neymar has been criticised. However, Enrique insisted ahead of Sporting Gijon's visit to the Camp Nou on Wednesday, that possession is only a means to an end. ""The key to having possession is not just to have it for the sake of it, but to have possession as a means of reaching a goal, and the goal is winning games,"" he added. ""If the opponent sits back and allows long passages of play in possession they don't leave you spaces to find gaps. ""If they decide to press high and leave space then it doesn't make sense too not take advantage of that and in two touches overcome the press to score a goal."" Enrique hopes to have Javier Mascherano and Arda Turan back from injury for the visit of struggling Sporting, who sit two points off safety in 18th. And with tougher tests against Celta Vigo and the return leg with PSG to come in the next week, Enrique is expected to make sweeping changes from the side that started against Atletico with the likes of Jordi Alba, Ivan Rakitic and Andre Gomes also set to return."
751,26/02/2017,18:15,Messi haunts Atletico once more to send Barca top,Lionel Messi struck the winner four minutes from time as Barcelona moved top of La Liga on Sunday with a crucial 2-1 win at Atletico Madrid.,"All the goals came in the final half hour as Rafinha put Barcelona in front before Diego Godin's header quickly restored parity. However, so often the thorn in Atletico's side, Messi registered his 27th career goal against Los Rojiblancos to ease the pressure on under fire Barca coach Luis Enrique. Barcelona now lead Real Madrid and Sevilla by two points. Real, though, have two games in hand on their title rivals, the first of which comes later on Sunday at Villarreal. Defeat leaves fourth-placed Atletico just one point clear of Real Sociedad in the battle for the final Champions League slot. Following their Champions League thrashing at the hands of Paris Saint-Germain and struggles at home to Leganes last weekend, Luis Enrique switched from the Catalans habitual 4-3-3 to a 3-4-3 with Messi forced into an advanced midfield role. However, the change in tactics did little to stem Barca's slump in form early on as Atletico dominated the opening half hour. Yannick Carrasco and Godin blasted wildly off target when well placed inside the area early on. Antoine Griezmann then saw a goalbound effort blocked by French international teammate Samuel Umtiti. Atletico's best effort of the opening half came from long range, though, as Griezmann's driven effort on his weaker right foot forced a brilliant flying save from Marc-Andre ter Stegen. Barcelona thought they had gone in front against the run of play on the half hour mark when Luis Suarez headed in from close range after a goalmouth scramble. However, the Uruguayan was penalised for a handball after Jan Oblak had parried Messi's initial effort. Oblak was making his first appearance since December 12, but the Slovenian showed no signs of rustiness to once again prove his credentials as one of the finest 'keepers in the world. Firstly, Oblak produced a sensational stop to tip Messi's dipping free-kick over and then clutched Gerard Pique's header from point-blank range. Both sides passed up huge chances at the start of the second-half. Firstly, Suarez screwed his shot horribly wide after being played in by Messi. Then at the other end, Ter Stegen made another excellent stop to deny Griezmann from a narrow angle. The deadlock was eventually broken in scrappy fashion on 63 minutes as Rafinha profited from a loose ball inside the area to fire low into the far corner. However, the lead lasted only seven minutes as Godin rose higher than a host of Barca defenders to flick home Koke's free-kick for the equaliser. Yet, when Barca needed a potential season defining goal, Messi again came up trumps with his 35th in as many games this season. The five-time World Player of the Year's first effort from Suarez's cut-back was blocked, but he followed up to prod past the helpless Oblak and move Barca top of the table."
752,25/02/2017,17:02,"Barcelona still the best, warns Atletico's Simeone",Atletico Madrid coach Diego Simeone insisted Barcelona remain the best team in the world despite their recent struggles ahead of the sides third meeting this month on Sunday.,"A poor opening first 45 minutes in the first leg of their Copa del Rey semi-final tie cost Atletico dear as wonder goals from Luis Suarez and Lionel Messi put Barca well on their way to a 3-2 aggregate win. However, since then Barca have been thrashed 4-0 by Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions League and needed a last-minute Messi penalty to see off lowly Leganes last weekend, placing coach Luis Enrique in the firing line. ""Barca are still the best in the world,"" said Simeone on Saturday. ""It is very difficult to compete as they have in the past decade. With Luis Enrique they have eight trophies, competed at the highest level and one bad game like against Paris can happen to anyone. ""We played three extraordinary halves against them and still didn't get through, that shows that they are better."" By contrast, Atletico are well on course to reach the Champions League quarter-finals for a fourth straight year after a 4-2 win away at Bayer Leverkusen in their last 16, first leg on Tuesday. Kevin Gameiro looks set to keep his place ahead of Fernando Torres alongside Antoine Griezmann up front as he shone brightest despite all three getting on the scoresheet in midweek. Atletico will be further boosted by the return of defensive lynchpin Diego Godin from injury, whilst goalkeeper Jan Oblak could make his first appearance since December after recovering from surgery on a dislocated shoulder. Luis Enrique, meanwhile, is hoping a first midweek off since the turn of the year is what Barca needed to recharge their batteries and recover their form. ""It is the first free midweek we have had in 2017. The schedule has been brutal and it is evident that takes its toll,"" said Enrique. ""The week allowed us to work on things, for the team to rest and analyse what is going on with the team."" Real Madrid's defeat to Valencia in midweek means Barca still trail their title rivals by just a point. And Luis Enrique's men can go top for at least a few hours with victory at the Vicente Calderon, with Madrid not in action until later on Sunday at Villarreal."

The academy, which will also serve as a training centre for China's national team and top clubs, is one of tens of thousands of facilities expected in the coming years as China strives to become a football superpower. ""We know Barcelona FC works very well with kids, with high-level professionals that are coming to work here,"" Ronaldinho said. ""I believe they will help a lot and Chinese football is going to learn a lot."" The new facility will be the biggest of Barcelona's 20-plus academies around the world, and the first directly managed by club staff. It is still dwarfed by the Evergrande Football School in Guangdong, which has links with Barcelona's Spanish rivals Real Madrid and more than 2,000 students, making it the world's biggest academy. But Mission Hills vice-chairman Tenniel Chu told AFP in November that the Barcelona academy will eventually grow to 30 pitches, alongside an international school with a capacity of 5,000. China, whose national team is wallowing at 86th in the world rankings, plans to have 50,000 academies and football-focused schools by 2025, the education ministry said this week. ""Probably it will be the (biggest) project of football in the world,"" Bartomeu said, referring to the new academy. ""I think China needs... what Mission Hills is doing in Hainan, and for China it's going to be a new step for the growth in football. ""For me, the temperature, the ambience, the people, and mainly the terrain of this island are going to be something unique for... the development of football in China."" Mission Hills already operates the world's two biggest golf resorts in Guangdong and Hainan, along with a Boris Becker tennis academy. Despite its 1.3 billion population, China punches well below its weight in football, reaching the World Cup only once in its history -- in 2002, when the team lost all three group games without scoring a goal. But under President Xi Jinping, a football fan, China has ambitions of hosting and even winning the World Cup, triggering a rush of Chinese investment in foreign clubs, players, coaches and media rights. Alongside the academy in Hainan, Barcelona will also open a 7,000-square-metre (75,000 square feet) 'Barcelona Experience' centre, featuring exhibits and merchandise for sale.

""Of course when Leo is happy that helps him give his best performance, morale is crucial for form,"" said the 59-year-old former defender. ""A footballer is happy when he is playing and winning, otherwise he is rarely happy,"" said Bauza. Messi's Barcelona were beaten 4-0 at Paris Saint-Germain last week in their first-leg last-16 Champions League tie and with his contract running out in 2018 there is speculation he may leave. The coach refused to be drawn on Messi's future. ""At Barcelona, Manchester City or wherever, that's his decision to take. I just want him to play and that's all."" ""He's the type of player who always wants to be on the pitch, never wants a rest."" The coach went on to say Messi's international record, with the trophy cabinet with Argentina bare, was no stain on his achievements. ""Some say the fact he's won nothing with Argentina means he's not the best in the world, not the most dangerous, not worth as mush as some others,"" said Bauza. ""But we are going to try and win this next World Cup, which will make him one of the greatest of all time."" Argentina are currently fifth in the qualifiers for the South American 2018 World Cup qualifying group with four games to go."

However, Barcelona's 4-0 Champions League hammering at the hands of Paris Saint-Germain last week has put Sampaoli's name at the head of the queue should Barca boss Luis Enrique not have his contract renewed at the end of the season. ""At the moment the only thing that appeals to us is to live in the present,"" Sampaoli said on Tuesday. ""This game is the most important thing for us, to be among the best eight teams in the most important tournament in the world, and to think about anything else for me would be irresponsible."" Barca's interest allied to a fine debut season at the Sanchez Pizjuan with Sevilla also riding high in third in La Liga has even seen club reportedly set to offer Sampaoli an improved deal to stay in Seville. However, he believes the pressure now being put on Leicester boss Claudio Ranieri just months after achieving the seemingly impossible in winning the Premier League is a sign that he can't get carried away with the plaudits coming his way. ""We live in the present and maybe in two weeks this (praise) won't happen because it has to do with momentaneous success. There has to be a much wider analysis,"" added Sampaoli. ""But the fact that the club has the intention to think about a new contract pleases us and we will evaluate it."""

758,20/02/2017,19:57,"Spanish court rejects Neymar, Barca appeal",A Spanish court on Monday dismissed appeals from Neymar and Barcelona over alleged fraud and corruption in the Brazilian star's transfer from Santos in 2013.,"The decision brings the possibility of the player and club facing trial a step closer. Neymar's arrival from Brazil's Santos has been a huge success for the Spanish champions on the pitch but a judicial nightmare off it. The 25-year-old Brazilian striker is being investigated in Brazil and Spain over his headline move to La Liga. Barcelona originally published the transfer figure as 57.1 million euros ($60.6 million), with 40 million euros of that given to the player's family. But Spanish authorities believe the true transfer figure was at least 83 million euros. In November, prosecutors recommended that the striker be handed a two-year jail sentence and a fine of 10 million euros for alleged corrupt practices. Sentences of two years or less are habitually suspended for first time offenders in Spain. The case initiated with a complaint from Brazilian investment company DIS, which owned 40 percent of Neymar's sporting rights at the time of his transfer. DIS received just 6.8 million euros, 40 percent of the fee paid to Santos, with the company claiming it was cheated out of its real share because part of the transfer fee was concealed by Barcelona, Santos and the Neymar family."
759,20/02/2017,18:24,Alves says Barca directors have 'no idea how to treat players',Brazilian right back Dani Alves has slammed Barcelona directors for their treatment of him during his final seasons with the Spanish club.,"The former Barcelona star signed for Serie A champions Juventus on a free transfer last summer after eight years with the Catalan giants. ""Those who run Barcelona today have no idea how to treat their players,"" Alves told Spanish daily ABC on Monday. ""I like to feel wanted, and if they don't want me, I leave. Leaving Barca on a free was a classy punch. During my final three seasons I always heard that Alves was leaving, but the directors never said anything to my face. ""They were very false and ungrateful. They did not respect me. I was only offered a new deal when the FIFA transfer ban came in. ""That was when I played them at their own game and signed a deal with a termination clause."" Alves said he chose Juventus -- bidding for a record sixth consecutive Serie A title this season -- because he wanted a challenge outside his ""comfort zone at a club with a history and a winning mentality"". ""Here I'm happy and I have new and beautiful challenges in this great team. We have a team capable of challenging for the Champions League."" Alves admitted he sometimes found aspects of fame tiring. ""Football's really hypocritical,"" he said. ""That's why I am disappointed. Fame is s---. ""Now that I am famous I've realised that famous people are seen in a poor light. Football brings envy, hypocrisy and false friendships."" Alves also blamed the media for twisting his words resulting in frequent clashes with Real Madrid striker Cristiano Ronaldo. ""All my fights with Cristiano were because of the press,"" he said. ""If people only knew how much I respect Cristiano Ronaldo. I will repeat it to make myself clear: I respect Cristiano Ronaldo. ""And I think the same of (Lionel) Messi or Neymar. My thoughts were not negative. What happens is that the press sold them differently, saying that I had spoken badly of him. And Ronaldo believed it. ""That's why he did not greet me at the Ballon d'Or Gala in 2015."""
760,20/02/2017,01:35,Barca boos unhelpful - Luis Enrique,Barcelona boss Luis Enrique labelled harsh treatment dished out to his players by Barca fans nonsensical as the Spanish champions squeezed past Leganes 2-1 on Sunday.,"Following a 4-0 thrashing at the hands of Paris Saint-Germain in midweek, Barca needed a last minute Lionel Messi penalty to see off a Leganes side without a win since November and on their first ever league visit to the Camp Nou. Messi had given Barca a fourth minute lead, but jeers rang around the Camp Nou when Unai Lopez levelled 19 minutes from time. ""As a fan, booing a player of your own team for me makes no sense,"" said Enrique. Much-criticised midfielder Andre Gomes received the brunt of the boos as he was replaced 10 minutes from the end. ""What can clearly help the team and the players is the support that we saw from the majority of the fans throughout the game and especially in the final minutes,"" added Enrique. ""That is what makes us stronger. Andre's case annoys me."" However, the Barca boss said he had no such problem with criticism directed his way. ""I am the coach and after the result and performance we saw in Paris it is logical. ""I accept any criticism, but those on the pitch need to be in the best state possible. ""The games are difficult enough as they are. If you add this on top of it, I don't think it helps."" Victory ensured Barca moved back up to second in the table and to within a point of Real Madrid, who still have two games in hand. Barca face a much stiffer test next weekend when they travel to Atletico Madrid, but Enrique highlighted the psychological importance of getting the three points despite a poor display. ""A slip-up today would have been almost definitive. Not in terms of points, but on an emotional level. ""I am convinced that the team is going to improve and immediately."" The Spanish champions were thankful to a series of fine saves from Marc-Andre ter Stegen as he was unexpectedly busy to keep Leganes at bay. ""It has been a difficult week for everyone without a doubt,"" said the German. ""The most important thing is that we were able to win today. That will give us a bit of confidence, which we need for the weeks ahead."" And Ter Stegen echoed his coach's call for a show of unity from the Barcelona faithful. ""Everyone that is on the field tried their best and I think the most important thing is to support us at times like we have had this week with the 4-0 defeat in Paris,"" he added. ""We need the fans, above all at home, to support us. ""We can win or lose together, but the most important thing is that we are united."""
761,18/02/2017,16:25,PSG thrashing could have been worse - Luis Enrique,Barcelona boss Luis Enrique admitted his side's 4-0 Champions League mauling at the hands of Paris Saint-Germain could have been even worse as he insisted he has taken no decision over his future on Saturday.,"The Spanish champions are on the verge of not reaching the Champions League quarter-finals for the first time in 10 years after defeat in Paris that matched their heaviest in Enrique's three-year reign. ""Evidently, it is a huge blow for everyone, but the sky hasn't caved in,"" Enrique said on Saturday ahead of his side's clash at home to Leganes. ""The opponent deserves more. They were better, we have to accept that. ""It was a fair result. The truth is it could have been even more."" Enrique has received fierce criticsm over the past few days with even midfielders Sergio Busquets and Andres Iniesta questioning his tactics. The former Barca captain is out of contract at the end of the season with no talks scheduled over a renewal. However, he claimed that the debacle in Paris would not decide whether he decides to stay on if offered a new deal. ""The only thing that is clear is that what happens in these months has nothing to do with my decision,"" he added. ""Not one game, not 10 games, no even our 38 games this year. ""I still haven't made my decision."""
762,17/02/2017,23:32,Guardiola rules out return to Barcelona,Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola says he will never go back to Barcelona as their coach amid growing uncertainty about present incumbent Luis Enrique's future.,"Enrique is out of contract at the Nou Camp at the end of the season, and the chances of him leaving have increased significantly after a calamitous 4-0 defeat away to Paris St-Germain in the Champions League on Tuesday. That result, in the first leg of their last 16 tie, left Barcelona on the brink of elimination from the competition, and they also lag behind bitter rivals Real Madrid in the race to win La Liga. Athletic Bilbao coach Ernesto Valverde is reportedly a contender for the job if Enrique leaves, along with Eusebio Sacristan of Real Sociedad and Everton's Ronald Koeman, who as a player scored the goal that secured them their first European Cup in 1992. Guardiola, who won 14 trophies in four years as Barcelona's head coach, says he has no intention of returning to the job he left in 2012. ""No, I will never go back to Barcelona to be coach there. My period there is gone."" Despite their stumbles, Barcelona remain the standard bearers of world football, according to Guardiola. ""Barcelona are still the best team in the world,"" said the 46-year-old Spaniard. ""It's always a surprise because they are so, so good, but in football anything can happen. ""There's a lot of competition, the opposition are so strong. You can win heavily or you can lose heavily, that can happen, it's happened to me, but there are 90 minutes to go and anything can happen. ""If there's a team who can do it, then it's Barca, with their mentality. ""When you have dominated world football, it's normal that the people expect you to keep up that level, but my advice to you, knowing Luis and the players a little, is not to talk too much, because they will be back and prove you wrong. ""They've done it over the years, dominating football for 10 years, and they continue to be the best team in the world."" Guardiola, meanwhile, has suggested the quality of English football would be improved if FA Cup replays were scrapped. Quarter-final replays were ditched last summer by the Football Association, which had abolished them at the semi-final stage in 1999. Guardiola would prefer to see further action taken, calling for a system similar either to that used in Spain's Copa del Rey, where all ties bar the final are played over two legs, or Germany's Cup competition, where drawn matches are decided with extra-time and penalties, without the need for a replay. ""In Spain, we play two games. I prefer that situation,"" he said. ""Maybe for the amount of games played, extra-time and penalties would be good. ""But OK, I'm not here to decide the rules of how we play the competition, I'm here to play the competition in the way that the chairmen and the important people decide. ""I prefer the quality over the quantity. Not only here in England, all around the world. It's a big mistake, so many games. ""You have to allow people to go to the theatres, the cinemas, the good restaurants and not play every game in front of the TV. We're going to kill the players. ""We could have the same quality, same intensity but a few less games. That is just my point of view."""
763,17/02/2017,15:34,Suarez: Barca capable of historic CL comeback,Barcelona striker Luis Suarez believes the Catalans can become the first side ever to overcome a four-goal first leg deficit in the Champions League when Paris Saint-Germain visit the Camp Nou on March 8.,"Barca were torn apart in a 4-0 thrashing by the French champions in their last 16 clash on Tuesday, sparking fierce criticism in particular of coach Luis Enrique. ""It is difficult to lose like that, particularly in the last 16 of the Champions League, but I think this team is capable of turning around the situation,"" Suarez said at a charity event on Friday. ""We have to convince ourselves. We are all culpable. When we win, we win together and the same when the opposite happens. ""This team has made history by winning the treble, for winning many things in the last few years and if we want to make history as a team, then we have to focus on turning this tie around. ""It is a great challenge and we are looking forward to it."" Enrique's tactics were questioned by midfielders Sergio Busquets and Andres Iniesta, whilst he confronted a reporter for Catalan TV station TV3 in a fiery post-match interview. The former Barca captain has won eight trophies in his three seasons in charge, but Enrique's future was already in doubt as his contract expires at the end of the season. And Suarez insists Enrique should have the right to decide whether he continues next season. ""We have had good times thanks to him and now we are all suffering together and between us have to move forward,"" he added. ""The coach is old and mature enough... to know what decision he has taken or will take. ""We will accept whatever decision he makes."""
764,15/02/2017,15:19,Champions League progress near impossible - Neymar,Barcelona's Brazil star Neymar says it will be a virtual 'mission impossible' for the Spanish giants to progress in the Champions League after their 4-0 first leg demolition by Paris Saint-Germain.,"No team has ever come back from a 4-0 first leg deficit to remain in the Champions League and Barcelona are under no illusions about the mountain they will have to climb for the second leg of the last 16 clash at Camp Nou on March 8. ""Now we have to think about the return match and see what we can try to do to reverse this situation,"" the Brazilian star told journalists. ""But it will be very difficult, practically impossible. However, we can't give up."" Barca were totally dominated during the game in which Angel di Maria scored twice alongside further goals from Julian Draxler and Edison Cavani in a match Barca coach Luis Enrique dubbed a disaster for the Spaniards. Neymar poured praise on PSG and said that being hammered was unfamiliar to Barcelona's galaxy of international stars. ""All credit to PSG,"" he said. ""This match was atypical, we are not in the habit of finding ourselves in this sort of situation. ""It will be very difficult to prepare for the return match, with a four-goal deficit. I don't think this has ever happened to me."" He said that Barcelona had not prepared well for the game but were still surprised by the punishment they had received. ""We were not good, we did not do our work as we should have done and we were surprised by this result,"" he said. The joint heaviest defeat in coach Enrique's three seasons in charge means Barcelona face missing out on the quarter-finals for the first time since losing on away goals to Liverpool in the last 16 in 2006/07. ""It was a disastrous night for us in which we were clearly inferior,"" Enrique acknowledged. Neymar, Lionel Messi and teammates took part in a closed-door training session at Camp Nou earlier on Wednesday to wind down after the PSG defeat. A glum looking trio of Messi, Luis Suarez and Gerard Pique were pictured on the club website taking part in the session."

Barcelona sports daily Sport's front cover said ""this is not Barca,"" whilst Madrid-based AS's headline ran ""total disaster."" A former Real Madrid foe came back to haunt Barca as Angel di Maria scored twice, whilst further goals from Julian Draxler and Edison Cavani handed PSG the glorious European night they have craved since a takeover from Qatar Sports Investments six years ago. The joint heaviest defeat in Enrique's three seasons in charge means they face missing out on the quarter-finals for the first time since losing on away goals to Liverpool in the last 16 in 2006/07. ""It was a disastrous night for us in which we were clearly inferior,"" Enrique acknowledged after the game. ""I accept responsiblity, but I would also like the same respect and personal treatment in the interviews when we win,"" Enrique said in a fiery interview with TV3. Enrique's future at the Camp Nou beyond the current campaign was already in doubt as his contract expires at the end of the season. Barcelona also trail Real Madrid in the race for the Spanish title. And Busquets's reaction in praising Enrique's counterpart Unai Emery for the tactical set up that caught the Catalans cold was telling. ""It wasn't an attitude problem, but a football one. They pressed more and were better tactically. They had a plan and carried it out as they wanted."" Sport described Barca as a ""shipwreck without a coach"". ""Barca fell in Paris without grandeur and without excuses,"" continued Sport's editorial. ""It was a tumultuous fall, from the first minute to the last...more than an accident, it manifested itself as an aggravation of many problems, some latent and others evident, that had already been shown up throughout the season."" Enrique's preference for Portuguese international Andre Gomes in midfield has been a particular bug bear for the press. Gomes missed a huge chance to level with the score a 1-0 midway through the first-half. Yet, humiliation in Paris laid bare broader failings in Barca's season on and off the field from the president down to the players. Gomes was the most expensive of six summer recruits costing over 120 million euros ($127 million) designed to add greater depth and more youth to the squad. Yet, none of them have made a significant impression with Barca still reliant on an ageing core of Gerard Pique, Andres Iniesta and Busquets alongside the start front three of Lionel Messi, Luis Suarez and Neymar. Meanwhile, suitable replacements for the departed Dani Alves and Xavi Hernandez from the Barca sides that won trebles under Pep Guardiola in 2009 and in Enrique's first season in 2015 have yet to be found. The most immediate order of business for president Josep Maria Bartomeu and his board is to tie down Messi with the five-time World Player of the Year just over a year away from becoming a free agent. Yet, worryingly for Barca's future, Messi and Suarez also turn 30 this year. The punishment dished out to Enrique was only further evidenced by the praise lavished on Emery in his homeland. Emery guided Sevilla to Europa League glory in each of the past three seasons and once again proved his worth on the European stage despite having managed just one win over Barca in his previous 23 attempts with Sevilla and Valencia. ""The Sheikh signed him for this,"" said Madrid sports daily Marca. ""What Carlo Ancelotti and Laurent Blanc couldn't do, Unai has within his grasp - eliminating Messi's Barca from the European Cup."""
766,15/02/2017,01:30,Barcelona shell-shocked after PSG hammering,Barcelona coach Luis Enrique admitted his side's Champions League hopes are all but over for this season after they were outclassed 4-0 by a brilliant Paris Saint-Germain in their last 16 first leg on Tuesday.,"Angel Di Maria scored twice for the French champions on his 29th birthday at the Parc des Princes, while Julian Draxler and Edinson Cavani -- on his 30th birthday -- were also on target in a stunning home performance. The result leaves PSG on the brink of a place in the quarter-finals for the fifth season in succession, while Barcelona are staring at their earliest exit since losing to Liverpool in the last 16 in 2007. It was the Catalans' worst night in Europe since their 7-0 aggregate mauling at the hands of Bayern Munich in the 2013 semi-finals, and no team has ever gone through after losing 4-0 in the first leg of a European tie. ""It is difficult to explain. They were superior to us from the start,"" admitted Luis Enrique. ""There was a 15-minute spell in the first half in which we were on top, but otherwise PSG attacked quickly on the break and created a lot of chances. ""It was a disastrous night for us. They were completely superior. There is not much more to say."" Di Maria, the former Real Madrid winger, opened the scoring with a free-kick in the 18th minute and Germany star Draxler marked his European debut for the club with the second goal five minutes before the interval. Di Maria curled in his second and the home side's third 10 minutes after half-time before Cavani completed the rout with his 34th goal of the campaign in the 71st minute. ""PSG did what we expected them to do and produced their best version and we were at our poorest,"" the Barcelona coach added. ""It's extremely difficult for us now but we go back to our stadium and really we need a heroic performance but why not dream? ""These players have shown down the years that they can get great results. Our chances are slim but there is a chance all the same."" History suggests their chances are less than slim and the tie is PSG's to lose now after what was a signature European performance from the French champions. They had twice been eliminated by Barca in the four seasons prior to this, but their 3-1 home defeat to the Catalans in 2015 was their only loss in their 42 previous European outings at the Parc des Princes. Coach Unai Emery, meanwhile, had only won one of 23 games against Barcelona in his coaching career, but his team destroyed their opponents right from the off. Lionel Messi, Neymar, Luis Suarez and Andres Iniesta all endured miserable nights while the likes of Draxler, Di Maria, Adrien Rabiot and Thomas Meunier were all superb. Centre-back Presnel Kimpembe also produced an accomplished display on his Champions League debut at the age of 21 in place of injured captain Thiago Silva. ""We could not have imagined a better evening. To win 4-0 against Barcelona on my birthday is incredible,"" Di Maria told beIN Sports. ""It was the perfect match. But to go through we will need to play like this again because they are also capable of scoring four goals."" Emery could be forgiven for basking in the glory of such a victory after the criticism he faced in his early months in France. However, the Spaniard preferred to strike a note of caution ahead of the return. ""We put in a great effort against a great team but the message in the dressing room was that we still have 90 minutes to play. ""Satisfaction for a coach is very short-lived and I respect the great team that Barcelona are."""
767,14/02/2017,23:00,Di Maria stars as brilliant PSG stun Barcelona,Angel Di Maria scored a brilliant brace on his birthday as Paris Saint-Germain sensationally destroyed Barcelona 4-0 at the Parc des Princes in their Champions League last 16 first leg on Tuesday.,"Di Maria, the former Real Madrid star, opened the scoring in the 18th minute and curled in another 10 minutes into the second half to celebrate his 29th birthday in style. January signing Julian Draxler also netted in between while Edinson Cavani marked his 30th birthday by adding his name to the scoresheet in the 71st minute in the French capital. Barcelona were completely stunned, the defeat their biggest European humiliation since losing 7-0 on aggregate to Bayern Munich in the semi-finals in 2013. They are now staring at a first exit from the competition before the quarter-finals in a decade, unless they can pull off a miraculous escape in the second leg at the Camp Nou next month. This was PSG's night, though, and Unai Emery's side will surely go on to secure a fifth successive appearance in the quarter-finals. ""To win 4-0 against Barcelona on my birthday is incredible, we are so happy. It was the perfect match and we are delighted with the result,"" Di Maria told beIN Sports. ""To go through we will need to produce another performance like this. We scored four goals but they are capable of doing the same thing."" PSG had twice been eliminated from the Champions League at the hands of Barcelona in the previous four seasons, and the Catalans also had a fearsome record in games against sides coached by Emery, losing just one of 23 before this. But Luis Enrique's team, for all the brilliance of Lionel Messi, have recently looked more fragile than in a long time and the French champions showed no fear. They were without injured captain Thiago Silva and the suspended Thiago Motta, meaning a start for Adrien Rabiot in midfield and a Champions League debut in defence for 21-year-old Presnel Kimpembe. Draxler also made his European debut for the club and the German was superb as PSG pressed Barcelona high right from the off -- the home side had already worked Marc-Andre ter Stegen in the Barca goal before they got the opener. The menacing Draxler was fouled just outside the area and Di Maria bent the resulting free-kick over the wall and in for his third goal in the Champions League this season. Crocked following an early foul by Rabiot, Neymar was off the field receiving treatment as the Parc des Princes crowd erupted. He was able to continue, but the visitors were lacklustre, Luis Suarez starved of service, Messi quiet and skipper Andres Iniesta struggling to cope. One Neymar acceleration did lead to an Andre Gomes shot that was turned behind by Kevin Trapp, yet otherwise the chances were at the other end. Ter Stegen saved from Draxler after a counterattack, but there was nothing he could do as the German made it 2-0 five minutes from half-time, exchanging passes with Marco Verratti and rifling a shot past the goalkeeper from the right side of the area. The expectation was that Barcelona would come out fighting after the restart but instead they fell further behind in the 55th minute to a piece of brilliance from Di Maria. The move started with Trapp rolling a goal-kick out to Rabiot on the edge of his own box and the midfielder turning away under pressure from Messi. It ended with Di Maria curling a left-foot shot high into the top-left corner of the net from the edge of the other area. Di Maria then came off to a standing ovation, but Paris were not finished. Thomas Meunier surged forward from right-back and set up Cavani, who thumped home his 34th goal of the season in all competitions. A miserable night for Barcelona was compounded when Samuel Umtiti hit the post late on."

Earlier media reports said Silva had missed Monday's final training session ahead of the game at the Parc des Princes and would not make the 18-man squad named by coach Unai Emery. Silva watched his teammates do their work while sat on an icebox. The 32-year-old had already missed last Friday's 3-0 win at Bordeaux in Ligue 1 with a minor muscle problem but had been expected to be ready in time to face the Spanish giants. PSG, who are looking to reach the quarter-finals for the fifth season in succession, are also without ex-Barcelona midfielder Thiago Motta due to suspension. However, Argentine playmaker Javier Pastore could feature. Silva's place in central defence may be filled by the young Presnel Kimpembe alongside Marquinhos with Blaise Matuidi set to inherit the captain's armband."

""Luis is very physical, he uses his body a lot. I am different, I don't move as much as him,"" said Cavani, who will celebrate his 30th birthday on the day of the UEFA Champions League last 16, first leg at the Parc des Princes. Here AFP Sports compares the two Uruguayan stars: EDINSON CAVANI (Paris Saint-Germain) Date of birth: 14/2/87 Clubs: Danubio, Palermo, Napoli, Paris Saint-Germain (since July 2013) International caps/goals: 89/37 International honours: Copa America 2011 Honours with PSG: Three Ligue 1 titles, two French Cups, three French League Cups Goal-scoring record for PSG: 114 goals in all competitions (second only to Zlatan Ibrahimovic, on 156, on club's all-time list); 33 in all competitions this season (25 in Ligue 1, 6 in Champions League, 2 in League Cup) LUIS SUAREZ (Barcelona) Date of birth: 24/1/87 Clubs: Nacional, Groningen, Ajax, Liverpool, Barcelona (since July 2014) International caps/goals: 90/47 International honours: Copa America 2011 Honours with Barcelona: One UEFA Champions League, one UEFA Super Cup, one FIFA Club World Cup, Two La Liga titles, Copa del Rey twice Goal-scoring record for Barcelona: 109 goals in all competitions; 25 in all competitions this season (18 in La Liga, 2 in Champions League, five in other tournaments)"
770,13/02/2017,13:52,Emery's Barcelona challenge in five figures,Paris Saint-Germain coach Unai Emery has managed teams against Barcelona 23 times since 2007. Here is the size of his challenge in five figures as his side prepare to take on the Spanish superstars in the Champions League last 16 on Tuesday:,"Emery, who moved from Sevilla last year and has also coached Lorca, Almeria, Valencia and Spartak Moscow, has won just once against Barcelona, lost 16 times and drawn six. The 2-1 win in La Liga in October 2015 came on a day that Barcelona were playing without Lionel Messi and Andres Iniesta. The woodwork saves Sevilla three times in the match. Barcelona beat Emery's side 2-0 in the final of the Copa del Rey last year. Paris Saint-Germain will be the fifth club Emery has coached against Barca. With Spanish lower league side Almeria there was one draw and one loss, Valencia four draws and six defeats, two defeats with Spartak Moscow, one win, one draw and seven defeats with Sevilla. Perhaps Emery's most exciting encounter against Barcelona came in the 2015 European Super Cup in Tblissi when the Catalan giants beat Sevilla 5-4 after extra time. Barcelona had led 4-1 in the 52nd minute but Emery's side fought back superbly to extend the game. Argentine superstar Lionel Messi has played 21 matches against Emery's sides and scored 25 goals -- as many as Emery's sides have scored against Barcelona. Barcelona have scored 58 goals in all against Emery's five teams. Paris Saint Germain are warned. The Spanish coach's season will be judged on whether he can get the French club into at least the Champions League semi-finals for the first time."
771,13/02/2017,01:30,Digne backs 'MSN' to outgun PSG once more,Lucas Digne says Barcelona's deadly strike force will again carry them past Paris Saint Germain when the teams meet at the Parc des Princes in the Champions League last-16 on Tuesday.,"At just 23, left-back Digne has already experienced the demands at the top level with PSG in his homeland and Roma in Italy, but nothing comes close to the demands he faces day-to-day since joining Barcelona in July. ""When you are a competitor, you always want to win. This locker room was born for that, this club is made for that,"" Digne told AFP in an exclusive interview. ""Every year you have to win trophies and that's how it is. That's what we are playing for. ""All players dream of winning trophies, it is that adrenaline that we seek."" Digne already has the Spanish Super Cup from this season to add to the eight trophies he won in just two years at PSG. However, much bigger challenges and prizes await with Barca in search of a second treble in three years. Luis Enrique's men travel to the French capital for the first leg of their Champions League last 16 clash on Tuesday just one point off the top of La Liga and already having booked their place in the final of the Copa del Rey. Digne was on the losing side when Barca propelled themselves towards a fifth European Cup by sweeping aside PSG 5-1 on aggregate at the quarter-final stage two years ago. Luis Suarez and Neymar combined for the goals in that tie, but Lionel Messi remains the senior partner in Barca's frightening 'MSN' front three. ""Leo is magic. He is the best player in the world,"" added Digne. ""When you have the best forwards in the world, it can always make a difference. ""The goal of football is to score goals, so if you have the best attack, for sure it helps."" Despite an outlay totalling hundreds of millions of euros, PSG are yet to break the glass ceiling of the last eight in the Champions League since owners Qatar Sports Investments took control of the club six years ago. Domestic dominance wasn't enough to save Laurent Blanc his job at the end of last season as the owners tired of European failure with Sevilla's three-time winning Europa League coach Unai Emery put in place. But Digne believes even more time is needed for PSG to break into the Champions League elite. ""The history of a club is very important. I think we have to give them time to build. ""The fact that they have changed staff, they are in full construction of a new project so we must give them time."" Digne's decision to move to the Camp Nou with his career trajectory on the rise was questioned with Spanish international and Catalan native Jordi Alba standing in his way of a regular starting place at left-back. Yet, Barca boss Luis Enrique's desire to rotate has meant he has already made 20 appearances this season. ""I've played a lot, I've played important matches. I'm at the biggest club in the world at 23 years old,"" he added. ""A lot of people would like to be where I am today and I'm really happy about that. ""I said that it was a dream to play for this club and that it would be really great for me to have an experience like this. ""Today I am lucky enough to be able to do so. It was in the back of my mind to be able to reach the highest level. Having such a chance is a wonderful thing for me."""
772,13/02/2017,01:28,"Emery, PSG look to get one over Barcelona at last",Paris Saint-Germain host Barcelona in the first leg of their Champions League last-16 tie on Tuesday with their Spanish coach Unai Emery desperate to improve his awful personal record against the Catalans.,"Emery was brought to the French capital last year as the successor to Laurent Blanc in order to help take PSG to the next level in Europe after four consecutive quarter-final exits in the Champions League. But finishing second in their group behind Arsenal exposed PSG to a tougher draw in the first knockout round and now they must beat the Spanish champions -- the second leg will be at the Camp Nou next month -- just to make it to the last eight again. Emery, the former Sevilla boss, has come up against Barcelona 23 times in his coaching career and won just once, in La Liga last season. Paris, meanwhile, have been knocked out of the Champions League by Barcelona twice in recent campaigns, losing in the quarter-finals in 2013 and again in 2015 to Lionel Messi, Neymar and co. But there is a new-found confidence at the Parc des Princes after a fine start to 2017 which has seen them win 10 and draw one of their last 11 games in all competitions. ""We believe in ourselves and this game comes at a good time for us. If it had come at the start of the season I would have been more worried, but everything has changed,"" PSG's Italian midfielder Marco Verratti said after Friday's 3-0 win at Bordeaux in Ligue 1, in which Edinson Cavani scored twice. The French champions have beaten Barcelona in the recent past, claiming a 3-2 win in the group stage in September 2014. They are also a formidable proposition at the Parc des Princes, having lost just once there in Europe in the last decade. ""It's a huge challenge. Simply put, we will have to play two huge matches,"" Brazilian left-back Maxwell, a former Barcelona player, told PSG's website. ""No-one enters this competition hoping to cross paths with them. Still, it's up to us to make the difference."" Emery will be unable to utilise veteran midfielder Thiago Motta, another ex-Barcelona player, due to suspension. Meanwhile, one winger from Angel Di Maria, Lucas Moura and January signing Julian Draxler will have to settle for a place on the bench. Barcelona travel to France buoyed by a crushing 6-0 win at Alaves in La Liga at the weekend in which Luis Suarez scored twice. That result means Luis Enrique's side have now lost just once in 22 games although it was overshadowed by an awful ankle injury suffered by right-back Aleix Vidal which rules him out for the rest of the season. Javier Mascherano and Arda Turan are sidelined too, although one man who could feature is Rafinha, who was named in the squad but will need a mask to protect a broken nose. Barcelona are still fighting on three fronts, keeping alive the prospect of another La Liga, Copa del Rey and Champions League treble to match those achieved in 2009 and 2015. ""It's not really something we talk about amongst ourselves but all the players have it in mind,"" the club's former PSG defender Lucas Digne told AFP. ""As long as we are still in every competition, it is very important. This club is born to win trophies."""
773,12/02/2017,00:52,Barca's Vidal to miss rest of season,Barcelona right-back Aleix Vidal will take no further part in the Spanish champions quest for a treble this season after suffering a dislocated right ankle that will keep him out for five months.,"Vidal was injured with just three minutes to go of Barca's 6-0 rout at Alaves on Saturday when he came off worst in a challenge with on-loan Atletico Madrid defender Lucas Hernandez. ""The player has been transferred to a hospital in Vitoria and a dislocation to the right ankle that required reconstructive surgery has been confirmed,"" Barca said in a statement. ""The approximate downtime will be about five months."" Vidal had only just recently fought his way back into Barca boss Luis Enrique's plans after being cast aside for large parts of the opening half of the campaign. ""I am upset by Aleix's injury, the way it came about and what it means for him,"" said Enrique. ""I hope it doesn't turn out to be as bad as it looks,"" added Barca midfielder Ivan Rakitic. ""I was quite shocked. Hopefully he'll be back soon as he is a great guy and he was playing excellently."""

The injured supporter has been taken to hospital suffering from head injuries. ""Deportivo Alaves profoundly condemns the violent acts that took place this morning February 11, in the university zone between supposed fans of Alaves and FC Barcelona,"" Alaves said in a statement. ""The club will put itself at the disposition of the authorities and, if it is confirmed that those implicated are season ticket holders, Deportivo Alaves will consider exemplary sanctions against those people.""

However, ahead of Barca's latest trip to the French capital, Di Maria, who experienced plenty of El Clasico highs and lows against the Catalans in four seasons with Real Madrid, believes PSG now have the quality to compete with the Spanish giants for a first ever European crown. ""PSG have players of enormous quality. People like Marco Verratti, who is wanted by Real Madrid and Barcelona, give the team something extra,"" Di Maria told Madrid sports daily Marca on Friday. ""When he isn't there, the team feels (his absence). I think that PSG can easily compete with Madrid or Barcelona."" However, to make the last eight, PSG face the daunting task of restricting Barca's fearsome 'MSN' front three of Lionel Messi, Luis Suarez and Neymar. Suarez and Neymar did the damage in the last tie between the sides, scoring all five of Barca's goals in a 5-1 aggregate rout, but it is his Argentine international teammate Di Maria fears most. ""Barca have great players. The MSN is the best attack right now,"" he added. ""Leo is different from the rest. ""I think to stop him it requires the whole team because when he doesn't do something magical he leaves a teammate free."""

""He took way too long to leave the pitch and then when he did he hung out in the tunnel instead of going to the changing rooms,"" the Spanish Federation explained when giving Suarez a two-game ban instead of one. Suarez scored the goal that gave Barca a 1-1 draw against Atletico Madrid at the Camp Nou on Tuesday to secure a 3-2 aggregate win. The defending champions now play Alaves on May 27 in their fourth straight final. Suarez will miss that game as well as the opening tie in next season's Spanish Cup."

It means he will miss the final against either Alaves or Celta Vigo on May 27. ""FC Barcelona will appeal when the competition committee views the referee's report,"" said the Catalans in a statement. After the match, Suarez had said of his challenge with Koke: ""It isn't even a foul."" But he retained little hope of being exonerated. ""We already know how these things go. ""That is why I am so angry because it was absolutely nothing."" Barca have won the Copa del Rey in each of the last two seasons."

However, the Uruguayan -- sent off for the first time in three years at Barca -- claimed a stray elbow on Koke as the game entered stoppage time wasn't even a foul. ""It makes me laugh because it was like he (the referee) wanted to do it,"" Suarez told Gol Television. ""We need to see if we can appeal the second yellow because it isn't even a foul, but we already know how these things go. ""That is why I am so angry because it was absolutely nothing. The first yellow was also for the first foul I committed in the game, but you could see it coming."" However, Barca boss Luis Enrique isn't holding out too much hope of having Suarez available for May's final against either Alaves or Celta Vigo. ""You have to appeal all you think is unjust, but when you look at the precedents, you see what normally happens with appeals,"" said Enrique. ""Apart from the anger that the players who will miss the final feel, the important thing is that Barca have won. ""There are now only two teams that can win the Cup and we are one of them."" Barca have still to lose a Copa del Rey tie against anyone other than Real Madrid since 2010. However, they were given a mighty scare by an Atletico side that enjoyed the better of the chances on the night. ""Today the luck was with us,"" added Enrique. ""Perhaps in these 90 minutes we didn't deserve this result, but, overall, given the opponents we have faced, we deserve to be in the final."" Yannick Carrasco forced Jasper Cillessen into a fine save after just six minutes before Suarez looked to have killed off the tie just three minutes before half-time. However, most of the action came in the second-half as Barca's Sergi Roberto and Carrasco both saw second yellow cards. Atletico then had a goal by Antoine Griezmann wrongly ruled out and saw Kevin Gameiro's penalty fly over the bar before the latter levelled on the night seven minutes from time. ""Once again despite the circumstances that they faced, the team put their body, soul and heart into a passionate tie as any Atletico Madrid player has to,"" said boss Diego Simeone. ""We are out of the competition but have our heads held high and the strength that we have three fantastic months (ahead). ""Hopefully we can maintain what we showed against them in the second-half the other day and during the 90 minutes today."" Atletico have endured a disappointing season so far as they languish well off the pace of Barca and Real Madrid in fourth in La Liga. However, Simeone is hoping their display will spark a return to the form that took them to the Champions League final last season. ""Last year after we lost here with nine men, I went away saying that I felt something good could come of it and this time I feel exactly the same,"" added the Argentine. ""When you lose in this manner, something special remains with the team, above all with such important competitions such as the fight we have in La Liga and the Champions League to come."""

""The match situation is that one team has a clear advantage, which is us, while the other is obliged to score two goals,"" said Enrique. ""It will be a match which forces Atletico Madrid to show more."" The visitors to the Camp Nou on Tuesday have enjoyed much success in that fabled stadium in recent seasons, but Enrique said that was playing a style in which they ""camped in their own half"" whereas now they will be forced to ""press high up the pitch"". Enrique is hoping to recover injured midfield pair Sergio Busquets and Andres Iniesta for the game. Atletico coach Diego Simeone said his team will ""play with the same intensity that we've shown in the best moments of this season"". The Argentine admitted it will be ""difficult"" to progress but added: ""We're confident and we know how we want to approach the match. We'll give our all.""

Despite holding a 2-1 lead over Atletico, Enrique maintained his policy of heavily rotating his side throughout a demanding start to the year with Liga and Cup commitments soon to be added to by the return of the Champions League. ""First and foremost, it is important to realise that to reach our three objectives we need the whole squad,"" said Enrique. ""Today a lot of players who haven't had a lot of minutes took part and showed what they can do."" With Luis Suarez watching on from the bench, Paco Alcacer netted his first La Liga goal for Barca since a 30 million euro ($32 million) move from Valencia in August. Lionel Messi added a second five minutes before half-time with his third free-kick against Athletic this year thanks to a huge error from Gorka Iraizoz in the visitors' goal. Messi then took a rare rest for the final 25 minutes to be replaced by Sergi Roberto. But that didn't halt Barca's rhythm as Aleix Vidal slotted a fine third into the corner two minutes later. ""We were able to give a rest to some because, without that, it is impossible to compete at 100 percent with all the games we have coming up,"" added Enrique. ""We've won three marvellous points."" However, Barca suffered a double injury blow with Andres Iniesta and Sergio Busquets still sidelined as Pique limped off at half-time before Rafinha had to be replaced early in the second-half with a head knock.

Barca initially announced a 10-year deal had been agreed, but issued a revised statement without a definitive timeframe for the agreement. ""FC Barcelona and Ronaldinho have reached an agreement whereby the Brazilian will become a Club ambassador and representative at various events and activities over the coming years,"" Barca said in the revised statement. Ronaldinho, 36, will also be part of a Barca legends team that will play exhibition matches across the world. On top of the trophies and 91 goals he scored in 198 appearances for Barca, Ronaldinho's time in the Catalan capital is fondly remembered for his outrageous array of skills and broad smile with which he often graced the pitch. His arrival from Paris Saint-Germain in 2003 also heralded a shift in power in Spanish football as he took a teenage Lionel Messi under his wing. In the 14 years since, Barca have won four Champions Leagues and eight La Liga titles to Real Madrid's two European crowns and three domestic titles."

""I think we have to differentiate between video refereeing which means re-refereeing many things and I am not in favour of...and helping the referees with technology in key moments of the game,"" said Enrique ahead of his side's Copa del Rey semi-final, first leg at Atletico Madrid. ""A ball over the line or disallowed goal or red card offence...these are the plays where the referees need help and would only lose two or three seconds to check and clarify."" La Liga president Javier Tebas has previously dismissed the use of Hawk-Eye technology used for goal line incidents in other leagues on cost grounds and believes the type of video refereeing, trialed by FIFA at December's Club World Cup, is a cheaper and more practical resource for the future. ""We have always defended the use of technology in football and in this case we believe video refereeing is the most advanced form,"" Tebas said on Monday. ""The cost was almost 4.5 million euros ($4.8 million). Every year there are seven or eight incidents like this and it seemed to us a fortune when there are other (technologies) in the market at a far lower cost. ""In Spain we have to agree with the referees' committee and we have already communicated to them that next year there will be trials like there are in the Bundesliga or Premier League."" And Tebas believes all the major leagues will move towards a system of video refereeing for controversial incidents by 2018 should FIFA approve. ""By July 2018 if FIFA have already definitively approved it we will install (video refereeing),"" added Tebas. ""Given how the trials are going by July 2018 there will be video refereeing in all professional leagues."""

""I have seen a photo. It is the same debate as always, the referees need help,"" said Enrique. ""The technology can help them. I say that for all situations not just ones that go for me, but against me too."" Unlike the Premier League and Serie A, La Liga has so far refused to install goal line technology with La Liga president Javier Tebas citing cost as his main concern. Barca eventually salvaged a point in the final minute as Luis Suarez swept home Lionel Messi's defence splitting pass. However, the Catalans missed the chance to go top of the table ahead of Real Madrid's clash with Real Sociedad later on Sunday. Madrid still lead Barca by a point and now have two games in hand. And despite their misfortune, Suarez and Enrique recognised that Barca were well below par in a match that Betis dominated for 75 minutes. ""We are aware that we didn't play well and we have to be critical of ourselves,"" said Suarez. ""We are obliged to win and now we have to wait for those at the top of the table to lose."" Betis had hit the crossbar and post through Dani Ceballos and Ruben Castro in the second-half before Alegria finally put them in front. And Castro also missed a one-on-one with Marc-Andre ter Stegen with the score at 1-0. ""In the first-half we made quite a few mistakes and they had good counter-attacks without having clear chances,"" added Enrique. ""In the second-half until they scored they were clearly the better team and we were a long way from our best. ""Possibly the sensations after the last few minutes change the impression of things, but I think we have clearly won a point (rather than lost two)."""

""It seems fantastic to me that a player decides to go to China for money because it happens in all professions,"" Enrique said on Saturday. ""In yours too (the media), you change job and people wish you all the best and say 'marvellous'. ""But if a footballer or a coach does it he is a money-grabber or a traitor. It is strange."" Enrique's own future for next season remains in doubt with his contract set to expire and seemingly no desire to negotiate a renewal before the end of the campaign. However, he was more coy on whether he would be interested in moving to the Far East. ""I don't know what is going to happen next week, let alone in a few seasons time,"" he added.

The player complained he had been targeted with accusations that he did not love his home country or its modern secular founder Mustafa Kemal Ataturk. ""No-one has the right to question my love for my country and Ataturk with unfounded accusations,"" Turan said, adding he sought to apply Ataturk's principles ""every moment of my life"". ""I can tolerate every kind of criticism but I cannot tolerate insults about my love for the fatherland and love for the flag."" ""This country is my love. I want to emphasise this again."" Turan and his fellow former Galatasaray star Burak Yilmaz, who now plays for Beijing Guoan, joined a social media video campaign started by Turkish football legend Ridvan Dilmen for voters to back a 'Yes' vote in the referendum. In the second video in the chain, Arda responded: ""I have heeded the call from Ridvan. I am also in for a strong Turkey. Burak Yilmaz, my brother, are you also in?"" Actor Baris Atay, a known longtime critic of Erdogan, issued a counter video with the message ""we are against one-man rule and dictatorship"". Arda Turan, who was raised in the low income Istanbul district of Bayrampasa, has been a vocal supporter of Erdogan throughout his rule as premier from 2003-2014 and then president. Erdogan won thumping support from Turan in the wake of the failed July 15 coup aimed at ousting him from power, with the football superstar appearing at rallies in his support."
789,25/01/2017,14:33,Doubts grow over Luis Enrique's Barca future,Barcelona boss Luis Enrique again avoided questions over his future on Wednesday as speculation grows that he could walk away from the Spanish champions at the end of the season.,"Enrique has won eight trophies in two and a half years in charge but is out of contract at the end of the season and is in no rush to renew, with the club's focus on securing new deals for Lionel Messi and captain Andres Iniesta. Barcelona daily Sport reported on Wednesday that Enrique's assistant Juan Carlos Unzue is his preferred choice to take over should he leave, whilst Sevilla boss Jorge Sampaoli has also been heavily linked with a move to the Camp Nou given his fine first season in Spanish football. ""I don't have anything to say,"" Enrique replied when pressed on his future and whether Unzue, who has barely any senior managerial experience, could handle the role. However, Enrique insisted his relationship with the squad is as good as ever in his third season in charge. ""This is my third year here and I see the same desire, same eagerness and will to want to keep making history and winning titles. ""I see the same hunger and I would even say it is greater with every passing season."" Barca remain well-placed to land more trophies under Enrique's watch as they welcome Real Sociedad to the Camp Nou on Thursday for the second leg of their Copa del Rey quarter-final holding a 1-0 first-leg lead. The Spanish champions are also only two points adrift of La Liga leaders Real Madrid, although Madrid also have a game in hand, and face Paris Saint-Germain in the last 16 of the Champions League."
790,24/01/2017,16:14,Barca chief relaxed despite Messi speculation,Barcelona sporting director Robert Fernandez insists he is sure Lionel Messi will sign a new deal with the Catalan giants despite continued speculation over the five-time World Player of the Year's future.,"Messi has just 18 months left on his current contract and would have no shortage of lucrative offers should he decide to leave the club where he has spent the entirety of his glittering career. However, Fernandez believes negotiations over a new deal are progressing ""very well."" ""There were many comments and people who want to intoxicate this situation, but we have been working on it for a long time and we are calm,"" he told Catalan radio station Rac1. Simmering tensions between the Barca board and squad boiled over a fortnight ago when the club's CEO Oscar Grau claimed Barca had to negotiate any new contracts with ""common sense"" given their spiralling wage budget. However, star striker Luis Suarez, who recently signed a new deal to 2021, responded angrily to those comments. ""With Messi what you have to do is give him a new contract, not have common sense,"" said the Uruguayan. Messi, who will turn 30 in June, has been in spectacular form this season, scoring 28 times in just 26 appearances. ""Leo has got to the stage where he seems he is better now than he was two, three, four or five years ago. That is the feeling he gives us, that he gets better all the time and plays as he wants,"" added Fernandez. ""There is no doubt that Leo is the best player in the world. That is the reality."" As well as Suarez, Barca have handed new deals to Neymar, Sergio Busquets and Javier Mascherano in the past year. And Fernandez is hopeful of also pining down captain Andres Iniesta, Ivan Rakitic and Marc-Andre ter Stegen in the coming months. ""I am very calm, but I was very calm in the case of Mascherano, Neymar, Busi (Busquets), and I am very calm with the subject of Andres, Ivan, Marc and Leo because I have a lot of confidence that they are going to remain with us,"" he added. ""I am totally convinced that the four players will continue at Barcelona."""
791,22/01/2017,22:05,Barca's Busquets suffers ankle ligament damage,Barcelona midfielder Sergio Busquets had to be stretchered off just eight minutes into the Catalans' trip to Eibar on Sunday with sprained ligaments in his right ankle.,"""Busquets has a sprained external lateral ligament in his right ankle. Tomorrow he will have more tests,"" Barca's official Twitter account confirmed. The Spanish international's ankle was trapped under the weight of Gonzalo Escalante's studs as the Argentine was fortunate to escape without even being shown a yellow card. Denis Suarez replaced Busquets and went onto open the scoring with his first Barca goal. However, of greater concern may be Busquets's availability for a busy few months ahead for the Spanish champions. On top of their La Liga commitments, Barca host Real Sociedad in the second leg of their Copa del Rey quarter-final on Thursday and return to Champions League action when they travel to Paris Saint-Germain on February 14."
792,21/01/2017,13:44,"Injured Iniesta irreplaceable, says Enrique",Barcelona boss Luis Enrique believes there isn't another player in world football who can adequately replace what injured captain Andres Iniesta brings the Catalan giants.,"However, as Barca go in search of a fourth straight win at Eibar on Sunday night, Enrique is hopeful the Spanish champions are finally beginning to find the form that will help them chase down Real Madrid at the top of La Liga. ""There is no one, not in the squad or in world football (like Iniesta),"" Enrique said on Saturday. ""That is the problem. I have many very good players, but none of them are like Iniesta. Iniesta will miss the trip to the Basque country after coming off at half-time in Barca's 1-0 Copa del Rey quarter-final, first leg win at Real Sociedad on Thursday due to a calf problem. However, the club remain hopeful he will return in time for the second leg against Sociedad on Thursday. A first victory in San Sebastian for 10 years in midweek rounded off a good week for Barca as they cut the gap on Real Madrid to two points in La Liga, although Real also have a game in hand. Barca can match their longest winning streak this season with another victory at Ipurua, but Enrique is looking for a much longer sustained run to topple Madrid as the first half of the Liga season comes to a close this weekend. ""We have been looking for a long run of positive results since the start of the season, but it still hasn't arrived. ""Hopefully, this is it, hopefully this can be the run where we put together a long streak of wins. We need it, above all, to put pressure on those above us."""
793,18/01/2017,15:31,Rakitic central to Barca plans - Luis Enrique,Barcelona boss Luis Enrique tried to ease speculation on Wednesday that midfielder Ivan Rakitic could be on his way to the Premier League after falling down the pecking order at the Camp Nou.,"The 28-year-old Croatian international was a crucial figure as Barca won the treble in Enrique's debut season and a Spanish league and cup double last year. However, he has started just once in four games in 2017 with summer signing Andre Gomes featuring more prominently. The former Sevilla captain has been strongly linked with a move to Manchester City after previously admitting he would love the opportunity to work with City boss Pep Guardiola at some point in his career. ""Ivan is a player who has been and will be important for the team and the club,"" Enrique said ahead of Thursday's trip to Real Sociedad in their Copa del Rey quarter-final first-leg tie. Rakitic claimed last week that his respect was such that he would ""jump off a bridge"" if told to by Enrique. However, negotiations over a new deal for the midfielder have stalled as Barca prioritise renewals for Lionel Messi and Andres Iniesta. ""Rakitic is an example on and off the field,"" added Enrique. ""I am not the one that has to evaluate new contracts. I just want all the players that are available to make the most of the minutes they are given."" Barca travel to San Sebastian on Thursday looking to break an eight-game winless streak away to Sociedad, stretching back to 2007. ""We have seen all sorts of games in San Sebastian, but I prefer not to talk about the past,"" said Enrique. The Barca boss had described his side's 1-1 draw on their last visit as ""almost a miracle"" in being thoroughly outplayed in one of the poorest performances of his three-year reign. ""We are looking for changes from that game. We need to be able to overcome their high pressing, be efficient on the ball and create more chances."" Gerard Pique, Iniesta and Neymar all look set to return after being rested for Saturday's 5-0 thrashing of Las Palmas as Enrique has named a full-strength squad."

""The club doctors will need to monitor the Brazilian's progress before determining his availability for other matches."" Rafinha has been a key part of the Barca squad this season, scoring six goals in 18 appearances despite missing the start of the campaign as he helped his country to Olympic gold on home soil in Rio. Should Barca see off Sociedad over two legs, the Spanish champions face a congested fixture list with 16 matches to come in the next two months."

""We have to remain calm,"" Luis Enrique said, suggesting the club would not be rushed or panicked. ""We're not getting involved in that,"" the coach insisted amid speculation the player may eventually move on. ""The rhythm and the way this is worked out will be dictated by the club and Leo Messi himself."" ""I don't know about numbers, I know about football. We all want to enjoy watching Messi here for many more years, nothing else matters for me."" Despite posting a record turnover of 679 million euros ($719 million) last season, a series of expensive new contracts for the likes of Neymar and Luis Suarez mean Barcelona are close to overstepping the 70 percent limit of turnover spent on salaries imposed by UEFA's financial fair-play laws. Meanwhile, Enrique hailed Suarez's achievement of reaching 100 goals in 120 Barcelona appearances, a landmark reached in the 3-1 Copa del Rey win over Athletic Bilbao in midweek.

Despite posting a record turnover of 679 million euros ($719 million) last season, a series of expensive new contracts for the likes of Neymar and Suarez mean Barcelona are close to overstepping the 70 percent limit of turnover spent on salaries imposed by UEFA's financial fair-play laws. Barca captain Andres Iniesta also has just 18 months left to run on his contract. On the field, Messi proved the match-winner once again on Wednesday as he scored from a free-kick for the third time in as many games this year 11 minutes from time to edge out Bilbao 4-3 on aggregate. ""I don't know what the CEO said, but tell me one game in which Leo Messi hasn't been decisive,"" said Barca coach Luis Enrique. ""I don't know about numbers, I know about football.

""We have to be very strict with the budgets, we can't go crazy,"" said Barcelona CEO Oscar Grau, confirming that the Catalan giants have no plans to strengthen the squad in the January transfer window. ""We need to comply with the ratios of debt and the percentage of salaries in the budget."" Five-time World Player of the Year Messi, 29, and Iniesta, 32, have been at the club since they were teenagers and have been the cornerstones of the most glorious period in Barcelona's history, each winning eight Spanish league titles and four Champions Leagues. ""We want the best player in history to remain here at Barcelona and we want to renew the players that have been brought through here. They are the best and they should retire at home,"" added Grau. ""We have to analyse it. We are working with common sense and discretion. We want Messi to stay and we will find the way, I am sure. I want to calm all Barcelona members."" Any new deal for Messi is likely to see him usurp Cristiano Ronaldo, who recently extended his Real Madrid deal to 2021. The pressure on Barca's salaries is set to be eased when bumper new shirt-sponsorship deals with Japanese retailer Rakuten and kit manufacturer Nike worth an estimated 210 million euros a year kick in from next season and 2018 respectively. Meanwhile, the start date for a major redevelopment of the Camp Nou has been delayed from later this year to July 2018."

The draw capped a poor return to action in the new year for Barca after losing the first leg of their Copa del Rey last 16 tie at Athletic Bilbao on Thursday. ""We are aware that we are Barcelona and we are obliged to fight for all the titles,"" Suarez told Spanish TV station Movistar. Barca host Bilbao in the return leg on Wednesday hoping to avoid a first Cup exit to anyone other than Madrid since 2008. ""What matters now is the Cup game on Wednesday,"" added Suarez. ""We have to go out from the first minute to win the game and qualify."" Suarez had an unusually quiet night in front of goal as most of Barca's opportunities fell the way of his strike partners Neymar and Messi. ""They have shown all season that they are very difficult to play against at home. We had our chances in the second-half, but we couldn't take them until Leo's goal,"" added Suarez. ""We've let two points get away, but we just have to keep working hard.""

""Without a doubt (Barca are the most in need), you just have to look at the table,"" Enrique said on the eve of the game Friday. Back-to-back draws against Malaga and Real Sociedad for Barca have allowed Madrid to amass a comfortable lead. Indeed, Enrique even described Barca's display at Sociedad last weekend as the worst of his three seasons in charge. However, he insisted the Spanish champions remain the best team in the world when they hit top form. ""There are good teams at a high level, but none of them are better than us. That is what makes me optimistic."" Barca also received a huge injury boost on Friday when captain Andres Iniesta was cleared to make his return after six weeks out with a knee injury. ""Iniesta is our captain and a reference point for Barca's style,"" added Enrique. ""It is great news for the person that he is and what he represents as captain."" Madrid have gone 32 games unbeaten in all competitions since April, but Enrique expects Los Blancos to defend deep and aim to hit Barca on the counter-attack. ""I expect Madrid to play as they have done since the start of the season and last year, they have no problem in leaving the ball to the opposition and we need it. In that sense we understand each other. ""They take advantage of set-pieces, quick transitions, few touches and the efficiency of their players in the final third. We need more control to create spaces and chances."" Meanwhile, Barca midfielder Arda Turan insists the Catalans are unstoppable when they play to their potential, despite their struggles in recent weeks. ""Barca are the best team and when we play like we know how, we are unstoppable,"" the Turkish international told Barca TV. ""I have a very good feeling ahead of the Clasico."" A television audience of 650 million people are expecting to tune in worldwide. And Barca defender Javier Mascherano admitted any meeting with Madrid carries a special allure. ""Despite there being just three points at stake, like in the rest of the matches, the attention before and after the game makes it a special match,"" the Argentine told Barca TV. Mascherano's life should be made easier by the absence of Real's flying winger Gareth Bale through injury. The Welshman looks set to miss up to four months after undergoing surgery on an ankle injury. However, Mascherano is wary of the European champions' strength in depth. ""They have lost a very important player, but this season their reserves are playing very well. ""Madrid have players of great quality so we have to pay special attention no matter who plays."""
803,30/11/2016,02:09,Agent provocateur Pique leads Barca into fresh Clasico battle,Among the stalwarts of Barcelona's near decade of dominance of Spanish football there is no one that stokes the ire of Real Madrid like Gerard Pique.,"Pique is Barca's best defender, leader, possible future president and principal provocateur to the Madrid fans and media. Yet, ahead of the latest meeting between the Spanish giants on Saturday, Barcelona, who trail Madrid by six points at the top of La Liga, need the positive side of Pique's game and character more than ever. ""With you it all began"" are words the former Manchester United man has become synonomous with in Spain. His thanks to Colombian musician Kevin Roldan at Barca's treble celebrations in 2015 for performing at Cristiano Ronaldo's 30th birthday party that precipitated a Madrid collapse in La Liga sparked a wicked backlash. Pique was booed for months after even when playing for Spain. However, the roles may now be reversed. Madrid's revival under coach Zinedine Zidane in 2016 began when Pique opened the scoring the last time the sides met in April. When Pique nodded Barca in front, the Catalans were set to move a mammoth 13 points clear in the title race. Instead, Real battled back to win 2-1, missed out on the title to Barca by just one point on the final day of the season and haven't lost in La Liga since. Whilst the captaincy at the Camp Nou is awarded based on longevity, Pique is undoubtedly the leader of this Barca team now shorn of the likes Carles Puyol and Xavi Hernandez. ""On Saturday we have more to play for than Madrid, they can lose, we can't,"" he said on Monday. ""We always need to believe in this team."" Often chosen to face the media in the most difficult times, Pique also sets the tone on and off the field for a Barca side that has lost some of its identity this season. The champions had less possession in a match they didn't win for the first time since 2008 in being thoroughly outplayed by Real Sociedad in a 1-1 draw on Sunday. ""The performance at Anoeta was a disaster,"" said Pique, who was brought through the club's famed youth academy alongside Lionel Messi before returning to Barca in 2008 after a brief spell in England. ""He expresses himself wonderfully. He has a great ability to communicate,"" was Barca boss Luis Enrique's reaction to Pique's recent admission that he sees himself as a future Barca president rather than coach. ""I would vote for him,"" added Manchester City boss and still Barca member Pep Guardiola. Pique is far from all talk. Current Barca president Josep Maria Bartomeu admitted the club's 220 million euro ($236 million) shirt sponsorship with Japanese online retailer Rakuten was initiated by a dinner set up by Pique and his world famous Colombian pop star partner Shakira. However, his outspoken nature has often caused a backlash. Pique has openly supported a campaign for Catalonia to be given a referendum on independence. In October he announced his decision to retire from international football after the 2018 World Cup after being falsely accused of cutting the colours of the Spanish flag off his shirt in the latest of series of spurious controversies questioning his commitment to play for Spain. In a match always charged with political as well as sporting tension, Spanish eyes will be peeled on Pique's performance as much as Messi and Ronaldo."
804,28/11/2016,14:48,Barca's Alba doubtful for Clasico,Barcelona suffered a fresh injury blow on Monday as left-back Jordi Alba is a huge doubt for Saturday's showdown clash with Real Madrid after suffering knee and ankle knocks.,"Alba battled on to finish the 90 minutes in Sunday's 1-1 draw at Real Sociedad despite suffering the injuries before half-time. ""The tests carried out this morning reveal that Jordi Alba has heavy bruising on his right knee and a strain of his left ankle,"" Barca said in a statement. ""How he evolves will determine his availability for the next few games."" Barca desperately need to end Madrid's 31-game unbeaten run at the Camp Nou after falling six points behind their eternal rivals at the top of La Liga. Should Alba not recover in time, French international Lucas Digne will deputise at left-back. The Catalans also hope to recover Samuel Umtiti and captain Andres Iniesta from injury in time for Madrid's visit."
805,28/11/2016,11:20,What has gone wrong for Barcelona?,Barcelona are off to their worst La Liga start since Lionel Messi's debut season nine years ago.,"A 1-1 draw at Real Sociedad was described as a ""miracle"" by Barca boss Luis Enrique in what he singled out as the worst performance in his three seasons in charge. Barca are already six points adrift of Real Madrid ahead of their meeting in El Clasico on Saturday. Here, AFP Sports looks at what has gone wrong so far this season for the Spanish champions. Messi rescued Barca from a fifth consecutive defeat on their travels to San Sebastian, but Sunday's draw was the first time Barca have dropped points in the league this season when the Argentine has completed 90 minutes. Messi's presence has been sorely missed in defeats to Celta Vigo and Alaves and draws with Malaga and Atletico Madrid. However, he is far from the only key man to have sat out some part of the season so far. Andres Iniesta has been out for over a month, whilst his Spanish international teammates Gerard Pique and Jordi Alba were also sidelined for a number of weeks. An often underrated pillar of Barca's success in the past decade, Sergio Busquets is in the midst of his most protracted dip in form since breaking into the first team under Pep Guardiola in 2008. It is no coincidence that Busquets's struggles have come for the first prolonged period in his career without retired legend Xavi or Iniesta by his side. His influence in terms of touches and passes completed has wained since Enrique took charge and favoured a more direct style to feed a superstar front three of Messi, Luis Suarez and Neymar more quickly. However, without the ball Busquets is now being exposed by the lack of support around him as Ivan Rakitic has been forced wider on the right to protect the inexperienced Sergi Roberto, who the departed Dani Alves at right-back. Whilst Barca have failed to hit the heights of old, the gap between them and Madrid can also be explained by the differing challenges they have faced to date. The Catalans have already made tricky trips to Sevilla, Sociedad, Athletic Bilbao, Celta Vigo and, despite their current struggles, Valencia, as well as Atletico Madrid at home. Real's 31-game unbeaten run will be put firmly to the test at the Camp Nou on Saturday, but other challenges await for the European champions with four away trips in five games just as the Champions League returns in February. Barca splurged over 120 million euros ($127 million) in the summer transfer window in a bid to bolster their squad. So far to no avail as none of their six recruits have established themselves in Enrique's preferred starting XI. Despite beating off Madrid to the signature of Andre Gomes, the Portuguese Euro 2016 winner has failed to make an impression in Iniesta's absence, whilst 30 million euro striker Paco Alcacer has yet to score a goal. A year ago whilst Messi was sidelined for two months by knee ligament damage, Neymar and Suarez not only ensured Barca didn't lose ground in the title race, but accelerated past Madrid at the top of the table. Twelve months on and Barca's Messi-dependence has reemerged with the Argentine scoring 10 of Barca's last 14 goals. Suarez has scored just once in his last five outings, whilst Neymar hasn't scored from open play in La Liga since September."

Catalan television TV3 showed a images of a dent on the left front of the sports car, which was parked on the side of a road ""He had a car accident but was not injured and was able to continue his trip,"" a club source told AFP. Neymar can be seen in images published on the club's official web page with other players at the airport. He appeared relaxed, listening to music on earphones as he boarded the flight. Last week Spanish prosecutors asked for a two-year jail term and a 10 million euro ($10.6 million) fine on charges of irregularities during his transfer from Brazilian club Santos to Barcelona."

Enrique's toughest moment as Barca boss also came after a 1-0 defeat to then David Moyes's Sociedad in January 2015 after which sporting director Andoni Zubizarreta was sacked and Enrique also nearly lost his job. ""I am not interested in what happened in the past because it doesn't affect what will happen tomorrow,"" Enrique said on Saturday. ""We are aware of the difficulty of the game but what happened in the past has no influence."" Barca need to avoid another slip up to avoid losing more ground on La Liga leaders Real Madrid ahead of their clash in El Clasico next weekend. Real can extend their lead over Barca to seven points on Saturday with victory at home to Sporting Gijon. Enrique is confident Gerard Pique will be fit to start against Sociedad despite missing training on Friday due to a knock. Andres Iniesta and Samuel Umtiti are not included in Enrique's 18-man squad, but still maintain hope of returning to face Madrid on December 3."
808,25/11/2016,17:02,Taxman targets Real and Barca over fraud: report,"Giants Real Madrid and Barcelona are amongst five La Liga clubs from whom the Spanish taxman is looking to recover 52 million euros, online newspaper El Confidencial claimed on Friday.","Alongside Atletico Madrid, Sevilla and Valencia, the big two are accused of having avoided tax by paying player's agents directly. A tax source told AFP that those payments were in reality, and indirectly, part of the players' salaries. But by paying the agents, the clubs reduced their own VAT obligations while likewise reducing the players' income, and thus income tax -- with the taxman losing out in both instances. El Confidencial said Real owe 11 million euros ($11.7 million) and Barca 12 million euros for deductions that should not have been applied, while the two have been fined five and seven million euros respectively. Atletico must repay four million euros plus a two million euro fine. El Confidencial said the monies owed could be claimed from either the clubs or the players. Contacted by AFP, the Spanish professional League would neither confirm nor deny the reports. But La Liga pointed to efforts made by clubs in the top two Spanish leagues to reduce their tax debts. They currently owe just 230 million euros compared to 650 million euros three years ago. La Liga said last month that neither Real nor Barca owed tax, but Atletico -- the third biggest outfit in Spain -- were amongst six clubs who owed between them more than 70 percent of the outstanding tax. Spanish authorities have been fighting against tax evasion in football for several years now. On Thursday, prosecutors called for Cameroon great Samuel Eto'o to be jailed for 10 years and pay a 14.3 million euro fine over tax fraud during his time at Barcelona. They said the striker, who currently plays for Antalyaspor in Turkey, had defrauded the taxman of 3.9 million euros from 2006 to 2009 through front companies in Hungary and Spain. Current Barca players have also been in trouble with the Spanish taxman. Brazil captain Neymar faces a two-year jail sentence and 10 million euro fine for alleged fraud and corruption in his transfer from Santos in 2013. Earlier this year, superstar Lionel Messi was given a 21-month prison sentence while fellow Argentine Javier Mascherano was handed a one-year suspended sentence, both for tax fraud. Messi has avoided jail as sentences under two years are usually suspended for first time offenders in Spain. According to Deloitte, a multinational professional services company, Real and Barca were the two highest earning clubs in the world in 2015, raking in 577 and 560 million euros respectively."
809,25/11/2016,16:48,Guardiola wants Messi to stay at Barcelona,"Pep Guardiola insisted Friday he had no intention of signing Lionel Messi, saying he wants the Barcelona star to see out his career at the Nou Camp.","Manchester City manager Guardiola has been linked repeatedly with a move for the reigning world footballer of the year. Speculation has intensified because Argentina international Messi's contract with Barcelona expires at the end of next season, and he has so far declined to agree an extension. Guardiola knows Messi well, having managed him for four years at the Nou Camp between 2008 and 2012, during which time Barcelona won the Champions League twice and La Liga three times. However, the City manager believes the forward would be better served by staying at Barcelona, where he has been since the age of 13. ""I told you more than once that Messi will stay at Barcelona and will finish his career at Barcelona,"" Guardiola said. ""It's my wish. I wish that he goes from the beginning to the end at Barcelona."" Reports last weekend suggested City were considering a colossal £200 million ($249 million, 235 million euros) move for Messi, and a contract of £500,000 a week. Luis Enrique, the current Barcelona manager gave a sharp answer when that speculation was put to him before the Spanish giants' Champions League win at Celtic on Wednesday. ""I don't know -- I have no idea,"" he said. Guardiola is monitoring the fitness of Messi's Argentina team-mate Sergio Aguero as he prepares his team for a Premier League visit to Burnley on Saturday. Aguero suffered a foot problem during Wednesday's 1-1 Champions League draw against Borussia Moenchengladbach, but it is not thought to be serious. Guardiola, meanwhile, believes he has enough cover in central defence despite losing captain Vincent Kompany for around six weeks with knee ligament damage. Kompany suffered the 35th injury of his City career as he was forced to come off during last Saturday's 2-1 victory at Crystal Palace, raising the possibility of Guardiola entering the transfer market in January to sign another defender. Guardiola, though, can play midfielder Fernandinho or full-back Bacary Sagna in central defence if necessary, and even has the option to move Yaya Toure there. Toure, recalled to the City team to face Palace for his first appearance since August after resolving a dispute with the manager, famously played as an emergency centre-back for Guardiola in the 2009 Champions League final, when Barcelona beat Manchester United 2-0 in Rome. Guardiola said: ""Yaya can play in many positions but I think we have other options to play as central defenders. ""What happened with Yaya at Barcelona happened once in the final of the Champions League against Manchester United because we had a lot of problems there. We didn't have players - and he played amazing. ""Now Yaya is going to play in more offensive terms and can decide the last terms, to score goals, in our build-up in the last third of the pitch. ""We have other options. Fernandinho can play there, Sagna can play there. At Crystal Palace, after one and a half months injured, Bacary played the first game and he played central defender for many minutes. He was awesome. So we have other options to solve that problem."""
810,25/11/2016,14:27,Iniesta eyes Clasico return after knee injury,"Barcelona captain Andres Iniesta returned to training on Friday following a month out with a knee injury and is hopeful of playing in next month's Clasico, the Spanish champions said.","Iniesta, 32, suffered knee ligament damage in a 3-2 win at Valencia on October 22, but the former Spain star is in line to feature against bitter rivals Real Madrid next Saturday after it was initially feared he could be sidelined for months. The midfielder has started just three league games for Barcelona this season as Luis Enrique's side trail leaders Real by four points after 12 matches. The Catalan giants face a tricky assignment away to fifth-placed Real Sociedad on Sunday, with Barca seeking a first league win at Anoeta since 2007. Turkey international Arda Turan is also unlikely to make the trip to San Sebastian after he missed training due to a fever."
811,24/11/2016,10:34,"Celtic will learn from Euro exit, says Rodgers",Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers said the experience of competing against some of the best players in Europe would prove invaluable for his young side after their Champions League exit.,"Rodgers looked on from the touchline as Lionel Messi inspired Barcelona to a 2-0 win over the Scottish champions at Celtic Park on Wednesday to book their place in the last 16. Celtic can no longer secure even the consolation of a Europa League berth, but Rodgers said his side would learn a lot of lessons from their foray into Europe's elite competition following a two-year absence. ""First and foremost, the challenge was getting into the Champions League,"" said Rodgers, whose side visit Manchester City in their final group game next month. ""Celtic had gone a period of time without qualifying, so we made a huge effort in the summer to qualify. ""There is still one game to go in the competition, but this experience was always going to be invaluable to us. We've got some young players in the team who are going to improve thanks to this. ""I think if you look at the first game (Celtic's 7-0 loss at Barcelona) compared to tonight (Wednesday), we weren't fearful tonight. They pressed well and tactically the players improved. ""It's just about maintaining that standard. They've played three of the best teams in Europe during the course of this competition and we've gradually got better with each game."" Messi, who missed Saturday's goalless draw with Malaga due to illness, provided a fine finish to Neymar's lofted pass to hand Barcelona a 24th-minute lead. The Barca captain, who grabbed a hat-trick in the 7-0 mauling in the reverse fixture, then converted a 56th-minute penalty won by Luis Suarez, leaving his side top of Group C with 12 points from five games. However, Rodgers, who managed Suarez at Liverpool, felt his former player had conned referee Daniele Orsato. ""I didn't think it was a penalty. What Luis is brilliant at is around the box he provokes the defenders,"" Rodgers said. ""I think that he's leaning into Emilio Izaguirre, who is trying to fight for his space. And what Luis is clever at is he grabs hold of the defender and spins round and it looks like he's been pulled to the ground. ""It was a key moment in the game as at the start of the second half we were pressing and we were winning the ball and the momentum was clearly with us."" Barcelona manager Luis Enrique, whose side have made their worst start to a La Liga season since 2004, was pleased to top a tough group above Manchester City and Borussia Moenchengladbach. ""It was quite a hard game and we expected Celtic to come out and make it difficult,"" he said. ""We were good at the back and we got better as the game went on. Messi, as usual, was at a very high level. ""It was a very difficult group and it's great to finish first with a game to spare."" Neymar appeared to be fortunate to escape with just a booking in the match, which will see him miss Barca's final group game, as he pushed Mikel Lustig to the turf after the players had clashed. The Brazil star had earlier learnt that Spanish prosecutors are seeking a two-year jail sentence and a 10 million euros ($10.6 million) fine against him for his part in his allegedly fraudulent transfer to the club. He was subbed moments after clashing with Lustig, but his manager played down the incident. ""It was just in the last five or 10 minutes that there was maybe a bit of an issue with Neymar with regards to the crowd shouting,"" Luis Enrique said. ""It was maybe just handbags with the Celtic player and nothing too special."""
812,23/11/2016,23:18,Messi bags double as Barca see off Celtic,Lionel Messi bagged a brace as he returned to the Barcelona line-up to help them book their place in the last 16 of the Champions League with a comfortable 2-0 win over Celtic on Wednesday.,"Messi, who missed Saturday's goalless draw with Malaga due to illness, provided a fine finish to Neymar's lofted pass to hand his side a 24th-minute lead in Glasgow. The Barcelona captain, who grabbed a hat-trick in the 7-0 mauling in the reverse fixture at the Camp Nou, then converted a 56th-minute penalty won by Luis Suarez to see his side top Group C with 12 points from five games. Manchester City's draw with Borussia Monchengladbach in the group's other match also sent the English side through, with Celtic condemned to a last-place finish behind the Germans. Apart from the injured Andres Iniesta, Barcelona named their strongest 11 as Suarez and Messi returned from suspension and sickness respectively to form their formidable partnership with Neymar in the Barca attack. Both manager and captain had urged Celtic to be brave against the side that had served such a crushing defeat to them in Spain. Certainly Celtic didn't allow the visitors time to dwell on the ball as they pressed high up the pitch early on. However, Barcelona began to probe at the Celtic defence with Mikael Lustig looking particularly vulnerable to the runs of Jordi Alba and Neymar. The Brazilian was first to burst into the Celtic box and teed up Messi with a backheel and the Argentine's deflected shot had Craig Gordon scrambling across his line before it was cleared. Alba was then the provider as his cross from the left found Ivan Rakitic lurking in the box but the Croatian international sent his header bouncing into the turf and over the bar. Celtic failed to heed the warning signs and Barca soon had a deserved lead through Messi. Neymar -- who learned earlier in the day that Spanish prosecutors were seeking a two-year jail sentence and a 10-million-euro ($10.6 million) fine for his part in his allegedly fraudulent transfer to the club -- was given space to play a wonderful lofted pass to Messi, who crashed a sublime shot on the half-volley in off the near post. The hosts tried to respond and had their first shot on target in the 37th minute when Moussa Dembele stung the palms of Ter Stegen with a fierce strike. Only a superb save from Craig Gordon stopped Suarez from adding a second before the break as he blocked a point blank header from the Uruguayan international with his body. Celtic lost Sinclair to injury at the break but his replacement - James Forrest - created Celtic's best opportunity when he picked out Dembele with a cross from the left but the in-form French forward sent a tame header straight to Marc-Andre ter Stegen. It was to prove costly as Barcelona doubled their advantage moments later. Suarez got on the wrong side of Emilio Izaguirre and the Celtic defender hauled him to the ground to earn a penalty that Messi sent straight down the middle to score his 92nd Champions League goal for the Catalan giants. Neymar was fortunate, though, to escape with just a booking, which will see him miss the final group game, as he pushed Lustig to the turf after the players had clashed, with the Brazilian international subbed moments later."
813,23/11/2016,14:11,Spanish prosecutors seek two-year setence for Neymar,"Spanish prosecutors recommended that Brazilian star Neymar be handed a two-year jail sentence and a fine of 10 million euros ($10.6 million) for alleged corrupt practices in his transfer to Barcelona, a court filing revealed on Wednesday.","Prosecutors are also seeking a five-year sentence for former Barcelona president Sandro Rosell -- who resigned over the scandal in 2014 -- on counts of fraud and corruption, but dropped charges against current president Josep Maria Bartomeu. The case initiated with a complaint from Brazilian investment company DIS, which owned 40 percent of Neymar's sporting rights at the time of his transfer from Santos in 2013. In presenting their case on Wednesday, DIS called for five-year sentences for Neymar and his parents, eight years for Rosell and Bartomeu and a mammoth 195 million euro fine for Barca. Sentences of two years or less are habitually suspended for first time offenders in Spain. However, DIS also recommended that Neymar be banned from playing football during any judicial sentence. Barcelona initially announced the cost of the move at 57.1 million euros, 17.1 million of which was paid to Santos with the remaining 40 million paid to N&amp;N, a company owned by Neymar's family. However, Spanish authorities believe the real cost escalated to 83.3 million. DIS received 6.8 million euros, 40 percent of the fee paid to Santos. The company believes it was cheated of its real share because part of the transfer fee was concealed by Barcelona, Santos and the Neymar family. Moreover, DIS also argued a pre-contract agreement between Neymar and Barca signed in 2011 impeded other clubs from making offers for the player, affecting the value of the transfer fee. The decision is another blow to the image of the Spanish champions and the player himself, who signed a lucrative new contract to remain at Barca till 2021 in June. Barca hoped to bring an end to the murky affair when the club agreed to pay a 5.5-million-euro fine in a deal with prosecutors in June to settle a separate case and ensure the club avoided trial on tax-evasion charges over the transfer."
814,22/11/2016,02:00,Top spot at stake as Arsenal host PSG,"worldfootball looks ahead to Wednesday's Champions League action with Arsenal v Paris Saint-Germain the plum tie while Barcelona, Manchester City and Bayern Munich all face challenging away games (kick-offs 1945 GMT unless stated):","<strong>Group A</strong> at London Arsenal (ENG) v Paris Saint-Germain (FRA) The Gunners will be out to put one over the French champions, whom they held 1-1 in Paris, as both struggle for top spot in Group A, the pair having already booked passage to the knockout phase. The Londoners could look to Olivier Giroud, who rescued a point from the bench at Old Trafford, to spearhead their attack after Alexis Sanchez played through hamstring trouble. As Arsenal drew with Manchester United to leave them fourth in the Premier League, PSG warmed up for Wednesday with a fourth straight win, 2-0 over Nantes, as they chase down French leaders Nice. PSG's Old Trafford misfit Angel Di Maria scored against Nantes but came off in the first half with a thigh injury, albeit not one expected to keep him out. Argentine playmaker Javier Pastore is set to miss the trip to London with a knee problem. Ludogorets (BUL) v Basel (SUI) at Sofia Bulgarians Ludogorets and Basel have proved the makeweights in Group A with both garnering a solitary point to date. A Europa League spot is the consolation prize that awaits the side that can cement third place. The two parted 1-1 in the first meeting in Switzerland. Previous encounters saw the Swiss win handsomely in a two-leg playoff three years ago. Ludogorets will be slight favourites, courtesy of home advantage, and they gave Arsenal a brief scare in their last outing, but let slip a two-goal lead to succumb 3-2. <strong>Group B</strong> Napoli (ITA) v Dynamo Kiev (UKR) at Naples Napoli might just about top the group but they are locked in a three-way struggle with Benfica and Besiktas for two places in the last 16. They came from behind to see off Kiev in Ukraine in the reverse fixture and badly need three points here. Their weekend 2-1 win at Udinese kept them in touch with the top four in Serie A, though prolific striker Arkadiusz Milik is still out injured. Lorenzo Insigne grabbed a brace at Udinese and the Italians will be looking to him and Jose Callejon to fire them past Dynamo, the whipping boys of the group with just one point. Besiktas (TUR) v Benfica (POR) at Istanbul (Kick-off at 1745 GMT) Benfica, level on points with Napoli, travel to Turkey's still-unbeaten Besiktas, who are just a point adrift of the top pair. A Benfica victory will take the two-time champions, top in the Portuguese league, through to the knock-out phase. But they cannot afford to be complacent against a Besiktas side which held them to a draw in Lisbon. The Turkish champions are looking to get out of the pool phase for the first time in six attempts and their fans are sure to give Benfica a hostile reception. <strong>Group C</strong> Celtic (SCO) v Barcelona (ESP) at Glasgow Top spot is still up for grabs in Group C as Barcelona, two points clear of Manchester City, travel to a Celtic side they squashed 7-0 at the Camp Nou. A win for Lionel Messi and Co. -- he is set to return after a sickness bug at the weekend -- will see the Spanish champions into the last 16, though a draw might also do it depending on the other game. Luis Suarez will be back from suspension, which is bad news for a Celtic side who are two points adrift at the bottom of the group. The Scottish giants warmed up for Barca with a 1-0 win over Kilmarnock which left them 13 points clear in their domestic league. Borussia Moenchengladbach (GER) v Manchester City (ENG) at Moenchengladbach, Germany City's Yaya Toure-inspired weekend win at Crystal Palace keeps them a point off leaders Chelsea in the Premier League. But it is at the back that they have worries, particularly the fitness of talisman centre-back Vincent Kompany, who suffered a head injury in a collision with keeper Claudio Bravo at Palace. Victory in Germany for Pep Guardiola's side will see them into the next round. The home side look on course for a Europa League slot and need to pull off a surprise win if they are to have any hope of making further progress in this competition. On current form that looks a tall order after successive domestic losses, to Cologne and Hertha Berlin, sent them into the bottom six in the Bundesliga. <strong>Group D</strong> Rostov (RUS) v Bayern Munich (GER) at Rostov, Russia (Kick-off 1700 GMT) Five-time European champions Bayern head to Russia's Rostov for their Group D clash licking their wounds after being knocked from the top of the Bundesliga. Their 1-0 defeat at Dortmund on Saturday allowed RB Leipzig to finish the weekend top of the German league table. Bayern are already into the last 16 but need a win at Rostov to stay in touch with group leaders Atletico Madrid, who they host on December 6 for a potential top-spot decider. Bayern will be without injured keeper Manuel Neuer, meaning Sven Ulreich will deputise. Rock-bottom Rostov and PSV have a single point each so are locked in a struggle for a Europa League place only. The Russians have a solid home record and held Rubin Kazan to a goalless draw on Friday. Atletico Madrid (ESP) v PSV Eindhoven (NED) at Madrid Atletico might already be through and top of the group, but they are on a poor run in the Spanish league. Beaten finalists in two of the last three editions of the Champions League, the Spaniards will qualify as group winners if they win and Bayern do worse. Coach Diego Simeone seems to be losing his iron grip a tad and success built on a rock-solid defence appears to be slipping. Phillip Cocu's PSV will be massive underdogs nonetheless and they only drew 0-0 at lowly Willem II at the weekend in domestic action, with their Dutch championship hopes evaporating slowly."
815,22/11/2016,01:22,Rodgers: Celtic fans right to believe we can beat Barca,Brendan Rodgers says it's a sign of how far Celtic have progressed this season that the club's supporters believe they can defeat Barcelona.,"It is a belief that would have seemed preposterous just two months ago when they watched their side trudge off the pitch at the Nou Camp after suffering a 7-0 mauling at the hands of the Catalan giants. However, positivity abounds at Celtic Park thanks in large to an undefeated start to their Scottish Premiership title defense and a place in the League Cup final, which has given them an air of invincibility domestically. Improvements in Europe have followed with solid performances in their surprise 3-3 draw with Manchester City and a 1-1 draw away to Borussia Monchengladbach, although these results sandwiched a disappointing 2-0 home defeat to the Germans. Celtic's Champions League ambitions are all but gone with the Parkhead club sitting bottom of Group C with two points from their four matches. However, they retain hopes of clinching third spot and a place in the Europa League which would guarantee European football beyond Christmas. To achieve this they will need a repeat of Barcelona's visit to Parkhead in October 2012 when the Glasgow giants secured a shock 2-1 win over the Spanish champions. And former Liverpool boss Rodgers says his side will need to show their teeth if they are to have a chance of emulating that remarkable result. ""Barca have experienced it before, they know it's tough,"" the Celtic boss said. ""But hopefully what we have created here in a short period of time is that we are a team that's not going to wait for opponents. ""We have to be aggressive. We know they are some of the top players ever, but we have to get up to them and see how they cope when you are right at them. ""It is great that we feel that we can win. It's a mark of where the club's going."" Despite the thumping suffering by his side in Spain, Celtic forward Scott Sinclair says the Hoops won't fear Barcelona. ""There's no apprehension. We've learned a lot from that game,"" the former Manchester City player said. ""Even when we went away to Monchengladbach we showed the difference when we conceded. We lost the game at home but we went there and drew. ""I think we've learned a lot and hopefully now we're going in with a positive mindset."" However, the Hoops will face a Barcelona side who also have a point to prove. Luis Enrique's side, the tournament favourites for many, arrive in Glasgow on the back of a goalless draw against mid-table Malaga - the first time they have failed to score at the Nou Camp since February 2015. The Catalan giants have dropped points in four of their 12 matches in La Liga this season to record their worst start to a campaign since 2004. Despite this, Barca remain in second place just four points off old rivals Real Madrid and top Group C with nine points from their four matches. Celtic will also be facing a full-strength Barca, who rested several players for the match against Malaga and were without the suspended Luis Suarez and Leo Messi due to illness. In all the matches that Barcelona have dropped points this season Messi has not featured or lasted the full 90 minutes. Enrique would have been bolstered by his return to training on Monday and the Argentine maestro is expected to take his place in Barca's formidable forward line alongside Suarez and Neymar. Andres Iniesta and Samuel Umtiti remain the only absentees for the trip to Glasgow through injury."

The 22-year-old also showed off his skills on the pitch with a series of left-footed finishes Messi would be proud of in a kick around with Neymar and midfielder Rafinha. ""Impossible to dribble this defender... @justinbieber,"" Neymar posted to his 26 million Twitter followers with a photo of the Brazilian dispossessing Bieber. Hundreds of Beliebers -- as Bieber's dedicated fan base are known -- have queued for up to a month outside Madrid's Palacio de Deportes where Bieber will perform on Wednesday just to get as close as possible to their idol when the gates finally open. However, even a social media phenom such as Bieber can't compare to Messi's numbers. Bieber's 77 million Facebook likes falls 10 million behind five-time World Player of the Year Messi's tally."

Messi returned to training on Monday and looks set to start in Glasgow along with Luis Suarez, who was suspended for Malaga's visit to the Camp Nou. Barca lead Group C by two points from Manchester City with just a point needed from their final two games enough to secure qualification for the last 16."

""I also imagine that Leo Messi will remain for many years at Barca,"" said Enrique ahead of his side's clash at home to Malaga on Saturday. ""It would be beautiful for a player that left his homeland at such a young age and with such hope that he could finish his career as undoubtedly the best player of all-time at the club that gave him the opportunity. ""For me it would be the perfect story."" After extending Neymar's deal to 2021, Barca hope to tie down Luis Suarez to a long-term contract before concluding a new deal with Messi. However, there has been no such rush to extend Enrique's deal, which expires at the end of the season, despite an impressive haul of eight trophies in just over two seasons in charge. ""I have suddenly lost my imagination,"" he replied when pressed over whether he saw his own future at the Camp Nou beyond the end of the season. Barca trail Real Madrid by two points, but only a first Real win in the Spanish capital's derby over Atletico Madrid in La Liga for four seasons later on Saturday will prevent Barca finishing the weekend on top should they register a fifth straight league win. ""I would like both of them to lose,"" quipped Enrique on his preferred outcome of the Madrid derby. Barca will be depleted by the absence of the injured Samuel Umtiti and Andres Iniesta, whilst Suarez is suspended. However, Gerard Pique and Jordi Alba are both fit to return from injury."
819,17/11/2016,02:31,Barca seals massive deal with Japan's Rakuten,Spanish giants FC Barcelona sealed a massive shirt sponsorship deal Wednesday with Japanese online retailer Rakuten worth at least 55 million euros ($59 million) a year.,"One of world football's most lucrative shirt sponsorship deals sees Japan's leading e-commerce company replace Qatar Airways, Barcelona's shirt sponsor since 2013, confirming Asia's appetite for major investment in European football. The deal, which begins in the 2017-18 season, will last for four years. With the pulling power of top stars like Lionel Messi and Neymar, Barcelona's success on the pitch ensures the club exerts a huge draw on advertisers. ""The base contract is 55 million euros per year, with a bonus of 1.5 million euros per year if the club wins the La Liga and five million euros if it wins the Champions League,"" Barcelona's head of marketing, Manel Arroyo, told a news conference at the club's Camp Nou stadium. Qatar Airways were reported to have paid 35 million euros for the final year of their deal taking them up to the end of the 2016-17 season. Barcelona boast some of the world's most recognisable stars -- vital marketing assets for the club's partners -- who have millions of followers on social media, promising invaluable exposure to sponsors. Argentine striker Messi is one of the most popular athletes in the world on social media, with more than 78 million fan followers on Facebook alone. Barcelona's new sponsorship deal however falls short of the seven-year deal which Manchester United signed with Chevrolet which will earn the English club $560 million -- about $80 million (70 million euros) per year. Barcelona -- once renowned for never having had a sponsor on their shirts -- had been looking to replace their Qatar Airways contract which was seen as below market value for a number of seasons. It extended its contract last year with the airline for one year while it looked for a new partner. Rakuten, seeking to boost its global image, is Japan's biggest e-commerce company with more than 13,000 employees in Japan and turnover of more than two trillion yen (18.2 billion dollars) in the first three quarters of the year. The company is already involved in domestic sport in Japan, owning J-League club Vissel Kobe and pro baseball outfit Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles. ""Our great ambition is to turn a Japanese brand into a global brand,"" said Rakuten's co-founder and chief executive officer Hiroshi Mikitani, a personal friend of the club's defender Gerard Pique. Barcelona president Josep Maria Bartomeu said the talks were initiated by Pique, who arranged a dinner last year with Mikitani in San Francisco. ""Asia is a very important market for Barca,"" he added. Barcelona took its first step towards ending its tradition of shunning sponsors on its shirts in 2006 when it agreed to bear the logo of Unicef. In 2011 Qatar Foundation replaced the charity on the club's shirts under a new deal. Qatar Airways signed its first sponsorship deal with the club in 2013. But many of Barcelona's members had expressed their opposition to the club's relationship with the Gulf state. Former club president Joan Laporta had pledged to end the sponsorship deal if re-elected to the post but he was soundly beaten by Bartomeu in the club's 2015 election. Barcelona's new sponsorship deal comes as the club is set to begin work in 2018 on an extensive renovation of their Camp Nou home. The refurbishment will see the capacity of Europe's biggest stadium extended to 105,000 and an open facade to allow views across the city. A budget of 420 million euros has been estimated for the project that will be financed in large part by proceeds from sponsorship.

820,16/11/2016,17:30,Messi will never leave Barca -- club president,Barcelona president Josep Maria Bartomeu predicted Wednesday that Lionel Messi would not only extend his contract with the Catalan club but also end his playing days there too.,"Speaking at the launch of a 55 million euros ($59 million) a year shirt sponsorship deal Bartomeu told journalists he was ""relaxed about Messi's contract"". With the clock ticking and only 18 months left on Messi's deal the club want to extend it, as they did with Neymar and as they are trying to do with Luis Suarez. ""We are all convinced that he will end his playing days at the heart of this club. All the socios (stake-holding fans) believe it, it's just a question of how we get over the line,"" he said. ""This player has led us to our great sporting successes in recent years and he will continue to do so, he's far from finished."" Spanish sports daily Marca had sown doubt over the 29-year-old Messi's future on Monday with claims the Argentine was stalling over a new deal and flirting instead with the idea of joining his former coach Pep Guardiola at Manchester City. Brazilian superstar Neymar signed a new five-year contract with Barcelona in October that will keep the 24-year-old at the Spanish champions until 2021, saying he felt ""at home"" at the Camp Nou. European Golden Shoe winner Luis Suarez said last week negotiations to extend his contract with Barcelona until 2021 were running smoothly."

With the pulling power of top stars like Lionel Messi and Neymar, Barcelona's success on the pitch ensures the club exerts a huge draw on advertisers. ""The base contract is 55 million euros per year, with a bonus of 1.5 million euros per year if the club wins the La Liga and five million euros if it wins the Champions League,"" Barcelona's head of marketing, Manel Arroyo, told a news conference at the club's Camp Nou stadium. Qatar Airways were reported to have paid 35 million euros for the final year of their deal taking them up to the end of the 2016-17 season. Barcelona boasts some of the world's most recognisable stars -- vital marketing assets for the club's partners -- who have millions of followers on social media, promising invaluable exposure to sponsors. Argentine striker Messi is one of the most popular athletes in the world on social media, with more than 78 million fan followers on Facebook alone. Barcelona's new sponsorship deal however falls short of the seven-year deal which Manchester United signed with Chevrolet which will earn the English club $560 million -- about $80 million (70 million euros) per year. Barcelona -- once renowned for never having had a sponsor on their shirts -- had been looking to replace their Qatar Airways contract which was seen as below market value for a number of seasons. It extended its contract last year with the airline for one year while it looked for a new partner. Rakuten, seeking to boost its global image, is Japan's biggest e-commerce company with more than 13,000 employees in Japan and turnover of more than two trillion yen (18.2 billion dollars) in the first three quarters of the year. The company is already involved in domestic sport in Japan, owning J-League club Vissel Kobe and pro baseball outfit Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles. Barcelona took its first step towards ending its tradition of shunning sponsors on its shirts in 2006 when it agreed to bear the logo of Unicef. In 2011 Qatar Foundation replaced the charity on the club's shirts under a new deal. Qatar Airways signed its first sponsorship deal with the club in 2013. But many of Barcelona's members had expressed their opposition to the club's relationship with the Gulf state. Former club president Joan Laporta has pledged to end the sponsorship deal if re-elected to the post but he was soundly beaten by Josep Maria Bartomeu in the club's 2015 election. Barcelona's new sponsorship deal confirms the interest in Asian investors in European football and it comes as the club is set to begin work in 2018 on an extensive renovation of their Camp Nou home.

He will also miss next week's friendly against Ivory Coast in Lens and is unlikely to play in the 'Clasico' against Real Madrid at Camp Nou on December 3.
824,09/11/2016,14:25,Suarez in blockbuster Barcelona extension talks,European Golden Shoe winner Luis Suarez said negotiations to extend his contract with Barcelona until 2021 were running smoothly.,"The 29-year-old, who claimed the award for a second time after finishing top scorer across Europe last season, originally joined Barcelona on a five-year deal from Liverpool in 2014. ""Negotiations are moving along nicely in the right direction,"" Suarez told a press conference in Uruguay, where he is preparing for a World Cup qualifier with Ecuador on Thursday. ""Both parties want this deal to go through,"" said the centre-forward, who scored 40 Liga goals in 35 games last season and 59 goals from 53 games in all competitions. Barcelona-based sports daily El Mundo Deportivo reported on Wednesday the Spanish champions had offered Suarez an improved deal until June 2021, two years beyond his current contract. ""Luis Suarez, ready,"" read its headline, while Marca also reported the imminent deal. ""His salary rise will be substantial,"" said Marca. ""Right now he earns 16 million euros ($17.6 million) a season, his new deal will push that to 25 million euros a season,"" it added. Brazilian superstar Neymar signed a new five-year contract in late October that will keep him at Barcelona until 2021. The deal, which had been agreed in June, includes a buy-out clause of up to 250 million euros as Barca seek to ward off interest from potential suitors. Argentina's Lionel Messi is contracted to Barcelona until 2018 and will be offered a contract extension in the coming months, the club said recently."
825,07/11/2016,18:20,Neymar nears trial over transfer corruption case,"The prospect of Barcelona superstar Neymar standing trial moved closer Monday as a Madrid judge accepted an appeal by prosecutors for corruption charges to be brought against the Brazilian, a court filing said.","The decision overturns a ruling in July that said irregularities detected in the Brazilian's 2013 transfer to Barcelona were an issue for a civil court, not a criminal one. Neymar's parents, Barcelona president Josep Maria Bartomeu and his predecessor Sandro Rosell -- who resigned over the scandal in 2014 -- also face corruption charges. Both the defence and prosecution have 10 days to present their arguments before a final decision over whether the case will go to trial will be made, a statement from Spain's National Court said. Should he be found guilty, Neymar, 24, faces a prison sentence of between six months and two years and a heavy fine. Barcelona said Monday it would appeal the judge's decision, with which it expressed its ""surprise and total disagreement... particularly given that the same magistrate decided to dismiss the case for all the defendants last July."" According to the judge's findings, a pre-contract agreement between Neymar and Barcelona by which the player received 40 million euros ($44 million) in 2011 to ward off competing clubs for his signature ""altered the free market of football transfers."" Bartomeu and Rosell also stand accused of fraud over the transfer. The case initiated with a complaint from Brazilian investment company DIS, which owned 40 percent of Neymar's sporting rights at the time of his transfer from Santos. Barca initially announced the cost of the move at 57.1 million euros, 17.1 million of which was paid to Santos with the remaining 40 million paid to N&amp;N, a company owned by Neymar's family. However, Spanish authorities believe the real cost escalated to 83.3 million. DIS received 6.8 million euros, 40 percent of the fee paid to Santos. The company believe it was cheated of its real share because part of the transfer fee was concealed by Barcelona and Neymar. Moreover, DIS also argued the pre-contract agreement between Neymar and Barca impeded other clubs from making offers for the player, affecting the value of the transfer fee. The decision is another blow to the image of the Spanish champions and the player himself. Barca hoped to bring an end to the murky affair when the club agreed to pay a 5.5-million-euro fine in a deal with prosecutors in June to settle a separate case and ensure the club avoided trial on tax-evasion charges over the transfer. Meanwhile, Neymar also faces tax evasion charges in Brazil."
826,05/11/2016,15:34,Luis Enrique expects Sevilla title challenge,Barcelona coach Luis Enrique believes Sevilla will pose a serious threat to Spain's established top three for the La Liga title this season ahead of his side's trip to the Sanchez Pizjuan on Sunday.,"Sevilla lie fourth after 10 games, but just three points behind leaders Real Madrid, two adrift of Barca and level with Atletico Madrid. ""Without any doubt for what they have shown until now,"" said Enrique on Saturday when quizzed on Sevilla's ability to launch a title challenge. Sevilla have already beaten Atletico in winning all seven home games since Barca last visited in the Spanish Super Cup in August. However, Enrique's men have looked increasingly brittle in recent weeks without the injured Gerard Pique and Andres Iniesta and were beaten 3-1 by Manchester City in the Champions League on Tuesday. Yet, the Barca boss rounded on his critics and called for patience in judging his side until the end of the season. ""If I look at our first 40 minutes in Manchester, I think they are the best minutes of our era since I have been coach,"" he added. ""There is desperation to praise or criticise very quickly, but there has to be more rationality when analysing teams. At the end of the season is when I think it is just. ""You have a very recent example in our first year (2014/15). You (the media) vilified the coaching team and in the end we were the coaching staff that won most titles in the world that year."" Defeat against former Barca boss Pep Guardiola in midweek was Barca's third in their last 12 games. And with Real Madrid facing the easier challenge of Leganes at home and an two-week international break to come, Enrique is determined not to lose more ground in the title race. ""This is like the Tour of Spain or Tour de France (in cycling). You have to try not to lose it in the early stages to get to the key stages with a chance of winning. ""That means getting to February or March with a real and clear chance to win all of the titles. That is our objective."" Pique, Iniesta and Jordi Alba are all missing once more for the trip to Sevilla. Enrique is expected to make just change from the side that started against City with Rafinha or Arda Turan replacing Andre Gomes."
827,02/11/2016,12:34,City masterclass exposes brittle Barca,Defeat to Manchester City shouldn't dent Barcelona's chances of Champions League progression but the manner in which the English side stormed to victory exposed the brittleness of a Barca side badly missing the injured Gerard Pique and Andres Iniesta.,"Barca had won all five previous meetings between the sides over the past two years and a landmark European victory looked set to be beyond City once more when Lionel Messi finished off a lethal counterattack for his 15h goal in his last 13 games against English opposition. ""They were a scandalously good (first) 40 minutes,"" said a far-from-downbeat Barca boss Luis Enrique. ""I think it was one of the best first-half performances from my team (this season), which, in a scenario like this and against such a difficult team, has a lot of merit."" Messi's 21st minute opener was followed by a 15-minute spell of complete Barca domination, but Sergi Roberto's error in gifting the ball away on the edge of his own box turned the game as Ilkay Gundogan levelled before the break for Pep Guardiola's side. Kevin De Bruyne's stunning free-kick and another from Gundogan sealed a 3-1 win after half-time and a famous win for Guardiola against the club he won 30 trophies with as player and coach. Even Guardiola was effusive in his praise for Barca's start. ""The (first) 38 minutes (shows) we cannot compete with the best teams in the world,"" he said. Yet, in seeing their good work of the first 45 minutes so ruthlessly undone by City's power, pace and precision, Barca's dependence on two pillars of the side -- often overlooked due to the presence of Messi, Luis Suarez and Neymar -- was exposed. As well as being a rock at the back, Pique's ability to play out from the back was missed against City's pressing. In his absence, Sergio Busquets had to take even more of that responsibility from holding midfield and was uncharacteristically flustered in consistently giving the ball away. ""Sometimes it is a matter of centimetres between robbing a ball or controlling it,"" said Busquets, who is suffering one of the worst spells of form in his distinguished career. ""When you play against a team like City, they were more efficient."" Busquets's life is further complicated by the absence of Iniesta alongside him in midfield. Without the key cog in assuring quality service to the ""MSN"" frontline, City's pressing managed to short-circuit Barca's midfield after the break. It is no coincidence that Iniesta hasn't started in all three of Barca's defeats in their last 12 games. Worryingly for Enrique, Iniesta and Pique will also miss Sunday's crucial La Liga trip to Sevilla, whilst Iniesta is a doubt for Real Madrid's visit to the Camp Nou on December 3. Despite defeat Champions League progress will be assured for the Spanish champions with just a point at Celtic in three weeks' time. Barca can also secure top spot with four points from their last two games as Borussia Moenchengladbach travel to the Catalan capital on matchday six. Enrique's men retain the better head-to-head record against City thanks to Messi's hat-trick in a 4-0 rout in Barcelona two weeks ago. ""We are calm because it is still in our hands,"" said Suarez. While there is no need to panic, City's second-half showing at the Etihad means at least some of Barca's fear factor will be lost if the two meet again in the knockout phase."
828,01/11/2016,22:49,Guardiola glee as Gundogan guns down Barcelona,Ilkay Gundogan scored twice as Manchester City sank Barcelona 3-1 in the Champions League on Tuesday to give manager Pep Guardiola an electrifying victory over his former club.,"Barca had won 4-0 when the sides met two weeks ago, but although Lionel Messi put them ahead, City stormed back in thrilling fashion as Gundogan scored twice either side of a Kevin De Bruyne free-kick. It ended Barcelona's run of five successive wins over City and moved Guardiola's side to within two points of Luis Enrique's Group C leaders with two games remaining. After the doubts engendered by a recent six-game winless run, this was a resounding validation of Guardiola's principles, City outhustling his old team to give him the first statement win of his nascent tenure. With Celtic holding Borussia Moenchengladbach in the other group game, City can secure a place in the last 16 if they draw in Germany on November 23, when Barca go to Celtic needing a point to progress. Guardiola signalled his greater attacking intent by restoring Sergio Aguero to his starting XI, having left the Argentina striker on the bench for the reverse fixture two weeks ago. The home side should have been awarded a penalty in the 11th minute after Raheem Sterling appeared to be tripped by Samuel Umtiti, but instead referee Viktor Kassai booked the England forward for diving. Sterling was incensed and there was worse to come 10 minutes later as Barca took the lead in devastating style with a move that began with a block from Javier Mascherano inside his own area. Messi, 15 yards outside the box, sprayed a pass wide to Neymar on the left and the Brazilian drove downfield before squaring to Messi, who neatly slotted the ball into the bottom-left corner. Gundogan fired a shot down Marc-Andre ter Stegen's throat at the other end, but for a brief moment it looked like City were on the verge of being swamped as Neymar, Andre Gomes and Luis Suarez threatened. City, though, refused to be deterred and their committed pressing game paid off in the 39th minute. Sergi Roberto's overhit square pass from Barca's right was intercepted by Aguero, who played in Sterling, and he brilliantly rolled the ball across the box to give Germany midfielder Gundogan an easy tap-in. City's tails were up and they almost went ahead two minutes later when Fernandinho's mishit shot eluded the lurking Aguero by inches. The onslaught continued after the break, Sterling fluffing a chance with a heavy first touch and Aguero lashing wide, before Guardiola's men took the lead in the 51st minute. Sergio Busquets's foul on David Silva presented City with a shooting opportunity 22 yards from goal and slightly to the left of centre. De Bruyne administered the sentence, stroking the ball into the top-right corner past the wrong-footed Ter Stegen. Now it was Barca who were rocking, De Bruyne's free-kick just eluding Nicolas Otamendi, Aguero heading Silva's cross wide and Aleksandar Kolarov narrowly failing to pick out the stretching De Bruyne. Back came the visitors, Gomes rattling the bar after John Stones's overzealous tackle sent the ball into Suarez's path, but after De Bruyne had curled a shot a fraction wide, City struck again. De Bruyne was the architect, his exquisite pass behind the full-back finding substitute Jesus Navas, whose cross struck Aguero and fell kindly for Gundogan to kill Barca off for good."
829,31/10/2016,16:14,Guardiola wants 'perfect' City against Barcelona,"Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola has admitted his players must keep their discipline and produce the ""perfect"" performance to beat Barcelona in the Champions League at Eastlands on Tuesday.","Guardiola's side lost 4-0 in their Group C encounter against the Spanish giants at the Nou Camp on October 19 -- their fifth defeat in as many meetings with the Catalan club. City goalkeeper Claudio Bravo was sent off in that match and Guardiola acknowledged the importance of keeping 11 players on the pitch against a side of Barcelona's class. ""We know we need to play almost perfectly,"" Guardiola, who guided Barcelona to two Champions League titles while manager from 2008-12 after starring for the club as a player, told a news conference on Monday. ""It's always difficult in the Champions League. Ten versus 11 against Barcelona is almost impossible. We have to improve that otherwise it is impossible to achieve the target. ""I have never thought we can't win a football match and I will never start to think that way, even though we lost 4-0. We'll give it a go. We know it is difficult and they are a difficult opponent. ""Maybe we are going to change the way we press, the build-up, many things. I would like to play in a good level. What passed in Barcelona, that is not the reason for what it is going to happen here. ""We have to be focused in 90 minutes knowing they are going to provoke our mistakes with the quality they have. In that moment we try to keep going and finish better than in Barcelona."" Barcelona top the group at the halfway point with three victories from their three matches, while City have four points after a draw against Celtic and victory over Borussia Moenchengladbach. Guardiola said the group standings meant Tuesday's match was of greater significance for City than Barcelona. ""It is not a final for them. It is a final for us,"" the 45-year-old explained. ""There are just three games left. We dropped two points in Glasgow against Celtic and we need to recover those points. ""Every manager, every trainer has his plans. We know them, they know us. But football is unpredictable. Hopefully our quality in front can make a difference. ""In the first half we played well at Camp Nou but the two wide players for Barcelona are almost unstoppable. The only thing I can ask of our players is they play the way they know."" With Bravo suspended following his red card in the first fixture, Willy Caballero will start in goal for the match at the Etihad Stadium and Guardiola has every confidence in the 35-year-old goalkeeper. ""He has helped me very much from the first few games,"" Guardiola said. ""I like Willy on a personal level and as a goalkeeper he has played and given a lot of confidence. If he plays well, we're all be happy with him. If he doesn't, then we will support him. But I have no doubts about him."" City forward Nolito also said striker Sergio Aguero will be a key player against Barcelona and insisted his team-mates have the self-belief needed to beat the La Liga champions. ""I think he's one of the best strikers in the world,"" Nolito said. ""And it's a pride to have him in the team and we hope he has one of those days where he scores lots of goals. ""Sincerely, we have to beat Barcelona one day. We have to win this one because of the situation we're in. We have to. Knowing how strong they are we will have to be at our best."""
830,31/10/2016,01:46,Scrutinised Aguero still following Messi's lead,"There is nothing between Sergio Aguero and Lionel Messi off the pitch, but in the Champions League, the Manchester City striker continues to walk in the Barcelona superstar's shadow.","Aguero was dropped for City's game at Barcelona on October 19 and by the time he came on, as a 79th-minute substitute, Messi had set his side en route to a 4-0 win with his 37th career hat-trick. Aguero is expected to start when Barcelona visit the Etihad Stadium on Tuesday, having scored twice in Saturday's 4-0 win at West Bromwich Albion, but manager Pep Guardiola remains on his case. ""He is part of the history of this club and will be forever, but I would like to help him,"" said Guardiola, who enjoyed stunning success with Messi at Barcelona between 2008 and 2012. ""He can still write the most brilliant pages in his career in this club. He's one of the best, absolutely. But I want to help him be much, much better."" While Guardiola is thought to harbour reservations about Aguero's work-rate and overall contribution, he believes that ""in the box"" at least, he is on the same level as Messi. Aguero and Messi have been close friends since they met while playing for Argentina at the 2005 Under-20 World Cup in the Netherlands. Aguero, then playing for Independiente in his homeland, astonished his team-mates by asking Messi who he was, having not recognised the burgeoning star of the Barcelona youth team. But they ended up rooming together and have been international room-mates ever since, Messi penning the foreword to Aguero's 2014 autobiography. Aguero is a year Messi's junior, but in football terms he was more precocious, making his Independiente debut aged just 15. The pair began to cross swords regularly after Aguero joined Atletico Madrid in 2006 and might even have ended up playing in the same team. Former Barcelona sporting director Andoni Zubizarreta revealed earlier this year that prior to signing Luis Suarez from Liverpool in 2014, the club's number-one target had been Aguero. Aguero joined City in 2011 and entered club folklore in his first season by scoring the 94th-minute goal against Queens Park Rangers on the season's final day that gave Roberto Mancini's men the title. He has won four major honours at the Etihad and his brace at West Brom took him to 149 goals in the club's colours, lifting him past City great Francis Lee. Though frequently injured, Aguero has the best minutes-to-goals ratio in the Premier League era and former England striker Alan Shearer believes he is ""the one genuine world-class player"" in the division. But although Aguero is City's leading scorer in European competition, unlike Messi he has yet to leave an indelible mark on Europe's elite tournament. Just two of his 23 Champions League goals have been scored in the knockout phase and he has never gone further than the semi-finals. Aguero has hinted that he was sceptical about the hype surrounding Guardiola, telling Argentine radio that he asked Messi if the Catalan would show him ""how to kick the ball better"". But if Aguero is to scale the same heights as his international room-mate, it is likely to be in his interests to keep Guardiola onside. Guardiola, a two-time Champions League-winner as a coach, has not always seen eye-to-eye with big-name strikers, as Samuel Eto'o and Zlatan Ibrahimovic can testify. In axing Joe Hart and Yaya Toure, meanwhile, he has demonstrated that he will not show undue deference to status at City. While Aguero has scored 13 goals in 13 games this season, Guardiola has regularly exhorted him to ""do more"", and there are signs that the penny may have dropped. According to the BBC, the 28-year-old covered 10.2 kilometres (6.3 miles) against West Brom, which represented a huge leap from last season's average of 7.8km. He may run Messi down yet."
831,29/10/2016,23:47,Luis Enrique seeks more precise Barca for Man City visit,Barcelona coach Luis Enrique insisted his side will need an improved display when faced with the very different challenge of former Barca boss Pep Guardiola's Manchester City after labouring to a 1-0 win over Granada on Saturday.,"Barca travel to Manchester on Tuesday having thrashed Guardiola's men 4-0 less than two weeks ago to take a commanding lead of Champions League Group C thanks to a Lionel Messi hat-trick. However, Messi, Luis Suarez and Neymar endured a rare off night in front of goal as midfielder Rafinha bagged the only goal against an ultra defensive-minded Granada. ""Now we will go to Manchester and in theory we will have a team that presses us high and we'll be left almost one against one,"" said Enrique. ""You have to be very efficient and precise to overcome that pressure. If you overcome it, you are going to have chances and, if not, the opponent will win the ball in your half with quality players."" In contrast to their Champions League position, Barca trail eternal rivals Real Madrid by two points at the top of La Liga after 10 games. However, with four wins in a row in all competitions, Enrique believes Barca are headed in the right direction. ""We are close to the top but we are behind,"" he added. ""There are still almost all the clashes between the title rivals to come, but I think we are headed in the right direction in La Liga and the Champions League."" Rafinha's fine overhead finish was his fifth goal in as many La Liga games as the Brazilian continues to make the most of his opportunities in a Barca squad ravaged by injuries. And Enrique stressed the importance of goals from midfield to back up the threat posed by Messi, Suarez and Neymar. ""He's getting into the box more which is something we always ask of midfield players. ""That's the important thing. We have three unique, incomparable players up front, but the more players we can have taking chances and getting into the box the better. ""It is always a boost for the midfield players to score goals and in Rafa's case he is a player that arrives very well from deep."""

""It is a figure which puts us number one in the world for sponsorship in the sports industry,"" Barca vice-president Manuel Arroyo told the club's annual general meeting on Saturday. ""The fixed rare of the contract increases 48 percent and the royalties also increase. ""From this season (2018-19), the total turnover of the deal will be around 155 million euros."" Barca confirmed in May they had reached a deal to continue their partnership with Nike, which began in 1998, without releasing the value of the deal. The agreement will be a huge boost to Barcelona's aim to be the first football club to break the one billion euro revenue barrier by 2021. The Spanish champions overcame eternal rivals Real Madrid with a record turnover of 679 million euros last season. Members on Saturday also passed a budget of 695 million euros for this season, a massive 392 million of which will go on sporting salaries. However, that figure could even rise as president Josep Maria Bartomeu said the club are working on renewing the contracts of star forwards Luis Suarez and Lionel Messi after Neymar recently extended his deal to 2021. ""These strikers are spectacular. Believe that our principal objective is that they all stay here,"" Bartomeu said of Barca's 'MSN' frontline. ""Neymar has renewed and now we are trying so that Suarez stays here for many years to come and then we will speak with Messi of course. He is the catalyst, the one that makes everything else function."""
833,28/10/2016,14:56,Jealousy provokes Guardiola critics - Luis Enrique,Barcelona coach Luis Enrique believes former teammate Pep Guardiola will succeed at Manchester City and that criticism of his methods are borne out of jealousy.,"Guardiola is in the midst of the worst run of results in his managerial career having not won in six games, including a 4-0 thrashing by Luis Enrique's men on his return to Barcelona last week. ""To the critics of Guardiola it is very easy -- don't worry because he will win for sure,"" Luis Enrique said on Friday. Guardiola's City still top the Premier League on goal difference thanks to a 10-game winning run to start his reign in English football. However, on top of their Champions League struggles, City were also dumped out of the League Cup by Jose Mourinho's Manchester United on Wednesday. ""There is no doubt he will win titles this year and do it playing the same football as the start of the season,"" continued the current Barca boss. ""The critics have to appear because there is nothing worse than watching someone always win. This always generates a lot of jealousy. ""Pep will continue winning and with the arms he considers best, which is playing good football."" Guardiola, who won 14 trophies in charge of Barcelona between 2008 and 2012, and Luis Enrique go head-to-head once more when Barca travel to Manchester on Tuesday. However, the Spanish champions first host La Liga's bottom side Granada at the Camp Nou on Saturday. Barca have been ravaged by injuries in recent weeks with Andres Iniesta, Gerard Pique and Jordi Alba set to miss the trip to City. Yet, Luis Enrique insists there are no excuses as Barca look to remain hot on the heels of La Liga leaders Real Madrid. ""I don't see any problem with the squad that we have,"" he added. ""We can win the upcoming games, which is the objective. Looking for excuses is not how we do things."""
834,27/10/2016,18:56,Barca report 'irresponsible' La Liga chief Tebas,Barcelona reported La Liga president Javier Tebas to Spain's highest sports court on Thursday after he questioned the Barca players' conduct during a heated 3-2 win at Valencia last weekend.,"Luis Suarez and Neymar were hit by a plastic bottle thrown by Valencia fans as Barca celebrated Lionel Messi's 94th-minute winner on Saturday. A disciplinary committee of the Spanish Football Federation fined Valencia 1,500 euros ($1,600) on Wednesday and said a repeat could result in a stadium closure. However, the committee also criticised the ""reproachable behaviour"" of the Barca players as Neymar and Messi were recorded shouting obscenities towards the Valencia fans. ""The most serious thing is the thrown bottle, but some players acted in a way we don't like,"" Tebas said of the incident earlier this week. However, those comments have been branded ""irresponsible and unbecoming of a sports official"" by Barca president Josep Maria Bartomeu. Moreover, in a statement the club invited Spain's administrative sports court to open disciplinary proceedings against Tebas and members of the Spanish federation's disciplinary committee ""for inadmissable assessments of the Barcelona players' behaviour when they were assaulted during the game."""

A disciplinary committee of the Spanish Football Federation fined the home side 1,500 euros ($1,600) and said a repeat could result in a stadium closure. But it also had harsh words for Barcelona, accusing some of their players -- without giving names -- of ""reproachable behaviour"" as they celebrated close to the touchline. However, the Federation stressed that ""nothing, absolutely nothing justifies a violent public reaction"". In response, Barcelona issued a statement calling the criticism of their players ""totally reproachable"". ""The committee should have confined itself to analysing the facts and apply the existing rules,"" the Catalan club said. Barcelona coach Luis Enrique had said in the immediate aftermath of the incident: ""We celebrated as it is normal to celebrate a last-minute winner."""
836,26/10/2016,14:47,Mathieu adds to Barca injury problems,"Barcelona centre-back Jeremy Mathieu joined the club's mounting injury list and faces three weeks out after hurting his right calf, the Spanish champions said on Wednesday.","The Frenchman limped out of Tuesday's 1-0 defeat to city rivals Espanyol in the Catalan Super Cup with tests subsequently revealing a muscular injury. Mathieu's absence further depletes a backline already without first-choice defenders Gerard Pique and Jordi Alba, both of whom were recently ruled out for at least a fortnight. Captain Andres Iniesta suffered knee ligament damage in Saturday's 3-2 win at Valencia and is expected to be sidelined for between six and eight weeks. Mathieu will miss this weekend's league game against Granada as well as next Sunday's trip to second-place Sevilla. The 32-year-old is also suspended for Barca's return fixture against Manchester City in the Champions League on November 1."

""After the first diagnosis carried out at Mestalla, the tests in Barcelona have shown the extent of the injury,"" Barca said in a statement. ""The time out is between six and eight weeks."" Iniesta could now return in time to face Real Madrid in the first El Clasico of the season on December 3. However, he will miss Barca's Champions League trips to Manchester City and Celtic next month. Barca had earlier confirmed Iniesta had injured the lateral collateral ligament in his right knee. Coach Luis Enrique was incensed when Valencia's Argentine midfielder Enzo Perez escaped without even a yellow card for the challenge that caused the injury. ""We saw very clearly from the tackle it was an injury, and a serious one,"" said Enrique. ""We will see tomorrow, but it will be weeks. There wasn't even a yellow card."" Barca's season has been plagued by injuries so far as Lionel Messi has just returned from nearly a month out, whilst Gerard Pique and Jordi Alba were injured in Wednesday's 4-0 win over Manchester City. Messi has returned in fine form, though, as his sixth goal in three games since his comeback deep into stoppage time from the penalty spot moved Barca to the top of La Liga."

Manchester United were reportedly chief among a number of clubs wishing to prise the 24-year-old attacker from Barcelona, where he forms part of an acclaimed triumvirate along with Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez. ""I'm very happy to renew with the club, I feel at home,"" Neymar told Barcelona's official television station. ""I thought, with my family, that it was best for me to stay here,"" he added. The Brazilian has hit 91 goals in 150 matches in all competitions for Barcelona since arriving from the Brazilian club Santos in 2013 in a controversial deal. Barcelona, who underlined their status as European heavyweights with a 4-0 victory over Manchester City in the Champions League during the week, did not give details of how much they would be paying Neymar. ""Neymar Jr extended his deal with FC Barcelona on Friday afternoon, putting pen to paper on his contract at the club's facilities in the presence of president Josep Maria Bartomeu,"" the club said on its website. ""As the club announced, Neymar has signed a five-year deal which will keep him at Barca until 30 June 2021."" In July a Spanish judge ruled that there were irregularities in Neymar's 2013 transfer to Barcelona from Santos, but said it was an issue for a civil court, not a criminal court to settle. Last month authorities reopened the case following a successful appeal by Spanish prosecutors."
840,20/10/2016,18:08,Suarez picks up Golden Shoe after prolific last season,Barcelona's Uruguayan star Luis Suarez on Thursday collected the Golden Shoe award for the leading scorer in Europe last season and admitted he never imagined being the most prolific member of such a star-studded attack.,"""I didn't imagine myself as the top scorer, I only thought about being a champion, winning the Champions League, which I have done,"" said Suarez at a prize-giving ceremony in Barcelona. ""I have team-mates who make it easy but I am not going to take credit from myself because it needs to be done and you need to be in the right place,"" Suarez, 29, said of his goal-scoring exploits. The former Liverpool striker, who moved to the Camp Nou in 2014, scored a remarkable 40 goals in La Liga last season as Luis Enrique's side edged out Real Madrid to take the title. That tally allowed him to pip Argentine striker Gonzalo Higuain, scorer of a Serie A record 36 goals for Napoli, to the award. Cristiano Ronaldo was third with 35 goals for Real. He said of all his goals among those that stood out came in the 4-0 destruction of Madrid at the Santiago Bernabeu. ""There were many beautiful goals, important ones, but the ones I liked the most for what they meant were the two against Real Madrid and one against Atletico Madrid because it allowed us to stay top,"" he said. It is the second time Suarez has won the Golden Shoe -- in 2013-14 he shared the prize with Ronaldo after netting 31 times for Liverpool in the Premier League. Ronaldo has won it a record four times, while Suarez's Barcelona team-mate Lionel Messi is a three-time winner. He gave a nod to Messi and Neymar, the other member of the so-called MSN. ""I am in the best team in the world, with the best players,"" he said. ""When you fix an objective you can reach it but the priority is the collective and winning titles as a team. ""If individual prizes come with that then it's even better. But if it's not me who wins them then let it be Leo or Neymar!"" Suarez is the second Uruguayan to win the trophy after Diego Forlan, who took the Golden Shoe when with Villarreal in 2004-05 and again as an Atletico player in 2008-09."

Pique's injury is expected to rule him out for three weeks, with the Spain pair set to miss league games against Valencia, Granada and Sevilla as well as the return trip to City on November 1. French internationals Jeremy Mathieu, who was later sent off, and Lucas Digne replaced the injured duo at the Camp Nou on Wednesday and will likely see more playing time in the coming fixtures."

""Until the last day I am a coach I will try to play from the goalkeeper,"" said Guardiola. ""Of course you cannot play all the time, but it was a mistake and it sometimes happens."" Bravo enjoyed two almost faultless years at Barca before joining City in August, but has endured a shaky start under Guardiola's firm instructions to build City's attack from the back. ""He (Bravo) has a lot of experience, he is one of the best goalkeepers in the world for the last 10 years, but he will learn and is the first one in the dressing room to apologise."" Bravo's gaffe was just one of many City defensive howlers on the night as Messi took advantage of Fernandinho's slip to give Barca an early lead. Messi curled home a second before Ilkay Gundogan's misplaced pass played in Suarez, who squared for Messi to complete his hat-trick. The scoreline could have been even more embarrassing for City had substitute goalkeeper Willy Caballero not saved a penalty from Neymar before the Brazilian made amends with a brilliant fourth. ""It is always difficult to play in Barcelona with 11 players and with 10 the game was over,"" added Guardiola. ""We created enough chances, we arrive at the byline many times, but with their strikers when they arrive they punish you."" Guardiola won his first 10 games in charge, but City have now failed to win any of their last four matches and the Catalan lamented the series of error-strewn performances affecting his side.

""Starting in Glasgow, own goals in White Hart Lane (against Tottenham), missing penalties, we give a lot for the opponents,"" he added. Guardiola, who won 14 trophies in four years in charge of Barca, has now lost on both occasions he has returned to the Camp Nou after losing 3-0 in 2015 when with Bayern Munich. However, Guardiola's former teammate and Barca boss Luis Enrique agreed Bravo's dismissal changed the game. ""The sending-off was decisive and conditioned the game a lot,"" said Enrique. ""Teams that try to play from the back know those errors can happen and you have to accept it. In the long-run it is more beneficial."" Messi has now scored two hat-tricks in as many games in this season's Champions League as the Argentine showed no signs of rust on his first start for a month after a groin injury. ""We have seen the calm that Messi has to finish inside the area as if he was in the school yard,"" added Enrique. ""If there is anything you can expect of Messi it is that.

844,19/10/2016,22:51,Messi hat-trick punishes Guardiola's error-prone City,Manchester City's Claudio Bravo and Pep Guardiola endured a nightmare return to Barcelona as Lionel Messi's hat-trick spearheaded a 4-0 Champions League rout for the Spanish champions on Wednesday.,"Guardiola led Barca to 14 trophies in a glorious four-year reign between 2008 and 2012, but his homecoming was undone by a series of shocking defensive errors and Messi's clinical touch on his return from injury. Messi pounced on Fernandinho's slip to give Barca a half-time lead before goalkeeper Bravo was sent off for handling Luis Suarez's shot outside the area. Two more sumptuous Messi finishes soon followed and Neymar made amends for missing a penalty with a brilliant individual run and finish for Barca's fourth after Jeremy Mathieu's red card left both sides with 10 men. City now trail Barca by five points at the top of Group C. Guardiola's decision to jettison England number one Joe Hart to bring in Bravo at the start of the season will once again come under the spotlight as the Chilean's difficult start to life at City cost the visitors dearly. However, early on it looked as if Guardiola was to get one over on his former teammate, Barca coach Luis Enrique, as City hemmed the hosts inside their own half and enjoyed the vast majority of possession. The course of the game changed with one huge error on 17 minutes, though, as Fernandinho's untimely slip left Messi free inside the area and he calmly rounded Bravo to slot home on his first start for a month after a groin injury. Barca's injury problems continued as Jordi Alba and Gerard Pique limped off before the break due to hamstring and ankle problems respectively. Bravo rushed from his line to deny Neymar latching onto Samuel Umtiti's brilliant ball over the City defence, whilst Ivan Rakitic headed wastefully wide from a Messi free-kick as Barca threatened a second. Yet, City could easily have been level as Marc-Andre ter Stegen turned Nolito's angled drive behind before the German made a stunning stop from international teammate Ilkay Gundogan. John Stones then headed a golden chance wide, but City were grateful to Bravo again when his outstretched leg denied Suarez before he reacted in time to turn the rebound over his crossbar just before half-time. There was no reprieve for Bravo eight minutes into the second half when he gifted possession to Suarez and then saved the Uruguayan's effort whilst outside his box to prompt an obvious red card. City were still reeling from that blow when Messi curled home at the near post -- a finish reminiscent of his opening goal when Guardiola also suffered a 3-0 drubbing on his only previous return to the Camp Nou as a visiting coach with Bayern Munich two seasons ago. By contrast, Ter Stegen continued to shine at the other end as he produced another stunning save to turn Kevin de Bruyne's low effort to safety. Messi completed his second hat-trick in as many Champions League games this season 21 minutes from time thanks to another City gift. Gundogan this time presented the ball to Suarez, who unselfishly squared for Messi to slot home. Mathieu picked up two yellow cards in three minutes to balance up the numbers on each side. But by then the damage had already been done as after winning his first 10 games in charge, Guardiola's men have now gone four matches without a win. Willy Caballero looked to have saved City from further embarrassment as he stopped Neymar's penalty three minutes from time. But the Brazilian responded in style by dancing past a series of tired City defenders before slotting into the far corner."
845,18/10/2016,20:29,City need time to reach Barca standards - Guardiola,Pep Guardiola insists Manchester City cannot be expected to compete on equal terms with Barcelona due to the clubs' respective history in the Champions League ahead of their showdown clash on Wednesday.,"Guardiola won the Champions League twice in four glorious years as Barca coach between 2008 and 2012 and returns to the Camp Nou for the second time as a visiting boss just two months into his reign at City. ""Manchester City was 35 years without competing in Europe. That is a long time,"" Guardiola said on Tuesday. City reached the last four for the first time in their history last season under Manuel Pellegrini, but lost all four meetings against Barcelona on the only other occasions they've even reached the knockout phase in the previous two seasons. ""You are an important team in Europe when you are in Europe many times. That is the target for Manchester City in the next five, six, seven years, to be competing every year."" Guardiola admitted he felt emotional to return to the club he also captained for the majority of his playing career in the nineties. ""This stadium is part of my life. I grew up here,"" he added. ""I have a lot of passion for the spectators, and we had an unbelievable generation of players. ""It was a part of my life, but I closed the chapter and (as Bayern Munich coach) in Munich I opened a new one and now in Manchester a new one again."" City head to Barcelona on the back of a three-game winless streak after Guardiola won his first 10 games in charge. And the Catalan coach believes he will learn much from how prepared his side are to compete in Europe by facing the best team in the world in his opinion. ""It is a good test for us to know our level against one of the best teams. What I want is the points to be able to go through to the next round and to be ourselves,"" he continued. ""I need to know as soon as possible where is my team and tomorrow we will see if we have the level (to compete)."" City will be faced with a fit-again Lionel Messi after he netted on his return from a groin injury against Deportivo la Coruna at the weekend. ""I am happy he is back. It is always a joy to watch him play,"" insisted Guardiola, despite the damage the Argentine could wreak upon the City defence. ""I don't know what instructions I can give the defenders so stop his talent."" And Guardiola spurned City fans' faint hopes that he could tempt Messi to swap Barcelona for Manchester. ""I didn't phone Messi this summer,"" Guardiola said, swatting away speculation he had tried to lure a series of high-profile players away from the Camp Nou. ""Messi is the one that will decide when and if he leaves Barca."""
846,18/10/2016,14:11,Pique: Guardiola changed Barca forever,Pep Guardiola's legacy at Barcelona will never be forgotten according to Barca defender Gerard Pique ahead of Guardiola's return to the Camp Nou as Manchester City manager on Wednesday.,"Pique was a major part of the Guardiola side that won 14 trophies in a golden four-year period between 2008 and 2012. ""Pep made a mark on all of us that were with him, there was a before and after. We understood football in a different way and he changed the history of the club,"" said Pique on Tuesday. ""I only have complimentary words for him. He gave me the opportunity to come here and gave me everything."" City travel to the Camp Nou without a win in three games as draws at Celtic and home to Everton sandwiched Guardiola's first defeat in England at Tottenham Hotspur. However, Pique believes City are already a more dangerous prospect than in the four meetings between the sides in the last 16 of the Champions League in 2013/14 and 2014/15 when Barca emerged victorious on all four occasions. ""I think Manchester City is a different team from last year or the years they came here with (Manuel) Pellegrini,"" added the former Manchester United man. ""The style of play is different. They pressure a lot really high, they try to have the ball and create chances and I think they play like us because Pep Guardiola was here many years. ""He understands football the same way we do. It will be a really challenging game."" Barca hold a two-point lead over City at the top of Champions League Group C. Pique believes victory will prove a ""gigantic step"" not only towards qualification for the knockout stages, but also topping the group ahead of his former boss. And the five-time European champions' chances will be massively boosted by the return of Leo Messi from a groin injury. Messi took just three minutes to score on his return from a groin injury as a substitute in Saturday's 4-0 win over Deportivo la Coruna. However, he is expected to start alongside Neymar and Luis Suarez up front for just the fourth time this season. ""It doesn't matter if he is 100 percent or 10 percent, he is so different and so good just his presence on the pitch makes a difference for us and the other team,"" added Pique. ""Leo looks fine, you saw it only took him three minutes to get going. ""He is the best player in history. I've known him since he was 13. We don't put all the pressure on him, though, Leo with Argentina doesn't always win. The team has to perform because it is impossible to win with just one player."" Barca boss Luis Enrique should have the luxury of naming his strongest side as full-backs Jordi Alba and Sergi Roberto also took part in training on Tuesday and are set to return after missing the Deportivo game through injury."
847,18/10/2016,02:05,Guardiola heads home seeking break from away day blues,"For one of the most decorated coaches of all-time, boasting a 75 percent career win percentage and 21 trophies, Pep Guardiola's record of two wins from his last 11 away Champions League matches is an uncharacteristic stain.","Manchester City's long court of the Catalan was not just to dominate at home, but secure City's place amongst the European elite by winning the Champions League. Despite reaching the last four for the first time in their history last season, Guardiola insists they are far from the finished article. ""If you ask me if we are ready to compete in Europe, then we are not ready,"" he said last month despite a stunning 10-game winning run to start his tenure. That streak, though, was snapped on their first trip in the Champions League proper in a pulsating 3-3 draw at Celtic three weeks ago. Guardiola summarised the madcap 'Battle of Britain' in a famously raucous Glasgow atmosphere as a ""good test"" of where City are away from home in Europe. Yet, as he returns to the club that made him as a player and a coach in Barcelona on Wednesday, Guardiola and City will get a far better look into how far they have to go to be Champions League contenders. ""The last decade, the last 15 years they dominate football the way they play,"" said Guardiola after Saturday's 1-1 draw with Everton. ""Barcelona is special (in) the way they play because it is a machine."" Much of that dominance and style of play is thanks to Guardiola. His 2008-2012 vintage side that won 14 trophies and even more hearts for its mix of intense pressing and penetrating passing is widely regarded as the best Barca team of all-time. However, the political machinations and media demands, not to mention two years of baiting by then Real Madrid boss Jose Mourinho took its toll. ""Four years as coach of Barcelona is an eternity,"" he said when announcing his resignation in April 2012. ""I am empty and I need to replenish myself."" He did so firstly via a sabbatical in New York and then three largely successful years at Bayern Munich that lacked a crowning glory - winning the Champions League. That he fell that step short with Bayern is due to three visits to Spain in the semi-finals for the past three seasons. Each time he left defeated without even managing to score a goal. Under his old teammate Luis Enrique, Barcelona have moved on too. A Lionel Messi-inspired 3-0 win over Guardiola's Bayern in 2015 allowed Enrique to equal his friend's remarkable achievement of delivering the treble in his first season in charge. The style has been tweaked too. Whereas the midfield axis of Xavi and Andres Iniesta used to provide Messi as the focal point of the Barca attack, the Spanish champions can now call upon three of the deadliest strikers in the world. Luis Suarez and Neymar complement Messi's skill set and give Barca a counter-attacking dimension not so prevalent in the Guardiola era. ""They are three amazing players in front,"" added Guardiola. ""They are amazing on the counter-attack and they have a good build-up, so they are a good team."" Guardiola will be warmly welcomed by the vast majority in the stands and his old charges on the pitch, if not in the presidential box where old political divides remain. That has much to do with the reason why Guardiola has only been back to the Camp Nou one other time than Bayern's visit in the past four years. Sitting next to his father as a fan rather than an invited guest, Guardiola howled in astonishment at a virtuoso Messi display as Barca beat City 1-0 in March 2015. Only a series of outstanding saves from Joe Hart prevented more severe punishment for the City that night. Having unceremoniously expeditated England's number one for another former Barca man in Claudio Bravo, the first cracks in the Guardiola reign may begin to form if Barca prove a gulf still exists between the two on Wednesday."

Mascherano's buyout clause is set at 100 million euros ($110 million)."

""It is the perfect way to go into the game against City on Wednesday for the result and for the way in which we got the result in a tricky week for us with the majority of the players away with their national teams,"" said Enrique. ""We have Leo back and it took him no time to be back in top form."" By contrast, City will travel to the Camp Nou without a win in three games as Guardiola's men saw two penalties saved by Maarten Stekelenburg in a 1-1 draw with Everton on Saturday. Barca have had the better of City in the Champions League, winning all four clashes between the sides in the last 16 in the 2013/14 and 2014/15 seasons. However, Enrique insists City will be a new and improved threat on the European stage under his former teammate Guardiola. ""It is a great way to prepare for a very attractive game for us against an opponent that is continuously improving, and will continue to do so based on what we have seen so far and because of the coach they have."""
850,14/10/2016,12:05,Pique eyes Barcelona presidency,Barcelona defender Gerard Pique believes he can take the unusual route into club politics rather than management when his playing career comes to an end by becoming Barca president.,"The Catalan giants are run by a president voted for by the club's near 150,000 members with mandates lasting up to six years. ""I want to be president of Barca. It is the step I would like to take when I retire. I don't see myself as a coach, I don't think I would enjoy it that much,"" Pique told Catalan TV station TV3. ""I could do very well for this club as president because it is my passion."" Pique, 29, announced his decision to retire from international football after the 2018 World Cup earlier this week due to the latest in a series of attacks on his commitment to play for Spain. During Spain's 2-0 win at Albania on Tuesday was falsely accused of cutting the colours of the Spanish flag off his long-sleeved shirt as the colours appeared only on the short-sleeved version of the shirt. Pique has also been consistently jeered by Spain fans when playing for the national team, in part due to his public barbs at Real Madrid and for his outspoken support for a referendum on Catalan independence. ""I have positioned myself on the right to decide and I continue to believe that. In a democratic country like Spain, the right (for the people) to decide is the most democratic thing there is."" However, Pique has never explicitly stated he would vote for independence in the case of a referendum. ""If you choose one side or the other you get scolded. There is no doubt about that. I haven't chosen and I have been scolded. Imagine if I had."""
851,13/10/2016,20:56,Bloodied Neymar to continue with flashy style,"Brazilian striker Neymar has vowed to continue to produce his trademark dribbles and dummies even if that makes him a target for rough tackles, he said on Thursday.","Neymar was left heavily bleeding from a cut eyebrow when he was elbowed in the face during a 5-0 World Cup qualifying win over Bolivia last week. While some commentators have suggested the player's style is provocative, the 24-year-old Barcelona marksman was unrepentant about his flashy football. ""I won't change. (The other team) know that when I go on the pitch I play my game and my game is like that, dribbling, scoring goals and creating them for my teammates. I'm happy playing that way,"" he said. Barcelona coach Luis Enrique was equally dismissive of critics. ""He plays like that whether opponents like it or not,"" The coach said last month. Spanish champions Barcelona are currently down in fourth in La Liga after a 4-3 defeat to Celta Vigo two weeks ago and have a blockbuster Champions League clash against Pep Guardiola's Manchester City on Wednesday. Enrique will be banking on Neymar for the visit to Deportivo La Coruna on Saturday with Lionel Messi starting on the bench and Luis Suarez out injured. But Neymar was keen to be reunited in a match with his strike partners after training with them on Thursday. ""We are fiends on and off the pitch,"" he said. ""The magic of this trident is friendship. We help each other, together we are stronger."" Neymar has had a restful week after an international suspension saw him return to the Catalan capital early while Brazil won 2-0 at Venezuela on Tuesday."
852,12/10/2016,13:27,"Barca-Real 'Clasico' given Asia, US-friendly slot","December's first high profile clash of the season between Barcelona and Real Madrid will take place at a time that suits Asian and North American television audiences, La Liga's president said on Wednesday.","The 'Clasico' will take place at 4.15pm (1515 GMT) at Barca's Camp Nou on December 3. La Liga president Javier Tebas said three time slots had been considered before agreeing on the one that would suit both the Asian and North American markets. ""There are seven hours difference with Asia and playing at 6.30pm was too late. And playing at 1pm was too early for the American market,"" Tebas told Spanish radio station Cadena Ser. The 'Clasico' is a crucial product for La Liga who publicise it as the most-watched club match in the world with 600 million TV viewers."
853,12/10/2016,13:09,Messi back in Barcelona training,Global superstar Lionel Messi returned to training with Barcelona on Wednesday following three weeks out with a groin injury.,"France international defender Samuel Umtiti also returned to training according to a statement on the Catalan giants' website. ""Both Leo Messi and Samuel Umtiti, despite neither yet being declared fit for selection as they battle to recover from injury, were able to join the rest of the team for the workout,"" said the statement accompanied by a photo showing Argentine Messi at training. The statement also said the likes of Spanish internationals Andres Iniesta, Gerard Pique and Sergio Busquets had returned following the international break. Pique was in the photo alongside Messi and Brazil's Neymar. Messi, 29, tore a muscle in his groin during the 1-1 draw at home to La Liga title rivals Atletico Madrid on September 21. Umtiti, 22, had strained a ligament in his knee the day before in training. The returnees provided a welcome boost for Barca who saw Spanish full-back Sergi Roberto and back-up goalkeeper Jasper Cillessen of the Netherlands return from international duty injured. Another full-back, Jordi Alba and Croatia midfielder Ivan Rakitic are also out. Barca host Deportivo La Coruna on Saturday before Manchester City visit the Camp Nou next week for a crucial Champions League tie, with the Premier League outfit's Catalan coach Pep Guardiola returning to the club he led to two European titles during a glorious four-year spell. Barca have had an inconsistent start to the season, thrashing the likes of Real Betis (6-2), Celtic (7-0) and Sporting Gijon (5-0) but losing 2-1 at home to Alaves and falling 4-3 at Celta Vigo. They currently sit fourth in La Liga, although only two points behind leaders Atletico. They top their Champions League group after winning their opening two games against Celtic and Borussia Moenchengladbach (2-1)."
854,10/10/2016,19:27,"Roberto, Cillessen add to Barca injury list","Full-back Sergi Roberto and goalkeeper Jasper Cillessen have returned to Barcelona from international duty injured, the Spanish champions said on Monday.","Dutch back-up keeper Cillessen is expected to be out for three weeks after suffering an ankle ligament injury while Roberto also faces a spell on the sidelines with a groin injury picked up during training with Spain. Barcelona were already without several first-team players. Full-back Jordi Alba, who was injured in Spain's 1-1 draw with Italy last week, is expected to be out for 10 days while Croatia midfielder Ivan Rakitic (Achilles tendon) and French defender Samuel Umtiti (knee) are also on Barcelona's growing injury list. But at least Lionel Messi is on track to return in the coming week from the groin injury he sustained last month. Barcelona, fourth in La Liga, host Deportivo La Coruna on Saturday and then face Manchester City -- led by former Barcelona coach Pep Guardiola -- in the Champions League on October 19."
855,06/10/2016,18:33,"I owe my success to Cruyff, says Guardiola",Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola has saluted Barcelona and Dutch legend Johan Cruyff as the inspiration behind his incredible success.,"Guardiola has established himself as one of the finest managers of his generation after winning a host of trophies with Barcelona and Bayern Munich. The 45-year-old played under Cruyff when the Dutchman was in the process of becoming one of Barcelona's most iconic coaches and Guardiola believes the lessons he learnt from that period laid the foundations for his own impressive achievements in the dug-out. Cruyff died of lung cancer in March, but his legacy lives on in former players such as Guardiola, who have captured his purist principles in their own teams. ""I was a lucky guy, I coached City, Bayern and Barca because I met him,"" Guardiola said, speaking at the London launch of the autobiography ""Johan Cruyff: My Turn"". ""I thought I knew about football but when I met him, a whole new world opened in front of me. ""He taught us -- not only me, but to a generation of players -- to understand the game, to understand why you took that decision. ""Football is the most complicated game, it's very open and you have to take a lot of decisions. ""His impact on people was enormous."" Guardiola won the European Cup as a player during Cruyff's reign, a golden period which included four successive league titles for the ""dream team"". Cruyff, of course, was also a sublimely gifted forward for Barcelona, Ajax and the Netherlands. While Guardiola was a successful midfielder in his own right, he never hit the heights Cruyff did. Guardiola has outstripped Cruyff as a manager however after winning the Champions League twice as Barcelona manager. The Spaniard also won three La Liga crowns with Barca, then added three German league titles at Bayern Munich before joining City earlier this year. Guardiola said he admired the way Cruyff could connect with his players and make them commit to his cause while also maintaining his belief football should be played in an entertaining fashion at all times. ""He wasn't sitting during the training sessions, he was playing with us, but better than us,"" Guardiola said. ""He would not tell us how to do things, he would do them. Every single training session was a masterclass. ""He had knowledge, charisma, personality. Everyone knows about football, everyone, but there's not many people that you will follow if he tells you to. You followed him. ""He was the most courageous manager I ever met... he believed in the 'efecto mariposa' (butterfly effect), that a good pass at the beginning could create a wonderful thing at the end."""
856,04/10/2016,14:02,Rakitic joins Modric in Croatia sickbay,"Croatia's midfield general Ivan Rakitic has pulled out of World Cup qualifiers against Kosovo and Finland because of a painful achilles tendon, his club Barcelona said on Tuesday.","The loss is a major headache for Croatia coach Ante Cacic because his other top midfielder, Real Madrid's Luka Modric, has already been ruled out of the games on Thursday and Sunday by a knee injury. All six teams in Group I have a single point from matchday one of the European qualifiers in a tough-looking pool which also includes Iceland, Turkey and Ukraine. Croatia were one of the more exciting teams at Euro 2016 where they ran Spain ragged in a 2-1 group phase win before a wily Portugal edged the Croats 1-0 in extra-time of the quarter-finals."
857,03/10/2016,02:00,Errant Ter Stegen won't change despite Barca defeat,Barcelona goalkeeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen insisted he won't change his flamboyant style despite a huge error costing the Spanish champions a 4-3 defeat to Celta Vigo on Sunday.,"Three Celta goals in 11 first-half minutes from Pione Sisto, Iago Aspas and a Jeremy Mathieu own goal had Barca on the ropes before a second-half revival saw Gerard Pique and a Neymar penalty haul the visitors back into the game. However, the German goalie then chipped the ball onto the head of Pablo Hernandez for Celta's fourth to end hopes of a heroic comeback before Pique headed home Barca's third late on. ""If I don't make that mistake we had a good chance to win the game,"" said Ter Stegen. ""It is a mistake that I cannot make. It's my fault, but, although it's happened, I won't entirely change the way I play."" Ter Stegen set a La Liga record for passes completed by a goalkeeper earlier this season at Athletic Bilbao and Pique defended the 24-year-old's ability to set up Barca's attack from the back. ""We know Marc is very good with his feet. He gives us a lot and many good moves begin thanks to him,"" said Pique, who nearly capped a sensational hat-trick when he headed wide in stoppage time. ""We all make mistakes and knowing him it won't affect him."" Defeat means Barca missed out on the chance to move top on a wild day of La Liga action as Real Madrid drew for the fourth consecutive game as they were held 1-1 at home by Eibar. Atletico Madrid and Real lead Barca by two points after Atletico shrugged off seeing two penalties saved to beat Valencia 2-0. ""We were much better in the second half. We had nothing to lose and it nearly worked out for us,"" added Pique. ""The positive thing to take from the game is the reaction of the team in the second-half. ""There is a long way to go. Everyone is very tightly bunched and dropping points. That is the level of our league."" Barca improved markedly with the introduction of Andres Iniesta after the break on his 600th appearance for the club. However, the Spanish international admitted defeat took the shine off that landmark. ""It is a bittersweet feeling evidently with the defeat,"" said Iniesta. ""More than just numbers it signifies many years competing at a high level and I have the motivation to continue for many more. ""The defeat hurts given the situation and opportunity we had to go top, but we were punished for those three goals in the first-half. In the second half we had chances, but it wasn't to be."
858,01/10/2016,14:45,Luis Enrique hails values of 600-game Iniesta,Barcelona boss Luis Enrique lauded Andres Iniesta's behaviour as well as his ball skills ahead of the midfield maestro's 600th Barca game at Celta Vigo on Sunday.,"Along with Lionel Messi, Iniesta is Barcelona's most decorated player ever with 29 trophies, but is even more loved across Spain for his winning goal in the 2010 World Cup final. Iniesta is second behind only former teammate Xavi Hernandez as the player to make most Barca appearances. ""I had the luck to play with him and now to coach him,"" said Enrique on Saturday. ""To evaluate these 599, possible 600 games tomorrow, is something that can only make everyone proud and not just for his performances. ""We can only enjoy him. Not just for what he has achieved, but how he has achieved it. For the values he has shown and what he represents to world football."" Barca will once again be without the injured Messi for Enrique's return to Balaidos on Sunday. Enrique took charge of Celta for a season before returning to Catalonia in 2014, but endured an unhappy return last year as Celta inflicted his heaviest ever defeat as Barca boss in a 4-1 thrashing. ""Celta are a dangerous team for the players and idea they have of how to play,"" added Enrique. ""They demand the most of you with and without the ball and make the games great to watch for the fans, but as complicated as possible for the players."" Paco Alcacer is expected to drop out of the Barca side that won 2-1 at Borussia Moenchengladbach in midweek with the in-form Arda Turan taking his place alongside Luis Suarez and Neymar in attack."
859,30/09/2016,01:45,Spain's big three renew title battle,"After another stellar week for Spanish clubs in the Champions League, Real Madrid, Barcelona and Atletico Madrid resume their three-way battle for La Liga supremacy on Sunday.","Real were the only Spanish side not to win in midweek, but got a creditable 2-2 draw at Borussia Dortmund to remain on course for the last 16. However, the European champions have now failed to win any of their last three games as draws to Villarreal and Las Palmas have seen their lead at the top of the table whittled down to just a point by Barca. Zinedine Zidane's men conceded a late equaliser for the second time in four days in Dortmund, but defender Danilo insisted Eibar will bear the brunt of Real's frustration when they visit the Santiago Bernabeu this weekend. ""We drew again, but we are playing well and we're calm,"" said the Brazilian international. ""We are not satisfied with the draws but Eibar will pay for that at the weekend."" Real are still without the injured Brazilian duo of Casemiro and Marcelo, but Zidane is likely to rotate his squad again with Alvaro Morata, Marco Asensio and Pepe in contention. Eibar have never taken a point off Madrid in their history, but travel to the Bernabeu full of confidence after a fine start to the season that has carried the Basque minnows to eighth in the table, just four points behind Real. Barcelona continued to shrug off the absence of Lionel Messi as they came from behind to beat Borussia Moenchengladbach on Wednesday and face a third away game in a week when they travel to Celta Vigo. Arda Turan came off the bench to turn the game in Barca's favour with the equaliser in Germany and is expected to start in Messi's place on the right side of the front line alongside Neymar and Luis Suarez in Vigo. ""All my players are full of confidence. I am happy with how all of them are performing,"" said Barca boss Luis Enrique ahead of his return to the club he managed for a season before taking charge of the Catalan giants in 2014. Sergio Busquets admitted Barca do still desperately miss Messi. ""We always miss Leo. When you win by the slimmest margin, you notice it more."" Atletico secured the best Champions League result of the three Spanish giants as they repeated their 1-0 semi-final success over Bayern Munich from last season to seal a superb September. After disappointing draws to open the campaign against newly promoted Alaves and Leganes, Atletico reeled off five wins in six games in the past month, only failing to win in a 1-1 draw at Barcelona, to close to within two points of city rivals Real at the top of the table. ""In life there are moments that are difficult to repeat and we are living one of those in terms of our ownership, football, fan base and a fantastic new stadium to come,"" said Atletico boss Diego Simeone. ""They are moments that can't be repeated."" Atletico can go top for a few hours at least as they kick off Sunday's programme away at Valencia. Caretaker boss Voro will once again take charge of Valencia after leading Los Che to their first two wins of the season since Pako Ayestaran was sacked to move them out of the relegation zone.

860,29/09/2016,02:10,Fewer errors was key to Barca fightback - Pique,Gerard Pique said committing fewer second-half errors was the key to Barcelona's 2-1 come-from-behind victory at Borussia Moenchengladbach on Wednesday as they proved they can win in the Champions League without injured Lionel Messi.,"Thorgan Hazard -- the younger brother of Chelsea midfielder Eden -- gave Gladbach a shock yet deserved first-half lead at Borussia Park. But goals in the final 25 minutes, from Arda Turan and Gerard Pique, sealed Barcelona's second Group C win after their 7-0 hammering of Celtic at the Camp Nou a fortnight ago. ""They scored with the only chance they had in the first half, but the game is 90 minutes long and they put in a huge effort,"" said match-winner Pique. ""They didn't have the same legs in the second half and we made fewer mistakes in midfield. ""By losing possession less and them running less they had fewer counter-attacks and it was more difficult for them. ""Overall, I think we were better and it is a deserved result."" Barca fought back when Neymar shook off his marker to float a pass over the top of the Gladbach defence and Turan won the race to the ball before drilling his shot home on 65 minutes. The winning goal came just nine minutes later. Neymar's corner was deflected into the path of Suarez, who was unmarked in the area. He slammed in a powerful shot which was blocked by goalkeeper Yann Sommer, but Pique was on hand to tap home the loose ball from close range. ""It was a set-piece, I was set up to block and I went for the rebound. I saw the 'keeper was a bit unsure and I managed to score the goal,"" explained Pique. Barca coach Luis Enrique cut a relieved figure after the final whistle at Borussia Park. ""We created chances in the first half too, but they are on a great run and it showed,"" he said. ""We weren't totally clear in our play in the first half, but they took their chance and we didn't. ""We were much better in the second half and got the victory that helps us a lot."" Gladbach saw an 11-match winning streak at home come to an end as they were left with nothing to show for an impressive display in which they refused to be overawed by the Spanish giants. ""The team gave it everything and came out of this with some credit. We can be proud,"" said Gladbach's sporting director Max Eberl. Gladbach did much better than in their 4-0 loss at Manchester City last time out, but winger Patrick Herrmann admitted it was hard to put the brakes on the Spanish giants. ""We did brilliantly to go 1-0 up, but Barcelona are such a quality side -- you have to stay focused for the entire 90 minutes,"" he said. ""If you don't, they take full advantage. We wanted to win the game and it was a close-run affair in the end, but not the result we wanted."" Gladbach's next Champions League outing is away at Celtic next month, while Barcelona prepare for a home clash with City as Pep Guardiola returns to the Camp Nou."

But goals in the final 25 minutes, from Arda Turan and Gerard Pique, sealed Barcelona's second Group C win after their 7-0 hammering of Celtic at the Camp Nou a fortnight ago.

We wanted to win the game and it was a close-run affair in the end, but not the result we wanted."" With Messi out due to a groin injury, Barca coach Luis Enrique opted to start Spain international Paco Alcacer in the superstar's place alongside Neymar and Luis Suarez. But as Gladbach coach Andre Schubert had predicted in the pre-match press conference, the hosts refused to be overawed by their illustrious opponents. Neymar and Suarez were rarely allowed more than a split-second on the ball. Gladbach had the better of the opening exchanges at Borussia Park and fulley merited their lead. Referee Damir Skomina missed a handball in the area when the ball clipped Gerard Pique's arm from Hazard's cross in the first five minutes, but then Gladbach took the lead with their first dangerous attack. Raffael dispossessed Sergio Busquets and broke into the Barca half before feeding Mahmoud Dahoud, who timed his pass into the box perfectly, flicking the ball into Hazard's path. The midfielder stabbed his shot past goalkeeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen on 34 minutes, to the delight of the home fans and Enrique's horror. It was clearly not the homecoming ter Stegen had envisaged, having left Gladbach in 2014 for Barca after 18 years with the Bundesliga club. Gladbach managed to disrupt Barcelona's game until just after the hour mark. Germany midfielder Christoph Kramer was subduing Neymar while Dahoud was the creative spark in midfield. Turan came on for Ivan Rakitic on the hour mark and it proved to be an inspired switch as he scored five minutes later. Neymar finally shook off Kramer to float a pass over the top of the Gladbach defence. Turan won the foot race to the ball and drilled his shot past Gladbach goalkeeper Yann Sommer on 65 minutes The winning goal came just nine minutes later. Neymar's corner was deflected into the path of Suarez, who was unmarked in the area. He slammed in a powerful shot, which was blocked by Sommer, but Pique was on hand to tap home the loose ball from close range, to Enrique's delight."

They aren't just dangerous with the ball, they also attack early and high up the pitch,"" said Barca's coach in Tuesday's press conference. ""We'll have to play like we always do, we'll have to position ourselves well and deal with them quickly."" The Barca boss was talking up the hosts' chances at Borussia Park, but Gladbach will struggle to contain the Spaniards, even without groin-injury victim Messi. Barcelona opened their Group C campaign a fortnight ago with a 7-0 drubbing of Celtic at the Camp Nou, while the Germans suffered a 4-0 defeat at Pep Guardiola's Manchester City. Messi missed Saturday's 5-0 thrashing away to Sporting Gijon and is due to also sit out their forthcoming Spanish league match at Celta Vigo. In his absence, Luis Suarez and Neymar came to the fore at Gijon, who played the final 10 minutes with 10 men, as Suarez opened the scoring before Neymar netted twice in the closing stages. Javier Mascherano, Jordi Alba, Ivan Rakitic and Andres Iniesta were all rested at Sporting and the quartet are expected to return in Germany. With Rakitic and Iniesta returning to the midfield, Turkey international Arda Turan is likely to move forward to accompany Suarez and Neymar. ""It is important from the outset to be focused, to build confidence in our own strengths and to unsettle the opponent at the same time,"" added Enrique. ""This is especially important against Gladbach, they have incredible statistics at home."" Gladbach have won all three home games this season in Germany's top flight and they can expect passionate support at Borussia Park. It will be an emotional homecoming for ex-Gladbach goalkeeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen, who left for Barca in 2014 after 18 years. ""Ter Stegen has improved in every respect, both in personal and footballing terms,"" said Enrique. ""He speaks Spanish and even understands a little Catalan. ""He has accepted the challenge to move to Barca and face the competition."" Ter Stegen has already lifted the Champions League title, after Barca won the 2015 final in Berlin, and the Germany goalkeeper is relishing his Gladbach return. ""It was a pleasure to spend 18 years here, but since the transfer, everything changed for me,"" he said. ""Barca has been a good experience and I still have a lot of years in front of me here. ""It's of course very special to be here and to see lots of friends again."" Like Enrique, ter Stegen was predicting a busy night for Barca against a Gladbach team which likes to counter-attack. ""Gladbach exerts pressure very high up, we need to control the game and circulate the ball quickly,"" said the 24-year-old. ""We are prepared and want to win. We know it'll be a tough game."""

But Schubert, whose contract has been extended until 2019, insists his side need not be intimidated. ""There is no reason to be awestruck. We will approach the game with energy, joy and a willingness to fight,"" Schubert told a Tuesday press conference. Schubert's new deal, announced on Tuesday, is recognition for steering Gladbach from bottom of the Bundesliga when he took over in September 2015 to Champions League qualification by finishing fourth. The show of faith in the 45-year-old coach is a timely boost ahead of the visit of Luis Enrique's Barcelona, who are without groin-injury victim Messi. ""We'd liked to have seen Lionel Messi at Borussia Park,"" said Schubert. ""We always like to play against very, very good teams, but the best player in the world will be missing.

""My return to Gladbach has definitely come sooner than expected and I absolutely cannot wait for it. ""I had a great time there and spent my entire career there apart from the last two years. ""But Barcelona was one of the few clubs I just couldn't turn down. I'm sure the Borussia fans can understand the decision that I made."""

However, prosecutors successfully argued the player and his father were aware of potentially fraudulent dealings between Barcelona and his former club Santos to the detriment of DIS, a Brazilian investment company who owned 40 percent of the player's sporting rights at the time of the transfer."
866,23/09/2016,13:45,Messi set on coming back even stronger,"Five-time World Player of the Year Lionel Messi insists he will bounceback ""even stronger"" from a groin injury that is set to keep him sidelined for three weeks.","Messi limped off after an hour of Barca's 1-1 draw against Atletico Madrid on Wednesday and is expected to miss Barca's next three games at Sporting Gijon, Borussia Moenchengladbach in the Champions League and Celta Vigo. The Argentine captain will also be absent for World Cup qualifiers against Peru and Paraguay early next month. ""I now have to rest for a few days before coming back even stronger,"" Messi posted on his official Facebook page. ""I would also like to thank everyone who has sent me their best wishes."" He was especially grateful to Moenchengladbach, who posted a message of support in Spanish to Messi on the club's Twitter account. ""What a shame. We would have liked to see on Wednesday with FC Barcelona at Borrusia-Park. Get well soon Lionel Messi!"" The Bundesliga club posted on Thursday. ""Many thanks to Borussia Mönchengladbach for their message of support! A really nice gesture from the club,"" added Messi. Barca are hopeful their talisman will be fit in time to face old boss Pep Guardiola when Manchester City visit the Camp Nou on October 19."
867,22/09/2016,01:57,'Football the loser' as Messi out for three weeks,"Barcelona star Lionel Messi will be sidelined for the next three weeks due to a groin strain, dealing a huge blow to his club and country.","""To lose Lionel Messi means football loses and we lose,"" said Barca boss Luis Enrique. Messi limped off just before the hour mark of the Spanish champions' 1-1 draw with Atletico Madrid on Wednesday. The Argentine captain is set to miss his country's World Cup qualifiers against Peru and Paraguay next month as well as Barca's Champions League clash at Borussia Moenchengladbach. Messi will also sit on the Catalans' La Liga trips to Sporting Gijon and Celta Vigo. However, Messi should be fit in time for a reunion with old boss Pep Guardiola when Manchester City visit the Camp Nou on Champions League duty on October 19. The five-time World Player of the Year missed Argentina's World Cup qualifier with Venezuela earlier this month due to the problem and only started Barca's shock 2-1 defeat to Alaves 10 days ago on the bench as coach Luis Enrique bedded him back into action gently. ""Now we have to look for other solutions,"" added Enrique. ""With Leo we are much stronger, but without him we are still a strong team."" Barca coped remarkably well with eight wins from 10 games when Messi was sidelined by a hamstring injury for two months last season. And Enrique hopes his side can show similar resilience to avoid slipping further behind Real Madrid in the title race. ""Last year we had an unfortunate situation with a longer-term injury and my team played well."" Barca remain three points behind Madrid at the top of La Liga after Angel Correa's equaliser seconds after Messi limped off handed Atletico a share of the spoils at the Camp Nou. Ivan Rakitic headed Barca into the lead just before half-time, but Atletico marshalled Messi's star strike partners Luis Suarez and Neymar well in his absence to hold out for a point. Suarez, though, insisted he and the Brazilian can step up as they did without Messi last season. ""It is a difficult injury that hurts and leaves you sad,"" said Suarez. ""Now we have to take responsibility."" Suarez was involved in a battle of his own as he was booked for a clash with Atletico left-back Filipe Luis six minutes from time. Luis posted a photo of a stud mark piercing his bleeding foot on his official Instagram page after the match with the message: ""Just as well he didn't touch me."" However, Suarez lambasted Luis for not reacting likewise when he was sent-off for a brutal challenge on Messi when the sides clashed back in January. ""This is football, it is a man's game and what happens on the pitch stays on the pitch,"" added Suarez. ""You can't make a show of things every time something happens. Last year he didn't post a picture of Messi. I repeat, football is for men."""

The French international's absence opens the door for Javier Mascherano to return alongside Gerard Pique at the heart of the Barca defence."
869,20/09/2016,15:54,Luis Enrique defends showboating Neymar,Barcelona coach Luis Enrique insists Neymar's skills should be enjoyed rather than criticised after the Brazilian's penchant for showboating once again came under the spotlight.,"Former Barca and Real Madrid midfielder Michael Laudrup controversially slammed Neymar for displaying his full range of tricks towards the end of Barca's 5-1 thrashing of newly promoted Leganes on Saturday. ""Ney has his own style, a style I think is spectacular for football. We enjoy it a lot at Barcelona,"" Enrique said on the eve of Barca's blockbuster La Liga clash with Atletico Madrid on Wednesday. ""There are many players that interpret football like that. It is a cultural thing more common in South American and particularly Brazilian players,"" added Enrique. ""It is something that shouldn't surprise anyone in Spanish football. He has been doing it since he got here."" Neymar's style has led to bad-tempered clashes with Atletico in the past. However, Atletico boss Diego Simeone claimed he is a big admirer of the 24-year-old. ""Everybody has their own style and way of playing. He is a player that I love,"" said Simeone on Tuesday. ""They have criticised him, but he enjoys himself, he dances, he sings and he destroys you. They can keep criticising, but he keeps responding as he has to."" Both sides come into the game in free-scoring form after scoring five at the weekend. However, Enrique believes Atletico will revert to type when they travel to the Camp Nou and rely on their watertight defence to try and hold out against Neymar, Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez. ""Many teams now defend deep against Atletico and give them the ball, so they are obliged to play more in tight spaces. I don't expect that against us,"" said Enrique. ""They can press high or, without doubt, they are the best team at defending close to their own area. That explains the complexities in playing against Atletico Madrid. ""They are one of the best teams in La Liga and clearly a contender for all the titles as always in Simeone's reign."" Barca's two wins over Atletico in La Liga last season proved decisive in the title race as Simeone's men finished just three points adrift of the champions in third. However, Atletico had their revenge by eliminating Barca in the Champions League for the second time in three years. ""There hasn't been an easy game against Atletico Madrid in the past few years,"" added Enrique. ""They are a direct title rival and these are three very important points."""
870,20/09/2016,13:11,Simeone eyes long-awaited Barca win against 'the best',Diego Simeone has one of the few feats to elude his hugely successful spell in charge of Atletico Madrid in his sights on Wednesday by claiming a first win in nine attempts at Barcelona's Camp Nou.,"Simeone's biggest achievement as Atletico boss came in winning La Liga at Camp Nou with a 1-1 draw in 2014, but despite also dumping Barca out of the Champions League in two of the last three seasons, the Argentine has yet to taste victory in the Catalan capital. ""In almost all the games that we haven't been able to win it has been due to the merit of Barcelona. We have drawn a few games, but possibly we have never deserved to win based on the 90 minutes."" Atletico went ahead in both meetings between the sides at the Camp Nou last season before their quest was undone by early red cards for Filipe Luis and Diego Godin in a 2-1 La Liga defeat in January and for Fernando Torres as Barca won by the same score in the first leg of their Champions League quarter-final in April. Barca's deadly front three of Luis Suarez, Lionel Messi and Neymar have proved too hot even for Atletico's watertight defence to handle, and Simeone insisted Barca remain the best team in Spain despite trailing early La Liga leaders Real Madrid by three points. ""The truth is yes (Barca are the best team). They continue to play brilliant football and have the players that most make the difference individually and collectively. Despite the fact they didn't win the Champions League last year, that puts them in an incredible place."" However, Atletico can call on a in-form, superstar forward of their own in Antoine Griezmann. Euro 2016's top scorer has scored four times in his last two La Liga games as Atletico have bounced back from draws against Alaves and Leganes to open their league campaign to thrash Celta Vigo and Sporting Gijon. And Simeone backed a campaign led by French sports daily L'Equipe on Tuesday for Griezmann to end Messi and Real Madrid's Cristiano Ronaldo's dominance of the Ballon d'Or for the past eight years. ""Hopefully Antoine will be there because last year he had an enormous season. He has started strongly again this year,"" added Simeone. ""The other day he played as a second striker and ended up defending like a second defensive midfielder. ""He is a player that offers us that option and hopefully he maintains that ambition that allows him to aspire to more every day."""

Two goals from Messi either side of Moussa Dembele's missed penalty for Celtic gave Barca a comfortable half-time lead. And there was no let-up for the Scottish champions after the break as Neymar, Messi, Andres Iniesta and a Suarez double completed the rout. However, Barca could face further sanctions from UEFA after thousands of separatist Catalan flags were again flown at the Camp Nou. The Spanish champions were fined 150,000 euros ($170,000) by UEFA for the presence of the flags during last season's competition, 50,000 euros of which was suspended for two years. Messi had started Saturday's shock 2-1 defeat to Alaves on the bench due to the after-effects of a minor groin injury, but took just three minutes to make his presence felt with a rising drive into the top corner from Neymar's lovely through ball. The five-time World Player of the Year sent another effort inches wide from the edge of the area as Celtic struggled to get out of their own half in the early stages. However, they had a great chance to level against the run of play when Dembele surged onto Scott Sinclair's pass and was upended by Marc-Andre ter Stegen. Dembele was Celtic's hat-trick hero in a 5-1 thrashing of Glasgow rivals Rangers on Saturday, but he failed to add to his burgeoning reputation as ter Stegen flew to his right to turn the Frenchman's penalty behind. The German 'keeper has now saved three of the four penalties he has faced in the Champions League. Barca immediately upped a gear and doubled their advantage three minutes later when a sensational exchange of passes between Neymar and Messi freed the latter to tap home his second of the night despite the presence of seven Celtic defenders in the area. The one-way traffic continued after the break as Dorus de Vries could only parry Neymar's free-kick into the top corner for his first goal of the season. Iniesta had been introduced at half-time and for all Messi's magic, the midfield schemer struck the goal of the night with a ferocious volley from Neymar's cross. Suarez was lauded as the best striker in the world by Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers, who was in charge of the Uruguayan for two years at Liverpool, on the eve of the game. However, Suarez showed his unselfishness rather than his killer instinct a minute later by squaring for Messi to roll home and complete his sixth Champions League hat-trick. Suarez did eventually get his goal, though, as he controlled another Neymar chipped pass before swivelling and smashing the ball into the roof of the net past a helpless de Vries. And Messi's low cross was prodded home from close range by Suarez to cap a humbling evening for Rodgers's men on their return to the Champions League after a three-year absence."

Barca were fined 150,000 euros ($170,000) by UEFA for the presence of the flags at the Camp Nou during last season's competition, 50,000 euros of which was suspended for two years. The club have previously stated their anger at the fines as ""totally unjust and...opposed to the exercise of the freedom of expression."" The flag, known locally as the ""Estelada"", which differentiates from the red and yellow Catalan flag by the presence of a five-pointed star within a blue triangle, has in recent years become a symbol of the independence movement within Catalonia. Thousands of flags were distributed outside the ground by the Catalan National Assembly (ANC) to both sets of supporters before kick-off. However, UEFA considers it a political symbol and fined Barcelona 40,000 euros after it was flown during a Champions League group game against Bayer Leverkusen last September. The club was also fined 30,000 euros in July 2015 after it was flown during the Champions League final in Berlin the previous month, where Barca beat Juventus to lift the trophy. Celtic have also fallen foul of UEFA's intolerance for political symbols this season as they open disciplinary proceedings after a section of Celtic's support displayed Palestine flags during a Champions League qualifier against Hapoel Beer-Sheva of Israel."
873,12/09/2016,19:42,Suarez best in the world for former boss Rodgers,"Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers labelled Barcelona's Luis Suarez as the best striker in the world ahead of the Scottish champions' daunting task of stopping Suarez, Lionel Messi and Neymar in their Champions League opener on Tuesday.","Rodgers worked with Suarez for two years at Liverpool as the Uruguayan's 31 goals nearly carried the English side to their first Premier League title in for 24 years in 2014. However, Rodgers admitted Suarez has gone to another level alongside Messi and Neymar in forming what the Northern Irishman described as one of the most deadly strike forces in football history. ""We respect that this is arguably the best team in the world with maybe the best front three of all-time,"" Rodgers said at the Camp Nou on Monday. ""I know from working with Luis he used to occupy a four or five-man defence on his own, so if you put Neymar and Messi into that it is a very difficult task. ""In this moment in time Luis is the best striker in the world there is no question about that. ""First of all you have to speak about the man. He is one of the most beautiful men you can come across. He's very humble guy, super professional, a family man who gives everything for his life as a footballer. ""I had the pleasure of working with Luis for two years. He is the best in the world. The biggest compliment you can pay him is he came to an already world class team and made them better. ""Barca now wouldn't be the same team without Luis in the team."" Celtic are huge underdogs to progress in a group that also contains Pep Guardiola's Manchester City and Borussia Moenchengladbach. However, the sides suffered contrasting fortunes at the weekend as Celtic thrashed old rivals Rangers 5-1 in the first league meeting between the two for four years, whilst Barca slumped to a shock 2-1 home defeat to newly-promoted Alaves. ""It can be positive, but also you can waken up a team with a result like that,"" added Rodgers. ""Luis (Enrique) made a number of changes to the team. Every manager picks the team to get the result and of course they will be disappointed. ""When you work with big players they always want to make amends."" Enrique was in the firing line after leaving Messi and Suarez on the bench among seven changes for the Alaves clash. However, he expects the Spanish champions to suffer no after-effects when back close to full-strength on Tuesday. ""The team has reacted well. They are obviously annoyed because we don't like and are not accustomed to losing at home,"" said Enrique. ""We have the shortest turnaround you can have between games. The players are rested and desperate to compete and play again in the Camp Nou in a competition that excites us."" Barca beat Celtic as recently as July 3-1 in a pre-season friendly in Dublin. However, Enrique expects a very different clash with Champions League points at stake. ""It helps to have played them in pre-season, but in terms of intensity and fighting for the three points there is a huge difference,"" added Enrique. And he lauded the impact made by Rodgers in his short time in charge at Celtic in leading the Scottish champions back into the Champions League for the first time in three years. ""He loves good football, he is a coach that likes to play on the front foot, to take the game to the opposition and you can see that already in his short time at Celtic. ""They have made good signings and have players that will cause us problems. I Like Rodgers as a coach and his idea of how to play football."" Enrique's only injury doubt comes in goal. Dutch stopper Jasper Cillessen made his debut on Saturday, but Marc-Andre ter Stegen trained fully on Monday and could make an earlier than expected return from a hamstring injury."

""I would like to never lose,"" Enrique said on Monday. ""This team has had two years (of success) beyond any doubt, but that doesn't mean we can't lose. ""We will try to change that, but we are not interested in the past. ""The team has reacted well. They are obviously annoyed because we don't like and are not accustomed to losing at home.

Barca will be back close to full strength with the star trio of Messi, Suarez and Neymar set to start together for the first time since the Copa del Rey final in May. Jordi Alba, Samuel Umtiti, Gerard Pique, Sergi Roberto and Andres Iniesta are also set to return from the side that started against Alaves. Enrique's only injury doubt comes in goal.

""I am the one ultimately responsible for all the bad things that happen,"" said the Barca boss after suffering just his fifth home league defeat in three seasons in charge at the Camp Nou. ""Many of the changes came from the circumstances surrounding us, but we have 22 players and we are going to use everyone this season."" As well as leaving out Messi and Suarez, Enrique changed his entire back four, whilst goalkeeper Jasper Cillessen and striker Paco Alcacer made their debuts. Deyverson beat Cillessen from close range to hand Alaves a surprise lead before half-time, but Jeremy Mathieu brought Barca back into the game when he headed home Neymar's corner a minute into the second-half. Mathieu somehow then blasted wide when it seemed easier to score from another set-piece before Barca's makeshift defence was caught out once more when Ibai Gomez slotted home the winner. Enrique called upon Messi, Suarez and Andres Iniesta from the bench, but even they couldn't break Alaves's resistance as Messi fired wide deep into stoppage time. ""We lacked fluidity, precision and we were fragile in defence, which is one of the things that normally makes us strong,"" added Enrique. ""The one positive is it is a time to reflect on what this team has won over the years. Everyone makes us favourites for everything, but it is not easy to win any game."" Enrique is expected to revert back to his strongest line-up for Celtic's visit to the Camp Nou to start their Champions League campaign. The Scottish club will be high on confidence after thrashing old rivals Rangers 5-1 on Saturday. ""It's clear it wasn't our best game, they didn't have many chances but they were very effective,"" said midfielder Sergio Busquets. ""We lacked a spark, we lacked a lot of things. It is hard to say it is a deserved defeat because they also didn't create a lot. ""Now we have to think about Celtic because the season rolls on."" And Iniesta insisted Barca will have licked their wounds and learned the lesson in time for the visit of the Scottish champions. ""We have to do better in the next game in a different competition,"" added the Spanish international. ""As always when there is a defeat, we have to analyse it and correct it for the next game."""

As well as the home game with Celtic on Tuesday, he is out of the matches against Alaves on Saturday and Leganes on September 17. Ter Stegen's injury should clear the way for Dutch 'keeper Jasper Cillessen to make his debut against Alaves at the Camp Nou. Cillessen joined from Ajax last month to replace the departed Claudio Bravo after the Chilean joined forces with former Barca boss Pep Guardiola at Manchester City."

""Yes,"" insisted Enrique when pressed on whether Messi was fit to play. ""During the week he was able do part of the training sessions with the team and another part on his own. We will focus on the needs of the team and make sure the player is in the best condition possible."" Enrique is blessed with a series of options up front as Spanish international Paco Alcacer could make his debut after sealing a 30 million euro ($33 million) move from Valencia, whilst Arda Turan and Denis Suarez have also impressed in Neymar's absence as the Catalans have made a 100 percent start to the season. ""There will be incredible players left in the stands or on the bench,"" added Enrique. ""I speak with all my players. We know how things are and the things we have to take care of."" Barca's splurge in the transfer market in the off-season was their first for two years after serving a two transfer window ban on registering new players for irregularities in the signing of foreign players under 18. Rivals Real Madrid and Atletico Madrid have now been hit by a similar punishment, but Enrique hopes they don't weather the ban as well as his side did in winning a La Liga and Copa del Rey double last season. ""They will have to face up to it and we hope they don't achieve the same results as us."""
878,08/09/2016,14:53,Alcacer happy with supporting role at Barca,"Spanish international striker Paco Alcacer recognised he will have to make the most of relatively few opportunities to make his mark at Barcelona as back-up to a fearsome front three of Lionel Messi, Luis Suarez and Neymar.","Alcacer was presented at the Camp Nou on Thursday after completing a 30 million euro ($33 million) move from Valencia on the penultimate day of the transfer window. ""I have come to the best club in the world, the club that plays the best football. To be here with Suarez, Messi, Neymar, I am going to learn a lot from them,"" said Alcacer, who signed a five-year deal with a 100 million euro buyout clause. ""The role (I have) is for the coach to decide. The season is long and there are lots of games and all the players that are here are going to do their bit. ""I came here to improve as a player, I have to take the opportunities I have."" Alcacer's signing ended a long wait for Barca to replace Pedro Rodriguez, who left for Chelsea last August, as a fourth forward option behind the star South American trio. However, sporting director Robert Fernandez insisted Alcacer can make an impact. ""You have three forwards of an unrepeatable level, but Paco is going to help us a lot. There are a lot of matches during the season."" Alcacer is likely to make his debut on Saturday when Alaves visit the Camp Nou and could even do so from the start with Messi struggling with a groin strain and Neymar and Suarez recently returned from World Cup qualifiers in South America. Meanwhile, director of sporting institutional relations Albert Soler, confirmed Barca are looking into their legal options against Brazilian club Santos over the transfer of Gabriel Barbosa to Inter Milan. Barca had a first refusal option on Barbosa, who starred alongside Neymar as Brazil won Olympic gold last month, due to the complicated series of agreements that brought Neymar to Catalonia in 2013. ""We are in a judicial process. There was a first refusal clause that Santos didn't comply with,"" said Soler. ""We will decide in the next few days, but on the sporting side it hasn't affected us."" Barcelona daily Sport reported Santos did not give Barca three working days to match Inter's 29.5 million euro bid as they were contractually obliged to."

In a statement on Monday Barcelona said tests had confirmed an injury to his left groin and that Messi will ""lower the demands of his training sessions in the next few days."" The Spanish champions refused to state how long Messi will be sidelined for, but Barca are unlikely to take any risks for Alaves' trip to the Camp Nou on Saturday with seven matches to come in 22 days. ""Everything is fine, I have to slow things down as I recover with physio, but it's nothing to worry about,"" Messi posted on his official Facebook page. Messi had started the season in fine form, scoring three times as Barca won the Spanish Super Cup against Sevilla and opened their La Liga title defence with back-to-back victories over Real Betis and Athletic Bilbao. Argentina boss Edgardo Bauza said Messi had gone against the wishes of Barcelona's doctors to make a triumphant return to the national team having dramatically reversed his shock decision to retire from international duty after missing a penalty in Argentina's Copa America final defeat to Chile in June. Messi will miss Argentina's latest World Cup qualifier away to Venezuela on Tuesday."
880,31/08/2016,17:31,Barcelona may extend Qatar Airways sponsorship to 2020,"La Liga champions Barcelona and Qatar Airways are in talks to extend their current shirt sponsorship deal until 2020, the boss of the Gulf carrier said Wednesday.","Akbar Al Baker, Qatar Airways' CEO, said the two parties were in fresh negotiations to extend the current one year deal, which was announced in July, by a further three years. ""We didn't have enough time to negotiate a proper agreement with them, this is why we extended it for one year and we are in negotiations with them,"" said Al Baker. But, he added: ""This is all depends on what kind of agreement FCB is willing to do with us."" The current one-year deal runs until June 30, 2017, according to Barcelona's official website. Qatar Airways began their sponsorship of Barcelona's shirts in July 2013, in a deal which ran out this summer before the extension was announced. Last October, Barcelona's president Josep Bartomeu told the club's AGM that the Blaugranes were looking for a new 65 million ($72 million) euros-a-year sponsorship, spread over at least three years. Sponsorship of the team's shirts by the airline has proved controversial among some Barcelona fans, because of Qatar's poor record on labour rights. Sports sponsorship is proving important to Qatar Airways. Earlier this month, it announced a three-year ""prominent branding"" deal with Australian Football League team Sydney Swans. In January, German football side Bayern Munich announced a sponsorship deal with Doha's Hamad International Airport, which is operated by the airline. And the airline also announced this month, it would be the official airline for the International Cycling Union Road World Championships hosted by the Gulf emirate in October. Baker added that the airline was constantly being approached by teams for sponsorship possibilities. ""Everybody approaches us,"" he said. ""We have many, many clubs approaching us on a weekly basis."""
881,29/08/2016,01:32,Barca maintain hunger for titles - Luis Enrique,Barcelona coach Luis Enrique highlighted the hunger of his squad not to be ousted by Real Madrid as Spanish champions after a hard-fought 1-0 win at Athletic Bilbao maintained their perfect start to the season.,"The Catalans had to win their final five league games of last season to stave off Real's late charge and claim a fifth title in seven seasons. ""It is a start to the season very like how we ended last season. All the players are involved, all the players have the desire and hunger to be first,"" said the Barca coach. Four wins to start the new campaign, including two in the Spanish Super Cup over Sevilla, have come about despite the absence of Neymar due to his participation in the Olympics and injured captain Andres Iniesta. ""We still have players to come back, players that have suffered injuries in pre-season, but we have a great squad and everyone is desperate to compete,"" added Luis Enrique. One area of competition within the squad was eased this week as Claudio Bravo signed for Manchester City, clearing the way for Marc-Andre ter Stegen to become Barca's undisputed number-one goalkeeper. Bravo and Ter Stegen have shared duties over the past two seasons with the former playing in La Liga, while the German featured in the Champions League and Copa del Rey. Ter Stegen's passing style from the back was in full evidence as he completed a La Liga record 51 passes for a goalkeeper, but also nearly cost Barca the opening goal with a poor clearance. However, Luis Enrique described his goalkeeper as being a ""good German"" for his calmness under pressure. ""Ter Stegen has cold blood, he is German and I think he is a good German. ""He is very able (to play out from the back) because of the quality he possesses."" Ter Stegen was constantly pressed by the Athletic front line, but believes he will only improve after his first appearance of the season due to a knee injury. ""Here it is always difficult to play short passes out from the back,"" he said. ""For me it was the first game and after an injury it is always a bit more difficult. ""In the coming games I think I will have more confidence in the things I do and with the knee."" Dutch 'keeper Jasper Cillessen joined from Ajax in midweek to replace Bravo and Ter Stegen expects competition from he and perennial third choice Jordi Masip for his place in the side. ""We have good competition which is very good for all three of us. I hope everything is loyal and we can fight for our place as it should be."""
882,25/08/2016,16:42,Bravo joins City as Hart's replacement,Manchester City have completed their swoop for Barcelona goalkeeper Claudio Bravo to push Joe Hart closer to an unwanted exit from the Premier League club.,"City manager Pep Guardiola's move for Bravo is likely to mean England goalkeeper Hart will be sold before next week's transfer deadline after he lost his place to back-up Willy Caballero at the start of the season. Guardiola, who arrived from Bayern Munich in the close season, wanted to sign Bravo because he felt Hart's passing wasn't good enough to fulfil his desire for a 'sweeper-keeper' who can effectively retain possession. Chile international Bravo has signed a four-year contract and is reported to have cost City around £17 million ($22 million, 19 million euros). Caballero surprisingly started City's first three games of the season ahead of Hart, whose appearance against Steaua Bucharest in the Champions League on Wednesday may well prove to be his last in a City shirt after 10 years with the club. While Guardiola is respectful of Hart's qualities, he believes Bravo's wealth of experience and his leadership will prove invaluable as the Spanish coach looks to put his mark on the City squad in his first season in English football. ""Claudio is a fantastic goalkeeper and an excellent addition to our squad,"" Guardiola told City's website. ""He has experience and great leadership qualities and is in the prime of his life. ""He is a goalkeeper I have admired for a number of years and I'm really happy he is now a City player."" Bravo made 75 appearances for Barcelona since joining from Real Sociedad in 2014. The 33-year-old won eight trophies including back-to-back La Liga titles, and was named in the 2014-15 La Liga team of the season. Bravo is Chile's most capped player on 106 international appearances and was voted goalkeeper of the tournament after captaining his country to Copa America glory earlier this year. Bravo hopes to add to his trophy collection with City and admitted the chance to play for Guardiola was too good to turn down. ""I'm very proud to be joining Manchester City. I know the club is building something very special and I hope I can be part of many successes in the coming years,"" Bravo said. ""I have followed City's progress in recent years and obviously know some of my new team-mates from the Copa America. ""It is not easy to leave a club like Barcelona where I had two fantastic years, but the opportunity to work with Pep Guardiola was too good to refuse. ""Now I will challenge the other great goalkeepers the club has and together I hope we can win many trophies."""
883,25/08/2016,13:04,Barcelona complete signing of Cillessen,"Barcelona have completed the signing of Dutch international goalkeeper Jasper Cillessen from Ajax, the Spanish champions confirmed on Thursday.","In a statement on their official website the Catalans confirmed they had signed the 27-year-old on a five-year contract for a fee of 13 million euros (£11.1 million, $14.7 million), rising to a potential 15 million euros. Barca said Cillessen flew to Spain on Thursday morning to undergo a medical and would be officially unveiled on Friday. Cillessen made a farewell appearance for Ajax on Wednesday in their 4-1 Champions League play-off defeat to Rostov in Russia. His arrival clears the way for Chilean goalkeeper Claudio Bravo to leave the Camp Nou for Manchester City, leaving the Dutchman to compete with Marc-Andre ter Stegen for the number one jersey in Luis Enrique's side."
884,23/08/2016,16:18,Guardiola confirms Bravo on his way to replace Hart,"Pep Guardiola insisted on Tuesday that he will continue working with Joe Hart at Manchester City, even as Barcelona goalkeeper Claudio Bravo flew in to replace the unwanted England international.","Hart has been the most high-profile victim of Guardiola's new reign as manager of the Premier League club, with the City boss publicly announcing his preference for a goalkeeper who can play better with the ball at his feet. Willy Caballero replaced Hart for City's first three competitive games, all victories, that Spanish manager Guardiola has overseen. Bravo flew in to Manchester from Barcelona on Tuesday to complete his reported £17 million ($22 million, 20 million euros) transfer from the Spanish club, a move that will see Hart, England's undisputed first-choice goalkeeper during this year's European Championships, relegated to third choice at the Eastlands. Hart's plight has been compounded because potential moves to Everton and Sevilla appear to have fallen through, at least in part due to his high salary which makes even a loan move prohibitive for many potential suitors. ""I have an excellent relationship with Joe. We are clear -- him with me, I with him. We spoke about football,"" said Guardiola who was photographed talking to Hart during training ahead of City's Champions League qualifying tie with Steaua Bucharest on Wednesday. ""So I can't deny what everybody knows. Barcelona, seven to 10 days ago, were the first ones to announce contact with Manchester City. ""But I'm sorry guys, until the deal is complete or not complete (I can't speak), but at the moment the player (Bravo) is not our player,"" Guardiola also told reporters. ""Until August 31, all the players here are my players, and I will work with them like there is no end, so after that we can speak about everything. ""The situation with Joe, I spoke about in the last two press conferences. I am not able to speak about negotiations."" Meanwhile, Guardiola has backed forward Raheem Sterling to cope with the abuse he is receiving from opposition supporters after he was roundly booed in the weekend victory at Stoke. Sterling suffered more than most from England's disappointing European Championship campaign and attracted unwanted attention off the field, but Guardiola has no doubt his player will prevail. ""The fans may boo because they know how good he is,"" said the manager. ""He has shown us, he has shown me, that in this team he is mentally strong and can focus on his job from the beginning of the game. ""He will make good things happen for us and for the England national team, I'm pretty sure of that,"" the former Barcelona and Bayern Munich boss added. ""When people stop talking about him for what happens off the pitch and talk about him for what happens on the pitch then everything is going well."" The City manager has made an impressive start to the new campaign despite being without injured captain Vincent Kompany and pre-season signings Ilkay Gundogan and Leroy Sane, although he expects the trio to be available for the Manchester derby on September 10. ""Now we have this week and then 10 days to work with them in training sessions to improve their physical condition,"" said Guardiola. ""Hopefully when we come back from the international break they will be fully part of our training sessions."""

886,19/08/2016,02:05,Barcelona hit by injuries before Liga opener,Javier Mascherano has joined the queue to the Camp Nou treatment room with champions Barcelona hit by a spate of injuries before they begin the new season in La Liga against Betis on Saturday.,"Luis Enrique's side paid a high price for winning the Spanish Super Cup against Sevilla, with captain Andres Iniesta and defenders Jeremy Mathieu and Mascherano sustaining injuries over the two legs that will keep them out of Saturday's game. ""I'm very happy and satisfied with what I saw on the pitch and the performances of the players who are joining the team. I'm very happy about everything except Mascherano's injury,"" said Luis Enrique after Wednesday's second leg of the Super Cup, as Barca won 3-0 to secure a 5-0 aggregate success. Barcelona are also without star forward Neymar, who is at the Olympics, while goalkeeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen is still recovering from a minor knee injury. Meanwhile, France international Samuel Umtiti is in line for his La Liga debut after impressing against Sevilla and will be paired with Gerard Pique. This could be goalkeeper Claudio Bravo's last game for Barcelona as reports suggest he is close to joining Manchester City, and the Camp Nou is sure to give him a rousing send-off for his services over the past two seasons. Gus Poyet's Betis have added several players in the summer, including Roma striker Antonio Sanabria, who was on loan at Sporting Gijon last season. Real Madrid have to wait until Sunday to kick off their campaign, making the trip to Anoeta to face Real Sociedad, which has been a problematic venue for La Liga's top teams in recent years. Coach Zinedine Zidane will be without his star player Cristiano Ronaldo, who is still recovering from a knee injury suffered in Portugal's Euro 2016 final win over France. Goalkeeper Keylor Navas is still out injured, with Kiko Casilla filling in, although better news comes in the form of Gareth Bale's return to action on Monday in a friendly against French side Reims. He is likely to start against La Real, but French hitman Karim Benzema is set to miss out due to a niggling hip problem. Summer signing Alvaro Morata should lead the line, while youngster Marco Asensio may also earn a start after impressing in the UEFA Super Cup win over Sevilla. ""He knows what he will have here, and all the players know it, I'm not going to trick anyone. I am going to try and pick the best team possible for each game. I have the great squad that we need to have a great season,"" said Zidane of Asensio. Los Blancos are looking to win a league title for the first time since 2012, while their capital rivals Atletico Madrid will hope to again feature prominently. Diego Simeone's men host promoted Alaves at the Vicente Calderon as they attempt to bounce back after a crushing defeat by Real Madrid on penalties in the Champions League final last season. Atletico have signed Argentine midfielder Nicolas Gaitan from Benfica and French striker Kevin Gameiro from Sevilla, but the biggest boost for them over the summer was Simeone's decision to stay in the job. He had hinted at a departure after the Champions League final setback, saying he needed ""time to think"". ""I was referring to time to think about how I can deal with taking my responsibilities with Atletico Madrid forward. If I'd left, I wouldn't have been able to go with peace of mind. I never said I would leave, just that I needed time to think,"" he told Canal Plus. Malaga and Osasuna get the action underway on Friday, while eyes will be on Fran Escriba's Villarreal at Granada on Saturday. The Yellow Submarine sacked coach Marcelino just before the season started and lost to Monaco in their Champions League play-off first leg on Wednesday in Escriba's debut.

887,16/08/2016,01:45,Sevilla face mission improbable in Super Cup,Sevilla have a mountain to climb in the second leg of the Spanish Super Cup on Wednesday if they are to overcome Barcelona.,"Goals from Luis Suarez and Munir El Haddadi earned last year's Liga and Copa del Rey winners a 2-0 victory in Andalusia on Sunday and they have one hand on the trophy. Jorge Sampaoli's men impressed in the first half but struggled to create many clear chances and now find themselves in an extremely tough position going into the return fixture at the Camp Nou. The Argentine coach believes playing against Real Madrid in the UEFA Super Cup last Tuesday harmed his side's chances of victory in this competition. ""We came from 120 minutes against Real Madrid and had several casualties. The calendar has hurt us a bit and we're feeling the weight of fatigue,"" he explained after the defeat. ""Hopefully we will play a more dignified role (in the return leg)."" Sevilla goalkeeper Sergio Rico, who was his side's outstanding player, agreed with his coach. ""We suffered in the second half because we were worn down after the other final,"" Rico said. ""I hope we win the next one. It's home and away, and we will go there with all the hope in the world to put in a good performance and turn things around. All is not lost."" Michael Krohn-Dehli and Benoit Tremoulinas are still out injured, while captain Vicente Iborra should return after being rested. Barcelona, meanwhile, will be without captain Andres Iniesta and defender Jeremy Mathieu, who injured their knee and hamstring respectively during Sunday's clash. New signings Denis Suarez and Lucas Digne were their replacements from the bench on the night and having both impressed are likely to start on Wednesday. With the return just three days after the first match, it would be no surprise to see the coaches shuffle their packs. Neymar is still absent, at the Olympic Games, and Luis Enrique must decide if he will opt for Arda Turan to replace him again, or if Munir is the better option, while Andre Gomes and Samuel Umtiti will be hoping to make their official debuts. ""The players who started played very well and so did those who came on. We're going to need all the players because we will be playing every three days,"" said the coach. ""Some people focus on the trees but I look at the forest. These players have shown over the years how much quality they have. But we are just starting the season and playing for our first trophy so we have to look after them. ""We are all very excited about this chance to win the Spanish Super Cup, it's the first big trophy of the season. And if you want to win titles, you need to be ambitious."" Enrique was impressed by Sevilla's performance at the Ramon Sanchez-Pizjuan, even though the scoreline looked comfortable for his team. ""It might be a good result, but it's not a definitive one,"" he added. ""Every coach tries to implement his own style, and I like Sampaoli's a lot. He wants to win by playing the ball, by controlling it and by playing attacking football."""
888,15/08/2016,03:12,Suarez gives Barcelona edge in Supercup,Luis Suarez insisted the Spanish Super Cup is not Barcelona's yet after helping his team shoot down Sevilla 2-0 to give them a comfortable lead after Sunday's first leg of the final.,"The Uruguayan opened the scoring early in the second half, making amends for two earlier misses, before Munir El Haddadi sealed the win when he ran on to a Lionel Messi through-ball and fired home. Having been beaten 4-0 by Athletic Bilbao in the first leg of last year's final, Barcelona were determined to improve on that showing, setting themselves up nicely for the return at Camp Nou on August 17. ""This is not decided,"" Suarez told Spanish television after the game. ""In the second half we played very well. It's important to win away from home against an opponent as good as Sevilla."" He was not impressed with some of the home supporters who shouted insults at him from the stands at the Ramon Sanchez-Pizjuan. Suarez added: ""They can keep talking, I'm going to do my thing, which is to play football. It's not a problem, we are the protagonists, not them."" Luis Enrique was thrilled with the performance, which puts his team halfway towards the first trophy of the season. ""We continue with the same ambition as always,"" he said in his post-game press conference. ""This team knows how to sacrifice and compete, because we want all the titles and we've ended up with a magnificent result. ""We played a good game, as much defensively as in attack, and in the second half we were able to connect with the forwards and open the scoring. I am very happy with everything."" The coach sprang a surprise with his selection, picking Jeremy Mathieu at left-back and Arda Turan at left-wing in place of the absent Neymar, with all four summer signings left out. Sergi Roberto was also chosen out of position at right-back, ahead of Aleix Vidal. However, by the 35th minute both Lucas Digne and Denis Suarez had to be brought on for their official debuts, with Mathieu and Andres Iniesta injuring their hamstring and knee respectively. Iniesta was making his 594th appearance for Barcelona, taking over from Carles Puyol as the player with the second most appearances for the club, behind Xavi Hernandez, but it was ended prematurely after a fierce challenge by Gabriel Mercado. The first period saw few chances created, although the best of them fell to Luis Suarez in the sixth minute. Sergio Busquets played him in and after spinning masterfully away from the defence his low strike was saved well by goalkeeper Sergio Rico. At the other end Jorge Sampaoli's team worked their way into the game but despite plenty of possession in dangerous areas, they couldn't worry Claudio Bravo. Luis Suarez spurned another good chance at the start of the second half when Rico saved his flicked effort, but it was third time lucky for the Uruguayan. Denis Suarez lofted a neat ball into the area and Turan chested it home for the forward to finish with aplomb. Messi should have doubled the lead moments later, but Rico made a fine stop from his dinked effort, after good work by Turan and Suarez carved the Argentine an opening. Eventually substitute Munir put the game and probably the tie to bed sliding the ball past Rico with the outside of his left boot after Messi fed through an inviting pass. It was evident that neither team were as fit as they would have liked, with Sevilla energy levels falling away in the second half, no doubt as a result of playing 120 minutes in a heartbreaking last gasp 3-2 defeat Real Madrid in the UEFA Super Cup earlier in the week. Now Sampaoli needs to pick them up ahead of the second leg on Wednesday, where a monumental effort will be required if they are to overturn the deficit."
889,06/08/2016,20:17,Mane sparkles as Liverpool crush Barcelona,New signing Sadio Mane scored one goal and made another as Liverpool slickly defeated Barcelona 4-0 in a one-sided friendly match at a sun-soaked Wembley on Sunday.,"A 34 million pounds ($44.5 million, 40.1 million euros) capture from Southampton, Mane struck a 15th-minute opener and then supplied the cross from which ex-Liverpool player Javier Mascherano scored an own goal. Divock Origi added a third seconds later and substitute Marko Grujic chipped in with a stoppage-time header as Jurgen Klopp's side registered their sixth win in eight pre-season games. They play Mainz, one of Klopp's former clubs, in a friendly in Germany on Sunday before tackling Arsenal in their Premier League opener next weekend. Barcelona's defeat meant that Paris Saint-Germain won the International Champions Cup friendly tournament for the second year running. Barcelona coach Luis Enrique was missing Neymar, who is on duty with hosts Brazil at the Olympics, but fielded both former Liverpool striker Luis Suarez and Lionel Messi, who hit the post in the first half. Barca play Sampdoria at the Camp Nou in their final pre-season friendly on Wednesday and face Sevilla in the first leg of the Spanish Super Cup on August 14. The glamour tie drew 89,845 spectators to Wembley -- the stadium's second-highest attendance -- and it was Liverpool's fans, comfortably in the majority, who went home with smiles on their faces. With seven friendly games behind them to Barcelona's two, Liverpool were the sharper team and they took the lead with a slick goal. After winning possession on halfway, Adam Lallana surged forward and exchanged passes with Roberto Firmino before teeing up Mane, whose rising shot beat goalkeeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen. Klopp reacted with a flurry of fist pumps, but his side had to weather a succession of Barcelona chances before half-time. Suarez, facing his former club for the first time, teed up Messi to roll a shot against the right-hand post, while Liverpool goalkeeper Simon Mignolet saved from Arda Turan and Suarez. James Milner, who announced his England retirement on Friday, was again deployed at left-back for Liverpool, but had to give way to Alberto Moreno before half-time. Within three minutes of kick-off in the second half, the game was as good as over. In the 47th minute, Origi's flick released Mane and his low cross from the right was bundled into the net by Mascherano. Barely a minute later, Kevin Stewart caught Jeremy Mathieu dawdling on the ball and freed fellow half-time substitute Origi, who coolly beat Barcelona replacement goalkeeper Claudio Bravo. Grujic, a January recruit from Red Star Belgrade, put the cherry on the cake in added time, meeting fellow Serbian Lazar Markovic's scooped pass with a fine header that looped over Bravo."
890,01/08/2016,18:26,"Montoya released by Barca, signs for Valencia","Full-back Martin Montoya has joined Valencia on a four-year deal after being released by Barcelona, the two clubs confirmed on Monday.","The 25-year-old Spaniard broke into the first team at the Camp Nou in 2011, but could not consolidate his place and only made 45 La Liga appearances for the Catalan giants in five seasons. ""Valencia CF and Martin Montoya have reached an agreement with the player, who joins the club for the next four seasons,"" Valencia said in a statement. Montoya spent time on loan at Inter Milan and Real Betis last season, and will be hoping to help Valencia improve on their disappointing finish of 12th place in La Liga last term."
891,31/07/2016,02:30,Rodgers upbeat despite Barcelona defeat,Brendan Rodgers remains optimistic about Celtic's Champions League hopes even after seeing his side beaten 3-1 by Spanish giants Barcelona in a Dublin friendly on Saturday.,"Luis Enrique's side scored three first-half goals through Arda Turan, Munir El Haddadi and an Efe Ambrose own-goal, to cancel out Leigh Griffiths's 29th-minute strike. Rodgers had one eye on Wednesday's Champions League third qualifying round second leg tie with Astana at Celtic Park, and despite some poor defensive play, expressed his happiness with what was a challenging 90 minutes against the La Liga champions. ""It was an excellent workout, it's always a great education when playing Barcelona in terms of how they play, but I was really proud of the players coming back off a long trip during the week,"" said Rodgers, whose side were held to a 1-1 draw in the first leg in Kazakhstan. ""They had one day to recover and then out there to face a team who test you and your organisation. ""I thought we were good in terms of some of our pressing, our goal comes from our ability to press and be up the field. I thought we had some really good passages of play. ""Our only negative was the injury to Nir Bitton, it looks a nasty one but we'll assess that over the next 24 hours,"" the Northern Irishman added. Former Liverpool manager Rodgers revealed he was looking to sign four more players during the transfer window, and following another slip-up by Ambrose, the Nigerian international defender, defence will be an area he is keen to strengthen. The Celtic boss refused to confirm or deny a possible move for Manchester United youngster Paddy McNair, but gave his support to Ambrose, whose substitution appeared to be cheered by some Celtic fans. ""I think he's an unlucky guy, bless him,"" Rodgers said. ""I think a striker would have been proud of that goal. He was so unfortunate. The ball is whipped in, there is no real danger and for it to come off his leg that far outside the post and to go in the far corner is disappointing, especially after us getting back into the game as well. ""Look, sometimes these things happen, but overall he did okay."" Aston Villa midfielder Scott Sinclair could yet join the Rodgers revolution, following Moussa Dembele and Kolo Toure, who have already signed for Celtic. Rodgers said saw plenty of positives in the 3-1 defeat, but accepted the side had plenty of work ahead of them. ""We're still a long way away from where I want to be, but what I can't deny is the mental fitness of the players, and physically how they're pushing themselves, we showed some good moments in the game in terms of where we want to be, but the reality is other players will be coming in, and obviously we'll have more work on the training ground,"" he said. Meanwhile Barcelona manager Enrique was pleased with his side's first pre-season game, with 20 players getting a run out. ""It was great to be back, to have the team back, quite happy with a good result, we played a good game,"" he said. ""It was a good test. Celtic have a second game in the Champions League to come, and they are working hard under the new coach."" Enrique had special praise for Hoops winger Patrick Roberts, who models his game on Lionel Messi. ""He's a great player, he has a great future in the team, he has great quality and I think he can bring good things to the team,"" Enrique said."
892,30/07/2016,21:35,Messi quiet but Barcelona stroll past Celtic,A blond-haired Lionel Messi failed to get on the scoresheet but it hardly mattered as under-strength Barcelona taught Celtic a footballing lesson in a Dublin friendly on Saturday.,"Strikes by Arda Turan and Munir El Haddadi, and an own goal by Efe Ambrose -- all before the break -- were enough to earn a 3-1 victory for Luis Garcia's men in what was their first game back after the summer. Leigh Griffiths had replied to Turan's opener, but boss Brendan Rodgers will be concerned with how vulnerable his defence looked once again, ahead of Celtic's crucial Champions League third qualifying round clash with Astana on Wednesday. The tie is delicately balanced at 1-1 ahead of the second leg at Parkhead. Barcelona came to Dublin without Andres Iniesta, Gerard Pique, Sergio Busquets, Javier Mascherano, Claudio Bravo and Jordi Alba, who aren't back in training until tomorrow, while Neymar is preparing for the Olympics in Brazil. But there was more than a sprinkling of quality with Messi and Luis Suarez bringing enough star power to help fill over 47,000 seats at Lansdowne Road. Rodgers made four changes to the side that drew at Astana last Wednesday, but new signing Kolo Toure did not travel. Things had looked good for Celtic early on and they almost opened the scoring after just 13 seconds when Patrick Roberts capitalised on a Jeremy Mathieu slip, cut inside -- Messi-style -- but sent his curling effort inches wide of Jordi Masip's goal. With Roberts a constant threat, Celtic had the bulk of the early chances, but when the opening goal came it was from the Spanish champions, Turan firing home powerfully from the edge of the box. Roberts continued to get the fans on their feet, delivering some of the slalom runs many would have come to see Messi perform. But when Celtic scored the assist came from a Barcelona error, handing Griffiths a tap-in from five yards out. Ambrose and keeper Craig Gordon then conspired to concede a howler, with the centre-half stretching to intercept a harmless cross and sending it beyond the hapless Gordon. Barcelona added a third before the break as Celtic's defence collapsed again, with Suarez nipping behind all too easily, before nutmegging Ambrose and squaring to Munir, who was all alone to slot home. Both sides swapped their entire starting 11s as the second half passed, with a quiet Messi -- sporting his new peroxide blond hair -- going off at the break."
893,29/07/2016,20:56,Kolo Toure to miss Barcelona friendly,Kolo Toure will miss Celtic's friendly with Spanish giants Barcelona in Dublin on Saturday but could play for his new club in next week's key Champions League tie against Astana.,"The 35-year-old Ivory Coast centre-back, formerly with Arsenal, Manchester City and Liverpool has yet to feature for his new side since joining the Glasgow club last week. Scottish champions Celtic have a defensive injury crisis, with Erik Sviatchenko, Jose Simunovic, Dedryck Boyata and Kristoffer Ajer all sidelined. And with their Champions League third qualifying round tie against Astana poised at 1-1 ahead of Wednesday's second leg at Parkhead, it is easy to see why they would want to avoid an injury to Toure in a friendly match, no matter how prestigious the opposition. Celtic coach John Kennedy, speaking at Glasgow Airport ahead of the team's departure to Ireland on Friday, said: ""It's pretty much the same squad we had in Astana. ""Kolo is still working fitness-wise so he also stays back to do some extra work. It's still a bit early for him to play in tomorrow's game. We will look at that again and assess that on Monday. ""It depends how he comes through the next few days (whether he can play against Astana). If he shows his fitness levels are good enough he is an option. ""Erik won't travel over. We'll see how he is in the next couple of days. It's better for him to stay at home and get some treatment. ""We just have to deal with tomorrow (Saturday) and see how everybody comes through. ""We've got Kolo in the back of our minds and that is why he has stayed behind to work. Come Sunday we can assess everybody and see where we're at."" Kennedy added: ""We are short defensively, though. There's no question about that. We just have to make sure whatever we put on the pitch against Astana is strong enough to win the game."" Despite their injury problems, Kennedy said Celtic were looking forward to Saturday's match against Barcelona. ""We're playing a top team so it's good to test yourself against that,"" he said. ""For us it is good preparation for Wednesday. ""Testing yourself against the best gives you a great mark of where you are at. ""Barca will probably make us run a little bit so that will help us top up our fitness levels as well."" Meanwhile, Kennedy confirmed that Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers was interested in signing Aston Villa winger Scott Sinclair, who previously worked with the Hoops boss at Swansea. ""There are a number of targets we're looking at but we need to make sure they are the right ones,"" he said. ""He (Sinclair) is one that has been mentioned but he's still an Aston Villa player. We want to bring quality in and that is certainly the calibre of player we're looking at."""
894,27/07/2016,16:20,Barcelona unveil new signing Andre Gomes,Barcelona paraded Portuguese midfielder Andre Gomes at the Camp Nou on Wednesday after his 55-million-euro capture from Valencia on a five-year deal.,"The 22-year-old, part of Portugal's European Championship-winning side, has a release clause of 100 million euros ($110 mn, £84 mn) and will cost an initial 35 million euros, with 20 million in add-ons. Gomes, who agreed the move last week, said he chose the Spanish champions because he felt it gave him the best chance to progress as a player. ""Every club has its own personality.

Umtiti, who can also play at left-back, will be officially presented as a Barcelona player on Friday after undergoing a medical at the Camp Nou.

903,09/07/2016,16:51,From back-up to Barcelona for France's Umtiti,"In the space of 10 giddy days, 22-year-old Samuel Umtiti has gone from uncapped Lyon defender to big-money Barcelona signing and likely France starter in a European Championship final.","Drafted in as an injury replacement, Umtiti was still waiting for his first appearance at Euro 2016 when Barcelona announced on June 30 that they had agreed to sign him from Lyon for 25 million euros ($26.7 million). He made his France debut against Iceland three days later and having then impressed in the 2-0 semi-final win over Germany, Umtiti is expected to line up against Cristiano Ronaldo's Portugal in Sunday's final. ""I'm not surprised by Sam. What he's doing with us is what he was doing before,"" France coach Didier Deschamps told journalists at Stade de France on Saturday. ""He knows I have confidence in him. Some players aren't mature at 30, some are mature at 20 -- he's in the latter category. ""He deserves all the praise. He has the force of character and the force of personality that you need."" Umtiti was only called up by Deschamps due to a calf injury sustained by Jeremy Mathieu, who will ironically be one of his rivals for a place alongside Gerard Pique in the heart of Barcelona's defence next season. The Cameroon-born youngster did not play a minute of France's first four games at the tournament, but a suspension to Adil Rami opened the door ahead of the last 16 meeting with Iceland at Stade de France. Preferred to the more experienced Eliaquim Mangala, Umtiti looked understandably nervous and was at fault for Iceland's first goal, although he completed 100 percent of his passes in France's 5-2 win. In a major show of faith, Deschamps kept Umtiti in the starting XI against Germany despite Rami's return and he produced a far more assured display that dazzled France's former defensive lynchpin Lilian Thuram. ""Congratulations, you blew me away!"" Thuram told Umtiti in a post-match encounter at Marseille's Stade Velodrome that was caught on camera by French television channel TF1. ""Always stay this calm!"" Umtiti's calmness was his calling card during his speedy progression through the Lyon youth ranks and it was the confidence and accuracy of his passing that are thought to have seduced Barcelona. Having made his Lyon debut aged 18 in January 2012, he was appointed vice-captain last season and will leave France with 131 Ligue 1 appearances under his belt. ""He's sure of his ability, which is important,"" says France goalkeeper Hugo Lloris, who played with Umtiti in his final season at Lyon before joining Tottenham Hotspur. ""There's confidence within the team, too. This environment and confidence allows him to feel good and show all his ability. ""He's very strong in the challenge and very good at playing the ball out from the back, which marks him out. ""The hardest bit is yet to come, but he has a good head on his shoulders and that's essential."" Born in Yaounde, the youngest of four children, Umtiti spent the first two years of his life in Cameroon before moving to Lyon with his family. Despite frequent overtures from the Cameroon Football Federation -- including approaches from one of the country's greatest players, Roger Milla -- Umtiti chose to represent France at youth level. He was a member of the France team that triumphed at the Under-20 World Cup in 2013. ""I still have family in Yaounde who I often speak to on the phone, but I have no memories of my two years in Cameroon,"" Umtiti told France Football magazine in March. ""I've been twice. It's part of my roots. The federation asked me several times to play for Cameroon. My advisers met Roger Milla at his request, out of politeness. ""They listened to his arguments, but nothing worked. My choice had already been made. Since the start, I wanted 'Les Bleus'."""
904,08/07/2016,15:14,Spanish investigators drop Neymar case,Spanish investigators on Friday dropped a fraud and corruption case against Brazilian superstar Neymar and his father in relation to the player's 2013 transfer to Barcelona.,"The case had been brought by the Brazilian investment fund DIS, former owners of the rights of the player, now 24 and who moved to the Camp Nou from Santos in his homeland three years ago. A judge ruled that the case ""could have sporting, ethical and disciplinary repercussions"" but said it ""cannot be pursued in the criminal courts"", according to a statement by Spain's High Court. DIS, which held 40 percent of Neymar's sporting rights when he played at Santos, had claimed it was cheated out of its real share of the transfer due to parallel contracts that Barcelona and Santos allegedly used to hide the true cost. The ruling comes less than a month after Barcelona accepted to pay a 5.5-million-euro ($6.2 million) fine over the contested transfer in a deal with prosecutors that allowed the club to avoid trial on tax evasion charges. The agreement freed up Barcelona president Josep Maria Bartomeu and his predecessor Sandro Rosell from possible criminal proceedings that could have seen them jailed. Barcelona had originally published the fee in the shady transfer as 57.1 million euros, with 40 million euros of that given to the player's family. But Spanish authorities believe the true transfer figure was at least 83 million euros. Santos -- where Neymar started his career -- received 17.1 million, 6.8 million euros of which went to DIS. But Spanish judicial authorities believe another 26 million euros from the parallel contracts were shared between Neymar, his family and Santos, with DIS and the taxman missing out on their cuts. Barcelona had already made a voluntary 13.5 million euros tax payment after being indicted for alleged tax fraud."

The Barcelona court found the Argentina international and his father Jorge Horacio Messi guilty of using companies in Belize, Britain, Switzerland and Uruguay to avoid paying taxes on 4.16 million euros of Messi's income earned from his image rights from 2007-09. The income related to Messi's image rights that was allegedly hidden includes endorsement deals with Danone, Adidas, Pepsi-Cola, Procter &amp; Gamble and the Kuwait Food Company. The court found Messi and his father, who has managed his son's affairs since he was a child, guilty tax fraud and ruled that for each of those three years they should serve a sentence of seven months. Messi, 29, a five-time world player of the year, was also fined 2.09 million euros while his father was fined 1.6 million euros. They can appeal the decision to Spain's Supreme Court. Messi told the court during the four-day trial that wrapped up on June 4 that he trusted his father with his finances and ""knew nothing"" about how his wealth was managed. Prosecutors had asked for Messi to be absolved, arguing there was no evidence that the player was aware of how his income was managed. But the state attorney representing tax authorities in the trial, Mario Maza, said he found it unlikely that Messi knew nothing about the situation. ""There is no deliberate ignorance here, it's fraud and that's all there is to it, because he didn't want to pay his taxes,"" he said. ""It's like a crime boss. At the very top is the bigwig who doesn't want to know about the details."" The court agreed, arguing in its ruling that Messi ""had decided to remain in ignorance"". ""Despite all the opportunities available to the player to show interest in how his rights were managed, he did not,"" the court added. The court said if the player was not punished, ""ordinary"" citizens could conclude that it was better to ""not show interest"" in their tax obligations. Messi's tax fraud trial has taken place against a backdrop of simmering voter anger over steep cuts to health and social spending, as the government struggles to bring Spain's public deficit down. The player and his father made a voluntary payment of 5.0 million euros -- equal to the amount of the alleged unpaid taxes plus interest -- in August 2013 after being formally investigated. After the court delivered its verdict, Barcelona issued a statement ""giving all its support to Leo Messi and his father"". ""The club, in agreement with the government prosecution service, considers that the player, who has corrected his position with the Spanish tax office, is in no way criminally responsible with regards to the facts underlined in this case,"" it added. Messi is Barcelona's all-time leading goalscorer. His verdict comes just six months after a Spanish court handed Barcelona's Argentine midfielder Javier Mascherano a one-year suspended sentence for tax fraud. He was found guilty of avoiding paying taxes on 1.5 million euros of income related to his image rights. Barcelona in June agreed to pay a 5.5-million-euro fine in a deal with prosecutors that sees the club avoid trial on tax evasion charges over its signing of Brazilian striker Neymar from Santos in 2013. Last week Spanish authorities disclosed that Brazilian international defender Dani Alves owes 1.3 million euros in overdue taxes and late payment fines.

But strings attached to the sale meant the contract was not fully completed. The deal said the land could be used to build 1,000 apartments, a hotel and an electricity power station alongside improved approach roads -- but for a range of reasons, these never went through. As a result, the cash, plus interest and legal costs, must now be repaid, according to a club statement seen by AFP. Barca's board of directors said city authorities had notified them of an arbitration decision to recover the land from the real estate firm, Inmobiliaria Mar. ""The club was forced to recover the land because the courts involved decided the requirements agreed upon in the contract from 2005 had not been met,"" the club said. The ruling is the latest in a series of financial blows for the Catalan club. Last month it had to pay a 5.5-million-euro fine over the controversial 2013 transfer of Brazilian star Neymar's after reaching a deal with prosecutors to avoid a trial on tax evasion charges. Then on Monday, the EU ordered seven Spanish football clubs, including Barcelona and Real Madrid, to pay back millions of euros in illegal state aid, ruling it gave them ""unfair advantage"" over rival clubs. EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager found the clubs were benefiting from unfair competition. Under European Union anti-trust rules, governments are not allowed to provide state aid to commercial enterprises if it distorts market competition. The EU ordered Spain to recover unpaid tax of up to five million euros ($7 million) from each of Barcelona, Real, Athletic Bilbao and Atletico Osasuna. Real were also ordered to repay 18.4 million euros for an overvalued land transfer from the club to the city.

Neymar has been a huge success for Barca on the pitch but a judicial nightmare off it. He helped them win the Spanish league last season for the second year in a row, narrowly beating their fierce rivals Real Madrid.

Neymar was named on Wednesday as the star of a young Brazil Olympic football squad for next month's Games in Rio de Janeiro. Brazil are looking to bounce back from a humiliating group stage exit from the Copa America Centenario this month. They are also hoping Olympic gold will help soothe the trauma of their devastating 7-1 semi-final loss to Germany in the 2014 World Cup on home soil. ""Neymar is different. He is one of the best players in the world. Any national team would want to have a player of his profile,"" the Olympic squad's coach Rogerio Micale told a news conference.

""Club lawyers and Neymar's lawyers are in the process of wrapping up."" Neymar, who joined Barcelona in 2013 from Brazil's Santos in a deal which has haunted all concerned because of alleged hidden payments, is under contract until 2018. But the 24-year-old prolific Brazil striker has also played brilliantly for the Catalan club as part of a much feared attacking trident alongside Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez. Speculation has mounted, however, around whether or not the slender forward would extend his stay or make another lucrative move, with Paris Saint-Germain, Real Madrid, Manchester United and Manchester City named among possible interested clubs. ""I read that there are many clubs interested in Neymar. It's normal they are but Neymar has never said he wants to leave Barca, just the opposite,"" Bartomeu said. ""Neymar wants to continue at Barca and Barca wants Neymar to continue with us."""

""Look at who just landed in Turin. Welcome Dani Alves,"" Juve posted above a photo of the player on Twitter. A video shows Alves getting into a car where he says ""Come on Juve, let's go"". After leaving Sevilla for the Camp Nou in 2008, the Brazilian claimed six La Liga titles and three Champions League winners' medals. Alves was part of the Brazil squad that was knocked out of the Copa America centennial edition in the United States in the group stages earlier this month."
915,13/06/2016,22:32,Barcelona to pay 5.5-million-euro fine over Neymar transfer,Barcelona on Monday accepted to pay a 5.5-million-euro ($6.2 million) fine over Neymar's contested 2013 transfer in a deal with prosecutors that sees the club avoid trial on tax evasion charges.,"""It was better to accept this agreement than continue on with the uncertainty that has dragged on for a long time over the Neymar case,"" Barcelona president Josep Maria Bartomeu told reporters, in reference to the transfer deal that authorities believe was undervalued, allowing the club to pay lower taxes in Spain. ""We have had to accept paying a 5.5 million euro fine due to a mistake in the 2011 and 2013 tax planning in the signing of Neymar,"" added Bartomeu. The agreement frees up Bartomeu and his predecessor Sandro Rosell from possible criminal proceedings that could have seen them jailed. Neymar's arrival in 2013 has been a huge success for Barca on the pitch but a judicial nightmare off it. The 24-year-old is being investigated in Brazil and Spain over his shady transfer from Brazilians Santos to Barca. Catalans Barcelona originally published the transfer figure as 57.1 million euros, with 40 million euros of that given to the player's family. But Spanish authorities believe the true transfer figure was at least 83 million euros. Brazilian investment fund DIS, which held 40 percent of Neymar's sporting rights when he played at Santos, claims it was cheated out of its real share of the transfer due to parallel contracts that Barcelona and Santos allegedly used to hide the true cost. Santos -- where Neymar started his career -- received 17.1 million, 6.8 million euros of which went to DIS. But Spanish judicial authorities believe another 26 million euros from the parallel contracts were shared between Neymar, his family and Santos, with DIS and the taxman missing out on their cuts. Barcelona had already made a voluntary 13.5 million euros tax payment after being indicted for alleged tax fraud."
916,07/06/2016,11:11,Spain prosecutors seek Neymar corruption trial,"Spanish prosecutors want Brazilian star Neymar tried over fraud allegedly committed during his 2013 transfer to FC Barcelona, a judicial source said Tuesday.","Prosecutors from Spain's top criminal court accuse the striker, his father, Barca's ex-president Sandro Rosell and the club itself of concealing the cost of the multi-million-euro transfer from Brazilian investment fund DIS. DIS held 40 percent of the 24-year-old's sporting rights when he played at Brazil's Santos club and has claimed it was cheated of its real share of the transfer due to parallel contracts that Barcelona and Santos allegedly used to hide the total cost. The case first came to light after fans and members of Barcelona launched an internal complaint, leading eventually to the resignation of Rossell. The transfer deal was originally valued at 57.1 million euros ($64.9 million) by Barca, 40 million of which was paid to the N&amp;N company owned by the player's father. Santos -- where Neymar started his career -- received 17.1 million, 6.8 million euros of which went to DIS. However, Spanish judicial authorities have estimated the number of simultaneous deals in the transfer amounted to at least 83.3 million euros -- with the difference allegedly going to Neymar and his family, and Santos. The Brazilian football star and his father have in the past defended themselves in the media. ""Before saying nonsense -- that we hid this, or hid that -- they should prove it,"" Neymar told Brazilian TV station Globo in February, when he was called to give evidence to a judge in Madrid. ""My father is doing everything to ensure that I can just focus on playing football. He handles the books. But in the moment when you see someone you love suffering, it starts to hurt."" Prosecutors want Neymar, his father Neymar Da Silva Santos, Rosell and FC Barcelona itself to be tried for ""private corruption among individuals."" They also wants Rosell, FC Barcelona, Brazil's Santos and its president to be tried for ""fraud."" Neymar's mother Nadine, meanwhile, could also be tried for having profited financially from the alleged fraudulous transfer. The Brazilian star has already given evidence to a judge in Spain as part of the probe, as has his father. Rosell and current Barcelona president Josep Maria Bartomeu were also called to testify in February but refused, insisting instead on the version of events they had given for a previous hearing. Investigators in Brazil have also launched proceedings against the football star and his father over the same case. Brazil's federal prosecution service has accused them of forging contracts to pay less tax. Last September, Brazilian authorities froze $47 million worth of the player's assets pending investigations."
917,03/06/2016,22:04,UEFA fine Barcelona for Catalan separatist flags,"Spanish champions Barcelona said Friday they have been fined 150,000 euros ($170,000) by UEFA after separatist flags were flown in the Camp Nou during Champions League games last season.","In a statement the Spanish champions said that they would do everything to overturn a punishment which they described as ""totally unjust and...opposed to the exercise of the freedom of expression."" Of the fine, 50,000 euros will be suspended if there is no repeat offence in the next two years. The Catalan 'estelada' -- which differentiates from the red and yellow Catalan flag by the presence of a five-pointed star within a blue triangle -- has in recent years become a symbol of the independence movement within Catalonia. European football's governing body considers it a political symbol and fined Barcelona 40,000 euros after it was flown during a Champions League group game against Bayer Leverkusen last September. The club was also fined 30,000 euros in July 2015 after it was flown during the Champions League final in Berlin the previous month, where Barca beat Juventus to lift the trophy."

The Catalan daily Sport said the 25-year-old Bartra, who is in Spain's Euro 2016 squad, will sign a five-year deal with the Bundesliga side. Bartra came through the ranks at the Camp Nou and was handed his top-team debut by Pep Guardiola in 2010. However, he found first-team football hard to come by under Luis Enrique in the season just finished as Barcelona won the double of La Liga and Copa del Rey. His departure follows the announcement that Brazilian right-back Dani Alves, 33, will be allowed to leave this summer."
919,03/06/2016,14:39,Spain prosecutors ask Messi be absolved in fraud trial,Spanish prosecutors called on Friday for Lionel Messi to be absolved and his father found guilty on the final day of the pair's high-profile tax fraud trial in Barcelona.,"The Argentina star and his father Jorge Horacio Messi have been accused of using companies in Belize and Uruguay to avoid paying taxes on 4.16 million euros ($4.6 million) of Messi's income earned from his image rights from 2007-09. Barcelona forward Messi's defence lawyers want both the five-time World Player of the Year and his father to be absolved. But the state attorney -- who in Spain intervenes in trials in parallel with prosecutors when the interests of a public organisation have been impacted, in this case the tax authorities -- wants both sentenced. ""Lionel Andres Messi must be absolved,"" Prosecutor Raquel Amado said in her closing argument, a day after the footballer took the stand and said he trusted his father with his finances and ""knew nothing"" about how his wealth was managed. ""There is no evidence that anyone explained anything to him."" But she maintained her accusation against his father, for whom she asked for a jail sentence of one-and-a-half years. Any such sentence would likely be suspended as is common in Spain for first offences carrying a sentence of less than two years. ""It's because Jorge Messi accepted it that this happened,"" she said. The income related to Messi's image rights that was allegedly hidden includes endorsement deals with Banco Sabadell, Danone, Adidas, Pepsi-Cola, Procter &amp; Gamble and the Kuwait Food Company. ""These contracts are in English, most certainly bulky,"" Amado argued. ""For a layperson, if they see so many lawyers signing it, they must believe that it's fine."" The companies in Uruguay -- which much of the probe centres on -- were created and managed by a Barcelona law firm with whom Messi's dad communicated. ""Mr. Jorge Messi cannot dodge his responsibility by accusing his advisors,"" she said. ""Fraud takes place because there is a decision in that direction."" Messi and his father did not attend the fourth and final day of the trial, in which defence lawyers and the state attorney have yet to make their closing arguments. The player had been due to jet off to the United States after his Thursday court appearance for the Copa America where Argentina take on defending champions Chile on Monday. No date has been set for when the court will issue its ruling."

""We don't like the fact he's going. His behaviour on and off the field here has been so exemplary and now he's decided to go. The decision is his and we will respect that,"" Fernandez told a press conference. Catalan Sports daily Sport claimed on Thursday that Alves had already signed with Italian champions Juventus. The 33-year-old international defender is under contract with Barcelona until June 2017 after signing an extension during 2015 at a period where Barcelona were banned from signing new players. ""At the time the contract extension was a logical decision as he's had a great season,"" said Fernandez. Alves has won six La Liga titles and three Champions League crowns with Barcelona."
922,02/06/2016,11:04,Messi appears in court at tax fraud trial in Spain,"Argentina and Barcelona football star Lionel Messi, one of the world's highest-paid athletes, arrived Thursday at a Barcelona court to take the stand for the first time at his tax fraud trial in Spain.","The 28-year-old, who wore a black suit and tie, was cheered and jeered as he emerged from a van accompanied by his father Jorge Horacio Messi. The two are accused of using a chain of fake companies in Belize and Uruguay to avoid paying taxes on 4.16 million euros ($4.6 million) of Messi's income earned through the sale of his image rights from 2007-09. Dozens of photographers and onlookers crowded behind metal barriers and a line of police that guarded the entrance of the court to catch a glimpse of the five-time Ballon d'Or winner. Most applauded but some jeered and criticised the player. ""If he cheated, he has to be sentenced no matter how much of an idol and Ballon d'Or winner he is. These are four million euros less to pay for hospitals, schools, firefighters, roads,"" Jose Seco de Herrero, 25, told AFP. ""Thief!,"" yelled out one onlooker. ""Go play in Panama,"" cried out another. The tax fraud trial comes at a time of simmering voter anger over steep government cuts to health and social spending, as the government struggles to bring Spain's public deficit down. Messi and his father will be questioned on Thursday on the third day of the trial. It is expected to wrap up on Friday. After his court appearance in Barcelona, Messi will jet off to the United States where Argentina take on Copa America defending champions Chile in their first game of the three-week tournament in California on Monday. The high-profile case kicked off on Tuesday without Messi, as he was recovering in his hometown of Rosario in Argentina from a lower back injury he suffered during a friendly match against Honduras last week. Under Spanish law, a defendant is not obliged to attend the full trial if prosecutors seek a jail sentence of less than two years -- as is the case here. Messi's former tax advisors came out in support of the football star when they took the stand on Wednesday, saying the player never handled his own wealth management. He ""didn't take any decisions and I didn't see anyone consulting him for anything"", Angel Juarez, one of the partners at law firm Juarez Veciana which managed Messi's tax affairs at the time, told the court. Inigo de Loyola Juarez, another partner and Juarez's brother, added: ""I don't know if any of my correspondence has been included in the case, but they will see that Lionel Messi does not appear in any of it."" The Barcelona forward and his defence team have long argued that Messi's father handled the footballer's finances without reporting to him, and the striker was not aware of any wrongdoing. Both Messi and his father, who has managed his son's affairs since he was a child, have been charged with three counts of tax fraud. Spanish prosecutors are seeking a jail sentence of 22-and-a-half months for them if they are found guilty, plus fines equivalent to the amount that was allegedly defrauded. But any such sentence would likely be suspended as is common in Spain for first offences carrying a sentence of less than two years. Messi and his father made a voluntary payment of 5.0 million euros ($5.6 million)-- equal to the amount of the alleged unpaid taxes plus interest -- in August 2013 after being formally investigated, which is expected to mitigate any sentence if they are found guilty. Messi has scored 314 goals in 348 appearances for Barcelona. He boasts eight La Liga titles and is a four-times winner of the Champions League and Copa del Rey with the club."

""I signed things, but I never look at the contracts. I don't know what I sign,"" he allegedly said. Messi and his father, Jorge Horacio Messi, are accused of using a chain of fake companies in Belize and Uruguay to avoid paying taxes on 4.16 million euros ($4.7 million) of Messi's income earned through the sale of his image rights from 2007-09. They have been charged with three counts of tax fraud. According to the alleged statement published by the Barcelona daily, the judge showed him several sponsorship contracts that he signed, but he did not remember them. ""This is something that my dad manages. And I trust him. I devote myself to playing football,"" he reportedly said. ""I do what he tells me to.""

The trial will run until June 2 -- the day when Messi is due to testify along with his father. The court appearance comes just days before he joins his Argentina teammates for the Copa America in the United States. Argentina take on defending champions Chile in their first game of the tournament in California on June 6. Messi and his father, Jorge Horacio Messi, are accused of using a chain of fake companies in Belize and Uruguay to avoid paying taxes on 4.16 million euros ($4.7 million) of Messi's income earned through the sale of his image rights from 2007-09. They have been charged with three counts of tax fraud. Spanish prosecutors are seeking a jail sentence of 22-and-a-half months for Messi and his father if they are found guilty, plus fines equivalent to the amount that was allegedly defrauded. But any such sentence would likely be suspended as it is common in Spain for first offences carrying a sentence of less than two years. Under Spanish law, a defendant is not obliged to attend the full trial if prosecutors seek a jail sentence of less than two years, which means Messi may only show up on June 2 for his testimony. The football star and his defence team have argued that the player's father handled his finances without reporting to him, and that the striker was not aware of any wrongdoing. ""My dad handled the cash,"" Messi said in September 2013 when he was questioned by a judge investigating the case at a court in Gavia, a town on the outskirts of Barcelona where the footballer lives. The player's father agreed. ""He has nothing to do (with these issues), he only plays football,"" Jorge Horacio Messi said. State prosecutors initially asked that the case against Messi be dropped, arguing the player only followed the instructions of his father who he ""trusted fully and blindly"". But the judge in charge of the case in October 2015 rejected the request, arguing in his ruling that ""there are rational signs that the criminality was committed by both accused parties"". The income related to Messi's image rights that was allegedly hidden includes endorsement deals with Banco Sabadell, Danone, Adidas, Pepsi-Cola, Procter &amp; Gamble and the Kuwait Food Company. Questions over the player's finances increased after Messi and his father were among those named in April in reports by international media who received a vast trove of data and documents leaked from a law firm based in Panama. The two men opened a company in Panama in June 2013, just after the allegations of tax fraud broke, to continue to hide income earned from image rights from Spanish tax authorities, Spanish news site El Espanol reported. The Messi family acknowledged the existence of the company but they said it was ""totally inactive"" and never had any funds. The scandal appears not to have dented the popularity of the footballer whom Forbes magazine says was the world's fourth highest paid athlete last year with earnings of $74 million. Both Barcelona and the Argentine Football Association have supported the player, who is loudly cheered whenever he appears on the pitch at the Spanish club's Camp Nou stadium. Barcelona managers have even insinuated that there is a conspiracy to tar the image of their star player, who has been key to the club's success on the pitch in recent years."

However, they resisted Sevilla's pressure after the break and Barca's numerical disadvantage was cancelled out in stoppage time when Ever Banega saw red for chopping down Neymar. Barca dominated the extra 30 minutes, but needed just six to finally make the breakthrough when Lionel Messi's sumptuous pass picked out Alba to volley into the far corner. Neymar then slotted home a second in the dying seconds from another brilliant Messi assist after Daniel Carrico had also been dismissed for two bookable offences. ""It was a great intense and exciting final,"" said Barcelona captain Andres Iniesta. ""It was a last push for the club to complete a magnificent season."" Sevilla were looking for a double of their own after winning a third consecutive Europa League by beating Liverpool 3-1 on Wednesday. However, just as in a thrilling 5-4 defeat to Barca to open the season in the European Super Cup in August, they fell just short as Luis Enrique's men claimed their fourth trophy of the season, having also won the Club World Cup in December. ""It has been a spectacular end to the season,"" added Barca boss Luis Enrique. ""The team has known how to compete marvellously despite the difficulties we have faced this season."" And Sevilla coach Unai Emery believes his side's exertions in midweek robbed them of the energy needed to make their numerical advantage count. ""We lacked freshness. If we had have been fresher we would have been able to create more chances,"" said Emery. ""Barca didn't have many opportunities, but they were efficient."" The political fallout over an initial ban on Catalan separatist flags by the Madrid authorities that was eventually overturned on appeal in the courts continued before kick-off as Barca fans jeered the Spanish national anthem. The game appeared to swing Sevilla's way nine minutes before half-time when Mascherano hauled down Gameiro just outside the box as he bore down on goal. Banega nearly doubled Barca's punishment as his sweet strike from the resulting free-kick was brilliantly tipped over the bar by Marc-Andre ter Stegen. Sevilla roared back from a goal down at the break to outclass Liverpool in midweek and started the second-half with intent once more as Banega's low drive came back off the post. Barca were then dealt another huge blow just before the hour mark when Suarez pulled up with a muscle injury before leaving the field in tears with his chances of representing Uruguay at the Copa America next month now in jeopardy. Sevilla were camped in the Barca half for much of the second half, but struggled to create clear-cut chances. Grzegorz Krychowiak saw a deflected effort flash just wide, whilst Vicente Iborra's appeals for a penalty after he clashed with Dani Alves were waived away. Parity was restored in numbers on each side in stoppage time when Banega saw red for tripping Neymar on the edge of the area, but Sergio Rico tipped over Messi's resulting free-kick to take the game into extra time. However, the Spanish international was left flat-footed when Alba latched onto Messi's ball over the top six minutes into extra-time and volleyed across goal into the far corner. Rico kept Sevilla in the game with brilliant saves from Pique and Sergio Busquets, whilst Dani Alves also hit the post from distance as Barca threatened a second. Sevilla's hopes of an equaliser were ended when Daniel Carrico was also sent-off for a second bookable offence. And Messi promptly teed up Neymar to round off Barca's fourth Cup triumph in eight years in stoppage time."

Thousands of Barca fans waved the Estelada flag, the repression of which the club had described as ""an attack on the freedom of expression."" Even more vociferous whistling of the anthem and the Spanish King Felipe VI at last season's Cup final at Barca's Camp Nou stadium saw the club hit with a 66,000 euro ($74,000) fine by the country's Higher Sports Council. The controversy over the flag ban dominated headlines in Spain just five weeks before a repeat general election in which the ruling conservative Popular Party is once again presenting itself as the best guarantor of national unity. One of Spain's 17 semi-autonomous regions with its own language and customs, Catalonia enjoys a large degree of freedom in education, health and policing. But fed up after years of demands for greater autonomy on the taxation front -- complaining it pays more to Madrid than it gets back -- the region has veered towards separatism."

Indeed, Barca could end the season with four trophies in total having also claimed the Club World Cup in December. Barca captain Andres Iniesta laughed off suggestions that a La Liga and Cup double is the minimum requirement for the Catalan giants to ease the pain of their Champions League exit to Atletico Madrid at the quarter-final stage last month. However, the Spanish international did admit Barca's success of winning six La Liga titles and three Copas del Rey in the past eight years has provoked a relentless demand for more trophies. ""When you win a league it's impossible for it to be a bad season. It will always be a good season,"" Iniesta said on Saturday. ""This team always has the obligation to win in a final. We fight for all the titles each season, sometimes we win and other times we don't, but the obligation to win is permanent. ""It is like that in every game we play, so imagine what it is like in a final. ""The club doesn't allow errors, dips or not winning things and this will not change."" Sevilla appear to have the significant disadvantage of having beaten Liverpool in the Europa League final just five days before facing Barca at Atletico Madrid's Vicente Calderon. By contrast, Luis Enrique's men have had a free week since Luis Suarez's hat-trick in a 3-0 win at Granada retained their league title. Enrique insisted he expects to win, but warned that Sevilla's experience in finals could pose Barca problems. ""I am an optimist, I think we are going to win,"" he said. ""Sevilla have brilliantly won again the Europa League final and they have the chance to do the double too which is very important for a team like Sevilla. ""They keep winning titles. With us they are one of the teams most used to playing finals and that will make tomorrow a very attractive match."" The action off the field has been dominated by a political row in the build up as Catalan separatist flags were initially banned from the stadium by the Spanish government before Barca successfully appealed that decision through the courts. ""Very few things surprise me in this country,"" said Enrique. ""In the end the logical thing has happened and the freedom of expression for everyone has been respected."" All three previous meetings between the sides this season have been settled by one goal as Sevilla won 2-1 at home in October in La Liga before Barca claimed victory by the same scoreline at the Camp Nou in February. ""We have their respect because we have earned it when we've faced them,"" said Sevilla coach Unai Emery. And Emery is keen to pile the pressure on Barca as favourites despite Sevilla's fantastic cup record in the three years since he took charge. ""They need this title because Barcelona feed off winning titles, but our strength is our desire,"" he added. ""These moments come around very rarely for us. How many times have Barca won the Cup? Loads. We haven't, but for us to play in tomorrow's final is a gift that we will happily unwrap."" Barca are expected to name an unchanged team from the side that started at Granada with Enrique afforded the luxury of choosing from a squad free of injuries and suspensions. Sevilla are without the suspended Steven N'Zonzi and Timothee Kolodziejczak, whilst Benoit Tremoulinas and Michael Krohn-Dehli remain sidelined by injury. However, Spanish international goalkeeper Sergio Rico and captain Jose Antonio Reyes could return after missing out against Liverpool in midweek."
933,20/05/2016,19:43,Spanish judge allows Catalan flags at Madrid cup final,A Spanish judge on Friday overturned a controversial ban on Barcelona fans flying Catalan flags at Sunday's Copa del Rey final against Sevilla in Madrid.,"The Madrid authorities had told Barcelona on Wednesday that the Estelada independence flags could not be flown at the Vicente Calderon stadium, the home of Atletico Madrid because they contravened a 2007 law. That legislation allowed for a ban on flags and symbols that are deemed to ""incite violence"" or ""show contempt for participants in a sporting event"". But the judge on Friday ruled that ""in no case had it been proven"" that the exhibition of the flags could ""incite violence, racism, xenophobia or any other form of discrimination that is an affront to human dignity"". Barcelona said they welcomed the judicial decision to allow the display of Estelada flags. ""The club celebrates that the judge's decision will allow the free expression of legal symbols and banners by its members and supporters,"" the Spanish champions said in a statement. ""At the same time, FC Barcelona expresses its concern about the reoccurrence of situations like the one on Wednesday, and which are an affront to the freedom of expression, and do nothing to benefit what has always been a celebration of football and sport. ""The club reiterates its commitment to the defence of the freedom of expression among its members and supporters."""

""That same week, the region is also hosting the prestigious Emir Cup Final, as well as games being played in the AFC League. ""The coincidence of the match with these major sporting events means that the game will now be postponed to a later date (to be announced shortly) in order to encourage the best possible attendance."" The news comes as talks over extending Qatar Airways' shirt sponsorship of the five-time European champions continues to stall. Barca signed a 150 million euro ($170 million) five-year deal with the Qatar Foundation in 2010 which runs out at the end of this season."
935,14/05/2016,20:55,Barca had to win La Liga twice over - Pique,"Barcelona defender Gerard Pique hailed the winning mentality of what he described as a ""unique generation"" of players after the Catalans sealed a sixth La Liga title in eight years with a 3-0 win at Granada on Saturday.","Fittingly, Luis Suarez was the Barca hero with a hat-trick to take his tally for the season to 59, including 14 in his last five games, as Luis Enrique's men recovered from an alarming April slump to win their last five matches by a combined score of 24-0. Barca lost three consecutive league games for the first time in 13 years last month and Pique said they had to win the title twice over after nearly blowing a 12-point lead over Real Madrid. ""For the circumstances we have had to win it two times. When we were nine or 10 points ahead we had it won and then with the dip there was a moment when it seemed like we had lost it, despite the fact it was still in our own hands,"" Pique told Movistar+. ""There is the sensation that 20 or 25 years ago this club wouldn't have won it because we would have drowned in our own pessimism, but I think this generation and this team has changed that. ""It is a winning team that, despite the difficult circumstances, has stood up to be counted. You can trust in this team because we continue to win titles."" Suarez's remarkable goalscoring season saw him become the first player in seven years to depose teammate Lionel Messi and Real Madrid's Cristiano Ronaldo to win the Pichichi trophy as La Liga's top scorer. Moreover, the Uruguayan's 40 league goals is more than anyone has ever struck in a single La Liga season bar Messi and Ronaldo. ""We are deserving champions. We had to suffer, the pressure was put on us in the final few games, but this team is built to win titles,"" said the former Liverpool striker. ""The 40 goals is thanks to all of my teammates, not just one or two because if it wasn't for them we wouldn't be enjoying this league title."" Barca boss Luis Enrique lauded his side's consistency after leading for the vast majority of the campaign. ""We played very well over the course of the season. We were top for many weeks and the most consistent team wins the title,"" said Enrique. ""We have won six of the last eight titles, which shows the club has a winning mentality. We must value each title win because each one is very difficult."" Barca could follow up last season's treble triumph with a double should they beat Sevilla in the Copa del Rey final next Sunday. And Enrique defended his side's record despite bowing out of the Champions League to Atletico Madrid at the quarter-final stage. ""We set out at the start of the season to win all trophies again as nobody had ever done. Sometimes people think not winning one is a disaster, but we know how difficult it is to win trophies,"" he added. ""In history just two teams have previously won consecutive doubles. We always set high objectives for ourselves and we will continue to do that."""
936,14/05/2016,19:05,Suarez hat-trick fires Barca to La Liga title,Barcelona sealed their 24th La Liga title as Luis Suarez took his tally for the season to 59 goals with a hat-trick in a 3-0 win at Granada to hold off Real Madrid's late-season surge.,"Real registered their 12th consecutive La Liga win, 2-0 at Deportivo La Coruna thanks to Cristiano Ronaldo's double, but finished a point behind their bitter rivals. Suarez's treble also sees him become the first player in seven years other than Ronaldo and Barca teammate Lionel Messi to win the Pichichi award for La Liga's top goalscorer with 40. ""We are deserving champions,"" said Suarez. ""We had to suffer, the pressure was put on us in the final few games, but this team is built to win titles."" Barca had seemed set to cruise to the title until a run of three consecutive defeats for the first time in 13 years last month. However, they bounced back like champions as, inspired by Suarez's 14 goals, they scored 24 times without reply in the last five games to win the title. ""We played very well over the course of the season. We were top for many weeks and the most consistent team wins the title,"" said Barca boss Luis Enrique. ""We have won six of the last eight titles, which shows the club has a winning mentality. We must value each title win because each one is very difficult."" Barca were put under pressure early on as Ronaldo struck after just seven minutes to put Madrid in front in La Coruna. However, their nerves were settled by a brilliant team move on 22 minutes as Neymar freed Jordi Alba down the left and his low cross was turned into an empty net by Suarez at the back post. Suarez then doubled Barca's advantage when he nipped in ahead of Andres Fernandez to head in Dani Alves's cross at the near post. Fernandez made excellent saves from a Messi free-kick that was arrowing towards the top corner and Neymar to keep Granada in the game after the break. And the Andalusians had the chance to set up a nervy finish but former Barca winger Isaac Cuenca's shot was beaten away by Marc-Andre ter Stegen. However, fittingly Suarez sealed a stunning season when he completed his hat-trick from Neymar's unselfish square pass. ""Six leagues from the last eight speaks of the cycle of success we continue to maintain and have to try to extend as long as possible,"" added Barca captain Andres Iniesta. Madrid's record 12-game winning streak to end the season wasn't enough to overcome the 12-point deficit they faced to Barca back in March. ""I am very proud of the players and what we have done,"" said Madrid boss Zinedine Zidane. ""We never gave up and we fought until the end."" However, victory secured second place ahead of Champions League final opponents Atletico Madrid, whilst Ronaldo moved past the 50 goal mark for the sixth consecutive season. The three-time World Player of the Year opened the scoring as he swept home Karim Benzema's mishit effort at the back post. Ronaldo's second was slightly fortuitous as his header was deflected past the helpless Stipe Pletikosa by Pedro Mosquera. However, the Portuguese could have had four before he was replaced at half-time with one eye on the Champions League final on May 28 as he also hit the post and the crossbar before the break. Atletico finished just three points behind Barca in third as second-half goals from Fernando Torres and Antoine Griezmann handed them a 2-0 win over Celta Vigo. Torres hooked home the opener in spectacular fashion from Koke's corner and nearly repeated the trick with a similar effort three minutes later which came back off the bar and fell invitingly for Griezmann to head home his 32nd goal of the season. Defeat saw Celta finish the season in sixth as Athletic Bilbao took fifth place with a 3-1 win over an under-strength Sevilla side ahead of their Europa League final against Liverpool on Wednesday."

Barcelona will play a first pre-season game on July 30 against Celtic in Dublin as part of the International Champions Cup.

938,08/05/2016,19:13,"Five-star Barca edge towards title, Atletico beaten","Barcelona are one win away from retaining their La Liga title after Lionel Messi, Luis Suarez and Neymar all scored as they thrashed Espanyol 5-0 in the Catalan derby on Sunday.","Real Madrid moved into second place, a point behind Barca with one game remaining, as they racked up an 11th straight La Liga win, 3-2 over Valencia, thanks to two goals from Cristiano Ronaldo. However, Atletico Madrid's title hopes are over as they lost 2-1 at already relegated Levante. Barca will be champions with victory at Granada next weekend, who crucially are now mathematically safe from relegation after a 4-1 win at Sevilla. Real Madrid travel to Deportivo la Coruna on the final day of the season. Elsewhere, Sporting Gijon remain out of the relegation zone thanks to their superior head-to-head record with Getafe after the two drew 1-1. Rayo Vallecano also remain in the bottom three after losing 2-1 at Real Sociedad. Barca were out to avoid a repeat of their title collapse in 2007 when a last-minute equaliser from Espanyol at the Camp Nou on the penultimate day of the season handed Real the title. The world club champions got off to a perfect start when Messi curled a delightful free-kick into the top corner. Ivan Rakitic had a second ruled out for offside minutes later as Barca tried to kill the game off as early as possible. However, they had to wait until seven minutes into the second half for the second as Messi teed up Suarez to fire high past Pau Lopez. Suarez maintained his four-goal lead over Ronaldo as the league's top scorer as he powered home his 56th goal of the season from Neymar's corner. A howler from Lopez handed Rafinha an open goal to tap home his first goal since suffering a serious knee injury at the start of the season, before Neymar rounded off the scoring. Madrid shrugged off the absences of Gareth Bale and Luka Modric through injury to move above Atletico for the first time in 2016 with victory over Valencia. Ronaldo missed a huge chance to open the scoring when he fired too close to Diego Alves, but the three-time World Player of the Year made amends with his next opportunity moments later when he fired into the far corner for his 48th goal of the season. Valencia felt hard done by for Madrid's second three minutes before half-time as the referee overruled his linesman, who had flagged Karim Benzema offside, before he slotted home as the ball through to the French striker deflected off Valencia defender Joao Cancelo. The visitors' bright start to the second period was rewarded when Rodrigo pounced on an error from Raphael Varane to halve the deficit. Ronaldo quickly restored Real's two-goal advantage, but Andre Gomes ensured a nervy finish when he smashed home from the edge of the box before Valencia were reduced to 10 men late on when Rodrigo was shown a straight red card. Atletico paid for their exertions in setting up a second all-Madrid Champions League final against Bayern Munich in midweek, despite getting off to a brilliant start when Fernando Torres opened the scoring from Koke's pass after two minutes. Diego Simeone had left inspirational central defender Diego Godin and top scorer Antoine Griezmann on the bench and was made to pay when Victor Casadesus headed Levante level on the half hour mark. Griezmann was introduced for the second half and came closest to finding a winner for Atletico when Diego Marino turned his near post effort wide 15 minutes from time. But Giuseppe Rossi finished off a sweeping Levante counter-attack in the final minute to end Atletico's hopes of an unlikely second title in three years."
939,07/05/2016,14:30,"La Liga, not old Espanyol ghosts on the line - Luis Enrique",Barcelona coach Luis Enrique insisted his side won't be distracted by local rivals Espanyol's desire to destroy their La Liga title chances in the Catalan derby on Sunday.,"Luis Enrique's men hold the slenderest of advantages in the title race with two games remaining as they lead Atletico Madrid thanks to their better head-to-head record while Real Madrid lie a point behind in third. In eerily similar circumstances Barca were embroiled in a three-way title race with Sevilla and Real when Espanyol travelled to the Camp Nou on the penultimate day of the season nine years ago. Then, a last-minute equaliser from Raul Tamudo, which came to be known as the ""Tamudazo"", snatched the title from Barca's grasp and allowed Real to be crowned champions the following weekend. ""The Tamudazo doesn't interest me at all. I don't remember what happened four weeks ago let alone nine years,"" Luis Enrique said on Saturday. ""I am only worried about being better than Espanyol. ""They are different games. It is a derby where the league is in play so it is even more transcendental. ""It is our last game at home and we have to go for it from the off."" Barca's once commanding nine-point lead was whittled down due to three consecutive league defeats last month. However, they have scored 16 goals without reply in winning their last three matches and the coach believes his side have shown the character needed to turn the situation around and retain their title. ""I don't see there being a delicate situation here. The only thing is that we have lost our advantage. ""In the lst three games we have won 8-0, 6-0 and 2-0. We have lost the advantage because our rivals keep winning, but the league is won in 38 games not in 30, nor in 10."" Indeed, Barca could even be proclaimed champions on Sunday if they win, Atletico lose at already relegated Levante and Real drop points at home to Valencia. Both Atletico and Real booked their places in the Champions League final in midweek and Luis Enrique is hoping for a European hangover for the sides from the Spanish capital to avoid Barca needing to win at a Granada side fighting for their lives next weekend. ""Tomorrow we have the chance to be champions. Why not? We are the only ones with that possibility,"" he added. ""I am only interested in tomorrow's game. We will then see what happens and if Granada are safe or not. We are concentrating on Espanyol and the chance to win three points which could make us champions."" Luis Enrique is expected to make just one change from the side that beat Real Betis last weekend with Marc-Andre ter Stegen replacing the injured Claudio Bravo in goal."
940,07/05/2016,01:40,Espanyol eye bursting Barca's bubble once more,Espanyol travel to La Liga leaders Barcelona on Sunday aiming to repeat their feat of denying their bitter local rivals the title in 2007.,"Barca hold the slenderest of advantages in the title race with two games remaining as they lead Atletico Madrid thanks to their better head-to-head record with Real Madrid a point behind in third. In eerily similar circumstances Barca were embroiled in a three-way title race with Sevilla and Real when Espanyol travelled to the Camp Nou on the penultimate day of the season nine years ago. Then a last minute equaliser from Raul Tamudo snatched the title from Barca's grasp and allowed Real to be crowned champions the following weekend. Tamudo's strike has gone down in Espanyol folklore as the ""Tamudazo"" and has become more popular than even the goals he hit to land the club their last two trophies in the Copa del Rey finals of 2000 and 2006. After a 1-0 win over Sevilla last weekend to move to the brink of mathematically sealing their survival in the top flight, Espanyol fans chanted ""we want another Tamudazo"" whilst the players celebrated. ""I am dreaming about that,"" said Espanyol striker Felipe Caicedo when asked about the possibility of repeating Tamudo's strike. ""We know the difficulties of playing there, but I am a striker and I live to score. ""The dressing room is thinking about mathematically securing survival. If we achieve that the consequence will be taking the title from Barcelona."" However, Barcelona have recovered from their alarming dip of three consecutive league defeats last month to stay on top by scoring 16 goals without reply in their three games since. ""We don't fear a Tamudazo. With the fans behind us we expect to get the job done,"" said Barca defender Jordi Alba. ""We never thought the league was won. It is very tight, our rivals aren't slipping up and it is in our hands."" Barca boss Luis Enrique is expected to make just one change from the side that started the 2-0 win over Real Betis last weekend with Marc-Andre ter Stegen replacing the injured Claudio Bravo in goal. In contrast to Atletico and Real, Barca also have the advantage of having had a free midweek to prepare, whilst the sides from the capital were busy booking their places in the Champions League final. However, only a Barca win allied to an Atletico defeat and Real dropping points will allow the Catalans to be proclaimed champions on Sunday. Atletico were involved in a far more intense European tie as they clung on despite a 2-1 defeat to Bayern Munich on Tuesday to qualify on away goals. Coach Diego Simeone at least has a fully-fit squad to choose from for their visit to already relegated Levante. However, Atletico haven't won in their last five trips to Levante, including a 2-0 defeat when they were going for the title in 2014. ""Levante are professional and will be playing for pride,"" said Atletico defender Filipe Luis. ""I have bad memories of that stadium and I hope to settle the score. ""Winning that match and next week means we will have done our part."" Real Madrid have bigger injury concerns as the in-form Gareth Bale has been ruled out for Valencia's visit to the Santiago Bernabeu with a sprained knee joint. Goalkeeper Keylor Navas is also out with an achilles problem, whilst Karim Benzema and Casemiro are doubts having missed the 1-0 win over Manchester City that sealed their place in the Champions League final on Wednesday. Valencia have endured a horrible season to finish outside the European places, but have drawn at the Bernabeu in each of their last four visits in La Liga. There are also huge clashes at the bottom with four teams realistically fighting to avoid joining Levante in the second division next season. The two currently in the relegation zone face each other as Getafe host Sporting Gijon. Rayo Vallecano therefore need to get at least a point to avoid slipping into the bottom three when they visit Real Sociedad. Granada are a point outside the drop zone, but are also in desperate need of a win away to Sevilla because they host a Barcelona side going for the title on the final day of the season next weekend.

""Quite honestly, if (a transfer) were to happen, I would be very, very happy for Hatem who deserves to go to a club like Barca. ""But it is not done yet from what Hatem has said. They are in talks as are other clubs."" The 29-year-old will be out of contract at the end of the season and has successfully relaunched his career at Nice, his 17 league goals having the Cote d'Azur club on course to qualify for Europe. Ben Arfa, who also won a recall to the France squad earlier this season, is likely to make his final home appearance as a Nice player in Saturday's game against Saint-Etienne. The former Lyon and Marseille player's renaissance this season has come after he spent the first six months of 2015 without a club having had a loan spell at English Premier League side Hull City cut short before being released by Newcastle United. He is on a four-man shortlist for France's player of the year award alongside Paris Saint-Germain duo Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Angel Di Maria and Marseille midfielder Lassana Diarra."

According to the complaint, prosecutors accuse the Brazilian of defrauding fiscal authorities of 646,086 euros ($740,000) between 2011 and 2012 by not declaring revenues gained from the use of his image rights. Prosecutors say that Adriano and his club later settled the debt owed to Spanish tax authorities after these initiated a probe. But they still decided to take action against the 31-year-old, accusing him of having committed an offence. ""He won't have to pay back the money now, but pay a fine or whatever is adequate,"" they said. The news comes just weeks before Argentina star Messi and his father Jorge go on trial on May 31 for tax fraud for allegedly failing to declare 4.16 million euros in taxes related to his image rights between 2007 and 2009. Messi has not admitted to any crime, insisting it was his father who managed his finances. Argentina's Javier Mascherano, meanwhile, accepted a one-year suspended prison sentence and a fine of 816,000 euros in January for committing tax fraud of 1.5 million euros."
943,01/05/2016,02:15,Luis Enrique: Barca edging towards title,Barcelona coach Luis Enrique believes the Spanish champions took a big step towards retaining their title as they overcame 10-man Betis 2-0 on Saturday.,"Enrique's men still need to win their two remaining games against local rivals Espanyol and Granada to be assured of winning the league after Atletico Madrid and Real Madrid were also victorious on Saturday. Only Barca's superior head-to-head record separates them from Atletico with Real Madrid just a point behind in third. ""I have the sensation that it is closer all the time,"" said Enrique. ""The next game we have is a derby against Espanyol and I am sure the Camp Nou will be rocking."" Barca threw away a nine-point lead over Atletico with three consecutive La Liga defeats following a 39-game unbeaten run earlier this month. However, the Catalans have responded like champions by scoring 16 goals without reply in their three league games since to keep matters in their own hands. ""This is a very difficult league with three teams in the fight to win it,"" added Enrique. ""I think all three of us are playing at a good level, having a great season and I don't think any of the three are going to slip up, therefore we have to do our job. ""We have the privileged situation."" Barca were given a huge helping hand by two clear Betis errors as Heiko Westermann chopped down Ivan Rakitic to rightly see a second yellow card before half-time. And Rakitic was left with a tap in to open the scoring five minutes after the break after a mix-up between German Pezzella and Antonio Adan. Luis Suarez then sealed the points nine minutes from time from a sensational through ball by Lionel Messi to register his 54th goal of the season. ""I don't think we suffered at all. We were in control the whole time despite the adverse circumstances of a very dry pitch which affected both teams, Betis more than Barca,"" continued Enrique. ""In the move for the sending-off, if the pitch was quick the ball would have fallen to the centre-back first and I think we benefited from it in one of the goals too. ""It is always difficult to beat a well-organised team defensively like Betis. ""But in the second-half with the numerical advantage we created lots of chances and given the situation where only winning counts, I think we played well."""
944,30/04/2016,22:35,Barca beat Betis to remain top,Barcelona remain on top of La Liga with two games remaining as goals from Ivan Rakitic and Luis Suarez earned a 2-0 win over 10-man Real Betis on Saturday.,"On a day of high tension when all three title contenders were at one point top of the table, Antoine Griezmann came off the bench to score the winner in Atletico Madrid's 1-0 win over Rayo Vallecano to remain behind Barca solely due to their inferior head-to-head record. Gareth Bale's thunderous header 10 minutes from time kept an under-strength Real Madrid just a point behind the leaders in third in a 1-0 victory at Real Sociedad. Barca need to win their two remaining games at home to Espanyol and away to Granada to be assured of retaining their title and were given a huge helping hand by Betis despite an unconvincing performance. Heiko Westermann was deservedly sent-off 10 minutes before half-time when he chopped down Rakitic to see his second yellow card in seven minutes. Rakitic took advantage of more Betis generosity five minutes after half-time when he was left with the simple task to slotting into an empty net after German Pezzella and goalkeeper Antonio Adan failed to cut out Lionel Messi's cross. Suarez fired straight at Adan when gifted a golden chance by Messi to seal the points 17 minutes from time. However, the Uruguayan made amends from another sensational Messi through ball eight minutes later to register his 54th goal of the season. In San Sebastian, Bale inspired a Real Madrid side without the injured Cristiano Ronaldo and Karim Benzema to a 10th straight La Liga win. ""I am happy for him because he has had problems this season with injury, but when is fit you notice,"" Madrid boss Zinedine Zidane said of Bale. ""We could have scored earlier in the first-half, but we had to work until the end against a difficult side. ""I am happy with the performance and to get three points once again."" As well as the absent Ronaldo and Benzema, Madrid boss Zinedine Zidane rested Marcelo, Dani Carvajal and Toni Kroos with one eye on the return leg of their Champions League semi-final against Manchester City on Wednesday. Bale was a constant threat in the air as he twice saw powerful headers fly just wide as Madrid completely dominated the hosts before the break. The visitors continued to press after the break, but Geronimo Rulli looked set to end their title hopes as the Argentine made a brilliant save to deny Bale from another fine Rodriguez cross. Yet, a week after leading Real back from a two-goal deficit at Rayo Vallecano, Bale made the difference again when he got across his marker to bullet home a header from Lucas Vazquez's cross. Atletico boss Diego Simeone also showed his priorities lie with the second leg of their Champions League semi-final against Bayern Munich in midweek as he made seven changes to the side that beat the German champions 1-0 on Wednesday. However, Atletico's youngsters struggled for the opening 55 minutes until Griezmann rode to the rescue. The French international made a sensational and instant impact after coming off the bench as he controlled a loose ball on the edge of the area before thrashing a volley into the bottom corner for his 30th goal of the season. And despite a late Rayo onslaught, Atletico held out to record their 34th clean sheet of the season. ""The important thing was to win and on a personal level I'm happy to score the goal,"" Griezmann told Movistar+. ""Now we need to rest. We have a great game to come on Tuesday and we'll try to get a good result there to go through to the final."""

Gareth Bale ensured Real Madrid remain just a point behind in third as he struck twice to inspire a stunning fightback from a Cristiano Ronaldo shorn Madrid from two goals down to win 3-2 at Rayo Vallecano on Saturday. Suarez hit four as Barca bounced back from three consecutive league defeats in style with an 8-0 thrashing of Deportivo la Coruna in midweek, and his eight-goal week takes him three clear of Ronaldo in the fight to be La Liga's top scorer. ""I'm a little bit surprised,"" Suarez told Movistar+. ""I just want to enjoy the fact the goals helped the team in the second-half after a difficult first-half. ""We didn't play the ball at the speed we normally do and at half-time we had to reflect on the fact we weren't playing well. In the second-half we showed that we need to play with that intensity all the time."" Lionel Messi opened the scoring for Barca with a looping header into an empty net despite Sporting protests that Suarez had fouled goalkeeper Ivan Cuellar in the build-up. Yet, Barca had to wait until 25 minutes from time to make the game safe when Suarez slotted home his 50th goal of the season from Andres Iniesta's pass. The Uruguayan then added two more from the penalty spot after Roberto Canella handled and Antonio Sanabria upended Neymar inside the area. Neymar converted Barca's third spot-kick after Ognjen Vranjes was shown an incredibly harsh second yellow card for a push on the Brazilian. And Suarez rounded off the scoring when he smashed home Messi's pass off the inside of the post. Without the injured Ronaldo for the first time in La Liga this season, Real's title hopes looked set to end in the rain at Rayo when early goals from Adrian Embarba and Miku put Rayo 2-0 in front. However, Bale took responsibility to drag Madrid back into the game as he rose highest to power home Toni Kroos's corner 10 minutes before half-time. Madrid suffered another blow before the break as Karim Benzema limped off with a knee injury making him a serious doubt to face Manchester City in the first leg of their Champions League semi-final on Tuesday. Lucas Vazquez replaced the Frenchman and it was the diminutive winger who brought Real level in unusual fashion as he powered home a header from Danilo's cross six minutes into the second half. And fittingly Bale was the man to decide the game as he pounced on a loose pass midway inside the Rayo half and surged forward before striking low and hard past Juan Carlos for his 18th goal of the season. ""He is very happy to make the difference,"" Real coach Zinedine Zidane said of Bale. ""When we needed him he was phenomenal. He scored two, but even without speaking about the goals, he played very well."" Atletico were also forced to work for the three points ahead of their Champions League semi-final against Bayern Munich in midweek and could face further repercussions after coach Diego Simeone was sent to the stands at half-time in bizarre circumstances. Referee Mateu Lahoz punished the Argentine after an extra ball was thrown onto the pitch from near the Atletico bench to break up a dangerous Malaga counter-attack. ""It is clear the referee took the correct decision,"" said Simeone, who could face up to a three-game touchline ban. ""We hope it isn't too many games."" Correa eventually made the telling contribution just five minutes after coming on as a substitute as his shot from outside the box flicked off Raul Albentosa to leave Guillermo Ochoa helpless and Atletico recorded a 32nd clean sheet of the season to seal all three points."
946,22/04/2016,15:13,Messi fit to face Sporting - Luis Enrique,Barcelona coach Luis Enrique insisted Lionel Messi will be 100 percent fit to face Sporting Gijon on Saturday despite suffering a series of knocks in Barca's 8-0 hammering of Deportivo la Coruna.,"""He didn't have much luck with the blows in the game the other day, but he trained today and is in perfect condition,"" said Enrique on Friday. Luis Suarez led Barca's stunning return to form with four goals and three assists on Wednesday following a run of three straight La Liga defeats for the first time in 13 years. ""It is a perfect result which reinforces us and came at a marvellous time,"" added Enrique. Only Barca's superior head-to-head record separates them from Atletico Madrid at the top with four games remaining, whilst Real Madrid are only a point further back in third. The Catalans have a favourable run-in on paper, but face three sides in Sporting, Espanyol and Granada who are fighting to avoid relegation at the other end of the table. ""We have to continue what we saw against Deportivo in the four games that remain. It will interesting at the top and the bottom."" However, Enrique again rejected suggestions that his refusal to rotate the star front three of Messi, Suarez and Neymar in particular had been the cause of Barca's slump in the past month. ""My decisions depend on what the team needs. ""I normally make changes if I see the possibility to improve the team or due to tiredness. Last year I rotated a lot and people didn't like it then either."""

949,21/04/2016,17:51,"Barca present plans for open, increased capacity Camp Nou","Barcelona presented plans for the extensive renovation of their Camp Nou stadium on Thursday that will see the capacity of Europe's biggest stadium extended to 105,000 and an open facade to allow views across the city.","""It will be a unique stadium,"" said club president Josep Maria Bartomeu at the presentation inside the stadium attended by the first-team squad. ""It will be an open and attractive Camp Nou that will be a new icon in Barcelona."" Work will begin in 2018 with the new features not due to be completed until 2021, as Barca plan for the majority of the work to be done during the off-season to allow the team to continue playing their home games at the Camp Nou. ""It is great news for everyone, although everyone will enjoy it in a different way; some playing, some watching,"" said 31-year-old captain Andres Iniesta. Inaugurated in 1957, despite its size the Camp Nou has become outdated in its structure and facilities compared to the stadiums of many of Europe's other leading clubs. The renovation, which will be carried out by Japanese architects Nikken Sekkei, will increase the capacity from the current 99,350, improve access to the stadium and hospitality services, as well as introducing new technologies. A high-tech 47,000 square metre roof that will cover all four stands will be solar-powered and recycle rain water for the stadium's irrigation. The most striking element of the design is the open facade with sprawling concourses on every tier, the highest of which will offer a panoramic view of Barcelona from the sea to the mountains. A budget of 420 million euros ($477 million) has been estimated for the project that will be financed in large part by finding a naming rights sponsor, which Bartomeu also hopes will reduce the club's 320 million euro debt. Barcelona are the world's second richest club behind bitter rivals Real Madrid with a turnover in 2015 of 608 million euros. ""Without a limit of debt around 200 million euros, we will not start the project,"" added Bartomeu. ""We will do it without putting at risk the viability of the sporting project."" The renovation is part of the Espacio Barca project that will also modernise the facilities around the stadium, including a new arena for the Barca basketball team and increasing commercial space."

Brazil coach Dunga had been hoping to have his captain available for both tournaments, but Barcelona have insisted that Neymar needs to have adequate rest over the summer before the start of the next season.

However, only Barca's superior head-to-head record continues to separate them from Atletico Madrid at the top of the table with four games remaining as Fernando Torres's hot-streak continued with the winner in a 1-0 success at Athletic Bilbao. Real Madrid remain just a point behind the leaders in third as goals from Karim Benzema, Lucas Vazquez and Luka Modric ensured a 3-0 win over Villarreal. ""We are human, we aren't machines and we can all commit errors or have a bad game,"" Suarez told Spanish TV station Movistar+. ""Today is a demonstration that the group is more united than ever and desperate to win the league. It is still in our hands."" Barca had taken just one point from their last possible 12 in the league and been dumped out of the Champions League amidst a run of just one win in six games that threatened to derail their season. However, they remain in control of their own fate and few would bet against them winning their last four games and claiming a 24th Liga title after a performance as good as any in the 39-game unbeaten run they enjoyed prior to losing at home to Real Madrid earlier his month. Suarez settled the visitors' nerves after just 11 minutes when he outmuscled Sidnei to volley home the opener despite the hosts' desperate appeals for a foul. Ceslo Borges then missed two huge chances to bring Deportivo level as he was denied by Claudio Bravo and a last-ditch block by Bartra before Suarez gave Barca the cushion they desired when he latched onto Messi's sumptuous through ball to slot low past Manu. Suarez turned provider for Barca's third just after the break when his cross to the back post was volleyed home emphatically by Rakitic. Messi created the fourth with another defence splitting pass and Suarez kept his composure to seal his sixth hat-trick of a prolific season. Suarez was gifted his fourth of the night from Neymar's unselfish cross despite Laure blocking his initial attempt on the line for his 49th goal of the season. The former Liverpool striker then added a second assist to his four-goal haul as Barca again tore the Deportivo defence apart and his cut-back was gratefully tapped home by Messi. Bartra joined the party as he galloped forward from his own half without facing a single strong Deportivo challenge before firing into the far corner. And Neymar completed a perfect night for the Spanish champions when he tapped home at the far post from Suarez's third assist of a spectacular display for his first goal in six games. Torres's sensational form kept Atletico in the race as he scored for the fifth consecutive game with a towering header from Antoine Griezmann's cross for the only goal of the game seven minutes before half-time in Bilbao. However, victory came at a cost for Atletico as inspirational defender Diego Godin limped off with a hamstring injury that is likely to see him miss at least the first-leg of their Champions League semi-final against Bayern Munich. Even without Godin, Atletico handled Bilbao's aerial bombardment to register their 31st clean sheet of the season and keep their title hopes very much alive with three of their last four games to come at home. Real knew they had to win to realistically remain in the race as they kicked-off two hours after Barca ran riot in Galicia, but impressed again in racking up an eighth consecutive La Liga win. Benzema headed home his 27th goal of the season four minutes before half-time after Sergio Asenjo could only parry Cristiano Ronaldo's fierce effort. Vazquez was handed a rare start by Gareth Bale's absence through injury, but took full advantage of his opportunity as he raced onto Benzema's layoff before firing low past Asenjo to double Madrid's lead 21 minutes from time. However, Modric went one better with a sensational strike to volley home Danilo's cross six minutes later."

Now they are only ahead of Atletico thanks to a superior head-to-head record, while Real Madrid lurk just one point back ahead of a midweek round of games. ""I take comfort from my players. They are used to playing under maximum pressure. But we are in a situation where our opponents are punishing us without doing much,"" said Luis Enrique at a press conference ahead of Wednesday's trip to Deportivo. ""It is in our hands, but obviously we are in maximum difficulty. We must resolve our problems. It is always difficult to win away from home, all the more so in our situation,"" added the coach, whose side were held to a 2-2 draw at home by Depor in December having been two goals up. ""All that interests me is being better than Deportivo tomorrow (Wednesday). Beyond that, if we win our match we will move on to the next one and try to grow in confidence."" There are five games left in La Liga, with Barcelona's run-in seeing them host struggling Sporting Gijon and city rivals Espanyol and go to both Betis and Granada.

Only Barca's superior head-to-head record separates them from their Champions League conquerers Atletico Madrid at the top of the table with Real Madrid lurking just a point further back after a run of seven straight league wins. All three face tough tests on a Wednesday evening of action that will go a long way to settling the title with the fixture list for all three favourable in the final four games. Barca are up first as they travel to Galicia in a desperate search to snap their worst run of league defeats in 13 years. Coach Luis Enrique and key defender Gerard Pique insisted Barca can and will win the league if they play like they did against Valencia on Sunday despite slipping to a 2-1 defeat thanks to a mixture of bad luck, poor finishing and a brilliant goalkeeping display by Diego Alves. ""If there is a team capable of doing it and much more given what they have done, it is this Barca,"" said Enrique. ""We don't have any margin for error, but I prefer to lose like this than win playing badly,"" added Pique. ""Football is like this, sometimes it is marvellous, sometimes it is so cruel."" However, Pique's absence at the heart of Barca's defence through suspension will be a huge loss for Enrique with Marc Bartra expected to cover in the absence of Jeremy Mathieu and Thomas Vermaelen. Atletico face a daunting trip to Athletic Bilbao with the Basques still eyeing Champions League football next season having moved to within six points of fourth-placed Villarreal at the weekend. A 2-1 victory at San Mames propelled Atletico towards the title two years ago and Diego Simeone's men could be further boosted by the absence of Bilbao's two top scorers this season in Aritz Aduriz and Inaki Williams through injury. ""We have the possibility to play an important game in Bilbao and continue competing in the four games left afterwards,"" said Simeone when quizzed on Atletico's title chances. ""It will be difficult, but we have to do what the schedule demands of us and that is win, win and win again."" Atletico will be forced into at least one change as captain Gabi is suspended, but Fernando Torres will start alongside 29-goal Antoine Griezmann up front after scoring in four consecutive games for the first time since he was at Liverpool in 2010. Real will have the advantage of knowing what Barca and Atletico have done when they kick-off in the late game at home to Villarreal. Zinedine Zidane could afford the luxury of resting the likes of Sergio Ramos, Casemiro and Luka Modric for Saturday's 5-1 rout of Getafe on Saturday with all three expected to return. The much-criticised Danilo is also expected to start at right-back with Dani Carvajal a major injury doubt. There are also huge clashes at the bottom of the table with four teams separated by two points in the battle to avoid relegation. Two of them face each other as Granada host Levante on Thursday looking to open up a gap on the bottom three. Getafe go in search of their first win in 14 games at Real Sociedad, whilst Sporting Gijon look to take advantage of Sevilla's poor recent run when they host the Europa League semi-finalists at El Molinon.

Third-placed Real Madrid are also only a point behind thanks to their 5-1 win at Getafe on Saturday. Valencia were beaten 7-0 by Barca on their last trip to the Camp Nou just two months ago, but gained revenge thanks to Ivan Rakitic's own goal and Santi Mina's classy finish before half-time. Messi ended a five-game goal drought to bring up his 500th for club and country, but couldn't inspire a Barca fightback as their alarming collapse in recent weeks continued after a 39-game unbeaten run. Having looked well set for a second consecutive treble just two weeks ago, Barca could now miss out on all three major trophies as they were dumped out of the Champions League by Atletico in midweek and have taken just one point from their last four La Liga games. Barca started brightly, but were repeatedly denied by fine saves from Valencia goalkeeper Diego Alves. The Brazilian blocked Messi's volley from close range before somehow springing to punch away Neymar's lob which seemed destined to evade him. Valencia had already served a warning of the threat they could cause on the counter-attack when Rodrigo side-footed inches wide from the edge of the area. However, they amazingly went in at half-time two goals to the good having had just one shot on target. The visitors went in front on 27 minutes when Rakitic turned Guilherme Siqueira's cross into his own net at the near post. Alves produced another brilliant save to parry Messi's downward header moments later, but Valencia doubled their lead thanks to a brilliant move in first-half stoppage time as Dani Parejo played in Mina to fire into the far corner. Rakitic had a huge chance to make amends for his own goal a minute into the second-half, but pulled his effort tamely wide from Luis Suarez's fine cut-back. However, Barca were finally given hope when Jordi Alba's low cross was turned home by Messi to reach another historic landmark. Alves came to Valencia's rescue once more with his best save of the night low to his right to prevent Rakitic equalising 15 minutes from time. Neymar's fiercely struck volley was somehow deflected behind by Shkodran Mustafi, but Valencia should also have killed the game off at the other end when Paco Alcacer miscued from point-blank range allowing Sergio Busquets to clear off the line. Gerard Pique then had a glorious chance to salvage at least a point, but he pulled his shot wide with just Alves to beat. In contrast to Barca's collapse, Atletico are flying in the final stages of the season as Fernando Torres struck his fourth goal in as many games in a routine win over Granada. ""It will be tough (to win the league), but we will play as the schedule demands us to which is to win, win and win again,"" said Atletico boss Diego Simeone. Koke ensured Atletico would have no hangover from their efforts in dispatching Barca from the Champions League in midweek as he swept home the opener on 15 minutes before teeing up Torres to dink home just before the hour mark. Substitute Angel Correa rounded off the scoring with a cool finish seven minutes from time."
955,04/04/2016,19:32,Messi denies tax evasion in Panama Papers scandal,The family of Lionel Messi denied on Monday that he was involved in tax evasion after the Barcelona star emerged as one of many personalities accused of shady offshore dealings in the Panama Papers scandal.,"""The Messi family wants to make clear that Lionel Messi has not carried out any of the acts attributed to him, and accusations he created a...tax evasion plot, including a network of money-laundering, are false and insulting,"" it said in a statement. The scandal erupted on Sunday when media groups made public a year-long worldwide investigation into a trove of 11.5 million documents leaked from a Panama-based law firm that exposed a tangle of offshore financial dealings by the elite. Among the accused are close associates of Russian President Vladimir Putin, relatives of Chinese leader Xi Jinping, Iceland's Prime Minister Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson as well as sports celebrities and screen stars. Messi and his father are named as owners of a Panama company that had not previously been disclosed during a Spanish probe into their tax affairs. ""The Panama company to which they refer to is a totally inactive company that never had any funds or any open current accounts,"" the Messi family said. They added that the firm was created by the family's former tax advisers and that everything had since been brought into line where Messi's fiscal situation was concerned. Barcelona published a message of support to their star player on their official website. ""The club supports the arguments which the Messi family published in a statement today,"" said the Barca statement. ""Since the very first moment that the 'Panama papers' which accuse Leo Messi were released, FC Barcelona has sent its affection and support to the player and to his whole family. ""The Club makes all of its judicial means, fiscal and administrative, at the family's disposal in order to make his actions and honour clear in this case."" Messi and his father Jorge have been charged with tax fraud in a separate case for allegedly failing to declare 4.16 million euros ($4.74 million) in taxes related to his image rights between 2007 and 2009 through front companies in Belize and Uruguay. The pair are accused of ceding the player's image rights to the companies in order to avoid declaring money made from lucrative deals with sponsors in Spain. Their trial in this case is set to begin on May 31 at a court in Barcelona and is expected to run until June 3. Lawyers acting on behalf of the tax office have asked for both defendants to be slapped with prison sentences of 22-and-a-half months. Both father and son have denied the accusations and instead blamed a former financial advisor. Jorge Messi made a voluntary corrective payment of four million euros in August 2013 which is expected to mitigate any sentence. Even if convicted it is unlikely that either Messi or his father would enter prison as jail terms of less than two years are usually suspended for first-time offences in Spain. In December Messi and his father were cleared of separate allegations relating to charitable friendlies played in 2012 and 2013 after a judge heard testimony from an Argentine businessman who organised the matches. The player had been investigated in that case to see if he had failed to declare to the tax man any revenue made from taking part in a series of friendlies in Mexico, Colombia, the United States and Peru. In other developments related to the Panama Papers, a member of FIFA's Ethics Committee, Juan Pedro Damiani, has come under investigation due to his business dealings with fellow Uruguayan Eugenio Figueredo, a disgraced former football official who is mentioned in the papers. ""We confirm that on March 19th the investigatory chamber of the independent Ethics Committee was informed by the chairman of the adjudicatory chamber, Hans-Joachim Eckert, about becoming recently aware of a business relationship between the member of the adjudicatory chamber Juan Pedro Damiani, and Eugenio Figueredo Aguerre,"" said a FIFA Ethics Committee statement sent to AFP. ""After receiving the information Dr. Cornel Borbely, chairman of the investigatory chamber of the Ethics Committee, has immediately opened a preliminary investigation to review the allegations in question. Dr. Borbely is currently looking into said allegations in order to determine if there is a breach against the FIFA Code of Ethics and decide any further measures."" Figueredo is facing corruption and extortion charges in Uruguay while the US has asked for him to be extradicted to face their FIFA corruption scandal investigation into millions of dollars of bribes being paid in return for commercial contracts at major football tournaments. Damiani risks a charge of conflict of interests due to his business ties to Figueredo."

""They don't scare us, but they are having an spectacular season. At the moment they are the second best team in Spain, as the league shows,"" Pique said on Monday. ""It will be more difficult than Saturday because they are a team that sits deep and breaks well on the counter-attack. ""In the end it depends on us. If from the first minute we want the ball, move it quickly, the fans are with us like they were on Saturday, and it all comes together, I think we are almost unstoppable."" Often keen to spice up the rivalry between Barca and Real Madrid, Pique had put the hosts in front at the weekend before goals from Karim Benzema and Cristiano Ronaldo turned the game around. Barca paid homage to legendary former player and coach Johan Cruyff before the game and Pique claimed the Dutch great's legacy had been to turn the rivalry between Madrid and Barca around as the Catalans go in search of a second consecutive treble. ""We need to be confident in ourselves. If we talk about Cruyff, he arrived in 1988 (as coach) when I was one-year-old,"" added Pique. ""When he arrived, beating Madrid saved Barcelona's season, it was our goal. Now we are in 2016 and the roles have changed."" Indeed, despite a first defeat in six months, Barca are still well-placed to repeat their treble feat as they also face Sevilla in the final of the Copa del Rey on May 22. ""The game on Saturday is forgotten. What concerns me is winning La Liga, the Champions League and the Copa del Rey,"" Pique continued. ""Everything is well-set and I am convinced we are going to win. We lost a game, we congratulate them and move on. This team is capable of winning everything. ""We have all the ingredients to play a great game tomorrow."" Barca boss Luis Enrique insisted he has ""blind faith"" in his players and his side's style of play despite being consistently caught out by Real's prowess on the counter-attack even when Barca were leading at the weekend. Atletico knocked Barca out at this stage of the competition two years ago on their way to the final. However, Enrique has won all six of his meetings as coach against Diego Simeone's men since taking charge at the start of last season. ""Atletico Madrid are a top team with a clear style of play,"" said Enrique. ""That is why they are where they are, competing with Barca and Madrid despite not having the same financial conditions. ""It doesn't matter what happened on Saturday, they are an opponent that will make our lives difficult."" Enrique is expected to make only one change with Marc-Andre ter Stegen replacing Claudio Bravo in goal. Atletico boss Diego Simeone confirmed Fernando Torres will start up front for the visitors after scoring in a 5-1 rout of Real Betis on Saturday. However, Atletico have big problems at the centre of their normally rock-solid defence. Diego Godin is expected to shrug of a hamstring injury to start, but with Stefan Savic and Jose Maria Gimenez doubtful, 20-year-old Lucas Hernandez looks set to face Barca's fearsome front three of Lionel Messi, Luis Suarez and Neymar."

""But the prospect of living in a city like Paris, and to play for a club like PSG is also a dream for every player. ""That's to say if PSG showed interest in Neymar we could talk about it."" PSG have dominated Ligue 1 since the Qatari takeover of the French capital club in 2011. Laurent Blanc's men wrapped up their fourth successive league title in record time in March, and face Manchester City in the Champions League quarter-final first leg at the Parc des Princes on Wednesday. And with talisman Zlatan Ibrahimovic, courted by some of Europe's top clubs, in possibly his last season in France, PSG have reportedly identified Neymar as their number one target before the new season starts in August. Ribeiro added: ""A contract can also be dissolved on condition of paying the release clause. It's huge - 193 million euros. ""But I don't think that would be an insurmountable problem for PSG."" Ribeiro's comments caused a stir in Spain, with Barcelona defender Gerard Pique suggesting he could never envisage Neymar leaving the European champions. ""Neymar's not going to leave Barca, I'm certain of that, I know him and I know he won't be leaving,"" the Spanish international told a press conference ahead of Tuesday's Champions League quarter-final first leg with Atletico Madrid. ""We're at Barca, nobody wants to leave here! People are thrilled to be at the club, it's total good fortune to play for this side, in this city, with these fans. ""We have everything, what more could you want? I'm convinced that all the players will stay."""
958,04/04/2016,01:45,Barca seek Clasico tonic in Champions League,"Holders Barcelona will seek to overcome their defeat in El Clasico when they host Atletico Madrid on Tuesday in an all-Spanish Champions League quarter-final, first leg at the Camp Nou.","On a night when Barca paid tribute to the late Dutch great Johan Cruyff, the Catalan giants' 39-game unbeaten run came to a halt after goals from Karim Benzema and Cristiano Ronaldo erased Gerard Pique's opener. ""For me this game is history,"" said Barca coach Luis Enrique, electing to turn the page rather than reflect on Saturday's loss. ""There is no pain. We came into the game on the back of many games without losing, but defeats can teach you things and the players know that."" Barcelona have won the last six meetings with Atletico, but it was Los Rojiblancos who advanced when the two sides clashed at this stage of the 2013-14 competition -- the only time Barca have failed to reach the semis in the past eight seasons. Bayern Munich host Portuguese league leaders Benfica in the first leg with Pep Guardiola's side bidding to reach the last four for the fifth year running. Bayern laboured to a 1-0 win at home to Eintracht Frankfurt as they remained five points clear of Borussia Dortmund in the Bundesliga, but skipper Philipp Lahm warned they would need to up their level against Benfica. ""After an international break it's often difficult. That's perfectly normal,"" said Lahm. ""I think it's going to be a completely different match (on Tuesday). We'll be perfectly prepared. We need a better performance, but I'm not worrying about that."" Bayern will be without Arjen Robben at the Allianz Arena, but the hosts should have France winger Kingsley Coman available after sitting out Saturday's victory with a leg injury. Zlatan Ibrahimovic powered Paris Saint-Germain to a 4-1 win over Nice at the weekend and the French champions will again look to their Swedish star when they take on Manchester City at the Parc des Princes on Wednesday. Paris reached the Champions League semi-finals in 1994-95, but City, despite their indifferent Premier League displays, are through to the last eight for the first time. Manuel Pellegrini's side rediscovered some form at the weekend though with a 4-0 demolition of Bournemouth, and PSG midfielder Thiago Motta said it would take a complete team effort to overcome City. ""It's not Ibra against City. It's Paris Saint-Germain against City. In my head, I've never thought about taking to the pitch and winning a game all alone. It's impossible,"" Motta told French daily L'Equipe. ""If we put pressure on him like that, and if he puts it on himself like that, we're not good. If we win, we'll win as a team."" Marco Verratti is sidelined for PSG and Javier Pastore is doubtful, while captain Vincent Kompany is missing for City who are also sweating over the fitness of Joe Hart and Yaya Toure. Six straight wins have reignited Real's season but the Champions League represents their only realistic chance of silverware this term. Zinedine Zidane's men travel to Germany on Wednesday for a first-ever meeting with Wolfsburg and head into the tie as heavy favourites against a side embarking on their best run in Europe's premier competition. However, Wolfsburg have won just three of their last 15 Bundesliga games and were soundly beaten 3-0 at Bayer Leverkusen on Friday. ""Things don't look good for us right now. You can't say we deserve to be higher in the standings than we are right now,"" said Julian Draxler, with Wolfsburg languishing in eighth place in Germany. The mood is far more upbeat in the Real camp having avenged November's 4-0 home drubbing at the hands of Barca, with Wales star Gareth Bale optimistic they can finish the season in style. ""We're feeling strong, confident now, and it's one final push until the end of the season,"" said Bale. ""(Saturday's win) really does put us mentally in a strong position, we can beat anyone on our day and we showed that. ""Barcelona have been saying they're the best team and we beat them in their own backyard."""
959,02/04/2016,22:33,Ronaldo winner ends Barcelona's 39-game unbeaten run,Cristiano Ronaldo struck the winner as 10-man Real Madrid came from behind to end Barcelona's 39-game unbeaten run 2-1 in El Clasico at the Camp Nou on Saturday.,"Gerard Pique's towering header put the hosts in front on the night they honoured legendary former player and coach Johan Cruyff. Yet, Karim Benzema quickly levelled before Ronaldo fired home five minutes from time after Madrid captain Sergio Ramos had seen the 21st red card of his career. Victory reduces Barca's lead over third-placed Madrid to seven points with seven games remaining, but Atletico Madrid closed the gap on the leaders to six points with a 5-1 thrashing of Real Betis earlier on Saturday. There was an emotive homage to Cruyff before kick-off with over 90,000 fans holding up a display reading ""Thank you Johan"" alongside a Barca jersey with the number 14 the Dutch great adorned during his playing career. Once the action got underway, Barca started by far the better and only an incredible miss by Luis Suarez let Madrid off the hook on 10 minutes. Neymar unselfishly squared for his Uruguayan strike partner, but Suarez failed to make any connection from his low cross with the goal at his mercy. Keylor Navas was then forced to make a smart save from Ivan Rakitic as Madrid struggled to contain wave upon wave of Barca attack. The hosts were enraged midway through the half when Lionel Messi looked to have been brought down by Ramos right on the edge of the area, but referee Alejandro Jose Hernandez waived play on with Ramos already having been booked. Madrid grew into the game as the first-half progressed and finally threatened the Barca goal when Ronaldo's shot was beaten away by Claudio Bravo before Gareth Bale blazed a volley over from a narrow angle. Barca started on the front foot again after the break and Navas made a brilliant save to prevent Messi's cheeky chipped effort floating in at the far post. Yet, that save only momentarily denied Barca as Pique rose highest to power home Rakitic's corner on 56 minutes. The lead lasted just six minutes, though, as Benzema swivelled by blast home Toni Kroos's deflected cross into the bottom corner. Bale had the chance to turn the game on its head, but his tame effort on his favoured left foot was easily held by Bravo as Madrid again threatened on the counter-attack. The Welshman did have the ball in the net nine minutes from time, but was incredibly unfortunate to be penalised for a push on Jordi Alba as he headed in. Ronaldo then fired against the bar and Bravo saved a one-on-one with Bale as Madrid's pace on the break began to tear a tired-looking Barca apart. The visitors' hopes of a famous win looked to have gone when Ramos was finally given his marching orders for a second booking after chopping down Suarez seven minutes from time. Yet, just two minutes later Ronaldo struck the winner as he controlled Bale's cross to the far post before slotting under Bravo."
960,02/04/2016,20:39,"90,000 Barca fans, players remember Cruyff at El Clasico","Over 90,000 Barcelona fans took part in a spectacular pre-match display in honour of legendary former player and coach Johan Cruyff ahead of El Clasico against Real Madrid on Saturday.","The display read ""Thank you Johan"" alongside a Barca jersey with the number 14 the Dutch great wore during his playing career. A video dedication of Barca's greats, including the club's most successful ever coach Pep Guardiola, thanking Cruyff was played before a minute's silence was held in his honour before kick-off. Cruyff's son Jordi -- a former Barca player himself -- was joined by seven former Barcelona presidents in the directors' box. As a player Cruyff ended Barca's 14-year wait to win La Liga in 1974. However, his greatest achievements with the club came as a coach as he won four consecutive league titles between 1990 and 1994, as well as delivering the club's first European Cup in 1992."
961,01/04/2016,18:29,Luis Enrique: Cruyff would want Barca Clasico win,Barcelona coach Luis Enrique insists the best homage his side can pay to club legend Johan Cruyff is to beat Real Madrid in the Clasico on Saturday in a style the Dutch great would have appreciated.,"The match at the Camp Nou is Barca's first since former player and coach Cruyff died at the age of 68 last week after a short battle with lung cancer. A display reading ""Thank you Johan"" will be held aloft by over 90,000 fans pre-match with the same message carried on the Barca players' shirts. ""I am sure that what Cruyff would want more than any homage is that we win thanks to good football, putting on a spectacle and deserving it on the pitch,"" Luis Enrique said on Friday. Barca go into the game in pole position as they lead third-placed Madrid by 10 points in the title race in La Liga with just eight games remaining. The visit of Zinedine Zidane's men on his first experience of the Clasico as a coach gives Barca the chance to extend their unbeaten run in all competitions to 40 games. Lionel Messi can also bring up another significant milestone as he is just one goal away from 500 in his career for club and country. ""It is a figure from another galaxy. Not even including goals in training would many players, including myself, get anywhere near that number,"" he added. Yet, despite their comfortable lead at the top of the table, Luis Enrique is sure motivation will not be an issue for his side in such a big game. ""More than what a goal means, the players are crazy to win the game. ""It doesn't matter what the difference in points is, these are two of the best teams in the world. ""There is nothing that appeals to Barca fans more than beating Madrid and the same goes for the players."" Barca's stellar campaign has been thanks in large part to the 107 goals scored by the star front three of Messi, Luis Suarez and Neymar. All three travelled across the Atlantic during a two-week international break since Barca were last in action to represent their countries in South American World Cup qualifiers. Yet, the coach shrugged off suggestions that tiredness could affect their performance come Saturday. ""These type of games generate energy in players. It doesn't worry me at all."""
962,01/04/2016,11:46,Suarez tells of battle to adapt to Messi game,Uruguayan star Luis Suarez believes his success in turning around Barcelona's fortunes in the past two seasons has been thanks to adapting his game to strike partners Lionel Messi and Neymar.,"Heading into Saturday's Clasico game against Real Madrid, Suarez is Barca's top scorer with 43 goals in as many games this season. The Catalan giants remain on course to repeat the La Liga, Champions League and Copa del Rey triumph they won in Suarez's debut campaign last season. ""La Liga is very different to the Premier League,"" said the former Liverpool star who moved to Spain in 2014 in an 82 million euro ($93 million, £65 million) deal on the back of Barca's first trophyless season for six years. ""Everyone knows that it's completely different and what you need to do is always be yourself, don't change, just adapt your movements and a few things FC Barcelona dictate, but the thing I cared about was being a good teammate,"" he added. ""I think this is something I achieved from the beginning and one can see all the things we've achieved so far,"" he declared at the launch of playful animations of Barcelona players, including himself, as part of an official partnership with the appliances company Beko. Barca lead Real Madrid by 10 points with just eight games remaining ahead of Saturday's clash, with a Champions League quarter-final against Atletico Madrid and Cup final versus Sevilla to come. Barca head into El Clasico on a 39-game unbeaten run stretching back to October. Turkish international Arda Turan has yet to taste defeat in a Barca jersey as he was only cleared to play in January after Barca had served a 12-month ban on registering new players. And Turan has no doubt that Barca will wrap up a sixth La Liga title in eight seasons in the coming weeks. ""We feel great. We believe we'll be the champions so we work harder every day; we fight more! I believe we'll be the champions. We are the best team."" The Clasico, the most watched game in world football, is Barca's first since legendary former player and coach Johan Cruyff passed away at the age of 68 after a short battle with cancer last week. A pre-match display involving over 90,000 fans will read ""thank you Johan"" with the same message carried on the Barca players' shirts."
963,01/04/2016,02:07,"Messi, Ronaldo and co battle to be La Liga's top dog",Saturday's meeting between Barcelona and Real Madrid pits the two most expensive strike forces in history against one another.,"Barca hold a big 10-point advantage over Madrid in the La Liga title race, but the battle to be the league's top scorer between Barca's Lionel Messi, Luis Suarez and Neymar and Madrid's Cristiano Ronaldo, Karim Benzema and Gareth Bale is a lot tighter. Here, AFP sports looks at the numbers behind the six men hoping to land Spain's Pichichi prize for La Liga's top marksmen. Cristiano Ronaldo (28 goals) Much criticised for not reaching his usual heights this season, Ronaldo is still La Liga's top scorer thanks in large part to having played every minute of the league season so far. Ronaldo hasn't scored against in four games against opponents in La Liga's top four, but has looked back close to his best in recent weeks with seven goals in his last five games and is tied with Raul as the third highest scorer in Clasico history with 15 against Barca. Luis Suarez (26 goals) Finally free from suspension and controversy to play a full season, Suarez has become Barca's top scorer this season with 43 in 43 games in all competitions, 26 of which in La Liga. Such is the ease with which Barca have been winning, suspicions in Madrid have arisen that Messi's decision to pass a penalty into Suarez's path against Celta Vigo in February and allow him to take spot-kicks against Sporting Gijon and Rayo Vallecano were with the intention of aiding his challenge to Ronaldo to top the scoring charts. Yet, the penalty spot is the one place from which the Uruguayan hasn't been deadly as his efforts against Sporting and Rayo were both saved. Lionel Messi (22 goals) Despite missing two-months of the season due to knee ligament damage and playing a greater role as creator since Suarez's arrival last season, a surge of 24 goals since the turn of the year, 16 in La Liga, have Messi in the hunt for a fourth Pichichi. The five-time World Player of the Year is also tantalisingly close to another significant milestone as he needs just one more to reach 500 career goals after registering his 50th for Argentina as they saw off Bolivia in midweek. Neymar (21 goals) After a brief mid-season dip the Brazilian has come back into goalscoring form with four in three games before the recent international break. His best run came in Messi's absence earlier in the campaign with nine in six La Liga games in October and November, culminating in a sensational performance as Barca inflicted a humiliating 4-0 thrashing on Madrid. Karim Benzema (20 goals) The Frenchman has significantly the best minutes per goal ratio in La Liga with one every 78 minutes he's on the pitch. Staying there has been Benzema's trouble in a season disrupted by injury and off-field scandals, but he is already just one off his best ever tally in a Liga campaign. Gareth Bale (15 goals) Injuries have also ravaged Bale's season, but the Welshman's impressive strike rate of 15 in just 16 league starts also has him on course for his best goalscoring season since arriving in Spain three years ago. Bale has just one El Clasico goal to his name, but it was his most spectacular one in a Madrid shirt as he ran half the length of the field before slotting home to win the Copa del Rey final in 2014."
964,01/04/2016,02:05,"Barca honour Cruyff, Madrid seek redemption in Clasico",Barcelona will honour legendary former player and coach Johan Cruyff as they look to inflict more misery upon eternal rivals Real Madrid in the Clasico on Saturday.,"The most watched game in world football is Barca's first since Cruyff passed away at the age of 68 after a short battle with cancer last week. A pre-match display involving over 90,000 fans will read ""thank you Johan"" with the same message carried on the Barca players' shirts. ""In what is a special match, it is without doubt extra motivation for us to try and win the game,"" said Barca captain Andres Iniesta. Indeed, the emotion surrounding the occasion supersedes its importance in the title race in La Liga with Barca 10 points clear of third-placed Madrid with just eight games remaining. A 4-0 thrashing of Real when the sides last met in November put Barca well on course to retain the title. However, with Madrid now under new management since Zinedine Zidane replaced Rafael Benitez in January and with the front three of Cristiano Ronaldo, Gareth Bale and Karim Benzema fit and in scoring form, Iniesta expects a much tougher task on Saturday. ""These games are different, it doesn't matter how the teams are playing before because we all like to beat your biggest rivals,"" added the Spanish international. ""We expect a difficult, close game which will be decided by small details. We have all the respect in the world for the team we will face because they deserve it."" Bale in particular will be well-rested as he was given time off by Wales boss Chris Coleman during the two-week international break preceding the game. And he is confident that Madrid could drag themselves back into the title race if they can snap Barca's 39-game unbeaten run stretching back to October. ""They are playing very well at the moment so we have to take the game to them,"" said Bale. ""We have to attack them, we have to exploit their weaknesses, we have a game plan and if we perform to our maximum I'm very confident we can get the win. ""I believe anything is possible in football. We know we are 10 points behind but we will keep fighting until the league is impossible. ""At the moment it's very possible. If we win on Saturday we are seven points behind and you never know what happens."" Both coaches should be able to name their strongest starting line-ups with Barca only missing Jeremy Mathieu and Sandro Ramirez, while Madrid have a clean bill of health. However, tiredness could play an important factor with two of Barca's deadly front three, Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez, only having arrived back in the Catalan capital on Thursday after playing World Cup qualifiers for Argentina and Uruguay respectively in the past week. Five-time World Player of the Year Messi could also register his 500th career goal having taken his tally to 499 with his 50th goal for Argentina in a 2-0 win over Bolivia on Tuesday. ""It would be nice to score my 500th goal against Real Madrid in the Clasico, but it would be even nicer to win the game,"" said Messi. Atletico Madrid can close to within six points of Barcelona at the top before kick-off at the Camp Nou as they host Real Betis earlier on Saturday. However, Atletico coach Diego Simeone could keep a number of players in reserve as they travel to face Barca in the first leg of their Champions League quarter-final on Tuesday. Meanwhile, Valencia visit Las Palmas hoping to distance themselves from the relegation zone with Pako Ayestaran in charge for the first time following Gary Neville's sacking on Wednesday.

965,31/03/2016,14:53,El Clasico fitting scene for Cruyff's Barca send-off,The self-styled biggest game in world football takes on a different significance on Saturday as Barcelona pay homage to legendary former player and coach Johan Cruyff for the visit of Real Madrid in El Clasico.,"Over 90,000 fans will take part in a pre-match display reading ""thank you Johan"" ahead of Barca's first match since the Dutch great passed away at the age of 68 last week after a short battle with lung cancer. Barca host Madrid 10 points clear of their eternal rivals in the La Liga title race and on the verge of a sixth league title in eight years. Moreover, they are favourites to become the first side ever to retain the Champions League -- a feat that would deliver a fifth European Cup in 11 years. Barca's little more than a decade of dominance has been propelled by the brilliance of Lionel Messi, Andres Iniesta and Xavi Hernandez on the pitch and astute coaching of Frank Rijkaard, Pep Guardiola and Luis Enrique from the touchline. Yet, they are all united by a style and philosophy implemented by Cruyff over 20 years ago that continues to serve Barca today. ""To talk about Cruyff is to talk about football at its best,"" said Enrique, as the Barca squad joined over 60,000 fans in paying their respects at a memorial set up for Cruyff at the Camp Nou this week. ""He leaves behind a very important legacy, a legacy that this club will perpetuate. ""We want to copy and improve this style of play which combines results and a spectacular attacking football."" Rarely has any side displayed such spectacular attacking football as the Barca 2015/16 version. Madrid's visit offers the chance to stretch an unbeaten run in all competitions to 40 games with Messi and strike partners Luis Suarez and Neymar already having scored a combined 107 times this season. Yet, Barca weren't always a hugely succesful behemoth supported by millions of fans around the world. When Cruyff arrived as a player from Ajax in 1973, Barca hadn't won the league in 13 years. On his return to the Catalan capital as a coach he won four consecutive Liga titles and delivered the club's first European Cup in 1992. He was Barca's most successful ever coach with 11 trophies before being overtaken by his former captain and pupil Guardiola's 14 in four glorious years in charge between 2008 and 2012. ""I didn't know anything about football until I knew him,"" Guardiola told Catalan radio station RAC1. ""He opened our eyes to how to be different, that is why we are his followers. It was a priviledge to be able to enjoy him as a coach, above all for the knowledge he gave us."" Cruyff's ideals placed an emphasis on technique over physical power in the same way he had to win three Ballon d'Ors as the world's best player during the 1970s. ""Messi is the one that runs the least and in that he is the best pupil of Cruyff,"" added Guardiola. A popular call has risen amongst Barca fans for the club to rename the Camp Nou in Cruyff's honour. Yet, perhaps the best homage came from this Barca side on the field when Messi passed a penalty into the path of Suarez to slot home in a 6-1 rout of Celta Vigo in February. The move was reminiscent of one of the Cruyff's most famous moves as he and Jesper Olsen played a one-two for Cruyff to score when playing for Ajax against Helmond Sport in 1982. ""It makes you happy for people to remember you after so many years. It's lovely -- the things football gives you,"" Cruyff said afterwards. Yet, as Madrid travel to the Camp Nou trailing in Barca's wake, it is what he gave the Catalan giants that will prove his lasting legacy."
966,31/03/2016,13:21,Barca's Mathieu to miss 6-8 weeks,Barcelona defender Jeremy Mathieu looks set to miss the rest of the La Liga season after the European champions confirmed the French international will miss six to eight weeks after undergoing knee surgery on Thursday.,"""Jeremy Mathieu has been satisfactorily operated on this Thursday,"" Barca said in a statement. ""The player will be out for approximately six to eight weeks."" However, Mathieu tweeted that he is hopeful of being fit within four weeks. ""Thank you all for your messages and your support! See you in 4 weeks!!"" He posted on his offical Twitter account. Mathieu's hopes of representing his country at this summer's European championships are also at risk after injuring a torn meniscus in his right knee during France's 4-2 friendly win over Russia on Tuesday. He has an outside chance of being fit for Barca's Copa del Rey final against Sevilla on May 22 and the Champions League final six days later should they progress that far. The 32-year-old has struggled to establish himself as a regular in coach Luis Enrique's starting line-up this season, but has still made 31 appearances in all competitions."

""The player will have an operation on Thursday by doctors Ramon Cugat and Ricard Pruna. Subsequently, the club will release a statement explaining the results of the operation."" The 32-year-old came on as a half-time substitute to win his fifth cap in France's 4-2 win against Russia at the Stade de France but hobbled off only eight minutes later. He will miss Saturday's Clasico at home to Real Madrid and faces an anxious wait to discover whether he will play again this season, with the injury jeopardising his prospects of featuring for France at Euro 2016 in June and July."

""The best homage is what he gave us all, especially Barca fans, but to the whole world of football,"" Iniesta said on Wednesday. ""For our part, in what is a special match, it is without doubt extra motivation for us to try and win the game."" More than 60,000 mourners paid their respects to Cruyff at a memorial set up at Barca's Camp Nou stadium between Saturday and Tuesday. As well as winning one league title and a Copa del Rey as a player, Cruyff revolutionised the Catalan giants in an eight-year spell as coach which delivered four La Liga titles and the club's first European Cup. Moreover, his commitment to implementing an attacking style of play based on technical ability in Barca's youth academy is credited with the emergence of players like five-time World Player of the Year Lionel Messi and Iniesta long after Cruyff had left the club. ""We are talking about a personal homage,"" Iniesta added. ""There are still some teammates to return (from international duty), but there will be something personal."""

Mathieu, who lasted just eight minutes on his fifth appearance for France after replacing Patrice Evra at half-time, must now wait to see how long he faces on the sidelines but he is set for a race against time to be fit for Barcelona's clash with bitter rivals Real Madrid at the Camp Nou on Saturday."

He chose to live his final days in privacy and his funeral was on Friday with just a few family and friends invited, his son Jordi Cruyff, dressed in mourning black, said. ""We understood that Johan is not only ours, he belongs to the whole world,"" he said. ""As a family we are incredibly proud of how people have reacted and we are very touched and impressed,"" he added. ""Barca, Ajax and the Dutch national team were his footballing loves and so it's great that these three entities have shown such respect and support."" Barcelona said that since Saturday more than 50,000 mourners had filed past the spot where a banner hangs saying ""Thanks Johan"" to pay their respects to the club's legendary former player and coach. Tuesday is the last day that the stadium is open for fans to pay their respects. It was also the first day that members of the Cruyff family were present. Cruyff, who first moved to Barcelona from Ajax Amsterdam in 1973, is often listed among the greatest players ever, alongside Pele, Alfredo di Stefano, Diego Maradona and Lionel Messi. Earlier on Tuesday Barcelona coach Luis Enrique praised the club's former player and manager Johan Cruyff as having embodied ""spectacular football and results"", as he visited a memorial in honour of the Dutchman at Camp Nou on Tuesday. ""To talk about Cruyff is to talk about football at its best,"" said Enrique, who was accompanied by two of Barcelona's star players Sergio Busquets and captain Andres Iniesta. Barcelona's first team visited the memorial after training on Tuesday morning, during which the players observed a minute's silence in honour of Cruyff. ""(Cruyff) leaves behind a very important legacy, a legacy that his club will perpetuate, we want to copy and improve this style of play which combines results and a spectacular attacking football,"" said Enrique. When Cruyff arrived at Barcelona the team were second bottom in the league. But they won 17 games in a row to win their first La Liga title in 14 years. The relationship between player, club and fans became even stronger after he took over as head coach in 1988. In an eight-year spell in charge he won four consecutive league titles, and Barcelona's first European Cup in 1992. Spain's Ministry of Education, Culture and Sport on Tuesday posthumously awarded Cruyff its Gold Medal of the Royal Order of Sports Merit, one of Spain's top sports honours,. The ministry said a ceremony will be held at a yet-to-determine date to official give the award to Cruyff's family. Barcelona said a minute of silence would be observed in honour of the player, and a video tribute to his career will be shown, on Saturday at the Camp Nou before the club's league match against arch rivals Real Madrid. The club's players will wear jerseys with the message ""Thanks Johan"" while the roughly 90,000 fans in the stands will hold up cards to spell out the same message."

Standing in front of a giant photo of a smiling Cruyff, Bartomeu said that it was a sad day not only for everyone who loved Barcelona football club, but also for everyone who loved football. ""In agreement with the Cruyff family we set up this memorial to allow everyone to express their feelings and say a final farewell to this legend,"" he said. Hundreds of people of different nationalities, many in tears, filed past the memorial, which was bedecked with flags and bouquets of red roses, and signed a condolences book. Johan Cruyff ""came to Barcelona when Barcelona was winning nothing,"" said one of them, Ignace Mosengo, a 45-year-old from the Congo who was on holiday in Barcelona with his wife. ""He gave them a new style of game, with intricate passing, to keep possession of the ball. What we admire in the current Barcelona team all harks back to him,"" he said. The memorial will remain in place until Tuesday evening with Barcelona football club observing a period of mourning until April 2. By the end of the day, the club said that more than 10,000 people had visited with the Cruyff family expected on Tuesday. Fans as well as tourists had already placed tributes at the entrance to the Camp Nou stadium on Friday, including roses and lollipops. Cruyff often patrolled the touchline sucking on a lollipop which became his prop after he stopped smoking cigarettes. Some 5,000 Dutch supporters have so far signed a condolence register set up at the Amsterdam ArenA on Saturday, Dutch newscaster NOS reported. The condolences were led by former Dutch international and Manchester United goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar, now a director at Ajax and also signed by other former Ajax players. The register will remain open until Tuesday, the NOS added. On Friday night, the Netherlands' international against France in Amsterdam was halted in the 14th minute as a mark of respect. A huge portrait banner showing Cruyff and his familiar Dutch orange number 14 shirt was hauled across one end of the ArenA stadium in his home city as fans and players applauded. A seat covered with flowers and a number 14 shirt was left empty in the VIP stand at a game which saw the Dutch slip to a 3-2 defeat against the hosts of the Euro 2016 tournament this summer. It was the first time that an international has been halted for such a gesture. ""It was special,"" said France coach Didier Deschamps. ""A great man like Johan Cruyff deserved such a tribute and the stadium responded to him."" A one-time heavy smoker who gave up after double heart by-pass surgery in 1991, Cruyff revealed in October last year that he had lung cancer. The Cruyff family said it was arranging ""a private farewell to Johan."" But they did not say when it would be held. The family also said it would soon announce a public memorial for the player who won three European Cups as a player with Ajax and European player of the year titles in 1971 with Ajax and 1973 and 1974 with Barcelona. Cruyff, who is considered to be one of the greatest players of all time, moved from Ajax to Barcelona in 1973 and stayed there until 1978. He returned 10 years later to coach the Spanish side. They won four consecutive league titles and their first ever European Cup in 1992 at Wembley. Cruyff helped end an era of dour defensive football, inspiring the Dutch team in their Total Football offensive that took them to the 1974 World Cup final where they were narrowly beaten by Germany."

973,20/03/2016,18:07,Barca extend advantage despite blowing two-goal lead,Barcelona extended their lead at the top of La Liga to nine points despite blowing a two-goal advantage to draw 2-2 at Villarreal on Sunday.,"Ivan Rakitic and a controversial Neymar penalty had Barca on course for a 13th consecutive La Liga win before half-time. Yet, Villarreal were more than worthy of a point and got their reward after the break through Cedric Bakambu and Jeremy Mathieu's own goal. Real Madrid can move to within 10 points of Barca ahead of the meeting between the two sides in two weeks when they host Sevilla later on Sunday. However, Sevilla also have the chance to close the gap on Villarreal to just three points in the fight for the fourth Champions League place. The sides held a minute's silence before kick-off in memory of 13 people killed in a bus crash carrying foreign exchange students in Spain earlier on Sunday. However, the sombre mood didn't affect Villarreal's start as they hit the woodwork inside the first minute when a Manu Trigueros effort was turned towards his own goal by Arda Turan. Claudio Bravo then blocked Bakambu's effort from a narrow angle as Barca struggled to contain Villarreal's pace on the break. Yet the visitors still struck first with some fortune as Lionel Messi's free-kick ricocheted off Luis Suarez and fell perfectly into the path of Rakitic to rifle home. The hosts were then furious when Gerard Pique was pardoned a second yellow card for clearly stopping a Villarreal attack by handling the ball on the ground after just 23 minutes. Villarreal boss Marcelino was expelled from the touchline for taking his protests too far. And worse was to come for the hosts when referee Jose Maria Sanchez Martinez pointed to the spot despite Sergio Asenjo clearly playing the ball as Neymar tried to round the goalkeeper. Neymar put Barca's recent troubles from the spot behind him to dink home the penalty for his 27th goal of the season. Pique was replaced by Mathieu early in the second period as Barca boss Luis Enrique looked to ensure his best defender was not suspended for the game against Madrid just after the international break. But that proved to be the turning point as Mathieu was constantly caught out. Bakambu halved the deficit with a simple finish after Bravo had parried Denis Suarez's initial effort. Mathieu then gifted Bakambu the ball straight from kick-off, but the Congolese forward tried to tee up Roberto Soldado instead of going for goal himself and Javier Mascherano intercepted. Soldado then missed a huge chance to level as he haded wide when unmarked from point-blank range. Asenjo also made a crucial contribution to Villarreal's comeback with a stunning save to stop Neymar making it 3-1. Moments later, Villarreal were level when the hapless Mathieu turned a corner into his own net. Barca regained their composure in the final quarter to ensure their unbeaten run in all competitions stretches to 39. Asenjo, who only returned from an 11-month injury layoff against Bayer Leverkusen on Thursday, got down well to his left to turn behind Rakitic's header. And the Croatian failed to make a good connection when Asenjo's unconvincing punch landed at his feet seven minutes from time."
974,18/03/2016,13:05,Barca out to avenge Atletico in Champions League quarters,Holders Barcelona and their feared attacking trident drew fellow Spaniards and 2014 finalists Atletico Madrid in the Champions League last eight on Friday.,"Lionel Messi, Luis Suarez and Neymar, Barcelona's feared attacking trio, will seek revenge for their 2-1 aggregate quarter-finals exit at the hands of Diego Simeone's formidable charges two seasons ago. ""With Atletico Madrid everything is complicated,"" said Barcelona representative Javier Bordas, who was in Nyon for the draw. ""Their strengths are well known. They are water-tight at the back and can hurt you in attack,"" he said of the side who have shipped just three goals in the competition so far. ""They are our number one rival in the Spanish league, I don't believe there was a tougher side we could have drawn. We know this is going to be really tough."" Atletico eliminated Barca 2-1 on aggregate in the quarter-finals on their way to the 2014 Champions League final. That season Atletico went unbeaten in six games against Barca, but since then the Catalans have won all six meetings between the sides. But while Atletico coach Diego Simeone was unflinching he heaped praise on his rivals, and if he was worried he was not showing it. ""I have said before, they work more on set-pieces, they have more counter-attacks, Neymar has been there longer, the presence of Suarez, they are a different team with more options,"" he said. ""Barcelona are the best in the world for sure and what can be better for us than playing against the best in the world? It makes me very excited."" In another tantalising pair up new money outfits Manchester City and Paris Saint-Germain face off after Swedish giant Zlatan Ibrahimovic's side toppled Chelsea in the last round. It is a first ever quarter-finals for City. PSG president Nasser Al-Khelaïfi was confident his side, fresh from wrapping up a fourth straight French Ligue 1 title in record time, can get to their first Champions League semi-final in twenty years. ""In the quarter-finals there are only good teams left. We have enormous respect for Manchester City, But I believe our players will produce another big European performance. I'm convinced we can keep up the pace that saw us overcome Chelsea and offer our supporters a first semi-final since 1995,"" he said. Having overcome Juventus in a dramatic come back in midweek five-time European champions Bayern Munich will have been relieved to have drawn Portugal's Benfica. Bayern winger Franck Ribéry warned there was no room for complacency even if the Germans, led by Pep Guardiola in his last season before a switch to Manchester City, are unlikely to lose any sleep over the pair up. ""We will have to remain very focussed, it's the quarter-finals, you don't take these matches lightly. After the group games you never have an easy match,"" said the Frenchman. ""We need a good result in the first game at home. But it's a great draw for us,"" he said. Zinedine Zidane's ten-time winners Real Madrid and the Champions League's runaway top scorer Cristiano Ronaldo (13 goals), drew Germans Wolfsburg, with the added comfort of playing at home in the second leg against the quarter-final débutants. Emilio Butragueno the Real Madrid director of institutional relations, warned against complacency however. ""They are a German team, they are in the quarter-finals for the first time and they motivation in playing us will be huge. ""We know what it means in Europe to commit a single error and we hope to be back here for the semi-finals. There was conversely a sense of glee at Wolfsburg, whose directors beamed with delight as the draw was made. ""We can't wait"" said Wolfsburg coach Dieter Hecking. ""For Wolfsburg, the fans and the club it's a wonderful draw. Real Madrid are a massive side but you've always got a chance."" The two legs of the quarter-finals will be played between April 5-13, with the semi-finals on April 26/27 and May 3/4. The final will take place in Milan on May 28."

""I don't think Barcelona depend on the three up front,"" Messi said on Thursday. ""There is a big squad and there is much more than three players. ""We try to help offensively and defensively, but I don't think the team depends on us.""

977,17/03/2016,16:11,Europe's big guns ready for quarter-final draw,The draw for the Champions League quarter-finals in Switzerland on Friday promises to throw up plenty of tantalising ties in the first stage of the competition where any two teams can face each other.,"Restrictions on clubs from the same country facing off are lifted for the last eight, bringing the chance of either an all-German or all-Spanish clash. Defending champions Barcelona are firm favourites for the title after a comfortable 5-1 aggregate victory over Arsenal in the last 16, although no side has ever retained the European crown since it moved to its current guise of the Champions League. That suggests a title defence is harder than it may seem, and the likes of Bayern Munich, Real Madrid and Paris Saint-Germain are all expected to challenge Luis Enrique's men for the trophy to be played for in Milan on May 28. The most thrilling climax to a last 16 second leg was saved until last, as five-time champions Bayern produced a thrilling fight-back on Wednesday to knock out last season's runners-up Juventus in extra-time. Bayern legend and CEO Karl-Heinz Rummenigge on Thursday proclaimed his disappointment that two sides of the stature of the German and Italian champions could meet so early in the tournament. ""What I do not like at all is that it is all dependent on the draw,"" he said. ""UEFA should consider whether or not it should bring in seeding or something like that. It's no longer acceptable, I'm tired of fate."" With murmurs of the traditionally bigger clubs breaking away to form a European Super League, Rummenigge's ideas may be supported by some of the sides in the last eight hat. But the likes of Wolfsburg and Benfica, who could still potentially go head-to-head in the quarters, are unlikely to want any such seeding process. Wolfsburg reached this stage in Europe's premier competition for the first time by seeing off Belgian surprise packages Gent, who battled hard but to no avail in a 4-2 aggregate loss. Benfica, although they are two-time winners, have not won any continental trophy since their second European Cup back in 1962. Despite Rummenigge's views, Bayern head coach Pep Guardiola has said that he does ""not care"" who the Bavarians are drawn against in the next round. The Spaniard, who led Barcelona to two Champions League titles during his time in charge at the Camp Nou, will join Manchester City at the end of the season and could even be pitted against his future employers -- who eased past Dynamo Kiev to progress further than ever before. ""I don't care who we play next. If you want to reach the semi-finals then you have to be ready to beat any opponent,"" said Guardiola, for whom Thomas Mueller's 90th-minute equaliser protected a record of having never failed to reach the last eight as a coach. While many eyes will be on the possibility of an El Clasico showdown, Atletico Madrid's dramatic penalty shoot-out victory over PSV Eindhoven means that Spain have the most quarter-final representatives for the fifth successive season. The last country to provide more than two sides at this stage was England in 2011, but Premier League outfits have struggled in recent years. English champions Chelsea fell to their French counterparts PSG for the second season in a row, this time losing both matches 2-1. The draw takes place at UEFA headquarters in Nyon at 1100GMT."
978,16/03/2016,22:50,Barca outgun Arsenal to reach quarter-finals,"Neymar, Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez were all on target as Barcelona piled more pressure on under-fire Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger by easing into the Champions League quarter-finals 5-1 on aggregate with a 3-1 win at the Camp Nou on Wednesday.","Neymar's early strike appeared to erase any forlorn hopes of an Arsenal comeback, but the visitors were given hope when Mohamed Elneny drilled into the top corner just after half-time. Suarez put the tie beyond Wenger's men in emphatic fashion with a stunning volley 25 minutes from time before Messi's cheeky chipped finish rounded off the scoring late on. A ninth consecutive victory stretches Barca's unbeaten run in all competitions to 38 games and seals their place in Friday's quarter-final draw for the ninth consecutive season. One win in eight games has decimated Arsenal's hopes of silverware this season as they exit the competition at the last 16 stage for the sixth consecutive season days after relinquishing their two-year hold on the FA Cup. Yet, they made a bright start with Mesut Ozil curling just wide of the target. Barca's front three soon came to life, though, and David Ospina made a brilliant save from Messi after the Argentine had perfectly controlled Neymar's floated pass over the Arsenal defence. Jeremy Mathieu headed over a gilt-edged chance from the resulting corner. Neymar wasn't so forgiving moments later when he was played in by Suarez and coolly slotted past Ospina for his 26th goal of the season. The Brazilian then fired too close to Ospina with another fine chance after being teed up by Messi. Yet, Arsenal should have been at least level by the break as Barca struggled to handle the visitors pace on the break without the suspended Gerard Pique. Alexis Sanchez missed a glorious chance to net on his return to the Camp Nou when he glanced a header wide from Hector Bellerin's cross. Danny Welbeck then sliced well wide when clean through on goal, whilst Alex Iwobi appealed in vein for a penalty after clipping his own ankles inside the box. Arsenal's pressure was finally rewarded six minutes into the second-half when Elneny rifled his first goal for the club into the top corner from Sanchez's layoff. Conceding a goal sparked Barca back into life as Ospina got down well to his left to parry Messi's low drive. Welbeck had another chance to put Arsenal right back in the tie when he pounced on a poor header from Mathieu, but saw his shot blocked by Javier Mascherano's brilliant last-ditch tackle. Barca's nerves were settled in spectacular fashion by Suarez as the Uruguayan contorted his body to acrobatically volley home Dani Alves's cross. Arsenal continued to create chances as Welbeck drilled a shot against the bar from a narrow angle. Ter Stegen then produced a brilliant double save to turn away Sanchez's free-kick and Olivier Giroud's follow-up effort. However, Messi again demonstrated the difference in quality between the sides in front of goal when he dinked home two minutes from time to take he, Neymar and Suarez's combined tally for the season to 106."

""This is a unique team, different to the rest and which does things that make it seem like there is nothing the opponent can do,"" said Enrique. ""It is a great pleasure to be in this position."" Five-time World Player of the Year Lionel Messi produced another masterclass, despite missing a penalty for the third time this season, as he scored his 36th goal of the season and provided three assists. Juan Rodriguez's own goal opened the scoring before Barca missed from the spot for the ninth time in 20 penalties this season when Vicente Guaita parried Messi's effort. Messi quickly set about making amends as his teed up Munir El Haddadi and Neymar before smashing home a fourth before half-time. And Neymar and Arda Turan rounded off a 12th consecutive La Liga win after the break. ""The ideas and the tempo with which we started made it very difficult for Getafe because we were so precise and quick when we moved the ball,"" added Enrique. ""At half-time the game was already sewn up and that isn't due to the fault of the opponents, but because at this part of the season we are in fantastic form and the whole team has a lot of confidence."" Enrique even had the luxury of leaving out top goalscorer Luis Suarez, Ivan Rakitic and Sergio Busquets ahead of Arsenal's visit on Wednesday. ""They are all incredible. The forwards, the midfielders, the defenders, those that don't play or have fewer minutes. ""It is a perfect situation to know that whoever you pick will compete in their own way, with their own characteristics, but all of them wanting to take part and make the most of their minutes on the field. ""The only problem we have is that there aren't enough minutes for everyone. ""If you enjoy playing football and it is clear that this team enjoys it, then it is easier to not get tired of playing football and that is one of the keys of this team."" Barca are on the brink of a sixth La Liga title in eight years as victory took them 11 points clear of second-placed Atletico Madrid, albeit having played a game more. And defender Gerard Pique put their sustained success down to the stability in the squad over the past number of years. ""Many players have spent many years here together and we understand each other very well,"" said the Spanish international. ""We can play quickly and at times without even looking at one another. ""We can still improve and for the rest of the season we need to continue winning titles."""

Neymar and Arda Turan rounded off the scoring to seal Barca's 12th straight La Liga win after the break. A 37th consecutive game without defeat opens up an 11-point lead on second-placed Atletico, who host Deportivo la Coruna later on Saturday. Real Madrid are now 15 points adrift of Barca in third ahead of their trip to Las Palmas on Sunday. An eighth defeat in nine games leaves Getafe just a point above the relegation zone. The European champions weren't even at full strength as coach Luis Enrique left Luis Suarez on the bench ahead of Barca's return to Champions League action against Arsenal on Wednesday. Yet, the hosts still only took seven minutes to break the deadlock as Jordi Alba's driven cross towards Messi was scooped into the far corner of his own net by Rodriguez. Barca's one fallibility this season was exposed moments later when Neymar was chopped down by Emiliano Velzquez inside the area. Messi took responsiblity, but for the ninth time in 20 spot-kicks Barca failed to convert as Guaita dived to his left to turn the five-time World Player of the Year's effort to safety. Guaita's intervention kept Getafe in the game for just a further nine minutes as Messi directed Andres Iniesta's through ball onto El Haddadi's head for the second. Gerard Pique then hit the bar as Getafe failed to contain the waves of Barca attack. Neymar's display had been under scrutiny after he took advantage of being suspended for last weekend's 4-0 win at Eibar to fly back to Brazil to celebrate his sister's birthday. Yet, the break seemed to do the 24-year-old good as he raced onto a brilliant Messi pass to slot home his first goal in four games. Messi then took out his frustration at not netting from the spot to rifle home the fourth from outside the box five minutes before half-time. The pattern continued after the break with Messi in generous mood with another clinical through ball for Neymar to sweep home his 25th goal of the season. And Turan added a sixth just before the hour mark with an acrobatic overhead kick which left Guaita flatfooted. Iniesta was rested for the final half hour ahead of Arsenal's trip to the Camp Nou, despite Barca holding a commanding 2-0 first-leg lead. Yet, Suarez didn't get the chance to further his case in the battle with Cristiano Ronaldo to be La Liga's top scorer as he remained on the bench for the full 90 minutes."

Brazilian investment group DIS owned 40 percent of Neymar's sporting rights before his move to the Catalan giants from Santos in 2013. Neymar, his father, Bartomeu and Rosell had all been called to testify by Spain's highest court over a complaint for fraud and corruption brought by DIS. The deal was originally valued at 57.1 million euros ($62.1 million) by Barca, 40 million of which was paid to the N&amp;N company owned by the player's father, with Santos receiving just 17.1 million. However, Spanish judicial authorities have estimated the number of simultaneous deals in the transfer amounted to at least 83.3 million.

984,06/03/2016,17:54,Messi double keeps Barca record rolling,A Lionel Messi-inspired Barcelona tightened their grip on the La Liga title race with a comprehensive 4-0 win at Eibar on Sunday to open up an 11-point lead at the top.,"Munir El Haddadi tapped home the opener from Luis Suarez's cross before Messi doubled Barca's advantage with a brilliant individual effort just before half-time. Messi doubled his tally from the penalty spot before Suarez lashed home the fourth six minutes from time. Barca's 11th consecutive league win also stretches their record unbeaten run to 36 games. Atletico Madrid can close the gap at the top to eight points when they visit Gary Neville's Valencia later on Sunday. Real Madrid remain 12 points adrift of Barca in third despite Cristiano Ronaldo's four-goal show in a 7-1 demolition of Celta Vigo on Saturday. ""It is evident we are well-positioned in the league, but there are plenty of points to play for and meetings with direct rivals to come,"" said Barca boss Luis Enrique. ""I am very happy to see the team evolve and improve without ever losing their ambition."" The European champions were without the suspended Neymar, who made the most of his free weekend to return to his native Brazil. However, El Haddadi made the most of his rare chance to start with a simple finish at the back post eight minutes in after Messi's brilliant pass had played in Suarez behind the Eibar defence. Suarez was surpassed by Ronaldo in the fight to be La Liga's top scorer and the Uruguayan look determined to hit back early on, but fluffed his lines with just Abel Riesgo to beat two minutes later. El Haddadi should have teed up Suarez for a tap-in from another Messi through ball midway through the half, but the youngster overhit his pass and the ball slipped just wide. Eibar then enjoyed a concerted period of pressure and were desperately unlucky not to level when Borja Baston's cross hit Sergio Busquets and flew inches past the far post. Yet, just when Eibar looked the most likely to score, Messi killed the game as a contest as he intercepted the ball in midfield and drove towards the Eibar goal before firing into the far corner for his 20th league goal of the season. The second half was far shorter on goalmouth action, but there was time for Messi to put Barca's recent troubles from the penalty spot behind him when Ivan Ramis blocked the Argentine's cross with his hand. Messi took responsibility after Suarez had missed from the spot against Rayo Vallecano in midweek and coolly dispatched the penalty for his 35th goal of the season. And Suarez finally got the goal he craved to move back to within one of Ronaldo in the scoring charts with a brilliant nutmeg of Capa before smashing the ball into the far corner. That goal also took Suarez, Messi and Neymar's combined tally for the season to 100."
985,03/03/2016,23:51,Luis Enrique relishing 'beautiful' treble chase,"Barcelona boss Luis Enrique said he is looking forward to the most ""beautiful"" part of the season as his side close in on another league, Cup and Champions League treble.","Lionel Messi scored a hat-trick as Barca set a Spanish football record of 35 consecutive games unbeaten in all competitions with a 5-1 win at Rayo Vallecano on Thursday. Barca are well set for a sixth La Liga title in eight years as they lead Atletico Madrid by eight points and Real Madrid by 12 with just 11 games to go. The Catalans will also face Sevilla in the Copa del Rey final and hold a 2-0 first-leg lead over Arsenal in the last-16 of the Champions League. ""We are approaching the final third of the season and the most beautiful part is still to come,"" said Luis Enrique. ""We have to wait and see what we can achieve, but whatever we do it will be deserved."" Despite their remarkable unbeaten run, the European champions haven't always been at their best in recent weeks. However, they looked back on top form at Vallecas despite their cause being eased as Rayo were reduced to nine-men. ""You always know the difficulties that a team like Rayo can present, but we overcame those in the best way with the attitude, intensity and ruthlessness we showed,"" continued Enrique. ""We played very well and when we are at this level in terms of attitude and intensity, it is very hard for the opponents."" The only negative on the night for the Catalans was another missed penalty as Luis Suarez failed to build on his two-goal lead over Cristiano Ronaldo in the fight to be La Liga's top scorer when his spot-kick was brilliantly saved by Juan Carlos in the second-half. Barca have now missed six of their 13 penalties in the league this season with the star front trio of Messi, Suarez and Neymar all missing twice. ""It is a facet we have to improve on, but it doesn't overly concern me if we have the game wrapped up beforehand,"" Enrique added."
986,01/03/2016,20:58,Suarez sale gives Liverpool £60m profit,"Liverpool made a pre-tax profit of £60 million ($83.8 million, 77.1 million euros) in 2014-15, the club announced on Tuesday, thanks largely to the sale of Luis Suarez to Barcelona.","Uruguay striker Suarez left Liverpool for the Camp Nou in a reported £75 million deal in July 2014, with then-manager Brendan Rodgers reinvesting the money in eight new signings and contracts for several players. Liverpool's profit for the previous financial year had been just £900,000. ""We continue to make solid financial progress and reported growth in our commercial, media and match-day revenues, which continues to add strength to our financial position,"" said chief executive Ian Ayre in a statement. ""Last year we saw a small profit for the first time in seven years, which demonstrated our recent progress. ""This year the profit reported has significantly increased, which is mainly a result of the sale of Luis Suarez in July 2014 and that has already been reinvested into the playing squad. ""Our real financial position is closer to break-even and it is the underlying revenue growth that's important and provides us with the long-term stability."" British press reports on Tuesday suggested that Jurgen Klopp, Rodgers's successor, will be given substantial funds to spend in the 2016 close-season transfer window. The announcement of 12 new partnerships and the opening of 180 new retail outlets around the world saw Liverpool's commercial revenue increase by 12 percent to £116.3 million in 2014-15. Media revenue rose from £100.9 million to £122.6 million, due in part to Champions League participation and runs to the FA Cup and League Cup semi-finals. Liverpool's success in cup competitions helped match-day revenue climb by 15.9 percent to £59 million. Meanwhile, the accounts show that American owners Fenway Sports Group (FSG) wrote off a £69 million loan by turning it into equity. FSG also invested £49 million in the expansion of Anfield's Main Stand, which is due to re-open in time for the start of next season. Liverpool are struggling to qualify for next season's Champions League via the league and were knocked out of the FA Cup by West Ham United last month. They reached the League Cup final, losing on penalties to Manchester City at Wembley on Sunday, and face Manchester United in the Europa League last 16."
987,01/03/2016,16:14,Unbeaten record in sight for unstoppable Barca,European champions Barcelona can set a new record for consecutive games unbeaten when they travel to lowly Rayo Vallecano on Thursday aiming to tighten their grip on the La Liga title.,"Barca stretched their unbeaten streak to 34 games dating back to October with a hard-fought 2-1 win over Sevilla on Sunday to lead Atletico Madrid by eight points at the top of La Liga with Real Madrid a further four points back in third. Indeed, the Catalan giants look well set to repeat their treble of league, Cup and Champions League from last season having also progressed to the Copa del Rey final and beaten Arsenal 2-0 away in the first-leg of their Champions League last-16 tie. However, coach Luis Enrique has insisted records will mean nothing without the titles and defender Jordi Alba said they are wary of not being complacent with just 12 league games to go. ""In the dressing room there is precaution and at any moment the opponent can cause us problems,"" said the Spanish international. ""Atletico Madrid continue to put the pressure on."" The suspended Dani Alves and long-term injury absentee Rafinha are the only players unavailable to Luis Enrique, but he is likely to rotate in defence and midfield once more to keep his side fresh for the final few months of the season. However, the star front three of Lionel Messi, Luis Suarez and Neymar are expected to start once more in attack. Rayo are unbeaten in seven league games, including five 2-2 draws, but remain just two points above the relegation zone. ""It is difficult to beat Barca because we are facing the best team in the world with the best players, said Rayo midfielder Roberto Trashorras. ""One day they will lose and we have to try to make sure that is on Thursday."" Atletico have the chance to close the gap to five points on Tuesday when they host Real Sociedad at the Vicente Calderon. ""We return to the Calderon with lots of enthusiasm and desire. The strength we gained from Saturday is enormous,"" said Atletico boss Diego Simeone. ""Many teams change their way of playing when they come to the Calderon. They will sit back and look for the speed of their strikers. That means we need to work doubly hard to find the way to open the game up."" Real Madrid are in action on Wednesday when they travel to bottom-placed Levante looking to put Zinedine Zidane's first defeat as coach behind them. The Frenchman's task wasn't aided by Cristiano Ronaldo's rant at his own teammates after the Atletico game, claiming Real ""would be top"" if they all matched the three-time World Player of the Year's standards. ""Cristiano has spoken with everyone. This subject is behind us,"" Zidane said on Tuesday. ""We are thinking only about tomorrow's game, doing the best we can and winning."" Real will be without influential midfielder Luka Modric due to a foot problem, whilst Gareth Bale won't be risked despite returning to training on Tuesday after six weeks out with a calf injury. Madrid could even fall to fourth should they fail to win and Villarreal continue their 13-game unbeaten streak with victory at Celta Vigo. Gary Neville is also targeting a return to winning ways when Valencia travel to Malaga looking to move into the top half of the table on Wednesday. Fixtures (all times GMT)"
988,28/02/2016,22:38,Barca equal unbeaten record in Sevilla win,Barcelona came from behind to equal a Spanish record of 34 games unbeaten in all competitions by moving eight points clear at the top of La Liga with a 2-1 win over Sevilla.,"Sevilla were the last side to beat Barca back in October and deservedly struck first through Vitolo. However, as so often of late, Barca recovered from a slow start thanks to Lionel Messi's brilliant free-kick and Gerard Pique's winner early in the second-half. Luis Enrique's men have now matched Real Madrid's record run from the 1988-89 season and in doing so moved 12 points clear of third-placed Madrid. Atletico Madrid remain Barca's closest challengers after beating Madrid 1-0 on Saturday. ""We are in great form, but records don't mean anything. At the end of the day everything is judged by titles,"" Pique told Movistar+. ""Our season is well on track, but we need to finish it off."" Sevilla were a constant threat on the counter-attack, but should have taken the lead from a set-piece when Timothee Kolodziejczak somehow blazed over from point-blank range. Barca nearly went in front in spectacular fashion as Messi's audacious attempt from a corner hit the post and Luis Suarez then blasted the rebound off the crossbar. Sevilla did eventually make the breakthrough 20 minutes in thanks to a fine breakaway as Benoit Tremoulinas's cross from the left was slotted home at the back post by Vitolo. However, as ever Messi came to the fore when Barca needed him most and the five-time World Player of the Year levelled with a stunning free-kick high into the far corner 11 minutes later. Sergio Rico prevented Messi turning the game around single-handedly before the break with a great save low to his left. Barca upped the pace after the break and were rewarded when brilliant link-up play between Messi and Suarez teed up Pique to tap home from close range. Sevilla still had the chance to take something from the game when Claudio Bravo flew from his line to block Kevin Gameiro as the Frenchman bore down on goal. Earlier, Valencia's four-game winning run came to a sudden halt as Gary Neville's men were beaten 3-0 by Athletic Bilbao in a dress rehearsal of their Europa League last-16 tie. The Basques moved up to seventh in La Liga with three goals in seven second-half minutes at Mestalla. However, Neville was furious at two strong Valencia penalty appeals that were waived away before the opener. ""I thought the referee was a joke,"" said the former Manchester United captain. ""I've not blamed refs in every game, but his management of the game was awful. Some of the things he did were incredible."" Sabin Merino headed the visitors in front before Iker Muniain then doubled the lead to register his first goal in 18 months. And Aritz Aduriz compounded a miserable afternoon for Neville by rising highest to head home Benat Extebarria's corner for his 27th goal of the season. Villarreal moved to within two points of Real Madrid by stretching their unbeaten league run to 13 games with a comfortable 3-0 win over Levante thanks to goals from Leo Baptistao, Samu Castillejo and Adrian Lopez. Marcelino's men should at least be assured a place in the Champions League qualifiers next season as they now lead Sevilla by 11 points in the fight for fourth place."
989,27/02/2016,15:06,Liga far from won for Barca - Luis Enrique,Barcelona boss Luis Enrique has stressed the European champions don't have their sixth La Liga title in eight years sewn up despite holding a commanding lead over Atletico Madrid and Real Madrid.,"Barca lead Atletico by eight points with Real a further point back in third with 13 games remaining. Moreover, Enrique's men have the chance to extend their advantage over at least one of their title rivals when they host Sevilla on Sunday as Real and Atletico clash in the Madrid derby on Saturday. ""It would be a huge error to think that because you have a slight advantage you are going to win the league,"" Enrique said on Saturday. ""As a football professional it is impossible to see yourself as champions before you are mathematically. ""The three teams at the top will drop points between now and the end of the season. What interests me is that the rest do more than us."" Barca are one match away from matching the all-time record for consecutive matches unbeaten by a Spanish team of 34 set by Real Madrid in the 1988-89 season. However, Sevilla were the last team to inflict defeat on Barca when the sides last met back in October. ""We'll approach this match like any other against an opponent that are high up in the table,"" added Enrique. ""Demanding is the word that springs to mind (when facing Sevilla.)"""
990,26/02/2016,02:15,Derby win a must for Ronaldo in Barca chase,Cristiano Ronaldo insists Real Madrid can still catch La Liga leaders Barcelona if they can overcome their hoodoo against local rivals Atletico Madrid on Saturday.,"Real trail Atletico by a point and are nine adrift of Barca with just 13 games remaining, but can move up to second place should they beat Diego Simeone's men for the first time in six league games. ""It is a game we need to win,"" Ronaldo told Madrid's website. ""It is an important game at home, in front of our fans and against a very strong team that defends well. ""We know that (winning) La Liga will be difficult, but we need to fight until the end. Football is box full of surprises and anything can happen."" Real are expected to once again be without Gareth Bale as the calf injury that was initially expected to keep the Welsh star out for three weeks in mid-January drags on. Karim Benzema is likely to return having missed the 1-1 draw at Malaga last weekend, whilst James Rodriguez could start after being left on the bench by Zinedine Zidane at La Rosaleda. Zidane's record at the Bernabeu since taking over has been impeccable with four wins and 20 goals from four games. However, Atletico's rock-solid defence will pose a much more difficult obstacle to break down. Simeone's men recorded their 24th clean sheet in 38 games this season in a 0-0 draw at PSV Eindhoven in the Champions League in midweek. However, goals at the other end of the field has been the major problem for Atletico with just one in their last three games. ""The goal will come. We need to keep going and, if we have to be patient, I'll be the first to wait,"" said Simeone. Stefan Savic misses out through injury, so Jose Maria Gimenez will come into the Atletico defence. Meanwhile, Fernando Torres is likely to earn a recall to the starting line-up unless Yannick Carrasco recovers in time from an ankle ligament injury. Barca can maintain their stranglehold on the title race when Sevilla visit the Camp Nou on Sunday. The Andalusians' charge for a top-four finish has been maintained by their brilliant home form as they still haven't won away in the league all season. That run seems highly unlikely to chance as Barca seek to extend a 33-game unbeaten run in all competitions. However, the last time the European champions tasted defeat it was to Sevilla in October. ""Stats are there to be broken,"" said Barca's top scorer Luis Suarez. ""We are dedicated to playing well and getting good results."" With three La Liga games to come in seven days, Barca boss Luis Enrique is likely to rotate with the likes of Arda Turan and Sergi Roberto in line to start. Similarly with Sevilla aiming to catch Villarreal, who they trail by eight points, in fourth, coach Unai Emery may prioritise more winnable clashes with Eibar and Getafe in the next week. However, Villarreal are strong favourites to stretch their commanding lead over the Europa League holders to 11 points when they host Levante on Sunday. Gary Neville's upturn in fortunes as Valencia boss continued with a 4-0 win over Rapid Vienna on Thursday to seal a remarkable 10-0 aggregate win and a fourth consecutive victory in all competitions. With fears of being dragged into a relegation battle eased, Valencia could even challenge for a Europa League place should they continue their momentum at home to Athletic Bilbao on Sunday.

991,25/02/2016,17:21,Barca extend partnership with UNICEF to 2020,"European champions Barcelona renewed a collaboration agreement with children's charity UNICEF on Thursday till 2020, which will see the Catalan giants donate two million euros ($2.2 million) a year to promote child education.","""Until now Barcelona donated 1.5 million euros a year in their collaboration with UNICEF. This increase of half a million euros reinforces Barca's commitment with children,"" the club said in a statement. The agreement between the club and UNICEF began in 2006 when Barca broke with their tradition of not wearing a logo on their shirt to display UNICEF's logo and name. Since then the UNICEF name has been shifted to the back of the Barca jersey to accomodate a multi-million euro sponsorship deal with Qatar Airways. However, Barca's contribution has still benefited over a million children in projects in Ghana, China, Brazil and South Africa, according to the club and UNICEF. ""We want to reach the children of the world and continue being the club that children admire and love, and continue to be a club for everyone that does more than just play football,"" said Barca president Josep Maria Bartomeu. ""You are an inspiration for all of us for how you do things on the field,"" said UNICEF executive director Anthony Lake. ""Less well-known, but more important is what Barca does off the field, including this fantastic agreement."" Despite winning five trophies last year thanks to the star forward trio of Lionel Messi, Neymar and Luis Suarez, Barca's off-field reputation has been hit by a series of scandals. The club, Bartomeu and former president Sandro Rosell face tax evasion charges for the murky deal which brought Neymar to the club in 2013. Messi also faces a tax fraud trial in May over 4.16 million euros related to image rights. And defender Javier Mascherano also accepted a one-year suspended prison sentence and fine last month over irregularities in his tax returns over image rights."
992,24/02/2016,10:36,Cech says Gunners 'still alive' after Barca loss,Arsenal goalkeeper Petr Cech said Wednesday his team still had a chance to reach the Champions League quarter-finals despite a 2-0 loss to reigning titleholders Barcelona.,"""We are still alive,"" the 33-year-old Czech Republic keeper said on his website following Tuesday's loss at the Emirates. ""It's not as if we conceded five goals,"" he added. Cech, who joined Arsenal from Chelsea before this season, offered a few good saves on Tuesday but failed to stop Lionel Messi who scored 71 minutes into the game before adding a second from the penalty spot on 83 minutes. ""The second goal trimmed our chances for the second leg. But nothing's lost yet,"" said Cech. ""If we play the same way and improve productivity, we still have a chance to turn the fight for the last eight into a drama."" The return leg tie is at the Camp Nou on March 16. Cech bemoaned the Gunners' failure to score, which he said made the biggest difference between both teams. ""If you play against one of the favourites to win the competition and you create chances, you have to convert at least one,"" said Cech. Messi beat Cech for the first time in their seven encounters, but Cech waved his record aside. ""I regret our loss, not being beaten by one of the best footballers in history,"" he said."
993,24/02/2016,01:45,Wenger slams naive Arsenal after Messi ruins Euro bid,Arsene Wenger accused Arsenal of naivety after they were pushed to the brink of another frustrating Champions League exit by Lionel Messi's brace in Barcelona's 2-0 win at the Emirates Stadium.,"Wenger was infuriated his players failed to heed his warning to keep it tight at all costs in the last 16, first leg on Tuesday as Messi punished the hosts' careless defending with a clinical 71st-minute opener. Messi then took advantage of a needless foul on him by Mathieu Flamini, stroking home the resulting penalty to leave Barca on the verge of reaching the quarter-finals for a ninth consecutive year. It was a familiar tale of woe for the Gunners manager, who only this week had spoken publicly of his desire not to repeat the first-leg gung-ho tactics that had played a major role in Arsenal's five successive last-16 failures. ""Of course I'm disappointed. We lost it in a way we knew we could not give them,"" Wenger said. ""We were extremely guilty. It's very difficult to take. If we had to keep a 0-0 I would have been happy with that. ""They are better than us, everybody knows that, but we could have won the game if we had kept our discipline. ""We were impatient in the build up and lost balls we usually don't do. ""Once again, like against Monaco last season, we lost the game in exactly the same way. (It was) naive and that is frustrating. We just gave it away."" Wenger's anger was compounded because, for much of the match, he could have no complaints as Arsenal frustrated the European champions with a composed performance that could have yielded a lead if not for poor finishing. ""Barcelona master all aspects of the game and they have the players to punish you. But I felt there was room to beat them tonight. That is the frustration,"" Wenger said. ""We had an unbelievable chance in the first half and the way we finished was a problem. ""Then we lost a bit of cautiousness to defend. When you leave a counter-attack that is when Barcelona is most dangerous."" Now Wenger is left to survey the wreckage of Arsenal's latest European flop and he conceded there was virtually no chance of a miraculous escape in the second leg in Spain on March 16. ""Barcelona is 95 percent through certainly, but we want to go there and fight,"" added Wenger, who was less than impressed with the way the visitors often made a meal of their response to tough tackles. ""Not one goes down without shouting,"" he moaned. ""I felt the referee was influenced but let's be honest, we didn't lose the game because of the referee."" Barcelona defender Gerard Pique will miss the second leg after a late booking which followed a touchline chat with boss Luis Enrique, prompting suggestions it was a deliberate move to get a ban out of the way before the last eight with the tie effectively over. But Luis Enrique denied that charge, saying: ""No, it wasn't deliberate. if you see the foul, obviously he has to do it."" The coach was much more comfortable discussing his majestic side's 33rd consecutive unbeaten match. ""We managed to deal with Arsenal's pressure really well. We are one of the best clubs in the world when it comes to dealing with a tight defence,"" he said. ""We have had a really high defensive level. Arsenal had players to do us a lot of harm, but we were up to the challenge of all the dangers they could present us."" Few would bet against Barca winning their sixth European Cup this season, but Luis Enrique refused to write off Arsenal yet. ""The score is really good but nothing is decided yet. We will have to play really well in front of our own crowd to go through,"" he said."
994,23/02/2016,22:51,Messi magic leaves Arsenal spellbound,"Lionel Messi left Arsenal spellbound as the Barcelona striker's clinical double sealed a 2-0 last 16, first leg victory that put the Champions League holders firmly on course for the quarter-finals on Tuesday.","Barca coach Luis Enrique joked this week that all he needed to do was shout 'Abracadabra' for Messi, Neymar and Luis Suarez to deliver the kind of magic display that would bewilder the Gunners. On this occasion, it was Messi who answered his coach's call with a second-half brace as the Spanish champions survived a stern examination from Arsene Wenger's side to escape the Emirates Stadium with a result likely to condemn the hosts to a sixth successive last-16 exit. The La Liga leaders, chasing a sixth European Cup triumph, are now unbeaten in 33 games in all competitions -- a blistering streak that includes 14 wins from their last 15 games. After being dazzled by Messi's magic wand, it will take an act of astonishing escapology for Arsenal to go through in the return leg at the Camp Nou on March 16. While some describe Barca as Arsenal's mirror image given both clubs' purist principles, the reflection hasn't been always been pleasant for Wenger, whose side had only one win in their seven previous meetings with the Spanish giants, including defeats in the 2006 final and the knockout stages in 2010 and 2011. Aware that Arsenal's refusal to curb their attacking instincts had left them fatally vulnerable in the Champions League knockout stages, Wenger set out to stifle Barca with a cautious game-plan. Nacho Monreal had clearly taken Wenger's words to heart and he earned an early booking for chopping down Ivan Rakitic. But there was more than just mindless muscle to Arsenal's approach. Aaron Ramsey sent Mesut Ozil clear down the left edge of the penalty area with an exquisite backheel and then raced onto the German's return pass for a powerful shot that was blocked by the visitors. Only a last-ditch block denied Hector Bellerin, with the rebound falling to Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, whose scuffed close-range shot was straight at Barca goalkeeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen. But with half-time looming, Barca, refusing to be hounded out of their stride, finally escaped Wenger's tactical straitjacket. An opening goal should have followed when Dani Alves met Sergio Busquets' pass with a volleyed cross that Suarez headed wide with only Petr Cech to beat. Completely anonymous in the first half, Neymar underlined Barca's renewed sense of purpose immediately after the interval with a surging run past Bellerin onto Andres Iniesta's astute pass. The Brazilian should really have scored, but Cech came to Arsenal's rescue as he raced off his line to save. Olivier Giroud rose above the Barca defence to meet Ozil's cross with a header that ter Stegen brilliantly clawed away. But Luis Enrique's men were irrepressible and Suarez drilled narrowly wide of both Neymar and the far post. Messi had never scored against Cech in six encounters with the Arsenal goalkeeper during his time at Chelsea. But the Argentine did have six goals in his four meetings with Arsenal and he extended his mastery over the Gunners in the 71st minute. In the blink of an eye, Neymar turned defence into attack as he seized on a clearance, flicked a pass to Suarez on the left and sprinted onto the return ball. For virtually the first time all night, Arsenal had left themselves exposed and Neymar slipped a pass to Messi, who was left all alone to plant an emphatic finish past Cech. Suarez should have doubled the visitors' lead soon after, but the former Liverpool striker hit the post when it seemed easier to score. It mattered little as Arsenal sealed their own fate in the 84th minute when substitute Mathieu Flamini, exposed by Per Mertesacker's sloppy clearance, conceded a penalty with a crude challenge on Messi, who picked himself up to slot home from the spot."
995,22/02/2016,20:41,Enrique ready to dazzle Arsenal with magic trio,Barcelona manager Luis Enrique has warned Arsenal they will be left spell-bound when he unleashes his bewitching forwards in the Champions League on Tuesday.,"Enrique's side head to the Emirates Stadium for the last 16 first leg on a 32-match unbeaten run in all competitions and with their front three of Lionel Messi, Luis Suarez and Neymar having scored 91 goals between them this season. Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger labelled Barcelona as ""not far from perfect"" this week, calling the three-pronged attack a collection of ""top, top class"" players. And Enrique, looking to lead the Champions League holders to a sixth European Cup crown, says he only has to say the magic words to get the best from his star names. ""I tell them 'abracadabra' and the magic sparks - that is all I do!"" Enrique told reporters on Monday. ""I always work really hard and I always had the chance to have plenty of good strikers in my squad, it is quite simple, quite easy. ""In some situations you don't even have to wish what you would like them to do, they already do it. We have to work hard so our midfielders can give them the ball. ""We all have the same targets and we know how difficult it is to achieve those targets. I'm delighted with those three and also with the squad. ""I have three great players, they are the chosen ones, they are eager to win and every two or three days they have new motivation. I see them training and I'm delighted to be their manager."""
996,22/02/2016,16:13,Wenger wants Arsenal to take out Euro frustrations on Barca,"Arsene Wenger has demanded Arsenal learn the lessons of their past Champions League meltdowns when they host holders Barcelona in the last 16, first leg on Tuesday.","Wenger's side have been eliminated from Europe's elite club competition in the last 16 for the previous five years, with the last four of those failures coming after they were beaten in the first leg. Monaco last season, Bayern Munich in the two years before that and also AC Milan have all taken advantage of the Gunners' defensive weaknesses and mental fragility in the knockout stages. But Wenger is tired of watching his team come apart at the seams in the tournament he still yearns to win for the first time and has made a point of warning his players to show more composure when Barca arrive at the Emirates Stadium. ""It's a good opportunity to show we have learned because it is true we have given ourselves a difficult task after the first home leg and maybe after we have been a bit too keen to make the difference in the first game,"" Wenger told reporters on Monday. ""We need to find the right balance between being audacious because that is what you will need to be against Barcelona. ""We need to be strong defensively as a unit and not put ourselves in front of a very difficult task in the second leg."" While Wenger hopes his warning not to go for broke too soon will draw a measured and mature response from his side, the Gunners boss knows the task facing them to advance to the quarter-finals for the first time since 2010 is a daunting one. With Lionel Messi, Neymar and Luis Suarez forming a formidable front three, Luis Enrique's men are firm favourites to reach the last eight for a ninth consecutive season as they bid to retain the trophy. Even Wenger, whose side were knocked out by the Spanish giants in 2011, acknowledged the superiority of Barcelona's world-class squad, saying: ""Obviously Barcelona are favourites. ""Of course, our world is not perfect and no team is perfect. But Barca are not far from it, I must say."" Arsenal go into the tie after a disappointing goalless draw against Championship club Hull City in the FA Cup fifth round. But Wenger will recall all his big guns after resting them on Saturday and he insisted the challenge of taking on a club of Barca's class was in some ways easier than having to find a way to motivate his players against lower-league opposition. ""Honestly, of course the difficulty of the task is completely different but it is more difficult to prepare against Hull than Barcelona,"" Wenger said. ""Against Barcelona everyone is naturally focused. It is more to create belief and confidence, because Barcelona are super favourites in this game. ""Against Hull it is more to raise the urgency level and convince everybody that it is a very difficult game.

997,22/02/2016,16:13,Wenger wants Arsenal to take out Euro frustrations on Barca,"Arsene Wenger has demanded Arsenal learn the lessons of their past Champions League meltdowns when they host holders Barcelona in the last 16, first leg on Tuesday.","Wenger's side have been eliminated from Europe's elite club competition in the last 16 for the previous five years, with the last four of those failures coming after they were beaten in the first leg. Monaco last season, Bayern Munich in the two years before that and also AC Milan have all taken advantage of the Gunners' defensive weaknesses and mental fragility in the knockout stages. But Wenger is tired of watching his team come apart at the seams in the tournament he still yearns to win for the first time and has made a point of warning his players to show more composure when Barca arrive at the Emirates Stadium. ""It's a good opportunity to show we have learned because it is true we have given ourselves a difficult task after the first home leg and maybe after we have been a bit too keen to make the difference in the first game,"" Wenger told reporters on Monday. ""We need to find the right balance between being audacious because that is what you will need to be against Barcelona. ""We need to be strong defensively as a unit and not put ourselves in front of a very difficult task in the second leg."" While Wenger hopes his warning not to go for broke too soon will draw a measured and mature response from his side, the Gunners boss knows the task facing them to advance to the quarter-finals for the first time since 2010 is a daunting one. With Lionel Messi, Neymar and Luis Suarez forming a formidable front three, Luis Enrique's men are firm favourites to reach the last eight for a ninth consecutive season as they bid to retain the trophy. Even Wenger, whose side were knocked out by the Spanish giants in 2011, acknowledged the superiority of Barcelona's world-class squad, saying: ""Obviously Barcelona are favourites. ""Of course, our world is not perfect and no team is perfect. But Barca are not far from it, I must say."" Arsenal go into the tie after a disappointing goalless draw against Championship club Hull City in the FA Cup fifth round. But Wenger will recall all his big guns after resting them on Saturday and he insisted the challenge of taking on a club of Barca's class was in some ways easier than having to find a way to motivate his players against lower-league opposition. ""Honestly, of course the difficulty of the task is completely different but it is more difficult to prepare against Hull than Barcelona,"" Wenger said. ""Against Barcelona everyone is naturally focused. It is more to create belief and confidence, because Barcelona are super favourites in this game. ""Against Hull it is more to raise the urgency level and convince everybody that it is a very difficult game. ""Tomorrow everyone is convinced that we absolutely need to have, as a squad, total focus to have a chance and that is what I try to raise. Belief, confidence and let's go for it. ""We will have the ball far less than normal, so we have to make more of it when we get chances.""

998,22/02/2016,02:05,Wenger demands bite against Barca as Juve host Bayern,Champions League holders Barcelona arrive at the Emirates on Tuesday to tackle an Arsenal side seeking to rediscover the ruthless streak which deserted them in a tame weekend goalless FA Cup tie.,"The clash headlines a week of European action that sees Bayern Munich at Juventus, PSV Eindhoven hosting Atletico Madrid and Manchester City at Dynamo Kiev. Barca and Arsenal are no strangers in this arena, the pair having fought out the 2006 final, with the Catalans prevailing over Wenger's 'Invincibles' 2-1 in Paris. Lionel Messi then scored four times when Barca dished out a 4-1 drubbing to the Gunners in a 2010 quarter-final. And the Argentine superstar inspired a Barca second leg fightback after Arsenal edged the last 16, first leg home tie 2-1 in 2011. To prevent a similar scenario this time around, Gunners coach Arsene Wenger has told his team to bare its teeth on Tuesday after Saturday's 0-0 stalemate against second-tier Hull. The Frenchman knows a similarly toothless display against free-scoring Luis Suarez and Neymar will leave his men on the back foot for next month's last 16, return leg at the Camp Nou. ""We need to be more efficient in the final third because today (on Saturday) we have more than 70 percent possession and we will not get that on Tuesday night (against Barcelona),"" Wenger said. ""We started favourites (against Hull), we won't be on Tuesday night so on Tuesday night we need great solidarity because we need to defend well, we know that, and make the maximum of our possession, what we didn't do today."" Mesut Ozil, one of nine changes against Hull, will return to face Barcelona after recovering from a cold. Arsenal centre-back Per Mertesacker endorsed his manager's assessment. ""Overall, we missed a bit of something and we have to come back quickly in three days time,"" said the German world champion. Barca turn up seemingly firing on all cylinders and eight points clear in La Liga after Suarez and Neymar teamed up in the weekend's 2-1 win at Las Palmas. Barca boss Luis Enrique rested only Gerard Pique, whilst Sergio Busquets was also suspended from the side that is expected to start in north London. Bayern head to Turin to face last season's runners-up Juve with the German giants having Thomas Mueller to thank for digging them out of trouble in a 3-1 home comeback win over Darmstadt over the weekend. Mueller warned that Bayern cannot expect to enjoy the same 81 percent possession in Turin which allowed them to pepper in 36 shots on Darmstadt's goal. ""(Saturday's) match had nothing to do with Juventus, we're just happy to have won and taken three more points,"" said Mueller. ""We have to be tighter in Turin, we can't allow them so many chances."" Juve are on a 16-match unbeaten home run in European competition, their last defeat coming in 2013 to Bayern in the Germans' title-winning season. Juventus striker Mario Mandzukic is expected to return from a three-week injury lay-off to come up against his old side. Defender Patrice Evra said the Croatian will have even more reason to score. ""All the players are important but when someone has already played for the other team, he usually has different motivation to the rest of us, and he won't hide that fact. ""He will want to hit Bayern where it hurts. He'll be even more hungry than the rest of us."" Bayern coach Pep Guardiola moves to the Premier League next season and his future employers Man City travel to Kiev on the back of Sunday's 5-1 drubbing by Chelsea in the FA Cup. Coach Manuel Pellegrini courted controversy by fielding five full debutants in his bid to save firepower for Ukraine. Wednesday's second game sees two-time runners up Atletico at 1988 champions and Dutch leaders PSV."
999,21/02/2016,22:31,"Advantage Barca as Real Madrid, Atletico held",Cristiano Ronaldo missed a penalty as Real Madrid's hopes of catching La Liga leaders Barcelona were all but ended with a 1-1 draw at Malaga on Sunday.,"Madrid remain nine points behind Barca with 13 games to go after Raul Albentosa cancelled out Ronaldo's opener. Atletico Madrid also failed to gain significant ground on Barca as they were held 0-0 at home by Villarreal to move eight points behind in second. However, Gary Neville's upturn in fortunes as Valencia boss continued with a third win in a week, 2-1 at Granada. Zinedine Zidane's men were left to rue Ronaldo's miss from the spot to make it 2-0 before the break when Carlos Kameni dived to his left to parry the three-time World Player of the Year's effort. ""It is obviously going to be difficult because we have dropped two points, but we won't give up,"" said Zidane. ""There are 39 points still to play for. You think the league is lost, but the players and myself don't believe that."" Madrid were without the injured Karim Benzema and Gareth Bale, while James Rodriguez was left on the bench by Zidane. The visitors were lucky to go in front as Ronaldo headed home Toni Kroos's free-kick despite clearly standing in an offside position. There was no doubt about the penalty award two minutes later, though, when Ronaldo was brought down by Weligton. Yet, despite being normally lethal from the spot, the Portuguese was denied by a fine low save by Kameni. Malaga missed a great chance to level before the break as Jesus Navas parried Duje Cop's shot into the air and Sergio Ramos got back to clear the looping ball off the line. And Navas then made an incredible stop just after the restart when Nacho turned Juanpi's cross towards his own goal. Yet, the Madrid stopper was finally beaten when Malaga's two centre-backs combined for the equaliser as Weligton's low cross was coolly slotted home at the back post by Albentosa. Chances were far harder to come by at the Vicente Calderon as the two best defences in the league stood firm. Atletico's top scorer Antoine Griezmann headed Juanfran's inch-perfect cross just wide before Angel Correa's audacious chipped effort forced Villarreal goalkeeper Alphonse Areola into his only serious save after half-time. And Villarreal could have snatched all three points on the break when Cedric Bakambu blazed over with just Jan Oblak to beat. Elsewhere, Neville's Valencia again rode their luck, but recorded back-to-back league wins for just the second time this season as Granada passed up a wave of second-half opportunities. With confidence high from their 6-0 thrashing of Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday, Valencia started the stronger and only great saves from Andres Fernandez prevented Paco Alcacer and Andres Gomez from giving Valencia a half-time lead. Dani Parejo eventually opened the scoring 10 minutes after the break when he swept home Alcacer's knockdown. However, Granada should have levelled in the final half hour as David Barral hit the bar and Youssef El-Arabi fired off target from close range. Santi Mina sealed the points for Valencia on the counter-attack before Edgar Mendes pulled a goal back in stoppage time. ""I think at the moment we need to win all our games to keep the momentum going,"" said Neville. ""The dressing room changed significantly in the last week in terms of mood as when you win there is a stronger belief."" Sevilla remain eight points off Villarreal in the battle for the final Champions League place as they blew a two-goal lead to draw 2-2 at Rayo Vallecano. Real Sociedad's surge up the table continued as Jonathas's brilliant strike handed them a 1-0 win over Athletic Bilbao in the Basque derby to move into the top half."
1000,17/02/2016,21:31,Managing Messi a 'privilege' - Luis Enrique,Barcelona boss Luis Enrique described the fortune to have Lionel Messi on his side a 'privilege' after the five-time World Player of the Year scored his 300th La Liga goal.,"Messi scored twice in a 3-1 win at Sporting Gijon on Wednesday to take his tally to 301 league goals in 335 games as Barca extended their lead at the top of the table to six points. ""To be able to count on Leo is always a privilege no matter how the opponent plays,"" said Luis Enrique. Barca are now heavy favourites to seal a fifth Liga title in seven years with Atletico Madrid their closest challengers and Real Madrid a further point adrift in third. ""I am optimistic in any situation and this is a favourable one,"" added Luis Enrique. ""But that doesn't mean anything because we all know that when the final games of the season approach, especially the last 10, the teams in trouble begin to win games and it becomes very difficult to take the points. ""We are where we want to be and we depend on ourselves."" The only negative for the European champions was another missed penalty, this time by Luis Suarez. Messi had caused a worldwide sensation by passing a spot-kick into Suarez's path to complete his hat-trick in the 6-1 rout of Celta Vigo on Sunday. However, between Messi, Suarez and Neymar, Barca have now missed seven of their 15 directly taken penalties this season. It mattered little though, as Suarez made amends with a terrific finish for his 40th goal of the season 23 minutes from time. ""We want to improve in that aspect, but those that miss them are the ones that take the responsiblity to hit them. ""We have confidence in Leo, Luis and Ney. They are great penalty takers."""
1001,15/02/2016,00:00,"Messi, Suarez 'penalty of the century' rehearsed - Neymar",Barcelona star Neymar claimed he was meant to be the recipient of Lionel Messi's sensational pass from a penalty that was converted by Luis Suarez as the European champions routed Celta Vigo 6-1 on Sunday.,"Messi and Suarez combined to score one of the classiest penalties in football history as Messi squared his spot-kick for the onrushing Suarez to complete his hat-trick ahead of Neymar. ""It was designed for me, we had practised it, but Luis was closer,"" Neymar told Barca TV. ""It doesn't matter, he scored so it worked well."" Barca were already leading 3-1 when Messi -- who has missed 17 of 83 penalties in his career -- was chopped down inside the area after an outrageous piece of skill on the by-line. Messi with a brilliant free-kick, Ivan Rakitic and Neymar got the other goals as Barca moved three points clear at the top of La Liga. ""The forwards are very generous. We love each other a lot and that friendship is the most important thing, no matter who scores the goals,"" added Neymar. The penalty brought back memories of another Barca legend Johan Cruyff when he and Jesper Olsen played a one-two for the Dutchman to score when playing for Ajax against Helmond Sport in 1982. ""We all remember Cruyff's goal,"" said Barca boss Luis Enrique. ""I wouldn't dare to do it because I would tread on the ball. ""Some will like it, some won't, but as Barca players and members of the club, on top of winning titles we try to enjoy our football in a spectacular way."" Spanish sports daily AS quickly christened the move as the ""penalty of the century."" Yet, other sections of the Spanish media also claimed Barca's creativity boarded on a lack of respect for their opponents. ""We have to enjoy our football, respect the opponents and try to show we are the best through the way we play,"" added Enrique. ""In this country a kick is better accepted than a piece of skil. It doesn't bother us."" French duo Thierry Henry and Robert Pires tried a similar trick without success as they botched a penalty for Arsenal against Manchester City in 2005. And Barca defender Jordi Alba admitted the South American duo had caught even their teammates by surprise. ""Leo always invents things and it was perfect,"" said the Spanish international. ""We hadn't seen it in any training session, we didn't know anything."""
1002,14/02/2016,22:35,Suarez hat-trick as Barca hit Celta for six,Barcelona maintained their grip on the Spanish title thanks to a wonderful Luis Suarez hat-trick to see off a spirited Celta Vigo 6-1 on Sunday.,"Atletico Madrid remain three points behind as they were 1-0 winners at Getafe thanks to Fernando Torres's first minute goal. Real Madrid slip down to third, a further point adrift of Barca, who also have a game in hand on both clubs from the capital. Lionel Messi's brilliant free-kick opened the scoring at the Camp Nou, but Celta deservedly drew level before half-time through John Guidetti's penalty. However, Suarez took over in the final half hour as he swept home Messi's fine through ball and before prodding home from point-blank range. The best was still to come, though, as Messi passed a penalty into Suarez's path to complete his hat-trick before Ivan Rakitic and Neymar rounded off the scoring. The final score was harsh on an under-strength Celta, who acquited themselves well for the first hour before being blown away by the magic of Barca's star front three. Messi got a festival of brilliant goals started with a sumptuous free-kick from 25 yards into the top corner just before the half hour mark. Yet, Celta reacted positively and after Bravo parried Claudio Beauvue's spectacular volley, the visitors were given a lifeline as Jordi Alba chopped down Guidetti inside the area. The Swede missed a spot-kick as Celta bowed out the Copa del Rey semi-finals against Sevilla in midweek, but the former Manchester City and Celtic striker dispatched the penalty confidently into the bottom corner. Barca started much more brightly after the break and Suarez hit the post following brilliantly wing play from Neymar just 60 seconds into the second-half. The Uruguayan was more precise on the hour mark as he swept home Messi's scooped through ball first time into the top corner. More magical footwork from Messi and Neymar left Suarez with an open goal to move back ahead of Cristiano Ronaldo as La Liga's top scorer 15 minutes from time. However, it was his third that will be replayed the world over as after Messi was chopped down inside the area, he causally passed the ball into the path of the onrushing Suarez to slot home. The party wasn't finished there as Suarez's lovely through ball was looped over Sergio Alvarez by Rakitic for the fifth. And Suarez added another assist to a sparkling performance for Neymar also to dink the ball over the stranded Alvarez in stoppage time. Atletico had a far more routine win at Getafe to remain in the title hunt. Torres ended a five-month goal drought to net his 100th Atletico goal against Eibar last weekend and was brilliantly picked out by Yannick Carrasco's low cross to get the visitors off to the perfect start. Atletico then held on to record their 15th clean sheet in 24 Liga games this season to leapfrog Real Madrid back into second place. However, Diego Simeone's men did suffer a big injury blow when Carrasco hobbled off with ankle ligament damage early in the second period. The Belgian international is now a major doubt for both Atletico's trips to PSV Eindhoven in the Champions League last-16 next week and the Madrid derby in a fortnight. Elsewhere, Sevilla closed the gap on Villarreal in the battle for the fourth Champions League place to eight points with a 2-0 win over relegation threatened Las Palmas. Second-half goals from Ever Banega and Kevin Gameiro overcame the Canary Islanders' resistance to register Sevilla's 13th consecutive home win in all competitions. Basque minnows Eibar's brilliant second season in the top flight continued as they saw off Levante 2-0 to move up to sixth. And Real Sociedad moved into the top half with their third straight win 3-0 over Granada."
1003,13/02/2016,12:42,"I'd only return to Liverpool, says Suarez","Barcelona striker Luis Suarez would only return to the English Premier League if it was to rejoin former club Liverpool, he revealed in a British newspaper interview published on Saturday.","""I'd prefer to stay here (Barcelona) for many more years,"" he told the Daily Mail. ""I know it doesn't always turn out that way. But if I had to return to the Premier League, I would only go to Liverpool. ""I wouldn't go to another team. It wouldn't be a move for money. I'd also love to play again for Ajax as they allowed me to develop as a player in Europe."" Suarez, 29, scored 82 goals for Liverpool in a three-and-a-half-year spell and almost inspired the team to Premier League glory in 2014 before leaving for Barcelona. The Uruguayan quickly struck up an understanding with Lionel Messi and Neymar at the Camp Nou and their goals fired Barca to a treble of La Liga, Copa del Rey and Champions League titles in his first season. Barcelona are currently three points clear in La Liga with a game in hand, but Suarez admits that he misses the competitiveness of English football -- typified by Leicester City's current position as league leaders. ""In the Premier League you never really know what is going to happen,"" he said. ""There is very little between the teams. Here, three or four teams aside, there is a difference with the smaller teams. ""I don't mean this to sound disrespectful, but there are some games where you look at the press and they are asking: 'Let's see how many goals Barcelona are going to score today.' ""In the Premier League, you never know what is going to happen and that is something I miss."""
1004,12/02/2016,18:04,Messi named La Liga player of month...for first time,"In a stellar 12-year career, Lionel Messi has won the world player of the year award five times and broken endless goalscoring records, but he had never been named player of the month in Spain, until now.","The 28-year-old Argentine forward received the award for La Liga's player of the month for January on Friday, the first time he has won a prize inaugurated in 2013. His eternal rival Cristiano Ronaldo won the award back in November 2013 and the likes of Atletico Madrid pair Antoine Griezmann and Diego Godin and Nolito of Celta Vigo have won it twice. Messi, meanwhile, has had to wait until now despite winning the La Liga title seven times in his career. As well as winning the Ballon d'or in January, Messi scored six goals in five games in La Liga to help Luis Enrique's side hold a three-point lead at the top of the table over Atletico Madrid while also having a game in hand. Messi, who became the all-time leading scorer in La Liga in 2014, has scored 298 goals in Spain's top flight and will have the chance to reach the 300 mark at home to Celta on Sunday."

Messi missed Wednesday's 1-1 Copa del Rey semi-final second-leg draw with Valencia, with the Catalan side prevailing 8-1 on aggregate. The five-time World Player of the Year is due to start Sunday's Liga clash with Celta Vigo at the Camp Nou where he needs only two goals to become the first player in the Spanish league to score 300 goals. ""With the renewed presence of Leo Messi in training Barca is already focussing on the next Liga outing,"" the club said. Messi suffered renal colic, a problem commonly caused by kidney stones, in Japan in December forcing him to miss eventual winners Barcelona's semi-final against China's Guangzhou Evergrande. He recovered in time to line up in the final where Barca beat Argentina's River Plate 3-0 as he scored the opening goal."

Suarez, who scored four times in the first-leg, and Neymar have been rested along with the likes of Andres Iniesta, Sergio Busquets and Gerard Pique as Enrique takes advantage of the dead rubber amongst a hectic schedule, which sees Barca play six games in the next 18 days. Neville is fighting for his job after suffering what Valencia sporting director Jesus Garcia Pitarch described as one of the worst results in the club's history in the first-leg. The former Manchester United captain has also failed to win any of his nine La Liga matches since taking charge in December. ""I've got full belief in myself, full belief in the players and from my point of view the only thing we can do now for the club and the fans is win football matches,"" Neville told the club's website."

Messi is due back on Wednesday, when Barca face Valencia in the Copa del Rey semi-final second leg, with the Catalans firmly in control after the 7-0 first leg drubbing they handed Gary Neville's team as Messi bagged a hat-trick. The five time World Player of the Year is reported to be receiving lithotripsy, a procedure involving ultrasound shock waves to break down problem kidney stones.

Victory also extended Barca's unbeaten run in all competitions to 28 games, matching the previous club record set by Pep Guardiola's side in 2010/11. ""Perhaps it wasn't a spectacular game,"" Iniesta told Canal Plus. ""But they are three important points and it was very important for us not to drop points here."" Wednesday's 7-0 thrashing of Valencia aside, Barca have begun to show signs of fatigue in recent weeks after an already gruelling schedule this season as they remain on track to repeat their treble triumph of Champions League, La Liga and Copa del Rey from last season. However, coach Luis Enrique defended his side's display given windy conditions at the Ciudad de Valencia. ""It was a complete game for our part. If it hadn't been, we would have had trouble finishing the game off. ""The team did everything necessary given the circumstances of the game to try and win it from the start. ""I think it was a fair result given what we saw. The second-half was a lot more easy-going for us."" Victory was Enrique's 80th in 100 games since taking charge of Barca in 2014 - nine more than Guardiola managed in his first 100 games as Barca boss. However, Enrique insisted he is more interested in matching Guardiola as Barca's most successful ever coach when it comes to trophies after he won 14 in a glorious four-year spell between 2008 and 2012. ""More than statistics, I am interested in the collective objectives that we have and we can only reach them at the end of the season,"" said Enrique. ""We are very well-positioned in all competitions, but there is a long way to go."""
1009,07/02/2016,14:09,Barca equal unbeaten record with Levante win,Barcelona equalled a club record of 28 games unbeaten to move three points clear at the top of La Liga with a hard-fought 2-0 win at Levante on Sunday.,"The European champions were far from their best in coach Luis Enrique's 100th game in charge, but David Navarro's own goal and Luis Suarez's strike in stoppage time was enough to secure a 10th consecutive win in all competitions. Barca now lead Atletico Madrid by three points and have a game in hand on Diego Simeone's men. Third-placed Real Madrid are now seven points adrift of Barca, but can cut the gap when they travel to Granada later on Sunday. Fresh from hitting Gary Neville's Valencia for seven in the Copa del Rey in midweek, Barca started with purpose and should have been ahead inside two minutes when Lionel Messi was wrongly flagged offside as he slotted home from Andres Iniesta's pass. Neymar then had a fine curling effort beaten to safety by Diego Marino. However, Barca needed a slice of luck to open the scoring on 21 minutes as Jordi Alba burst down the left and his ball into the box was deflected into his own net by Navarro. Barca's star front three of Suarez, Messi and Neymar were kept for long periods, but they nearly combined for a brilliant second moments later when Messi picked out Neymar and his driven cross was turned just wide by Suarez. Levante remain rooted to the foot of the table, but had won their previous two home games and deserved to be at least level at the break as they outplayed the Catalans in the latter stages of the first-half. Verza fired a free-kick inches over before Jefferson Lerma had a great chance to level when he skewed horribly wide with just Claudio Bravo to beat. Jose Luis Morales came closest to equalising when his low effort came back off the post eight minutes before the break. Levante continued to enjoy the better of the game in the second period, but found clear-cut chances hard to come by as former Manchester United forward Giuseppe Rossi's shot from outside the box was the only time Bravo was forced into action. Barca had barely threatened themselves after half-time, but did seal the points deep into stoppage time on the counter-attack as Messi picked out an unmarked Suarez to fire home his 35th goal of the season."

The ruling late Thursday in Santos gave some respite to the Brazilian superstar. Prosecutors accused him of tax evasion and falsifying documents between 2006, when he was just a promising youngster at Brazilian football club Santos, and 2013, when he signed for Barcelona. FC Barcelona faces a separate case in Spain, where Brazilian investment fund DIS has made allegations of fraud and corruption relating to Neymar's signing in 2013. The striker testified this week in Madrid in that case. Da Silva said in his ruling that the case against Neymar, his father and two senior FC Barcelona management figures -- current president Josep Maria Bartomeu and his predecessor Sandro Rosell -- could not go ahead while the tax authorities had not yet completed their probe. ""You cannot open criminal proceedings before the tax authorities complete their accounting,"" he said. Sao Paulo prosecutors said they would appeal and stressed that the ruling ""does not absolve the accused."" ""We have only to wait until the completion of the work by the tax authorities and then we will present an identical set of charges,"" the prosecutor's office said."
1011,04/02/2016,15:46,Investors felt 'betrayed' by Neymar transfer,"Brazilian investment group DIS, who owned 40 percent of Barcelona star Neymar's sporting rights before his move to the Catalan giants from Santos in 2013, claimed on Thursday they felt ""betrayed"" after being shut out of the transfer negotiations.","Neymar, his father, Barcelona president Josep Maria Bartomeu and former club president Sandro Rosell were all called to testify by Spain's highest court this week over a complaint for fraud and corruption brought by DIS. ""I feel morally and economically betrayed,"" DIS owner Delcir Sonda told a press conference in Madrid. The deal was originally valued at 57.1 million euros ($62.1 million) by Barca, 40 million of which was paid to the N&amp;N company owned by the player's father, with Santos receiving just 17.1 million. However, Spanish judicial authorities have estimated the number of simultaneous deals in the transfer amounted to at least 83.3 million. DIS has claimed it was cheated of its real share of the benefits of the 23-year-old's move firstly because part of the transfer fee was concealed by Barcelona and Santos. Moreover, they also believe a pre-contract agreement between Neymar and Barca impeded other clubs from making offers for the player affecting the value of the transfer fee. DIS received just 6.8 million from the deal - 40 percent of the 17.1 million paid to Santos. ""I feel the like the victim of a robbery,"" added Sonda, who invested two million euros for his share in Neymar's rights when he was just a promising talent in Brazil. Football's governing body FIFA has tried to prevent similar cases by banning the third-party ownership system, commonly used in South America, whereby investors buy shares in promising players in the hope of a windfall when they move to European clubs. ""We still don't know what the real cost of the transfer was,"" said Jose Barral, general director of the Sonda group. ""Delcir only began to know about the transaction through the press. Santos, Barcelona and Neymar never contacted him about the subject. He had a share in the deal and was left without knowing what had happened."" Neymar claimed when he appeared before Spain's National Court on Tuesday that he was unaware of the fine details of the contracts his father had negotiated for him to sign. The player's father also exonerated his son, but insisted there was nothing illegal in the way the deal was done."
1012,04/02/2016,02:30,King of bling Neymar untarnished by transfer scandal,"Sporting earrings, shades and posing for selfies with devoted fans, Brazilian superstar Neymar's swagger was better suited to the red carpet than a grilling from Spain's highest court on the growing scandal of how his transfer from Santos to Barcelona came about in 2013.","Neymar endured the toughest 90 minutes of his season as he and his father were interrogated by a judge on Tuesday over their role in the complicated web of contracts that sealed the transfer after a complaint of fraud and corruption by Brazilian investment fund DIS. His biggest legal battle may yet come back at home, though, as Brazilian prosecutors have also filed tax fraud and forgery allegations. Yet, Brazil's golden boy, who is expected to captain his country on home soil at the Rio Olympics later this year, remains one of sport's most marketable assets according to industry experts. Major sponsors have flocked to the 23-year-old's door for his good looks, happy-go-lucky nature and silky skills with Nike, Gillette, Panasonic and Volkswagen among Neymar's big name brands. ""Neymar's legal problems could affect his image in one way or another, but not to the point of breaking contracts or losing sponsors,"" Erich Beting, director of Maquina do Esporte and an expert in football marketing in Brazil, told AFP. ""Neymar has had a teflon-like ability since the beginning of his career."" The $17 million dollars he raked in from sponsors outweighed the $14 million he made from Barca in 2015, according to Forbes magazine, drawing comparisons with David Beckham. ""He is someone that everyone knows, from the 70-year-old grandmother to the five-year-old grandson,"" continues Beting. ""When you reach the status where people want to be like you, that makes you priceless for brands and that is what he has managed."" Neymar's deeply religious and family orientated values are also a magnet for sponsors. His four-year-old son Davi Lucca is often seen with his father at the Camp Nou on matchdays, whilst he has a giant tattoo of his sister Rafaella's face on his right arm. However, it is his father and agent, Neymar Sr, a former mechanic, who has drawn the attention of judicial authorities in Spain and Brazil, as well as accusations he has hijacked his son's success for his own financial gain. ""My father is doing everything to ensure that I can just focus on playing football. He handles the books, but in the moment when you see someone you love suffering, it starts to hurt,"" Neymar told Brazilian TV station Globo on Sunday. Most importantly, it is his performances on the field that have kept Neymar's earning potential bulletproof in the face of fiscal problems. In 2015 he enjoyed by a distance his best year since moving to Europe as Barca won five trophies with Neymar matching Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo as top scorer in the Champions League. Messi and Ronaldo have dominated as the kings of world football for the past decade, but Neymar's ascension as the heir to their throne was confirmed as he featured on the podium behind them at the Ballon d'Or gala to crown the world's best player in January. At Barcelona he has not only formed one of the deadliest strike forces the world has ever seen with Messi and Luis Suarez, but the three have bonded in a manner rarely seen in ego-driven dressing rooms at top clubs. Neymar habitually speaks of the more soft-spoken Messi as his ""idol"" and stressed he is happy with his current surroundings in the Catalan capital. Yet, his refusal to sign a new contract with Barca - which expires in 2018 - and significantly raise his 190-million-euro ($207 million) buyout clause has the likes of Real Madrid and Manchester United on alert. Indeed, Neymar Sr has sought tax and judicial reassurances from the hierarchy at the Camp Nou before considering committing his future to Barcelona. ""Living at a club like Barca can be hell, but Neymar has shown his ability to handle the fame and excess,"" Ramon Miravitllas, writer of the book 'The Political Function of Barca', told AFP. Ensuring his future remains at the Camp Nou won't come cheap for the European champions."
1013,03/02/2016,23:02,"Suarez, Messi hat-tricks hit Neville's Valencia for seven","Luis Suarez scored four and Lionel Messi hit a hat-trick as Barcelona piled more misery on Gary Neville's ill-fated reign as Valencia boss to take an unassailable 7-0 lead in their Copa del Rey semi-final, first-leg on Wednesday.","Two fine finishes inside 12 minutes from Suarez put Barca in control before Messi rounded off a fine team move for Barca's third. It could have been even worse for Valencia as Neymar hit the post from the penalty spot after Shkodran Mustafi was sent-off for bringing down Messi inside the area. However, Messi and Suarez both added two more after the break to make next week's second-leg at the Mestalla a formality. The Cup had been Neville's one refuge during a winless run of eight league games since taking charge in December, but Valencia were blown away by a Barca side back to their best and on the verge of a fifth final in six seasons. Neymar had made headlines earlier in the week as he was quizzed by a judge in Spain's top court over the murky transfer deal which brought him to Barca in 2013 amidst corruption and fraud allegations. However, he showed his performances continue to be unaffected by off-field problems as he drove at the Valencia defence before playing in Suarez to fire across Australian international Matt Ryan into the far corner. Aleix Vidal then cut-back Sergio Busquets's ball over the top of the Valencia defence for Suarez to slam home his 33rd goal of the season five minutes later. Messi was left with the simple task of slotting in his first of the evening from close range after great work by Andres Iniesta and Suarez just before the half-hour mark. Valencia were happy to get to the break just three down as Messi then hit the bar from Suarez's brilliant low cross before the Argentine was clipped by Mustafi as he bore down on goal. Neymar was over-confident with his one-step run-up, though, as his penalty came back off the post. Gerard Pique, Busquets and Messi all fired just off target as Barca continued to run riot after the break. However, the biggest cheer of the night from the home fans was reserved for on-loan Real Madrid winger Denis Cheryshev's introduction as a substitute on his Valencia debut. Cheryshev's inclusion when he should have been suspended saw Madrid thrown out of the competition in December. Messi latched onto Suarez's lovely backheel to make it 4-0 and then completed his hat-trick with a fierce effort that Ryan was disappointed to see slip through his grasp. Suarez rounded off the scoring as he powered home a header from Adriano's cross and fired in a low shot at the near post two minutes from time."

""The challenge scared me,"" Enrique said after the game. Atletico were eventually reduced to nine men at the Camp Nou as Diego Godin was also sent off in the second-half as they fell three points behind Barca in the title race. The Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) said the suspension was due to the ""special seriousness"" of the challenge. Atletico are facing a defensive headache for their next La Liga clash against Eibar on Saturday with right-back Juanfran also suspended, whilst Montenegrin centre-back Stefan Savic suffered a thigh strain in training on Wednesday."

However, the pair were also hit with a further legal setback later in the day when Brazilian prosecutors filed a tax fraud and forgery case against them. Investigators in both countries suspect Neymar's family and Barcelona hid the real value of the deal. Barcelona valued the transfer at about 57 million euros ($62 million), but Spanish authorities think it added up to more than 83 million euros. Despite his problems off the pitch, Neymar's performances for Barcelona have been consistently brilliant - scoring 21 goals this season as part of his fearsome strike partnership with World Player of the Year Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez. ""From zero to one million, it affects him at 0.000001 percent,"" Barca boss Luis Enrique said of Neymar's judicial problems on Tuesday. ""It has nothing to do with football, this is an issue that will be resolved as it should be."""

Prosecutors also brought charges against his father and two senior FC Barcelona management figures, its current president Josep Maria Bartomeu and his predecessor Sandro Rosell. The federal prosecution service said in a statement the charges related to ""tax evasion and forgery."" FC Barcelona also faces a separate case in Spain, where Brazilian investment fund DIS has made allegations of fraud and corruption relating to Neymar's signing in 2013. Neymar gave testimony in that case at Spain's National Court earlier Tuesday, though formal charges have not yet been brought over those allegations. DIS held 40 percent of the 23-year-old's sporting rights when he played at Santos, and has claimed it was cheated of its real share of the transfer due to parallel contracts that Barcelona and Santos allegedly used to hide the total cost. The transfer deal was originally valued at 57.1 million euros ($62.2 million) by Barca. But Spanish judicial authorities have estimated it added up to at least 83.3 million euros -- with the difference allegedly going to Neymar and his family, and Santos. At Barcelona, Neymar is one part of one of the world's most potent football strike forces, alongside Argentine superstar Lionel Messi and Uruguay's Luis Suarez. But the club has faced numerous legal headaches off the field. Messi himself has been called to stand trial from May 31 for tax fraud in a separate case."

However, Spanish judicial authorities have estimated the number of simultaneous deals in the transfer amounted to at least 83.3 million. DIS claimed it was cheated of its real share of the benefits of the 23-year-old's move firstly because part of the transfer fee was concealed by Barcelona and Santos. DIS received 6.8 million euros ($7.7 million) out of the total 17.1 million paid to Santos, but claims it may also be due a share of the overall transfer payments. Neymar arrived at the court to give evidence at 1600 GMT. Barca president Josep Maria Bartomeu and his predecessor Sandro Rosell had refused to testify before the judge on Monday. The pair instead insisted on the version of events they had given for a previous hearing, according to judicial sources.

Brazilian authorities have also taken action freezing $47 million in assets belonging to Neymar over tax evasion allegations between 2011 and 2013. In another case on Thursday a Brazilian court rejected the player's appeal against tax fraud when he was still a Santos player, imposing a fine of $112,000. And on Sunday Brazilian magazine Veja reported the Brazilian tax authorities had reported the player and his father for tax evasion and falsifying documents in the tax declarations of his salary at Santos and his signing for Barcelona. ""There is nothing against us. The trial is an investigation to know what happened in Neymar's transfer,"" Neymar's father told Globo. ""If we committed any tax error then tell us, but to accuse us of tax evasion or falsifying documents goes beyond the limits."" The controversy surrounding the deal hasn't affected Neymar's performances on the field as he helped Barca to a treble of Champions League, La Liga and Copa del Rey last season.

His elder brother Homayoun, 15, made him the blue-and-white-striped plastic shirt with Messi's named scrawled in marker pen and posted the photos of Murtaza wearing it on Facebook in mid-January. Jorge Messi, Lionel's father, told AFP on Saturday that the footballer was aware of the photos that made waves on social media and ""wants to do something"" for his young fan. The Afghanistan Football Federation (AFF) on Monday said Messi was keen to meet Murtaza as soon as possible, though no date or venue has so far been finalised. ""Messi has been in communication with the federation to set up a meeting with the young boy,"" AFF spokesman Sayed Ali Kazemi told AFP. ""We are working to see whether Messi will come to Afghanistan or the five-year-old will travel to Spain or they will meet in a third country."" There was no immediate comment from FC Barcelona. Setting up a meeting in Afghanistan, in the grip of a fierce Taliban insurgency, is fraught with security challenges. The Spanish embassy in Kabul told AFP it would do whatever possible to facilitate a meeting in a European destination. Murtaza's father, a poor farmer in Ghazni's Jaghori district, admitted he could not afford to buy him a replica jersey, adding that Murtaza only had a punctured ball to play with. Photos of the boy wearing the improvised Messi jersey -- made from grocery bags discarded by their neighbour -- has touched a chord with football fans around the world. Sport was rarely played under Taliban rule, and the football stadium in Kabul was a notorious venue for executions, stonings and mutilations. Football and cricket are the two most popular sports in the war-ravaged country."
1023,01/02/2016,07:12,'Prove it!'

""Before saying nonsense -- that we hid this, or hid that -- they should prove it,"" he said. On Thursday Neymar lost his appeal against a fine imposed by tax authorities in 2012 for irregularities in his income tax declaration. The case involved the player's father, whom Neymar also defended in the Globo interview. ""My father is doing everything to ensure that I can just focus on playing football. He handles the books. But in the moment when you see someone you love suffering, it starts to hurt,"" the star forward said. Neymar is also embroiled in legal action in Spain, where he has been ordered to give evidence on February 2 over alleged fraud surrounding his transfer to Barcelona from Santos in 2013. The $112,000 fine is unlikely to perturb the Brazilian star too much as he reportedly earns around $215,000 a week at European champions Barcelona."
1024,01/02/2016,02:05,"Neymar, Barca in the dock over murky transfer",Barcelona star Neymar and president Josep Maria Bartomeu will be called to give evidence this week in the murky case over the deal which brought the Brazilian to the Catalan giants from Santos in 2013.,"Bartomeu is due to attend Spain's national court on Monday with Neymar to follow on Tuesday. Sandro Rosell, Bartomeu's predecessor who was president of the club when Neymar was signed, and the player's parents have also been called to testify. Public prosecutors filed for action to be taken against all the parties after a complaint of fraud and corruption was launched by the Brazilian investment fund DIS, which held 40 percent of Neymar's sporting rights when he played at Santos. DIS has claimed it was cheated of its real share of the benefits of the 23-year-old's transfer because part of the transfer fee was concealed by Barcelona and Santos. The deal was originally valued at 57.1 million euros ($62.1 million) by Barca, 40 million of which was paid to the N&amp;N company owned by the player's father with Santos receiving just 17.1 million. However, Spanish judicial authorities have estimated the number of simultaneous deals in the transfer amounted to at least 83.3 million. After hearing the testimony, a judge will decide whether the case will progress and charges be filled. However, it is just one of a number of legal battles facing the club, whose reputation has been hit by a series of off-field scandals in recent times despite their continued success on the pitch. In a separate lawsuit, a judge in May 2015 ordered Bartomeu, Rosell and the club itself to stand trial over alleged tax fraud linked to the signing. The scandal over the concealed transfer fee led to Rosell's resignation as president in January 2014 with then vice-president Bartomeu taking charge. By splitting the fee between a number of different contracts between Santos and Neymar himself, Barcelona stand accused of defrauding the Spanish taxman of 12.7 million euros. Prosecutors are seeking a prison sentence of two years and three months for Bartomeu and nearly seven years for Rosell, as well as a 22.2 million euro fine for the club. No date for a trial has been set so far. A Brazilian court has also taken action freezing $47 million in assets belonging to Neymar over tax evasion allegations between 2011 and 2013. Neymar's Argentine teammates Lionel Messi and Javier Mascherano have also been in trouble with the Spanish authorities over tax issues. Five-time World Player of the Year Messi will stand trial for tax fraud charges on May 31 along with his father for allegedly failing to declare 4.16 million euros ($4.69 million) related to his image rights between 2007 and 2009. Earlier this month, Mascherano accepted a suspended one-year prison sentence a fine of 816,000 euros for committing tax fraud of 1.5 million euros also related to image rights. Despite the series of legal scandals engulfing the club, Bartomeu comprehensively won club elections in July to retain his mandate until 2021 thanks to the team's success in winning the treble of Champions League, La Liga and Copa del Rey last season. Neymar played a huge role in that success -- leading to third place in the Ballon d'Or earlier this month -- and has performed even better this season, scoring 21 goals as Barca threaten to sweep all before them once more. However, his fiscal problems have cast some doubt over his future at the club with his father Neymar Sr saying he would seek tax assurances before signing an extension to his Barcelona deal, which expires in 2018, amid interest from Manchester United and Real Madrid."
1025,31/01/2016,12:02,Big time Suarez delivers again for Barca,"Always the man for the big occasion, Luis Suarez was Barcelona's match-winner once more as the European champions took firm control of the La Liga title race by defeating closest rivals Atletico Madrid 2-1.","Barca were far from their best on Saturday, outplayed for the first half hour, they fell behind early on. Yet, even Atletico's rock solid defence was powerless to stop a two-goal burst in eight minutes just before half-time from Lionel Messi and Suarez. Victory moves Luis Enrique's men three points clear of Atletico - having also played a game less - and seven ahead of third-placed Real Madrid. Suarez's winning goal was strikingly reminiscent of his strike that beat Real Madrid 2-1 at the height of last season's battle for the Liga title. Using his body strength to hold off Jose Maria Gimenez, he controlled a long ball from Dani Alves before firing into the corner with his second touch. Since his controversial signing for Barca after biting an opponent for the third time in his career at the World Cup 18 months ago - which led to a four-month ban - Suarez has consistently been the man to turn the big games in the Blaugrana's favour. He scored the decisive second goal in the Champions League final as Juventus were downed 3-1 and twice more against Real Madrid in a 4-0 humiliation of Los Blancos earlier this season. Moreover, his presence has completely changed the trajectory of the Barca-Atletico rivalry. The season before his arrival, Atletico went six games unbeaten against the Catalans, knocking them out of the Champions League and winning the Liga title in a final day showdown at the Camp Nou. Since then, Saturday's win takes Barca's winning streak against Los Rojiblancos to six, including returning the favour by winning the title at the Vicente Calderon last season. ""He is such an important player, he makes the difference. Without doubt his arrival has given Barcelona more penetration than they already had,"" said Atletico boss Diego Simeone. ""He has different qualities to the rest. He is strong, a typical number nine in the area, he is a very complete player and he has enriched Barcelona."" Partly due to his previous indiscretions, Suarez has had to watch his strike partners Messi and Neymar be paraded whilst he was sidelined during the recent individual awards season. Yet, it is he who has scored more goals this season than anyone else in Europe with 31 in 32 games. Suarez even took on the goalscoring mantle to keep Barca on top when Messi was out injured for two months earlier in this season. ""I think he was already a very complete player at Liverpool and here he has been even better,"" said Barca boss Luis Enrique. ""Luis gives us a lot of things and all of them are positive."" Since both Luis' arrived at Barcelona, they've won five of a possible six trophies. With a comfortable La Liga lead, a Copa del Rey semi-final and Champions League knockout stages to come, the trophy haul looks set to continue."
1026,30/01/2016,19:30,Barca red hot title favourites - Simeone,Atletico Madrid coach Diego Simeone conceded his side's title chances may have gone as they were reduced to nine men in losing 2-1 to league leaders Barcelona on Saturday.,"Victory moved the European champions three points clear of Atletico - having also played a game less - and seven ahead of third-placed Real Madrid. ""Barcelona continue to be very strong. In their strikers they have the goals and play that makes the difference,"" said the Argentine. ""They are in a very good position, they have three points more than us and a game in hand. ""There is a long way to go and we will see, but normally they don't falter."" Koke had given Atletico the perfect start at the Camp Nou with his 10th-minute opener a just reward for the visitors' strong start. However, two goals in eight minutes from Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez pierced Atletico's usually rock solid defence to put Barca well on course for a fifth title in seven years. ""I am left with the team's response to a difficult start and conceding the goal,"" said Barca boss Luis Enrique. ""We had 15 minutes where against a team as good as Atletico Madrid we were camped in their area and scored twice which put us in command. ""The objective was to kill the game. Despite them having one and then two players less we struggled to kill it off and it was an open game until the end."" Barca's performance was in keeping with recent games against Malaga and Athletic Bilbao as they struggled in the opening stages, but still had enough quality in Messi, Suarez and Neymar to eventually dig themselves out of trouble. The Catalans have already played nine games this year, on the back of a hectic schedule to end 2015 which saw them travel to Japan to win the Club World Cup. And defender Javier Mascherano admitted there has been signs of tiredness in their recent displays. ""We lacked the spark we have had in other games and it cost us. We put a lot into the game in midweek (against Athletic Bilbao) and it is not easy to play every two-and-a-half days. ""It is not an excuse, but, against the nine men, we made sure of the result, didn't take risks and won the three points. ""I think the result makes us stronger going forward. It was important to put some distance between ourselves and Atletico."""
1027,29/01/2016,14:42,Title decider talk too early for Barca boss,Barcelona coach Luis Enrique dismissed suggestions his side will have the La Liga title in their grasp with victory over closest challengers Atletico Madrid on Saturday.,"The European champions are level with Atletico on 48 points at the top of the table, but have a game in hand on Diego Simeone's men, and could also move seven points clear of Real Madrid with a win at the Camp Nou. ""I don't feel like we'll be halfway towards the title if we win tomorrow,"" said Enrique. ""There is a long way to go. The game against Atletico is important, but not key or decisive."" Enrique has overseen a turnaround in fortunes for Barca in this fixture as he has won all five games against Atletico since taking charge at the beginning of last season. Previously, Atletico had gone six matches unbeaten against Barca - culminating in the 1-1 draw that saw them win La Liga in 2014. ""Those statistics are there because my players have been at a very high level,"" added Enrique. ""They've been concentrated, intense and close to perfection. If we lower our standards in those aspects, Atletico have the chance to beat us. ""Playing Atletico is always a tough game. We need to repeat what we did last season. Be reliable in attack and make sure we don't allow them transitions to counter-attack or set-pieces."" Barca look set to be at full-strength as Enrique confirmed Neymar will start despite suffering a knock late on in Wednesday's 3-1 Copa del Rey win over Athletic Bilbao, whilst Jordi Alba has returned to training following a hamstring problem. Andres Iniesta and Sergio Busquets are expected to return after being rested in midweek, whilst Arda Turan should feature for the first time against his old club since sealing a 41 million euro move ($45 million, £31 million) to Barca last July. Turan has settled easily into the Barca side despite having to wait until earlier this month to make his debut due to the Catalans' one-year ban on registering new players. And Enrique believes the Turkish international is better suited to Barca than Atletico's energetic, but less technical style of play. ""His style of player prefers to have the ball than not have it and adapting to a team that has the ball favours him,"" he added. ""He also had the advantage of training with us for five months. Any player that enjoys having the ball finds it easier to adapt to our system."""
1028,28/01/2016,22:11,"Neymar fined $112,000 for Brazil tax evasion","Barcelona star Neymar on Thursday lost an appeal against a $112,000 fine slapped on him for tax evasion during his years with Santos in 2007 and 2008.","The appeal decision confirmed the Brazilian financial authorities' sanction handed down originally in 2012 for irregularities in his income tax declaration, the tax service said. The case also involved the player's father although the fine is unlikely to perturb the Brazilian star too much as he reportedly earns around $215,000 a week at European champions Barcelona. Neymar is also embroiled in legal action in Spain where he has been ordered to give evidence on February 2 for alleged fraud surrounding his transfer to the Catalan giants from Santos in 2013. Barca president Josep Maria Bartomeu, his predecessor Sandro Rosell, Neymar's parents and two directors of Santos have also been called to appear. Spanish public prosecutors filed for action to be taken against all the parties after a complaint of fraud and corruption was launched by the Brazilian investment fund DIS, which held 40 percent of Neymar's sporting rights when he played at Santos, at the court in June 2015. DIS has claimed it was cheated of its real share of the benefits of the 23-year-old's transfer because part of the fee was concealed by Barcelona and Santos. The deal was originally valued at 57.1 million euros ($62.1 million) by the Catalan club, 40 million of which was paid to the N&amp;N company owned by the player's father with Santos receiving just 17.1 million. However, Spanish judicial authorities have estimated the amount to be at least 83.3 million. DIS received 6.8 million euros ($7.7 million) out of the total 17.1 million that Barcelona paid to Santos, but claims it may also be due a share of the overall transfer payments."
1029,26/01/2016,15:23,Barca confident Neymar will extend contract,Barcelona coach Luis Enrique said Tuesday he was confident that Brazilian star Neymar would commit to the Catalan giants beyond his current contract in 2018.,"Asked at the team's press conference if the Brazil captain was ready to extend his stay in Barcelona, Luis Enrique said: ""I believe so, yes."" Neymar, 23, has himself remained vague concerning his future plans, and after stating last month that he was in talks with the club concerning a new contract, he added: ""I don't know, life is very long."" This has lead to speculation of a possible move, including to Liga rivals Real Madrid, with his release clause estimated at 190 million euros ($205m). English side Manchester United also tried to approach the player last year. In recent months Neymar's father has let it be known that his son will only extend with Barca if ""fiscal stability"" was re-established with the player's 2013 transfer currently being investigated for alleged tax fraud. Neymar missed Saturday's 2-1 league win at Malaga because of muscle pain but should line up in Wednesday's Cup quarter-final return-leg tie against Athletic Bilbao at Camp Nou. ""He feels very good and there is no risk (of relapse),"" said Luis Enrique. ""He trained and is in perfect shape to play."""
1030,23/01/2016,19:42,Barca win the mark of champions - Luis Enrique,Barcelona boss Luis Enrique hailed his side's 2-1 win at Malaga as a huge boost for their La Liga title hopes despite admitting he can't remember a poorer first-half display from the European champions.,"Munir El Haddadi got the visitors off to the perfect start with the opening goal after 64 seconds, but Barca were throughly outplayed in the remainder of the first period and were lucky to only concede Juanpi's equaliser 13 minutes before the break. However, five-time world player of the year Lionel Messi provided the inspiration for Enrique's men just after the restart with a stunning volley to move them a point clear of Atletico Madrid at the top of the table. ""To win playing at not our normal level and at a difficult place to come reinforces us and gives us confidence to continue with our objectives,"" said Enrique. ""I am left with the clear improvement of the team in the second-half and the desire the team has to get results. ""They say it is one of the most important characteristics of the big teams: to win when you play badly."" ""When you play well practically everything is easy, but when you play badly and have to overcome difficulty, especially at a place like this where it is always difficult for us, it has more value."" Barca were without the injured Neymar and suspended Gerard Pique, but even accounting for their influence, Enrique was at a loss to explain such a poor first-half display after a perfect start. ""Something which in theory is very positive (the early goal) turned into a nightmare,"" he added. ""We were inferior to Malaga in the first-half. They made a lot of chances from our imprecision. It is difficult to remember such a bad first-half on our part. ""There are many factors which can influence things in football. The players are not machines and they can have a day when things go wrong. Today it was a general problem with the whole team. ""In the second-half I think we competed better, we moved the ball better, but even then we made more mistakes than usual."" Victory takes Barca at least temporarily top of the table with Atletico hosting Sevilla on Sunday ahead of the meeting between the top two next weekend. It was also the first time Barca had won away from home in La Liga since November and captain Andres Iniesta underlined the importance of the three points no matter the performance. ""That is La Liga. It is very difficult to win away from home, but we are very happy because it was a very important game for us,"" he said. ""Picking up three points allows us to keep ourselves at the top of the table."""
1031,22/01/2016,12:30,Juve reject Barca's 80m bid for Dybala: report,"Juventus have rejected an offer from Barcelona for star striker Paulo Dybala that is reported to be in excess of 80m euros ($86.7m), a report claimed Friday.","Dybala, signed last summer from Palermo for 40m euros, has quickly become a fans' favourite in Turin as the champions continue their fightback following a disastrous start to the campaign. In 19 league appearances, the Argentinian has struck 11 goals including some spectacular efforts that have attracted the attention of La Liga giants Barcelona and Real Madrid. A report in Turin-based newspaper Tuttosport claims Juventus president Beppe Marotta rejected an offer of 80m euros for the player when Barcelona sporting director Ariedo Braida knocked on the door in December. It added that Barcelona returned with an improved offer in recent days, which the Italian champions also knocked back. Barcelona and Real Madrid are among the top European clubs reportedly eyeing the 22-year-old, who is known for his creative skills, dribbling and keen eye for goal. If the report is confirmed, it would put Dybala among Barcelona's most highly-rated players, alongside Brazil striker Neymar, who it is estimated cost the club at least 83.4m euros in 2013. Uruguayan Luis Suarez cost the European champions around 95m euros when he joined from Liverpool in 2014. It would also underline Juve's intention to hold on to a player they made great efforts to acquire, securing his signature on a five-year deal shortly after Dybala hit 10 league goals for Palermo prior to Christmas last season. Juventus won their first league and Cup double in 20 years last season, when coach Massimiliano Allegri also steered them to the final of the Champions League, and an eventual 3-1 defeat to Barcelona. Allegri's men sit second in Serie A, two points behind leaders Napoli before hosting Roma on Sunday."
1032,21/01/2016,16:18,Mascherano escapes prison for tax fraud,"Barcelona and Argentina's Javier Mascherano accepted a one-year suspended prison sentence and a fine of 816,000 euros ($891,000) before a judge on Thursday for committing tax fraud of 1.5 million euros.","The plea agreed between the former Liverpool midfielder's lawyers and the public prosecutor in December, was formally processed in a hearing that lasted barely 10 minutes. In Spain sentences less than two years are normally suspended unless the guilty party has previous convictions. The prosecution alleged Mascherano failed to declare over 1.5 million euros in earnings between 2011 and 2013 by ceding his image rights to companies he owns in Portugal and the United States. Mascherano admitted to the two counts of tax fraud against him in October and deposited nearly 1.75 million euros with the tax authorities in September to repay the amount owed plus interest. ""I'm very relieved to know I am back in line,"" Mascherano said in a statement published on his official Twitter account. ""I am a professional sportsman, I don't have great knowledge of tax and legal matters. Therefore, I have to rely on people that manage these technical issues. ""During my whole career I have been an honest and responsable, respectful to my teammates and the clubs I have represented and the countries I have lived in."" Mascherano's club and international teammate Lionel Messi faces similar sanctions as he is due to stand trail for tax fraud on May 31. The recently crowned five-time World Player of the Year and his father have been charged with allegedly failing to declare 4.16 million euros in taxes related to his image rights between 2007 and 2009. Unlike Mascherano, Messi hasn't admitted to any crime, insisting it was his father Jorge Horacio who managed his finances, which makes a similar plea with the authorities less likely."
1033,21/01/2016,01:01,"Barca join Real, Man Utd in 500m euros club","European champions Barcelona joined Real Madrid and Manchester United in earning over 500 million euros ($545.5 million) last season, financial consultants Deloitte revealed in their latest Football Money League published on Thursday.","Madrid topped the table for the 11th year running with earnings of 577 million euros over the course of the season, driven largely by a 22.7 million euros increase in commercial revenue. Barcelona, buoyed by on-pitch success that included a La Liga, Spanish Cup and Champions League treble, climbed from fourth place to second place with revenues of 560.8 million euros, bumping United down to third. ""For the first time, the top three clubs in the Football Money League have all passed the 500m euros revenue mark,"" said Dan Jones from Deloitte's Sport Business Group. ""FC Barcelona's on-pitch achievements in the 2014-15 season have translated to financial success. The European champions have climbed to second place at the expense of Manchester United, with revenue growth across all areas of the business -- matchday, broadcast and commercial."" Barcelona's president Josep Maria Bartomeu told the Financial Times last month that the club aim to become the first to make one billion euros in a year by 2021. Their plans include a 600 million euros renovation of the 93,000-capacity Camp Nou and the opening of more overseas offices. Combined revenue for the top 20 clubs in the list rose eight percent to 6.6 billion euros -- a new record. German champions Bayern Munich fell to fifth, their lowest placing since 2006-07, with Qatar-backed French champions Paris Saint-Germain overtaking them following another year of growth. Manchester City, Arsenal, Chelsea and Liverpool, from the all-powerful English Premier League, round out the top 10 along with beaten Champions League finalists Juventus. Juventus were joined in the top 20 by Serie A counterparts Roma, who climbed from 24th to 16th, but Italian heavyweights AC Milan and Inter Milan slipped to 14th and 19th respectively. United paid the price for failing to qualify for the Champions League in 2013-14, the first season following the retirement of legendary manager Alex Ferguson. But the club's return to the competition under Louis van Gaal -- albeit one that concluded with a group-stage exit -- and a strong commercial operation could see them bounce back to top the list for 2015-16. ""The return to Champions League football, as well as the commencement of a number of significant commercial partnerships, will only strengthen the business in 2015-16,"" said Deloitte's Tim Bridge. ""With this in mind, it would not be surprising to see United top next year's Money League for the first time in 12 years, with the club forecasting revenues of around £500 million (around 650 million euros)."" In total there were nine Premier League clubs in the top 20, while 17 of the top 30 revenue-generating clubs played in the English top flight in 2014-15. England's grip on the list is unlikely to weaken anytime soon, with new television rights deals worth an estimated £8 billion due to kick in later this year.

It's just a bit of minor discomfort,"" Barca said in a statement, with Messi withdrawn at the weekend after feeling a hamstring strain. ""How it progresses will determine his availability for the upcoming matches,"" the European champions added. Barca coach Luis Enrique insisted the decision to withdraw Messi, recently crowned Ballon d'Or winner for a record fifth time, was purely a precautionary measure. ""We spoke and it didn't make any sense to risk it at 2-0 and with all that we have to come,"" Enrique told reporters after the match. Messi opened the scoring on Sunday when he converted a seventh-minute penalty, before he was replaced at the break by Turkish midfielder Arda Turan. Neymar was also on target in the first half, with Luis Suarez netting a hat-trick following the restart to move out in front as La Liga's top scorer with 18 goals.

Messi hasn't always enjoyed the same popularity in the land of his birth as in Barcelona having so far failed to end Argentina's 23-year wait to win a major international tournament. Indeed, he was even reportedly spat at by River Plate fans at Tokyo airport last month after Barca's 3-0 Club World Cup final win over the side from Buenos Aires, despite his muted celebration after scoring the opening goal. ""I know how much effort all those fans made in making that trip, how excited they were and there was me, the Argentinian, scoring the first goal and ruining it all for them. ""I don't know if I was actually saying sorry, but it was a type of apology.""

1040,13/01/2016,11:48,Neymar ordered to appear in Spanish court for fraud,Barcelona's Brazilian star Neymar has been called to give evidence by Spain's national court on February 2 for alleged fraud surrounding his transfer to Barcelona in 2013.,"Both the player's parents, Barcelona president Josep Maria Bartomeu and former club president Sandro Rosell, as well as two directors of Neymar's former club Santos have also been called to declare, according to a court filing released on Wednesday. Barcelona and Santos will also have to give evidence via representatives on February 9 and February 1 respectively. Public prosecutors filed for action to be taken against all the parties after a complaint of fraud and corruption was launched by the Brazilian investment fund DIS, which held 40 percent of Neymar's sporting rights when he played at Santos, at the court in June 2015. DIS has claimed it was cheated of its real share of the benefits of 23-year-old Neymar's transfer in 2013 because part of the transfer fee was concealed by Barcelona and Santos. The deal was originally valued at 57.1 million euros ($62.1 million) by the Catalan club, but the Spanish judicial authorities have estimated the amount to be at least 83.3 million. DIS received 6.8 million euros ($7.7 million) out of the total 17.1 million that Barcelona paid to Santos, but claims it may also be due a share of the overall transfer payments. In a separate lawsuit, a judge in May 2015 ordered Bartomeu, Rosell and the club itself to stand trial over alleged tax fraud linked to the signing. The scandal over the concealed transfer fee led to Rosell's resignation as president in January 2014 with then vice-president Bartomeu taking charge. It is alleged the overall fee was split between a number of different contracts between Barcelona, Santos and Neymar himself. A Brazilian court has also taken action freezing $47 million in assets belonging to Neymar over tax evasion allegations between 2011 and 2013. Neymar's fiscal problems haven't affected his form on the field as he finished third in FIFA's Ballon d'Or for the best player in the world on Monday after helping Barca to win five trophies in 2015. However, it has cast some doubt over his future at the club with his father Neymar Sr saying he would seek tax assurances before signing an extension to his Barcelona deal, which expires in 2018."

According to referee Juan Martinez Munuera's report from the Camp Nou, Suarez had waited for Espanyol players in the tunnel after the match where he repeatedly shouted at them: ""Here I am waiting for you, come here; you are a waste of space."" That provoked a clash between rival players that needed the intervention of stadium security to calm frayed nerves. The match itself had been played in a fiery Camp Nou atmosphere between the local rivals. Espanyol had two players sent off but were lucky to escape further punishment as goalkeeper Pau Lopez's violent stamp on Lionel Messi went unseen. The appeals committee insisted in a statement that Suarez's actions had been ""premeditated"" and that he had ""repeated provocative phrases and offensive terms several times"". Suarez's controversial career has seen him receive four long bans -- three for biting opponents and once for allegedly racially abusing French defender Patrice Evra during his time at Liverpool."

However, Barca will be without the suspended Luis Suarez as he was given a two-match ban for confronting Espanyol players in the tunnel after the game and calling them a ""waste of space"". Espanyol have also been reported to Spain's anti-violence commission by the Spanish league for alleged racist abuse aimed at Brazilian star Neymar during the sides' 0-0 draw in La Liga on January 2. Barca boss Luis Enrique compared Espanyol's roughhouse tactics to playing American football after the first-leg, but will meet with his counterpart Constantin Galca on Tuesday to try and ease tensions between the two clubs. Despite their comfortable lead and a punishing schedule of up to 17 games in January and February, Enrique is expected to start with both Messi and Neymar in attack in Suarez's absence. Javier Mascherano, Dani Alves, Sergio Busquets and Andres Iniesta are also expected to return after being rested for Saturday's 4-0 rout of Granada. La Liga leaders Atletico Madrid have far more work to do to reach the last eight after only managing a 1-1 draw with a much-changed side away to Rayo Vallecano last week. Atletico boss Diego Simeone has made a telling contribution with one of his substitutes scoring in each of the last four games and insisted he won't hold back in rotating his squad once more for the return-leg at the Vicente Calderon on Thursday. ""We are doing things well and that gives us energy to prepare for the game in the Copa del Rey,"" said the Argentine. ""We don't believe we are better or worse than any opponents, but we have a group of 23 players that are prepared to compete at any moment and those that come off the bench are giving us the chance to decide the game.""

1043,11/01/2016,20:00,"Move over Ronaldo, Messi back on top of the world",Lionel Messi deposed eternal rival Cristiano Ronaldo to take back his crown as the undisputed king of world football by lifting a record fifth Ballon d'Or on Monday.,"Much has changed since, just 12 months ago, a disgruntled Messi, fresh from losing a World Cup final and disillusioned with coach Luis Enrique's regime at Barcelona, sat in stony silence as Ronaldo announced his intention to hunt down the Argentine's then-record four Ballon d'Or haul. A year on, the roles were reversed, Messi's record now even further beyond Ronaldo's reach in the personal duel between the two men who have taken standards to unseen heights in their domination of the sport during the past decade. Rarely has there been such little debate over who was the deserving winner. Even in the Spanish capital, unlike in previous years, there was no campaign for Ronaldo in the year he became Real Madrid's all-time leading goalscorer. In Zurich last year, Messi had even cast doubt on his future at Barcelona. His benching for a 1-0 defeat to Real Sociedad the most ignominious start to what would turn out to be the second most successful in Barca's 116-year history. Messi missed an open training session with the club's fans, Barca sporting director Andoni Zubizarreta was sacked and club legend Carles Puyol walked. Enrique would have followed suit had Messi demanded it. Instead, he used the fuel of the most disappointing year of his career in 2014 to fire Barca to a treble of Champions League, La Liga and Copa del Rey trophies. His partnership with Neymar and Luis Suarez suddenly kicked into gear, between them hitting 137 of Barca's record 180 goals in 2015, making the South American trio one of the most frightening frontlines the game has ever seen. Even a two-month injury layoff due to knee ligament damage couldn't derail Messi's case as he also scored in the UEFA Super Cup and Club World Cup finals to take Barca's total trophy haul for the year to five. There was still disappointment at international level. Another final defeat - this time on penalties to Chile at the Copa America - means Messi has still to deliver a major trophy for La Albiceleste. However, whilst others may use his record with Argentina to doubt his candidacy as the best player ever, in Barcelona 2015 enshrined his legacy as the greatest. He scored the goal that sealed a fifth La Liga title in seven years and maybe even his best ever goal in the Copa del Rey final. Yet, his signature moment came with the return of an old mentor in Pep Guardiola when Bayern Munich visited in the Champions League semi-finals in May. Guardiola had made his long-awaited return to the Camp Nou as a fan in the earlier rounds, unable to hide his admiration as Messi's repertoire of outrageous skill tore Manchester City to shreds in the last-16. His first visit as an opposition coach since winning 14 trophies in four years between 2008 and 2012 was seen as a referendum on who had been the inspiration for the most glorious period in Barca's history. Messi won by a landslide. Two magical goals in three minutes at the Camp Nou dealt a killer blow from which Bayern never recovered. ""There is not a system or coach to stop talent of his magnitude,"" said Guardiola. After a two-year spell on top, not even Ronaldo could prevent Messi's march back to being the world's best."

Enrique hasn't travelled to Zurich for Monday's Ballon d'Or gala despite being nominated for coach of the year, and Espanyol confirmed he will meet with Galca on Tuesday afternoon. The Barca boss likened Espanyol's tactics to American football as the visitors had two men sent-off in Barca's 4-1 first-leg win last week. However, the European champions will be without the suspended Luis Suarez as he was given a two-match ban for confronting Espanyol players in the tunnel after the game and calling them a ""waste of space."" Espanyol have also been reported to Spain's anti-violence commission by the Spanish league for alleged racist abuse aimed at Brazilian star Neymar during the sides' 0-0 draw in La Liga on January 2."

""I won't be going,"" the Barca boss announced after Messi's hat-trick-inspired 4-0 drubbing of Granada in La Liga. Enrique, who guided the Catalan giants to five titles in 2015, is on the shortlist for coach of the year along with Guardiola, who is in Qatar at Bayern's winter training camp. The third name in contention for manager of the year is Jorge Sampaoli, the Argentine who masterminded Chile's march to the Copa America title. This is not the first awards ceremony Enrique has failed to attend, he declined an invitation to the Spanish league's end of year honours bash in November where he was named coach of the season. Despite his no-show in Zurich, Enrique used his post-match press conference to push the case for Messi to pick up his fifth Player of the Year honour. ""It is the personality that a world number one has. He is a unique and unrepeatable player."" He added: ""It is evident there is the collective objective that attracts him, motivates him and continues to motivate him year after year and then the particular individual objective these type of players have to continue beating records and continue being the best. ""I have no doubt that it will last as long as Leo Messi wants it too."" Despite being in conflict with FIFA over transfer dealings, Barca will be represented at the function by club president Josep Maria Bartomeu along with Messi and Neymar, who are competing with Real Madrid's Cristiano Ronaldo for the top player title. FIFA on Friday had described Guardiola's absence as ""a great shame""."
1047,08/01/2016,16:33,Suarez banned for two Cup matches over 'waste of space' jibe,"Barcelona striker Luis Suarez was on Friday banned for two Copa del Rey matches after being cited in the referee's report for calling Espanyol players ""a waste of space"" at the end of a heated Catalan derby.","Barcelona said they would appeal the ban, arguing that it was not Suarez who uttered those words. Barca won the first leg of the Copa de Rey last-16 tie between the sides 4-1 on Wednesday as Espanyol had two players sent off and were lucky to escape further punishment as goalkeeper Pau Lopez's violent stamp on Lionel Messi went unseen. Suarez, who was also booked for a clash with Lopez, was punished for sparking a brawl in the tunnel after the game that security personnel had to break up. ""Whilst all the Espanyol players climbed the stairs in the tunnel towards the dressing rooms, he (Suarez) waited for them and confronted them saying on various occasions: ""Here I am waiting for you, come here; you are a waste of space,"" referee Juan Martinez Munuera wrote in his report. ""That provoked a clash between players from both clubs forcing security personnel present and the managerial staff from both teams to intervene."" Suarez's controversial career has seen him receive four long bans -- three for biting opponents and once for allegedly racially abusing French defender Patrice Evra during his time at Liverpool. Yet, the Uruguayan's behaviour since joining Barcelona 18 months ago has been exemplary and the suspension meted out Friday was his first since the four-month ban he received for his latest bite on Giorgio Chiellini at the 2014 World Cup."

Legal action was also requested against the footballer's father, Neymar Sr, as well as the club's former president Sandro Rosell and his successor Josep Maria Bartomeu, and former officials Luis Alvaro de Oliveira and Odilio Rodriguez. An investigation was opened after a complaint of ""fraud"" and ""corruption"" filed by the Brazilian investment fund DIS, which held 40 percent of Neymar's sports rights when he played at Santos. DIS, which had also filed a complaint in Brazil, has claimed it was cheated of its real share of the benefits of 23-year-old Neymar's transfer in 2013, which it insists was minimised by Barca and Santos. The deal was originally valued at 57.1 million euros ($62.1 million) by the Catalan club. But the Spanish judicial authorities have estimated the amount to be at least 83.3 million. A Brazilian court has also taken action freezing $47 million in assets belonging to Neymar over tax evasion allegations between 2011 and 2013."
1049,07/01/2016,20:32,Espanyol reported for racist Neymar chants,The Spanish football league (LFP) announced on Thursday it had reported Espanyol to the country's anti-violence commission for racist chanting aimed at Barcelona star Neymar during the sides' 0-0 draw on Saturday.,"According to the LFP's report, monkey chants were aimed at Neymar after he had been flagged offside in the 14th minute. The anti-violence commission will decide if any action is to be taken against Espanyol with possible sanctions ranging from a fine to part or full closure of their Cornella-El Prat stadium. ""I haven't listened to the chants, I don't listen to things off the field, I just play football,"" Neymar said on Monday. Former Barca presidential candidate Toni Freixa was first to condemn the chanting on Saturday when he posted on his official Twitter account: ""I hope the racist chanting towards Neymar is reflected in the referee's report."" Yet, there was no mention of it in Jose Luis Gonzalez's report and Barca boss Luis Enrique refused to comment on the incident afterwards. Espanyol president Joan Collet claimed the chants recorded were not monkey noises, but chants used most often in recent months by opposition fans to mock Real Madrid's Cristiano Ronaldo's over-effusive celebration at winning last year's Ballon d'Or. ""These chants of 'uh, uh, uh' I hear every Sunday, above all with Cristiano, and they are not interpreted in any way as monkey chanting,"" he told Barcelona daily Sport. ""If it was like that, we would go for those that have to be sanctioned, but it would need to be shown that it was monkey chanting and it wasn't."" The claims are just the latest fallout from two bad-tempered derbies between the sides in the past five days. Espanyol had two men sent off as Barca gained revenge for dropping points at the weekend with a 4-1 win in the first leg of their Copa del Rey last-16 tie on Wednesday. However, Barcelona's Luis Suarez could be handed up to a three-game ban after he was cited in the referee's report for aggressively confronting the Espanyol players in the tunnel after Wednesday's match."

""That provoked a clash between players from both clubs forcing security personnel present and the managerial staff from both teams to intervene."" Espanyol's physical approach had frustrated Barca in an equally fiery clash between the two in La Liga on Saturday which finished 0-0. And Barcelona boss Luis Enrique praised the referee's more strict approach to Espanyol's roughhouse tactics in midweek, comparing the visitors' style to American football. Suarez's controversial career has seen him receive four long bans; three for biting opponents and once for allegedly racially abusing French defender Patrice Evra during his time at Liverpool. Yet, the Uruguayan's behaviour since joining Barcelona 18 months ago has been exemplary and a suspension would be his first since the four-month ban he received for his latest bite on Giorgio Chiellini at the 2014 World Cup."

Messi then teed up Neymar for a stunning fourth to all but seal Barca's place in the quarter-finals ahead of the second leg on January 13. Espanyol's intense approach had worked in frustrating Barca with a 0-0 draw on Saturday. Yet, they lost their discipline completely in the final quarter with goalkeeper Pau Lopez escaping punishment for a blatant stamp on Messi. And there were reports that the players from the two sides even came to blows in the tunnel after the game. ""The referees are the ones to set the limits. They are responsible for ensuring this is football and not American football,"" said Enrique. ""Anything that takes us away from football worries me. All we are looking for is to play. ""When someone goes beyond the limit with their actions, there is a referee there (to act). ""We are teams used to playing in our own way and we have to understand that in a positive light."" Felipe Caicedo had put Espanyol into a shock lead before Messi replied four minutes later. A wonderful Messi free-kick just before half-time put Barca in front before the Argentine provided two fine assists for Gerard Pique and Neymar to put the tie beyond Espanyol's reach. And Pique admitted Messi had been the key to opening up the visitors. ""Derbies are always intense and they have a way of playing on the limit. There are referees that allow it like the other day and referees that don't like today,"" said the Spanish international. ""Their plan is to play very tough and they made sure we didn't have fluidity in our play. ""Leo helped us a lot with the first two goals to open the game up and then we took advantage to create more chances and score the third."" However, Espanyol captain Javi Lopez claimed the negative media attention given to his side after Saturday's stalemate had influenced the referee. ""I like to define us more as an intense team,"" he told Canal Plus. ""We are proud of the team, we are very intense and they lacked respect for us calling us violent. We are hurt with how they have us treated during the week. ""The media campaign we have suffered since the league game has taken effect."""

Espanyol held the European champions 0-0 in a bad-tempered first of three meetings between the sides in 10 days at the weekend and threatened an upset early on through Felipe Caicedo's composed finish. Yet, Messi took just four minutes to restore parity before blasting a stunning free-kick in off the underside of the bar just before half-time. The Argentine teed up Gerard Pique for a third and then Neymar for a sensational volleyed finish two minutes from time to hand Barca a commanding advantage ahead of the second leg on January 13. However, Messi was lucky to escape without being seriously injured after being violently stamped on by Espanyol goalkeeper Pau Lopez without any action taken by the officials before Hernan Perez and Papakouli Diop were dismissed. ""The referees are the ones to set the limits. They are responsible for ensuring this is football and not American football,"" said Barca boss Luis Enrique of Espanyol's roughhouse tactics. Arda Turan was handed his Barca debut after joining from Atletico Madrid in July as the Catalans' year-long ban on registering new players came to an end on Monday. Yet, Barca were stunned on nine minutes when on-loan Real Madrid midfielder Marco Asensio robbed Dani Alves and played in Caicedo to slot home. A wonderful through ball from Andres Iniesta ensured the lead was short-lived as Messi fired past Lopez. And there was little the 'keeper could do to stop a bullet of a free-kick from fully 30 yards. Brilliant passes from Iniesta and Messi then teed up Pique for an easy finish to all but kill the tie off. Espanyol lost their cool in the final quarter as Lopez somehow escaped with a blatant stamp on Messi inside the area before Perez and Diop were sent-off in a four-minute spell. And Neymar finally made the visitors pay when he volleyed home first time from Messi's scooped pass. Elsewhere, an under-strength Atletico were also forced to come from behind due to a thundering strike from Rayo left-back Nacho at Vallecas. However, for the third consecutive game, Diego Simeone's substitutes made a big impact as Luciano Vietto crossed for Saul Niguez to slot home a vital away goal. Alvaro Negredo scored a hat-trick as Gary Neville enjoyed just his second win in seven games in charge of Valencia with a 4-0 thrashing of Granada. ""We are going in the right direction,"" said Neville. ""We are better physically, in our play and our confidence, but obviously we have a long way to go and we can't get carried away with just one win."" Athletic Bilbao produced a stirring second-half comeback from 2-0 down to take a 3-2 lead into the second leg of their last-16 tie against Villarreal. Sevilla took control of their tie in the first of three derbies on Wednesday as goals either side of half-time from Michael Krohn-Dehli and Grzegorz Krychowiak handed them a 2-0 win at Real Betis. And Mirandes, one of only two sides from outside the top flight left in the competition, maintained their hopes of reaching the last eight as Alberto Lopo's late equaliser rescued a 1-1 draw for Deportivo la Coruna."

Luis Enrique's men claimed five trophies in all, including a treble of La Liga, Champions League and Copa del Rey. However, having drawn three of their last four La Liga games to fall two points behind Atletico Madrid at the top of the table, Vidal and Turan are expected to add some much needed depth to the squad for a potential run of 16 games before the end of February. ""Finally, the sanction has ended,"" Vidal, who joined from Sevilla in June for a reported 20 million euro ($21.7 million) fee, told Barca TV. And Vidal could make his debut against another of his former clubs Espanyol in the Copa del Rey on Wednesday. ""I don't know when I will be able to play my first minutes, but the boss knows we have been training for months to be in prime condition when he needs us."""

""It is difficult when a team plays on the limit in terms of intensity. It was the kind of game we expected and they pressed very well, especially at the start of the game,"" said Enrique. ""We started very well in the second-half when we played at a different tempo. We created chances and on these type of days when you are finding it more difficult you can't afford to miss them."" Defending champions Barca play host in the first of two legs between the sides in the last 16 of the Cup on Wednesday. ""Of course it conditions (the upcoming games). At the Camp Nou we are going to try and play at the same intensity and overcome them,"" he added. ""It is an attractive game and we are playing against a side that did very well today."" A first point in eight matches against Barca was further evidence of Espanyol's upturn in fortunes since Constantin Galca replaced Sergio Gonzalez as head coach last month. The Romanian hailed the effort of his players, but is confident they will be fresh enough from Spanish football's curtailed 10-day winter break to show the same energy levels again on Wednesday. ""Barcelona had some clear chances, they started very well in the first 20 minutes of the second-half, but we stayed together and played to our strengths,"" he said. ""Physically they ran a lot, but they are professionals. They will recover and be ready for the next game."""

The Catalans lead Atletico Madrid on goal difference and Real Madrid by two points as well as having a game in hand on their rivals from the Spanish capital. And having won the Champions League, La Liga, Copa del Rey, UEFA Super Cup and the Club World Cup in the past 12 months, Barca also set a new record of 180 goals in a calendar year. ""It has been a spectacular year and we wanted to finish it this way,"" said Messi. ""It will be difficult to improve on what we have done, but we always try. We have a great squad that are desperate to continue winning."" Barca were given a helping hand on their return to action after a shorter than normal 10-day winter break in Spain, though, as they were awarded a controversial penalty when Antonio Adan clashed with Messi after punching the ball to safety. Neymar's resulting spot-kick came off the bar, but Heiko Westermann turned the ball into his own net from the rebound and thereafter Barca were only denied an even greater rout by a series of fine saves by Adan and the woodwork. A lovely one-two between Neymar and Messi allowed the later to slot home his 425th Barca goal before a Luis Suarez double rounded off the scoring in the second-half. ""We just came back from the holidays so it is normal that the rhythm dips a bit and the games at the Club World Cup always take their toll,"" added Messi. ""Possibly it wasn't a great game, but we managed to do the most important thing which was to win and start another important period well."" And Barca boss Luis Enrique echoed the sentiments of his star player as he focused on starting the new year with victory away to Espanyol in the Barcelona derby on Saturday. ""Firstly, I have to congratulate the players and the fans that get to enjoy this unique team,"" he said of Barca's achievements in his first full year in charge. ""The objective is to win again, to win the first game in 2016 and again be challenging to win titles throughout the season for this team, the fans and the club.

However, it was the prolific Suarez who stole the show with a second-half double, collecting the player of the tournament and golden boot awards after scoring five goals in two games in Japan. Suarez, who bagged a hat-trick in Barca's 3-0 semi-final win over Guangzhou Evergrande, has struck 24 goals in 24 games this season, including 17 in his last 11. But the former Liverpool striker is content to let Messi and Neymar, who returned from a groin strain to start against River, take the plaudits.

Astonishingly, Messi (47), Suarez (46) and Neymar (41) have plundered 134 goals in 2015 -- more than Real Madrid. ""Messi could barely stand up a few days ago,"" said Barcelona coach Luis Enrique. ""But he was desperate to play. He is a leader, our reference point. ""But the players with most weight in the dressing room are the first to show their desire,"" Enrique added. ""That determination rubs off on the rest of the team."" Barcelona fly back to Spain on Monday still top of La Liga, level on points with Atletico Madrid and two points clear of bitter rivals Real, who pulverised Rayo Vallecano 10-2 at the weekend, and with a game in hand. And Enrique insisted Barcelona, who have collected the European Champions League, La Liga, the Copa del Rey and European Super Cup this year, will hit the ground running. ""Clearly it does get more and more difficult to win trophies,"" he said. ""But if these players have shown anything it is their hunger to do just that."" European teams have won the Club World Cup eight times in the 12 years it has been played, underlining a gulf in class partly explained by the fact that six of Barca's starting 11 on Sunday were South Americans. River coach Marcelo Gallardo sighed: ""We had a game plan. When Messi scored, it went out of the window."""
1061,20/12/2015,13:46,Barca beat River Plate 3-0 to win Club World Cup,Lionel Messi marked his return from illness with a brilliant goal as Barcelona beat Argentina's River Plate 3-0 to capture a record third Club World Cup on Sunday.,"The Spanish giants welcomed back Messi after a bout of kidney stones and the mercurial Argentine scored with a clinical finish on 36 minutes, before a lethal Luis Suarez double destroyed River's hopes. ""We came here to win the title and it was important to get the job done,"" said Suarez. ""We stayed calm and played our game until Leo scored the first goal. More than my goals, it was just important to get our hands on the trophy."" Neymar, himself returning to the side after a groin strain, was instrumental in Barcelona's opener, climbing to knock down a Dani Alves cross for Messi to steer past River goalkeeper Marcelo Barovero with a deft flick of his left boot. Suarez, who scored a hat-trick in Barca's 3-0 semi-final win over Guangzhou Evergrande, scored a second with a fierce low drive four minutes into the second half. The former Liverpool striker grabbed his fifth goal in Japan when he guided a thumping header past a beleaguered Barovero after a pinpoint cross from Neymar. Barca goalkeeper Claudio Bravo was a spectator for much of the game on a cold night. But the Chilean made an acrobatic save from a shot by River substitute Gonzalo Martinez seven minutes from time to deny the South Americans a consolation goal. Messi, who forced a smart save from Barovero in the early skirmishes and could himself have finished with a hat-trick, became the first player to score in three finals after leading Barca to victory in 2009 and 2011. ""Messi and Neymar wanted to play in the final, no matter what,"" said Suarez. ""It shows the sacrifice that there is in the group that they did everything to play."" Barcelona added the world title to a host of other titles they have collected this year -- the Champions League, Spain's La Liga, the Copa del Rey and the European Super Cup."

The European champions were rocked before the semi-final when Messi was forced out with abdominal pain from renal colic, commonly caused by kidney stones, which could also rule him out of the final. Barca missed Messi's wizardry and the talents of his Brazilian strike partner Neymar, who was rested as he recovers from a groin strain. They toiled to break down Evergrande's massed ranks of defenders until Suarez pounced six minutes before half-time, poking in the loose ball after goalkeeper Li Shuai parried Ivan Rakitic's drive from the edge of the box. The Uruguayan grabbed his second five minutes after the break when he latched onto a clever Andres Iniesta pass, bringing the ball down on his chest before volleying past Li to the delight of most in the crowd of 63,000. Suarez completed his treble from the penalty spot in the 67th minute, his 21st goal of the season."
1063,17/12/2015,11:13,Messi misses Club World Cup semi with renal colic,"Barcelona forward Lionel Messi will miss Thursday's Club World Cup semi-final against China's Guangzhou Evergrande in Yokohama because of abdominal pain, the Spanish club said.","The Argentine wizard, who returned last month after a lengthy knee injury, is suffering from renal colic, a problem commonly caused by kidney stones. ""His future availability will depend on the outcome of further medical tests,"" said a statement on Barcelona's website. Messi had appeared in good spirits since Barca arrived in Japan on Monday, joking with team-mates and signing autographs for local fans who turned out in their hundreds to watch their idols train. Brazilian striker Neymar, who has been in a rich vein of form this season, will also miss the game as he recovers from a groin strain suffered in Barca's European Champions League clash at Bayer Leverkusen earlier this month. Luis Suarez, the third member of Barcelona's vaunted strike-force, starts. European champions Barcelona are attempting to become the first side to win the Club World Cup three times. The Catalan giants beat Argentina's 2-1 in 2009 and thrashed Brazil's Santos 4-0 two years later."
1064,16/12/2015,16:03,"Barca's Montoya free to go, says Mancini","On-loan Barcelona defender Martin Montoya is free to leave Inter Milan but the Nerazzurri won't be making any new signings in January, coach Roberto Mancini said.","Montoya admitted his reluctance at joining Inter on a two-year loan deal in July, when he said he was ""sad to be leaving"" the Spanish giants after it became clear his first-team opportunities would be limited. And six months on, the Barca right-back is stuck in an impasse. The 24-year-old had hoped to relaunch his career but has made only two appearances for the Nerazzurri so far. Having made his only other appearance in a pre-season defeat to Sassuolo, Montoya played on Tuesday as Inter secured their place in the Italian Cup quarter-finals with a 3-0 win over Cagliari at the San Siro. Asked about the player's future at the club, Mancini said: ""I don't know if Montoya will leave in January. He's played and shown he can do the job. ""Things can change very quickly in football. He's a good footballer and a good lad. It's up to him if he wants to accept this situation or look somewhere else where he might play more regularly."" Inter are top of Serie A with a four-point lead over Fiorentina and Napoli, while champions Juventus and Roma are six and seven points adrift respectively. Juve's four-year grip on the league title is under threat this season, but Mancini has ruled out recuiting during the January transfer window. ""The squad is complete,"" added the Italian, who won seven titles including three consecutive league trophies in his previous spell in charge at the club from 2004 to 2008. ""I don't think we need to do anything but we do need to consider if there are players who want to move on so they can play more. ""At the moment there's a very good balance within the squad."" Inter host Lazio, who are 16 points off the pace in 12th, in their final league game of the year on Sunday."
1065,15/12/2015,07:14,"Barca's style has evolved, says Messi",Lionel Messi believes the current Barcelona side has more weapons than Pep Guardiola's 2009 world-beaters and wants to prove it by winning a record third Club World Cup.,"The Spanish giants, who have captured the Champions League, Spain's La Liga, the Copa del Rey and European Super Cup this year, take on China's Guangzhou Evergrande Thursday for a place in the tournament final in Yokohama on December 20. ""It's one of my favourite competitions,"" said Messi, favourite to win his fifth Ballon d'Or in January. ""It gives you the opportunity to round off the year in the best possible way. These titles are an indelible legacy in the history of the club. It's something very important. ""It's been an amazing year,"" the Argentina wizard told fifa.com in the build-up to Barca's clash against Luiz Felipe Scolari's Guangzhou. ""That time when we won everything under Guardiola looked unrepeatable. We genuinely weren't sure if we'd get close to that again. (But) here we are. Now what's left for us to do is end the year in the best possible way and make it unforgettable."" Barring an upset in Wednesday's first semi-final between Libertadores Cup holders River Plate and Japan's Sanfrecce Hiroshima, Messi will come face to face with the side which almost signed him as a teenager in his native Argentina. Remarkably, Messi has only once previously played against an Argentine club, when Barcelona beat Estudiantes 2-1 in the 2009 Club World Cup final. Two years later, Barca smashed four past Brazil's Santos, which featured current team-mate Neymar. ""I've witnessed (Neymar's) enormous growth, both as a footballer and as a person,"" said Messi. ""Back then he was already a great player and now he's much more complete. It's a pleasure and a privilege to have him alongside us."" Messi gave an insight into how the Spanish league leaders have evolved under Luis Enrique, who relies less on the ""tiki-taka"" style of short, intricate passes than Guardiola. ""We've changed a little bit,"" admitted Messi. ""We've become a more vertical (direct) team. Of course, we've not lost our ideology of keeping hold of the ball. ""That's our trademark and our priority: to control the play and keep possession. But now we've incorporated the idea that, with just a couple of touches, we can get in front of the opposition's goal. Before it was about getting there using more elaborate build-up play."" The addition of former Liverpool striker Luis Suarez, with his ability to play off the shoulder of the last defender, has undoubtedly given Barca more thrust. Messi, Neymar and Suarez have plundered a jaw-dropping 127 goals for Barca in 2015 -- more than Spanish rivals Real Madrid -- although Neymar is a doubt in Japan with a groin strain. Messi insisted that his game had changed too. ""As time passes you grow, both on and off the pitch,"" he said. ""You go about adapting to different circumstances. Although I've kept the essence (of my play style), over the years I've added qualities to my game."""
1066,15/12/2015,02:02,Messi inspires Barcelona's reign in Spain in 2015,"Barcelona turned around a terrible start to 2015 to end the year as the undisputed kings of Spanish football once more having sealed a second treble of La Liga, Copa del Rey and Champions League in just six years.","The Catalans lost their first game of the year to former Manchester United manager David Moyes's Real Sociedad, sparking an internal crisis at the club. Star player Lionel Messi refused to attend a training session with the club's fans, whilst sporting director Andoni Zubizarreta was sacked and his assistant and club legend Carles Puyol resigned in support. Coach Luis Enrique's job was even thought to be on the line, but Messi's relationship with Luis Suarez and Neymar blossomed in a period of 20 wins in 21 matches that took Barca to the brink of matching the most glorious season in their 116-year history under Pep Guardiola in 2008/09. Messi trumped Guardiola on his first return home as an opposing coach as the Argentine scored twice and set up Neymar for a third as Barca decisively won the first leg of their Champions League semi-final against Bayern Munich 3-0 before progressing to the final 5-3 on aggregate. A fifth La Liga title in seven years was swiftly sealed thanks to Messi's winner at Atletico Madrid as a hitherto rampant Real Madrid floundered in the spring, albeit the final advantage was a mere two points. More Messi magic delivered the Copa del Rey two weeks later. The four-time World Player of the Year scoring one of his most memorable ever goals as he somehow escaped the attentions of four Athletic Bilbao defenders to open the scoring in a 3-1 win. Seven days later in Berlin, Messi wasn't on the scoresheet, but it mattered little as Barca saw off Juventus by the same scoreline to seal the treble and a fifth European Cup. Suarez and Neymar netted the decisive goals against the Italian champions to take the trio's tally for the season to a barely believable 122. In Spain, Madrid and Barca are a seesaw. When one is up the other is inevitably down and so it proved as just a year after delivering the club's treasured 10th European Cup, Carlo Ancelotti was sacked as Madrid boss for not delivering a major trophy. The decision by president Florentino Perez wasn't a popular one amongst the players and fans and even less so when former Madrid youth team coach Rafael Benitez was wheeled out as the Italian's replacement. Benitez has been unable to halt Madrid's annus horribilis, but the blame for the majority of the club's ills lies above his head. A humiliating 4-0 defeat at home to a Barca side shorn of Messi for an hour in November saw calls for his sacking, which until now Perez has resisted. Indeed, the biggest embarrassment for Madrid came off the field. The richest club in the world were thrown out of the Copa del Rey this month for fielding an ineligible player. Outside the Barca-Madrid duopoly, Atletico Madrid remained the best of the rest with an impressive core of young players that could fight for honours in 2016. Sevilla confirmed Spanish dominance of European football with their fourth Europa League title in 10 years. Despite starting the year by beating Barca, it wasn't to be for Moyes at Sociedad as he too was sacked after an ultimately fruitless year in San Sebastian. But as one door closed, another opened for a British coach abroad as Gary Neville was surprisingly named Valencia boss for the rest of this season in December."
1067,14/12/2015,16:09,Friendly fraud case against Messi shelved,Barcelona star Lionel Messi has avoided another embarrassing court case for tax fraud after he and his foundation were cleared of allegations relating to charitable friendlies played in 2012 and 2013 on Monday.,"Messi is already facing a seperate tax fraud charge along with his father for allegedly failing to declare 4.16 million euros ($4.69 million) in taxes related to his image rights between 2007 and 2009. The four-time World Player of the Year was being investigated to see if Messi had failed to declare to the tax man any revenue made from taking part in a series of friendlies in Mexico, Colombia, the United States and Peru. However, after hearing testimony from the Argentine businessman, Guillermo Javier Marin, who organised the matches, the judge dismissed the case. ""There is no indication (of tax fraud) or documentation of its possible existence that would support the continuation of the investigation,"" a court filing said. Marin said he never paid Messi to take part in the games, but rather compensated his presence by picking up the bill for hotel stays and first class flights for Messi and his family for the matches in question."
1068,14/12/2015,14:34,Barcelona look to twist knife in Japan,Barcelona were mobbed by Japanese fans on Monday after holding their first training session at the Club World Cup.,"The European champions, bidding to become the first team to win the competition three times, held a gentle run-out in Yokohama after being greeted like rock stars on their arrival in Japan earlier in the day. Brazilian star Neymar, who is struggling with a groin strain, sat out the practice but his strike partners Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez appeared in a relaxed mood as they prepared for Thursday's semi-final against Chinese side Guangzhou Evergrande. ""Obviously Guangzhou have proved they are a strong team,"" Barca midfielder Sergio Busquets told reporters. ""We know they have a good mix of decent players, including some Brazilians, and we won't be taking the game lightly. Hopefully we can play our style of football because we have come to Japan to win the title again."" He added: ""The main thing is dealing with the jet-lag and making sure we are properly prepared and ready to go, but we know it won't be easy."" Barca players posed briefly for photos and signed autographs for fans, with Messi and Andres Iniesta drawing their loudest cheers from a crowd of around 200 mostly local fans. Despite drawing their last three games, two in La Liga bookending a 1-1 deadlock at Bayer Leverkusen in the Champions League, Barca's spirits will have been lifted after Real Madrid suffered a shock 1-0 defeat by Villarreal on Sunday. That result leaves Real five points adrift of Barcelona at the top of the league, providing the Catalan giants with a tonic after flying 6,600 miles (10,700km) to play in the Far East. And Barcelona, who thrashed Real 4-0 at the Bernabeu in the ""Clasico"" last month, can twist the knife by winning the world title their fierce rivals captured in Morocco last year. If there was any schadenfreude at Real's troubles among the Barca players, however, Busquets did a good job concealing it. ""La Liga is a completely different competition,"" he shrugged. ""We are here for the Club World Cup and it's very important to us. It would be another title, and that's the goal: to keep winning as many titles for Barca as we can."" Barring an upset, Argentina's River Plate will await the European champions in the final in Yokohama on December 20. But the South Americans first have to beat J-League title holders Sanfrecce Hiroshima in Wednesday's first semi-final in Osaka. Barcelona, who were held to a 2-2 draw by Deportivo La Coruna before flying out to Japan, must overcome a dogged Guangzhou side led by former Brazil coach Luiz Felipe Scolari and packing an attacking threat in the Brazilian pair Robinho and Paulinho. The Asian champions beat Mexico's Club America 2-1 at the weekend to earn a shot at Barca. ""We only caught the start of the game before boarding the plane,"" said Busquets. ""But the Chinese team made the semi-finals so they can be dangerous if we don't play our best."""

Walking alongside Suarez, Messi smiled at fans as cameras flashed, while Neymar, who is an injury concern for the tournament favourites, sported a baseball cap, sunglasses and earphones. Barcelona, bidding to become the first team to win the Club World Cup three times after lifting the trophy in 2009 and 2011, take on China's Guangzhou Evergrande in the semi-finals on Thursday. But Barca coach Luis Enrique is sweating over the fitness of Neymar, who is struggling with a groin strain. The Brazilian has scored 16 times in 18 appearances this season, but Enrique could opt to rest him in Japan. Barring an upset, Argentina's River Plate will await the European champions in the final in Yokohama on December 20. European teams have won the title seven times of the 11 years the competition has been played under the current seven-team format."
1070,12/12/2015,20:18,Barca punished for unusual errors,Barcelona boss Luis Enrique insisted his side must learn from their mistakes after they threw away a lead for the third time in a week to draw 2-2 at home to Deportivo la Coruna.,"The European champions looked well on course to sign off from La Liga before travelling to Japan for the Club World Cup next week with a victory thanks to stunning strikes either side of half-time by Lionel Messi and Ivan Rakitic. However, just as away to Valencia and Bayer Leverkusen in the past week, they let two points slip away as goals from Lucas Perez and Alex Bergantinos in the final 13 minutes handed Deportivo a share of the spoils. ""The game was completely controlled until 15-20 minutes to go when they scored a disallowed goal. From then on we started to commit individual errors and gave the ball away stupidly,"" said Enrique. ""Deportivo were lucky, Barcelona dominated the game and they have taken a point, which from watching the game I thought was unfair. ""Obviously it is not the result we deserved, but it shows we need to remain alert during 90 minutes. At 2-0 the game is not dead, today is a clear example of that."" Enrique also took responsiblity for his side's collapse in the final quarter as it coincided with his three substitutions as he withdrew Rakitic and Jordi Alba to reserve them for the upcoming demanding trip to Japan. ""Perhaps I expected something different from the changes and I hold my hands up. What happened came about after the changes and that is the responsiblity of the coach,"" he added. Despite scoring twice, Barca clearly missed the presence of the injured Neymar against a well-organised Deportivo defence. The Brazilian suffered a groin injury in training ahead of Barca's Champions League clash against Leverkusen on Tuesday, but has been included in Enrique's 23-man squad to travel to Japan. And the Barca boss is hopeful his side's latest setback will ensure there is no complacency when they face Mexico's Club America or Guangzhou Evergrande of China in the Club World Cup semi-finals on Thursday. ""We have to lift ourselves and think about what is to come which is very attractive tournament that will also be very difficult. We need to win our semi-final before we can think about the final. ""In the course of the season these accidents happen and it is a lesson from which we have to learn. Without a doubt it will help us to improve."""
1071,11/12/2015,14:03,Barcelona aim for one billion euro goal,"Barcelona are aiming to become the world's highest earning club in the next six years and are determined to counter England's Premier League, club president Josep Maria Bartomeu said in an interview published Friday.","The Spanish giants will make about 600 million euros ($658 million) this year but Bartomeu told the Financial Times newspaper he was aiming to lift this to one billion euros ($1.1 billion) by 2021. ""We want to be the first club to reach one billion euros in revenues,"" said Bartomeu, who won an election for a six-year term in July after Barcelona overcame team divisions to win the Champions League. A Deloitte survey said that Real Madrid (549 million euros) and Manchester United (518 million) were the of top world football revenue earners in 2014. The president said he wants to increase Barcelona's presence abroad and embark on a 600 million euro renovation of the 93,000 capacity Camp Nou stadium. It has one overseas office in Hong Kong and plans to open more in New York, Sao Paulo and Shanghai by 2017, Bartomeu said. Barcelona, which is owned by its 145,00 members, also wants to set up its own university and move into women's sports. But the Barcelona boss acknowledged that the shadow of England's Premier League hangs over his club's plans. ""Our rival is the Premier League. It is not a specific club, it is the strength of the Premier League itself,"" Bartomeu said. He insisted that Barcelona has the financial power to hold off any English challenge for its three top stars Lionel Messi, Neymar and Luis Suarez. But Bartomeu said Barcelona academy teenagers were being lured by big money English offers. ""The 16-year-olds constantly receive offers from the Premier League that are very tempting. Every year there are some who go,"" the Barcelona chief said."

Messi also missed training on Thursday due to personal reasons and was seen heavily stretching his hamstring towards the end of a depleted Barca side's 1-1 against Bayer Leverkusen on Wednesday, but is expected to be fit to start. Luis Suarez was left on the bench for the trip to Germany as the holders had already qualified for the last 16 of the Champions League, and will return seeking to score for his ninth consecutive game. Barca were left to rue a host of missed chances last weekend as they conceded late to draw 1-1 at Valencia and allow Atletico Madrid to cut the gap at the top to two points with Real Madrid two points further adrift. And they face another stiff test at the Camp Nou against a revitalised Deportivo la Coruna side that are enjoying a return to their glory days after a number of seasons bouncing between the top-flight and the second division. Lucas Perez's 10 goals have propelled the Galicians up to sixth in the table and he is happy for Barca to be distracted by their upcoming trip to Japan. ""It seems like Barca will be without Neymar which benefits us. If Messi, Suarez and (Andres) Iniesta also want to stay at home and save themselves for the Club World Cup, we'd accept it,"" said Perez. ""We are going there to compete. They drew in their last match, but they are playing great football and are in their best form with the return of Messi."" In contrast to Barca's injury problems, Real Madrid coach Rafael Benitez finally has a fully-fit squad to choose from as he is expected to welcome back Sergio Ramos and Marcelo for Sunday's demanding trip to fifth-placed Villarreal. Madrid's problems off the field have continued this week as the club's appeal against their expulsion from the Copa del Rey was turned down and star striker Karim Benzema suspended from playing for France due to his alleged part in a blackmail scandal. However, on it they are fine form having smashed Malmo 8-0 to equal the biggest ever margin of victory in the Champions League on Tuesday with Cristiano Ronaldo scoring four and Benzema hitting his first hat-trick in five years. That win was Madrid's fifth in a row since being humiliated 4-0 at home by Barcelona last month and Ronaldo believes they are on the right track. ""It is normal at a club like Real Madrid when things don't go well everyone is critical,"" said the World Player of the Year. ""We are used to that, but little-by-little we are improving, the team is better and more confident. Five consecutive victories, we are on a good run and we need to continue like this."" Barca's brilliance and the madness at Real Madrid in recent weeks has taken the attention away from Atletico Madrid. However, Diego Simeone's men can be top of the league at Christmas should they win their next two league games due to Barca's Club World Cup commitments next weekend. Atletico face a tough test themselves at home to Athletic Bilbao on Sunday, though, as Europe's best defence faces up to the triple threat of Aritz Aduriz, Inaki Williams and Atletico old boy Raul Garcia, who have already combined for 30 goals this season. Meanwhile, after a disappointing start to his managerial career as Valencia crashed out of the Champions League in midweek, Gary Neville gets his first taste of La Liga action as Los Che travel to Eibar.

""Tests conducted this morning by FC Barcelona medical staff confirmed that Neymar Jr has a small tear in the adductor muscle of his left leg,"" the club said. ""The evolution of the tear will determine his availability for the next matches,"" added the statement without giving details. Neymar pulled up in training on Tuesday and missed Wednesday's 1-1 draw with Bayer Leverkusen in Barcelona's final Champions League group game. Barcelona travel to Japan for the World Club Cup after playing Deportivo La Coruna this weekend. Their first game is in the semi-final on Thursday. Catalan daily Mundo Deportivo said Barcelona hope Neymar will be fit again for the final in Yokohama on December 20."
1074,09/12/2015,23:57,Barca's Enrique left fretting over Neymar injury,Barcelona coach Luis Enrique is concerned Neymar may be set for a lengthy lay-off after the Brazilian superstar injured his groin before their final Champions League group match.,"The defending champions were already through to the Champions League's last 16 for the 12th year in succession and ended their group campaign on Wednesday with a 1-1 draw at Bayer Leverkusen. Enrique named a mainly second-string team at the BayArena by including only four first-choice players in Marc-Andre ter Stegen, Ivan Rakitic, Jordi Alba and captain Lionel Messi. An early Messi goal was cancelled out by Javier Hernandez's equaliser, but despite the result, the Germans were eliminated. With Roma drawing 0-0 at home to BATE Borisov, Leverkusen had to beat Barcelona to progress but the Germans blew their chance and instead will find themselves in the Europa League next February. Enrique's main concern was Neymar's adductor injury in the final training session in Germany on Tuesday. The 23-year-old has been in sensational form this season, scoring 16 goals in 18 appearances and crowned La Liga's player of the month for November on the day of his injury. ""It's of course, the bad news from this fixture. It's an unpleasant situation and we have to wait to see what the team doctor says,"" said Enrique on Neymar's injury. ""We don't know how bad the injury is and we have to hope he recovers quickly in the next few days. ""It's always unpleasant to lose a player through an injury, possibly long term, and we have to hope it's not as bad as feared."" Enrique said he had a ""positive feeling"" from the way his experimental side coped with a torrent of Leverkusen chances as the Germans peppered the Barca goal with 25 shots compared to the Spaniards' six. Cameroon teenager Wilfrid Kaptoum made his Champions League debut and midfielder Sergi Samper made only his third appearance at this level. First-choice Spain internationals Andres Iniesta and Gerard Pique were left in Barcelona while Dani Alves was suspended and Luis Suarez spent the game on the bench. The team selection was understandable as Barcelona have a busy spell coming up and the Catalans play their Club World Cup semi-final in Japan on December 17. ""I felt positive about our performance,"" said Enrique, with his side already through as Group E winners. ""I wanted to give the players who have played the most minutes a rest and I saw good signs from us against a team that really had to win. The game was a litmus test for us. ""In the last 16, we'll face whoever we're lucky enough to be drawn with."" Leverkusen coach Roger Schmidt struggled to contain his emotions as his side squandered numerous chances to reach the last 16 for the third successive year. ""I can't believe that we didn't win, I'm very disappointed, and the fact that Roma didn't beat BATE makes it a tragedy,"" said Schmidt. ""We had the chances, we just didn't use them."""
1075,09/12/2015,23:05,Leverkusen exit despite holding weakened Barca,"Bayer Leverkusen bowed out of the Champions League on Wednesday despite holding a weakened Barcelona side, led by goal-scorer Lionel Messi, to a 1-1 draw.","The Argentinian superstar gave Barca the lead at the BayArena with a trademark early goal which was cancelled out by Javier Hernandez's 14th for Leverkusen in all competitions this season. Despite the result, this was a game the Germans controlled as they peppered the Spaniards' goal. With Roma drawing 0-0 at home to BATE Borisov, Leverkusen had to beat Barcelona to progress but the Germans will instead find themselves in the Europa League come February as the Spaniards went through to the knock-out stages for the 12th year in succession. With the defending champions already through as Group E winners, ahead of Roma, Barcelona coach Luis Enrique started just four of the side which beat Juventus 3-1 in last season's final in Berlin last June. Goalkeeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen, Ivan Rakitic, Jordi Alba and captain Messi were the quartet. Cameroon teenager Wilfrid Kaptoum made his Champions League debut and midfielder Sergi Samper made only his third appearance at this level in an experimental side. First-choice Spain internationals Andres Iniesta and Gerard Pique were left in Barcelona while Dani Alves was suspended. Brazil superstar Neymar injured his groin in training on Tuesday and Luis Suarez spent the game on the bench. The team selection was understandable as Barcelona have a busy spell coming up and the Catalans play their Club World Cup semi-final in Japan on December 17. Despite Enrique's weakened line-up, Leverkusen failed in their bid to beat the Spanish giants despite having 25 shots on goal compared to the Spaniards' six. This was their seventh straight defeat to Barca, who took the lead when Rakitic's through ball caught the Leverkusen defence napping and gave Messi a one-on-one with Bernd Leno. Barca's superstar calmly rounded Leverkusen's goalkeeper and slotted home with a trademark finish on 20 minutes. Having been unlucky to lose 2-1 at the Camp Nou in September, Leverkusen did not panic at the BayArena and drew level when Hernandez claimed his 12th goal in Leverkusen's last 11 games. Swiss winger Admir Mehmedi put in a low cross, which Hakan Calhanoglu left for the Mexican striker and Hernandez crashed his shot past Ter Stegen with his left foot on 24 minutes. It was 1-1 at the break, but Calhanoglu missed a golden chance in the opening minutes of the second-half to put the hosts ahead. Hernandez lobbed pass put him one-on-one with Ter Stegen, but Calhanoglu fired across the face of the Barca goal. With an hour gone, Karim Bellarabi squandered a half-chance when he fired at Ter Stegen after getting in behind the defence. With ten minutes left another deft through ball from Rakitic released Sergio Ramirez for a rare Barcelona attack, but the Spain Under-21 winger's cross was pounced on by Leno as it finished level."
1076,09/12/2015,05:03,River face Barca deluge at Club World Cup,Barcelona contest the Club World Cup in Japan boasting arguably the most devastating strike-force the game has seen and as red-hot favourites to lift the trophy for a third time.,"Barring any shocks, Argentina's River Plate will await the European champions in the final in Yokohama on December 20. But 'Los Millonarios' face an almost impossible task in stopping Lionel Messi, Neymar and Luis Suarez, who have plundered a jaw-dropping 126 goals for Barca in 2015 -- more than Spanish rivals Real Madrid. River touched down in Japan on Tuesday following a 30-hour journey after thousands of fans had lined the streets to see them off in Buenos Aires. ""It was unique,"" said midfielder Carlos Sanchez. ""It's great to see the fans so excited. It really moves you. We've got a big responsibility,"" added Sanchez. ""It's a dream to play against a team as great as Barcelona,"" said midfielder Matias Kranevitter, who is poised to join Atletico Madrid in January. ""I have always dreamed of winning this competition in a River Plate shirt."" Barcelona, who have captured the Champions League, Spain's La Liga, the Copa del Rey and European Super Cup this year, first have to negotiate a semi-final against either Mexico's Club America or Luiz Felipe Scolari's Guangzhou Evergrande, the Asian champions. River Plate, holders of the South American Libertadores Cup, face either Congolese side Mazembe -- surprise finalists five years ago -- or the winners of Thursday's opening game between newly crowned J-League champions Sanfrecce Hiroshima and Auckland City. Barca have won the Club World Cup twice since the revamped FIFA format was launched in 2000, beating Argentina's Estudiantes 2-1 in 2009 and thrashing Brazil's Santos 4-0 two years later. European teams have won the title seven times of the 11 years the competition has been played. ""We are flying to Japan with the aim of delivering two strong performances and returning home as champions,"" said Barca's Javier Mascherano, who began his career with River Plate in Buenos Aires. ""But we have got to win our semi-final first. It's a very important tournament for us."" The arrival of Barca's superstars is set to trigger wild scenes in celebrity-obsessed Japan, where superstars such as David Beckham and Cristiano Ronaldo have been mobbed in the past. Barca fly to Japan after taking on Deportivo La Coruna at the Nou Camp at the weekend, while River Plate's club season has ended, giving coach Marcelo Gallardo extra time to devise a plan to prevent Messi, Suarez and Neymar from running riot. Their task may be eased as Neymar -- who has scored 16 times in 18 appearanced this season -- could be ruled out after limping away from training for Barca's European Champions League clash at Bayer Leverkusen on Wednesday with what was described as ""a small"" muscle strain. Last year's final also pitted teams from Spain and Argentina with Real Madrid beating San Lorenzo 2-0 in a match marred by some industrial tactics from the South Americans. Estudiantes took Barca to extra time in 2009 but Suarez has added a new dimension to the Catalan giants, giving them a more direct option with his darting runs opening up space for Neymar and Messi. River possess a threat of their own in striker Lucas Alario, but faced by Barca's wizardry he could be forced to plough a lonely furrow on what is likely to be a long, chilly evening in Yokohama, where gloves and stockings will be in order."
1077,08/12/2015,21:20,Barca star Neymar suffers leg injury,European champions Barcelona suffered an injury blow on Tuesday as Brazil star Neymar limped out of training ahead of his side's Champions League clash at Bayer Leverkusen.,"""During training this evening, Neymar suffered a small muscle injury in the abductor of his left leg,"" Barcelona said in a statement ahead of Wednesday's match. ""The development of the injury will determine his availability for the upcoming games."" The 23-year-old is expected to sit out against Leverkusen, but of more concern for Barca is whether he will be ready for the Club World Cup with the Catalans set to play their semi-final in Japan on December 17. Neymar has been in sensational form this season, scoring 16 goals in 18 appearances. Earlier on Tuesday he was rewarded for a series of excellent displays by being crowned La Liga's player of the month for November."
1078,08/12/2015,02:01,Leverkusen hope to end their Barca losing streak,Bayer Leverkusen must break their six-match losing streak against reigning champions Barcelona on Wednesday if they are to have any chance of reaching the Champions League's knock-out stages.,"Leverkusen lost 2-1 at the Camp Nou in October, despite taking a shock lead, and want to avoid a repeat of the 6-1 pounding Barcelona dished out to Roma a fortnight ago when Luis Suarez and Lionel Messi ran riot in the home match. Roger Schmidt's Leverkusen face the uphill task of having to beat Barcelona and hope Roma drop points at home to BATE in Wednesday's other game in order to leap the Italians in the group and snatch a place in the last 16. Leverkusen's captain Lars Bender faces a race to be fit as he tries to shake off an ankle injury. The Germans are looking to reach the last 16 for the third year running, but have not won in Group E since beating BATE 4-1 in September. ""We'll need to take all of the few chances which come our way against Barcelona,"" said Leverkusen defender Omer Toprak. Undefeated in Europe this season, Barcelona, coached by Luis Enrique, have already booked their place in the last 16 as group winners, while Leverkusen are third in the table. Enrique is not likely to play a full-strength side having already won the group and the Spanish giants have a busy period coming up with the Club World Cup starting in Japan next week and league games over New Year. Barcelona's Lionel Messi is likely to play in Leverkusen having looked short of match fitness after injury. Dani Alves misses out due to suspension and Mathieu, Sergi Roberto, Douglas and Rafinha are all out due to injury. Germany goalkeeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen is set to play having recovered from a knee problem to play with the Spanish giants on his home soil. Barcelona are looking to end the group stage undefeated for the first time since the 2011/12 campaign. They face a Leverkusen side who are not in form having dropped to eighth in the German league after their 2-1 defeat at Hertha Berlin on Saturday with ten men. Javier Hernandez has scored 11 goals in his last ten Leverkusen appearances and netted their consolation in Berlin -- their third defeat in five Bundesliga games. With Barcelona's qualification already assured, Enrique has left out Gerard Pique and Andres Iniesta from the matchday squad. The Germans' cause has not been helped by the inclusion of forwards Lionel Messi, Neymar and Luis Suarez for the trip to flight to Leverkusen. Messi, Suarez, Neymar have scored 126 goals between them in 2015, the same number as the entire Bayern Munich team has achieved in the same period. Barca on a 12-game unbeaten run, but Saturday's 1-1 draw at Valencia ended a seven-game winning streak in which they had scored 28 goals."
1079,06/12/2015,01:45,Barca boss laments rare off night from star front three,"Barcelona coach Luis Enrique admitted his star attacking trio of Lionel Messi, Neymar and Luis Suarez had for once let his side down as Barca conceded a late equaliser to draw 1-1 at Valencia on Saturday.","The European champions should have been out of sight by half-time as all three of the South American triumvirate missed glorious chances to put the visitors in front. Suarez did finally find the net just before the hour mark, but, with new coach Gary Neville watching on from the stands, Santi Mina snatched a point for Valencia five minutes from time. Barca's first league draw of the season means they now lead Atletico Madrid by just two points at the top of the table with Real Madrid a further two points adrift. ""We lacked that ease that we normally have to finish our chances in the final third. I am happy with the performance of the team, for their ambition, their way of preparing for every match and we'll keep going,"" said Enrique. ""There is nothing to reproach the team for. We played a complete game at a very difficult place to come, we dominated the whole game and had by far the most chances. ""We weren't rewarded for all the effort we put in, but Valencia defensively played very well. They were solid, well supported by their fans and took advantage of one transition."" It could even have been worse for Barca as Valencia claimed Suarez should have been sent-off just before he opened the scoring for a stamp on Aymen Abdennour. And the hosts were also unhappy that the Uruguayan appeared to start in an offside position before beating Jaume Domenech at his near post for the opening goal. Enrique claimed not to have seen either incident and his captain Andres Iniesta insisted Barca had been unlucky to come away with just a point from Mestalla. ""Anything can happen when you don't kill the game,"" said Iniesta. ""I think above all in the first-half we had clear chances to go in front, but I am left with how well the team played again at a place like Mestalla and it is shame to concede the equaliser at the end which leaves us with a point. ""We weren't clinical in front of goal. Valencia scored with the one or two chances they had. They tried to make it an uncomfortable game for us, but we still managed to get in behind and create chances. ""We lacked that extra goal to put the game at ease. We played very well in all aspects of the game, but we lacked the most difficult thing which is the finish."" Neville doesn't officially take over at Valencia until Sunday, so the caretaker team of Voro and Neville's brother Phil were charged with stopping Barca's free-scoring form of recent weeks. And Voro believes the confidence gained from the point will help Neville's job of turning the club's season around in the coming weeks. ""We played the game we had to,"" he said. ""We've managed to get a point and, above all, taken the first step to recovering our confidence,"""

Real Madrid are now just four points behind Barca as they bounced back from their embarrassing elimination from the Copa del Rey for fielding an ineligible player in midweek with Karim Benzema, Gareth Bale and Cristiano Ronaldo all on target in their 4-1 thrashing of Getafe. However, Real remain third, two points behind Atletico Madrid, after goals from Diego Godin and Antoine Griezmann handed Diego Simeone's men a 2-0 win at Granada. Neville doesn't officially take charge until Sunday, leaving Valencia in the hands of caretaker boss Voro and his brother Phil Neville and the depleted hosts put up a brave fight against the superior quality of the European champions. Barcelona should have had the game wrapped up by half-time, but the star front three of Lionel Messi, Neymar and Suarez were uncharacteristically wasteful in front of goal. Messi spooned the first chance over from Neymar's fine cross before the latter ballooned the ball into the stands with just Jaume Domenech to beat. More brilliance on the left wing from Neymar teed up Messi once more, but on his weaker right foot he fired straight at Domenech. Suarez then fluffed his lines when he tried to square for Neymar when clean through only to overhit his cross and see the ball fly to safety. Moments later Suarez was denied a tap-in as Aderlan Santos got just enough of a deflection on Jordi Alba's cross to take the ball away from Suarez. Valencia claimed Suarez was lucky to stay on the field at the start of the second period as he appeared to stamp on Aymen Abdennour's foot after a heated exchange between the two. And Valencia felt even more hard done by when it was Suarez who finally opened the scoring as he squeezed the ball in at Domenech's near post despite latching onto Messi's pass from an offside position. Yet, they made Barca pay for their profligacy when Paco Alcacer held up a long ball over the top and laid the ball perfectly into Mina's path to slam home his first goal for the club. At the Bernabeu, any sign of the fans' frustration at the club's latest gaffe in being eliminated from the Cup due to an administrative error was eased when Benzema fired home from Pepe's fine cross after just five minutes. That was the Frenchman's first goal since being charged in a blackmail scandal involving international teammate Mathieu Valbuena. And he looked back to his best as he doubled Madrid's advantage on 16 minutes when he slotted into the bottom corner from Bale's headed cut-back after Ronaldo appeared to have been fouled inside the area. The one-way traffic continued as Bale showed great composure to finish from Ronaldo's knockdown and score for a second consecutive league game for the first time since January. Ronaldo finally got in on the act three minutes later at the end of a devastating counter-attack as he latched onto Toni Kroos's fine through ball to register his 17th goal of the season. ""To get the three points playing very well in the first half means that these players, who we know are very important, once they get up to speed can cause a lot of damage to any defence,"" said Madrid coach Rafael Benitez. ""The fact Benzema scored those two goals and contributed so much to the team going forward reinforces even more what I have said before that he is a very important player for us and makes those around him play better."" Atletico remained in front of their city rivals thanks to another solid display as they recorded their sixth clean sheet in seven games to extend their winning run in all competitions to six games. Godin powered home the opener from Koke's corner after 20 minutes to give the visitors the perfect start. Griezmann made the game safe in spectacular fashion 14 minutes from time as the French international blasted high into the roof of the net from Oliver Torres's clever through ball."

Messi, who scored 43 goals and was the catalyst for Barcelona's run to three titles last season -- the Champions League, La Liga and the Spanish Cup -- was selected following a computer analysis of the players' statistics in the championship. ""I'm proud to receive this award ahead of so many important players in La Liga,"" said Messi. ""This award in particular I want to dedicate to my son Thiago (aged 3) even if he still doesn't understand very well. Every time I leave the house he gets angry and asks me: 'Papa, are you going again to score goals?' This award is for him."" Messi also won the vote for the best striker following a poll of the captains of each of Spain's top flight sides. Barcelona's Claudio Bravo was voted the best goalkeeper and Luis Enrique top coach while Real Madrid's Sergio Ramos and James Rodriguez were named best defender and midfielder respectively. Valencia's Algerian midfielder Sofiane Feghouli was voted the top African player and Barcelona's Brazilian striker Neymar, the best player from the American continent. Real Madrid's Portuguese star Ronaldo, who scored the most La Liga goals last season with 48, won the publics' choice award. Ronaldo, Messi and Neymar were all named on Monday's shortlist for FIFA's Ballon d'Or which will be awarded on January 11. While Ronaldo has triumphed over the last two seasons (in a total of three wins), Messi has previously claimed the coveted award four times while Neymar makes the shortlist for the first time. Neymar, 23, said it was ""a great honour"" to be named for the first time alongside his illustrious La Liga rivals."

Messi was the catalyst for Barcelona's impressive run to three titles last season (the Champions League, La Liga and the Spanish Cup) and will be the standout favourite ahead of Ronaldo. The Portugal international might have finished the season without a trophy, but his individual talent shone out as he was La Liga's highest scorer with 48 goals, and has notched up a leading seven in the Champions League this term.

Real Madrid are now nine points adrift ahead of their trip to Eibar on Sunday. Messi was making his first league start in two months as he continues his comeback from knee ligament damage. But the Argentine was initially outshone by his strike partners as they each swept home from two Dani Alves crosses to put Barca in command at the break. Neymar then added his second shortly after the half-time before teeing up Messi for his first league goal since September in stoppage time. ""They are constantly looking for one another and when they all score everyone is happy,"" Dani Alves told Canal Plus about Barca's front three. ""Without victories it doesn't matter who scores or sets up the goals. If we all keep playing well, we will all be happy."" Barca boss Luis Enrique made four changes from the side that destroyed Roma 6-1 in the Champions League in midweek, but with Messi, Suarez and Neymar deployed once more in attack, the Catalans didn't miss a beat. Suarez should have opened the scoring after just two minutes when he was brilliantly played in by Neymar, but Geronimo Rulli rushed from his line to bravely smother the Uruguayan's effort just inside his area. Even when Rulli was beaten, the woodwork saved Sociedad when Andres Iniesta headed Suarez's perfectly measured cross against the post. The visitors' luck eventually ran out on 22 minutes, though, when Messi released Alves down the right and Neymar was quickest to meet his low cross and drive the ball into the top corner. Alves was the creator once more for Barca's second just before the break as his floated cross picked out Suarez to acrobatically volley into the far corner. Barca had to wait just eight minutes after the break for a third with the full-backs proving Sociedad's downfall again as this time Jeremy Mathieu squared for Neymar to apply a simple finish. That strike took Neymar and Suarez's tally in La Liga this season to 26 -- the same as the entire Real Madrid squad. However, both then turned their hand to trying to set up Messi. It looked like being a forlorn afternoon for Messi when his brilliant curling effort came back off the crossbar four minutes from time. However, a final piece of magic between Neymar and Suarez allowed the Brazilian to roll the ball invitingly across goal for Messi to slot into an empty net and seal a fantastic week for Barca which has seen them take a strangle hold of La Liga and clinch their place in the last 16 of the Champions League. Atletico had to once again settle for victory by a solitary goal despite a more impressive attacking display after Griezmann had prodded home Oliver Torres's third minute cross for his 10th goal of the season. The hosts suffered a setback when influential midfielder Tiago was stretchered off with a broken right leg midway through the first-half. Atletico were still rarely troubled, though, and should have added to their advantage after the break as Diego Godin and Koke struck the post. Fernando Torres also curled an effort just over as his search for his 100th Atletico goal continues, but a 12th clean sheet in 18 games this season was enough to close to gap on Barca. Celta Vigo moved level with Real in third thanks to Nolito's fortuitous winner five minutes from time to squeeze past Sporting Gijon 2-1. Deportivo la Coruna are on their Galician rivals tails in fifth as an early David Simon own goal and Lucas Perez's ninth league goal of the season handed them a 2-0 win at Las Palmas. And Malaga spurned a huge chance to move out of the relegation zone as Granada struck twice in the last 10 minutes to claim a 2-2 draw at La Rosaleda."

Victory moved Barca nine points clear of eternal rivals Real Madrid, who face Eibar on Sunday, at the top of La Liga just a week after inflicting a humiliating 4-0 defeat on Los Blancos at the Santiago Bernabeu. However, having also guided Barca to a treble of La Liga, Champions League and Copa del Rey last season, Enrique refused to admit he was experiencing his sweetest moment as Barca boss. ""What interests me is to see that the team is at a very high level,"" he said. ""It is normal to have ups and downs in any season. I am not that interested in whether it is the best moment because I always hope the best moment is still to come. ""It is not a cliche, there is a long way to go and we will all drop points between now and the end of the season. ""That we are in a good moment is undoubtable and that the players are enjoying it is evident, but the players are very intelligent. There is no team in the world that has won a league in November or December."" Neymar opened the scoring for Enrique's men at the Camp Nou when he swept home Dani Alves's cross midway through the first-half before Suarez dispatched another Alves cross in more spectacular style to double the advantage. And after Neymar had rolled home a third at the start of the second-half, he and Suarez set about trying to tee up Messi for his first league goal since September in just his third appearance since returning from knee ligament damage. The four-time World Player of the Year seemed set to miss out after hitting the bar four minutes from time, but Neymar finally picked out his teammate in stoppage time for the simplest of finishes to round off the scoring. ""The important thing is at the start of the game to resolve the games in the best way possible and, once the game is under control at 3-0, I understand that it happens,"" added Enrique over Neymar and Suarez's work to get Messi on the scoresheet. ""They work together so well that for them the party isn't complete (until they all score)."" And after so much success over the past decade, Alves insisted the hype surrounding Barca's stunning form of late won't lead to complacency. ""We are not losing sight of who we are, independent of the form we are in,"" said the Brazilian. ""We know this profession is like this. You are not so good when you win, or so bad when you lose.

In the first half we put the game away. ""Neymar, Messi and I are here for the good of the team, for the good of Barca. We don't think individually."" Messi, making his first return since injury, also notched up two goals. ""The people were waiting for Messi to return and we're all happy that he scored,"" acknowledged Suarez. Messi said there was an evident synchronicity with his teammates. ""With Neymar and Suarez we get on really well.

Fresh from crushing eternal rivals Real Madrid 4-0 at the Santiago Bernabeu at the weekend, they then produced a performance that the Italians could not live with to secure top spot in the section. Dani Alves set up Suarez to tap in the opener before Messi, captaining the side in his first start since returning from injury, made it two at the end of a superb move involving Neymar and Suarez. Suarez struck again just before the interval with a sweet volley and the rout continued in the second half as Neymar, Suarez and Messi all combined to give Gerard Pique a tap-in. Neymar and Suarez then helped tee up Messi to get his second and Barca's fifth on the hour and Adriano crashed in the sixth after Neymar's penalty had been saved by Wojciech Szczesny. Roma's misery was compounded when Edin Dzeko had a late penalty saved by Marc Andre ter Stegen, although Dzeko did pull one back with the last kick of the game. BATE opened the scoring in the second minute in Belarus when a Mikhail Gordeichuk shot squirmed under Bernd Leno in the away goal, but Admir Mehmedi equalised in the second half. Roma still have their destiny in their own hands, though -- a win at home to BATE next month will see them finish second. A draw between Bayern and Olympiakos in Germany would have taken both teams through but Pep Guardiola's team showed no mercy for their visitors as they raced into a three-goal lead inside the first 20 minutes. Douglas Costa got the opener and Robert Lewandowski scored his 28th goal in 25 games all told this season before Thomas Mueller tapped in the third. Holger Badstuber was sent off early in the second half on his return after his latest lengthy lay-off but Kingsley Coman added a fourth. While that win saw Bayern secure top spot in Group F, Arsenal kept their hopes alive by beating Dinamo Zagreb 3-0 at the Emirates Stadium. Mesut Ozil headed the Premier League side ahead and Alexis Sanchez added a brace, meaning the Gunners can still qualify for the last 16, provided they win at Olympiakos next month by at least a two-goal margin or by winning by a one-goal margin having scored three or more goals. The situation appears rather more straightforward for Chelsea, who cruised to a 4-0 win over Maccabi Tel Aviv in Israel with Gary Cahill, Willian, Oscar and Kurt Zouma on target. The other game in Group G saw Dynamo Kiev win 2-0 at Porto with Andriy Yarmolenko netting a first-half penalty before Derlis Gonzalez wrapped up the win. Just two points separate Chelsea, Porto and Dynamo Kiev but Jose Mourinho's side need only draw at home to the Portuguese club next month to go through. ""Very important, especially with what happened in Porto we really needed to win this match, and also important to get two victories in a few days,"" Mourinho told BT Sport. ""I hope morale comes, tranquility comes, confidence comes."" Elsewhere, Zenit St Petersburg, who had already qualified for the last 16, made it five wins out of five in Group H by beating Valencia 2-0 in Russia. Oleg Shatov and Artem Dzyuba scored in each half before Valencia defender Ruben Vezo was sent off. Gent leapfrogged Valencia into second with a 2-1 victory away to Lyon that eliminated the French team from all European competition. Jordan Ferri had put Lyon ahead but Danijel Milicevic levelled with a free-kick before Kalifa Coulibaly's last-gasp winner. Real Madrid and Manchester City, who play on Wednesday, had already secured their places in the knockout stage."
1090,23/11/2015,16:18,"'Flattery weakens', Barca coach warns","Far from riding on the euphoria of his team's 4-0 thrashing of Real Madrid, Barcelona coach Luis Enrique warned Monday that ""flattery weakens"" and said the club still had not won anything.","""Flattery weakens. We are in a phase of flattery but the team is intelligent enough and the players know that playing football and achieving objectives is difficult,"" he told reporters. The reigning European champions are aiming to seal their place in the last 16 of the Champions League when Roma visit the Camp Nou on Tuesday. And they are in a good place -- not only did they humiliate rivals Madrid in their own stadium in Saturday's Clasico, they are also leading the Spanish league and have Lionel Messi available again after a two month spell on the sidelines. Luis Enrique confirmed that the Argentine would play against Roma but compatriot Javier Mascherano, on the other hand, would not after coming off injured on Saturday. Messi ""has recovered, his injury is but a distant memory. He needs to recover physically and that only happens when you play,"" Enrique said. Brazilian right-back Dani Alves, meanwhile, agreed that victories could be a source of weakness ""because they make you believe things that are not true."" ""It's great to have won, to have won three points but the objective is further ahead,"" he said. ""If you win a game like this one and you don't win titles at the end of the year, you're left looking a bit stupid."""
1091,23/11/2015,01:28,Messi back as Barca eye last 16 against Roma,"Fresh from thrashing bitter rivals Real Madrid 4-0 at the weekend, Barcelona are aiming to seal their place in the last 16 of the Champions League when Roma visit the Camp Nou on Tuesday.","The European champions need just a point to reach the knockout stages for a 12th consecutive season and should be further boosted by the presence of Lionel Messi from the start for the first time in two months. Messi made his return as a substitute from a knee ligament injury with Barca already leading 3-0 against Madrid and played his part in Luis Suarez's second goal of the evening to round off an historic night for the Catalans. Suarez and Neymar have kept Barca afloat without Messi, scoring 24 of their last 28 goals in all competitions. And with a win also sealing top spot in the group, Barca boss Luis Enrique is unlikely to rest any of his star front three even ahead of a busy few weeks in league, Cup and Champions League before they fly off to Japan for the World Club Cup at the end of December. Whilst it would take a remarkable collapse for Barca not to qualify, Roma have it all to play for in their final two group games if they are to make the last 16 for the first time in five years. The Italians sit second in the group, a point clear of Bayer Leverkusen and two ahead of BATE Borisov, who they host in their final game. Roma got their campaign off to a great start by holding Barca to a 1-1 draw in the Italian capital thanks to Alessandro Florenzi's sensational strike from just over the halfway line. And he believes they can produce another upset at the Camp Nou. ""It will certainly be difficult. They're the strongest side in the world, but we managed to produce something of an exploit against them at the Stadio Olimpico,"" Florenzi told Corriere dello Sport. ""We have to be fearless in Spain and determined to make the most of our chances."" In contrast to Barca's brilliance, Roma's inconsistent domestic campaign continued with a 2-2 draw in terrible weather conditions at Bologna on Saturday. Rudi Garcia will also have to do without a number of attacking options as Gervinho and Mohamed Salah miss out through injury, whilst captain Francesco Totti hasn't featured since suffering a thigh injury two months ago."
1092,22/11/2015,02:05,Five conclusions from Barca's thrashing of Madrid,Barcelona took a huge step towards retaining their La Liga title by moving six points clear at the top with a 4-0 thrashing of Real Madrid on Saturday.,"Here, AFP Sports looks at what can be learned from a bleak evening for Madrid boss Rafael Benitez. Who needs Messi? Arguably the most remarkable part of an utterly dominant display from Barca was the fact most of the damage was inflicted without Lionel Messi on the field. The four-time World Player of the Year made his return from a two-month injury layoff with the visitors already 3-0 up. Once again it was Luis Suarez and Neymar who shone in Messi's absence as Suarez opened and rounded off the scoring, whilst Neymar added Barca's second and set up two more in the second-half. Benitez on the brink? Despite having lost just twice in 16 games in charge, a defeat of this magnitude could spell the end for Benitez. The Madrid fans called for President Florentino Perez's resignation as their humiliation unfolded, but that is only more likely to see the top man at the club turn on Benitez. Moreover, with a club legend like Zinedine Zidane coaching Madrid's reserve team, Perez wouldn't have to look far for a popular replacement. Iniesta brings Bernabeu to its feet Neymar and Suarez had scored Barca's previous 19 La Liga goals before Andres Iniesta rifled his side's third into the top corner to end any hopes of a Madrid revival in the second-half. Another magisterial display from the Spanish international reaped the applause it deserved when he was replaced late on, even from the frustrated Madrid fans in scenes similar to the famous reception given to Ronaldinho after his two incredible goals in a 3-0 Barca win at the Bernabeu 10 years ago. Bale posted missing again In his 100th game in a Madrid shirt, this was a glorious chance for Gareth Bale to dispel the mounting critics of his impotent displays in a Real shirt for the past 18 months. Yet, despite playing in his favoured role behind the striker, Bale had no impact on the game whatsoever and the time may be coming when Madrid decide to cut their losses on the Welshman with a series of Premier League clubs said to be interested. Is Sergi Roberto La Masia's newest star? Whilst Madrid started with 10 foreigners for the first time in a Clasico, Barca remained true to their traditions with five graduates from their La Masia academy in the starting line-up. One of those five, Sergi Roberto, was rewarded for his fine form this season with a start in the position on the right side of the attack usually occupied by Messi. And he was Messi-like in setting up the opening goal as he drove at the Madrid defence before timing a perfect pass into the path of Suarez."
1093,21/11/2015,22:06,Benitez not fearing sack despite Barca thrashing,Real Madrid coach Rafael Benitez insisted he is more worried about recovering his players' confidence than being sacked after the Spanish giants were thrashed 4-0 at home by bitter rivals Barcelona on Saturday.,"The former Liverpool and Chelsea manager has only been in charge for 16 games, but back-to-back defeats now leave Madrid six points behind Barcelona in the title race. ""Logically we are hurting. It hurts to lose and particularly to lose in that manner,"" said Benitez. ""We have lost three points in La Liga and nothing more. What worries me is the team recovering mentally before the next game."" Just as galling as the result for Madrid fans was their side's complete inferiority as Barca dominated from start to finish and could even afford the luxury of leaving four-time World Player of the Year Lionel Messi on the bench on his return from a two-month injury layoff. Goals from Luis Suarez, Neymar and Andres Iniesta had already put Barca 3-0 up by the time Messi was introduced and he was involved in setting up Suarez to seal a humiliating defeat for Benitez's men. The home supporters called for club president Florentino Perez's resignation towards the end of the game, but it is Benitez who is most likely to be in the firing line. However, he believes he will be given the chance to turn things around, starting with Wednesday's Champions League trip to Shakhtar Donetsk. ""I insist that we haven't played well and the only think that we can do now is recover as quickly as possible to face the next game. ""Thinking about La Liga, there is still a long way to go and we need to do things as we were doing them when we were undefeated."" And Madrid vice-captain Marcelo insisted his team's often ego-driven dressing room remains fully behind Benitez. ""We have full confidence in him and him with us,"" said the Brazilian. ""We are at the beginning of the project, we have confidence and there are still plenty of games left to play."" By contrast, Barca boss Luis Enrique couldn't hide his delight at a brilliant all-round display by the European champions, but agreed with Benitez that the title race is not over yet. ""It is a memorable game against the eternal rival. We both have the same objectives and it tastes all the better having been so superior,"" said Enrique. ""It was a complete game from us. I am very happy because although there is still a long way to go in the league it is always important to win here and to give our fans this joy."" Iniesta was applauded off by some Madrid fans when he was replaced 13 minutes from time in scenes reminiscent of the Bernabeu's reaction to Ronaldinho's stellar performance in a 3-0 Barca win 10 years ago. And he admitted Barca had no intention of slowing down as they tried to emulate the 5-0 thrashing of Jose Mourinho's Madrid five years ago. ""We wanted to win and then the bigger the difference the better,"" he said. ""There is still a long way to go and it is in no way decisive, but we go away from here very, very happy. ""I thank the fans (for their gesture.)"""

1095,20/11/2015,17:31,Barca coach to take late decision over Messi fitness,Barcelona coach Luis Enrique has said he will wait until an hour before Saturday's mammoth clash with Real Madrid before deciding whether Lionel Messi will start on his return from a two-month injury layoff.,"Messi has been sidelined since damaging knee ligaments against Las Palmas on September 26, but is expected to feature at the Santiago Bernabeu after taking a full part in training this week. ""Messi's feelings since he rejoined the group have been positive and he is working at the rhythm of the group, but we still have to train today and then we will talk,"" Enrique said on Friday. ""It is evident he isn't 100 percent physically, but, whether he plays or not, the great news is that he has recovered. ""We will decide if Leo plays an hour before the game."" Victory would take Barca six points clear of Madrid at the top of the table. However, Enrique rejected claims his side could strike a decisive blow in the title race after just 12 games. ""For me this game will not be definitive for La Liga although it is very nice if you win at the home of your biggest rivals. It is the best scenario for a Barca player."" The match will be played under unprecedented security measures after a string of deadly attacks in Paris a week ago that killed 130 people. A total of 1,200 police officers will be deployed around the stadium, six times the usual number for a game classified as presenting a high security risk. However, Enrique insisted he can only concentrate on the game and leave the job of ensuring the match passes off safely to the experts. ""What worries me is what is happening on a worldwide level,"" he added. ""I concentrate on what happens on the field and the security is in the hands of the specialists."""
1096,20/11/2015,14:54,Huge security operation for Real-Barcelona Clasico,"Spanish police will tighten a massive security cordon of 1,200 police around the Real Madrid-Barcelona Clasico football match on Saturday because of the Paris terror attacks.","Across Europe's major leagues security forces will be keeping a close watch on top games where the 129 victims of the French attacks on November 13 will again be commemorated. The police force at the La Liga clash in the Spanish capital is six times higher than the usual deployment for a game that is classified as a high security risk. A minute's silence will be held before all La Liga matches. Real Madrid fans have called off their usual fan display of banners out of respect to the victims. Madrid saw its own terror carnage in December 2004 when 191 people were killed in bomb attacks. Two years before that the Basque separatist group ETA planted a car bomb near the Madrid stadium ahead of a Champions League semi-final between Madrid and Barcelona causing 17 injuries. The game still went ahead. French authorities have banned away fans from Ligue 1 matches which will resume this weekend. Extra police will be on duty and there will be a ""very strict strengthening of searches and pat-downs at the entry to stadiums,"" said French Professional Football League president Frederic Thiriez. English Premier League clubs are also on a ""heightened sense of awareness"" because of the Paris massacre. The French anthem, ""La Marseillaise"", will be sung before all top division games as a tribute to the Paris victims. ""The clubs have been fully briefed in context of the current guidance from national security services and are liaising with their local police forces to ensure the appropriate security and safety measures are in place,"" said Premier League executive chairman Richard Scudamore. French international Morgan Schneiderlin and German counterpart Bastian Schweinsteiger -- who were playing at the Stade de France last week when it was attacked -- are not certain to play for Manchester United against Watford on Saturday. But French internationals Paul Pogba and Patrice Evra and Germany midfielder Sami Khedira are expected to turn out for Juventus in their Italian clash with AC Milan on Saturday. ""It hasn't been easy for them. They went through a difficult experience,"" said Juventus coach Massimiliano Allegri. ""But they seem to be quite calm. Returning to Turin has been good for them."" Turin's police chief Salvatore Longo said ""there will be more controls with the help of sniffer dogs, the bomb squad and undercover agents"" at the game. Bologna and AS Roma players may carry the French flag out at the start of their match. German Football Federation leaders have appealed for fans not to go to games with traditional flares and fireworks to avoid causing panic in stadiums. German champions Bayern Munich are among clubs to have ordered stricter security for home games. Russia's Internal Affairs Minister Vladimir Kolokoltsev said the government has taken all necessary security measures for stadiums, concert halls and other public venues with the FSB national security service. ""We're in full readiness for any complications of the situation,"" he said in a statement. We have experience of quick reaction to any challenge or threat."""
1097,20/11/2015,01:49,Security concerns overshadow Messi's Clasico return,An unprecedented level of security will be put in place for Real Madrid's huge clash with Barcelona on Saturday in response to the deadly attacks on Paris a week ago.,"The security threat to what is widely regarded as the biggest game in world football, with an estimated global television audience of 500 million, has even overshadowed the return of Lionel Messi for Barcelona after a two-month injury layoff. Spanish government officials have promised a security presence of 2,400 police, stewards and emergency services at the Santiago Bernabeu to form a triple ring of security around the stadium. The Stade de France, where France were hosting Germany, was one of a number of targets struck during the attacks on Friday that left 129 dead and over 350 injured. Meanwhile, Spain's friendly against Belgium in Brussels was postponed due to the elevated terror threat and Germany's meeting with the Netherlands called off by a bomb threat on Tuesday. However, the Spanish authorities insist that there is no reason to believe another late postponement will be required. ""It is a shame that people aren't talking about sport, football or the spectacle, but it is the reality we live in and we can't ignore it,"" said Barca captain Andres Iniesta on Thursday. ""We have to try to return to normality."" On the field, Barca lead Madrid by three points at the top of the table despite being without Messi for the last two months. The Argentine seems certain to feature after taking a full part in training this week, but it is still unknown whether coach Luis Enrique will risk his star from the start or allow him to ease back into action from the bench. ""If we can count on Leo from the start our chances are much greater,"" added Iniesta. In Messi's absence, Luis Suarez and Neymar have propelled Barca to five wins in their last six league games and scored all of the European champions' last 17 league goals. Madrid will be hoping their own much-hyped front three can perform likewise after a slow start to the season provoked by poor form, injuries and off-field problems. Saturday will be just the third time this season that all of Cristiano Ronaldo, Gareth Bale and Karim Benzema start together. Benzema will play for the first time since being charged with complicity to blackmail and conspiring to commit a criminal act in his native France in a case involving a sex tape featuring international teammate Mathieu Valbuena. Meanwhile, Bale needs a big performance to alleviate the mounting critics of the Welshman's inability to perform for Madrid in the biggest games. ""I feel strong, in shape for this game and ready for the battle,"" Bale told Madrid's website. ""I want to keep trying to give my best, to work hard and to help the team win."" Madrid boss Rafael Benitez is hoping to count on a fully-fit squad for the first time this season as goalkeeper Keylor Navas, Sergio Ramos and Marcelo look set to shrug off injuries picked up before the international break. Dani Carvajal is also expected to replace Danilo at right-back, while Benitez has a big decision over whether to start James Rodriguez after he proved his match fitness by playing 180 minutes for Colombia over the past week. Other than Messi, Barca's other injury concern is over Ivan Rakitic, who is doubtful with a calf injury. The clash between the top two will favour third-placed Atletico Madrid should they manage to win at Real Betis on Sunday. Diego Simeone's men sit just one point adrift of Real Madrid.

In addition, 1,195 stewards will be on duty along with the emergency services. ""The measures will be the same as in any match classified as a risk, but reinforced with a series of additional measures given the extraordinary circumstances we find ourselves in,"" said Concepcion Dancausa, a national government delegate for the Madrid regional authority, at a press conference after a meeting of representatives of both clubs, police and the local and national governments. ""Security will be greatly reinforced. There will be a lot of security personnel to control not only the access to the stadium, but also the outskirts and the transport that will bring fans to the stadium,"" Spanish Interior Minister Jorge Fernandez Diaz said earlier. Spain's anti-violence commission met with political, police and sporting authorities on Wednesday and declared the match as ""high risk"", which is customary for the biggest games in La Liga, especially those between eternal rivals Madrid and Barca. The events in Paris, allied to a terror threat level of four out of a maximum five in Spain, means that the security measures have ""no precedent for the celebration of sporting events,"" according to Francisco Martinez Vazquez, secretary of state for security. However, Dancausa said that the number of security personnel deployed for the 2010 Champions League final at the Santiago Bernabeu between Bayern Munich and Inter Milan was even greater. Like on that occasion, there will be a triple ring of security around the stadium with over 1,500 police, who will be armed with horses, dogs and metal detectors. Security checks ""are going to be more exhaustive than usual"", added Dancausa. A capacity crowd of 81,000 fans are expected to attend the match widely seen as the biggest in the world with an estimated television audience of 500 million. The Stade de France, where an 80,000 crowd were watching France host Germany, was one of a series of targets across the French capital on Friday. As a result of the increased terror threat, Spain's friendly in Belgium was postponed on Tuesday, as was Germany's clash with the Netherlands due to a bomb threat in Hannover. The Bernabeu was the target of a bomb threat in December 2004, just months after the Madrid train bombings that killed 191 people. The stadium was evacuated quickly and calmly near the end of a league match against Real Sociedad. Two years previously, the Basque separatist group ETA planted a car bomb near the stadium on the day of a Champions League semi-final between Madrid and Barcelona causing 17 injuries. However, the game still went ahead. Fernandez Diaz insisted at the moment there is no reason to think about postponing the game. However, ""should those circumstances arise, the priority is to ensure people's lives,"" he added."

""From what I know and what the security forces are saying, all possible measures will be taken and everyone should collaborate so that before, during and after the game a sporting spectacle can take place and it is the game that is the focus for such a special day for the world of football."" The Stade de France, where France were hosting Germany, was one of a number of targets struck during the attacks on Friday that left 129 dead and over 350 injured. Iniesta was part of the Spain squad that travelled to Brussels for a friendly against Belgium on Tuesday only for the game to be suspended less than 24 hours before kick-off due to the elevated terror threat. ""Fear isn't the right word, but there was concern,"" Iniesta added. ""We went because it seemed like everything could take place normally despite the situation we were in before they took that decision. A completely correct decision."" However, he wholeheartedly backed the decision for games across Spain and the rest of Europe to go ahead this weekend. ""It is a shame that people aren't talking about sport, football or the spectacle, but it is the reality we live in and we can't ignore it. ""We have to try to return to normality.

1103,19/11/2015,02:10,Neymar breaks out of Messi's shadow ahead of El Clasico,"During Brazilian star Neymar's two-and-a-half year spell at Barcelona, there has been one continuous soundbite from the softly-spoken 23-year-old: ""I'm here to learn from the best"".","The ""best"" he consistently cites is teammate and four-time World Player of the Year Lionel Messi. The two share a telepathic relationship on the field and, along with Uruguayan Luis Suarez, form one of the most lethal strike forces world football has ever seen. ""To play beside the best is very easy,"" Neymar said during Barca's treble-winning campaign last season. Yet, whilst Messi has been sidelined for the past two months by knee ligament damage, it is Neymar that has carried the European champions to an unexpected three-point lead in La Liga heading into Saturday's huge clash away at Real Madrid. Given his form in recent months, is there much for Neymar the apprentice to learn from his master Messi? And, with the latter set to return this weekend, will Neymar be happy to hand over the reigns once more to the Argentine? Initial impressions are that he will. Primarily because Neymar, Messi and Suarez share an equally strong relationship off the field as they do in tearing opponents to shreds on it. Their social media pages spill over with mutual admiration, whilst Suarez and Neymar have been quick to shout down any suggestions their form has meant Messi's absence has been forgotten. ""People remember him just as well because he is the best player in the world,"" said Suarez after a recent victory over Getafe. Yet, Neymar's trajectory suggests he will be the one to finally break Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo's eight-year reign as the world's two best players. In his first season at Barca, Neymar netted just nine league goals. In 10 games this campaign he already has 11 to lead Ronaldo and Messi as the league's top scorer. The signs of improvement were clear to see last season. Neymar struck 39 times in 51 games, including becoming the first man to net in both legs of the Champions League quarter and semi-finals, as well as the final. This season he has gone to a new level. In Messi's absence he has demanded the ball, created and scored goals. Just as impressively, the petulance that has at times blighted his career to date, most notably in being sent-off and sent-home early from the Copa America in June, appears to have gone. When he grew frustrated with the rough attention and lack of protection being offered from the referee in Barca's last outing against Villarreal, he chanelled the anger constructively by going on to score twice and set up the other in a 3-0 win. His stunning second provoked Barca boss Luis Enrique to make comparisons with Ronaldinho - another Brazilian that enthralled the Camp Nou on his way to becoming the world's best. ""Since the start of the season he has been electric,"" added Enrique. ""Neymar has reached a point of maturity. He's in superlative form, nearly at the level of the two footballers who top them all,"" said Argentina boss Gerardo Martino, who was in charge of Neymar during his first season at Barca. Messi will almost certainly take home his fifth Ballon d'Or come January as just reward for his starring role in Barca's second treble in six years. Yet, for the first time Neymar is expected to be standing alongside he and Ronaldo on the podium in what will be the most obvious sign yet of his emergence as the best of the rest. Form suggests he will even be the star that shines brightest at the Bernabeu on Saturday."

In a statement, La Liga called for the minute of silence ""in memory of the victims"" at the start of Saturday's match in the 81,000-strong Madrid stadium. It has also asked both clubs to broadcast the hashtag #TodosSomosFrancia (""We are all France"") during the moment of silence on screens in the stadium. ""In this way, professional football joins hands with international expressions of condolences and expresses its solidarity with the families and friends of victims."" The match kicks off Saturday at 1815 local time (1715GMT) with ""draconian security measures"", Interior Minister Jorge Fernandez Diaz said Wednesday, after two high-profile international friendlies were postponed in the wake of the Paris attacks that left 129 dead and over 350 injured. Germany's meeting with the Netherlands was called off just hours before kick-off on Tuesday due to a bomb threat in Hanover, whilst Belgium's friendly against Spain had already been postponed due to the heightened security threat in Brussels."
1105,18/11/2015,15:26,Xavi says Barcelona have not missed Messi,"Barcelona legend Xavi Hernandez says his old team has not missed the world's best player Lionel Messi, ahead of this weekend's first clash of the season with Real Madrid.","The midfielder, now playing in Qatar, told AFP that Barcelona have played extremely well without their talisman and four-time Ballon d'Or winner. Messi hasn't played for Barca since sustaining knee ligament damage in a 2-1 victory over Las Palmas in September. However, there is an outside chance he could make a dramatic return against Barca's biggest rivals Madrid in the ""El Clasico"" in the Spanish capital on Saturday. But with or without him, Xavi says Barcelona are capable of beating the best. ""Messi is a great player without a doubt and I believe he plays a crucial role in Barcelona in every game,"" Xavi, who now plays for one of Qatar's top teams, Al Sadd, told AFP. ""But I must say as well that the team is playing well now without him... and scoring plenty of goals in the process which means that Barcelona manage to do well without him. ""They didn't suffer from his absence which is a good sign."" In Messi's absence, Barcelona have recorded four straight league victories propelling Luis Enrique's men to the top of La Liga, three points ahead of arch-rivals Madrid in second. Strikers Neymar and Luis Suarez have scored 10 goals apiece since the Argentine was sidelined. The duo could once again lead the line at the weekend with Spanish media suggesting that Barca may not rush Messi back into the starting line-up as a precaution. Messi returned to training on Monday. This weekend's match is the first El Clasico in which Xavi will not play a role in the past 17 years. He said the result is always difficult to predict, but added that Barcelona are ""capable of repeating the treble this season"". Last year, the Catalans won the Champions League, La Liga and the Copa del Rey, one of the most successful seasons in the club's 116-year history. Xavi added that he was enjoying his time in the Gulf but ruled out becoming Qatar's national coach in the future. ""I don't think so, I don't think about my future now, all my concentration is towards my club, Al Sadd."" Xavi played more than 500 times for Barcelona in a career stretching 17 years. The former World Soccer Player of the Year won eight La Liga and four Champions League titles while at Barca. Al Sadd currently sit third in the Qatar Stars League."
1106,18/11/2015,02:31,Spanish league chief confident of safe Clasico,"Head of the Spanish league, Javier Tebas, is confident that Saturday's huge clash between Real Madrid and Barcelona will pass off safely after two high-profile international friendlies were postponed in the wake of Friday's deadly attacks in Paris.","Germany's meeting with the Netherlands was called off just hours before kick-off on Tuesday due to a bomb threat in Hanover, whilst Belgium's friendly against Spain had already been postponed due to the heightened security threat in Brussels. The Stade de France, where France were hosting Germany, was one of the targets of a number of attacks from gunmen and suicide bombers that left 129 people dead and over 350 injured in Paris. ""Spain has been the target of jihadi terrorism in the past, but this is obviously a police matter,"" Tebas said in an exclusive interview with AFP. ""Evidently, when something of the magnitude that took place in Paris happens anywhere in Europe, all countries take extra measures. ""Obviously, this week we have to take measures to give greater security to everyone, but there are measures which the police know how to handle. ""The police will control it and I am sure that we will be completely safe."""
1107,16/11/2015,21:36,Messi returns to Barca training ahead of Real clash,"Barcelona star Lionel Messi returned to training with his team-mates on Monday following a knee injury, ahead of the league leaders' trip to Real Madrid this weekend.","Messi hasn't featured for Barca since sustaining knee ligament damage in a 2-1 victory over Las Palmas at the end of September, but is in line to make his comeback in Saturday's first Clasico of the season at the Santiago Bernabeu. ""(Monday's training) session included the presence of 'Leo' Messi, who is in the process of recovering from a left knee injury suffered on September 26,"" read a post on Barca's club website. Barca have performed well in the absence of the four-time Ballon d'Or winner, with four straight league victories propelling Luis Enrique's men to the top of La Liga, three points ahead of arch-rivals Madrid in second. Neymar and Luis Suarez have scored 10 goals apiece since the Argentine was sidelined, and the duo could again lead the line at the weekend with Spanish media suggesting that Barca may not rush Messi back into the starting line-up as a precaution. Croatian midfielder Ivan Rakitic also returned to training after injuring his calf in a 3-0 Champions League group stage victory over BATE Borisov at the start of the month."
1108,08/11/2015,19:22,Luis Enrique sees Ronaldinho traits in Neymar,Barcelona coach Luis Enrique believes Neymar is following in the footsteps of fellow-Brazilian Ronaldinho after he sealed another two-goal display with a fabulous individual effort as Barca beat Villarreal 3-0 on Sunday.,"Neymar has now scored 11 times in just 10 La Liga appearances this season as he and Luis Suarez have dragged the European champions through a six-week spell without the injured Lionel Messi relatively unscathed. Ronaldinho won two league titles, a Champions League and the 2005 Ballon d'Or during his time in the Catalan capital. Enrique played with Ronaldinho towards the end of his Barca playing career, but, in contrast to his former teammate, was quick to laud Neymar's work-rate as well as his brilliance near the opposition area. ""I had the luck to play with Ronaldinho and I remember how we were struck before the games just watching him strike the ball. The same type of thing happens with Ney. ""We are talking about unique, special players and, I repeat, I can highlight his goals, his attacking play but also the running he does defensively and the solidarity he has with the rest of the team."" Neymar's sensational form in 2015 is likely to see him named among the three finalists for the Ballon d'Or for the first time in December. But Enrique insisted his sights should be on more trophies after lifting the treble last season than beating Messi or Cristiano Ronaldo to individual awards. ""The key to achieve the collective objectives we have and from there the individual awards will come."" A fourth consecutive league win ensures Barca will at the worst go into El Clasico against Real Madrid in two weeks' time level on points with their eternal rivals. Between them Neymar and Suarez have combined for Barca's last 17 league goals to keep their title bid on track. However, whilst insisting that Messi will not be rushed back into action, Enrique dismissed suggestions he hasn't been missed in recent weeks. ""The only thing we worried about since Leo got injured was that his recovery went well. ""There is no doubt that we are infinitely better with him."""
1109,05/11/2015,23:20,Ronaldo motivated by Messi rivalry,Cristiano Ronaldo says his fierce rivalry with Lionel Messi provides all the motivation he needs to keep striving for even more success.,"Real Madrid forward Ronaldo has jousted with Barcelona striker Messi for the La Liga title, the Champions League crown and a host of individual awards since moving to Spain from Manchester United in 2009. Messi has four La Liga titles and two Champions League triumphs in the period following Ronaldo's arrival at the Bernabeu, while the Madrid ace has one Spanish league success and one Champions League triumph with Los Blancos. After Messi won the Ballon d'Or prize given to the world's best player four years in a row, Ronaldo, who also won the award while with United in 2008, managed to turn the tables as he picked up the trophy in 2013 and 2014. The supremely talented duo both possess an intense desire to be ranked as the very best and that, combined with their roles as figureheads of duelling superpowers Real and Barca, has prevented them from striking up any kind of friendship. Asked how he felt whenever Messi got the better of him, Ronaldo told BT Sport: ""I'm always disappointed when I lose, it's normal. I'm not a fake person. I'm not going to hide it when I feel disappointed. ""But I'm not complaining because I've won three times, I never thought I would win one Golden Ball, so to win three is great, gives me great motivation to work hard and achieve more. ""I want more and more. I still have many years to play football, and I want to win more things. ""Messi is an unbelievable player and maybe it pushes me more, harder to be better and better. ""But the people who know me, know I'm always like that, I try to be the best professional in my job, I try to be the best all the time. ""Sometimes it's not possible because we are human beings, we are not machines. But in my mind I'm the best and I work like the best."" Earlier this season, Ronaldo became Real's leading goalscorer with 326 goals in all competitions, but he hasn't enjoyed the same domestic success as Messi. Even during Jose Mourinho's reign as Real boss, the pair won only one La Liga title in 2012 and reportedly clashed over the team's cautious style of play. But Ronaldo remains a fan of Mourinho and offered his support to the under-fire Chelsea chief. ""I would put him at the top, I always say that. He's a good coach, he did many good things and won many trophies for other clubs,"" Ronaldo said. ""My coach is now (Rafael) Benitez and I'm comfortable we are going to win many things together."" While Ronaldo and Messi reign supreme as the world's best, the Madrid player still keeps an eye on the next generation of emerging stars. He regards Real team-mate Martin Odegaard, Chelsea's Eden Hazard, Manchester United's Memphis Depay, Paul Pogba of Juventus and Barcelona's Neymar as the most exciting talents to follow. ""You see many players with potential. I will mention Odegaard of Madrid for example, at 16 he's still young but you can see he's a very good player,"" Ronaldo added. ""Hazard for example, the number seven of Manchester Depay is a good player too, Pogba and maybe Neymar."""
1110,05/11/2015,01:35,Neymar enjoying spotlight in Messi's absence,Brazilian striker Neymar said he is in the form of his life after netting twice as Barcelona eased past BATE Borisov 3-0 in the Champions League on Wednesday.,"Neymar also set up Barca's other goal on the night for Luis Suarez as the defending champions moved to within a point of sealing their place in the last 16. Suarez and Neymar have now combined for 18 of Barca's last 21 goals since four-time World Player of the Year Lionel Messi suffered knee ligament damage nearly six weeks ago. Barca remain hopeful Messi could be fit to face Real Madrid in just over two weeks' time. But Neymar admitted he is enjoying sharing the responsibility of leading the Catalans along with Suarez in Messi's absence. ""It is clear we miss Messi, but I am in the form of my life and I hope to continue like this,"" he told beIN Sports. Neymar opened the scoring from the penalty spot before teeing up Suarez to double the advantage on the hour mark. The Uruguayan then returned the favour as his unselfish pass presented Neymar with an open goal for his second of the night and 11th of the season seven minutes from time. ""Half the goal belongs to Suarez. He is a star and in great form."" The South American duo's hot streak of late has wiped away early season fears of Barca's lack of killer instinct in front of goal. However, coach Luis Enrique insisted he never doubted his star forward line would come good. ""We never doubted we would get our killer touch back given the profile of the players we have up front,"" he said. ""Given their quality and the chances the team creates, it was never in doubt."" Victory extends Barca's advantage at the top of Group E as they lead second-placed Roma by five points with two games remaining. The Italians visit the Camp Nou in three weeks' time and Barca may not even need a point to qualify if Bayer Leverkusen fail to win away at BATE. ""Our intention is to win the group,"" added Enrique. ""We are playing against Roma and we will try to win the game as Barca do in every match."" The one setback of the evening for the hosts was another injury to a midfield player as Ivan Rakitic hobbled off after 20 minutes. Tests revealed a minor tear in his right calf which will keep him out of Sunday's clash at home to Villarreal. However, Enrique refused to hazard a guess as to whether the Croatian would be fit to face Madrid. ""We are waiting on news from the doctors, but he will definitely miss the next game. ""The only thing that is concerning me at the moment is Villarreal. That is the only game I am thinking about."""
1111,04/11/2015,22:50,"Neymar, Suarez double act eases Barca past BATE",Neymar scored twice as defending champions Barcelona moved to the brink of sealing their place in the last 16 of the Champions League with a 3-0 win over BATE Borisov.,"The Brazilian opened the scoring from the penalty spot before teeing up Luis Suarez to double the hosts' advantage. Suarez then returned the favour for Neymar to round off the scoring. The South American strike duo have now scored 18 of Barca's last 21 goals in all competitions in the prolonged absence of the injured Lionel Messi. However, there was another injury blow for Luis Enrique's men as Ivan Rakitic hobbled off with a calf problem that could now keep him out of the visit to Real Madrid later this month. Victory strengthens Barcelona's position atop Group E, five points clear of second-placed Roma, who beat Bayer Leverkusen 3-2 in the other game in the group on Wednesday. Before kick-off Barca showed their outrage at a UEFA fine for the displaying of flags in support of Catalan independence at their last home Champions League against Leverkusen. An estimated 30,000 of the flags were handed out to fans by pro-independence campaigners and a huge banner saying ""respecte"" (respect in Catalan) was hung from the stands. The Champions League anthem was also whistled for which UEFA opened an investigation into Manchester City after their clash with Sevilla a fortnight ago. Once the game got underway it was once again the Neymar and Suarez show in Messi's absence. Suarez had the first big chance of the game after just four minutes, but failed to hit the target from Neymar's lovely lofted pass. BATE 'keeper Sergey Chernik was quick off his line to prevent Neymar as he burst clear on goal moments later. However, Barca were stung when Rakitic was forced off with a calf problem that makes him a doubt for the season's first El Clasico in 17 days time. Munir El Haddadi replaced the Croatian and, despite failing to break his year-long goal drought, he did make a positive impact. The Spanish under-21 international was only denied his much craved goal by a brilliant clearance from Nemanja Milunovic to cut out Suarez's cross. It was Munir who was brought down by Filip Mladenovic inside the area on the half hour mark and Neymar stepped up to roll home his first Champions League goal of the season. Neymar turned provider moments later for his compatriot Adriano who sneaked the ball past Chernik only to see the ball come back off the post. Chernik did well once more to deny Suarez as he pounced on a loose ball inside the area early in the second period. But there was nothing he could do when the Uruguayan rifled the ball into the bottom corner from Neymar's pass on the hour mark. And the roles were reversed seven minutes from time as this time Suarez bore down on goal before unselfishly rolling the ball across the area for Neymar to tap home his 11th goal of the season."
1112,03/11/2015,18:51,"30,000 Catalan independence flags for Barcelona-BATE match","Nationalist groups said Tuesday they will distribute 30,000 Catalan independence flags during Barcelona's Champions League match against BATE Borisov to protest against a UEFA fine for using the flags at other matches.","""Nobody can tell us where and when we, Catalans, can show our symbols,"" said Jordi Sanchez, the president of the Catalan National Assembly, a pro-independence organisation which has in recent years organised massive demonstrations in favour of Catalonia's secession from Spain. Some 300 volunteers from several pro-independence groups will give the flags to fans going into Barcelona's match on Wednesday at the Camp Nou and will ask them to display them. European football's governing body fined Barca 40,000 euros ($44,000, £28,800) for the flags displayed during the European champions' 2-1 win over Bayer Leverkusen last month. It was the second such sanction in a matter of months as Barca were fined 30,000 euros for the same reason after their Champions League final success against Juventus in Berlin in May. UEFA argues the use of the flag violates its regulations, which prohibit ""the use of gestures, words, objects or any other means to transmit any message that is not fit for a sports event, particularly messages that are of a political, ideological, religious, offensive or provocative nature"". Barcelona president Josep Maria Bartomeu has threatened to drag UEFA through the courts for violating the club's fans' right to freedom of speech. Catalans' longstanding demands for greater autonomy have intensified in recent years, in tandem with the country's economic crisis. Home to 7.5 million people, Spain's richest region has its own widely spoken language and distinct culture. Pro-independence parties won a majority of seats in the Catalan parliament in Barcelona for the first time in elections last month. They are seeking to pass a resolution in the Catalan parliament in early November announcing the formal start of secession from Spain and the formation of a new republican state within 18 months."
1113,03/11/2015,02:18,Barca seek early route into last 16,Defending champions Barcelona could seal their passage into the last 16 of the Champions League with two games to spare in Group E when they host BATE Borisov on Wednesday.,"A third consecutive Champions League victory for the Catalans, despite the prolonged absence of the injured Lionel Messi, allied to Roma not beating Bayer Leverkusen at home, will mathematically seal the five-time champions' place in the knockout stages. Luis Suarez and Neymar have carried the goalscoring burden in Messi's absence, scoring all of Barca's last 14 league goals. Both were on target in a comfortable 2-0 win over Getafe on Saturday that created more headlines for the Halloween costumes that the Barca players wore as they burst into a Getafe post-match press conference than the action on the field. And Suarez said he and Neymar's contrasting styles help compliment each other. ""Everyone knows their own game. I don't try to dribble past three or four players, but Neymar has those characteristics. ""Every player tries to adapt to what the coach asks of them."" However, the former Liverpool striker laughed off suggestions Barca's recent form means they aren't missing Messi. ""Everyone remembers Messi because he is the best player in the world. We all miss him."" Barca boss Luis Enrique heaped praise upon Sergio Busquets rather than Suarez and Neymar after the win at Getafe, hailing him as the ""best midfielder in the world."" However, Enrique also suggested he wants to give Busquets a rest after a heavy workload at the start of the season and with a tough test in Villarreal to come at the weekend, the Spanish international may be left out on Wednesday. Javier Mascherano is free to play despite being halfway though a two-game ban in La Liga. Andres Iniesta is also likely to return to the starting line-up for the first time in over a month after making his return from a hamstring injury as a second-half substitute at the weekend. Sergi Roberto also made his comeback against Getafe from a brief spell on the sidelines after picking up a groin injury in Barca's 2-0 win over BATE in Belarus two weeks ago. And the 23-year-old made a spectacular impression with assists for both goals, including a perfectly weighted backheel into Suarez's path for the opener. ""After an injury it is important to get back up to the speed of the competition. I felt good physically and without any pain,"" he said."
1114,02/11/2015,14:07,Injured Rafinha extends Barca deal to 2020,"European champions Barcelona have offered Brazilian midfielder Rafinha a contract extension until 2020, the club revealed on Monday.","The 22-year-old has been sidelined for the past two months with cruciate ligament damage in his right knee that is expected to keep him out of action for the majority of the season. ""FC Barcelona has reached an agreement with Rafael Alcantara, 'Rafinha', for the renewal of his contract until June 30, 2020,"" Barca said in a statement. ""The new contract will have a release clause of 75 million euros ($82.5 million, £53.5 million) and the contract will be signed shortly."" Rafinha made 36 appearances in Barca's treble-winning campaign last season and had been set for an even bigger role this campaign until he was injured in a 1-1 draw away to Roma in the Champions League in September. His brother, Bayern Munich midfielder Thiago Alcantara, suffered similar knee problems last season before returning late in the campaign to help the German giants seal a third consecutive Bundesliga title."

The South American duo have now scored the European champions' last 14 goals in La Liga since Messi suffered knee ligament damage over a month ago. However, Enrique choose to highlight the consistently brilliant but often overlooked Busquets. ""He is a unique player. He is the most complete and, for me, best midfielder in the world without a doubt,"" he said. ""He is a fundamental player for us, not just for his football intelligence but because he can play in any position and play at a very high level."" Indeed, Enrique admitted his biggest worry with Busquets is to ensure he gets enough rest having started every one of Barca's league and Champions League games this season due to a spate of injuries to other midfielders. ""Playing in front of the defence is where he feels most comfortable and when he is there the team gains solidity in defence and attack. ""He is a key player and I will try to give him a rest when I can."" Enrique was finally able to count on Sergi Roberto and Andres Iniesta after they overcame groin and hamstring injuries respectively. And it was 23-year-old Roberto who bolstered his burdening reputation with assists for both goals, including a spectacular backheel to play in Suarez for the opener. ""We are starting to get players back which is positive,"" added Enrique. ""Sergi played a very complete game. He is changing positions and giving us a lot. He is in great form and we have to take advantage of that. ""Andres felt good in the half hour he had and is desperate for more."""

However, the four-time World Player of the Year cast doubt on his presence for the trip to the Bernabeu last week by claiming he would only return when he feels 100 percent fit. Messi has been left out by former Barca boss Gerardo Martino for Argentina's World Cup qualifiers against Brazil and Colombia on November 13 and 17 respectively. And Enrique insisted that with two thirds of the season still to play after El Clasico, it would be reckless to risk Messi suffering another serious injury. ""Within the team the only thing we are contemplating is that Leo Messi recovers 100 percent. That is the only thing that worries us,"" Enrique said on Friday. ""Whether that is for one particular date or another is indifferent. There is so much of the season to go that the most important thing is that he fully recovers."" Enrique was handed an injury boost on Friday, though, as midfielders Andres Iniesta and Sergi Roberto have both been passed fit to face Getafe on Sunday. Iniesta has been sidelined for a month since pulling up with a hamstring injury in a 2-1 win over Bayern Leverkusen, whilst the versatile Roberto returns after just 10 days out due to a groin strain.

His testimony before the court lasted barely five minutes as he recognised having committed the crime. Spanish state prosecutors alleged the former West Ham and Liverpool midfielder failed to declare over 1.5 million euros in earnings in 2011 and 2012 by ceding his image rights to companies he owns in Portugal and the United States. ""Mascherano admitted the facts of the two counts of tax fraud, so there was no need to interrogate him,"" said a judicial source. A court filing released last month confirmed Mascherano deposited nearly 1.75 million euros with the tax authorities on September 9 to repay the amount owed plus interest. The judge must now decide whether the case proceeds to trial. However, given that player has admitted his guilt and paid the amount owed plus interest it is possible his defence and the prosecution will come to an agreement in the form of a fine before going to trial. Mascherano is just the latest high-profile footballer to be scrutinised by the tax authorities in Spain over the declaration of money made through image rights. Barcelona and Argentina teammate Lionel Messi will stand trial alongside his father for alleged tax fraud totalling 4.16 million euros relating to his image rights between 2006 and 2009. Mascherano has also been in trouble on the field as he was handed a two-game ban on Wednesday for insulting the referee as he was sent-off in Barca's 3-1 win over Eibar last weekend."

DIS believe an agreement between Neymar and Barcelona saw 40 million euros paid to the player's management company to stop other clubs bidding for him and that they were deprived of a cut. The Spanish court asserts several top European clubs including Manchester City and Real Madrid had indeed been interested in signing the player. Former Barcelona president Sandro Rossell was forced to resign when the allegations emerged. Meanwhile Neymar helped Barcelona win La Liga, the Copa del Rey and the UEFA Champions League last season.

The Spanish court asserts several top European clubs including Manchester City and Real Madrid had indeed been interested in signing the player. Former Barcelona president Sandro Rossell was forced to resign when the allegations emerged. Meanwhile Neymar helped Barcelona win La Liga, the Copa del Rey and the UEFA Champions League last season. N and N is also being pursued by Brazilian tax authorities, and a Brazilian court last month froze $47 million (£34.5 million, 42 million euros) in assets belonging to the player."

Still without the injured Lionel Messi, Barca coach Luis Enrique has also opted to rest the likes of Neymar, Luis Suarez, Gerard Pique, Sergio Busquets and Claudio Bravo for the game against opponents from the region of Extremadura in western Spain. As a result, four players from Barca's B team, who like Villanovense compete in the Second Division B, have been promoted to the first team. Midfielders Sergi Samper and Gerard Gumbau, both 20 and who have already featured for the first team, are included along with attacking duo Aitor Cantalapiedra and Wilfrid Kaptoum, both aged 19. A slip-up would not be disastrous for Barca with the second leg to be played on December 2 at the Camp Nou, but Luis Enrique is prevented by competition rules from fielding too many reserve players. ""We are limited because we must always have seven first-team players on the field,"" he acknowledged. ""I would have liked to rely on more young players and give more of a rest to others.""

The former Liverpool man has made quite an impact in 12 months as his three goals took his tally to 35 on top of winning the treble of Champions League, La Liga and Copa del Rey last season. ""What he gives you is priceless, unnegotiable and if he is clinical like today then hats off to him,"" said Enrique. ""He is a fundamental and irreplaceable player for us."" Suarez came to his side's rescue after Barca had gone behind for the eighth time in 15 games this season to Borja Baston's 10th minute opener. ""We gifted the first goal and from then against a team like Eibar the difficulties start. ""It was difficult for us and we turned the game around more thanks to our intensity than playing at our best."" However, the biggest drawback of the evening for the European champions was Javier Mascherano's straight red card seven minutes from time. The Argentine was dismissed for protesting towards referee Carlos del Cerro Grande and could now miss next month's clash with Real Madrid should he receive the normal ban for such offences of four games. ""To miss four games would be harsh,"" added Enrique. ""We will need to evaluate what he said to him eye-to-eye, but it is difficult when you are going at 200 miles an hour."" Enrique also called on officials to concentrate more on cracking down on fouls than dissent. ""Games like today are an example. Eibar committed a lot more fouls, but we ended up with more bookings."""

It was the second such sanction in a matter of months as Barca were fined 30,000 euros for the same reason after their Champions League final success against Juventus. However, Bartomeu claimed he would drag UEFA through the courts for violating the club's fans' right to freedom of speech. ""Enough is enough,"" he told the club's annual general meeting on Sunday. ""We will appeal the sanction to UEFA's appeals committee and if they don't accept our case we will go to the Court of Arbitration for Sport. ""If even there our case isn't accepted, we will go to the High Court of Switzerland and, if necessary, the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg."" According to UEFA's disciplinary regulations, ""messages that are of a political, ideological, religious, offensive or provocative nature"" are not permitted. ""It threatens one of the most basic rights of democracy. That of the freedom of expression,"" added Bartomeu. ""They have sanctioned Barca for allowing, or not impeding, a number of members from expressing their feelings in a peaceful manner with a symbol, the Catalan flag for independence, that doesn't promote violence, that is not banned in any place and that represents a legitimate feeling of identification for many Barcelona fans and Catalans."" Barca have long been targeted as a symbol for those that want to see the rich north-eastern region of Catalonia break away from the rest of Spain. However, before recent regional elections in which pro-secession parties won the majority of the 135 seats in the Catalan parliament, Bartomeu insisted the club would remain neutral in the debate."

However, the accusations have been met with some scepticism in Spain due to its anonymous nature and the fact the referee for the match in question has yet to be chosen by the referee's committee. ""It is news that continues to surprise us and isn't nice to see, so I hope it is fully investigated to avoid any risk to our football,"" Enrique said on Saturday. Real Madrid coach Rafael Benitez dismissed the claims as ""not serious"" on Friday, but Enrique insisted it wouldn't shock him to find out the accusation is true. ""I am not going to speculate about these things. I repeat that it seems very serious. Referees already have a difficult enough job without adding more fuel to the fire. ""What seems logical and licit to me is that it is fully investigated to see if it is true or it is something that someone has invented. ""In this country I believe anything can happen."" On the field, Enrique confirmed that Andres Iniesta is in contention to make his return from injury against Eibar on Sunday after a month out with a hamstring injury. And the Barca boss also took the chance to send club legend Johan Cruyff the best wishes on the part of the playing and coaching staff after the Dutchman was diagnosed with lung cancer this week. ""It is very sad news. We wish him all the best and know he will overcome this as he has other problems throughout his life."""
1127,22/10/2015,15:53,"Messi not rushing recovery for Argentina, Clasico",Four-time World Player of the Year Lionel Messi has insisted he won't rush his recovery from knee ligament damage despite upcoming clashes with Brazil and Real Madrid for Argentina and Barcelona respectively.,"Messi suffered a torn internal collateral ligament in his left knee during Barca's 2-1 win over Las Palmas on September 26 that was expected to keep him out of action for up to eight weeks. A return to fitness within that timeframe would allow him to feature when Barca face Madrid at the Santiago Bernabeu on November 21. However, it is a race against time if he is to be included for Argentina's World Cup qualifiers at home to Brazil on November 13 or away to Colombia four days later. ""Being injured is the worst feeling in the world for a sportsman, but right from the start I accepted that I had an injury and that the only thing to do was to recover from it the best way possible,"" Messi told Yahoo Sports on Thursday. ""The most important thing for me is to be at 100 percent fitness. ""I am improving every day without setting myself any targets. I have always said that I don't set myself any dates because it isn't up to me. As much as I would like to play tomorrow, the doctors wouldn't let me. ""When they tell me that I have recovered completely will be the time that I will make my return onto the pitch."" The inspired of form of Neymar has allowed Barcelona to negotiate most of the obstacles presented since Messi went out as, despite a 2-1 defeat to Sevilla, they remain joint top of La Liga and well on course to qualify for the last 16 of the Champions League. However, Argentina missed their star man badly as they took just one point from their opening two games of World Cup qualifying, losing 2-0 at home to Ecuador before a 0-0 draw at to Paraguay earlier this month."

""We are on course to reach the target we have set of reaching a turnover of one billion euros."" A second treble of Champions League, La Liga and Copa del Rey in six years saw Barca's income grow 15 percent from 530 million euros the previous season. However, profits fell 36.5 percent from 41 million euros to just 15 million. The fall in profits was due to higher player bonuses as a result of such a successful season on the field and a busier than normal transfer window during 2014 due to a one-year ban on registering new players this year. Knowing they wouldn't be able to register new players between August 2014 and January 2016, Barca spent over 150 million euros on the likes of Luis Suarez, Ivan Rakitic, Claudio Bravo and Marc-Andre ter Stegen in the summer of 2014. ""Due to the FIFA ban we had to sign double what we are used to,"" added Monje. Debt also increased from 287 million euros to 328 million with Monje warning that the board will therefore be forced to show ""economic prudence next season."" However, Monje insisted that the club will be able to add to their short and injury-stricken squad should coach Luis Enrique request more reinforcements to go with Arda Turan and Aleix Vidal, who were signed in the summer from Atletico Madrid and Sevilla respectively, but won't be registered to play until January. Monje also claimed Barca ""will be able to increase the salary of players"" in reference to ongoing contract negotiations with Brazilian star Neymar. The club estimate that the current 2015/16 season will produce a 20 million euro profit with turnover increasing to 633 million euros thanks to new marketing deals signed with Asian and Latin American sponsors in recent years. In September, Barca's La Liga rivals Real Madrid announced a turnover of 660.6 million euros with an after-tax profit of 42 million."

It is alleged the referee in question then contacted the complainant to request he make the more difficult decisions in the match as the referee's performance is subject to more scrutiny by the media. Moreover, the complainant alleges he also received a phone call from a senior member of the referees' committee advising him it would be ""intelligent"" to follow the instructions for the progression of his career.

Neymar then teed up the Croatian for his second of the evening as Barca solidified their position atop Group E with seven points from their first three games. An incredible 4-4 draw between Bayer Leverkusen and Roma in the other game in the group on Tuesday leaves Barca three points ahead of the Germans with BATE still a point ahead of Roma in third. Neymar has taken the lead role since Lionel Messi was sidelined by a knee ligament injury three weeks ago and he nearly added to his four goals against Rayo Vallecano on Saturday within three minutes but his shot was too close to Sergei Chernik. Munir El Haddadi was standing in for Messi on the right side of the Barca attack and the Spanish under-21 international should have opened the scoring from a well-worked corner only to see his effort brilliantly repelled by Chernik. The visitors suffered another injury blow on 17 minutes when Roberto hobbled off, but his replacement Rakitic was to have a telling impact. Sergio Busquets was unfortunate to see a shot fly across goal and beyond the far post before Rakitic should have done better when unmarked from Dani Alves's cross as the recently crowned Belarusian champions held out until half-time. However, it took Barca just three minutes to open the scoring after the break as Neymar teed up Rakitic to fire his first goal of the season into the top corner. Neymar's search for the goal that his performance deserved continued as he sent a sweetly struck volley inches wide moments later. Yet he had an important part to play in the second goal as Rakitic received another pass from the Brazilian before coolly lifting the ball over the advancing Chernik."

Moreover, a Brazilian court last month froze $47 million (£34.5 million, 42 million euros) in assets belonging to the player over tax evasion allegations. ""We have three years left on the contract. We, or my family, are suffering an insecure tax situation that affects the planning of his career,"" Neymar Sr told Barcelona sports daily Sport. ""We need these issues to stop. How can we extend something if we don't have tax stability?"" Neymar isn't the only Barca player to be plagued by tax problems as four-time World Player of the Year Lionel Messi is to face trial over tax fraud over his image rights between 2007 and 2009. Fellow-Argentine Javier Mascherano is also to go before a judge later this month in a case related to the tax payments on his image rights. ""We are seeing various players suffering tax penalties. Why would I anticipate a renewal if I don't have judicial security that will back us to be able to work? I intend to wait and be calm to manage Neymar in the best way possible."" On the field Neymar produced one of best performances in a Barcelona shirt on Saturday as he scored four and assisted Luis Suarez for the Catalans' other goal in a 5-2 win over Rayo Vallecano. And his father insisted Barcelona is the best place for him to keep developing despite admitting that Manchester United had tried to sign the 23-year-old during the summer. ""They phoned Barcelona. They got a response that Neymar had a contract and that they would not sell him. People should be calm, Neymar still has three years on his contract."""

Barca boss Luis Enrique described the Brazilian star as ""unstoppable"" as he has taken on the responsibility of leading the European champions in Messi's absence. The player himself proudly declared his performance against Rayo as one of his best for the club as he left the Camp Nou with the match ball signed by all of his teammates at the weekend. ""Hopefully Neymar doesn't stop and we have to sign a lot more balls for him,"" said midfielder Ivan Rakitic. Messi scored twice when the sides last met in Belarus four years ago as Barca cruised to a 5-0 win. However, the impact of injuries to the Argentine, Iniesta and Rafinha, allied to a one-year ban on registering new players has left Barca with a very stretched squad for a run of six games in 19 days. A come from behind win against Bayer Leverkusen in their last European outing did at least put Barca back on course for the last 16 after opening their campaign with a 1-1 draw away to Roma. Enrique's men will be expected to pick up six points from their two clashes with BATE in the next fortnight with the safety net of knowing Messi will be fit for their final two group games at home to Roma and away to Leverkusen. ""We need to recover well, we have a lot of games in a row and that means we are doing well because you are in all competitions,"" added Rakitic. ""We will prepare well for Tuesday and if something hurts a little you just have to grit your teeth and keep going. That is all we can do."" BATE go into the game against the Spanish giants full of confidence after sealing a 10th consecutive league title on Friday with 2-0 win over Vitebsk. The Belarusians are also well in the fight to qualify for the knockout stages for the first time in their fifth year in the competition. A 3-2 win over Roma last time out means Alyaksandr Yermakovich's side are level with Leverkusen in second place in Group E, just a point behind Barca. BATE also have Champions League winning experience in their ranks in the form of Alexander Hleb, who was part of the Barca squad that won the competition in 2008/09."
1135,17/10/2015,23:48,Barca boss hails 'unstoppable' Neymar,"Barcelona coach Luis Enrique labelled star striker Neymar ""unstoppable"" after he scored four times as the European champions roared back from a goal down to beat Rayo Vallecano 5-2 on Saturday.","In the absence of the injured Lionel Messi, the Brazilian converted twice from the penalty spot in the first-half after he had been felled inside the area and then slotted home twice in a minute after the break before teeing up Luis Suarez for Barca's fifth of the evening. ""Since the start of the season he has been electric,"" said Enrique. ""He was very effective and practically unstoppable. With the speed he goes at inside the area the defenders stop him this way by committing a penalty or it is a goal."" Neymar's first four-goal haul in a Barca jersey also makes him La Liga's top scorer for the first time in his three-year spell in Spain with eight in seven league appearances so far this season. Victory takes Barca back level with Real Madrid at the top of table after Madrid were comfortable 3-0 winners over Levante earlier on Saturday. However, the Catalans didn't have it all their own way against an attack-minded Rayo side that often left themselves way too exposed against a Barca frontline containing the talents of Neymar and Suarez. ""I told my players and the press during the week that to play against Rayo is always difficult,"" added Enrique. ""I have never had an easy game against Rayo with Paco Jemez as coach. It is a game in which you have to be prepared for every ball and they try to make the game as uncomfortable as possible. ""We take the three points. I am very happy with the first-half performance, we played badly in the second-half, but curiously we were more clinical in the second than the first."" In a recurring theme of an up and down start to the campaign, Barca once again passed up a host of easy chances to put the game to bed before half time. And Enrique admitted his side will have to be more clinical in a busy three-week stretch that included six more games before Messi will be fit to return. ""It is curious. It has been a continuous problem this season, players of great quality missing chances. We continue working to make sure it doesn't happen again so that next time we have 10 chances we score 10 or nine."""

Real remain one of two unbeaten sides, alongside Celta Vigo, but the international break came at a cost for Madrid with Benzema, scorer of six goals in La Liga this term, sustaining a hamstring injury in France's 4-0 rout of Armenia, last week, while Luka Modric picked up a thigh strain while helping Croatia qualify for Euro 2016. Benitez will also be without right-back Dani Carvajal who was forced out of Spain's final two qualifiers with an ankle problem while there are doubts over the fitness of Sergio Ramos and Pepe as well. With Benzema sidelined, Real, who face Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions League next Wednesday before travelling to high-flying Celta Vigo, will be counting on Cristiano Ronaldo to rediscover his top form that saw him plunder an incredible 48 league goals last season. The Portuguese star was awarded the European Golden Shoe for a record fourth time on Tuesday as the top scorer in the continent's domestic leagues, but he has scored in just one of seven matches this campaign, albeit a stunning five-goal haul at Espanyol. ""I still feel good and young. I'm 30 years old and I want to play five or six more years, and during this time I want to do well and try to maintain my level from recent seasons,"" Ronaldo told Spanish daily Marca upon receiving his award. ""Real Madrid should always win trophies and this year is no exception. I'm always gunning for more,"" he added. Lionel Messi's absence has been keenly felt by Barcelona since the Argentine went down with knee ligament damage at the end of September. With Messi out until mid-November, Luis Suarez and Neymar have the arduous task of trying to help Barca overcome the loss of the four-time Ballon d'Or winner but it hasn't been plain sailing for the Catalans, who are aiming to bounce back from a 2-1 defeat at Sevilla when they take on Rayo Vallecano at home on Saturday. ""Nobody can replace Leo, and nobody should think they have to take on his role. Neymar, Sandro, Munir and myself, we all have to keep playing our role in attack,"" Luis Suarez told the La Liga website. ""Obviously, we feel the absence of the best player in the world, but we all have to chip in to help the team just like we've been doing these past few matches,"" added the Uruguayan. The game of the weekend in Spain pits table-topping Villarreal against third-placed Celta Vigo on Sunday. Both sides will want to restore their early-season fortunes after labouring into the international break -- Villarreal lost their unbeaten start at previously winless Levante while Celta's momentum has been somewhat stalled by two straight draws. ""It will be a difficult game against a direct rival. We want to pick up the three points because winning after the break is very important,"" defender Eric Bailly told Villarreal's club website. ""We've started very well and we must continue in this way,"" he added. Atletico, who are three points off the pace in fifth, visit Real Sociedad, Valencia are at home to Malaga, while Sevilla will bid to continue their recovery with a third straight win when they go to Eibar.

""The player should be punished with a suspension of six months from any official match,"" Santos demanded in their request to FIFA, the website reported. The player should also ""forfeit all benefits, directly or indirectly, received as part of the transfer"". GloboEsporte added that Santos are claiming Neymar ""acted in bad faith"" and violated the disciplinary code of world governing body FIFA when he moved to Spain. Brazil captain Neymar has been embroiled in controversy in recent weeks. In September, a Brazilian court froze $47 million (42 million euros) in assets belonging to the player over tax evasion allegations.

The pair were accused in 2013 of defrauding the taxman out of 4.16 million euros ($4.69 million) in taxes related to Messi's image rights between 2007 and 2009 through the creation of fake companies in Belize and Uruguay. No date has been set for the trial, which will take place in Vilanova i la Geltru, a town 50 kilometres (30 miles) south of Barcelona. Prosecutors had asked for the case against the four-time World Player of the Year to be dropped as the alleged fraud was in their estimation carried out by his father, who has managed his son's affairs since he was a child. They asked for Jorge Messi to be handed an 18-month prison sentence and a fine of half the defrauded amount. However, lawyers acting on behalf of the tax authorities pleaded for the player to also be tried and for both defendants to face a 22-month prison sentence. In any case, both are unlikely to end up in jail as sentences of less than two years are normally suspended for first time offences in Spain. ""There are rational signs that the criminality was committed by both accused parties,"" said the judge. Messi, 28, is the fourth richest sportsman in the world, according to Forbes magazine which estimates he earns almost $65 million a year. The news is just the latest blow for the Argentine, who will be out of action for six weeks due to knee ligament damage."

""It was a game in which both sides had a lot of chances, it is almost incredible that we go away from here having scored just one goal after seeing the ball ping around the opposition box,"" said Enrique. ""We have players of the highest level, you only have to look at their numbers. ""As coaches we always look to have the greatest number of chances possible because the individual talents of those players will finish them. That is the difference between those stars and other players. ""We are far from having our best numbers in that facet of the game in general from the whole team since the start of the season, but that will change for sure, I don't have any doubt."" Barca have now lost two of their last three league games and can be passed by either Real Madrid or Atletico Madrid in the table when the capital city rivals face each other on Sunday. And Enrique refused to take any solace in the fact that his side had dominated large spells of the game despite being shorn of Andres Iniesta as well as Messi. ""There is no one that can be happy at Barca when you lose. It doesn't matter that we created a lot of chances. The objective is always to win and if you don't you cannot be happy."" Suarez insisted that his boss hadn't given him or Neymar any special instructions on how to cope without Messi and admitted his culpability in passing up a series of first-half chances to put the visitors in front. ""We did enough to at least not lose the game,"" said the Uruguayan. ""In the first-half was when we missed our chance to go in front. They started the second-half very quickly. We reacted enough to get back into the game at 2-1 and had a lot of shots from outside the area that were blocked, but we did all we could to not lose the game. ""They scored a great first goal and you have to give credit to the opponents as well. The second one surprised us a bit more.

The hearing will be in Gava, the Barcelona suburb where Mascherano lives. Prosecutors allege the former West Ham and Liverpool player failed to declare over 1.5 million euros ($1.7 million) in earnings in 2011 and 2012 by ceding his image rights to companies he owns in Portugal and the United States. A court filing by prosecutors said Mascherano deposited nearly 1.75 million euros with the tax authorities on September 9 to repay the amount owed plus interest. He is just the latest high-profile footballer to be scrutinised by the tax authorities in Spain over the declaration of money made through image rights. Barcelona's star striker, four-time World Player of the Year Lionel Messi, also appeared before a judge at the court in Gava in 2013. He and his father were accused of defrauding the public purse of four million euros after his image rights were ceded to companies in Belize and Uruguay. Bayern Munich midfielder Xabi Alonso last week denied any wrongdoing after Spanish newspaper El Mundo claimed he was being investigated for a similar scheme."
1141,30/09/2015,02:36,Barca achievements deserve more credit - Luis Enrique,Barcelona boss Luis Enrique launched a staunch defence of his players after they came from behind without the injured Lionel Messi to beat Bayer Leverkusen 2-1 on Tuesday.,"Goals in the last 10 minutes from Sergi Roberto and Luis Suarez propelled the European champions to the top of Champions League Group F after Kyriakos Papadopoulos had headed the visitors into a deserved half-time lead. ""It was a difficult night. It was our second game without Leo Messi, the second game without our best player, an irreplaceable player, and it is the second game the team has won,"" said Enrique. ""I am very happy for what the players have achieved. They turned around a very difficult game. We can be more precise, but no one can say Barca relax and don't give everything."" Despite Messi's absence, the Camp Nou crowd were less than patient as boos rang out at the half-time whistle. Enrique pleaded for more understanding from the club's supporters at a difficult time with a host of young players drafted in to cover a mounting injury crisis. ""I think this team deserve more credit for what they have won recently and how they carry themselves. ""They try until the last minute and if then they deserve to be booed then fine, but we are much stronger in the delicate moments if they support us. ""At 2-1 we didn't need their support, we needed it a 0-1. ""I would like the few people that do boo not to do it because we hear them and we need the support of everyone."" On top of Messi and Brazilian international Rafinha, Barca are set to be without Andres Iniesta for a month after he pulled up with a hamstring injury after an hour. ""It is very sad news for us because he is a fundamental player for us as everyone knows,"" added Enrique. ""These are hurdles in our way that we have to overcome and I have confidence in the players that will come in."" A hectic pre-season tour and three early season clashes with Sevilla and Athletic Bilbao in the UEFA and Spanish Super Cup respectively have been blamed for Barca's raft of injuries. However, defender Javier Mascherano called on those like Roberto and Munir El Haddadi, who made a significant impact from the bench against Leverkusen, to take their chance in the first team. ""Obviously we are in a difficult situation with a number of important players that are injured. ""That is football and that is why we have a squad to keep going in these moments. ""It is not just 11 or 12 players that win competitions, there are reserves behind and now some of those that wouldn't have had so many minutes will get their chance. ""It is an unusual season. You always have these injuries throughout the season, but after the more serious injuries for Rafinha and Leo is it much more worrying that Andres is now injured too. ""Those of us that are fit need to keep going and know that whilst we win games there is less time left until those important players return."""

The European champions are already without four-time World Player of the Year Lionel Messi for the next two months. Barcelona refused to state how long Iniesta would be sidelined for, but Catalan sports daily Sport reported the 31-year-old will be out for a month. That would see Iniesta miss Saturday's visit to Sevilla and home games against Rayo Vallecano and Eibar, as well as Spain's final two Euro 2016 qualifiers against Luxembourg and Ukraine. ""The information regarding Iniesta is sad, firstly for the player himself and also because (the injuries) now seem like a joke,"" said Barca boss Luis Enrique. ""It is a handicap and we will show that we are competitive. I am very happy with how the team coped with it and I ask for more confidence to be shown in the players."" With Brazilian international Rafinha ruled out for at least six months with a cruciate ligament injury, Enrique now has just seven midfielders and strikers available. The blow is just the latest strain on a Barca squad hampered by injuries and a year-long ban from registering new players which will expire in January. Barca appealed to FIFA to have Turkish midfielder Arda Turan added to their squad due to the seriousness of Rafinha's injury. Turan and Aleix Vidal were both signed during the summer transfer window, but can't be registered to play until January. However, FIFA believe such a move would be in contravention of their rules."

1144,29/09/2015,22:47,Suarez inspires Messi-less Barca fightback,Luis Suarez rounded off a stirring fightback by European champions Barcelona as they shrugged off the absence of the injured Lionel Messi to beat Bayer Leverkusen 2-1 on Wednesday.,"Kyriakos Papadopoulos had headed the visitors into a deserved half-time lead as Barca struggled to open up the Germans without Messi's magic touch. However, despite also losing Andres Iniesta to injury, Suarez turned the game around in the final 10 minutes as Sergi Roberto tapped home the rebound after the Uruguayan's initial effort had been saved. And the former Liverpool striker thumped home a stunning effort to hand Barca a hard-fought three points two minutes later. Victory takes Barca top of Group E, a point ahead of Leverkusen and BATE Borisov, who were 3-2 winners over Roma on Wednesday. Leverkusen made the most of Barca's edgy start as former Real Madrid striker Javier Hernandez forced Marc-Andre ter Stegen into a smart save at his near post inside two minutes. Ivan Rakitic had Barca's first effort on target, but the Croatian placed his header too close to Bernd Leno. Sandro Ramirez was the man given the unenviable task of replacing Messi and nearly repaid coach Luis Enrique's faith as he played a lovely one-two with Suarez before Leno pulled off a spectacular save to turn the 20-year-old's effort behind. However, Leverkusen's speed on the break was a constant threat and Kevin Kampl should have done better on two occasions as he curled the ball wide and was then denied by a brave block from Gerard Pique with an even clearer sight of goal. Leverkusen finally took a deserved lead on 22 minutes when Hakan Calhanoglu's brilliant in-swinging corner caught Ter Stegen off guard and Papadopoulos nodded home. The German international made amends moments later as he stood up to prevent Karim Bellarabi from doubling the visitors' lead. Much had been expected of Neymar in Messi's absence, but the Brazilian had been kept very quiet until his deflected effort hit the post six minutes before the break and Sandro's follow-up effort somehow deflected off Papadopoulos and behind for a corner. Hernandez had a golden chance to put the game beyond the hosts at the start of the second-half but blazed over when unmarked just 12 yards out. At the other end, the chances began to arrive for Barca as Sandro again fired wide before Neymar pushed an effort off target. However, the bad news continued for Luis Enrique when Iniesta pulled up with a muscle injury just after the hour mark to add to the Catalans' mounting injury crisis. Yet, Barca reacted like champions to turn the game around as Roberto pounced after Leno had saved Suarez's initial effort to level 10 minutes from time. And moments later substitute Munir El Haddadi squared for Suarez to smash the ball high past the helpless Leno for a memorable winner."
1145,28/09/2015,20:44,Injured Messi 'irreplaceable' for Barca boss,Barcelona coach Luis Enrique admitted it is impossible to replace Lionel Messi as the European champions face up to living without the four-time World Player of the Year for up to eight weeks.,"Messi suffered a tear in the medial collateral ligament of his left knee during Saturday's 2-1 win over Las Palmas and looks set to miss Barca's next eight games. ""Thank you all for your supportive messages. For anyone who loves football, the hardest thing is not to be on the pitch. Now it's time to recover properly to come back,"" Messi posted on his official Facebook page on Monday. ""A player like Leo is irreplaceable,"" Luis Enrique said on Monday ahead of his side's return to Champions League action at home to Bayer Leverkusen on Tuesday. ""In pre-season none of Leo, Neymar or (Luis) Suarez played, but our idea of how to play didn't change. It is a challenge for us to be without the best player in the world, but it also provides an incentive for us."" Messi is expected to miss La Liga games against Sevilla, Rayo Vallecano, Eibar, Getafe and Villarreal, as well as Leverkusen's visit and two clashes with BATE Borisov in the Champions League. However, Luis Enrique is confident the 28-year-old will be fit for Barca's first meeting with Real Madrid this season on November 21 at the Santiago Bernabeu. ""Leo came in yesterday for the medical check-up and he looked good, he was in high spirits,"" added the coach. ""Time is in his favour."" Midfielder Ivan Rakitic is also hopeful that Messi's absence will act as a spur for his teammates to take more responsiblity in the coming weeks. ""Messi's injury affects us a lot. It hurts not to have the best player in the world, but it also serves as motivation to win the games for him,"" said the Croatian international. ""We hope he returns as soon as possible."" Barca were held to a 1-1 draw in their first Champions League game of the campaign away at Roma a fortnight ago and Luis Enrique insisted it is imperative they get all three points against group leaders Leverkusen at the Camp Nou. ""I don't know if Leo's absence will be a boost for Leverkusen, but for us it is a key game against one of the strongest opponents in the group. ""They are a very intense team, they defend and press well and physically they are very strong. I am sure they will cause us a lot of problems."" Despite the body-blow of Messi's absence, there is some good news on the injury front for Barca as both goalkeeper Claudio Bravo and left-back Jordi Alba trained on Monday and are expected to be available for selection."
1146,28/09/2015,16:07,Tax fraud investigation launched against Mascherano,"A charge on two counts of tax fraud was launched against Barcelona player Javier Mascherano by Spain's public prosecution service, a court filing revealed on Monday.","The Argentine is alleged to have failed to declare over 1.5 million euros ($1.7 million, £1.1 million) in 2011 and 2012 made through his image rights by ceding the rights to companies he owns in Portugal and the United States with favourable tax rates. The filing also confirmed Mascherano deposited just short of 1.75 million euros with the tax authorities on September 9 this year to repay the amount owed plus interest. Mascherano is just the latest high-profile footballer to be scrutinised by the tax authorities in Spain over the declaration of money made through image rights. Four-time World Player of the Year Lionel Messi appeared before a judge in 2013 after he and his father were accused of defrauding the public purse of 4.16 million euros ($4.7 million, £3 million) after his image rights were ceded to companies in Belize and Uruguay. Bayern Munich midfielder Xabi Alonso also categorically denied any wrongdoing last week after Spanish newspaper El Mundo claimed he was being investigated for a scheme similar to that used by Mascherano."

1148,28/09/2015,01:40,Barca life without Messi begins with Leverkusen,European champions Barcelona begin a two-month stretch without Lionel Messi when Bayer Leverkusen visit the Camp Nou on Tuesday hoping to take advantage of the Argentine's absence.,"Messi suffered a torn left knee ligament as Barca squeezed past Las Palmas 2-1 at the weekend. Luis Suarez carried the mantle after Messi's departure with a double to ensure the Catalans got back to winning ways after being hammered 4-1 by Celta Vigo in their previous outing. And much more will be needed of Suarez and Neymar in the coming weeks as Barca's stretched and injury-ridden squad faces up to eight games without Messi. ""He is the best in the world and logically we will miss him a lot,"" said midfielder Sergio Busquets. With Claudio Bravo, Thomas Vermaelen and Rafinha also sidelined by injury, coach Luis Enrique has just 15 senior outfield players to choose from in the coming weeks. ""We are having a lot of bad luck with injuries, even more so when we can't register players."" Barca are serving a one-year ban from registering new players for breaking FIFA's rules on the signing of minors. And the club's appeal to world football's governing body to register one of their two summer signings, Arda Turan and Aleix Vidal, due to the injury crisis has fallen on deaf ears. ""It is an extra test and motivation for our team,"" said Enrique. ""In these moments is when you see what we are made of and I have no doubt that we are going to be fine."" Leverkusen have particularly bad memories of being faced with Messi's magic as he scored five in a 7-1 humiliation the last time the Germans visited Barcelona in the last-16 back in 2012. However, the club's sporting director Rudi Voeller claimed he wasn't pleased to hear Messi will be out of action. ""That hurts to hear, he's always a joy to watch,"" said the former Germany international. Leverkusen lead Group E after a 4-1 win over BATE Borisov on matchday one, whilst Roma held Barca 1-1 in the Italian capital. Coach Roger Schmidt left winger Kevin Kampl, ex-Manchester United and Real Madrid striker Javier Hernandez and free-kick specialist Hakan Calhanoglu out of the starting line-up as Leverkusen won 3-0 away at Werder Bremen on Saturday. Kampl came on to score the third goal after Swiss forward Admir Mehmedi and Germany Under-21 winger Julian Brandt had netted for the visitors. ""We'll give it our all in Barcelona,"" said former Borussia Dortmund forward Kampl. ""This is the sort of game you dream about as a footballer."" Messi's absence may avoid embarrassment for the Germans off the field as well. Manuel Friedrich and Michal Kadlec were forced to auction the Messi shirts they received from the four-time World Player of the Year for charity by Voeller after fighting over the right to take the souvenir home three years ago."
1149,26/09/2015,20:49,Barca trip tough for Bayer -- even without Messi,Bayer Leverkusen captain Lars Bender says holders Barcelona still present his side with a huge challenge away in Tuesday's Champions League group match -- even without injured star Lionel Messi.,"The Barcelona playmaker is expected to miss up to eight weeks with a knee injury, but Leverkusen face a daunting task despite beating Werder Bremen 3-0 away on Saturday to climb to fifth in the German league. Messi's injury has little impact to Leverkusen's status as underdogs at the Camp Nou. ""Barcelona have enough top players in the squad and the game remains a huge challenge,"" said Bender. The Germany midfielder says his side must show some courage in Barcelona having been mauled 7-1 on their previous visit in 2012, when Messi bagged five goals. ""We're found our way back on track, but now we have to attempt to be more courageous,"" said Bender, who has shaken off a knee injury. Goals by Swiss forward Admir Mehmedi, winger Kevin Kampl and Germany Under-21 talent Julian Brandt sealed Leverkusen's win in Bremen. ""Every footballer dreams of playing in matches like this, we all know how strong the opponent will be, but we want to bring our own game to their pitch,"" said Kampl, who scored his first league goal since his transfer from Borussia Dortmund."" Leverkusen coach Roger Schmidt was delighted with Bender's performance alongside fellow Germany international Christoph Kramer in the defensive midfield. ""I was especially pleased that we gave the opposition hardly any chances and it is important for us that Lars Bender is fit,"" said Schmidt. At least Messi's injury guarantees there will be no repeat of the embarrassing shirt-swapping affair of 2012. When Barcelona beat Leverkusen 3-1 in their last 16, first-leg win three years ago, Bayer defender Michal Kadlec asked Messi for his shirt at half-time, but a row broke out when teammate Manuel Friedrich, who was marking Messi, claimed it for himself in the break. Kadlec, who scored the Germans' only goal, eventually got another shirt off Messi at full time, but Leverkusen sporting director Rudi Voller made the pair auction the shirts for charity after getting wind of what had happened."

The estimated time out will be seven to eight weeks,"" Barcelona said in a statement. Messi, 28, looks set to be sidelined for at least eight Barca games, as well as Argentina's first four 2018 World Cup qualifiers, including a meeting a home to Brazil on November 13. Moreover, he is now a huge doubt for the first El Clasico of the season away to Real Madrid on November 21. ""Firstly, it is always sad when a player gets injured. It is without doubt the worst thing in football for the players,"" said Barcelona coach Luis Enrique. ""Obviously, when it is Leo Messi even more so for the weight he carries amongst our group. ""It is logical in football that players will get injured and we have to know how to overcome it. I am sure we will perform at a good level."" Barca face Sevilla, Rayo Vallecano, Eibar, Getafe and Villarreal in La Liga before visiting the Bernabeu. The European champions host Bayer Leverkusen in the Champions League on Tuesday and will also have to do without Messi for back-to-back games against BATE Borisov. ""It is a test and extra motivation for this team. We need to accept the challenge and improve our performance because we can do that,"" added Enrique. ""I haven't looked at the calendar. I have only seen that we play on Tuesday against Leverkusen. That is the only thing that interests me. ""In any moment, not just in football, when everything goes well and everything flows it is very easy to perform well. I am sure we will have good results due to the quality of this team."" Messi clashed with Las Palmas defender Pedro Bigas as he tried to turn the ball home inside the area and suffered a blow to his left knee in the process. He briefly returned to the field after receiving treatment, but was clearly unable to run freely before he was replaced by Munir El Haddadi. Video images then emerged of Messi limping heavily as he left hospital after undergoing tests. It is the first serious injury Messi has suffered since a hamstring injury kept him out for the final two months of 2013. The blow is just the latest strain on a Barca squad hampered by injuries and a year-long ban from registering new players which will expire in January. Midfielder Rafinha has already been ruled out for at least six months after suffering cruciate ligament damage earlier this month. Barca appealed to FIFA to have Turkish midfielder Arda Turan added to their squad due to the seriousness of Rafinha's injury. Turan and Aleix Vidal were both signed during the summer transfer window, but can't be registered to play until January. However, FIFA believe such a move would be in contravention of their rules."

1153,25/09/2015,14:18,Barca coach calls for defensive improvement,Barcelona coach Luis Enrique admitted his side's defending needs to improve drastically after the European champions suffered a 4-1 thrashing at the hands of Celta Vigo in midweek.,"Defeat in Vigo was Barca's first in La Liga this season, but they have now conceded four goals three times in just nine matches to start the campaign after losing 4-0 to Athletic Bilbao in the first leg of the Spanish Super Cup and overcoming Sevilla 5-4 in the UEFA Super Cup. Enrique's men conceded just 37 goals in 60 games in all competitions on their way to winning the treble of La Liga, Champions League and Copa del Rey last season. However, they have already conceded 16 times so far this season. ""It is clear that we need to need to improve defensively, but that doesn't just mean the defence and the goalkeeper, it means all 11 players on the field must defend better,"" said Enrique. The Barca boss was full of praise for his old side Celta, but is hoping for a reaction from his side when they host Las Palmas on Saturday. ""It was a great Celta performance that demanded a better one from Barca,"" he added. ""In the dressing room we hope that the defeat in Vigo will serve as a stimulant to get back to winning ways and makes us realise how hard it is to win in this league."" Barca will again be without the injured Claudio Bravo, Rafinha and Thomas Vermaelen. However, left-back Jordi Alba should return after overcoming the neck injury which kept him out of the defeat in Vigo."

""When a team has been better than you there is no more to add,"" said Enrique, who took charge of Celta during the 2013-14 season before joining Barca. ""I prefer to be beaten by a team that plays like Celta, without any traps and purely on football grounds. ""I congratulate them and urge them to continue playing like that."" Barca have now conceded four goals in a game three times in just nine matches this season. However, Javier Mascherano claimed it was being outplayed that concerned him more than last season's treble winners' defensive woes. ""It always hurts to lose at Barca. We have a thick skin and all we can do now is think about Saturday and remember what happened last season,"" said the Argentine. ""There can be a day when the opponent is better and beats you to every ball. Part of it is our fault and part of it is to their credit. ""We don't have any excuses. They beat us soundly and we have to keep working. The most worrying thing is that we feel outplayed."" Celta also stunned Barca 1-0 at the Camp Nou last season and their coach Eduardo Berizzo believes the fearlessness of their performance was worthy of such a sensational result. ""There were special circumstances and a bit of luck that went our way,"" he said. ""Our idea is to play the way we did tonight, trying to take the game to the opponent no matter who we are playing. ""The players have delighted the fans. Football and the people present tonight were the winners. ""I congratulate the players because they were perfect."" Barca's defeat allowed Real Madrid to go top of the table for the first time this season as they were 2-1 victors at Athletic Bilbao thanks to Karim Benzema's double. The Frenchman scored either side of Sabin Merino's second-half equaliser to take his tally to six goals in his last five games. ""We knew how difficult it would be because we knew how much the fans would drive Athletic forward,"" said Madrid boss Rafael Benitez. ""We showed our quality in the first-half and then our character and intensity in the second. ""To win like this reinforces the confidence in the team."""
1155,23/09/2015,22:01,Barca thrashed 4-1 by Aspas-inspired Celta Vigo,Barcelona's 100 percent start to La Liga season was brought to a stunning end as Celta Vigo moved top of the table with a stunning 4-1 victory on Wednesday.,"The side formerly managed by Barca boss Luis Enrique were deservedly given a 2-0 half-time lead by excellent finishes from Nolito and former Liverpool striker Iago Aspas. Barca's first league defeat since February was sealed when Aspas struck again on the counter-attack early in the second period. Neymar pulled a goal back for the visitors, but Celta rightly had the final word as John Guidetti rounded off a famous win with the Galicians' fourth nine minutes from time. It is the third time Barca have conceded four goals in just nine games this season having been thrashed 4-0 by Athletic Bilbao in the Spanish Super Cup and beaten Sevilla 5-4 in the UEFA Super Cup. Barca were back close to full strength for what Enrique warned would be one of their toughest tests of the season as Gerard Pique returned from suspension, whilst Andres Iniesta and Luis Suarez were restored to the starting line-up after being rested for Sunday's 4-1 win over Levante. Despite Celta's bright start it was the visitors who had the first two chances, but both Lionel Messi and Neymar placed efforts too close to Sergio Alvarez who repelled the ball to safety. Celta took the lead on 25 minutes when Nolito found space inside the area and curled the ball perfectly high into the far corner to join Cristiano Ronaldo as the league's top scorer with five goals. Things got worse for the European champions just four minutes later when an error from Pique allowed Nolito to play in Aspas, who remained calm before expertly clipping the ball over the helpless Marc-Andre ter Stegen. Aspas had a great chance to put the game to bed five minutes into the second-half, but this time he pulled his shot just wide of the target. The hosts then had to withstand a brief Barca onslaught as Messi struck the post from Iniesta's cut-back. Pique then headed just over and Messi saw another powerful effort turned behind by Alvarez. Yet, from the resulting corner, Celta's lightning speed and accuracy shone through as Aspas hooked the ball over Dani Alves and sprinted half the length of the field before slotting home his second of the night. Nolito should have made it 4-0 when he side-footed just wide as Celta broke dangerously again from another Barca corner. However, Celta were also grateful to Alvarez for keeping Barca at bay as he made a brilliant stop to prevent Neymar pulling a goal back. The Brazilian did finally get Barca on the scoresheet as he controlled a fantastic pass from Messi before smashing the ball home.

1157,23/09/2015,06:05,"Barca, the jewel in Catalan independence crown","Catalonia may not be a state, but it can count on a small and symbolic red and blue army in the form of European football champions Barcelona.","Despite their international projection, Barca remain a banner for Catalan nationalists who are now seeking independence from Spain. Although the club has preferred not to be involved in regional elections on Sunday that could launch a process towards secession from Spain, the electoral campaign could have serious ramifications for it. If Catalonia becomes independent, Barca wouldn't be able to play in the Spanish league, the president of the league warned this week. That poses a dilemma for the Barca fanbase who convert the club's 99,000-capacity Camp Nou stadium into a yellow, red and blue mosaic of pro-independence flags every weekend and where chants for independence are heard more than the name of their idol, the Argentine Lionel Messi. In recent Spanish Cup finals, Barca fans have greeted the Spanish national anthem with a storm of boos and whistles, the last of which in May at the Camp Nou saw the club fined 66,000 euros ($74,000). As a placard permanently hung at one end of the stadium reads: ""Catalonia is not Spain."" Spanish writer and columnist Manuel Vazquez Montalban defined Barca as a ""symbolic and unarmed Catalan army,"" especially during the dictatorship of General Francisco Franco between 1939 and 1975 which repressed the Catalan language and nationalism. ""The club was a bastion of freedom. People could speak in Catalan in public without fear and even listen to songs in Catalan,"" says historian Carles Santacana, who points out that in 1918 the club demanded that Catalonia be self-governed. This political function of Barcelona, which softened during the first decades of democracy post-Franco, began to take shape once more during the 2003-2010 mandate of Joan Laporta as the club's president, which coincided with a pro-independence boom in the region. In 2014 the club joined a group of institutions that demanded an independence referendum and has lent its stadium on various occasions to secessionist events. Two years ago, Barca's away strip bore the red and yellow colours of the Catalan flag. ""Currently, there is a coup within Barca. There is an ideological kidnap of the club that has allowed pro-independence leanings into its offices,"" said Ramon Miravitllas, journalist and writer of the book ""The Political Function of Barcelona"". ""But there is a significant group of fans who don't want independence and now feel out of place and deserted."" Politics has reached the dressing room. Various players have publicly supported the celebration of a referendum in the region, such as club legend Xavi Hernandez, who now plays for Qatari side Al Sadd, and central defender Gerard Pique who attended a huge independence march on September 11 in Barcelona. ""There is a very big movement and it ought to be listened to,"" said Pique, who has recently been booed by his own fans when playing for Spain. Pep Guardiola, Barca's most successful ever coach, is making a symbolic stand for election for the independence coalition ""Together For Yes"", which leads in the polls. Ahead of the elections, the club has decided to remain officially neutral. ""Barca has shown it is outside the electoral campaign. We have always spoken about sport, we will not campaign,"" club president Josep Maria Bartomeu said last Sunday. Amid countless warnings from Madrid against independence, the president of the Spanish league, Javier Tebas, said: ""Catalan teams could not take part in any competition in Spain unless they stayed in Spain."" If that happened, Spain's sports secretary Miguel Cardenal said, Barca may struggle to ""reach the last 16 or quarter-finals of the Champions League."""
1158,22/09/2015,14:38,Barca still hoping for new player clearance,Barcelona coach Luis Enrique has said the European champions will do everything in their power to try and register one of Arda Turan or Aleix Vidal before January.,"Both players were signed by the Catalan giants in the summer, but at the moment can't feature until the new year. Barca were handed a one-year ban on registering new players, effective from January this year, after breaking FIFA rules on the signing of foreign players under the age of 16. The club hope to take advantage of a legal loophole in the Spanish Football Federation's (RFEF) rules that allows a new player to be registered in the case of another squad member suffering a serious injury forcing them out of action for five months or more. Brazilian midfielder Rafinha is set to miss the rest of the season after suffering cruciate ligament damage in Barca's 1-1 draw at Roma last week. ""We know the club will always be looking for the best option and look for all the possibilities that could benefit us,"" the coach said on Tuesday. FIFA confirmed that both Barca and the RFEF have contacted them over the matter. ""We can confirm that we have been contacted by the club and the RFEF. As the matter is currently under analysis, please understand we cannot comment further,"" a FIFA spokesperson said when contacted by AFP on Tuesday. Luis Enrique's latest stance is in stark contrast to his comments last weekend that FIFA had already rejected such a proposal from the club."

If Catalonia broke away from Spain, as nationalists have vowed to do if they win Sunday's regional election, La Liga ""would be a league without Catalan clubs"", he told Spanish television. As well as Barca and its football, basketball and handball teams, such an exclusion would affect others such as Espanyol, the other big top division side from Barcelona. Catalan nationalist leaders have vowed to declare independence within 18 months if they win the vote on September 27. Polls show they may win a majority in the regional parliament."

Madrid escaped with all three points on Saturday thanks to a string of saves from Keylor Navas as he stretched his unbeaten streak to five games. The Costa Rica international is now within 10 minutes of breaking Iker Casillas's club record for the longest start to a campaign without conceding a goal. ""Things are going well. I am happy that people value my work and it is an honour to be at this club,"" he told the club's website. ""As a kid I dreamed of being here and it fills me with satisfaction to be part of Real Madrid's history. The hard work has paid off and this is the way that will take us towards winning big things."" Madrid will again be without Gareth Bale, James Rodriguez and Danilo through injury, whilst Sergio Ramos is a major doubt due to a dislocated shoulder. Athletic have proven their ability to perform on the big occasion as they beat Barcelona 5-1 on aggregate to win the Spanish Super Cup at the start of the campaign and also beat Madrid at home last season. However, they have taken just three points from their opening four league games as a side shorn of the rested Raul Garcia and Aritz Aduriz were beaten 3-1 by Villarreal on Sunday. ""We haven't started well. Three points in the league isn't enough and it is the league that tells you whether you are playing well or not,"" said Athletic coach Ernesto Valverde. ""I know what is coming now, but we need to win."" League leaders Barca also face a tough task to maintain their perfect start to the campaign when they travel to unbeaten Celta Vigo on Wednesday. Barca will be back close to full strength as Gerard Pique is available for the first time in La Liga this season after serving a four-game ban, whilst Andres Iniesta and Luis Suarez will return after being rested for Sunday's 4-1 win over Levante. However, they will face a Celta side full of confidence after a 2-1 win away at Sevilla moved them up to fourth. ""They are one of the most enjoyable teams to watch not just in Spain but in Europe,"" said Barca boss Luis Enrique about his old side. ""If you like football, you should watch Celta. It doesn't matter who they play against, they play their game with attacking players and an offensive mentality."" Atletico Madrid could move to the top of the table for 24 hours at least when they host Getafe in a Madrid derby at the Vicente Calderon on Tuesday. Los Rojiblancos showed their strength in depth as Fernando Torres and Angel Correa came off the bench to hand them a 2-0 win at Eibar on Saturday. However, despite their impressive close season in the transfer market, defender Jose Maria Gimenez has insisted it is being the best of the rest outside Barca and Real that remains their priority. ""We are going for third place and if during the season we can challenge then we don't have to lie about it. We need to compete like we did in the year we won the league."" David Moyes also faces a crucial match that could define his future at Real Sociedad when the Basques travel to Granada on Tuesday. Sociedad have taken just two points from their opening four games with discontent towards the former Manchester United manager heightened by Saturday's 3-2 defeat at home to Espanyol.

Pique wrote on Twitter in a reply to a fan who had asked the Spanish defender's reaction to Florenzi's long-distance strike that caught Barcelona 'keeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen off guard. ""When I saw the goal, I didn't believe it! One of the best goals I've received in my career."" On what was Lionel Messi's 100th Champions League appearance, the Argentinian had been hoping to close the gap on rival Cristiano Ronaldo's new record tally for goals in the competition. Both had been tied on 77 but a hat-trick by the Real Madrid striker in a 4-0 win over Shakhtar Donetsk on Tuesday saw him pull three goals clear of Messi. Messi was a class act throughout an entertaining Group E encounter at the Stadio Olimpico, where Roma were forced to defend for most of the night and take their chances on the counter-attack. But the Barcelona star was upstaged by Florenzi's strike, which sports daily La Gazzetta dello Sport calculated at a distance of 55.49 metres. After collecting the ball in his own half, Florenzi carried it over the halfway line near the right touchline, looked up and, when he saw the Barcelona 'keeper 15 metres out of his goal, launched a drive that went over Ter Stegen and in off his far post. The 24-year-old Florenzi admitted to stunning himself. ""It was a great goal, you could see that by the reaction on my face after it went in,"" he said, admitting he decided to take a pot shot after realising he had no other choices. ""I saw (Edin) Dzeko but couldn't get the ball to him. So I said to myself, 'shoot'. The worst thing that can happen is it goes out of play. Then I saw it go in the back of the net."" Barcelona coach Luis Enrique, meanwhile, said he was partly to blame and claimed Florenzi had been lucky. ""He (Florenzi) is a good player, but he was a little lucky,"" said Luis Enrique, who spent a season as coach of Roma in 2011/12. ""He took a chance and scored a great goal. Hats off to him, but it was partly my fault because we tell our goalkeepers to play like that. But that will be the last goal like that we concede."" Florenzi's strike has relaunched debate about where exactly he should play. Known for his versatility, at Roma he has played on the wing, in midfield and at right-back. Team-mate Daniele De Rossi said: ""He's scored a goal that is going to be televised over and over. He can become one of the best right-backs in the world."""
1165,17/09/2015,12:24,Barcelona's Rafinha set to miss rest of season,Barcelona have confirmed that midfielder Rafinha Alcantara may miss the rest of the season having ruptured a knee ligament in a nasty tackle against Roma on Wednesday.,"The 22-year-old had been on the field a matter of minutes, after coming on as a second-half substitute in the 1-1 draw in Champions League Group E, when he suffered the injury in a challenge by Roma's Radja Nainggolan. ""Tests this morning have revealed that FC Barcelona midfielder Rafael Alcantara -- also known as 'Rafinha' -- has suffered a tear to the anterior cruciate ligament in his right leg. He will undergo surgery in the coming days,"" Barcelona said in a statement. Barca coach Luis Enrique had already warned after the game in the Italian capital that ""it looks like an ugly injury, very ugly, to the knee. He caught him from behind and it is the most unfortunate news of the day."" The reigning European champions did not indicate how long Rafinha may face on the sidelines but the recovery period required after such an injury means he could miss the rest of the season."
1166,17/09/2015,02:40,Enrique frustrated as Roma hold dominant Barca,Barcelona coach Luis Enrique admitted his frustration at Champions League Group E rivals Roma after a solid defensive display earned the Italians a hard-fought point from a thrilling 1-1 draw on Wednesday.,"Barely four months after sweeping Juventus aside 3-1 to win the final in Berlin, Barcelona set their sights on beating another Serie A side into submission as they look to become the first side since AC Milan in 1990 to win back-to-back European titles. But despite a dominant performance throughout, the Catalans were left frustrated as Bayer Leverkusen, 4-1 winners over BATE Borisov, went two points clear at the top of the group. In what was Lionel Messi's 100th Champions League appearance, the Argentine was upstaged by Alessandro Florenzi's stunning leveller for the hosts from just inside the halfway line on 31 minutes. Enrique, who spent a fruitless season as coach of Roma in the 2011-2012 season, said: ""I would have expected us to come up against a more attacking team. Instead, they chose a different approach. He added: ""I'm satisfied with how we played, we created a lot of chances and when your opponents close up at the back it's not easy."" Barcelona striker Luis Suarez said: ""We know Italian teams. They close up at the back and it becomes very difficult to find space to score goals. ""We controlled the game in possession and created a lot of chances. They managed to score from distance, but they were lucky there too."" Given Barcelona's firepower, and the fact Roma were humiliated by a 7-1 thrashing at the hands of Bayern Munich in January, the Giallorossi had every reason to go on the defensive. Despite a series of counter-attacks by Egyptian winger Mohamed Salah offering promise early on, Barcelona gradually settled into their trademark possession and passing game to leave the Stadio Olimpico eerily silent as fans watched in awe. A day after seeing Real Madrid striker Cristiano Ronaldo overtake their shared record of 77 goals in the competition with a hat-trick in a 4-0 win over Shakhtar Donetsk, Messi was on the hunt for goals. But despite dipping and skipping his way past opponents to set up chance after chance, Roma's defence -- and a superb display by the hosts' goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny before he suffered an injury early in the second half -- Messi was not to be satisfied. Messi's most telling contribution came on 21 minutes, when he backed into Lucas Digne, causing the Frenchman to fall. The subsequent confusion over whether a foul had been committed gave Barcelona a split second's momentum and Rakitic went unchallenged at the near post to send in a lob for Luis Suarez to head home at the back post, as Roma's players protested in vain. Roma coach Rudi Garcia's diplomacy did not allow him to point the finger, but the Frenchman managed to get the point across afterwards. ""Florenzi's goal, which was legendary, obviously cancelled out their opener. But before they scored he had been taken out of the play and couldn't defend,"" said Garcia. Almost immediately afterwards, Barcelona were denied a possible penalty when Szczesny missed the ball when at full stretch to deny Suarez at the Uruguayan's feet. Fans were expecting the worst, until the stupor was broken in spectacular fashion just after the half hour. Seeing goalkeeper Marc-Andre Ter Stegen 15 yards off his line, Florenzi carried the ball into Barcelona's half near the right touchline, looked up and hit a drive that sailed over the keeper, off the far post and into the net. ""I couldn't believe it went in,"" said Florenzi, who none the less has a habit of scoring the occasional spectacular goal in Serie A. ""I held up my hands to my face in disbelief. I don't do that very often."" ""That was one for the history books,"" said Garcia, whose side next face BATE Borisov in a fortnight. ""Against Barca you always concede chances but the boys did well to close a lot of those down,"" he added. ""It's not a great result, it's a good result that has given the lads some confidence for our subsequent matches."""

A draw against the Catalan giants will be considered a huge result, given the 7-1 thrashing Roma suffered by Bayern Munich in the group stages last year. A day after seeing Real Madrid striker Cristiano Ronaldo overtake their shared record of 77 goals in the competition with a hat-trick in a 4-0 win over Shakhtar Donetsk, Messi had plenty reason to be on the goals hunt. The Argentinian was a class act, dipping and skipping past Roma's players at will but failing to add to close his gap to Ronaldo's new tally of 80 goals. When Messi spun away from Radja Nainggolan in the opening minutes he fired just a metre over Szczesny's bar. Roma were finding counter-attacking chances and twice Mohamed Salah powered down the right flank in the opening ten minutes before meeting traffic. Gradually, Barcelona settled, prompting a chorus of whistle and jeers among Roma's increasingly-unhappy fans. When Suarez threatened deep on the right byeline, nerves were settled only by Antonio Rudiger's clean tackle to dispossess the Uruguayan. But Barcelona were not to be denied. On 21 minutes Messi backed into Lucas Digne and the subsequent confusion over whether a foul had been committed gave Barcelona a split second's momentum. Rakitic went unchallenged at the right post to send in a lob for Suarez to header home at the back post, as Roma's players protested in vain. Roma looked all at sea and when Suarez broke deep on the left, only a timely intervention from Szczesny rescued the hosts from conceding again although replays showed the Polish goalkeeper completely missed the ball and made contact with Suarez instead. Roma seemed shellshocked and an eery silence hung over the stadium as fans sat in awe, until the stupor was broken in spectacular fashion just after the half hour. Seeing Ter Stegen 15 metres off his line, Florenzi looked up from near the right touchline and hit a drive from just inside the halfway line that sailed over the 'keeper, off the far post and into the net. The 58,800 crowd were stunned, but Barca responded immediately, Messi twice going close after a mazy run down the right hand side of the penalty area although Roma finished the half on a high, Nainggolan unleashing a drive from 25 yards that forced Ter Stegen to parry down low at his left post, while Salah fired over after a great run that saw him hold off two markers. Barca took barely 90 seconds after the restart to threaten again, Szczesny first denying Messi from distance and then diving at the feet of Suarez to deny the Uruguayan. Jordi Alba had kept the ball in play and Suarez had two stabs with his feet, the second injuring Szczesny's hand and ending his game prematurely. Morgan De Sanctis, who has not played a league game all season, replaced the Pole and despite some early nerves went on to produce a great performance, denying Barcelona with a string of fine saves at the death."

Roma's Stadio Olimpico is expected to host a sell-out crowd of 72,000 for the Group E encounter -- a rare occurrence, but one which illustrates the attraction of one of the world's best football sides, and one of the game's greatest players. It will be Messi's 100th Champions League appearance and for Enrique, Messi beats them all. ""You know my opinion (on Messi), but I can give it to you again,"" Enrique, who coached Roma for a rather fruitless season in 2011-2012, told media in Rome on Tuesday. ""Messi isn't just the best player in the world, he's the best the game has ever seen."" Alba, when asked to compare the Argentinian with Real Madrid striker Cristiano Ronaldo, said the Argentinian wins hands down. Prior to Real's home game against Shakhtar Donetsk on Tuesday, both Mess and Ronaldo had scored a record 77 goals in the competition. ""Ronaldo is a great goalscorer, but what Leo does on the pitch, no one else does. It's incomparable,"" said Alba. ""When you have Leo on the pitch, everything changes. For me, he's five steps ahead of everyone else."" Given Barcelona's status as favourites, Roma host the defending champions with the prime objective of limiting the damage less than a year after a humbling 7-1 defeat to Bayern Munich drastically compromised their group stage qualification chances. Giallorossi coach Rudi Garcia insisted earlier they won't be going out to specifically stop Messi from wowing the Stadio Olimpco. ""We don't have an anti-Messi plan, just as there isn't one to stop (Luis) Suarez or (Andres) Iniesta,"" Garcia said. ""As (midfielder) Daniele De Rossi has said, you deal with the threat collectively, both in attack and defence."" Enrique said he has few remarkable souvenirs of his spell as Roma coach: ""It was too long ago."" But the Spaniard expects Garcia's men to produce the kind of battling performance that resulted in a 2-1 win over last season's beaten finalists Juventus in Serie A a fortnight ago. ""I expect Roma to be similar to the team that beat Juve. They will put us under pressure, try to keep possession and they will have chances to score,"" added Enrique. While Roma's defence has yet to settle following the recent arrival of Antonio Rudiger and Lucas Digne, Barcelona's well-drilled back four welcomes the return of Gerard Pique from a three-match La Liga suspension. For Alba, the timing couldn't be better: ""We have confidence in all our central defenders, but Pique is a leader both on and off the pitch. ""He's one of the best in the world in his position and gives us a lot of guarantees."""
1169,15/09/2015,02:17,Roma hope to banish Bayern blues against Barca,Roma will be hoping to banish the spectre of a crushing Champions League defeat to Bayern Munich last season when they host defending champions Barcelona in their Group E opener on Wednesday.,"A humiliating 7-1 defeat to the Bundesliga giants on what was Roma's return to the competition after a three-year absence served as a harsh wake-up call as the Italians' crashed out of the competition at the group stages. Having added strikers Edin Dzeko and Iago Falque, as well as several defenders during the summer, Roma coach Rudi Garcia now has the backbone of a squad that pundits feel has scudetto-winning credentials. Domestically, Roma have avoided defeat so far, and beaten champions Juventus to boot, to sit two points behind Serie A leaders Inter Milan. Yet Barcelona were virtually impervious when they humbled Juventus 3-1 in last season's Berlin final and, in a Group D that also includes Bayer Leverkusen and BATE Borisov, Luis Enrique's troops are fully expected to finish top of the pile. Barcelona arrive in the Eternal City as favourites, especially after they dominated Roma 3-0 in a pre-season friendly when Neymar, Lionel Messi and Ivan Rakitic were all on target. Giallorossi goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny knows Barcelona's potency only too well, having been beaten twice by Messi, once from the penalty spot, when former club Arsenal lost 3-1 at the Camp Nou on their way to a 4-3 aggregate defeat in the 2010/11 round of 16. But the Polish shot-stopper, whose strong performances so far have pushed Morgan De Sanctis down the pecking order, has sounded a note of defiance. ""We can't wait to come up against a fantastic side like Barcelona,"" said Szczesny after Saturday's 2-0 win away to league new boys Frosinone. ""We already showed against Juventus we're confident when facing the best teams in Europe."" Fans might be feeling confident but Roma's recent league win over the Italian champions must be seen in the light of Juve's current struggles that have seen them drop to 16th place with only one point from three league outings. Barcelona's recent record in the competition -- they won four of six away games last season, scoring in every one -- speaks for itself, although the Catalans' record against Italian teams is less impressive. Barcelona have won just one of their last six matches in Italy, beating AC Milan 3-2 in the 2011/12 group stages, and won only six of their 20 away matches against Serie A sides. ""We've got a tough group, like most teams,"" said Barca coach Enrique, who as coach of Roma in the 2011-2012 season led them to a seventh place finish. Barca defender Javier Mascherano told UEFA.com he expects Roma to take the game to the reigning champions, although Barca would relish a team taking them on at what they do best. ""Roma play football. This sometimes works well for us, but they're a quality side and we know they're going to play their game from the off and fight for every ball,"" said Mascherano. ""They are a side with tradition and, above all, we know how hard it is to go to Italy and play. Tactically, they're teams that defend well and it's not easy to score against them. It will be a difficult game for us."" Despite making his league debut this season last weekend, Roma captain Francesco Totti is set to start on the bench after Juan Iturbe impressed on his second-half appearance against Frosinone. Barcelona welcome defender Gerard Pique back to the fold after he missed their first three La Liga games through suspension, while Enrique has left Dani Alves off his 20-man travelling party."

As the group stage of the 2015-16 tournament gets underway on Tuesday and Wednesday, the Champions League has become a prize only an elite handful of the continent's very biggest clubs can win. But at the same time it has become impossible for any of these giants to dominate the competition in the way the likes of Ajax and Bayern Munich did in the 1970s, and Real Madrid in the late 1950s. No team has retained the title since the dawn of the Champions League era, with AC Milan the last club to lift the trophy with the big ears two seasons running, a quarter of a century ago in 1989 and 1990. That, then, is the task facing Barcelona after they beat Juventus 3-1 in last season's final to win the trophy for the fourth time in the last 10 seasons. ""We've got a tough group, like most teams,"" said Barca coach Luis Enrique of a draw that will see his side face his old club Roma and Bayer Leverkusen, as well as BATE Borisov, in Group E. But reaching the knockout stage is unlikely to be a huge problem for Barca or any of the other leading contenders for the trophy. Pep Guardiola will be determined to win the competition in what most expect to be his last season in charge of Bayern Munich, who are in Group F with Arsenal, Olympiakos and Dinamo Zagreb. The Germans have been champions once, beaten finalists twice and semi-finalists twice since 2009-10, although Arjen Robben and Franck Ribery's persistent fitness problems cast a shadow over their prospects just now. ""Winning the Champions League is my great, great target,"" said Bayern's Spanish midfielder Xabi Alonso last week. ""You want to shine in this competition and be at your very best."" It remains to be seen if ten-time winners Real Madrid will be as fearsome a proposition this season with Rafa Benitez in charge, while it will surely not be long before English clubs, fuelled by the vast riches of their domestic television deal, return to the forefront. No English side has reached the last four since Chelsea lifted the trophy in 2012 and none even made the quarter-finals last season. The final will be played in Milan on May 28 next year, but Italy's best hope lies with last season's runners-up Juventus. Meanwhile, French hopes rest with Paris Saint-Germain, who are targeting the trophy after reaching three quarter-finals in a row and believe the signing of Angel di Maria from Manchester United can provide them with the extra quality required. ""There were clubs I could have gone to but my desire to be in this project and help them to win the Champions League is why I chose to come here,"" said Di Maria after his unveiling, and PSG will get an early test of their credentials when they face his old side Real Madrid in one of the games of the group stage. Beyond the established elite, it has become almost impossible for other sides to pose a challenge, with Wolfsburg's chances of making an impression seriously compromised by the loss of their outstanding player Kevin De Bruyne to Manchester City. Such is the lot of sides outwith the privileged few, but if the Champions League is lacking in real edge-of-the-seat drama until the knockout rounds arrive in the spring, it is where the very best players strut their stuff and where big money stands to be earned. If Barcelona do manage to retain the title, they will go down in history but they could also earn close to 100 million euros ($112m) in prize money and television income."
1171,11/09/2015,17:24,Barca visit tests Atletico's title credentials,Atletico Madrid have a great opportunity to show their La Liga title challenge is to be taken seriously this season when an under-strength Barcelona visit the Vicente Calderon on Saturday.,"Both sides took the maximum six points from their opening two league fixtures last month, but it is Atletico after a summer of heavy investment in the transfer market who have looked the more impressive. Diego Simeone's men won 3-0 at Sevilla last time out and are at full strength as left-back Filipe Luis has recovered from the hamstring problem that kept him out the trip to the Sanchez Pizjuan. ""Last year we finished third and had a good season, but this time we are hungry for more,"" said Atletico midfielder Koke. ""They are the favourites. They are the current champions of La Liga, but we are playing at home and are desperate to win again."" By contrast, Barcelona are without three first team regulars as Dani Alves and Claudio Bravo miss out through injury, whilst Gerard Pique is suspended. Lionel Messi also hasn't trained with the Catalans all week as he only arrived back from international duty on Thursday and was given time off by the club to attend the birth of his second child on Friday. However, Messi has been included in Luis Enrique's 18-man squad for the game and will start. ""The international break isn't an excuse for us or the opponents,"" said Barca boss Luis Enrique on Friday. ""(Javier) Mascherano and others have only been able to do one training session. Here we all know what happens when there is an international break and we are used to it. They have also had players on international duty and that is why the coaches are there, to ensure the team performs at its best no matter the circumstances. ""I expect Messi, just like everyone else, to be at his best."" Thomas Vermaelen is expected to deputise once more in defence after scoring his first goal for the club in a nervy 1-0 win at home to Malaga two weeks ago. Meanwhile, Marc-Andre ter Stegen will make his La Liga debut in goal with Bravo set for a lengthy spell on the sidelines with a calf problem. Real Madrid already trail Atletico and Barca by two points, but face a much easier task on paper this weekend when they travel to face Espanyol. Rafael Benitez will have to do without both James Rodriguez and Danilo, though, after they returned back from international duty with a thigh tear and plantar fasciitis, better known as jogger's heel, respectively. Gareth Bale enjoyed a better time during his international commitments as he took Wales to the brink of their first major tournament in 58 years and he is expected to be handed a central role once more by Benitez after scoring twice last time out against Real Betis. Elsewhere, Valencia and Sevilla are targeting their first wins of the league season ahead of their return to the Champions League in midweek. Sevilla kick-off the weekend on Friday night away to Levante, whilst Valencia visit Sporting Gijon on Saturday. David Moyes's Real Sociedad are also looking for their first win and first goal of the campaign after two consecutive 0-0 draws when they visit Real Betis on Saturday. Fixtures (all times GMT)"

""Although they have some players out the Barca squad is practically the same as last year, they have plenty of options to choose from and they are favourites for every match,"" said Luis. ""We have the advantage of playing at home and I am sure it will be a great, hard and intense game. We have a lot of confidence and we need to continue in the same way as the previous two games where we have won and not conceded a goal."" By contrast, Barcelona are likely to be without three first team regulars as Dani Alves and Claudio Bravo miss out through injury, whilst Gerard Pique is suspended unless a last minute appeal to Spain's administrative court for sport is successful. Pique endured a testing time during the international break as he was booed by sections of the home support during Spain's 2-0 win over Slovakia after mocking Real Madrid during Barca's treble winning celebrations at the end of last season. However, he is desperate to get back on the field for the first time on league duty this season. ""It is always a difficult place to go, one of the most difficult of the season,"" he said on Thursday. ""The Calderon will roar them on and we have to be 100 percent focused. I am desperate to play and hopefully I will be able to."" Should Pique miss out, Thomas Vermaelen is expected to deputise once more in defence after scoring his first goal for the club in a nervy 1-0 win at home to Malaga two weeks ago. Meanwhile, Marc-Andre ter Stegen will make his La Liga debut in goal with Bravo set for a lengthy spell on the sidelines with a calf problem. However, Luis Enrique will be able to name Lionel Messi and Neymar alongside Luis Suarez in his starting line-up for just the second time this season after they returned back from international duty unscathed. Real Madrid already trail Atletico and Barca by two points, but face a much easier task on paper this weekend when they travel to face Espanyol.

1173,10/09/2015,14:41,Pique still committed to Spain despite boos,Barcelona defender Gerard Pique has said he remains committed to playing for Spain and won't change his outspoken ways despite being booed by sections of La Roja's fanbase.,"Pique was targeted by the home fans during Spain's 2-0 win over Slovakia on Friday after mocking Real Madrid during Barcelona's treble-winning celebrations at the end of last season. ""The last thing I would do is leave the national team. Whether it lasts a day, a month or a year, I will continue to play as long as the coach wants me,"" he said on Thursday. Pique also dismissed suggestions that his support for a democratic vote on Catalan independence had also played a part in the treatment he has received. The 28-year-old was part of the Spain sides that won the World Cup in 2010 and the European Championship two years later. He has been widely supported by his colleagues in the national team and coach Vicente del Bosque, who described the boos as ""lamentable."" However, Real Madrid captain and international teammate Sergio Ramos said Pique's actions ""hadn't helped"" the situation given the rivalry that exists between the two clubs. ""I have 70 caps. There are no doubts, I have always given my best in every game,"" he added. ""I have been world and European champion. I haven't said anything bad and I don't have to defend myself."" In a heated press conference, Pique also pleaded for the rivalry between Barcelona and Madrid to not be a dividing factor when players from both sides come together to represent Spain. ""In the rivalry between Barca and Madrid I will not change,"" he said. ""When Barca have done well it is because Madrid haven't and the reverse. I always wish that Madrid do as badly as possible."" In May, Pique had sarcastically thanked Colombian rapper Kevin Roldan for playing his part in Barca's success last season after the performer caused controversy by posting pictures on social media of Madrid players celebrating Cristiano Ronaldo's 30th birthday just hours after a 4-0 defeat to Atletico Madrid. ""I don't regret anything that I have said and I would repeat it a thousand times and more,"" he added. ""I am like that, I want Madrid to always lose. That is the sporting rivalry that has always existed in Spain. ""That rivalry doesn't prevent me from having a good relationship with the Real Madrid players, my relationship with them is fantastic."" Spanish media reported earlier this week that Madrid's Santiago Bernabeu stadium had been ruled out as a venue for a friendly between Spain and England on November 13, now set to be played in Alicante, to avoid more boos being directed at Pique. Spain next play at home in a European Championship qualifier against Luxembourg in Logrono on October 9."
1174,08/09/2015,16:11,Guardiola 'would have played for a Catalan team',"Bayern Munich's Spanish coach Pep Guardiola on Tuesday campaigned for political and sporting independence in his native Catalonia region, saying he would gladly have played for a Catalan national side.","In his time as a player, ""if a Catalan state had existed, I would have played for Catalonia, because I was born in Santpedor"", north of Barcelona, he said in an interview published by the pro-independence sports lobby Guanyarem. As it was, Guardiola played 47 matches for the Spanish national team. From 1990 to 2001 he played for Barcelona. As coach of the club from 2008 to 2012 he led Barcelona to domestic and Champions League glory. Pro-independence Catalan leaders want Catalonia's regional election on September 27 to serve as a vote on independence -- a move fiercely opposed by Spain's conservative government. Guardiola is making a symbolic stand for election in the polls. As the last name on the list, he is not expected to win a seat in the regional parliament, but is a powerful talisman for the independence movement. ""We want to manage our resources ourselves,"" he said, calling for ""a more socially stable and prosperous country for all""."
1175,20/08/2015,14:41,Chelsea agree deal for Barcelona winger Pedro,"English champions Chelsea have agreed a deal with Barcelona for the signing of Spanish international winger Pedro Rodriguez, both clubs announced on Thursday.","""FC Barcelona and Chelsea FC have reached an agreement for the transfer of Pedro Rodriguez for 30 million euros ($33.2 million, £21.2 million), three of which are variables depending on performance,"" Barcelona said in a statement. Pedro chose the Premier League champions over rival suitors Manchester United and Manchester City, the 28-year-old's arrival at Stamford Bridge ending a summer-long transfer saga. Chelsea coach Jose Mourinho's latest acquisition turns up in London boasting five La Liga trophies and three Champions League titles. ""I am very happy to be here. I am very excited to start my adventure at Chelsea and I am here to keep winning titles,"" Pedro told his new club's website. ""Thanks to the club and the supporters for giving me the opportunity to put the blue shirt on."" He left Barcelona having fallen down the pecking order at the Camp Nou under Luis Enrique, who has preferred the all-star front three of Lionel Messi, Neymar and Luis Suarez and has used the Canary-Islands born player more sparingly. The compact Pedro - full name Pedro Eliezer Rodríguez Ledesma - is a product of Barcelona's youth academy. He made his first team debut in January 2008 after catching the eye for their B team. He developed to become an integral part of Barcelona's winning machine, and was the first player ever to score in the Spanish league, Copa del Rey, Champions League, both the European and Spanish Super Cups as well as the World Club Cup. His brilliant performances at club level saw him secure a place in the Spain squad for the 2010 World Cup in South Africa. Pedro started both the semi-final and final, and was a key figure in their victory over the Netherlands. A year later he scored the opening goal in the Champions League final at Wembley as Bar?a beat Manchester United 3-1. He was a substitute alongside then Chelsea players Fernando Torres and Juan Mata in Spain's Euro 2012 victory over Italy. The winger was also part of the squad which travelled to Brazil for the 2014 World Cup. Pedro came on as a late substitute in Barcelona's most recent major success - May's Champions League final win over Juventus in Berlin. His final act for Barca was to score the winning goal in last week's dramatic 5-4 extra-time defeat of Sevilla in the UEFA Super Cup in Tbilisi."
1176,19/08/2015,13:40,Pedro to join Chelsea,"Premier League champions Chelsea have pipped Manchester United to the signing of Spain winger Pedro Rodriguez from Barcelona, according to British press reports on Wednesday.","The BBC reported that Chelsea had agreed a fee of £21 million (29.8m euros, $32.9m) with the reigning European champions and that the 28-year-old was on a flight to London to finalise the terms of the transfer. If completed, the deal will bring an end to a summer-long transfer saga surrounding Pedro, who had been linked to Manchester City as well as United, although it was the Old Trafford club who appeared most likely to sign him. Pedro scored the winning goal for Barcelona in last week's dramatic 5-4 extra-time defeat of Sevilla in the UEFA Super Cup in Tbilisi. However, he has fallen down the pecking order at the Camp Nou under Luis Enrique, who has preferred the all-star front three of Lionel Messi, Neymar and Luis Suarez and has used the Canary-Islands born player more sparingly."
1177,19/08/2015,13:12,Pique handed four-game La Liga ban,Barcelona defender Gerard Pique will miss the first four matches of the new La Liga season for abusing match officials in the European champions' Spanish Super Cup defeat to Athletic Bilbao.,"Pique was shown a straight red card in the second leg of the tie on Monday, which ended 1-1, for taking his protests towards the linesman too far as Barca failed to overcome a 4-0 first leg deficit. The length of the ban was confirmed by Spanish football's disciplinary committee on Wednesday. Pique will now miss Barca's daunting rematch away to Athletic Bilbao on Sunday and the trip to Atletico Madrid on September 12, as well as home games against Malaga and Levante. According to the referee's report, Pique seriously insulted the linesman using abusive language. However, despite apologising for his actions, Pique insisted he did not use the language alleged by the referee. ""I want to apologise because the attitude with which I protested to the linesman wasn't correct,"" he wrote on his official Twitter account. ""It was a game of great tension in which we were playing for a lot. ""However, at no moment did I use any type of insult towards him."" Barcelona had appealed against the red card on Tuesday. ""In the arguments presented we wanted to make clear that the player did not address the assistant referee in the terms written afterwards by the referee Velasco Carballo in the referee's report,"" the said in a statement. Barca midfielder Ivan Rakitic also defended his team-mate's actions, claiming the referee had been too quick to produce the red card. ""The ban worries me because Pique is an important player. A sending-off like that also worries me because he spoke without any bad intent, it was the nerves,"" the Croatian said on Tuesday. ""If this merits a sending-off there will be many in every game."""
1178,19/08/2015,02:15,Will stability breed more success for Barcelona?,In contrast to the previous two years Barcelona have enjoyed the calm of a summer without major changes on and off the pitch after claiming a second treble in six years.,"Success breeds stability, but the lack of movement in the transfer market was partly imposed on the club as it served the last of a two-window ban on registering players for breaking FIFA rules in signing minors. That hasn't stopped the Catalans splashing nearly 60 million euros ($66.5 million, £42.6 million) on Arda Turan and Aleix Vidal from Atletico Madrid and Sevilla respectively, but neither will be able to play until January when the market reopens. Both were signed ahead of the big event of Barca's summer - their presidential elections - as Josep Maria Bartomeu attempted to pull out all the stops to stay in power. There were also new contracts for coach Luis Enrique and Dani Alves and the elections went swimmingly for Bartomeu as he routed former president and long-term rival Joan Laporta to win the right to lead the club for another six years. So what can stop a settled Barca side containing a front three of Lionel Messi, Luis Suarez and Neymar which scored a record 122 goals on the way to winning the Champions League, Copa del Rey and La Liga last season? At Barcelona a drama is never far away as evidenced by the fact that Enrique was on the verge of the sack back in January before ending his debut season in the hot seat with three major trophies. Off the field, despite his election success, Bartomeu's position is likely to come under more scrutiny as he is due to stand trial later in the year on tax evasion charges over the controversial deal which brought Neymar to the club in 2013. Meanwhile, on it there could also be problems ahead due to a lack of balance as evidenced by a 5-1 aggregate drubbing by Athletic Bilbao in the Spanish Super Cup and blowing a 4-1 lead against Sevilla before claiming the UEFA Super Cup 5-4 after extra time just days previously. Even when Turan and Vidal are free to play they are likely to be restricted to bit part roles amongst a throng of attacking talent. The defence hasn't been strengthened at all and a reliance on Gerard Pique could be exposed in a challenging start to the league season. Pique was sent-off for losing his cool with the officials in the second leg of the Spanish Super Cup against Athletic as Barca's hopes of winning six trophies in a calendar year slipped away. As a result he is likely to be suspended when Barca return to San Mames to face Athletic on the first day of the season and for the trip to Atletico Madrid on September 12. In midfield, the talismanic presence of Xavi Hernandez will be missed for the first time in 17 years whilst doubts remain over the ability of youngsters Rafinha and Sergi Roberto to provide cover to Sergio Busquets, Andres Iniesta and Ivan Rakitic. Yet, all those worries pale into comparison with those faced by Barca's opponents in stopping arguably the most fearsome strike force world football has ever seen. With Suarez free to start the campaign unlike last season when he was banned until October and fresh after missing the Copa America from suspension, Barca's South American triumvirate could easily top their tally from last year. Having won five titles in the past seven years, Barca remain the team to beat in La Liga."
1179,18/08/2015,23:23,Pique denies insulting linesman,Barcelona defender Gerard Pique has denied using abusive language towards a linesman that saw him sent-off in his side's Spanish Super Cup defeat to Athletic Bilbao and could see him banned for the first four La Liga games of the season.,"Pique was shown a straight red card in the second leg of the tie on Monday, which ended 1-1, for taking his protests towards the linesman too far as Barca failed to overcome a 4-0 first leg deficit. ""I want to apologise because the attitude with which I protested to the linesman wasn't correct,"" he wrote on his official Twitter account. ""It was a game of great tension in which we were playing for a lot. ""However, at no moment did I use any type of insult towards him."" According to the referee's report Pique seriously insulted the linesman. However, Barcelona have challenged that view of events and lodged an appeal against the red card. ""FC Barcelona has presented on Tuesday an appeal against the red card shown to Gerard Pique in the 58th minute of the second leg of the Spanish Super Cup against Athletic Club,"" they said in a statement. ""In the appeal we wanted to make clear that the player did not address the assistant referee in the terms written afterwards by the referee Velasco Carballo in the referee's report."" In previous cases the insult Pique is alleged to have used has resulted in a four-game ban. Should he be punished similarly, the Spanish international would miss trips to Athletic Bilbao and Atletico Madrid as well as home games against Malaga and Levante in La Liga. Spanish football's disciplinary committee will meet on Wednesday to decide Pique's fate."
1180,16/08/2015,13:40,Barca boss bullish despite four-goal deficit,Barcelona boss Luis Enrique has insisted his side can pull off a monumental fightback on Monday to add the Spanish Super Cup to their 2015 trophy haul despite trailing Athletic Bilbao 4-0 heading into the second leg.,"An under-strength Barca side was blown away by the Basques on Friday as they exacted revenge for defeat in May's Copa del Rey final at the Camp Nou thanks to Aritz Aduriz's hat-trick and a spectacular opener from just inside the Barca half by Mikel San Jose. However, a defiant Enrique insisted a goal-laden squad spearheaded by Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez is capable of turning the tie around. ""We are completely convinced that if we do things well we will have a chance,"" Enrique said on Sunday. ""There is no doubt we will try to do it. I have looked at the statistics and last season we scored four or more goals in 18 games. ""When Barca play well anything can happen."" It was the first time Barca had lost by four goals against Spanish opposition for eight years and the first time in 14 years they had conceded four times in two consecutive matches. The European champions had beaten Sevilla 5-4 after extra time in energy-sapping conditions in the Georgian capital Tbilisi to win the UEFA Super Cup just three days prior to their trip to Bilbao. Enrique had left out the likes of Gerard Pique, Sergio Busquets, Ivan Rakitic and Andres Iniesta from the start at San Mames as a result. Yet, they will be back close to full-strength for the return with only the ill Neymar and injured Jordi Alba missing out. ""After the result you are down because no one expected it. Even though we didn't play well the difference in the scoreline was exaggerated,"" said defender Javier Mascherano. ""We need to be convinced that we can do it. The difficulty is huge, the result isn't an easy one but it is an important challenge for us. No one has ever done it in a Spanish Super Cup. ""If we play well we will score goals. Hopefully, we can get enough to turn the tie around. ""The most important thing in these type of games is the mental aspect. The team is well prepared in this sense. The desire to win another title makes you forget the first leg. ""We all believe the possibility exists to comeback. Obviously it is a final and the opponent will be prepared, but we know we have to team capable of doing it."" Barca believe history could also be on their side. A Messi hat-trick sparked a 4-0 win over Sevilla in the 2010 Super Cup after a similarly weakened side had lost the first leg 3-1. Athletic's first-leg performance was all the more impressive as they are also missing four first-team regulars through injury. Inaki Williams, Ander Iturraspe, Mikel Rico and Iker Muniain are all expected to miss out once more and Aduriz remains cautious. ""We cannot think that Barca in their stadium can't score four goals. They are the best and capable of doing anything."" Victory would end a 31-year barren run without a trophy for Athletic and would be particularly sweet after they lost the Copa del Rey final to Barca in three of the past seven years as well as the Super Cup in 2009. ""If we lift the Cup it will be the best night of my career,"" added Aduriz."
1181,16/08/2015,02:15,Barca still believe despite four-goal deficit,Barcelona need to produce a monumental fightback on Monday to add the Spanish Super Cup to the four trophies they have already won in 2015 as they trail Athletic Bilbao 4-0 heading into the second leg.,"An under-strength Barca side was blown away by the Basques on Friday as they exacted revenge for defeat in May's Copa del Rey final at the Camp Nou thanks to Aritz Aduriz's hat-trick and a spectacular opener from just inside the Barca half by Mikel San Jose. It was the first time Barca had lost by four goals against Spanish opposition for eight years and the first time in 14 years they had conceded four times in two consecutive matches. The European champions had beaten Sevilla 5-4 after extra time in energy-sapping conditions in the Georgian capital Tbilisi to win the UEFA Super Cup just three days prior to their trip to Bilbao. And there is belief among the Barca squad that, with more time to prepare and back close to full strength at home, a remarkable turnaround is still possible. ""If there is anyone who can turn this around it is Barca,"" said coach Luis Enrique, whose decision to rest Gerard Pique, Sergio Busquets, Ivan Rakitic and Andres Iniesta from the start has been questioned. ""90 minutes at the Camp Nou. I believe,"" Pique posted on his official Twitter account on Saturday. Barca believe history could also be on their side. A Lionel Messi hat-trick sparked a 4-0 win over Sevilla in the 2010 Super Cup after a similarly weakened side had lost the first leg 3-1. Neymar and Jordi Alba are still missing through illness and injury respectively, but Luis Enrique could recall goalkeeper Claudio Bravo for his first appearance of the season in place of Marc-Andre ter Stegen. Athletic's first-leg performance was all the more impressive as they are also missing four first-team regulars through injury. Inaki Williams, Ander Iturraspe, Mikel Rico and Iker Muniain are all expected to miss out once more and Aduriz remains cautious. ""We cannot think that Barca in their stadium can't score four goals.

1182,15/08/2015,00:14,Barca thrashed 4-0 by Aduriz-inspired Athletic,European champions Barcelona were stunned by an Aritz Aduriz hat-trick and brilliant opener from Mikel San Jose as Athletic Bilbao took a 4-0 lead into the second-leg of the Spanish Super Cup.,"Barca had picked up their fourth trophy of the year in Tbilisi on Tuesday with a 5-4 win over Sevilla in extra time in the UEFA Super Cup. But those exertions clearly took their toll as an under-strength side was dominated from the off by the Basques who exacted revenge for defeat in the Copa del Rey final back in May. San Jose fired in a volley from just inside the Barca half to break the deadlock before Aduriz struck three times in 15 second-half minutes to give Ernesto Valverde's side a huge advantage heading into Monday's second-leg. ""To score four against Barcelona is almost impossible. We are very satisfied with our work but the second leg is still to come and it is going to be very tough,"" Aduriz told Spanish TV station Telecinco. ""We cannot think that Barca in their stadium can't score four goals. They are the best and capable of doing anything."" Barca's defensive deficiencies had been laid bare in blowing a 4-1 lead against Sevilla that forced them into an energy-sapping extra 30 minutes in the Georgian capital. However, with Gerard Pique among four first-team regulars rested the Catalans were even more of a shambles at the back and this time couldn't be rescued by an off-colour Luis Suarez and Lionel Messi. It is the first time in 14 years that the Catalans have conceded four times in two consecutive games. ""It is going to be difficult, but we have won many matches by many goals and we will try until the last minute,"" said a defiant Javier Mascherano. ""It is a one-off situation. They had four or five chances and scored four. Obviously that is not normal, especially given how we finished last season, but don't count us out yet. ""Now we have to correct what we did wrong, but above all prepare for the return leg."" San Jose began an unforgettable night for the hosts in fitting fashion as he pounced on Marc-Andre Ter Stegen's headed clearance to fire the ball beyond the German 'keeper from just beyond the halfway line. Barca slowly began to get back into the game, but they didn't seriously threaten until first-half stoppage time when Pedro Rodriguez was clipped on the edge of the area. Messi scored twice from free-kicks against Sevilla in midweek and couldn't have struck this one much better as Gorka Iraizoz flew to his right to claw the ball away from the top corner with an outstretched hand. The visitors twice came close to an equaliser at the start of the second period as Pedro fired off the underside of the bar before Iraizoz made another brilliant save to deny Messi from Suarez's clever cut-back. However, the game turned back in Athletic's favour when Sabin Merino beat Dani Alves for pace and his cross was powerfully headed home by Aduriz. More poor defending from Luis Enrique's men was punished nine minutes later as the ball ricocheted around the area before Aduriz smashed home on the turn. And the veteran striker was given the chance to complete his hat-trick when Alves was adjudged to have pulled down Borja Etxeita from a corner and Aduriz confidently sent Ter Stegen the wrong way from the spot. Messi and Suarez tried to lift the visitors in the final quarter, but even they couldn't find a way past a resolute Athletic defence. Barca now have a huge mountain to climb at the Camp Nou on Monday if they are to maintain their push to emulate Pep Guardiola's Barca side which won six trophies in a calendar year six years ago."

The 28-year-old said he didn't know if that would be his last game for the club and criticised the club's technical secretary Robert Fernandez for claiming he had asked to leave. Manchester United have been strongly linked with a move for the winger in recent weeks, but reports in England on Friday suggested Manchester City could try to beat their rivals to Pedro's signature. Enrique makes five changes in all from the side that started the energy sapping trip to Tbilisi with Adriano, Thomas Vermaelen, Marc Bartra and Sergi Roberto also coming into the side at the expense of Jeremy Mathieu, Gerard Pique, Sergio Busquets, Ivan Rakitic and Andres Iniesta."
1184,14/08/2015,11:36,Villa pounce for Barcelona starlet Traore,"Aston Villa have signed 19-year-old winger Adama Traore from European champions Barcelona on a five-year contract, the two clubs announced on Friday.","Barcelona said that Villa would pay an initial 10 million euros ($11.1m, £7.1m), potentially rising to 12 million euros, and that the Catalan club would retain a buy-back option for the next three years. ""He's someone I have been tracking for a long time,"" Villa manager Tim Sherwood told the club website after Traore became his 10th signing of the transfer window. ""He's physically a man, and he has been for some time. He's a big powerful boy, very quick, dynamic and a maverick-type player. Those players are few and far between. ""We're delighted he has chosen Villa to continue his development."" Born in Spain to Malian parents, Traore joined Barcelona's youth set-up at the age of eight and made four senior appearances for the club, scoring one goal. He has been capped by Spain at youth level. ""It's an honour for me to come here,"" Traore said. ""It's a club that showed interest in me from the first moment and made me feel important in terms of their project. ""I have spoken to the manager and have a very good impression of him and what he wants from me. All this have made this club my top attraction. ""I would also like to express my gratitude to everyone at FC Barcelona for helping me develop as a player and as a person."""
1185,12/08/2015,16:54,Suarez joins Ronaldo and Messi on UEFA top player list,Barcelona's Uruguay forward Luis Suarez was on Wednesday named on a three-man shortlist for UEFA's Best Player in Europe award for 2014/15.,"The 28-year-old joins perennial top player nominees Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo. Suarez's Barca teammate Messi won the inaugural UEFA Best Player in Europe award in 2011 while Real Madrid's Ronaldo is the current holder. Messi is the big favourite as Barcelona won the treble of Champions League, La Liga and Copa del Rey last season, while he helped Argentina reach the Copa America final. The award will be handed out in Monaco on August 27 during the draw for the group stages of the Champions League. Behind the top three, Juventus goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon was fourth, Barca's Brazil forward Neymar fifth and Eden Hazard of Chelsea sixth."
1186,12/08/2015,10:52,Pedro future overshadows Barca's Super Cup success,"Barcelona can take a big step towards a fifth trophy in 2015 when they face Athletic Bilbao in the Spanish Super Cup on Friday, just three days after sealing the UEFA Super Cup with a remarkable 5-4 extra time win over Sevilla.","Pedro Rodriguez proved to be the unlikely hero for the Catalans as the wantaway winger, who had been controversially left out of the starting line-up, came off the bench to smash home the winner with five minutes left in extra time after Barca had conspired to throw away a 4-1 second-half lead. ""When you know that you could leave, it is a complicated situation. I was very angry to have not played (from the start) because I have always tried to be professional and go out to help the team,"" said Pedro. ""It is a complicated situation for many reasons. Not for money as has been said, which is another lack of respect. It is a question of continuity, of minutes on the pitch and I am an ambitious player."" And he also hit back at Barca technical secretary Robert Fernandez for claiming that he asked to leave the club, citing that statement as ""unfortunate"". Pedro's opportunities have been limited since the arrival of Luis Suarez last season to join Lionel Messi and Neymar in attack. However, even without Neymar due to a bout of the mumps, coach Luis Enrique opted for Rafinha ahead of Pedro and was rewarded as he scored after Messi had fired in two brilliant free-kicks to cancel out Ever Banega's opener for Sevilla. Suarez then made it 4-1 early in the second-half, but remarkably Sevilla produced a stunning fightback as goals from Jose Antonio Reyes, Kevin Gameiro and Yevhen Konoplyanka took the game into extra time. And Javier Mascherano admitted the European champions have plenty to work on ahead of the upcoming two legs against Athletic if they are to add the Spanish Super Cup to their trophy haul. ""For the fans it was the kind of spectacle you rarely see. We are happy to have won, but we have a lot to improve,"" said the Argentine. ""We committed a lot of errors that made life difficult for us. We allowed Sevilla to get back in the game, when you're 4-1 up and all of a sudden the result is in danger."" Barca travel to the San Mames on Friday before hosting the Basques at the Camp Nou next Monday. Neymar misses out once more but Athletic are even more affected by injuries with four first-team regulars almost certain to miss out. Inaki Williams, who scored Athletic's goal when the two sides met in the Copa del Rey final in May, Ander Iturraspe, Mikel Rico and Iker Muniain are all sidelined and striker Aritz Aduriz believes that is more of a blow to his side than Barcelona missing Neymar. ""Their absences are very important for them, but so are ours very important for us,"" he said. ""It is crucial that we have our best team available. At the moment we don't and that damages us."""
1187,11/08/2015,23:21,Pedro Barca's hero in nine-goal Super Cup classic,Barcelona added the UEFA Super Cup to their treble win of trophies last season despite blowing a 4-1 lead with a stunning 5-4 win over Sevilla thanks to Pedro Rodriguez's extra time winner.,"Two magnificent free-kicks from Lionel Messi plus goals from Rafinha and Luis Suarez looked to have Barca well on course to claim their fourth trophy of the year after Ever Banega had given Sevilla a shock early lead. However, Jose Antonio Reyes reduced the arrears before a Kevin Gameiro penalty and a debut strike from Yevhen Konoplyanka forced the game into an extra 30 minutes. Barca weren't to be denied, though, and, in what could be his last game for the club, Pedro pounced on the rebound after Beto had denied Messi his hat-trick. Pedro had been controversially left out of the starting line-up despite the absence of Neymar due to the mumps as he appears set for a move to Manchester United after Barca technical secretary Robert Fernandez admitted he has asked to leave the club. ""He deserves it,"" Messi said of Pedro's match-winning contribution. ""The players and the club don't know what he is going to do. It is his decision, but whatever he does we wish him the best."" Sevilla made the brighter start and Javier Mascherano was lucky to avoid further punishment after being adjudged to have brought down Reyes on the edge of the area. The punishment was still to come for the European champions, though, as Banega clinically curled the resulting free-kick past the helpless Marc-Andre Ter Stegen with an effort his international teammate Messi would have been proud of. Unfortunately, for Unai Emery's men the lead lasted only four minutes as Suarez was blocked by Grzegorz Krychowiak and Messi delicately chipped the ball over the wall into the top corner. The four-time World Player of the Year's next set-piece was even more spectacular as he this time fired a free-kick in off the inside of the post to move level with Cristiano Ronaldo as the all-time leading scorer in European competitions with 80. Suarez passed up a huge chance for the third when he fired straight at Beto two minutes before half-time but made immediate amends by collecting the rebound to tee up Rafinha to slot home. Sevilla's hopes of a comeback appeared to be over when a shocking pass from Benoit Tremoulinas was intercepted by Sergio Busquets and turned home by Suarez. Yet, they were given a lifeline when Reyes turned home Vitolo's excellent cross at the far post to reduce the arrears. Jeremy Mathieu then pulled down Vitolo inside the area and was also lucky only to see a yellow card before Gameiro fired home the spot-kick. And a remarkable comeback was complete when two substitutes on their debut combined for the equaliser as Konoplyanka tapped home Ciro Immobile's low cross. Pedro was finally introduced three minutes into extra time and just as in the Super Cup six years ago against Shakhtar Donetsk he grabbed the winner by firing into the roof of the net after Beto had parried Messi's follow-up effort from another dangerous free-kick. Sevilla still had two great chances to force an incredible match into a penalty shootout but both Coke and Adil Rami fired off target as a relieved Barca hung on."
1188,11/08/2015,20:14,Pedro benched as Barca exit looms,Spanish international Pedro Rodriguez was only named amongst the Barcelona substitutes for the UEFA Super Cup against Sevilla on Tuesday among growing speculation he is set to join Manchester United.,"The 28-year-old was expected to start in place of Neymar after he contracted the mumps, but it is Rafinha who starts alongside Luis Suarez and Lionel Messi in attack instead. Pedro does take his place on the bench, but Barca technical secretary Robert Fernandez told Catalan channel Esport 3 that the player has asked to leave the club."
1189,11/08/2015,19:12,El Clasico dates changed in fixture congestion chaos,The dates for both El Clasico clashes between Barcelona and Real Madrid in La Liga have been changed just days before the new season is due to get underway.,"The first fixture between the two giants scheduled for the weekend of November 7/8 at the Santiago Bernabeu will now be played two weeks later after an international break on November 21 or 22. Similarly the return at the Camp Nou will be a week later than planned on the weekend of April 9/10. The fixtures have had to be rescheduled due to the early rounds of the Copa del Rey and Barcelona's participation in the Club World Cup. A round of midweek fixtures planned for October 28 has been cancelled with Luis Enrique's men starting their Copa del Rey defence on that date instead. With the league season now set to finish a week later than planned on May 22, the Copa del Rey final has been moved forward to May 7. The La Liga season gets underway on August 21."
1190,10/08/2015,19:27,Losing Pedro unthinkable for Iniesta,Barcelona midfielder Andres Iniesta doesn't want to consider the possibility that Spanish international teammate Pedro Rodriguez could be entering his final days as a Barca player.,"Pedro has been heavily linked with a move to Manchester United before the transfer window closes at the end of the month after seeing his first-team opportunities squeezed by the arrivals of Neymar and Luis Suarez in the past two summers. Yet, the 28-year-old looks set to start as Barca attempt to add the UEFA Super Cup to their trophy haul of Champions League, La Liga and Copa del Rey from last season against Sevilla on Tuesday after Neymar was ruled out for two weeks after contracting the mumps. ""As of today we are not thinking that we could lose him,"" Iniesta said ahead of the match in the Georgian capital Tbilisi. ""He continues to be our teammate and he is here to win the first title (of the season). Hopefully, as a teammate and a player he can continue with us because he is a world class player."" Dani Alves turned down the chance to make the move from Barcelona to Old Trafford earlier in the summer after signing a new two-year deal with the European champions and said he would understand if Pedro was tempted by a lucrative offer from the free-spending Premier League side. ""It is a decision for him and what his heart feels,"" added the Brazilian. ""If he stays we will be delighted and if he leaves we have to respect that decision."" Whether the World Cup and European Championship winner stays or goes, with Barca unable to register any new players until January, Barca boss Luis Enrique is just keen for the window to close. ""Like any coach I would like to have all my players for the whole season,"" he said. ""We have already spoken about Pedro a lot and there will be a solution shortly because the market will close."" Barca will also be without left-back Jordi Alba through injury as they look to stay on course to match the historic achievement of Pep Guardiola's Barca side in 2009 by winning six trophies in a calendar year. Sevilla have even more severe injury problems, though, as new signing Steven N´Zonzi, Daniel Carrico and Dani Pareja are out, whilst centre-backs Adil Rami and Timothee Kolodziejczak are doubts due to a bout of gastroenteritis."
1191,09/08/2015,16:15,Neymar out for two weeks with mumps,"Brazil captain Neymar will miss Tuesday's European Super Cup in Tbilisi, Georgia, after contracting the mumps, Barcelona said Sunday.","The 23-year-old has previously been vaccinated against the viral disease more common in children, against which most people in the developed world are immunised when young. ""Neymar will be out for two weeks after being diagnosed with parotitis (mumps), despite the fact that he had previously been vaccinated against the disease,"" said Barca in a statement on their website. As well as Tuesday's match against Sevilla, Neymar will also miss the two-legged Spanish Super Cup against Athletic Bilbao on August 14 and 17."
1192,06/08/2015,02:52,Messi headbutt as tempers flare in Barca win,Lionel Messi was at the centre of a headbutting controversy on Wednesday as Barcelona cruised to a 3-0 victory over Serie A side Roma in a pre-season friendly at the Camp Nou.,"The Argentinian superstar, renowned for rarely losing his cool despite regularly being the target of brutal tackling, reacted angrily during a confrontation with Roma's French international Mapou Yanga-Mbiwa. Footage of the first half incident showed Messi aiming a headbutt at Yanga-Mbiwa's after the Roma defender appeared to nod his head in the direction of the diminutive South American star. A furious Messi grabbed Yanga-Mbiwa by the throat after clashing with the defender before other players rushed over to intervene. <div class=""vine-container""><iframe frameborder=""0"" height=""600"" src=""https://vine.co/v/ewuu22dpbXm/embed/simple"" width=""600""></iframe><script src=""https://platform.vine.co/static/scripts/embed.js""></script></div><script src=""https://platform.vine.co/static/scripts/embed.js""></script>  Messi escaped a red card for the incident however, receiving only a caution from referee Javier Estrada Fernandez. Yanga-Mbiwa was also booked. The flashpoint represented a rare loss of cool for Messi. The Argentine has never been sent off for Barcelona and has only ever been red-carded once -- on his international debut as a teenager in 2005. Messi's anger soon subsided however as moments after the incident, he doubled Barcelona's lead, making it 2-0 following a superb flowing move involving Luis Suarez, Dani Alves and Neymar, who had scored Barca's first. Ivan Rakitic made it 3-0 in the second half with a long range strike as Barcelona completed a routine win. Barcelona kick off the defence of their Spanish league crown against Athletic Bilbao on August 23."
1193,29/07/2015,04:21,Chelsea defeats Barcelona on penalties,Chelsea goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois made a shootout save and the reigning English Premier League champions beat European kings Barcelona 4-2 on penalties Tuesday in an International Champions Cup friendly.,"The teams were deadlocked 2-2 after full time. Chelsea's Eden Hazard opened the scoring in the 10th minute. Luis Suarez and Sandro Ramirez netted second-half goals to put Barcelona ahead only to have Gary Cahill pull the Blues level with a header in the 85th minute. In the shootout, Alan Halilovic put Barcelona behind when he slammed a shot off the crossbar to open the second round. In the third, Courtois denied Gerard Pique and Chelsea's Ramires and Loic Perry scored to secure the triumph. Both squads are in the training stages of defending their crowns and sought to evaluate talent and test combinations against elite competition to conclude their US tours. Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho, who sent Brazilian defender Filipe Luis to Atletico Madrid hours before the match, wanted a top-notch US farewell before the Blues flew back to London early Wednesday morning and neither side disappointed before 78,914 at the home of the NFL Washington Redskins. Hazard made a sizzling start. The 24-year-old Belgian midfielder raced past three defenders into the left corner of the box and tucked a shot just side the near post past helpless Barca goalkeeper Marc Andre Ter Stegen. The Blues missed more chances as Oscar sent a free kick off the woodwork and Diego Costa missed a great chance in the 32nd minute, sending a shot wide of the far post with only desperate Ter Stegan to deny him. Courtois was tested twice in short order, stopping Suarez and Barca captain Sergio Busquets from long range in the 31st and 32nd minutes. Suarez escaped defender Kurt Zouma for another chance in the 34th but Courtois went low to his right to keep the sheet blank. A Suarez cross gave Ivan Rakitic a 10-meter shot but the Croatian popped his shot well over the crossbar. But in the 52nd minute, Suarez found the equalizer on a beautiful play. He lured out Courtois then chipped the ball over him and across the goal line, crossing just before Zouma's desperate clearing attempt. Ramirez followed in the 66th to put Barcelona ahead, curling a left-footed shot into the far side of the net past Courtois for a 2-1 edge. But Chelsea answered only five minutes before full time when Willian's free kick was headed high into the air and substitute Barcelona goalkeeper Jordi Masip came off his line to try and make the grab. Instead, Cahill nodded the ball into the vacant net even after taking a punch to the head that caused him to be removed from the match. Barcelona, coming off an unprecedented second European treble of La Liga and the Copa del Rey plus the Champions League, was without five players, including standouts Lionel Messi and Neymar, who took part in Copa America last month. Chelsea's three South American players -- Willian, Radamel Falcao and Juan Cuadrado -- had already seen duty as substitutes for the Blues in US warm-up friendlies. Barcelona earlier beat the Los Angeles Galaxy 2-1 and lost 3-1 to Manchester United while Chelsea lost 4-3 to New York Red Bulls and beat Paris Saint-Germain 6-5 on penalties after a 1-1 draw."
1194,27/07/2015,22:20,Barca fined over whistling at Spain's king,"Spanish authorities Monday moved to fine FC Barcelona 66,000 euros ($67,000) and Athletic Bilbao 18,000 euros over last season's Cup final where fans of the Catalan and Basque sides whistled Spain's King Felipe VI.","The state Higher Sports Council proposed the sanctions for ""behaviour whose aim was to transform the sporting event into a stage for political demands through intolerant acts"". These included ""whistling the national anthem and His Majesty the King"", patron of the cup, the council said in a statement. It also proposed a 123,000-euro fine for the Royal Spanish Football Federation as organiser of the Copa del Rey final at Barcelona's Nou Camp ground on May 30, which Barca won 3-1. Fans of both sides drowned out the Spanish national anthem with boos and whistles at the start of the match. The controversy came at a time of high political sensitivities, with Catalan leaders campaigning for independence from Spain ahead of a key regional election expected in September. The sports council's Antiviolence Commission set various administrative fines for the whistling and for alleged security shortcomings including the burning of flares. Those targeted by the fines can appeal against them to the state authorities, who will hear their claims before making a final ruling. The fine against Barcelona consisted of 6,000 euros for failing to take sufficient action beforehand against groups that called the protests, and 60,000 for security breaches. The commission issued an 18,000-euro fine against Athletic Bilbao for failing to crack down on fans who announced their planned protests ahead of the match. It also issued fines for various Catalan pro-independence civil groups."

A satisfied van Gaal hailed the burgeoning attacking partnership between Rooney and new signing Memphis Depay following the win. ""They have always a threat and that's very important,"" van Gaal said. ""I think Barcelona could not cope with the threat of Depay and Rooney."" Van Gaal also saluted the scoring cameo of young Belgian international Januzaj. ""I have to say that Adnan was also a big threat to them in the 30 minutes that he played, so that's good to see,"" he said. However van Gaal cautioned that United's form on their US tour, which wraps up on Wednesday against Paris Saint-Germain in Chicago, would count for nothing if they failed to beat Tottenham in their opening Premier League game next month. He pointed out that United had also beaten the then reigning European champions -- Real Madrid -- in pre-season last year, before losing to Swansea in their opening league match. ""We won last year (against Real Madrid) and it doesn't mean anything because we lost the first match of the Premier League season against Swansea,"" van Gaal said. ""That's why I have said the whole tour, the most important game is not against Barcelona, Paris Saint Germain or Club America it is against Tottenham Hotspur."" Barcelona, missing superstars Lionel Messi and Neymar after their exertions in the Copa America, were left ruing a series of chances which hit the woodwork. Their lone goal came in the 90th minute via Rafinha. Barcelona could have been 2-0 up within the opening minutes, Luis Suarez crashing a free-kick off the post after only four minutes with United goalkeeper David De Gea beaten. Moments later De Gea was pressed into action when Sergi Roberto burst through only to shoot directly at the United keeper with the goal at his mercy. United made Barcelona pay for their early profligacy in the seventh minute when Rooney headed the Red Devils into the lead, punishing slack marking to power Ashley Young's corner into the net past Marc Andre Ter Stegen. The goal boosted United and they grew in confidence, with Depay's movement and interplay with Rooney again catching the eye for United. Young meanwhile should have doubled United's lead in the 28th minute. The left winger advanced purposefully into Barcelona territory and as defenders backed off was presented with a clear shot at goal. The midfielder's shot was too close to Ter Stegen however and the Barcelona keeper was able to parry a reflex save to safety. At the other end Barcelona continued to chase an equaliser and Suarez was left cursing the woodwork once more on 43 minutes when his shot from the edge of the area hit the opposite upright. Barcelona were unlucky not to claim an equaliser just after the hour mark, when Suarez looked to have been fouled by Daley Blind in the penalty area. In the same move Suarez then finished low past De Gea only to be ruled offside. United rang the changes on 63 minutes, removing their entire starting XI as van Gaal indicated he would do before the match. The change yielded instant results, with Tyler Blackett crossing low from the left for Lingard to tuck away the finish for 2-0. United might even have extended their lead moments later when Januzaj latched onto a long ball and shot just wide. Barcelona kept probing for a goal, only for the woodwork to deny them once more in the 72nd minute when Munir El Haddadi's header struck the post."

United boss Van Gaal said Friday he had urged his players to use the occasion as an opportunity to gauge themselves against the most successful side in club football over the past decade. ""I have said to the players it is fantastic to play against Barcelona because you already know a little bit if you're at a certain level, how you to play to win the Champions League,"" van Gaal said. ""Our aim is not to win the Champions League but to be close. Of course I know that this is pre-season and we know every well that winning is not the truth; the performance is more important than the result."" United have often found themselves on the wrong end of Barcelona's sorcery in Europe over the past decade, losing two Champions League finals to the Catalans in 2009 and 2011. United captain Wayne Rooney, a veteran of both of those final defeats, welcomes the opportunity to lock horns with the Spanish treble-winners once more. ""Obviously over the last few years they've been probably the best team in Europe,"" Rooney told reporters. ""It's down to us to try and prove we're as good as them. It's good that tomorrow we're playing against them and it will show us where we're at in terms of how we want to play, and how we play against them."" Saturday's encounter is the third game of United's four-match US tour, which culminates next week against Paris Saint-Germain at Chicago's Soldier Field. Barcelona meanwhile opened their pre-season US tour on Tuesday, beating Los Angeles Galaxy 2-1 at the Pasadena Rose Bowl. Barcelona have travelled with a depleted squad missing stars such as Lionel Messi and Neymar, who were excused after playing in the Copa America."
1199,22/07/2015,07:13,"Suarez, Roberto lift Barcelona to 2-1 win over Galaxy",Luis Suarez and Sergi Roberto scored as European Champions Barcelona launched their pre-season North American tour with a convincing 2-1 win over the Los Angeles Galaxy on Tuesday.,"Uruguay international Suarez came out on top in a clash with former Liverpool team-mate Steven Gerrard -- the Galaxy's latest acquisition from Europe. His 45th-minute strike and Roberto's 56th-minute goal ensured that even without such stars as Argentina's Lionel Messi and Brazilian Neymar -- let off the pre-season tour after Copa America duty -- Barcelona got the win their dominant performance deserved in front of 93,226 fans at Pasadena's Rose Bowl. In their first pre-season friendly in prepration for their defence of their La Liga, Copa Del Rey and Champions League treble, Barcelona pressed relentlessly from the start and were finally rewarded in the 45th minute when Suarez fired a left-footed shot past Galaxy keeper Brian Rowe after Rafinha's deflected cross was moved on by Bartra and Galaxy defender Leonardo was unable to clear the danger. Suarez had been off-target from the center of the area in the 11th and from long range in the 23rd, while Rowe made a diving save of Roberto's attempt from outside the box in the 35th. Both teams made wholesale changes at the break, with Suarez among the seven Barcelona players to depart and Andres Iniesta and Gerard Pique entering the game. Galaxy coach Bruce Arena made five halftime substitutions, with Gerrard and Keane among those departing. The changes didn't slow Barca, with Douglas going close in the 47th minute and Pique testing substitute Galaxy keeper Andrew Wolverton in the 53rd after a pass from Munir. Munir also helped set up Roberto's 56th-minute strike from the edge of the box -- which brought joyous cheers of ""Barca! Barca!"" from the crowd. The minority of Galaxy fans in the stands, on a balmy night in the foothills northeast of Los Angeles, had little to cheer for much of the match, although Tommy Meyer grabbed a consolation goal in the first minute of injury time, heading in from close range. The Galaxy now head back into MLS action, visiting the Dynamo in Houston on Sunday as they continue their bid to defend their title. Barcelona next travel up the coast to take on Manchester United on Saturday at Levi's Stadium, home of the NFL's San Francisco 49ers. They complete their US swing against English champions Chelsea on July 28 in suburban Washington DC before playing Fiorentina in Florence on August 2."
1200,21/07/2015,23:13,Gabon denies paying Messi millions to lay stadium stone,Gabon's presidency on Tuesday denied paying four-time World Player of the Year Lionel Messi millions of dollars to lay the foundation stone for a 2017 Africa Cup of Nations stadium last weekend.,"""The Republic of Gabon denies having paid, or even promised to pay, such a sum of money to the Argentinian international footballer Lionel Messi,"" the presidency said in a statement. The 28-year-old multi-millionaire -- who turned up unshaven, in a torn pair of shorts -- travelled to Port-Gentil, the nation's economic capital, at the invitation of President Ali Bongo, according to the statement. Messi ""accompanied the head of state to Port-Gentil to lay the foundation stone for the town's future stadium, in the perspective of the 2017 Africa Cup of Nations (which Gabon is hosting),"" the statement added. Messi's presence at the event had caused controversy on social media, with many Gabonese questioning the cost of his visit to a country where over a third of the population live below the poverty line, despite the nation boasting oil riches. The influential football weekly 'France Football' added fuel to the fire on Monday when it claimed the Barcelona maestro had received the 3.5 million euros ($3.8 million) for his appearance. The controversy surrounding Messi's visit comes hot on the heels of the striker's second huge disappointment in a major final with the national side when they lost on penalties to hosts Chile in the Copa America on July 4, after losing to Germany in extra-time of last year's World Cup final. ""Good move or a communications coup for Ali Bongo?"", one person wondered on Twitter, under a photograph of the Gabonese president at the wheel of a convertible Mercedes Jeep driving through the crowds in Libreville, with Messi beside him in the passenger seat. Messi's shabby look prompted a multitude of derisory remarks on Facebook with several Gabonese posting photos of themselves in shorts and flip-flops with a suitcase in one hand and a straw hat on their heads, pretending they were en route to South America. ""Today the Argentinian president is going to drive a taxi-bus and pick us up!"" one remark read. Another image circulating on social media that caught people's imagination was a remodelled cover of the legendary comic book ""Tintin in the Congo"" renamed ""Tintin Messi in the Gabon"", with the star footballer being driven by Bongo, and Tintin's ever faithful dog 'Snowy' in the back seat."
1201,20/07/2015,13:19,Guardiola to stand for Catalan independence in vote,"Bayern Munich coach and Barcelona hero Pep Guardiola will make a symbolic stand for election to the Catalan parliament in a campaign for his native region to be independent from Spain, media reported Monday.","Spanish newspaper El Pais said Guardiola, 44, would stand as the last candidate on the electoral list for the pro-independence alliance planning to run in the election in September. Being the last name on the list would make him unable to win a seat in the regional parliament, El Pais said -- but the former player and coach would be a powerful talisman for the independence movement. He led Barcelona to domestic and Champions League glory as coach of the club, one of the most powerful institutions in the region. Guardiola has several times publicly displayed his support for the drive to make Catalonia break away from Spain. He flew over from Munich last November to vote in a symbolic non-biding ballot on the issue held by regional leaders. Spain's national government fiercely opposes independence for Catalonia and has mounted court challenges against regional president Artur Mas's attempts to organise a full referendum. Now left- and right- wing leaders in the rich northeastern region want to hold a regular regional election on September 27 to serve as a de facto plebiscite on independence. Mas's centre-right CDC party and the left-wing ERC sealed a pact last week to run on a joint ticket in favour of independence, along with leaders of the influential pro-independence civil groups ANC and Omnium. The parties agreed that if they jointly win a majority, they will form a coalition government that will aim to achieve independence within 18 months. They were due to formally present their list of candidates later on Monday."
1202,19/07/2015,00:01,Bartomeu re-elected as Barcelona president,Josep Maria Bartomeu was re-elected as president of European and Spanish champions Barcelona after seeing off rival Joan Laporta.,"Bartomeu, 52, polled 25,823 votes (54.63%) with Laporta, a former president, winning 15,615 votes (33.03%). Other contenders were businessman Agusti Benedito 3,386 votes (7.16%) and lawyer Toni Freixa with 1,750 (3.70%). With 47,720 votes counted, the election had the third highest turnout in Barcelona history -- only 2010 with 57,088 votes and 2003 with 51,618 have been greater. Bartomeu, who took over as president early last year after his predecessor Sandro Rosell stepped down, will lead Barcelona for the next six years. Polls opened at 9am local time (0700 GMT) with almost 110,000 members entitled to vote. Barcelona, just like their great rivals Real Madrid but in contrast to other leading European clubs, are owned by their members -- of whom there are more than 150,000 in total -- and elections are usually held every six years. However, this election was called a year early by Bartomeu at a time when tensions inside the club were running high because of poor relations between Barca coach Luis Enrique and star player Lionel Messi -- something that was remedied in dramatic fashion when they won the treble of Champions League, La Liga and Copa del Rey in the spring. The team's success on the field and the club's success off it, with Barcelona returning a record profit of 608 million euros ($650m, £422m), meant Bartomeu was the favourite to beat the challenge of Laporta. ""We must continue to be the number one club and these six years are very important,"" Bartomeu said after casting his vote on Saturday morning. Laporta was in charge from 2003-10 and it was to his credit that he appointed Pep Guardiola in the coaching job in 2008 -- a decision which sparked a trophy-laden spell of success -- although his financial record has been criticised. Laporta attacked Bartomeu for standing despite facing criminal charges along with Rosell. Rosell, a former ally of Laporta's before the two fell out in 2005, resigned last year when investigations began into alleged misappropriation of funds in the signing of Brazilian star Neymar from Santos. Bartomeu, who had been the vice-president, stepped up to replace Rosell but in May a court ordered him to stand trial along with the club in the Neymar case. Laporta, 53, also criticised Bartomeu's more nuanced stand on Catalan independence which is in stark contrast to his own position. He has spent the past eight years dabbling in politics, and said he wants Barca to return to the ""values"" of his previous term in office, with an emphasis on bringing through players from La Masia, the club's renowned youth academy, and bringing back the Unicef logo on team shirts. He also said that he would look to sign French international midfielder Paul Pogba from Juventus -- he is also a reported target of English side Manchester City. Barcelona are currently serving a FIFA-imposed transfer ban that means any new signings cannot play for the club until 2016."
1203,18/07/2015,18:47,Bitter Barcelona election set to reach climax,"The future direction of European champions Barcelona will be decided on Saturday as almost 110,000 'socios' vote whether to retain confidence in incumbent Josep Maria Bartomeu or a previous president, Joan Laporta.","There are two other candidates -- small businessman Agusti Benedito and lawyer and former club spokesman Toni Freixa -- but they are unlikely to cause an upset in an election that has become increasingly acrimonious. Of the 109,367 members who have the right to vote, just over a third had done so by 6pm local time (1600 GMT). The polls at the Camp Nou close at 9pm local time, with the winner likely to be announced a few hours after that. Laporta was in charge from 2003-10 and has to his credit that he appointed Pep Guardiola to the coaching job in 2008 -- a decision which sparked a trophy-laden spell of success. Also regarded as being financially unsound, Laporta has attacked Bartomeu and his predecessor, Sandro Rosell, for standing despite facing criminal charges. ""We have two men, Mr Bartomeu and (his predecessor Sandro) Rosell, who are being pursued for corruption...if they had a minimum of decency they would not stand,"" said Laporta at the press conference when he announced his decision to stand.

Several other internationals who played in the tournament have also been excused from the US tour, including goalkeeper Claudio Bravo, midfielder Javier Mascherano and fullback Dani Alves.

He has flown out to link up with his new team-mates for a pre-season tournament in Singapore. Stoke, who have been extremely active in the transfer market in the close season signing seven players, did not reveal the transfer fee nor the length of the contract for El Ouriachi, who declined a new contract offer from Barcelona. ""Moha's excited about joining a Premier League club,"" said Stoke chief executive Tony Scholes. ""He has seen the progress made by Bojan and Marc and wants to try to do likewise."" El Ouriachi joins Spanish striker Joselu, goalkeepers veteran Irish international Shay Given and young Danish prospect Jakob Haugaard, defenders England international fullback Glen Johnson and German centreback Philipp Wollscheid plus Dutch midfielder Marco van Ginkel, who is on loan from champions Chelsea, in joining the club. Stoke, though, have lost two influential players. Bosnian international goalkeeper Asmir Begovic moved to Chelsea on Monday and former French Under-21 international midfielder Steven Nzonzi was sold to Europa League holders Sevilla for a club record fee of £7 million ($10.7m, 9.7m euros) last week."

""I respect any decision the player may make and I am aware that for a certain sum he could leave."" The 27-year-old forward recently signed a new contract which lowers his buyout clause from 150 million down to 30 million euros ($33m, £21.3m). Despite having renewed his deal until 2019, he has told media recently he is willing to leave after finding himself behind the star trio of Lionel Messi, Neymar and Luis Suarez in the pecking order during last season's treble-winning campaign. ""There have obviously been offers and I am in a difficult situation in the club,"" Pedro told reporters on Monday. ""You always want to play more, have more options and be in the front line.""

League champions Barcelona will look to defend their Spanish league and cup titles as well as their European Champions league crown after a stunning triple last season. They have a busy start to the new season with home and away ties against Athletic Bilbao on August 14 and 21 in the Spanish Supercopa. That trophy pits the league champions against the winners of the Copa del Rey -- or in this case the runners-up, since Barca won that title too. Barca and Athletic will meet again just days after that cup is decided, playing their first league match in Bilbao on the weekend of August 22-23. The last league games will be played on May 15. Real Madrid, league runners-up this year in a disappointing trophyless season, will play their first match of the league against newly promoted side Sporting Gijon. Third-place Atletico Madrid will play their first league match against another newly promoted side, Las Palmas. The end of last season's Liga was nearly thrown into chaos when players and the federation threatened to strike over a new television broadcasting deal. They demanded more money from auctioning the rights to lucrative Liga games be redistributed to smaller clubs. The strike was called off after a court ruled it illegal. In a speech before Tuesday's draw, RFEF President Angel Maria Villar repeated his complaint that the federation's demands were not listened to in the television dispute. ""We have been trampled on,"" he told federation officials. League head Javier Tebas has alleged that the strike threat was a smokescreen in a dispute between the RFEF and the state over subsidies."

It will not be easy but I hope to have a good transition,"" the 28-year-old told a news conference after being officially presented at the club. Turan became a star of coach Diego Simeone's tough and physical Atletico side after arriving in Spain from Galatasaray in 2011. Now he will play behind the striking trio of Argentine star Lionel Messi, Brazil's Neymar and Uruguay's Luis Suarez in a team noted for its skills and passing-based game. He said he had received offers from other clubs but did not hesitate to sign the five-year contract with Barcelona, reigning European champions. The club said in a statement on July 6 that it would pay an initial fee of 34 million euros ($38 million) with a potential seven million euros more in bonuses. Turan's transfer has still to be ratified by the club's new board after members elect a new president on July 18. He will not be able to make his debut for Barcelona until 2016 when they serve out a FIFA transfer ban over alleged violations of rules on signing minors."
1210,09/07/2015,18:41,Laporta hits out at rivals in Barcelona presidential race,Former Barcelona president Joan Laporta has hit out at current incumbent Josep Maria Bartomeu and old rival Sandro Rosell for standing in this month's elections despite facing criminal charges.,"""We have two men, Mr Bartomeu and (his predecessor Sandro) Rosell, who are being pursued for corruption...if they had a minimum of decency they would not stand,"" said Laporta at a press conference in Madrid to launch his own campaign for election. Laporta previously served as president at the Camp Nou from 2003 to 2010 before his mandate ended and Rosell was elected as his successor. But Rosell, a former ally of Laporta's before the two fell out in 2005, resigned last year when investigations began into alleged misappropriation of funds in the signing of Brazilian star Neymar from Santos. Bartomeu, who had been the vice-president, stepped up to replace Rosell but in May a court ordered him to stand trial along with the club in the Neymar case. Candidates hoping to stand in the July 18 election for president of the Spanish and European champions need a minimum of 2,534 signatures of support from club socios (members). Barca's on-field success following their treble of Champions League, La Liga and Copa del Rey last season means Bartomeu is the favourite to win the election and remain as president -- he has received the support of 8,554 members compared to 4,272 for Laporta. Also standing are Catalan entrepreneur Agusti Benedito and Antoni Freixa, a lawyer and part of the board under Bartomeu. Laporta has also emphasised his position in favour of Catalan independence and criticised the Bartomeu regime for their ""ambiguous"" stance on the matter. ""I don't hide that I am in favour of the process undertaken by Artur Mas,"" he said, in reference to the president of the Catalan autonomous government, who is a supporter of Catalan independence. Laporta says he wants Barca to return to the ""values"" of his previous term in office, with an emphasis on bringing through players from La Masia, the club's renowned youth academy, and bringing back the Unicef logo on team shirts. He also said that he would look to sign French international midfielder Paul Pogba from Juventus -- who is also a reported target of English side Manchester City -- and added a decision on whether to keep Turkish international Arda Turan would be ""studied"" by the technical staff and coach Luis Enrique. The 28-year-old Turk was signed on Monday from Atletico Madrid on a five-year deal for a fee that could reach 41 million euros ($45m, £29m). However, Barcelona added the signing comes with a clause that will allow the incoming president to sell Turan back to Atletico, albeit doing so will incur a fine of 10 percent of the transfer fee paid. In any case, Turan will not be able to make his debut for Barcelona until 2016, by which time the reigning European champions will have completed a FIFA-imposed transfer ban."
1211,08/07/2015,16:17,Istanbul names street after Barca newcomer Turan,"A working class Istanbul suburb on Wednesday announced it would name one of its streets in honour of one its most famous sons, the Turkish football star Arda Turan who this week signed for Barcelona.","Turan, 28, was born in the Istanbul suburb of Bayrampasa in 1987, and his first matches were for the gritty western district's lowly local team Altintepsi Makelspor. He was snapped up by Istanbul giants Galatasaray in 2005 and then moved on in 2011 to Atletico Madrid, becoming a huge favourite with fans and an icon of Turkish football. His signing for Barcelona makes him just the second Turkish player to join the Catalan giants after goalkeeper Rustu Recber in 2003 and the move was hailed by Turkey's national press. ""We are going to make Arda one or two surprises,"" said the mayor of Bayrampasa Atila Aydiner as he hosted Turan on a visit to his home district. ""We are going to call Ordu (Military) Street Arda Turan Street. We have sent our decision to the Istanbul municipality,"" he said in comments broadcast on Turkish television. ""We are now going to hang a plaque there together with our Arda. Because Arda is our pride,"" said the mayor, who was warmly thanked by Turan. The street in Bayrampasa is where Turan grew up. Turan has been quoted in the press expressing his admiration for Turkey's Islamic-rooted President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, saying in February this year that the football loving-leader was ""like a friend"". While Turan's signing for Barcelona -- on a five-year deal for a fee that could reach 41 million euros -- has been hailed as a breakthrough for a Turkish footballer, he will have to wait several months for his first performance at the Camp Nou. Barcelona were banned from making new signings in 2015 after FIFA found them guilty of breaching rules on the transfers of players aged under 18. This means that Turan will have to wait a half season before making his Barcelona debut in early 2016."
1212,08/07/2015,03:00,Barcelona keep big money stars on the sidelines,Barcelona will keep more than 60 million euros ($65 million) of talent on the sidelines for six months having signed Turkish international Arda Turan and Aleix Vidal knowing that they cannot play until next year.,"More big money deals could follow. A FIFA ban on making official signings until January 2016 has not stopped the Spanish giants from plunging into the market ahead of a messy year of internal tensions and high profile trials for Barcelona and some of its stars. Barcelona on Monday announced they had beaten Chelsea to secure 28-year-old midfielder Turan from Atletico Madrid on a five-year deal for a fee that could reach 41 million euros. That follows the 18-million-euro signing of right-back Vidal from Sevilla last month. Others are expected to follow with media reports indicating Barcelona are trying to line up a deal for Juventus' midfielder Paul Pogba which would see him arrive at the end of next season. Barcelona were banned from making new signings in 2015 after FIFA found them guilty of breaching rules on the transfers of players aged under 18. Turan, captain of Turkey's national team and a prolific goalscorer with Atletico, has not yet indicated what he thinks about sitting out half a season. Vidal says it is a sacrifice worth making to join Europe's most successful team of the past decade. ""When I was told that it would really happen, I didn't think it was a hassle to come and spend a few months without playing,"" he said just after the transfer was announced. Turan and Vidal have arrived at a complicated time for Barcelona as the team prepares for the election of a new president on July 18. Transfer policy has been at the centre of the debate between incumbent Josep Maria Bartomeu and challenger Joan Laporta. Because of the election, the Barcelona managing committee could not approve the Turan transfer and a clause in the deal was included saying that he could be sold back at a 10-percent discount if the new president so decides. Laporta called the Turan deal ""improper"" and said Bartomeu should have completed the transfer before resigning to stand in the campaign. ""The urgency of this operation is out of order. The only explanation is that it favours Bartomeu's candidacy. ""There was already a lack of transparency in Neymar's signing and I think that it is insane that the management committee is playing this game,"" he said. Barcelona and their top manager are to stand trial over the transfer of Neymar. Spanish prosecutors allege that secret commissions were paid as part of the deal. The club bought the Brazilian captain in 2013 for what they said was 57 million euros ($41 million). A Madrid judge says the fee was closer to 83 million euros. Fellow striker Lionel Messi could also stand trial on tax fraud charges. Investigators allege his father Jorge organised a complex network of companies that kept 4.1 million ($5.5 million) from tax authorities between 2007 and 2009."

The 28-year-old Turkish international has been a key player in Diego Simeone's Atletico side in recent seasons after arriving in Spain from Galatasaray in 2011. And Barcelona said that coach Luis Enrique had requested the signing as the Catalans look to strengthen their midfield following the departure of long-serving Xavi Hernandez. However, he arrives at the Camp Nou at a time of uncertainty, with a board running club affairs until elections for a new president are held on July 18. Barcelona therefore added that the signing comes with a clause that will allow the incoming president to sell Turan back to Atletico, albeit doing so will incur a fine of 10 percent of the transfer fee paid. In any case, Turan will not be able to make his debut for Barcelona until 2016, by which time the reigning European champions will have completed a FIFA-imposed transfer ban. He is the second new signing made by the Catalans this close season, after a deal was made with Sevilla last month to sign Aleix Vidal."

""The case will be decided during the next control, ethics and disciplinary meeting on July 23,"" he added. UEFA rules band the use of ""symbols, actions of songs that are not within the context of a sports event, especially messages of a political, ideological, religious, offensive and provocative nature."" Barcelona face a stiff fine and partial stadium closure if found to have violated UEFA rules. During the 3-1 win over Juventus in Berlin on June 6 the club's supporters displayed red and yellow Catalan separatist flags from the stands and chanted slogans in favour of independence for the wealthy northeastern region of Spain. Barcelona will appeal UEFA's decision, citing respect for freedom of expression of its supporters, a club spokesman said. The club has historically had close ties with Catalan nationalism. Barca backed a symbolic independence referendum organised in November by the regional government of Catalonia which was fiercely opposed by the central government in Madrid. During Barcelona's 3-1 King Cup final win over Athletic Bilbao on May 30 supporters from both teams jeered while Spain's national anthem was played. After the match Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy's office issued a statement condemning ""attacks against symbols that represent all Spaniards"". Athletic Bilbao is based in Spain's northern Basque County which like Catalonia has an active independence movement."

1218,10/06/2015,18:45,"Messi loses appeal, tax fraud trial nears","Barcelona star Lionel Messi lost his appeal over tax fraud charges on Wednesday, meaning he could face a trial over the allegations which involve an estimated 4.6 million euros.","The Argentine international and his father Jorge were accused last year of not paying tax on earnings from the player's image rights from 2007-2009. Both Messi and his father denied wrongdoing and instead pointed the finger instead at a former agent. But prosecutors in Barcelona on Wednesday decided to press ahead with the case. ""While it is understandable that a player of this magnitude is not aware of all the details of managing a millionaire,"" they said ""there are elements of a fiscal debt"". Messi and his father have been accused of using companies in Belize and Uruguay to sell the player's rights -- an allegation the player denies. Jorge has since admitted that his son knew nothing of the alleged fraud, but the appeals court rejected the defence. ""Messi could have had knowledge of the irregularities of contracts which he was signing,"" said a statement. Four-time World Player of the Year Messi is one of the world's richest sportsmen. Forbes magazine estimated that in 2014 his income was 64.7 million dollars (47.30 million euros)."
1219,09/06/2015,20:30,"Barcelona board setps down, to stand for re-election",The Barcelona board resigned Tuesday as expected to stand for relection by the Spanish giants' members after a season in which the team won the treble despite a series of legal woes.,"""I present my resignation to allow fresh elections to take place. Members must chose the model that they want for the club for the next six years,"" Barcelona president Josep Maria Bartomeu told a news conference. Unlike most Spanish football clubs which are private companies, Barcelona belongs to its 153,000 members who elect a management board every six years. The mandate of Bartomeu's board lasted until 2016 but he decided to bring the election forward to face his critics. Barcelona was shaken at the beginning of the year by tensions between its coach, Luis Enrique, and its star player, Argentine forward Lionel Messi. The tensions seem to have vanished after Barcelona won the treble -- the European, Spanish league and cup titles -- and Enrique agreed earlier Tuesday to extend his contract by one year until June 2017. Bartomeu, who became president of the club following the resignation of his predecessor Sandro Rosell and was not elected by the club's members, was also weakened by a series of scandals. A Spanish court in March accused the club and its management of fabricating a labyrinth of contracts to hide the real cost of the signing the Brazilian international Neymar in 2013. A date for their trial for tax fraud and fraudulent administration has not yet been set. If found guilty Bartomeu and Rosell possible prison sentences while Barcelona could be ordered to pay a fine of 22.2 million euros ($24.8 million). Bartomeu took over when Rosell resigned in January 2014 after being named a suspect in the case and investigated for misappropriating funds to hide the transfer cost. The club has also been banned from making transfers during 2015 after FIFA said it had broken rules regarding the signing of youth players. Bartomeu in January relented to pressure following Barcelona's failure to overturn FIFA's ban by calling for early club elections this summer. ""I will defend my model for the club because I believe we have done well and Barca should continue to lead world football,"" he said on Tuesday. Former Barcelona president Joan Laporta is widely expected to announce that he will stand in the election. Laporta has hinted for many months that he would be interested in leading the Catalan club for a second time after he steered Barca to a host of trophies in his first spell in charge between 2003 and 2010."

Alves, who joined the Catalan club from Sevilla in 2008, has gone on to appear in 343 matches for Barca, more than any other foreigner in the history of the club. During that time he has won 19 titles, including five La Ligas, three Champions Leagues, three Spanish Cups, two European Super Cups, four Spanish Super Cups and two Club World Cups. He forms part of the group of seven players that were in both of Barca's treble winning squads: the latest completed in Berlin with victory over Juventus on the weekend; and that of his first season, 2008-09, when he was forced to sit out the European Cup final in Rome against Manchester United through suspension."

Fans were routed to fly out of the German capital by first assembling in a ""disused"" hangar at Schonefeld airport which was supposed to be ""fitted out"" for the occasion. But the fans who made their way to the site between 0100 and 0500 local time found the hangar devoid of any seating and without running water, an AFP journalist reported. Barcelona claim the Berlin authorities failed to provide ""minimum services"", with the club also pointing to the lack of coaches to bring fans to planes leading to major hold-ups. They also pointed to insufficient flight information and inadequate facilities for passengers with psychical disabilities. Luis Suarez and Neymar scored second-half goals to give Barcelona a 3-1 Champions League final victory over Juventus on Saturday as the Spaniards became the first team to twice win the European treble."

The German was impressive in keeping the Juventus attack at bay and his performance caught the eye of Germany's World Cup-winning coach. ""I am, of course, especially happy for Marc-Andre ter Stegen. He has been rewarded with this title for all his perseverance and his consistently good performances,"" Loew told dfb.de. Ter Stegen, who joined Barca from Borussia Monchengladbach last year, forced his way into the starting side having sat on the bench for most of their Spanish league matches. ""It is simply awesome to have won the title. We played outstanding football and the team deserved it,"" said Ter Stegen. ""It's not been an easy year for me, but it's not about the individual, it's about the team."" He will travel with Germany's Under-21 squad to play in the junior European Championships in the Czech Republic later this month which serves as an Olympic qualifier. The German youngster had dropped down the pecking order of goalkeepers after allowing the ball to roll into his own net following a back pass in Germany's 4-3 friendly defeat to the USA on tour in 2013. Now 23 and full of confidence, he may well add to his four senior caps in future friendlies, but Bayern Munich's Manuel Neuer, who is 29-years-old, remains Loew's first-choice goalkeeper. ""For me, he has made a further step, he shines despite his young age and already plays with tremendous authority. His development is not finished yet,"" said Germany's goalkeeping coach Andreas Koepke. The senior Germany squad host the USA in a friendly on Wednesday before their Euro 2016 qualifier against Gibraltar away next Saturday with Dortmund's Roman Weidenfeller and Hanover's Ron-Robert Zieler called up."
1224,07/06/2015,12:35,Barcelona eye more history after second European treble,Luis Enrique says Barcelona aim to become the first team to defend the Champions League title as the head coach considers his future despite steering them to an historic treble.,"Luis Suarez and Neymar scored second-half goals to give Barcelona a 3-1 Champions League final victory over Juventus on Saturday as the Spaniards became the first team to twice win the European treble. Enrique capped his first season as Barcelona's head coach by matching Pep Guardiola's feat from the 2008/09 season when the Catalans captured the European, Spanish league and cup titles. An early goal by Barca's Ivan Rakitic was cancelled out when Juventus' ex-Real Madrid striker Alvaro Morata equalised on 55 minutes. But Suarez put the game beyond the Italian champions with a 68th minute strike off a rebound at Berlin's Olympic Stadium before Neymar added the third with the last kick of the game in the 97th minute. Barcelona have now won five European titles, four of which came in the last decade after their 2006, 2009 and 2011 triumphs. Enrique says their hunger for silverware is insatiable and they want to make more history by becoming the first team to win back-to-back Champions League titles. ""This is our 60th match (this season) with six defeats and four draws,"" said the 45-year-old. ""Those figures show that this has been one of Barcelona's best campaigns. ""In the last ten years, this has been the most successful club in Europe. ""These players have shown hunger for victories and they've shown they enjoy it so much, we have to nourish them with more titles."" Enrique is yet to commit to a second season ahead of the club's presidential elections as he has had a tense relationship with current incumbent Josep Maria Bartomeu. ""I want to celebrate the win, but the time will come when decisions must be made,"" said Enrique. ""It's been a difficult year with lots of transition, but I have to thank all those who have trusted me to lead Barcelona."" Juventus suffered the unwanted fate of becoming the first team to lose six European Cup finals, 30 years after winning the trophy for the first time which was overshadowed by the Heysel Stadium disaster. On the streets of Barcelona, where you could have heard a pin drop during the final, thousands of ecstatic fans dressed in their team colours of blue and red celebrated with cheers, chants and fire crackers. ""It's a dream, I still can't believe it!"" said Eduard Ocana, a 23-year-old student, in the Catalan capital, as cries of ""champions, champions!"" echoed around the famous party street of Las Ramblas. For Suarez it was a triumphant end to a first season with the Spanish champions after his ignominious biting ban at the World Cup. ""It's incredible, it's something unique,"" he said. ""The best thing about this side is the spirit and the fact we've been united since the start of the season."" In 2009 Barcelona joined the elite club of treble winners that include Celtic, Ajax, PSV Eindhoven, Manchester United, Inter Milan and Bayern Munich. Now, they are the first to have done that twice. Despite brief moments of magic, Lionel Messi failed to become the first player to score in three Champions League finals as he along with captain Andres Iniesta and Barca icon Xavi Hernandez -- in his final match for the club -- equalled Dutch star Clarence Seedorf's tally of four winners' medals. Barcelona showed early nerves with two uncustomary mistakes in defence straight from kick-off before Rakitic gave the Catalan giants the lead with just four minutes gone. Neymar fed Iniesta from the left wing and the Spain international squared for Rakitic to drill home from close range, past Juventus captain Gianluigi Buffon. Juve came back into the game midway through the first half, but Suarez forced Buffon, who failed to claim a winners' medal at the 12th attempt, into another save as it finished 1-0 at the break. Juve got the equaliser they had threatened when defender Stephan Lichtsteiner's cross found Carlos Tevez, whose shot was parried by Barca goalkeeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen, only for Morata to rifle home the loose ball on 55 minutes. It was his first goal against Barcelona despite four years at the Bernabeu having left Madrid last year. The goal breathed life back into Juve's ambitions, but it was a touch of Messi magic which led to the decisive goal. The Argentina international attacked the Juve defence with a mazy run and although Buffon blocked his shot, Suarez fired home the rebound on 68 minutes. ""Unfortunately when you play against great players, you think you have things under control, then they can turn the game, as happen tonight,"" said Juventus coach Massimiliano Allegri. ""We're sorry to have missed our chance, but I can't criticise the team."" Xavi came on for his final game in the Barca shirt in the dying stages as he made history with a record 151st Champions League appearance before joining Qatari side Al Sadd next season. ""To leave this way is amazing,"" said the Spain international, who lost his place in the starting side to Rakitic this season. The scene was set for Neymar to cap his first Champions League final with Barcelona's third just before the final whistle. Juventus hailed the achievement of Allegri in getting the team to the final during his first season in charge, and beating 2014 winners Real Madrid in the semis. ""You gave us a dream. Thanks, mister,"" said Juventus's official Twitter account."

The Italy international kept his side in the game with a string of superb saves, which for a while held Barcelona's star-studded attack at bay. After Ivan Rakitic gave Barcelona an early lead in Berlin on Saturday, Juventus drew level with an Alvaro Morata second-half equaliser. Juventus missed out on a third European crown as Luis Suarez put Barca ahead in the second-half, with Neymar scoring Barca's third with the last kick of the game. Buffon says Juventus started to believe they could win the final after Morata's 55th minute goal, only for Barcelona to pull away and prove their status as Europe's top team. ""There was a moment, a ten-minute spell, when we thought we had the match in our hands and that's exactly when we lost it,"" rued the Juventus captain as Barcelona claimed the treble with their fifth European title. ""It would have been an extraordinary result. ""We didn't manage to win, but not because we didn't' try: we gave everything we had. ""Barcelona are the best team in the world in my opinion, but we have proved that we could compete."" Having steered Juventus to the Italian league and cup double on his first season in charge, their coach Massimiliano Allegri says his target is to now to defend the Serie A title and keep them amongst the top eight sides in Europe. Buffon echoed those sentiments and says the team has a bright future. ""We conceded early on, but we were always in the game. ""This performance gives us hope and confidence. ""We can make sure we stay at this level next season and within the next two or three years - who knows? - maybe I'll manage to make some other dreams come true."""
1226,07/06/2015,10:39,Leaving Barca tough for record-breaking Xavi,Record-breaker Xavi Hernandez says it will be tough to leave Barcelona after lifting the Champions League trophy on his final appearance in the famous strip.,"The 35-year-old came on in the 78th minute to set a new record of 151 Champions League appearances in Barcelona's 3-1 win over Juventus in the final in Berlin which was the fourth time he had won European club football's most prestigious trophy. Having started at the Catalan giants as an 11-year-old, Xavi will join Qatari side Al Sadd next season. He admitted that leaving Barcelona will hit him hard having won his 25th title with the club. The final took a dramatic turn when an early goal by Barca's Ivan Rakitic was cancelled out by Juventus' ex-Real Madrid striker Alvaro Morata with the equaliser on 55 minutes. But Xavi says Barcelona's superstar Lionel Messi made the difference as his brilliant run led to Luis Suarez making it 2-1 to the Spaniards in the second-half before Neymar scored their third at the death. ""To leave this way is amazing, but I have a bit of nostalgia thinking I'm never going to play for this side again and I really wanted to lift the cup,"" said Xavi, who lost his place in the starting side to Rakitic this season. ""We suffered a lot, because Juve put pressure on us, but Leo [Messi] popped up again. ""The side is sensational and Messi is outrageous."" Xavi said the best thing for Barcelona now is for Luis Enrique to stay on with the head coach having left his future open, despite winning the treble of European, cup and league titles in his debut season. ""Luis Enrique deserves this because he's had a lot of criticism, but he's been a great leader for the side. The best thing for next year is for Luis Enrique to stay,"" said Xavi. Defender Gerard Pique said that Xavi was part of a ""unique generation"" at Barcelona that has overcome seasons without a trophy as well as enjoyed triumphs. ""Xavi deserves everything,"" said Pique. ""He is leaving us with an important legacy: how to play football and take on victory and defeat. He will always be with us."" This was the fifth time Barcelona have been crowned European champions and it is their fourth Champions League title in the last decade after their 2006, 2009 and 2011 triumphs. ""I'm lost for words. It's spectacular to win three trophies in a season once again,"" said Barcelona captain Andreas Iniesta, who was replaced by Xavi, and was part of the 2009 treble-winning team. ""I think there's not enough words to express how proud we are. ""Both trebles are special. The first time you think you'll never do it again, and yet we have. It's a proud day for Barca. ""We want to do it all again next year and win a sixth title. ""You can never rest on what we have achieved. ""At a club like this, we have to look for the next challenge. ""But right at the moment, I just want to enjoy winning this fifth title for the club."" Having handed over his arm-band to Xavi and the privilege of being the first to lift the trophy, Iniesta said it was only fitting for the club veteran to bow out on the big stage. ""It is perfect for him and the club. There is no better send-off than lifting the Champions League,"" said Iniesta."
1227,07/06/2015,04:10,Success brings doubts as Enrique shadows Guardiola,When Luis Enrique was hired as Barcelona boss just over a year ago his challenge was a daunting one; to bring back the glory years of Pep Guardiola.,"Fast-forward 12 months and Enrique has not for the first time in his career followed in Guardiola's footsteps by landing the treble: Saturday's 3-1 defeat of Juventus added the Champions League to La Liga and Copa del Rey triumphs. Enrique succeeded Guardiola as Barca captain in his playing days in the 1990s and as Barca B coach when the Bayern Munich boss took the top job at the Camp Nou in 2009. Yet, they took different routes to delivering Barca's two best seasons in a storied 115-year history. Whereas the fiercely proud Catalan Guardiola was loved not only for winning, but imposing a style of play that saw many round the world hail his side as the best in the history of football, Enrique has had to overcome doubts and dressing room revolt before ending the season on top. Even now he has doubts about his future. After leaving star duo Lionel Messi and Neymar on the bench for a 1-0 defeat to Real Sociedad and January, Enrique was rumoured to be on the verge of the sack. In the week following the Sociedad defeat he saw a trusted ally in sporting director Andoni Zubizarreta sacked and another former teammate Carles Puyol walk out on the club in solidarity with Zubizarreta. A stubborn character who once turned his back on Real Madrid to cross Spanish football's great divide, the 45-year-old appears not to have forgotten that criticism as he has ruled out leaving the club. ""The truth is I don't know if I will continue,"" he said. Barca president Josep Maria Bartomeu called club elections for this summer when under pressure in January. And whether it is he or a new face in charge of the club come July is likely to influence Enrique's decision. ""It has been a difficult year and I'm very thankful to the people who have believed in me. ""I never thought we would win the treble, but one always tries to do their job to the best that they can."" Enrique's record of 50 wins in 60 games is far superior to the 42 in 62 matches Guardiola managed his treble-winning debut campaign. Barca's front three of Lionel Messi, Luis Suarez and Neymar outgunned the previous club record of 100 goals by a forward line that season by Messi, Thierry Henry and Samuel Eto'o with a sensational 122. Meanwhile, Enrique's men were even meaner at the back with 33 clean sheets in all competitions. ""I hate comparisons,"" said Gerard Pique when quizzed on the differences between this Barca and Guardiola's side. ""There are people that would prefer we played like a few years ago but it works."" And Andres Iniesta is hoping Enrique is not quite done following Guardiola's example just yet and stays on to mark an era at Barca. ""Both trebles are special. The first time you think you'll never do it again, and yet we have,"" said the Spaniard, who was named man-of-the-match against Juventus. ""For us he is our coach and we hope that next year he will be there with us. ""He hasn't said anything to the contrary and next year we will have new challenges. ""It has been a spectacular season in every aspect, it is a spectacular day for us."""

This was the fifth time Barcelona have been crowned European champions and it is their fourth Champions League title in the last decade after their 2006, 2009 and 2011 triumphs.

1230,06/06/2015,20:43,Neymar caught up in Brazil tax investigation,"Brazilian superstar Neymar is under investigation by Brazilian tax authorities as the ramifications from his move from Santos to Barcelona two years ago deepen, according to Brazilian news magazine Epoca, citing finance ministry documentation.","The report hit newsstands Saturday as Neymar lined up for Barcelona against Juventus in the Champions League final in Berlin. The magazine indicated the taxman was calling for audit records from N&amp;N Consultoria Esportiva e Empresarial, a firm run by the player's parents. The report said the tax authorities wanted to check the origin of some 115 million reais (some $38 million) in ""atypical movements"" of cash sums to the firm which Barcelona reportedly paid over to the company between 2011 and 2013. Neymar joined Barcelona two years ago but there has been controversy over who received what in a move initially reported as a $17 million deal for the Brazilian club. Last month, Santos said they had filed a complaint with FIFA against Neymar, his father, his company and Barcelona for short-changing them on the transfer. Santos president Modesto Roma Junior says a Spanish investigation into alleged tax fraud in the move revealed that the true fee paid was at least 83.4 million euros ($91.5m) -- far higher than the 57 million euros ($62m) that Barca insist they paid overall. The Brazilian club are demanding damages in their case filed with FIFA's arbitration committee. Spanish investigators have accused Barcelona of concealing the full amount paid for Neymar by splitting it between a number of different contracts with the player and Santos. The transfer has already been the subject of an anti-corruption probe in Spain, where the league champions are accused of defrauding the Spanish tax man of 12.7 million euros. Last month, a judge ordered Barcelona president Josep Maria Bartomeu and former president Sandro Rosell to stand trial for tax fraud. Spanish radio station Cadena Ser reported in April that Neymar would be called as a witness in the case. Citing legal sources, it said he had personally signed nine of the 13 contracts under investigation. Prosecutors have requested a prison sentence of two years and three months for Bartomeu and seven and a half years for his predecessor Rosell.

Messi can become the first player to score in three Champions League finals after Barcelona's 2009 -- when they swept the league, Cup and Champions League treble -- and 2011 triumphs and can equal former Dutch star Clarence Seedorf's record of four victories in European Cup finals. Scorching daytime temperatures of over 30 degrees Celsius are expected in Germany's capital which could affect the pace of the clash between Europe's top two teams. Barcelona start as favourites, but many neutrals here hope Juventus will pull off a shock win to claim the first treble in their history. Both sides have already captured their domestic league and cup titles and Juventus goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon -- who experienced the thrill of winning the 2006 World Cup final in the same stadium -- insists the Italian champions are not here just to make up the numbers. Enrique cautioned his star attack will only thrive if the likes of veteran Spanish midfield duo Andres Iniesta and Xavi Hernandez -- both looking for their fourth Champions League title and the latter in his last game for the club before moving to Qatar -- and Croatian Ivan Rakitic win the midfield battle against Juve's silky-skilled playmaker Andrea Pirlo -- like Buffon a World Cup winner in 2006 -- France's Paul Pogba and Chile's Arturo Vidal. ""We are aware that our forwards capture all the attention. Firstly, because we have the best player in the world in Leo (Messi), but to be here we need to have a full team,"" said Enrique who, after a rocky patch mid-campaign with rumours about his poor relations with Messi, can round off his first season with the treble. ""It is not fair just to talk about Messi, he is the best but the games are played as a team. ""I hope to see the best of my team. We have prepared as a team and we hope to see all the players at their best. ""Everyone is needed. The team has functioned marvellously, that is why we are playing for the treble, but we'll need to be strong in midfield. ""The world of football expects a great final between two teams that will go out to win. It would be nice to see an open and fun game."" Barcelona defender Gerard Pique says it is up to the present team to prove they deserve to be considered one of the greatest sides in the world. ""We have Leo, Luis, Neymar and Andres, we have one of the best teams in the history of the club,"" said the 28-year-old Pique, who like Messi, is seeking to win his third Champions League trophy. ""Now we have to prove we are one of the best teams in the world and we're ready to do that."""

Victory would see Barca become the first club to win the European treble twice. ""For me to be able to play this final is a dream, ever since I was six or seven years old I have been dreaming of this opportunity to win a Champions League final,"" said Neymar. ""Now the time has come and that is why I am going to do what I have to do, so I can enjoy the moments alongside my team mates. ""I have played in lots of finals in my life, but this is the most important one for me. ""I hope I can kiss the trophy at the end of it all and thank god for everything. ""Leo (Messi) and Luis (Suarez) are two players of a very high level. ""We understand each other on and off the pitch, we get on very well. ""I hope to end the season in a happy way taking advantage of the work of all the year with the team and we can be victors."" Neymar has played his part in Barcelona's record-breaking season by scoring 38 of the 120 goals netted alongside his fellow superstars Messi and Suarez. Juventus for their part are also bidding to join the exclusive club of treble winners having already secured the league and cup double."

With the Spanish league and cup already in the bag, Barcelona can write history by seeing off Italian champions Juventus at Berlin's Olympic Stadium to become the first team to complete the treble twice. ""It's going to be a great season whatever happens, if we win this Champions League final, we'll be writing history. It'll be the perfect season, like in 2009,"" said the Spain international. ""To have two titles and to reach the Champions League (final) is something we would have enjoyed anyway, but we have this one last chance to win and we're 90 minutes from perfection."" The 28-year-old Pique was part of Guardiola's squad which won 14 trophies from 2008-2012 and he wants the current star-studded Barcelona to prove they are just as good as the 2009 model. ""The main thing here is we are again in the Champions League final,"" said Pique. ""I hate comparisons. I hate it when we weren't winning last year or two years ago and we were being compared to Pep's team. ""I don't want to be compared now. It's a different team, but there will be people who think we play better (now) or who prefer how we played a few years ago. ""The main thing is that it's working, we need to focus on this game, if we play like we have all season, we have a good chance to win."""
1234,05/06/2015,15:14,Barca shirt is regional and global icon,"You can spot the distinctive claret and blue vertical stripes of the Barcelona football shirt the world over, and while the sales are significant, they hide a more precious meaning in the region of Catalunya.","The ubiquity of the Barca shirt around the globe can be explained by three Champions League wins since 2006 as Lionel Messi, Andres Iniesta and Xavi Hernandez terrorised the European club scene. On Saturday the club take on Juventus, who have an equally iconic black and white striped strip, in the 2015 Champions League final. Barcelona claims to have 182 million fans on social networks while the population of the region of Catalunya, of which Barcelona is the capital, is just 7.5 million. The shirt maker Nike, which also handles Real Madrid and Manchester United, do not reveal sales figures, preventing a hierarchy mentality amongst its blue chip clients. But the club says 199 million euros of its 539 million euros annual turnover comes from marketing and derivative products. But the shirt is also central to the Catalan nationalist independence movement for whom the stripes mirror the Catalan flag, albeit in claret and blue and vertical rather than blood and gold and horizontal, which was banned during the repressive Franco dictatorship (1939-1975) that sought to stamp out regionalism. The shirt ""Is a way of showing you're a Catalan,"" says Carles Santacana, professor of contemporary history at Barcelona University. Which will add to the bluster and brouhaha which will accompany the release of next season's shirt, which for the first time in the club's 115 year history, will switch from vertical to horizontal stripes."

Italian league champions Juventus, dressed in black suits, checked into Berlin's Regent hotel in the city centre. Their 37-year-old veteran goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon waved to the crowd as he targets a first winners medal in his 12th Champions League campaign. Barcelona also touched down in Germany's capital and headed to their hotel before Friday evening's training and press conference, with coach Luis Enrique and stars Neymar and Gerard Pique at, at the Olympic Stadium. Barcelona's star-studded attack of Lionel Messi, Luis Suarez and Neymar have scored 120 goals between them this season and the Spanish giants are bidding to repeat their 2009 feat of winning the treble."
1236,05/06/2015,07:55,Five key questions in the Champions League final,Five key questions in the Champions League final at Berlin's Olympic Stadium on Saturday between Juventus and Barcelona:,"<strong>Can the Juventus defence contain Barcelona's MSN strike-force?</strong> Barcelona's South American strike-force of Argentina superstar Lionel Messi, Brazil's Neymar and Uruguay's Luis Suarez have scored 120 goals between them already this season as Suarez has slotted seamlessly into Barca's attack and Messi has been in the form of his career. But the Juventus back four managed to subdue Real Madrid's star-studded attack and soaked up all that Cristiano Ronaldo, Gareth Bale and Karim Benzema threw at them in the second leg of their semi-final tie. Now, without the injured Giorgio Chiellini, they must repeat that performance. <strong>Can Juventus get a grip on Barcelona in midfield?</strong> Led by the class of veteran Andrea Pirlo, and with Arturo Vidal, Claudio Marchisio and Paul Pogba in there too, there is enough quality in the Juventus midfield for them to take on the Barcelona trio of Sergio Busquets, Ivan Rakitic and Andres Iniesta. Barcelona can also call on the veteran Xavi Hernandez, who will at some point during the game make his final appearance for the Catalans before joining Qatari side Al Sadd next season. <strong>Can the old master Gianluigi Buffon outshine Barcelona 'keeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen?</strong> As the only survivor from Juventus' last Champions League final appearance in 2003, the 37-year-old Buffon is showing no signs of ageing and is determined to win his first European Cup. Buffon, who was outstanding in Juve's 3-2 semi-final win on aggregate over Real Madrid, is relishing a return to the Olympic Stadium where he won the World Cup with Italy in 2006. In the opposite goal, Ter Stegen, who is 14 years Buffon's junior, has got the nod in Europe this season despite coach Luis Enrique selecting the Chilean Claudio Bravo in La Liga. Now, in his first season playing in Europe's elite club competition, he is looking forward to facing one of his childhood heroes. ""Buffon is a legend. He really has played a remarkable season. It was great to see him perform the way he did against Real Madrid,"" said Ter Stegen. ""It's a good opportunity for him, but I hope I can win the final, not him."" <strong>Can Morata and Tevez break their Barcelona duck?</strong> With 14 and 29 goals respectively, Alvaro Morata and Carlos Tevez have forged an impressive partnership up front for Juventus, but both have an extra point to prove against Barcelona. Morata never scored against Barca when he was on the books at Real Madrid, while Tevez was on the losing side for Manchester United against Barcelona in his last Champions League final appearance. Having lifted the trophy with United in Moscow in May 2008 by beating Chelsea on penalties in the final, Tevez played the second half of the 2009 final in Rome when Messi orchestrated Barca's 2-0 victory. While Messi threatens to again steal the limelight in Berlin, Barcelona's Javier Mascherano warns their Argentinian compatriot Tevez is just as deadly in front of goal. ""He is one of the best players I have ever shared a pitch with and he has an incredible winning mentality,"" said Mascherano. ""He is a player that likes to play these type of games and clearly is one of the most important players in the Juventus team."" <strong>Can Juventus break Barcelona's resolve at set-pieces?</strong> Only once this season has Barcelona's defence been breached from a set-piece, when Bayern Munich defender Medhi Benatia headed past Ter Stegen from a corner early in the Champions League semi-final second leg. But with their height and strength, Juventus will test the Catalans' defence in the air from dead-ball situations. Morata's crucial equaliser following a Pirlo free-kick in the semi-final second leg against Madrid ultimately booked Juve's ticket to Berlin. Barcelona's centre-backs Mascherano and Gerard Pique will therefore need to be at the top of their game in the final, especially whenever Pirlo gets the chance to send in a free-kick."

Juve coach Massimiliano Allegri and his Barcelona counterpart Luis Enrique have already enjoyed excellent debut seasons in charge of their respective clubs, both winning domestic league and cup doubles, and both are now within touching distance of making it a glorious treble. For Barcelona, it would be a second such treble following their fantastic first season under Pep Guardiola in 2008-09, but such an achievement is very rare indeed. Only six other clubs have ever won a domestic league and cup double and the European Cup in the same season, with Celtic's Lisbon Lions of 1967 the first. Since then, Ajax (1972), PSV Eindhoven (1988), Manchester United (1999), Inter Milan (2010) and Bayern Munich (2013) have repeated the feat. Barcelona can therefore become the first club to do it twice, and their current team contains several members of that 2009 vintage under Guardiola. ""We are still a young team. There are still quite a few players from the Guardiola era,"" said Luis Enrique. ""This could turn out to be an historic season for us."" Juventus, meanwhile, will either join that elite group of clubs or become the first club to have lost six European Cup finals. The Italian champions' main task is to blunt Barcelona's razor-sharp attack of Messi, Neymar and Luis Suarez which has sliced through defences on the road to Berlin. The South American trio have scored a stunning 120 goals between them this season, compared to the 103 managed by the entire Juventus team. With 58 goals in all competitions, four-time world player of the year Messi is in the best form of his illustrious career, but Juventus can ill-afford to focus on containing his talents alone. Messi destroyed Guardiola's Bayern Munich with two goals in the first leg of their semi-final before setting up Neymar for the third at the Camp Nou. But in the return it was Suarez and Neymar who did the damage, combining for two first-half goals at the Allianz Arena which put the tie beyond Bayern. To make Juve's task even harder, centre-back Giorgio Chiellini was ruled out of the final after tearing a calf muscle in training. But Juventus have neither flown to Berlin just to witness Messi's magic first hand nor do they wish to see him become the first player to score in three Champions League finals. ""This is the game of our lives,"" said Juve goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon, their sole survivor from their last Champions League final, the defeat to AC Milan in 2003. ""I would always want to be starting off as a favourite, but we have our weapons to try and make Barcelona's job more difficult,"" added Buffon, who along with Pirlo won the World Cup at the same stadium with Italy in 2006. With four consecutive Serie A titles behind them, Allegri's side carry a wealth of experience. ""They have that Italian competitive edge. It is always difficult to overcome that because they are very, very competitive,"" said Barcelona's Javier Mascherano. ""They are very tactical.

His previous deal had a year to run and the man who has slipped down the Barcelona pecking order since the arrivals of Neymar and Luis Suarez was thought to be considering his options. The 27-year-old won the 2010 World Cup and Euro 2012 with Spain, for whom he has 50 caps, but started just 22 games for Barcelona this season, scoring eleven goals. Pedro came through the Barcelona youth system and was brought into the first team by Pep Guardiola with his breakthrough year being 2010."
1240,04/06/2015,15:00,Relief as Iniesta joins Barca training,Andres Iniesta looks set to win his fitness battle for Barcelona's Champions League final against Juventus after taking part in a full training session on Thursday.,"Having injured his right calf at the weekend, Barca's midfield pass master risked being the club's only major absentee for the Berlin final on Saturday. ""The whole team took part in training Thursday including Andres Iniesta, who had been training alone these last two days,"" Barcelona said on their website. Iniesta was replaced by Xavi Hernandez early in the second-half as Barca won the Spanish Cup with a 3-1 victory over Athletic Bilbao last weekend. Barcelona and Juventus are hoping to complete trebles on Saturday as both clubs have won their domestic league and cup competitions. Iniesta, who could win his 24th senior trophy for the Catalans on Saturday, plays a crucial role in Barcelona's 4-3-3 formation alongside Ivan Rakitic and Sergio Busquets."
1241,04/06/2015,02:15,Slimline Messi back on top of the world,"By Lionel Messi's exceptional standards 2014 was a year to forget. For the first time in six years he went trophyless at club level with Barcelona, whilst arguably his best ever chance to win a World Cup with Argentina came and went.","His listless performances particularly in the latter stages of the World Cup, despite being controversially named player of the tournament, led many to believe he could never return to the level that dazzled as he became the first man to win four consecutive World Player of the Year awards between 2008 and 2012. Fast-forward a year and Messi's displays in the past six months may even have eclipsed anything that came before. After a brief stand off with coach Luis Enrique when Messi was left out of the opening game of the year after returning later than his teammates from their winter break, Messi has dragged Barcelona from the verge of institutional crisis to within one game of a treble when they face Juventus in the Champions League final on Saturday. ""Last year I had an inconsistent season. I was out for a long time due to injuries and I missed a lot of matches. When I returned to the field I never felt right,"" Messi admitted recently. ""It was a year I tried to forget quickly and recover my best form thanks to the joy, hard work and effort that I have always had and thankfully now I feel very good."" Messi's change in physical state has come about thanks to a radical change in diet. The 27-year-old has lost a reported 3.5 kilograms (7.7 pounds) since starting to work with Italian dietician Giuliano Poser at the start of the season. A noticeably more slimline Messi has not only got to the end of the season in prime physical condition despite playing all but 70 minutes of Barca's full La Liga and Champions League campaigns, he has recovered the pace in short bursts that makes him practically impossible to stop. In last weekend's Copa del Rey final against Athletic Bilbao he scored one of the most memorable of his 412 Barcelona goals by showing a combination of strength, speed and incredible skill to burst past four Athletic defenders before firing in at the near post. Even the coach that arguably knows Messi best of all was powerless to stop him. On the eve of Pep Guardiola's return to the Camp Nou as Bayern Munich boss, he declared that Messi's current form meant that ""there is not a system or coach to stop talent of his magnitude."" A day later and Guardiola learned how it felt to be on the other side od Messi's genius as a two-goal salvo in three minutes took the tie away from Bayern. ""He is back, he is there where I had the privilege to train him,"" Guardiola said after the tie. ""He is definitely back at his best."" Juventus have defied the odds to get back to the top of the European game, but the task of not just stopping Messi but also Neymar and Luis Suarez may prove one too far. The star South American triumvirate have combined for 120 goals this season, whilst the whole Juventus squad has managed 103. Moreover, after a dry spell, Barca are in no mood to let the chance of becoming the first team to ever win the treble slip away. ""We came from a time when we won everything, every year we would win a title and maybe the fans like us didn't give it the value it deserved,"" Messi added. ""We went through a year where we didn't win anything and now when the success arrives we give it the importance it deserves and enjoy it more because we know how hard it is to achieve."" Messi may have dropped his weight, but his hunger for titles remains undiminished."
1242,03/06/2015,12:58,Ballack tips Juve to beat 'vulnerable' Barca,Former Bayern Munich and Chelsea midfielder Michael Ballack has tipped Juventus to pull off an upset by beating favourites Barcelona in Saturday's Champions League final in Berlin.,"Both teams are seeking to complete a treble of league, cup and Champions League crowns, but although Barcelona have hit dazzling form since the turn of the year, Ballack believes Juventus could yet outwit them. ""I go for Juventus,"" he told AFP during an interview in London. ""Everyone thinks it's Barcelona. Maybe it's a little bit dangerous for them because everyone expects it, so it's not easy. ""Juventus have a big tradition and a lot of experienced players, quality as well, otherwise you wouldn't kick out Real Madrid in two legs (in the semi-finals). So why not?"" Ballack, a beaten Champions League finalist with both Chelsea and Bayer Leverkusen, believes that Barcelona's front three of Lionel Messi, Luis Suarez and Neymar is one of the finest forward lines of all time. Messi's brace, which included an astonishing solo effort, and a goal by Neymar in Barcelona's 3-1 win over Athletic Bilbao in the Copa del Rey final last weekend took the trio's tally for the season to 120 goals. But Ballack thinks that Juventus will draw encouragement from Bayern's 3-2 victory in the second leg of their semi-final against Barcelona, who went through 5-3 on aggregate. ""If you see them playing the way they enjoy football again, especially Messi up front, in the semi-final he was outstanding,"" said the former Germany captain, who is an ambassador for Champions League sponsors MasterCard. ""He's always unbelievable quality, but you have to mention that even he sometimes has little ups and downs, even if it's on an unbelievable level. ""Next to him with Suarez, a great signing, and Neymar on the other side, I can't remember the last time three players with those names played together for one team. ""It's an outstanding team, but also vulnerable. We've seen that against Bayern. They conceded three goals, so there's also a chance for other teams."" Ballack, 38, identified French midfielder Paul Pogba, who has been linked with both Barcelona and Real Madrid, as a key figure for Juventus. ""He's a really, really interesting player with a lot of talent, capable to run a lot, to cover a lot of distance during the match, next to (Arturo) Vidal, who's as important as him,"" said Ballack. ""He's one of the most important players for that Juventus team because they're really a defence-orientated team and you need players able to run from a deep position to the opponents' box. ""They have a great player in their team."""
1243,03/06/2015,02:30,Mascherano wary of old friend Tevez,Barcelona defender Javier Mascherano will line up against a friend turned rival in the Champions League final on Saturday as compatriot Carlos Tevez attempts to fire Juventus to their first European Cup in 19 years.,"Mascherano and Tevez moved to Europe together to join English side West Ham United from Corinthians in 2006. After an inauspicious start at Upton Park, both went onto enjoy successful careers in England as Mascherano joined Liverpool before moving to Barcelona in 2010, whilst Tevez won Premier League titles with Manchester United and Manchester City. However, it is at Juventus where Tevez has shown his best form in European football. The 31-year-old has scored 29 goals this season to guide Juventus to the brink of their first ever treble of Serie A, Italian Cup and Champions League. ""Carlos's career is there for everyone to see. It is formidable,"" said Mascherano. ""He is one of the best players I have ever shared a pitch with and has an incredible winning mentality. ""He has left a mark at all the teams he has played with. Obviously, if you are faced with playing him you have to be very careful. ""He is a player that likes to play these type of games and clearly is one of the most important players in the Juventus team."" At the other end of the field the clash between the Spanish and Italian champions brings Luis Suarez face-to-face with old foes Patrice Evra and Giorgio Chiellini. Suarez was banned for eight matches after being found guilty of racially abusing Evra in 2011 during their time at Liverpool and Manchester United respectively. The fiery Uruguayan then received a four-month ban for biting Chiellini at last summer's World Cup. However, Mascherano believes Suarez has shown this season he has the right temperament to concentrate solely on winning the Champions League for the first time. ""For Luis that is already in the past,"" added Mascherano. ""It is a special game for him because it is his first Champions League final and these games are special, but not because of the players he will face. ""Luis is of an age now and has shown that we don't need to say anything. He is responsible for his actions."" Mascherano has already tasted victory in a Champions League final during his first season at Barca, but also lost one whilst at Liverpool in 2007. However, he insisted that even winning the treble would not wipe away the pain of losing the World Cup final to Germany in extra time last July despite his heroics throughout the tournament. ""The worst feeling is to lose a World Cup final. ""Apart from that the feeling of winning any title is very gratifying because it is the reward of all the work done during the year. ""The Champions League has that feeling but also an added prestige. As a footballer that prestige is also something that we play for."""

The pre-match hype may be focused on how Juventus, appearing in their first final since losing to AC Milan in 2003, will put the brakes on the seemingly unstoppable Lionel Messi. But Barca midfielder Andres Iniesta believes fans around the world could be in for a treat as Pirlo and Xavi bid to steer their respective teams to European glory. ""It will be nice that these two references in world football come face to face with each other,"" said Iniesta. ""For people that watch football, to watch Pirlo is synonymous with good football. Given his career, his way of playing, the importance of his role in the play, Pirlo is a reference for any player."" Iniesta -- and likely the large majority of Barcelona fans -- believe ""Xavi is the number one"" player in the world in his position. As far as midfielders go, they certainly don't get any better than Pirlo or Xavi. Boasting a quiet composure that allows them to confidently dictate play, their vision, ball control and ability to find teammates with pinpoint passes that help create goals and win games, titles and trophies is legendary. Xavi is Barcelona through and through, joining the Catalan club's prestigious La Masia youth set-up as an 11 year old and going on to win eight La Liga titles, three Champions League trophies and becoming an integral part of the Spain team that won the 2010 World Cup and the past two European Championships. Pirlo's curriculum vitae may be only slightly less plentiful, but the 36-year-old's feats have come in spite of a comparatively bumpier ride through Italy's Serie A. It was at Serie B side Brescia that Pirlo's talents came to the attention of coach Carlo Mazzone, who promptly threw Pirlo into the deep-lying midfield role in front of the defence. Following three, largely fruitless spells at city rivals Inter, it was a position he honed under Carlo Ancelotti after moving to AC Milan, where Pirlo's legendary free kick skills flourished. With the Rossoneri, Pirlo won league titles in 2004 and 2011 as well as two Champions League titles in 2003 and 2007, having also been part of the Milan team stunned by Liverpool in the 2005 final in Istanbul after the Italians had raced to a 3-0 half-time lead. Pirlo's last season at Milan, under his present coach at Juventus, Allegri, saw the midfielder start only 17 games, however. To Milan's eventual dismay, he left the club by mutual consent and, amazingly, for free. ""When Andrea told me that he was joining us, the first thing I thought was: ""God exists"","" said Juventus goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon. ""A player of his level and ability, not to mention that he was free, I think it was the signing of the century!"" It is perhaps no coincidence the Turin giants have been virtually unstoppable on the domestic front since Pirlo's arrival in the summer of 2011. He has since helped the Bianconeri to four successive league titles, three of which came under former coach Antonio Conte and the last under Allegri, who let him walk out of the San Siro four years ago. Playing alongside Chilean international Arturo Vidal and up and Claudio Marchisio, Pirlo hit the net three times in his first season with Juve but it was other statistics that showed his true worth. He made a league-leading 13 assists, and completed 2643 passes -- an 87% completion rate. The only player in the world to have completed more passes than Pirlo in 2011-2012 was Xavi. ""He's a champion,"" Pirlo said of the Spaniard on Monday. ""I've had the chance to play against him several times. Off the pitch he's a great man and as great champion on it."""
1245,03/06/2015,02:00,Seven teams to have won the European treble,"A look at the seven teams to have completed the European treble of domestic cup, league and Champions League titles in a season.","Both Juventus and Barcelona, who meet in Saturday's Champions League final at Berlin's Olympic Stadium, can claim the treble of trophies having already won the domestic league and cup. CELTIC (Scotland) 1966/67 Billy McNeill's 'Lisbon Lions' scored 196 goals over the course of a ground-breaking season as they became the first European team to win the treble with only three non-Scottish players in the first team squad. Having won the Scottish league by three points from Rangers, they beat Aberdeen 2-0 in the Scottish Cup final before travelling to Lisbon whey they won 2-1 against Inter Milan with goals from Tommy Gemmell and Stevie Chalmers. Jock Stein's side actually finished with five titles in a fairytale season as they also lifted the Scottish League Cup and Glasgow Cup, all with a team born within 40km of the city, according to legend. AJAX (Netherlands) 1971/72 Johan Cruyff was the architect of Ajax's all-conquering season as the Dutch giants defended the European Cup with their own brand of total football. Cruyff scored both goals in their 2-0 win over Inter Milan in the European Cup final at Dutch rivals Rotterdam and they won the Eredivisie from Feyenoord by eight points. Cruyff finished as the league's top-scorer with 25 goals out of Ajax's haul of 104 Eredivisie goals. A fortnight before the European Cup final, they beat FC Den Haag in the Dutch Cup final, which like the continental decider was at Rotterdam's Feijenoord Stadion. EINDHOVEN (Netherlands) 1987/88 Guus Hiddink's side had an even more spectacular domestic season than Ajax in 1971/72, scoring 117 goals in topping the Dutch league for a third consecutive time and beat Roda JC 3-2 in the Dutch Cup final. The European Cup final against Benfica in Stuttgart finished goalless, but the Dutch held their nerve to win the shoot-out 6-5 and converted all of their penalties before Antonio Veloso was denied by Hans van Breukelen. The season was all the more impressive as Eindhoven had sold Ruud Gullit to AC Milan at the start of the season. MANCHESTER UNITED (England) 1998/99 Alex Ferguson's side wrote themselves into Champions League history by winning the final in one of the most dramatic finishes. With Bayern Munich winning 1-0 in Barcelona, Ferguson threw on England striker Teddy Sheringham and Norway's Ole Gunnar Solksjaer who turned the game in added time. Sheringham equalised in the 91st minute while Solksjaer tapped the winner past Germany goalkeeper and Bayern captain Oliver Kahn in the 93rd minute to win United's first European Cup final since 1968. They squeezed through the group stage as a best runner-up and made a stunning comeback in the second leg of their semi at Juventus, coming back from 2-0 down to claim a 3-2 victory with goals by Roy Keane, Dwight Yorke and Andy Cole. They won the Premier League title by just a point from Arsenal and beat Newcastle United 2-0 in the FA Cup final, but had Keane and England midfielder Paul Scholes suspended for the epic European final at Barcelona's Camp Nou. BARCELONA (Spain) 2008/09 At 38, Pep Guardiola became the youngest coach to win the Champions League title when Lionel Messi-inspired Barcelona beat Manchester United 2-0 in the final in Rome to become the first Spanish team to win the treble. Barca travelled to Rome having already wrapped up the Spanish league by beating Real Madrid 6-2 at the Bernabeu in a key victory at the start of May before winning the Copa del Rey with a 4-1 win over Athletic Bilbao. INTER MILAN (Italy) 2009/10 Samuel Eto'o was part of another treble-winning team having switched from Barcelona to Milan in the summer of 2009 as Jose Mourinho's side swept all-comers in Italy. The Nerazzurri won the Coppa Italia 1-0 against AS Roma at Stadio Olimpico with a Diego Milito goal and less than two weeks later he was on target again in a 1-0 victory at AC Siena that saw Inter beat Roma to the Italian league title on the final day. Mourinho's side face Bayern Munich in the Madrid final with Milito scoring both goals as Louis van Gaal's Bavarians were well beaten in the first of their three final appearances in four seasons. BAYERN MUNICH (Germany) 2012/13 Jupp Heynckes delivered Germany's first treble in his final year as Bayern coach as the Bavarians dominated the Bundesliga in a record-breaking season. They won the league title by collecting 91 points to finish 25 ahead of second-placed Dortmund, who they beat 2-1 in the Champions League final at Wembley in an all-Bundesliga affair with Arjen Robben scoring the winning goal. With the European and league titles in the bag, Bayern then headed to Berlin to beat Stuttgart 3-2 in the German Cup final a week after their Wembley triumph to complete the treble as Heynckes bowed out in style before Guardiola took over for the 2013/14 season."
1246,02/06/2015,14:09,Iniesta expects to be fit for final,Barcelona midfielder Andres Iniesta has played down concerns he could miss Saturday's Champions League final with a calf problem picked up in last weekend's Copa del Rey final win over Athletic Bilbao.,"Iniesta was replaced by Xavi Hernandez early in the second-half as Barca sealed a league and Cup double with a 3-1 victory over the Basques. ""I had a few pains and nothing more,"" Iniesta said on Tuesday. ""It hasn't passed through my head that I won't be there on Saturday. It will all be fine and I want to be able to be there and help the team win the Champions League to end this special season."""
1247,02/06/2015,11:39,Barca's Alba agrees contract extension to 2020,Barcelona left-back Jordi Alba has agreed to a contract extension that will keep him tied to the Catalan giants until 2020.,"""FC Barcelona announces it has reached an agreement with Jordi Alba for the renovation of his contract until 2020,"" the club said in a statement on Tuesday. ""His new buyout clause will be 150 million euros. ""The contract will be signed in the coming days."" Alba has become an integral part of the Barca side since joining the club from Valencia in 2012. The 26-year-old has scored twice in 43 appearances this season in Barca's successful run to a league and Cup double and is expected to start in Saturday's Champions League final against Juventus in Berlin."
1248,02/06/2015,02:16,World Cup heartbreak drives Barca's glory run,When Barcelona's players returned for their first pre-season session under new boss Luis Enrique no one held the bragging rights of coming back from Brazil a newly crowned world champion.,"Nine months on and the Catalans star-studded squad is on the brink of the compensation of becoming the first side to win the treble of league, Cup and Champions League twice. All 11 of the side that will start against Juventus in Saturday's Champions League final suffered their share of World Cup disappointment. The biggest humiliation was suffered by Barca's six Spanish internationals, five of whom had won the World Cup four years previously in South Africa. Jordi Alba, Gerard Pique, Sergio Busquets, Xavi, Andres Iniesta and Pedro were sent packing after just two games in Brazil after heavy defeats by the Netherlands and Chile. Yet, that pain has been Barca's gain as significantly Pique, Busquets and Iniesta's return to form in 2015 has played a huge role in Enrique's men's run of 28 wins from 34 games since a shock 1-0 defeat to Real Sociedad in January. All five had also been part of the Spanish squads at Euro 2012 and the Confederations Cup a year later and the rest enforced by early elimination combined with Enrique's persistent rotation policy early in the season has paid dividends as Barca have arrived at the end of the campaign in prime physical shape. However, the key to Barca's brilliant campaign has been the remarkable 120 goals struck by the lethal front three of Lionel Messi, Neymar and Luis Suarez. All three had to deal with heartbreak or, in Suarez's case, shame in Brazil that left them hungry for vindication in the form of trophies. Barca weren't perturbed by the four-month ban slapped on Suarez for biting an opponent for the third time in his career as they splashed out a club record transfer fee to secure his services from Liverpool. The Uruguayan has rewarded that faith with 24 goals and 24 assists despite a slow start to his first season at the Camp Nou after missing the opening two months of the campaign because of his ban. More importantly, though, Suarez's aggression and work-rate has combined perfectly with the playmaking ability and pace of Messi and Neymar respectively. Neymar dealt with the immense pressure of bearing the burden of Brazil's dreams for a sixth World Cup on home soil brilliantly last summer until a terrifying collision with Colombia's Juan Camilo Zuniga ended his tournament at the quarter-final stage with two broken vertebrae in his back. That blow may have been a blessing for the 23-year-old as it meant he was not one of the culprits in Brazil's historic 7-1 thrashing by Germany in the semi-final. Neymar recovered remarkably quickly to start the season in top form as he has surpassed Barca legends like Ronaldinho, Samuel Eto'o, Thierry Henry and Rivaldo best ever goalscoring numbers in a single campaign with 38 goals. Yet, even Neymar's feats have been cast into the shadows by Messi's return to his best form. ""The truth is I started the season in a different way after what happened last year,"" the four-time World Player of the Year said recently. ""I went through a difficult year for what happened off the field, the injuries and my performance."" The frustration for Argentines watching their compatriot rip apart rivals week in, week out in recent months was that the World Cup came a year too early. Messi scored twice, including a scarcely believable individual run past four Athletic Bilbao players to open the scoring in last weekend's Copa del Rey final to take his record to 20 goals in 23 finals for Barcelona. The one final goal that got away was a typical Messi left-footed effort that slipped inches past Manuel Neuer's far post as Argentina were pipped 1-0 by Germany in the World Cup final. Given the same chance again, current form suggests Messi is unlikely to misfire in Berlin as he looks to become the first man to score in three Champions League finals."
1249,01/06/2015,18:07,Previous final experience key for Barca - Messi,Four-time World Player of the Year Lionel Messi believes his side's recent experience of winning Champions League finals will help in their bid to seal a treble of trophies this season against Juventus on Saturday.,"Messi has been in unstoppable form to propel Luis Enrique's men to a league and Cup double already this season with 58 goals so far this campaign. However, despite Barca being heavy favourites he warned against writing off a Juventus side that eliminated the Catalans' fierce rivals Real Madrid in the semi-finals. ""The anthem lets you know that it is a different game, a special game for the competition it is,"" Messi told UEFA's media services. ""It is a Champions League final and we have suffered a lot to get here. We know that it won't be easy to be champions again. We are playing against a very difficult and powerful opponent. ""It is a final where anything can happen, but we will prepare in the same way we did for the previous finals."" Messi is aiming to become the first player to score in three Champions League finals having done so in both of Barca's most recent triumphs against Manchester United in 2009 and 2011. The Argentine's two goals, including a stunning individual opener, against Athletic Bilbao in the Copa del Rey final on Saturday took his overall tally in finals for Barcelona to 20 in 23 games. And he is hoping to improve that remarkable record with another moment of history in Berlin. ""They are very significant parts of my career. The first one because we practically finished the game and were lifting the cup at 2-0. ""The second one because it made it 2-1 at a point where the game was well-balanced and that is why I celebrated so wildly. ""They were two very significant goals for me."""
1250,31/05/2015,15:11,Barca follow familiar route towards treble,Another majestic performance from Lionel Messi put Barcelona on the brink of becoming the first team ever to win the treble twice as they put Athletic Bilbao to the sword 3-1 in the Copa del Rey final.,"Like so much of this season for Barca, Saturday's final was a flashback to the 2008/09 campaign when the Catalans claimed league, Cup and Champions League in the same season for the first time. Athletic were also their victims in the Cup final back then, whilst English, French and German opposition were swept aside on their route to the Champions League final. Six years ago Pep Guardiola's men travelled to the Italian capital to complete the job against Manchester United, next weekend it is the Italian champions that lie in wait in Berlin as Juventus try to stop a side with frightening momentum. Recreating the glorious 14-trophy haul during Guardiola's four years in charge was what the club had in mind when they hired Luis Enrique 12 months ago after a first trophyless season in six years. As well as being a former teammate of Guardiola, Enrique succeeded his friend as Barca B coach to start his managerial career and was well aware of the demands at the club having captained Barca in a eight-year playing career between 1996 and 2004. However, just as with Guardiola's sides, the catalyst on the pitch has been Messi with the addition of two world class strikers in Neymar and Luis Suarez allowing him the extra freedom needed to be even more deadly. The Argentine struck twice, including a sensational individual effort to open the scoring, against Athletic either side of Neymar's tap in to take the star South American trio's tally for the season to a whopping 120 goals. Tellingly, the two times Barca won the Champions League under Guardiola, Messi was well-supported when it came to goalscoring. Messi, Samuel Eto'o and Thierry Henry netted a hitherto record 100 goals in the treble winning campaign, whilst Pedro and David Villa added 45 to Messi's 53 in 2010/11. However, with Xavi and Andres Iniesta less of an influence than they were in those sides, the pace and aggression of Neymar and Suarez has also offered a more direct route that makes this Barca team arguably even tougher to stop. ""At the end of the day what makes teams great is titles. You can play incredibly well and have millions of resources but if in the trophy cabinet you don't have cups then it doesn't mean anything,"" said defender Gerard Pique, who was also a part of the treble-winning squad. ""If at the end you are able to win, not the quantity of trophies we won with Pep, but an important number, then we can compare the two teams. ""Now I think we have more options. We know how to play on the counter-attack, which with Pep we didn't exploit so much. Perhaps we don't have the control of the game we did then, but that doesn't guarantee you win more because this year we have won more than ever. ""They are similar teams with subtle differences. The change of coach and because the players have more experience. It is a more mature team and knows how to come through difficult situations. Experience allows you to overcome bad moments in a game."" Adversity has been an important part of the season. Having left Messi and Neymar on the bench for a 1-0 defeat at Real Sociedad to begin 2015, Enrique looked on the verge of the sack with the club descending into institutional crisis as sporting director Andoni Zubizarreta was dismissed and club presidential elections called for the end of the season in the same week. Since then they have suffered one material defeat in 34 matches to seal a sixth league and Cup double and to within one game of matching the best season in the club's storied 115-year history."
1251,31/05/2015,02:02,Flashy Neymar won't change despite final controversy,Brazilian star Neymar has insisted he won't be bullied into curbing his repertoire of skills after a host of Athletic Bilbao players reacted angrily to his show-boating towards the end of Barcelona's 3-1 Copa del Rey final win on Saturday.,"Neymar flicked the ball over Unai Bustinza with both feet with two minutes to go and Barca well on their way to sealing a 27th Copa del Rey to go with the La Liga title they won two weeks ago. Bilbao's outraged players immediately surrounded the 22-year-old with Barca's veteran captain Xavi Hernandez having to lead his teammate away from the fracas. ""They can be angry, but it is my way of playing and I have done so for years. Just because others get angry doesn't mean I am going to change my style of play,"" said Neymar. However, Barca boss Luis Enrique had strong words for his star, who had scored his side's second goal of the evening either side of Lionel Messi's stunning opener and a second from the Argentine. ""In Spain this is looked on very badly. If I was an Athletic player I would have reacted the same, or even worse,"" said Enrique. ""In Brazil this is normal, so we have to understand the context. He didn't do it to humiliate his opponent, it is difficult to explain it when someone is losing but we will try to control it with time."" Athletic coach Ernesto Valverde also claimed Neymar, who is coming towards the end of his second season with the Catalan giants, needs to learn that such gestures will not be tolerated in Spain. ""It is not even looked upon well by his own fans,"" he said. ""When the game is won we are very well aware to maintain certain respect for the opponent. There are things that he will learn with time."" The incident took the shine off another brilliant display for Barca, and in particular Messi, that leaves them just one game away from sealing a treble. Enrique's men face Juventus in the Champions League final next Saturday and will be strong favourites with the four-time World Player of the Year in such form. Messi beat four Athletic players before firing in at the near post to open the scoring before taking his tally for the campaign to 58 in the second-half. ""It is difficult to get used to seeing things like that, but he does things in training that are even more incredible,"" added Enrique. ""When he is surrounded by teammates of such great quality and with a common goal it is a joy to watch."" And Athletic captain Andoni Iraola believes Neymar could also learn from the attitude shown by Messi. ""For me it didn't seem elegant or sporting at all,"" said the 32-year-old, who was playing his final game for the Basques after more than 500 appearances. ""He has examples in his own team that he should pay attention to because he has much to learn from them."""
1252,30/05/2015,23:39,Messi-inspired Barcelona win 27th Copa del Rey,A Lionel Messi-inspired Barcelona sealed a league and Cup double as they swept aside Athletic Bilbao 3-1 to win the Copa del Rey for a 27th time on Saturday.,"Messi opened the scoring in spectacular fashion by dribbling past four Athletic players and lashing home a low finish before Neymar added a second before half-time. The Argentine grabbed his second of the game to kill the tie as a contest 17 minutes from time before Inaki Williams grabbed a consolation for the Basques. Despite Athletic fans dominating two-thirds of the 99,000 capacity Camp Nou, there was nothing their players could do to stop a rampant Barca that is now just one game away from just the second treble in the club's history. Luis Enrique's men face Italian champions Juventus in the Champions League final in Berlin on June 6. The game began in controversy after the Spanish national anthem was drowned by the fans of two clubs with strong separatist identities. On the field there was little to argue about as Messi tore Bilbao apart to continue their 31-year drought without winning a major trophy. The four-time World Player of the Yeat teed up Neymar for what should have been the opening goal just nine minutes in, but the Brazilian's effort was wrongly disallowed for offside. Luis Suarez then forced Iago Herrerin into the first of many fine saves with a low drive. Herrerin was left as helpless as the rest of his teammates 11 minutes later when Messi danced past Mikel Balenziaga, Mikel Rico and Benat Etxebarria tight on the touchline before turning inside Aymeric Laporte and smashing in at the near post. Even by the Argentine's incredibly high standards the move and finish was as good as any of his previous 410 Barca goals. Messi wasn't finished as he then turned provider for Suarez whose low cross was met by Neymar and brilliantly blocked by Herrerin. The Athletic stopper continued to frustrate Barca as he then stretched to turn Gerard Pique's effort from Messi's free-kick over. Barcelona did finally double their advantage nine minutes before half-time with Messi again heavily involved as he fed Ivan Rakitic who released Suarez and this time the Uruguayan's pass was rolled into an unguarded net by Neymar for his seventh goal of the competition. Athletic starlet Inaki Williams came closest to a reply before the break with a dipping volley that clipped the top of the crossbar. However, Herrerin had to be alive moments later to turn a free-kick from Messi behind. Perhaps with one eye on next weekend's Champions League final, Barca eased up slightly in the second period. Xavi Hernandez was brought on to savour his final appearance at the Camp Nou after a 17-year career. Messi added his 58th goal of the season as he pounced on some lackadaisical Athletic defending to prod home Dani Alves's cross. The Bilbao faithful did at least get something to cheer 11 minutes from time as the 20-year-old Williams notched just his third senior goal from Ibai Gomez's cross."
1253,29/05/2015,20:49,"Santos file FIFA complaint against Neymar, Barca","Brazilian club Santos said Friday they have filed a complaint at FIFA against Neymar, his father, his company and Barcelona for contract violations in the star striker's May 2013 transfer to the Spanish side.","""Santos believe that Barcelona, Neymar and his company violated the transfer contract and demand payment for damages, plus interest,"" Santos president Modesto Roma Junior told a press conference."
1254,29/05/2015,14:59,Barca front three 'incomparable' - Iniesta,"Barcelona midfielder Andres Iniesta has hailed the club's attacking trident of Lionel Messi, Luis Suarez and Neymar as the best strike force he has ever played with.","Iniesta has won 22 trophies in a stellar career at Barca playing alongside the likes of Ronaldinho, Thierry Henry and Samuel Eto'o, but he believes the South American trio's return of 117 goals this season puts them on another level. ""I have had the chance to play with the best strikers in the world at this club. At the moment to have these three players is something incomparable,"" he said. ""For me all three are the number one, all three are still young and have spectacular potential."" Iniesta has the chance to add a 23rd title and a third Copa del Rey to his honours list when Barca face Athletic Bilbao in the Copa del Rey final on Saturday at the Camp Nou. Victory would seal the second leg of a potential treble for Luis Enrique's men with the Champions League final against Juventus to come on June 6. The Spanish international was part of the only previous Barca side to win the treble in the 2008/09 season and sees similarities between the two sides. ""No two seasons are the same. I see similarities with the treble season because we are back to playing for everything,"" he added. ""The feelings among the group are very good because we wouldn't be in this situation if they weren't. ""We know we are close to something very important that almost never happens. They are two games and we want to take another step to win the two titles that are left."" Barca were further boosted as Enrique confirmed Suarez will be fit to start despite missing the final two league games of the season due to a hamstring problem. And the Barca boss insisted that his side won't let their minds wander ahead to next weekend's meeting with the Italian champions in Berlin. ""I am preparing for one final, tomorrow's one,"" he said on Friday. ""There isn't another final for me right now. I know Juventus and what we have to transmit to the players we can starting from next week."" ""We are desperate to win the Cup. I wouldn't put one title above another because it is an opportunity that doesn't come around often."""
1255,24/05/2015,12:04,Allegri warns over 'deadly' Barca,"Juventus coach Massimiliano Allegri has warned against the ""deadly"" ball-passing of Barcelona as the Italian champions turn their focus to the Champions League final following their final home game of the season on Saturday.","The Turin giants welcomed Napoli to Juventus Stadium and after overwhelming Rafael Benitez's visitors 3-1, offered fans a tickertape celebration three days after securing their first double since 1995 with a 2-1 Cup final victory over Lazio. Juventus now turn their attention to preparing as best they can for the formidable challenge of beating Barcelona in the final of Europe's premier club competition in Berlin on June 6. The Spanish giants start as automatic favourites, and although Allegri has been cautious over Juve's chances the 48-year-old said the Italians are mentally prepared for the challenge. ""We've won the league and Cup so we'll be going to the (Champions League) final in the right frame of mind, although you only win games out on the pitch, never before,"" said Allegri. Allegri also led AC Milan to their last league title, in 2011, in his first season in charge of the club but saw the Rossoneri exit the Champions League in the last 16 at the hands of Barcelona, 4-2 on aggregate, in 2013. Facing Luis Enrique's men in the final in two weeks' time will be a challenge made more difficult by the the ""unpredictable"" Lionel Messi and the team's ""deadly"" ball-passing. ""When Messi takes the ball he's always unpredicatable,"" added Allegri. ""Playing Barcelona is always difficult, we have to be really good because their ball-passing is deadly. ""Defensively, we need to play flawlessly."" Juventus's league triumph several weeks ago, however, has allowed the champions the perfect run-in to Berlin. Napoli travelled to Turin looking for a win that would maintain their hopes of a top three finish and a possible place in next season's Champions League. But the carrot of beating what was effectively a second-string Juventus side failed to tempt Napoli, who following a bright start quickly looked out of their depth. In the end, the visitors finished with ten men after Miguel Britos saw red for headbutting striker Alvaro Morata, who partnered Kingsley Coman up front as Fernando Llorente and Carlos Tevez were both rested alongside Andrea Pirlo, Arturo Vidal and three of Juve's habitual four-man defence. As Benitez and his team continued to boycott media, Allegri said his players' performance had given him reassurances ahead of meeting Barcelona. ""The lads are in good condition and played well, especially after the interval. They could have been a bit less fanciful, but I'm not going to blame them for that,"" said Allegri. Juventus opened the scoring through Roberto Pereyra on 13 minutes and despite David Lopez levelling for the visitors when he smashed home the rebound after Gianluigi Buffon saved a penalty from Lorenzo Insigne, Juventus were unstoppable. Stefano Sturaro scored a great individual goal to restore Juve's lead on 77 minutes and at the death Napoli self-imploded. Britos saw red for a clear headbutt on Morata in the area, and second-half substitute Simone Pepe stepped up to smash the resulting penalty past Mariano Andujar. Napoli's defeat means Lazio, who sit three points ahead in third place, now require only a point from the city derby against Roma on Monday to make sure of at least a third place finish to claim the league's final Champions League spot. Even if the Azzurri upset predictions and finish among the top three, Benitez already looks to have planned his future elsewhere. The Spaniard is rumoured to have already agreed in principle to take over at Real Madrid after Carlo Ancelotti's failure to lead the 10-time European champions into the Champions League final following an aggregate defeat to Juve."
1256,22/05/2015,16:36,Guardiola turns down Barcelona's Berlin offer,Bayern Munich coach Pep Guardiola has turned down an invite from Barcelona to travel to Berlin to see his former side play Juventus in the Champions League final.,"""No, no, no, I will stay here,"" he said on Friday in Munich when asked about his personal invite from Barcelona for the June 6 final in Germany's capital. The 44-year-old steered Barcelona to the 2009 and 2011 Champions League titles during his four-year reign as head coach. Barcelona are on course to win the treble under new coach Luis Enrique having already won the Spanish league for the 23rd time. Barca will play Bilbao at home in the Spanish Cup final on May 30 and could seal the treble a week later in the Champions League final at Berlin's Olympic Stadium. Guardiola's Bayern will be crowned German league champions on Saturday for the 25th time following their home match against Mainz at the Allianz Arena. Bayern were beaten 5-3 on aggregate by Barcelona in the Champions League semi-finals having lost the first-leg 3-0 at the Camp Nou but won the return 3-2 in Munich. Having won 14 titles in four years at Barcelona, Guardiola has won five in his two seasons in Munich with a year left on his current contract."
1257,22/05/2015,15:03,Xavi to start final La Liga game,Barcelona boss Luis Enrique confirmed that Xavi Hernandez will captain the side on his 505th and final La Liga appearance for the Catalans at home to Deportivo la Coruna on Saturday.,"The 35-year-old announced on Thursday that he will leave the club for Qatari side Al-Sadd after a 17-year playing career that has already seen him win 23 trophies at club level. And he could yet leave with two more trophies as Barca face Athletic Bilbao in the Copa del Rey final in Xavi's last ever match at the Camp Nou next weekend before meeting Juventus in the Champions League final on June 6. ""Xavi will start tomorrow,"" Enrique told a press conference on Friday. ""Without him in the dressing room it will obviously be different. He has taken the decision that he believes is best for him. ""The years go by and everyone gets older. We have all spoken about what he has meant, continues to mean and will mean in the future for the club. He still has the chance to win two more titles."" Former Arsenal captain Thomas Vermaelen will also make his debut after an injury-ravaged season as Enrique admitted he will make a number of changes with the upcoming finals in mind."

Barcelona have always insisted they paid a transfer fee of 57 million euros ($65 million) to sign the Brazilian star from Santos in 2013. The court suspects the actual price was at least 83.3 million euros and that Rosell and Bartomeu hid the real cost from the taxman. It is alleged the overall fee was split between a number of different contracts between Barcelona, Santos and Neymar himself with the sole intention of signing the player. In doing so, Barcelona stand accused of defrauding the Spanish tax man of 12.7 million euros."

1260,21/05/2015,14:26,Legendary Xavi gets send-off season he deserved,"Barcelona's most decorated player of all-time, Xavi Hernandez, announced on Thursday he will bring to an end a stellar 17-year playing career with the Catalan giants at the end of the season.","The 35-year-old will follow in former international teammate Raul's footsteps by joining Qatari side Al Sadd in a major coup for the domestic football in a country set to host the 2022 World Cup. Yet, before bidding farewell to his homeland for the Middle East, Xavi has two more titles to add to his collection of 23 trophies with the Copa del Rey and Champions League finals to come. A fitting tribute will be paid to the man who has worn the Barca shirt more than any other on Saturday as the Blaugrana celebrate their La Liga title at home to Deportivo la Coruna. However, it is even more apt that the midfielder that has proved so decisive on the biggest stage for club and country over the past two decades will say farewell on the biggest stage. The Copa del Rey final against Athletic Bilbao will be his final game at the Camp Nou on May 30 before he hopes to claim a fourth Champions League title against Juventus in Berlin a week later. Win both and Barca will become the first club to win a treble of league, Cup and Champions League for the second time. It will also be a second for Xavi, having been at the heart of Pep Guardiola's treble-winning side in 2008/09. It could have been very different. Benched for the title decider against Atletico Madrid last season as Barca missed out on a major trophy for the first time in six years and the final two matches of Spain's disastrous World Cup defence in Brazil, he seemed set for a move to Qatar 12 months ago. ""Last summer it would have been too early. I was downhearted with two big disappointments at the World Cup and here at Barca,"" he said. ""Now we are capable and have the opportunity to make history. I am very happy to have stayed."" Convinced to stay on for a final year by former teammate Luis Enrique, his illustrous Barca career has had the final curtain it deserved as demonstrated by his tears at clinching an eighth Liga title when the Catalans exacted revenge on Atletico last weekend. Xavi was also an integral part of the Spain side that swept all before them in winning back-to-back European Championships in 2008 and 2012, as well as the country's first World Cup in 2010. His presence wasn't just felt on the field in his metronomic passing as Spain's flock of mini maestros led by he and sidekick Andres Iniesta gave birth to the technique reliant ""tiki-taka"" style at a time when the game was morphing into the age of the super-athlete. Xavi's success with the national team started well before Vienna in 2008 as he won the World Youth Championship in 1999 where a friendship with Real Madrid captain Iker Casillas first began. Together they brought a solidarity to the Spain squad from both sides of the Barca and Madrid divide to overcome the tag of perennial underachievers, even after the incendiary events of four El Clasico clashes in 18 days in 2011 as Jose Mourinho attempted to burn bridges between the two squads. ""I don't think there will be another player like him. He is an unique, inimitable player who has been instrumental to the club and the national team,"" Iniesta said on Tuesday. Fortunately for Xavi, Barcelona and Spanish football as a whole, he will leave as he deserves to; as a winner."
1261,21/05/2015,14:09,Xavi to leave Barcelona for Qatar at end of the season,Barcelona legend Xavi Hernandez confirmed on Thursday that he will end his 17-year playing career with the Catalans at the end of the season to join Qatari side Al Sadd.,"""I would like to announce my departure from Barcelona at the end of the season,"" he told a press conference adding that at some point he intends to return to the club. ""This season I am playing fewer minutes, I continue to feel useful and important, but it is the moment for a change."" As well as continuing his playing career with Al Sadd, Xavi will work with his two brothers and sister at the Aspire Academy with the intention of taking his first steps towards becoming a coach. ""We have an exciting project in Qatar. There I will continue to play football in Al Sadd, I have signed a contract for two years with the option for one more. ""I also have an exciting project at the Aspire Academy. I can learn how to be a future coach and sporting director. ""My principal objective is to return here, be it as a coach or sporting director."" The 35-year-old is Barca's most decorated player of all-time and could yet finish with two more titles with the Copa del Rey and Champions League finals against Athletic Bilbao and Juventus respectively to come. A homage to the midfielder is expected when Barcelona celebrate winning the La Liga title, Xavi's eighth league winners medal, at home to Deportivo la Coruna on Saturday. As well as being one of the key figures in the most successful era in Barcelona's history, Xavi was also an integral part of the Spain side that won three consecutive major tournaments at the European Championships in 2008 and 2012 and the country's first World Cup in 2010. In March he travelled to Qatar to meet Al Sadd club officials and will follow in the footsteps of Real Madrid legend and former international teammate Raul who played 44 games for Al Sadd, one of Qatar's top clubs, between 2012 and 2014, before joining the New York Cosmos in October 2014. On top of his success, Xavi will be remembered as the driving force behind Barcelona and Spain's possession-based 'tiki-taka' style of football which led both sides to become the dominant force in European football at club and international level. His departure follows that of other club heavyweights in recent years such as defender Carles Puyol and goalkeeper Victor Valdes as Barca's style has evolved from an era marked by home grown players to one now defined by a superstar front three of Lionel Messi, Neymar and Luis Suarez. Xavi almost left the club the end of last season after a first trophyless campaign in six years and a disastrous World Cup as Spain's defence ended after just two games, but was reportedly convinced by new coach and former teammate Luis Enrique to stay on. However, even under Enrique's orders his influence has waned with the majority of his 41 appearances coming off the bench, particularly in the biggest matches of the season."

He said the contract with Al Sadd would allow Xavi, presently the team captain, to train as a coach as well as playing. ""He is lucky to have received a really impressive offer that allows him to continue playing football, train as a future coach and also rest a little."" Xavi is Barcelona's most decorated player of all time and one of the heroes of Spain's Euro and World Cup-winning squads. In March he met with managers of Al Sadd, which announced on social media that he had signed with the club but the Qatari side then said the deal had not yet been sealed. Xavi will personally announce the move during a press conference on Thursday, Spanish media reported. His contract with the Spanish league champions runs until next year but the club had already made it clear that it would not stand in the way of his departure. ""Xavi has earned the right to decide his future,"" Barcelona president Josep Maria Bartomeu said in March when asked about the reports that the iconic playmaker had agreed to a move to Qatar. The player will be following in the footsteps of Real Madrid legend Raul who played 39 games for Al Sadd, one of Qatar's top clubs, between 2012 and 2014, before joining the New York Cosmos in October 2014. Barcelona sealed the league title on Sunday with a 1-0 win away over 2014 champions Atletico Madrid. Xavi was filmed weeping with joy after that win. It is his eighth title in the league and his 23rd overall with Barcelona, making him the player with most medals in the club's history. He still has the chance to end his last season at Barcelona with a treble, as his side will play in the finals of the Spanish cup and Champions League. Xavi joined Barcelona in 1991 at the age of 11. He has played more than 760 matches for the side -- more than any other player. The transfer will bring the curtain down on a 17-year first-team playing career with Barcelona, during which time Xavi has so far won three Champions League titles and two FIFA Club World Cups in addition to the eight La Liga championships. He was also an integral part of Spain's World Cup-winning side in 2010 and their two European Championship triumphs in 2008 and 2012. Beyond mere figures, he will also be remembered as being a central figure of Barcelona's revolutionary 'tiki-taka' style of football, which relies on possession and passing, and helped the Catalan side to become arguably the dominant team in Europe in the first decade of the century. His departure follows that of other club heavyweights in recent years such as defender Carles Puyol and goalkeeper Victor Valdes. Xavi almost left Barcelona at the end of last season after the Catalan side failed to win any silverware but was reportedly convinced by coach Luis Enrique to stay on. He has spent much of this season relegated to the bench although Enrique has relied on him during decisive matches. ""Xavi at this moment is exhausted, he has been playing for many years, it has been many matches, he also needs peace of mind,"" the player´s father told radio Cope. Xavi's signing is one of the biggest coups for Qatari domestic football in a country set to host the 2022 World Cup. Al Sadd competed in the Club World Cup in 2011, finishing third after being knocked out by Barcelona in the semi-finals. Reports suggest that Xavi will sign a three-year contract, with his role to combine coaching as well."

He said the contract with Al Sadd would allow Xavi to train as a coach as well as playing. ""He is lucky to have received a really impressive offer where he can continue playing football, train as a future coach and also rest a little."" He will give a farewell press conference on Thursday, Barcelona sports daily El Mundo Deportivo reported, citing unnamed club sources. His contract with the Spanish league champions runs until next year but he has reportedly decided to leave after the end of the current season. Barca sealed their league victory on Sunday with a 1-0 win away over Atletico Madrid. Xavi was filmed weeping with joy after that win. It is his eighth title in the league and his 23rd overall with Barcelona, making him the player with most medals in the club's history. He still has the chance to end his last season at Barcelona with a treble, as he side will play in the finals of the Spanish cup and Champions League. Xavi joined Barcelona in 1991 at the age of 11. He has played more than 760 matches for the side -- more than any other player."
1264,18/05/2015,02:05,Luis Enrique eyes new era of Barcelona dominance,Barcelona coach Luis Enrique believes his side's 23rd La Liga title can be the launching pad for another prolonged period of success and a potential treble this season.,"Lionel Messi scored the winner to hand the Catalans a fifth title in seven years with a 1-0 win at Atletico Madrid on Sunday as Barca returned the favour after Los Rojiblancos sealed the title at the Camp Nou exactly a year ago. Barca face Athletic Bilbao on home soil in the Copa del Rey final on May 30 before taking on Juventus in the Champions League final a week later. Luis Enrique was recruited along with seven new players last summer after Barca's first trophyless campaign in six years and he lauded their response in what he described a season of ""transition"". ""I hope it can be a new era. We have to deserve to win the other titles. We have two finals left and we need to show we are better than the opponents,"" he said. ""We started 10 months ago with many changes at the club and coming off a season having not won anything. ""We knew it would be a season of transition and we tried to do our best. We have two titles still to play for, but we already have the one that rewards consistency."" A treble would be just the second in Barca's 115-year history. However, many of the current squad were also part of the side that achieved the feat for the first time in the 2008/09 season. One of the those was midfielder Sergio Busquets and he insisted that the marathon of a 38-game La Liga season makes it the toughest competition to win. ""Last year we weren't at the level required to be champions. This year we are on the right track, the first trophy is out of the way and now we have to celebrate it because it's the hardest competition to win as you have to play against all of the teams and be consistent. ""It's the most important one, you're competing every week, playing against other sides home and away. The Champions League is more prestigious but the league's more important. ""We are still a young team. There are still quite a few players from the (Pep) Guardiola era. This could turn out to be an historic season for us."" In contrast to Barcelona's euphoria, Real Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti was left to face the fact that his side will go without a major trophy this season despite Crisiano Ronaldo registering his 30th hat-trick for the club in a 4-1 win at Espanyol. Madrid led the league for four months after a 22-game winning streak to end 2014, but ultimately paid for a run of one win in four games in February and March. ""I congratulate Barcelona and my colleague Luis Enrique for winning the title,"" said Ancelotti. ""The overall balance of the season isn't positive. Madrid always play to win and that hasn't happened. ""We had a very good first half of the season, but it was more difficult in the second part."""
1265,17/05/2015,22:00,Messi leads Barca's road from crisis club to champions,"A year that equal the best in Barcelona's history, with La Liga in the bag and Champions League and Copa del Rey finals to come, couldn't have started more inauspiciously.","The Catalans opened 2015 with a 1-0 defeat at Real Sociedad on the field and descended into full blown institutional crisis off it. Lionel Messi and Neymar had been left on the bench in San Sebastian after returning back from their Christmas holidays later than the rest of their teammates, a decision which didn't rest well with the former as he skipped an open training session with the club's fans the next day. On the same day, sporting director Andoni Zubizarreta was sacked and his assistant and club legend Carles Puyol walked. The following week Luis Enrique's job was on the line as champions Atletico Madrid visited the Camp Nou, but rather than leave their coach out to dry, Barca produced their best performance of the season and set in motion a run of 29 wins in 32 games to propel them to glory on all fronts. ""From the game against Real Sociedad, everything changed,"" Messi admitted weeks later. ""The attitude, the desire of the team to go out on the field in a different way and to press."" The biggest change came from Messi himself, though. A week after the Sociedad game, the four-time World Player of the Year had to watch Cristiano Ronaldo pick up his third Ballon d'Or and pronounce he was coming for Messi's record. Yet, in the five months which have followed it, Messi has again taken the lead in the rivalry between the two and recovered the level that made him the world's best between 2009 and 2012. ""I see him strong, quick, competitive. He has returned to being the player I had the priviledge to coach,"" said the most successful coach in Barca's history, Pep Guardiola, after watching a Messi masterclass eliminate his Bayern Munich side in the Champions League last week. If Messi's 54 goals and 30 assists have been the catalyst for Barca's stellar run, Neymar and Luis Suarez have starred in the supporting role. Messi's upturn in the new year coincided with Suarez recovering his best form after a four-month ban for biting at the World Cup and a switch in positions between the two as the Uruguayan played more centrally to allow Messi to use his full repetoire of skills from a deeper role. Suarez has added a different dimension to Barcelona, a directness and, at times, nastiness that offers more variety than had even Guardiola's trophy-laden four years in charge. ""He gives Barca the aggression that is so important in the attacking third,"" said Atletico boss Diego Simeone, who, having seen his side go unbeaten in six games against Barca last season, lost all four meetings this campaign. Meanwhile, Neymar's 37 goals means he has struck more than the likes of Samuel Eto'o, Ronaldinho, Rivaldo or Thierry Henry ever managed for Barca in a single season. Although often overlooked given his star-studded squad, Enrique also deserves his share of the credit. The former Celta Vigo coach's rotation policy was much criticised in the first half of the season. Enrique didn't name the same starting line-up for two consecutive league games until mid-January. However, whilst title rivals Real Madrid have floundered physically in the final few months of the campaign, Barca have got stronger when it matters most. Fittingly it was at Atletico, exactly a year to the day since Los Rojiblancos won the league at the Camp Nou, where the league title was won on Sunday thanks to a piece of Messi genius. The first trophy of what they hope and most expect to be a treble in three weeks time in Berlin."
1266,17/05/2015,21:16,Messi hands Barca 23rd Liga title,Barcelona claimed their fifth La Liga title in seven years and their 23rd overall as Lionel Messi scored the winner in a 1-0 victory at Atletico Madrid on Sunday.,"Exactly a year to the day since Atletico won the league in a title decider at Barca's Camp Nou, the Catalans exacted some measure of revenge to seal the first of a potential treble of trophies this season. Luis Enrique's men face Athletic Bilbao in the final of the Copa del Rey on home soil at the Camp Nou on May 30 and Juventus in the Champions League final a week later in Berlin. Cristiano Ronaldo struck his 30th Real Madrid hat-trick as Los Blancos bounced back from their Champions League elimination at the hands of Juventus to beat Espanyol 4-1, but it mattered little as they still trail Barca by four points with just one game to play. Meanwhile, defeat means Atletico need just a point on the final day to secure their place in the group stages of the Champions League next season by finishing third as Valencia could only manage a 1-1 draw at home to Celta Vigo. With temperatures at kick-off above 30 degrees celsius, a somewhat subdued start wasn't surprising, but it was the hosts who had the better openings early on. Claudio Bravo made a stunning save to palm Jose Maria Gimenez's header from a corner and the Chilean produced another fine stop moments later from Antoine Griezmann, although the Frenchman had already been flagged offside. Barca grew into the game as the half wore on with Messi testing Jan Oblak with a drive from the edge of the area and then a headed effort that was easily held by the Slovenian. The visitors were then left furious at referee Alberto Undiano Mallenco as he turned down two huge penalty claims. Firstly, another goalbound Messi header was diverted off target by the arm of Juanfran before Dani Alves went down under pressure from Diego Godin. Godin was booked for a foul outside the box despite contact continuing inside the area and Messi curled the resulting free-kick off the crossbar. Atletico threatened once more from a set-piece at the start of the second period but unlike his title winning strike last season, the unmarked Diego Godin couldn't turn his header on target. As so often this season, it was Messi who provided the moment of magic for Barca as he played a neat one-two with Pedro Rodriguez inside the area before prodding the ball into the far corner. Messi then teed up Neymar with a great opportunity to seal the title, but the Brazilian failed to continue his seven-game scoring streak as he blasted over with just Oblak to beat. That miss mattered little, though, as the visitors comfortably saw out the final few minutes. Madrid did all they could to keep the pressure on Barca as Ronaldo all but ensured he will at least win his duel with Messi to be the league's top scorer by taking his tally for the league season to 45. The Portuguese put Madrid ahead before an error from Keylor Navas allowed Christian Stuani to level for Espanyol. However, Marcelo put Carlo Ancelotti's men back in front before Ronaldo struck twice more in the final eight minutes. At the bottom Deportivo la Coruna and Granada moved out of the relegation zone with victories over Levante and Real Sociedad respectively. They now lead Eibar and Almeria by two points with all four fighting for survival on the final day of the season next Saturday."
1267,17/05/2015,18:10,Suarez misses Barca title tilt at Atletico,Barcelona will have to do without star striker Luis Suarez as they look to seal the Spanish title away at Atletico Madrid on Sunday.,The Uruguayan has been left out of Luis Enrique's squad due to a hamstring injury picked up as Barca booked their place in the Champions League final in midweek with a 5-3 aggregate win over Bayern Munich. Pedro Rodriguez deputises for Suarez alongside Lionel Messi and Neymar up front with Barca otherwise at full strength. The Catalans lead Real Madrid by four points with two games remaining and will be crowned champions for a 23rd time as long as they match Los Blancos' result at Espanyol.
1268,16/05/2015,15:41,Barca not seeking revenge at Atletico - Luis Enrique,Barcelona coach Luis Enrique insisted revenge will not fuel his side's thirst to win La Liga when they travel to face Atletico Madrid on Sunday.,"The match comes exactly a year to the day since Atletico won the league on Barca's home pitch on the final day of last season. A 23rd Liga title would also be the first trophy of a potential treble for Barca as they face Athletic Bilbao in the Copa del Rey final and reached the Champions League final in midweek with a 5-3 aggregate win over Bayern Munich. ""I haven't seen any desire for revenge among my players. Atletico had a great season last year and were deserved champions,"" said Enrique. ""The schedule has decided that we play on the penultimate game in the Calderon and it is exciting. ""If we are not intense in a game like this then we can't win. This game will be like a final and in the two finals we need to play with the maximum intensity to win the prize. ""It is one thing to have got to here, but the players are very realistic and they know how difficult it is to win the three titles and equal what they did a few years ago. We have to play three great games."" Barca could also be at full strength as Luis Suarez trained with his teammates on Saturday despite suffering a hamstring injury that forced him off at half-time in Munich in midweek. ""We will see tomorrow. Luis is a lot better but tomorrow we will see how he is and what condition he is in to play,"" added Enrique."
1269,15/05/2015,03:00,Barca with title in sight after strike lifted,Barcelona can round off a fine week by clinching their 23rd La Liga title and exacting revenge on Atletico Madrid for losing out in last season's title decider at the Vicente Calderon on Sunday.,"A proposed players' strike had threatened the La Liga calendar this weekend, but that threat was lifted on Thursday when Spain's National Court concluded a strike would ""cause a serious organisational disorder"" to the end of the league season. Atletico won the league with a 1-1 draw the Camp Nou on May 17 last year and Barca can return the favour exactly a year later as long as they match Real Madrid's result at Espanyol. Luis Enrique's men remained on course for a treble by sealing their place in the Champions League final against Juventus early next month on Tuesday despite a first defeat in 19 games 3-2 away at Bayern Munich as the Catalans progressed 5-3 on aggregate. ""We are just one victory away in every competition from being champions,"" said Enrique. ""The feelings are very positive. It is a great moment, but now we need to finish it off. ""The evaluation of the season will come at the end."" However, Atletico also have plenty to play for as they are one win away from sealing third place and therefore avoiding a tricky Champions League qualifier in August. Fernando Torres came off the bench to score the equaliser in a 2-2 draw at Levante last weekend that guaranteed a top four finish for Diego Simeone's men, but insisted he doesn't want to see Barcelona celebrating at the Calderon on Sunday. ""I hope that they don't win it here. We hope to win the game and assure third place,"" he told the club's website. ""Atletico were champions last year in the Camp Nou, and it is not that strange in football that destiny decides Barcelona have the chance to be champions in our stadium. ""That doesn't mean anything to us though because it is not our fight. We want to be third and achieve the objective we have."" Atletico's chances could be boosted by the absence of Barca striker Luis Suarez. The Uruguayan set up both Barca's goals, scored by Neymar, at the Allianz Arena in midweek but had to be replaced at half-time with a hamstring problem and it unlikely to be risked with the Copa del Rey and Champions League finals less than a month away. Real Madrid have to pick themselves up from the bitter disappointment of losing their Champions League semi-final to Juventus in midweek if they are to have any chance of winning a major trophy this season. Coach Carlo Ancelotti may have taken charge of his last game from the Madrid bench as he will serve a two-game touchline ban for their remaining Liga fixtures for sarcastically applauding the officials in last week's 2-2 draw at Valencia. Defender Sergio Ramos is also expected to miss the rest of the season with a calf injury picked up against Juventus. The battle for European places and to avoid relegation means that only four teams have nothing to play for with two games remaining. Valencia can secure their return to Champions League football with victory at home to Celta Vigo. Meanwhile, Malaga, Espanyol, Athletic Bilbao, Celta and Rayo Vallecano are separated by four points in the fight for seventh place, which would yield Europa League qualification if Barca beat Athletic in the Copa del Rey final. At the bottom, Eibar, Deportivo la Coruna and Granada are all locked on 31 points with Almeria just one point ahead. Almeria could also still be docked three points should their appeal against that sanction from FIFA for unpaid transfer fees to foreign clubs be upheld by the Court of Arbitration for Sport later this week."

""A final against Madrid would be very exciting and historic,"" said the Spanish international. Barca are not just on the verge of their fifth European Cup, but are three matches away from just the second treble in the club's history. Luis Enrique's men will seal La Liga with victory over Atletico Madrid on Sunday and also host Athletic Bilbao at the Camp Nou in the Copa del Rey final on May 30. ""It is a great stat to be in a fourth final of the Champions League in 10 years. During these years our era has been defined by results, our philosophy and I am very happy to have been part of these years. ""It looks very good at the moment, but we need to finish it off. We have done things well, but the most difficult bit is ending the season with titles."""
1271,13/05/2015,00:37,Guardiola backing Barca to win Berlin final,Bayern Munich coach Pep Guardiola is now backing his ex-club Barcelona to win the Champions League after his Bavarian giants bowed out 5-3 on aggregate in the semi-finals.,"Guardiola's Bayern exited at the last-four stage for the second year running, despite ending Barcelona's 18-game unbeaten run with a 3-2 semi-final, second-leg win in Munich. Bayern were given an early glimmer of hope in their bid to overturn a three-goal deficit in Munich when the unmarked Medhi Benatia headed home on seven minutes at the Allianz Arena. But Barca effectively booked their place in the Berlin final on June 6 when Luis Suarez twice set up Neymar to score for the visitors before half an hour had been played. Bayern produced a rousing second-half performance with goals by Robert Lewandowski and Thomas Mueller, but Barcelona advance to face either bitter rivals Real Madrid or Juventus in the final. Having won 16 titles as a player, then a further 14 in four years as head coach at the Camp Nou, Guardiola is backing Barcelona to claim their first European crown since 2011 at Berlin's Olympic Stadium on June 6. ""I want to congratulate my players, I am really happy to be their manager on a day like today,"" said Guardiola, as Bayern denied Barcelona a first win in Munich at the fifth attempt. ""But I hope Barcelona can now win their fifth Champions League title in Berlin. ""You can only beat Barcelona when you take the ball away from them, with it they are so strong. ""We didn't make the most of our chances in the first leg, but here we did. ""It wasn't enough at the end of the day, but there you go. ""I hope the Spanish league has the rights to be screened in Germany soon, so that fans here can appreciate what a good player Lionel Messi is on a regular basis. ""He was a pleasure to coach when I was at Barcelona and he has demonstrated yet again what he can do."" The win over Barcelona ended Bayern's four-match losing streak since winning the German league title for the 25th time a fortnight ago. ""We won four titles last season, this year we have just one, but it has been a tough season with lots of injuries and despite that, my players still attacked at every opportunity,"" enthused Guardiola. Bayern's come-back win demonstrated how much they wanted to reach an 11th European Cup final, but it was too little, too late, after their emphatic first-leg defeat. ""We believed in the miracle, but we couldn't make it happen,"" said Bayern captain Philipp Lahm. ""It's impossible to stop those Barcelona players for the whole 90 minutes. ""We didn't lose it today, but in the first leg."" Goal-scorer Mueller was a constant threat to the Barcelona defence and made good on his pre-match promise that Bayern would fight until the final whistle. ""We played a really great game in the first half but we've made two mistakes in defence and have been too wasteful with our chances,"" said Mueller. ""That's very annoying."""

However, the final outcome of the tie was put beyond doubt when Luis Suarez twice set up Neymar to score for the visitors before half an hour had been played. Bayern produced a rousing second-half performance and goals from Robert Lewandowski and Thomas Mueller allowed them to win the game on the night, but Barcelona advance to the final in Berlin on June 6.

But the Barcelona coach thinks Bayern will throw the proverbial kitchen sink at his side despite Pep Guardiola's men being on a four-match losing streak. ""We know how big Bayern Munich are and we will have to be at our best to progress,"" said the 45-year-old Luis Enrique, whose side have not conceded a goal in their last seven games. ""It won't be an easy game and we will have to suffer. ""If we take the lead it would be good for us, but Bayern has the quality to score and they caused us problems in Barcelona. ""They will be at home and will have the crowd behind them, but we are on a good run and hope to take our chances. ""We don't want the game to turn into a crazy one and we have to use our weapons to hurt our rivals."" Earlier on Monday, Guardiola described Barcelona as the ""best counter-attacking side in the world"", but Luis Enrique predicts a battle for possession at the Allianz Arena. ""If Pep said that, we accept his praise, but just like Bayern, we want to maintain possession and we want to create openings,"" said the Barcelona coach. ""We want the game to be as similar as possible to the first leg, when everyone attacks and everyone defends, but we will have to go out focused on winning."" Barcelona's Argentinian midfielder Javier Mascherano said the visitors will not hold back as they chase a first away win against Bayern. ""We will attack because we do not know how to play any other way - it's the club philosophy,"" said the 30-year-old defensive midfielder. ""To reach the final in Berlin, we will have to play the perfect game, because Bayern will demand it of us. ""We are very competitive, we want to win titles - we are 90 minutes away from the final, which was one of our goals before the season started. ""We will do everything to fulfil our dream. ""If you get to this stage, every mistake can be punished - we have to take it step by step. ""I expect a hungry Bayern team, right from the start. ""They will try to score, we know how they play at home, but we are prepared for everything and nothing will surprise us."""

Having already turned over a 3-1 first-leg defeat to triumph 6-1 against Porto in the quarter-finals, Mueller believes Bayern can again pull off the unlikely and shock the Spanish league leaders. ""I wouldn't say that we need a miracle,"" said 25-year-old Mueller. ""Since we left the Camp Nou we have wanted to make up for it. ""If we go through, it will be a statement which the football world didn't expect. ""Whether or not that could be classed as a miracle is up to you, but in football, many things are possible. ""That's why there's still hope and we still believe in ourselves. ""We're in a similar position to when we were sat here two weeks ago. ""We can't expect things to go like they did against Porto, but that's what we need."" Nevertheless, Mueller is under no illusions of what to expect with Barcelona -- and Lionel Messi in particular -- currently in supreme form. ""We need passion, determination, the support of the fans and to believe in ourselves,"" he said. ""The goal is for things to turn out the way they did against Porto, but we know that won't be easy. ""We have to find the right mix of better attacking and to be more calm on the ball, which was our problem last time against Barcelona. ""We have nothing to lose against Barca and this is how the players and the coach are approaching the match. ""We'll give it a try, it is not over yet. We will give everything until the referee blows his whistle."" Messi was the architect of Bayern's downfall in Barcelona with two goals before setting up Neymar for their third. The hosts are determined not to concede a goal, but neither can they focus purely on keeping Messi subdued. ""The problem isn't Messi alone, the problem is the whole Barca team,"" said Bayern defender Rafinha. ""Everyone knows how good he is, a player like that can do virtually nothing all game and then turn the match with one pass, but it's not just about him."""

No team has ever over-turned a three-goal deficit in a European semi-final. With his side staring down the barrel of a semi-final exit for the second year running, Guardiola knows Bayern can ill afford to throw caution to the wind against a Barcelona attack boasting Messi, Neymar and Luis Suarez. But he believes they can shock the Spanish league leaders. ""Push forward, push forward? No! We have to defend well and control the game,"" said the 44-year-old, who has denied rumours linking him to Manchester City for next season. ""There is no problem with this team's mentality. ""There are six or seven guys in the squad who have won the World Cup and they know what needs to be done. ""It's not enough to have the most possession and defend well, you also have to create chances against Barcelona. ""If we make a mistake, they will punish it. ""We have to take the chances we create, it won't be easy, but with the quality we have, we'll see what happens."" One factor in Bayern's favour is that they emphatically turned their 3-1 quarter-final, first-leg defeat at Porto into a 6-1 rout in Munich with five goals in the opening 45 minutes. But a fortnight on, Bayern are on a four-match losing streak, although Guardiola insists confidence is not a problem. ""The players have showed that they want this,"" said the Spaniard. ""We turned around a 3-1 against Porto, but this is completely different. ""It's a huge challenge, but we will try."" Barcelona arrive with a significant advantage in their bid for a first victory in the Bavarian capital. Strangely, Barca couch Luis Enrique has insisted ""it doesn't look good for us"", but Guardiola admits he would have said the same thing if the roles were reversed. ""As a coach, you don't know what will happen, I would have said the same in his position,"" said Guardiola. ""We are Bayern Munich. I have never thought before a game that we have no chance."""
1276,11/05/2015,02:15,Bayern need Munich miracle to deny Barcelona,"Pep Guardiola has promised embattled Bayern Munich will put up a fight in Tuesday's Champions League semi-final, second-leg, in their near-impossible bid to deny Barcelona an eighth final appearance.","Bayern are chasing a miracle at the Allianz Arena after their humbling 3-0 first-leg defeat at the Camp Nou last Wednesday when Lionel Messi capped a dazzling display with two goals. No team has ever over-turned a three-goal deficit in a European semi-final. ""We all know it's going to be a mammoth task, but we're not going to give up,"" said Bayern forward Thomas Mueller. Bayern believe they can claim a historic win with Germany captain Bastian Schweinsteiger suggesting: ""Sometimes unbelievable things happen in football and we hope we're going to catch one of those days"". But their confidence has been dented by losing their last four games since winning the German league for the 25th time a fortnight ago and the losing streak is their longest since 1991. In Saturday's latest defeat, Bayern crashed 1-0 at home to neighbours Augsburg and had to play 77 minutes with ten-men after reserve goalkeeper Pepe Reina was sent off. Having also lost 2-0 at Leverkusen the previous week before their drubbing in Barcelona, it is the first time Bayern have failed to score in three consecutive games for 15 years. But Bayern coach Guardiola, a former Barcelona boss, insists his side must keep their dreams alive. ""I am realistic, that is the only way you can win,"" said the Spaniard, who has warned his side they risk being routed unless they contain Barcelona's star-studded attack. ""The dream is still there and we have 90 minutes. It won't be easy, but I am a fighter."" In contrast, Barca are in fine form having scored 19 goals in their last four games. They are poised to win the Spanish league title after beating David Moyes's Real Sociedad 2-0 on Saturday which left them four points ahead of rivals Real Madrid. Brazil star Neymar has now scored in each of his last six matches to take his tally for the season to 35, while Barca have now not conceded for seven straight games. But Barca coach Luis Enrique refuses to believe Bayern will bow out of Europe without a fight. ""I saw it (the defeat against Augsburg). They lost, but they played 70 minutes with 10 men. We will suffer a lot in Munich,"" said the Barca boss. ""They are a unique opponent, who know what it is like to turn around important matches already this season. ""We will never think that it is done, nor even that it looks very good for us. We need to defend as far away from our goal as possible."" One ray of hope, as Bayern goalkeeper Manuel Neuer put it, is the fact Guardiola's side emphatically turned their 3-1 quarter-final, first-leg defeat at Porto into a 6-1 rout in Munich with five goals in the opening 45 minutes. But in-form Barca are a different proposition after Messi dazzled in the first leg with two goals and an assist for Neymar's 94th-minute goal. ""We have to give our all. We have showed many times how well we can perform in Munich,"" said Bayern's top-scorer Robert Lewandowski, who will again play with a protective mask after fracturing his nose and cheekbone nearly two weeks ago. ""It's not yet over and we'll fight to the end."""

They were joined by a number of senior Madrid and Barca players, including club captain Iker Casillas and Xavi Hernandez, at a press conference organised by the players' union AFE on Thursday to support strike action. ""Sincerely, I think it is a topic that will be fixed in the coming days,"" Ancelotti said on Friday. ""I think there was a little lack of communication between the parties, they are going to meet and in the end take the right decision. I think the league will end normally."" Barcelona lead Madrid at the top of the table by two points with three games to go. However, the league leaders trip to Atletico Madrid next weekend is one of the most high-profile games under threat should the strike go ahead. ""I hope it won't get to that stage, I hope that the dialogue between the parties prevails and it can be fixed,"" Enrique said. ""All the parties have their own reasonable positions, but you have to bear in mind what the players and people involved in football think and find a solution through dialogue. That would be for the best."" The long-awaited reform of selling the television deals was expected to provide a significant financial boost to Spanish football, particularly those clubs out with the perennial powerhouses of Barca and Madrid. Spain's junior sports minister Miguel Cardenal claimed on Friday that there was ""no real reason for a strike."" However, the head of Spanish Professional Football League Javier Tebas and the head of the Federation, Angel Maria Villar, have been engaged in a long-running battle for the control of the Spanish game. ""Villar is irresponsible and cheeky,"" Tebas said in an explosive statement on Thursday. ""He treats football like his own private estate."" The league branded the strike threat ""irresponsible"" and said it would launch a legal appeal against it on Friday."
1278,07/05/2015,12:56,Five reasons why Bayern lost at Barcelona,"Five reasons why Bayern Munich lost 3-0 to Barcelona in their Champions League semi-final, first-leg ahead of Tuesday's return leg at the Allianz Arena:","1) Lionel Messi - The midfield maestro netted twice in three minutes to stun Pep Guardiola's Bayern before putting Neymar through to score the hosts' third goal with the type of inspired performance which could make the Argentinian a shoe-in for the 2015 Ballon d'Or if repeated. 2) Jerome Boateng - He may have won the World Cup, the Champions League and three Bundesliga titles, but the Germany centre-back was left prostrate on the Camp Nou turf in the wake of some magical footwork from Messi for his second goal. It was a move former England international Jamie Redknapp described as ""almost illegal"". 3) No Arjen Robben or Franck Ribery - Robben scored 19 goals this season before torn stomach muscles, then a torn calf on his return ended his season. Likewise, Bayern have been missing France winger Franck Ribery since March 11 due to an ankle injury. Without their pace, Bayern have struggled to sparkle down the flanks. 4) Robert Lewandowski's miss - The Poland striker played at the Camp Nou with a protective mask after fracturing his cheekbone and nose in Bayern's German Cup semi-final defeat to Borussia Dortmund. But Bayern's top hot-shot, who has scored 23 times this season, missed an absolute sitter on 18 minutes when Thomas Mueller's cross brushed past his boot right in front of goal. Had Bayern taken an early lead, the Germans chances in the return leg would look a little less pessimistic. 5) Defeat to Dortmund - Bayern's German Cup semi-final defeat week last Tuesday in a penalty shoot-out cost the Bavarians dearly on a number of levels. Robben was ruled out for the rest of the season and Bayern's hopes of repeating their 2013 treble of Champions League, Bundesliga and cup titles were ended. The defeat was followed up by a league loss at Bayer Leverkusen last Saturday which seemed to take Bayern's confidence down a few notches. As Bayern coach Pep Guardiola admitted, winning the German league or cup does little to satisfy the Bavarians' hunger for titles: they want to win the treble, including the Champions League."

""There is no defence that can stop Messi. It is impossible,"" Guardiola said on his return to the Camp Nou wearing the colours of the opposition for the first time. ""How he is playing at the moment, you cannot stop him. ""Defending with nine in your area or 11 pressing high. You can't always be at your best physically during your career, there are ups and downs, but the way he has played the last four or five months there is no way to stop him. He is too good.

""He was with us for a long time and we had the luck to win many title and experience important moments. He is a coach that studies everything,"" said the Argentine on Tuesday. ""It is the same for both sides. Pep knows us very well and we know what he asks of his players. It is 50-50, we both know each other very well."" Barca also have revenge on their minds, though, after Bayern inflicted their heaviest ever European defeat in a 7-0 thrashing at the same stage of the competition two years ago. ""We need to prepare for the game knowing what it means playing in a semi-final of the Champions League and against a great team. ""That semi-final hurt us a lot, but a lot of time has passed since. We come into the game differently, as do they, and it will be a different tie to that one."" Guardiola is expected to get a hero's welcome on his first visit to the Camp Nou in the opposition camp after 15 years at the club as a player and coach. However, Messi is confident sentiment will be left to one side once the game starts and a place in the final in Berlin on June 6 is at stake. ""It is normal that there is a homage for what he meant as a coach because he won everything here and gave a lot to the club. Once the game starts that will be left to one side and the fans will support the team to try and win as normal."" Barca are seven games away from matching the historic treble of La Liga, Champions League and Copa del Rey that they won for the only time in the club's history in Guardiola's first season in charge. And Messi said it was the pain of a trophyless season last year, not losing out in his personal dual with Cristiano Ronaldo for the Ballon d'Or that has seen a spike in his performance this season. ""We are feeling very good because of how we are playing in every game. We are calm, going step-by-step and thinking about the next game. ""We know that there is little to go (in the season) and we are very close, but there are still very tough games to play. ""I always said that the most important thing for me are the collective titles. ""Last year we didn't have the fortune to win any and therefore we are desperate to win this year. The individual prizes come from great years winning titles."" Barca boss Luis Enrique is a former teammate of Guardiola, but he insisted his focus was more on the four-time European champions than his friend. ""We are not planning a game against Pep, but a semi-final against a historic team like Bayern and we are desperate to reach the final."" Bayern travel to Catalonia riddled by injuries as Arjen Robben, Franck Ribery, Holger Badstuber and David Alaba miss out. However, Enrique dismissed suggestions those absences would give his side the upper hand. ""I think that the Bayern squad is sufficiently strong to not notice those absences. They have done that throughout the season."""
1284,05/05/2015,08:38,Luis Enrique shining in Guardiola's shadow,"Despite the presence of Lionel Messi and 14 World Cup winners, the attention will be on the touchline as much as the pitch when Pep Guardiola leads his Bayern Munich side into the stadium he called home for so long on Wednesday.","Guardiola has been to Barcelona's Camp Nou hundreds of times, as captain during an 11-year playing career and most memorably in winning 14 trophies in a four-year spell as the club's most successful ever coach. The last time he was there, for Barca's Champions League win over Manchester City in February, he sat in his seat, a season ticket in the stands next to his father. This midweek, though, he will experience the vast concrete bowl of a ground from a different angle, as the opposition coach as Bayern travel to Catalonia in the first-leg of their Champions League semi-final. His visit couldn't have come at a better time for his former teammate and friend Luis Enrique. The Barca boss has followed in Guardiola's footsteps throughout his playing and coaching career. Enrique became captain after Guardiola's departure and started his managerial career by succeeding his former teammate as Barca B coach when Guardiola took over the senior team in 2008. That pattern continued when Barca called on a former legend and fan-favourite to spark an under-achieving squad after a trophyless season by hiring Enrique, just as they had when Guardiola supplanted Frank Rijkaard. Almost 12 months later Enrique stands on the brink of matching Guardiola's biggest achievement by delivering the treble in his first season in charge. As well the pursuit of a fifth European Cup, Barca hold a two-point lead in La Liga with three games to play and will host Athletic Bilbao in the final of the Copa del Rey at the end of the month. The similarities to Guardiola's first season are striking. Propelled by a star front three, Barca top scored and conceded least in La Liga, beat Athletic in the Cup final and overcame French and English opposition as well as Bayern on the way to the Champions League. Yet, Enrique has also been his own man and statistically made an even better start to his Barca coaching career than Guardiola, winning 48 of his first 56 games in charge to Guardiola's 40. The forward triumvirate of Messi, Luis Suarez and Neymar have already surpassed the 100-goal record set by the Argentine, Thierry Henry and Samuel Eto'o six years ago with 108 goals between them this season despite Suarez missing the first two months of the season due to suspension. Most significantly Enrique has changed Barca's somewhat dogmatic style under Guardiola for more varied sytle that relies less on possession. The two bedrocks of the midfield in Guardiola's era of Andres Iniesta and Xavi have only started together four times this season. Instead of their metronomic ability in possession, Enrique has looked for a more direct approach with physically superior midfield players in Ivan Rakitic and Rafinha looking to feed the front three quickly. There has also been a dramatic improvement in defending set-pieces, a perennial weakness in recent years, but which hasn't cost the Blaugrana a single goal since October. With the political uncertainty of club elections coming at the end of the season, Enrique's future as coach next year remains up in the air despite his success. When the semi-final draw was made he described Guardiola as ""the best coach in the world, for what he has won, how he has adapted to a new country and because he is my friend."" There would be no better way to ensure his future is at the Camp Nou than by taking down his pal, and the best coach Barca have ever had, over the two legs of this enthralling semi-final over the next week."

And as a coach he led the club to 14 trophies, including two Champions Leagues titles during a glorious four-year spell between 2008 and 2012. However, he now must find a way to outwit former teammate and friend, the Barcelona coach Luis Enrique, and a host of his former charges who are in sensational form. Having won 26 of their last 28 games in all competitions, Barca are on course to repeat the historic treble of La Liga, Champions League and Copa del Rey which they won in Guardiola's first season in charge. ""There is a good relationship there, because we've known each other for so long,"" said Barca midfielder Andres Iniesta. ""We went through a lot together and, therefore, it will be nice and special for everyone."" The tie could even see brothers come face-to-face as former Barca midfielder Thiago Alcantara returns to his former club where younger brother Rafinha is now a first-team regular. Revenge could also be on Barca's minds, though, as they suffered their heaviest ever European defeat in a 7-0 aggregate thrashing by Bayern at this stage of the competition two years ago. ""These games are surrounded by tension given what you are playing for and because it is just one step from the final,"" added Iniesta. ""Moreover, the season is going great and we are just a little away from achieving our objectives. These are all extra elements which add to the game, but the key is to enjoy what you are doing."" Thomas Mueller certainly enjoyed the meeting two years ago as he scored three times over the two legs and the German World Cup winner is hoping those good memories will lift a Bayern side that has struggled for fitness and form in recent weeks. ""It was a great experience, we played brilliantly back then and had the whole footballing world marvelling at us,"" he said. ""I will certainly arrive at the stadium on Wednesday with a positive feeling."" Bayern's top-scorer Robert Lewandowski looks set to play with a protective face mask despite breaking his nose and cheekbone in last week's penalty shoot out defeat to Borussia Dortmund in the German Cup semi-finals. The German champions will be without Arjen Robben, Franck Ribery, David Alaba and Holger Badstuber through injury, though. By contrast, Barcelona are at full-strength and in top form having struck 16 goals without reply in their last two games. The stellar front three of Lionel Messi, Luis Suarez and Neymar registered 11 of those goals to take their tally for the season to 108, along with 50 assists. However, Mueller is confident that Guardiola's inside knowledge could give them the upper hand. ""The coach knows this team better than anyone else. He will give us the formula for success -- the rest we'll have to do as players."""
1287,04/05/2015,13:39,Bayern's Lewandowski can face Barca,"Bayern Munich's Robert Lewandowski trained with a protective mask on Monday and could face Barcelona in Wednesday's Champions League semi-final despite a broken cheekbone, according to team-mate Jerome Boateng.","""He moved well and made a good impression, it looks like he's fit to play,"" Bayern defender Boateng told reporters in Munich after training with Lewandowski. ""He didn't have any fear, he is very brave and he will get used to the mask."" The 26-year-old Lewandowski, the German champions' top-scorer with 23 goals, sat out Bayern's 2-0 league defeat at Bayer Leverkusen on Saturday to try and get him fit for the first leg at the Camp Nou. The striker broke his nose, cheekbone and suffered concussion during a clash with goalkeeper Mitchell Langerak late in Munich's German Cup semi-final defeat to Borussia Dortmund last Tuesday. Bayern have said they will leave the decision to Lewandowski as to whether he plays, but the Poland international posted a picture of himself wearing the mask on Sunday with the text ""Ready for the next challenge"" in Polish."
1288,04/05/2015,02:00,Bayern falter ahead of Pep's Barca return,Bayern Munich head to Spain for Wednesday's Champions League semi-final -- and Pep Guardiola's return to Barcelona -- showing cracks in confidence following back-to-back defeats.,"After wrapping up their 25th German league title last Sunday, Bayern's costly penalty shoot-out defeat to Borussia Dortmund last Tuesday in the German Cup semi-final was followed up by a 2-0 loss at Bayer Leverkusen on Saturday. It has been the worst possible run-in to the match at Camp Nou where Guardiola will be making his first return to the club where he won 14 cups and titles in his four years in charge up to 2012. ""We aren't going to talk ourselves into a corner, the season has been awesome until now,"" said Bayern's director of sport Matthias Sammer. ""The players and coach have deserved every compliment that has come their way more than any criticism."" But the Dortmund defeat brought injuries to two stars. Arjen Robben limped off -- and out for the rest of the season -- after lasting just 16 minutes of the second-half. Having recovered from torn abdominal muscles, the Dutch winger, who has 19 goals this season, tore his left calf to end his season. Then Robert Lewandowski, Bayern's top scorer with 23 goals, fractured his nose and cheekbone in an extra-time clash with Dortmund goalkeeper Mitchell Langerak. Sammer says the decision as to whether Lewandowski plays at Barcelona with a protective mask will be made by the player. Guardiola gave reserve team defender Rico Strieder and striker Lukas Goertler senior debuts at Leverkusen while resting stars Thomas Mueller, Jerome Boateng, Juan Bernat and Xabi Alonso. ""The main thing is that no one else got injured,"" admitted Germany captain Bastian Schweinsteiger as Bayern headed back to Munich. While Bayern were struggling in Leverkusen, Barcelona ran riot at Cordoba with Luis Suarez claiming a hat-trick while Lionel Messi hit two and Neymar also netting in Saturday's 8-0 thrashing. ""With all due respect, Barcelona got that result against the bottom side,"" insisted Sammer. ""We played with two youth team players against a Champions League side. There's a difference. ""We have the necessary respect for Barcelona and their many world-class players, but we also have a few world champions."" Bayern's Spain international Javi Martinez came off the bench to make his first appearance after nearly nine months out with injury. But it is probably too soon for him to face Suarez, Neymar and Messi. Centre-back Medhi Benatia is set to feature in Barcelona after a leg injury. ""I played against Suarez in the Europa League, when he played for Liverpool,"" said the 28-year-old. ""I haven't played yet against Messi and Neymar, but there is always a first time for everything. ""Personally, I respect them, but that's not valid for the 90 minutes on the pitch, there will be no respect then."" This is not the first time Bayern have suffered a dip after winning the league title under Guardiola. Having wrapped up the 2013-14 title with a record seven games to spare, Bayern suffered a rare league defeat at Augsburg which was followed by a 3-0 mauling in Munich by Dortmund. Two weeks later, they lost 1-0 at Real Madrid in last year's Champions League semi-finals first leg before being routed 4-0 in Munich. Sammer insists the new back-to-back defeats have had no impact on the squad, other than ending their hopes of winning the treble. ""Pep has already won five titles with Bayern and his second season isn't over yet,"" said Sammer. ""He shouldn't have to feel under too much pressure against his former club. ""I hazard a guess that he has more composure than that."""
1289,03/05/2015,13:59,Lewandowski to decide whether he faces Barca,Bayern Munich's director of sport Matthias Sammer said Sunday that only Robert Lewandowski himself will decide whether he plays against Barcelona in Wednesday's Champions League semi-final with a broken cheekbone.,"""It will be decided by the doctors, the player himself and whether he can play with the mask,"" Sammer told German broadcaster ZDF. ""One thing is clear. No player in the world is so important, that you put his health at risk."" The 26-year-old Lewandowski, the German champions' top-scorer with 23 goals, sat out Bayern's 2-0 league defeat at Bayer Leverkusen on Saturday to try and get him fit for the first leg at the Camp Nou. Lewandowski broke his nose, cheekbone and suffered concussion during a clash with goalkeeper Mitchell Langerak late in Munich's German Cup semi-final defeat to Borussia Dortmund last Tuesday. Lewandowski's agent Cezary Kucharski said he will advise his client against playing if he is less than 100 percent sure about playing with a protective mask. ""I'll advise Lewandowski against playing against Barcelona if there is a risk,"" Kucharski told Euro Sport. Sammer offered little hope that French winger Franck Ribery will be fit for the Camp Nou showdown while Dutch winger Arjen Robben is out for the rest of the season with a torn left calf. ""In all honesty, Ribery is rather a long way from making an appearance,"" Sammer said of Ribery, who has not played since March 11 with an ankle injury."
1290,01/05/2015,16:18,Barca need to finish marathon season in style,Barcelona boss Luis Enrique has urged his side not to let up in the quest for a potential treble despite facing the doomed Cordoba on Saturday just days before entertaining Bayern Munich in the Champions League.,"Cordoba's relegation back to the second tier after just one season in La Liga will be confirmed at the weekend unless they pull off a monumental upset to register their first league win since January. By contrast, Barca have swept aside their opponents of late, including a stunning 6-0 thrashing of Getafe on Tuesday, to consolidate their two-point lead over Real Madrid with four La Liga games to play. ""We need to concentrate on winning our own points. If we win all the games it doesn't matter what the opponents do,"" Luis Enrique said on Friday. ""Evidently, I want the rival to drop points but what matters most to me is my team. ""Until you get to the finish line you don't know if you have achieved the objectives. It is like if a marathon runner has a great time after 40 kilometres and then stops and starts to walk."" While Barca could be forced to fight until the final match to win their fifth title in seven years, Bayern will be able to rest up when they face Bayer Leverkusen on Saturday having already sealed a 25th German title. However, Luis Enrique played down suggestions that could give Pep Guardiola's men an advantage ahead of their semi-final, first-leg meeting at the Camp Nou next Wednesday. ""I would have preferred to have won the league 15 weeks ago, but that is not possible. ""I don't think it is an advantage fighting until the end, but nor is it a disadvantage. It ensures we are on our guard."""
1291,30/04/2015,19:54,Messi to become a father for second time,Barcelona superstar Lionel Messi announced on Thursday he is to be a father again by posting a picture of his pregnant partner on social media.,"The four-time Ballon d'Or, 27, took to Instagram to post a picture of his son, Thiago, kissing Antonella Roccuzzo's stomach with the message: ""Can't wait to welcome you into our world!!! We love you! Thiagui, mum and dad."" Local press in Argentina had been speculating about Messi's future fatherhood since February with newspaper Clarin saying the couple already knew they were due to have a baby boy who would be named Benjamin. Messi and Roccuzzo's first son was born in November 2012."
1292,29/04/2015,00:28,"Bayern's Lewandowski, Robben doubtful for Barca","Bayern Munich's top scorers Robert Lewandowski and Arjen Robben are doubtful for next Wednesday's Champions League semi-final, first-leg, against Barcelona after suffering injuries in the newly-crowned German champions German Cup defeat.","Bayern were knocked out of the Cup on Tuesday -- ending their hopes of a second treble in three seasons -- after losing the penalty shoot-out 2-0 to Borussia Dortmund as the semi-final finished 1-1 after extra-time. Lewandowski, who has scored 22 goals this season, was taken to hospital after suffering a knock to the head following a goal-mouth collision with Dortmund's Australia goalkeeper Mitchell Langerak late in extra time. ""He's gone to hospital, I don't know how serious the injury is or if he can play against Barcelona,"" said Bayern coach Pep Guardiola. Robben, who has netted 19 goals this season, lasted just 16 minutes on his second-half come-back after a month out with torn stomach muscles and limped off with a calf injury. ""He's injured too,"" confirmed Guardiola, with more details expected on Wednesday. Bayern's attacking midfielder Thiago Alcantara is also facing a race to be fit to play against his former club Barcelona having come off with a knock to the leg. The 24-year-old has only recently returned after more than a year out with back-to-back knee injuries."
1293,29/04/2015,00:06,"Messi, Suarez, Neymar hit century mark in Barca rout","Barcelona's star front three of Lionel Messi, Luis Suarez and Neymar brought up a century of goals in all competitions as the Catalans moved five points clear at the top of La Liga with a 6-0 humbling of Getafe on Tuesday.","All three were on target inside 28 minutes as Messi opened the scoring from the penalty spot before teeing up Suarez to volley home and Neymar was left with the simple task of registering the 100th goal between the trio from Suarez's pass. Xavi Hernandez then curled home a stunning fourth before Suarez made it 5-0 with a similar finish into the far corner and Messi rounded off the scoring in typical style on his favoured left foot early in the second-half. Real Madrid can close the gap at the top back to two points when they host Almeria on Wednesday. ""Luckily the first shots on goal we had went in, the team played very well in the first-half and that is the most important thing,"" said Suarez. ""I don't know if there is a key to our success. There is total commitment among the team and the fans. We are obliged to win important things and we are entering the most important stage of the season."" Barca boss Luis Enrique had resisted the temptation to rest any of his front three despite making four changes from the side that won 2-0 at Espanyol on Saturday with one eye on next week's Champions League semi-final, first-leg against Bayern Munich. That decision was richly rewarded in a stunning first-half display that tore the helpless visitors to shreds. Messi put his recent yips from the penalty spot behind him as he opened the scoring by chipping the ball straight down the middle of the goal in the style made famous by Czech legend Antonin Panenka in the 1976 European Championships after Suarez had been felled by Alvaro Arroyo. Getafe nearly drew level moments later when Claudio Bravo made a brilliant recovery save to claw Fredy Hinestroza's lob to safety to make up for his original poor positioning. Suarez put the result beyond doubt with a sumptuous volley from Messi's inviting cross and the Uruguayan then turned provider for Neymar to bring up the century. Moments later Xavi scored what could well be his final goal at the Camp Nou with the veteran expected to move to Qatar at the end of the season by curling the ball high into the far corner. Xavi's flick then set up Suarez to finish in similar style to register his 21st goal of the season before the break. Despite the upcoming date with former coach Pep Guardiola and Bayern in eight days time there was little let up from the hosts after the break. However, the goals did dry up after Messi had curled home his 38th league goal of the campaign to move within one of Cristiano Ronaldo in the race to be La Liga's top goalscorer two minutes into the second period. The four-time World Player of the Year came close to a seventh hat-trick of the season six minutes from time, but Vicente Guaita made a fine save to turn his free-kick to safety. Elsewhere, David Moyes's Real Sociedad salvaged a point in the Basque derby away to Athletic Bilbao despite playing most of the second-half with 10 men. Aritz Aduriz put the hosts ahead from the penalty spot after he had been brought down inside the area by Mike Gonzalez, who saw red for denying a clear goalscoring opportunity. But a wonderful finish from left-back Alberto de la Bella on his weaker right foot seven minutes later earned Sociedad a point. At the bottom, Levante moved six points clear of the relegation zone with a 1-0 win over the doomed Cordoba thanks to David Barral's first-half winner."
1294,28/04/2015,23:37,Barca front three 'unstoppable' - Luis Enrique,"Barcelona boss Luis Enrique believes his side is impossible to contain when their star attacking trio of Lionel Messi, Luis Suarez and Neymar are as efficient in front of goal as they were in Tuesday's 6-0 hammering of Getafe.","The three now have a combined 102 goals between them in all competitions this season after Messi and Suarez each scored twice, whilst Neymar and Xavi also found the net to move the Catalans five points clear of Real Madrid at the top of La Liga. ""It is another day to congratulate the team because these types of games can easily become difficult and we needed to start in the way we did today. ""Today there were many of the circumstances that make the team practically unstoppable. ""We had a number of chances and almost all the goals are placed right in the corner. ""I don't remember a Barca match or that of another team with the effectiveness in front of goal we showed today. There were so many goals with such precision."" Madrid can move back to within two points of the Catalans with victory over Almeria on Wednesday. However, Los Blancos are powerless to stop Barca claiming a fifth title in seven years should they win their remaining four games against Cordoba, Real Sociedad, Atletico Madrid and Deportivo la Coruna. And Enrique again insisted complacency won't affect his side despite having on paper an easier run-in that Madrid, who are still to face Sevilla and Valencia. ""We won't get complacent, we know that we depend on ourselves against a great rival like Real Madrid that will fight for the title until the end. We need to continue so that things continue to go as they have done until now and be very concentrated. ""I believe in Barca, which is the only thing I can control. It is normal that I also believe in Madrid's opponents. ""I think the final games of the season will be demanding for everyone and there could be surprises."""

1297,24/04/2015,13:57,Five Champions League semi-final facts,Five Champions League semi-final facts after Friday's draw paired holders Real Madrid with Juventus and Pep Guardiola's Bayern Munich with his old club Barcelona:,"- While Guardiola will be coming up against his old side, Real Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti will also face one of his former clubs in Juventus. He was in charge of the Bianconeri between 1999 and 2001 but finished as a runner-up in Serie A in his two seasons there, first to Lazio and then to Roma. - Real Madrid took four points off Juventus in the group stage of last season's Champions League and beat the Turin side 1-0 in the 1998 final in Amsterdam thanks to a goal by Predrag Mijatovic. However, the Spanish giants have not won a two-legged tie against Italian opposition since beating Napoli in the European Cup first round in 1987. - The draw keeps alive the possibility of a first 'clasico' final between Real Madrid and Barcelona. Indeed, the draw means that whoever meets in the final in Berlin will be clashing at that stage of the competition for the first time ever. - Barcelona's 4-0 defeat to Bayern in Munich in the first leg of the 2013 semi-finals is their biggest defeat in the Champions League. Similarly, Bayern's biggest loss in the competition remains a 4-0 loss to Guardiola's Barcelona in the first leg of the quarter-finals in 2009. Survivors from the Barca side that day six years ago are Gerard Pique, Xavi Hernandez, Andres Iniesta, Daniel Alves, Sergio Busquets and Lionel Messi, who scored twice. Franck Ribery and Bastian Schweinsteiger both played for Bayern. - The clash between Barcelona and Bayern will also be a family affair. Twenty-four-year-old Spain midfielder Thiago Alcantara, who left Barca for Bayern in 2013, will take on his younger brother Rafinha."
1298,24/04/2015,13:49,Guardiola to return to Barcelona in Champions League semis,Pep Guardiola will return to face his former club Barcelona after the draw for the Champions League semi-finals on Friday paired the Catalans with Bayern Munich while holders Real Madrid were drawn against Juventus.,"Barcelona, who are in the last four for the seventh time in eight seasons, will be at home to the Bundesliga side in the first leg on May 6 with the return at the Allianz Arena on May 12. Guardiola won the European Cup as a player with Barcelona in 1992 and then won 14 trophies in four seasons as coach, including the Champions League in 2009 and 2011. He had made way for Tito Vilanova by the time Barca were destroyed 7-0 on aggregate by Bayern in the semi-finals in 2013, when the German giants went on to win the trophy. ""When you play in the semi-finals, you always get a big team. I have great respect for them and I am very, very happy to have had this experience in my life, but at the end of the day it's a football match,"" said Guardiola. ""Of course it is special for me and very, very emotional, whether it is one game or two."" ""Of course, only football can write stories like this,"" remarked Bayern's sporting director Matthias Sammer. ""We know we'll be facing a good opponent. It's a great situation to be in and I'm looking forward to it hugely."" After leaving in 2012, Guardiola did not go back to the Camp Nou until he attended Barcelona's victory over Manchester City in the last 16 last month. His old side are now coached by Luis Enrique, alongside whom he played at Barcelona in the 1990s. ""It is a special game because Pep is on the other side. It will be the first time that he has faced his Barca, it will be the first time that I have faced him as a coach which will be special for me, and I am sure it will be for my players,"" said Luis Enrique, who did not seem too concerned about having to play the first leg at home. ""We have played 10 games in the Champions League, and we have won nine and lost one, playing both home and away."" Meanwhile, Madrid go to Italy for the first leg of their tie against Serie A leaders Juventus on May 5 as they look to become the first club to retain the trophy in the Champions League era. The tie is a repeat of the 1998 final, which Madrid won 1-0 in Amsterdam, and the Spanish side will be fancied to come out on top on this occasion too. ""We will face a legendary club, I think it is good news for football and the Champions League that Juventus have returned to this level and obviously it will be a very even tie,"" said former Real player Emilio Butragueno, now the club's Director of Institutional Relations. ""We faced them last year, they are a very competitive team and hopefully we can recover the injured players to be able to face this tie at our maximum level."" The 10-time European champions beat city rivals Atletico Madrid in a tense quarter-final despite being without the injured Luka Modric, Gareth Bale and Karim Benzema, although coach Carlo Ancelotti is confident that at least the latter two will be fit for the semi-finals. Italian Ancelotti played in the last team to win the European Cup in successive seasons, the AC Milan side of 1989 and 1990, and coached Juventus between 1999 and 2001. Juventus, who will go to the Santiago Bernabeu for the return on May 13, are through to their first Champions League semi-final since losing on penalties to Ancelotti's Milan in the 2003 final. They are the outsiders in the last four, with Barcelona, Bayern and Madrid having racked up 13 semi-final appearances between them in the last six seasons and having won the Champions League four times between them over the same period. However, they beat the then-holders Madrid in the semi-finals in 2003, and former player Pavel Nedved, now an ambassador for the club, said: ""This reminds me of something. ""They are monsters. We are happy to be competing with these three teams, who are the best sides in the world. I have great confidence in the team."" This year's final will be played in Berlin on Saturday, June 6."

However, Blanc used the example of Barca, who won the first of their four European Cups in 1992, 93 years after they were formed. ""We need to have patience to win the Champions League.

The only previous time came during Pep Guardiola's first season in charge and Enrique's friend could be the man standing in his way of repeating that achievement after Bayern Munich romped back from a 3-1 first leg deficit to hammer Porto 6-1 and also reach the last four. ""I am very happy that Guardiola has gone through because I like when good things happen to my friends. ""There were a lot of people that wrote them off and the fact that they scored six with a lot of players out says everything about Guardiola as a coach and Bayern as a team. ""We will see what the draw on Friday brings."" And Enrique dismissed suggestions Barca had at least met the minimum requirement expected of them by reaching the semi-finals once more. ""There are no limits on our ambition seeing the players I have and the work they have done since the start of the season in a special year for the club given all the changes that have taken place. ""It wouldn't be logical for us to have a minimum objective, that doesn't mean anything. The objective is to be better than our next opponent and deserve on the field to reach the final."""

""We will see what the draw on Friday brings."" And Enrique dismissed suggestions Barca had at least met the minimum requirement expected of them by reaching the semi-finals once more. ""There are no limits on our ambition seeing the players I have and the work they have done since the start of the season in a special year for the club given all the changes that have taken place. ""It wouldn't be logical for us to have a minimum objective, that doesn't mean anything. The objective is to be better than our next opponent and deserve on the field to reach the final."""
1302,21/04/2015,22:42,Neymar double eases Barcelona past poor PSG,Barcelona cruised into their seventh Champions League semi-final in eight years as a double from Neymar handed them to a 2-0 win over Paris Saint-Germain to seal a 5-1 aggregate victory on Tuesday.,"Just as in last week's first leg in Paris, the Brazilian opened the scoring after a sensational assist from Andres Iniesta. Neymar then capitalised on some shoddy defending to head home his 30th goal of the season from Dani Alves's cross. Barca will now take their place alongside Bayern Munich in Friday's draw for the last four, the ties to be played next month. Only once in European Cup history had a side come back from losing the first leg at home 3-1 and there was little doubt about the outcome as Barca dominated proceedings from the off. The opener arrived on 14 minutes as Iniesta collected the ball inside his own half, spun past three PSG challenges and then rolled the ball through to Neymar, who calmly rounded Salvatore Sirigu before slotting home. PSG briefly threatened to respond as Zlatan Ibrahimovic had a goal rightly ruled out for offside against his old club on his return to the side from suspension. However, Barca were soon back in command as Lionel Messi fired just over from Luis Suarez's knockdown before Sirigu was forced into a flying save to turn away Alves's powerful drive before clutching Neymar's follow-up effort. There was nothing the Italian could do 12 minutes before the break, though, as he was exposed by more shocking defending from the French champions as Alves was given plenty of time to pick out his compatriot and the unmarked Neymar powered a header into the bottom corner for his fifth goal in four games against PSG this season. Barca boss Luis Enrique could afford the luxury of withdrawing Iniesta and Sergio Busquets at the start of the second period for Xavi and Sergi Roberto respectively with one eye on Saturday's Catalan derby away to Espanyol. With the hosts taking their foot off the gas, PSG did at least have the chance to add some respectability to the scoreline, but unlike Barca's star front three of Messi, Suarez and Neymar, who now have 95 goals between them this season, they were wasteful in front of goal. Marco Verratti passed up the best chance when he pulled his shot wide when well-placed at the edge of the area, whilst Ter Stegen did well to repel Ibrahimovic's piledriver 18 minutes from time. Messi had one final chance to move ahead of Cristiano Ronaldo as the leading scorer in Champions League history, but the Argentine's goal drought in the competition stretched into four games as his shot flashed just wide."
1303,20/04/2015,19:43,Blanc realistic over Barca challenge,"Paris Saint-Germain coach Laurent Blanc admitted he is realistic about the size of the task facing his side as they attempt to overturn a 3-1 Champions League quarter-final, first leg deficit away at Barcelona on Tuesday.","The French champions were torn apart by Barca's star front three of Luis Suarez, Neymar and Lionel Messi at the Parc des Princes last week, just as they were when they last visited the Camp Nou in the group stages in December. And while Blanc is confident PSG can pose the Barca defence problems, he believes stopping the South American trio is an almost impossible task. ""I'm fairly realistic. Yes we believe we can do it, but like you, we know that it is extremely difficult,"" he said on Monday. ""We can say that we have nothing to lose. I think we will have the opportunity to score, but the big problem is that we can't concede and against Barcelona that is almost impossible. ""We must defend well, we say that every time we play them, but we have conceded in every game because they have incredible offensive players. ""I hope we can show we are better than what we showed in the first leg."" The visitors will at least be boosted by the return of their own top scorer as former Barca striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic returns from suspension. ""He will have a big impact. He is a player I have never doubted,"" added Blanc. ""He loves these type of matches, so he will help us. It is always better to have very good players and goalscorers, as we saw in the first leg."" Marco Verratti also returns from a ban to take his place in midfield, but Thiago Silva and Thiago Motta both miss out due to injury. And midfielder Javier Pastore is hoping Ibrahimovic and Verratti's presence can prove the difference from one week to the next. ""It will be a very difficult game, but the only good thing is that we don't have anything to lose. We come into the game with a negative result, but we have added two fundamental players to the team and they will give us a lot. ""We believe because that is our job and football is a game in which you have the possibility to win or lose. For our fans and ourselves we need to play very well and win the game."" However, the Argentine international dismissed French legend Eric Cantona's recent comments that he and not his compatriot Messi, who scored his 400th Barcelona goal at the weekend, is the best player in the world. ""Everyone has their opinion and I thank him publicly for what he said, but I don't believe the same. ""I think he likes good football and not just goals, but the stats of Messi and (Cristiano) Ronaldo are incredible, unattainable numbers."""
1304,20/04/2015,14:27,"PSG tie not over, claims Suarez",Barcelona striker Luis Suarez insists his side can't relax when they host Paris Saint-Germain in the second-leg of their Champions League quarter-final on Tuesday despite holding a commanding 3-1 lead in the tie.,"Suarez was the orchestrator of the French champions' downfall in the first-leg at the Parc des Princes with two sensational individual goals to put Barca on the brink of a seventh semi-final in eight seasons. However, the Uruguayan demanded the same level of intensity and concentration from his side to ensure PSG are given no encouragement at the Camp Nou. ""Nothing is done. We are aware that they have great players and we need to start with the same intensity that we did last week,"" he said on Monday. Suarez was also on target after less than a minute in a vital 2-0 win over Valencia to register his 12th goal in as many games, but was replaced by Pedro Rodriguez midway through the second-half. He was taken off to keep him fresh with Barca embroiled in a bid to win the treble of La Liga, Champions League and Copa del Rey for just the second time in their history. ""We are sportsmen but we also get tired like any other person,"" added the former Liverpool striker. ""We need to live with that tiredness in the best way possible. We need to eat well and rest, but I prefer to have a lot of games at this stage of the season than none."" Suarez took time to get going in his new surroundings earlier in the season after Barca paid a club record fee to bring him to Catalonia. The 28-year-old missed the first two months of the campaign as he completed a four-month ban for biting Giorgio Chiellini at the World Cup, but claimed he never felt the pressure of his price tag. ""I never thought about the fact I cost a lot of money because it would be very difficult. I am self-critical and I know when I am playing well or badly. ""There was a moment when I didn't feel good, but I had my family and my teammates always supporting me and a coach that kept playing me."" Suarez's streak was overshadowed at the weekend as Lionel Messi reached another incredible milestone as he scored his 400th Barcelona goal in just 471 games. And Barca boss Luis Enrique believes that is a figure that will not be bettered in Barca colours. ""Leo is in the best condition possible, he is in good form and 400 goals is a figure that more than impossible to achieve, it is impossible to imagine another player reaching. They are unique and unrepeatable numbers."" Barca's treble push has been built on a run of 22 wins and a draw in their last 24 games and Enrique is not content to just settle for progress to the last four on Tuesday. ""I always think positively and the objective is to go through, but I understand that is easier with the result we have. ""A victory against an opponent of this level is always well-earned. There were moments when we played very well and moments when we suffered, but I am not akin to settling for results that aren't victories."""
1305,20/04/2015,12:40,Iniesta cleared to face PSG,Barcelona midfielder Andres Iniesta has been given the all clear to face French champions Paris Saint-Germain in the second-leg of their Champions League quarter-final on Tuesday.,"The Spanish international suffered heavy bruising on his back during Barca's 3-1 first-leg win in Paris last week and missed the Catalans 2-0 victory over Valencia on Saturday as a result. ""Andres Iniesta has received the medical all clear,"" Barcelona said in a statement on Monday. ""The Barca number eight is available to Luis Enrique now that he has recovered from the heavy bruising on the sacroiliac joint he suffered away at PSG."""
1306,20/04/2015,02:20,Barcelona keen to show PSG no mercy,Barcelona defender Dani Alves has warned his side against complacency when they host a Paris Saint-Germain side bolstered by the return of key personnel through suspension to the Camp Nou on Tuesday.,"Two goals from Luis Suarez took Barca to the brink of a seventh Champions League semi-final in eight seasons as they romped to a 3-1 win in the first-leg of the quarter-final tie in Paris last week. However, a late own goal from Jeremy Mathieu offered the French champions a glimmer of hope as they welcome back top-scorer Zlatan Ibrahimovic and midfield maestro Marco Verratti. ""We will not speculate with the result because we don't know how to,"" Alves, who has been linked with a move to PSG come the end of the season, told Barca's website. ""The philosophy and the spirit of the team is to challenge for every ball as if it was the last. ""We cannot think about our advantage, but just control the game and look to score from the first minute. That is the only way to overcome PSG."" Barca remained on course for a treble of La Liga, Copa del Rey and Champions League with a hard-fought 2-0 win over Valencia on Saturday thanks to goals in the first and last minute from Suarez and Lionel Messi, who registered his 400th goal for the club. And Luis Enrique's men will also have key players back available as Alves returns after he too missed the first-leg through suspension, whilst Andres Iniesta is expected to overcome the back bruising he suffered at the Parc des Princes in time to feature. It would take a remarkable turnaround for PSG to progress to the semi-finals for the first time since 1995 as Barca haven't lost at home by more than one goal for nearly two years, when Bayern Munich rounded off a historic 7-0 aggregate thrashing of the Catalans with a 3-0 victory at the Camp Nou. However, domestically things have been far easier for PSG in recent weeks as two goals from Javier Pastore kept them a point clear of Lyon at the top of the table in a 3-1 win at Nice. David Luiz played the full 90 minutes despite his horror show when he was nutmegged twice by Suarez in the build-up to the Uruguayan's goals and insisted that he is not feeling the after-effects of a hamstring problem that was originally expected to keep him out of both legs of the tie. ""I do not feel any pain , I just feel tired after that match,"" said the Brazilian. ""In Barcelona we will do all we can. Of course we must still believe."" However, teammate Blaise Matuidi admitted they will have to defend an awful lot better against Barca's star front three of Messi, Suarez and Neymar to stand any chance. ""We must above all go without any complex and try everything to achieve what would be an amazing feat. ""We will be keen to show something different from the first-leg and primarily defend well because that's what we missed at the Parc des Princes."" PSG captain Thiago Silva has been included in the squad despite limping off with a thigh injury early on in the first leg, but Thiago Motta and Serge Aurier miss out through injury and suspension respectively."
1307,18/04/2015,20:51,Scrappy win huge boost for Barca - Luis Enrique,Barcelona boss Luis Enrique hailed his players efforts despite a far from convincing display in a 2-0 win over Valencia on Saturday.,"Goals in the first minute from Luis Suarez and last minute from Lionel Messi, his 400th for the club, bookended a match in which Valencia enjoyed the majority of the chances and were left to rue Dani Parejo's missed penalty in the first-half. However, Enrique was quick to highlight the merit in Barca ending Valencia's 10-game unbeaten run in La Liga just four days after all but sealing their place in the Champions League quarter-finals with a 3-1 victory away to Paris Saint-Germain. ""It is a great result and a day to congratulate the players, who gave everything, and the fans who were immense,"" said Enrique. ""It was a complete day, we did the job and now the pressure is on others. Barca come out of the game greatly strengthened."" Seeing Paco Alcacer miss a hat-trick of good chances on top of Parejo's missed penalty, Enrique introduced Ivan Rakitic for Adriano at half-time in a tactical rejig that restricted the visitors to far fewer chances after the break. ""It was a different game to all those we have played at the Camp Nou. We had a marvellous start with the goal, and then we had a lot of problems overcoming their pressing. ""We committed errors that we don't normally and they had a lot of chances and deserved a bit more. ""In the second-half we made a change because Adriano had a yellow card and it went well, the game was more like what we wanted."" Valencia boss Nuno Espirito Santo, meanwhile, was left to reflect on what might have been after dominating the first 45 minutes. ""We played very well in the first-half and had a lot of good chances,"" he said. ""We go away hurt, sad and angry because we wanted to win. In the first-half we had too many chances to end up with this result."" Defeat leaves Valencia now four points adrift of third-placed Atletico Madrid and just three ahead of Sevilla, who play their game in hand against Granada on Sunday. ""We are proud but not satisfied because playing so well doesn't mean anything when you lose. ""We have an important objective but we need to keep picking up points."""
1308,16/04/2015,06:13,Enrique delight at 'complete' Barcelona,"Barcelona coach Luis Enrique admitted he could scarcely have hoped for a better performance after his side blew away Paris Saint-Germain with a 3-1 victory in the first leg of their Champions League quarter-final on Wednesday. The Spanish league leaders ended PSG's 33-game unbeaten home run in Europe stretching back to 2006 as Neymar opened the scoring in the first half at the Parc des Princes before Luis Suarez added a superb double in the second half. ""We were superior in midfield, were dangerous going forward and defended well as a team. It was a very complete performance from us,"" said Enrique. ""I would be happier if we hadn't conceded the goal, but I wouldn't change our game tonight, even if a 3-0 would have been perfect.""",
1309,15/04/2015,23:46,Barcelona confident Iniesta injury nothing serious,Barcelona coach Luis Enrique is hopeful the injury that forced captain Andres Iniesta off in the second half of Wednesday's Champions League quarter-final first leg against Paris Saint-Germain is nothing serious.,"""Andres took what looks like a very hard blow. We will wait to see what the doctors in Barcelona say but it doesn't seem to be anything too serious,"" said the coach after the game, which the Catalans won 3-1 thanks to a Neymar strike and a Luis Suarez brace. Iniesta was stretchered off early in the second half and replaced by Xavi Hernandez after appearing to be struck hard in the lower back by the knee of PSG's Javier Pastore just outside his own penalty area. The second leg will be played at the Camp Nou next Tuesday, April 21."
1310,15/04/2015,22:46,Messi and Barcelona blow PSG away,"Luis Suarez hit a brilliant second-half double as Barcelona appeared to end Paris Saint-Germain's Champions League dream for another year with a 3-1 quarter-final, first leg win at the Parc des Princes on Wednesday.","The visitors' all-star attack made their class count as Neymar coolly converted from a Lionel Messi assist in the 18th minute to put Luis Enrique's men in control, before Suarez produced two classy finishes in the final quarter of the game. PSG got one back eight minutes from time thanks to a deflected Gregory van der Wiel strike, but this was their first home defeat of the season and a first loss at home in Europe in 34 matches since 2006. Next Tuesday's second leg at the Camp Nou now looks set to be a formality, even if PSG will have their talisman Zlatan Ibrahimovic and midfield maestro Marco Verratti back from suspension by then. The French champions have been eliminated on away goals at this stage of the competition in each of the last two seasons, including against Barca in 2013, but they will do well to even make it that close on this occasion. And their evening was further marred by the loss of captain Thiago Silva, who hobbled off just after Neymar's opener with an apparent thigh problem. A dejected Silva walked straight off the field to have his left thigh bandaged up, not even waiting until his fellow-Brazilian David Luiz was ready to take his place. The former Chelsea stopper was a surprise inclusion in the squad after travelling to Russia to undergo treatment on a hamstring injury that was expected to sideline him for around three more weeks. But even with Silva on the field, Paris looked uncomfortable against the Barcelona attack. The match was only 14 minutes old when Suarez found Messi on the edge of the area, the Argentine controlling the ball and curling a wicked shot off the left post before it rebounded out to safety. Messi, who has scored 45 goals in all competitions this season, provided a 25th assist soon after, sliding a pass into the path of Neymar, who finished across Salvatore Sirigu with the PSG defence posted missing after Adrien Rabiot lost possession on the right wing. After crashing into Messi in the lead-up to that goal, Silva hobbled off, and Luiz had taken his place in time to see Neymar cut into the box and send in a shot that Sirigu, this time, saved comfortably. It took 35 minutes for PSG to force Marc-Andre ter Stegen in the Barcelona goal into a save, and even then it was an easy catch as Edinson Cavani hooked a Maxwell cross on target. There was a further scare for the hosts as Sirigu came up clutching his left arm after falling awkwardly while saving a Suarez shot, but the Italian goalkeeper was able to carry on. PSG had a greater purpose about them at the start of the second half, and both Javier Pastore and Rabiot forced saves from ter Stegen, before Barcelona were dealt an injury blow of their own as captain Andres Iniesta had to be stretchered off after taking a knee in the lower back from Pastore. However, Barcelona again undid the PSG defence midway through the second half, Suarez eliminating Luiz and Marquinhos as he cut into the area from the right before holding off Maxwell and prodding past the despairing Sirigu at his near post. Ter Stegen blocked a thunderous Cavani shot before the classy Suarez struck again on 79 minutes, playing a quick one-two with Javier Mascherano and nutmegging the hapless Luiz before lashing a shot high into the top-right corner. That appeared to be that, although PSG were given the smallest glimmer of hope when a Van der Wiel volley from outside the area beat ter Stegen with the aid of a decisive touch off substitute Jeremy Mathieu."
1311,15/04/2015,18:00,"Barcelona, Chelsea, Man Utd set for US games","European heavyweights Barcelona, Chelsea and Manchester United will take part in this year's International Champions Cup friendly tournament in the United States, organisers announced on Wednesday.","The 10-team line-up for the competition, won by United in 2014, also features Paris Saint-Germain, Porto, Fiorentina, Mexico's Club America, New York Red Bulls, Los Angeles Galaxy and San Jose Earthquakes. The format for the tournament and the match venues have not yet been announced, but it will take place between July 11 and August 5, prior to the start of the 2015-16 European season. Last year, United played Real Madrid in the International Champions Cup in front of a record crowd of over 109,000 in Michigan, illustrating the growing popularity of European teams in the US. ""Manchester United made history in its last visit to the United States by breaking the country's soccer attendance record and the huge level of support for the club was evident in every city we visited,"" said United managing director Richard Arnold in a statement. ""This tour will not only provide the team with first-rate preparation for the season ahead, it will also allow many of United's eight million US followers to get closer to the club they love."" Meanwhile, English side Tottenham Hotspur have announced that they will play the Major League Soccer All-Stars in a one-off friendly match in Denver on July 29. ""We'd like to thank Major League Soccer for the invitation to take part in the 2015 All-Star Game,"" Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino said in a press release.

1312,14/04/2015,19:27,Barca coach dismisses talk of Neymar 'controversy',Barcelona coach Luis Enrique gave short shrift to questions about Neymar on the eve of his side's Champions League quarter-final with Paris Saint-Germain after the Brazilian reacted angrily to being substituted at the weekend.,"Neymar scored in Barcelona's game at Sevilla in La Liga on Saturday but was taken off to make way for Xavi Hernandez in the second half of a match which ended in a 2-2 draw. He responded by making a series of frustrated hand gestures before removing a boot and angrily throwing it to the floor. His coach was repeatedly asked for his view of the attitude shown by one of his superstars, but said that he could understand his unhappiness. ""As coach I understand and know that all players want to be on the pitch, all without exception. But the players all need to understand that I make the decisions,"" he said at a press conference on the eve of Wednesday's game at the Parc des Princes. Luis Enrique refused to confirm whether Neymar, who scored in both meetings with PSG during the group stage of this season's Champions League, would start the match in the French capital. ""I have brought almost all my players. Tomorrow I will decide,"" said the 44-year-old former Barcelona midfielder. When further pressed about the incident, which has been whipped up into a controversy by elements of the Spanish media, he replied: ""The 14th of April is my mum's birthday. Happy birthday Mum."" German goalkeeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen, who has been used as a back-up to Claudio Bravo in La Liga this season, is once again set to get the nod in Europe. He understands better than most of his team-mates the frustration of being benched and said: ""Nobody is happy when they have to go out of the match. ""It is just as important that the team is in good form and everyone has to accept it. He will manage it, he is old enough."" Barcelona are without Dani Alves due to suspension, but otherwise are at full strength for the game as the sides meet in the quarter-finals for the second time in three seasons."
1313,14/04/2015,16:05,Blanc looks to draw lessons from past Barcelona clashes,Memories of their agonising Champions League exits in the last two seasons will spur Paris Saint-Germain on when they host Barcelona in the first leg of their quarter-final on Wednesday.,"The clubs meet at the Parc des Princes with the French champions desperate to make it to the last four after losing to Barcelona and Chelsea in the quarter-finals in each of the last two seasons, both times on away goals. But their 3-2 win against the Catalans in Paris in the group stage, and the character they showed to beat Chelsea on away goals in the last 16, despite the sending-off of Zlatan Ibrahimovic in the first half at Stamford Bridge, suggest they have what it takes to make the leap forward this time. ""Beating Chelsea, in a stadium where it is very difficult to get a result, showed that we have the quality, so why not do it again,"" said former Barcelona defender Maxwell at an eve-of-game press conference at the Parc des Princes on Tuesday. The Brazilian talked of reaching the semi-finals as a ""dream"", but he and his team-mates must work out how to avoid conceding a potentially crucial away goal against the potent Barcelona front three of Lionel Messi, Neymar and Luis Suarez. Asked if the thrilling win against the Catalans last September could be used as a reference point, PSG coach Laurent Blanc responded: ""It is one of many games we have looked at to prepare this match. ""We have looked at what we need to do and what we need to avoid doing. We can draw lessons from that game, because we won it and are one of the only sides in Europe to have scored three goals against Barcelona. ""But there are things we need to make sure we don't do, like concede an away goal, especially going away from home in the second leg. ""Lots of teams play Barcelona with the aim of not conceding, but they are a team who can play anywhere in Europe and score goals with the players they have. ""One of the goals they scored here was like something out of the Playstation."" The goal in question was scored by Messi, while Neymar was also on target, but PSG claimed the three points that night thanks to strikes from David Luiz, Marco Verratti and Blaise Matuidi. Barcelona claimed revenge, and top spot in Group F, by winning 3-1 at the Camp Nou in December, with Messi, Neymar and Suarez all scoring after Ibrahimovic had put the visitors ahead. While Ibrahimovic is suspended this time, Blanc is faced with the conundrum of how to stop Messi, who scored his 45th goal of the season in Saturday's 2-2 draw at Sevilla. ""People say that, when he only scores 40 goals, he has something wrong with him,"" said Blanc. ""Putting a man marker on him would be the best thing for him and also the best way for us to have a player sent off."" As well as Ibrahimovic, the home side will be without the banned Verratti and the injured David Luiz. Blanc confirmed that Lucas will be involved following his return from two months out in Saturday's League Cup final win against Bastia, but he played down the chances of seeing Thiago Motta make the team despite confirming that his hamstring injury, suffered against Marseille on April 5, is not as bad as was feared. ""Motta has started running again, which is great news because after Marseille a lot of people thought it was serious. Nevertheless we will need a little miracle for him to start the game tomorrow."""
1314,14/04/2015,02:10,"Without Ibrahimovic, PSG renew Barcelona rivalry","Diminished by injuries and suspensions, Paris Saint-Germain renew hostilities with Barcelona on Wednesday as the sides clash at the Parc des Princes in the first leg of their Champions League quarter-final.","PSG have been eliminated in the last eight on away goals in each of the last two seasons, including losing to Barcelona in 2013. As they look to finally make it back to the semi-finals of Europe's elite club competition for the first time in 20 years, the side from the French capital could hardly be in better form. A point clear at the top of Ligue 1, they are on course to win an unprecedented clean sweep of the domestic honours after mercilessly crushing Bastia 4-0 in the final of the League Cup at the weekend. Zlatan Ibrahimovic scored twice in that game, having netted a hat-trick in last midweek's 4-1 French Cup semi-final defeat of Saint-Etienne to reach a century of goals for the club. The Swede has scored 13 times in his last seven matches for club and country, but he will miss the meeting with one of his former clubs due to suspension after being sent off in the second leg of the last-16 win over Chelsea last month. Ibrahimovic is also about to begin a four-game domestic ban, so PSG must get used to being without their talisman, who has 28 goals in total this season. ""He was good, very good,"" said Blanc of Ibrahimovic's display in the League Cup final. ""His objective now is the second leg against Barcelona in 10 days. He will get some rest."" Blanc must also do without Marco Verratti due to suspension, while David Luiz and Thiago Motta have hamstring injuries, although the return to fitness of the likes of Yohan Cabaye and Lucas does provide some consolation. In any case, the absence of Ibrahimovic may not prove as crucial as it appears at first glance. After all, he was injured when Paris beat Barcelona 3-2 at the Parc des Princes in a thrilling group-stage game in September. He was back by the time the sides met at the Camp Nou in December and even scored in that game, but could not prevent Barcelona winning 3-1 on the night. And it was with 10 men following the Swede's sending-off that the French champions rallied to eliminate Chelsea on away goals on a remarkable evening at Stamford Bridge. That game felt like something of a coming of age for PSG in Europe, but the test that awaits them against Barcelona cannot be underestimated, even if they are unbeaten in 33 European home games stretching back almost nine years. ""It will be very difficult but it could be extraordinary,"" reasoned midfielder Blaise Matuidi. ""We have already shown that we can compete against them and even beat them. We will need to be at 150 percent, even with all the absences. We will give everything."" In contrast to their hosts, Barcelona come into their eighth consecutive quarter-final in the competition with only one notable player missing in the shape of right-back Dani Alves, who is suspended. Luis Enrique's side are top of La Liga but not everything is rosy for the Catalans just now after they threw away a two-goal lead to draw 2-2 with Sevilla on Saturday, despite a 45th goal of the season for Lionel Messi. Neymar also scored in that game but could not hide his disgust later on when he was substituted and the Brazilian will now be eager to get back on the field against PSG after netting in both meetings between the sides in the group stage. ""We must make as few mistakes as possible and not concede,"" warned another of Barcelona's Brazilians, Adriano. ""They have quality players who need only the slightest opportunity to score goals. They are very dangerous on the break."""
1315,13/04/2015,20:37,I tried to forget last year's troubles - Messi,Four-time World Player of the Year Lionel Messi has admitted that he struggled to overcome injuries in Barcelona's first trophyless campaign for six years last season.,"As well as the disappointment at club level, Messi suffered the devastation of losing the World Cup final with Argentina and saw Cristiano Ronaldo oust him to win the World Player of the Year for a second consecutive year. ""Last season, I had an inconsistent season. I was out for a long time with injuries and I missed a lot of games,"" Messi told Barcelona's website. ""When I returned to playing I didn't feel good. It was a year I have tried to forget quickly to get back to my best with the effort, work and joy with which I have always had and thankfully now I feel very good."" Messi has stormed back to form since this season with 45 goals in 44 games to put Barca in position for just the second treble in the club's history. Luis Enrique's men lead Real Madrid in La Liga by two points with seven games to play, face Athletic Bilbao in the Copa del Rey final and travel to Paris Saint-Germain for the first-leg of their Champions League quarter-final on Wednesday. ""We went through times that we won everything, every year we would win a title and sometimes the fans and us didn't value what we were doing,"" Messi added. ""We had a bad year when we didn't win anything and now, when the success comes, we give it the importance it deserves and we enjoy it more because we know how difficult it is to achieve."" The one area of Messi's game that has let him down in recent months has been from the penalty spot as the 27-year-old has missed five of his last 11 spot-kicks, including against Manchester City in the last 16 of the Champions League. ""It angers me. Both with Barca and the Argentine national team I am the penalty taker and the goalkeepers study you and know you better every time. ""It is true that a well-taken penalty is very difficult to save, but at the moment it is more difficult for me when I'm taking penalties. ""These things happen in football, but I do get very annoyed when I miss, like against Manchester City when the goal would have given us a much bigger advantage."""
1316,11/04/2015,23:39,Barca paid for errors - Luis Enrique,Barcelona coach Luis Enrique lamented the defensive errors made by his side as they blew a two goal lead to draw 2-2 away at Sevilla on Saturday.,"The Catalans looked well set for a 10th consecutive win in all competitions thanks to stunning strikes from Lionel Messi and Neymar inside the opening half hour. However, a rare mistake from Chilean goalkeeper Claudio Bravo gave Sevilla a foothold in the game before half-time. And the Europa League holders took full advantage when Gerard Pique gifted Jose Antonio Reyes possession eight minutes from time as Kevin Gameiro finished off a flowing move to secure a point. ""I thought in the first-half we were much the better team, we played very good football, controlled the game and caused them a lot of problems,"" said Barca boss Luis Enrique. ""It was a shame that in the few minutes we lost control we conceded the goal that opened the game up. ""The second-half was much more even, both teams had their chances but neither was superior. We committed an error and we have paid for it."" The draw means that Barca now lead Real Madrid by just two points in the title race with seven matches remaining. Sevilla's fightback also ensured that they remain just four points adrift of third-placed Atletico Madrid in the fight for a return to the Champions League next season and extended their unbeaten run at home to 33 games. ""The point is what it is, we are still leaders and there is a week less to go,"" said midfielder Andres Iniesta. ""We have to analyse what we did wrong and keep improving. We don't need to blow things out of proportion because of this draw. ""It is a difficult place to come and we played well for a large part of the game, but they took their chances."" Barca's focus now turns to a Champions League quarter-final meeting with Paris Saint-Germain on Tuesday. ""We always need to be positive and have the confidence that everything will be fine,"" added Iniesta. ""We can't have any doubts in ourselves."""

""The match with Sevilla will be very complicated but I'm optimistic in terms of the significance if this game to us,"" Enrique told a press conference on Friday. ""I'm optimistic from what I see of the team, of the way it's training, and I'm optimistic about being able to minimise (Sevilla's) strengths and to make them suffer from our transitional play and our attacks."" Barca, four points clear of Real Madrid, will be trying to do what no team has managed in La Liga in over a year - beat Sevilla at their Sanchez-Pizjuan stadium. ""They are one of the best teams in the important aspects of the game and that shows from their place in the table, they're one of the most complicated teams to face at their ground after lots of games without defeat."" Enrique can take heart from being able to lean on a virtually full squad with the return to full fitness of Jordi Alba after a groin problem."

""We know that they will be very difficult matches, but if we face them with the personality we have we will have a good chance because we are Barca,"" said striker Luis Suarez after scoring twice against Almeria to take his tally for the season to 16. Barca will at least be able to welcome back six first-team regulars, including Neymar and Gerard Pique, after they were rested against Almeria. ""The schedule in April is very hard. We can't win any title, but we can lose them if we don't do things right,"" Pique said on Thursday. ""We can be knocked out the Champions League or lose our lead in the league. We have to go game by game and if we finish April well it means we are in the semi-finals and still on top in La Liga."" Sevilla have also won their last seven games in all competitions and are in desperate need of the points as they battle Valencia and Atletico Madrid for a place in next season's Champions League. ""The truth is we didn't expect to be playing so well at this stage of the season, we have a lot of confidence and want to continue like this,"" said midfielder Daniel Carrico. ""On Saturday we have a very difficult game, but we are playing in our stadium, in front of our fans and they always help us a lot."" Real Madrid can close to within a point of Barca before kick-off at the Sanchez Pizjuan as they host Eibar at the Santiago Bernabeu earlier on Saturday. The European champions have appealed the yellow card shown to Cristiano Ronaldo in Wednesday's 2-0 win over Rayo Vallecano which would see him miss out through suspension. Toni Kroos and James Rodriguez will definitely be banned after also picking up bookings at Vallecas, whilst boss Carlo Ancelotti has confirmed that Keylor Navas will get a rare start in goal ahead of Iker Casillas. Real will also have one eye on a return to European action in midweek as they face Atletico in the Champions League, who they have failed to beat in six previous meetings this season. Atletico who have the tougher game on paper this weekend when they travel to seventh-placed Malaga and defender Jesus Games insisted their focus will be on that game with Valencia and Sevilla breathing down their necks. ""Third place is far from being resolved. The teams are pushing hard and there are eight difficult games remaining. We need to concentrate on Malaga and not look to other games, we just need to focus on ourselves."" The champions are likely to be without goalkeeper Miguel Angel Moya and top scorer Mario Mandzukic once more through injury, but Juanfran returns from suspension and Diego Godin is expected to recover from a hamstring injury in time to take his place in central defence. Valencia were denied by a stoppage time equaliser in a 1-1 draw away to Athletic Bilbao on Thursday to move just a point ahead of Sevilla in fourth, but they will be confident of a return to winning ways when they host local rivals Levante on Monday.

However, Alves has been heavily linked with a move to Paris Saint-Germain and Manchester United among a host of other top European clubs and Santana said he had better offers on the table from other clubs. ""He would accept three years, but the condition that a player plays 60 percent of the games every year for me is not a three-year deal, but a one year,"" said Santana. ""Dani has a concrete offer on the table for a three-year deal plus the option for an extra year with a better wage than he has here and a signing on fee. ""Barca at the moment have told me that they will not match those figures and we understand that."" The Brazilian has made over 300 appearances and won 16 trophies at the Camp Nou since joining from Sevilla in 2008. His absence would cause Barca major problems for next season as the club are banned for registering new players until January 2016 due to a FIFA sanction for irregularities in the signing of minors."
1320,08/04/2015,22:07,"Football: Messi, Suarez propel Barca seven points clear",Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez were on target as Barcelona moved seven points clear at the top of La Liga with a 4-0 win over Almeria on Wednesday.,"The hosts took over half an hour to make the breakthrough, but Messi did so in style as he curled home his 44th goal of the season into the far corner. Suarez made the game safe when he fired into the top corner 10 minutes after the break and bagged his second of the evening in stoppage time after Marc Bartra headed home the third from Xavi's corner. Real Madrid can move back to within four points of the leaders when they travel to Rayo Vallecano later on Wednesday. With a tough trip to Sevilla to come on Saturday, Barca boss Luis Enrique made six changes to the side that won 1-0 at Celta Vigo on Sunday with Neymar and Gerard Pique among those rested. And Enrique's men were given a wake up call on 15 minutes when Wellington Silva's shot across goal came within inches of giving Almeria a shock lead. Pedro Rodriguez then fired a cross from Messi wide and Xavi Hernandez volleyed straight at Julian Cuesta as the pressure began to build. There was nothing Cuesta could do when the opener did arrive on 33 minutes as Messi found space on the edge of the area and curled brilliantly into the far corner with pinpoint accuracy. Suarez made sure of Barca's 20th win in their last 21 games in all competitions with a little help from Cuesta the keeper got a hand to the Uruguayan's powerful effort but couldn't keep it out. A consistent feature of that run has been the Catalans sudden ability to score from set-pieces and they did so for the third consecutive game 15 minutes from time when Bartra rose highest to power home Xavi's in-swinging delivery. Messi saw a goal wrongly ruled out for offside and then forced Cuesta into a fine late save from a free-kick as he had to settle for just the one for the evening, which leaves him still trailing Cristiano Ronaldo by three in the race to be La Liga's top scorer. However, Suarez was gifted his second when Pedro unselfishly picked out the former Liverpool man to roll into an empty net. At the other end of the table Cordoba ended a 10-game losing streak, but were denied victory at fellow strugglers Deportivo la Coruna as Florin Andone scored at both ends in a 1-1 draw."

1323,05/04/2015,22:57,Mathieu saves Barca,Jeremy Mathieu headed home a vital winner 16 minutes from time as Barcelona ground out a 1-0 win at Celta Vigo to remain four points clear of Real Madrid in La Liga on Sunday.,"Earlier, Cristiano Ronaldo's first ever five goal haul had taken Madrid back to winning ways in stunning style with a 9-1 thrashing of Granada. Mathieu had opened the scoring in Barca's 2-1 victory over Madrid last time out and just his second league goal for Barca could be just as crucial as they laboured for long spells against a well-organised Celta side. There were no such troubles for Madrid, as after Gareth Bale's opener, Ronaldo took over as he scored three times in eight minutes just after the half hour mark. Karim Benzema struck twice either side of Ronaldo's fourth as Real added three more in a four-minute spell just after the break. Robert Ibanez grabbed a consolation for the visitors, but Diego Mainz's own goal made it 8-1 before Ronaldo rounded off the scoring with a towering header. Meanwhile, Valencia's outside hopes of a late title challenge were dented as they remain in fourth, nine points off the top, after a 0-0 draw at home to Villarreal. Celta stunned Barca at the Camp Nou when they last met back in November and the visitors knew they were in for another uncomfortable 90 minutes when Claudio Bravo had to turn away former Barca forward Nolito's low drive 10 minutes in. At the other end Messi was first to threaten as Sergio Alvarez did well to parry his curling effort before Neymar fired the rebound well over. The best chance by of the opening 45 minutes fell to Celta's Joaquin Larrivey, but the man who scored the winner at the Camp Nou blazed over with just Bravo to beat. Barca started the second period brightly and could have been in front as Neymar had a sweetly struck goal ruled out for a marginal offside call. In the end the visitors had to rely on a set-piece to get the job done as a wonderful in-swinging free-kick from Xavi was met by a equally good header by Mathieu to thunder the ball in off the crossbar. Celta then ended the game with 10 men as Fabian Orellana was sent off in bizarre circumstances for throwing a clump of turf at Sergio Busquets. However, a lean night in front of goal for Lionel Messi means Ronaldo's quintuple takes him four clear of the Argentine in the race to be La Liga's top goalscorer. ""Happy to have scored five goals with this excellent team work. Thank you for all your support,"" Ronaldo posted on his official Twitter account. ""What more can I say about him? It is the first time he has scored five goals with Real Madrid which is great for him and for us looking forward to the next game,"" said Madrid boss Carlo Ancelotti. Bale was first to capitalise on some terrible Granada defending when he latched onto Toni Kroos's through ball to round Oier Olazabal and slot home from a narrow angle. James Rodriguez made his return after two months out with a foot injury and sealed his comeback with a lovely assist with the outside of his left foot to allow Ronaldo to curl home his first of the afternoon. The Portuguese soon made it 3-0 by lashing home from close range after Olazabal had spilled a cross and he sealed an eight-minute hat-trick with some more help from the Granada 'keeper as he couldn't keep out the World Player of the Year's drive from 20 yards. Granada offered embarrassingly little resistance after the break as Benzema was given plenty of time to control a corner from the left and fire home to make it 5-0. Bale then unselfishly teed up Ronaldo to nod home his 46th goal of the season, although there was a brief scare for the home fans as Ronaldo collided with the frame of the goal in doing so but was soon back on his feet. More shocking defending from Granada allowed Benzema to saunter through for a seventh barely 60 seconds later. Granada pulled a goal back when Ibanez burst clear of Raphael Varane to slot past Casillas, but their miserable day was rounded off when Mainz could only turn Luka Modric's cross into his own net. And fittingly Ronaldo had the final word when he rose highest to power Modric's free-kick in at the far post."

""Messi has trained without any problem with the rest of his teammates,"" Luis Enrique said on Saturday. ""We know he had a knock, but since he has arrived he is in good condition. ""Messi suffers a lot of knocks in every game. I am not going to talk about it again. He is in perfect condition to play."" Victory over Madrid last time out handed Barca a comfortable four-point lead at the top of La Liga with 10 games remaining. However, Luis Enrique insisted that champions Atletico Madrid and Valencia also remain in the hunt for the title and that last season's example, when all three of the title challengers stumbled in the final few weeks of the campaign, should serve as a warning to his players. ""I think that none of the four teams that can aspire to the title will win every game from here until the end of the season. I hope I am wrong and that it is us, but I don't think so. ""All the games are important. In these final stages of the season there are no easy opponents.

1325,03/04/2015,13:39,Neymar set to be called as witness in Barcelona tax case,Brazilian star Neymar is set to be called as a witness along with seven other people in the investigation into possible tax fraud by Barcelona in relation to his transfer to the Camp Nou.,"Radio station Cadena Ser announced on Friday that ""according to legal sources, prosecutors will ask him to appear as a witness in the tax fraud case against Barcelona president Josep Maria Bartomeu, the club and former president (Sandro) Rosell"". According to the same sources, the Madrid court that deals with complex financial cases will accept the request. Cadena Ser added that the request that Neymar appears in person before the court is justified by the fact that he personally signed nine of the 13 contracts being investigated. The Catalan club and their former and current presidents are accused of hiding the real cost of the transfer that brought the Brazilian star, now 23, to Barcelona from Santos in 2013. Prosecutors say Neymar cost ""at least 83,371,000 euros"" (£61.19m, $90.7m) and not the 57 million initially reported by Barcelona. A trial could take place in the autumn and might only last a week, Cadena Ser added. Prosecutors last month requested a prison sentence of two years and three months for Bartomeu and seven and a half years for his predecessor Rosell. The Madrid court is also calling for a fine of 22.2 million euros ($24.1 million) against the club over the transfer deal. Judge Pablo Ruz said various contracts produced ""were designed to cover or hide the fact that in reality they represented a higher cost for Barcelona"" in order to ""avoid or significantly reduce the money paid to the tax authorities"". The cost of the transfer rose steeply when Barca decided to bring forward an initial agreement signed in 2011 for the player to move in 2014 by a year as other clubs, including rivals Real Madrid, attempted to hijack the deal. Rosell resigned over the scandal in January 2014 with his then vice-president Bartomeu taking charge."

However, he took part in a light training session on Thursday and the club confirmed that the infamation in his foot had improved. The trip to Vigo kicks off an intense month for Barca with seven league fixtures and a Champions League clash with Paris Saint-Germain to come in the next 28 days. However, defender Gerard Pique welcomed the challenge of trying to win the treble for just the second time in the club's history after failing to pick up any silverware last season. ""The most important part of the season is coming now,"" said the Spanish international. ""There are a series of very hard games and the Champions League quarter-finals around the corner. We know how hard it will be and we need to be up to the task if we want to win titles. ""We have the team to do it and we have shown how we have improved throughout the year which gives us a lot of confidence. We have the experience of last year and we have to try and improve on that."" Barca will be without the injured Jordi Alba and suspended Javier Mascherano, but Sergio Busquets will be fit to take his place in the starting line-up for the first time in over a month. Real Madrid can close to within a point of the leaders when they face struggling Granada in Sunday's early game. Los Blancos have only won one of their last four league games, but will be confident of a return to winning ways against a Granada side that hasn't won away from home since September. Madrid boss Carlo Ancelotti will have a full compliment of midfielders to choose from for the first time in five months as James Rodriguez should make his return from a broken bone in his foot. The Colombian will probably have to settle for a place on the bench with Luka Modric, Toni Kroos and Isco keeping their places in the side that lost 2-1 at the Camp Nou last time out. Meanwhile Raphael Varane should replace the injured Pepe in defence. Valencia will also be attempting to maintain an unlikely title challenge when they face Villarreal at home on Sunday. Los Che have taken 25 points from a possible 30 to remain just eight points adrift of Barca and face both the Catalans and Madrid in the remaining 10 games of the season. ""We are very strong at home, we have 10 finals left and Sunday is the first of them,"" captain Dani Parejo told the club's website. ""It is a derby between two teams fighting for similar objectives. We are in third, whilst they aren't in great form and need the win. It will be a good game between two sides that like to play good football with intensity."" Valencia could be back down to fourth before they kick-off at the Mestalla, though, as Atletico Madrid trail Nuno Espirito Santo's men by just a point and the champions are in action on Saturday away to a Cordoba side that have lost their last nine La Liga games.

Al Sadd also said they ""would make any further and official announcements only if further developments take place"". Their statement came after pictures posted on social media by Al Sadd first-team manager Abdullah Al-Berik claimed that the 35-year-old 2010 World Cup winner had signed for what is one of Qatar's top sides. ""Al Sadd have just managed to sign Barcelona captain Xavi and this is a picture of him with sporting director Muhammed Ghoulam,"" Berik wrote on Instagram. If the deal does go through, Xavi would be expected to move to Qatar after the end of this season, despite having a contract with Barcelona until June 2016. The transfer would bring the curtain down on a 17-year first-team playing career with Barcelona, during which time Xavi has so far won seven La Liga championships, three Champions League titles and two FIFA Club World Cups. He was also an integral part of Spain's World Cup-winning side in 2010 and their two European Championship triumphs in 2008 and 2012. He has won more trophies -- 25 -- than any other Spanish footballer. Xavi has spent his whole career at Barcelona, playing more than 700 games for the Catalan side since his debut in 1998. Beyond mere figures, he will also be remembered as being a central figure of Barcelona's revolutionary 'tiki-taka' style of football, which relies on possession and passing, and helped the Catalan side to become arguably the dominant team in Europe in the first decade of the century. Barcelona president Josep Maria Bartomeu said that his club will not stand in the way of what would be a surprise move for the iconic playmaker. ""I will say what I did last summer, Xavi has earned the right to decide his future and he has a contract until the end of next season,"" said Bartomeu. ""If he decides to leave then he will have the full support of the board and I would imagine the supporters. He has the two options and he has the right to decide."" Xavi's signing would also be one of the biggest coups for Qatari domestic football in a country set to host the 2022 World Cup. Al Sadd are currently second in the league, seven points behind Lekhwiya, the side coached by former Barcelona player and Danish international Michael Laudrup. They are the most successful side in Qatari football and competed in the Club World Cup in 2011, finishing third after being knocked out by Barcelona in the semi-finals. Reports suggest that Xavi will sign a three-year contract with Al Sadd, with his role to combine coaching as well. He would follow in the footsteps of former Real Madrid star Raul Gonzalez, who played for Al Sadd in 39 games between 2012 and 2014. Barcelona are currently four points clear at the top of La Liga and also in the running for more silverware in the Champions League and Copa del Rey."

The two men and the club are charged with tax fraud and Rosell is also accused of accounting irregularities over his time in charge. Following months of investigation, a Spanish judge must now consider whether the case should go to trial. The judge, Pablo Ruz, said 10 days ago after completing his investigation that the two defendants were suspected of three counts of tax fraud worth a total of 13 million euros ($13.6 million), relating to the signing of the Brazilian striker in 2013. The club has said it paid 57 million euros overall to sign Neymar from Brazilian club Santos, but the judge suspects the real amount was more than 83 million euros. The cost of the deal rose steeply when Barca decided to bring forward an initial agreement signed in 2011 for the player to move in 2014 by a year as other clubs, including rivals Real Madrid, attempted to hijack the deal.

In February of last year, the club announced that they had made a voluntary payment of 13.5 million euros to the Spanish tax authorities regarding the transfer. Bartomeu denied all responsibility when he appeared before an examining magistrate investigating the matter last month. However, prosecutors believe he had full knowledge of the details involved in the transfer given his role as Rosell's right-hand man.

Barca have now won 18 of their last 19 games with Madrid's run of only one win in their last four league games contributing to an eight-point swing in the title race in just three weeks. However, Real bossed the game for the first hour and were left to rue a missed opportunity to put themselves back in the driving seat at the top of the table. Most alarmingly for Carlo Ancelotti's men they were not undone by Barca's traditional strengths of passing and movement as the hosts' goals came from a set-piece headed home by Jeremy Mathieu and a long ball over the top from Dani Alves which Suarez did brilliantly to control and finish on the turn. ""So many missed chances,"" lamented Madrid sports daily Marca. ""The whites played the better football and were more motivated, but Barca struck from a set-piece and on the counter-attack."" Inside there was praise for Suarez's run of seven goals in his last seven games, which have began to repay the faith Barca made in signing him for a club record fee from Liverpool in July just weeks after he was banned for four months for biting Italian defender Giorgio Chiellini at the World Cup. ""He has already justified the investment made in him,"" said Marca, highlighting his ability not just to score goals but also unsettle defenders which led to the free-kick for Barca's opener. Sport hailed the Uruguayan as a ""killer"" in front of goal who dug his side out of a hole as Madrid were the team in the ascendency before he struck just before the hour mark. Meanwhile, the other Catalan sport daily, Mundo Deportivo, named Suarez man of the match for playing ""with the passion that the match required and, above all, being decisive in the most important thing, the scoreline."" However, there were also words of warning for Barcelona in their quest to seal a treble of La Liga, Copa del Rey and Champions League for just the second time in their history. Luis Enrique's men have on paper the much tougher run in with away games at Sevilla, champions Atletico Madrid and local rivals Espanyol to come. Indeed an unlikely title challenge from Valencia can't yet be ruled out as Nuno Espirito Santo's in-form side lie eight points off the top, but face both Barca and Madrid in the final weeks of the season and don't have the distraction of Champions League football like the top two."
1333,23/03/2015,01:48,Five things we learned from Barca's win over Madrid,Barcelona took a huge step towards a fifth La Liga title in seven years with a 2-1 win over Real Madrid thanks to Luis Suarez's stunning strike on Sunday.,"Here, AFP sports looks at five lessons to be learned heading into the final 10 games of the La Liga season. 1. Suarez sinks his teeth into Madrid The Uruguayan made his Barca debut in the first game between these two sides as Madrid ran out convincing 3-1 winners back in October after completing a four-month ban for biting Italian defender Giorgio Chiellini at the World Cup. This time it was Madrid who were wounded by the former Liverpool star as he capped his rapid rise in recent weeks with what he described as his ""most important goal for Barca"" and the one that could land them the title. 2. Ronaldo wins the battle, Messi the war In the clash between the world's two best players, Cristiano Ronaldo won 1-0 as his first-half equaliser moved him level with Real legend Raul as the third highest scorer in El Clasico history. However, it was Lionel Messi who emerged victorious on the evening despite a subdued display until space opened up for Barca as Madrid chased the game in the final 20 minutes. 3. Pique's turnaround at the heart of Barca revival Barca had also scored first at the Bernabeu earlier in the campaign, but a stupid handball inside his own area from Gerard Pique handed them a route back into the game and they took full advantage. That was just one of a series of errors from the Spanish international in the opening months of the season, but his remarkable turnaround in performance since the turn of the year has been one of the hallmarks of Barca's run of 18 wins in 19 games. Pique claimed he wanted to return to being the best centre-back in the world a few months ago and Barca boss Luis Enrique said he was ""well on the road"" to doing so after a solid display to hold the Barca defence together in the face of some incessant first-half pressure from Madrid. 4. Modric offers Madrid hope Madrid boss Carlo Ancelotti took solace from his side's much improved display for the first hour of the match in comparison to their wretched form in recent weeks. That upturn had much to do with the return of Luka Modric in midfield after four months out as the Croatian played a major role in the lovely move which culminated in Ronaldo's equaliser. It was no coincidence that Ancelotti's men faded as the former Spurs man's legs wilted in the second-half after such a long spell on the sidelines. 5. Bale, Neymar still have much to prove The two blockbuster buys of the 2013 summer transfer window were seen as the heirs to Messi and Ronaldo's thrones at the Spanish giants. Yet, this was another showing in which neither covered themselves in glory. Bale was unfortunate to see a goal ruled out for Ronaldo being in an offside position in the first period, but fluffed his lines when firing wide with a good chance to send Madrid in 2-1 at the break. Neymar passed up even better chances, most notably seconds before Ronaldo's leveller, and was also too selfish on a number of occasions after the break with teammates better positioned to add the finishing touch."
1334,23/03/2015,01:42,Suarez hails 'most important goal',"Luis Suarez lauded his El Clasico winner as his biggest goal since moving to Barcelona, as the Catalan giants moved four points clear of Real Madrid with a 2-1 win on Sunday.","Suarez controlled Dani Alves's ball over the top and fired past Iker Casillas just before the hour mark to hand Barca a huge win. ""It is my most important goal for Barca so far, it has an extra meaning given the opponents that it was against,"" said Suarez. The former Liverpool star's strike came at a crucial juncture in the game as Madrid looked the more likely to go ahead after Cristiano Ronaldo had cancelled out Jeremy Mathieu's early opener for Barca. ""I tried to take advantage of the space between the defenders as quickly as possible to not give them time to react. Luckily it went in,"" added Suarez. Barca boss Luis Enrique lauded the Uruguayan's quality and said that is why the club splashed out a club record fee for the 28-year-old despite his chequered past. ""It is clear the goal is something very few players can do. That is why we signed him. We valued him because he is a player that makes the difference,"" said Enrique. ""Ever since he arrived we have been very happy with his performances, his commitment and everything he does for the team."" A third defeat in four games was another huge blow for Madrid, who led the league by four points just three weeks ago. Coach Carlo Ancelotti was consoled by his side's much improved display in the first hour of the game compared to their wretched form in recent weeks. However, he admitted his side wilted under the pressure of chasing an equaliser for the second time after the break. ""I think it was a mental problem not a physical one. We started looking for more difficult passes and that is why the last half-hour didn't go like the first-half. ""We are disappointed, but it is better to have better feeling in the way we played. We can have more confidence in the future games in the league and the Champions League."" Suarez admitted that Barca had played a dangerous game in the first-half, but had far more control once he had fired them in front for a second time. ""We fell into the trap of playing an end-to-end game which they like and we weren't in control of the game like we normally are. We played very direct and Madrid are very good at pressing. ""We didn't have the ball in the first half, but we wanted to do better in the second and that's how it went."" Suarez, though, insisted Barca can't take their foot of the gas having seen Madrid blow the same advantage in recent weeks. ""There is a long way to go and the league is very difficult,"" he said. ""We need to take advantage of the gap we have against a very strong opponent in Madrid. Like in all leagues, you don't know what can happen if you relax a little."" And Ancelotti said his side wouldn't give up the chase in the remaining 10 games of the season. ""At the moment the league isn't finished. Barca have an advantage, like we had before. In football anything can happen."""
1335,22/03/2015,20:15,Busquets only fit for bench in El Clasico,Spanish international Sergio Busquets wasn't risked from the start by Barcelona coach Luis Enrique for his side's huge La Liga clash with Real Madrid on Sunday.,"Busquets returned to training this week after suffering a sprained ankle just over two weeks ago, but is fit enough only for the bench. Claudio Bravo replaces Marc-Andre Ter Stegen in goal in Enrique's only change from the side that beat Manchester City 1-0 on Wednesday with the star South American trio of Lionel Messi, Luis Suarez and Neymar in attack. Madrid boast their own lethal front three of Gareth Bale, Cristiano Ronaldo and Karim Benzema.

1336,21/03/2015,16:04,"Barca are favourites, claims Ancelotti",Real Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti believes Barcelona are rightly favourites for the crucial La Liga clash between the two teams at the Camp Nou on Sunday.,"Barca lead the European champions by a point after overhauling Madrid on the back of 17 wins in 18 games since early January. By contrast, Ancelotti's men have won only three of their last six La Liga games. ""Being favourites or not depends on your form. At the moment Barca are in better form than us,"" said the Italian on Saturday. ""That aside, it is a very difficult game for both teams. We have confidence because this game gives us the opportunity to return to the top of the table."" Meanwhile, Ancelotti dismissed suggestions that a heavy defeat like the 4-0 humiliation suffered away to Atletico Madrid last month could leave him fighting for his job. ""I don't feel like I have a lot at stake, but that it is an important match for the club and the Madrid fans. ""It is the same for Barcelona. It is an image of the club that goes around the world and you have to show your best. Ancelotti all but confirmed his starting line-up as early as after last weekend's 2-0 win over Levante with Sergio Ramos and Luka Modric making their returns in that victory from long-term muscle injuries. There had been rumours that Ancelotti could, though, change his formation to a 4-4-2 shape similar to the one that saw Madrid beat Barcelona in the Copa del Rey final last season with Gareth Bale playing in a more withdrawn role. However, the former Chelsea boss said Bale's responsibilities would remain the same as in every other game. ""One player doesn't have more responsiblity than another. I will ask him what I ask of the rest, to defend as 11 and attack as 11. ""He has never played in midfield. His position won't change."""
1337,21/03/2015,14:15,Clasico not a title decider - Luis Enrique,Barcelona boss Luis Enrique has insisted that his side's crucial top of the table clash with Real Madrid on Sunday will not be the sole determining factor in the La Liga title race.,"The Catalans lead Madrid by a point and are favourites to extend that advantage on home soil after a run of 17 wins in 18 games in all competitions. However, with Barca still set to face the likes of Spanish champions Atletico Madrid, Valencia and Sevilla in the final 10 games of the season, Enrique believes there will be more twists and turns to come after this weekend. ""Independent of the result I don't think it will be decisive,"" Enrique said on Saturday ""There are still 10 games to go and there are too many difficult games for both teams, so it is not decisive but important."" By contrast, Madrid come into the game having lost five of their 16 games in 2015 to relinquish pole position in the title race. However, Enrique believes the array of talent on show for both sides means there can be no clear favourite on the night. ""Generally, we have to think that in this type of game there aren't favourites. ""There is a lot at stake and the two teams have players that are out of this world. ""Playing at home is important, though, because it can help in terms of motivation and intensity."" Barcelona could also be boosted by the presence of Sergio Busquets, who has made a quicker recovery than expected from a sprained ankle. The Spanish international trained with his teammates on Saturday, but Enrique refused to confirm whether he will start having been sidelined since suffering the injury against Villarreal on March 4. ""Busquets could be an option,"" added Enrique. ""He isn't 100 percent which is normal. He has trained the past three days. He isn't in perfect condition, but he is available which is important for us."""
1338,21/03/2015,02:25,Star front three shining brightly for Barca,"Barcelona had to wait nearly three months to unveil their shiny new toy this season as club record signing Luis Suarez sat on the sidelines, suspended for biting Giorgio Chiellini at the World Cup.","When Suarez finally was unleashed to form the third part of a star South American triumvirate also featuring Lionel Messi and Neymar, there were a few bumps in the road. Suarez's debut in the first El Clasico of the season against Real Madrid coincided with the Catalans' first defeat as a rampant Real ran out 3-1 winners. Worse was to come as Suarez's home bow also ended in a shock defeat to Celta Vigo a week later. The Uruguayan took six games to open his account for the club, and even that was against Cypriot minnows APOEL Nicosia. Doubts emerged. Were the three compatible? Shouldn't Barca have used their budget to strengthen other more obvious areas of weakness? Five months on those questions seem long forgotten. A run of 17 wins in 18 games has moved Barca a point clear of Madrid and made them favourites to extend that advantage to four when the European champions visit the Camp Nou on Sunday. Between them Messi, Suarez and Neymar have racked up a colossal return of 82 goals and 47 assists so far this campaign, and have Barca on course to repeat the historic treble won in Pep Guardiola's first season in charge. Moreover, they have out-gunned Madrid's own three-pronged attack of Cristiano Ronaldo, Gareth Bale and Karim Benzema. Crucially, the presence of Suarez and Neymar has created the space for Messi to rekindle the form which made him World Player of the Year four times in succession between 2009 and 2012. ""For most people, he is the best player in the world by a long way for everything that he does on the field. He does things other players can't do,"" Suarez told Gol TV. Messi was at his majestic best as Barca eased past Manchester City in midweek to reach the quarter-finals of the Champions League for an eighth consecutive season. The Argentine's nutmeg to leave James Milner lying on his backside instantly went viral and even left Guardiola -- on his first visit to the Camp Nou since leaving the club three years ago -- in awe. ""There are times when he passes you the ball which you weren't expecting because there are so many legs in between,"" added Suarez. ""All you can do is enjoy it and take advantage of having the opportunity to play with this class of player."" As Suarez has began to make his mark, Neymar's free-scoring form of early season has stalled a little with the Brazilian most at fault for Barca not rattling up a much more convincing win against City on Wednesday. But Barca boss Luis Enrique believes those expecting miracles from all three in every game are watching the wrong sport. ""I think all three have shone throughout the whole season: in goals, assists, defensive work, movement. ""It is impossible for all three to score a hat-trick every game. This is football not water polo or basketball."" Suarez agrees and insists it is team spirit and not just talent which has got Barca back on top. ""He will be the best player in the world because he has it all,"" he said of Neymar. ""He has a lot of quality, scores goals and is a great teammate, which some people sometimes doubt."""
1339,21/03/2015,02:15,Messi renews Ronaldo rivalry in battle to be world's best,Lionel Messi can take his record tally for Barcelona to a stunning 400 goals when the Catalans face Real Madrid in one of the biggest matches in world football on Sunday.,"Here, AFP sports compares the Argentine's stats with his eternal rival Cristiano Ronaldo in the quest to be La Liga's top dog. Messi leads in La Liga In early January, Barcelona and Messi appeared to be mired in a crisis after losing at Real Sociedad, whilst Ronaldo picked up his third career Ballon d'Or. In less than three months the tables have turned significantly as Messi has stormed ahead of Ronaldo in the race to be La Liga's top scorer with 20 goals in his last 17 games. Ronaldo's production has dropped to nine in 14 matches in the new year, only three of those from open play in La Liga. Messi now has 32 La Liga goals this season to Ronaldo's 30. The Champions of Champions At least in goalscoring terms, the story has been different in the Champions League as Ronaldo rescued Madrid with three goals in an unexpectedly tight 5-4 aggregate win over Schalke to reach the quarter-finals. Messi's weaved his magic as Barca dismissed Manchester City in midweek, but was unusually wasteful in front of goal and also missed a penalty in the first leg. Ronaldo's treble saw him move level with Messi on 75 Champions League goals and set a new all-time record for goals in European competitions with 78. Messi king of the Clasico It is Messi who leads the way in the scoring charts in the history of one of the biggest fixtures in world football. The 27-year-old has struck 21 times in 29 meetings with Madrid, including two hat-tricks. Ronaldo is joint fourth on the all-time list, tied with Madrid legends Ferenc Puskas and Francisco Gento and Barca's Cesar Rodriguez with 14 goals in 22 Clasicos. 400-club beckons for Messi A third career hat-trick against Madrid for Messi would also see him reach 400 goals for Barca in all competitions. Messi currently has 397 goals in 464 official games for the Blaugrana to go with his 45 strikes in 97 caps for Argentina. Ronaldo is edging closer to 500 career club goals as he has found the net 468 times with Madrid, Manchester United and Sporting Lisbon in 726 appearances. The Madeira-born star also has a marginally better international record with 52 in 118 caps to make him Portugal's all-time leading scorer. Leaders of the most expensive frontlines in history Ronaldo and Messi just form part of their sides' star-studded, three-pronged attacks. Madrid's ""BBC"" front three of Gareth Bale, Karim Benzema and Ronaldo have amassed 77 goals and 42 assists this season with respected transfer website transfermarkt.com valuing the trio at 250 million euros. Barca's South American triumvirate of Messi, Neymar and Luis Suarez are fractionally ahead in the stats with 82 goals and 47 assists between them and in value at an estimated 260 million euros."

1341,19/03/2015,01:37,"'Hart is a phenomenon', says impressed Messi","Lionel Messi was in the unusual position of having to laud one of his opponents for once as Joe Hart produced a sensational performance, albeit to no avail, as Barcelona eliminated Manchester City from the Champions League on Wednesday.","Hart made 10 saves on the night to restrict Barca to a 1-0 victory thanks to Ivan Rakitic's solitary strike on the half-hour mark which sealed a 3-1 aggregate triumph. Messi teed up the Croatian with a wonderful assist, but his quest to move ahead of Cristiano Ronaldo as the all-time leading scorer in Champions League history was frustrated by the stunning form of the English international. ""Hart is a phenomenon,"" said the four-time World Player of the Year. ""He saved everything today. I think we did everything to deserve a lot more, we had a lot of clear chances but the keeper had a brilliant game. ""We can only congratulate him, but the important thing is we achieved our objective to get through."" Despite being held scoreless, Messi is widely regarded to be in one of the hottest streaks of his fantastic career as Barca have won 17 of their last 18 games to make a potential treble of La Liga, the Copa del Rey and the Champions League a realistic target. ""I have gone from being a disaster to being in the best form of my career in a very short time,"" Messi added ironically, referring to Barca's mini-crisis having lost to Real Sociedad at the start of the year. ""I am just enjoying the moment like the rest of the team for the football we are playing and the results we are getting."" Barca boss Luis Enrique repeated his belief that Messi is the greatest player of all time, and urged the club's fans not to take his habitual brilliance for granted. ""He is the best player in the world without any doubt,"" said Enrique. ""Of this time and even for me in the history of the game. It is obvious and we are enchanted to have him among us. ""We have the luck to have Lionel Messi and shouldn't take for granted having a player of his class. It is a great pleasure and joy for all Barca fans to have him."" City manager Manuel Pellegrini, meanwhile, said the presence of Messi gave Barca an advantage over the remaining sides in Friday's draw for the last eight. ""Barca always have the added bonus of having Messi,"" he said when asked to compare the Catalans with competition favourites Bayern Munich, who City faced in the group stages. The English champions also played Bayern before being eliminated at the last 16 stage last season and Pellegrini said City's tough draws over the past two seasons means their inability to reach the quarter-finals for the first time in the club's history cannot be considered a failure. ""I don't think it is a failure. It is disappointing,"" said the Chilean. ""Two years a row we have qualified for the last 16, which we didn't in the previous years. Maybe if we had faced someone other than Barcelona we would be in the quarter-finals."""

The English champions had their chances in the second half, but any hopes of an historic comeback were ended when Marc-Andre ter Stegen produced a stunning penalty save from Sergio Aguero 12 minutes from time. However, it was his opposite number who was the star of the show as Hart time and again prevented Messi, Neymar and Luis Suarez from piling on more agony for City. Barca will now join La Liga rivals Real Madrid and Atletico Madrid in Friday's draw for the last eight. The Catalans face Real in a potentially decisive clash in the Spanish title race on Sunday, but Luis Enrique's men showed their minds were on the job in hand from the off and should have been ahead after just six minutes. Dani Alves robbed a sleeping Vincent Kompany on the edge of his own box and fed Neymar, who had started to wheel away in celebration before his shot come back off the inside of the post and rebounded to safety. Hart then produced the first in a string of fine saves to turn behind a fierce drive from Messi, but there was some encouragement for City in the opening quarter, too, as Alves did just enough to deny James Milner a clear run on goal from Yaya Toure's dangerous low cross. Barca did finally make the breakthrough on the half hour as Messi mesmerised a series of City defenders before lifting a cross into the path of Rakitic, who controlled the ball on his chest before lofting past Hart to register his first Champions League goal. Messi nearly had another brilliant assist moments later when he fed Neymar, but the Brazilian was too unselfish and his cross was nearly deflected into his own net by Bacary Sagna. Suarez was then inches away from putting the tie beyond all doubt as he latched on to Neymar's through ball and saw his flick past Hart trickle on to the base of the post a minute before the break. Barca continued to press early in the second period as Hart was forced into saves from Jordi Alba and Messi. However, the visitors were nearly handed a lifeline by Ter Stegen as he lost possession when trying to dribble past Aguero and was grateful to the posse of Barca defenders that got back to cover his open goal. As City pushed to get back into the tie, the chances continued to flow at the other end as Suarez blasted into the side-netting, whilst Hart spread himself well twice to deny Messi. Ter Stegen redeemed himself for his earlier error with his most significant save since joining from Borussia Monchengladbach by flying to his right to parry Aguero's spot-kick after Javier Mascherano had been harshly adjudged to have upended his Argentine international team-mate. However, it was Hart who shone once more in the dying minutes as England's number one somehow blocked Messi's thunderous strike from point-blank range to prevent the four-time World Player of the Year once again moving in front of Cristiano Ronaldo in the fight to be the top scorer in Champions League history."

1345,17/03/2015,20:39,Hart heroics can propell City fightback - Pellegrini,Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini believes Joe Hart's penalty save from Lionel Messi could prove crucial as his side look to turn around their Champions League last 16 tie against Barcelona on Wednesday.,"The English champions trail the Catalans 2-1 from the first leg in Manchester three weeks ago, but would have been even further behind had Hart not leapt to his left to save the four-time World Player of the Year's spot-kick in stoppage time at the Etihad. ""Of course we believe we can come back,"" the 61-year-old Chilean said on Tuesday. ""I think Hart's penalty save was important, it gave us belief."" City's fightback in the first leg after Luis Suarez had struck twice in the first-half was curtailed when Gael Clichy was dismissed for two yellow cards. Pellegrini's men also ended both games a man short when they were beaten 4-1 on aggregate by Barca at the same stage of the competition last season. However, he believes they can finally show that they are more than a match for the four-time European champions if they finally keep 11 men on the field for 90 minutes. ""Last year we played with 10 men both times and in the last game, too, so I'm not complaining about sending offs, but I hope tomorrow we keep 11 men (on the field) and fight to qualify from the first minute."" City's attempt to retain the Premier League title looks a forlorn one after a shock 1-0 defeat to Burnley at the weekend left them six points adrift of Chelsea, who also have a game in hand. However, Pellegrini dismissed suggestions that his job is under threat should elimination at the Camp Nou almost certainly seal a trophyless season. ""I respect all opinions, but I don't think my job is in danger. If it was I would do the same as I am doing now, concentrate and try to play the right game tomorrow. ""After the game tomorrow we can decide if it is a failure. It will be a hard game, we will cross the other bridge when we get there."""
1346,17/03/2015,14:49,Man City tie more important than Clasico,Barcelona midfielder Andres Iniesta believes his side's Champions League last 16 meeting with Manchester City is more important in the context of their season than a potentially decisive La Liga clash with Real Madrid on Sunday.,"The Catalans come into the most important week of their season to date in fine form having won 16 of their last 17 games to move a point clear of Madrid at the top of La Liga and progress to the Copa de Rey final. That run also included a 2-1 success in Manchester three weeks ago to make the four-time European champions strong favourites to progress to the last eight for an eighth consecutive season. However, Iniesta insisted Barca can't get ahead of themselves with the likes of Sergio Aguero, David Silva and Yaya Toure posing a serious threat at the Camp Nou on Wednesday. ""The game tomorrow is perhaps even more important,"" Iniesta said on Tuesday. ""What better way is there to go into Sunday than having won, feeling good on the field and being closer to our objective in the Champions League. ""As a footballer you live in the moment once you enter the field and tomorrow is very, very important for us to achieve the objective we have in mind."" By contrast, City are attempting to reach the quarter-finals for the first time in their history. Despite spending hundreds of millions of pounds in the transfer market and winning two Premier League titles in the last three years, Manuel Pellegrini's men have consistently failed to make their mark on the European stage in recent seasons. Yet, Iniesta is wary that there is no better stage to make a statement for the English champions than at the Camp Nou. ""I am not a City player so I can't say what has happened (in European games), but from afar my perception of them hasn't changed much. I see them as a very strong team with many great players and one that is difficult to beat."" Barca boss Luis Enrique echoed the words of his talented midfielder and is keen to play down the feeling of expectancy in the Catalan capital ahead of two huge games. ""It would be dangerous to take anything for granted from the result in the first-leg,"" said Enrique. ""We have to try to win the game and think about what we can do better than our opponent."" Enrique also confirmed that Spanish international Sergio Busquets will miss City's visit with his chances of recovering from a sprained ankle in time to face Madrid increasingly in doubt."
1347,17/03/2015,02:13,Historic task awaits Man City in Barcelona,Manchester City face a huge challenge if they are to reach the last eight of the Champions League for the first time ever by overturning a 2-1 first leg deficit when they travel to an in-form Barcelona on Wednesday.,"The English champions were outplayed at home for the second season in a row at this stage of the competition three weeks ago and could have been even further behind travelling to the Catalan capital had Joe Hart not saved a Lionel Messi penalty in stoppage time at the Etihad. Both sides also come into the game at the Camp Nou in contrasting form domestically. City's title challenge appears all but over after a shock 1-0 defeat at relegation threatened Burnley on Saturday, whilst Barca have soared to the top of La Liga in recent weeks on a run of 16 victories in their last 17 games. Yet, City boss Manuel Pellegrini is insistent that his job is not on the line should elimination at the Camp Nou all but seal a trophyless season. ""I have no sense whatsoever that my job's at risk,"" the Chilean told The Guardian. ""The Champions League is very important but it can't distort everything."" Pellegrini was criticised by many for his over-eager attacking intent in the first leg, which allowed Barca's star front three of Messi, Luis Suarez and Neymar to prosper. However, he believes that philosophy is what still gives them a chance despite the daunting prospect of having to win at the Camp Nou. ""The starting point is that it is possible to go to Barcelona and win. We have to have that mentality, our mentality. ""Our identity is to have a big-team mentality, to go to win. And now losing 2-1, we have to attack."" By contrast, Barcelona now have a treble in their sights with a potentially decisive La Liga clash with eternal rivals Real Madrid to come on Sunday and a Copa del Rey final against Athletic Bilbao to look forward to at the end of the campaign. The backbone of the upturn in form from Luis Enrique's men has been Messi's incredible form as the Argentine took his tally for the season to 43 goals in just 39 games with a double against Eibar at the weekend. However, Suarez has also begun to make his presence felt after a club record move from Liverpool in the summer as last season's Premier League Player of the Year has struck six times in his last five games, including both his side's goals in the first leg. ""It is pleasing to help the team with important goals in a Champions League knockout game and of course to return to England and beat a team you're always motivated to face,"" Suarez told Uefa.com. ""Players like me get inspired when fans boo them - it helps motivate you a bit more."" Barca will be without the injured Sergio Busquets, so Jeremy Mathieu is expected to deputise in central defence with Javier Mascherano moving into midfield. Gael Clichy is City's only absentee, the French defender is suspended after being sent-off in the first leg."
1348,13/03/2015,17:13,Judge upholds case against Barca bosses,"A Spanish judge on Friday upheld a tax fraud case against FC Barcelona's current and ex-chairmen over the signing of striker Neymar, taking them a step closer to a possible trial, a judicial source said.","Wrapping up his preliminary investigation, a judge at the National Court in Madrid ruled there were grounds for suspecting tax fraud by Barca's chairman Josep Maria Bartomeu and his predecessor Sandro Rosell, the source said. The court, Spain's top criminal tribunal, upheld the charges against the two and the club as a whole and referred the case to the state prosecution service -- one of the last steps towards a possible trial. ""Judge Pablo Ruz decided to proceed with the case... and rejected the request by Bartomeu and Rosell for the case to be dismissed,"" the source told AFP. The judge suspects the club understated the real cost of signing Neymar in order to ""surreptitiously evade or reduce the payment to the public treasury"". The club has denied any wrongdoing. In a statement it vowed to appeal against Friday's decision immediately. It said its attempts at a defence were being disrupted by the ""abnormal swiftness"" with which the case was moving forward. State prosecutors now have 10 days to present formal accusations. The judge will then have to rule whether the two defendants and the club should be sent to trial. Following months of investigations, Ruz said the two defendants were suspected of three counts of tax fraud worth a total 13 million euros ($13.6 million) relating to the signing of the star striker in 2013. The club has said it paid 57 million euros overall to sign Neymar from Brazilian club Santos, but the judge suspects the real amount was more than 83 million euros. The case comes at a sensitive time as Bartomeu is hoping to run for another term when the club elects its next chairman later this year."
1349,11/03/2015,15:35,Neymar targets treble for Barcelona,Brazilian striker Neymar believes Barcelona can repeat the best season in the club's history when Pep Guardiola's side won the treble in 2008/09 in the coming months.,"The Catalans lead Real Madrid by a point in La Liga, will face Athletic Bilbao in the final of the Copa del Rey and lead Manchester City 2-1 after the first leg of their Champions League last 16 tie. ""I think we have the team to think about winning the treble,"" Neymar said on Wednesday. ""We will give everything to win it. I don't want to choose any title, I want to win all three."" Real have handed the initiative in the title race to their eternal rivals with a series of slip-ups in recent weeks. And Barca can take a huge step towards winning the league for the fifth time in seven seasons when they host Madrid on March 22. ""The Clasico will be a final, we will prepare for it like that. Madrid are a very difficult team to play against, but we are only thinking about winning the game. ""The lead won't be definitive because the league is very long and there are still a lot of games to go. We need to play our game and concentrate on winning."" The Clasico will see the two most expensive frontlines in history go head-to-head once more as Barca's on-form trio of Neymar, Luis Suarez and Lionel Messi take on Madrid's three-pronged attack of Cristiano Ronaldo, Gareth Bale and Karim Benzema. ""I think so,"" Neymar replied when asked if he thought Barca's front three was better than Madrid's. ""But we focus on ourselves, we don't think about the opponents. ""We try to do damage to rival defences and every day we understand each other better. They are two brilliant players. ""Leo is the best in the world and Suarez is a great goalscorer. It is an honour for me to play with them."""

The 26-year-old was injured as Barca progressed to the Copa del Rey final with a 3-1 win over Villarreal on Wednesday. ""Tests carried out confirm the player has sprained his right ankle,"" a club statement said. ""The player is out for the game against Rayo and availability for upcoming games will depend on his progress."" City travel to Catalonia for the second leg of their Champions League last 16 tie on March 18, before Madrid visit the Camp Nou four days later in a match already being billed as a potential La Liga title decider."
1351,04/03/2015,20:53,Busquets stretchered off with ankle injury,"Spanish international Sergio Busquets had to be stretchered from the pitch during Barcelona's Copa del Rey semi-final, second leg match against Villarreal on Wednesday with a serious looking ankle injury.","The 26-year-old had his right ankle stood on by Villarreal midfielder Tomas Pina in the build-up to the hosts equaliser on the night scored by former Barca man Jonathan dos Santos. Neymar had opened the scoring and given Barcelona a 4-1 lead on aggregate after just three minutes from Lionel Messi's cross. However, the loss of Busquets could prove an expensive price to pay for a place in the final for the Catalans as they face Real Madrid in a crucial La Liga clash and host Manchester City in the second leg of their Champions League last 16 tie in the coming weeks."

""When a club like Barca shows an interest, that is of course a huge honour,"" he said. ""At the time I was already preparing for the new season with Bayern. ""These days you don't have to leave Bayern to join Barcelona if you want to win the Champions League,"" he added. With 50 caps for Germany, Boateng was a key part of the squad which won last year's World Cup and has a contract in Munich until June 2018. He also lifted the Champions League title with Bayern in 2013 when they become the first German side to win the treble of European, league and cup titles in the same season. Boateng, who played for Hertha Berlin, Hamburg and Manchester City before joining Bayern in 2011 for 13.5 million euros ($15m), is currently rated the world's most expensive defender with an estimated market value of 40 million euros -- which he dismisses as vastly over-inflated. ""I also find this sum, which has sky-rocketed in the few years, crazy,"" he said."
1353,04/03/2015,12:21,Pique's parking ticket row ends in court,A Spanish judge hit Barcelona star Gerard Pique with a heavy fine on Wednesday after the 2010 World Cup winner lost his temper and insulted two traffic police.,"The confrontation happened in October 2014 while Pique was waiting in the passenger seat of his brother's illegally parked car. The judge heard that the 28-year-old husband of Colombian singing star Shakira tried to persuade the police he had only stopped for five minutes, but his excuses were ignored. When given the parking ticket the footballer screwed it up and threw it at them while insulting them in a an offensive manner. A fine of 900 euros was recommended but the judge told the court that due to Pique's high salary at Barcelona the fine was being raised to 10,500 euros (11,600 dollars, 7,600 pounds). Pique was not in court Wednesday but made a public apology via his Twitter account at the time, claiming the incident had been blown out of proportion, but saying he was very sorry and wouldn't do it again. Pique has won the Champions League with Manchester United and Barcelona, while with Spain he won both the World Cup in 2010 and Euro 2012."
1354,03/03/2015,14:59,Barca out to sink Villarreal Cup final dreams,Barcelona have one eye on a potential treble when they take a 3-1 lead into the second leg of their Copa del Rey semi-final against Villarreal on Wednesday.,"The Catalans have their La Liga fate back in their own hands thanks to Villarreal holding Real Madrid to a 1-1 draw on Saturday and seem well set for the last eight of the Champions League after beating Manchester City 2-1 away in the first leg of their last 16 tie last week. The next month will go a long way to deciding the fate of Luis Enrique's men as City visit the Camp Nou on March 18 before Madrid make the same journey four days later. However, Enrique is determined his star-studded squad do not take their eye off the ball at El Madrigal despite their healthy advantage in the tie. ""I am concentrating on the game against Villarreal, it doesn't matter if it is the most difficult month. We will do what we have in every game and that is focus on the opponent in front of us."" The former Barca captain did though admit that his team selection may be affected by the fact the on-form Luis Suarez and Javier Mascherano are one booking away from missing the final. ""It is something to bear in mind,"" he added. ""A final is in play and it is interesting but it doesn't condition the game. To be able to play the final you have to get through the semi-final."" Villarreal have enjoyed a fantastic season so far as they too are still involved on three fronts. The Yellow Submarine lie sixth in La Liga, progressed to the last 16 of the Europa League with a 5-2 aggregate victory over Red Bull Salzburg last week and now have a first Copa del Rey final in their history within reach. Yet, they have been beaten by Barca in all three of their previous meetings this season and Enrique expects a more offensive threat from the hosts on Wednesday. ""The Villarreal I have seen in the league isn't the Villarreal that have faced us in three games. I think they play with the ball less when they play against us. ""I think tomorrow we will see a more offensive version than we have seen in the three games this season and they have nothing to lose."" Villarreal boss Marcelino was insistent after Saturday's draw at the Bernabeu that his decision to make seven changes from the side that started in Salzburg had been vindicated. A host of first-team regulars including top-scorer Luciano Vietto and on-loan Madrid winger Dennis Cheryshev will return against Barca and Marcelino believes they can score the goals needed to pull off a huge upset. ""We are capable of causing Barcelona problems,"" he said. ""We hit the post against them three times earlier this season and lost. ""I hope that this time luck and our play allow us to get to the final, but, like against Real Madrid, we are playing against the best in the world."" In the other semi-final, Espanyol hold the upper hand as they host Athletic Bilbao with the cushion of an away goal after a 1-1 draw in the first leg three weeks ago."
1355,26/02/2015,14:32,Busquets extends Barcelona deal to 2019,"Barcelona midfielder Sergio Busquets has extended his contract with the Catalan giants until 2019, the club confirmed on Thursday.","""FC Barcelona have reached an agreement with Sergio Busquets for the renewal of his contract until June 30, 2019 with the option for another year,"" said a statement on the club's website. The 26-year-old has made over 300 appearances for Barca and won 16 trophies since breaking into the first team under the orders of Pep Guardiola during the club's famous treble winning season in 2008/09. Spanish media also reported that the new deal will see Busquets move up the pay ladder at the Camp Nou just behind the star trio of Lionel Messi, Xavi Hernandez and Andres Iniesta."
1356,25/02/2015,14:05,Messi keeps penalty duties despite last minute miss,"Lionel Messi will remain Barcelona's penalty taker despite his Champions League miss against Manchester City, coach Luis Enrique insisted.","The Argentine superstar will keep his spot-kick taking duties, ""without a doubt"", Enrique said, despite his failure in the dying seconds of Tuesday's 2-1 last 16 first leg victory. City goalkeeper Joe Hart brilliantly saved Messi's spot kick and the little striker also missed with a followup header. A goal which would have given Barcelona commanding 3-1 win. Messi has now failed to convert five of the last 10 penalties he has taken for club and country. The four-time World Player of the Year has missed three penalties for Barcelona this season and left the field alone as two-goal hero Luis Suarez and other players went over to celebrate with Barcelona fans in the Ettihad stadium. But Enrique gave a huge vote of confidence to the star despite their reportedly rocky relations. ""Penalties are for those who dare to step up and Leo Messi is our penalty taker without a doubt,"" Enrique said. ""We know penalties can be missed in this game of ours and the next player to take one will be Lionel Messi,"" he said. With Suarez outshining his fellow South American, Enrique insisted it was still ""a night to celebrate."" ""Leo knows how to face these situations,"" added Suarez, who enjoyed his best night in a Barca shirt since joining from Liverpool for a club record fee in July. ""Sometimes you score penalties and other times not. The important thing is that the team played a spectacular first-half in every sense."" Earlier this month, Messi passed up penalty taking responsiblities for the first time in five years when he let Neymar take a spot-kick against Villarreal in the first-leg of their Copa del Rey semi-final. However, the Brazilian also saw his effort saved by goalkeeper Sergio Asenjo."
1357,25/02/2015,02:05,Man City stirrings give Pellegrini Barca hope,"Despite defeat by Barcelona, Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini said his side would take confidence from their second-half reaction into the return leg of their Champions League last 16 tie.","A first-half brace from Luis Suarez helped Barcelona to a 2-1 win in Tuesday's first leg at the Etihad Stadium, but Sergio Aguero's 69th-minute goal and a stoppage-time penalty blunder by Lionel Messi gave City hope. City lost Gael Clichy to a red card -- echoing the dismissals of Martin Demichelis and Pablo Zabaleta during last season's 4-1 aggregate loss to Barcelona at the same stage of the competition -- but Pellegrini expressed belief that they would turn the tie around at Camp Nou next month. ""In the way we have to play, I think we can do it,"" he said. ""We demonstrated in the second half that we are not a worse team than Barcelona. ""It's very important not to continue making the same mistakes. You can't have a player sent off in every game against Barcelona."" Messi won Barcelona's late penalty after he was felled by Argentina team-mate Zabaleta, but his spot-kick was parried by City goalkeeper Joe Hart and he headed the rebound wide of the left-hand post. Given the extent of their first-half domination, when an attacking City team spent much of the time chasing shadows, a 3-1 win would not have flattered the visitors. Pellegrini admitted that his team ""could not put three passes together"" as Barcelona turned on the style -- Messi nonchalantly nutmegging David Silva deep inside the visitors' half at one point -- but the City manager said Hart's save could prove a turning point. ""It was a very important save,"" said Pellegrini, who hopes to become the first manager to steer City to the Champions League quarter-finals. ""It was a very unnecessary penalty. We must control our emotion inside the box. Of course that gives us more chance to try to win in Barcelona; 3-1 is a very difficult score to try to reverse."" Messi played a role in both of Barcelona's goals. In the 16th minute, his right-wing cross bounced off Vincent Kompany, allowing Suarez to fire home, and it was his dribble and pass that allowed Jordi Alba to cross for the Uruguayan to slide in his second. The Argentina superstar has now failed to convert five of the last 10 penalties he has taken for club and country, but Barcelona coach Luis Enrique said he would remain his first-choice penalty-taker. ""We know penalties can be missed in this game of ours and the next player to take one will be Lionel Messi,"" he said. While a third goal would have given Barcelona one foot in the last eight, Enrique said that he was still satisfied with the outcome of the match. ""It is a night to celebrate,"" he said. ""Even if it had been 3-1, the tie would still be open. You can't relax and think the tie is done and dusted."" Suarez was playing in England for the first time since leaving Liverpool last year and although he celebrated his goals with characteristic glee, he felt that the tie was far from over. Asked if City still had a chance, the Uruguay striker told ITV: ""I think so. If they lost the game 3-1, that is really difficult for them, but 2-1 is a good result for them."" Pellegrini played down suggestions that City were under pressure to prove themselves as a Champions League force by beating Barcelona due to the massive investment in the club by Emirati owner Sheikh Mansour. ""It is important for this team to continue in the Champions League as far as possible,"" he said. ""I don't think we have invested any more than Barcelona. They have also invested a lot of money. ""This tie isn't over until the game ends in Barcelona. We can analyse it then."""
1358,24/02/2015,23:26,Suarez scores brace as Barcelona down Man City,Luis Suarez returned to haunt Manchester City by scoring twice as Barcelona took control of their Champions League last 16 tie with a 2-1 away win on Tuesday.,"Suarez was a thorn in City's side last season, scoring 31 goals as Liverpool pushed Manuel Pellegrini's team all the way in the title race, and his first-half brace set Barcelona on the way to a repeat of their 4-1 aggregate win over the same opponents from this time last year. But Sergio Aguero struck in the 69th minute to give City something to build on in the second leg on March 18 and they were spared a heavier defeat in stoppage time when Lionel Messi won a penalty following a foul by Pablo Zabaleta, only for Joe Hart to save his spot-kick and for him to head the rebound wide. Another echo of last year's tie means that City will travel to Camp Nou without left-back Gael Clichy, however, after he followed Martin Demichelis and Zabaleta's example from 2014 by getting sent off for two bookable offences. ""We played two different games in the first half and the second half,"" said City manager Pellegrini. ""We conceded an early goal and played very bad. In the second half we did what we talked about before the game. ""We have a chance. We must try to do it there in the next game."" Barcelona coach Luis Enrique said: ""I think it's a deserved victory and we need to be proud of victories like that. This type of tie is very difficult. It could have been 2-2."" Pellegrini had opted for a cautious approach when the teams first met a year ago, fielding Alvaro Negredo as a lone striker and packing the midfield, but he changed tack dramatically for the reunion by deploying Edin Dzeko up front alongside Aguero in an adventurous 4-4-2 formation. It was a gameplan that unravelled at dizzying speed, as the decision to deploy Fernando as a sole holding midfielder in the absence of the suspended Yaya Toure gave Barcelona acres of space to flood into. Vincent Kompany volleyed a lofted pass from Messi narrowly wide of his own goal, Demichelis blocked from Messi and Suarez hit the side-netting before Barcelona broke through in the 16th minute. Messi's right-wing cross struck Kompany on the back as he covered Suarez's run towards the near post and the former Liverpool talisman pounced to lash a left-foot shot across Hart and in. In response, Dzeko headed wide from Clichy's cross, but Barcelona were in control, with Messi nonchalantly nutmegging David Silva inside his own half shortly before Suarez hared onto Neymar's pass and forced Hart to make a sprawling save. The second goal arrived on the half hour and had Messi at its root, the Argentine jinking past three players and finding Jordi Alba, whose low cross was gleefully touched home by the sliding Suarez. Neymar saw a lob hacked off the line by Kompany, Hart saved bravely from Messi and Dani Alves hit the bar with a mishit cross, before Samir Nasri finally drew a save from visiting goalkeeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen on the stroke of half-time. Ter Stegen had rather more to do in the opening stages of the second half, but City could not convert the initial opportunities they made. Dzeko squandered two headed chances -- putting one wide and sending another straight at Ter Stegen from six yards out -- while the German also caught a header from Demichelis and saw Aguero fire a shot just wide. Clichy's first booking arrived in the 59th minute when he tripped Ivan Rakitic, shortly before City introduced Fernandinho for Nasri and Champions League debutant Wilfried Bony in place of Dzeko. With 21 minutes remaining, Aguero gave City a lifeline, gathering a neat back-heel from Silva and ghosting past Gerard Pique before slamming home. Clichy's second booking, for a clumsy kick at Alves, dampened the mood, but Messi's penalty mishap gave the home fans inside the Etihad Stadium late encouragement."
1359,24/02/2015,02:15,"Older, bolder Man City seek Barcelona revenge","Emboldened by a year's extra experience and given hope by contrasting weekend results, Manchester City go in search of vengeance against Barcelona in the Champions League last 16 on Tuesday.","Barcelona won 4-1 on aggregate when the teams faced off at the same stage of last season's competition and had won 11 games in a row before losing 1-0 to Malaga on Saturday, but City believe they are now better equipped to beat them. When the teams met a year ago, City were in the thick of a sapping schedule of 14 matches in seven and a half weeks, while a hamstring injury restricted Sergio Aguero to just 45 minutes of the second leg. Twelve months on, Aguero is fit and in form, and although Yaya Toure will miss Tuesday's first leg at the Etihad Stadium as he completes a three-game ban, City are otherwise at full strength. Manuel Pellegrini's side have shrugged off a recent run of poor form to record handsome wins over Stoke City and Newcastle United, enabling them to close to within five points of leaders Chelsea in the Premier League. But although City midfielder Samir Nasri believes his side showed Barcelona ""too much respect"" last year, Pellegrini has warned that his players will need to remain watchful if they are to exact revenge. ""In terms of possession, there are two things we have to think about,"" said the City manager, whose side crushed Newcastle 5-0 on Saturday. ""We've got to try to get the ball back as quick as we can and be very intense, because they have technically gifted players who know how to keep the ball. ""And the second thing is, when we have the ball, not to give it away cheaply."" Both games last season followed similar patterns, with Lionel Messi twice opening the scoring, Dani Alves twice adding a late goal, and City twice having a defender sent off -- Martin Demichelis in the first leg and Pablo Zabaleta in the second. Demichelis's dismissal at the Etihad, for a last-man foul on Messi that yielded a penalty from which the Argentine put Barcelona ahead, left Pellegrini furious and he was given a two-game touchline ban by UEFA for lambasting Swedish referee Jonas Eriksson. Now under the tutelage of Luis Enrique, Barcelona are a different team to the tiki-taka devotees of old, spring-mounted to move the ball forward as quickly as possible to a devastating front three of Neymar, Luis Suarez and Messi, who has already scored 14 goals in 2015. Enrique had to field several questions about his side's loss to Malaga during a tetchy pre-match press conference, but he said the sense of occasion on Tuesday would help his team refocus. Asked if playing in England provided extra motivation, the Barcelona coach said: ""It certainly does when you travel to a country like this with such a tradition of football. ""Particularly when playing against an opponent like yourself with a motivation to win the Champions League. ""We're going into the decisive phase of the tournament. Only one of us can go through, so obviously you take it really, really seriously."" City have already demonstrated that they can thrive in Europe without Toure, having engineered a stunning group-phase escape -- a stirring 3-2 win against Bayern Munich, in which Aguero scored a hat-trick, followed by a 2-0 victory at Roma -- without the influential Ivorian in their ranks. Fit again after a knee problem, James Milner could be drafted into midfield, while Aguero is expected to lead the line alone, with new signing and Champions League newcomer Wilfried Bony on the bench. Discipline will be a key concern for the hosts, however, with Aguero, Zabaleta, Gael Clichy and Edin Dzeko all one booking away from suspension. Barcelona's group-phase progress was rather more serene, despite a 3-2 loss at Paris Saint-Germain, and their only absentees are long-term injury victims Thomas Vermaelen and Douglas."
1360,23/02/2015,20:54,Enrique dismisses Malaga fears as City loom,Barcelona coach Luis Enrique declared on Monday that there would be no hangover from his side's shock defeat by Malaga in their Champions League last 16 clash with Manchester City.,"Barcelona saw an 11-game winning run abruptly ended by Saturday's 1-0 loss at home to Malaga and despite Tuesday's first leg with City looming into view, questions about the weekend defeat dominated the eve-of-match press conference. At times Enrique appeared close to exasperation with the Spanish journalists' line of questioning, but he said that one bad result should not overshadow the sparkling displays that had come before. ""I don't see why the team should be down after such a great run of victories,"" said the former Barcelona and Real Madrid midfielder. ""We didn't do things right at the weekend, we committed a few errors, and that's why we lost. We need to keep on doing things like we have been."" He added: ""I'd take losing one game and winning the next 12. Morale is fine. No-one is too down about it."" Reports emerged last year of a rift between Enrique and star player Lionel Messi, but when asked how his relationship with the players was now, the coach replied: ""Same as ever."" Enrique's words were echoed by defender Gerard Pique, on his return to the city where he spent four years playing for City's cross-town rivals Manchester United. ""There are no problems between us and the manager,"" said the Spain international. ""We get on fine, the relationship is good. We just came off 11 wins on the bounce. We don't need to worry about it (the Malaga defeat) anymore. It's behind us now. ""We know what we have to do. We have shown in the past how we can play here. A good result is the best way to show people the team is just how it was three days ago."" Barcelona won 2-0 on their last visit to the Etihad Stadium a year ago, en route to a 4-1 aggregate success, but it took a 54th-minute penalty for them to break the deadlock, scored by Messi after he had been brought down by Martin Demichelis right on the edge of the penalty area. ""It will be a similar game,"" Pique predicted. ""We're going to have a lot of the ball and we'll try and attack. The key will be possession. ""Last year the penalty made the difference. It was 0-0 at the time and looked like it was going to be 0-0. ""We'll try to perform in a similar way to last year. We need to be serious, concentrated and create chances."" Tuesday's game will be Barcelona number nine Luis Suarez's first match in England since he left Liverpool last year. The Uruguayan was a thorn in City's side last season as his 31 goals fired Liverpool to the brink of the title and although he has only found the net seven times since arriving at Camp Nou, Enrique praised his impact. ""I think he's been doing really well,"" he said. ""It's his first season here. He's a real reference in attack for us, a real target man. ""He's got virtues that really benefit us: he's good on the ball, he allows other forwards to work around him and he creates space. I think he's going to bring a lot to Barcelona in the future."""
1361,23/02/2015,15:37,"We respected Barcelona too much, says Nasri",Manchester City midfielder Samir Nasri told his team-mates on Monday that they must shed any sense of inferiority if they are to outwit Barcelona in the Champions League last 16.,"Nasri was a member of the City team beaten 4-1 on aggregate by Barcelona at the same stage of last season's competition, which was the third time he had fallen foul of the Catalan giants in his career. Barcelona are favourites to progress ahead of Tuesday's reunion at the Etihad Stadium, but with an extra year's experience and a close to full-strength squad, Nasri feels City are now a different prospect. ""I think we respected them too much,"" the former Arsenal midfielder said when asked if City had approached last season's tie too cautiously. ""But we weren't experienced to compete with a club like this. They know how to play this kind of game. They know how to win the Champions League and it was the first time we'd been through the group stage. ""I think it was too much of a big game. We were not ready, but this year is totally different. We know what we are capable of. We're not going to be scared and we're going to play to win."" City will be missing Yaya Toure through suspension, but in contrast to last season's encounter with Barcelona, they have Sergio Aguero fully fit and close to peak form. The Argentina striker missed last season's 2-0 first-leg defeat at the Etihad with a hamstring injury and lasted only 45 minutes in the second leg before being replaced by Edin Dzeko. But he has grown in sharpness following a recent lay-off with knee ligament damage, scoring three times in his last two games, and Nasri believes he is the equal of all but Lionel Messi in the Barcelona team. ""Messi and (Cristiano) Ronaldo play in their own galaxy. They compete with each other,"" Nasri told a press conference at the newly opened City Football Academy across the road from the Etihad. ""But the rest, (Luis) Suarez and Neymar, are the same level as Sergio. Sergio, when he is fit, can lift the team and score goals."" City have struggled at home in the Champions League of late, winning only three of their last 10 home games, and there is a feeling that their fans are still to be seduced by Europe's top club competition. City failed to sell out their first home game this season, a 1-1 draw with Roma in September, and resorted to a buy-one-get-one-free ticket offer for November's 2-1 loss to CSKA Moscow. But Nasri believes that it is only by seeing their team overcome sides such as Luis Enrique's Barcelona that City's supporters will come to love the competition. Asked if he had the impression that the club's fans were more enthused by the prospect of watching Premier League games, the former France midfielder replied: ""Yeah, I think so. ""Because we have a lot of success in the Premier League, so the fans are really passionate about that. ""In the Champions League, we need to create our history to have a special relationship with the fans. A game like Barcelona can be a step in the competition."" City manager Manuel Pellegrini confirmed that midfielder James Milner was ""100 percent"" fit after a knee problem, meaning that, aside from Toure, he has a full squad to choose from."
1362,23/02/2015,02:10,Saturday spills give City hope against Barca,Contrasting weekend results have given Tuesday's Champions League last 16 reunion between Manchester City and Barcelona at the Etihad Stadium a different allure to what might have been expected only days ago.,"Barcelona, 4-1 aggregate victors when the teams met at this stage last year, had found scintillating form since a l-0 loss to David Moyes's Real Sociedad on January 4, winning their next 11 games in all competitions. But that run came to a juddering and unexpected halt on Saturday when they lost 1-0 at home to Malaga in La Liga after a lacklustre performance completely out of keeping with recent displays. Roughly 40 minutes after the final whistle sounded at Camp Nou, City set about constructing a 5-0 victory at home to Newcastle United that allowed them to cut Chelsea's lead in the Premier League to five points. Following on from a 4-1 win at Stoke City, which had seen the English champions end a four-game winless run, the stylish victory, inspired by David Silva, provided further proof that their mid-winter slump has ended. For City manager Manuel Pellegrini, it was a sign that his side are once again a ""scoring team"", but for all the optimism the performance engendered, it will not erase memories of what happened the last time Barcelona crossed his path. Both games last season followed similar patterns, with Lionel Messi twice opening the scoring, Dani Alves twice adding a late goal, and City twice having a defender sent off -- Martin Demichelis in the first leg and Pablo Zabaleta in the second. Demichelis's dismissal at the Etihad, for a last-man foul on Messi that yielded a penalty from which the Argentine put Barcelona ahead, left Pellegrini apoplectic and he was given a two-game touchline ban by UEFA for accusing Swedish referee Jonas Eriksson of impartiality. But while Vincent Kompany's late goal in the return leg meant that City belatedly landed a blow on their opponents, there were few complaints about the aggregate scoreline. ""It is important not to make the mistakes that we made last year,"" said Pellegrini, whose club have never reached the quarter-finals. ""In both those games we played with one player less. In the knockout stage you have to not concede goals, and with a player sent off it is very difficult. You have to think of the match as being 180 minutes, not 90."" Now under the tutelage of Luis Enrique, Barcelona are much-changed, with the team configured to move the ball as quickly as possible to a devastating front three of Neymar, Luis Suarez and Messi, who has already scored 14 goals in 2015. When Barcelona have come unstuck this season, as against Malaga and Real Sociedad, it has tended to have been when teams have scored early against them and then defended en masse, but defender Gerard Pique believes City will not approach the tie so cautiously. ""It is one of the games of the year, the most important until now,"" said the former Manchester United centre-back. ""They will try to attack us and that suits us. It has been proven over the past few months that we are better against teams that attack us because we can counter-attack."" The hosts will be without Yaya Toure as he completes a three-game ban, but City's group-stage great escape -- a stirring 3-2 win against Bayern Munich, in which Sergio Aguero scored a hat-trick, and a 2-0 victory at Roma -- was orchestrated without the giant Ivorian in their ranks. With James Milner expected to return from a knee injury and January signing Wilfried Bony in line for his Champions League debut, City are otherwise at full strength, but Aguero, Zabaleta, Gael Clichy and Edin Dzeko are all one booking away from suspension. Barcelona's group-phase progress was rather more serene, despite a 3-2 loss at Paris Saint-Germain, and their only absentees are long-term injury victims Thomas Vermaelen and Douglas."

The Catalans remain a point behind Real Madrid at the top of La Liga, but could see the European champions extend their advantage to four points when they travel to Elche on Sunday. ""Defeats are harmful when you suffer them and they're hard to get over. We have a big challenge in three days and we will try to overcome it,"" said Enrique. It is the second time this season that Enrique's men have been stunned at home after also losing 1-0 to Celta Vigo back in November. However, unlike on that occasion when bad luck and an inspired goalkeeping performance by Sergio Alvarez denied Barca, Enrique admitted Malaga had been deserved winners on the day. ""We're used to these kind of games. I'd like it to be an accident but it is becoming habit, the opposition close up and we can't find a way through,"" he said. ""These kind of results are sometimes a good reminder that other sides have their qualities. You could consider this a deserved defeat."" Malaga's well-organised defence also frustrated Barca in a 0-0 draw earlier in the season meaning they become the first team since Getafe in the 2007/08 season to keep Barca scoreless over two games in La Liga. The four-time European champions dismissed City 4-1 on aggregate at the same stage of the competition last season and have since added the Premier League's top-scorer last season in Luis Suarez to a star frontline including Lionel Messi and Neymar. And defender Gerard Pique is hoping a more open game will suit the visitors at the Etihad stadium on Tuesday. ""It is one of the games of the year, the most important until now. They will try to attack us and that suits us. It is been proven we know how to counter-attack."" Defeat also meant Barca blew the chance to move to the top of the table for the first time since November. However, Enrique refused to write off their title chances with Madrid still having to visit the Camp Nou on March 22.

Having been Pep Guardiola's assistant during his glorious four-year reign in charge of the Catalans, Vilanova had led Barca to a record 100 points tally in winning La Liga during his only season in charge in 2012/13. ""He would have loved to have been here,"" said Vilanova's wife Montse Chaure. ""He said it was a privilege to coach the best team in the world and that he loved the players."" The naming ceremony was attended by the Barcelona first team as well as Vilanova's two children. ""From now on all the future generations that come to train at the Joan Gamper training ground ought to know who Tito Vilanova was,"" said Barca president Josep Maria Bartomeu."
1366,18/02/2015,20:01,Barca target Latin America with Telefonica deal,Barcelona have said they are targeting expansion in the Latin American market after agreeing a sponsorship deal with telecommunications giant Telefonica.,"The Spanish side announced on Monday that Telefonica had bought the club's television rights for next season for a reported 140 million euros (£103.7 million, $159.3 million) ending an eight-year relationship with Mediapro which owns the rights to most other La Liga sides. However, Barca will also receive 13.3 million euros for the next three seasons as a regional partner of Telefonica in Latin America with an option for the deal to be extended for another two years. ""The objective is to grow and create a stronger partnership in Latin America, a region that is key for the organisation's global expansion, and where Barca at the moment have more than 50 million fans,"" the club said in a statement on their website on Wednesday. As part of the agreement, Barcelona will play a friendly in South America for the next three years. Barcelona boast three of the region's most recognisable players amongst their squad in Argentina's four-time World Player of the Year Lionel Messi, Brazilian captain Neymar and Uruguayan striker Luis Suarez. ""One of the reasons why Telefonica have decided to take this step to join up with us is due to the players that we have,"" added Barca vice-president Javier Faus. ""We have the three players who form the most potent strike force in the world and that is very important for Telefonica. ""Telefonica allows us to reach more people, more places in the world and further afield. It is important for our growth that our content and our matches are seen by the maximum number of people in the world."" Barcelona slipped behind Manchester United and Bayern Munich into fourth place in financial consultants Deloitte's annual Football Money League report last month due to limited commercial growth compared to their rivals at the top of the European game. The announcement that broadcasters Sky and BT will pay £5.1 billion for the UK television rights to the Premier League from 2016-2019 has also led to fears that Barcelona and Real Madrid will struggle to compete with their English rivals for the world's top players as they have done over the past decade."
1367,15/02/2015,22:57,"Messi hat-trick fires Barca, Atletico beaten by Celta",Lionel Messi marked his 300th La Liga appearance with his 31st Barcelona hat-trick as the Catalans moved within a point of Real Madrid at the top of the table with a 5-0 win over Levante.,"However, champions Atletico Madrid remain seven points off the top in third after losing 2-0 at Celta Vigo. Barca have now won 11 straight matches in all competitions and never looked in danger despite coach Luis Enrique making eight changes from the side that beat Villarreal in the Copa del Rey in midweek. Messi teed up Neymar to open the scoring early on and then took over scoring duties himself to push out his all-time La Liga tally to 269 goals. Yet, even the Argentine was upstaged by a stunning overhead kick from substitute Luis Suarez to round off the scoring. Victory tied Pep Guardiola's best ever run of consecutive wins during his hugely successful four-year spell in charge at the Camp Nou. But Enrique insisted it is winning at the season's end which matters most. ""Records are obviously positive, but they don't interest me,"" he said. ""The players aren't overly euphoric because they know how hard it is to win titles. ""If the fans are euphoric then great. We need to be optimistic, but it isn't important how many games we have won. What counts is if they help us to win trophies."" Messi, Neymar and Javier Mascherano were the only survivors from Wednesday's 3-1 Cup semi-final, first leg win over Villarreal as Enrique continued to use the vast resources of his squad. Those changes did understandably provoke a subdued start, but Barca's luck was in on 17 minutes when Neymar mishit Messi's dinked pass over the Levante defence only for the ball to spin high into the air and drop into the far corner of the net. Messi didn't need the same fortune to make it 2-0 as Marc Bartra robbed the ball deep inside the Levante half and fed his teammate to slot home his 35th goal of the season. The four-time World Player of the Year doubled his tally just before the hour mark as Sergio Busquets's lovely pass into Pedro was turned across goal by the Spanish international for Messi to tap home. Neymar was then upended inside the area by Ivan Lopez and, having handed penalty taking duties to the Brazilian when Neymar missed from the spot in midweek, Messi wasn't going to give up the opportunity for his fifth hat-trick of the season as he sent Marino the wrong way. Suarez was introduced at Neymar's expense shortly afterwards and the former Liverpool man provided his own moment of brilliance 17 minutes from time as he caught Adriano's cross flush on the volley for just his fourth La Liga goal. Atletico were a shadow of the side that thrashed Real Madrid 4-0 last weekend as a fifth league defeat of the season all but ended their title hopes. Celta dominated the opening 45 minutes without creating a clear-cut opportunity, but they were handed the chance to open the scoring in controversial circumstances from the penalty spot as the referee missed a handball by Augusto Fernandez in the build-up before Nolito was upended by Mario Suarez inside the area. Nolito stepped up to send Miguel Angel Moya the wrong way from the spot and could only look on in disbelief moments later when Joaquin Larrivey somehow failed to turn his cross into an open goal. Atletico then came alive as Sergio Alvarez saved from Saul Niguez and Antoine Griezmann, but they were caught on the break 19 minutes from time when Michael Krohn-Dehli fed Fabian Orellana to drill the ball into the far corner. Valencia needed an Alvaro Negredo penalty 19 minutes from time to see off Getafe 1-0 and move back above Sevilla into fourth. The on-loan Manchester City striker cheekily chipped home the winner from the spot after he had been brought down by Juan Rodriguez. Villarreal's chances of a top four finish were dented, however, as they were undone by second-half goals by Alberto Bueno and Gael Kakuta in a 2-0 defeat at Rayo Vallecano."
1368,15/02/2015,21:30,Messi to be enjoyed - Luis Enrique,Barcelona boss Luis Enrique said he is savouring the chance to watch Lionel Messi after the Argentine notched his fifth hat-trick of the season in a 5-0 romp over Levante on Sunday.,"Messi was at the heart of the action as he teed up Neymar for the opener and then struck three times either side of half-time to take his tally for the season to 37 on his 300th La Liga appearance. Neymar was then replaced by Luis Suarez midway through the second-half and he also made his presence felt with a stunning overhead kick to round off the scoring. Enrique had made eight changes to the side that had beaten Villarreal in the Copa del Rey in midweek, but dismissed suggestions he could have also taken the chance to withdraw Messi after he had completed his hat-trick. ""The idea is to enjoy. That is what we are doing, enjoying him as much as possible,"" said Enrique. The four-time World Player of the Year has been unstoppable in 2015 with 14 goals and 10 assists in 11 appearances. That upturn in fortunes has coincided with Messi moving to a slightly wider position to allow Suarez to play as a central striker and Enrique lauded his ability to create as well finish. ""Against teams that play deep and with a lot of players in the middle of the field we need to have width and move the ball quickly to crate danger. ""It is key for us that Leo participates a lot, that he can have many touches to be able to create two or three on ones, makes passes and create space. ""When there are a lot of people in the middle it is harder for him to combine, so he has freedom to go where he can find space."" Enrique received criticism earlier in the season for his rotation policy, but he is beginning to look justified as Barca enter a decisive part of the campaign on the back of an 11-game winning run, whilst Madrid have faltered in recent weeks. ""That was an objective we had at the start of the season to have a big squad with so much quality,"" he said. ""Having so many quality players allows you to rotate. I would say that we have almost unlimited resources."""

The two South American stars combined once more 20 minutes later only for Messi to be wrongly flagged offside when he seemed set to double the hosts advantage. Messi didn't have to wait long for his first goal, though, as Marc Bartra robbed the ball deep inside the Levante half and fed his teammate to slot home his 35th goal of the season. The four-time World Player of the Year should have added to his tally before the break when he fired over from inside the area after Diego Marino had made a fine block from Pedro Rodriguez's original effort. Messi did add his second of the afternoon just before the hour mark as Sergio Busquets's lovely pass into Pedro was turned across goal by the Spanish international and Messi tapped home with his right foot.

However, Bartomeu said Braida will form a technical commission alongside former Barca boss Carles Rexach that will be tasked with preparing the club for their return to the transfer market ""Tomorrow we will make it official and explain it.

""Charles Rexach knows the club, the first team and the academy. ""Braida has great prestige, he has a lot of contacts and knows a lot of players. Together the two of them will do a great job."" Barca have been without a sporting director since the club's former goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarreta was sacked in January. Bartomeu insisted the club could sign players this summer as long as they don't register them until they are free to play the following January. ""We will look at what players we need to renew contracts, which players will come up from the B team, who could leave and look outside the club as well. ""We can sign players without registering them."""
1371,11/02/2015,22:49,Barcelona ease towards Copa del Rey final,Barcelona took a huge step towards a fifth Copa del Rey final in seven years with a 3-1 win over Villarreal in the first leg of their semi-final on Wednesday.,"Lionel Messi opened the scoring from Luis Suarez's cutback four minutes before the break, but Villarreal levelled shortly after half-time when Marc-Andre Ter Stegen failed to keep out Manu Trigueros's drive. However, Barca were back in front within a minute through Andres Iniesta and Gerard Pique's header 26 minutes from time made it 3-1. The Catalans could have had an even healthier advantage to take into the second leg on March 4, but Neymar had his penalty saved by Sergio Asenjo. ""I think it was a very good performance on our part against an opponent that was more defensive than we expected, but against a very good team. It is a good result, although it isn't definitive,"" said Barca boss Luis Enrique. ""It could have been even better with the penalty we missed, but it is a good result and deserved based on what we saw on the pitch."" Villarreal coach Marcelino meanwhile described his side's evening like a ""horror film"" having not only lost the match but captain Bruno and former Barca midfielder Jonathan dos Santos to injury. ""This game seemed lke a horror film. Barcelona took advantage of our mistakes and scored the type of goals we didn't expect. ""We have two injuries, one of which could be serious. I am sad for all these combined circumstances that mean we are much further away from reaching the final."" All of Villarreal's good defensive work in the opening 45 minutes was undone four minutes before half-time when Mateo Musacchio slipped to allow Suarez to rob possession and he squared for Messi to slot home his 11th goal in his last nine games. The roles were reversed a minute later as this time Messi freed Suarez inside the box, but the Uruguayan drove his low shot beyond the far post. For all their dominance, Barca nearly went in at the break level as Villarreal's only threatening counter-attack of the half ended with Ter Stegen making a fine save to turn Luciano Vietto's shot behind. However, the young German goalkeeper was very much at fault when Villarreal did equalise just three minutes after half-time when he failed to keep out Trigueros's thunderbolt from outside the area. The visitors were only on level terms for a minute as Suarez again created the danger when he claimed to have been fouled inside the area by Mario Gaspar and Iniesta swept the loose ball into the far corner. Another defensive error allowed Barca to extend their lead when Musacchio and Asenjo were caught flat-footed by Messi's corner and Pique headed home unmarked at the far post. Musacchio was also at fault seven minutes later when he handled as Messi tried to wriggle free inside the area. The Argentinian had missed from the spot in the previous round against Atletico Madrid and handed the responsibility to Neymar, but he too failed from 12 yards as Asenjo made a comfortable save low to his right. Suarez nearly rounded off the evening with a stunning effort from just inside the Villarreal half, but the ball floated just wide with Asenjo beaten."
1372,11/02/2015,02:20,Fans rally for Irish coaching legend 'Don Patricio',"An unmarked grave in London is all that is left to remember an Irish football coach cherished by British, Irish and Spanish supporters who are grouping together to raise funds for a new memorial.","The man known as 'Don Patricio' to a legion of Real Betis and Barcelona fans was born Patrick O'Connell in 1887 and went on to coach Barca during the Spanish Civil War -- the toughest period in the club's history. O'Connell's story is one of extremes. At the dawn of professional football, he achieved glory but abandoned a family in Ireland, formed a new one in Spain, and died poor in London in 1959. ""Patrick O'Connell was, in my opinion, an enigma. He had brilliant success in his career, but always had a dark side,"" Mike O'Connell, his grandson, told AFP. The coach lived out his final years at his brother's home in London after spending three decades in Spain, where he worked for Racing Santander, Real Oviedo, Real Betis, Barcelona and Sevilla. He is better remembered in Spain than in Ireland or Britain, where he is buried in St Mary's Cemetery in a dilapidated tomb in west London. Decades after his death, fans have joined forces to restore the tomb and build him a monument in Belfast in Northern Ireland, where he got a start in club football playing for Belfast Celtic. O'Connell went on to become the first Irish player to captain English giants Manchester United. He also played for the Irish national team, winning the British Home Championship of 1914, before Ireland's independence from Britain in 1916. ""We hope that this campaign will both raise awareness and also build a memorial befitting his football achievements,"" said Fergus Dowd, an Irishman and one of the organisers of the Patrick O'Connell Fund (www.pocfund.com). Dowd and his fellow campaigners get shirts signed by major players past and present -- Johan Cruyff, Franz Beckenbauer, Paolo Maldini and Andrea Pirlo, among others -- and auction them. His idea is to celebrate an event in each city linked to O'Connell's career. Real Betis, now in Spain's second division, have been heavily involved. The Seville club paid tribute to their former coach in December in a match against Racing Santander, 80 years after a 5-0 win against the same team won Betis the league title. ""Betis fans know who O'Connell is,"" said Julio Jimenez Heras, communications director for the club. ""The new generations of fans do not remember players from that team, but they know who O'Connell was. ""He was a man who liked the streets, who grew fond of the city. He had a very nice phrase about Seville -- the city 'where people live as if they were to die tonight'"". In 1935, O'Connell took the reins of Barcelona, signed by club president Josep Sunol. ""The Civil War surprised O'Connell as head of the team, with whom he toured throughout the Americas, and at the end of the war he was ostracised by the Francoist authorities,"" Barcelona say on their website. Most of the players stayed in Mexico and the United States, but O'Connell returned and coached the team until 1940. By then he had stopped sending money to his Irish family, who had not heard from him in a long time. On June 12, 1949, Spain played in Dublin, said Sue O'Connell, the wife of his grandson, Mike. His son Daniel ""went to visit the Spaniards after the game, pretending to be a distant relative, and asked for him"", she added. They knew him and told him that he lived in Seville. ""Times were hard in 1950. Daniel took a year to save money and went to Spain, to Seville,"" said Sue, who is looking to publish a book that she has written about her husband's grandfather. ""He found his father. But they did not get along... Although afterwards Dan joked, it hurt him."" O'Connell never divorced but got married again in Spain to an Irish woman. Descendants of his first family said they were ""proud"" of their relative. Remembering family meals, Sue said: ""It was strange, because he was not there, but they could not stop talking about it."""
1373,10/02/2015,14:21,Barca boss wary of dangerous Villarreal,Barcelona coach Luis Enrique has insisted his players should be well warned of the dangers posed by Villarreal in their Copa del Rey semi-final having been pushed all the way by the Yellow Submarine just 10 days ago.,"Villarreal travel to the Camp Nou for the first leg of the tie on Wednesday hoping to avenge the only defeat in their last 20 games in all competitions stretching back to November. A stunning Lionel Messi winner separated the sides on February 1, but Barca twice had to come from behind before eventually emerging 3-2 victors to remain just a point behind league leaders Real Madrid. ""We will analyse the league game and what things we could improve on to attack better and find more solutions,"" Enrique said on Tuesday. ""Perhaps that it is a bit easier because the game against Villarreal is so recent. ""We will go into the game with the same mentality as the league match, which is to win the game. We know it is a big game for Villarreal having never been in the semi-finals before, they are having a great season and will pose us plenty of difficulties. ""It is important not to concede given the value that away goals have, but our first objective is to win the game."" Holding Villarreal scoreless is likely to prove a mammoth task as Marcelino's men have found the net in each of their last 27 games. However, Barca have more than enough firepower to overcome the concession of an away goal with Messi, Neymar and Luis Suarez in fine form. All three were on target as Barca took their tally to 34 goals in winning their last nine games with a 5-2 victory at Athletic Bilbao, but it was especially important for Suarez to find the net after a five-game goalless streak. ""Luis Suarez is involved in almost all our attacks that end in a goal,"" added Enrique in defence of the club's record signing. ""We are very happy with what he offers us and I am sure he will only improve."""
1374,10/02/2015,02:30,Cup final place at stake for in-form Barcelona,Barcelona will be targeting a tenth consecutive victory and taking a big step towards the Copa del Rey final when they host Villarreal in the first leg of their semi-final clash on Wednesday.,"The Catalans have clicked into form ever since the club seemed on the brink of an institutional crisis following a dressing room revolt after a shock 1-0 defeat to Real Sociedad to start the year. Even more judicial activity against the club and its president Josep Maria Bartomeu for tax irregularities in the signing of Neymar hasn't disrupted Barca's rhythm. The Brazilian forward has played a starring role in the run alongside Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez. All three were on target in Sunday's 5-2 win at Athletic Bilbao as Barca closed to within a point of La Liga leaders Real Madrid, taking Luis Enrique's men's tally to 34 goals in their last nine games. ""We are getting better every day, but we need to continue working hard to improve,"" said Neymar, who has scored 23 times in 27 appearances this season. ""More than just the goals, the most important thing is to help my teammates. We can't stop now, we need to keep going."" Captain Xavi Hernandez returned to the side for Barca's first league victory in the Basque country since 2010 and the veteran is determined to keep their momentum going on all fronts, with a return to Champions League action against Manchester City also to come at the end of the month. ""We can't slip up. We already did that at Anoeta (against Sociedad) and now we feel great and depend on ourselves in the league. We are in great form and we need to make the most of it,"" said Xavi. Villarreal have already suffered at the hands of Messi and Neymar in recent weeks, but they gave Barca a scare as the hosts had to twice come from behind to win 3-2 at the Camp Nou on February 1. That was the Yellow Submarine's only defeat in their last 20 games, but coach Marcelino has warned that he will make changes from his side's 2-0 win over Granada with a top four finish in La Liga still their priority. ""We are in the semi-finals of the Copa del Rey and still in the Europa League, therefore we have to rotate players,"" he said. ""The key to this Villarreal is the squad, it is our biggest strength."" Enrique is also expected to rotate slightly with Andres Iniesta and Javier Mascherano likely to come into the side that started in Bilbao. In the other semi-final, Espanyol travel to face Athletic Bilbao later on Wednesday. Both sides are in mid-table in La Liga and know their only realistic chances of European football next season come from winning the Cup. Athletic defender Xabier Etxeita will be free to play despite being sent-off against Barca as his suspension only applies to La Liga, but the Basques are likely to be without the injured duo of Ander Iturraspe and Mikel Balenziaga."
1375,07/02/2015,14:32,Barca boss not bothered by off-field controversy,Barcelona coach Luis Enrique has insisted that more legal action against the club for their dealings in the signing of Brazilian star Neymar hasn't affected his preparations for their trip to Athletic Bilbao on Sunday.,"Cub president Josep Maria Bartomeu was charged with tax fraud by a Spanish judge on Tuesday, suspected of evading 2.85 million euros ($3.26 million) in a payment made to Neymar last year. Just 24 hours earlier, the club and former president Sandro Rosell, who resigned over the affair just over a year ago, were also accused of avoiding over 12 million euros in tax for declaring an incorrect transfer fee for the 22-year-old back in 2013. ""If there is something that this team is specialised in, given all the unfortunate things that have taken place in previous seasons, it is to distance themselves from negative situations,"" Enrique said on Saturday. ""We have had our best week of training since the season began. The last three sessions were of a very high level."" Barca have enjoyed a rare free midweek and come into the game on a fine run of eight consecutive wins, scoring 29 goals in the process. The Catalans also have the chance to gain ground on at least one if not both of their title rivals as Atletico Madrid host Real Madrid on Saturday. However, despite Athletic's disappointing campaign to date, Enrique is wary of dropping points in a city where Barca haven't won since 2010. ""They are a difficult team that won't allow us to have the ball easily. ""They are very dangerous in the air and from set-pieces. Playing away from home is always more difficult and they will make it hard for us. ""There is still a long way to go in the season. I think La Liga is competitive enough that there will be surprises between now and the end of the season."""

Lattek led Bayern Munich to their 1974 European Cup triumph and to three straight German league titles between 1972 until 1974. He then steered Borussia Moenchengladbach to the 1979 UEFA Cup and the German league titles in 1976 and 1977 before taking his Midas touch to Spain where he won the 1982 European Cup Winners' Cup with Barcelona. In total, he won 14 titles at the three clubs and along with Giovanni Trapattoni is the only coach to have won all three major European club titles. ""It is with deep sadness that I learnt of Udo Lattek's death,"" FIFA president Sepp Blatter tweeted. ""A coaching legend has passed away. My condolences to his family."" Wolfgang Niersbach, the president of the German Football Association (DFB), led the tributes from across Germany's football community. ""Udo Lattek was not only the most successful coach in the Bundesliga's history, but an outstanding personality of German football,"" he said. ""In 2012, the DFB honoured him for his life's work, because he had a decisive influence over decades of football. ""He will be remembered for the championships and titles he won as well as for his direct, but always endearing manner. ""Udo Lattek was a living legend, he will be missed."""
1377,04/02/2015,17:43,Barcelona wants deal with Qatar for 'many years',"Barcelona's vice-president on Wednesday appeared to contradict the club's boss by claiming that the Catalan giants want to retain a sponsorship deal with Qatar for ""many, many more years"".","Javier Faus said the club had ""zero problems"" with either the shirt sponsor, Qatar Airways, or the Gulf state itself, which has come under fire for its human rights record. He was speaking in Doha at a star-spangled launch of the latest marketing campaign involving the football club and the airline, with Brazilian superstar Neymar and Spain's 2010 World Cup and Euro 2012 winning central defender Gerard Pique in attendance. Last week, the club's president Josep Bartomeu created a stir when he said the club were sensitive to ""social and political aspects"" in Qatar. But Faus said the five-year, estimated 165 million euro ($190 m) sponsorship deal may be extended beyond next year when the initial contract runs out. ""We are extremely, extremely satisfied with Qatar Airways,"" he said. ""I can assure you there are zero, zero, zero problems with Qatar Airways, zero with Qatar and we definitely hope that this partnership lasts many, many, more years."" He added that a final decision on sponsorship would be made this year. Faus said the club had chosen Qatar ""of course"" for financial reasons, adding that Barcelona were operating in a very competitive arena where some of their rival clubs have unlimited resources. The deal, which has been criticised by some in Barcelona, comes to an end in 2016. He was backed by a bullish Qatar Airways Group Chief Executive, Akbar al-Baker who was also at the launch and suggested that Bartomeu, who has subsequently been named in a tax fraud probe in regarding the signing of striker Neymar, did not mean what he said about the political situation. ""I think we should ignore political statements,"" he said. ""You can see that we still have a partnership, we are promoting Barcelona, Barcelona is promoting Qatar Airways and we don't get carried away by comments of people who may say something which really they don't mean."" The deal was the first paid-for sponsorship in Barcelona's history. Initially, their shirt carried the name of the Qatar Foundation, a education non-profit organisation, but in 2013 this changed to Qatar Airways. There is likely to be even more focus on the sponsorship this year as this summer there is a presidential election at the Camp Nou. Bartomeu added last week that the club were ""obliged"" to look at other sponsors and said the social and situation in Qatar had ""changed"" since the deal was signed. Earlier this week, Bartomeu was named in an ongoing tax probe about whether or not he defrauded the Spanish tax office out of 2.8 million euros following the 57 million euro transfer of Neymar. On Wednesday, Al-Baker was also asked if the club would look into naming rights as part of any new sponsorship deal and he replied: ""Well, anything is possible with Qatar Airways, we are always full of surprises."" It was recently reported that Barcelona's great Spanish rivals, Real Madrid, were considering renaming their famous Santiago Bernabeu stadium following a sponsorship deal with an Abu Dhabi petroleum company. At the event -- which launched a new television advert for the airline featuring players including Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez -- Pique said he ""only had good words"" about Qatar when asked if he backed the controversial decision to award the 2022 World Cup to the Gulf state."
1378,04/02/2015,14:35,Barca link Neymar accusations to Catalan independence,Barcelona president Josep Maria Bartomeu has claimed the accusations against the club for tax evasion in the signing of Brazilian star Neymar are linked to their support of Catalan independence from Spain.,"Bartomeu was charged with tax fraud by a Spanish judge on Tuesday, suspected of evading 2.85 million euros ($3.26 million) in a payment made to Neymar last year. On Monday, the club and former president Sandro Rosell, who resigned over the affair just over a year ago, were also accused of avoiding over 12 million euros in tax for declaring an incorrect transfer fee for the 22-year-old back in 2013. ""I am convinced that there are certain powers of the state who didn't like the fact that he came to Barcelona, a Catalan club, and one that has participated in acts of support for Catalan independence,"" Bartomeu told regional television station 8tv. A historic symbol of Catalan nationalism, in recent years Barcelona offered their Camp Nou stadium to host a concert in support of independence and last season wore the the red and yellow colours of the Catalan flag on their away kit. They also wore the same kit this season at home to Athletic Bilbao in September to mark the 300th anniversary of the loss of Catalan sovereignty. Meanwhile, a number of the club's directors and players have shown their support for the independence movement. ""They haven't liked this and they have turned against us. We are paying a political price,"" added Bartomeu. ""Barcelona haven't done anything wrong."" Bartomeu also insinuated that Neymar's decision to join the four-time European champions instead of rivals Real Madrid has influenced the judicial proceedings. ""All this began with the actions of someone who didn't want him to come to Barca. ""Neymar's father has already said that he had an offer from Real Madrid that was even higher than that from Barcelona and they haven't liked this."" The controversy over the signing began with a complaint by one of the club's members against Rosell for misappropriation of funds. He then resigned in January 2014 when it was decided that case would go to court. In his testimony before a judge on in July of 2004, Rosell insisted that Neymar cost the club 57 million euros, 17 of which went to his former club Santos and 40 million paid to N&amp;N, a company owned by the player's father. However, the tax authorities believe the figure amounted to over 82 million euros in a number of different contracts. A former vice-president, Bartomeu succeeded Rosell following his resignation, but has called presidential elections for the end of this season due to rising pressure on his board. Despite the latest accusations, though, Bartomeu still intends to stand as a candidate for election. ""This doesn't change anything. I will continue to present myself at the elections come the end of the season."""
1379,02/02/2015,15:20,Barcelona accused of tax fraud in Neymar signing,Spanish public prosecutors have asked for Barcelona and their former president Sandro Rosell to be tried for two charges of tax fraud committed in the signing of Brazilian star Neymar.,"In a judicial file released on Monday, prosecutor Jose Perals Calleja suggests that Rosell and Barca declared an inferior fee to that which they paid for Neymar in 2013, whilst Rosell is also accused of an extra charge related to the signing."
1380,02/02/2015,14:34,Messi misses training due to 'personal reasons',"Four-time World Player of the Year Lionel Messi missed training on Monday due to ""personal reasons"", Barcelona have confirmed.","""Messi hasn't trained today, with the permission of the club, due to personal reasons,"" Barca said in a statement. The Argentine continued his fine form with the winning goal as Barca came from behind twice to beat Villarreal 3-2 on Sunday. Yet, it is just over a month since Messi missed another training session in front of the club's fans, claiming to be suffering from gastroenteritis, a day after he had been left on the bench for Barca's 1-0 defeat at Real Sociedad. His absence on that occasion sparked a mini-crisis at the club as speculation grew over coach Luis Enrique's future due to his frosty relationship with his star player. However, since then Barca have strung together eight straight victories to move into the semi-finals of the Copa del Rey and remain just a point adrift of La Liga leaders Real Madrid. Barca aren't in action again until Sunday when they travel to face Athletic Bilbao, so Enrique has given all of his squad Tuesday and Wednesday off ahead of a return to training on Thursday."
1381,01/02/2015,23:50,"Neymar, Messi lead Barca fightback against Villarreal",Barcelona moved back to within a point of La Liga leaders Real Madrid as they twice came from behind to beat Villarreal 3-2 in a thrilling encounter on Sunday.,"Madrid loanee Denis Cheryshev put Villarreal ahead against the run of play after half an hour only for the in-form Neymar to level just before the break. A crazy four-minute spell early in the second-half then yielded three goals as Luciano Vietto put Villarreal back in front, but Rafinha quickly equalised before Lionel Messi struck a memorable winner from the edge of the box. Victory takes Barca back three points clear of third-placed Atletico Madrid, but Real can regain their four-point lead at the top when they host Sevilla in their game in hand on Wednesday. ""For us it is a pleasure to have players that can change the game and they are in special form,"" Barca boss Luis Enrique said of Messi and Neymar, who have now scored 17 goals between them in their last seven outings. However, Villarreal boss Marcelino lamented his side's inability to put the pressure on Barca by conserving their leads for a prolonged period of time. ""We played a great match and competed with them using our own strengths. The goal they scored 30 seconds before half-time damaged us. Then within two minutes of going 2-1 in front they scored two. ""That is Barca. They have the best players in the world in attack and punish any error you make."" Barcelona started brightly but Luis Suarez's struggles in front of goal continued as the Uruguayan failed to hit the target twice when well-placed inside the area, as well as seeing a fine strike from the edge of the area turned behind by Sergio Asenjo. The hosts were then punished for the former Liverpool man's profligacy when Villarreal broke and Mario Gaspar's wayward effort was deflected beyond Claudio Bravo by Cheryshev. Crucially Barca managed to get on level terms a minute before the break when Asenjo again parried from Rafinha's curling effort, but Neymar was on hand to continue his scoring streak with his 22nd of the season. Enrique's men were caught out once more at the start of the second-half, though, as a former Barca favourite Giovani dos Santos galloped in behind the Catalans' defence and squared for Vietto to apply a simple finish. However, again Villarreal couldn't hold onto their lead for long as just two minutes later Suarez squared for Messi and when his headed effort was blocked, Rafinha pounced to rattle home from close range. Suarez then teed up Messi once more as Barca turned the game on its head moments later when the Argentine fired high past Asenjo on his weaker right foot from outside the box. Villarreal refused to give in and briefly thought they were level when Mateo Musacchio bundled home from close range only to be denied by an offside flag. From the resulting free-kick Barca sped upfield and Neymar was unlucky not to win a penalty when he was wiped out by Asenjo before Suarez failed to turn Dani Alves's driven cross on target. A first defeat in 19 games in all competitions leaves Villarreal now four points adrift of Sevilla in the final Champions League spot. Earlier, the Andalusians exacted revenge over Espanyol for their Copa del Rey elimination in midweek as they came from behind to move above Valencia into fourth with a 3-2 win. Cristian Stuani put the visitors in front from the penalty spot before goals from Diogo Figueras and Vitolo turned the game around. Espanyol 'keeper Kiko Casilla was then sent-off for handling outside his area just before half-time. Victor Sanchez gave Espanyol hope of an unlikely point when he curled home 13 minutes from time, but Iago Aspas had the final say when he latched onto substitute Carlos Bacca's through ball to finish low into the far corner in the 89th minute. Levante dropped to the bottom of the table as two second-half goals from Aritz Aduriz handed Athletic Bilbao a 2-0 win at the Ciutat de Valencia. Almeria moved out of the relegation zone as a solitary goal from Edgar was enough to earn three points in a 1-0 win over Getafe."

""He was born last night. Both mother and baby are well,"" the source said on Friday. ""It seems the baby will be called Sacha."" Sacha, whose birth weight has not yet been announced, is a younger brother for the celebrity couple's first child Milan, who turned two a week ago. The clinic had been surrounded by reporters for several days in anticipation of the birth, which Spanish media reported was by Caesarean section. Spanish international defender Pique, 27, met Shakira while she was filming a video of her song ""Waka Waka"" for the South Africa World Cup in 2010. Her other hits include ""Whenever, Wherever"" and ""Hips Don't Lie"" with rapper Wyclef Jean."
1383,29/01/2015,09:14,Barca edge nine-man Atletico in five-goal thriller,Neymar bagged a double as Barcelona twice came from behind to book their place in the semi-finals of the Copa del Rey with a 3-2 win over nine-man Atletico Madrid to seal a 4-2 aggregate victory.,"Fernando Torres struck for the hosts inside the first minute to cancel out Lionel Messi's winner in last week's first leg, but Neymar grabbed a vital away goal just nine minutes later. Raul Garcia briefly restored Atletico's lead from the penalty spot, but Barca were in front by half-time thanks to a Miranda own goal and a wonderful counter-attack rounded off by Neymar. Atletico captain Gabi was then sent-off during half-time as players and coaches from both sides clashed at the end of the first period. The home side should have been reduced to nine men earlier when Arda Turan somehow escaped with just a yellow card after throwing his boot at one of the officials in the second-half, but did eventually see another red card when Mario Suarez picked up a second booking late on. ""I liked the way the team reacted after conceding in a strange way in the first minute,"" said Barca boss Luis Enrique. ""Neymar showed the attitude he always does. He is a player with a lot of confidence and helps us all in all phases of the game."" Torres scored twice in the first minute of each half of the second leg as Atletico dumped city rivals Real Madrid out of the competition in the previous round and he repeated the trick after just 38 seconds. The former Chelsea striker latched onto Guilherme Siqueira's clearance and skipped past Javier Mascherano before volleying in off the far post to register his first goal at the Vicente Calderon since rejoining his boyhood club. Barca responded in fine style to that early blow, though, as a slick move sparked by Messi saw Luis Suarez release Neymar in behind the Atletico defence and he calmly slotted home for his 20th goal of the season. Atletico were given a lifeline when Juanfran was bodychecked by Mascherano and Jesus Gil Manzano pointed to the spot despite the contact appearing to take place outside the area and Garcia confidently stepped up to slam home the spot-kick. The lead again only lasted only eight minutes, though, as Miranda could only turn Messi's corner into his own net. The game then turned definitively in Barca's favour when Manzano didn't award a second penalty when Griezmann's shot hit Jordi Alba on the arm. Barca then broke upfield and Alba squared for Neymar to dance round Jan Oblak before rolling home his second goal of the evening. Tempers flared when Manzano brought an exhilarating first-half to an end with Gabi failing to return for the second period having been sent-off in the tunnel. ""I just said to the referee it was a penalty and a red card, you will see on TV that you have made a mistake,"" Gabi told Canal Plus. ""Then he told me that I was sent-off. I didn't say anything else. The team was left with an numerical disadvantage and you could see that in the second-half."" Diego Simeone's men were extremely fortunate to not then go down to nine men when Turan incredibly threw his boot at an assistant referee for failing to award the hosts a free-kick. The Turkish international was shown a yellow card by Manzano, which should also mean he will escape retrospective punishment as the incident was seen by the referee. Barca comfortably saw out the remaining 40 minutes by dominating possession and should have added to their tally when Messi shot straight at Oblak 20 minutes from time. Suarez was then dismissed four minutes from the end when Messi was upended for the umpteenth time as Atletico continued to lose their discipline. Next up for Barcelona will be a semi-final meeting with Villarreal or Getafe, who play the second leg of their quarter-final on Thursday."

Although his relationship with Barcelona partners Lionel Messi and Neymar seems good the Uruguayan has failed to match the form which saw him score 31 goals for Liverpool last season. ""All players have failures at some times in a match. Luis Suarez can have very good statistics and he will have them, I'm certain,"" said Enrique ahead of their Liga trip to Elche on Saturday. ""In the area and outside, I've seen few players move better than Luis Suarez. Why would I be worried?"" Suarez on Wednesday missed a chance to score in Barcelona's 1-0 Spanish Cup win against Atletico Madrid despite being alone on front of goal. But the fans have continued to support the player who arrived after the World Cup from Liverpool for EUR81 million. ""These are periods that all strikers know, suddenly it's like the goal isn't that near. But he has opportunities in each game, he gives us a lot and we're delighted with his performance."" ""When a player changes country and team, it's about adapting and there is no magic formula. He's perfectly integrated into the team on a daily basis. No aspect of Luis Suarez's game worries me and I'm sure he's going to score goals."" Barcelona are second in La Liga one point behind Real Madrid."

However, Juanfran was penalised for kicking Sergio Busquets inside the area late on and Messi was relieved to slot home at the second attempt after seeing his penalty saved by Jan Oblak. The two sides will meet again at the Vicente Calderon in Madrid on Wednesday, January 28. ""It's a good result, but we've got the return leg to go and that will be another intense 90 minutes,"" said Barca midfielder Andres Iniesta. ""We've put in a great shift against a team that's really difficult to overcome. ""We're happy to win 1-0. Keeping a clean sheet is very important, but it doesn't guarantee anything."" Atletico boss Diego Simeone remains confident that his side's tremendous home form can see them turn the tie on its head. ""We still have a chance against an opponent that played very well. The tie is still very open,"" he said. Fernando Torres was paired once more with Antoine Griezmann up front for Atletico after the pair combined to allow Torres to score in the opening minute of each half as they secured a 4-2 aggregate win over Real Madrid in the last 16 a week ago. However, just like in their league meeting 10 days ago, it was Barca who made a fast start this time and Atletico goalkeeper Oblak was forced into a fine save to turn Neymar's curling effort behind after just four minutes. Atletico weathered the early storm without any further scares and grew into the game. Torres saw a low shot deflect wide off Gerard Pique, whilst Guilherme Siqueira's cross from the left was just too high for Griezmann as the Frenchman's header sailed harmlessly over. Barca's best chance of the opening half arrived 10 minutes before the break when Ivan Rakitic's ball into the box landed at the feet of Luis Suarez, but he somehow blazed over with just Oblak to beat from point-blank range. Torres then failed to find Griezmann as he gifted the ball to Pique to end a promising break and that was to be the former Chelsea striker's last involvement as he was replaced at half-time by Mario Mandzukic. A similar pattern ensued after the break as Barca enjoyed plenty of possession without being able to create many clear-cut chances against the well-organised ranks of Atletico defence. Oblak was alert to a low drive by Andres Iniesta from the edge of the area, but Barca's frustrations began to bubble over as both Suarez and Javier Mascherano were booked for taking the protests towards the referee too far. However, Jose Luis Gonzalez rightly pointed to the spot when Busquets was upended by Juanfran seven minutes from time and despite a fine save by Oblak to stop Messi's penalty, the Argentine followed-up to slot home the rebound. Barca could have taken an even greater advantage to the Calderon had Miranda not got a touch to divert a Messi cross towards Neymar into Oblak's grateful arms moments later."
1388,20/01/2015,14:53,"Goals will come for Suarez, insists Barca boss",Barcelona coach Luis Enrique has backed Luis Suarez to come good in front of goal despite the Uruguayan's paltry record of two league goals since becoming the most expensive signing in the club's history.,"Suarez has only made 15 appearances in all competitions since his reported £75 million ($114 million, 98 million euros) move from Liverpool in July after serving a four-month ban for biting Italian defender Giorgio Chiellini at the World Cup. However, since his return he has failed to show the same form that saw him register 31 Premier League goals last season. Suarez missed two glorious chances as Lionel Messi stole the headlines with his 30th hat-trick for the club as Barca eased past Deportivo la Coruna 4-0 on Sunday, but Enrique praised Suarez's work rate and insisted his class will ensure a return to goalscoring form sooner rather than later. ""Luis Suarez looks fine to me,"" Enrique said ahead of his side's Copa del Rey quarter-final, first leg against Atletico Madrid on Wednesday. ""He is working incredibly hard and helping us a lot both in attack and defence. ""The goals will come for sure because he is a goalscorer and has shown that throughout his career."" One of Suarez's two La Liga goals came against Atletico just over a week ago when Barca turned in arguably their best performance of the campaign to beat the Spanish champions 3-1. The pressure had been mounting on Enrique prior to that game with reports of Messi leading a dressing room coup against the former Barca captain. However, he shrugged off suggestions that his position could be back under the spotlight should the Catalans fail to produce a repeat performance against Diego Simeone's men. ""I don't have the feeling that tomorrow my job is on the line. All we are playing for is to get through a tie against an opponent that will demand we play at our best level. ""On an emotional level it helps us that we were able to beat them after not doing so six times last season, but I don't think it will influence too much what happens on the pitch."" Enrique will be able to call on the experience of Xavi Hernandez after overcoming a calf injury that has kept him out of the last four games, but defender Jeremy Mathieu remains out."

""Messi has been at an extraordinarily high level all season,"" said Barca boss Luis Enrique, despite reports of a dressing room rift between the two in recent weeks. ""He hasn't dipped at any point. He has been world class."" In a change from his much criticised rotation policy, Enrique named the same side that beat Atletico 3-1 at home last weekend and was rewarded with another bright display illuminated by Messi's class in front of goal. The Argentine's first effort of the game was brilliantly saved by Fabricio after a well-worked corner, but the Deportivo goalkeeper was helpless when the four-time World Player of the Year opened the scoring after 11 minutes with a thunderous header from Ivan Rakitic's cross. Messi then showed a more subtle touch for his second with a delicate chip over the prone Fabricio to double Barca's advantage from Neymar's pass. However, by contrast, Luis Suarez's troubles in front of goal continued as he fluffed his lines twice in the first-half with just Fabricio to beat. Messi showed the Uruguayan how it should be done once more when he rounded off his 30th hat-trick for the club after the break when he cut inside onto his favoured left foot and fired into the far corner before an own goal from Deportivo defender Sidnei rounded off the scoring. Real had to wait over an hour to make the breakthrough at the Alfonso Perez Coliseum before Ronaldo fired home from Karim Benzema's wonderful assist to set them on the road to victory. ""It is true at the start we didn't play with a lot of intensity,"" said Real boss Carlo Ancelotti. ""At the start we played a bit slow, but I liked the performance because the team played with intelligence and much better in the second-half than the first. ""I think the whole team played well, but the assist by Karim (Benzema) opened the game up for us. It was extraordinary."" After a sluggish start the European champions were denied by a series of fine saves by Getafe goalkeeper Jordi Codina either side of half-time, whilst Toni Kroos also struck the bar just before the break. However, Codina's resistence was finally broken just before the hour mark with a brilliant team goal as Isco and James Rodriguez combined to free Benzema and the Frenchman produced an exquisite piece of skill on the byline to cut the ball back for Ronaldo to slam home. Just four minutes later it was 2-0 as this time Rodriguez was the provider with a fine low cross that Gareth Bale prodded past Codina with the outside of his left foot. And another sumptuous cross from Rodriguez 11 minutes from time allowed Ronaldo to plant a firm header past the helpless Codina to register his 36th goal of the season. Atletico were less impressive as they laboured to victory against a Granada side that hasn't won in La Liga since September leading to the sacking of coach Joaquin Caparros on Friday. The opening goal arrived 11 minutes before half-time when Diego Godin was hauled down by Abdoul Sissoko as he tried to reach Fernando Torres's cross and Mandzukic smashed home the resultant penalty for his 16th goal of the season. Atletico enjoyed more control of the game after the break and finally sealed the points three minutes from time when substitute Garcia bundled home Arda Turan's cross at the back post."
1390,17/01/2015,15:00,Crisis will return with a bad result - Luis Enrique,Barcelona boss Luis Enrique has laughed off suggestions the club have come through an institutional crisis thanks to their best performance of the season to beat Atletico Madrid 3-1 last weekend.,"Enrique's job was believed to be on the line against the Spanish champions with his relationship with star player Lionel Messi at breaking point. Ironically, it was a Messi-inspired display that saw off Diego Simeone's men as he scored once and set up Neymar and Luis Suarez as all three of Barca's star forward line found the net in the same game for the first time in La Liga. ""Nothing has changed. As soon as we lose or draw the party will start again,"" Enrique said on Saturday. Victory last weekend kept the Catalans just a point adrift of Real Madrid at the top of the table, although the European champions also have a game in hand. Barca will reach the halfway mark of their league season away to Deportivo la Coruna on Sunday and Enrique is aware of the need for all three points to maintain the pressure on Madrid. ""We're missing tomorrow's result, but until now the evaluation is positive. We need to get to February or March with a chance to win titles and we are on course for that. ""What we expect are the logical differences of a game away from home. The state of the pitch seems like it won't be perfect and that is a handicap. ""Then you have the opponent, who are having a good season and trying to get away from the relegation zone. They will create us problems in some phases of the game."" Neymar is a doubt for the trip to the Riazor as he continues to recover from a nasty looking ankle injury picked up against Atletico. Jeremy Mathieu will definitely miss out due to an Achilles problem, but Xavi Hernandez should be fit for selection after taking a full part in training on Saturday."
1391,14/01/2015,15:03,Barca planning future with Messi - Luis Enrique,Barcelona coach Luis Enrique is insisting a future without star player Lionel Messi has never been considered as speculation over the Argentine's future continues to mount.,"Tensions have been simmering at Barcelona with the coach insisting Messi play a wider role in the line-up. Messi had appeared to rule out a move following a stunning individual performance in Sunday's 3-1 win over La Liga champions Atletico Madrid. ""I have never demanded anything to ensure that I stay because I have never had any intention of leaving,"" he told Barca TV. However, the following day he fuelled the rumour mill once more by saying ""I don't know where I'll be next year"" during a press conference ahead of the Ballon d'Or gala in Zurich. ""I don't know what the future will bring,"" said Enrique when asked if he thought Messi would win a fifth Ballon d'Or whilst at Barcelona. ""We all think that Messi will be at Barcelona for the coming years, it is what all the fans want. We are not even planning a squad without Messi."" The speculation has arisen due to a reported breakdown in communications between Messi and Enrique. Messi was left on the bench as Barca fell to a shock 1-0 defeat in their opening game of the year away to Real Sociedad and then missed training the next day, claiming to have suffered from a stomach bug. Later that day he followed Chelsea and two of their players Thibaut Courtois and Filipe Luis on social media site Instagram and sources in the Catalan press then claimed Messi had met with Barca president Josep Maria Bartomeu to ask for the former Barca captain Enrique to be replaced as coach. Both Messi and Bartomeu have since denied those claims, with the former particularly aggrieved that the reports surfaced in the Catalan press. ""It hurts me because it comes from here, from Barcelona, from people that love the club, or say they do. It doesn't come from Madrid like it has in the past,"" said Messi. ""It is not good that they look for rivalry between Luis Enrique and I because there isn't any."" And Enrique repeated his assertion that there is no division in the dressing room ahead of a demanding schedule in the coming weeks as Barca battle to advance in the Copa del Rey and the Champions League, as well as clawing back a one-point deficit on La Liga leaders Real Madrid. ""The dressing room is united. We avoid the controversy and look for the best atmosphere possible. ""That is what we look for, although we know that things can change in five seconds. I see unity in every aspect."" Enrique's men are back in action on Thursday night when they face Elche in the second leg of their last 16 of the Copa del Rey. The match should be a mere formality with Barcelona having won the first leg 5-0 last week and Enrique confirmed that a host of the club's academy players would get a chance to prove their worth with a much tougher test in either Real Madrid or Atletico Madrid lying in wait should Barca progress to the last eight."
1392,13/01/2015,04:44,Messi admits he could leave Barcelona,"Lionel Messi saw arch-rival Cristiano Ronaldo beat him to the Ballon d'Or in Zurich Monday and then reignited speculation over his own future by saying: ""I don't know where I'll be next year.""","Barcelona and Argentina superstar Messi appeared to row back on his own comments made 24 hours earlier that rumours that he could leave the Camp Nou for Chelsea or Manchester City were ""all lies"". ""I always said that I would finish my career at Barcelona and then at (his home town club in Argentina) Newell's,"" Messi told reporters after Real Madrid's Portuguese icon Ronaldo lifted the world footballer of the year title for the second year in succession at a glittering FIFA awards ceremony. ""But I don't know where I'll be next year. ""As Cristiano (Ronaldo) said recently, football has many twists and anything can happen,"" added the Barca talisman, who himself won the Ballon d'Or four years in a row from 2009. After a superb performance in Barcelona's 3-1 win over Spanish champions Atletico Madrid on Sunday, Messi had angrily dismissed talk that he wanted to leave after clashing with Barca's manager Luis Enrique and the club's board. ""I have never demanded anything to ensure that I stay because I never had any intention of leaving,"" he told Barca TV after the match. Messi's relationship with Enrique had come under scrutiny after the forward was benched for the 1-0 defeat at Real Sociedad a week earlier. The rumours grew after Messi missed the first training session after that match, citing a stomach bug. ""I have heard it said that my dad has spoken to Chelsea or Manchester City. It is all lies. I have taken this chance to deny it so that everyone knows the truth,"" Messi said Sunday. But his latest comments are sure to regenerate interest from a number of cash-rich English Premier League clubs. Manchester United are reportedly one of the few that could afford the buyout fee from his contract, reportedly set at 250 million euros (195 million pounds, $296 million), without falling foul of UEFA's financial fair play rules. With Messi commanding a reported salary in the region of 20 million euros a year the total cost of acquiring his services on a five-year deal could be a world record-shattering 350 million euros."
1393,12/01/2015,01:52,"I'm not going anywhere, fires indignant Messi",Four-times World Player of the Year Lionel Messi shot back angrily Sunday at rumours that he could leave Barcelona after clashing with coach Luis Enrique and the club's board.,"The Argentine was in top form with a goal and two assists as the Catalan giants ended and unsettling week off the field with a crucial 3-1 win over La Liga champions Atletico Madrid. ""I have never demanded anything to ensure that I stay because I have never had any intention of leaving,"" he told Barca TV after Sunday's match. ""I have heard it said that my dad has spoken to Chelsea or Manchester City. It is all lies. ""I have taken this chance to deny it so that everyone knows the truth."" Messi had missed training on Monday, citing a stomach bug, after being left on the bench by Enrique for last weekend's 1-0 defeat to Real Sociedad. And he sent the rumour mill into overdrive later in the day by following Chelsea and two of their players Thibaut Courtois and Filipe Luis on social media site Instagram. Sources in the Catalan press then claimed Messi had met with Barca president Josep Maria Bartomeu in midweek to ask for the former Barca captain Enrique to be replaced as coach. ""I am grateful to be able to give my version of events,"" he said. ""It hurts me because it comes from here, from Barcelona, from people that love the club, or say they do. It doesn't come from Madrid like it has in the past. ""It is not good that they look for rivalry between Luis Enrique and I because there isn't any,"" Messi added. ""We need to be more united than ever, the fans and us. We have an important six months ahead to achieve good things for us and for the club."" Any doubts over Enrique's job in the short term were blown away by arguably his side's best performance in his seven-month reign. Messi teed up Neymar to slot home the opener after 12 minutes and then repeated the trick to allow Luis Suarez to register just his second La Liga goal. The Argentine inadvertently handed Atletico a route back into the game when deemed to have brought down Jesus Gamez inside the area on the hour mark and Mario Mandzukic slammed home from the penalty spot. Messi made amends when he slotted home the clinching goal from close range three minutes from time to move Barca back to within a point of Real Madrid at the top of La Liga. ""This win has a special value because it is against a direct rival for the league,"" Suarez said. ""At the moment the self-confidence in the team is good. This win will gives us a big boost because it came against Atletico Madrid. ""It is spectacular to play with Messi and Neymar, just like the rest of my team-mates. We have achieved a great victory."""
1394,12/01/2015,00:14,Barca star trio down Atletico to ease crisis talk,"Lionel Messi, Neymar and Luis Suarez were all on target as Barcelona eased talk of a club crisis with a 3-1 win over La Liga champions Atletico Madrid on Sunday.","Messi shrugged off speculation surrounding his future at the Camp Nou to cross for Neymar to scramble home the opener and then tee up Suarez to register just his second La Liga goal. The Argentine also handed Atletico a route back into the game, though, when he was adjudged to have brought down Jesus Gamez inside the area on the hour mark and Mario Mandzukic slammed home from the penalty spot. However, Messi made amends by sealing the three points when he slotted home from close range three minutes from time to move Barca back to within a point of Real Madrid at the top of La Liga. Atletico are now four points adrift of Real, who also have a game in hand over both their title rivals. Barcelona had failed to beat Atletico in six meetings last season and wouldn't have been looking forward to facing Simeone's men after an unsettling week at the Camp Nou. A 1-0 defeat to Real Sociedad last weekend was followed by sporting director Andoni Zubizarreta's sacking and the club's under fire president Josep Maria Bartomeu calling club elections for the end of the season. Meanwhile, reports suggested defeat could have cost Barca boss Luis Enrique his job with relations between him and Messi at breaking point after the Argentine missed training on Monday. And Enrique acknowledged that he will only silence his critics by continuing to put a winning team out on the field. ""Victories are the only thing that can calm the situation,"" he said. ""I need to transmit the best idea of how to play football to my players and be as competitive as possible. If we are capable of winning titles or not will be the judge of my era."" Atletico boss Diego Simeone, meanwhile, lamented his side's slow start. ""I think there were two games. In the first-half Barca were better, dynamic and intense. We played badly in the first-half,"" said the Argentine. ""In the second-half we were competitive. It was much closer to what we normally are in the second. We scored and could have got an equaliser, but in the end the third goal finishes the game."" In the end Messi did his talking on the pitch as Barca's star-studded South American frontline guided them to victory. Barca went in front on 12 minutes when the four-time World Player of the Year danced past Gamez and pulled the ball across goal. Suarez failed to make a proper contact, but Neymar was on hand to sweep home his 17th goal of the season. Atletico 'keeper Miguel Angel Moya then kept his side in the game with a fine double save to firstly parry Jordi Alba's fierce drive and then block Suarez's effort on the rebound. The visitors were on the ropes in the first 45 minutes and teenage centre-back Jose Maria Gimenez was lucky to escape unpunished when he flew in dangerously on Neymar to leave the Brazilian with a bloodied ankle. Neymar missed a guilt-edged chance to double Barca's advantage midway through the half when he headed wide with the goal at his mercy after brilliant play by Messi and Suarez. However, when the second goal did come, Atletico had a right to feel hard done by as Messi appeared to use his hand to speed past Gamez before sliding the ball through for Suarez to slot home. Referee Alberto Undiano Mallenco balanced up that perceived injustice on the hour mark, though, as he pointed to the spot when Gamez went down under a challenge from Messi. It was the first time that Messi had ever conceded a spot-kick in La Liga and Mandzukic didn't pardon him as he slammed high into the roof of the net. Fernando Torres was introduced by Simeone as Atletico searched for an equaliser and he was only denied a ninth goal in 12 games against Barca by Claudio Bravo's quick-thinking as the Chilean 'keeper rushed from his line to intercept Mandzukic's dangerous low cross. But in a week where he has dominated the headlines, Messi rounded off his fine performance with a first goal against Atletico in eight games when he pounced on a loose ball inside the area to side-foot home."
1395,10/01/2015,14:56,I'll leave if players don't back me - Luis Enrique,Barcelona coach Luis Enrique claimed he hadn't been affected by rumours that he could become the latest high-profile exit from the Camp Nou should his side fail to beat Atletico Madrid on Sunday.,"However, the 44-year-old said he would step down after just seven months in the job if he felt he no longer had the backing of his players. ""There are so many reports, some of them badly intentioned,"" he said on Saturday. ""I won't get involved in this dangerous game. What I can guarantee is that the day I see that my players don't follow me, I will leave."" A destabilising week for the Catalan giants began with a shock 1-0 defeat to Real Sociedad last weekend after Luis Enrique had left nearly 300 million euros ($355m, £234m) of talent, including Lionel Messi and Neymar, on the bench. The unrest at the Camp Nou kicked into overdrive on Monday when sporting director Andoni Zubizarreta was sacked, his assistant and club legend Carles Puyol resigned and Messi then missed an open training session with the club's fans. The Argentine sparked transfer rumours by then following Chelsea on the social networking site Instagram, while reports emerged that his relationship with Luis Enrique is at breaking point. On Wednesday, club president Josep Maria Bartomeu called early elections for the end of the season in response to the increasing pressure on his position. On the field there was some respite as Barca eased towards the quarter-finals of the Copa del Rey with a 5-0 thrashing of Elche on Thursday. However, the coach's name was booed by the home fans as they showed their support for Messi. ""I continue to be concentrated and motivated. There is nothing that will distract me,"" Luis Enrique added. ""All that I see behind closed doors motivates me. The players and the technical team remain on the fringes of all that. We are used to it. ""Tomorrow we are playing for three important points, but three points all the same. I feel the same as on my first day."" Barca and Atletico are tied on 38 points in second place, one point adrift of La Liga leaders Real Madrid, who also have a game in hand. However, by contrast to the crisis enveloping Barcelona, Atletico arrive in the Catalan capital full of confidence after beating Real Madrid for the third time this season 2-0 in the Cup on Wednesday as Fernando Torres made his first appearance since returning to the Vicente Calderon. Diego Simeone's side were unbeaten in six meetings against Barca last season as they sealed La Liga at the Camp Nou in May and also dumped Gerardo Martino's men out of the Champions League. And Luis Enrique expects another serious test this weekend. ""Atletico don't look vulnerable. They have added players and they all defend very well. ""We don't have that luck. I expect it will be a game like the ones last season, although with a different result. ""We need to attack and defend well because it will be a difficult game."""
1396,07/01/2015,17:13,Barcelona president calls elections at end of season,"Barcelona president Josep Maria Bartomeu has called club elections for the end of the season in a bid to ""ease the tension"" surrounding the embattled Catalan club.","Bartomeu took over as president a year ago after Sandro Rossell resigned following the controversy over the signing of Brazilian striker Neymar which led to the club being accused of tax fraud. The current board's mandate was due to run until 2016, but Bartomeu has come under fire in recent weeks after Barca's appeal against a one-year transfer ban by FIFA for irregularities in the signing of players under the age of 16 was rejected by the Court of Arbitration for Sport. On Monday, Bartomeu sacked sporing director Andoni Zubizarreta and former captain Carles Puyol resigned from his position as Zubizarreta's assistant."
1397,07/01/2015,14:09,No regrets for Barca boss amid rumours of Messi bust-up,Barcelona coach Luis Enrique insisted he had no regrets over his handling of the Catalans' star-studded squad this season amid reports his relationship with Lionel Messi is at breaking point.,"Enrique left the four-time World Player of the Year on the bench for Barca's 1-0 defeat to Real Sociedad on Sunday and wanted to discipline the Argentine after he missed an open training session with the club's fans on Monday citing a stomach bug, according to Barcelona sports daily Sport. ""I don't have anything to regret at the moment with any of my players. Every coach has to manage his squad as he sees fit. The primary objective is to win titles and we are on that road,"" Enrique said at a press conference on Wednesday. ""I am not going to confirm or deny these stories or supposed stories that appear because they are too varied and there are too many of them. ""What I have to do is do my job the best I can and in the manner I think is best for the team and the club."" Barca are still very much alive in three competitions as they sit just one point adrift of La Liga leaders Real Madrid, albeit having also played a game more, and face Elche and Manchester City respectively in the last 16 of the Copa del Rey and Champions League. Enrique denied that he had been given an ultimatum by the club's underfire president Josep Maria Bartomeu that his job would be on the line if they don't beat Spanish champions Atletico Madrid at home on Sunday. However, he claimed that the sacking of sporting director Andoni Zubizarreta on Monday by Bartomeu had weakened his position. ""The future of a coach always depends on results, that is the first thing they teach us on coaching courses,"" he added. ""I feel I have the backing of the club and the players."" The root of Barca's meltdown in recent days started when Messi and Brazilian stars Neymar and Dani Alves were given two extra days off than the rest of the squad during the winter break. All three players returned to Spain just 48 hours before Barca's match in San Sebastian and were among nearly 300 million euros worth of talent left on the sidelines by Enrique, also including Ivan Rakitic and Gerard Pique. The former Roma boss repeated his belief that Messi is the best player in the world, but said there were certain rules which all his squad had to abide by. ""In the same way that I don't treat all my children the same, I don't treat all my players in the same way. That would be a mistake, but there are rules for everyone."""
1398,05/01/2015,18:16,Puyol quits Barcelona's sports management post,"Former Barcelona captain Carles Puyol said Monday he was leaving the Spanish giants' sport management team, which he joined in May, after he quit the squad because of a knee injury.","The announcement by the iconic 36-year-old came about an hour after Barcelona announced it had sacked its football director Andoni Zubizarreta who was under contract with the club until 2016. ""I have decided to end my working relationship with FC Barcelona,"" Puyol wrote on his Facebook page. ""I hope to grow both personally and professionally so that, in the future, I can return to this house and give back everything that you have undoubtably given me during these unforgettable years,"" he added. ""I remain enormously grateful to the employees, the management, the president and the sports management for trusting me and helping me during this transition which is not easy."" Puyol announced in March that he would rescind his playing contract at the end of the 2013-14 campaign due to a knee injury and in May the club announced that he had joined its sports management team. He joined the Barcelona first team in 1999 and is the club's second most decorated player of all-time, behind only teammate Xavi Hernandez, having made 593 appearances. After beginning his career as a right-back, Puyol was converted into one of the most successful centre-backs in world football over the past decade as he won three Champions Leagues and six La Liga titles with his boyhood club. Puyol was also a key part of the Spanish sides that won the European Championship in 2008 and the country's first World Cup in 2010, memorably heading home the goal that took his side to the final in South Africa with a 1-0 win over Germany."

1400,05/01/2015,00:57,Moyes hails Barca conquest his 'happiest night',Real Sociedad's David Moyes lauded the heroic efforts of his players who beat Barcelona 1-0 on Sunday thanks to a Jordi Alba own goal in a day of shocks in La Liga.,"Earlier, Real Madrid's 22-game winning streak was ended by a 2-1 defeat to Valencia meaning both giants of the Spanish game were beaten on the same day for the first time since April 30, 2011. However, despite their lowly league position of 13th, Sociedad have shown themselves well capable of upsetting the odds having now defeated Barca, Real and champions Atletico Madrid at home under three different coaches. And Moyes believes his challenge now is to draw that level of performance out of his players on a more consistent basis. ""It is the happiest night since I arrived in San Sebastian. We worked very hard. The players showed courage and defended incredibly,"" said the Scot. ""This team has shown it is capable in the big games against the best teams in the league and now we must show the same capability to win the other games. At home, for example, we have let a lot of points slip away. ""We defended well tonight and that is what we have to do in all the games, but in other games when we don't have to defend so much we also have to pass the ball and attack better."" Barca boss Luis Enrique paid a heavy price for leaving both Lionel Messi and Neymar amongst nearly 300 million euros of talent on the bench. Both South American stars only arrived back in Spain on Friday after an extended Christmas break and Moyes defended his counterpart's decision to only introduce them after the break. ""The best players can't always play at their best level in every match. The biggest games for Barcelona are still to come and in that sense I think Luis Enrique made the right decision. ""I was hoping this would happen, that some of their most important players wouldn't start and we were prepared for that."" Enrique also refused to accept that he had made an error with his starting line-up as Barca had more than 70 percent of possession and 17 efforts on goal, but failed to take their chances. ""To feel sorry afterwards doesn't help anyone. I took the decision to avoid risks with players that made a long journey only a few days ago. ""I thought it was better not to risk it and we will never know if things would have been different if I had made a different decision. ""I can only remember the goal and then us dominating. There weren't that many chances, but I think we deserved more. We didn't have the luck or the clarity we needed in front of goal."" A third league defeat of the season means Barca remain a point behind leaders Real Madrid having also played a game more than the European champions."

Munir El Haddadi and the in-form Pedro Rodriguez will accompany Luis Suarez in attack against David Moyes's men."
1402,03/01/2015,16:02,Transfer ban an opportunity for youngsters - Enrique,Barcelona coach Luis Enrique believes the club's famed academy can help minimise the impact of a ban on signing players for a year handed down by FIFA.,"The Catalan giants lost their appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport to have the ban overturned this week for irregularities in the signing of players under the age of 16. Barcelona, who are second behind Real Madrid in La Liga, are banned from buying players during the January transfer window and for the summer transfer period before the 2015-16 season. That means they cannot sign a player until January 2016. Enrique started his managerial career with Barca B under Pep Guardiola and has already handed debuts to Munir El Haddadi, Sandro Ramirez and Sergi Samper in his first six months in charge at the Camp Nou. And he believes that the trio and others from the side that won the under-19 Champions League last season can make the step up to the first team on a regular basis. ""It is evident that we would have preferred another decision, but it is what it is and we have to get on with it,"" he said on at a press conference ahead of Barca's visit to Real Sociedad on Sunday. ""The quality of the squad is good enough with the players that we have and we have to bear in mind that this is a great incentive for the youth team players. ""There are players in the academy that I like and that could certainly make the step up. The fact we can't sign players for next season very clearly opens the door to the young players."" Of more pressing concern for Enrique is to ensure that his side don't lose more ground on league leaders Real Madrid at a ground where their title challenge began to unravel last season. Sociedad boss David Moyes will get his first taste of testing himself against one of La Liga's giants at Anoeta and, despite a mixed set of results since the Scot took over in November, Enrique insisted he has seen an improvement in the Basque outfit under the former Manchester United manager. ""Real have recovered their intensity and the aggression in their pressing,"" he added. ""We have to go there and be very intense because if we are not then we will suffer."""
1403,30/12/2014,12:20,Barcelona to appeal transfer ban,"Barcelona said Tuesday it could make a new appeal against the ""disproportionate"" one year transfer ban ordered by FIFA to a Swiss court.","The Spanish team said it ""totally disagrees"" with the FIFA ban upheld on Tuesday by the Court of Arbitration for Sport. Barcelona were punished by FIFA over the signings of players aged under 18. The ban covers two transfer windows and means the team cannot sign a player until January 2016. ""FC Barcelona wishes to state, with all due respect for the sports authorities, that it totally disagrees with the verdict of the Court of Arbitration for Sport,"" said a Barcelona statement. Barcelona acknowledged that it had made ""errors"" but said these were ""of an administrative nature and to a large extent have been caused by the existing conflict between the FIFA regulations and Spanish legislation, along with the club's conviction that it was acting correctly. ""FC Barcelona considers the sanction to be completely disproportionate"" and ""excessive"". Barcelona said that when it had the full details of the CAS ruling, it would ""study and assess the various legal options available, including the possibility of using the CAS arbitration route to the Swiss Federal Tribunal."""
1404,30/12/2014,11:30,Appeal court enforces Barcelona transfer ban,The Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) on Tuesday backed a one year transfer ban against Barcelona in a major blow to the Spanish football giants,"The court said in a statement that it had ""dismissed"" an appeal made by Barcelona against the ban imposed by FIFA in April for breaching rules on signing players aged under 18. Barcelona, who are second behind Real Madrid in La Liga, are banned from buying players during the transfer window that opens on January 1 and for the summer transfer period before the 2015-16 season. That means they cannot sign a player until January 2016. Barcelona were also fined 450,000 Swiss francs ($455,000, 375,000 euros). The Spanish federation was also reprimanded by FIFA. ""The panel found in particular that FC Barcelona had breached the rules regarding the protection of minors and the registration of minors attending football academies,"" said the statement. ""The FIFA decision is confirmed in full and the sanction remains in force."" The CAS panel promised to give the full reasons for its decision as quickly as possible. FIFA announced the ban in April this year after an investigation into several players aged under 18 who were registered and played for Barcelona between 2009 and 2013. It found that Barcelona and the Spanish federation were guilty of a ""serious"" infringement of rules for 10 players. Barcelona made a first appeal to the FIFA disciplinary committee and the sanction was suspended enabling them to make major signings such as Luis Suarez from Liverpool for 95 million euros ($115 million). The club spent more than 150 million euros in all before FIFA's appeal committee upheld the ban. Barcelona then went to the CAS and asked for an emergency procedure so that a decision was announced before the January transfer window opens. Barcelona are one point behind Real Madrid but have played one game more. Atletico Madrid in third place are just three points behind."

Success against strugglers Cordoba would lift Barca to within a point of leaders Real Madrid, who are on Club World Cup duty in Morocco."
1408,13/12/2014,18:41,Barcelona slip up in Getafe stalemate,Barcelona's La Liga title hopes suffered a blow as they fell four points behind leaders Real Madrid after being held to a disappointing 0-0 draw at Getafe on Saturday.,"In a bitty first half at the Coliseum Alfonso Perez the visitors were indebted to goalkeeper Claudio Bravo, who kept his side on level terms with a top-drawer save from an Angel Lafita effort. Barca improved after the break and piled on the pressure, yet were unable to find a way past Vicente Guaita with Lionel Messi striking the bar from a free-kick and some resolute defending from the Getafe back line. ""The draw isn't a great result, but the side came into the game with a positive dynamic and we have to carry on that way. There's still a long way to go in the league, but admittedly it's a step backwards,"" said Barcelona captain Xavi Hernandez. ""It is a game we can normally get a result in, but we couldn't make the breakthrough. Defensively they were really strong, we had four chances and couldn't take any of them. ""We've got a lot of goals in attack, but today it just wouldn't go in for us."" In a match played out in unforgiving conditions, Barcelona desperately missed the attacking presence of Neymar, who was absent through an ankle injury, and notably lacked a cutting edge in the final third as they were frustrated by the home side's defence, who were able to limit the Blaugrana to few clear-cut chances. The Catalan outfit saw a couple of long-range efforts fly over from Luis Suarez and Ivan Rakitic, before Messi forced a block from Guaita in the home side's goal after combining well with the Croatia international as they sought to make the breakthrough. Guaita could then only punch a cross as far as Pedro Rodriguez on the edge of the box, but the Spain international's mishit effort was turned just wide by Suarez, who is still looking for his first Liga goal. Both sides then felt aggrieved not to be awarded a penalty within a minute of each other as firstly Juan Valera appeared to handle the ball while on the ground as Messi looked to dribble past him, before in the next attack Lafita's cross struck Dani Alves on the arm. Referee Inaki Vicandi Garrido was unmoved on both occasions. As the half wore on Getafe took the initiative, and the home side were unlucky to not go into the break leading after Lafita beat Alves and Pique on the edge of the box, only to see a rasping drive somehow tipped round the post by Claudio Bravo at full stretch. Barcelona came out for the second half with more attacking intent, and went close to opening the scoring after Messi, who had been brought down by Emiliano Velazquez on the edge of the box, saw a free-kick clatter the crossbar before Suarez fired wildly over from distance. Guaita then kept out another Messi effort as the pressure grew, with Xavi volleying just wide and Messi heading over when well positioned. However, despite the introduction of Andres Iniesta and Munir El Haddadi, they couldn't find the breakthrough as Getafe held on bravely for a point. On Friday, two late Cristiano Ronaldo goals helped Real Madrid make it 20 consecutive victories in all competitions as they saw off Almeria 4-1 at the Estadio de los Juegos Mediterraneos. First-half goals from Isco and Gareth Bale either side of Verza's stunning equaliser sent the visitors in ahead at half-time, but they needed a big save from captain Iker Casillas when he parried Verza's penalty on the hour mark. Ronaldo then sealed the win when he turned home crosses from Karim Benzema and Dani Carvajal to take his La Liga tally to 25 goals this season."

The 22-year-old, who scored in Wednesday's 3-1 Champions League win against Paris Saint-Germain that allowed Barca to go through to the last 16 as winners of their group, withdrew from training on Friday. Luis Enrique's side head to Getafe in second place in La Liga and lay two points behind Real Madrid before the leaders' game at Almeria on Friday.

One of the two victims remained in hospital. The attacks come less than two weeks after a Deportivo fan was killed after being beaten and pushed into a river during clashes outside Atletico Madrid's Vicente Calderon stadium before a La Liga match between the two sides. The Spanish government sacked the security heads of the two clubs after the death and Spain's Football Federation and the government-controlled Higher Sports Council have said tougher sanctions for clubs over violent behaviour by supporters will come into force on December 15. Barcelona won the match 3-1 but both sides qualified for the last 16 knockout stages of the competition."
1411,10/12/2014,22:45,Barcelona down PSG to secure top spot,"The attacking trio of Lionel Messi, Neymar and Luis Suarez were all on target as Barcelona came from behind to beat Paris Saint-Germain 3-1 on Wednesday in their Champions League Group F decider.","Both sides had already qualified for the last 16, but first place was still up for grabs, with the French champions needing just a point at the Camp Nou and Barcelona having to win. When Zlatan Ibrahimovic put the visitors ahead against his old club on 15 minutes, PSG appeared to be in control, but Barcelona's all-star front line all weighed in with goals to swing the match back the home side's way and ensure that Luis Enrique's side go through to next Monday's draw as group winners. Messi equalised just four minutes after Ibrahimovic's opener, before Neymar put the hosts ahead on 42 minutes and Suarez secured the victory 13 minutes from time, ending PSG's record as the last club in Europe's leading leagues still to be unbeaten in all competitions this season. With both sies having already qualified ahead of the final round of games, PSG coach Laurent Blanc had admitted that his men would be able to play with more freedom, as long as they could get the ball from their hosts. Barcelona monopolised possession right from the start, but PSG took the lead with their first shot on target, Ibrahimovic beating Marc-Andre ter Stegen with a first-time effort on his left-foot after Blaise Matuidi had laid off a Lucas ball in from the right. It was the Swede's 12th goal of an injury-hit campaign and the first time he had ever scored against Barcelona, the club with whom he spent a year under Pep Guardiola in 2009-10. However, Barcelona were quickly back level, Messi arriving at the back post to convert after neither David Luiz nor 'keeper Salvatore Sirigu had cut out Suarez's first-time ball across the six-yard box. Messi now has 75 Champions League goals, and 76 in all European competitions, equal with the all-time record mark of former Real Madrid star Raul. Enrique's decision to start with a back three left plenty of space for PSG to exploit in wide areas and they had chances to reclaim the lead. First when Matuidi's ball in from the left was struck wide by Lucas and then when Edinson Cavani connected with an Ibrahimovic assist from the other side, forcing a save from ter Stegen. However, the Catalans displayed their fearsome attacking firepower at the other end Sirigu beat away a Suarez shot before Neymar put them in front three minutes prior to the break. The Brazilian was released by Andres Iniesta before advancing and curling a superb shot beyond Sirigu into the right corner of the net for his third goal in the competition this season. It remained an enjoyably open contest in the second half and the French champions almost equalised in the 53rd minute when Lucas broke into the area, only for ter Stegen to deny the Brazilian before Cavani's follow-up was blocked practically on the line by Marc Bartra. Blanc sent on Javier Pastore and Ezequiel Lavezzi for midfield duo Marco Verratti and Matuidi as his side went in search of the equalising goal that would have put them back on top of the group. Yet it was Barcelona who scored again in the 77th minute, with Suarez getting on the scoresheet at the Camp Nou for the first time since joining the club from Liverpool in the summer. When Neymar's shot was turned out by Sirigu, Suarez was on hand to convert the rebound, securing the win and sealing revenge for a 3-2 defeat in Paris at the end of September."
1412,09/12/2014,15:56,Enrique plays down importance of top spot,"Barcelona coach Luis Enrique on Tuesday branded Wednesday's Champions League clash against Paris Saint-Germain as ""not crucial"".","Barca trail the French champions by a point in Group F and must win the Camp Nou encounter in order to finish top of the pool, thus theoretically securing an easier draw in the second round. Both sides have already qualified for the knock-out stages. ""It's an important match but not the most important of the season. There will be a lot of others,"" said Enrique. ""This match has only relative importance because there will be nothing definitive. ""You'll see that there will be some teams coming second in their groups who can qualify. ""I'd prefer to be first but it's not a definitive advantage. I don't think it's crucial."" Although he was not playing up the importance of winning the game, Enrique vowed to attack the Parisians, despite admitting he is concerned about being caught on the counter-attack. ""The idea is to attack, as ever. We want to win, as we try to do every game. ""But Paris have the same aspirations, they're a candidate to win the title. ""So we know they're opponents who will ask us a lot of questions. ""We have to avoid being caught on the counter, we have to be balanced and not attack too much. ""That's the theory, but the practice is more difficult because you can fall in love with the ball."" Enrique also played down the significance of PSG's star striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic's return to the club where he spent one season -- deemed in some quarters to have been unsuccessful, despite Barca winning the title that year, in 2009/10. The big Swede missed the return fixture in Paris in September, in which the Catalans were beaten 3-2. ""In the first game, PSG won without Ibra. They have a squad full of quality that surpasses one single player,"" said Enrique. ""But with him, they have more potential. It's the top level. If he plays to his best, he'll be difficult to control. ""But if we play as a team, he'll see less of the ball. But we know he's an incredible player, fantastic."""
1413,09/12/2014,02:15,Enrique hopes PSG defence wilts under Barca fire,"Barcelona's hopes of beating Paris Saint-Germain and leapfrogging them to finish top of their Champions League group rests on troubling the French champions' defence more than they did in the 3-2 defeat in Paris, claimed coach Luis Enrique.","PSG -- who came from behind to beat Nantes 2-1 on Saturday, ensuring they remained the only unbeaten team in the major European leagues -- top the table by a point and a draw will suffice to see them win their Champions League group for the third successive season. Barcelona, who prevailed in a tightly-fought quarter-final between the teams in the 2012/13 campaign, progressing on away goals, will be compelled to go for goals but enter the game on the back of a crushing 5-1 derby win over Espanyol, in which Lionel Messi scored a hat-trick. However, Enrique, who played with PSG coach Laurent Blanc at Barcelona, said that his forward line would have to be more clinical than they were in the entertaining defeat in Paris. ""I hope that their defence will suffer a little more at the Camp Nou than was the case in the first game,"" said the 44-year-old, who took over after Gerardo Martino was sacked following a trophyless season last term. ""I hope that we will deserve the victory, and the only way to do that is by showing our superiority on the pitch."" For Enrique, who played for both great Spanish clubs Real Madrid and Barca in his career, the match with PSG is the type of challenge he relishes and gives his players a test of their ability to beat the best. ""For us, the match against Paris Saint-Germain is a marvellous match, indeed it is perfect for us,"" he said. ""It presents us with an opportunity to beat the team that is the leader in the group, and who beat us in the first meeting. We know whatever the score is, a win is enough for us and we are going to rise to the occasion as we have done since the beginning of the season."" Enrique, who began his coaching career with the Barcelona B team before spells with Serie A side Roma and then Spaniards Celta Vigo, warned that his team would not be able to throw caution to the wind, though, especially with former Barca striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic facing them and in sparkling form. ""They have got Ibrahimovic back (he was injured for the game in Paris) and several other important players were rested ahead of this game. ""I am expecting a side not unlike the the one we played in Paris and with lots of attacking possibilities."" Enrique is likely to keep faith Dutch goalkeeper Marc-Andre Ter Stegen, as he has done throughout the Champions Leaue campaign, but will hope he is more on his game than he was in Paris. Blanc will have virtually a full pack of cards to choose from in terms of personnel but the former France national coach is praying his players are not as dopey as they have been at times in Ligue 1 this season, and was the case against Nantes. ""We will have to be much more aggressive and determined in Barcelona,"" said Blanc. ""I managed this match (against Nantes) with one eye on the next game. It's ok because we won but sometimes we are playing with fire."" The good news for Blanc is that despite his long lay-off Ibrahimovic has not lost his sharpness in front of goal, as illustrated by his double against Nantes. ""Even an Ibra at 90 percent is a handful for most teams,"" said the club's Brazilian captain Thiago Silva. PSG will certainly hope that is the case on Wednesday."
1414,07/12/2014,19:02,Messi follows Ronaldo with another hat-trick,A third Lionel Messi hat-trick in four games helped Barcelona keep the pressure on La Liga leaders Real Madrid as they recorded a 5-1 victory over local rivals Espanyol on Sunday.,"After falling behind to Sergio Garcia's early strike, Barcelona then took control of the Catalan derby. Messi's 21st Liga treble, which took him to within two of Cristiano Ronaldo's record of 23 set on Saturday, a Gerard Pique header and neat finish from Pedro, was enough to see Barca take the spoils and leapfrog Atletico Madrid in second place with 34 points. Real still lead the table with 36 points after a 3-0 win over Celta Vigo on Saturday. Despite having not won at the Camp Nou since 2009 it was the visitors who started the brighter, creating the game's first chance after eight minutes, however Jordi Alba was able to clear Garcia's cross with Lucas Vazquez poised to tap in from close range. Barcelona did not heed the early warning, and they soon found themselves behind. Felipe Caicedo challenged Sergio Busquets just inside the Barcelona half, and as the Camp Nou waited for a whistle that never came from referee Ignacio Iglesias Villanueva, Sergio Garcia ran directly at a static Pique before firing past Claudio Bravo to stun the hosts. It was Espanyol's first goal at the home of their illustrious neighbours since Ivan De La Pena's double saw them record a 2-1 win there five years ago. Barcelona then reacted, with Xavi Hernandez, Neymar and Ivan Rakitic all seeing chances come and go as they began to dominate play. After being brought down on the edge of the box, Messi saw the resulting free-kick bounce off the crossbar with goalkeeper Kiko Casilla beaten, and it only seemed a matter of time before the home side equalised. Casilla then denied Pique and Alba as Barcelona pushed on, however they were almost made to pay five minutes before the break. Espanyol broke at pace, however Victor Sanchez's heavy touch when latching onto Vazquez's through ball allowed Bravo to close down the space and keep his side in the game. It was to prove a pivotal save as, on the stroke of half time, Messi equalised with the kind of goal that Barcelona have made their trademark. Jordi Alba cut inside from the left, feeding Xavi Hernandez, who in turn laid the ball off to the Argentine who swept home from just outside the box. With the momentum firmly behind them, Barcelona came out firing in the second period, and thought they had a penalty within 60 seconds of the restart when Eric Bailly brought down Neymar, however Iglesias Villanueva was unmoved. The Brazilian, who was a menace throughout, then combined with Luis Suarez to find Messi on the edge of the box five minutes after the break, and the 27-year-old rifled a right-footed effort past a hapless Casilla to knock the wind out of their opponents' sails. Two minutes later the advantage was doubled as a Rakitic corner was met by Pique, and from there on there was only one winner. With 13 minutes remaining an Alba diagonal ball found substitute Pedro Rodriguez, who had earlier replaced Suarez, and the Spain international made no mistake to further stretch Barca's lead. Nine minutes from time Messi capped off a fine afternoon as he scored his third, and his side's fifth, following a give and go with Pedro."

""His recovery time will be around four months."" The former Arsenal captain moved to Spain in a reported 19 million-euro (£15m, $23.7m) deal in August. The 29-year-old Belgian international's only appearance so far since his high profile move was in a friendly game for Barcelona's reserves in September. He is now set to make his long-awaited official debut for his new club in April. Vermaelen suffered a series of fitness setbacks during his five-year Arsenal career where he missed virtually the whole of the 2010-11 campaign. He featured in the Belgium squad which reached the World Cup quarter-finals in Brazil although injury ruled him out of the 1-0 loss to Argentina in the last eight."
1416,30/11/2014,23:56,Busquets grabs last-gasp victory,Barcelona snatched a vital 1-0 win away to Valencia on Sunday thanks to Sergio Busquets's volleyed winner deep into stoppage time.,"The Spanish international pounced after Diego Alves had made a great save from Neymar's header to ensure Barca close to within two points of leaders Real Madrid. And on a day overshadowed by the death of a Deportivo la Coruna fan in violent clashes before Atletico Madrid's 2-0 win over the Galicians, there were more unsavoury scenes at Mestalla as Lionel Messi was struck on the head by a plastic bottle thrown from the crowd with Barca celebrating the winner. A first home defeat of the season means Valencia remain nine points off the top in fifth. ""We were lucky to score in the last minute. These are three points that will give us a huge boost,"" Busquets told Canal Plus. ""We never settle for a draw, we tried in every way possible and in the end it came from a corner. We had been attacking them for a few minutes and when the ball fell to me from Alves I gave it everything I had."" Valencia boss Nuno Espiritu Santo, meanwhile, was left to lament the chances his side failed to convert in the second-half. ""We had good moments in the match and very clear opportunities to score. Barca also had chances to give them their due,"" he said. ""But we had such clear chances and could easily have won."" Barca boss Luis Enrique signalled how exacting a test he expected his side to face by naming Javier Mascherano alongside Busquets in midfield for the first time in his tenure. However, they struggled to control the game in the early stages as Rodrigo forced Claudio Bravo into an early save with a rasping drive. Barca slowly grew into the game, but their better chances arrived via long balls towards Neymar, while Luis Suarez ought to have put the visitors in front on 14 minutes. Neymar laid Gerard Pique's pass from the back into the path of the Uruguayan, but he fired straight at Alves with just the Brazilian goalkeeper to beat. Barca were then fortunate not to be reduced to 10 men when Neymar appeared to headbutt Nicolas Otamendi, but the incident went unseen by referee Fernandez Borbalan. Andre Gomes twice came close to giving Valencia a half-time lead as he curled a shot from the edge of the area just wide before firing into the side-netting from a narrow angle after rounding Bravo. The hosts also started the brighter after the break, but Rodrigo failed to connect with a volley when well-placed inside the area. Suarez passed up another great chance when he anticipated Otamendi's header back to Alves and robbed the ball ahead of the keeper, but then shot into the side-netting with the goal gaping. Moments later it was Valencia who came close as the game swung from one end to the other, Pique clearing Rodrigo's drive off his own goalline. Suarez's frustrating night continued as he was wrongly flagged offside when he did finally find the net from Dani Alves's cross. Yet, in their push for a winner, Barca were opened up on the counter-attack and had Bravo to thank for making a fine save to prevent Sofiane Feghouli from opening the scoring. The Chilean keeper had to be at his best again 12 minutes from time to beat Alvaro Negredo's sweetly struck volley to safety. And those interventions were to prove crucial as three minutes into stoppage time Alves parried Neymar's header from Messi's tempting cross and Busquets was on hand to force the ball home despite the goalkeeper's best efforts to keep it out."

""Thomas Vermaelen will undergo surgery on the right semi-tendinous muscle (hamstring) in his right leg next Tuesday in Finland. The estimated recovery time is 4 to 5 months,"" said a Barcelona statement. Vermaelen suffered a series of fitness setbacks during his five-year Arsenal career where he missed virtually the whole of the 2010-11 campaign. He featured in the Belgium squad which reached the World Cup quarter-finals in Brazil although injury ruled him out of the 1-0 loss to Argentina in the last eight."
1418,25/11/2014,22:49,"More history for Messi, Suarez nets first goal in Barca win",Lionel Messi became the all-time top goalscorer in the Champions League with a hat-trick and Luis Suarez registered his first goal for Barcelona in a routine 4-0 win away at APOEL Nicosia on Tuesday.,"Suarez finally got on the scoresheet in his fifth appearance since a club record move from Liverpool in July with a fine turn and finish on 27 minutes. However, he was upstaged by his Argentine teammate as Messi surpassed Real Madrid legend Raul's mark of 71 goals just days after also becoming the top scorer in the history of La Liga when he stabbed home Rafinha's mishit shot 10 minutes later. Messi added his second of the evening just before the hour mark before both sides were reduced to 10 men as Rafinha and Joao Guilherme saw second yellow cards. And fittingly it was Messi who had the final word as he turned home Pedro Rodriguez's low cross three minutes from time to take his tally to 74 Champions League goals in 91 games. PSG's 3-1 victory over Ajax means that Barca need to win when they host the French champions in two weeks' time to secure top spot in Group F. Despite having lost three of their previous four matches in the group, APOEL had shown plenty of resistence in losing by just the one goal twice against PSG and away to Barca on matchday one. However, they were swept aside with ease by Luis Enrique's men who confirmed an upturn in their form of late after thrashing Europa League champions Sevilla 5-1 on Saturday. Messi had a great chance to break the record inside two minutes when he shot straight at Urko Pardo in the APOEL goal. Barca's captain for the evening then teed up Suarez with a low cross, but Pardo did well to get down to stop the Uruguayan's fierce low effort before Jordi Alba volleyed well off target from another wonderful Messi pass. After providing four assists in his first four Barca matches, Suarez finally found the net when he turned his marker on the edge of the area before slotting past the helpless Pardo into the far corner. Ten minutes later Messi made more history when he turned home Rafinha's effort with his right foot to eclipse Raul's mark having played 51 fewer Champions League games than the Spaniard. Barca's domination continued after the break and resorted to provider for Pedro seven minutes after the restart, but the Spanish international pulled his effort inches wide. Messi was more clinical when he latched onto Dani Alves's through ball to squeeze the ball past Pardo to double his tally for the evening. Marc-Andre ter Stegen had enjoyed a blissfully quiet evening in the Barca goal, but he was suddenly called into action 24 minutes from time as he flew to his right to deny Tomas De Vincenti. Rafinha was then first to be given his marching orders as he chopped down De Vincenti from behind before Guilherme balanced up the numbers when he clumsily brought down Pedro six minutes from the end. And there was still time for Messi to further embellish his historic night as, knowing he was in an offside position, he intelligently let Xavi's through ball roll into Pedro's path and was then on hand to slot home his cut-back to complete his hat-trick."
1419,25/11/2014,21:39,Messi breaks Champions League scoring record,Lionel Messi became the all time leading goalscorer in the Champions League just four days after achieving the same feat in La Liga with his 72nd goal in the competition against APOEL Nicosia on Tuesday.,"Messi was captaining Barca on the night and stabbed home his side's second goal of the evening from close range on 37 minutes after Luis Suarez had opened his account for the club with the opener. The Argentine moves ahead of Raul, who scored 71 goals in 142 appearances for Real Madrid and Schalke, with Cristiano Ronaldo just one goal further back on 70. Messi now hold both scoring records at just 27 years of age and reached the new record mark in 51 fewer games than Raul with both men having won the tournament three times. The four-time World Player of the Year broke Telmo Zarra's 59-year-old record of 251 La Liga goals at the weekend with a hat-trick in a 5-1 thrashing of Sevilla to take his tally in the Spanish top flight to 253 goals in 289 appearances. Messi recently celebrated the 10th anniversary of his debut with the Catalan giants, a period which has seen him win 21 trophies. However, he cast some doubt on his future with the club last week when he refused to rule out a move away from the Catalan capital before the end of his career despite signing a new four-year contract in May. ""Football is full of unexpected twists and turns,"" he told Argentinean newspaper Ole. ""It is true that I said I would like to stay there forever, but sometimes not everything turns out the way you want."" Barca boss Luis Enrique played down fears he could leave, though, describing him as a ""unique and unrepeatable player."""
1420,25/11/2014,21:30,Luis Suarez scores first Barcelona goal,Luis Suarez finally registered his first Barcelona goal since a club record move from Liverpool in July with a brilliant solo effort to open the scoring away to APOEL Nicosia in the Champions League on Tuesday.,"The Uruguayan turned his marker on the edge of the area before firing a low finish across Urko Pardo to break his duck on his fifth appearance for the Catalan giants on 27 minutes. Suarez had to wait until October 25 to make his debut in a 3-1 defeat to Real Madrid as he served a four-month suspension for biting Italian defender Giorgio Chielini at the World Cup. Despite a controversy plagued three years in England, the 27-year-old earned his dream move to Barca after a stunning 31-goal season dragged Liverpool to the verge of their first Premier League title in 24 years and saw him crowned Premier League Player of the Year. Suarez admitted to his debut at the Santiago Bernabeu being a ""bittersweet"" experience as Barca suffered their first league defeat of the season to Madrid despite Suarez setting up Neymar for an early opener. Worse was to come as Enrique's men then suffered a shock 1-0 defeat to Celta Vigo on Suarez's home debut a week later. However, his fortunes in a Barca shirt began to turn with an inspired display as a second-half substitute against Almeria with two assists as the visitors came from a goal down to win 2-1. And he made it four assists in as many games with a lovely run and cross from Ivan Rakitic's goal in the 5-1 thrashing of Sevilla on Saturday. Despite being unable to find the net for Barca until his strike on Tuesday, Suarez had still been on fine scoring form for Uruguay in recent friendlies with three goals in two games against Oman and Costa Rica."
1421,24/11/2014,02:30,More Messi history up for grabs as Barca visit APOEL,"Fresh from becoming the all-time leading goalscorer in La Liga, Lionel Messi will have his sights on more history as he looks to repeat that feat in the Champions League when Barcelona visit APOEL Nicosia on Tuesday.","Messi's double in the Catalans' 2-0 win at Ajax three weeks ago took him level with Real Madrid legend Raul's record tally of 71 goals in the competition and ensured Barca's progress to the last 16 for an 11th consecutive season. However, Luis Enrique's men still need at least a point in Cyprus to ensure they can win Group F with victory over Paris Saint-Germain at home in their final group match early next month. Messi's latest record feat overshadowed arguably Barca's best performance of the season so far in crushing Europa League holders Sevilla 5-1 at the weekend, with the Argentine scoring his 27th hat-trick for the club along with goals from Neymar and Ivan Rakitic. Luis Suarez's attempts to break his Barcelona duck were frustrated once more but Enrique has no concerns over the Urguayan's ability to find the back of the net as he again proved his worth with a fourth assist in as many games. ""It will come. To have a goalscorer of that quality and generosity is marvellous,"" said Enrique. ""They are all playing for each other. No one doubts that Suarez will score many goals for Barcelona."" Rakitic also hailed the importance of such a resounding win after a difficult couple of weeks which saw Barca lose to Real Madrid and Celta Vigo in consecutive games before struggling to overcome Almeria 2-1 ahead of the international break. ""It was important to play well and recover good feelings, but above all to regain the confidence of the fans."" The Croatian is likely to team up with Xavi Hernandez in midfield as Andres Iniesta has been left out of the 22-man squad that will travel to Nicosia on Monday, despite nearing a return to action after a month out. Thomas Vermaelen has also been left out due to the recurrence of a hamstring injury which has prevented him from making his Barca debut since a summer move from Arsenal. Three narrow defeats from four matches mean APOEL cannot repeat their remarkable run to the Champions League quarter-finals in the 2011/12 season, but they too still have the prospect of European football into the new year to fight for. Giorgos Donis's men trail Ajax by just a point and face the Dutch champions in two weeks time in Amsterdam in what is likely to be a decisive match to decide who claims third place and the consolation prize of dropping into the last 32 of the Europa League."
1422,22/11/2014,23:38,Messi 'never imagined' breaking La Liga goal record,Lionel Messi thanked teammates and coaches past and present after becoming the all-time leading goalscorer in La Liga with a hat-trick in Barca's 5-1 demolition of Sevilla on Saturday.,"The 27-year-old Argentine's opener brought him level with Telmo Zarra on 251 goals in just his 289th appearance in the Spanish top flight. Messi then went on to score his side's fourth and fifth goals to register his 27th Barcelona hat-trick and put him out in front as the leading marksmen in the history of Spanish football. ""When I scored this goal, I couldn't imagine I could break any record, let alone this one previously held by the great Telmo Zarra,"" he wrote on his official Facebook page alongside his first Barca goal against Albacete in May, 2005. ""I was only able to achieve this because of the support I have had from so many people during my time here and I would like to dedicate this achievement to you all. ""Thanks for always being with me. I would also like to dedicate this to the people who are no longer with us anymore. I will never forget you. Thank you everyone for standing with me."" Current Barcelona boss Luis Enrique has only had the pleasure of coaching the four-time World player of the Year for a matter of months, but believes he will be remembered as the best of all time. ""He is a unique and unrepeatable player,"" said Enrique, who hailed his side's display as one of the best in his short tenure. ""I can't compare him to any other player I have seen before and I have seen plenty. ""I have known for a long time that I haven't seen a player like him and now I have the pleasure to see him train everyday."" Enrique also batted away suggestions that Messi's future may lie away from the Camp Nou after comments he made in the past week. Messi refused to rule out a move before the end of his career, despite signing a new four-year deal with the Catalan giants in May. ""Football is full of unexpected twists and turns,"" Messi told Argentinean newspaper Ole. ""It is true that I said I would like to stay there forever, but sometimes not everything turns out the way you want,"" he added. However, Enrique's immediate focus is on moulding his star front three of Messi, Neymar and Luis Suarez to pose a significant title challenge to the in-form Real Madrid. ""Leo knows he is very loved here,"" added Enrique. ""The present is with the best player of all time with us. We continue working and trying to win titles at the end of the season."" Barca president Josep Maria Bartomeu also dismissed rumours over his prized asset's future, claiming it was an ongoing investigation for tax fraud that had unsettled the player rather than anything on the field. Messi and his father have been accused of not paying 4.16 million euros ($5.26 million, £3.26 million) in tax on earnings from the player's image rights from 2007-2009 through the creation of a web of shell companies in Belize and Uruguay. ""I think he will finish his career here. He has a contract with us and he is happy,"" said Bartomeu. ""He wants to continue, but there are non-sporting reasons that we don't like and we are going to defend him in every arena. ""He is a spectacular player. I don't have the superlatives left to describe the best player in the history of Barcelona and of world football. He has demonstrated it and he is still young. He still has many more years of scoring goals and we have many more years to enjoy having him."""
1423,22/11/2014,21:40,Lionel Messi breaks La Liga goalscoring record,Lionel Messi broke Telmo Zarra's 59-year-old record as the leading goalscorer in the history of La Liga with a stunning hat-trick against Sevilla on Saturday.,"The Argentine opened the scoring with a trademark free-kick to match Zarra's mark of 251 goals in his 289th La Liga appearance. He then slid in to convert Neymar's pass to set the new record mark for his side's fourth of the evening and rounded off a special night with a low left-footed effort to seal his hat-trick. Messi was thrown into the air by this teammates as they celebrated the record in front of over 78,000 fans at the Camp Nou. Legendary Basque striker Zarra scored his 251 goals for Athletic Bilbao during a 15-year career from 1940 to 1955."

Legendary Basque striker Zarra scored his 251 goals for Athletic Bilbao during a 15-year career from 1940 to 1955. Messi's strike ended an uncharacteristically long three-game goal drought in league action as Barca slipped to defeats against Real Madrid and Celta Vigo and had to come from behind to beat Almeria 2-1 before the recent international break. However, in between times, he had also equalled Real Madrid legend Raul's all-time record mark of 71 Champions League goals with a double against Ajax earlier this month. Barca boss Luis Enrique hailed the 27-year-old as ""the best player I have seen in my life"" after he hit that landmark in Amsterdam. Messi recently celebrated the 10th anniversary of his debut with the Catalan giants, a period which has seen him win 21 trophies and crowned World Player of the Year four times. However, he cast some doubt on his future with the club this week when he refused to rule out a move away from the Catalan capital before the end of his career. ""Football is full of unexpected twists and turns,"" he told Argentinean newspaper Ole. ""It is true that I said I would like to stay there forever, but sometimes not everything turns out the way you want."" Messi's Real Madrid rival Cristiano Ronaldo, who is just one shy of he and Raul in Champions League goals, lies ninth on the all-time La Liga list with two goals in Real's 4-0 win over Eibar on Saturday took him to 197 goals in just 177 games."
1425,22/11/2014,13:07,Barcelona rest Mascherano for Sevilla clash,Barcelona on Saturday rested Argentine midfielder Javier Mascherano for their league clash with Sevilla but were boosted by the return of defender Jeremy Mathieu.,"Mascherano has become a key player for coach Luis Enrique. But with the Spanish side second in the table two points behind Real Madrid, he was left out as Barcelona have four more tough La Liga games and two key Champions League clashes before the end of the year. Mathieu, a surprise signing before the season started, returns to the squad after three weeks out with a calf injury. The 31-year-old French international was given the all-clear to play on Friday. Brazilian midfielder Rafinha is also fit again for the match against fifth placed Sevilla which starts at 1900 GMT."
1426,08/11/2014,22:15,Bale on target in Real win,Gareth Bale scored on his return to the Real Madrid starting line-up for the first time in a month as the European champions beat Rayo Vallecano 5-1 on Saturday.,"Barcelona remain just two points behind the league leaders thanks to two assists from Luis Suarez as they came from behind to snap a two-game losing streak in La Liga with a 2-1 win at Almeria. Bale took just nine minutes to make his mark as he slid in to turn home Toni Kroos's low cross before Sergio Ramos's fortunate looping effort doubled Madrid's lead. An awful attempted backpass from James Rodriguez gave Rayo hope just before half-time as Alberto Bueno reduced the arrears, but Kroos restored the hosts' two-goal advantage with his first goal for the club. Karim Benzema added a dubious fourth despite being clearly in an offside position before Cristiano Ronaldo registered his 23rd goal of the season thanks to some generous goalkeeping from Cristian Alvarez. A pelvic muscle injury had kept Bale on the sidelines for five games prior to his return as a second-half substitute against Liverpool in midweek, and there were positive signs for Welsh boss Chris Coleman as he looked back to his best ahead of his country's crucial Euro 2016 qualifiers against Belgium and Israel. Bale was on hand to prod home the opener from close range after a neat one-two between Kroos and Ronaldo as Madrid started brightly. Ronaldo then uncharacteristically blazed over from inside the area and Alvarez did well to turn a curling effort from Rodriguez wide. However, from the resulting corner Ramos made it 2-0 when the ball fortunately ricocheted off his thigh into the top corner. Rayo were gifted a reward for their neat possession football two minutes before the break, though, as Rodriguez passed the ball straight to Leo Baptistao and the on-loan Atletico Madrid striker squared for Bueno to slot into an empty net. Baptistao thought he had brought Rayo level 10 minutes into the second period, but the goal was ruled out for a marginal offside call and within seconds Madrid had put the game to bed. Ronaldo cut the ball back for Kroos 25 yards from goal and the German World Cup winner bent home his first goal for the club with a low precise finish. Four minutes later it was 4-1 as Benzema turned home Ronaldo's miscued shot and this time the goal did stand despite the Frenchman being clearly in an offside position. Bale was denied a sensational second of the night when Alvarez turned his thunderous volley onto the bar, but the 'keeper undid his good work when he allowed Ronaldo's weak effort through his body to round off a 13th consecutive victory in all competitions for Madrid. Earlier, Barca were bailed out by a superb second-half performance by Suarez after he and Neymar had been left on the bench by boss Luis Enrique as he made five changes from the side that defeated Ajax 2-0 in midweek. Yet, despite his team's reaction after the break, Enrique was less than impressed by their display. ""The second-half was better for the ambition and attitude shown by the players rather than for good football,"" he said. ""To have a good season, though, you have to win even when you don't play well in games like today."" The visitors were caught out eight minutes before half-time as Lionel Messi lost possession deep inside the Almeria half and with one pass Barca were undone as Fernando Soriano released Thievy Bifouma and he raced past Marc Bartra before calmly slotting past Bravo. Enrique had seen enough in the first 45 minutes and swiftly introduced Suarez and Neymar for Munir El Haddadi and Pedro Rodriguez at the break. It took 15 minutes for the substitutes to make an impact as Suarez acrobatically volleyed against the bar at the back post from a corner. Suarez was the creator when Barca did eventually level as he turned his marker just inside the area and squared for Neymar to turn the ball home via a deflection off Ximo Navarro 18 minutes from time. The Uruguayan was inches away from his first Barca goal moments later as he spun and sent a low shot just beyond Martinez's far post. Suarez then teed up Messi to sent another looping header off the crossbar as the pressure from the Catalans continued. And they found the winner eight minutes from the end when after another burst from Suarez down the right he picked out the late arriving Alba from left-back to bundle home his first goal of the season."

1428,07/11/2014,02:17,"Messi targets more history, Suarez a first goal",Lionel Messi continues his quest to become the all-time leading goalscorer in La Liga just days after equalling a similar feat in the Champions League when Barcelona visit Almeria on Saturday.,"Messi drew level with Real Madrid legend Raul on 71 Champions League goals with a brace as Barca bounced back from two consecutive defeats to beat Ajax 2-0 in midweek and progress to the last 16. The Argentine is just one goal short of the 251 goals Telmo Zarra scored for Athletic Bilbao between 1940 and 1955, but has been kept scoreless in his last La Liga outings as Barca slipped to defeat against Real Madrid and Celta Vigo. That downturn in form has coincided with Luis Suarez's introduction to the side after serving his four-month ban for biting at the World Cup. The Uruguayan has yet to find the net in his three appearances for the Catalans and endured a frustrating night on his return to old club Ajax as he squandered his best chance to break his duck by firing straight at Jasper Cillessen with only the Dutch international 'keeper to beat. However, Barca boss Luis Enrique played down the importance of Suarez's slow start and is confident his star front three of Messi, Suarez and Neymar will click in the coming weeks. ""Messi is the best player I have seen in my life,"" said Enrique. ""In attack we have distinct possibilities. We know that Neymar and Luis can play in different positions and that their responsibilities change when we have the ball and when we don't. ""I like to have those variations. We have players of a very high level."" At the back Enrique will still be without the injured Jeremy Mathieu, so Gerard Pique may be recalled after missing out in the last two games. League leaders Real Madrid are also in action on Saturday as they look to extend their 12-game winning streak against Rayo Vallecano at the Santiago Bernabeu. Madrid eased past an under-strength Liverpool on Tuesday thanks to Karim Benzema's winner to secure their passage into the last 16. And the in-form Frenchman, who has 10 goals in 16 appearances this season, believes he is enjoying his best run of form since joining the European champions five years ago. ""I always hear that a footballer enters his prime when he reaches 26. I hope that is the case for me,"" he told Madrid sports daily AS. ""We are in great form and enjoying playing together. I would underline the unity that exists in this group. We play together with the same attitude. ""We know that any player that comes on from the bench can make the difference, can swing the match our way, and that is what counts."" Madrid boss Carlo Ancelotti confirmed in midweek he would recall Gareth Bale to his starting line-up after the Welshman looked lively in his 30-minute cameo appearance from the bench against Liverpool following a five-game absence due to a pelvic muscle injury. Isco is the player most likely to make way for Bale with James Rodriguez switching to the left side of midfield. Champions Atletico Madrid will be hoping to remain just a point adrift of Real when they travel to face managerless Real Sociedad on Sunday. Former Manchester United boss David Moyes and Alejandro Sabella, who led Argentina to the World Cup final in July, are among the candidates to replace Jagoba Arrasate. But president Jokin Aperribay confirmed coaches Asier Santana and Imanol Alguaci will temporarily take charge for the visit of Diego Simeone's men. Second-placed Valencia can heap more misery on Athletic Bilbao after they were mathematically eliminated from the Champions League with defeat to Porto in midweek when they meet at the Mestalla. Meanwhile, Sevilla will be looking to bounce back from their defeat to Athletic last time out and remain in the title hunt as they entertain lowly Levante at the Sanchez Pizjuan.

1429,05/11/2014,22:53,Messi equals Raul's record mark,Lionel Messi became the joint top goalscorer in Champions League history with both goals in Barcelona's 2-0 win at Ajax which also secured their place in the last 16 on Wednesday.,"Messi moved level with Real Madrid legend Raul on 71 goals in the competition as he headed home the opener nine minutes before half-time before prodding in from Pedro Rodriguez's cross 15 minutes from time to make the game safe just moments after the hosts had been reduced to 10 men. <a href=""/alltime_goalgetter/champions-league/tore/1/"">&gt;&gt; Champions League topscorers</a> However, it was another frustrating evening for Luis Suarez on his return to the side where he made his name in Europe as he passed up a huge chance to score his first Barca goal early in the second-half. Barcelona still trail Paris Saint-Germain by a point at the top of Group F after the French champions also sealed their place in the knockout phase with a 1-0 win at home to APOEL Nicosia. Messi took advantage of a rare off night in front of goal by Cristiano Ronaldo against Liverpool on Tuesday to leapfrog the Portuguese, who now lies one behind the Argentine on 70 Champions League goals. However, Barca had it far from all their own way in the Dutch capital as after Neymar had an early goal rightly ruled out for the visitors, it was Ajax who enjoyed the better of the opening 45 minutes. Lucas Andersen fired just wide from the edge of the area before Marc-Andre ter Stegen made a fine low save to deny Davy Klaassen rounding of a sumptuous move with a volleyed finish. It took Barca over half an hour to wake from their slumber, but their star-studded front three began to create problems when Suarez's driven effort was deflected behind for a corner. Messi then teed up Jordi Alba with a lovely through ball, but Ajax 'keeper Jasper Cillessen scurried from his line to block the Spanish international full-back's effort. The opening goal arrived nine minutes before half-time and was harsh on Cillessen who originally made a great save high to his right to keep out a Messi free-kick. However, Barca kept the ball alive and from Marc Bartra's cross Messi somehow outjumped his marker to nod the ball home despite Ricardo van Rhijn's desperate attempts to clear off the line. Barca had more control of the game after the break and should have wrapped up the three points when Messi released Suarez clean through on goal, but Cillessen stood up to block his unconvincing finish and Messi's curled the rebound into the side-netting. Luis Enrique's men were given a scare 23 minutes from time when substitute Arkadiusz Milik's header came back off the post. But any hopes of a revival from the hosts disappeared when central defender Joel Veltman received a second yellow card for chopping down Messi. Just four minutes later the four-time World Player of the Year made the game safe as he exchanged passes with Pedro before sliding in to register his 11th goal of the season. And Messi will be eyeing another significant record in a matter of days as he continues his quest to become the all-time top scorer in La Liga when Barca travel to Almeria on Saturday."

FC Tokyo, currently seventh in the 18-team J-League first division, have yet to make an official offer for 34-year-old Xavi, with a team official telling the daily that no formal decision has been made. The newspaper said money remained a huge question, with deep-pocketed European and Middle Eastern clubs also reportedly interested in Xavi, who last month broke the record for the most appearances in the Champions League. Xavi has already been linked with possible moves to the Premier League and the Bundesliga. There have reportedly been offers from Qatar as well as Manchester City, believed to be in connection to its US franchise New York City FC. The rumour mill began swirling when Xavi hinted earlier this year he might leave Barcelona, where a glittering career has included three Champions League titles. He has spent much of this season at Barca playing a bit-part role under new boss Luis Enrique. Although it struggles to retain its home-grown stars, who head to Europe at the first opportunity, the J-League has form in attracting big-name foreign players in the twilight of their careers. It currently features Uruguay striker Diego Forlan, the most valuable player in the 2010 World Cup in South Africa. Others have included legends such as Zico and Dunga of Brazil, Gary Lineker of England and Sweden's Fredrik Ljungberg."

Barca's star-studded front three of Suarez, Neymar and Lionel Messi were denied by a fine goalkeeping display from Sergio Alvarez and the woodwork four times as Celta Vigo recorded their first away win at Barcelona since 1941 on Saturday, just a week after Barca were beaten for the first time in the league this season at Real Madrid. ""The match against Ajax is the most important at the moment,"" said Suarez, who played the full 90 minutes against Celta for the first time since his four-month ban for biting at the World Cup. ""It is clear that it is a club that gave me everything. ""I learned a lot and I will always be thankful for that. To return and play in the Champions League with Barcelona will be great."" A win for Barca at the Amsterdam Arena allied to victory for Paris Saint-Germain at home to APOEL Nicosia will see both the top seeds in Group F into the last 16 with two games to spare. However, Luis Enrique's men will not be taking Ajax lightly having suffered their first defeat of last season in the Dutch capital 2-1 despite playing against 10 men for the majority of the second-half. ""They started very strongly and over ran us in the early part of the game,"" midfielder Sergio Busquets said on Monday. ""When they went down to 10 men and we scored it changed. We hope that doesn't happen again."" Busquets has been one of a number of Barca players below par in the last two games, but he refuted suggestions he was still feeling the after effects of a hip injury picked up towards the end of last season and accepted the scrutiny that will come their way after back-to-back defeats. ""It is normal that there is a debate and everything is looked at with a magnifying glass. If you lose you have to improve because you are not doing everything well, but we always analyse ourselves, as much when we win as when we lose. ""We need to keep working and improving, we can't do anything else."" Ajax need to win to retain any realistic hope of reaching the last 16 and midfielder Lasse Schone believes lightning can strike twice for Frank de Boer's men. ""Everyone then had written us off last year, but we won,"" Schone, who scored twice in Saturday's 4-0 win over FC Dordrecht, told the club's website. ""The more people say we can't do it the better.

Luis Enrique's star-studded frontline of Suarez, Neymar and Lionel Messi were left frustrated as the hosts struck the woodwork four times and were denied by Celta 'keeper Sergio Alvarez numerous times as Joaquin Larrivey's second-half strike sealed the Galicians first away victory over Barca since 1941. ""The other day against Real Madrid to return to playing was a bittersweet feeling, it was great to be back but we didn't get the result,"" Suarez told Barca TV. ""To make my debut in the Camp Nou in a competitive game was nice but the result is negative again. ""We created a lot of chances, but we didn't have luck on our side. They defended well and their goalkeeper was great. ""Football can be unjust at times, the opponent creates one chance in the whole game and scores and that hurts."" On top of his 70-minute run out at the Bernabeu, Suarez had also played 45 minutes in the Catalan Super Cup against Espanyol in midweek to gain match fitness. And he insisted he felt no ill effects from having completed the 90 minutes in a competitive game for the first time in four months following his ban for biting Italian defender Giorgio Chiellini at the World Cup. ""I felt much better today than the other days. You always have to be 100 percent ready to compete. In the Bernabeu I felt good in the first moments of the game, but in the second I felt a bit tired after not playing for so long. ""The 45 minutes against Espanyol helped to gain rhythm and today having played the whole game I feel much better."" Barca's first chance to bounce back from a disappointing week comes at a ground Suarez knows well as Enrique's men travel to face his old club Ajax in Amsterdam on Wednesday. ""The match against Ajax is the most important at the moment,"" added Suarez, who scored 111 goals during a four-year spell with the Dutch champions. ""It is clear that it is a club that gave me everything. I learned a lot and I will always be thankful for that. To return and play in the Champions League with Barcelona will be great."" Enrique also lamented his side's lack of efficiency in front of goal and is braced for the criticism that will come the way of him and his players in the coming days. ""We had 19 shots and hit the woodwork four times. There were errors, but the attitude the team showed will reinforce us going forward. ""We deserved to win, but this sport rewards effectiveness and that is what we weren't.

It took the Uruguayan just three minutes to make an impact as he set up Neymar for the opening goal. But after Cristiano Ronaldo had levelled from the penalty spot 10 minutes before the break, Barca were blown away in the second-half by goals from Pepe and Karim Benzema. ""Obviously what everyone wants on a debut is a victory, even more so in a game of this magnitude. I think that we did everything we could to get a good result, but it wasn't to be,"" added Suarez. ""We need to forget this game and think about our next opponents. ""After they equalised to make it 1-1 we controlled the game, we had chances to score and it's always difficult if you don't take your chances. In the second-half they surprised us with their speed on the counter and killed the game. ""We have to move on and think about our next opponent, we are still a point ahead of Real Madrid."" Barca boss Luis Enrique claimed he had no regrets about throwing Suarez back into the thick of the action. ""I don't regret it at all,"" said Enrique. ""He did more than I expected. He played more and with rhythm. We brought him off because it is very difficult to play the 90 minutes after such a long time."" However, Enrique admitted Madrid had been deserving winners on the day. ""We started well, but as soon as we scored they started to create chances. ""There was a period where we could have made it 2-0, but in the second-half they punished us at the key moments and deserved to win the game."" Barca's only two defeats this season have come in their two real tests away at Madrid and Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions League. And Enrique recognised they needed to cut out the sloppy errors that had cost them against top opposition. ""This shows clearly that there are opponents just as good if not better than us, as was the case today. We need to rectify that because the errors allowed them to win clearly."" A ninth consecutive victory in all competitions for Madrid moves them back to within a point of Barcelona at the top of the. Real boss Carlo Ancelotti lauded his side's calm reaction to falling behind so early on. ""We didn't lose our head after losing the early goal,"" said the Italian. ""I liked many things about the team, above all the high tempo we played with. The team recovered well with just two days rest after Wednesday and played very well."" Defender Sergio Ramos, meanwhile, was more effusive in his praise of just Real's second home league win over Barca in seven seasons. ""The team was incredible in all aspects and positions, despite the goal we conceded,"" said the Spanish international. ""We were very clear in our ideas, and we dominated not only in possession but on the counter-attack. It was a complete performance."""
1436,25/10/2014,17:13,Barcelona's Luis Suarez starts in El Clasico,Barcelona's record signing Luis Suarez makes his debut against Real Madrid on Saturday after being named in the starting line-up for the biggest game in club football.,Suarez -- who is making his return to competitive football after serving a four month ban for biting Italian defender Giorgio Chiellini -- is part of an all-star South American front three for the La Liga leaders also including Lionel Messi and Neymar.
1437,25/10/2014,03:00,Suarez's moment finally arrives in El Clasico,"Four months after disgracing himself in front of the world by biting an opponent for the third time, Barcelona's record signing Luis Suarez will be back on the pitch and hoping to put his career back on track.","Suarez will finally make his competitive debut after sealing a £75 million ($127 million, 95 million euros) move from Liverpool in the biggest game in club football as the La Liga leaders travel to face Real Madrid at the Santiago Bernabeu (1600GMT kick-off). The Uruguayan admitted to breaking down in tears in relief when he heard Barca weren't pulling the plug on his dream move days after he sunk his teeth into the shoulder of Italian defender Giorgio Chiellini. Now the Catalans will be hoping that months of pent-up frustration at being sidelined will be unleashed against their eternal rivals by a man who has scored in each of his league debuts with Ajax and Liverpool. ""He will have some minutes for sure,"" said Barca boss Luis Enrique on Friday. ""How many I cannot say, that is the million dollar question. It is an important occasion for him to be able to join in with the group."" Suarez's feisty temperament will come under scrutiny in the cauldron of the Bernabeu with his latest lengthy ban just one of four in his career, three of which have been for biting. He was also charged with racially abusing Manchester United defender Patrice Evra during his time with Liverpool. ""I think all the bad things I have been through are in the past,"" Suarez told The Guardian. ""I believe I am on the right path now, dealing with the people who can help me, the right kind of people."" However, on the field it is Madrid who have the most to lose from the 229th meeting between the two sides. Not only could they suffer the embarrassment of seeing Lionel Messi score the one goal he needs to become the joint top goalscorer in the history of La Liga alongside Telmo Zarra on 251. But more importantly a fifth defeat in seven league games at the Bernabeu against Barcelona would see them trail the leaders by seven points. Early season defeats to Real Sociedad and Atletico Madrid are the root of that deficit, but Carlo Ancelotti's men have since strung together eight consecutive wins in all competitions and the Italian believes they are ready for the ultimate test of that improvement. ""We understood well and criticised ourselves in what we did wrong against Sociedad and Atletico. With hard work we have found the balance and the team is working together,"" he said. ""Now we have a test against a very competitive team."" A game littered with star names will unfortunately be missing the match winner the last time the two sides met as Gareth Bale misses out with a muscle injury. His place is expected to go to Isco with Madrid starting with the 4-4-2 formation that worked so well in their 3-0 win against Liverpool at Anfield in midweek. And there is some good new for Los Blancos on the injury front as Sergio Ramos looks to have recovered from a calf strain in time to take his place in defence."
1438,24/10/2014,18:05,Suarez sought help to end biting impulse,Barcelona striker Luis Suarez has admitted he has sought help to end his habit of biting opponents ahead of making his debut for the Catalans against Real Madrid on Saturday.,"The most expensive player in Barca's history is finally free to play for his new club at the Bernabeu after serving a four-month ban for biting Italian defender Giorgio Chiellini at the World Cup in June. ""I think all the bad things I have been through are in the past,"" Suarez told The Guardian. ""I believe I am on the right path now, dealing with the people who can help me, the right kind of people."" Suarez's questionable temperament is likely to be tested by the red-hot atmosphere at the Bernabeu. As well as his latest bite on Chiellini, the 27-year-old received lengthy suspensions for biting Chelsea defender Branislav Ivanovic last year and Otman Bakkal of PSV Eindhoven whilst playing for Ajax. ""Everyone has different ways of defending themselves. In my case, the pressure and tension came out in that way ""There are other players who react by breaking someone's leg, or smashing someone's nose across their face. What happened with Chiellini is seen as worse. I understand why biting is seen so badly."" However, Suarez remains bitter about the other major controversy of his time in England when he was banned for eight matches after being found guilty of racially abusing Patrice Evra during a match between Liverpool and Manchester United in 2011. ""I know I was wrong with the biting and the diving but I was accused of racism without any proof,"" said the 27-year-old. ""There were lots of cameras, but no evidence. It hurts me the most that it was my word against theirs."" Suarez addressed Evra as ""negro"", a world commonly used in his homeland when speaking to black people. ""Every culture has its way of expressing itself, and that's a word people in Uruguay use all the time, whether somebody is black or not black. ""It gets used a lot without those connotations, and that's why it is completely different to how it is expressed in England, no?"""
1439,24/10/2014,14:57,"Suarez will make Clasico debut, Enrique confirms",Barcelona boss Luis Enrique has confirmed that Luis Suarez will make his long-awaited debut for the club in Saturday's first El Clasico of the season away to Real Madrid.,"Suarez has been restricted to friendly matches since sealing a £75 million ($127 million, 95 million euros) move from Liverpool after receiving a four-month ban for biting Italian defender Giorgio Chiellini at the World Cup. ""He will have some minutes for sure,"" Enrique told a press conference on Thursday. ""How many I cannot say, that is the million dollar question. It is an important occasion for him to be able to join in with the group."" And Enrique insisted that he wasn't concerned that the Uruguayan's questionable temperament could be tested by the pressure of making his bow in the biggest game in world football. ""Clasicos have to be heated, enjoyable and the best show possible for the fans, but staying within the sporting parameters."" Whilst Suarez's availability adds to Barca's attacking arsenal alongside Lionel Messi and Neymar, Real Madrid will be without one of their key men in Gareth Bale due to injury. However, Enrique echoed the words of his Madrid counterpart Carlo Ancelotti in saying the Welshman's absence wouldn't affect his side's preparation for the game. ""Independent of who is in Ancelotti's starting line-up, we will maintain our philosophy. It is obvious that both sides will continue to play in their own different ways."" Other than the debate over whether Suarez will start or make his debut as a substitute, the only other doubt in the Barca team surrounds midfielder Sergio Busquets. The Spanish international missed Barca's 3-1 win over Ajax in midweek due to a hip injury, but Enrique is confident he will be fit to take his place in the side at the Bernabeu. ""Busquets is fine, he has trained with the rest of the group and in principle can play without any problems."""
1440,24/10/2014,13:31,"Suarez move great for La Liga, says Ancelotti","Real Madrid boss Carlo Ancelotti believes Luis Suarez's move to Barcelona for a club record fee is a boost for La Liga, despite the damage he could cause to Real's title hopes.","Suarez looks set to make his debut for the Catalans in Saturday's first El Clasico of the season at the Santiago Bernabeu having completed a four-month ban for biting Italian defender Giorgio Chiellini at the World Cup. However, Ancelotti insisted he would be making no special plans for the Uruguayan as his presence would not change how his side approached the game. ""I am not here to judge Luis Suarez. He has scored a lot of goals, but it doesn't change our tactics,"" said the Italian. ""I think for football it is good news that Suarez can play in this league. I don't know if he will play (tomorrow) because it is not my business. ""It is not my problem. Naturally I have a lot of respect for Suarez's quality, but if Suarez plays or not doesn't change their idea of how to play the game and doesn't change ours either."" While Barca will be gaining another world class talent in attack to link up with Lionel Messi and Neymar, Real will be without one of their star trio up front as Gareth Bale misses the game through injury. ""He suffered an injury a week ago and won't be available for tomorrow,"" added Ancelotti. ""He needs one week to rest and then he will start to train. He is one of the most important players in our squad, last year he was fantastic. It wasn't easy for him at the start but now he feels good, he knows the league and I think he will do better than last season."" Bale's absence wasn't missed as the European champions swept aside Liverpool 3-0 at Anfield on Wednesday thanks to goals from Cristiano Ronaldo and Karim Beznema. Ancelotti recognised that facing the unbeaten La Liga leaders will be a much more serious test of his side's progress in the last couple of months after a disappointing start to the season. And he believes the arrival of coach Luis Enrique along with a first trophy-less season in six years last year has sparked a reaction from Barcelona. ""All games against Barcelona are very difficult. The two teams are in great form, but I always have confidence, above all for what we did last Wednesday. ""I see Barcelona as a more motivated team because a new coach has come and new players. They didn't win titles last year so they are more motivated. ""I think they are playing more direct in attack and are very solid in defence."" One positive piece of injury news for Madrid is the return of Sergio Ramos. The Spanish international has missed the last four games for club and country due to a calf injury, but is expected to partner Pepe in central defence on Saturday. ""Pepe is OK, like Ramos,"" said Ancelotti. ""He has trained well and totally recovered. I think they are going to play."""
1441,24/10/2014,02:17,Five classic El Clasico clashes,Real Madrid meet Barcelona for the 229th time on Saturday in one of the most anticipated El Clasicos in recent times as Luis Suarez prepares to make his Barca debut.,"Here, AFP Sports looks at five famous matches from the historic rivalry between Spain's two biggest clubs: Real Madrid 5 Barcelona 0 (La Liga, January 7, 1995) Just a year after guiding Barca to a 5-0 win over Real, Danish midfielder Michael Laudrup sealed his controversial switch to Los Blancos by sealing revenge for his new side by the same scoreline thanks to an Ivan Zamorano hat-trick and further goals from future Barca favourite Luis Enrique and Jose Emilio Amavisca. Barcelona 3 Real Madrid 3 (La Liga, March 10, 2007) Lionel Messi announced his arrival on the Clasico stage by scoring a hat-trick as 10-man Barca came from behind three times to snatch a dramatic draw. The Argentine's brilliance couldn't spark a revival in the title race, however, as Madrid went onto win the league, finishing 18 points ahead of third-placed Barca. Real Madrid 2 Barcelona 6 (La Liga, May 2, 2009) Pep Guardiola's first game in charge of Barcelona at the Bernabeu was also billed as a title decider as Madrid came into the game just four points behind Barca's eventual treble winners and on a run of 17 wins and a draw in 18 league games. They even scored first through Gonzalo Higuain, but Barca responded emphatically as goals from Catalan born centre-backs Carles Puyol and Gerard Pique added to doubles from Thierry Henry and Messi. Barcelona 5 Real Madrid 0 (La Liga, November 29, 2010) Barca's best performance of the Guardiola era destroyed Jose Mourinho's Madrid to move top of the table and they never ceded that advantage on their way to a third consecutive title. Messi was once again the driving force, although he didn't get on the scoresheet, as he provided two glorious assists for David Villa after Xavi and Pedro Rodriguez had put Barca in control before Jeffran Suarez rounded off a famous night for the Blaugrana. Real Madrid 3 Barcelona 4 (La Liga, March 23, 2014) Billed as a potentially decisive match in the Liga title race, the game swung back and forth as Andres Iniesta gave Barca an early lead before a Karim Benzema double put Real in front. Messi brought Barca level before half-time only for Madrid to retake the lead through Cristiano Ronaldo's penalty. However, Messi was to have the final say as he completed a hat-trick with two more penalties to become the top goalscorer in the history of the fixture. Defeat for Real was gratefully received across the Spanish capital as Atletico Madrid moved to the top of the table on the same day and held off Barca on the final day of the season to break the big two's 10-year domination of La Liga."
1442,24/10/2014,02:16,Mathieu aims to win over Barcelona faithful,Giant defender Jeremy Mathieu emerged from the football shadows four months ago to get a star billing in the heart of the Barcelona defence but it has been a battle since to win over some of the faithful at the Spanish giants.,"Mathieu, who will be 31 on Wednesday, was not a regular in the French national side, and had played only a handful of Champions League games for his Valencia club. The 1.90 metre (six feet three inch) Mathieu could never have imagined he would be given the task of containing the likes of Cristiano Ronaldo, Karim Benzema and James Rodriguez in Saturday's Clasico at Real Madrid. Mathieu told AFP it was a moment of ""joy"" and ""pride"" when he learned of his 20 million euro ($25 million) move to Barcelona in July. A rejuvenated Barcelona are now top of La Liga but Mathieu acknowledged that he has battled to convince some supporters. ""When I arrived, some people criticised my age and the price paid by Barcelona a lot. But it was not my decision. I am trying to prove my worth on the pitch. It is happening little by little, I am winning my place, changing people's opinions,"" he said. The player who made his name at the unglamorous French clubs of Sochaux and Toulouse admitted it was a shock when he got the call to the Camp Nou stadium. ""At my age I could only say yes. In my head I was resigned to staying at Valencia. At my age you don't expect Barcelona to come calling,"" he said. ""But if Barcelona come looking for you it is because you have the level."" Mathieu said it was Barcelona coach Luis Enrique who had wanted him to sign and told him ""not to worry."" Now he is in a team three points clear at the top of La Liga and heading comfortably towards the Champions League knockout stages. Enrique has demanded and got more from Barcelona's stars and with Luis Suarez about to start for the first time, there could be more to come. Mathieu said there could be ""fireworks"" with Suarez, coming back from his World Cup biting ban. ""I think he can do big things. On the pitch, in training, it shows that he wants to do big things. He is hungry and he wants to get started with Barcelona. ""We don't know yet whether he will start the Clasico but (Lionel Messi, Suarez and Neymar) can hit a defence. We will see on the day, but there could be fireworks,"" Mathieu predicted. For Mathieu, the Clasico is a dream come true that could help establish his place in the French team for the European Championships in 2016. A defeat would be a blow to his burgeoning reputation. ""With all these stars, it just makes you dream,"" said the defender. ""It is a match you cannot lose because we have a lot of people behind us: a club, a whole city."" Mathieu's Barcelona exploits have brought him back into the French team after a year out of the squad. He now has four caps. ""At my age, this will be my last challenge in the French team,"" he said. ""I am going to do everything to be at the Euro and feel what it is like at a great competition."" Barcelona has changed his profile, but Mathieu insists his game is the same. ""People look at you more. That has certainly been in my favour. But I am the same player and I will not change on the pitch. It is the coach's choice but I am very happy being in this French side,"" said the player who has to win over two teams on Saturday."
1443,24/10/2014,02:15,Messi targets record as Suarez debuts in El Clasico,Luis Suarez is free to make his long-awaited debut for Barcelona when the La Liga leaders travel to face Real Madrid in the first El Clasico of the season on Saturday.,"Suarez has been restricted to a few friendly games for club and country since sealing a £75 million ($127 million, 95 million euros) move from Liverpool after receiving a four-month ban for biting Italian defender Giorgio Chiellini at the World Cup back in June. The Uruguayan's temperament will be tested by the red-hot atmosphere at the Santiago Bernabeu, but even on his debut Suarez could be overshadowed by teammate Lionel Messi. The four-time World Player of the Year is just one goal away from matching the 251 goals Telmo Zarra scored for Athletic Bilbao between 1940 to 1955 to become the all-time leading goalscorer in La Liga. And midfielder Andres Iniesta is hoping both will shine to continue Barca's fine recent record at the Bernabeu, where they have won four of the last six league meetings. ""I hope Messi scores two because it would be a great sign for us,"" said the Spanish international on Thursday. ""It is difficult to know what you will come up against because the details make the difference. It can swing to one side or the other in any moment, but we want to make the most of our strengths, be effective and try to play very well to win the game. It is never easy to win at the Bernabeu. ""Fortunately the time has come and the moment has arrived when Luis can play. He is very happy and it is important for the rest of the group too. We hope that he performs just as well as he has always done."" Madrid have a World Cup star of their own making his bow in the Clasico in Golden Boot winner James Rodriguez. ""It is going to be a hard game. I want to approach it calmly, responsibly and be really up for it to help the team get the victory,"" said the Colombian. More responsibility will be placed on Rodriguez's shoulders as Gareth Bale misses out through injury. However, the 23-year-old has begun to show signs of his form from Brazil in recent weeks, including a lovely assist for Cristiano Ronaldo's opening goal as Madrid sealed their eighth consecutive win in all competitions with a 3-0 win over Liverpool on Wednesday. ""I am in good form, as is the rest of the squad,"" he added. ""We have a strong group and mentally we are all united."" Defender Sergio Ramos is a doubt as he has missed the last four games for club and country with a calf strain, but did return to training alongside his teammates on Thursday. Barcelona's only injury doubt is Sergio Busquets. The Spanish international missed Tuesday's 3-1 win over Ajax due to a knock on his hip, but is expected to recover to take his place in the starting line-up. Elsewhere, Sevilla, Valencia and Atletico Madrid will be hoping to take advantage of the points dropped by one of or both Barca and Madrid. Valencia have the easiest task on paper and could hand a debut to Alvaro Negredo when they host struggling Elche at the Mestalla on Saturday Defeat for Barca at the Bernabeu would allow Sevilla to go joint top with victory at home to Villarreal on Sunday. Meanwhile, champions Atletico will be looking to round off a fine week after thrashing Malmo 5-0 in the Champions League when they travel across Madrid to take on Getafe. Fixtures (all times GMT)"
1444,23/10/2014,16:03,Scheduling hands Barca Clasico advantage - Ronaldo,World Player of the Year Cristiano Ronaldo has complained that the timing of the first El Clasico of the season on Saturday gives La Liga leaders Barcelona an unfair advantage.,"Ronaldo scored his 70th Champions League goal as Real Madrid beat Liverpool 3-0 away on Wednesday to all but seal their place in the last 16. However, Barca played at home and 24 hours earlier in dismissing Ajax 3-1, which Ronaldo believes will be beneficial to the Catalans. ""The best thing would be for the game to be on Sunday, but I don't want to use that as an excuse,"" the Portuguese captain told reporters. ""A footballer at the highest level knows that two days is not the same as three days, but it is not an excuse because we are going to play well and win."" The decision to play the game on a Saturday following a Champions League week is all the more baffling as both sides have a relatively quiet week following the clash at the Santiago Bernabeu. Barcelona don't play again until next weekend, whilst Real begin their defence of the Copa del Rey away to minnows UE Cornella on Wednesday. ""I don't understand because the fixtures are decided a long time in advance. I don't understand, with all respect the first games of the Cup are not as important as a Clasico. ""To play here at Anfield in a very difficult game and then play at six o'clock on Saturday it is very difficult. In my opinion the game ought to be on Sunday. ""There should be more attention to these small details. Twenty-four hours of a difference is a big difference, but, as I said before, I don't want to use it as an excuse because they team is playing well, is confident and we will do our best to win."""
1445,23/10/2014,02:30,Suarez prepares for Barca baptism of fire,"After 122 days Luis Suarez will be free to take part in a competitive match again and not just any game, but the biggest one in world football when Barcelona face Real Madrid at the Santiago Bernabeu on Saturday.","Much has changed since Suarez sunk his teeth into the shoulder of Italy's Giorgio Chiellini at the World Cup back in June. He was lambasted and ridiculed in equal measure by commentators the world over, handed a four-month ban from by FIFA as the bite was his third offence and changed clubs. Suarez admitted recently he feared his latest indiscretion would result in dream move from Liverpool to Barca falling through, but the Catalans instead invested their faith and £75 million ($127 million, 95 million euros) in the Uruguayan's undoubted ability. ""I was scared that they would call it off, as a repercussion of the incident. I was aware that could have happened,"" he said. ""By then the contact had begun with Barca and soon (his agent) Pere Guardiola would ring me and tell me it was done. ""I began to cry, for the situation I was going through and the faith Barca had shown in me. I felt really happy for the commitment the club were demonstrating in me."" The time for the repayment of that faith has now come. Suarez's 31 Premier League goals took Liverpool to the verge of a first title in 24 years last season and saw him crowned both the players' and writers' player of the year. Yet, he will have to get used to being a smaller fish in a bigger pond at Barca. Suarez joins an already star-studded and in-form forward line in four-time World Player of the Year Lionel Messi and Brazilian captain Neymar in a lineup beyond the budgets of even the majority of fantasy football managers. All three suffered their share of disappointment at the World Cup. Messi a beaten finalist with Argentina, Neymar having his dreams of victory on home soil cruelly torn away by broken vertebrae in his back. However, they have put that behind them quickly to start the season in stunning form. Messi has been back to his best with nine goals and 11 assists in 11 appearances, whilst Neymar has struck 10 times in as many games. ""We are desperately awaiting the return of Luis because he will give us a lot of strength as a team,"" Messi said after Barca's 3-1 win over Ajax on Tuesday. ""He is a great striker who will score a lot of goals. I am happy for him because he has spent a lot of time without playing."" What remains unclear is whether Suarez's debut will come as a starter or a substitute at the Bernabeu. ""He is very intense in the training sessions, he places a lot of importance in the day-to-day work and we hope that he will offer a lot,"" said Barca boss Luis Enrique in dismissing concerns over his fitness. ""From what I have seen of him in these weeks it is clear that he is getting close to his best."" His match sharpness and confidence was also boosted by scoring twice in friendlies for Uruguay against Saudi Arabia and Oman earlier this month. Now he must take Messi and Neymar's lead by putting his World Cup nightmare behind him to remind the world why is not just one of the most controversial, but best players on the planet."
1446,22/10/2014,02:05,Beating Madrid matters more than Liga record - Messi,Four-time World Player of the Year Lionel Messi has said victory in the season's first El Clasico against Real Madrid on Saturday is more important than the personal glory of becoming La Liga's all-time leading goalscorer.,"Messi is just one short of Telmo Zarra's 251-goal record which has stood since 1955 and could enter the record books once more on rival territory as Barca look to consolidate their four-point lead over Madrid at the Santiago Bernabeu. However, the Argentine joined coach Luis Enrique in playing down the importance of the match in the title race with just eight games of the season played. ""It is a Clasico and it is always nice to play in it, but it won't decide anything. ""There is still a long way to go, but we will play to win as always. ""The record is less important. The important thing is that we play well and win."" Messi was substituted along with Neymar and Andres Iniesta during the second-half of Barca's 3-1 win over Ajax on Tuesday as coach Luis Enrique looked ahead to his first visit to the Bernabeu as Barca boss. Controversy ensued when Messi appeared to dismiss Enrique's pleas to come off during Saturday's 3-0 win over Eibar, but Messi insisted it is always Enrique who has the final say on substitutions. ""I have heard what has been said, but he is the coach and he can take me off when he has to. There is no problem."" Messi and Neymar have now combined for 19 of their side's 28 goals this season and the Barca frontline will have even more star power at the Bernabeu as Luis Suarez is free to make his debut for the club having served his four-month ban for biting at the World Cup. ""We are desperately awaiting the return of Luis because he will give us a lot of strength as a team,"" added Messi. ""He is a great striker who will score a lot of goals. I am happy for him because he has spent a lot of time without playing."" After first-half goals from Neymar and Messi, Ajax briefly threatened a fightback when Anwar El Ghazi reduced the arrears two minutes from time after the South American duo and Iniesta had been withdrawn. Sandro Ramirez eased Barca nerves, though, when he fired home the hosts' third goal in stoppage time and Enrique defended his decision to replace his star men with over 20 minutes remaining. ""Football is a continuos risk and I didn't risk too much,"" said Enrique. ""I did it my way, as I believe I had to do it. Sometimes you win and sometimes not. I would do it again and I believe completely in the players that went on. ""It is the team on the pitch that has to find the solutions."""

Barca coach Luis Enrique then withdrew Neymar, Messi and Andres Iniesta in the second half to keep them fresh for the weekend. Ajax briefly threatened a comeback when Anwar El Ghazi halved the deficit two minutes from time, but Sandro drove home a third in stoppage time to secure a deserved victory for the Catalans. Edinson Cavani's late winner for Paris Saint-Germain away to APOEL Nicosia means Barca remain a point behind the French champions at the top of Group F, but extend their advantage over third-placed Ajax to four points. Messi and Neymar have now combined for 19 of their side's 28 goals this season and the lethal duo combined to open the scoring as Messi sucked in the Ajax defence before releasing Neymar to curl home his 10th goal in as many games. Moments later it was Messi who had a good chance to double the hosts' advantage, but he fired over from just inside the area. The Argentine did get on the scoresheet midway through the first half when he collected a lovely pass from Andres Iniesta and, despite Jasper Cillessen's best efforts, Messi's low shot trickled over the line. Messi was the provider once more as Barca came within inches of a third when Pedro Rodriguez smacked the post. And only a fine save from Cillessen prevented Iniesta from sealing a wonderful individual run with a goal six minutes before half-time after he ghosted past three Ajax defenders. Messi's goal had brought the four-time World Player of the Year level with Cristiano Ronaldo on 69 Champions League goals, two behind Raul's all-time record of 71. However, his attempts to inch closer to the record were frustrated after the break as he had a goal rightly ruled out for offside before firing into the side-netting from a narrow angle. Neymar, Messi and Iniesta were all then withdrawn with the upcoming trip to the Bernabeu in mind, and with the major threat to their goal removed, Ajax began to create chances of their own. Davy Klaassen blazed over when well-positioned inside the area 15 minutes from time, and Frank de Boer's men did ensure there were a nervy final few minutes for Barca when substitute El Ghazi bundled the ball home from close range two minutes from time. However, Sandro sealed the three points with a fine low finish into the far corner at the end of a flowing counter-attack in the fourth minute of stoppage time."

And only a fine save from Cillessen prevented Iniesta from sealing a wonderful individual run with a goal six minutes before half-time after he ghosted past three Ajax defenders. Messi's goal had brought the four-time World Player of the Year level with Cristiano Ronaldo on 69 Champions League goals, two behind Raul's all-time record of 71. However, his attempts to inch closer to the record were frustrated after the break as he had a goal rightly ruled out for offside before firing into the side-netting from a narrow angle. Neymar, Messi and Iniesta were all then withdrawn with the upcoming trip to the Bernabeu in mind, and with the major threat to their goal removed, Ajax began to create chances of their own. Davy Klaassen blazed over when well-positioned inside the area 15 minutes from time, and Frank de Boer's men did ensure there were a nervy final few minutes for Barca when substitute El Ghazi bundled the ball home from close range two minutes from time. However, Sandro sealed the three points with a fine low finish into the far corner at the end of a flowing counter-attack in the fourth minute of stoppage time."

His place is taken by 19-year-old Sergi Samper, who made his debut in Barca's 1-0 win over APOEL Nicosia to open their Champions League campaign last month. French international Jeremy Mathieu is also rested, but Ivan Rakitic returns after missing Saturday's 3-0 win against Eibar."
1450,20/10/2014,15:27,"Neymar relishing partnership with Messi, Suarez",Barcelona forward Neymar is looking forward to welcoming Luis Suarez into his and Lionel Messi's star-studded strike partnership when the Uruguayan returns from a four-month ban this weekend.,"Suarez looks set to make his debut for the Catalans on the biggest stage of all as Barca face Real Madrid for the first time this season at the Santiago Bernabeu on Saturday. Neymar and Messi have already combined for 17 goals in 10 games so far this season and the Brazilian is convinced last season's Premier League Player of the Year will only add to their firepower. ""For me Messi is the best player in the world and I am happy to be able to play alongside him,"" said the 22-year-old. ""But Luis Suarez is among the best too and I am sure he will bring many good things to our team."" Before concentrating on the Clasico, Barca welcome Ajax to the Camp Nou on Tuesday in a crucial Champions League clash following the Catalans defeat away to Paris Saint-Germain in their last European outing. ""It will be a very difficult and a very important match. We always play to win but I believe Ajax to be a great team both in defence and in attack. We will have to work hard to win,"" added Neymar. ""We need to think about doing everything possible to beat Ajax and afterwards we can begin to think about Madrid. Ajax are a great team and we are all concentrating on this game."" Barca boss Luis Enrique also stressed the importance of not looking ahead to the clash at the Bernabeu, but played down the idea that this could be a vital week in his side's season. ""We are used to playing every three or four days and the only important game and one in our minds right now is Ajax. The players are aware of how important this match is,"" he said. ""I don't have doubts about my team, nor about the game at the Bernabeu independent of the result against Ajax. ""The sensations at the moment are very good. We have only drawn one game in the league, only lost one in the Champions League, which we didn't deserve to lose. ""It is not a key week. The key weeks arrive in April and May. It is an interesting week rather than a key one."" Enrique is though expected to rotate his side for the visit of the Dutch champions, who have only taken two points from their opening two games in Group F. Sergio Busquets, Ivan Rakitic and Andres Iniesta are all expected to return after being rested in the 3-0 win over Eibar on Saturday. And Marc-Andre ter Stegen could also make his third appearance for the club should Enrique continue his policy of using the German in the Champions League despite Claudio Bravo's run of eight clean sheets in La Liga."
1451,20/10/2014,02:10,Barca target Ajax boost ahead of Clasico,Barcelona begin the biggest week of coach Luis Enrique's brief reign in charge when Dutch champions Ajax visit the Camp Nou on Tuesday.,"Enrique's men are in need of a win to get their Champions League campaign back on track after tasting defeat for the first time this season in their last European outing at Paris Saint-Germain. And the Barca boss will be hoping for a trouble free evening with the first El Clasico of the season away to Real Madrid to come on Saturday. ""What concerns me now is that they recover, rest and that they go into the game on Tuesday in the best condition possible,"" said Enrique after his side's 3-0 win over Eibar on Saturday. The former Barca captain is likely to rotate his side once more for the meeting against a former teammate in Frank de Boer's Ajax side. Sergio Busquets and Ivan Rakitic were rested against Eibar and are likely to return in midfield, but Xavi Hernandez could retain his place after impressing and scoring the opening goal against the Basques. Xavi broke compatriot Raul's record for the most appearances in Champions League history against PSG and has warned his teammates against looking ahead to the Bernabeu clash. ""We have Ajax first at home. After the slip up in Paris we need to get the three points, especially playing at home."" Enrique also has a decision to make in goal as Claudio Bravo has yet to concede in eight league games so far this season, while Marc-Andre ter Stegen was at fault for at least one goal in the defeat in Paris. However, Xavi believes Barca's stellar defensive record on the domestic front is thanks to a collective effort rather than brilliance from Bravo. ""It is not a coincidence,"" said the 34-year-old. ""We all track back, the boss has his specific instructions so that we all work well in our own zones. It is a collective job and we are doing it very well."" The Catalans will certainly need to defend better than they did in their last outing against Ajax in losing 2-1 in Amsterdam last November. The four-time European champions are also in need of the points having drawn against PSG at home and APOEL Nicosia away so far in Group F. De Boer will be without one of the heroes of the triumph over Barca last season, though, as South African international Thulani Serero, who scored the opening goal in that game, has been ruled out with a hamstring injury. Nicolai Boilesen has also not travelled with the squad after suffering concussion when on international duty with Denmark. However, forwards Kolbeinn Sigthorsson and Arek Milik will be eying another giant killing after they starred for Iceland and Poland in their respective wins over the Netherlands and Germany recently."
1452,19/10/2014,01:45,"Clasico not decisive, says Barca boss Enrique",Barcelona coach Luis Enrique has said his side's meeting with Real Madrid next weekend is too early to play a decisive role in the La Liga title race.,"The Catalans go into the game at the Santiago Bernabeu with a four-point lead over Madrid after seeing off Eibar 3-0 on Saturday thanks to goals from Xavi, Neymar and Lionel Messi. However, Madrid are also full of confidence having struck 32 times in winning their last seven games in all competitions, including a 5-0 thrashing of Levante on Saturday. ""The ideal scenario would be that Madrid had no points and we had the points we have,"" said Enrique. ""There is such a long way to go it will not be decisive. ""We will approach the game as Barcelona always have going to the Bernabeu in the last few years, trying to be better than our opponent and get a positive result."" However, Enrique warned his players about getting ahead of themselves with a vital Champions League game at home to Ajax to come first on Tuesday. Barca's only defeat so far this season came in their last European outing away to Paris Saint-Germain, leaving the four-time European champions in need of a win to enhance their chances of winning the group. ""It is the same against Ajax,"" added Enrique. ""The same idea and mentality. What concerns me now is that they recover, rest and that they go into the game on Tuesday in the best condition possible."" Messi is on course to make history at the Bernabeu as he moved to within one goal of Telmo Zarra's 59-year-old record as the all-time top goalscorer in La Liga history. And despite missing a number of other opportunities to match, or even surpass Zarra on the evening, Enrique was still full of praise for the contribution made by the four-time World Player of the Year. ""Sometimes I look towards the coach on the other dugout and think how lucky I am to have Messi. ""It is not just what he generates, it gives a huge lift to his teammates to have him in the condition he is in and to add him to the other players is a wonderful thing. It is great to be able to work with these players."" Enrique will have another world class talent to call on from next weekend as Luis Suarez's four-month ban for biting at the World Cup comes to an end. The Uruguayan is officially the most expensive player in Barca's history having sealed a reported £75 million ($125 million, 95 million euro) move from Liverpool in July. However, Barca sporting director Andoni Zubizareta insisted no pressure will be put on Enrique to include Suarez at the Bernabeu. ""Hopefully we will all arrive healthy to the game at the Bernabeu and it will be the coach who decides which players ought to play."""

""It's difficult to evaluate if he's at 70, 80, 90 or 100 percent but what is sure is he feels much better in training,"" said Enrique. ""He's been in a certain dynamic for a while and the fact that he has been able to play for his country has allowed him to rediscover the daily life of a footballer. ""We see him training every day, he's a player like any other and what's clear is that he's not fat. ""He never has been, despite everything that's been said. He's been in shape for several months so everything is fine."" Suarez moved from Liverpool to Barcelona for 95 million euros in the wake of the storm of controversy after he bit Italian defender Girogio Chiellini at the World Cup and was banned for four months. Suarez was banned for nine internationals. Although Suarez has played in friendly matches for both club and country during his ban, scoring twice against Oman on Monday, he has not been allowed to appear in official fixtures. Barcelona lead La Liga after seven matches and host minnows Eibar on Saturday. Suarez said this week, as he received the Golden Boot award for Europe's top score -- which he shared with Cristiano Ronaldo -- that starting with Barcelona was ""a dream come true."" Asked if he was 100 per cent ready for the Real match, he said: ""If you had asked me that a week ago, before the two games with Uruguay, I may have had doubts. ""But I have played in those two (friendly) games and I am probably in better condition than I thought I was. So I think I can say now, yes, 100 per cent, I am ready to play."""
1454,17/10/2014,15:31,Enrique insists Suarez has never been fat,"Barcelona coach Luis Enrique leaped to the defence of controversial striker Luis Suarez on Friday, insisting the Uruguayan has never been overweight.","The former Liverpool forward will be in line to make his debut for the Catalans next week against bitter rivals Real Madrid, when he finally becomes eligible following his ban for biting Girogio Chiellini at the World Cup. Suarez was suspended from all football-related activities for four months and given an additional nine-match international ban for sinking his teeth into the Italian centre-back's shoulder during a group game. Although Suarez has played in friendly matches for both club and country during his ban, scoring twice against Oman on Monday, he has not been allowed to appear in official fixtures. Suarez, 27, was rumoured to have put on weight during his enforced absence but Enrique gave short shrift to such suggestions. ""It's difficult to evaluate if he's at 70, 80, 90 or 100 percent but what is sure is he feels much better in training,"" said Enrique.

Now he is preparing to face Eibar at the Camp Nou on Saturday needing just two goals to equal Telmo Zarra's all-time Spanish top-flight record of 251, set in the 1950s. Messi, who told fans he was ""constantly trying to improve and win more titles,"" has been back at his best in the early weeks of this season to help the Catalans to the top of La Liga with six wins and a draw in their opening seven games. They are two points clear of Valencia and have yet to concede a goal so far, and they will want to keep that form going against Eibar before they go to Real Madrid for the first Clasico of the campaign next weekend. ""To go into the Clasico in the best possible condition we need to win on Saturday,"" said left-back Jordi Alba. ""If we don't win this one we we will suffer when we play in Madrid. Eibar have had good results away from home and if we don't play at a high level they will make it difficult for us."" Eibar will hope that Luis Enrique's side are distracted by thoughts of Madrid and their Champions League meeting with Ajax in midweek, although the Basque side have had an impressive start to the season themselves. The entire population of the town could fit into the Camp Nou three times and still leave empty spaces, but Gaizka Garitano's side, in their debut top-flight season, currently have as many points as their far more illustrious neighbours Athletic Bilbao and Real Sociedad combined. ""This is football and it's clear that if we defend well, don't make mistakes and get a bit of luck, we can come away with at least a point,"" said optimistic midfielder Dani Nieto, formerly of Barcelona B. Real Madrid are fourth, four points behind Barcelona, but the capital club are looking to extend their own fine run of form when they visit struggling Levante. Carlo Ancelotti's side have won six games in a row in all competitions since losing at home to Atletico Madrid last month, and they have scored 27 goals in that time. They have a huge week ahead of them, with a trip to Liverpool in the Champions League on Wednesday before they face Barca, but Ancelotti has confidence in his improving team. ""Since the defeat to Atletico things have gone well,"" remarked the Italian. ""We have had balance to the team and scored a lot of goals. We have conceded more, especially from dead balls, but that is something we are tidying up little by little."" Iker Casillas is expected to remain the club's first-choice goalkeeper for now, meaning Keylor Navas will be on the bench against the club he left in the summer. Meanwhile, champions Atletico host Espanyol on Sunday looking to bounce back from their 3-1 defeat at Valencia before they face Malmo in the Champions League. Valencia are flying high in second after an unbeaten start, although new Spanish international striker Rodrigo has played down their prospects of competing for the title ahead of their trip to Deportivo. ""Football is passion, but people need to be aware of what our aim is and be clear that we are not going to compete for the title this year,"" he said, targeting Champions League qualification instead. Sevilla in third go to Elche while Athletic Bilbao are looking to end a run of seven games without a win when they host Celta Vigo. Fixtures (all times GMT)"

In addition, he has become the top all-time scorer in the club's history. On Saturday, when Barcelona host promoted Eibar, the Argentine could also equal or overtake the all-time record of striker Telmo Zarra, the top scorer in La Liga with 251 goals. Messi, 27, has 249 goals in the Spanish league. If he fails this weekend he has another golden opportunity the following weekend in the Clasico against eternal rivals Real Madrid."

Here are some landmark dates in his career since:,"-- October 16, 2004: Messi made his league debut for Barcelona against city rivals Espanyol.

""I will remember those 10 minutes my whole life,"" he said after. -- May 1, 2005: His first competitive goal for Barcelona came against Albacete. This time Messi came on as an 87th minute replacement for Samuel Eto'o. He has now notched up 249 Spanish league goals for his club. Barcelona won the La Liga title the same month, the first of Messi's six league crowns so far. -- August 17, 2005: Argentina fans could not wait for the protege to make his international debut, but it finished almost as quickly as it began. He came on as a second half substitute against Hungary, but was sent off within two minutes for elbowing an opponent. -- March 1, 2006: Messi scored his first international goal in Argentina's 3-2 defeat of Croatia. -- June 11, 2006: Messi played his first World Cup finals game as Argentina romped to a 6-0 first-round thrashing of Serbia and Montenegro. He bagged the final goal too and was the youngest scorer in the tournament in Germany. -- July 7, 2007: At his first Copa America tournament, Messi starred alongside Hernan Crespo and Juan Roman Riquelme as Argentina stormed to the final. Messi scored in the quarter and semi-finals before Argentina fell 3-0 to Brazil in the final. -- August 23, 2008: Barcelona tried to force Messi to forgo the chance to take part in the Beijing 2008 Olympic Games.

He scored the second goal as Barcelona beat Manchester United 2-0 in Rome for his first real Champions League win. -- December 1, 2009: Having come third then second in the two previous years, Messi was voted Ballon D'Or in 2009. It was the start of a record run of four straight triumphs in the contest. Real Madrid rival Cristiano Ronaldo managed to outdo him in 2013. -- July 13, 2014: Heartbreak for Messi. The Argentine maestro scored and laid on priceless goals as he reached his first World Cup final. Messi had chances to score but it was Germany's Mario Goetze who got the extra-time goal that stole the game. Messi won the Golden Ball as player of the tournament."

Now with Barcelona, the 27-year-old shared the award with Real Madrid's Cristiano Ronaldo, who ended the campaign with the same tally. Suarez, who is due to end his four month World Cup biting ban against Real on Saturday week, said: ""I want to thank all the most important people in my life, my wife and my children. ""And of course everyone at Liverpool - all my colleagues, not just last year but over the whole three and a half years I was at the club. ""They were spectacular years and it was thanks to this man here (Dalglish) that they signed me, that they noticed me. ""Now I am moving on to a new period, and I have to enjoy this next stage of my life - it is a dream come true."" His former boss at Anfield Dalglish was asked how he though Suarez would get on at the Nou Camp. The Scot replied: ""I don't think there will be anybody who will be able to stop him. ""He has been fantastic everywhere he has been - a huge success and fabulously entertaining. There is no reason why he won't continue that for Barcelona.

1459,14/10/2014,17:56,Suarez in tell all interview ahead of Real return,Barcelona striker Luis Suarez spoke candidly on Tuesday about his infamous World Cup bite and the Patrice Evra racism row ahead of his return at Real Madrid.,"The 27-year-old goal-king is coming to the end of a four-month ban for biting Italy's Giorgio Chiellini at the World Cup, his third such offence and one he long denied before coming clean. After a diet of training and friendlies he will be available to make his competitive Barcelona debut against Real on October 25. Reflecting on the Chiellini attack he told his club's website: ""I'm only human and sometimes it's hard to face the truth. ""I found it hard to take in and to realise what I had done. Those were days when I didn't want to know about it,"" he explained. ""I didn't want to listen to anybody, or speak to anybody. I didn't want to accept it,"" he added. The controversial striker however remained unrepentant over a 2011 incident where he was found guilty of racially abusing Manchester United's Patrice Evra. He was eventually banned for eight games after being found guilty of repeatedly making reference to Evra's ethnic origin. ""I was accused without evidence and that's what grieved me the most,"" the Uruguayan said. ""The others were actions when it was me who did wrong. I accepted that and begged forgiveness, but the racism thing, when I was accused without evidence, that did upset me,"" commented Suarez, who received widespread support in Uruguay, but was also heavily fined in England for the offence. The racism incident and the Chiellini bite helped pave the way for his 81 million euros (£65 million, $109 million) transfer from Liverpool to Barcelona in July, the striker feeling the Catalan giants were a better platform for his brilliance. ""If I hadn't had the attitude and mentality to lead the team, I don't think Liverpool would have done as well as they did,"" Suarez told Barcelona's site, referring to Liverpool's stunning 2013-2014 run of wins that saw them miss the Premier League title by a hair's breadth. Suarez also spoke at length of his comeback match, saying the Saturday week clash with ""Real Madrid in the Spanish capital was written into his destiny. ""You know, I'm the kind of person who believes that things happen for a reason, and out of all 19 team in the league, it's precisely against Real Madrid at the Bernabeu that I'll make my comeback. ""There must be a reason."""
1460,03/10/2014,19:39,Spanish court rejects Messi tax fraud appeal,Barcelona star Lionel Messi on Friday moved closer to facing trial over alleged tax fraud after a Spanish court rejected his appeal against being named in the case and ordered the probe to go ahead.,"The Argentine forward and his father, Jorge Horacio Messi, were accused last year of not paying 4.16 million euros ($5.26m, 3.26m pounds) in tax on earnings from the player's image rights from 2007-2009 through the creation of a web of shell companies in Belize and Uruguay. Both Messi and his father, who is also the player's manager, denied wrongdoing and pointed the finger instead at a former agent of the player when they were quizzed at a court in Gava, the Barcelona suburb where the player lives, in September 2013. Based on the Messis' testimony, public prosecutors called for the case to be shelved. But the court in July ruled that there was ""sufficient evidence"" to believe Messi ""could have known and consented"" to the creation of a fictitious corporate structure to avoid paying taxes on income from his image rights and ordered the prosecution of the case to go ahead. Messi's lawyers appealed but on Friday the court said it had ""dismissed entirely"" their petition and upheld its earlier ruling. ""In this type of crime, it is not necessary for someone to have complete knowledge of all the accounting and business operations nor the exact quantity, rather it is sufficient to be aware of the designs to commit fraud and consent to them,"" the court said in its ruling. Messi and his father have five days to appeal the court's ruling. If the court rejects that appeal, prosecutors will have to formally ask the court to send him to trial -- a move which Messi's legal team can again appeal. If the court agrees there is enough evidence to send the player to trial, it will then set a date. Messi can appeal this decision as well. The player's father made a payment of five million euros in August 2013 to cover alleged unpaid taxes, plus interests. That was thought likely to significantly reduce any sentence should they be found guilty. Messi, 27, won the Ballon d'Or title four times between 2009 and 2012, but lost his crown last year to Real Madrid's Portuguese star Cristiano Ronaldo. He is the fourth richest sportsperson in the world, according to a ranking published in June by Forbes business magazine. The player moved up to fourth from 10th place in just a year with an annual income of just under $65 million, it said. Between 2007 and 2009 he earned more than 10.17 million euros in image rights, including contracts with Adidas, Danone, Pepsi-Cola, Procter and Gamble, and the Kuwait Food Company. Spain has been cracking down on tax evasion as it fights to repair the country's public finances after the collapse of a decade-long property bubble in 2008 tipped the economy into a deep double-dip recession."

Their partnership has been one of the keys to La Liga leaders Barcelona's success so far this season with Neymar scoring four of his six goals from Messi passes. Argentine Messi said his partnership with Neymar was becoming increasingly efficient as he hailed the Brazilian as ""a great player"". ""It's the second season that we're playing together and we're starting to know each other better,"" said Messi. ""As well this season the (Barca) strikers play more in the middle of the pitch so we can pick each other out more and find connections. It's a pleasure to play with him ... We've a very good relationship, he's a fabulous boy."" Messi added that their partnership was helped by ""the freedom"" that coach Luis Enrique gives the Argentine on the pitch. ""The coach told me I could go where I wanted. Sometimes I move back a little to try to make the final pass and to create,"" explained Messi. Messi won the Ballon d'Or title four times between 2009 and 2012, but lost his crown last year to Real Madrid's Portuguese star Cristiano Ronaldo. But he insisted that thoughts of reclaiming the title were far from his mind. ""I've repeated it several times, I'm not in competition with Cristiano. I play my game, I do my work and I'm not interested in rivalry with him or anyone else. ""Individual awards are those that matter least to me, I want to have a great year and make sure my team achieve their goals."" The Argentine added that he expected Neymar to win the title at some stage in the future. ""He's going to get it, through his qualities, the way he is, I've no doubt that he can at some time win it,"" said 27-year-old Messi. ""He has great potential, he's a player who has a lot of qualities and he can go as far as he wants. I'm lucky enough to rub shoulders with terrific players on the pitch and he's among them."""
1463,01/10/2014,19:51,"Real offered 150 mln for Neymar, father tells court",Neymar's father and agent told a Spanish court investigating alleged tax fraud in his son's signing by Barcelona that the player rejected a much higher offer from Real Madrid of 150 million euros ($190 million).,"Barcelona initially said the signing of the 22-year-old player from Brazilian side Santos in May 2012 cost them 57.1 million euros. But after questions were raised about the deal by a Barcelona club member, the club in January revealed the deal was worth 86.2 million euros when including the player's signing bonus, commission, marketing deals and other agreements. The club member, Jordi Cases, accused former Barcelona president Sandro Rossell of misappropriation for not declaring publicly that 40 million euros of the initial figure quoted by Barcelona was paid to N&amp;N, a company controlled by Neymar's parents. As a result Barcelona were indicted in February for tax fraud. During questioning at Madrid's National Court on Wednesday, the player's father, Neymar Da Silva Santos Sr, said Real offered 150 million euros for his son but the player preferred Barcelona's offer because the Catalan side had a greater ""international projection"", a court source said. He also told the court that his son's contracts with Barcelona were all legal, the source added. Whilst giving testimony in July, Rosell told the court that all contracts related to Neymar's signing ""were done perfectly"" and respected the law. Rossell stepped down in January over the affair. In April, the Spanish league said it believed there was nothing irregular about the Neymar signing. Earlier this year Barcelona made a voluntary tax payment of 13.5 million euros to normalise the situation and avoid the club's name being further tarnished. Neymar is back to full fitness after missing the World Cup semi-final and third-place playoff in his home country with a serious back injury picked up in the quarter-final victory over Colombia. He made an excellent start to the 2014-15 season with the Catalan side, scoring six goals in five La Liga appearances this season."
1464,01/10/2014,02:06,Enrique: Responsibility for Barca defeat is mine,Barcelona coach Luis Enrique refused to point the finger at his defence after the Catalans went down 3-2 to Paris Saint-Germain in Champions League Group F on Tuesday.,"""I don't like to evaluate individual performances when we lose a game. We are all responsible, above all me,"" he said after suffering his first defeat since being appointed in the summer. ""We will analyse in depth what we did wrong to try and ensure these things don't happen again."" Barca had received praise after going unbeaten through their opening seven matches this season, keeping seven clean sheets in the process. However, with Marc-Andre ter Stegen selected in goal rather than Claudio Bravo and with Gerard Pique left on the bench, Barca's defence was made to look ordinary. David Luiz put the French champions ahead in the 10th minute, breaching the visitors' defence for the first time this season after 640 minutes, and PSG's smallest player Marco Verratti was allowed to head in a corner to make it 2-1 after Lionel Messi had equalised with his 68th Champions League goal. Blaise Matuidi added a third, and while Neymar pulled another one back, Barcelona could not equalise and slumped to a fifth loss in nine Champions League away games. ""We committed very clear errors in bringing the ball out from the back,"" added Enrique. ""From set-pieces they are very strong, and when you are behind it requires an awful lot of effort to try and get back into the game."" However, he said his side were perhaps unfortunate not to come away with a draw after putting their hosts under constant pressure in the closing stages. ""We already knew their potential. They are candidates to win the Champions League; they won their league last season. ""We were up against a rival of the same level as us and the difficulties we had were normal in such a game, but in the last 25 minutes we could have equalised. ""In the end I think we could have drawn and it would have been a fair result."" Barcelona were unable to build on their opening Group F win against APOEL two weeks ago, although a 1-1 draw between the Cypriots and Ajax in the night's other game did little to help these sides' prospects of progressing to the last 16. Meanwhile, it was a night of great satisfaction for Paris coach Laurent Blanc, who had been under growing pressure following his team's sluggish start to the season, even if they have yet to lose a match. The Ligue 1 club drew 1-1 at Ajax a fortnight ago and came into this encounter without injured talisman Zlatan Ibrahimovic as well as Ezequiel Lavezzi and Thiago Silva. Despite that, they went one better than in April 2013, when a 2-2 draw against the same opponents led to them being eliminated from the competition in the quarter-finals. ""I am very satisfied. I think for those who like Paris Saint-Germain and French football it was a good evening,"" said Blanc, whose side are five points behind leaders Marseille in Ligue 1 yet harbour ambitions of going all the way in the Champions League. ""I will remember this win, as will the players and all those who were at the stadium. We do this job to live nights like these."" ""I don't deny that our start to the season has been a bit more complicated than we wished, but tonight, the smell, the Champions League, Barcelona, subconsciously you are more determined. ""On nights like tonight you either rediscover your team or find yourself at the bottom of a hole."" Blanc, who was a team-mate of Luis Enrique at the Camp Nou for a season in the 1990s, added: ""They hadn't conceded a goal yet. With the staff we have watched a lot of their matches and we realised that in all of them their opponents had chances to score goals. ""I played at Barcelona and I know that as a defender they take lots of risks. We had an inferior amount of the ball, which is rare, but despite that we created chances and scored three."
1465,30/09/2014,22:45,PSG edge Barcelona in five-goal thriller,Paris Saint-Germain overcame the absence of their injured talisman Zlatan Ibrahimovic to beat Barcelona 3-2 in a thrilling Champions League Group F encounter at the Parc des Princes on Tuesday.,"The Catalans, who had not even conceded a goal all season in seven matches before this one, fell behind inside 10 minutes when David Luiz prodded in his first PSG goal. Barcelona needed just two minutes to draw level thanks to a marvellous Lionel Messi strike, but Marco Verratti headed the hosts back in front after 26 minutes and Blaise Matuidi added another in the 54th minute. Neymar reduced the deficit, yet Paris held on for their first win in the group after a 1-1 draw at Ajax two weeks ago, while Barca failed to build on a narrow 1-0 win over APOEL of Cyprus in their first outing. Barcelona arrived in France in fine form but this was billed as their biggest test since the arrival of Luis Enrique as coach in the summer, even if their hosts were denied the services of Ezequiel Lavezzi and captain Thiago Silva as well as the prolific Ibrahimovic. Edinson Cavani spearheaded their attack, while Barcelona again had Marc-Andre ter Stegen in goal in Europe rather than La Liga regular Claudio Bravo. But their previously watertight defence looked rather fragile against a PSG side who started with all guns blazing and were soon rewarded. Daniel Alves gave away a free-kick for stopping a Paris attack with his hand, and the home side opened the scoring from the resulting delivery, Luiz controlling Lucas's ball in from the left before turning and poking the ball into the far corner from eight yards. Barcelona's defence had finally been breached for the first time this season after 640 minutes, but their response was immediate. Indeed, the celebrations were still ongoing when the Catalans drew level thanks to a moment of trademark brilliance, Messi exchanging lightning-quick first-time passes with Andres Iniesta and Neymar before giving Salvatore Sirigu in goal no chance with a left-foot strike into the far corner. It was the Argentine's 68th Champions League goal, putting him level with his great rival Cristiano Ronaldo in the all-time standings and to within three of the competition's all-time leading scorer, Raul. However, PSG were not deterred, and while Neymar lifted the ball just over the bar following a lofted pass into the box by Messi, the home side regained the advantage in the 26th minute. Again the goal came from a set-piece, and this time Barcelona's defence looked especially unsure of themselves, ter Stegen flapping at a Thiago Motta right-wing corner and Ivan Rakitic allowing Verratti, the smallest player in the PSG side, to head into the net at the far post to score his first goal for the club. Barcelona trailed despite having almost 60 percent of the possession in the first half, with Messi curling a free-kick just over the bar a minute prior to the break. PSG were simply the more clinical of the two teams and extended their advantage nine minutes after the restart, a Gregory van der Wiel cross from near the right corner flag flashing all the way across the penalty box for Matuidi - who scored in the last meeting of the clubs here 18 months ago - to convert. Again Barcelona needed just two minutes to muster a response, Neymar getting his seventh of the season with a delightful control and calm side-footed finish into the net off the right-hand post. They then camped around the penalty box as they went in search of a leveller, but Marquinhos produced a crucial flying block to prevent Jordi Alba from equalising before substitute Munir El Haddadi fizzed in a shot that grazed the outside of the right post and went wide."
1466,29/09/2014,19:48,Luis Enrique already prepared for Barca criticism,Luis Enrique has enjoyed a fine start to his time as coach of Barcelona but he is already bracing himself for criticism when his side finally slip up.,"The Catalans have won five and drawn one of their opening six matches in La Liga, all without conceding, and also beat APOEL of Cyprus 1-0 in their opening Champions League Group F game two weeks ago. But Tuesday's meeting with Paris Saint-Germain in the French capital will be his biggest test since being appointed in the summer and the Barca coach knows that the intense media scrutiny at the club means criticism is inevitable if and when they come unstuck. ""The defenders that we have are all very good and are all capable of playing,"" he said when questioned about his side's record of clean sheets despite constant changes in personnel at the back. ""As soon as we even concede a goal it will be because of me rotating the squad. ""That's football. I know where I am and what job I am in but I will keep doing what I consider to be the fairest thing and the best thing for my team."" The German Marc-Andre ter Stegen could again start a Champions League game in goal in place of Claudio Bravo, who has been the first-choice 'keeper in La Liga, while Gerard Pique and Jordi Alba are set to return to the defence after sitting out Saturday's 6-0 defeat of Granada. Barcelona are looking to end PSG's 29-game unbeaten run at home in Europe at the same venue where they drew 2-2 in the first leg of their quarter-final tie in 2012-13 before progressing on away goals, when the late Tito Vilanova was in charge. ""I can barely remember two seasons ago but I would have seen the match,"" said the current coach. ""What I expect from PSG is that they are a team who will compete with us and try to take us on. ""There is no doubt that they are capable of that. They have the quality. They are one of the contenders to win the Champions League."" But Luis Enrique, who played alongside Paris coach Laurent Blanc at Barca under Bobby Robson back in the 1996-97 campaign, insisted that the loss of Zlatan Ibrahimovic does not change anything from his viewpoint. ""It doesn't change anything for us whether Zlatan plays or not. His absence is a big one, it would be for any team, but they remain a fearsome, dangerous opponent."" Swedish striker Ibrahimovic has been ruled out of the match against his former club after failing to respond sufficiently to treatment on the heel problem that his kept him out of his side's last two matches."
1467,29/09/2014,19:09,PSG without Ibrahimovic against Barcelona,"Paris Saint-Germain star Zlatan Ibrahimovic will miss Tuesday's Champions League clash with Barcelona at the Parc des Princes due to a nagging heel problem, the French club have confirmed.","""As the different tests carried out this morning on the problem with his left heel were not satisfactory, Zlatan Ibrahimovic is out of the match against Barcelona,"" said a statement released by PSG on Monday. Ibrahimovic, who played for Barcelona in the 2009-10 season, had already missed his club's last two games in Ligue 1. Without him, Laurent Blanc's side performed poorly in a 1-1 draw at Toulouse on Saturday and they are under pressure to get a result against the Catalans after opening their Group F campaign with a 1-1 draw with Ajax in Amsterdam two weeks ago. Ibrahimovic is joined on the sidelines by captain and centre-back Thiago Silva, who has not played since early August because of a thigh injury, and Argentine forward Ezequiel Lavezzi, who has a hamstring problem. However, Blanc said that he was not surprised at the news his Swedish talisman would miss the encounter and remains hopeful his side can get a result in his absence. ""This morning he was having treatment but in truth I had already started to prepare for this game knowing that he probably wouldn't be there,"" Blanc told a press conference at the Parc des Princes on Monday afternoon. ""It certainly won't be easy, we know that. Last year we played difficult games without Ibra. ""We have other attacking players of great quality and we will need to compensate for his absence by producing an even better team performance."" Blanc added that Ibrahimovic faces a race against time to be ready in time for next Sunday's home meeting with Monaco, PSG's final outing before the October international break. ""We will see how it evolves, but obviously the medical staff are doing all they can to get him ready,"" he said. Last season, Paris beat Chelsea 3-1 in the first leg of their quarter-final tie but Ibrahimovic picked up an injury in that game and missed the return, which Chelsea won 2-0 to advance on away goals. Barcelona's French defender Jeremy Mathieu admitted that the absence of Ibrahimovic was good news for the away side. ""It is an advantage for us. He has a massive influence on their game and makes the difference in practically every match,"" said Mathieu."
1468,29/09/2014,16:35,Blanc puts faith in PSG philosophy for Barca clash,Paris Saint-Germain coach Laurent Blanc says there is no question of his side giving up their footballing philosophy in Tuesday's Champions League Group F encounter with Barcelona.,"Blanc's team won many plaudits for their attractive brand of possession football last season as they romped to the Ligue 1 title and reached the Champions League quarter-finals for the second season running, losing on away goals to Chelsea. But putting the emphasis on keeping possession means they will be taking on Barcelona -- the masters at the art of keeping the ball -- at their own game, and the PSG coach believes that is a risk worth taking. ""In my view we need to prepare to play the way the players are used to playing. If we start doing things that we are not used to, that is when we will put ourselves in danger,"" said Blanc at a press conference on the eve of the match at the Parc des Princes. A style of football that produced spectacular results at times last season has not prevented Paris from enduring a sluggish start to this campaign. The French champions are yet to lose but three draws in their last four Ligue 1 games have left them five points behind leaders Marseille while a 1-1 draw at Ajax two weeks ago means there is added pressure on them to get a result on Tuesday. But their way of playing is one that the former France defender has advocated since spending a season on the books at the Camp Nou in 1996-97 alongside the likes of former coach Pep Guardiola and current Barca coach Luis Enrique, and now Blanc is ready to take them on at their own game. ""Barcelona have always been one of my favourite teams, above all for their style of play,"" he said. ""I know some people like them and others don't, but they always play good football and score goals. ""I only played there for one year but I was very proud to wear their colours. But I have prepared a PSG team to beat Barcelona. We need to have that mentality. ""I think Paris Saint-Germain will rediscover their level and performances of last season by playing football, sticking to the philosophy we used last year. ""You can see where Barcelona have got by sticking to a system for 40 years. It will be an extraordinary game. We will put in a great performance tomorrow if we stick to our philosophy but add a bit more agression, especially when we don't have the ball. ""And that is all the more important because we know that Barca, when they have the ball, are very difficult to stop."" Blanc is also confident his side will create chances against opponents who are yet to concede a single goal in seven matches in all competitions this season, including a 1-0 victory over APOEL of Cyprus on matchday one and a 6-0 trouncing of Granada in La Liga at the weekend. ""I've seen all Barca's games this season and in every match their opponents have had chances,"" he said, with Edinson Cavani charged with the task of leading the attack in the absence of former Barca star Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who has a heel problem. Brazilian full-back Maxwell, another member of the PSG squad to have enjoyed a spell at the Camp Nou, insisted that his old team's run without conceding cannot last much longer. ""They have got back their intensity at winning the ball back,"" he said. ""It is the philosophy that Guardiola had too. But it's not impossible (to score against them). Some day they need to concede and I hope it will be tomorrow."""

1471,29/09/2014,02:15,New-look Barcelona ready for first big test in Paris,Barcelona face their first big test of the Luis Enrique era when they face Paris Saint-Germain in the French capital in the Champions League on Tuesday.,"The Catalans looked sluggish in the 1-0 win against APOEL that kicked-off their Group F campaign a fortnight ago, but they travel to France having won six and drawn one of seven matches altogether this season, and are yet to concede a single goal under their new coach. Their performance in tearing apart Granada in La Liga on Saturday, when Neymar scored a hat-trick and Lionel Messi netted twice in a 6-0 victory, would have made for ominous viewing for anyone with PSG connections. ""At the moment I don't see any player who isn't capable of putting in a good performance in Paris and that for me is an advantage,"" said Luis Enrique, who welcomes Gerard Pique and Jordi Alba back into his squad for the match at the Parc des Princes after both were rested against Granada. That duo are both almost certain to start in a meeting of the two favourites to progress to the last 16 from the section, while there is no question of Messi, who is the only player to have started all seven games for Barca this season, being rested yet. ""I prefer to see him on the pitch until the last minute to press and participate in our collective play,"" added the coach. ""The temptation is there, it could happen at any point in the season, but his habitat is on the field."" The biggest doubt surrounds who will start in goal, with Claudio Bravo having kept a clean sheet in all six domestic games so far while fellow summer recruit Marc-Andre ter Stegen was preferred against APOEL. Either way, the newly watertight Barcelona defence will expect to endure a tough evening in the first meeting of the clubs since the quarter-final clash in April 2013, when Paris came away with a draw in both legs but were eliminated on away goals. Since then, Carlo Ancelotti has been replaced in the PSG dugout by Laurent Blanc, who played alongside Luis Enrique at the Camp Nou for a season in the 1990s. PSG, like their opponents, are still unbeaten in the current campaign but all the pressure on Tuesday will be on Blanc, whose side are yet to convince this season and yet will be expected to take the game to Barca in front of their own fans. Paris may already be a European superpower in financial terms but now they crave real success on the continent after being eliminated from the Champions League at the quarter-final stage in each of the last two seasons. Meanwhile, a lack of motivation for the less glamorous challenges in store in Ligue 1 has been suggested by some as the reason for their sluggish recent displays, but a run of four draws in their last five matches includes a 1-1 stalemate at Ajax in their Group F opener. On Saturday, Blanc rotated his squad and tried out a new formation against Toulouse but was only rewarded with another 1-1 stalemate. ""We are aware that last season we dominated the league and this year, with the same team and the same coach, we are not winning matches so easily,"" admitted Blanc, who played down talk that his side might now be fearing the prospect of facing Barcelona. ""Do we need to be worried because we didn't win? If we had won, we would maybe be more confident. Barcelona are a great team. Everyone knows that. ""Barcelona is a different competition, and even if we are having difficulty and certain things worry me, the spirit is good. The players are putting in a lot of effort, perhaps more than last season when they were winning matches 3-0 or 4-0."" The home side are not helped, however, by fitness problems to key players, with Ezequiel Lavezzi joining captain Thiago Silva on the sidelines. In addition, former Barcelona striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic, PSG's talisman, has missed the last two games with a heel problem and is a doubt."
1472,27/09/2014,22:38,Messi 'never imagined' reaching 400-goal mark,Four-time World Player of the Year Lionel Messi said he could never have envisaged scoring 400 goals in his career after passing that landmark in Barcelona's 6-0 rout over Granada on Saturday.,"The Argentine scored twice and took his tally of assists for the season to eight with two more as Neymar bagged a hat-trick to take Barca back to the top of the table. Messi's two goals took him to 359 goals for Barca allied to his 42 at international level in 525 games for club and country. ""I never imagined I could achieve anything like this in my career,"" he said via his official Facebook page. ""Thanks for all the congratulations on scoring 400 goals with FC Barcelona and the Argentinian National Team. I'll continue working hard to reach more targets."" Messi is the only player to have started all seven games under new Barca boss Luis Enrique as the 44-year-old has been otherwise keen to rotate his squad. But Enrique admitted even he is enjoying watching the 27-year-old too much to hand him a break. ""I don't think if we added together the goals we have scored on the playground it would reach 400,"" he said in his post-match press conference. ""Messi is someone who has been touched by a magic wand and he is desperate to enjoy playing football. ""I prefer to see him on the pitch until the last minute to press and participate in our collective play. ""The temptation is there, it could happen at any point in the season, but his habitat is on the field. ""He is very intelligent and knows how to manage his efforts and he is one of the players who presses the most. I am confident his physical ability is up to that of being the number one."" Next up for Barca is their biggest test of the season so far as they travel to face French champions Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions League. However, Enrique insisted he is confident that whatever team he selects they will be capable of leaving the Parc des Princes with three points. ""At the moment I don't see any player who isn't capable of puting in a good performance in Paris and that for me is an advantage. ""We are moving forward with everyone, the team is showing reliability in important aspects of the team independent of who plays."" The root of that confidence comes from not only Barca's supreme attacking resources in Messi and Neymar, but also a stellar defensive record as they have yet to concede a goal in seven games this season. ""To be able to attack well you need a good attack, to be well organised and, when the opposition have the ball, the first objective is that the don't progress,"" added Enrique. ""It is very important for us to be efficient with and without the ball. To be efficient in all phases. ""The players are showing their commitment to being strong defensively."""
1473,26/09/2014,17:58,Charges against Barcelona president dropped in Neymar affair,"Prosecutors in Spain have dropped charges against Barcelona president Josep Maria Bartomeu over alleged tax irregularities concerning the signing of Brazil star Neymar, according to a judgement made public on Friday.","The magistrate investigating the case in Madrid agreed with the decision of the public prosecutor to drop charges against Bartomeu and the club's vice-president Javier Faus, who looks after the club's finances. Barcelona initially said that the signing of Neymar had cost them 57.1 million euros ($72.5m, £44.6m). However, one of Barcelona's own members, or 'socios', Jordi Cases, accused the club's former president Sandro Rosell of misappropriation for not declaring publicly that 40 million of the figure quoted by Barca was paid to N&amp;N, a company controlled by Neymar's parents. Judge Pablo Ruz widened his investigation earlier this year when he decided that there was ""sufficient evidence to investigate a possible crime against the public treasury"". Barcelona and Rosell, who stepped down in January, were accused of irregularities in the deal, which was worth a total figure of just over 86 million euros. But on Friday the judge concluded that there was no reason to pursue charges against Bartomeu and Faus, former right-hand men of Rosell under the previous presidency and who signed certain incriminating documents. Ruz ruled there was not enough evidence to suggest that the two had ""actively participated in the facts under investigation"". Prosecutor Jose Perals said that, in the case of the alleged tax crimes, responsibility falls to the club as a whole and Rosell, as he was president at the time. The Barcelona board have been rattled for several months by the investigation into the signing of Neymar in the spring of 2013 and the father of the Brazilian star is still due to appear as a witness on October 1 as part of the case. Bartomeu tried to calm the controversy after taking over as president by disclosing the exact figures of the transfer, which was valued at 86.2 million euros, and paying 13.5 million euros to the public purse. Rosell, who gave evidence for several hours on July 22, insisted before the judge that the transfer was carried out legally, affirming that ""the contracts were perfectly drawn up""."

Former Arsenal captain Thomas Vermaelen was also making his first appearance in a Barca shirt after recovering from a hamstring injury and he opened the scoring early on. Suarez then latched onto a lovely pass from another of the Catalans' summer purchases, 18-year-old Croatian international Alen Halilovic, and fired into the far corner. David Babunski made it three with a fine strike as Barca toyed with the inexperienced visitors and Bicho slotted home a fourth early in the second-half after replacing Vermaelen. Suarez showed his quality once more with a fine curling left-footed effort for the fifth before passing up the opportunity of a hat-trick as he stood aside to allow Maxi Rolon to round off the scoring from the penalty spot."

However, Luis Enrique insists the true title credentials of all three sides won't become clear until well into the New Year. ""Last year there were three outstanding teams that barely lost which made for a very exciting championship. This year it could be the same, or it could be different,"" he said on Tuesday ahead of his side's trip to Malaga on Wednesday. ""Valencia and Sevilla also look very good and I am sure Atletico and Real Madrid will be up there fighting with us. We have only played four games so it is all still to come. ""From March we will see not necessarily which teams will win the title, but at least which teams are in the position to compete to win it. ""It is September 23. We want to improve after every game and continue winning points, but the final objective is a long way away."" Worryingly for Barca's rivals their 100 percent start to the campaign has come with Uruguayan star Luis Suarez still serving a four-month suspension he picked up for biting an opponent for a third time in his career at the World Cup in June. Suarez won't be available for a return to action until Barca's first clash with Real Madrid this season on October 25, but the coach confirmed he will continue to step up his match fitness by playing in a friendly between Barca B and Indonesia under-19s on Wednesday. ""From a coach's point of view it is beneficial that he plays. This one is a bit different because it is not with his team, but the youth team and against another under-19 team. ""There are a lot of caveats, but we have spoken and the player wants to play despite it being in a different context and so he will play the minutes (Barca B coach) Eusebio thinks best."" Other than Suarez, Luis Enrique will have a full squad to choose from for the trip to Malaga as Ivan Rakitic and Neymar have recovered from minor knocks they suffered in the 5-0 thrashing of Levante on Sunday."
1476,21/09/2014,22:55,"Messi, Neymar on target as Barca thrash Levante",Barcelona overcame a missed penalty from Lionel Messi to return to the top of La Liga with a 5-0 win away to 10-man Levante on Sunday.,"Neymar opened the scoring with a simple finish from Messi's through ball before the Argentine star missed from the spot for the 12th time in his career after Loukas Vyntra had seen red for tripping him inside the area. However, it mattered little as Ivan Rakitic's fierce strike made it 2-0 before half-time and goals from Sandro Ramirez, Pedro Rodriguez and Messi rounded off the scoring after the break to make it four wins in four La Liga games without conceding a goal for Barca. Luis Enrique recalled many of his rested stars for Wednesday's 1-0 win over APOEL Nicosia in the Champions League as he made eight changes in all with only Messi, Neymar and Dani Alves retaining their places in the side. However, only a last-ditch challenge from Rakitic prevented Victor Casadesus turning home Jose Luis Morales's cross at the far post to give the side rooted to the foot of the table a shock lead after 15 minutes. Barca then slowly began to take charge and after Jordi Alba fired wastefully off target, Neymar was denied at the end of a flowing move by a brave block from Jesus Fernandez. The Brazilian got the better of Fernandez just after the half hour mark, though, as he latched onto Messi's ball over the top and rounded the 'keeper before slotting home his third goal of the season. Barca looked to have the game sealed when Messi was then tripped inside the area and Greek defender Vyntra harshly sent-off for denying a clear goalscoring opportunity. Messi picked himself up to take the resulting spot-kick, but blasted his effort high and wide of the target. The Argentine's blushes were spared as Rakitic rifled in his first goal for the club from outside the box shortly afterwards to ensure the visitors led 2-0 at the break. There was a brief scare for Barca when Neymar went down with an ankle injury at the start of the second period, but his protestations at being replaced by Sandro suggest the injury shouldn't keep him out of Wednesday's trip to Malaga. Sandro then got himself on the scoresheet as he became the latest recipient of a Messi assist with a low right-footed finish. Pedro registered his first goal of the season to make it 4-0 26 minutes from time as he rolled the ball into an empty net after a lovely one-two between Alba and Sandro. And Messi finally got his reward for another fine performance when he pounced on a poor clearance from Fernandez and lobbed the ball over the 'keeper for his third goal of the campaign. Earlier, Sevilla had briefly moved top with a 3-1 win at Cordoba thanks to two goals from Colombian international Carlos Bacca. Villarreal moved into the top six as they came from 2-0 down to beat Rayo Vallecano 4-2 at home, but Real Sociedad failed to move into the top half of the table as they were shocked 2-1 at home by Almeria."
1477,20/09/2014,14:31,"Suarez already a good signing, says Enrique",Barcelona boss Luis Enrique believes Luis Suarez has already proved his worth despite not having even played a competitive game since his £75 million move from Liverpool.,"The Uruguayan will still be unavailable for over a month after receiving a four-month ban for biting Italian defender Giorgio Chiellini at the World Cup in June. Suarez could make his debut in Enrique's first El Clasico in charge of Barca away to Real Madrid on October 25. And Enrique believes the 27-year-old's attitude in training has already made him an important signing for the club. ""He is adapting and waiting for his opportunity. He is training as if he could play tomorrow and that was our objective. ""Already, even without playing, I think he is helping us and has been a good signing."" Barca have started Enrique's reign with four consecutive wins and four clean sheets for the first time in the club's history. However, the former Celta Vigo coach still received criticism for making nine changes as the Catalans struggled past APOEL Nicosia 1-0 to open their Champions League campaign on Wednesday. There are likely to be another wave of changes for Sunday's trip to bottom of the table Levante. Enrique insisted he will continue to rotate his squad throughout the season and hinted even Lionel Messi wouldn't be excluded from his changes from game to game. ""Over the course of the season I am going to need all my players. The priority just now is Levante and we will see where we are after that. ""Being without Messi would affect us like any other team. If he could play every minute he would, but I understand that is difficult. ""I will manage it as best I can, but always thinking about what is best for the team."""
1478,18/09/2014,02:20,Xavi content with bit-part role,Barcelona midfielder Xavi Hernandez insisted he hasn't been frustrated by his lack of opportunities under new boss Luis Enrique after starting for the first time this season in a much-changed side in a 1-0 victory over APOEL Nicosia on Wednesday.,"Gerard Pique's first-half header was enough to hand the Catalans an unconvincing winning start to their Champions League campaign against the Cypriot champions. Xavi started alongside youngsters Sergi Samper and Sergi Roberto in midfield as Enrique made nine changes in all from the side that started Saturday's 2-0 win over Athletic Bilbao. ""I am happy. When my turn to play comes I will try to be useful,"" said the 34-year-old, who moved level with Real Madrid legend Raul for the all-time record of Champions League appearances with 142. Despite the presence of Lionel Messi and Neymar in attack, Barca struggled to create clear-cut chances against the mass ranks of the APOEL defence and Xavi admitted the lack of fluidity in the final third. ""We struggled. We tried to move the ball quickly and we didn't manage to do it,"" he added. ""It is true we dominated. We tried through the middle and wide, but they defended very well. ""In the end it was a tiring game, but we have won and we have to treat it like it is. It is always good to start the group stage with three points,"" The narrow victory was enough to take Barca to the top of Group F as French champions Paris Saint-Germain were held 1-1 in Amsterdam by Ajax. Next up for Barca in Europe is a trip to Paris on September 30 and Enrique admitted that a run of six games in 18 days had been part of his reasoning for making so many changes. ""I have to manage the squad. I am convinced that if it works we will be successful and we need the help of all the players. ""It worked today because we won and the opponent created very little. We had problems in attack and we will evaluate and analyse them. ""The players aren't machines. They need to be precise, fresh, be able to find solutions and it is also difficult against a team that sits back in its own box."" Samper became the latest academy product to be handed his debut in Enrique's short time in charge, following in the footsteps of Munir El Haddadi and Sandro Ramirez. And Enrique praised the 19-year-old's performance, as well as German goalkeeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen who was also making his debut after a 12 million euro transfer from Borussia Monchengladbach in the summer and made a crucial save to prevent Gustavo Manduca snatching a point for the visitors in stoppage time. ""To debut in the Camp Nou in the Champions League is never easy. Samper has a lot of quality and I think he played well. ""Ter Stegen didn't have much to do, but he was there when we needed him and he did his job. ""I don't have a goalkeeper for each competition. We have three very good goalkeepers and they will play depending on what the team needs."""
1479,17/09/2014,22:58,Pique goal sees Barca sneak past APOEL,"A goal by Gerard Pique gave Barcelona a winning start to their Champions League campaign, but they were far from convincing 1-0 victors at home to Cypriots APOEL Nicosia on Wednesday.","Pique headed home the only goal of the game from Lionel Messi's free-kick midway through the first-half, but APOEL managed to subdue a much changed Barca side despite the presence of Messi and Neymar up front. And Luis Enrique's men had debutant Marc-Andre ter Stegen to thank for a fourth consecutive victory to start the season as the German 'keeper made a flying save in stoppage time to deny Gustavo Manduca. Barca do though go to the top of Group F as Ajax held French champions PSG 1-1 in Amsterdam with Barca set to travel to Paris on matchday two. ""We struggled. We tried to move the ball quickly and we didn't manage to do it,"" Barca midfielder Xavi Hernandez told Canal Plus. ""It is true we dominated. We tried through the middle and wide, but they defended very well. ""In the end it was a tiring game, but we have won and we have to treat it like it is. It is always good to start the group stage with three points,"" added Xavi, who equalled compatriot Raul's all-time record of Champions League appearances with 142. Enrique made nine changes from the side that started Saturday's 2-0 win over Athletic Bilbao with Messi and Munir El Haddadi the only players to retain their place. Sergi Samper became the latest youngster to make his debut in the early stages of Enrique's reign, whilst Neymar was handed his first start of the season after coming off the bench to score both his side's goals at the weekend. The number of changes appeared to affect Barca's rhythm in the first-half as they dominated without creating many clear-cut chances from open play. Messi was first to threaten with a curling free-kick that Urko Pardo in the APOEL goal did well to turn to safety. Barca then went in front from another Messi free-kick as this time the Argentine's in-swinging delivery was headed home at the near post by Pique. Messi and Neymar were continuing to link-up well after the former provided the Brazilian with two assists at the weekend and the roles were reversed five minutes before the break as Messi fired Neymar's cutback towards goal and Pardo made another impressive save. A similar pattern ensued after the break, but the visitors also provided more of a threat and wasted two half chances as Tomas De Vincenti saw a goalbound effort deflected wide by Marc Bartra before Mario Sergio's cross was cut out by Dani Alves with two unmarked teammates waiting for a better delivery. Barca should have put the game to bed when Alves picked out Neymar at the back post, but his header was heading off target before Munir turned the ball home and was rightly flagged for offside. Neymar and Messi were foiled again as the game entered stoppage time, Neymar's deflected shot was well saved by Pardo and Messi's follow up brilliantly blocked by Sergio. And the hosts could have been made to pay for a lacklustre display when Ter-Stegen was forced into the first serious save of his Barca career when he tipped Manduca's well-struck effort behind for a corner."

""His buyout clause will be 30 million euros ($38.9 million, £23.9 million) which could rise to 40 million euros."" The Spanish under-21 international made 27 appearances in all competitions last season, but has played just 12 minutes so far this campaign under new boss Luis Enrique."
1481,16/09/2014,15:03,Sky's the limit for in-form Barca,Barcelona boss Luis Enrique is relishing his Champions League debut as a coach when his side host Cypriot champions APOEL Nicosia at the Camp Nou on Wednesday.,"The Catalans run of six consecutive Champions League semi-finals was ended by a quarter-final exit to Atletico Madrid last season, but after starting his reign with three consecutive wins in La Liga, Enrique refused to make any minimum requirement of his star-studded squad for this campaign. ""The first game is special because it is an attractive competition. I think the team is approaching the game in good shape and is in good form,"" he said on Tuesday. ""We are just at the start of the season with many things to improve, but in general I think we are in a good moment. To make minimum requirements with this team and the trajectory of the club makes no sense. Our first objective is to win the first game."" Barca are expected to cruise through Group F along with French champions Paris Saint-Germain given the wealth of their resources compared to APOEL and four-time European champions Ajax. However, Enrique warned against complacency and is keen to make a flying start with PSG expected to challenge for first place in the group. ""This marvellous sport is full of games in which the in theory inferior side beats the favourite,"" he added. ""If we play with intensity we will be much closer to victory, if not then we could struggle. This match is very important if we want to be first in the group, albeit against a less attractive opponent. ""Three points count as much in this match as say they would against Paris Saint-Germain."""
1482,16/09/2014,14:19,Pique claims Catalans have right to independence vote,Barcelona and Spain defender Gerard Pique has thrown his support behind calls for Catalonia to be allowed to hold a vote on independence from Spain.,"Pique posted pictures to his social media accounts last week of him attending a mass demonstration with his son calling for the Spanish government to allow a referendum similar to that which will take place in Scotland on Thursday. Speaking ahead of Barca's Champions League opener against APOEL Nicosia on Wednesday, Pique claimed his efforts in representing Spain at international level could not be questioned despite his call for a ""democratic"" solution. ""I don't understand why people are bothered by it, my playing for Spain doesn't have anything to do with it,"" he said. ""I don't think there can be any doubts about me. I have played with the Spanish national teams since I was 16, I have played over 11 years without fail. I have always given my all in every game. ""It is different thing that I also feel Catalan, it was the day of the Catalans and to be in favour of the vote. ""That is something democratic and the people ought to have the right to vote."" Pique has 61 caps for Spain and was part of the sides that won the World Cup in 2010 and European Championships in 2012. Barcelona marked the 300th anniversary of the loss of Catalan sovereignty to Spain during Saturday's 2-0 win over Athletic Bilbao by wearing the club's red and gold away strip, the same colours as the Catalan flag, for the first time in a home game."
1483,16/09/2014,02:07,APOEL next in Messi-inspired Barca's firing line,Barcelona begin their Champions League campaign at home to Cypriot champions APOEL Nicosia on Wednesday in fine form having romped to the top of La Liga with three consecutive wins to give Luis Enrique a dream start to his reign.,"The most promising development of all three wins has been the return of four-time World Player of the Year Lionel Messi to something approaching his best form after a disappointing end to a first trophyless campaign in six years last season. Messi has scored twice and provided three assists so far this season, including the decisive pass for both Neymar's goals in a 2-0 win over Athletic Bilbao on Saturday. Enrique described the Argentine as being capable of things he had never seen even on the PlayStation after his latest recital, whilst Neymar also hailed his teammate as the best in the world. Those were the first two assists that Messi had provided for Neymar since the Brazilian's move from Santos last year and pointed to a greater understanding between the pair who both suffered injury disrupted campaigns last season. The Brazilian is likely to be handed his first start of the season for the visit of APOEL with three points a must for Barca given the potent threat of Paris Saint-Germain in temrs of who tops the group. Pedro Rodriguez is expected to keep his place in the side despite the rapid rise of 18-year-old wonderkid Munir El Haddadi and the Spanish international is determined to make amends for the Catalans quarter-final defeat to Atletico Madrid in last year's competition. ""Every year we fight to get to the end of the competition. Last season it was a shame to go out against Atletico, but we have a lot of desire and ambition to win this title. It is very difficult, especially in the knockout phase,"" he said on Monday. ""We know it is a great competition and we will need a team that is physically strong and defends well. I am sure it will be a difficult game."" With Enrique's men facing a heavy schedule of six games in 18 days, he is likely to rotate his squad as he often did during his solitary year in charge at Celta Vigo. That is likely to mean a first start of the season for veteran Xavi Hernandez in midfield, whilst the likes of Gerard Pique, Rafinha Alcantara and Dani Alves should also come back into the starting line-up after being dropped at the weekend."
1484,14/09/2014,02:05,"Who needs PlayStation when you have Messi, says Enrique",Barcelona coach Luis Enrique hailed four-time World Player of the Year Lionel Messi as capable of things impossible even on computer game PlayStation after he set up Neymar twice in his side's 2-0 win over Athletic Bilbao on Saturday.,"Messi has looked back to his best after a disappointing end to last season, scoring twice and providing three assists as Barca have propelled themselves to the top of La Liga with three wins from their opening three games. ""It is evident that he is best in the world in any attacking aspect,"" he said. ""This version of Messi helps us a lot because he is a game changer. He does things in training that you can't imagine, things I haven't even seen on the PlayStation. ""We are used to it now but it is a joy and a privilege to have the best player in the world in your team without a doubt."" And despite netting his first two goals of the season, Neymar was also quick to praise the part played by Messi in both goals. ""Messi is the best in the world. He is a star and I am improving with him,"" the Brazilian told Canal Plus. ""I am very happy with the game today. It went perfectly with the two goals."" Neymar had been left out of the starting line-up after his exertions in captaining his country for the first time in wins over Colombia and Ecuador in the past week, but made the difference in a tight contest when he slotted home from Messi's through ball 11 minutes from time. And the two combined once more five minutes later as this time Messi breezed past three Athletic defenders before cutting the ball back for Neymar to side-foot home. It is not just going forward that the Catalans have impressed at the start of Enrique's reign as they have also started the league season with three consecutive clean sheets for the first time in 20 years. ""I think against a team like Athletic it highlighted how little we restricted them to,"" added Enrique. ""That means that we have pressed high and defended well. To do that you have to be solid and know what you are doing. ""It seems that we aren't quite being clinical enough, but we have players like Neymar and Sandro who have come off the bench fresh in the last two games and have the ability to score goals."""

""Messi is the best in the world. He is a star and I am improving with him,"" Neymar told Canal Plus. ""I am very happy with the game today. It went perfectly with the two goals. ""We knew we would suffer a little bit, but we managed to remain tight at the back and then went onto win the game."" Enrique was also quick to laud the impact made by Messi in creating both goals, as he also did for Sandro's winner at Villarreal two weeks ago. ""It is evident that he is best in the world in any attacking aspect,"" he said. ""This version of Messi helps us a lot because he is a game changer. He does things in training that you can't imagine, things I haven't even seen on the Playstation."" Fresh from making his debut with Spain in a 5-1 thrashing of Macedonia on Monday, 19-year-old Munir El Haddadi once again started ahead of Neymar and was a constant threat despite not having his best day in front of goal. Munir's first opening of the day came 20 minutes in when he collected Messi's pass and turned Oscar de Marcos with ease, but then fired wastefully over with just Gorka Iraizoz to beat. Athletic were coping comfortably with Barca in the final third, though, and threatened themselves when the excellent Ander Iturraspe broke into the box but his shot lacked the power to trouble Claudio Bravo. Barca upped the pressure on the Athletic goal just before half-time as Iraizoz did well to parry Ivan Rakitic's fierce low drive before spreading himself to block from Munir at point-blank range as the youngster latched onto another Messi assist. Munir thought he had broken the deadlock at the start of the second period as he swept home from close range, but was this time denied by the offside flag as he failed to time his run. Iraizoz was on top form once more to turn Jordi Alba's low drive behind and hold a powerful header from Munir, but Neymar's entrance just after the hour mark gave Barca the extra touch of class they needed to punish the Basques. Aymeric Laporte's wayward pass was picked off by Sergio Busquets and he fed Messi before the Argentine freed Neymar in behind the Athletic defence to roll home his first goal of the season. Messi played the role of provider once more six minutes from the end as he floated down the right wing and pulled the ball back for the unmarked Neymar to slot home. Both sides' attentions will now turn to Champions League action on Wednesday as Barca host Cypriots APOEL Nicosia and Athletic welcome Shakhtar Donetsk to the new San Mames in their first group stage game in the Champions League for 16 years."

He has trained both on his own and with the group,"" Enrique said on Friday. ""The relationship every player has with his international team is different. What concerns me is his relationship with the club and it has been great so far."" After a series of tired looking performances towards the end of last season and at the World Cup, Messi has looked back to his best as Barca have opened up the new La Liga season with back-to-back victories over Elche and Villarreal. And Enrique could call on Brazilian star Neymar from the start for the first time this season against Athletic after he returned from captaining Brazil for the first time in victories over Colombia and Ecuador without any injury problems. ""He is in the right condition to play, in fact almost everyone is ready and available to be selected. ""Neymar is a special player. He has already been subjected to incredible pressure in his country and in his club career and I hope that from that base he can become one of the best players in the world."" The match at the Camp Nou has also been given an extra political edge as Barca will wear their red and yellow away shirt, designed to symbolise the Catalan flag, to commemorate the region's loss of sovereignty 300 years ago. ""I think it is an interesting idea,"" added Enrique. ""I hope that the Senyera (Catalan flag) gives us strength and that the crowd support us in the more difficult moments."""

Barcelona said it had been given approval by the Spanish Football League. The match against Bilbao, from Spain's Basque region which has also seen separatist tensions, will be held at the Camp Nou stadium. ""The club's board of Directors had requested the change in strip, which features a design based on the Catalan flag, as part of the commemorations to mark the 300th anniversary of the September 11 siege of Barcelona in 1714,"" said a Barcelona statement. The club said it was ""unanimous"" in wanting to use the colours of the Catalan flag known as the Senyera. Barcelona played one game last season in the Senyera colours. Spanish and French forces took Barcelona in 1714 as part of the Spanish War of Succession. Hundreds of thousands of people were expected to take to the streets of Barcelona on Thursday as part of the commemorations. Catalonia's government wants to hold a vote on independence on November 9.

I am very excited to be part of this project. ""For me, when I was in Spain, I always said that if I was to leave one day, I would return to the Premier League."" Born in Douala, Song began his professional career with French club Bastia and joined Arsenal on a permanent basis in 2006 after spending a year at the club on loan. He made 206 appearances for Arsenal in all competitions before joining Barcelona, where he won the league title in 2013. He has won 47 caps for Cameroon and played at the last two World Cups, although he exited the last one under a cloud after being sent off for elbowing Croatia's Mario Mandzukic in the back in their group game. Amid reported interest from other European clubs, Song said that he had been persuaded to move to Upton Park by a conversation with manager Sam Allardyce. ""When I spoke to the manager, he gave me very good advice,"" Song explained. ""I had a very good chat with him and that's why I am coming here. We have to do better than last season. I think the club has very good ambition and I hope we can maybe catch the European positions, because that would be very good for the club."" Song is West Ham's eighth close-season signing after Mauro Zarate, Cheikhou Kouyate, Enner Valencia, Diafra Sakho, Carl Jenkinson, Aaron Cresswell and Diego Poyet, and could make his debut at Hull City after the international break. afp"

Iniesta, though, has been sidelined by a knee injury. ""He had a problem in his knee that was getting worse and hasn't allowed him to play,"" said Barca boss Luis Enrique on Saturday. ""Neymar is in the squad because he is ready to play. Winning a place in the team is difficult, but the key for the season is not just to have 11 players, but that we win with everyone."" The performance of 18-year-old Munir El Haddadi on debut against Elche may mean Nemyar will start only from the bench at El Madrigal. Munir's fine week was rounded off by a first call-up to the Spanish under-21 squad on Friday, but Enrique insists he hasn't made any plans to protect his protégé during his rapid rise to prominence. ""We haven't done any special work to protect him. He ought to attack everything at the moment calmly. What he is doing at the moment other players will do throughout the course of the season. ""It is great that all the players gain confidence and have minutes on the pitch. Taking decisions is the most important thing for a coach, but you can't always keep everyone in the team happy."""

Lionel Messi looked back to his best as he scored twice, whilst 18-year-old Munir El Haddadi impressed on his debut as he also registered his first senior goal for the club. Croatian international Ivan Rakitic also made his competitive debut at the Camp Nou and has already taken to playing alongside Messi. ""I don't need to talk about him, we already know he is the best in the world,"" he said on Thursday. ""I thank God that I am able to play in the same team as him. ""I am enjoying the chance to play with the best players in the world. I want to make the most of this opportunity and the good performances motivate me even more. ""The most important thing is that we get better. There have been a lot of changes in all positions, but you will see a continuos improvement."" Despite his star turn last weekend, Munir is likely to drop to the bench as Brazilian star Neymar has returned to training following a sprained ankle which ruled him out against Elche. Gerard Pique also returns from suspension and is expected to replace the banned Mascherano. Madrid were less convincing in seeing off newly promoted Cordoba 2-0 on Monday and have also seen two key members of the side that won the Champions League last season. Angel di Maria has completed his British transfer record transfer to Manchester United, whilst Xabi Alonso is on the verge of a shock move to Bayern Munich. However, World and European Player of the Year Cristiano Ronaldo believes summer signings James Rodriguez and Toni Kroos can fill the void left by Di Maria and Alonso. ""If this Real Madrid is better or worse than last year we will see at the end of the season,"" the Portuguese captain told Madrid sports daily Marca. ""You can buy the 40 best players in the world and it doesn't necessarily make you a great team. ""I am not saying that the players Real Madrid have bought aren't top players. They are great players and are going to help Real Madrid, but the overall result comes at the end of the season. ""We will see if we win more or less than last season, but I am convinced that things will go well for them individually and for us at a collective level."" Madrid boss Carlo Ancelotti blamed tiredness for his side's below par display against Cordoba after two draining Spanish Super Cup ties against Atletico Madrid, but Real will have the advantage of a free midweek before travelling to San Sebastian to face Sociedad. The hosts, meanwhile, will have just returned from an arduous journey to Russia as they faced FK Krasnodar in the Europa League on Thursday. Champions Atletico also paid for their exertions in the Super Cup as they were held in the opening game of their La Liga defence in a drab 0-0 draw at local rivals Rayo Vallecano on Monday. However, they will be heavy favourites to secure their first win of the campaign when they host tiny Basque club Eibar, who beat Sociedad last weekend to celebrate their first ever match in the Spanish top flight in style.

""It is clear that Messi is the best player in the world. He has a unique quality that it is easy to see. Giving assists, scoring goals, pressing, defending, he does everything."" Messi opened the scoring three minutes before half-time with a trademark left-footed finish, but the hosts briefly looked in trouble when Jaiver Mascherano was sent-off for denying a clear goalscoring opportunity moments later. However, any Barca nerves were settled just a minute into the second-half as Munir El Haddadi doubled their advantage on his senior debut and Messi classily rolled home his second of the game just after the hour mark to round off the scoring. ""If he wanted Messi could be the best defender in the world. We see him do even more difficult things in training against high quality opponents in his teammates,"" Enrique added. ""He has a magic wand and he will continue being the best in the world as long as he wants."" Big money summer signings Claudio Bravo, Jeremy Mathieu and Ivan Rakitic were also making their Barca debuts, but it was their latest wonderkid from the La Masia academy Munir who stole the show. ""I am very happy to have made my debut and that the team won the game,"" he said. ""It is an honour for me to score here at the Camp Nou with these players like Messi and score a goal."" The 18-year-old owed his chance to the absence of the injured Neymar and suspended Luis Suarez and showed he could be an important player this season as he smacked an effort of the bar in the first-half before sealing a fine individual display with a lofted finish from Rakitic's through ball. ""I had no fear about playing him,"" said Enrique. ""He trains like he plays and gives us a lot of options. He shows great personality and he never rests.

""I said last season I saw them as favourites for the league and the Champions League and they said it was a brave thing to say, but they are the clear favourites. ""Madrid are our eternal rivals and they have strengthened. It will be a very exciting championship. We have the desire having not won anything last season and no one will beat us for desire."" Enrique is still hoping to have Neymar available for the visit of Elche despite the Brazilian striker suffering an ankle sprain in training on Thursday. Pedro Rodriguez has returned to training after suffering from a bout of gastroenteritis and is expected to be fit for selection. Claudio Bravo, Ivan Rakitic and Jeremy Mathieu could make their competitive debuts, but other big money signings Marc-Andre Ter Stegen and Thomas Vermaelen are injured and Luis Suarez remains suspended for biting Italian defender Giorgio Chiellini at the World Cup."

""His return to training will depend on the development of the injury,"" the club said in a statement. The Brazilian had looked to be in fine form Monday when he scored two of Barcelona's goals in their 6-0 destruction of Mexican side Club Leon in a friendly. Neymar's new injury comes just four days after he had received the all-clear to play for the first time since suffering a broken vertebra in his back during the World Cup. The 22-year-old missed out on his country's disastrous 7-1 semi-final defeat to Germany on home soil after suffering the injury when he was clattered by Juan Camilo Zuniga towards the end of Brazil's 2-1 quarter-final win over Colombia. However, the injury could have been much worse as Neymar revealed that had the impact of Zuniga's knee on his back been slightly higher he could have been left paralysed.

1499,22/08/2014,01:45,Revitalised Barca aiming for a flying start,Barcelona will be looking to put a disastrous end to last season behind them when they open their new La Liga campaign at home to Elche on Sunday.,"Former Barca captain Luis Enrique will take charge of his first competitive game after replacing Gerardo Martino in the dugout, but many of the new faces in the playing staff are unlikely to feature. Marc-Andre ter Stegen and Thomas Vermaelen are both sidelined by injury, while Luis Suarez continues his four-month ban for biting Italian defender Giorgio Chiellini during the World Cup. Claudio Bravo and Ivan Rakitic are expected to make their competitive debuts, however, while Lionel Messi and Neymar will feature after both scored on their return from World Cup duty in Barca's 6-0 thrashing of Mexican side Club Leon on Monday. Barca also lost the experience of goalkeeper Victor Valdes and Carles Puyol over the close season, but another veteran, right-back Dani Alves, believes he can see similarities in Luis Enrique's early days in charge to those of Pep Guardiola which reaped such success. ""It is a pleasure to work with someone like Luis Enrique, he demands a lot from us and in the end that is what makes us excited,"" Alves said on Thursday. ""We are working well and demanding a lot of ourselves. The target this year is a marvellous one. ""I think the teams that want to keep winning titles always have to be in evolution. We have the principal thing, which is clear ideas that are accepted by everyone. All that we need to do now is execute them."" Elche provided a major stumbling block between Barcelona and the Liga title last season as they held Martino's men 0-0 at their own Martinez Valero Stadium in the penultimate game of the campaign. And defender David Lomban believes his side can take heart from that result to the Camp Nou. ""There is never a good time to face Barcelona, but it also wasn't a good time towards the end of last season and we managed to get a draw,"" he said. Champions League finalists Atletico Madrid and Real Madrid don't get their league campaigns underway until Monday night as they face off in the second leg of the Spanish Super Cup on Friday. La Liga champions Atletico have a tricky start as they travel across Madrid to take on a Rayo Vallecano side that produced a stunning late run last season to secure their survival in the top flight for another year. Real, meanwhile, will also be looking to make amends as they crumbled in the final weeks of the league season in May before going on to claim a tenth European Cup by beating Atletico in Lisbon. They begin their league campaign at home to newly-promoted Cordoba. There will be an early indication of Sevilla and Valencia's chances of competing for Champions League football when the two most improved squads outside the big three face off at the Sanchez Pizjuan on Saturday. Europa League winners Sevilla have compensated for the loss of captain Rakitic with the arrivals of Gerard Deulofeu on loan from Barca, Argentine international Ever Banega and Iago Aspas from Liverpool amongst others. Meanwhile, Valencia's immediate financial troubles have been eased as Singaporean entrepreneur Peter Lim has taken charge and revitalised the squad. German World Cup-winner Shkodran Mustafi has replaced Barcelona-bound Jeremy Mathieu at the heart of the defence, Manchester City's newest midfield signing Bruno Zuculini has joined on loan for a year and prolific Spanish under-21 international Rodrigo has bolstered new coach Nuno Espirito Santo's attacking options.

1500,21/08/2014,02:10,"Barca need Messi, Neymar, Suarez","After a year of political turmoil in the board and court rooms and disappointment on the pitch, Barcelona have not taken a first trophyless season in six years lying down.","Facing two transfer window signing bans, a summer of revolution in the Catalan capital saw former captain Luis Enrique installed as coach and over 150 million euros ($200 million) invested in the squad. However, doubts remain over how wisely that money has been spent and whether Barca have truly addressed their weaknesses from last season. The headline purchase has been the 81 million euro capture of Luis Suarez from Liverpool. The Uruguayan won't even be able to play a minute of competitive action until late October, though, as he serves a four-month play ban for biting Italian defender Giorgio Chiellini at the World Cup. Moreover, whilst a trio of Suarez, four-time World Player of the Year Lionel Messi and Brazilian superstar Neymar is beyond the budgets of even the majority of fantasy football managers, it remains to be seen how the three dovetail. All are coming off bitter disappointment at the World Cup in their own way. Suarez's tournament ended in disgrace, Neymar's in a very nearly crippling back injury and, despite being named player of the tournament, Messi failed to secure his place as one of the best of all time as his Argentina side lost out to Germany in the final. Yet, it is a triumvirate Barca need to work if they are to have any chance of challenging European champions Real Madrid and La Liga title holders Atletico Madrid over the course of the season with more major concerns in other areas of the pitch. Veterans Victor Valdes and Carles Puyol ended their playing days with the club at the end of last season, signifying the breakup of the side coached by Pep Guardiola that dominated Europe in his first few years in charge. Chile captain Claudio Bravo and 22-year-old Marc-Andre Ter Stegen will battle it out to be Enrique's number one 'keeper after being signed for 12 million euros each with Bravo set to start the campaign after the German picked up a back injury. Of even more concern has been the recruitment of two new centre-backs in 30-year-old Jeremy Mathieu from Valencia and Arsenal captain Thomas Vermaelen for nearly 40 million euros. Mathieu has spent most of his career at left-back before moving to a central position last season, whilst Vermaelen had lost his place in the Arsenal side over the last two years. Both signings, though, give Barca some much needed depth at the heart of the defence and should allow Javier Mascherano to return to his favoured position in midfield, where he shone at the World Cup. Mascherano's own future has been secured by a new contract that will run until 2018 and his aggression is what Enrique hopes to return to a midfield that has become lethargic in recent seasons. ""I am very happy with the desire and ambition with which the players are training. That makes me optimistic,"" Enrique said of his preparation for the new season. ""We need to press in an organised and concrete manner. Obviously it is important to have the ball, but so is to recover it as quickly as possible."" Enrique has already had coaching success at Barca as he succeeded Guardiola as Barca B coach and led them into the second tier of Spanish football in 2010. However, his coaching style is a little more pragmatic than his former teammate. Gerardo Martino was criticised throughout his sole season in charge for not being loyal to the Barca style of play. But with the figurehead of ""tiki-taka"" Xavi Hernandez also likely to play a much reduced role this season, Enrique will continue a trend towards moving the ball quicker into the final third. A style and season that will succeed or fail by how their star attacking trio click."
1501,20/08/2014,13:01,FIFA upholds Barcelona transfer ban,Barcelona will not be able to sign any new players until January 2016 after world football's governing body FIFA rejected an appeal over a transfer ban imposed for breaching rules on underage players.,"The Catalan giants will be banned from the national and international market for two consecutive transfer windows, starting in January 2015, FIFA said. Barcelona immediately announced they would appeal to sports' highest court, describing the decision as an ""affront"" to its youth training academy. ""FC Barcelona announces that it shall continue defending its interests before the highest sporting authority, in this case the Court of Arbitration for Sport"", the club said in a statement. FIFA slapped on the sanction in April, after ruling that Barcelona and the Spanish Football Association had failed to respect regulations governing the international transfer of players under the age of 18 to the club, and their participation in national competitions. But the fact that Barcelona filed an appeal put the punishment on ice, allowing to club to snap up a string of names over the summer transfer period. They include Uruguay international Luis Suarez, bought from English powerhouses Liverpool, though he is not eligible to play until October 25 because he is serving a ban for biting an opponent during the World Cup in June. FIFA's April decision came after a probe conducted the previous year by FIFA Transfer Matching System -- its market watchdog, which was set up in 2007. The investigation concerned several youths who were registered and participated in competitions with Barcelona over various periods between 2009 and 2013. The rules of global football set 18 as the minimum age for international transfers of players, and while there are limited exceptions, they are only allowed if a special FIFA committee gives a green light. The aim, FIFA says, is to protect minors, given that young footballers can be particularly vulnerable to exploitation and abuse in a foreign country without the proper controls. Barcelona were ruled to have breached the rules in the case of 10 players, and to have committed several other infringements in the context of others. FIFA did not identify the players by name. In its decision on Wednesday, FIFA also upheld Barcelona's 450,000-Swiss-franc fine (371,570 euros, $495,760), and gave the club 90 days to ""regularise the situation"" of all the minor players concerned. It also left in place the 500,000-Swiss-franc penalty imposed on the Spanish FA and gave it one year to shake up its regulatory framework and existing system concerning the international transfer of minors in football."

""The suspension is what it is and I have to accept it, it is a personal matter but I have worked with the adequate professionals,"" the Uruguayan said at his first press conference as a Barca player on Tuesday. ""I have tried to forget this game and this situation as well. It is a difficult moment for me and I would say to all the fans to not worry because I am not doing that anymore."" Suarez was believed to have been a long-term target for Barca's eternal rivals Real Madrid. However, Barca's sporting vice-president Jordi Mestre said the player's desire to come to Catalonia had allowed the club to negotiate a fee of 81 million euros (£65 million, $109 million) with Liverpool, £10 million less than the player's £75 million release clause. ""There were options from other teams, but when the option of Barca became clear I didn't have any doubts because it was a dream for me,"" added Suarez. ""I still can't believe it. It is something I have dreamed about but I never imagined such a beautiful dream would come true."" Suarez could even make his competitive debut against Madrid should their first clash of the season be scheduled for Saturday, October 25 or the following day and he is determined to ensure he is as fit as possible when that game comes around in case coach Luis Enrique calls on him to start. ""It's not the same but I had a similar situation last year at Liverpool, I started to play on September 20. It is a long time but if you keep focused with your teammates in training it helps."" Barcelona already have a wealth of talent available in attacking areas with four-time World Player of the Year Lionel Messi and Brazilian star Neymar, meaning Suarez is likely to be forced into a role on the right side of the attack. However, he insisted that won't phase him as he dovetailed with Daniel Sturridge last year to form a deadly partnership that nearly delivered Liverpool's first Premier League title in 24 years. ""I am prepared to play any position in attack. This last year I played on the left and on the right because Sturridge played as the number nine. I don't have any problem playing in any position and adapting myself to what the coach demands. ""The quality that Leo and Ney have is amazing, they are players you admire. Yesterday I was watching them in the first half and they make you want to stop and applaud."""

""With 95 million euros we have signed nine players, Real Madrid have signed two players for 95 million. That is the difference."" The other major difference is that success has also brought Atletico the struggle of holding onto their best players. Top scorer Diego Costa and Filipe Luis have joined Thibaut Courtois in returning to his parent club Chelsea after a three-year loan spell in the Spanish capital. That money has been reinvested in a promising attacking trio of Antoine Griezmann, Mario Mandzukic and Raul Jimenez, but the major coup of the close season for Atletico has been holding onto the likes of Koke, Diego Godin and Miranda despite interest from Barca and Bayern Munich. By contrast, Real have splashed over 100 million euros on the squad that won both the Champions League and Copa del Rey last season without having to sanction any significant sales, although Angel di Maria could exit before the end of the transfer window. An already oversubscribed midfield has been bolstered by World Cup winner Toni Kroos and the competition's top goalscorer James Rodriguez, whilst Costa Rican goalkeeper Keylor Navas will rival Iker Casillas to be number one. ""I think we have a better team than last season because we have signed three players that add quality to the team,"" Real coach Carlo Ancelotti said on Monday. Of the three title contenders, though, it is Barcelona who have undergone the most significant change as they look to bounce back from a first trophyless season in six years. The first change at the Camp Nou over the summer was the coach as they turned to former captain Luis Enrique to replace Gerardo Martino in the hope he can have the same impact as his former teammate Pep Guardiola did in charge. With a two transfer window ban only temporarily suspended, Barca have also been very active in the market with the capture of controversial Uruguayan striker Luis Suarez leading their 150 million euro outlay. Suarez won't even be able to play until late October after his appeal against a four-month ban for biting Giorgio Chiellini at the World Cup was rejected by the Court of Arbitration for Sport last week. However, he could return for a mouth-watering first El Clasico clash between Real and Barca at the Santiago Bernabeu should the game be scheduled for Sunday, October 26. Enrique's main task will be finding a blend for all of Suarez, Lionel Messi and Neymar to function together as all three look to shake off a disappointing end to their respective World Cups. For all their attacking talent, questions also remain over Barca's defence despite the expensive recruitment of Jeremy Mathieu from Valencia and Arsenal captain Thomas Vermaelen. Goalkeepers Claudio Bravo and Marc-Andre Ter Stegen will also battle to succeed the departed Victor Valdes as number one after being signed for 12 million euros apiece. Outside of the big three, Europa League winners Sevilla have made the most significant moves in a bid to get back into the Champions League as they have brought in Barca loanee Gerard Deulofeu, Argentine international Ever Banega and Liverpool reject Iago Aspas. Valencia should also be back in contention for the top four after Singaporean businessman Peter Lim finally completed his takeover of the club with Spanish under-21 international striker Rodrigo their big name signing of the summer. Meanwhile, Basque duo Athletic Bilbao and Real Sociedad retain ambitions of Champions League football despite losing Ander Herrera and Griezmann to Manchester United and Atletico respectively."

""I would like him to be able to play for a few minutes tomorrow,"" Enrique told a news conference after Sunday's training. ""Not many, because he has not played for some time, but he has worked very well when training on his own.""

On Thursday, the Court of Arbitration for Sport relaxed his ban, allowing him to train and play in unofficial matches, but upheld his four-month exclusion from competitive games and his nine-match international suspension. Suarez will be available to play in competitive matches from Saturday, October 25, meaning his official debut could come in the first Clasico of the Spanish league campaign against Real Madrid. Enrique, a former Barcelona player who replaced Gerard Martino after he stepped down at the end of last season following a trophyless campaign, insisted on Sunday Suarez's absence at the start of the season ""does not harm us at all"". ""The squad is solid and strong enough to face the first matches of the league."" Suarez bit Chiellini on June 24 in a 1-0 win over Italy. It was the third time in his career he had been found guilty of biting an opponent.

1513,14/08/2014,16:18,"Suarez suspension upheld, training ban lifted","Luis Suarez on Thursday failed to win a reprieve from his four-month ban for biting Italy's Giorgio Chiellini at the World Cup, but got a green light to resume training.","In a hotly-awaited ruling, the Court of Arbitration for Sport said it had found Suarez guilty of assault during Uruguay's World Cup match against Italy, in what was one of the highest-profile incidents at the sporting extravaganza in Brazil. The decision means that the 27-year-old striker remains unable to make his debut for his new club Barcelona until October 25, but can at least train with his team-mates and be involved in promotional activities. He is also barred from taking to the pitch with Uruguay for nine consecutive official matches. ""The CAS Panel found that the sanctions imposed on the player were generally proportionate to the offence committed,"" the court said in a statement. ""It has however considered that the stadium ban and the ban from 'any football-related activity' were excessive given that such measures are not appropriate to sanction the offence committed by the player and would still have an impact on his activity after the end of the suspension."" Suarez, accompanied by his lawyers and representatives of Barcelona and the Uruguayan Football Association, had last Friday pleaded his case in person at a closed-door session of the Swiss-based CAS, which is the final court of appeal in the sports world. Its three expert arbitrators -- two Swiss and one Italian -- did not issue a detailed ruling because that case was heard under an expedited procedure under the agreement of all concerned. The CAS said that the full findings would follow at a later date. Suarez, who has a record of bans for biting opponents, was barred from all football-related activity for four months after biting Chiellini on the shoulder during Uruguay's final Group C game on June 24 in the Brazilian city of Natal. Uruguay advanced thanks to an 81st minute goal from Diego Godin, sending Italy packing 1-0. Suarez has already served one match of his nine-game national team ban, having missed Uruguay's 2-0 loss to Colombia in the World Cup round of 16 on June 28. In addition to suspending Suarez, world football's governing body FIFA has also fined him fined 100,000 Swiss francs (112,000 dollars), and the CAS kept that penalty in place. FIFA adopted a tough stance at the World Cup because Suarez at first showed no remorse, though its boss Sepp Blatter later dubbed the punishment harsh. But after being sent home from Brazil, Suarez apologised. ""The truth is that my colleague Giorgio Chiellini suffered the physical result of a bite in the collision he suffered with me,"" Suarez said on Twitter on June 30. ""I deeply regret what occurred. I apologize to Giorgio Chiellini and the entire football family,"" he said, vowing that there would never be another incident. Suarez subsequently left English giants Liverpool for Barcelona, after a 95-million-euro ($127 million) deal with the Catalan powerhouses. Suarez and the Uruguayan Football Association turned to the CAS after a failed appeal to FIFA, and were joined by Barcelona in the case. Barcelona have been anxious to tap the striking skills that saw Suarez notch up 31 goals in 33 matches with Liverpool last season. Suarez was backed in his appeal by world players' union FIFPro, which had called the sanctions disproportionate, notably because the ban on all football-related activity infringed his right to work for his club. His lawyers had expressed confidence they would get the ban slashed to two months. That would have made him available to play from August 25, thereby only missing Barcelona's opening fixture of the season, at home to lowly Elche the day before. Suarez has never explained his propensity to bite opponents. He earned a 10-game ban for biting Chelsea's Branislav Ivanovic in 2013, after being sidelined for seven matches with Dutch club Ajax in 2010 for the same offence against PSV Eindhoven's Otman Bakkal.

Now playing for Olympiakos in Greece after spells with Barcelona and Monaco, Abidal told Catalan radio station Rac1 he had been upset at not being selected for the World Cup in Brazil. ""It's over,"" he said late Wednesday. ""I have not held a press conference or said anything. I am saying it for the first time today but I am more than certain that I will no longer join the national team."" Abidal, who played for Barcelona for six years from 2007, was first diagnosed with a liver tumour in March 2011 and a year later underwent a transplant. He won the last of his 67 caps in a World Cup qualifier against Ukraine in November last year but coach Didier Deschamps finally left him out of the World Cup squad for Brazil. ""The coach called me to tell me I was not on the list. It affected me a lot,"" said Abidal. ""I wanted to end with the World Cup and all my fight up to now was for that. I won't say it was for nothing but I wanted to finish well, I wanted to finish with the World Cup and now that door is closed,"" he said.

Suarez, who has two previous lengthy bans for biting opponents, was banned from all football-related activity for four months after biting Chiellini on the shoulder during a World Cup group game in the Brazilian city of Natal in June. He was also suspended for nine internationals and fined 100,000 Swiss francs (112,000 dollars). FIFA had ordered the punishment because Suarez at first showed no remorse, but he later made a full apology to Chiellini. He subsequently left Liverpool for Barcelona in a 95-million-euro ($127 million) deal but as it stands will have to wait until late October before he can play for his new club. However, Suarez has been backed in his appeal bid by world players' union FIFPro and his lawyers said last week they were confident of obtaining a reduction of the ban to two months, meaning the striker would be available to play from August 25, and for him to be allowed to train with Barcelona for the duration of his suspension.

Scudamore said the Premier League would be more peaceful without Suarez, whose ban was his third for biting. ""I think probably the time had come,"" said Scudamore talking at the launch of the Premier League season, which starts on Saturday. ""He's a great player and I'm not taking anything away from his talents: he was voted by both his own players and the media last year the player of the year and deservedly so. ""He's great to have but an accident waiting to happen, and if you spend your time trying to promote what's good about the Premier League, you're always waiting for the next thing to come along. ""And this one in the summer, although it was with Uruguay, although it didn't directly involve the Premier League, clearly it reflected on Liverpool as one of our great clubs and it reflected on us,"" he added. ""He's done his time here, but I can't say I'm sorry to see him go. ""I think it was good business on a number of levels from Liverpool to move Suarez on,"" said Scudamore. Suarez has appealed against his FIFA ban to the Swiss-based Court of Arbitration for Sport and will learn their decision on Thursday.

Vermaelen, who had been at Arsenal for five years, and captain for the past two seasons, said during his presentation at the Nou Camp on Sunday that he wanted to draw a line under an injury-plagued spell. ""I want to put the injuries I have had behind me and look to the future. My aim is to play in lots of games and help the team,"" he said. ""Last year was tough, but I want to start from zero and I am sure I'll have a fantastic season here at Barcelona."" Vermaelen made only 21 appearances last season as niggling injuries and the form of Laurent Koscielny and Per Mertesacker limited his impact.

Vermaelen, who has 47 caps for Belgium, made 150 appearances in all competitions for Arsenal and scored 15 goals. He will compete with Gerard Pique and Jeremy Mathieu for a place in the centre of the Barcelona defence.

United had initially been the front-runners to sign Vermaelen, who was said to be keen to stay in the Premier League and was uncertain if he would start regularly at the Camp Nou. But United manager Louis van Gaal ended his interest when Gunners boss Arsene Wenger, who preferred to sell the former Ajax star to a foreign club rather than a direct rival, asked for England defender Chris Smalling to be included as part of the transfer. Barca coach Enrique then allayed Vermaelen's fears about spending time on the bench and that was enough to seal the deal for the 28-year-old. ""Thomas Vermaelen has agreed to join Barcelona in a permanent transfer for an undisclosed fee,"" a statement on Arsenal's website confirmed. ""Vermaelen passed his medical in Barcelona on Saturday. His transfer is subject to the completion of the normal regulatory process.

He emerged almost five hours later, still refusing to comment on the proceedings. He was ferried off in a black van, but not before stopping to sign autographs for some waiting children. CAS said in a statement that Suarez had given ""a statement to the Panel of CAS arbitrators: Mr Bernhard Welten, Switzerland (President), Professor Luigi Fumagalli, Italy, and Dr Marco Balmelli, Switzerland"". Suarez, who has two previous lengthy bans for biting opponents, was banned from all football-related activity for four months after biting Italy defender Giorgio Chiellini on the shoulder during a World Cup group game in the Brazilian city of Natal.

Suarez received immediate support from FIFPro, the World Footballers' Association, which called the FIFA sanction ""disproportionate"". ""That Luis Suarez has been trialed and vilified in public, ever since the incident, is a sanction in itself,"" FIFPro said in a statement. ""On the other hand, it has been remarkable to see the response from his fellow professionals and the victim himself, Giorgio Chiellini."" FIFPro added: ""Many agree the sanctions are excessive. This is an important signal for the CAS panel to consider. ""The sanctions are a disproportionate response to the offence. Especially the four-month ban from all football-related activity, which is unfair for Suarez as it infringes his right to work at club level. ""In the international arena, where the offence was committed, a nine-match ban for Uruguay is also too strong as it effectively equates to a two-year sanction."" FIFPro also stated that ""the educative nature of the sanction mentioned by FIFA in the ruling can be much better achieved by making it partially conditional, including the obligation for Luis Suarez to receive treatment""."

I think my time there has finished,"" the 34-year-old Barcelona player told a news conference. ""It has been a wonderful, fantastic period for me. It has been an honour,"" said Xavi, who played a decisive role in Spain's triumphs at the World Cup in South Africa in 2010, at Euro 2008 and at Euro 2012. ""We have managed to achieve many successes in the past six or eight years and now I am just another fan of the Spain team,"" he said. Xavi said he would stay with Barcelona, however, after being persuaded to ditch plans to leave the club. The player revealed that he had planned to leave the national side after Spain's Euro 2012 triumph in Ukraine, but coach Vicente del Bosque convinced him to stay. ""He insisted I stay for Brazil and Brazil was disappointing for everyone collectively and for me also individually,"" he said. ""The fact that I did not take part in the decisive game against Chile was a personal disappointment,"" said Xavi of the match that Spain lost 2-0 in Rio de Janeiro in June, ensuring their exit from the World Cup in the group stage. Xavi only played in the first game of Spain's World Cup campaign in Brazil, a humiliating 5-1 loss to the Netherlands, an unfortunate end to his 133rd game for his country. Spain's coaching staff agreed that his time with the national side ""has finished"", he said. Xavi said he had considered leaving Barcelona, too, after a disappointing 2013-14 season in which the club won no major titles. ""I ended the season a bit disappointed. I had two major collective and personal disappointments, perhaps the worst of my career on a personal level,"" he said. ""I found myself on the bench for the last game of the league season, which had not happened to me in recent years in the national team either, and I decided to tell the club that the best thing would be to say that it is over now,"" Xavi said. But Barcelona's new coach Luis Enrique and sporting director Andoni Zubizarreta, ""convinced me I can still be competitive and useful to the club,"" he added. ""I will give everything to carry on being important and useful to Barcelona. I hope people understand my decision. ""I had major personal disappointments and I thought my time with the club was over,"" said the player, who had been the subject of end-of-season Spanish press reports speculating that he could go to the United States or Qatar. ""I don't know what the next season will bring but I have a good feeling,"" Xavi said, noting that he has two years still to go on his Barcelona contract."

""His natural way of doing things, being very spontaneous, being capable of managing a group, being able to adapt himself to the high expectations of a big team with different circumstances. ""I remember that at half-time he used to grab some plastic glasses to show us the tactics and movements he wanted to see. He was a very talented and easy-going person."" Robson died of lung cancer at the age of 76 in July 2009 after a managerial career that included spells with Ipswich Town, England, Porto, Barcelona and Newcastle United. The affable former England player was in charge at Barcelona when Enrique was embarking on his Camp Nou career and the former Spain international has fond memories of the time they spent together. ""It was a year (1996-97) where we won three trophies: one Cup Winners' Cup, one King's Cup, one Spanish Super Cup,"" he said. ""It was a difficult season because it was the year after (Johan) Cruyff had left, and Barcelona decided to sign the services of Robson and his great experience. I think he reached the full expectations. ""I used to appreciate his words of praise, because it was my first year at Barcelona, a very important year for me, and I have to say, I always had a good relationship with him and he always had good things to say about me, and that's always nice."" The FA have marked the anniversary of Robson's passing with the Sir Bobby Robson National Football Day, including a grassroots event beside Ipswich's Portman Road stadium.

It unites people who are interested in football and affected by cancer. It unites them somehow across our region and beyond."""

The judge also asked Neymar's father to hand over contracts and documents relating to his son's signing with Barcelona last year. The judge is looking into allegations that Spanish tax authorities lost out on up to 11.8 million euros ($15.8m) in total related to Neymar's deal with Barcelona. A tax office report cited by the judge listed lost revenues of 2.4 million euros in 2011; 6.8 million euros in 2013 and as much as 2.6 million euros in 2014. The Neymar transfer case was started by one of Barca's own members, Jordi Cases. He accused former Barcelona president Sandro Rosell of misappropriation for not declaring publicly that 40 million of the 57.1 million figure initially quoted by Barca was paid to N&amp;N, a company controlled by the player's parents. Rosell resigned from Barcelona in January. The club then revealed that the entire cost of the operation including Neymar's signing bonus, commissions, marketing deals, a donation to the player's foundation and other agreements totalled 86.2 million euros -- far above the 57 million euros first announced by Barcelona. As a result Barcelona were then indicted for alleged tax fraud linked to the signing. Rosell defended the legality of Neymar's contract during questioning as tax crime suspect in the case at the court last week.

Both Messi and his father denied wrongdoing and pointed the finger instead at a former agent of the player when they were quizzed at a court in Gava, the Barcelona suburb where the player lives, in September 2013. Based on the Messis' testimony, public prosecutors called for the case to be shelved but the court on Monday ruled that Messi ""could have known and consented"" to the tax fraud and the prosecution of the case should go ahead. Messi is the fourth richest sportsperson in the world, according to a ranking published in June by Forbes business magazine. He moved up to fourth from 10th place in just a year with an annual income of just under $65 million, it said. Between 2007 and 2009 he earned more than 10.17 million euros in image rights.

But sporting director Andoni Zubizarreta said: ""Luis Suarez is going to play a positive role in the years he will be at Barcelona."" The Spanish giants ""accept humans with all their imperfections, all their mistakes and their capacity to learn from their errors."" The incident with Chiellini during Uruguay's World Cup group win over Italy was the third case of Suarez biting an opponent. Barcelona paid a reported EUR95 million ($128 million) for Suarez. But he cannot train or play with them until November because of the four month ban imposed by a FIFA disciplinary committee. He was also suspended for nine internationals and fined 100,000 Swiss francs ($112,000). A lawyer for Suarez has said the player will appeal against the biggest punishment imposed at the World Cup to the Court of Arbitration for Sport. Asked if Barcelona wanted to get the ban reduced, Zubizarreta said: ""We are analysing the information provided by FIFA to see how we can defend the player's rights."" He added that club lawyers had recommended that officials be ""extremely prudent"" when discussing the case. Barcelona's new coach Luis Enrique told the press conference he would have prefered to have Suarez ready at the start of the season.

The 27-year-old scored 82 goals in 133 appearances for Liverpool and his remarkable tally of 31 in 33 league matches last season helped the Reds qualify for the Champions League and come close to winning the English title for the first time in 24 years. But his stay at Anfield was marred by a series of controversial incidents, which included suspensions for racially abusing Manchester United's Patrice Evra and biting Chelsea's Branislav Ivanovic. Suarez was in trouble again during the current World Cup, when he bit Italy defender Giorgio Chiellini, earning a nine-match international suspension and a four-month ban from all football activities. That latest indiscretion prompted Liverpool's owner John W. Henry to cash in on Suarez, but the fee will be reinvested in strengthening the squad and Rodgers expects to reap the rewards. ""I am confident we will improve the team further and will be stronger for this coming season, when we will be competing on all fronts; domestically and in the greatest club competition in the world, the Champions League,"" Rodgers said. ""We are focused on the future, as we strive to continue with the progress we have made and build on last season's excellent Premier League campaign."" It is not the first time Liverpool have sparked fears about their future by selling a star forward. In 1977 Kevin Keegan quit for Hamburg but he was replaced with tremendous success by Kenny Dalglish, while Ian Rush's move to Juventus in 1987 was off-set by swoops for Peter Beardsley, John Aldridge and John Barnes. In both cases Liverpool went on to win silverware the season after the big-name exits, and Rodgers hopes his rebuilding programme, which has already included the signings of Rickie Lambert, Adam Lallana and Emre Can, will yield similar rewards. ""If there is one thing the history of this great club teaches us, it is that Liverpool FC is bigger than any individual,"" Rodgers said. ""I hope our supporters continue to dream and believe that we are moving forward and with continued improvement and progression, together we will bring the success we all crave and deserve."""

""Further talks and discussions will take place in due course. Nothing is finalised as of now."" Barcelona themselves stoked the speculation regarding a transfer by heaping more praise on Suarez on Wednesday after the Uruguay forward apologised for biting a rival World Cup player but refused to comment on rumours of a possible signing. Despite the furore over the incident, Barcelona were reportedly still ready to sign the player from Liverpool on condition he apologise for biting Italian defender Giorgio Chiellini. Suarez's attack on Chiellini saw him thrown out of the World Cup and given a four-month global ban from all football. It was the third time he had been banned for biting yet he still remains one of world football's hottest properties after leading the Premier League scoring chart last season with 31 goals. Liverpool, who finished runners-up in the Premier League last season behind champions Manchester City, have indicated that if the 27-year-old Suarez is to leave Anfield it will be for a fee of at least £70 million ($121 million, 88million euros). Meanwhile there have been suggestions that Barcelona could offer Chile forward Alexis Sanchez in return to help seal the deal. Suarez's current ban means he could not play for Barcelona until October at the earliest. Nevertheless, following Suarez's Twitter apology to Chiellini, Barcelona president Josep Maria Bartomeu coyly said: ""Luis Suarez is a Liverpool player so I can't speak about Suarez. ""I can talk about what he did. He made a mistake during a match and has apologised. That honours him because it is hard to admit mistakes,"" he added. ""But once you do it, is the first step to change. He is a player who has to recover and keep playing.""

""Suarez has had the character and the humility to acknowledge his mistake. That is important,"" Zubizarreta said. Suarez bit Chiellini on June 24 in Uruguay's 1-0 win over Italy which took the South Americans into the World Cup last 16 before they were knocked out by Colombia 2-0 on Sunday.

""They match my footballing ambitions with their hunger and desire to win trophies,"" he said. ""They have an amazing squad of players and an incredible manager. I am fully committed to this team and I can't wait to start playing."" Fabregas joined Arsenal from Barcelona's youth set-up in 2003 and developed into a star in England after securing a first-team place and he eventually became captain. But the only trophy he won in England was the 2005 FA Cup. Now he returns with London rivals Chelsea under Jose Mourinho after confirming Arsenal had not taken up their option to re-sign him. ""Yes, everyone knows that Arsenal had the first option to sign me. They decided not to take this option and therefore it wasn't meant to be. I wish them well in the future."""

Pique put his hand over his mouth but spoke into the live microphone of public television TVE at a promotional event in Washington DC where Spain were training ahead of a friendly against El Salvador on Saturday. ""He's told me it's done,"" Pique can be heard telling Spain coach Vicente del Bosque moments before the start of a news conference at the event on Wednesday. ""He is going. He told me 33 million,"" Pique said. Del Bosque replied that the departure of Fabregas, 27, would be bad news for the president, an apparent reference to Barcelona boss Josep Maria Bartomeu. ""He can't get a break,"" Del Bosque said. ""You're going to make him crazy, poor guy."" It is unclear if Pique and Del Bosque were truly caught in an offhand moment. Barcelona-based sports daily Mundo Deportivo said the pair's smiles raised suspicions that the remarks were actually a practical joke on the media. Spain face Chile, the Netherlands and Australia in World Cup Group B. Their first match pits them on June 13 against the Netherlands -- their opponents in their 2010 World Cup final triumph."

""It's a fantastic club and there is no better option for me."" Ter Stegen has not made the Germany squad as one of their three goalkeepers for next month's World Cup, but is on stand-by in case Bayern Munich star Manuel Neuer fails to recover from a shoulder injury. However, he is set to be the first-choice for Barcelona, replacing the out-of-contract Victor Valdes, and Ter Stegen is confident the move will help him force a way into Germany coach Joachim Loew's plans on a regular basis. ""There can be nothing better than being allowed to play for Barcelona. A dream has come true,"" added Ter Stegen, who has been known to make the occasional blunder for both club and country. ""Moenchengladbach is my home town, but I wanted to do something new, so this is the right step for me. ""If I put in my best performances, it will be hard for the (Germany) coach to overlook me.

""I think I am capable. I think I can bring positive things to the players and to the club and that is my challenge."" Barcelona narrowly missed out on the league title in a 1-1 draw with Atletico Madrid on May 17. That sealed the Catalan team's first season without a major trophy in six years. ""I hope they put pressure on me every day to compete for titles,"" said Enrique. The club has already announced the signing of a new goalkeeper, 22-year-old German international Marc-Andre Ter Stegen from Borussia Monchengladbach, and the return of Rafinha Alcantara and Gerard Delofeu from spells on loan. Enrique promised more new arrivals to try to make Barca's passing game more unpredictable. ""We will reinforce the squad, in every area if possible,"" he said. The just-ended season saw the departures of injured veteran defender and captain Carles Puyol and two goalkeepers, Victor Valdes and Jose Manuel Pinto. Enrique said others could follow. But Argentine star striker Lionel Messi signed a new contract despite a disappointing season and Enrique said on Wednesday that the goalscorer was ""necessary and indispensible"". ""Messi's performance this season has not been as incredible as it was in some previous ones,"" Enrique said, but added that he aimed to help him ""find his best form"". He also praised Messi's countryman and midfield teammate Javier Mascherano, hinting that he could make a good captain to replace Puyol. He would not be drawn however on the future of another star of Barca's recent years, Spain midfielder Xavi Hernandez.

Now Barca's board is betting on him bringing the 2012-2013 title holders back to glory after they ended this season without a major trophy for the first time in six years, forcing Martino to quit after just one season in charge. As part of the overhaul, Barcelona also confirmed on Monday that 22-year-old German international Marc-Andre Ter Stegen will join them from Borussia Monchengladbach next season, replacing Spain's Victor Valdes as first-choice goalkeeper. Enrique will sign a two-year deal as new first team coach and be officially presented on Wednesday, the club said in a statement on Monday evening. His pedigree as an old Barcelona hero raised excitement after the disappointment over Martino, who was hired just two weeks before the latest campaign began following the late Tito Vilanova's sudden resignation due to cancer. As a player, Enrique ""soon became a firm favourite with the fans for his competitive attitude. In addition, his versatility, knack of scoring big goals and technical ability made him a key member of the team"", Barcelona said in its statement. In his first three seasons he won two league titles, two Spanish cups, a European Cup Winners Cup and a European Super Cup.

Goalkeeper Jose Manuel Pinto will join Valdes in leaving Barcelona after six-and-a-half seasons with the club, while Stegen ""is one of the first additions at Barca for the 2014/15 season,"" the club said in a statement Monday. ""The board of directors would like to publicly thank the professionalism and dedication shown by Jose Manuel Pinto during his years at the club,"" said sporting director Andoni Zubizarreta after announcing the 38-year-old would not be offered a new contract. Ter Stegen has long been indicated as the man to replace Valdes since the Spanish international announced his intention not to renew his contract 18 months ago. Capped four times by Germany, Ter Stegen has become an undisputed starter in the Monchengladbach goal over the past three seasons making 108 appearances in the Bundesliga in total. His finest moment on the international stage came in saving a penalty from his new Barcelona teammate Lionel Messi in a friendly against Argentina in August 2012. However, he conceded a horror own goal as an experimental German side lost 4-3 to the United States in June last year and hasn't been included in Joachim Loew's provisional 30-man squad for next month's World Cup.

The incident has since dominated media discussion in Brazil, while Neymar's PR firm launched a ""We Are All Monkeys"" social media initiative to slam racism in sport."
1559,30/04/2014,14:49,Football: Banana-throwing fan in Spain faces charges,"Spanish police said Wednesday they have laid criminal charges against a football fan for throwing a banana at Barcelona defender Dani Alves, a slur that has sparked a global storm of anti-racist protest.","The Spanish authorities arrested the young man Tuesday, two days after the ugly incident put racism in Spanish football under a harsh spotlight, unleashing condemnation worldwide including from Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff and FIFA president Sepp Blatter. The suspect, who has been named and pilloried on social media but has not been identified by the authorities, was charged on the same day with an offence against civil rights and liberties before being released, a police spokeswoman said. If found guilty, he could face a sentence of up to three years in prison. The banana landed on the pitch near the 30-year-old Brazilian international as he was about to take a corner during Barcelona's away match against Villareal on Sunday night. Alves won praise for his reaction, picking up the banana to take a bite before getting on with the game and setting up a goal in Barcelona's dramatic come-from-behind 3-2 victory. Villarreal condemned the incident and said they had identified the culprit, withdrawing his club membership and permanently banning him from their ground. ""The player Dani Alves gave a daring and strong response to racism in sports,"" Brazil's leader said in a series of Twitter messages after the match. Blatter also reacted on Twitter, saying: ""What @DaniAlves2 tolerated last night is an outrage. We must fight all forms of discrimination united. Will be zero tolerance at #World Cup."" The FIFA boss spread his anti-racism message Wednesday to the United States after the NBA banned Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling for life for racist comments. ""Sport says no to racism. I fully support @NBA's decision to ban @LAClippers owner for life after his racist words,"" Blatter said. Much of the football world stood behind Alves. Outraged at his teammate's treatment, Neymar posted on Twitter with the hashtag #somostodosmacacos, (we are all monkeys). He then sent a photo showing him eating a banana holding his two-year-old son, who was clutching a banana-shaped soft toy. Chelsea's Brazilian stars Oscar, David Luiz and Willian also posted to social media while Manchester City's Argentinian star Sergio Aguero tweeted a picture of himself and Brazilian five-time world female player of the year Marta both eating a banana. Football's world and European governing bodies FIFA and UEFA have repeatedly tried to campaign against racism and last November, Blatter said he was ""sickened"" to see some Real Betis supporters make monkey chants at their own player, Brazilian defender Paulao, in a city derby against Sevilla. Spain coach Vicente del Bosque said Tuesday he regretted that some people had used football to launch a racist message. ""It is not everyone. I want to think these are isolated incidents. In football there is no racism, not at all,"" Del Bosque said, ruling out any impact on the Spain team from the fallout of the scandal. In an interview with AFP, Alfredo Relano, the editor of major sports daily AS, said many people in Spain did not believe there was any racism because in the past there had been relatively few people of other races in the country. ""As people from elsewhere have been coming in, it has started showing up,"" he said, referring to the banana-throwing slur as ""unacceptable"". ""I think there is racism in Spain and we have to fix it. The strong reaction from outside was very present in England some time ago and they followed it up very seriously. I think we have to follow it up with rigour."""

""The idea was to do something light-hearted, even amusing. We waited for the best moment and that came with what happened with Daniel on Sunday,"" Ketzer said. After Alves picked up the banana thrown by a fan at Villarreal -- since banned for life by his club -- social media sites burst into life as Neymar and even Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff joined in to decry racism. Outraged at his teammate's treatment, Neymar posted on Twitter with the hashtag #somostodosmacacos, (we are all monkeys). He then sent a photo showing him eating a banana holding his two-year-old son, who was clutching a banana-shaped soft toy. With Neymar the 74th most popular contributor to Twitter his tweet was promptly sent round the twittersphere thousands of times within hours. Neymar's response to ""eat a banana"" in response to racism was swiftly picked up by other contributors to social media websites in support of Alves. Alves said his gesture was spontaneous but did say he was aware of Neymar's intention to act against racial insults. ""It had already happened to other team-mates and we had talked about it,"" the defender told Radio Globo. ""We had already talked about a campaign that 'Ney' wanted to do on the issue as it (racism) had already happened to him. ""But my own reaction came spontaneously. Someone threw a banana, it fell in front of me and I picked it up and ate it without thinking of the consequences, simply to counter a negative action by a positive action."" Alves added: ""If you are not offended then the offender hasn't achieved his goal."""

""I plant mangos, coconuts, melons, watermelons, passion fruit -- and now I'm going to plant bananas,"" he told Globo's G1 news portal from his home in the northern state of Bahia. But he added a note of caution, saying he feared one day a racist fan might go as far as trying to poison a player. ""It's dangerous as someone might put something inside (a banana) with a different intention...A person like this could go as far as doing something different and even poison someone."" And he added he would be telling his son ""not to eat any more bananas on the pitch."" Alves' mother Lucia Ribeiro added she was proud of her son's reaction, which she said was ""a slap in the face for prejudice."" Alves himself joked on Twitter that ""my father always told me to eat bananas to avoid getting cramp."" The player's smart response to the latest in a series of racist incidents at Spanish matches rallied fellow athletes, with dozens posting pictures of themselves on social media chomping bananas. Rousseff and FIFA president Sepp Blatter added supportive messages of their own while condemning racism. Joining the flood of Brazilian luminaries posting to social media websites was Selecao centre forward Fred, who posted to his Facebook page a picture of him making an obscene, bent-arm gesture in response to racism -- in Portuguese the gesture translates as ""do a banana."""

Pro-Real Madrid daily Marca published a 12-page supplement on the ""unforgettable"" Vilanova and a rare Barca-related front page with a full-length portrait of him and the headline: ""Goodbye, Tito, your struggle was a lesson to us."" It described the ex-coach -- who made headlines in 2011 when Real's then-manager Jose Mourinho poked him in the eye after a bad-tempered match -- as ""a symbol of valour, courage, hard work, responsibility and simplicity"". Barcelona sports daily El Mundo Deportivo hailed the ""Eternal Tito"" on its front page, praising him in its lead article as ""a strong personality and a coach of great and inexhaustible resources"". ""Today children and grown-ups, friends and rivals, coach and players around the world, Spaniards and Catalans all cry for him,"" it said. The other major Barcelona football daily Sport lamented the young age at which Vilanova succumbed on Friday to a nearly three-year fight with cancer of the salivary gland. ""It is unjust that a person of just 45, a sportsman, full of life and plans, had to leave his loved ones this way,"" Sport said. It described the announcement of his death as ""a stab in the stomach that chilled our blood"". The other major Madrid sports daily AS described Vilanova as ""a footballing great"" and ""an actor in a fundamental part of the history of modern football"". Spain's biggest-selling general newspaper El Pais described Vilanova as ""a natural leader"" and the Barcelona squad he led along with ex-coach Pep Guardiola as ""an unforgettable team"". Several newspapers highlighted Barcelona's best Spanish league performance ever, when Vilanova's men scored 100 points in 2012-2013, winning their 22nd league title in his only season in full charge of the team. Vilanova had wanted to stay on as coach for the current season but was forced to step down for ongoing cancer treatment.

""FC Barcelona is sad to inform that Francesc 'Tito' Vilanova Bayo has passed away today at the age of 45,"" Barcelona said in a statement. ""The death of our former coach came about this afternoon after he could not overcome the illness he had been fighting since 2011. ""The club wishes to express its deep condolences to his family, with whom we share this painful moment along with the club members, fans and the whole world of football and sport."" Vilanova's funeral will take place on Monday, April 28, in Barcelona cathedral at 8:00 p.m. local time (1800GMT). Barcelona said space will be opened at their Camp Nou stadium for those wanting to pay their respects over the next few days. Vilanova leaves behind his wife Montse Chaure-Vilanova and two children. Tributes poured in from around the world of football to the man that played a huge role in one of the most successful eras in Barcelona's history. ""A difficult person to forget. We will always remember him. All my love to Tito's family,"" Barcelona's four-time World Player of the Year Lionel Messi wrote on his official Facebook page alongside a picture of him with Vilanova. ""Tito Vilanova was a wonderful person, and will never be forgotten at FC Barcelona. Thank you for everything you taught us. Rest in peace,"" Barcelona president Josep Maria Bartomeu tweeted. ""Tito Vilanova is one of the best coaches I have had in my career,"" added Barca goalkeeper Victor Valdes on Twitter. Monaco defender Eric Abidal, who underwent a liver transplant whilst playing under Vilanova at Barcelona, wrote on his Twitter account: ""For all that we lived through together I will always remember you friend. Rest in peace. Thank you for the fight. My love and support to your family."" There were also messages of support from Barca's rivals Real Madrid and further afield in the world of sport. ""I want to express my profound sadness for the death of Tito Vilanova and transmit, in the name of Real Madrid, our condolences, support and love to his family, to FC Barcelona and especially to his wife and children,"" Real president Florentino Perez said in a statement. ""Today is a day of enormous sadness for all football fans and recognition for his personal and professional life."" Meanwhile, tennis world number one Rafael Nadal paid his own tribute after suffering a shock loss in the Barcelona Open on Friday. ""To lose is not a drama. What has happened to Tito Vilanova is. We are left with his example and I send my support to his family,"" said the Spaniard. As a player, Vilanova came through the ranks at Barcelona where he became close friends with former Barca boss and current Bayern Munich coach Pep Guardiola before leaving the Catalans to further his career at a lower level, most notably with Celta Vigo and Mallorca. He began his coaching career at tiny Catalan club FC Palafrugell, but after a short stint as sporting director at Terrassa FC, he was called upon by his old friend Guardiola to be part of his coaching staff at Barcelona B in 2007. When Guardiola graduated to first-team coach a year later he was joined by Vilanova and the pair would enjoy phenomenal success as Barca won 14 trophies in four seasons and are widely recognised as one of the greatest teams ever to play the game. However, Vilanova was diagnosed with cancer in November 2011 and had to have tumour removed from his throat before returning to his coaching duties in March the following year. Vilanova then succeeded Guardiola when he stepped down at the end of the 2011/12 season and presided over the best first half of a league season in the club's history. The club was rocked again in December 2012, though, by the news that the cancer had reappeared and Vilanova spent two months in New York receiving chemotherapy treatment before returning to the sidelines towards the end of the season. Having amassed a huge lead in La Liga, Barca comfortably sealed their 22nd Spanish title with a record 100 points tally. Yet, they were not so successful in the Champions League where they were swept aside 7-0 by eventual champions Bayern Munich in the semi-finals. Vilanova expressed his intention to stay in the job at the end of the season, but just two weeks before the start of the current campaign was forced to resign as he had to undergo further treatment."

""Today Messi decided the game again,"" said the Spanish international. ""A lot of the time people demand too much of him. We need to leave him in peace and let him work."" A fourth straight defeat seemed on the cards when Aritz Aduriz put Athletic ahead five minutes into the second-half, but two goals in as many minutes sealed the points for Barca as Pedro Rodriguez tapped home from close range before Messi rifled in a free-kick from the edge of the area. Victory moved Barca into second place, two points ahead of Real Madrid having played a game more, but still four points adrift of leaders Atletico Madrid with four games remaining. Xavi, though, insisted they will fight until the end to try and defend their La Liga title in the hope that both Atletico and Real unexpectantly drop points before Barca host Atletico on the final day of the season. ""We knew how important today's game was, even though we don't have matters in our own hands. It is important to win and wait and see what happens.

""I always had a bit of fear"" that the injury would force me to ""stay out ... of the World Cup,"" Neymar told Globo TV.

""It's horrible to be out, without training, without playing, and to see your comrades playing and training,"" he told Globo. Neymar will be the second-youngest player to wear the number ten shirt for the Selecao at a World Cup. Pele famously made the shirt his own as a 17-year-old at the 1958 finals and again in 1962 before another crown in 1970.

Martino admitted Barca hadn't matched their standards of late as two goals from Lionel Messi and Jordi Figueras own goal was enough to see them past bottom of the table Betis 3-1. ""I expected that the game wouldn't have the same level of play as the other day against Atletico. Tuesday took a lot out of us.

It wasn't due to concentration or underestimating the opponent, Betis played very well. At some points our work rate dropped a bit because we were lacking a bit physically. ""I hope that on Wednesday we will be better than today. I don't want to make excuses, but between Tuesday and next Wednesday appears the Betis game and it is normal that this happens. ""Normally the result isn't so favourable and this time it is, so we value it a lot as it allows us to continue putting pressure on the leaders."" It was a similar story for Atletico as Raul Garcia's early header was enough to squeeze out a third straight 1-0 home league win. ""Today was a difficult game. We played better in the first-half, but we didn't find space in between the lines like we wanted and scored through a set-piece,"" said Simeone. ""In the second-half Villarreal were superior in terms of possession. They didn't have many chances at goal, but we also couldn't create anything on the counter-attack. It is a very important victory that we will value a lot. ""We were tired towards the end and that is normal. The strength and energy that we have had at other times we didn't have today, but the team played with their head and when you play intelligently it can supplement that lack of energy. ""Now we need to think about the game in the Champions League, it is important for the club. It will be a great match. Hopefully we can recover in these four days.""

However, Bartomeu insisted that his message that the vote was more important to the future of the club than his succession of Rosell as president had been successfully received by the members. ""The project is for the club's future over the next 50 years. This is a club proposal, not one tied to this board. That is what we have said all along and I think the members have understood that.""

Part of the funding for the project will come from selling a title right that will see a commercial sponsor's name added to the Camp Nou.

1586,04/04/2014,14:15,Football: Wenger backs Barcelona transfer ban,Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger said on Friday that he supports FIFA's decision to hand Barcelona a year-long transfer ban for breaching rules on signing under-age players.,"The Spanish champions were sanctioned on Wednesday by FIFA's disciplinary committee for breaking regulations in the cases of 10 players aged under 18 who were signed between 2009 and 2013. They were banned from signing players in either of the next two transfer windows and fined 450,000 Swiss francs, (369,000 euros, $509,000), although the club say they will appeal to FIFA and, if necessary, to the Court of Arbitration for Sport. ""Certainly they have not respected the rules,"" said Wenger, who believes the whole system needs reviewing for the good of the game. Under FIFA's rules, a player under the age of 18 can only be transferred if the player's parents have moved country; the move takes place within the European Union if a player is aged between 16 and 18; or the player's home is less than 50 kilometres (31 miles) from the national border being crossed. ""The rule is quite simple, you cannot move the players before the age of 16 unless their parents move for professional reasons, so that of course creates a bit of a debate - do the parents move for professional reasons or not? ""In this case, FIFA has judged the parents moved for football reasons and that is why they were banned because they have not respected the rules."" Wenger added: ""I think the rules need to be changed, because there is more competition now to get the young players, and you will always be in a debate as to why did the parents move? ""There is more money in the game, so the parents will be tempted to give their young boys a chance to have a great career. ""What is not right is that the children move under the age of 16 without their parents. That is absolutely not right. ""Do they have to change the rules so you allow children to move with their parents if the club takes care of the parents? Maybe we have to go that way because it happens."" Arsenal were themselves once criticised by Barcelona for taking on Cesc Fabregas as a youngster after the player had initially been at their academy. Barcelona, who brought Lionel Messi from Argentina when he was just 11, argued that FIFA have ignored the educational benefits enjoyed by players at their world famous La Masia academy. If upheld, the ban would have serious consequences for the Catalans as they would not be able to replace veterans Victor Valdes and Carles Puyol, who have said they will leave the club in June."

On Wednesday the club were hit with a 14-month ban on signing players by FIFA for breaching rules on the signing of players under the age of 18. The news follows the controversial signing of Brazilian star Neymar last year which led to Sandro Rosell resigning as the club's president in January and the club being charged with tax fraud. New president Josep Maria Bartomeu has tried to insist that the importance of the project means it should not be used as a referendum on the current board, despite the fact the refused to call new elections when Rosell resigned. ""It is a project that will last for the next 50 or 60 years, therefore it cannot be something tied to this board,"" he said in an exclusive interview with AFP last month. ""All that we have done is for the club, we have worked at it, done the studies and now we are putting forward an informative and democratic campaign to the members. The important thing for us and everyone else is that the referendum is the club's project, not the board's."" However, there has been opposition to the project by certain section of the Barca support who see it as a move to further commercialise the club's name. Of the proposed 600 million euro budget, 200 million will come from adding a sponsor's name to the historic Camp Nou title. The rest of the funding will be generated by a 200 million euro loan and part of the nearly 500 million euro income that the club already generates annually. The plans include putting a roof on Europe's largest football stadium and increasing its capacity further from 99,000 to 105,000, as well as building a new multi-purpose indoor arena, a new stadium for the Barca B team, office and parking facilities. Should the project get the green light, the club insist that supporters will be able to enjoy a significantly more comfortable matchday experience than is possible in the nearly 60-year-old stadium.

""FC Barcelona will present an appeal to FIFA and if need be will take the case to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS),"" the club said in a statement released on their website. ""The club will also request precautionary measures that will preserve the rights of the club, including the incorporation of players during transfer windows."" The appeal will have to be lodged with FIFA's Appeal Committee within three days and the club could take the case to CAS as a final measure. The ban is a new blow to the image of Europe's most successful club of the 21st Century following alleged tax evasion in its signing of star Brazilian Neymar. However, in a lengthy statement released on their website, the club strictly defended the way in which they coach and educate players under the age of 18 who come to the club. Under FIFA's rules a player under the age of 18 can only be transferred if the player's parents have moved country; the move takes place within the European Union if a player is aged between 16 and 18; or the player's home is less than 50 kilometres (31 miles) from the national border being crossed. And Barcelona argued that FIFA have ignored the educational benefits enjoyed by players at their world famous La Masia academy. ""The La Masia model incorporates training and educational programmes, accommodation, nutrition, medical assistance, attention to the needs of minors and plans for sporting development. ""FC Barcelona forms people before sportsmen, something that has not been considered by FIFA, which has applied a sanction ignoring the educative function of our training programme."" If upheld, the ban would have serious consequences for Barcelona as they would not be able to replace veterans Victor Valdes and Carles Puyol who have said they will leave the club in June. In February last year FIFA banned six of the 10 players in question; Lee Seung-Woo, Paik Seung-Ho and Jang Gyeol-Hee from South Korea, Patrice Sousia of Cameroon, France's Theo Chendri and Bobby Adekanye, a Nigerian-Dutch teenager from competing in competitive games. As well as the transfer ban, which will effectively last 14 months, FIFA fined Barcelona 450,000 Swiss francs, (369,000 euros, $509,000). The Spanish champions were given 90 days to regularise the situation of all 10 minor players concerned.

1589,02/04/2014,17:29,Football: Five problems a transfer ban causes Barcelona,"Spanish giants Barcelona were hit by a one-year transfer ban from football's governing body FIFA on Wednesday for ""serious"" breaches of rules in acquiring under-age players.","Here, AFP sports looks at what problems the Catalans could face should the sanction be upheld. - Can't replace Valdes or Puyol This summer's transfer window was already set to the be the most important in Barca's recent history as captain Carles Puyol and veteran goalkeeper Victor Valdes have indicated their intention to leave the club in June. Twenty-one-year-old German international 'keeper Marc-Andre Ter Stegen was on the verge of completing his move from Borussia Monchengladbach to replace Valdes with another three signings planned to boost the depth of the squad ahead of next season. Barca are already very short of options at centre-back and the inability to find a successor to Puyol will put enormous pressure on the club's vaunted La Masia academy. - Another blow to the club's battered reputation Just a few years ago Barcelona enjoyed worldwide acclaim for their ""more than a club"" motto as they had UNICEF rather than a commercial sponsor on their shirts and produced one of the best teams the world has ever seen under Pep Guardiola largely with players from La Masia. However, Guardiola's departure has coincided with a commercial sponsorship agreement with Qatar Airways and the controversial signing of Brazilian star Neymar which led to Sandro Rosell resigning as the club's president and Barca being charged with tax fraud. - Camp Nou referendum up in the air The news comes at the worst possible time for Barca's embattled board, led by new president Josep Maria Bartomeu as their proposal for a 600 million euro ($827 million) refurbishment of the Camp Nou will go to a vote of the club's members on Saturday. It was already expected that the referendum could allow the Barca support to voice their displeasure at the board who refused to call new presidential elections despite Rosell's resignation in January. - Huge distraction at most important time of the season FIFA's bombshell fell barely 12 hours after Barca had drawn at home to Atletico Madrid in the first-leg of their Champions League quarter-final on Tuesday. Gerardo Martino's men also trail leaders Atletico by just a point with seven games to go in La Liga and face Real Madrid in the Copa del Rey final on April 16. The players and coaching staff must once again block out negative news off the field to concentrate on their fight for titles on three fronts. - Could rob La Masia of future talent Whilst the majority of those who graduate from Barca's academy come from the local Catalan region, Barca have never been adverse to acquiring talent from outwith Spain at a very young age. Most famously of all, four-time World Player of the Year Lionel Messi left his native Argentine to join Barca aged 13. FIFA's clampdown may scare off Barca's future attempts to discover a new Messi."

As well as the transfer ban, which will effectively last 14 months, FIFA fined Barcelona 450,000 Swiss francs, (369,000 euros, $509,000). The Spanish champions were given 90 days to regularise the situation of all 10 minor players concerned. A Barcelona source said they were analysing the situation and would make a statement at the approporaite time, but the club are expected to appeal against the shock sanction. Any appeal would have to be lodged with FIFA's Appeal Committee within three days and the club could take the case to the Court of Arbritration for Sport as a final measure. The ban is a new blow to the image of Europe's most successful club of the 21st Century following alleged tax evasion in its signing of star Brazilian Neymar. If upheld, the ban would have serious consequences for Barcelona, especially with veterans Carles Puyol and injured goalkeeper Victor Valdes set to leave in June. The Catalans were expected to complete the signing of German international goalkeeper Andre Ter-Stegen to replace Valdes. Croatian international Alen Halilovic's move to the club, officially announced last week, could also now be put on hold. In February last year FIFA banned six Barcelona youth team players from competitive games, Lee Seung-Woo, Paik Seung-Ho and Jang Gyeol-Hee from South Korea, Patrice Sousia of Cameroon, France's Theo Chendri and Bobby Adekanye, a Nigerian-Dutch teenager.

It was overturned after Chelsea reached an agreement with the player's former club Lens. ""The Disciplinary Committee regarded the infringements as serious and decided to sanction the club with a transfer ban at both national and international level for two complete and consecutive transfer periods,"" a FIFA statement announced. The dramatic sanction follows an investigation last year by FIFA, whose rules state that a player has to be 18 to be transferred, unless the player falls into one of three specific cases. FIFA fined the Spanish federation 500,000 Swiss francs for their role in the under-age player affair and gave them one year to modify rules concerning international transfers of minors. Both Barcelona and the Spanish federation were found guilty of illegal deals involving ""the international transfer and first registration of non-Spanish minors with the club"". The dates of the Spanish transfer windows covered by Wednesday's punishment are July 1-August 31 for the pre-season window and January 1-February 1 for the mid-season window. The world body looked at cases involving players signed by Barcelona between 2009 and 2013. International rules ban any transfer of a minor unless the player's parents have moved country; the move takes place within the European Union if a player is aged between 16 and 18; or the player's home is less than 50 kilometers (31 miles) from the national border being crossed. Barcelona were caught out by FIFA's web-based Transfer Matching System which became mandatory for all international transfers of professional male footballers in October 2010. FIFA said it took the protection of minors in football ""very seriously"", and warned that ""young football players are vulnerable to exploitation and abuse in a foreign country without the proper controls."" The sanction came less than 24 hours after Barcelona's 1-1 draw with Atletico Madrid in the Champions League quarter-final first leg. Barca's goal was scored by Neymar, whose scandal-mired transfer triggered the downfall of Barca president Sandro Rosell and saw the club indicted for an alleged tax fraud of 13.5 million euros.

1596,02/04/2014,00:34,"Football: Barca, Atletico bosses content despite drawing once more",Barcelona manager Gerardo Martino believes his side did everything in their power to break down a dogged Atletico Madrid as they were held 1-1 at the Camp Nou in the first leg of their Champions League quarter-final on Tuesday.,"Diego Ribas had put Atletico in front with a wonder strike 11 minutes into the second-half, but Barcelona responded 19 minutes from time when Neymar swept home Andres Iniesta's sublime through ball. That goal ensured the sides drew for the fourth time in as many encounters this season, but Martino was happier with his side's display than in their three previous meetings with Atletico. ""Apart from the individual performances that we can talk about, the overall display of the team leaves me very calm. Against possibly the best counter-attacking team in Spain, if not Europe, we gave up two chances in the first-half and a goal from 30 metres. ""We created three or four good chances ourselves, which is a lot against this Atletico team. I love managing a team that always tries to play in this manner. ""When the team has played badly in the past I have said so, but tonight it is fair to say that the team played very well."" Both sides suffered injury blows as Barca's Gerard Pique will be sidelined for four weeks due to a hairline fracture in his right hip, whilst Atletico's top scorer Diego Costa looks set to miss the return leg too due to a hamstring injury. Twenty-three year-old central defender Marc Bartra was forced into action after just 10 minutes by Pique's injury, but Martino has every confidence that the youngster can deputise ably for the experienced Pique in the coming weeks. ""In these situations you need to be able to count on everyone. Unfortunately, these things happen but Bartra played very well. ""I was not surprised by his performance, although to be able to come on as he did after just 10 minutes and adjust to the game straight away was very impressive."" Atletico Madrid boss Diego Simeone, meanwhile, lauded the effort of his side's players as they desperately held on in the final 20 minutes after Neymar had brought Barca level. ""I am very happy. The team worked as a group and showed enormous heart. I go through the same feelings and emotions as an Atletico fan and I know the fans can be immensely proud of the effort the team put in tonight."" Simeone refused to elaborate on how long Costa may be sidelined for, but he praised the contribution made by Diego as replaced the Spanish international after half an hour and made his mark in spectacular style with a wonderful opening goal. ""I am very happy for him because he has worked away in the background very quietly waiting for his opportunity. ""The team needs him and he needs the team, but tonight he played a complete game."" However, the Argentine coach refused to say his side now had the upper hand as they take an away goal back to the Vicente Calderon for the return next Wednesday, April 9. ""I loved the game. There were two teams with very different styles playing in their own way to break the other. ""We know it will be an extremely tough game again against a team with enormous talent. ""We have to recover well, play on Saturday and then prepare for the second-leg on Wednesday."""

However, Barca responded like a side looking to make their seventh consecutive Champions League semi-final and were level when Neymar swept home Andres Iniesta's pass 19 minutes from time. A fourth draw in as many games between the sides this season leaves the tie delicately poised for the return at the Vicente Calderon next Wednesday, April 9. ""It is what we expected beforehand, Atletico play with great intensity in every game,"" Barca midfielder Xavi Hernandez told TVE. ""Their goal was a shame for us, it was a great goal. I think we played very well and perhaps had more chances, but they played well too. ""It was difficult for us to create many opportunities. We need to try and score there, but it is not a good result for us."" However, Atletico midfielder Tiago insisted that Barca remain favourites to progress. ""We have worked very hard, Barca had a lot of the ball. They have quality and make you work, but we are comfortable with working hard. We played well and the result is great. ""Barca are still the favourites, but we have a game at home and we will have our chances. We can dream and we will give everything at the Calderon."" Atletico's David Villa had the best chance of the first half after just five minutes as the ball fell to him inside the area after an errant clearance from Jose Manuel Pinto, but the former Barca striker's effort flew just past the post. A minute later Lionel Messi had his first opening as he was upended by Gabi on the edge of the area, but the Argentine dumped the resulting free-kick into the wall. Barca then suffered an injury blow as Gerard Pique was forced off after failing to recover from an awkward fall as he challenged for an aerial ball with Costa. Neymar had Barca's first effort on goal on 24 minutes as Thibaut Courtois easily gathered the Brazilian's weak headed effort. The Atletico defence had to be at their best moments later, though, as brilliant play from Messi saw the Argentine fed Iniesta inside the area and his shot was blocked by Diego Godin. It was the visitors who were then disrupted by injury to a key player as Costa hobbled off with a pulled hamstring that will almost certainly also rule him out of the return leg next week. However, even without their top scorer, Atletico nearly went in ahead at the break as Villa this time found the target with a low drive that was beaten away by Pinto low to his left. The pace of the game rose at the beginning of the second period and despite Barca's early dominance of possession, it was Atletico who took the lead in spectacular fashion as Diego thundered a shot high into Pinto's top left-hand corner from fully 30 yards. Barca laid seige to the Atletico goal in a bid to get back on level terms as Courtois turned Sergio Busquets' well-struck volley behind before Messi was unable to direct Dani Alves' volleyed cross goalwards. Neymar did bring the hosts level on 71 minutes as his perfectly timed run was matched by Iniesta's through ball and the Brazilian slotted the ball past Courtois first time. With the volume of the Camp Nou raised by the equaliser, Barca had all the momentum in the final stages and Courtois had to make a fine low save to his left to meet a curling effort from Iniesta and then turn a Messi free-kick behind. However, Barca couldn't find a winner and will travel to Madrid needing to score at least once to reach the last four once more."

Diego Simeone's men have overcome the odds despite having an annual budget of almost 400 million euros ($550 million) less than Barca and Real and Tiago believes people in crisis-hit Spain can associate with the hard work that has taken Atletico to the top. ""I think that we have our own identity. It is very easy for people to identify with us, also because in society we are living through a period of crisis and we are fighting in the Champions League with a much lower budget,"" he said at his side's pre-match press conference on Monday. ""That is where the similarity between Robin Hood and our team comes from."" Atletico have already faced Barca three times this season, twice in the Spanish Supercup and once in La Liga at the Vicente Calderon back in January. All three encounters ended in draws, however four-time World Player of the Year Lionel Messi's involvement in two of those games was limited by injury and Simeone is expecting to face a much stronger Barca side at the Camp Nou this time around. ""Tomorrow will be the most difficult for sure. In the first game in the Supercup we played at home and then they weren't as strong as they are now. ""In the game in La Liga (Lionel) Messi also wasn't at 100 percent. We are going to compete against the best Barcelona side we have faced this season. ""Tomorrow Barcelona will want to finish the tie off and we need to stop them in whatever way we can."" Since making his return from two months out due to a hamstring injury just before the latest clash at the Calderon, Messi has hit top form, scoring nine times in his last five games in all competitions. The Argentine has now struck 36 times in as many games this season, but Atletico's Diego Costa is only three behind Messi with 33 goals so far this campaign. And Simeone believes his star man is just as important to Atletico as Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo are to Barca and Real Madrid respectively. ""Without doubt (he is just as important). Just like Ronaldo is for Real Madrid or Messi for Barcelona, Diego Costa is for us. Each one has his own style, but they are all fundamental to their teams. ""Tomorrow two players in amazing form will face off. Messi has shown that he has had a good rest in those two months that he didn't play and that is good for us Argentines ahead of the World Cup,"" he said with a wry smile. Midfielder Raul Garcia is the only major absence from Simeone's squad as he is suspended so David Villa could come in to start against his former club."

1604,29/03/2014,19:10,Football: Martino dedicates derby win to injured Valdes,Barcelona coach Gerardo Martino dedicated his side's crucial 1-0 win away to Espanyol in the Catalan derby to stricken goalkeeper Victor Valdes.,"The Spanish international looks to have played his last game for the club after suffering cruciate ligament damage in Barca's 3-0 win over Celta Vigo on Wednesday. Valdes had already signalled his intention to leave the club when his contract expires in June and will now also miss the World Cup in Brazil. ""I would like to on behalf of all of us - the technical team, players, staff - to send our support to Victor. We hope his recovery will be quick and obviously we dedicate this victory to him,"" said Martino. ""This team is used to bad news, both on and off the pitch, for a while now and their way to respond is on the pitch as they have always done."" Barca couldn't afford to be weighed down by the news of Valdes' injury as they travelled to local rivals Espanyol amidst the tightest La Liga title race in years. And they ground out a vital win as Lionel Messi's penalty 14 minutes from time was enough to hand them a second 1-0 win over Espanyol this season. ""Derbies are always derbies and you have to win them,"" added Martino. ""It doesn't come easy and they are always tight games, for that reason this was a risky away game for us and we value the three points even more."" Victory moves Barca two points clear of Atletico Madrid and five ahead of Real Madrid with both sides from the capital in action later on Saturday against Athletic Bilbao and Rayo Vallecano respectively. The Catalans now firmly have the destiny of the title in their own hands as they host Atletico on the final day of the season. However, Martino is taking nothing for granted after suffering a shock defeat to relegation-threatened Valladolid earlier this month. ""What is left continues to be very difficult and very important. We still have seven finals left between now and the end of the league season and in those games we will also have with us the memory of our defeat in Valladolid."" It was a thrilling 4-3 win over Real Madrid at the Santiago Bernabeu last weekend that put Barca right back in the fight for the title and midfielder Sergio Busquets insists they are determined not to let their advantage slip. ""Real Madrid had the advantage, the Bernabeu was an ultimatum for us and we recovered. That is the mentality of the team and we need to continue like that,"" he told Canal Plus. ""Now we are in a privileged position and we depend on ourselves. Hopefully that will be the way things continue until the final game against Atletico Madrid."""

Valdes will also miss Spain's defence of their World Cup title in Brazil later this year. ""Victor Valdes has ruptured the anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee that will require surgery,"" Barcelona confirmed via the club's official Twitter account. ""It is very bad luck and a very costly injury, too much for a game that means just three points,"" Barca sporting director Andoni Zubizarreta told Barca TV. Midfielder Andres Iniesta, meanwhile admitted it was difficult for the Barca players to concentrate on the game after the injury. ""It was an uncomfortable situation on the pitch. The players weren't the same, the fans weren't the same. Everything seemed a bit strange. ""The important thing now is that he recovers well."" Valdes has made the fourth highest number of appearances in Barca's history having been first-choice goalkeeper at the club since 2003. He has won six La Liga titles and three Champions Leagues in that time, but announced last year he would leave the Catalan capital at the end of the current season to seek a new challenge."

If the injury is as serious as first feared, the 32-year-old will also almost certainly miss the World Cup in Brazil."
1607,25/03/2014,14:07,Football: Martino wants Barca to build on Clasico triumph,Barcelona boss Gerardo Martino believes it is his side's own fault that they aren't in a more comfortable position in La Liga despite beating Real Madrid twice this season.,"Lionel Messi inspired the Catalans to a famous 4-3 away at the Santiago Bernabeu on Sunday night as he notched his second hat-trick in as many games. Victory brought Martino's men back into the title race as they now trail leaders Atletico Madrid and Real by just one point with nine games remaining. However, the Argentine warned that his side can suffer no slip-ups of the kind they have suffered at Real Sociedad and Valladolid in recent weeks if they are to retain their title, starting with Celta Vigo's visit to the Camp Nou on Wednesday. ""Last weekend has allowed us to get back in the league. Now we have to continue playing well against Celta and what remains of the league season. We cannot make a mistakes,"" he said on Tuesday. ""Our wish is to perform at a high level and to have similar individual performances to those we had on Sunday. ""The competitions are entering their final stage and if we don't maintain that level it will endanger our chances of winning any titles. ""Generally, we need to be consistent. That is why we are not in a different position today, above all in the league. If we had maintained consistency in our performances and results, we would be in a much better position."" Martino has left Xavi out of his 18-man squad for the game against Celta with the Catalan derby away to Espanyol and a return to Champions League action against Atletico Madrid next week in mind. Pedro Rodriguez, Alexis Sanchez and Marc Bartra are also likely to feature after being left on the bench at the Bernabeu."
1608,25/03/2014,12:22,Football: Camp Nou vote crucial for Barcelona - Bartomeu,"The future of Barcelona will depend on a 600 million euro renovation of the legendary Nou Camp stadium and its finances, according to club president Josep Maria Bartomeu.","Bartomeu told AFP sport in an exclusive interview the reforms are more important than his board. ""It is a project that will last for the next 50 or 60 years, therefore it cannot be something tied to this board."" The club's 164,000 members will vote on April 5 on the renovation project which would be partly financed by adding a sponsor's name to the historic Camp Nou title. The renovation would take the Nou Camp capacity from 99,000 to 105,000 -- extending its lead as Europe's biggest football stadium. It could also help Barcelona, the world's second richest club, make ground on leaders and eternal rivals Real Madrid. Bartomeu took charge of Barcelona in January after Sandro Rosell resigned as he faced legal action accusing him of misappropriation of funds for not disclosing the destination of all the money spent on Brazilian star Neymar last year. Subsequently, on Bartomeu's first day in charge, the club revealed all the figures and clauses involved in the deal, which totalled 86.2 million euros. However, as a result Barca were then indicted by a Spanish judge for an alleged 13.5 million euro tax fraud linked to the signing. Barcelona have voluntarily paid that amount in full, although they continue to protest their innocence and are confident the money will be returned following a full investigation. And Bartomeu stressed that the referendum is not an opinion poll on his succession to the presidency. ""All that we have done is for the club, we have worked at it, done the studies and now we are putting forward an informative and democratic campaign to the members. The important thing for us and everyone else is that the referendum is the club's project, not the board's."" The proposed project includes work on the football stadium and the creation of a new basketball arena and club offices across a 20 hectare site. An overhaul of the stadium would also allow Barcelona to improve their hospitality facilities to significantly increase their matchday revenue, one of the few economic areas in which they still lag behind European rivals. ""We are not going to use naming rights, but title rights. Our idea is that the Camp Nou will have a surname. ""It is a way to help finance the project. This is an ambitious project that in total with the basketball arena and the new stadium for the Barca B football team is around 600 million euros ($860 million), which is a huge investment. ""With the title right we will finance a third of the project. The other two thirds will come from income that the club has and generates regularly and from the extra income we will have thanks to the new facilities."" However, Bartomeu is steadfast that the extra commercialisation of the club along with the bad publicity generated by Neymar's signing does not damage Barca's ""more than a club"" motto. ""FC Barcelona, for the members and those of us who are fans, is more than a club. It has always been so. ""In this case we have always tried to demonstrate and use the values that represent Barcelona in our declarations, actions, in the way in which we have managed the club and will continue to do so. ""In the case of Neymar we are very calm because we have done things properly, and legally. ""Moreover, we are not a club that is used to signing players constantly from other clubs. We are a club that always tries to form players in our academy, who grow little by little before arriving at the first team."""

Subsequently, on Bartomeu's first day in charge, the club revealed all the figures and clauses involved in the deal, which totalled 86.2 million euros.

The important thing for us and everyone else is that the referendum is the club's project, not the board's."" As a means of funding the project should the proposal get the green light at the referendum, the club will look to sell title rights to the stadium, meaning a sponsor's name would appear alongside the historic Camp Nou name.

1610,24/03/2014,10:39,Football: Spain hails 'historic' Barca-Real duel,"Barcelona's thrilling 4-3 away victory over Real Madrid was one of the greatest 'clasico' clashes in history, Spain's press said Monday, declaring the La Liga title race now wide open.","Barcelona's Lionel Messi, helped by Andres Iniesta, conquered the Bernabeu, papers said, after the Argentinian scored a hat trick that made him the most prolific scorer in the history of 'clasico' matches between the arch rivals. ""Barcelona emerged the victors in all aspects of a frenetic night of football and goals, one of the best duels that the eternal rivalry between the two giants of the Liga has produced,"" wrote leading sports daily Marca. Real Madrid did everything they could to win but Barcelona had the answer, the paper said. ""Driven by the sensational Iniesta and held by the genius of Messi, Barca overcame every adversity,"" Marca said. Real Madrid's defeat left them trailing Spanish league leaders Atletico Madrid on goal difference, with Barcelona just one point behind them. ""The League Begins,"" Marca's front page headlined. Rival sports daily AS's front page ran with the headline: ""Football Storm."" ""Three penalties, seven goals, one expulsion and much emotion,"" the paper said. Barcelona-based papers celebrated. ""Messi destroys Madrid,"" said the front page of Sport. ""Leo, outstanding with three goals, and Iniesta signed another historic victory in the Bernabeu,"" the paper said. ""It was an orchestra against a band,"" said Sport's football commentator Josep Maria Casanovas. ""It was like a coup d'etat. Those who believed they were favourites were defeated,"" he added. ""The Bernabeu had to surrender to the great Barcelona game."" The paper labelled Madrid's Cristiano Ronaldo a ""cry baby"" after he criticised referee Alberto Undiano Mallenco's performance and said ""many people didn't want us to win today"". Mallenco awarded three penalties on the night with Ronaldo scoring the first one for Madrid to put them 3-2 up 10 minutes after half-time. However, Sergio Ramos was then sent-off for denying a clear goalscoring opportunity for a foul on Neymar inside the area. Then Xabi Alonso was adjudged to have tripped Andres Iniesta seven minutes from time. ""Delirious!"" blared the front page of Barcelona-based Mundo Deportivo, summing up the mood in the Catalan capital."
1611,22/03/2014,14:56,"Football: Last chance saloon for Barca, admits Martino",Barcelona boss Gerardo Martino has admitted that his side need to beat Real Madrid at the Santiago Bernabeu on Sunday if they are to have any chance of retaining their La Liga title.,"Three defeats in their last seven La Liga games have left the Catalans four points behind leaders Madrid with just 10 games remaining. And with Real having not lost in any competition since the sides last met in October, Martino knows Barca have a unique opportunity to get themselves back into the title race. ""I think it is probably the last chance we will have because after this game there are only nine games left and it is not the same thing to come back from one point behind to four or seven,"" he said on Saturday. ""Teams at this point of the season, particularly those ones fighting for the league, don't make that many slip ups. ""I don't think a draw is a good result for us. The circumstances of the game always indicate whether it is a good result or not as well, but I think it is clear that we need to win the game tomorrow."" Barca's away form has been the principal reason that they have ceded an early season advantage over Madrid as they have won just one of five league games on the road in 2014, including defeats at Real Sociedad and Valladolid. However, Martino's men did manage a 2-0 win away to Manchester City last month which guided them into the quarter-finals of the Champions League and he is looking for a repeat of that performance at the Bernabeu. ""It is true that there have been games away from home where we have not played well, but there have also been some important ones where we have. ""We have to think more about what we did in Manchester than what we did in Valladolid and try to aim for that type of performance."" Neymar is expected to be recalled by Martino despite the fine form shown by Pedro Rodriguez and Alexis Sanchez in Barca's 7-0 destruction of Osasuna last weekend. The Brazilian star has had an underwhelming first season in Spain with controversy over his transfer from Santos dominating the headlines rather than his performances on the field. Yet, Martino insisted that the 22-year-old has nothing to prove. ""Firstly, I think he played very well against Manchester City in the second leg and, secondly, I will reaffirm what I have said many times that Neymar is one of the top five players in the world. ""I don't need to see one match, half a match, nor even 10 matches to confirm the qualities that he has. I don't think it will be long before people stop talking about him like just another player because he isn't."""
1612,22/03/2014,02:15,Football: Five classic El Clasico clashes,Real Madrid meet Barcelona for the 227th time on Sunday in a potentially decisive clash in the La Liga title race as Real hold a four-point advantage over Barca with just 10 games remaining.,"Here, AFP Sports looks at five famous matches from the historic rivalry between Spain's two biggest clubs. Real Madrid 5 Barcelona 0 (La Liga, January 8, 1995) Just a year after guiding Barca to a 5-0 win over Real, Danish midfielder Michael Laudrup sealed his controversial switch to Los Blancos by sealing revenge for his new side by the same scoreline thanks to an Ivan Zamorano hat-trick and further goals from future Barca favourite Luis Enrique and Jose Emilio Amavisca. Barcelona 3 Real Madrid 3 (La Liga, March 10, 2007) Lionel Messi announced his arrival on the Clasico stage by scoring a hat-trick as 10-man Barca came from behind three times to snatch a dramatic draw. The Argentine's brilliance couldn't spark a revival in the title race, however, as Madrid went onto win the league, finishing 18 points ahead of third-placed Barca. Real Madrid 2 Barcelona 6 (La Liga, May 2, 2009) Pep Guardiola's first game in charge of Barcelona at the Bernabeu was also billed as a title decider as Madrid came into the game just four points behind Barca's eventual treble winners and on a run of 17 wins and a draw in 18 league games. They even scored first through Gonzalo Higuain, but Barca responded emphatically as goals from Catalan born centre-backs Carles Puyol and Gerard Pique added to doubles from Thierry Henry and Messi. Barcelona 5 Real Madrid 0 (La Liga, November 29, 2010) Barca's best performance of the Guardiola era destroyed Jose Mourinho's Madrid to move top of the table and they never ceded that advantage on their way to a third consecutive title. Messi was once again the driving force, although he didn't get on the scoresheet, as he provided two glorious assists for David Villa after Xavi and Pedro Rodriguez had put Barca in control before Jeffran Suarez rounded off a famous night for the Blaugrana. Barcelona 1 Real Madrid 2 (La Liga, April 21, 2012) Mourinho was to finally have his revenge on Guardiola 17 months later as Real all but sealed their 32nd title by inflicting Barca's first defeat at the Camp Nou in 55 games. Fittingly, it was Cristiano Ronaldo who colly slotted home the winner after Alexis Sanchez had cancelled out Sami Khedira's opener."
1613,21/03/2014,15:36,Football: Bale back to Premier League best - Valdes,Barcelona goalkeeper Victor Valdes believes Gareth Bale is back to the form which made him Premier League Player of the Year last season.,"Valdes will be tasked with trying to stop the Welshman and the rest of his free-scoring Real Madrid teammates when he lines up for Barca in what could be his final appearance for the club against Los Blancos. Bale has scored 14 times so far in his debut season in Madrid and Valdes in under no illusions as to the threat he will pose to Barca on Sunday. ""I think that at the start he had physical problems due to the fact he didn't have an adequate pre-season, but now he looks very good,"" he said on Friday. ""He is at an optimal level of fitness and confidence and Madrid are seeing that in his play. ""It is the Gareth Bale we are used to seeing play in England with more efforts on goal and they are also letting him have a go at free-kicks. He is a very dangerous player and Madrid are taking advantage of that."" Barca's form on the road in La Liga has slumped in 2014 as they have won just one of their last five away games and lost their last two at Real Sociedad and Valladolid. Those defeats have seen the Catalans fall four points behind leaders Real in the title race and with just 10 games to go Valdes admits his side have to go for broke at the Bernabeu. ""The are three vital points, just as they were in Valladolid or (against Sociedad) at Anoeta and we didn't have the luck to get them there. ""We will face the Clasico with the same desire. More than anything we have to go there to win because that is the only way we know how to play. We need to attack with the ball."" Barca's biggest problem away from home has been conceding early. Gerardo Martino's men they haven't scored first in any of their last seven La Liga games on the road and Valdes is determined to put that stat right on Sunday. ""We have worked hard during the week on certain aspects to try counteract all that, but the opponents also have the right to play. ""We hope that on Sunday it won't happen again."""
1614,13/03/2014,01:00,Football: Zabaleta baffled by refereeing as City exit Europe,Manchester City defender Pablo Zabaleta claimed he didn't know why he had been sent off as his side were dumped out of the Champions League by Barcelona in a 2-1 defeat at the Camp Nou which saw the Catalans progress 4-1 on aggregate.,"The Argentine was dismissed for a second yellow card with the score at 1-0 with 12 minutes remaining after City had a strong penalty appeal waved away when Edin Dzeko appeared to have been felled by Gerard Pique. Vincent Kompany and Dani Alves rounded off the scoring in the final couple of minutes, but the damage to the visitors' chances of going through had already been done as Lionel Messi killed off the tie with the opening goal 23 minutes from time. ""I don't know why he sent me off. It was a clear penalty and the referee is two metres away from the incident,"" Zabaleta said. ""There was a clear foul on Dzeko too in the build-up to Barca's first goal, which he gave as a free kick to Barcelona. ""In the heat of the moment I ran towards him, but I didn't show any lack of respect because I couldn't say anything given I was on a yellow card."" Defeat means City bow out of a second competition in four days having suffered an embarrassing 2-1 defeat to Championship side Wigan Athletic in the FA Cup on Sunday. However, Zabaleta said they had shown enough in their performance at the Camp Nou to suggest they stand a real chance of winning the Premier League title for the second time in three years. ""It was a very even game. They had good moments and so did we, but the team that makes the most of their chances is the one that deserves to win, so in that sense it is a fair result,"" he said. ""We are obviously hurt to go out because we are a team that aspires to win every competition, but that is football. ""Now we need to reduce the gap in the Premier League. We are nine points off Chelsea but we have three games in hand."" Barca have also suffered on the domestic front of late as they have fallen four points behind Real Madrid in La Liga thanks to three defeats in six games. And coach Gerardo Martino is hoping beating a team of City's calibre will re-energise his team for the final two months of the season. ""It is clear it hasn't been an easy week, but it is also true that our opponent could have gone much further in this competition. We had to suffer, but that is why you live for the Champions League,"" he said. ""They were two very hard games and we won them both. That means the players have done well collectively and individually. ""It wasn't just about going through, but to do so in the manner we did. That could strengthen us for what is to come, but the league still depends on how we react."" There could be more bad news to come for City as their top scorer this season, Sergio Aguero, had to be replaced at halftime due to hamstring strain and will undergo a scan on Thursday. ""I felt something in my left leg in the run with Messi at the start of the game,"" said the Argentine. ""I tried to continue, but at halftime I didn't want to run any more risks."" City assistant boss Ruben Cousillas said he was hopeful the injury would not keep Aguero out for much of the title run in. ""It is still too early to say how long he could be out. Apparently it is nothing serious,"" he said. ""He will have a scan tomorrow. The doctors will decide, at the moment we can't speculate."" Cousillas was on the touchline as manager Manuel Pellegrini was serving a UEFA ban for criticising referee Jonas Eriksson after the first leg and he hailed his side's performance in difficult circumstances. ""We are frustrated. We played a great game against a very difficult opponent,"" he said. ""We had our chances, but when you are left with 10 men it is always very difficult. ""After just eight months at the club we have our first trophy, which is important. Last week we were in four competitions, now there is just one left. ""We showed tonight that we are sill alive and we are going to fight for the Premier League."""
1615,12/03/2014,22:58,Football: Barcelona edge 10-man City to march into quarters,Second-half goals from Lionel Messi and Dani Alves booked Barcelona's place in the Champions League quarter-finals for a seventh consecutive year as they beat Manchester City 2-1 at the Camp Nou on Wednesday to progress 4-1 on aggregate.,"City were looking to become the first side to come back from losing the first leg 2-0 at home in the Champions League era and they had chances to reduce the deficit as Victor Valdes denied Samir Nasri and Edin Dzeko either side of half-time. However, Messi killed the tie as a contest with 23 minutes remaining as he pounced on a loose ball inside the area to flick home his eighth Champions League goal of the season. The visitors were then reduced to 10 men as Pablo Zabaleta was shown a second yellow card for dissent after Dzeko looked to have a legitimate penalty claim waved away by French referee Stephane Lannoy. City captain Vincent Kompany looked to have salvaged at least a draw on the night when he tapped home a minute from time, but Alves restored Barca's lead from Andres Iniesta's cut-back in stoppage time. Kompany complained that the sending-off had been unfair and costly to City. ""We've got nothing left in the tank, we gave everything. A few times we could've scored and obviously that would've changed the game,"" he told Sky Sports. ""Going for the second time down to 10 men when it was a clear penalty, it's not easy conditions to come and play against such a good team. ""Over the course of the two games, whenever we were with 11 players there wasn't much between the two teams. ""Obviously Messi is an incredible player, whenever he has the ball danger can happen, but we had a few chances too."" With a huge mountain to climb, City started on the front foot but they were lucky not to concede a penalty on eight minutes when Messi went down under a challenge from Joleon Lescott. The visitors' first opening arrived on 16 minutes when James Milner could only direct Aleksandar Kolarov's driven cross wide of the target. City were then handed another break by the officials as Neymar had a goal controversially ruled out for offside as Jordi Alba was deemed to have been offside when he crossed for the Brazilian to finish. Joe Hart was called into his most strenuous save of the first-half six minutes before the break as he turned Neymar's near post effort behind and the England number one had to be alert seconds later to prevent Xavi prodding home on the stretch from Messi's cross. Nasri then had a fantastic chance to give City hope as a fantastic move involving Yaya Toure and David Silva fell to the Frenchman, but his low effort was straight at Valdes. With City still needing two goals to even force extra time, the injured Sergio Aguero was replaced by Dzeko at the break. However, the Bosnian nearly made an instant impact as his low drive was smothered by Valdes. Messi came within inches of sealing the tie with another wonderful solo run on 50 minutes as he teased Lescott before passing the ball off the inside of the post. City then had a couple of great chances to get back into the tie as Valdes produced a magnificent save to turn Dzeko's towering header over the bar before Zabaleta skewed wildly wide when presented with a clear sight of goal at the back post. The opener finally arrived when Cesc Fabregas's intended through ball bounced off Lescott into the path of Messi and he gave Hart no chance with a nonchalant finish off the outside of his left foot. There was still more controversy to come, though, as Dzeko appeared to have been felled by Gerard Pique inside the area. Lannoy was again unmoved and Zabaleta was dismissed for taking his protests too far as a host of City players surrounded the referee.

However, Messi killed the tie as a contest with 23 minutes remaining as he pounced on a loose ball inside the area to flick home his eighth Champions League goal of the season. The visitors were then reduced to 10 men as Pablo Zabaleta was shown a second yellow card for dissent after Dzeko looked to have a legitimate penalty claim waved away by French referee Stephane Lannoy. City captain Vincent Kompany looked to have salvaged at least a draw on the night when he tapped home a minute from time, but Alves restored Barca's lead from Andres Iniesta's cut-back in stoppage time. Kompany complained that the sending-off had been unfair and costly to City. ""We've got nothing left in the tank, we gave everything. A few times we could've scored and obviously that would've changed the game,"" he told Sky Sports. ""Going for the second time down to 10 men when it was a clear penalty, it's not easy conditions to come and play against such a good team. ""Over the course of the two games, whenever we were with 11 players there wasn't much between the two teams. ""Obviously Messi is an incredible player, whenever he has the ball danger can happen, but we had a few chances too."" With a huge mountain to climb, City started on the front foot but they were lucky not to concede a penalty on eight minutes when Messi went down under a challenge from Joleon Lescott. The visitors' first opening arrived on 16 minutes when James Milner could only direct Aleksandar Kolarov's driven cross wide of the target. City were then handed another break by the officials as Neymar had a goal controversially ruled out for offside as Jordi Alba was deemed to have been offside when he crossed for the Brazilian to finish. Joe Hart was called into his most strenuous save of the first-half six minutes before the break as he turned Neymar's near post effort behind and the England number one had to be alert seconds later to prevent Xavi prodding home on the stretch from Messi's cross. Nasri then had a fantastic chance to give City hope as a fantastic move involving Yaya Toure and David Silva fell to the Frenchman, but his low effort was straight at Valdes. With City still needing two goals to even force extra time, the injured Sergio Aguero was replaced by Dzeko at the break. However, the Bosnian nearly made an instant impact as his low drive was smothered by Valdes. Messi came within inches of sealing the tie with another wonderful solo run on 50 minutes as he teased Lescott before passing the ball off the inside of the post. City then had a couple of great chances to get back into the tie as Valdes produced a magnificent save to turn Dzeko's towering header over the bar before Zabaleta skewed wildly wide when presented with a clear sight of goal at the back post. The opener finally arrived when Cesc Fabregas's intended through ball bounced off Lescott into the path of Messi and he gave Hart no chance with a nonchalant finish off the outside of his left foot. There was still more controversy to come, though, as Dzeko appeared to have been felled by Gerard Pique inside the area. Lannoy was again unmoved and Zabaleta was dismissed for taking his protests too far as a host of City players surrounded the referee. The English side did manage a consolation a minute from time when Kompany tapped home Dzeko's knockdown from a corner. However, Barca weren't to be denied victory on the night as with their next attack Iniesta rounded Hart and kept his head to set up Alves to hammer home from close range."

1618,11/03/2014,18:58,Football: Kompany revives title memories to inspire comeback,Manchester City captain Vincent Kompany believes his side can take encouragement from their Premier League title in 2012 as they look to produce a historic comeback against Barcelona on Wednesday.,"City trail 2-0 from the first leg of the Champions League last 16 tie at the Etihad three weeks ago when a Lionel Messi penalty and a late strike from Dani Alves put Barca in command. No team has ever come back from a two-goal first leg deficit at home in the Champions League era, but Kompany believes they can be inspired by the final day of the 2011/12 season when they scored twice in stoppage time to beat Queens Park Rangers and steal the title away from Manchester United on goal difference. ""Football is made out of nights like this. If anything should give you belief then it should be that day against QPR. We're here to try and have one of those special nights,"" he said on Tuesday. ""It's in our own hands and that's the good thing, so I guess the message to everyone is that we have to believe."" Kompany had previously described Barca as ""there for the taking"" before Martin Demichelis's red card for chopping down Messi, which led to the penalty, turned the tie firmly in the Spanish side's favour. The Catalans have since suffered two defeats in three La Liga games to Real Sociedad and Valladolid, and with Sergio Aguero back fit, Kompany is sure City can score the goals needed to get them back into the tie. ""I'm actually very excited about this one. I think the whole team is. ""If everything goes well, we're capable of hurting Barcelona, so that's what I want to focus on. ""I like to focus on my strikers because I know that if they score we have a chance, but everyone needs to be a their best."" City boss Manuel Pellegrini didn't attend his side's pre-match press conference as he is serving a ban from UEFA for his critical comments aimed at Swedish referee Jonas Eriksson after the first leg. However, his assistant Ruben Cousillas confirmed that Matija Nastasic and Stevan Jovetic had remained in Manchester along with Demichelis as they are injured. Otherwise, Pellegrini has a fully-fit squad to choose from with England international Joleon Lescott expected to replace Demicheilis alongside Kompany in central defence."
1619,11/03/2014,02:30,Football: Crisis hit Barca in need of Champions League boost,Barcelona host Manchester City in the second leg of their Champions League last 16 tie on Wednesday desperately in need of a good performance to distract attention from a dreadful start to 2014 on and off the field.,"When the Catalans were given the hardest draw open to them in a pairing with City back in December, it was a minor setback on what had until then been a season that had exceeded expectations. Despite being hastily appointed just two weeks before the campaign kicked off as Tito Vilanova was unfortunately forced to resign due to on-going health problems, coach Gerardo Martino oversaw Barca's best ever start to a La Liga season. Martino's first defeat in charge came in the Champions League to a youthful Ajax side in November, but it mattered little as Barca also strolled through to the last 16 as winners of Group H. However, this year has so far proved to be a more difficult time for the club. In January, Sandro Rosell resigned as president due to on-going legal action for misappropriation of funds over the controversial signing of Brazilian star Neymar last May. Rosell had insisted the 22-year-old's transfer had cost the club 57 million euros ($79 million, £47 million), but the day after his departure Barcelona released figures showing the overall cost of the operation, including a signing bonus for the player, marketing deals and other collaborative agreements, amounted to 86.2 million euros. The club were then charged with tax fraud over the transfer and paid 13.5 million euros to the Spanish treasury despite protesting that they had not committed any offence. Those fiscal troubles have now been reflected in the Spanish champions' performances on the field as Saturday's 1-0 defeat to lowly Valladolid saw them lose for the third time in six La Liga games. Barca now trail historical rivals Real Madrid by four points in the title race and still have to travel to Madrid to face Los Blancos in a potential title decider on March 23. The return of the Champions League does provide some light relief for the embattled Martino. Barca's 2-0 win away at the Etihad over City three weeks ago is widely seen as his most impressive result since taking charge and the English side's visit to the Camp Nou offers the chance to dispel the doubts as merely a dip in form. ""We have lost one game and it seems as if someone has died,"" argued Barca forward Alexis Sanchez on Monday. However, at the moment the club seems to be lurching from one crisis to the next. Neymar's arrival has been far more noteworthy for its impact off the field than on it. He has struggled to strike up a partnership with four-time World Player of the Year Lionel Messi and looks a shadow of the player in a Barca strip compared to his form at international level with Brazil. It would take an historic collapse for Barca to not progress to the last eight as no side has ever come back from losing 2-0 at home in the Champions League era. Yet, having reached a record six successive semi-finals in the competition, the growing feeling is that Barcelona are a side in transition. Carles Puyol and Victor Valdes, two of the key figures of the team that has won three Champions Leagues and six La Liga titles over the past decade, have announced they will leave the club at the end of the season. Meanwhile, the midfield general of that side that conquered Europe, Xavi Hernandez, is now 34 and plagued by injuries that prevent him from having the impact he once did. The 2-0 deficit may prove to be too big for even the high-scoring City to overcome. However, they may never have a better opportunity to announce their arrival as a big player on the Champions League stage than landing the knockout blow to the confidence-sapped, four-time European champions at the Camp Nou."
1620,06/03/2014,15:16,Football: Spain confident of more World Cup glory - Iniesta,Barcelona and Spain midfielder Andres Iniesta believes his country can continue their unprecedented run of success with a fourth consecutive major tournament win at the World Cup in Brazil later this year.,"Iniesta scored the solitary goal in the 2010 final against the Netherlands to give La Roja their first ever World Cup and was also a key member of the sides that won the European Championship in 2008 and 2012. Vicente del Bosque's men have been handed a handed a difficult group alongside the Dutch once more, Chile and Australia for the showpiece event in Brazil. However, Iniesta is hoping to relive the joy he experienced after netting the most important goal of his career in Johannesburg four years ago. ""It is the greatest feeling of happiness, joy and pride to be able to score the goal and win a World Cup, which is something very few countries have won,"" he said as he helped launch Nike's new Magista boot for the World Cup on Thursday. ""It was a beautiful thing and now we have the chance to defend it. ""We are going with the intention to retain it. We know we have to go step by step because a World Cup is incredibly difficult, but I think we should be confident that we will be able to do something significant at the World Cup."" Before Iniesta even gets to Brazil, though, he could collect another few medals as Barcelona are still alive in three competitions. The club's long-serving captain Carles Puyol announced earlier this week that he would leave the club at the end of the current campaign after being plagued by injuries in the last couple of seasons. And Iniesta said Puyol's departure would provide even more motivation to end the season successfully in La Liga, the Copa del Rey and the Champions League. ""There is no one who represents what he does. It is sad news for what he is as a player and a person. ""We will try between now and the end of the season to ensure he leaves on a high note. ""We have the highest expectations in all three competitions. We have the desire and wish to win titles and we will fight until the end to achieve it."""

""At the end of the season I will leave FC Barcelona. The club are aware of this and we are in agreement,"" he said. ""We will rescind the final two years of my contract that were still to run."" Puyol signed a new deal with the club in January last year, but admitted in June that he would not stay if injuries continued to prevent him from playing a significant part on the field. And having featured just 10 times this season in all competitions, he said it was time for a new challenge in a less physically demanding environment. ""After the last two operations it has been difficult for me to recover the level I need to be able to continue here, more than I expected and more than surgeons said. That is why I have taken this decision."" Puyol didn't reveal where he would go at the end of the current campaign and insisted he will give everything in what remains of the season to help Barca succeed on three fronts. ""I am not leaving today, there are still three months of the season remaining and those that know me know that I will not give up until the end. I will continue fighting to help the team improve and achieve our objectives this season. ""I don't know what I will do on June 30. What I do know is that I will need time to rest. I have had four years without a break due to the injuries. That is what I will do and then we will see."" The announcement brings to an end an extraordinary career in the Barcelona first team that began in 1999. Puyol is the club's second most decorated player of all-time, behind only teammate Xavi Hernandez, having made 593 appearances. After beginning his career as a right-back, Puyol was converted into one of the most successful centre-backs in world football over the past decade as he won three Champions Leagues and six La Liga titles with his boyhood club. A number of Puyol's teammates past and present paid tribute to an historic figure in Spanish football. ""I will continue to enjoy being at your side until the end of this season. It has been an honour. I wish you the best for what is to come. There is no one like you captain,"" Andres Iniesta wrote on his official Facebook page. ""Thanks captain for all you have taught me. Good luck,"" Cesc Fabregas said in a tweet alongside a photo of the two of them just after Fabregas re-signed for the club in 2011. Puyol was also a key part of the Spanish sides that won the European Championship in 2008 and the country's first World Cup in 2010, memorably heading home the goal that took his side to the final in South Africa with a 1-0 win over Germany. ""Carles is an example for everyone on and off the field,"" Spain coach Vicente del Bosque said on Tuesday. In total he has represented Spain 100 times with his last appearance coming in a 3-1 friendly win over Uruguay in February 2013, making him one of only eight players to have won a century of caps with La Roja. ""He is a natural leader, a person that when you hear his name you think of Barcelona,"" added former Barca midfielder Thiago Alcantara, now of Bayern Munich. ""In the time I was there he was a reference on and off the pitch. Everyone knows him and whilst Puyol is in the world of football, he will be an example for everyone."""

It said that Pellegrini had been charged with ""violation of the general principles of conduct"" set down in UEFA regulations, and that his case would be beard on February 28. The Manchester City manager was incensed by referee Jonas Eriksson's performance in Tuesday's last 16 first-leg match at the Etihad Stadium, which saw Lionel Messi open the scoring from the penalty spot after Martin Demichelis had been sent off for fouling him. Pellegrini disagreed with the decision, arguing that the foul had started outside the penalty area and that City midfielder Jesus Navas had been impeded by Serio Busquets in the build-up to the incident. He also accused Eriksson of being ""not impartial"" and even suggested that he should not have been put in charge of the game because he came from Sweden. However, addressing the media on Friday, the Chilean admitted that he had spoken out of turn. ""When you lose a game the way we lost against Barcelona, you are frustrated, you are angry,"" Pellegrini told a press conference.

1627,21/02/2014,05:20,Football: Judge indicts Barca over alleged tax fraud,A judge indicted Spanish football champions Barcelona on Thursday over alleged tax crimes linked to their signing of Brazilian star striker Neymar.,"Prosecutors accuse Barcelona, who currently have a narrow lead at the top of the Spanish league, of irregularities in the 86-million-euro ($118 million) deal -- charges which the club denies. Judge Pablo Ruz at Madrid's National Court indicted the club after seeing ""sufficient evidence to investigate a possible crime against the public treasury"", he said in a written ruling. The judge ordered tax authorities to hand over the club's tax returns for 2011 to 2013. He sought to establish whether or not Neymar, who joined Barcelona in May 2013, was counted as a taxpayer in Spain or his native Brazil that year. The judge also asked tax authorities to provide information about the taxing of deals linked to Neymar's signing and about how much may have been ""defrauded"". He ordered Neymar's father, Neymar da Silva Santos, to hand over contracts and documents from various companies linked to the signing. A court source said separately that the judge had also asked world football's governing body FIFA to provide information it has about Neymar's signing. State prosecutors have alleged that Barcelona owe the taxman nine million euros ($12.5 million) in deals to bring the player to the Spanish champions from Brazilian club Santos. Prosecutors said on Wednesday that there were ""a suspicious number of simulated contracts"". Barcelona insisted that they have not broken the law at any point during the deal and vowed to clear their name. ""The club's dealings with respect to this operation... were at all times in line with the relevant legal legislation,"" they said in a statement. The club's new president Josep Maria Bartomeu vowed to defend the team in an interview with state television TVE. ""We will defend our interests with all the necessary firmness. We are very clear that we have acted well,"" Bartomeu said. ""We are going to defend and explain perfectly to all Barca's members that we are calm, that we have not done anything illegal,"" he said. ""We are among those clubs that pay all our debts to the tax collector and in this sense I believe that Barcelona is an exemplary club,"" he added. The club's former president Sandro Rosell resigned last month over the judicial wrangle sparked by Neymar's signing, which the club said cost 57.1 million euros. The case was started by one of Barca's own members, Jordi Cases. He accused Rosell of misappropriation for not declaring publicly that 40 million of the 57.1 million figure quoted by Barca was paid to N&amp;N, a company controlled by the player's parents. Following Rosell's resignation, the club revealed that the entire cost of the operation including Neymar's signing bonus, commissions, marketing deals, a donation to the player's foundation and other deals totalled 86.2 million euros. State prosecutors in Brazil have also called on its tax authorities to investigate potential tax fraud. In an uncharacteristic blast earlier this month, Neymar himself reacted angrily to the controversy. ""I've been quiet until now! But I can't go on listening to all these things about my transfer,"" he wrote on the social media network Instagram. ""A lot of people come out and talk a load of rubbish -- calling our character into doubt,"" he wrote. ""I also understood we have masses of false friends."" On the field the 22-year-old's first season in Spain has been disrupted by injuries. However, he has managed 12 goals in 28 appearances to date and was involved as a substitute as Barca beat Manchester City 2-0 in the first leg of their Champions League last 16 tie on Tuesday. Barcelona are ahead of their fierce rivals Real Madrid in the Spanish league on goal difference but tied on points with Real and Atletico Madrid."

The club's former president Sandro Rosell resigned last month over the judicial wrangle sparked by Neymar's signing, which the club said cost 57.1 million euros. The case was started by one of Barca's own members, Jordi Cases. He accused Rosell of misappropriation for not declaring publicly that 40 million of the 57.1 million figure quoted by Barca was paid to N&amp;N, a company controlled by the player's parents.

1633,19/02/2014,05:47,Football: Pellegrini turns on ref as City lose to Barca,Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini risks a UEFA sanction after launching a scathing attack on the match referee after his side's 2-0 loss to Barcelona in the Champions League.,"Barcelona took charge of the last 16 tie thanks to a second-half penalty from Lionel Messi and a late Dani Alves strike at the Etihad Stadium in Tuesday's first leg, and Pellegrini blamed match official Jonas Eriksson for his side's defeat. In a wide-ranging attack, Pellegrini accused Eriksson of making two mistakes over the penalty decision and even questioned why a Swedish official had been given control of the game. He also said that Eriksson should not have been in charge because he had been criticised by Barcelona following his performance in their 0-0 draw at AC Milan in the quarter-finals of the 2011-12 competition. Eriksson sent off City defender Martin Demichelis for bringing down Messi in the incident that yielded the 54th-minute penalty and Pellegrini said: ""I think that the referee decided the game. ""Before the penalty there was the foul on (Jesus) Navas, when he (Eriksson) was three metres from the player, so he saw it without any problem. ""From the beginning I felt that the referee was not impartial to both teams. The penalty on Martin Demichelis was not a penalty -- it was outside the box."" Asked why he had spoken to Eriksson at the final whistle, Pellegrini replied: ""Just to tell him that he had decided the game. He must be very happy, because he decided the game."" The Chilean added: ""He didn't have any control of the game. He decided for Barcelona from the beginning until the end. ""I think it was not a good idea to put a referee from Sweden in such an important match and a referee that made such important mistakes against Barcelona (in an earlier match)."" When he was asked to explain his reservations about Eriksson's nationality, Pellegrini said: ""I think there are more important football (nations) than Sweden in Europe. ""It was a big game with two important teams. I think maybe in that kind of game, you need a referee with more experience. ""I think the best (biggest) mistake was to put a referee that damaged Barcelona in the stage of group (sic). ""This referee whistled the Barcelona-Milan game and he made an important error against Barcelona. Today he arranged (atoned for it)."" With Pellegrini preoccupied by his gripes about Eriksson's performance, it was left to captain Vincent Kompany to vow that City had not given up on the tie. ""If the tempo was in this game, it would have been to our advantage,"" he told ITV. ""If the game is the same as today, and we manage to stay away from some fouls, we have got a chance."" Barcelona manager Gerardo Martino felt that the outcome of the game was ""fair"", but he warned against complacency ahead of the second leg at Camp Nou on March 12. ""I'm not necessarily confident (about going through), but it's true that we've done a good game in the away leg,"" he said. ""We just have to repeat the same performance."" Media focus prior to the game had centred on the extent to which Barcelona have lost their mantle in the light of their 7-0 demolition by eventual champions Bayern Munich in last season's semi-finals. Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho described Martino's side ""as the worst Barcelona of many, many years"" and Barca midfielder Cesc Fabregas said that he and his team-mates were pleased to have silenced their critics. ""We had a point to prove, and we did it very well,"" he told ITV. ""Some people were talking a bit too much before the game and now they have to shut up for a few days."""

Lionel Messi was joined in attack by Cesc Fabregas and Alexis Sanchez, with Sergio Busquets, Xavi and Andres Iniesta lining up in midfield. City manager Manuel Pellegrini opted for an apparently conservative 4-4-1-1 system, with Fernandinho returning alongside Yaya Toure in central midfield after missing three matches with a muscular problem. Alvaro Negredo was fielded as a lone striker, while left-back Aleksandar Kolarov was selected on the left side of midfield.

The Catalan club have also been scarred by scandal in recent weeks, with Sandro Rosell forced to step down as president over allegations he misappropriated funds in the 57.1 million euros ($77 million) deal that brought Neymar to the club from Santos last year. While Pique accepts that the players are powerless to affect media focus on the club's dealings at boardroom level, he says that they can create positive headlines with their performances. ""The only way we have to speak is on the pitch,"" he said during a press conference on Monday ahead of his side's last 16 first leg at City. ""Maybe in the last six months, there were some things that we cannot control as players. ""All we can do is go on the pitch tomorrow (Tuesday) and show the world we can still be the best and try to play a great game against Man City with all their great players."" Asked if rival teams still feared Barcelona, the Spain international replied: ""You have to ask them. ""I think that maybe they don't fear us as before because the last two years we didn't win the Champions League, but I think they still respect us. ""We're a team with a lot of players that won the World Cup, Champions Leagues, leagues. I think we can still be the best, but we have to show to the world that we can do it."" Barcelona coach Gerardo Martino has a fully fit squad to select from, but he revealed that he will make a late decision on whether or not to include Neymar in his starting XI at the Etihad Stadium. The Brazil superstar recently spent a month on the sidelines with an ankle injury, but he made a goal-scoring return to action in Barca's 6-0 demolition of Rayo Vallecano in La Liga on Saturday. ""What's important for us is to have him healthy,"" said Martino, whose side currently lead La Liga on goal difference from Atletico Madrid and Real Madrid. ""He played 30 minutes against Rayo, but we'll decide tomorrow whether he'll start or come on later."" In City, managed by former Real Madrid coach Manuel Pellegrini, Barcelona will come up against a team who place a similar emphasis on keeping possession of the ball and aggressively pressing their opponents. Martino acknowledged the similarities between the teams and predicted that possession would be a determining factor in the outcome of the tie. ""I don't think they're a mini-Barcelona or a mini-anything -- they're one of the best teams in the world right now,"" he said. ""They have great Spanish players like Jesus Navas, who plays very vertically, and David Silva, who comes into the centre and has a great sense of tempo, but it is not only Spanish players. ""They have great players from all over the world like (Yaya) Toure and Fernandinho."" He added: ""City have a profile very similar to us. Maybe a bit more direct, but they're very good on the ball and they like to elaborate their play. ""I think the team with the least time on the ball are likely to suffer the most."""

Following a 4-1 success at Sevilla last weekend, Saturday's 6-0 demolition of Rayo Vallecano further strengthened their position at the top of the table on goal difference from Atletico Madrid and Real Madrid. The game featured a goal-scoring return from injury for Neymar, while the team's fourth goal, a dizzying passing move finished by Pedro Rodriguez, bore the hallmarks of Barcelona's Pep Guardiola-era pomp. Guardiola is now at Bayern Munich, who demolished Barca 7-0 on aggregate in last season's Champions League semi-finals, but with his old side having also booked a King's Cup final berth by overcoming Real Sociedad, belief is building at Camp Nou. ""Now the best part of the season, where all the games are important, is upon us,"" captain Carles Puyol told Barca TV. ""We played a very good game (against Rayo), as we did against Real Sociedad, and the team has plenty of confidence heading into the tie. ""We are facing a very good team with great players, but Barcelona always believe in their own chances. We are in good form and it will be a very even tie."" City could scarcely have asked for more daunting opposition in what will be their first ever knockout game in the post-1992 Champions League era, but Manuel Pellegrini's side can also take heart from their weekend result. After a run of two games without victory, the 2012 English champions produced a superb display at the Etihad to beat Chelsea 2-0 in the fifth round of the FA Cup. The victory avenged a 1-0 loss to the same side in the Premier League 12 days earlier and goal-scorer Samir Nasri believes it was ideal preparation for the visit of Barcelona. ""It is a massive game,"" said the French midfielder, who was making his first appearance after a five-week lay-off with knee ligament damage. ""Every player wants to play those kind of games -- Champions League, last 16, against Barcelona. The good thing is we are really strong. We have our confidence back. ""I think they are weaker than they were two years ago. I think it is going to be a tight game and an interesting game for everyone."" Nasri will hope that his second-half cameo against Chelsea convinces manager Pellegrini to hand him a starting berth, but he faces competition from Jesus Navas. With James Milner suspended and Fernandinho a doubt with a thigh problem, Javi Garcia is in line to partner Yaya Toure in midfield, while top scorer Sergio Aguero is expected to miss out with a knee injury. Barcelona coach Gerardo Martino has the rare luxury of a fully fit squad to choose from. Despite demonstrating his fitness in the romp against Rayo, Brazil superstar Neymar is expected to start on the bench, but Xavi is likely to come back into the side after being rested on Saturday. With Lionel Messi having amassed 10 goals in 11 games since his return to fitness in January, Pellegrini feels that reports of Barca's demise have been greatly exaggerated. ""Any coach would love to have the roster that Barca has,"" said the former Real Madrid and Malaga coach. ""Barca have 12 wonderful players. Messi, Xavi, (Andres) Iniesta, Neymar, Cesc (Fabregas), Pedro, they are full of great players. ""They have been leading the Primera Liga standings, they are alive in the Champions League, and they are in the final of the Copa del Rey."" The two teams have never previously met in a competitive fixture, but Barca provided the opposition when City opened their City of Manchester Stadium -- subsequently rechristened the Etihad Stadium -- in August 2003."

Guardiola, who won 14 trophies with Barcelona in four years at the helm, has steered Bayern 10 points clear in the Bundesliga on his first season in charge. Ter Stegen had a busy night in the Gladbach goal against Guardiola's side with Bayern firing in 24 shots. He produced a string of good saves and admitted he was pleased by Guardiola's praise as rumours of his end-of-season transfer to Barca grow stronger. ""That's great praise from a great coach. This is an honour for me and is immensely pleasing,"" he said after team training on Saturday. Born and raised in Moenchengladbach, Ter Stegen has made it clear he does not want to extend his Borussia contract which expires in June 2015. Gladbach would need to sell him at the end of the season or lose him on a free transfer. Despite the rumours linking him to Barcelona, he received warm praise from Gladbach fans against Bayern. ""The way the fans received me was world class, that's important for me,"" said Ter Stegen, who made three appearances for Germany last year.

1643,24/01/2014,20:37,"Football: Barcelona reveal Neymar deal, deny lies","Barcelona's new boss declared Friday the club had ""never lied"" as he revealed for the first time financial details of a disputed 57.1-million-euro ($78 million) signing of Brazilian star Neymar, a deal that helped to topple his predecessor.","""We never lied,"" 50-year-old club president, Josep Maria Bartomeu told his first news conference. A day after former president Sandro Rosell resigned because of a judicial wrangle over the Neymar deal, Bartomeu said the player's father had given permission for previously confidential details of the transfer to be made public. The Neymar transfer cost 57.1 million euros, plus a 2-million-euro bonus if the 21-year-old international makes the finals of the FIFA World Player of Year award, footballing business manager Raul Sanllehi told the news conference. In addition, Neymar gets an annual salary of 11.3 million euros to be paid over five years, he said. Barcelona said the Brazilian was drawn not by money but by the lure of the club and its star, Lionel Messi. ""The player decided to come to Barca with a lower offer than he could have obtained from other clubs because he was very excited to come,"" Sanllehi said. Barcelona said the entire deal cost 86.2 million euros: 57.1 million euros for the transfer, 10 million euros in a signing bonus, 2.7 million euros in commissions, 4.0 million in marketing, 2.5 million for Neymar's foundation and 9.9 million euros in scouting and collaborative deals. Barcelona's new boss said Neymar's father agreed to let the club reveal the figures because he believed the scandal over the signing was ""unfair"". ""He repeated that many people have not forgiven his son Neymar Junior for coming to Barcelona rather than going to other teams and accepting more generous offers,"" Bartomeu said. Rosell resigned Thursday, a day after a judge agreed to hear a case made against him by one of the club's own members for alleged misappropriation of funds in the deal which brought Neymar to the Camp Nou last year. Rosell had routinely insisted that Neymar cost the club 57.1 million euros but refused to divulge details on confidentiality grounds. That led club member Jordi Cases to launch the case against Rosell last month for not informing the club's members as 40 million euros of the fee was supposedly paid to Neymar family firm N&amp;N. The club were subsequently asked to submit the contracts that sealed the player's arrival in Catalonia, as well as Barca's financial accounts for the past three years. And the judge, Pablo Ruz, decided that the documentation handed over reveals ""sufficient elements"" for an investigation to go ahead. Barcelona's break down of the 57.1 million euros transfer cost showed 40 million euros went to the Neymar family firm N&amp;N, and 17.1 million euros was devoted to the transfer from Santos FC. Neymar's salary amounted to a total of 56.7 million euros over five years and was comprised of a total 10 million-euro signing bonus, a 44-million-euro salary and a commission of 2.7 million euros."
1644,23/01/2014,21:44,Football: Neymar case brings down unpopular Rosell,Sandro Rosell's three-and-a-half year term in charge of Barcelona came to an end on Thursday as he submitted his resignation as the club's president.,"The 49-year-old had come under increasing pressure in recent weeks as he faces legal action, launched by one of the club's own members, over his role in the signing of Brazilian star Neymar last year. Rosell has routinely insisted that the 21-year-old cost the club 57.1 million euros ($77 million), but refused to divulge how much money each of the parties to the deal received on confidentiality grounds. That led Jordi Cases to launch the case against Rosell last month for not informing the club's members as to where the money for the transfer had gone. The capture of Neymar was a significant political coup for Rosell. A former Nike executive in Brazil, Rosell played a key role in bringing two-time World Player of the Year Ronaldinho to the club in 2003 in his role on the board of previous president Joan Laporta. His relationship with Laporta soon broke down, though, as he left along with incoming president Josep Maria Bartomeu, who was then in charge of basketball operations at the club, following irreconcilable disagreements with Laporta in 2005. He returned to the club in 2010, succeeding Laporta by winning by the presidential elections by greatest margin in the club's history with 65.5 percent of the vote. Given his business links in Brazil, Neymar was the perfect marquee signing for Rosell and he made a move as early as November 2011 to ensure the former Santos man would end up in Catalonia by agreeing a deal with a business owned by Neymar and his father called N&amp;N to bring the player to Barcelona when his contract expired in 2014. However, as La Liga rivals Real Madrid circled around Neymar last summer, Rosell's desperation not to be outdone by Real president Florentino Perez may have significantly increased the outlay made by the club. According to the court resolution released on Wednesday, Barca paid 40 million euros to N&amp;N for breaking the previous agreement to complete the player's signing in 2014 and bringing it forward by a year. That deal flew in the face of Rosell's previous economic handling of the Spanish champions. Once elected he quickly set about reducing the club's huge debt left behind by Laporta's reign. A feat he impressively managed, reducing the debt by 100 million euros, whilst maintaining a more than competitive side on the field which won six trophies during his time in charge. However, many felt he was willing to sell the club's soul in his quest to balance the books. Under Rosell's tutelage Barcelona finally succumbed to becoming world football's last major power to have a commercial sponsor on their shirts. A bumper deal signed with Qatar Sports Investment in 2010 for 171 million euros firstly saw The Qatar Foundation replace UNICEF on the famous blaugrana shirt before Qatar Airways took over the sponsorship this season. Rosell's marketing background also helped him seal another major sponsorship deal with Intel last month. However, by prioritising the club's finances, Rosell made some unpopular decisions within the dressing room and the club's fanbase. In particular, the decision to not renew the playing contract of Eric Abidal last summer months after he had returned to action from a liver transplant was seen as lacking the warmth with which Laporta had previously built up strong relations with the club's stars. That trend followed last month when in an uncharacteristic outburst, Lionel Messi slammed Rosell's economic vice-president Javier Faus a being a man ""who knows nothing about football"" and who ""treats Barcelona like a business, which it is not."" The more popular and charismatic Laporta, who is expected to launch a bid to return as president in 2016, also joined in the cries for Rosell to explain himself to the club's fans on Wednesday. And with his credibility amongst the club's members at an all-time low, it seemed only a matter of time before Rosell finally fell on his sword."
1645,23/01/2014,21:33,Football: Barca president Rosell resigns over Neymar affair,"Barcelona president Sandro Rosell, facing legal action over the signing of Brazil star Neymar, resigned after a three-and-a-half year spell in charge of the Spanish champions on Thursday.","Pressure had mounted on Rosell, 49, after a judge agreed on Wednesday to hear a case made against him by one of the club's own members for alleged misappropriation of funds in the deal which brought Neymar to the Camp Nou last year. Sporting vice-president Josep Maria Bartomeu will replace Rosell as president for the remainder of the board's mandate, which runs until 2016. Rosell once again defended his position on the Neymar signing by describing the complaint made against him as reckless. ""From the first day I have said that the signing of Neymar was done correctly and it has provoked jealousy from some of our rivals,"" he told a press conference at the Camp Nou. ""I don't want an unjustified attack to negatively affect the image of the club and therefore I believe my time at the club has come to an end. ""I have presented my irrevocable resignation to the board."" Bartomeu will now take over and dismissed rumours earlier in the day that presidential elections could be called in June. ""My first message as the new president of Barca is to announce the continuity of our project until 2016,"" he said. ""We continue with the utmost desire and commitment to maintain the sporting, economic and social excellence of our club."" Rosell has routinely insisted that Neymar cost the club 57.1 million euros ($77 million), but refused to divulge how much money each of the parties to the deal received on confidentiality grounds. That led Jordi Cases to launch the case against Rosell last month for not informing the club's members as 40 million euros of the fee was supposedly paid to a business owned by Neymar and his father called N&amp;N. The club were subsequently asked to submit the contracts that sealed the player's arrival in Catalonia, as well as Barca's financial accounts for the past three years. And the judge, Pablo Ruz, decided that the documentation handed over reveals ""sufficient elements"" for an investigation to go ahead. On top of the 57.1 million euros attributed by the club for the signing, Barca also paid Santos 7.9 million euros for the first-option to buy three youth team players and nine million euros for playing two friendly matches, the documentation for which Ruz has also now requested. Rosell's popularity amongst the club's supporters and indeed some senior players has been on the wane for some time. His decision to cash in on a commercial sponsor on the club's shirt for the first time in its 111-year history shortly after becoming president in 2010 was decried by many as selling out on Barca's ""more than a club"" motto. More recently the failure to offer defender Eric Abidal an extension to his playing contract at the end of last season shortly after returning from a liver transplant was seen as lacking compassion with Dani Alves even changing his shirt number to the number 22 previously worn by Abidal as a tribute to the Frenchman."
1646,22/01/2014,16:48,Football: Neymar case puts spotlight on Barca president,Pressure on Barcelona president Sandro Rosell grew on Wednesday after a Spanish judge agreed to hear a case made against him by one of the club's own members for misappropriation of funds in the deal which brought Brazilian star Neymar to the club last year.,"Rosell has routinely insisted that the 21-year-old cost the club 57.1 million euros ($77 million), but refused to divulge how much money each of the parties to the deal received on confidentiality grounds.

A former Nike executive in Brazil, the 49-year-old played a key role in bringing two-time World Player of the Year Ronaldinho to the club in 2003 in his role on the board of previous president Joan Laporta. Neymar was, though, his first marquee signing since winning elections to become the president in 2010. However, his desperation to land Neymar last summer, as La Liga rivals Real Madrid considered making a move for the player, may have significantly increased the outlay made by the club. According to the court resolution, the documentation handed over by Barcelona in December shows that an agreement was signed between the club and N&amp;N in November 2011 that signified Barca's intention to sign the player in 2014, when his previous contract with Santos was due to expire. For bringing the move forward by a year, Barcelona were deemed to have broken that first contract and therefore had to pay a penalty clause of 40 million euros to the company. As recently as Monday, Rosell reiterated his stance that the deal cost 57.1 million and that he would welcome the chance to be called by the judge to give evidence in the case to clarify matters. However, Ruz insisted there was no ""urgency or necessity"" to hear Rosell's testimony until the case was more advanced. The case is merely the latest in a line of bad publicity for Rosell's board. Last month, in an uncharacteristic outburst, Lionel Messi blasted vice-president Javier Faus for ""not knowing anything about football"" after he said there was no reason to hand the Argentine a new and improved contract. Faus and Rosell have since backtracked on that stance, saying Messi deserves the best ""economic treatment"" for continuing to be, in their opinion, the best player in the world. On the field the idea to mould two of the game's most marketable stars in Messi and Neymar hasn't been a resounding success either as injuries to both players has meant they have only started together in 11 of Barca's 30 games so far this season. Meanwhile, concern has been expressed from fans that the board's proposal to remodel the Camp Nou for a massive 600 million euros, which was announced earlier this week, could see a significant increase in ticket prices."

Bartra's previous deal had been due to expire in June, which had reportedly attracted interest from a number of Premier League clubs. However, having dispelled any doubts over his future, Bartra's next target could be making it into Spain's World Cup squad. He was called up for the first time by Vicente del Bosque for the friendlies against Equatorial Guinea and South Africa in November."
1648,14/01/2014,11:16,Football: Spanish press hail Ronaldo's tears of joy,The front pages of Spain's newspapers were awash with images of a crying Cristiano Ronaldo on Tuesday after the Portuguese picked up his second Ballon d'Or in Zurich on Monday.,"Despite not winning a trophy on a collective level during 2013, Ronaldo was rewarded with football's highest individual accolade for his incredible performances last year. The Real Madrid man averaged more than a goal a game and also guided his country to this year's World Cup in Brazil. ""Cristiano moves football with his emotional reaction to winning the Ballon d'Or,"" said the front page of Madrid sports daily Marca. Fellow Madrid sports newspaper AS was more pointed as it led with ""The best won."" Inside AS the famously quirky Tomas Roncero described Ronaldo's emotional reaction to winning the prize as ""tears of gold"" and went as far as to claim his victory was like winning the Champions League for some fans. The vote had been tighter than many expected with the winner in the past four years, Barcelona's Lionel Messi, finishing just over two percent behind Ronaldo with Bayern Munich's treble-winning playmaker Franck Ribery a further one percentage point back in third. However, after being outshone by Messi in previous years, the general consensus was that Ronaldo had been a deserving winner. ""Finally his enormous perseverance was rewarded in Zurich. He clutched the highest individual recognition a footballer can receive: the longed-for Ballon d'Or,"" wrote Jaime Rodriguez in El Mundo. Meanwhile, in national broadsheet El Pais, Jose Samano, said that the 28-year-old's tears were the culmination of a year in which his public persona has been turned around. ""Little by little, Cristiano has left behind being an obstinate show-off to the point where he has reached his current peak, in which he is seen as a star footballer and, that which is even more commendable, an ever more rounded person."" Unsurprisingly, the mood was somewhat different in the Catalan press as Messi's injury plagued 2013 meant he was beaten into second place for the first time in five years. ""This time the best didn't win,"" read the front page of Barcelona daily Sport ""Cristiano wins his second Ballon d'Or, but Messi continues to lead with four."" El Mundo Deportivo similarly concentrated on looking forward to what will be a huge year in the legacy of both Ronaldo and Messi with the World Cup just six months away. Whilst ""Cristiano wins"", they wrote, Messi warns, ""I am not thinking about what I have done, I am thinking about what is to come."""

The complaint accuses Rosell of misappropriation of funds because members do not know the ""real destination"" of 40 million euros supposedly paid to Neymar family business N&amp;N, according to court documents. Barcelona were subsequently asked to deliver to the court the contracts which brought about Neymar's signing, as well as the club's accounts for the past three years. However, prosecutor Jose Perals said in a court filing on Friday that the contracts shown to the court contained conflicting details about what exactly the 40 million euros were paid for. And he also asked the judge in the case to request the contracts lodged with football's governing body FIFA, as well as those signed off by Neymar's previous club Santos. ""FC Barcelona wants to express the severity of its anger towards the report released on Friday by the prosecutor for the National Audience regarding the signing of Neymar Da Silva Santos Junior,"" the club said in a statement on Saturday. ""The decision of the prosecutor creates doubts over an impeccable operation that allowed FC Barcelona, for 57 million euros, to get a player wanted by our competitors. ""Moreover, it is lamentable that new paperwork has now been requested that will unnecessarily delay a process that we have always considered unfounded and reckless. ""Faced with the severity of these events, and despite believing in the good faith of the law, we will continue to act strongly in the defence of the honour of FC Barcelona and its president."""

And it didn't take long for the Argentine to make his mark as he slotted home from close range before registering his 16th goal of the season with a trademark solo run and finish in stoppage time. ""I had a lot of time out and I felt very good in the training sessions that I had, but playing in a competitive game in completely different,"" he told Barca TV. ""More than the goals, I feel very good physically and I have been able to play without any pain so I am obviously very happy."" After undergoing the first period of his recovery process in Barcelona, Messi travelled to Argentina to continue his recuperation in December. There will be high expectations placed upon the 26-year-old over the next seven months as he spearheads Barca's campaign to win trophies on three fronts before leading his country at the World Cup in Brazil. But after a significant period on the sidelines, he insisted he is just happy to be back playing again. ""I am very happy. I was able to spend a lot of time in my country with my family and friends and to get away from everything. ""But now I am back I am excited and desperate to have a great year. ""I want to keep achieving things, to contribute to our play, help my teammates and hopefully we can achieve our objectives. ""They will be five very tough months, but we will fight to win everything, as we always do at this club, and then I can think about the national team."" Next up for Barcelona is a crucial top of the table clash with Atletico Madrid at the Vicente Calderon on Saturday. The Catalans had always hoped that Messi would be fit to play some part in the Spanish capital, but he said it will be up to Barca coach Gerardo ""Tata"" Martino whether he starts at the weekend. ""I will speak with Tata and he is the one that will decide, but right now I don't know,"" he said. ""No one is irreplaceable. I watched the games at home and they were very impressive. Whoever plays in this squad they always respond to the challenge."" Messi did though confirm that he will definitely attend Monday's Ballon d'Or ceremony in Zurich. For the seventh consecutive year Messi will be amongst the top three for the prize that crowns the world's best player. However, he insisted that winning for a fifth consecutive year is not top of his priority list. ""I will go, as always. It is a pleasure to be amongst the top three no matter what the result is. ""For me the most important things are the titles you win as a group, but it is always a great compliment to be nominated for what the award represents."""

1660,23/12/2013,00:06,Football: Ancelotti confident of success in 2014,Real Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti insisted his side are still very much in the La Liga title race as they moved back to within five points of leaders Barcelona and Atletico Madrid with a 3-2 win away to Valencia on Sunday.,"Valencia put up a strong fight as they levelled twice through Pablo Piatti and Jeremy Mathieu to cancel out efforts from Angel di Maria and Cristiano Ronaldo. However, Jese Rodriguez struck the all-important winner 10 minutes from time to keep Madrid within sight of the leaders. ""Five points is not a small gap, but we had a lot of pressure before this game when we were eight points back so it is a very important win. ""I am satisfied with how the first-half of the season has gone and I am very excited for 2014. The team has character, quality and fights until the end. ""At the moment the table speaks for itself. Barca and Atletico are doing very well and have a five-point lead, but I am very excited for the second part of the season. It could be a very good year for Real Madrid."" It was a particularly good evening for Di Maria as he made his claim for a regular starting spot in the absence of the injured Gareth Bale with the opening goal and an assist for Ronaldo's headed second just before half-time. The Argentine international has been linked with a move away from Real after seeing his opportunities limited by Bale's arrival, but Ancelotti stressed the importance of having competition within his squad. ""Di Maria deserves to play in this team, as do many other players. I can't keep everyone happy all the time. ""It is good that when their opportunity comes that they are concentrated. Competition for places at a big club is normal and I think the players are handling the situation well."" Barcelona boss Gerardo Martino also hailed the depth of his squad as the Catalans came from 2-0 down to beat Getafe 5-2. Pedro Rodriguez hit an eight-minute hat-trick just before half-time as he ensured Barca weren't to miss the absent Neymar and Lionel Messi. The winger was also involved in both Barca's goals after the break as he crossed for Cesc Fabregas to volley home the fourth before Fabregas converted from the penalty spot after Pedro had been brought down inside the area. ""Pedro has a great eye for goal, everyone in Spain knows that,"" said Martino. ""He has a great attitude, he never gives up and he understands that he is an important player, even if he does play in an area of the field where Barcelona have other great players."" On top of the absent Neymar and Messi, Martino was also missing the injured Victor Valdes and Xavi. And despite his delight at his side's response from 2-0 down, Martino is looking forward to having all four available again come January. ""I miss the absent players when we win as well as when we lose. I prefer for them to be playing and for the other players to be giving me a headache about not playing. It's better when you have everyone available and can chose."""

""I deeply regret what is being said not only about me but about people I love such as my dad and players who are my friends,"" the Argentine international told Spanish radio station Rac1. Spanish newspaper El Mundo reported on Monday that the player's father Jorge Messi is suspected of being involved in an operation to launder Colombian drug money through charity football matches featuring Messi and some of his Barcelona teammates. ""What we do in those matches is 100 percent charitable,"" Lionel Messi said in the radio interview. Spain's police and the Interior Ministry say a Colombian promoter is suspected of laundering drug money through concerts and sporting events in Spain, South America and the United States. But they say there is no evidence of wrongdoing by Messi, his family or other players who featured in matches organised by the Colombian promoter at the centre of the affair. Barcelona's president Sandro Rosell on Thursday branded the reports an ""attack"" on Messi's family. Messi was speaking from Argentina where he is recovering from a hamstring injury that is sidelining him from the Barca squad until the new year. ""I am focussing mentally on my recovery and I am not thinking about anything else, other than getting back to the highest level of fitness possible,"" he said."

""We will be happy to deliver all documentation requested of us,"" Rosell told a news conference. ""The National Court has already asked us for the information about Neymar's contract."" Judge Pablo Ruz on Wednesday requested copies of the Neymar contract and the club's related financial records before deciding whether to proceed with the complaint against Rosell, as club president. Barcelona has said it paid a total 57 million euros to sign Neymar from Brazilian club Santos, but it declined to give full details, citing a need for confidentiality. A Barcelona club member accuses Rosell of misappropriation of funds because the members do not know the ""real destination"" of some 40 million euros supposedly paid to Neymar family business N&amp;N."
1663,19/12/2013,14:11,Football: Iniesta extends Barca contract to 2018,"Spanish international Andres Iniesta has agreed to extend his Barcelona contract until at least 2018, the club said Thursday.","""Iniesta's extension is confirmed, we have shaken on it and that is enough for us,"" Barcelona president Sandro Rosell told a news conference. The deal will probably be formalised on Monday, he said, putting an end to weeks of rumours about the emblematic player's future. The 29-year-old midfielder's contract keeps him with Barcelona until 2018, after which it can be extended annually depending on his sporting performance, Rosell said. The Barcelona boss gave no financial details but said in September Iniesta should be the second best paid player in the team, which also features four-time FIFA World Player of the Year Lionel Messi and Brazilian international Neymar. Iniesta, a product of Barcelona's youth training and reportedly sought by several major European clubs, will thus be with the club until he is at least 34. His current contract, which runs out in 2015, carries a 200-million-euro release clause."

The 26-year-old is currently in Argentina as he undergoes treatment, but has been joined in Buenos Aires by Barca sporting director Andoni Zubizarreta and club doctor Ricard Pruna. ""The fitness test and scan carried out this morning by doctor Ricard Pruna at the training facilities of the Argentine Football Federation in Buenos Aires showed good progress in Lionel Messi's injury,"" the club said in a statement. ""More tests will be carried out on Friday to set the timescale for the third part of the player's recovery process and training schedule."" Barca boss Gerardo Martino said on Tuesday that he expects Messi to be back in Barcelona on January 2. And the Catalans hope that their star man could even be fit to face Atletico Madrid in a clash between the top two sides in La Liga on January 11."
1665,16/12/2013,14:52,Football: Barca boss Martino relishing Pellegrini clash,Barcelona coach Gerardo Martino has said he is looking forward to facing fellow South American Manuel Pellegrini after his side were drawn against Manchester City in the Champions League last 16 on Monday.,"City were arguably the strongest opponent the La Liga leaders could have been paired with and sent a warning to the Catalans as they came back from 2-0 down to beat European champions Bayern Munich 3-2 last week before hammering Premier League leaders Arsenal 6-3 on Saturday. There will be plenty of familiar faces for Barcelona in the City side as David Silva, Alvaro Negredo and Sergio Aguero return to Spain, whilst Yaya Toure was part of  Barca's treble-winning side in 2009. However, having followed Pellegrini's footsteps to coach in Europe after succesful stints in South America, Martino hailed the Chilean as one of the best coaches in the world. ""I always said that Manuel's road from South America to Europe interested me. He may be one of the best coaches in the world right now, so I am happy to be going up against a side managed by him."" Martino admitted after Saturday's 2-1 win over Villarreal that he would like to cancel Christmas as his side have returned to form just in time for the Spanish winter break after Sunday's trip to Getafe. Fortunately for the four-time European champions, World Player of the Year Lionel Messi and goalkeeper Victor Valdes should have recovered from their respective injuries in time for the first-leg in Manchester on February 18. And Martino stressed the importance of being in top form come February. ""On the face of it they are a very strong opponent with very good players, but I also think that form will have a big part to play. ""I don't know if we will be favourites against City. However, what I do know is that Barcelona has to try and win all the competitions they play in and when you try to win all the competitions you obviously have difficult opponents to overcome. Now we have to do that against City."" Of more immediate concern for Martino, Barca face the formality of a Copa del Rey fourth round, second-leg against third-tier Cartagena on Tuesday. With the Catalans already 4-1 in front from the first-leg, the Argentine has rested Xavi Hernandez, Gerard Pique and Sergio Busquets from his 16-man squad."

However, he has only featured four times in the last three months and has been usurped by 22-year-old Marc Bartra in coach Gerardo Martino's pecking order. According to the report, Puyol has communicated his intention to retire at the end of the season to fellow players and staff at the club should he not feel an improvement in his fitness in the coming months. However, the paper also claim that the Spanish international hasn't ruled out the possibility of a move to Qatar or the United States to end his playing days. Puyol is one of Barcelona's most decorated players of all-time with three Champions League and six La Liga titles to his name. He is also one of just eight men to have represented Spain 100 times and was a key part of the side that won the European Championships in 2008 and the World Cup in 2010."

Barcelona are a very good side but we're better than that. I'm angry and disappointed."" Despite being already assured of a place in the last 16, Barca boss Gerardo Martino sent out the message that he didn't want a repeat of the lacklustre performance that saw his side beaten 2-1 by Ajax in their last Champions League outing as he named a strong side. Barca were in front after just seven minutes as Pique coolly volleyed home his second goal of the season. The La Liga leaders continued to swarm forward with ease as the half progressed and the only surprise was that it took until the 39th minute for them to double their advantage as Neymar skipped past Ambrose on the right side of the area before squaring for Pedro to slot home. Neymar then scored his first Champions League goal just before the break as a lovely move involving Sanchez, Sergi Roberto and Martin Montoya found the later in behind the Celtic defence and he rolled the ball into Neymar's path to slot into an unguarded net. The flurry of goals continued after the restart as Neymar got his second of the evening just three minutes into the second period with a precise finish into the top corner from 20 yards. And the 21-year-old then embarrassed Ambrose once more as he nutmegged the Nigerian before rolling the ball past a helpless Forster. Neymar ought to have had his fourth of the night 26 minutes from time when he rounded Forster only for Pedro to take the ball off his teammate and fire the ball of Van Dijk with the whole goal to aim at.

After that match Everton boss Roberto Martinez hinted that the Spanish under-21 international could be allowed to spend another season on loan should he be surplus to requirements at Barcelona. However, whilst Martino insisted he had been tracking Deulofeu's progress, he said it was too early to say where he would be playing his football next season. ""He is showing the quality he has as a footballer and Barcelona obviously have an obligation to keep an eye on those players that are loaned out. ""If you ask me do I think he is a great player I would say yes, but there is no decision yet with respect to the players on loan (for next season.)"" Of more immediate concern to Martino is his side's Champions League clash with Celtic at the Camp Nou on Wednesday. Barca need just a point to be guaranteed of finishing top of Group H, whilst the Scottish champions cannot even qualify for the knockout stages of the Europa League. However, Martino doesn't want another slack European performance like the one his side produced in losing 2-1 to Ajax two weeks ago. ""We need to finish first in the group and we need a good performance tomorrow. For us all the games are have consequences, much more negative consequences than positive ones. ""The situation is the similar to the one we had before the Ajax match and as we saw that game had a lot of negative reaction so we have to be attentive. ""I imagine it will be a game where we have a lot of possession 30 metres from the Celtic goal so we have to be precise and quick in our movement of the ball and try to prevent them from counter-attacking."" Xavi Hernandez and Andres Iniesta return to Martino's 20-man squad having been left out of Friday's 4-1 win over Cartagena in the Copa de Rey.

The banner was quickly removed by officials before the press conference continued. Gazprom is an official sponsor of the Champions League and it is not the first time Greenpeace has launched a protest of this type this season. In October Swiss club FC Basel were fined 30,000 euros when four activists abseiled from the stadium roof to unfurl a banner saying ""Don't foul the Arctic,"" during their Champions League match against Schalke. Once the press conference restarted, though, normal service was resumed as Pepe backed teammate and compatriot Cristiano Ronaldo to win the Ballon d'Or for the second time. Ronaldo was named as a finalist for the award along with Barcelona's Lionel Messi and Franck Ribery of Bayern Munich on Monday. And despite the fact Real failed to win a trophy this year, Pepe believes the award should reward individual rather than collective achievement. ""I think the one that deserves it is Cristiano,"" he said. ""It is an individual award and this year Cristiano has had an amazing season. ""For example, Spain won the World Cup in 2010 and a Spanish player didn't win it and there are many other examples."" Ancelotti, meanwhile, confirmed Ronaldo will return to face the Danish champions on Tuesday after missing the last three games through injury and suspension. Real have already secured their place in the last 16 as group winners, but the Italian is determined the end of the group on a high and said he will name his strongest available side. That means Gareth Bale will also return having missed Saturday's 0-0 draw away to lower league Olimpic Xativa in the Copa del Rey due to the flu. ""Bale has recovered. He had a little problem on Friday night but he will be completely fine to play tomorrow,"" said Ancelotti. ""Xabi (Alonso) is also available to play and I am going to play the best team possible."" Copenhagen cannot make the knockout rounds of the Champions League due to their inferior head-to-head results against other Group B rivals Juventus and Galatasaray. However, they can still make the Europa League with a win and Ancelotti is sure Stale Solbakken's men will be desperate to land a famous victory and with it guaranteed European football in the New Year. ""Copenhagen will be a different team to the one that played in Madrid and one desperate to qualify for the Europa League. ""For us it is not an easy game, but we want to finish the group well and win the game."""

Television production giant Mediapro was fined 6.5 million euros, while Real Madrid were ordered to pay 3.9 million euros and Barcelona 3.6 million euros. The regulator also fined Sevilla 900,000 euros and Racing Santander 30,000 euros. It said the clubs all signed four-year contracts with Mediapro to broadcast their domestic league and cup matches, when the maximum duration of such a deal was limited to three years by competition law. Current joint league-leaders Barcelona said they would appeal the ruling at Spain's National Court. They have two months to do so. The club said in a statement late Monday that the contract it signed with Mediapro respected the law and ""has not practically affected the audiovisual market"". ""Before presenting its appeal, the club will have to pay the penalty or underwrite the amount, which will have an economic impact on it this season,"" the Barcelona statement added. However ""a favourable resolution in future court proceedings will involve the money being paid back"" to the club, it added. According to a table put together by the consultancy firm Deloitte, Real Madrid became the first sports club in the world to earn more than 500 million euros in 2011-12. Barcelona were named as the world's second richest club on the same list with income of 483 million euros. Unlike in other European countries, there is no collective television rights deal for clubs in Spain. Instead, clubs negotiate their own deals with broadcasters, a situation that allows Barcelona and Real Madrid to earn vastly superior sums compared to the rest of the country. Spanish football was for years marred by a television rights war. A number of clubs struck deals with Mediapro while others entered into partnership with Sogecable, part of Spain's biggest media group Prisa, the owners of the subscription channel Canal+."

It is expected that Messi will return to Barcelona at the beginning of the new year with the Catalans hopeful he will be fit to face high-flying Atletico Madrid on January 12. The Spanish champions have generally coped well without their injured superstar as they lead La Liga by three points from Atletico and have qualified for the last 16 of the Champions League. However, they slipped to their first defeat of the campaign in all competitions on Tuesday as they produced a dismal display in losing 2-1 away to 10-man Ajax in the Champions League."

However, Barca were back in the game minutes after the restart as Joel Veltman was sent off for bringing down Neymar inside the area and Xavi converted the resulting spot-kick. Barca then pressed for an equaliser, but failed to breakdown a stubborn Ajax backline as they slipped to a first defeat in any competition this season. AC Milan's 3-0 win away to Celtic in the other game in Group H means the Dutch side remain third, a point behind Milan, and will need to win in Italy when the two sides meet in two weeks' time to progress. ""It was the worst first-half that we have played. It was horrible and there is no excuse,"" Barca defender Gerard Pique told TV3. ""In the second, with a player more, we couldn't create danger. We need to improve and reflect a lot. Barcelona cannot show this image of itself."" Ajax boss Frank de Boer, however, argued the result had more to do with his side's style of play than Barca having an off day. ""We played a good match. They are not used to being under so much pressure as we created in the first-half, nor a team that builds from the back,"" he said. ""We deserved to be 2-0 ahead at half-time. The (penalty) decision was key because it is a red card and a goal, but we fought hard."" And De Boer believes a repeat performance at the San Siro on December 11 could see his side into the last 16. ""It will be a difficult game. We need to play as we did today and, if we do, then we will have a great chance to go through."" Despite injuries to a series of key players, including Lionel Messi, and having already qualified for the knockout stages, Barca boss Gerardo Martino still named a strong side. However, the Catalans were forced back from the off by a young Ajax side full of energy and quality on the ball. Jose Manuel Pinto got down well to his left to save Viktor Fischer's effort after 11 minutes, but there was nothing the stand-in 'keeper could do to prevent Serero opening the scoring eight minutes later as he turned home Ricardo Van Rhijn's low cross.

However, Barca were back in the game minutes after the restart as Joel Veltman was sent off for bringing down Neymar inside the area and Xavi converted the resulting spot-kick. Barca then pressed for an equaliser, but failed to breakdown a stubborn Ajax backline as they slipped to a first defeat in any competition this season. AC Milan's 3-0 win away to Celtic in the other game in Group H means the Dutch side remain third, a point behind Milan, and will need to win in Italy when the two sides meet in two weeks' time to progress. ""It was the worst first-half that we have played. It was horrible and there is no excuse,"" Barca defender Gerard Pique told TV3. ""In the second, with a player more, we couldn't create danger. We need to improve and reflect a lot. Barcelona cannot show this image of itself.""

However, the Catalans were forced back from the off by a young Ajax side full of energy and quality on the ball.

We won't go there,"" Rummenigge told German Sky Sports. ""Barcelona's president Sandro Rosell is an old friend and I know they would never sell Messi. He is a saint at Barcelona. ""And I think it would be in Messi's best interest to stay at Barcelona. He fits in perfectly there."" Rumours of a Bayern bid for Messi, which would see the Argentinian link up with his former Barcelona coach Pep Guardiola, have been circulating in Germany. The Bavarians could probably afford the enormous sum. A fortnight ago Bayern revealed they had posted a record 432.8 million euros in sales during last season's campaign. They became the first German club to claim the treble when they won the Champions League, a 23rd German championship and the DFB Cup. But even Bayern coach Guardiola has said his former protege is at the right club. ""Would I sign Messi? No, no! Barcelona is the best place for him,"" Guardiola is reported to have said. Bayern won 3-0 at German rivals Borussia Dortmund on Saturday, in a repeat of May's Champions League final, and are four points clear in the Bundesliga having already reached the knock-out phase in Europe."

1680,22/11/2013,14:24,Football: Barcelona injuries not an excuse for Martino,Barcelona coach Gerardo Martino has said his side's growing injury list should not serve as an excuse if they fail to keep their 100 percent home league record going against Granada on Saturday.,"The Catalans will be without World Player of the Year Lionel Messi for the first time since he tore his left hamstring, and they were dealt another huge blow when goalkeeper Victor Valdes was ruled out for the rest of the year with a calf injury in midweek. Dani Alves, Xavi Hernandez and long-term absentee Jordi Alba are also missing from Martino's threadbare squad, but the Argentine believes those coming in should have enough quality to solidify Barca's place at the top of La Liga. ""It is a difficult game for what Granada represent and what they are doing away from home this season,"" he said. ""They have had a lot of good away results and I think that is where the primary difficulty comes from. ""The situation with the injuries is what it is. I think they serve only to be excuses and we should never allow them to take away from an upcoming game. ""I don't want to undermine the importance of those that are missing, nor the merit of those that will come in, but ever since I arrived here I have spoken about the quality of our squad so I don't see why we should be weaker. ""We are without the best player in the world and the best goalkeeper in the world, but we have good replacements."" The sheer number of muscular injuries in particular suffered by Barcelona players so far this season has led many to question the physical preparation of the squad during pre-season. However, Martino insisted that at the moment there is no plans to make any significant changes to his side's training regime. ""The serious injuries we have suffered have been those to Jordi, Leo and Victor. There have been other minor muscular injuries, but, generally, there is no concern at the moment. If we have a much greater number then it is something we would have to look at."" On top of those absent through injury, Martino's task of picking his side for the visit of Granada is further complicated by the fact many of those in the squad have just arrived back from long journeys with their national sides. The former Paraguay boss admitted that he will bear in mind the number of kilometres some of his troops have travelled in recent days, but that his normal rotation policy has been hampered by the number of injuries. ""We will have the journeys in mind but we cannot be as precise in rotating as in other situations because we don't have more players."" The one piece of good news for Martino is that Gerard Pique and Cesc Fabregas have both been passed fit to feature after sitting out Spain's trip to Africa, whilst youngsters Adama Traore and Jean Marie Dongou are also included to bolster the 18-man squad."

""The tests carried out on Thursday morning have confirmed that Dani Alves has a small muscle tear in his right calf. The approximate time out will be seven to 10 days,"" said a statement on the club's website. Alves' absence means that the Catalans will be without at least six first-team regulars at the weekend. Lionel Messi and Victor Valdes have both been ruled out for the rest of the year due to hamstring and calf injuries respectively. Gerard Pique, Cesc Fabregas and Jordi Alba are also sidelined, whilst Xavi Hernandez is a doubt with a hamstring strain."

""I don't know if Cristiano Ronaldo is at his peak but he is always there scoring goals in all the games and taking part in his club and national side,"" Messi told Spanish sports daily Marca and other European sports journalists. ""He has been doing that for many years and whether he is at his peak or a bit less makes no difference."" The 28-year-old Ronaldo is emerging as the favourite to pick up this year's Ballon d'Or for the world's best player over four-time winner Messi. Ronaldo scored a hat-trick on Tuesday as Portugal beat Sweden to qualify for their fourth straight World Cup finals and he tops the Spanish league scoreboard so far this season with 16 goals in 13 matches. Messi has 11 goals from eight games in the league this season but has been sidelined for up to eight weeks with a muscle tear in his left hamstring muscle, his third leg injury this season. Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy, a Real Madrid fan, told public radio he would back Ronaldo for the Ballon d'Or award if he had a vote. ""I think he is in impressive form. He is a player who gives everything, who makes an all-out effort. Yes, I would vote for him,"" Rajoy said. The Portuguese's chances seemed to rise even further when FIFA announced this week a two-week extension to the voting deadline until November 29, citing a weak turnout, and allowing participants to change ballots already cast. Catalan sports newspapers, which traditionally back Barcelona, cried foul over the FIFA decision, which comes as Ronaldo hits top form and Messi is injured. Messi brushed off comments in the media about the injuries he has picked up this season, following some criticism that he should have paced himself better. ""What they say about the injury did not worry me and does not worry me because I am used to people talking and saying many things not only about the injury but about pretty much everything,"" he said. ""I am sorry I cannot help my team-mates now but it is an injury that heals normally and I will be back next year keen to get started."" The Argentine international said there was no chance of his leaving Barcelona despite suggestions that some clubs would be ready to write a blank cheque to sign him. ""My intention is to stay with Barcelona for good,"" Messi said. ""I am grateful if what they say is true and there are people interested. It makes you proud that they say such things. But my life is with Barcelona."" Despite picking up four World Player of the Year awards, three Golden Boots, and with Barcelona a string of Liga, Copa del Rey and Champions League victories, Messi said he still dreamed of winning the World Cup with Argentina. ""I have had the fortune of winning all the individual and club awards. Getting the World Cup would be a dream for me, for my team-mates and for a whole country that has not won in a long time,"" he said. Argentina have big hopes, Messi said. ""We aim to arrive in top form to win the World Cup, which is the dream for the whole of Argentina,"" he said. Asked about Argentina's biggest rivals, Messi said Brazil, Germany and Spain were widely seen as World Cup favourites, ""and then there is always a surprise team that appears"". For the Champions League, Messi said he saw Real Madrid and Bayern Munich as Barcelona's most serious challengers."

""I am a Real Madrid fan, I have always been a Madrid fan. If I had to vote I would vote for Ronaldo,"" the Spanish leader said in an interview with public radio. Ronaldo is emerging as the favourite to pick up this year's Ballon d'Or for the world's best player over four-time winner Messi. He scored his fifth hat-trick of the season on Tuesday as Portugal beat Sweden to qualify for their fourth straight World Cup finals to take his tally to 13 goals in his last six games for club and country. ""He scored three goals in Sweden. And I think he is in impressive form. He is a player who gives everything, who makes an all-out effort. Yes, I would vote for him,"" Rajoy said.

Catalan sports newspapers, which traditionally back Barcelona, cried foul over the FIFA decision, which comes as Ronaldo hits top form and Messi is sidelined for up to eight weeks with a torn hamstring muscle.

Medical tests in Barcelona on Wednesday confirmed that Valdes had a torn right calf, the club said in a statement. ""The approximate time off is about six weeks,"" Barcelona said. Valdes injured himself while he was striding backwards towards the goalmouth during Spain's loss in Johannesburg on Tuesday, a deflating return to the site of their 2010 World Cup victory. Spain's national squad medical services had already diagnosed a torn calf. But further tests were needed to decide how long he would need to recover. Valdes, who has been in great form, has revealed plans to leave the Spanish champions when his current contract expires in 2014. During his recovery, Valdes will likely be replaced at his club by veteran Jose Manuel Pinto. Barcelona announced this month that the 26-year-old Messi would be sidelined for six to eight weeks with a muscle tear in his left hamstring muscle, his third leg injury this season. Picking up his third Golden Shoe award on Wednesday as the top league scorer in Europe for his 46 goals in the 2012-2013 season, Messi said he was ""getting better little by little and luckily there is no more pain"". As for his return to action, ""it all depends on how things go. I will be back, but I will not put a date on when,"" he added. ""My aim is to come back and strengthen my whole body so that nothing goes wrong and I can play without worrying."" Adding to Barcelona coach Gerardo Martino's headaches, Cristian Tello, who sprained his right ankle, and Xavi Hernandez, with a strained muscle in his right leg, have both been declared doubtful for Saturday's match against Granada in the Camp Nou."
1686,12/11/2013,20:36,Football: Barcelona extends UNICEF partnership until 2016,Barcelona said Tuesday it has extended to 2016 its agreement to donate 1.5 million euros a year to joint projects with UNICEF and display the UN children's aid fund's logo on its jerseys.,"The existing agreement was set to expire next year but the club's directors approved a two-year extension at a board meeting on Monday, the Spanish league leaders said in a statement. ""We are very satisfied with this alliance,"" the club's secretary, Toni Freixa, said in the statement. Barcelona and UNICEF joined forces in 2006 and its Argentine star, four-time World Player of the Year Lionel Messi, is one of the organisation's global goodwill ambassadors. UNICEF's logo used to appear on the front of Barcelona's jersey, making it one of the few clubs not to feature a corporate logo. But after the Catalan side agreed a sponsorship deal with Qatar Sports Investment worth 30 million euros ($40 million) per season the UNICEF logo was relegated to the back of the jersey and the front now feature the name of airline Qatar Airways. The joint projects carried out by Barcelona and UNICEF involve the promotion of education and sport among vulnerable children. During the 2012/13 season the two sides carried out joint projects in Brazil, China, Ghana and South Africa. Barcelona said the work it has done with UNICEF has helped improve the lives of over 200,000 children."
1687,10/11/2013,23:52,Football: Barcelona waiting game over new Messi injury,Barcelona boss Gerardo Martino said he will have to wait to see how serious Lionel Messi's latest hamstring injury is after the Argentine limped off after just 20 minutes of Barca's 4-1 win over Real Betis on Sunday.,"It was the third time this season that Messi has been forced off with a muscular problem, following hamstring and thigh injuries earlier in the campaign. However, Martino insisted the four-time World Player of the Year's injury troubles were not related as it is his left hamstring that forced him to be replaced in Seville, whilst his previous injuries this season had been in his right leg. ""The injury to Messi doesn't have anything to do with the previous ones because it is in the other leg. ""I don't know anything about medicine so I will wait to see what the doctors say to me about how serious the injury is. ""We also need to speak with Leo, it is the third episode he has had in a short time so it is obviously playing on his mind."" Despite losing Messi with the score still at 0-0, Barca cruised to victory as two goals in two minutes from Neymar and Pedro Rodriguez put them 2-0 up at the break. Cesc Fabregas then scored twice after the interval before Jorge Molina's stoppage time penalty salvaged some pride for the hosts. And Martino was clear Messi's absence can never be used as an excuse for Barca to not perform. ""We have the best player in the world, but we also have four or five of the next six or seven best players in the world. ""Therefore, as a coach, the absence of Messi should never be used as an excuse for not winning."" There was more worrying news for Barca on the injury front as Fabregas also limped off after appearing to injure his knee whilst scoring his second of the night. However, the midfielder is still hopeful that he will be fit to travel with Spain for their upcoming friendlies away to Equatorial Guinea and South Africa. ""It won't be serious, it was just a little problem that was bothering me. ""I had an injury in the same area in the past and I was out for three months so I didn't want to force it and it was better to rest in the final 15 minutes."" Meanwhile, Fabregas added that he understood Messi's frustration, but that it was possibly best for his teammate to sit out a couple of weeks to recover his best form. ""Messi needs to be explosive to stand out and he needs to stop for as long as it requires to be ok. ""The same thing has happened to me in the past and it is very frustrating."""
1688,10/11/2013,22:28,Football: Messi suffers new injury setback,Four-time World Player of the Year Lionel Messi had to be withdrawn due to injury for the third time this season after just 20 minutes of Barcelona's clash with Real Betis on Sunday.,"Messi pulled up as he tried to accelerate with the ball at his feet before being replaced by Andres Iniesta. ""A muscle injury in the hamstring of the left leg. More tests will be carried out on Monday to discover the exact extent of the injury,"" said a statement on the club's official Twitter account. The 26-year-old is now expected to miss Argentina's friendlies against Ecuador and Bosnia-Herzegovina later this month. Messi has suffered from a series of muscular problems since pulling a hamstring against Paris Saint-Germain back in April. He returned from that injury just 10 days later to help Barca past the French champions and into the semi-finals of the Champions League. However, his season was ended by a recurrence of the injury against Atletico Madrid in May. The Argentine was also substituted with a hamstring problem against Atletico in August and pulled up with a thigh problem in Barca's win over Almeria at the end of September. Messi has failed to score in La Liga since returning from that injury, marking his longest run without a league goal in over two years. However, he had appeared to have returned to form when he scored twice in Barca's 3-1 win over AC Milan in midweek."

Busquets will however go on international duty with the world champions and Martino explained that, with that in mind, it was better to hand him a rest and a rare starting opportunity to Alex Song. ""Sergio has played eight consecutive games, two with the national team and six with Barca,"" he said. ""The evaluation of Song is always very good. The response he has given in the three or four games he has played has been very positive."" Victory over AC Milan in midweek continued Barca's near perfect start to the season as they ensured their place in the last 16 of the Champions League. The Catalans also lead La Liga, having dropped just two points in 12 games, and ahead of a two-week international break Martino doesn't want any slip ups against a Betis side that currently sit in the relegation zone. ""Betis are dangerous because they are a good team. It doesn't matter what position they are in. Anyone who watched them play against Real Madrid in the first game of the season knows they are a good side. ""The next game is far off and if we don't win, we won't be able to work in a comfortable environment."""
1691,07/11/2013,02:20,Football: Martino knew Messi 'spark' would return,Barcelona coach Gerardo Martino has said he never doubted that Lionel Messi would soon be back amongst the goals as the Argentine struck twice to put Barcelona into the last 16 of the Champions League with a 3-1 win over AC Milan.,"Messi had failed to find the net for three consecutive games after scoring Barca's equaliser in the 1-1 draw between the sides in Italy two weeks ago. But he ended his drought on Wednesday with a first-half penalty and then took his tally to six goals in just three Champions League appearances this season with a lovely dinked finish over Christian Abbiati seven minutes from time to seal the three points. ""I always saw him in the same way. Evidently, making comments about Leo when they are negative has its risks,"" said Martino. ""He played a phenomenal game. He had spark, speed, ability in one-on-ones, everything. He is one of the few players in the world that you have to be careful with when you see him in a bad light because he can turn everything around in three days and put in a performance like today."" Victory moved Barca onto 10 points after four games, five ahead of Milan with Ajax and Celtic one and two points further back respectively. And with progress to the knockout stages assured, Martino wants to wrap up first place in the group when Barca visit Ajax in three weeks. ""To finish first is what we are looking for. Moreover, one begins to think, because there are no great surprises in the groups, that the favourites will be the group winners, but you never know who you might draw. ""What most interests us is finishing first to feel better in ourselves. More for our confidence than thinking about the future."" For Milan boss Massimiliano Allegri it was another disappointing evening as, after an awful start to their domestic campaign, the Italians slipped to their first European defeat of the season. However, he congratulated his players for staying in the game until the final 10 minutes and is still confident of progressing along with the Spanish champions come the end of the group. ""The team played a lot better in the second half and we had various opportunities to equalise if we had been a bit better with the final pass,"" he admitted. ""I have to congratulate the players because it is never easy to play against Barcelona and it hasn't harmed our chances in the Champions League."" A huge part of the reason for Milan's turnaround after the break had to do with the introduction of Mario Balotelli from the bench after he had been surprisingly left out of Allegri's starting line-up in favour of Robinho. However, Allegri defended the decision by highlighting Balotelli's lack of form and fitness so far this season. ""Mario is coming from a season in which he hasn't played very well. He has had injuries and hasn't played that many games. In the first game Robinho played very well but tonight he played less well technically. ""Balotelli is a very important player for us, but he also made a few errors in the final pass. He still has a lot to learn and we expect a lot more from him."

Group E Chelsea (ENG) v Schalke 04 (GER) Chelsea host Schalke smarting from their shock 2-0 defeat at Newcastle at the weekend, a defeat that could lead Blues boss Jose Mourinho to tinker with his line-up. After an opening loss to Basel Chelsea have got into their European stride, with impressive wins against Steaua Bucharest and at Schalke last time out. ""We are in a stable position to qualify in the Champions League but if we lose again we are in a difficult position,"" Mourinho warned. Schalke, sharing top spot with Chelsea on six points, travel to Stamford Bridge on the back of a 2-0 win over Hertha Berlin in the Bundesliga. Basel (SUI) v Steaua Bucharest (ROM) Basel came away from Bucharest with a disappointing draw a fortnight ago which left them in third and on target for a post-Christmas ticket to the Europa League. After upsetting Chelsea in their first group game though they will be anxious to bag all the points here to keep them in the running for a place in the knockout stages. Group F Borussia Dortmund (GER) v Arsenal (ENG) Dortmund ruined Arsene Wenger's 64th birthday celebrations with a 2-1 win at the Emirates a fortnight ago. Dortmund 'keeper Roman Weidenfeller is wary of a reaction, saying: ""We have irritated them with our win in London. Now they want to strike back."" The Bundesliga outfit could not be in better shape, meting out a 6-1 drubbing to Vfb Stuttgart last Friday. Arsenal, second on goal difference to Dortmund, make the trip in good heart themselves having seen off Liverpool 2-0 to pull five points clear in the Premier League. Wenger said: ""We go to Dortmund now and we were very disappointed with how we lost to them. It was a very sloppy goal when we were in control but we got a good result in Germany last season against Bayern Munich. So we have been there before and are used to the atmosphere over there and hopefully we can get a good result."" Napoli (ITA) v Marseille (FRA) Rafael Benitez's Napoli are on a three-match winning run in Serie A, and host Marseille after a 2-1 win at the Velodrome on matchday three. That's left the Italians bang in contention for a place in the knockout round, level on six points with Dortmund and Arsenal, while for pointless Marseille, who ended a five match losing run in Ligue 1 on Saturday, it's a case of win or bust. The Italians are without right back Giandomenico Mesto, who underwent knee surgery on Monday. Group G Zenit St Petersburg (RUS) v FC Porto (POR) Zenit can steal a march on Porto for the runners-up spot by beating them on Wednesday and open up a four point gap with two games remaining. The Russian side made heavy weather of beating Porto in their match a fortnight ago as the hosts played most of the match with only 10 men. Zenit, though, go into the game having seen their eight match winning streak ended at the weekend with a 1-1 draw by Amkar Perm. Porto too were held to a surprise draw, 1-1 away at unheralded Belenenses. Porto boast a good away record away against Russian sides, winning four and losing one, while Zenit have never lost at home to Portuguese clubs in five matches. Atletico Madrid (ESP) v Austria Vienna (AUT) Atletico have made light work of a weak group and can seal their place in the Last 16 -- for the first time since the 2008/09 campaign -- with victory over an Austrian team they outclassed last month in a 3-0 win. A win for Atletico would also set a new club record of four successive wins in European club football's premier competition, beating the three in the 1958/59 season. Atletico warmed up for the game with a comfortable 2-0 win at home to Athletic Bilbao on Sunday for their 11th win in 12 La Liga games. Coach Diego Simeone will be looking to his Brazilian-born striker Diego Costa to inflict more pain on their opponents after he scored a double against them in the first match. ""It's not just his goals, in his participation in the play and the connection he has with the other players he makes the team better,"" purred Simeone of his leading scorer, who has more than made up for the sale of Falcao in the close season. Group H Ajax (NED) v Celtic (SCO) Ajax need at least a point from this game if they are not to be in serious danger of missing out even on third spot and a place in the Europa League. Celtic by contrast will be seeking a repeat of the win they grabbed against the Dutch side last month which reignited hopes of qualifying for the knockout stages for the second successive season. Ajax have made their worst ever start to a CL campaign while Celtic are bidding to avoid a third successive away defeat. Celtic manager Neil Lennon says that he wants his players to take their chances otherwise it could prove very costly. His Ajax counterpart, though, Frank de Boer believes that if his young team repeat the performance they produced against Celtic in the first game they will take the points. ""If we play like that again in two weeks, then we will beat them in the Amsterdam ArenA. I really believe in that."" Barcelona (ESP) v AC Milan (ITA) Barcelona can all but seal their place in the Last 16 with victory at home to a woefully out of sorts and injury-hit Milan side. Barcelona's worries are small by comparison to the Italians, who have made their worst start to a Serie A season in over 20 years, their loss to Fiorentina at the weekend their fifth of the season already. However, coach Massimiliano Allegri appears to be benefiting from some unaccustomed patience from the club directors who have called for no one to panic. However defeat in Barcelona and a Celtic win would really heap pressure on them in the chase for the second spot. The Scottish side are yet to host them and will fancy their chances of avenging an unfortunate defeat at the San Siro."
1693,27/10/2013,02:35,Football: Neymar outshines Bale in battle of big-money buys,Gareth Bale was given his chance to shine on the biggest stage of all on Saturday as he made his El Clasico debut for Real Madrid against Barcelona on Saturday.,"However, unfortunately for the Welshman, it was another expensive import making his bow in the fixture who shone, as Neymar scored Barca's opener and then teed up Alexis Sanchez to make the game safe 12 minutes from time. Jese Rodriguez pulled a goal back for Madrid in stoppage time to make the final score 2-1, but Bale had long since departed by that point as he was replaced by Karim Benzema with half an hour remaining. ""I am very happy to score such a special goal, but above all for the three points that we achieved,"" said Neymar. ""It was very exciting to score in the game that every player wants to play in."" The contrast between the summer's blockbuster signings couldn't have been greater and merely summed up the difference in how they have adapted to La Liga in their first two months in Spain. Neymar has benefited massively from the relatively swift process that saw his 57 million euro ($78.1 million, £48.3 million) move from Santos completed before Barca had even completed last season. The Brazilian arrived to a hero's welcome in the Catalan capital on the first Monday in June before returning to his homeland to take the world, and even some of his new teammates, by storm by guiding his country to the Confederations Cup with a 3-0 win over Spain. On Saturday night, it wasn't merely that the 21-year-old outshone Bale, he was he standout player on the pitch, overshadowing the world's best in Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo. His goal may only have been his fourth in 14 appearances, but his through ball from which Sanchez finished the contest with a nonchalant lob over Lopez was already his seventh assist, making him the chief goal creator in a side boasting the talents of Andres Iniesta, Xavi and Cesc Fabregas. ""Neymar played a great game,"" Barca boss Gerardo Martino added. ""To score a goal in the Clasico creates a huge impact."" Bale, by contrast, had a much more anxious summer as he waited to see if his dream move to the world's richest club would finally come off. By the time it did, on the first day in September, his chance of a bedding-in period and pre-season with his new teammates had disappeared. It hasn't been all bad news for Bale, though. He scored his only Real goal to date on his debut against Villarreal. However, since then a series of niggling injuries have hampered his participation and he is still to play a full 90 minutes in any of his six appearances. Bale was defended by his own boss Carlo Ancelotti after the game, the Italian making the wholly reasonable argument that he will need time on the field to adjust to the demands required of him at the Spanish giants. However, patience is not a virtue normally associated with matters at Madrid. Given the size of his vast transfer fee, the fact that Madrid are now six points behind Barca in the title race and that it is their new star who is setting the league alight, time is ticking for Bale to show the form that made him the Premier League Player of the Year last season."
1694,26/10/2013,21:50,Football: Ancelotti backs beleaguered Bale,Real Madrid boss Carlo Ancelotti has backed Gareth Bale to come good despite another insipid performance from the Welshman in the 2-1 defeat by Barcelona on Saturday night.,"Bale was handed just his second start since joining Los Blancos for 91 million euros ($125.5 million, £77.6 million) last month, but failed to make an impact on the game before being replaced by Karim Benzema after an hour. The 24-year-old occupied a variety of positions across the frontline during his time on the field, but Ancelotti explained that his starting position in the centre of the pitch was merely a defensive tactic to pressure Sergio Busquets before moving into wide areas when Madrid had the ball. ""They are his first games and he needs to learn the combinations with the other players. ""He played a good game, he worked hard for the team."" ""He didn't change positions from the wing to the centre a lot. He just looked to pressure Busquets when they had the ball and then play on the wing where there was more space."" Goals either side of half-time from Neymar and Alexis Sanchez were enough to hand Barca victory as Jese Rodriguez's reply for Madrid in stoppage time was merely a late consolation. However, Ancelotti was convinced his side should have been awarded a penalty with the score at 1-0 when Cristiano Ronaldo appeared to have been caught by Javier Mascherano inside the area. ""Naturally the penalty seems very clear to me. Everyone has seen it apart from the referee who didn't,"" he said. ""The second-half was very good. We pressured more and played more. We controlled the game and had good opportunities to score."" Ancelotti did, though, play down suggestions that Madrid could also have been awarded a penalty in the first-half for a handball against Adriano, who was already on a yellow card at the time. ""That decision is much more difficult. It was very fast and at that stage of the game it is a difficult decision to make as if he gives the penalty there may be a card as well."" Barca boss Gerardo Martino refused to get involved in the debate over the performance of the referee, but hailed his side's display in the first half as a throwback to the wonderful football they produced at times under Pep Guardiola and Tito Vilanova. ""I think generally the whole team produced a great performance in the first half. ""That was the Barca we are used to seeing, but afterwards it wasn't the same and we had to make changes. ""During 20 minutes in the second half I could see that we were too deep and giving the initiative to Madrid. We made changes to modify this and after that we counter-attacked better and had more control in the final 15 minutes."" Even in the first period. however, Lionel Messi wasn't able to dictate his usual influence on the game as he started wide on the right. ""His performance was like the rest of the team, he started very well and then dipped a bit. Apart from the defence and the great game that (Victor) Valdes played, I would evaluate everyone else as a collective. ""Messi has played many times where he played today. He worked very hard and I would give him great credit. If he, like the other big players, is able to do this then things will go well."" Victory moves Barca six points ahead of Madrid, but Martino is wary of talking up his side's advantage with just 10 games of the season gone. ""It counts more for our confidence than mathematically. There is still 70 percent of the league to go, both Madrid and Atletico are still close and they can make up that gap."""
1695,25/10/2013,02:16,Football: New faces add fresh twist to Clasico showdown,"With the world's biggest stars and two richest clubs on show, it is no surprise that when Barcelona and Real Madrid meet the world stops to take notice.","In recent years though the fixture has become less of a treat with 17 meetings between the two in the past three seasons alone. However, on the brink of their first clash this season on Saturday there is an excitement and freshness brought by the addition of new cast members to the drama that El Clasico almost never fails to deliver. The protagonists remain the same. Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo have dominated this fixture as they have practically all others since the Portuguese joined the four-time World Player of the Year in Spain four years ago. Should Messi find the net at the Camp Nou on Saturday he would surpass Madrid legend and honorary president Alfredo di Stefano as the all-time leading scorer in meetings between the two. Ronaldo, meanwhile, is soon catching up with Messi having scored seven times in the last six Clasicos in which he has started. However, both sides have plumped their hopes on a second superstar to supplement the undoubted best two players in the world. The manner in which Neymar and Gareth Bale arrived at Barca and Madrid respectively has so far marked their impact since arriving in Spain. Barcelona wisely got their business done early with Neymar signed before last season had even finished. The Brazilian then went on to shine for his country at the Confederations Cup and arrived in the Catalan capital for the new season full of confidence. Indeed, Neymar has already helped lift some of the pressure on Messi with three goals and six assists in just nine starts. Bale, by contrast, had to wait until transfer deadline day to be presented at the Santiago Bernabeu and has paid for his lack of a pre-season with a series of niggling muscle injuries that have hampered his participation so far. The Welshman has played just 170 minutes across five appearances, starting and scoring just the once. Despite a completely ineffective cameo appearance as a substitute in Real's 2-1 win over Juventus on Wednesday, Madrid boss Carlo Ancelotti insisted that Bale is now ready to start a match following a thigh problem. The Camp Nou match is also a big test for Ancelotti and Barca boss Gerardo Martino as they too face up to their first taste of the unique pressures a Clasico brings. Ancelotti brings a far greater wealth of experience having managed in Italy, England and France, but it was Martino who has made the better start to his first job in European football as Barcelona currently lead Madrid by three points atop La Liga. The departures of Pep Guardiola and Jose Mourinho may have stolen some of the star dust away from the touchline, but the new men in charge have embarked upon an intriguing process of evolving the style of their sides. Martino wants a more direct Barcelona, not so obsessed with tiki-taka football, whilst Ancelotti has tried quite the opposite in turning Madrid from a supreme counter-attacking outfit into a more possession based side. Whilst both have enjoyed a relatively easy ride from press and fans alike in their first few months, the lack of criticism has been conditioned by good results. Madrid's derby defeat to Atletico Madrid -- the only game either has lost this season -- was met with a barrage of questions over Real's late sale of Mesut Ozil in the transfer window, supposedly with Ancelotti's blessing. Meanwhile, Martino has found out that even winning isn't always enough in Catalonia as his changes were criticised after Barca failed to have more possession than the opposition for the first time in five years against Rayo Vallecano last month, despite the fact Barca won the game 4-0."
1696,23/10/2013,14:42,Football: Neymar desperate for Clasico debut,Barcelona forward Neymar is eagerly anticipating his first experience of an El Clasico clash against Real Madrid when the two Spanish giants square off on Saturday.,"The Brazilian has made a significant impact since joining the Catalans for 57 million euros ($78.1 million, £48.3 million) from Santos back in June, scoring three times as Barca have started the season unbeaten to lead Madrid by three points at the top of La Liga. And the 21-year-old admits it is for this type of game that he swapped Brazil for Barcelona. ""A Clasico is the most important game for any player,"" he told Barca TV. ""It is the game that every player wants to participate in and show their best football. This will be my first one and I want to make a great debut, preferably with a victory."" Much has been made of some the rough treatment Neymar has received from opposing defenders, particularly as Barca dropped their first points of the season in a 0-0 draw with lowly Osasuna last week. However, he doesn't believe his teammates will need to give him advice on how to handle the pressures of a Clasico, nor will he feel the nerves any more than in a number of huge matches he has already experienced in his young career. ""For this game I don't think anyone has to explain anything. The players, even those who have never played in it, understand the importance of a Barcelona and Real Madrid match. ""I think the anxiety is the same for all the games. I understand that the Clasico is given a lot of importance, but I think to have butterflies in your stomach is the same feeling one has before any game."" Neymar will be partnered by World Player of the Year Lionel Messi in attack as Barcelona look to end a run of five Clasicos without a win. The two stars' opportunities to start together have been hampered by the Argentine's injury problems in recent weeks. However, Messi returned to the starting line up for Tuesday's 1-1 draw with AC Milan and almost inevitably was on target to register his 12th goal of the season."
1697,22/10/2013,23:00,Football: Milan salvage draw against dominant Barca,AC Milan survived a dominant second-half display by Barcelona to deprive the Spanish giants of their third successive Champions League Group H win in a pulsating 1-1 draw at the San Siro on Tuesday.,"The draw leaves Barcelona top on seven points with Milan in second on five while Celtic are third with three having beaten Ajax 2-1 also on Tuesday. Massimiliano Allegri's Milan side had been hit with several injuries with striker Mario Balotelli starting on the bench due to a recent thigh problem. Lionel Messi had been suffering from a similar problem but started for the Spanish giants and, after levelling Robinho's ninth-minute opener for the Rossoneri in the 23rd minute proved a thorn in Milan's side all night. Barcelona started sluggishly and Marco Amelia, replacing the injured Christian Abbiati in the Milan goal, had had little to do early on. Moments after the 'keeper's first touch, Robinho gave Milan a deserved lead. The Brazilian won possession from Gerard Pique after a mix-up with Javier Mascherano and held off the big defender to slip the ball to Kaka, whose return ball found Robinho six yards out and free to fire the ball past Victor Valdes. Barcelona's first real chance came from a free kick on 18 minutes after Dani Alves's cross from the right was handled by Kaka but Messi's curling effort was wide of target. Messi edged closer with a shot across goal which forced Amelia down low, but the Argentinian made no mistake when Milan made their own blunder in midfield. An overhit pass gave Andres Iniesta possession and after he threaded a long ball through Messi deftly skipped half-challenges by Phillipe Mexes and Kevin Constant to shoot low inside Amelia's left-hand post. Mexes then sent a header just wide of the post from a corner with Valdes beaten, but the Barca 'keeper was not alone in showing some nerves. When Alves hit a cross towards the far post Amelia was left scrambling before Cristian Zapata's leg blocked out Messi's dangerous-looking first-timer. Amelia did better minutes later while blocking Sanchez's first-time effort and Zapata rescued Milan again, the Colombian sticking close to Messi as he hit a first-time shot from close in. Barely a minute later Neymar was denied what would have been a wonderful goal when he sent an angled half-volley just wide. Barcelona started the second half brighter but Robinho spurned a golden chance to put the hosts ahead when he completely missed the ball after Constant's long cross had sent him clear. Barcelona were more compact and their high pressing was causing Milan problems -- Amelia had to perform heroics to keep out Iniesta's shot from inside the area after the midfielder had been sent through. Balotelli replaced Robinho in the 64th minute and was unclucky not to get a touch on Constant's fierce drive. Barely a minute later a superb cross from Alves found Adriano deep in the area but the left-back's first-time effort curled wide of Amelia's post. Urby Emanuelson replaced the tiring Kaka with 19 minutes remaining, with Cesc Fabregas replacing Sanchez. Fabregas came close when he got his head to Messi's free kick following a foul by Muntari on Sergio Busquets but Amelia was quick to collect. Valter Birsa came off for Andrea Poli with 10 minutes remaining while Neymar was replaced by Pedro Rodriguez. The intensity of both sides evaporated in the dying minutes, however, although Muntari was left lamenting a scoring chance when he stumbled and failed to capitalise after being sent through. Barcelona kept pressing, however, and Milan survived a late scare when Mexes headed out a probing cross for a corner in the final minutes."

Messi, who has been suffering from a thigh strain, was doubtful to start after making only a late appearance for the Spanish giants in a scoreless draw against Osasuna at the weekend. Allegri will deploy a 4-3-3 formation with Brazilian Robinho in attack flanked by Kaka and Valter Birsa, the Slovenian who scored Milan's winner in a 1-0 victory over Udinese on Saturday.

However the 23-year-old striker, whose last game was for Italy in their final World Cup qualifier against Armenia last week, is on the mend and has been included in Massimiliano Allegri's match-day squad. Allegri said earlier Monday: ""We will evaluate him following training later today. He's definitely improving. In the afternoon we'll see if he's fit enough for selection or not."" Milan later announced Balotelli had come through a late fitness test and is widely expected to start on the bench. After an opening win over Celtic and a draw away to Ajax, the latter earned when Balotelli won and scored a penalty in the fourth minute of second-half injury time, Milan sit second in Group H on four points. Barcelona have won both of their opening games, at home to Ajax (4-0) and away at Celtic (1-0), but the Spanish giants have arrived in Milan days after suffering a setback in La Liga. In what may be construed as a boost for Allegri's depleted side, Gerardo Martino's team were held to a scoreless draw by Osasuna on Saturday -- the first time they had failed to score in the league since January 2012. Osasuna sit third from bottom of the Spanish top flight, and Allegri added: ""Milan are no worse than Osasuna."" However the Italian, echoing the thoughts of Brazilian playmaker Kaka - who returned from injury during Saturday's 1-0 win over Udinese - called for a disciplined, collective display to counter Barca's typically strong possession game. ""We have to stay extra focused, especially while defending because they will surely enjoy more possession against us, as they do against all the teams in the world,"" said Allegri. Barcelona will make their fourth visit to the San Siro in as many seasons, having accounted for the Italians in the group stages in 2011, in the quarter-finals in 2012 and in last season's last 16 knockout phase. Having seen his side routed 4-0 in the second leg at the Nou Camp last March, Allegri knows it will take a special performance to seal a morale-boosting win. He said: ""We can afford to go out and take an audacious approach because we're still not in the direct elimination phase. ""But to get the result we want, we all need to have the same mindset.

But in spite of welcoming Brazilian playmaker Kaka back from a month on the injury sidelines, Milan are far from being able to field their strongest side against the Catalans.

Four other first-team regulars are unavailable, including versatile defender Mattia De Sciglio. Although Kaka believes ""the team is getting stronger and stronger"", he knows the importance of a strong collective performance having re-joined Milan on a free transfer from Real Madrid. ""We need to be a solid group if we're to win.... as individuals we can't do it,"" said Kaka, who is expected to start on the bench having come on late in the second half against Udinese. Martino, meanwhile, made light of Saturday's slight setback by his side. ""I would be worried if I saw a deterioration in the performance of the team, but I didn't see that,"" said ""It is obviously a big week with firstly Milan then Madrid (next weekend), but I am not annoyed because I am happy with the performance of the team."" Tuesday's referee for the match will be Felix Brych, the German official who awarded the 'ghost goal' of Stefan Kiessling in Friday's Bundesliga match between Bayer Leverkusen and Hoffenheim."
1703,20/10/2013,11:32,"Football: Balotelli doubtful for Barcelona, says Galliani","Mario Balotelli is set to miss AC Milan's Champions League Group H clash at home to Barcelona on Tuesday, according to club vice-president Adriano Galliani.","Milan had hoped Balotelli would return from a three-game league ban against Udinese on Saturday. But after playing in Italy's final World Cup qualifier against Armenia last week the 23-year-old striker was diagnosed with a thigh problem. Balotelli was absent for Milan's precious 1-0 win at home to Udinese and although expected to recover in time for Tuesday Galliani suggested the striker could again be sidelined when Barca visit the San Siro. Goalkeeper Christian Abbiati, who picked up a knock hours before Saturday's game, is also likely to be missing. ""According to our medical staff, it will be difficult for Balotelli and Abbiati to be ready in time for Tuesday,"" Galliani was quoted as saying by Sky Sport Italia. It means Milan will be without arguably their strongest player against the Spanish giants. Although Balotelli failed to score in a 2-0 home win over Celtic, the Italian won and scored a late penalty to secure a share of the spoils in a 1-1 draw away to Ajax. Although Brazilian 'keeper Gabriel made his Serie A debut for Milan following Abbiati's late pull-out, he was not included in Milan's list of Champions League players as he was sidelined with injury at the time. It means Marco Amelia is set to step in for Abbiati on Tuesday when Barca, who on Saturday settled for a scoreless draw away to Osasuna, failing to score a league goal for the first time since January 2012, will be looking for their third group win on the trot."

News of Mueller's trip to Barcelona first broke in the Spanish media on Friday amidst reports he met with two FC Barcelona representatives last Sunday in the Spanish city. The 24-year-old scored twice in Bayern Munich's 4-1 win over Mainz 05 on Saturday to stay top of the Bundesliga and has been a regular in the Germany team since 2010. With a Bayern contract until 2017, Mueller has said he is happy in Munich. ""I didn't just sign the contract to sit it out, but because it's fun to play here,"" he said. ""Everyone who knows me, knows that Bayern is my home."" Mueller's agent also denied the transfer rumours to SID, an AFP subsidiary: ""He hasn't negotiated with anyone from Barcelona"". And Bayern coach Pep Guardiola dismissed any talk of Mueller's departure. ""I am 100 percent convinced that he'll stay, there is no chance (he'll leave),"" he said."

""I am very happy to be able to be in the squad after a number of months,"" Puyol wrote on his Facebook page. ""Thank you to everyone for your love during this time."" The news was understandably also welcomed by Barca coach Gerardo Martino with the Catalans facing seven games in the next 23 days. ""It is great news for everyone, especially for him after so long out,"" he told a press conference on Friday. ""When I name a player in the squad it is because I see them as ready to play. We will see if he plays or not, but he is ready to. ""He is very excited to be with the rest of the team and, for someone with his career, that makes me very enthusiastic."" Lionel Messi and Javier Mascherano have also been passed fit after overcoming the muscular injuries that kept them out of Argentina's final two World Cup qualifiers last week. And the return of Puyol and Mascherano is particularly important as Gerard Pique had been struggling with an adductor muscle problem he aggravated whilst on international duty with Spain. Pique has been left out of Martino's 18-man squad for the trip to Pamplona, along with Alexis Sanchez and Dani Alves, but the Argentine insisted he was merely giving the 26-year-old a break ahead of a hectic week for the Catalans. Barca travel to face AC Milan in the Champions League on Tuesday before hosting Real Madrid in the first El Clasico of the season next weekend. ""He had a problem which already affected him against Valladolid and he didn't finish the game,"" Martino said. ""Against Belarus you could see he was suffering, but after playing against Georgia he told me he was better. ""He has not been left out because he is injured, but to rest. He could have played tomorrow without any problem."" Barcelona could equal the Spanish league record with a ninth consecutive win to start the campaign with victory in Pamplona. And Martino insists they will be fully concentrated on the Osasuna clash before turning their attention to Milan and Madrid. ""For a team like Barcelona when you are left with practically five players for two weeks, the first game after the international break is very important,"" he said. ""We are completely concentrated on Osasuna, on the difficulties that they are going to create for us and after the game we can start to think of what is to come."""

The Spanish international has been back training with his teammates for a number of weeks and his return to the squad is a welcome boost for Gerardo Martino with Barca facing seven games in the next 23 days. Lionel Messi and Javier Mascherano have also been passed fit after overcoming the muscular injuries that kept them out of Argentina's final two World Cup qualifiers last week. However, Gerard Pique, Alexis Sanchez and Dani Alves have all been left out of Martino's 18-man squad for the trip to Pamplona after playing twice for their national sides in the past week."
1707,14/10/2013,22:43,Football: Messi returns to Barcelona training,World Player of the Year Lionel Messi returned to full training with his Barcelona teammates on Monday for the first time since suffering a thigh injury two weeks ago.,"The Argentine was forced off with the problem in the 2-0 win over Almeria on September 29 after scoring his 11th goal in just nine appearances this season to give his side the lead in that game. Messi stayed in Barcelona to continue his recuperation process rather than travelling to represent his country with Alejandro Sabella's men set to take on Copa America champions Uruguay in Montevideo on Tuesday. And it is expected that the 26-year-old will be fit enough to start Barca's match away to Osasuna on Saturday ahead of a big week for the Spanish champions as they travel to AC Milan in the Champions League before hosting Real Madrid on October 26. There was further good news on the injury front for Barca boss Gerardo Martino as centre-backs Carles Puyol and Javier Mascherano also took part in the training session. Puyol hasn't played since undergoing knee surgery in March, but is expected to be given the green light to return to action later this week. And Mascherano should also feature against Osasuna after recovering from a hamstring problem."

But it was a moment of madness from skipper Scott Brown that cost Celtic dearly as the midfielder was shown a straight red card in the 59th minute as he appeared to direct a sly kick at Neymar after tripping the Brazilian superstar. However, Celtic recovered well from Brown's dismissal and substitute James Forrest forced Victor Valdes into a fine save before Charlie Mulgrew headed just wide. But, moments after creating the best chance of the match, substitute Alexis Sanchez, only on the pitch for two minutes, crossed for former Arsenal man Fabregas to nod home and gain revenge for their defeat at the same venue last season. It means Barca top Group H on six points after AC Milan and Ajax finished 1-1 and handed Celtic, who prop up the group looking for their first point, a rare home defeat in the Champions League. Barcelona manager Gerardo Martino, whose side have made a 100 percent start to their season, said Celtic had been their toughest opponents to date. ""This match has been the most demanding that we have had to play so far because of the rival and the competition and Victor Valdes made very important saves for us as well,"" said Martino. ""But we managed to combine long balls with our one-touch game and that managed to make us more dynamic and unpredictable."" Celtic manager Neil Lennon felt the decision to send Brown off was soft. ""If there was any contact it was minimal. I think there was a lot more going on in the game that merited heavier punishment,"" Lennon said. ""It was a game-changing decision. Obviously it is very difficult playing against Barcelona with 11 players but with 10 it is even more difficult but we played very well tonight."" Barcelona, who were missing Lionel Messi, Javier Mascherano, Jordi Alba and Carles Puyol through injury, had opted for Neymar, Fabregas and Pedro Rodriguez up front while Celtic manager Neil Lennon retained faith in the same starting 11 that were unlucky to lose 2-0 to Milan in the San Siro a fortnight ago. Even without the injured Messi, who scored a hat-trick in their opening 4-0 win over Ajax, Barcelona showed their class early on as their slick possession football forced two early corners. However, it was a fast break from the Hoops that created the first real opportunity after just five minutes. Kris Commons played in Samaras who, from a tight angle, forced keeper Valdes to turn his shot out for a corner that Mikael Lustig headed well wide. Andres Iniesta then got sight of the Celtic goal but the influential midfielder saw his strike sail over without troubling Fraser Forster. Barca continued to ping the passes about but it took until the 41st minute for them to muster up their first real opportunity. Daniel Alves sent an inviting ball into the box from the right that Neymar prodded narrowly wide. Xavi Hernandez then tested Forster with a curling free-kick from wide on the left that the 'keeper made a meal of and was relieved to see go out for a corner after coming off his shoulder. The game changed when skipper Brown was ordered off in the 59th minute. The Celtic midfielder's sly kick at Neymar on the deck after tripping the Brazilian 25 yards out as he raced towards goal was spotted by French referee Stephane Lannoy, who had no hesitation in handing him a straight red card. Moments after coming on, Scottish international Forrest nearly had Celtic in front when his fierce half-volley was acrobatically turned over by Valdes after the 'keeper saw it late. Valdes was then caught napping at the resultant corner but Mulgrew had his head in his hands after he nodded wide of the unprotected goal. Moments after creating the best two chances of the match Celtic were caught with a sucker punch when Fabregas put Barca ahead. Alexis raced behind the Celtic defence to latch on to a Neymar pass and cross for the former Arsenal man to direct a header back across Forster and looping into the bottom corner."

The 32-year-old has played just 15 minutes of competitive action so far this season after being forced off with a rib injury early in Madrid's 6-1 win away to Galatasaray on matchday one, but has recovered in time to take his place between the posts against the Danish champions. Despite their incredible start to their European campaign, Madrid are under some pressure to bounce back from their 1-0 derby defeat to Atletico Madrid on Saturday. That result left Ancelotti's men five points behind Atletico and Barcelona in La Liga and the Italian's tactics and substitutions were heavily criticised after Real created little of note against their city rivals. However, Cristiano Ronaldo defended his new boss afterwards and said the responsibility lies with the players to perform better. ""There are new players and new ideas, but the coach is doing a phenomenal job,"" he told reporters. ""He is a great person and a great coach. This doesn't have anything to do with him, the responsibility is ours. ""I don't think we are doing so badly, we have only lost one game, but hopefully we can improve."" Gareth Bale could also make his first start as a Real player at the Bernabeu after making his home debut as a second-half substitute against Atletico. Another former Spurs player Luka Modric is expected to come back into the side after surprisingly being dropped from the start at the weekend, whilst 20-year-old striker Alvaro Morata may finally get his chance up front ahead of the off-colour Karim Benzema. Copenhagen, meanwhile, also got their campaign off to a good start by holding Italian champions Juventus to a 1-1 draw at home two weeks ago. However, veteran defender Olof Mellberg, who enjoyed two spells in Spain with Racing Santander and Villarreal, believes they will have to play even better to take anything from the game on Wednesday. ""I expect it will be an even more difficult game than the one we played against Juventus at home,"" he told Madrid sports daily AS. ""To obtain something positive we need to play extremely well, them to have a bad day and to have a bit of luck. We need everything to go our way to get a good result."""
1711,30/09/2013,21:59,Football: Fabregas challenges Barca to thrive without Messi,Cesc Fabregas has challenged his Barcelona team-mates to prove they can thrive without Lionel Messi when they face Celtic in the Champions League on Tuesday.,"Argentina forward Messi injured his thigh in the 2-0 win over Almeria on Saturday and will miss the Group H clash against the Scottish champions as a result. Former Arsenal midfielder Fabregas acknowledged losing the player widely recognised as the best in the world was a significant blow, but he is adamant a club of Barca's stature should be able to cope with his absence. ""It is a test because we always want him in our team,"" Fabregas said on Monday. ""Obviously Lionel is the best player in the world, I don't even have to say that, and you obviously will miss a player of his talent and dedication. ""We rely on him a lot. He is the best player, the one that scores more goals, the one that does the attacking tasks. He is always there for us, he gives assists, he is the best. ""He can win a game at any moment so we are sad for that but you cannot feel sorry for yourselves because you are missing a great player. ""Without Messi we will have to take more responsibility. I think we all have to step up and make sure that we don't feel his absence, and show we can play great football without him. ""When he is not there we have to adapt the situation and players like Neymar, myself if I play, Alexis Sanchez, Cristian Tello, Pedro Rodriguez; we have to step up and do the job that a striker is made for which is scoring goals and giving assists."" Barcelona coach Gerardo Martino also insisted the absence of Messi will not be used as an excuse should his side lose in Glasgow. ""Messi is the best player in the world but we have a great team and his absence cannot be an excuse if we don't get a good result tomorrow night,"" Martino said. And Fabregas believes 21-year-old Brazilian striker Neymar could be the one Barcelona player capable of one day reaching the levels of Messi. ""He is a very talented player, very quick and has the skills to get away from you easily,"" the Spain international said. ""He is already a star but this boy will have a lot to say in the future of football. ""It is up to him. Everything is in his hands. ""He came here to learn, to compete, to fight, to grow up as a player and a person. ""He is still a boy and in the future we will be talking about him as one of the greatest."""
1712,30/09/2013,18:14,Football: Lennon still fears Barca despite Messi absence,Celtic manager Neil Lennon insists his side are still heavy underdogs despite Lionel Messi's absence from Tuesday's Champions League clash against Barcelona.,"Argentina striker Messi injured his thigh in Barca's 2-0 win over Almeria on Saturday and has been ruled out for up to three weeks. Lennon, whose side lost their Group H opener 2-0 to AC Milan, admitted it is a boost for Celtic to face Barca without Messi, but he is well aware the Spanish champions remain a formidable outfit. ""It is obviously very good news for us because he is the best player in the world,"" Lennon said on Monday. ""However, it is tinged with sadness because it is always fantastic to see the great players play here in Glasgow. ""We are looking forward to the game, we welcome Barcelona with open arms and we are hoping it is going to be another great occasion."" Aside from missing Messi, the visitors head into the tie likely to be without defenders Javier Mascherano, Jordi Alba and Carles Puyol. But a cautious Lennon said: ""You say that they have defensive problems with injuries but they keep on keeping clean sheets; against Rayo Vallecano, Real Sociedad and Almeria. So, regardless of personnel, they are still defending very well. ""They are unbeaten domestically, they got off to a great start in the group (4-0 win over Ajax). They are a fantastic team. ""They will be one of the favourites to win the trophy. Whether they are better than last year, you won't be able to gauge that until the turn of the year."" Brazilian forward Neymar will be charged with leading the Barca attack in Messi's absence, but Lennon does not believe the two players can be compared. ""It is like comparing a dog with a cat. They are two different types, two different players altogether,"" he said. ""Neymar is wonderfully gifted, quick, predominantly playing on the left-hand side and he has goals in him. ""He is only young and he has a fantastic future but it is far too early to make comparisons to Messi. ""There is only one player currently who could arguably be around the calibre of Messi and that is Cristiano Ronaldo."" Lennon, whose side famously beat Barca 2-1 in Glasgow last November on their way to the last 16 of the competition, also admitted Celtic would still regard even a point against the Spaniards as a bonus regardless of the injury to their talisman. ""Our approach will be the same whether Messi plays or not,"" he added. ""Barcelona don't change their system, they don't change their style of play really and 4-3-3 is just what they believe in. It has worked well for them very well over the years. ""It would be fantastic if we could get something out of it like we did last year. ""We didn't really budget for it, as it were, in both the games last year, so if we can get something it will be a huge bonus for us. ""It will be very much at times containment; to limit Barcelona to as few chances as we can and at the same time maximise the opportunities that we get, as we did last year."""
1713,29/09/2013,13:06,Football: Messi out for two to three weeks,World Player of the Year Lionel Messi has been ruled out for up to three weeks by a thigh injury he suffered in Barcelona's 2-0 win over Almeria on Saturday.,"The Argentine had put the Catalans in front with a sublime left-footed strike from 20 yards, but had to be replaced soon after and will now definitely miss Barca's Champions League trip to Celtic in midweek as well as Saturday's home game against Valladolid. ""The tests carried out this morning have confirmed a small muscle injury in his right thigh,"" said a statement on the club's website. ""The approximated time out is two to three weeks, and therefore he will miss the meetings this week against Celtic and Valladolid."" Luckily for the Spanish champions, following next weekend's match there is a two-week break from club duties due to international commitments and Messi is expected to be fit for the trip to Osasuna on October 19. Argentina manager Alejandro Sabella has called up his captain for his side's remaining World Cup qualifiers, however with La Albiceleste having already secured their place in next year's finals, it seems likely that Messi will miss the meetings with Uruguay and Peru. Messi has been plagued by muscular problems since the end of last season. The 26-year-old suffered a hamstring injury in Barca's Champions League quarter-final against Paris Saint-Germain in April and despite briefly returning to action, he never truly recovered from the problem as he sat out the last month of the campaign. And he has also had a minor muscular injury in his left leg earlier this season that forced him off in the first-leg of the Spanish Super Cup and to miss the league trip to Malaga in August. However, he has still scored 11 times in nine matches so far as Barcelona have made their best ever start to a Spanish league season."
1714,27/09/2013,12:20,Football: Messi answers tax charges in court,Barcelona superstar Lionel Messi appeared in court Friday to answer charges of evading 4.16 million euros ($5 million) in taxes in a case that stunned the sporting world.,"Crowds of reporters and fans gathered as the 26-year-old Argentine international, four time winner of the FIFA World Player of the Year, arrived by car shortly before 11:00 am (0900 GMT). Dressed in a dark jacket and white shirt, Messi made no comment as he walked up to the entrance of the court in Gava, the coastal suburb of Barcelona where he lives, for the closed-door hearing. His father Jorge Messi, who was summoned to go before the judge ahead of the player, had arrived an hour earlier with his lawyers. The two were summoned on charges of evading tax on the player's image rights to the tune of 4.16 million euros. They have denied wrongdoing, pointing the finger at a former agent of the player. The court said Jorge Messi paid the tax authorities five million euros in August -- the 4.16 million euros claimed by the taxman plus interest -- which is likely to significantly reduce any sentence should they be found guilty. Lionel Messi's form on the field has scarcely been affected, with the Barcelona forward scoring 10 goals in just seven matches this season as the Spanish champions remain unbeaten. ""I am not worried, I'm always on the sidelines of all that, just like my dad. We have our lawyers and our advisors who handle these things. We trust in them and they will solve the issue,"" he said in July. Nor does it appear to have tarnished his image among Barcelona fans. ""What I want is for this to be resolved quickly so Messi can relax and focus on the football,"" said one fan outside the court, Joaquin Bosch, 60, wearing a Barcelona shirt. The case began in June when a prosecutor accused the Messis of evading tax by ceding the player's image rights to ""purely instrumental entities"" in Belize and Uruguay. According to the prosecutor's report, Messi ""obtained significant income"" from image rights between 2006 and 2009 on which he should have paid tax in his declarations to the Spanish authorities and failed to do so. The news caused astonishment in Spain where Messi is seen as a more humble figure than other football stars, particularly his Real Madrid rival Cristiano Ronaldo. ""He has a very professional image, of being focused on what he does and very close to the public,"" said Carles Canto, a marketing expert for IMG Consulting. Despite the initial consternation, the player's popularity doesn't appear to have diminished. ""Messi's image amongst Barcelona fans is so solid that it is very difficult for it to be clouded by this case,"" said Enric Baneres, a sports journalist for Catalan daily La Vanguardia. ""Tax evasion is something so common in Spain, like the siesta or paella, that the people are very permissive with it."" The player's defence looked set to point the finger at his former agent Rodolfo Schinocca. According to a document sent by Messi's father to the court, obtained by Catalan daily El Periodico, Schinocca was put in charge of organising the ""structure and management"" of the income from Messi's image rights. Schinocca told Spanish radio station Cope that he had nothing to do with the case because he stopped working with the Messis in 2006, before the supposed offences took place. He accused Jorge Messi of wanting an offshore account to manage the income from the image rights. While Messi's 323 goals in 387 games for Barca have made him irreplaceable on the field, his income from endorsements off it has also soared. Between 2007 and 2009 he earned more than 10.17 million euros in image rights. US magazine Forbes lists him as the 10th highest paid sportsman in the world with an annual income of $21 million from endorsements alone. Despite the court case, Messi continues to lead advertising campaigns for brands like Adidas and video games maker EA Sports. Its latest version of the immensely popular FIFA franchise was released in Spain the day before Messi was due to appear in court with his picture on the front cover."
1715,21/09/2013,23:33,Football: Martino hails 'exceptional' keeper Valdes,Barcelona boss Gerardo Martino lauded the form of goalkeeper Victor Valdes after he saved a second penalty in as many games in the Catalans' 4-0 win at Rayo Vallecano on Saturday.,"Valdes parried Roberto Trashorras' spot-kick 10 minutes before half-time when the hosts were leading just 1-0 thanks to Pedro Rodriguez's opener. Pedro went onto complete a hat-trick in the second-half with Cesc Fabregas adding a late fourth to move Barca back to the top of the table and maintain their 100 percent start to the league season. ""He is in exceptional form, he is one of the three best keepers in Spain and we can only enjoy how he is playing,"" Martino told a press conference. ""Although you don't always hope to have to enjoy watching your goalkeeper so much, he made three or four decisive saves."" The game was also remarkable for the fact that despite losing heavily for the fourth successive game, Rayo amazingly had more possession than Barcelona. It was the first time in over five years and 317 matches that Barca had enjoyed less of the ball than their opponents. However, Martino put that statistic down to Rayo's pressing rather than his insistence that his side play a more direct style. ""Sometimes it is difficult to play out from our goalkeeper and we will look for longer passes. In games like this with such intense pressure it is necessary to win the second balls. ""I liked that in the second-half, apart from the last move of the game, we weren't anxious in defence like we were against Ajax (in the Champions League in mid-week). ""The team has a great capacity to score goals and if we keep a clean sheet then we always have a chance."" And Valdes himself believes too much is being made of Barca's new direct style. ""There is too much talk about this topic. We don't have to be fixated by it,"" he said. ""We try to be faithful to our style, but we have a new coach and there might be a new idea."" Understandably the 31-year-old was happier to reflect on his own form, including a 10th career penalty save in La Liga. ""Fortunately with the penalty the ball went straight down the middle and I had stayed on my feet. ""I am satisfied with how everything is going, but the most important thing is that we are winning games. It is important to start like this and we need to continue this dynamic."""
1716,19/09/2013,02:30,"Football: Four-goal Barca can get even better, says Alves",Barcelona defender Dani Alves believes the Spanish giants can get even better as they adjust to the methods of new coach Gerardo Martino.,"The Catalans got their Champions League campaign off to the perfect start with a 4-0 thrashing of Ajax on Wednesday, thanks in large part to a hat-trick from World Player of the Year Lionel Messi. However, despite also maintaining a 100 percent record in La Liga and winning the Spanish Super Cup so far this season, Alves believes there is still plenty for the Spanish champions to improve on. ""I think it is fundamental to win as we are improving and correcting things,"" he told reporters. ""We are in a transitionary period and we are still looking for our best level. It is difficult, but we are on the right track because we are winning. ""We are introducing new things to overcome the opponents, alternating the ideas we had but still with the objective of having possession of the ball. ""Right now we know what we lack. Sometimes we are not co-ordinated when we press, our lines are too far apart, but we are improving every day."" Messi's 27th career hat-trick came just 24 hours after Cristiano Ronaldo has notched his 23rd treble in Real Madrid's 6-1 hammering of Galatasaray. The Argentine was far from the only star on show for the hosts, though, as Victor Valdes continued his stunning early season form with two smart stops in the first-half before he denied Ajax a consolation goal by saving Kolbeinn Sigthorsson's 77th minute penalty. Valdes has still not yet managed to dislodge Iker Casillas as Spain's number one despite the latter's lack of playing time at Madrid. However, Alves insisted that in his eyes Messi and Valdes are the world's best in their respective positions. ""Messi and Valdes help us a lot, that is why they are there and are the best in the world in their positions. ""On top of Messi's goals and the penalty though, I am also left with the effort of the team because we had a very strong opponent in front of us. ""In the first-half we needed to be more intelligent, if you can't press perfectly you have to drop back and organise. ""But in the second-half we improved and the coach set us up in a better manner."" It was another harrowing experience for Ajax in Spain after being on the wrong end of a number of heavy beatings from Real Madrid in recent season. However, coach Frank de Boer was pleased with how his side played in spells. ""It is a shame that in the second-half we didn't start well,"" he told a press conference. ""I am a little disappointed in the way we conceded the three goals in the second-half and to not have scored given the chances we had. ""You can never be happy with a 4-0 defeat but I saw some good things to build on in the upcoming games."""

Messi opened the scoring on 22 minutes with a sensational free-kick and made the game safe 10 minutes after half-time with a typically cool left-footed finish. Gerard Pique added a third when he headed Neymar's cross past the stranded Kenneth Vermeer before Messi rounded off the scoring 15 minutes from time. ""In the first-half we found it a bit difficult because they played well, but in the second we moved the ball much better and controlled the game,"" Messi told Canal Plus. ""In general I think we played a very good game. The more variety we have the better. There are games where we need to manage the ball, control the game, and others which are more difficult where we will need to do a bit more."" Messi also took time to lend his support to coach Gerardo Martino, who will fly back to Argentina after the game to attend his father's funeral. ""It was a special game. It is a shame what has happened and he is suffering, but we are all with him in this moment."" Martino thanked the team for their support and was happier with the balance Barca showed in contrast to their nerve-wracking 3-2 win over Sevilla at the weekend. ""This victory allows me to relax. Away from my personal situation, it is very important for the club and the team to gain confidence and start the group stage with a win at home,"" he said. ""Thanks to having more of the ball we were more stable and we pressurised them better,"" he said. ""I think we will find the variation we need, we are still just at the beginning of the season."" After a decent opening spell from the visitors, their good work was undone when Lerin Duarte unnecessarily dived in on Messi on the edge of the area and the Argentine picked himself up to fire the resulting free-kick in off the inside of the post. Victor Valdes was then forced into two smart saves from Ricardo Van Rhijn and Duarte to send the hosts in ahead at half-time However, Barca could also have extended their advantage before the interval as Messi uncharacteristically lacked precision in his finish when faced with just Vermeer to beat in first-half stoppage time, the goalkeeper making a comfortable save. It was only a matter of time before the Ajax goal was breached again, and unsurprisingly it was Messi as he received Sergio Busquets's pass, cut inside and slotted past the helpless Vermeer. The Argentine nearly had his hat-trick in bizarre circumstances seconds later as he prodded the ball towards goal with his knee from Neymar's cross, only for it to dribble inches wide. Barca were in cruise control by this stage and they did eventually get their third of the evening when Vermeer got nowhere near Neymar's in-swinging cross and Pique had the simple task of heading into an unguarded net. Messi then sealed his hat-trick with another unerring finish that arrowed into Vermeer's bottom left-hand corner from the edge of the area. And the visitors were even denied a consolation when Valdes saved Kolbeinn Sigthorsson's penalty 13 minutes from time after Javier Mascherano had upended Thurani Serero."

Despite causing little threat of their own, Ajax had managed to limit Barca fairly well in the opening 20 minutes with a Neymar shot that was easily held by Vermeer the hosts' only attempt on goal. However, their good work was undone when Lerin Duarte unnecessarily dived in on Messi on the edge of the area and the Argentine picked himself up to fire the resulting free-kick in off the inside of the post. Ajax then did manage to carve out a decent opening when Bojan Krkic -- who was allowed to feature despite being on-loan from Barca -- found Ricardo Van Rhijn with a low cross in behind Adriano, and his diving header forced Victor Valdes into a smart stop low to his right. Valdes was called into action again six minutes later to keep out Duarte's effort from the edge of the box. However, Barca could also have extended their advantage before the interval as Messi uncharacteristically lacked precision in his finish when faced with just Vermeer to beat in first-half stoppage time, the goalkeeper making a comfortable save. Van Rhijn made a vital intervention at the start of the second-half to prevent Neymar slotting home at the back post.

1719,17/09/2013,16:01,Football: Martino excited by Champions League debut,Barcelona coach Gerardo Martino is desperate to taste his first experience of Champions League football when the Catalans host Ajax for the first time in a competitive game on Wednesday.,"The 50-year-old Argentine has plenty of experience in the Copa Libertadores, the South American version of Europe's premier club competition, but said that the quality on offer in the Champions League makes it the pinnacle for all players and managers. ""It is clear that to be able to participate in the Champions League is an important point in the career of any coach. Our hopes are high and we are very excited,"" he told a press conference on Tuesday. Martino has made a strong start to his time at Barca with the Catalans having taken 12 points from a possible 12 in the league and won the Spanish Super Cup. However, they have struggled to win 3-2 in their last two league outings against Valencia and Sevilla, with only a 93rd minute winner from Alexis Sanchez securing victory over the latter on Saturday. Just as in recent seasons, it is Barca's defending that has come under the spotlight, particularly from set-pieces, but Martino said he will stick by the central defensive pairing of Javier Mascherano and Gerard Pique for the coming weeks. ""The defensive triangle that Pique and Mascherano make with (Victor) Valdes makes it a more difficult position to change. They have had to do a lot of running and we need to be more solid so that we all run less. We need to fix how the team is working and then we can think about rotating. ""We need to change some things. We had problems from set-pieces defending both zonally and man-to-man. It is a physical problem more than anything and seen as we can't change this aspect, we need to learn how to defend them in the best way possible."" Pique meanwhile acknowledged that Barca had become somewhat predictable in recent years and that Martino's desire for them to play slightly more direct is reasonable. The Spanish international was quoted in an interview last week as saying Barca had become obsessed with their short-passing style, but insisted that will still remain very much to the forefront of their game. ""Our style is unnegotiable, but in recent years we were predictable. They knew how to defend us and a times it looked like handball with the opposition camped around their box. ""We need to find the balance between when to play more direct and when to play as we always have. Perhaps we are trying to too much to do the things the new coach has asked us, but we need time because we have only had a month together."" Injured pair Jordi Alba and Carles Puyol are the only senior players missing from Martino's 20-man squad for the match. Neymar is included and will also make his first appearance in the Champions League."

1722,16/09/2013,12:52,Football: Alves offered to donate liver to Abidal,Monaco full-back Eric Abidal has said that his old Barcelona teammate Dani Alves offered to donate the Frenchman his liver when Abidal needed a transplant 18 months ago.,"Abidal was first diagnosed with a tumour on his liver in March 2011 and after briefly returning to the first team, was ruled out of the game for over a year to undergo the transplant in March 2012. As a tribute to Abidal, who was surprisingly not offered a new contract by Barca at the end of last season, Alves has changed his squad number from two to Abidal's old number 22 this season. However, the 34-year-old has revealed their friendship went even much further than public displays of support. ""My relationship with Dani goes much further than him taking my old number 22 shirt,"" he told Catalunya radio. ""When I had to undergo surgery, he wanted to donate his liver. Logically, he couldn't because he is a professional footballer. Our relationship goes much deeper than friendship."" In another recent interview Abidal caused controversy by saying that Barca hadn't paid him whilst he had been ill. Those allegations were denied by the club who said they had fulfilled all their contractual obligations to the player. Abidal admitted there had been a misunderstanding and that he will most likely return to the club to work with their football development team once he has finished playing. In the period when Abidal needed the transplant and then during his recovery period, his playing contract was suspended by mutual consent, although he did continue to receive monthly payments from the club. His playing contract was then reactivated when he returned to training with the first team. ""I don't have any problems with Barcelona. It was all signed, what they said was true and what I said was true. ""Everything is good. I will return to Barcelona with the joy that I have always had there. ""I have an agreement with Barca for when I finish playing to be the director of their football schools worldwide and I will almost certainly accept that proposition."""
1723,16/09/2013,02:10,Football: Leverkusen baptism for newcomer Moyes,David Moyes will sample the Champions League group phase for the first time on Tuesday when his Manchester United side host Bayer Leverkusen in their opening Group A fixture.,"Moyes was selected to succeed Alex Ferguson as United manager at the end of last season despite having only overseen two matches in the competition during his 11-year tenure at Everton. Those games, in 2005, saw the Merseyside club beaten 4-2 by Villarreal over two legs in the third qualifying round, but Moyes is relishing the prospect of a second bite at the apple. ""I am really excited to be involved in it,"" he told United's in-house television station, MUTV. ""I have been in the Champions League before but I have not made the group stage. I had quite a few episodes in the Europa League, which were good, but nothing at the level of the Champions League. ""We will do our homework to make sure we are as prepared as we can be."" United are the only genuine European heavyweights in the group, but with Shakhtar Donetsk and Real Sociedad making up the pool, there is not a weak team in Group A either. Moyes says that although things could have been better, they could also have been a lot worse. ""It was the first time I have been involved in a draw at that level,"" said the Scot. ""When the names came out, there were some that I didn't want and others I would have been happy with. Relatively, I am quite pleased. ""To draw Real Sociedad out of the last pot was a tough one. They have done well in Spain this year and had a great result against Lyon to get into the group stage. ""That put a little bit of a downer on it. In addition, Leverkusen are doing well in Germany and we also have the long trip to Donetsk."" Leverkusen finished third in the Bundesliga last season and have won four of their first five games this term, with Borussia Dortmund and Bayern Munich the only sides above them in the table. Their last Champions League experience ended in humiliation, however, with a 10-2 aggregate defeat by Barcelona in the last 16 in February 2012. Manuel Friedrich and Michal Kadlec were subsequently chastised by director of sport Rudi Voller over their eagerness to swap shirts with Lionel Messi, and manager Sami Hyypia has warned his players not to be dazzled by the limelight at Old Trafford. ""I hope my players want to play football in Manchester and not just get autographs from (Wayne) Rooney,"" said the former Liverpool defender, who is also a group-stage novice as a coach. Leverkusen's defenders can expect to see plenty of Rooney on Tuesday, the England striker having returned from a head injury to score a late free-kick in Saturday's 2-0 home win over Crystal Palace. Moyes will be without Nani, however, as the Portuguese winger is suspended due to the controversial red card he was shown when United were eliminated by Real Madrid last season. United also have defenders Rafael da Silva and Phil Jones unavailable due to injury, whereas Hyypia reported no new injury problems after his side's 3-1 defeat of Wolfsburg at the weekend. It is 11 years since Leverkusen stunned United in the Champions League semi-finals, before losing to Real Madrid in the final, and striker Stefan Kiessling knows a sizeable effort will be required to pull off a similar result. ""This is a huge event for us, but we have to give it our all for 90 minutes,"" said the Germany striker, who scored twice against Wolfsburg. Tuesday's game will mark United's first European fixture without Ferguson in the dug-out since a quarter-final defeat by Hungarians FC Videoton in the UEFA Cup in March 1985. Their home form in Ferguson's later years left a lot to be desired, however, and Moyes will hope to improve a record of only three wins in nine European fixtures."
1724,15/09/2013,13:40,Football: Barca's Alba out for three weeks,Barcelona left-back Jordi Alba has been ruled out for up to three weeks after suffering a torn hamstring in the Catalans' 3-2 win over Sevilla on Saturday.,"""The medical services have confirmed that the player suffered a muscle tear in his right femoral biceps (hamstring). The estimated time out is three weeks,"" the club said in a statement. The Spanish international had to be replaced by Adriano after just 14 minutes of the clash against Sevilla and will almost certainly now miss Barca's opening two Champions League games against Ajax and Celtic. The injury comes at the worst possible time for Barca boss Gerardo Martino with the injury prone Adriano the only cover on offer at left back. Barca face a punishing schedule in the next few weeks with six games in the next 20 days and Alba is also now a doubt for Spain's two remaining World Cup qualifiers against Belarus and Georgia next month."
1725,13/09/2013,14:15,"Football: Martino rests Pedro, Busquets passed fit",Barcelona coach Gerardo Martino has continued his rotation policy by leaving Pedro Rodriguez out of his squad to face Sevilla on Saturday.,"Martino has already left out Lionel Messi, Neymar and Xavi Hernandez during his short spell in charge and says he will continue to distribute the workload around his squad with the demands of the Champions League also set to begin next week. ""The absence of Pedro is just to give him a rest because he has played a lot of minutes,"" he told a press conference on Friday. ""We must take into account minutes played with the national team. He played a very intense match against Chile, he played very well, but he played the 90 minutes. ""There are decisions that you need to take because we need the players for nine months, not just a few weeks."" Martino has however been able to name Sergio Busquets in his 20-man squad after he recovered from the thigh injury that kept him out of the Spain squad for their World Cup qualifier against Finland last week. Xavi and Alexis Sanchez also return after being rested for Barca's last league outing against Valencia a fortnight ago and Martino is hopeful both Messi and Neymar will feature despite playing in Paraguay and the USA respectively on Tuesday. ""They have trained well, above all today. Neymar has played two games and Leo just one but they have arrived in good condition. We will see tomorrow how they are feeling and we see them from afar to see whether they are in the right condition to finish the match."" Barca begin their Champions League campaign at home to Ajax on Wednesday, but with any slip-up expected to make a huge difference in the fight for the league title with Real Madrid this season, Martino doesn't want Barca to take their eye of the ball against a struggling Sevilla side. ""The Champions League always generates a different sensation, it generates a lot of excitement. But for me the league needs special attention from game to game. ""This is one of the few leagues in the world where one looks at what the rivals are doing from the first week because from there the league begins to be decided. We need to be attentive to not give away any advantage."""
1726,10/09/2013,15:35,Football: Messi tax case delayed,"The case involving Barcelona star Lionel Messi and his father on tax evasion charges has been delayed until September 27, a court statement confirmed on Tuesday.","Messi was due to appear in court in the coastal town of Gava near Barcelona on September 17, the day before Barcelona start their Champions League campaign against Ajax. However, the Argentine's lawyers had asked for that date to be changed due to commitments on another case on the same day. Messi and his father Jorge Horacio Messi are accused of trying to deceive the Spanish taxman to the tune of four million euros ($5 million, £3.4 million) by ceding the player's image rights to companies based in tax havens such as Belize and Uruguay. They are alleged to have drawn up deals in Britain and Switzerland to ensure that the income passed straight into the tax havens without passing through Spain. However, Messi's lawyers have claimed the 26-year-old has scrupulously complied with Spanish legislation and will pay any amount he is found to owe. Last week a judge's ruling confirmed that Jorge Horacio Messi paid 5.02 million euros to the tax authorities as a corrective payment in August for the four million euros due in tax plus interest. The fraud charges have come as a huge blow to Messi's previously squeaky clean reputation having avoided adverse headlines throughout his career for both his performances on the field and his behaviour off it. The four-time World Player of the Year is one of the most marketable sportsmen in the world. Messi is ranked 10th in Forbes' list of sports stars' incomes with an annual 15.8 million euros from endorsements alone."
1727,06/09/2013,23:22,Football: Barcelona clarify Abidal non-payment claims,Barcelona have clarified claims from their former player Eric Abidal that they did not pay the Frenchman during the period he was absent from the game as he underwent a liver transplant.,"Abidal had told French newspaper L'Equipe in an interview on Friday that the club had not paid him during his illness and that their decision not to renew his contract just months after his return to the field had been difficult to take. The Monaco defender was diagnosed with a tumour on his liver in March 2011 and after briefly returning to first-team action was forced onto the sidelines for over a year to undergo the transplant in March 2012. However, in a statement released on the club's website, Barca said they have since been in contact with Abidal and claim they complied fully with their contractual obligations. ""Given the declarations of Eric Abidal on the website of L'Equipe, FC Barcelona have been in contact with the player and his representative to clarify that the confusion created by the phrase 'in the months that I was ill the club didn't pay me,"" read the statement. ""Both parties confirm that the club has complied properly with its contractual obligations that it had signed with the French player."" The statement goes onto say that even though the club were aware that Abidal could need a transplant in the future, they still offered him a new contract after the tumour was first discovered and did not exercise the option they had to rescind said contract when it became known the player would need the transplant. Instead Abidal's playing contract with the club was suspended by mutual consent until he was fit enough to play again and during this time the player continued to receive monthly payments from the club. The club however did not offer the 33-year-old a new deal at the end of last season, leaving him free to join Monaco on a free transfer in July."
1728,01/09/2013,23:19,Football: Messi hat-trick keeps Barca on top,A first-half hat-trick by Lionel Messi ensured Barcelona maintained their 100% start to he La Liga season with a thrilling 3-2 win over Valencia as Real Madrid also made it three wins from three games on Sunday.,"Messi had looked far from his best in Barca's Super Cup victory over Atletico Madrid in midweek, but looked more like his old self as he put Barca 2-0 up inside 39 minutes and was then brilliantly set up by Neymar to complete his hat-trick. However, Valencia were amazingly back in the game by half-time as Helder Postiga struck twice in first-half stoppage time. Barca then passed up a host of chances to put the game to bed in the second-half and were nearly punished when Jonas struck the post four minutes from time. ""It is a difficult place to come for the players they have, the atmosphere and the intensity,"" Andres Iniesta told Canal Plus afterwards. ""We practically dominated the first-half for 44 minutes, were winning 3-0 and then we let them back into it. ""It is a question of improving. We are still at the start of the season and it is logical that the team has more to give."" Neymar had already had a goal ruled out for offside when Cesc Fabregas sprung Valencia's high line with a fine through ball on 10 minutes and Messi evaded challenge from Adil Rami and Diego Alves to bundle home from close range. Victor Valdes was then forced into a fine save to deny Dorlan Pabon levelling on his debut for Los Che. But just when it appeared Valencia were in control of the game, Barca struck twice in two minutes. Firstly, Sergio Busquets robbed the ball in midfield to allow Fabregas to set Messi free again to roll into the far corner. And then a wonderful piece of individual skill from Neymar teed-up the Argentine to side foot home his 23rd hat-trick for the Catalans. Valencia responded wonderfully though and were back in the game before half-time thanks to Postiga's double. The Portuguese firstly produced a stunning overhead kick to turn Joao Pereira's cross into the top corner. And moments later the former Spurs man rose highest to flick home Ever Banega's corner. The frantic pace continued after the break as Messi forced Alves into a stunning save from the edge of the area before Pedro somehow managed to head wide from Iniesta's cross from point-blank range. Messi was next to let Valencia off the hook as he unbelievably pulled his shot wide after more great work from Neymar and Jordi Alba down the left and then fired straight at Alves when clean through on goal. And the champions were nearly made to pay for their profligacy as Jonas' curling effort from the edge of the area was brilliantly turned onto the post by Valdes. Earlier, Real Madrid continued their unblemished start under new manager Carlo Ancelotti with a 3-1 win over Athletic Bilbao at the Santiago Bernabeu. Isco was the hero for the hosts as he opened the scoring with a neat finish from Karim Benzema's lofted pass. Cristiano Ronaldo then headed in his first goal of the season from Angel Di Maria's free-kick and Isco's deflected effort made the game safe for Carlo Ancelotti's men. Ibai Gomez pulled a late goal back for Athletic, but it mattered little as Madrid ensured their best start to the league campaign in four years. Atletico Madrid also maintained their perfect start to the campaign with a 2-1 win away at Real Sociedad. David Villa and Koke scored either side of half-time to put Diego Simeone's men in charge. However, the visitors were thankful to Thibaut Courtois for the three points as the Belgian produced two stunning saves after Xabi Prieto had reduced Sociedad's arrears 22 minutes from time. And on a night filled with goals, Sevilla and Malaga played out a 2-2 draw in the first Andalusian derby of the season. Pedro Morales and Roque Santa Cruz twice put Malaga in front, but French international Kevin Gameiro levelled on both occasions with his first goals for Sevilla since joining from PSG."

This has been my club all my life and I am very happy,"" he told the club's website. Busquets broke into the first team five years ago during Pep Guardiola's first season in charge and has since gone on to make 238 appearance for the Catalans. In that time he has helped guide Barca to four league titles, two Champions Leagues and two Copa del Rey successes. The 25-year-old is also now a firmly established member of the Spanish national side with 59 caps and was part of the side that won the 2010 World Cup and the European Championship in Poland and Ukraine last year. However, Busquets insists he is still hungry for more titles. ""Every day I try to improve and be in the best possible condition to help and work for the team and the coach. I want people to be happy with me, the fans as much as the club,"" he said. ""I am still young and I hope to keep improving and winning more titles. ""I want to keep fighting in every game and for us to put on a show with the same philosophy that we have showed up until now."" Meanwhile Barca confirmed on Tuesday that 22-year-old winger Cristian Tello will also sign an extension until 2018 on Friday. Tello has scored eight goals in his 34 appearances for the club and made his debut for the senior Spanish national side in their 2-0 friendly win over Ecuador earlier this month."

However, Costa believes Villa will prove to be a more than capable deputy for Falcao who scored 70 goals in his two seasons with Los Rojiblancos before a 60 million euro move to Monaco in June. ""You notice the absence of Falcao because he is a great player, but we have Villa who is also a beast and we know that he is going to do just as well,"" Costa told the club's website. ""His work and commitment for the team is amazing. He is a very humble person and he has a great attitude. I think with the quality he has he will give a lot to Atletico."" Villa will be desperate to impress against his former employers after never truly getting a consistent run in the side after breaking his tibia in the Club World Cup back in December 2011. A troublesome on field relationship with Lionel Messi and Barca's capture of Neymar in June made Villa's exit from the Camp Nou somewhat inevitable. But with Champions League football and a regular starting place on offer at Atleti he has the perfect platform to show he should be Vicente Del Bosque's first-choice striking option come the World Cup next year. Under Diego Simeone's tutelage Atleti have already improved mightily and an unlikely success against the Catalans over two legs would mean a fourth trophy in little over a year. Simeone ruled out any idea of a title challenge from Atleti in the strongest terms following the Sevilla result, castigating La Liga as a ""boring"" championship that is only about two clubs. However, Barca goalkeeper Victor Valdes rejected claims that there is no competition for the big two in Spain and is expecting a tought test from Atleti. ""They showed against Sevilla that they will be a very difficult opponent. It will be another test for this Barca. ""You only have to watch how Betis played against Real Madrid, the Sevilla-Atletico game and Valencia this weekend. It will be a difficult game wherever we play."" After a dream start to his career in charge of the Spanish champions thanks to Sunday's 7-0 trouncing of Levante, Barca boss Gerardo Martino could hand Neymar his first competitive start at the Vicente Calderon. The Brazilian only made an appearance as a second-half substitute at the weekend. And while the goalscoring performances of Pedro and Alexis Sanchez may keep him on the bench once more, Spanish international duo Andres Iniesta and Jordi Alba are expected to return after also being rested by Martino following their gruelling trip to Ecuador to represent the world champions last week."
1732,19/08/2013,13:46,Football: Valdes surprised at Casillas omission,Barcelona goalkeeper Victor Valdes has expressed  surprise that Spanish international teammate Iker Casillas was not selected by new manager Carlo Ancelotti for Real Madrid's 2-1 win over Real Betis on Sunday.,"In a repeat of the final months of Jose Mourinho's reign at Madrid, Ancelotti dropped club captain Casillas to the bench and played Diego Lopez. However, Valdes, who was away on international duty with Casillas for the Confederations Cup in June and last week's friendly against Ecuador, believes Casillas is still the best 'keeper in the country. ""I was surprised that he didn't start yesterday. In training with Spain he looked good to me and in the Confederations also,"" he told a press conference on Monday. ""I don't tire of saying that he has made saves that I didn't think were possible. For me he is the best. ""I am not the one to have an opinion because it is not my club and I am not in that dressing room. ""I would like to see him there though because it has always been a personal challenge for me to face him for a number of years."" In contrast to Madrid, who needed a late winner from new signing Isco to collect all three points, Barca started the campaign on fire with a 7-0 thrashing of Levante that included six first-half goals. The Catalans were also under new management as Gerardo Martino took charge for the first time in a competitive match and Valdes is very much in favour of his decisions to press high up the field and introduce man-marking when defending corners. ""I think it was at the very least one of the best starts to the season I have seen. The team was very intense and defended much higher up the field which allowed us to recover the ball quicker and counter-attack. ""The coach and his team said that they prefer to mark man-to-man and I am happy with this because I am of the same opinion. It gives a goalkeeper more space to come out and collect crosses. ""We marked zonally with Pep (Guardiola) and Tito (Vilanova) and now we have changed, but I like this way of defending."""
1733,18/08/2013,18:19,Football: Neymar on bench for Barca league opener,Brazilian international Neymar has been left out of new Barcelona manager Gerardo Martino's starting line-up for the Catalans opening league match of the season against Levante on Sunday.,"The 21-year-old joined Barca for 57 million euros ($75.7 million, £49.5 million) back in May, but has had a disrupted pre-season due to his participation in the Confederations Cup in June and then reportedly being diagnosed with anemia. Lionel Messi has been passed fit to start though after missing Argentina's friendly with Italy in midweek with a quadriceps injury. However, Martino has also left Spanish internationals Andres Iniesta and Jordi Alba on the bench after they were part of the Spanish squad that travelled to South America to play Ecuador on Wednesday."
1734,17/08/2013,13:00,Football: Messi included in Barca squad for Levante,World Player of the Year Lionel Messi has been named in new Barcelona coach Gerardo Martino's squad for the champions' opening La Liga game against Levante on Sunday.,"Messi had missed Argentina's friendly victory over Italy on Wednesday due to a quadriceps strain, but returned to training on Friday and Martino confirmed that both he and Cesc Fabregas -- who also missed Spain's victory over Ecuador in midweek due to injury -- will be fit to play. ""Both players have trained almost normally so they shouldn't have any problem in playing,"" he said at a press conference on Saturday. Martino also confirmed that he has advised the club not to sign a central defender before the transfer window shuts on September 2. The Catalans have been linked with Chelsea's David Luiz and Liverpool's Daniel Agger in recent weeks, but Martino is confident that, barring a number of injuries, they have the cover required at the back. ""I know the club was looking for a central defender before I arrived. What I said to them was that (Carles) Puyol is recuperating well, with (Gerard) Pique, (Javier) Mascherano, (Marc) Bartra and even Adriano and (Sergio) Busquets, we are fine. ""If there are any injuries, then we have the winter transfer market."" Despite Puyol's progress after having knee surgery in July though, the 35-year-old is not expected to be back in action before September."
1735,16/08/2013,21:27,Football: Barca's Pedro given green light for new season,Spain winger Pedro is fit to start the new season on Sunday after Friday being given the green light to resume playing.,"The 26-year-old had been suffering from a muscle problem in his leg, suffered during pre-season, but came unscathed through two training sessions this week. ""The player has received the medical green light,"" said Barca in a statement. Barca begin the defence of their La Liga title at home to Levante on Sunday."
1736,14/08/2013,12:12,"Football: Pedro, Fabregas back in Barca training",Spanish international duo Pedro Rodriguez and Cesc Fabregas are expected to be fit for Barcelona's league opener against Levante after taking part in training on Wednesday.,"""The two players who were injured on the tour of Asia have taken part in some of the session with the rest of the team,"" said a statement on Barca's website. Neither player had travelled with the Spain squad for their friendly with Ecuador in Guayaquil on Wednesday evening. Pedro was not included in Vicente del Bosque's squad because of a calf injury, while Fabregas was forced to pull out of the travelling party to South America with a sprained right ankle. Lionel Messi meanwhile could yet face Levante on Sunday as he continued his recovery work from a thigh injury that ruled him out of Argentina's friendly against Italy on Wednesday night. There was more good news on the injury front for the Catalans as captain Carles Puyol stepped up the intensity of his training following knee surgery to remove a cyst last month. However, the 35-year-old is not expected to be match fit until the end of September."
1737,14/08/2013,02:10,Football: Barca hoping Neymar nourishes Messi's magic,"In contrast to previous seasons, Barcelona played their trump card in the transfer market early this year by securing the services of Brazilian starlet Neymar for 57 million euros ($75.7 million, £49.5 million) back in May.","The 21-year-old had been on the Catalans' radar for some time with Barca having even made a down payment of 10 million euros to Santos for first option on the player a year previously. However, the confirmation of his transfer was hastened by the feeling that Barca needed to react quickly to having been thrashed 7-0 by Bayern Munich in last season's Champions League semi-finals. Initial scepticism as to whether Barca really needed another forward option rather than a defender subsided after Neymar's stunning performances as Brazil won the Confederations Cup in June. One question that remains unanswered though is how Neymar's talents will dovetail with four-time World Player of the Year Lionel Messi? As much as the Argentine is often lauded for not being the stereotypical egotistical modern footballer, the success that both player and club have had in recent years has very much depended on building the side around Messi's talents. The need for Messi to play in a deep-lying central striking role hastened the sale of Samuel Eto'o, resulted in Zlatan Ibrahimovic ending his sole season in Catalonia on the bench and has also limited Cesc Fabregas' chances to play where he has successfully combined with Xavi and Andres Iniesta with Spain. Those sacrifices though have been worth a return of 271 goals over the past five seasons and concerns over how Messi and Neymar will co-exist appear to have been overblown for a number of reasons. Firstly, as much as they still need defenders, Barca also desperately needed a scoring option that isn't Messi. Over the past five seasons in which Messi has starred, Barca have won the Champions League twice and on both occasions Messi was outscored by his striking partners over the course of the season. In 2008/09 Samuel Eto'o and Thierry Henry combined for 62 goals to Messi's 38 and in 2010/11 Pedro and David Villa's joint tally of 55 just edged past Messi's 53. By contrast in the last two seasons, while Messi has rattled in more than 50 goals each time, Barca's second top scorers were Villa with 16 and Cesc Fabregas' 15 in 2011/12. Moreover, unlike Ibrahimovic or Fabregas, Neymar is naturally much more compatible with Messi as he likes to start on the left of a front three and cut inside towards goal. With Villa's departure to Atletico Madrid last month, that position is now vacant in the Barca side and Neymar's movement should also help drag defenders away from focusing their attention solely on Messi. Most importantly of all though, is that Neymar seems to be accepting his rung in the Barca hierarchy. After being hammered 4-0 by Barca in the Club World Cup final just under two years ago, Neymar admitted he and his Santos teammates ""had been given a football lesson"" and that he ""aspired to get to Messi's level."" Fast-forward to 2013 and Neymar insisted at his official unveiling as a Barca player that he had come to Barca to ""help Messi continue being the best in the world."" Asked about his first impressions of Neymar this week, Xavi told Catalan sports daily Sport that ""the important thing is that he is humble, he will fit perfectly into the Barca philosophy."" Should the South American duo hit it off, that philosophy will, more than ever, be based on winning with an exciting brand of attacking football."
1738,13/08/2013,16:54,Football: Messi to miss Italy friendly - Barca,"World Player of the Year Lionel Messi will miss Argentina's friendly with Italy on Wednesday, Messi's club Barcelona confirmed on Tuesday.","""Leo Messi will not play the friendly in Rome this Wednesday between Argentina and Italy,"" said a statement on the club's website. ""After undergoing a check-up with the Argentine medical staff it has been decided that the star will return to Barcelona to continue his recovery from a quadriceps strain in his left leg."" The 25-year-old missed the final match of Barca's Asian tour against Malaysia on Saturday due to the injury. However, the club are still hopeful that he will be fit to play on Sunday as the Catalans begin their La Liga title defence against Levante."
