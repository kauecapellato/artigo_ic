0,13/02/2021,17:38,Haaland spares Dortmund blushes,A late equaliser from Erling Braut Haaland spared Borussia Dortmund's blushes on Saturday as they drew 2-2 at home against Bundesliga rivals Hoffenheim.,"Haaland's 81st minute strike averted a fourth defeat in five Bundesliga games for crisis-hit Dortmund. Yet even a draw leaves Dortmund three points adrift of the Champions League places in sixth, and heaps more pressure on interim coach Edin Terzic. Dortmund have won just four of ten league games since Terzic took the reins from Lucien Favre in December, prompting growing speculation over his future. Yet veteran defender Mats Hummels defended his coach on Saturday and backed Dortmund to revive their season. ""It's never the case that things are exactly how you want them a few weeks after a new coach takes over. That wasn't the case years ago under Jurgen Klopp, and it isn't the case now under Edin,"" Hummels told Sky. ""We're working hard, and success will come,"" he added. England international Jadon Sancho gave Dortmund a perfect start, racing up the left-wing to score his fourth league goal this season on 24 minutes. The lead didn't last long, as Munas Dabbur scuffed a shot past Marwin Hitz to level just seven minutes later. Ihlas Bebou bundled in Hoffenheim's second just after half-time, the ball bouncing off the Togolese and into the goal as Hitz tried to beat away a dangerous cross from the left wing. Haaland had a goal ruled out for offside in the second half before pouncing on a misplaced pass to snatch a crucial late equaliser. Fellow Champions League hopefuls Bayer Leverkusen also dropped points after they conceded two late goals to draw 2-2 with strugglers Mainz. Lucas Alario tapped in a low Moussa Diaby cross to give Leverkusen the lead on 14 minutes. Patrik Schick appeared to have sealed three points with a second on 84 minutes. Yet second-from-bottom Mainz were rewarded for a brave performance as late goals by Robert Glatzel and Kevin Stoeger saved a point and continued their recent revival under new coach Bo Svensson. Elsewhere, Werder Bremen were held to a 0-0 draw at home to Freiburg while Sami Khedira helped rescue a 1-1 draw for Hertha Berlin against boyhood club Stuttgart. ""It was the first time I'd ever played against Stuttgart so it was strange, but it was nice to come back,"" Khedira, who joined Hertha from Juventus in January after a decade abroad, told Sky. Austrian striker Sasa Kalajdzic headed in his ninth goal of the season to give Stuttgart the lead at the end of a scrappy first half. Veteran midfielder Khedira came off the bench in the second-half and set up a late equaliser for 17-year-old Luca Netz to save the capital club from a fifth straight defeat."
1,08/02/2021,14:20,"Bayern fume, Mbappe flies, Zlatan's milestone: European talking points","Bayern Munich's preparation for the Club World Cup was disrupted despite victory, Kylian Mbappe rediscovered his supersonic speed and Lionel Messi starred from the bench, while Zlatan Ibrahimovic notched his 500th club goal at the weekend.","AFP Sport rounds up some of the main talking points from across the continent: Bayern Munich's weekend started well, Kingsley Coman's deflected strike securing a 1-0 win at Hertha Berlin on Friday as they maintained a seven-point lead at the top of the Bundesliga from RB Leipzig. They then boarded a plane for Qatar in preparation for a night flight to the Club World Cup, but the necessary de-icing of the aircraft meant they were refused permission for take-off due to a ban on flights between midnight and 7:00 am. That meant a departure seven hours later than planned, ruining plans to train on Saturday and hampering preparations for Monday's semi-final against Al Ahly. ""Those in charge (at the airport) don't have an inkling of what they've done to our team,"" Bayern chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge said. ""Of course it was not optimal,"" said Joshua Kimmich. ""Nonetheless I think that we will be able to win the match."" It was what made Kylian Mbappe so breathtaking when he first broke through but it was something that had not been seen so often this season. On Sunday the France star produced a stunning sprint to finish off a counter-attack and score Paris Saint-Germain's opener in a 2-0 win at Marseille. Mbappe's run was clocked at an incredible 36 kilometres per hour, but he managed to slow down enough to control Angel di Maria's pass and score his 16th Ligue 1 goal this season, as PSG stayed third, three points behind leaders Lille. ""The feeling is coming back because I am playing every game now,"" said Mbappe, who was often on the bench in Thomas Tuchel's final matches in charge but has hardly missed a minute under new coach Mauricio Pochettino. ""I am finishing games stronger. I am not so burnt out. It can only be a good thing."" PSG's Champions League last 16, first leg in Barcelona is just eight days away. The last time Lionel Messi came off the bench in La Liga, he was introduced at half-time and scored twice in a 5-2 win over Betis. On Sunday he again came on as a substitute against Betis, this time in the 57th minute. Moments later he scored Barcelona's equaliser, and he then played a key part in their second before fellow substitute Francisco Trincao's late strike secured a 3-2 win. Messi was rested at the start along with Frenkie de Jong and Pedri, with coach Ronald Koeman appearing to prioritise Wednesday's Copa del Rey semi-final, first leg at Sevilla, and with the PSG Champions League tie approaching too. Barca, like Real Madrid, are seven points behind La Liga leaders Atletico Madrid, who have two games in hand and play on Monday against Celta Vigo. Zlatan Ibrahimovic's brace was key in setting AC Milan on the way to a 4-0 win over Crotone that kept them two points clear of Inter atop Serie A, but it also saw the former Sweden striker reach a remarkable milestone. The goals were his 500th and 501st at club level since starting out with Malmo in 1999. Now 39, he is in his second spell with Milan and his hoping to win a second Scudetto with the Rossoneri, after starring in their 2011 title triumph. Ibrahimovic scored 14 goals that season and already has 14 this season, in just 11 appearances. Mesut Ozil made his second substitute appearance in five days for new club Fenerbahce but could not help turn Istanbul's Intercontinental derby, as Galatasaray headed back to the European side of the Bosphorus with a 1-0 win. Ozil had helped set up a goal in Fenerbahce's 2-1 win at Hatayspor last Wednesday. Against Galatasaray, the ex-Arsenal man came on for the last 27 minutes with Fenerbahce already trailing. It is shaping up to be quite a title run-in in Turkey, with Galatasaray, Besiktas and Fenerbahce all level on 48 points at the top."
2,05/02/2021,22:50,Bayern head for Qatar with 10-point Bundesliga lead after Hertha win,Bayern Munich head to the Club World Cup with five successive wins under their belt after Kingsley Coman's first-half winner handed the Bundesliga leaders a 1-0 victory at Hertha Berlin on Friday.,"The win leaves Bayern 10 points clear of second-placed RB Leipzig, who have a game in hand away to crisis-hit Schalke on Saturday. ""We could have scored a few more goals today,"" Bayern striker Thomas Mueller told broadcaster DAZN. ""We have a few wins in a row now and we are looking forward to the Club World Cup."" Coman found the net with a deflected shot on 21 minutes to give Bayern all three points in snowy Berlin, just hours before they left for next week's tournament in Qatar. Bayern face African Champions League winners Al-Ahly in Monday's semi-final in Doha. Yet they first had to get past a Hertha side buoyed by the return of former coach Pal Dardai last month and the arrival of former Germany midfielder Sami Khedira on a free transfer from Juventus. Khedira, though, played only 10 minutes as a substitute as Bayern battled to a narrow win. ""I didn't expect to be playing 90 minutes straight away. I know I need time on the pitch and in training,"" said Khedira, who made just one appearance for Juventus in the last 12 months. A bright start from the home side was snuffed out when goalkeeper Rune Jarstein brought down Leroy Sane in the box on 11 minutes. Yet the Hertha stopper redeemed himself immediately, diving to his right to save Robert Lewandowski's penalty. Ten minutes later, Jarstein was left flapping at the ball as Coman's shot deflected off Niklas Stark and looped into the net. Both Jarstein and his opposite number Manuel Neuer made several saves before half-time, as an entertaining game swung from end to end. Hertha had a brilliant chance to equalise two minutes from time, as Matheus Cunha beat the offside trap and found himself one-on-one with Neuer. Yet the Brazilian's chip over the Bayern keeper trickled wide of the post, prompting howls of anguish from the Berlin bench."
3,04/02/2021,17:12,Bayern head to Qatar via Khedira's Hertha Berlin,Bayern Munich striker Thomas Mueller is hoping to spoil fellow World Cup winner Sami Khedira's homecoming Friday when the Bundesliga leaders take on Hertha Berlin before departing for the Club World Cup in Qatar.,"""I am really happy that Sami is back. He's a child of the Bundesliga,"" Mueller told the Bayern website ahead of Friday's clash. ""I'm excited to see how his return to Germany pans out, even if I hope it starts badly on Friday."" Former Germany midfielder Khedira, who won the World Cup alongside Mueller in 2014, could make his first Bundesliga appearance in over a decade on Friday after joining Hertha from Juventus in a headline-grabbing move earlier this week. The 33-year-old is charged with helping hapless Hertha turn their season around, with the ambitious capital club currently stuck just a single place above the relegation play-off spot. For Bayern, the game is a chance to consolidate their seven-point lead at the top of the table before they travel to Doha for the Club World Cup next week. Last season's Champions League winners will play their semi-final on Monday against the winners of Thursday's game between Qatari club Al-Duhail and African Champions League winners Al-Ahly. Mueller said Thursday that the Club World Cup was Bayern's chance to ""crown an incredible year"" after winning only their second ever treble in 2020. Second-placed RB Leipzig will look to keep the heat on Bayern with a win at bottom club Schalke, while Borussia Dortmund hope to break back into the top four on their trip to Freiburg. Dortmund should return to full strength on Saturday after injury scares for veteran defender Mats Hummels and English winger Jadon Sancho. Hummels missed Tuesday's narrow German Cup win over Paderborn with a knee problem, while Sancho limped off the field in extra-time. Yet Dortmund director Sebastian Kehl told Bild newspaper he hoped both players would return against Freiburg. Elsewhere, Borussia Moenchengladbach prepare to take on local rivals Cologne amid growing speculation over the future of coach Marco Rose. Rose, 44, has been touted as a potential successor to interim coach Edin Terzic in the Dortmund dugout at the end of the season. ""We want to have clarity (about Rose's future) as soon as possible"", Gladbach sporting director Max Eberl told Sky. The veteran Dutch striker could make his first Bundesliga appearance since 2017 after making a surprise return to Schalke from Ajax in January. Huntelaar, 37, was prolific for Schalke between 2010 and 2017, and has now returned to help them launch an improbable bid to avoid relegation in the second half of the season. Bottom of the league and nine points adrift of safety, Schalke's season hit a new low as they were knocked out of the cup by Wolfsburg on Wednesday, with Huntelaar making a 10-minute cameo as a substitute. 15 - Clean sheets Manuel Neuer has kept in 22 games against Hertha, a joint Bundesliga record for the most against any single club. 126 - Goals Klaas-Jan Huntelaar scored in 240 games for Schalke in his previous, seven-year spell at the club. 3,926 - Days since Sami Khedira's last Bundesliga appearance, for Stuttgart against Hoffenheim on the last day of the 2009/10 season.

4,31/01/2021,12:25,Hertha Berlin confirm talks with Juventus star Khedira,Bundesliga strugglers Hertha Berlin have confirmed they are in talks with Sami Khedira and could sign the former Germany midfielder before the transfer window closes on Monday.,"""We are talking to him, there are a few things to clear up and a few questions to answer before Monday at 1800 (1700GMT),"" when the transfer window closes, Hertha CEO Carsten Schmidt told Sky Sunday. According to magazine Kicker, Khedira arrived in Berlin on Saturday and was due to undergo a medical check on Sunday. The 33-year-old is under contract at Juventus until the end of the season, but head coach Andrea Pirlo has yet to play him in 2020/21. Schmidt described Khedira as ""an awesome leader with a lot of experience"" but acknowledged the midfielder ""has had no match practise for a while"". Khedira helped Germany win the 2014 World Cup and lifted the Champions League with Real Madrid in 2013/14. He has won five Italian league titles and made 145 appearances for Juventus since his 2015 transfer from Real. If Khedira joins Hertha, he will return to the Bundesliga for the first time since 2010, when he left Stuttgart having come through their academy. Hertha lost 3-1 at Eintracht Frankfurt on Saturday and are just two points from the relegation places after failing to win their last five games."
5,29/01/2021,03:03,Hoffenheim plot new Bayern shock on Munich return,"As the architect of Bayern Munich's single defeat in 2020, Hoffenheim coach Sebastian Hoeness hopes to again down the European champions in the Bundesliga on Saturday when he returns to his former club.","Bayern host mid-table Hoffenheim at the Allianz Arena seeking revenge for September's 4-1 league defeat - their only loss of 2020 in any competition. The shock win over the European champions ""will certainly still be in our heads,"" admitted Hoeness, ""but we want to use this game to annoy Bayern again"". Bayern hold a seven-point lead in the table and are near full-strength with only Corentin Tolisso and Tanguy Nianzou sidelined. After poor results around Christmas, Hoffenheim are back up to 11th thanks to back-to-back 3-0 wins against strugglers Hertha Berlin and Cologne. However, the European champions are a huge test for Hoffenheim on Hoeness' return to Munich, where the 38-year-old coached the reserves last season having previously worked with Bayern's junior teams. A key factor Saturday is the form of Hoffenheim striker Andrej Kramaric, who has scored twice in each of his last two games. Leading the pack chasing Bayern, RB Leipzig host Bayer Leverkusen on Saturday night with both clubs eager to bounce back from defeats. After crashing 3-2 at second-from-bottom Mainz, Leipzig coach Julian Nagelsmann compared Bayern to Germany's high-speed ICE trains and his team to a regional train, struggling to ""catch up"". In order to get back on track, Leipzig must beat third-placed Leverkusen, who trail them by three points. ""The game has no direct influence on the title race - it's all about qualifying for the Champions League,"" Nagelsmann insisted Thursday. Leipzig welcome back Yussuf Poulsen after a groin injury, but playmaker Emil Forsberg is sidelined by a knee knock. Leverkusen, who crashed at home to Wolfsburg last weekend, are missing midfielders Julian Baumgartlinger, who underwent knee surgery on Monday, and Nadiem Amiri, who is quarantined after testing positive for Covid-19. Having slipped out of the European places to seventh, Dortmund host Augsburg on Saturday chasing a first win in four games. ""We have to correct mistakes from set-pieces,"" said caretaker coach Edin Terzic after Dortmund conceded three goals from deadball situations in a 4-2 defeat at Gladbach. Erling Braut Haaland scored twice in the Gladbach defeat, but Dortmund need him and England winger Jadon Sancho to fire their attack. ""When they (Augsburg) make mistakes, we have to be there - ice-cold,"" added Terzic. Eintracht Frankfurt, who are a point above Dortmund in the table and bouyed by a 5-1 thrashing of Bielefeld, are home on Saturday to Hertha Berlin, where Pal Dardai is back in charge. The 44-year-old replaces Bruno Labbadia, who was sacked following their 4-1 thrashing at home by Werder Bremen. Frankfurt striker Luka Jovic has scored three goals in three appearances off the bench since returning on loan from Real Madrid. Dardai predicts it could be ""5-4 or 6-5"" at Frankfurt, who ""score a lot of goals.... we're going there to score one more"". The Croatia striker scored twice in last September's 4-1 win over Bayern and has also netted two goals in Hoffenheim's recent wins against Hertha and Cologne. He is back in form after contracting Covid-19 on international duty last October which sidelined him for seven games. Kramaric will test Bayern's defence and his four goals in two games, ""speak for themselves,"" said Hoffenheim coach Hoeness. 76 - the minutes Luka Jovic has needed for three goals off the bench having been loaned back to Eintracht Frankfurt after failing to settle at Real. 18 - home league games since Bayern last lost at the Allianz Arena when Leverkusen managed a 2-1 win in November 2019. 1 - the single victory Hoffenheim has managed at the Allianz Arena, poaching a 2-1 win in Munich in October 2019.

6,25/01/2021,16:59,Dardai makes return to lowly Hertha Berlin,"Hungarian Pal Dardai has been named Hertha Berlin coach 19 months after leaving the position, the Bundesliga strugglers announced on Monday.","Dardai stood down as Hertha boss in June 2019 but replaces the sacked Bruno Labbadia with the side two points away from the relegation play-off spot after just two wins since December. The 44-year-old had been in charge of the U16s and holds the club record of 373 appearances. ""Nobody needs telling what Hertha BSC means to me, so there was no doubt in my mind that I would be ready to help out in this situation,"" he said in a statement. ""I am looking forward to the challenge and working together with the team,"" he added. Labbadia and general manager Michael Preetz were fired following Saturday's home defeat to Werder Bremen. Last year, Labbadia had taken over from ex-Germany forward Jurgen Klinsmann who had lasted just 10 games. The capital city side spent around 100 million euros ($122 million) in transfers last season, funded by the club's wealthy backer Lars Windhorst. Dardai's first game in charge during his second spell will be Saturday's trip to Eintracht Frankfurt before hosting leaders Bayern Munich on February 5."
7,24/01/2021,13:58,Hertha Berlin sack both coach Labbadia and general manager Preetz,Bundesliga strugglers Hertha Berlin on Sunday sacked both coach Bruno Labbadia and general manager Michael Preetz in a shake up following their 4-1 thrashing at home by Werder Bremen.,"Saturday's heavy defeat leaves Hertha two points from the relegation places in the league table, which the club's CEO Carsten Schmidt described as ""a very precarious situation"". ""After much deliberation, we feel that a change of head coach can give the team fresh impetus,"" Schmidt added in a statement. Labbadia, 54, took charge in April 2020 and kept Hertha in Germany's top flight last season, but the team has taken just one point from four games in 2021. He is replaced by caretaker coach Pal Dardai, who was in charge of the first team from 2015 until 2019 before being moved to the club's youth academy. Schmidt said Hertha expects to name a permanent head coach ""in the coming days"". Preetz, 53, was shown the door after 25 years with Hertha, first as a player, then eventually becoming general manager in 2009. He has been axed for failing to move Hertha forward despite the spending of around 100 million euros ($122 million) in transfers last season, funded by the club's wealthy backer Lars Windhorst. Sports director and former Germany defender Arne Friedrich will take over Preetz's responsibilities until the end of the season. Hertha face a tough run of fixtures next month with Bundesliga leaders Bayern Munich and RB Leipzig, who are currently second, both visiting Berlin's Olympic Stadium in February."
8,02/01/2021,23:24,Near-forgotten minnows urge 'save our record' as Schalke hit 30 matches without win,"Schalke 04 are now winless in their last 30 league games - one match short of the Bundesliga's record for the longest winless streak, which near-forgotten minnows Tasmania Berlin are desperate to keep.","Placards reading ""That is our record! Ra-Ra-Ra Tasmania (The Original)"" and ""Save the record for Tas!"" were laid out in front of Berlin's Olympic Stadium before Schalke's 3-0 defeat to Hertha Berlin on Saturday. Christian Gross, Schalke's fourth head coach this season, got off to a losing start as Arsenal loanee Matteo Guendouzi, Colombia striker Jhon Cordoba and his replacement, Poland forward Krzysztof Piatek, scored for Hertha. ""I hope we can still sign in one or two players, who could bring a bit of personality,"" said Gross after watching his new team's latest loss. Schalke, who are bottom of the league, boosted their squad last Thursday by re-signing defender Sead Kolasinac, who did not face Hertha, on loan from Arsenal. They host Hoffenheim next Saturday and are now one match from equalling the league record, long held by Tasmania Berlin, who went 31 matches without winning in the 1965/66 Bundesliga season. Tasmania Berlin, based in the capital's central district of Neukoelln, now languish in the fifth-tier of German football. Their chairman Almir Numic - a fan of Schalke's arch rivals Borussia Dortmund - has mixed feelings about potentially losing the record. ""As a Dortmund fan, I wouldn't mind if Schalke continued without a win and even get relegated,"" he told website Fussball.de ""On the other hand, this story is simply part of the identity of 'Tas'. ""Our only Bundesliga season was five and a half decades ago, but we are still a topic - nationwide. We don't really have to do any advertising."""
9,02/01/2021,23:20,Olmo fires RB Leipzig top of Bundesliga ahead of Bayern Munich,RB Leipzig dislodged Bayern Munich at the top of the Bundesliga table Saturday as Dani Olmo's second-half goal was enough to seal a 1-0 win at Stuttgart.,"""It was really good for me and the team to start the year with a win,"" Olmo told DAZN. With European champions Bayern at home to strugglers Mainz on Sunday, Leipzig took the chance to go a point ahead as Olmo fired through the legs of Stuttgart goalkeeper Gregor Kobel. Stuttgart's Swiss shot-stopper had earlier pulled off some heroics by using his foot to save a Emil Forsberg first-half penalty attempt. Leipzig also wasted a golden chance when Amadou Haidara fired wide just after the break. With 23 minutes left, Spain midfielder Olmo finally got the breakthrough, finishing a move he started after Leipzig had moved the ball across the Stuttgart penalty area. ""It feels good to be top,"" admitted Leipzig defender Willi Orban. ""The first half was good, the second was better - we were clearly the dominant team."" Earlier, Bayer Leverkusen blew the chance to take first place after stumbling to a 2-1 defeat at Eintracht Frankfurt which saw them drop to third as the league resumed after a two-week break. ""I have made my feelings clear in the dressing room,"" Leverkusen head coach Peter Bosz told Sky. ""We deserved to lose. Frankfurt had a better claim to the victory."" Leverkusen midfielder Nadiem Amiri scored with a deft back-heel flick to give the visitors the lead after only 10 minutes in Frankfurt. However, Amin Younes equalised to make it 1-1 at half-time before Japan midfielder Daichi Kamada put in a cross which Leverkusen defender Edmond Tapsoba turned into his own net. Before kickoff, Frankfurt director Fredi Bobic confirmed reports his club are interested in Bayern's teenage striker Joshua Zirkzee, 19, after selling Dutch forward Bas Dost to Brugge. Zirkzee could back up Frankfurt's top scorer Andre Silva, who has notched nine league goals this season. Union Berlin rose to fourth - into the Champions League places for the first time in the club's history - after their 2-0 win at Werder Bremen. Liverpool loanee Taiwo Awoniyi, who has scored in his last three league games, capped another impressive display with a goal and assist. After Bremen lost the ball in their own half, the 23-year-old Nigeria international took advantage of a two-on-two situation by drawing the defence and passing to Sheraldo Becker, who fired home on 12 minutes. Awoniyi doubled Union's lead on 28 minutes by tapping the ball over the line, just out of the reach of Bremen goalkeeper Jiri Pavlenka. Bremen had a penalty appeal turned down when a shot by Japan midfielder Yuya Osako clipped the hand of a Union defender, then Romano Schmid had a goal ruled offside. Hoffenheim lost both defender Kevin Akpoguma and Germany midfielder Sebastian Rudy with early leg injuries as they crashed to a 3-1 home defeat to Freiburg. With the hosts struggling to reshuffle, Freiburg were 3-0 up at half-time thanks to a Baptiste Santamaria goal, a Vincenzo Grifo penalty and an own goal by Senegal defender Kasim Adams. Hoffenheim scored a second-half consolation goal through Togo winger Ihlas Bebou. Borussia Moenchengeladbach, who host Manchester City in the first leg of the Champions League last 16 next month, earned their first win in five league games with a 1-0 victory at Arminia Bielefeld. Swiss striker Breel Embolo netted the winning goal just after half-time when he held off a defender and fired home. Mid-table Augsburg rebounded after back-to-back defeats with a 1-0 win at Cologne with Brazilian winger Iago netting the late winner. Bottom side Schalke are now 30 games without a win -- one short of the Bundesliga record -- after a 3-0 defeat away to Hertha Berlin. Former Tottenham manager Christian Gross, installed as Schalke's fourth head coach this season, got off to a losing start as Arsenal loanee Matteo Guendouzi, Colombia striker Jhon Cordoba and his replacement, Poland forward Krzysztof Piatek, scored for Hertha. Having netted two minutes after coming off the bench, Piatek had a second late goal ruled offside."
10,04/12/2020,22:45,Piatek double for Hertha in Berlin derby ends Union's unbeaten run,Hertha Berlin replacement striker Krzysztof Piatek scored two goals in three second-half minutes to seal a 3-1 win over 10-man FC Union in the Bundesliga derby on Friday night.,"""It's an amazing feeling to get two goals in the derby,"" Piatek told broadcaster DAZN. Union's eight-match unbeaten run came to an abrupt end behind closed doors at the Olympic Stadium as Hertha enjoyed their first home win this season. Union played for more than an hour with ten men after midfielder Robert Andrich was shown a straight red for going into a challenge with his foot up. Union took the lead when Nigeria striker Taiwo Awoniyi got between two defenders and hit the bottom corner of the net on 20 minutes. However, Union were down to ten men just three minutes later. Andrich went into a tackle on Hertha midfielder Lucas Tousart with his foot up, making no attempt to pull out of the challenge. It stayed 1-0 at the break, but the numerical disadvantage took its toll on Union as Piatek came off the bench at half-time and Hertha managed three unanswered goals. They equalised when Matheus Cunha shot from range and although his shot was parried, right-back Peter Pekarik was on hand to tap home the rebound. It was 2-0 on 74 minutes when Piatek's shot deflected off defender Marvin Friedrich and wrong-footed Union goalkeeper Andreas Luthe. Piatek grabbed his second in style 13 minutes from time when he smashed a volley past Luthe. The visitor's miserable night was summed up when Union's former Germany striker Max Kruse limped off with a knee injury in added time. The result lifts Hertha to 11th in the table with Union sixth."
11,03/12/2020,03:15,Union striker Kruse in spotlight for Berlin derby at Hertha,"Hertha Berlin host capital-city rivals Union Berlin behind closed doors at the Olympic Stadium in Friday's derby, with former Germany striker Max Kruse in stunning form for the visitors, who are on an eight-match unbeaten run.","This will be the third Bundesliga clash between the clubs since Union's promotion in 2018/19 and the second behind closed doors due to the coronavirus pandemic. East Berlin-based Union won a fiery confrontation at home last season with a 90th-minute penalty in November 2019, only for Hertha, who play in the west, to exact revenge with a 4-0 thumping in May. To make their presence felt, Hertha had tens of thousands of flags in the club's blue and white colours planted across Berlin on Monday. ""We're playing a derby without fans, we wanted to create a little derby atmosphere, a little derby fever,"" a Hertha spokesman said on Wednesday. Rival fans were soon posting pictures either posing proudly with their flag or dumping them in the nearest bin -- depending on their loyalties. However, the PR stunt happened without the necessary permit, putting Hertha offside with city authorities, who threatened to fine the club. Union's unbeaten run has taken them to sixth in the table, six points behind leaders Bayern Munich, who they host the following weekend. In contrast, Hertha are 13th and yet to win a home game this season, having been thrashed 5-2 by Borussia Dortmund a fortnight ago with Erling Braut Haaland scoring four goals. Union took a gamble this season by signing the ageing Kruse, 32, a renowned card player who has competed in the World Series of poker, but the transfer has paid dividends. He made the last of his 14 appearances for Germany five years ago, yet Kruse has banged in five goals and made four assists in his last four games. He came to the rescue last Saturday by scoring twice, including a late equaliser to salvage a point in a 3-3 home draw with Eintracht Frankfurt. ""Hopefully Max will be important in the derby,"" said Union coach Urs Fischer. ""He's a great guy and he's shown that he knows when he has to work hard. I'm happy. He's there for the team and it's gone exactly as I expected."" Fischer's opposite number Bruno Labbadia made it clear how difficult it will be to stop the Union forward. ""You have to keep him in check collectively,"" added Labbadia, who is without injured Argentine midfielder Santiago Ascacibar and Colombia striker Jhon Cordoba."
12,29/11/2020,17:40,Unbeaten Leverkusen held by Hertha in stalemate,Bayer Leverkusen missed the chance to go second in the Bundesliga with a 0-0 draw at home to Hertha Berlin as Jamaica forward Leon Bailey's four-game scoring streak came to an end on Sunday.,"In-form winger Bailey has found the net five times in his last four games for Leverkusen in all competitions, but he and his colleagues were left frustrated on Sunday as Hertha took a hard-earned point back to the German capital. ""Hertha were difficult to play against, so there wasn't much more in it for us today. We had too few chances and didn't use our set-pieces,"" said Leverkusen midfielder Julian Baumgartlinger. Leverkusen had scored 18 goals in their previous five matches, but their in-form attack was held at bay by a suffocating Berlin defence on Sunday. Both Bailey and Kerem Demirbay tested goalkeeper Alexander Schwolow with long-range efforts in the first half, while Dodi Lukebakio twice came close for Hertha at the other end. Lars Bender almost snatched a late winner for Leverkusen when he flicked Demirbay's free-kick past the post from six yards out. A win would have seen Leverkusen move to within a point of league leaders Bayern Munich. Instead, they remain in third behind Bayern and RB Leipzig. Hertha, who have earned just eight points in their first nine games, will hope to put their season back on course with a win in next Friday's derby against high-flying cross-city rivals Union Berlin."

Moukoko came on after 85 minutes to replace Erling Braut Haaland, who scored four second-half goals in a stunning display. ""He's only just turned 16, that is amazing,"" Haaland said of Moukoko. ""He has a big career ahead of him."" Moukoko made his Bundesliga debut after dazzling in German youth football with a mind-blowing 47 goals in 25 matches for Dortmund U19s. He could also become the youngest player in Champions League history if he features in the home game against Brugge on Tuesday. He could beat the record held by Nigeria's Celestine Babayaro, who was 16 years, 87 days when he played for Anderlecht in 1994/95."
14,21/11/2020,23:11,Haaland scores four as Dortmund cut Bayern's lead,Erling Braut Haaland netted four goals and Youssoufa Moukoko became the youngest player in Bundesliga history on Saturday as Borussia Dortmund routed Hertha Berlin 5-2 to trim Bayern Munich's lead at the top of the table to just a point.,"It was the first time the 20-year-old Haaland had scored four goals in a game for Dortmund since his January debut, with all of them coming in the second half. ""I drank a Red Bull at half time, I got some wings and everything was good,"" said Haaland. The Norwegian now has 10 goals in seven Bundesliga matches this season to give him a total of 31 goals in 30 games in all competitions for Dortmund. After Matheus Cunha gave Hertha a first-half lead at Berlin's Olympic Stadium, Dortmund roared back. Haaland equalised when he tapped home an Emre Can pass on 47 minutes. He grabbed his second two minutes later with perfect timing to slip his marker and fire in a Julian Brandt pass. Haaland wrapped up his hat-trick on 62 minutes, just before Raphael Guerreiro stabbed the ball home from close range to make it 4-1. Cunha converted a late penalty, but the night belonged to Haaland who finished a move he started with 10 minutes to play. There was still time for history to be made as Moukoko made a late cameo off the Dortmund bench to replace Haaland. One day after his 16th birthday, Moukoko is the youngest player in Bundesliga history. ""He's only just turned 16 -- that is amazing,"" Haaland said of Moukoko. ""He has a big career ahead of him."" Dortmund's romp in Berlin moved them second in the standings, behind defending champions Bayern who stayed top despite a 1-1 home draw with Werder Bremen. Germany goalkeeper Manuel Neuer produced great stops to twice deny US forward Josh Sargent as Bremen earned their first point at Bayern for a decade. ""We had to invest a lot,"" Neuer told Sky. The 34-year-old bounced back after conceding six goals in Germany's crushing defeat by Spain in midweek with two brilliant first-half saves in quick succession. He used a boot to block a Sargent shot, then lunged across goal to save from Ludwig Augustinsson. In the dying stages, Neuer then stood tall to block a shot by Sargent, who had broken clear. Bayern coach Hansi Flick was far from pleased that Bremen took the lead in his 50th game in charge, saying his team ""have to defend better"". Bremen deservedly went ahead just before half-time when midfielder Maximilian Eggestein finished off a superb attack. ""We conceded a very cheap goal, that's how Bremen's plan worked and they defended very well,"" said Bayern forward Thomas Mueller. Kingsley Coman equalised in the 62nd minute at the Allianz Arena by meeting a Leon Goretzka cross at the far post. Bayern forward Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting fired over with the goal at his mercy five minutes from time. However, Neuer's heroics at the other end preserved the draw. Bayer Leverkusen are third after their 2-1 win at strugglers Arminia Bielefeld thanks to Aleksandar Dragovic's late winner. The victory was a relief for Leverkusen goalkeeper Lukas Hradecky, who scored a embarrassing own goal early in the second half. Leverkusen were 1-0 up thanks to a Leon Bailey goal when Hradecky sliced a clearance, which rolled into the empty net behind him. Dragovic stabbed home from close range two minutes from time to spare Hradecky's blushes. RB Leipzig sit fourth after Yussuf Poulsen came off the bench and produced a deft second-half volley in their 1-1 draw at Eintracht Frankfurt after winger Aymen Barkok gave the hosts an early lead. Despite having seven players quarantined with the coronavirus, a depleted Hoffenheim drew 3-3 at home with Stuttgart. Schalke's winless run stretched to 24 league games, dating back to January, after losing 2-0 at home to Wolfsburg. A Daniel Caligiuri equaliser two minutes from time gave 10-man Augsburg a 1-1 draw at Borussia Moenchengladbach."
15,16/11/2020,17:04,Haaland's Dortmund set to defy Norway isolation order,"Dortmund, Leipzig and Hertha Berlin look set to defy a call for 10 days of self-isolation for their Norwegian players, including Dortmund's Erling Haaland, after a member of the national squad tested positive for Covid-19.","Adhering to the request from the Norwegian football federation would prevent Haaland from playing for Dortmund on Saturday, as it would do too for Leipzig striker Alexander Sorloth and Hertha Berlin goalkeeper Rune Jarstein. Norway full-back Omar Elabdellaoui tested positive at the weekend prompting Norway to cancel their trip to Bucharest to play Romania, and UEFA then cancelled the game. There is a 10-day self-isolation strategy in Norway, but the Bundesliga clubs are suggesting that once the players are back in Germany they are subject to local protocol. The football federation in Norway says their players have all signed written documents promising to follow their code. ""German law applies on German soil,"" Dortmund insisted Monday, who travel to Berlin to play Hertha on Saturday. Hertha Berlin explained their position in local law terms ""once Rune has returned two negative tests he'll be back with the group"". RB Leipzig are voicing a similar argument. Meanwhile the Scandinavians have assembled an entire new squad including 13 uncapped players for Wednesday's match against Austria in Vienna that Norway must win to finish top of their Nations League group."
16,07/11/2020,18:33,"Leipzig go top in Germany ahead of Bayern, Dortmund showdown",RB Leipzig went back to the top of the Bundesliga table on Saturday with a 3-0 home win over Freiburg before Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund clash in the evening showdown.,"Defender Ibrahima Konate fired home Leipzig's opener before midfielder Marcel Sabitzer added their second goal with a 70th-minute penalty. Manchester City loanee Angelino claimed Leipzig's third with a stunning free-kick which curled over the Freiburg wall just before the final whistle. The home win put Leipzig top, a point ahead of Bayern and Dortmund who meet later at Signal Iduna Park. ""We really deserved the win - we were very, very good in the first-half,"" said Leipzig head coach Julian Nagelsmann. He was especially pleased with Konate's opening goal from a towering cross before winger Christopher Nkunku, who scored in the mid-week win over Paris Saint Germain, won the penalty which Sabitzer converted after the VAR scrutinised the decision. ""We have trained a lot from set pieces,"" said Nagelsmann. ""It certainly wasn't an obvious penalty, but if the VAR says it was, then it must have been,"" he added after Nkunku went down after the slightest of touches from Freiburg defender Nicolas Hoefler. Union Berlin climbed to fourth with a 5-0 home thrashing of strugglers Arminia Bielefeld. Former Germany striker Max Kruse helped set up Union's first three goals, then converted a late penalty. After just three minutes, Japan winger Keita Endo scored his first goal for Union when he swept home Sheraldo Becker's final pass after Kruse's superb long pass. Endo went off with an injury soon after, but Union kept up the pressure as Kruse set up the next two goals for centre-back Robert Andrich and winger Becker. Kruse, 32, capped an outstanding display by converting a penalty before Cedric Teuchert, a right wing replacement for Becker, grabbed Union's late fourth goal. At the other end of the table, bottom side Mainz were held to a 2-2 draw at home to Schalke, who sit one place above them and have now gone 23 games without a league win dating back to January. After Daniel Brosinski and Jean-Philippe Mateta converted penalties for Mainz, Mark Uth pulled a goal back for Schalke who were 2-1 down late on. Schalke took a deserved point back to Gelsenkirchen when Mainz defender Jeremiah St. Juste turned the ball into his own net eight minutes from time. After five games without a win, Hertha Berlin roared back with a 3-0 win in the fog at Augsburg. Forwards Matheus Cunha, Dodi Lukebakio and Krzysztof Piatek, who cost Hertha 24 million euros ($28 million) from AC Milan in January, got on the scoresheet as Augsburg's defence crumbled."
17,01/11/2020,20:27,Hertha held on Guendouzi debut,"Arsenal loanee Matteo Guendouzi made his Bundesliga debut on Sunday as Hertha Berlin were held to a 1-1 draw at home to Wolfsburg, while Bayer Leverkusen came from behind to beat Freiburg.","Guendouzi replaced fellow Frenchman Lucas Tousart just before the hour mark and was booked for dissent in stoppage time in his first competitive appearance since June. The curly-haired midfielder joined Hertha on loan in October having fallen out of favour at Arsenal, but was forced to delay his return to action after testing positive for coronavirus. He finally made his debut in Berlin's empty Olympic stadium on Sunday, helping Hertha to end a four-game losing streak and pick up their first point since the opening weekend. ""It's not an easy situation, but we have to stay positive. We have a lot of new players in the side, and we need to get to know each other on the pitch,"" Hertha midfielder Vladimir Darida told Sky. Matheus Cunha gave Hertha the lead after less than six minutes, squeezing a low shot inside the post from the edge of the area despite slipping on the turf as he struck the ball. Ridle Baku levelled the scores with a sweetly struck shot on 20 minutes, smashing the ball into the roof of the net from 18 yards out to score his first goal for Wolfsburg since joining the club in October. Earlier Sunday, Argentina striker Lucas Alario continued his fine run of form with two crucial first-half goals as Bayer Leverkusen saw off Freiburg 4-2. After a disastrous first half-hour for Leverkusen, Alario struck twice before the break to turn the game on its head and fire his team back into the top four. ""It was a strange match in which we started badly. Normally you can't turn games like that around, but Lucas's goals really helped us,"" said Leverkusen coach Peter Bosz. The Argentine now has seven goals from eight games in all competitions, and has found the net in each of his last three league appearances. Leverkusen, meanwhile, remain the only Bundesliga team yet to be beaten after the first six games of the season. Freiburg took the lead on just three minutes, Lucas Hoeler latching onto a 50-yard through ball from Lukas Kuebler and flicking the ball past Leverkusen keeper Lukas Hradecky. Leverkusen were bracing themselves for a long afternoon when Sven Bender was shown a red card for a trip on Hoeler in front of goal, but the decision was reversed by VAR. Having ridden their luck in the first half-hour, Leverkusen ruthlessly took their chances from then on, with Alario turning the game on its head with two quick goals before half-time. The Argentine pounced on a misplaced pass from Nicolas Hoefler to slot home the equaliser, before turning in a low cross from Lars Bender to put Leverkusen ahead just minutes before the break. Bosz's side looked to be in the clear when Nadiem Amiri smashed in a third on 65 minutes, but a tap-in from substitute Nils Petersen quickly brought Freiburg back into the game. Yet the home side's revival was short-lived, as centre-back Jonathan Tah rose high at a corner to head in Leverkusen's fourth and seal the three points. While Leverkusen return to the top four, Freiburg now sit just three places adrift of the bottom three, having not won since the opening day of the season."
18,24/10/2020,18:30,Lewandowski hits hat-trick as Bayern Munich rout Frankfurt,Robert Lewandowski took his Bundesliga tally to 10 goals in five games this season with a hat-trick as Bayern Munich thumped Eintracht Frankfurt 5-0 on Saturday.,"Lewandowski has scored nine goals in his last three league games and wrapped up his treble within an hour at the Allianz Arena. Defending champions Bayern have scored 22 goals this term -- 10 more than league leaders RB Leipzig who stayed top with a 2-1 win over 10-man Hertha Berlin. Bayern sit one point behind in second place. In Munich, Leroy Sane marked his return from injury with the fourth goal during a brief cameo, before England Under-17 midfielder Jamal Musiala also came off the bench to net the fifth. However, Bayern's victory could come at a price as Canadian left-back Alphonso Davies was in clear distress after going off early with an ankle injury. Lewandowski underlined his status as one of the world's best strikers last season by scoring a career-best 55 goals in 47 games, including 34 in the Bundesliga. The Polish international opened the scoring on 10 minutes when he fired home after a Thomas Mueller pass. Frankfurt goalkeeper Kevin Trapp couldn't do anything to stop Lewandowski's header from a Joshua Kimmich corner in the 26th minute. Bayern had a penalty appeal turned down when Douglas Costa's cross clipped the hand of Frankfurt's Makoto Hasebe. Lewandowski wrapped up the victory on the hour mark with a clinical finish from another Costa cross. After sitting out the last two games, Sane ghosted past a defender and drove a shot into the bottom corner with 18 minutes to play. Manuel Neuer pulled off a great save to deny Frankfurt striker Bas Dost before Musiala grabbed the final goal as the visitors suffered their first league defeat of the season. Leipzig came from behind to seal a 2-1 win over Hertha, whose Colombian striker Jhon Cordoba scored in the eighth minute. Leipzig drew level when defender Dayot Upamecano fired home from a free-kick on 11 minutes, but Berlin were reduced to 10 men after the break when substitute Deyovaisio Zeefuik was shown two yellow cards within four minutes of coming on. Leipzig made the man advantage count when Marcel Sabitzer converted a penalty with 13 minutes left. Hertha were lucky not to finish with nine men when another sub, Jessic Ngankam, scythed down Leipzig left-back Angelino and the referee changed his decision to a yellow card having initially showed a straight red. Borussia Moenchengladbach warmed up for Tuesday's Champions League game at home to Real Madrid with a 3-2 comeback win at Mainz. Germany midfielder Lars Stindl gave Gladbach an early lead, but the visitors were 2-1 down at half-time after French striker Jean-Philippe Mateta scored twice for Mainz. Gladbach midfielder Jonas Hofmann converted a penalty on 76 minutes, after a shot by replacement Marcus Thuram was blocked by a Mainz hand before Matthias Ginter headed the winner as Gladbach climbed to fifth. Union Berlin were held to a 1-1 draw at home to Freiburg as Vincenzo Grifo's first-half goal was cancelled out two minutes later by Union midfielder Robert Andrich."

""Discussions with the club's senior figures convinced me to join,"" said Guendouzi in a statement. ""I don't just want to develop personally, but help the whole club take the next step.""

A maximum of 4,000 spectators were allowed into the Olympiastadion due to the coronavirus restrictions. Hertha coach Bruno Labbadia kept faith in his lineup from the victory over Werder Bremen in the opening round of the season. Matheus Cunha started in midfield after being called up to Brazil's squad earlier in the day for next month's World Cup qualifiers. Adi Huetter made two changes from last weekend's 1-1 draw against promoted Arminia Bielefeld as goal scorer Andre Silva kept his place up front. After a quiet opening 25 minutes which failed to produce a shot on target Silva won a spot kick after Dedryck Boyata's careless tackle. The Portugal forward converted to score his third goal in as many games since joining Eintracht on a permanent deal from AC Milan earlier this month on the half hour mark. The visitors doubled their advantage seven minutes later as Dost claimed his second of the season and Kamada's first assist of proceedings. The Netherlands striker rose highest inside the Hertha box to head home Samurai Blue midfielder Kamada's free kick. Kamada, 24, was the provider for his side's third with 20 minutes to play.

""It was a really good start to the season. We have a lot of young guys, it's fun to play with guys near my age,"" said USA Under-17 international Reyna. ""This is an exciting group and we have to keep working."" Haaland converted a second-half penalty, then again showcased his clinical eye for goal by finishing a superb counter as Dortmund attacked from their own goal. Coach Lucien Favre banked on youth by starting two 17-year-olds in Reyna and England Under-21 midfielder Jude Bellingham, who made his league debut, with Sancho and Haaland, both 20, leading Dortmund's attack. Reyna, making just his third league start, paid back the faith by scoring the opening goal and winning the penalty Haaland converted. Reyna drilled home Bellingham's superb pass from a tight ankle on 34 minutes, then had his ankle clipped after a darting run into the area to win the penalty for Haaland. Sancho tried to convince Haaland to let him take the spot-kick, but ""I was confident whoever took it, would score, which is the most important thing"" said Reyna. Haaland then stole the show with a stunning end-to-end sprint to support Sancho's break before crashing home Dortmund's third goal on 78 minutes. The towering Norwegian, the first player in Bundesliga history to score a hat-trick from the bench, now has 18 goals in 20 games for Dortmund since his arrival in January. For the first time since March, some German league clubs were able to welcome back limited numbers of fans, depending on permission from local health authorities. The biggest crowd of the day was in Dortmund, as 9,300 cheered the impressive home win. ""It's amazing to have fans back, they support us so much,"" added Reyna. Having finished runners-up to Bayern for the last two seasons, Dortmund are on a collision course with the European champions who they meet in the German Super Cup showdown on September 30 in Munich. Earlier, Hertha Berlin's new-signing Jhon Cordoba scored on his debut in a 4-1 away romp at Werder Bremen as the ambitious capital city club also threw down an early marker. In front of 8,500 in Bremen, Hertha defender Peter Pekarik and Belgian-born winger Dodi Lukebakio scored quick-fire goals at the end of the first half to leave Werder 2-0 down at the break and the hosts were whistled off the pitch by their own fans. Colombia striker Cordoba, signed from Cologne in mid-week, came on to start the move which Brazil Under-23 forward Matheus Cunha finished as Hertha went 3-0 up with an hour gone. Davie Selke scored Bremen's second-half consolation goal before Cordoba capped his debut by tucking home Hertha's fourth goal on 90 minutes. Just like Bayern, Cologne also had to play behind closed doors due to a rising rate of infection for their 3-2 home defeat to Hoffenheim, for whom Andrej Kramaric scored a hat-trick. The Croatia striker put the visitors ahead after three minutes following a mix up in defence, netted a penalty and smashed home the winning goal in added time after Cologne had launched a late fight back. In the capital, playmaker Michael Gregoritsch and winger Andre Hahn scored late goals as Augsburg beat hosts Union Berlin 3-1 in front of 4,600 fans. Newly-promoted Arminia Bielefeld earned a point with a 1-1 draw at Eintracht Frankfurt on their return to the top flight in front of 6,500. Stuttgart, who also came up, gave Freiburg a scare with late goals by Sasa Kalajdzic and Silas Wamangituka as they fought back in a 3-2 defeat in front of 8,000."

Florian Kohfeldt's Werder will face second-tier opponents in either Heidenheim or possibly neighbours, rivals and fellow fallen giants Hamburg in the play-off first leg on Thursday. Bremen have spent more seasons than any other team in the Bundesliga, having only spent one term in the second tier, in 1980-81. A burst of goals from Osako, Milot Rashica and Niclas Fuellkrug -- all in the space of eight minutes -- had Werder 3-0 up at the break against Cologne at the Weserstadion. Former Everton midfielder Davy Klaassen then fired home a rebound just after the break before Osako, facing his old side, added his second and USA international Josh Sargent completed the rout. Dominick Drexler pulled a goal back for Cologne. Werder, the four-time Bundesliga champions, also needed a favour from Berlin and got one as Union beat Fortuna 3-0 with goals from Nigerian duo Anthony Ujah and Suleiman Abdullahi either side of veteran midfielder Christian Gentner's effort. Bremen will find out their play-off opponents on Sunday, with Heidenheim currently in the play-off place ahead of the final round of matches in the second division. At Wolfsburg, Bayern striker Robert Lewandowski scored a penalty for his 34th league goal of the season, finishing as the top scorer for the fifth time. Kingsley Coman, Michael Cuisance and Thomas Mueller also got on the scoresheet as Bayern, champions for the eighth straight season, finished 13 points clear of second-placed Borussia Dortmund. Mueller set up Coman for Bayern's opening goal to finish the campaign with a league record 21 assists, and his goal that rounded out the win was also Bayern's 100th league goal this season -- one short of the Bundesliga record. Wolfsburg captain Josuha Guilavogui was sent off for a second yellow card after fouling Cuisance, leading to Lewandowski's penalty. Meanwhile, Borussia Moenchengladbach and RB Leipzig secured qualification for next season's Champions League after 2-1 wins over Hertha Berlin and Augsburg respectively, as fifth-placed Bayer Leverkusen missed out by two points despite beating Mainz 1-0. Dortmund, who had already wrapped up second place, crashed to a 4-0 home defeat by Hoffenheim, for whom Croatia striker Andrej Kramaric scored all four goals, including one penalty. That result allowed Hoffenheim to leapfrog Wolfsburg and take sixth place, although both sides will go into the Europa League next season along with Leverkusen. Before kick-off in Dortmund, Mario Goetze, whose winning goal sealed Germany's victory in the 2014 World Cup final, was given a send-off by the club. He will leave this summer with his contract having expired, but the 28-year-old attacking midfielder has not announced his future club. Elsewhere, Timo Werner signed off with a brace in RB Leipzig's 2-1 win at Augsburg in what was his final appearance for the club before moving to Chelsea. Schalke's disastrous second half of the season was completed with a 4-0 thrashing at the hands of Freiburg as they finished the season 12th, having been third in December. Eintracht Frankfurt beat bottom side Paderborn 3-2 in Saturday's other game."

Dortmund players also donned T-shirts with slogans against racism and police brutality during their pre-match warm-up. Elsewhere on Saturday, Bayern Munich players wore black armbands with the message ""Black Lives Matter"", while Mainz striker Pierre Kunde Malong took a knee after scoring in his side's 2-0 win over Frankfurt."

With five games left, Bayern, who have won their last eight league games, are comfortably on course for an eighth straight league title. However, second-placed Borussia Dortmund could trim their lead on Sunday at bottom side Paderborn. Several records fell as Lewandowski now has 43 goals in all competitions, a season's best for the Poland striker with games in hand. Also head coach Hansi Flick claimed his 22nd win in his first 25 games, bettering the start made by Pep Guardiola when he took charge in 2013. ""Statistics and records don't interest me, what's important is to have a successful season,"" said Flick, in his first season since replacing Niko Kovac in November. ""At Bayern Munich, you are expected to win. I am very happy, we were very aggressive and didn't give them any chances."" Lewandowski, who had never previously scored in six games against Duesseldorf, made amends with goals either side of half-time. Fortuna, who were unbeaten in their three games since the league resumed after a two-month coronavirus-enforced hiatus, were humbled at the Allianz Arena where they last poached a 3-3 draw in November 2018. They fell behind on 15 minutes when Joergensen turned the ball into his own net after Pavard mishit his shot. Right-back Pavard then grabbed the second with a powerful header on 29 minutes before Lewandowski made it 3-0 just before the break after being presented with a tap-in by Thomas Mueller. Duesseldorf were floored with two goals in as many minutes as Lewandowski profited again with another poacher's goal after Serge Gnabry's good work. Davies then scored the game's best goal. After some high pressing, the Canadian teen won the ball in the Duesseldorf area, barged past a succession of defenders and fired home to make it 5-0 on 52 minutes. Werder Bremen boosted their survival hopes with a 1-0 win at Schalke, who are winless in 11 games and continue to plummet. Midfielder Leonardo Bittencourt scored a first-half winner. ""This is a very, very important away win,"" said Bremen coach Florian Kohfeldt. ""We have taken seven points from the last three games, but if you look at the table, we are still behind."" Bremen have spent more seasons in the Bundesliga than any other club, but currently sit second from bottom. However, Saturday's victory leaves them just three points from guaranteed safety with six games left. They are two points behind Duesseldorf in 16th, which carries a relegation play-off at the end of the season. Werder could climb out of the relegation places for the first time since December on Wednesday if they beat Eintracht Frankfurt at home. Bittencourt hit a stunning strike from just outside the box which beat Schalke's Bayern-bound goalkeeper Alexander Nuebel on 32 minutes. Schalke succumbed to their fourth straight defeat, piling pressure on head coach David Wagner. In the same game, Schalke's American midfielder Weston McKennie wore a 'Justice for George' armband as part of the growing protests over the death of an unarmed black man during a police arrest in the United States. ""To be able to use my platform to bring attention to a problem that has been going on too long feels good!!!,"" tweeted 21-year-old McKennie. ""We have to stand up for what we believe in and I believe that it is time that we are heard."" George Floyd died in Minneapolis in an arrest by a police officer who pinned him to the ground for several minutes by kneeling on his neck. Hertha remain unbeaten with three wins and a draw since Bruno Labbadia took charge during the lockdown after their 2-0 win at home to Augsburg thanks for goals by Javairo Dilrosun and Krzysztof Piatek. Having routed Leverkusen 4-1 away on Tuesday, Wolfsburg crashed to a 2-1 defeat at home to 10-man Eintracht Frankfurt. Japan midfielder Daichi Kamada scored the winner 10 minutes from time while Frankfurt had replacement midfielder Lucas Torro sent off in the dying stages for a second yellow card. Frankfurt took the lead when striker Andre Silva converted a penalty on 27 minutes, but Wolfsburg equalised when right-back Kevin Mbabu headed home on 58 minutes. Hoffenheim are seventh after their 1-0 win at Mainz thanks to Ihlas Bebou who darted into the area, swept past two defenders, and fired home on 43 minutes. On Friday, Leverkusen went third when Germany midfielder Kai Havertz became the first player in Bundesliga history to score 35 goals before his 21st birthday to seal a 1-0 win at Freiburg."
27,27/05/2020,23:03,'Like a school team': Nagelsmann slams ten-man Leipzig after Hertha draw,"Julian Nagelsman slammed 10-man RB Leipzig for defending like ""a school team"" in Wednesday's 2-2 draw at home to Hertha Berlin behind closed doors which cost them the chance to go second in the Bundesliga.","Hertha forward Krzysztof Piatek equalised with a late penalty to seal the draw and save the blushes of goalkeeper Rune Jarstein who had made a blunder for Leipzig's second goal. However, Nagelsmann was furious that Leipzig conceded a weak goal from a corner with only nine minutes gone when Hertha midfielder Marko Grujic, on loan from Liverpool, fired home unmarked. ""We started well, but fell behind because we defend a set piece like a school team,"" fumed Nagelsmann. ""We simply did nothing, everyone is standing in position, yet he (Grujic) could finish with his foot, in the box. ""This is the second time in a row in a home game that we conceded from a set piece,"" said Nagelsmann whose team drew 1-1 against Freiburg in their last home game. ""We have to blame ourselves for this. We're happy that we scored another point, but I'm not happy at all."" Piatek, who joined Hertha in January for around 25 million euros ($27 million) from AC Milan, netted his second goal in nine Bundesliga matches when he fired home a penalty on 82 minutes. Piatek's penalty snatched a point, stretched Bruno Labbadia's unbeaten record as Hertha head coach to three games and spared the blushes of Jarstein. The Norwegian shot-stopper was embarrassed when he parried an effort by Leipzig striker Patrik Schick but allowed the ball to roll over his flailing arm and into his net to make it 2-1 on 68 minutes. Leipzig had just been reduced to 10 men when defender Marcel Halstenberg was sent off for a second yellow card after a late foul on Brazil Under-23 striker Cunha, who was playing against the club he left in January. The first-half finished 1-1 after Hertha took an early lead when Grujic volleyed into the top corner with nine minutes gone. The hosts fought back and equalised when defender Lukas Klostermann headed home a corner with 24 minutes gone. The result leaves Leipzig third in the table, two points behind Dortmund, beaten 1-0 on Tuesday by leaders Bayern Munich who are seven points clear and on course for an eighth straight German league title. ""Today it (three points) was on a silver platter and we didn't take it,"" added Nagelsmann. Schalke are winless in ten games as their free fall down the table continued with a 2-1 defeat at relegation-threatened Fortuna Duesseldorf. US midfielder Weston McKennie gave Schalke the lead just after the break with a diving header, but Fortuna hit back with two goals in five minutes from Rouwen Hennings and Kenan Karaman. Schalke's third straight defeat leaves them ninth having been third in December. Cologne striker Mark Uth failed to convert a penalty for the second game in a row in his side's 3-1 defeat at Hoffenheim as both teams finished with ten men. Austria midfielder Christoph Baumgartner could have finished with a hat-trick after opening the scoring early on, had a goal ruled offside then scored with a header just after the break. Cologne were reduced to 10 men when Belgian defender Sebastian Bornauw was shown a straight red for fouling Baumgartner, who set up defender Steven Zuber to leave Hoffenheim 3-0 up early in the second-half. Hoffenheim had defender Benjamin Huebner sent off for a second yellow card on 51 minutes before Florian Kainz gave Cologne hope with a goal on the hour mark. Uth, who also had a penalty saved in Sunday's draw with Duesseldorf, had his spot-kick saved on 77 minutes when Hoffenheim goalkeeper Oliver Baumann guessed the right corner. Bottom side Paderborn earned a point in a goalless draw at Augsburg, while mid-table Union Berlin drew 1-1 with Mainz in the capital."

""It would have been fantastic if we could have played a game like that in front of 75,000 spectators. But I hope that the fans at least had fun in front of their TVs,"" said Hertha coach Bruno Labbadia. ""In the first half we played very well against well-organised opponents. I had to make that clear to my team at half-time because they were feeling a bit negative. ""By the end we were happy because these were important points in the relegation battle."" Labbadia started Czech Republic midfielder Vladimir Darida in the only change from last Saturday's win at Hoffenheim in his first home match in charge. Union's Urs Fischer, who guided the east Berlin outfit to the top-flight for the first time this season, brought in four fresh faces to his starting lineup after Sunday's loss to champions Bayern Munich. A minute silence was held before kick-off at the eerily quiet ground in the German capital in remembrance of all victims of COVID-19. The best chance of the opening 20 minutes, which were dominated by Labbadia's men, fell to winger Lukebakio but the DR Congo international's effort was saved by Rafal Gikiewicz. Labbadia's side continued their dominance into the second half. Lukebakio was stopped two minutes into second half again by Gikiewicz before captain Ibisevic headed home a powerful opener. Just 70 seconds later Hertha doubled their lead as Bosnia-Herzegovina forward Ibisevic fed Lukebakio who got the better of Gikiewicz with a side-footed effort. Both goals were greeted by the Hertha club anthem echoing around the ground built for the 1936 Olympics as it was played on the public address system. Labbadia celebrated by elbow bumping with his coaching staff as did his players on the field. Hertha added a third on the hour mark as Brazilian playmaker Matheus Cunha scored his fourth goal of the season. Lukebakio missed with an ambitious overhead kick inside the box and Cunha, who joined from RB Leipzig in January, side-footed home from outside the area after 62 minutes. Centre-back Boyata, who apologised for breaching virus-related league protocol after grabbing the face of team-mate Marko Grujic during last weekend's win, claimed a fourth with 13 minutes to play. The Belgium defender celebrated by kissing his elbows and chest-bumping team-mates including Jordan Torunarigha as they clinched revenge after November's derby defeat, the first time the sides had met in the German top-flight. ""We laid it on a plate for Hertha. But we've lost one game, nothing more, nothing less,"" said Union coach Fischer. On Saturday, second-placed Borussia Dortmund can close the gap to a point on leaders Bayern Munich with a win over Wolfsburg. Bayern host Eintracht Frankfurt in 13th spot later in the day. Elsewhere, Borussia Moenchengladbach will place 13,000 cut-out images of fans in their stadium for the visit of Bayer Leverkusen."

Yet, while players in other games celebrated with elbow taps or solo dance routines, Hertha's players hugged and kissed as they won, 3-0, in Hoffenheim. Hertha started the game 13th in the table with only seven wins in 25 games and under new management. Their Belgian defender Dedryck Boyata kissed team-mate Marko Grujic on the cheek after their team's first goal. ""The fact is that this is part of football,"" said Bruno Labbadia, who was named as Jurgen Klinsmann's replacement during the lockdown. ""We've been tested so many times that we can allow it."" ""If you can't celebrate anymore, the whole thing breaks down. I'm just glad that the team had reason to cheer today."" ""Emotions are part of the game."" The German Football League (DFL) had presented the German authorities with a 51-page document, which convinced the federal government and regions that football could be allowed to resume behind closed doors. In an accompanying document sent to clubs, the DFL said hugging and hand contact in celebration of goals should be avoided and that preference should be given to ""elbow or foot contact"". But on Saturday, a DFL spokesman confirmed there would be no punishment, as it had only offered ""guidelines"" on how goals should be celebrated. ""For celebrations, only advice has been given and therefore there can be no sanctions,"" a DFL spokesman said. As part of its programme to ensure a safe return, the DFL has tested players and coaches regularly for the virus and teams have been in quarantine for the past week."

But we have to see how it goes,"" Jens Spahn told radio station Deutschlandfunk on Tuesday. The German Football League (DFL) hopes on Wednesday to get the go-ahead to restart the season from May 15 when Chancellor Angela Merkel's meets the 16 state leaders via a conference call. However, the restart plans were thrown into question on Monday when testing of players, coaches and backroom staff produced 10 positive cases, three of which came from top-flight side Cologne. It also emerged that not all players are following the league's strict hygiene guidelines. Hertha Berlin suspended Ivory Coast striker Salomon Kalou on Monday after the ex-Chelsea forward posted a video of him shaking hands with team-mates at training, violating hygiene guidelines. Hertha immediately suspended Kalou, 34, who is out of contract at the end of the season, and Spahn welcomed the sanctions. ""It was important that the club show there were consequences after this video,"" added Spahn. ""And I hope that everyone has now understood that this is about something serious."" Germany has been less affected by the pandemic than other European countries, with 163,860 cases and 6,831 deaths, figures partly attributed to mass testing. A DFL task force has drawn up a hygiene concept, involving regular testing for all 36 clubs in the top two leagues, which has been backed by a host of key politicians. Both Spahn and Horst Seehofer, Germany's minister for sport and the interior, have given their approval as have the premier ministers of football hotbeds Bavaria and North Rhine-Westfalia. Should German football resume, Spahn said the Bundesliga could become an ""export hit"" as the first of Europe's top five leagues to restart. ""I think it makes sense for professional sports to come step-by-step into a new, everyday life, but we have to see what happens,"" Spahn added. ""The clubs must be able to guarantee that their players, regardless of how young or old they are, follow the rules."""

""The pictures of Salomon Kalou from the Hertha dressing room are absolutely unacceptable,"" the German Football League (DFL) said in a statement. Hertha said they had suspended the 34-year-old Ivory Coast international ""with immediate effect"". Kalou, who won the Premier League with the Blues in 2010, apologised for his actions and said he should have known better because of his involvement in health projects in his homeland. ""I am sorry if my behaviour has given the impression that I do not take Corona seriously. I would like to apologise for this,"" he said. ""The opposite is true, because I am particularly concerned about the people in Africa, because the medical care there is by far not as good as in Germany. ""I did not really think about it.""

According to newspaper Bild and football magazine Kicker, 52-year-old Labbadia will sign a contract until 2022 to oversee preparations should the German league resume next month after being halted on March 13 due to the coronavirus pandemic. The former Wolfsburg and Hamburg coach will be the fourth different person to occupy the Hertha dugout this season, and will charged with saving a miserable season for the capital city club. Hertha, who are backed by a wealthy investor, are 14th in the table, six points from the relegation places with nine games left. Labbadia has recent experience of avoiding relegation having kept Wolfsburg up in 2017-18 before guiding them to a Europa League place the following season. Like most of the top-flight clubs, Hertha returned to training this week for the first time since the competition was stopped because of the virus. However, Hertha's caretaker coach Alexander Nouri was not involved as he remained with his family in Bremen. Nouri was named in a caretaker capacity in mid-February when Klinsmann, a former USA and Germany head coach, walked out after just 76 days in charge. The former Bayern Munich and Tottenham star was brought in as a short-term solution in November after Hertha made a disastrous start to the season under former coach Ante Covic."

Haaland, who scored twice in Tuesday's Champions League last 16, first-leg win over Paris Saint-Germain, also netted 28 goals for Salzburg before joining Dortmund for 20 million euros ($22 million) in December. Dortmund ground out victory after showing some early nerves in Bremen where they crashed to a 3-2 German Cup defeat earlier this month. ""We allowed them almost nothing and controlled the game more in the second half,"" said Dortmund's midfielder Emre Can. ""Then Bremen got tired and we scored our goals at the right time."" Centre-back Dan-Axel Zagadou gave the visitors the lead by volleying home a Jadon Sancho corner on 52 minutes. ""Another crappy goal conceded from a dead-ball situation. It's getting very tight for us now,"" said Bremen's Dutch midfielder Davy Klaassen whose side are second from bottom. Haaland doubled the advantage by drilling Achraf Hakimi's square ball into the corner on 66 minutes to score his ninth Bundesliga goal. After five straight league defeats, Bremen remain 17th and five points from safety. They suffered another blow in the relegation battle as Fortuna Duesseldorf, who are a place above them, enjoyed a 2-0 win at Freiburg. Dortmund climbed above RB Leipzig on goal difference. Julian Nagelsmann's Leipzig can move back to within one point of Bayern, who beat bottom side Paderborn 3-2 on Friday, when they visit Schalke later on Saturday. Fourth-placed Borussia Moenchengladbach slipped six points behind Bayern, albeit with a game in hand, as Lucas Ribeiro's injury-time strike snatched Hoffenheim a 1-1 draw at Borussia Park. Matthias Ginter had powered in an early opener for Gladbach, but the hosts were made to pay after Alassane Plea saw a 75th-minute penalty saved by Hoffenheim goalkeeper Oliver Baumann. Despite splashing out 77 million euros ($83 million) on transfers in January, Hertha Berlin's poor form continued in a 5-0 thrashing at home to Cologne. Hertha were brought crashing back down to earth after Alexander Nouri won his first game in charge following Jurgen Klinsmann's shock resignation last weekend at Paderborn. The home side defended woefully and were 2-0 down inside 22 minutes as Jhon Cordoba scored an early double. The Colombian striker exploited a four-on-two situation for his first goal and easily escaped his marker to head in the second. Midfielder Florian Kanz added two goals of his own before Mark Uth curled home a free-kick 20 minutes from time as Hertha capitulated."

""It's going to be difficult now"" for Klinsmann to coach again in the Bundesliga, Matthaeus, 58, wrote of his fellow 1990 World Cup winner in daily newspaper Bild in mid-week. ""Clubs who are looking for a coach will think hard. ""If you quit after 10 weeks, after this big investment, after this great euphoria that you yourself created, then the name 'Klinsmann' has probably dropped a peg or two at other clubs."" Klinsmann's sudden exit came in the wake of last Saturday's woeful 3-1 defeat at home to Mainz, which left Hertha six points from the relegation places in the German top-flight. ""Jurgen Klinsmann's tasteless departure from Hertha Berlin will mean that he will almost certainly never again be able to show his face as a coach in Germany,"" Bild insisted in Friday's editorial. ""Can you put the fate of a club in Klinsmann's hands? Hertha answered the question with 'no'."" In a video post on Tuesday, Klinsmann, who coached hosts Germany to third at the 2006 World Cup and took the USA to the last 16 of the Brazil 2014 finals, admitted his exit was ""questionable"". He said he should have ""taken more time, spoken more with"" Hertha's senior figures, hinting at a power struggle and said he wanted to return to his previous role on the club's supervisory board. However, in a press conference on Thursday, Hertha's muti-millionaire investor Lars Windhorst swiftly blocked the idea. ""The manner of his departure is unacceptable,"" fumed the entrepeneur Windhorst, who holds a 49.9 percent stake in Hertha. ""We cannot continue a purposeful cooperation with him in this way."" Windhorst also slammed the former forward's behaviour as ""something you can do in your youth, but not as an adult"", prompting magazine Kicker to comment ""Windhorst and Klinsmann: like a father with a pubescent son"". Klinsmann's assistant Alexander Nouri is now in charge as caretaker coach, starting with Saturday's league match at bottom side Paderborn. The swift departure of Klinsmann also followed massive investment in the January transfer window. A reported figure of 77 million euros ($83 million) was spent on fresh talent, including AC Milan striker Krzysztof Piatek and Brazil forward Matheus Cunha from league rivals RB Leipzig. Although Windhorst left open the possibility of working with Klinsmann in the future, he added ""by leaving, he has lost a lot of credibility here at Hertha"". Both of Klinsmann's two coaching jobs in the Bundesliga have been brief as he was sacked by Bayern Munich in 2009 after just 10 months in charge. An issue for Klinsmann at Hertha was he wanted to be an English-style manager, responsible for coaching the team and also for player transfers. In Germany, the buying and selling of players is normally handled by a sports director or a team manager, not the coach. However, Klinsmann wanted autonomy - which put him in dispute with Hertha's general manager Michael Preetz. Refering to Liverpool's German manager Jurgen Klopp, who is on the verge of bringing the Premier League title to Merseyside for the first time in 30 years, Bild had a direct message for Klinsmann. ""With regard to the coach/manager position, one has to say: You are not like Klopp, you are only Klinsmann."""

Police in Gelsenkirchen and the German Football Association (DFB) had already started investigations. On Thursday, Torunarigha slammed the ""idiots"" responsible on social media. ""I was born in Chemnitz and already went through all that in my youth,"" he wrote on Instagram. ""My parents were insulted. That's why a situation like Schalke's upsets me so much. ""You can't choose your skin colour at birth, and it shouldn't matter at all."" According to Hertha's statement to the DFB, the racist abuse was heard in the 84th minute and came from block S5 at the Veltins Arena in Gelsenkirchen. Schalke have asked their fans for help finding the culprits, who are threatened with stadium bans and their membership cancelled, if they are club members. Former Schalke captain and 2014 World Cup winner Benedikt Hoewedes has said there can be no place for racism in German football.

The English youngster came off the bench to add to Nadiem Amiri's first-half opener and seal three crucial points in the race for European qualification. Only two points separate sixth-place Hoffenheim from Wolfsburg in ninth, with Werder Bremen and Bayer Leverkusen also in the running for a Europa League spot. Hoffenheim were utterly dominant first 20 minutes, but somehow conspired not to score, twice hitting the woodwork and missing several chances from point-blank range. Amiri broke the deadlock after half an hour, smashing the ball in off the post with his side's 14th shot on goal. Hoffenheim were twice denied by goalie Rune Jarstein in the second-half, before Nelson headed in the second goal of the day on the counter-attack. The goal, which was given by VAR after being initially ruled out for offside, was Nelson's first since his explosive run of form at the beginning of the season."

Hertha was born on December 1 in the city's Tierpark zoo and is the heir to late lamented superstar Knut, who drew huge crowds to a rival zoo, Berlin's Zoological Garden, until he died suddenly in 2011. After the eagerly anticipated announcement the football club quickly unveiled posters showing off Hertha under the slogan: ""In Berlin you can be everything. Even a polar bear called Hertha"". The club also posted a video of its grizzly bear mascot ""Herthinho"" travelling from its Olympic Stadium ground in west Berlin to Tierpark in the east to meet the latest arrival. According to the zoo's website, it costs at least 1,000 euros ($1,120) to individually sponsor a ""large"" animal for a year with an average adult polar bear weighing between 385 and 410 kilogrammes (848 and 904 pounds). Hertha was greeted by a phalanx of cameras last month when she stepped out in public, frolicking with her mother Tonja in Tierpark's polar bear enclosure at a media photo-op. The mortality of polar bears tends to be very high in the first weeks and Tonja lost three of her cubs in less than two years. To the great relief of her keepers, Hertha has made it through the crucial first three months when a captive cub's chances of survival hang in the balance. To celebrate, Hertha has now been named, but her father Wolodja, who has been moved to a zoo in the Netherlands, will miss the celebrations. Every birth of a polar bear is greeted with delight in Berlin since Knut became an overnight celebrity, as visitors flocked to glimpse the white cub, born in 2006. Berliners took Knut to their hearts after he was abandoned by his mother and raised by Thomas Doerflein, a zoo employee who also became a minor celebrity. A European Union breeding plan is attempting to boost numbers of the bear, whose population in the wild is estimated at around 26,000."

Ivorian striker Salomon Kalou scored both of Hertha's first-half goals with Thomas Delaney and then Dan-Axel Zagadou twice equalising for Dortmund. Reus' late strike at Berlin's Olympic Stadium finally saw off Hertha, who had defender Jordan Torunarigha and substitute striker Vedad Ibisevic sent off in the final few minutes of a bad-tempered match. Kalou capitalised on a mistake by Dortmund goalkeeper Roman Burki with just four minutes gone to give Hertha the lead. Delaney equalised by charging through a huge gap in midfield and firing home, his 14th-minute shot deflecting off Hertha defender Karim Rekik. Kalou restored Hertha's lead by drilling home a penalty after a Julian Weigl handball 10 minutes from the break. Dortmund drew level again when French centre-back Zagadou headed home a Jadon Sancho corner two minutes after the break. With five minutes left, Torunarigha was sent off for a second yellow card after fouling Dortmund defender Achraf Hakimi, just before Delaney hit the crossbar. With time running out and Dortmund growing desperate after wasting a string of chances, Sancho supplied the cross for Reus to convert to claim the three points. In the dramatic closing moments, Kalou's replacement Ibisevic was also dismissed for unsporting behaviour after throwing the ball in the face of the Dortmund goalkeeper. Earlier, Schalke's miserable run was extended to six straight defeats after losing 1-0 at home to RB Leipzig in Huub Stevens' first game back as head coach. The Schalke legend has been hastily hurried back for his third stint in charge after predecessor Domenico Tedesco was fired on Thursday, two days after the Royal Blues' 7-0 thrashing at Manchester City in the Champions League. However even Stevens, who lifted the UEFA Cup as Schalke coach in 1997, could not arrest their dreadful run, which has seen them fail to win any of their last eight league games. Timo Werner stabbed home Leipzig's winner with 14 minutes gone in Gelsenkirchen after Yussuf Poulsen had rattled the crossbar. The defeat saw Schalke drop to 15th in the table, leapfrogged by Augsburg who enjoyed a 3-1 comeback win at home to second-from-bottom Hanover. Sergio Cordova equalised for Augsburg to cancel out Hendrik Weydandt's shock early goal for Hanover to make it 1-1 at the break. Midfielders Jonathan Schmid and Andre Hahn made sure of the win with goals in the last 12 minutes to see Augsburg home and leave Hanover winless in their last 25 away league games, dating back to October 2017. Stuttgart, in 16th, moved to within three points of Schalke with a 1-1 draw as central midfielder Steven Zuber equalised against Hoffenheim, the club he is on loan from, on 66 minutes. Zuber's superb goal cancelled out Andrej Kramaric's opener for Hoffenheim three minutes before the break -- the Croat notching his 13th league goal this season, having scored four goals in as many league games after two against Nuremberg last weekend. Wolfsburg coach Bruno Labbadia has announced he is leaving at the end of the season, due to a personality clash with sports director Jorg Schmadtke, but the off-field politics played no part in a 5-2 trouncing of Fortuna Duesseldorf. Towering Dutch striker Wout Weghorst scored a hat-trick in just over half an hour as Fortuna were floored by three goals in five minutes midway through the second half with Weghorst netting either side of a Robin Knoche goal."
42,09/03/2019,20:39,'Perfect day' as Bayern return to Bundesliga summit with Liverpool looming,"Bayern Munich warmed up for Liverpool with a ""perfect day"" by knocking Borussia Dortmund from the top of the Bundesliga for the first time since September with a 6-0 thrashing of Wolfsburg on Saturday.","Bayern, who host Liverpool on Wednesday in their Champions League, last 16, return leg clash after a goalless draw at Anfield, went top on goal difference from Dortmund, who needed late goals to win 3-1 at home to Stuttgart. ""I'm very pleased. We want to be just as focused on Wednesday,"" said Bayern head coach Niko Kovac. Bayern ran riot in Munich as Robert Lewandowski scored twice, leaving him with 20 goals in 17 league games against Wolfsburg, while Serge Gnabry, James Rodriguez and Joshua Kimmich also netted. ""We are now where we want to be -- first in the table and that's where we want to stay,"" added Kovac with nine rounds of league games left. Having been told on Tuesday, along with Bayern team-mates Jerome Boateng and Mats Hummels, that his Germany career is over, Mueller took out his frustration, setting up the first goal and scoring Munich's second. ""The three wanted to give a response and they all played well -- it was a perfect afternoon,"" said goal-scorer Kimmich. Gnabry gave Bayern the lead on 34 minutes at the Allianz Arena by tapping home Mueller's cross, then turned provider three minutes later when he served up a simple tap in for Lewandowski to make it 2-0. Rodriguez, thriving in the attacking midfield role, got on the scoresheet when his superb 52nd-minute shot hit the top corner. Having set up the first goal, Mueller showed Germany head coach Joachim Loew what he is missing by wrong-footing Wolfsburg goalkeeper Koen Casteels to score with his heel on 76 minutes. Kimmich scored with a header on 82 minutes and Lewandowski claimed his second by guiding his header into the far corner three minutes later. Lewandowski, the top-scoring foreigner in Bundesliga history with 197 goals, has now scored in each of his last seven games against Wolfsburg, who he single-handedly battered in 2015 with five goals in just nine minutes. In Dortmund, late goals by Paco Alcacer and Chelsea-bound Christian Pulisic saw off dogged Stuttgart, but Borussia are now second after 23 weeks on top. ""I don't care about who is top now,"" said Dortmund captain Marco Reus. ""It only matters who is top at the end and everything is still open."" The win, only Dortmund's second in their last nine games, was vital to stay level on 57 points with Bayern. Despite some dogged Stuttgart defending, Dortmund took the lead at Signal Iduna Park when Reus netted a penalty on 62 minutes. The lead lasted just nine minutes as Stuttgart's Marc-Oliver Kempf headed home unmarked. However, Alcacer calmed nerves when the Spanish striker stabbed home on 84 minutes after a goal-mouth scramble. The third goal came when Axel Witsel beat three defenders, played Mario Goetze into the box to set up Pulisic, who netted in stoppage time. ""They parked a gigantic bus (in front of goal) -- it was hard to find the holes,"" complained Dortmund coach Lucien Favre. ""We tried everything and managed it, we ran a lot and defended a lot, but all in all, the win was deserved."" Third-placed RB Leipzig were held to a goalless draw at home by Augsburg, who beat Dortmund last Friday and went down fighting against Bayern last month. Mid-table Hertha Berlin crashed to a 2-1 defeat at Freiburg after the visitors captain Vedad Ibisevic cancelled out a Nils Petersen goal, but then scored an own-goal by turning the ball into the Berlin net. Later, Borussia Moenchengladbach bounced back from last weekend's 5-1 thumping at home to Bayern with a 1-0 win at mid-table Mainz, thanks to a second-half goal from defender Nico Elvedi. Gladbach stay fourth, level on 47 points with Leipzig, and both clubs lag nine points behind new leaders Bayern and Dortmund."
43,23/02/2019,18:48,Bayern bridge gap to Dortmund with Berlin win,Javi Martinez fired Bayern Munich to a 1-0 win over Hertha Berlin as the defending champions won their 10th Bundesliga match from 11 to draw level on points with Borussia Dortmund at the top of the table on Saturday.,"Bayern were until recently nine points adrift of Dortmund, who lead the Bavarians on goal difference ahead of their match with Bayer Leverkusen on Sunday. Munich's man of the moment Martinez -- fresh from a superb midweek Champions League performance against Liverpool -- put the home side in the lead in the 62nd minute, heading a corner into the top left of the Berlin goal. Berlin's comeback attempts were scuppered in the 84th minute with centre-back Karim Bekik picking up a red card as his side ran out of steam. Despite victory, Bayern coach Niko Kovac was concerned about injured winger Kingsley Coman, who limped off the field in the 67th minute. ""In the first half we had some difficulties. A set piece decided this game. On the whole I'm satisfied,"" he said. ""For Kingsley we will need to wait for the results of the scan. I hope (the injury) isn't too bad."" Borussia Moenchengladbach, who were equal on points with Bayern just two weeks ago, dropped eight behind the leaders with a 3-0 loss at home to Wolfsburg. Yannick Gerhardt put the visitors ahead in the 38th minute, before Admir Mehmedi added a second in the 68th. Mehmedi took advantage of Gladbach's poor communication in defence, taking on keeper Yann Sommer one-on-one before tapping home from close range. The Swiss striker added a second 15 minutes later, heading over Sommer to put the match beyond doubt. Gladbach, who host Bayern next weekend, will be looking to find the form that saw them romp to a 3-0 win over the champions earlier in the season. Mainz overcame a recent slump to beat a disappointing Schalke 3-0 at home. Karim Onisiwo gave the home side a narrow 1-0 lead going into half-time, before late goals from Jean-Philippe Mateta and another from Oniswo left Schalke sitting just two places above the relegation playoff zone. Schalke, who pushed Manchester City all the way in their midweek Champions League clash before going down 3-2, looked sluggish in both attack and defence. The defeat sees the pressure continuing to pile on young coach Domenico Tedesco. Freiburg walloped relegation battlers Augsburg 5-1, with the home side causing constant problems for the visiting defence. West Ham's English loanee Reece Oxford was found out several times in defence leading directly to Freiburg goals, before picking up a late red card in the first minute of second-half injury-time. In Saturday's late game, Fortuna Duesseldorf pushed Nuremberg closer to the drop with a 2-1 home victory. Nuremberg were down to 10 men after just four minutes, losing winger Matheus Pereira to a red card after the Brazilian attacked Niko Giesselmann off the ball. While the visitors went 1-0 up in the 41st minute through a stunning strike from Eduard Loewen, Duesseldorf's numerical advantage was too great. They levelled through an own-goal in the 62nd minute before Kaan Ayhan headed the home side into the lead with just over five minutes to go. On Sunday, Borussia Dortmund will have a chance to restore their lead at the top as they take on Peter Bosz's resurgent Bayer Leverkusen at Signal Iduna Park."

""I am very happy, this point helps us and I am very proud to have scored,"" said Pizarro, who has also played for Chelsea, Bayern Munich and Cologne. Luck shone on Pizarro when he smashed a speculative free-kick under Hertha's wall and it took two deflections before hitting the net in the 96th minute at Berlin's Olympic Stadium. ""I just tried to shoot under the wall, because I knew they were going to jump,"" explained Pizarro. Pizarro's goal, which delighted Bremen coach Florian Klofeldt, who is four years younger than the Peruvian, bettered the previous Bundesliga record of Mirko Votava, who also netted for Bremen, aged 40 years, 121 days, back in 1996."
45,06/02/2019,23:45,Coman grabs winner as Bayern outlast Hertha in German Cup,Kingsley Coman spared teammate Mats Hummels' blushes with an extra-time winner as Bayern Munich stumbled into the German Cup quarter-finals with a 3-2 win at Hertha Berlin on Wednesday.,"Hummels' defensive mistake had gifted Hertha an equaliser in the second half of normal time, but Coman's header ensured that Bayern huffed and puffed their way into the last four. Hertha took the lead with a brutal counter-attack after just three minutes, Maximilian Mittelstaedt stroking the ball past Sven Ulreich, in Bayern's goal for the injured Manuel Neuer. Bayern hit back almost immediately through Serge Gnabry, who pounced on a loose ball and smashed in the equaliser on the half-volley. Gnabry then put Bayern ahead just after half-time, surging into the box and slotting the ball inside the far post. Yet Hummels' howler brought Hertha back into the game on 67 minutes. The Bayern defender's weak header allowed Davie Selke to dart into the box and prod the hosts level. Hummels continued to look unsettled, and he will have been mightily relieved when Coman nodded in the winner eight minutes into extra time. ""Their second goal was unnecessary, but we all make mistakes from time to time,"" Gnabry told ARD. ""It's always tough in the cup, and we are proud to be through."" Meanwhile, Schalke cruised into the quarter-finals with a 4-1 home win over Fortuna Duesseldorf on an emotional evening for the hosts. The game kicked off amid a sombre atmosphere in the wake of news that Schalke's legendary, cigar-smoking former general manager Rudi Assauer had died aged 74. ""Rudi was the architect of modern Schalke. Without him, we wouldn't be standing in this arena,"" said Schalke chairman Clemens Tonnies. The mood was lightened on the half-hour mark, as Ahmed Kutucu curled the ball into the top corner to give Schalke the lead. Their second came from a corner just after the break. Winston McKennie forced a good save from Jaroslav Drobny, before Salif Sane pounced on the rebound. Mark Uth added a third from close range on 53 minutes. Rouwen Hennings then chipped in a consolation goal for Duesseldorf before Sane sealed the win late on. Earlier on Wednesday, 19-year-old Brazilian forward Matheus Cunha made history with his first-half winner, as RB Leipzig beat Wolfsburg 1-0 to reach the German Cup quarter-finals for the first time. Cunha fired Leipzig to an early lead on nine minutes, latching on to a sharp through ball from Lukas Klostermann and turning the ball into the bottom corner. Augsburg also progressed after a smash-and-grab 1-0 victory away to second tier side Holstein Kiel. Kiel were left to rue an array of missed chances five minutes from time, when Michael Gregoritsch found the net against the run of play to send Augsburg into the quarter-finals. Hamburg, Paderborn, Heidenheim and Werder Bremen make up the list of quarter-finalists, having progressed on Tuesday."

Ibisevic, 34, is out of contract in June, but the veteran striker has netted 10 goals this season and took heart from seeing Bayern suffer their fourth league defeat of the campaign at Bayer Leverkusen last Saturday. ""This feels like a mini final for us,"" said Ibisevic. ""You can see that they have lost points this year that they wouldn't have given away normally. ""Of course, it gives us hope that they could slip up again, so we know what's possible."" Bayern hope to have Germany goalkeeper Manuel Neuer back between the posts, but playing with a plastic cast on his right hand after damaging his thumb in training last week. Berlin's Olympic Stadium has been an unhappy hunting ground for Bayern on their most recent visits, losing last May's German Cup final 3-1 to Eintracht Frankfurt before the defeat by Hertha. Ibisevic firmly sees his team as the underdogs even though Berlin last lost to Bayern in September 2016. ""We don't need to talk about being the favourites here, they are an opponent who are one of the top teams in Europe."" The Hertha-Bayern clash is the tie of the round, while Bundesliga leaders Borussia Dortmund play on Tuesday at home to Werder Bremen. ""If they have a good day, you're 3-0 down,"" said Hertha coach Pal Dardai, who refused to read too much into Bayern's defeat at Leverkusen. ""Now they have lost once, doesn't mean they are bad."" Dardai expects a tight match, but insists penalty practice has not been on the programme in training, saying ""we don't practise those extra anymore"". German Cup last-16 fixtures"

""I don't want to hear a thing about Bayern. And also not about any ticket requests - it's only about Wolfsburg,"" said Dardai, with both Hertha and Wolfsburg on 28 points in the Bundesliga table. ""There will be no better preparation than having three points against Wolfsburg behind us."" Hertha have already stunned Bayern this season, deservedly running out 2-0 winners when the sides met in the league last September after captain Vedad Ibisevic converted a penalty and playmaker Ondrej Duda netted a superb second goal before the break. With the pair in form, seventh-placed Hertha are unbeaten in their first two games of 2019 and are knocking on the door of the European places for next season, but Wolfsburg are just behind them in eighth. It has been 10 years since Hertha last took seven points from their first three games after the Bundesliga's winter break and Dardai wants to beat Wolfsburg, who lost their last two games, to boost confidence before the cup showdown. ""On our day, we can beat anybody,"" said Dardai. ""And I'll say it now, when we have our fans behind us and everyone is fit, we will win on Saturday. ""But to do that, you have to work hard and not think about Bayern."""
48,20/01/2019,17:58,Veteran Ibisevic shines as Hertha Berlin end winless streak,Veteran striker Vedad Ibisevic helped break Hertha Berlin's five-game winless streak with a hand in all three goals in their 3-1 victory at the Bundesliga's bottom side Nuremberg on Sunday.,"Hertha recorded their first win since December 8 to climb to seventh in the Bundesliga table as Ibisevic, 34, who is out of contract in June, showed his experience with a commanding performance in icy conditions. The Bosnia and Herzegovina international gave Hertha the lead after he quickly exchanged passes with strike partner Davie Selke and steered his shot past Nuremberg goalkeeper Christian Mathenia after 15 minutes for his seventh league goal this season. The hosts drew level just before the break when midfielder Hanno Behrens stabbed home a long-range shot from Eduard Loewen from the edge of the box which bobbled past several defenders. However, Ibisevic made sure of the three points by steering a cross from the right into the path of Ondrej Duda, who restored Hertha's lead five minutes after the break. Duda netted his second goal on 70 minutes when Ibisevic let a pass from Selkie fall to the Slovakia midfielder who crashed home his ninth goal of the season. Ibisevic squandered a great chance to claim his second goal and the visitors' fourth ten minutes from time when Duda's pass found him alone in the area, but the veteran striker mistimed his shot as the chance went begging. It was an untypical miss by Ibisevic, who has scored 44 goals in 121 games for Hertha since joining from Stuttgart in 2015, and says he has no plans to retire. ""It would be too soon to end my career,"" Ibisevic, who is hoping for a contract extension, told Thursday's edition of magazine Kicker. ""The Bundesliga is my favourite league and I want to measure myself against the best. ""I feel well here and I can imagine staying in Berlin."" On Saturday, leaders Borussia Dortmund stayed six points clear at the top of the Bundesliga table with a 1-0 win at RB leipzig, thanks to Axel Witsel's first-half winner, in a commanding away performance without captain and playmaker Marco Reus. Defending champions Bayern Munich, who are chasing a seventh straight league title, stay second after an impressive 3-1 win at Hoffenheim on Friday as Leon Goretzka scored twice."

Having missed Germany's 2014 World Cup victory with torn ankle ligaments and Euro 2016 with a groin injury, the fleet-footed Reus is even more determined to help defend the global title at Russia 2018. ""I'd be lying if I said that I didn't think about the World Cup and really want to be there,"" he told Bundesliga.com before kick-off. ""I won't make a secret of the fact it's a big goal of mine to be there. I know I've got a good chance, if I'm playing well."" Reus was a constant threat on Saturday and involved in the build up when striker Michy Batshuayi tapped home on 16 minutes, but Andre Schuerrle, who supplied the final pass, was offside. Leipzig took the lead when Liverpool-bound Naby Keita, back after a thigh injury, played a pass through Dortmund's defence which Jean-Kevin Augustin tucked away on 29 minutes. Having also had an earlier goal flagged for offside, Reus made no mistake at the second attempt, sprinting onto Batshuayi's well-timed pass and equalised seven minutes from half time. With an hour gone, Batshuayi, on loan from Chelsea, bungled the chance to grab the winner with the goal at his mercy. Leipzig, who picked up a point after three defeats, stay sixth. Dortmund coach Peter Stoeger is unbeaten in his ten league games in charge. ""I am happy with the 90 minutes, we are in the group fighting for Champions League places, it'll stay that way until the end of the season, and our goal is to qualify,"" said the Austrian. The result leaves Dortmund third after Schalke had earlier snatched second spot with a 1-0 home win against Hertha Berlin. Marko Pjaca, on loan from Juventus, claimed his second goal in five league games when Daniel Caligiuri whipped in a cross and Franco di Santo let the ball roll to Pjaca, who scored on 37 minutes. Schalke are 17 points behind runaway leaders Bayern, who play mid-table Freiburg on Sunday. Reports Bayern approached Freiburg boss Christian Streich last month to replace Jupp Heynckes as head coach next season have added extra spice to the game. Eintracht Frankfurt are fourth after their 1-0 win at home to mid-table Hanover as defender Danny da Costa scored their winner. Argentina striker Lucas Alario converted a first-half penalty and Julian Brandt scored with a superb chip as Bayer Leverkusen consolidated fifth place with a 2-1 win at ten-man Wolfsburg. Admir Mehmedi scored the consolation effort for Wolfsburg against his former club. The hosts finished with ten men when Brazilian left-back William was sent off for a second yellow card in added time. It finished goalless, but there was plenty of drama in Hamburg's basement battle at home to Mainz. Hamburg winger Filip Kostic hit the woodwork and had a goal ruled off side in the first half. Mainz had Nigeria defender Leon Balogun sent off for a second yellow card when he fouled Luca Waldschmidt in the area on 61 minutes. The referee pointed to the spot, but Kostic's weak attempt was saved by goalkeeper Florian Mueller on his Bundesliga debut. Hamburg are now seven points behind 16th-placed Mainz and on course for a first relegation in the club's history. ""Giving up is not in my nature, but we need a small miracle,"" admitted Hamburg coach Bernd Hollerbach. Having been booed by his own fans last weekend, the pressure eased on Hoffenheim coach Julian Nagelsmann with a 2-0 win at Augsburg. Croatia striker Andrej Kramaric scored for the fifth match in a row before Germany winger Serge Gnabry added a superb second after the break."
50,27/02/2018,13:20,Five things we learned from the Bundesliga,"German fans again protested against Monday night football, which is proving unpopular in the Bundesliga, while Bayern Munich extended their lead despite dropping points.","In Saturday's goalless draw in Munich, Hertha Berlin's defence again frustrated Bayern's star-studded attack. Ageing winger Arjen Robben is still fuming about dropping down the pecking order, but that anger drew praise from the man who picks the team, head coach Jupp Heynckes. Here are five things we learned from the latest round of Bundesliga games. Large numbers of Borussia Dortmund's fans boycotted Monday's 1-1 draw against Augsburg, but coach Peter Stoeger refused to blame the result on the protest. Home games are normally 80,000 sell-outs, but only 54,000 fans turned up in Dortmund. The protest was another blow aimed at the German Football League (DFL) who are experimenting with Monday kick-offs this season. Dortmund's south stand, normally packed with 24,500 fans, was half empty leading to an eerie atmosphere. That was after Eintracht Frankfurt fans pelted the pitch with tennis balls in last Monday night's game against RB Leipzig. Dortmund's players commented on the absent fans, but Stoeger refused to use the protest as an excuse. ""Many clubs in Germany would be happy if they had 54,000,"" said Stoeger. ""To say you can only play football well in front of 80,000 would be a cheap, simple excuse."" Robben cuts a frustrated figure at Bayern, but Heynckes has played down talk of a rift. The 34-year-old is out of contract in June and still fuming about starting the rout of Besiktas on the bench last week behind Thomas Mueller. However Heynckes understands where the Dutchman is coming from. ""I was just like him as a player,"" Heynckes, 72, told German daily Bild. ""He would never have had such an awesome career if he hadn't been the character he is. ""I've seen so many young, highly talented players who never learned to work so professionally and practise so passionately. ""That's what Arjen does - he's a role model."" Berlin head coach Pal Dardai knows how to frustrate Bayern. Hertha's 0-0 on Saturday was Berlin's third straight draw against Munich -- the best recent record of any league club against the runaway leaders. ""I have been hunting for the book 'How to beat Bayern', but in the mean time, I found 'How to stay unbeaten' and that's not so bad,"" joked Dardai. A string of saves from Berlin goalkeeper Rune Jarstein and dogged Hertha defence denied Bayern, despite 19 shots on goal, but Munich are still 19 points clear in the table. However, Bayern's recent below-par results against Berlin could be blamed on Champions League hangovers. Saturday's draw came after Munich thrashed Besiktas 5-0 last Tuesday in the last 16, first leg. In October, Bayern threw away a two-goal lead in a 2-2 draw in Berlin in the wake of their 3-0 group stage thumping at Paris Saint-Germain. After netting five goals in his first three games at Borussia Dortmund, Michy Batshuayi, on loan from Chelsea, has now failed to score in his last three matches. The Belgian striker produced just one shot on goal against Augsburg and rarely troubled the defence in a below-par display. As the Sky match commentator observed, ""he seems to be living off his reputation from when he first arrived"". Germany winger Marco Reus gave Dortmund an early lead, but Batshuayi failed to spark as Augsburg came back and equalised through 19-year-old defender Kevin Danso. ""That's not what we want to see, we might as well have dismantled the goals,"" moaned Stoeger after Borussia's Batshuayi-led attack stuttered in th second half. Second-from-bottom Hamburg are again facing relegation, but have huge problems on and off the pitch. Their 1-0 defeat at Werder Bremen on Saturday left them eight points from safety. They can expect heavy German FA (DFB) sanctions because the match was halted three times after Hamburg fans fired flares onto the pitch. ""These aren't fans, they're people who want to destroy football,"" fumed Hamburg president Heribert Bruchhagen. Police expect more trouble for Saturday's relegation battle at home to Mainz."

Second-place Borussia Dortmund host Augsburg on Monday, with fans from both sides set to boycott the game. Elsewhere, Bruno Labbadia takes charge of Wolfsburg for the first time against Mainz on Friday, while RB Leipzig look set to host Cologne without star midfielder Naby Keita. Here are five things to look out for in this weekend's Bundesliga action: Jupp Heynckes has worked wonders since returning to Bayern Munich, and on Saturday he looks set to break an incredible club record. Heynckes, who has led Bayern to 23 victories in 24 games since October, could now become the first Bayern coach ever to win 15 games in a row. The 72-year-old watched his side romp to victory over Besiktas in midweek to pick up a 14th consecutive win, equalling a club record set under Pal Csernai back in 1980. Bayern are expected to be without James Rodriguez, who was forced to leave the pitch after 44 minutes against Besiktas with a calf problem. A diagnosis on Wednesday confirmed that the Colombian will be out of action for no more than a few days. More fan protests are expected this Monday when Borussia Dortmund take on Augsburg in the Bundesliga's second Monday night fixture. Last week's inaugural Monday game saw fierce protests from Eintracht Frankfurt fans, who blew whistles and held up banners in protest at the new scheduling. This Monday, both Dortmund and Augsburg fan groups are expected to continue protests. Around 300 Dortmund fan clubs have reportedly signed up to a boycott led by the influential fan group ""Suedtribuene Dortmund"". ""We accept every opinion and every protest, as long as it is carried out peacefully,"" said Dortmund CEO Hans-Joachim Watzke. RB Leipzig will be without star midfielder Naby Keita when they host Cologne on Sunday evening. The Guinean midfielder left the field after just an hour in Leipzig's defeat to Frankfurt on Monday, having pulled his hamstring. Captain Willi Orban is also a doubt after suffering a cut to his knee in a collision with Frankfurt's Sebastien Haller on Monday. Coach Ralph Hasenhuettl, though, claimed that the injuries were not a disaster for his team, as Leipzig look to muscle their way back into the top four this weekend. ""We have enough quality to replace both of them,"" insisted Hasenhuettl. Bruno Labbadia takes charge of Wolfsburg for the first time on Friday evening, as the Wolves travel to Mainz for a crucial bottom of the table clash. Labbadia took charge of the struggling Wolves after Martin Schmidt's sudden resignation earlier this week, and is now tasked with leading the club back to safety. ""We have to use every hour available to us,"" said Labbadia. ""I will demand of my players that they invest everything into this fight."" Relegation threatened Hamburg find themselves in last chance saloon ahead of Saturday's visit to arch rivals Werder Bremen. Hamburg have not won in 10 games, and are now six points from safety as they prepare for a must-win game over fellow strugglers Bremen.

At the other end, Kalou fired his first penalty effort over the bar on 77 minutes after Berlin midfielder Arne Maier was brought down in the area. However just four minutes later, Kalou took his chance to make amends by converting a spot kick after a second penalty was awarded to Berlin. The VAR spotted Hertha's Davie Selke had been fouled in the area and ex-Chelsea striker Kalou made no mistake this time. ""I said to our manager, 'I think we're jinxed' after Salomon missed the first penalty, but then he had the balls to take the second one and convert it,"" said Hertha coach Pal Dardai. With time almost up, both teams had clear chances. Hertha's Austria international Valentino Lazaro forced Freiburg goalkeeper Alexander Schwolow into a reflex save with ten minutes left. Then a freekick by Freiburg's Julian Schuster was palmed onto the crossbar by Berlin goalkeeper Rune Jarstein just before the final whistle. The point was Hertha's second in their last four games to go 11th while Freiburg climbed out of the bottom three to 15th at the expense of Hamburg, who lost 1-0 at home to Bayern Munich on Saturday. Bayern are level with leaders Borussia Dortmund on 20 points, but stay second on goal difference after Corentin Tolisso scored their winner while Hamburg's Gideon Jung was sent off on 40 minutes for fouling Kingsley Coman. Dortmund threw away a two-goal lead in Saturday's 2-2 draw at Eintracht Frankfurt as goals by Nuri Sahin and Maximilian Philipp were cancelled out by Sebastien Haller and Marius Wolf Earlier on Sunday, Cologne and Werder Bremen remain in the relegation places after their goalless draw. Cologne's Claudio Pizarro, the highest scoring foreign striker in the Bundesliga's history, picked up an injury before kick-off and the 39-year-old had to sit out the home clash against his former club. Both sides had several chances - Cologne shaded the shots on goal with 18 compared to Bremen's 13. ""It's difficult, that was something for vegetarians - it wasn't meat or fish, so it's hard to know where to start,"" said Cologne coach Peter Stoeger. ""The guys have everything, there was passion. ""We can moan as much as we want, but there were enough chances."""
54,17/09/2017,17:26,Hoffenheim draw keeps Hanover top of Bundesliga,Hanover 96 remain top of the Bundesliga after Hoffenheim were held to a 1-1 draw at home to Hertha Berlin on Sunday while Bayer Leverkusen later hammered Freiburg.,"In the first ever Bundesliga match to kick off at 1:30pm local time (1130 GMT), Germany striker Sandro Wagner powered home a header after just six minutes to give Hoffenheim the lead against Hertha. However, Hertha striker Alexander Esswein equalised when he dived at Marvin Plattenhardt's cross on 55 minutes and the ball flew into the net off his shoulder. Having got themselves level, Pal Dardai's Hertha defended deep, packed players around the ball and frustrated Hoffenheim to earn a point away from home as neither side managed to create many more clear chances. The result leaves Hoffenheim fourth in the table with Hertha down to 11th and keeps Hanover, who won promotion back to the Bundesliga last season, as unlikely league leaders. Hanover went top of the table on Friday for the first time in 48 years with a 2-0 win at Hamburg thanks to goals by Martin Harnik and Togo winger Ihlas Bebou. However, Borussia Dortmund can knock Hanover from top spot on Sunday afternoon when they host bottom side Cologne, who have lost all three Bundesliga games so far and lost 3-1 at Arsenal on Thursday in the Europa League. Later on Sunday, Germany striker Kevin Volland netted twice as Bayer Leverkusen left the relegation places to go 12th with a 4-0 rout of Freiburg, for whom England Under-20 winger Ryan Kent, on loan from Liverpool, made his debut. After taking just a point from their first three league games, Leverkusen flew out of the traps at the BayArena as Volland netted either side of a stunning strike from Chile midfielder Charles Aranguiz. Volland opened the scoring with a superb strike from outside the area, but not to be outdone, Aranguiz showed superb technique and timing by running onto a loose ball which he volleyed home. Volland picked up his second by tapping home Lars Bender's cross to make it 3-0 at the break. Freiburg coach Christian Streich reacted for the second-half by bringing on Kent, who went close with a late shot, but the result left the club in the bottom three. The 25-year-old Volland looked to have wrapped up his hat-trick on 70 minutes, but the video assistant referee disallowed the goal due to a foul in the build-up before Julian Brandt scored Leverkusen's fourth from a quickly taken free-kick. Defending champions Bayern Munich are second, one point behind Hanover, after their 4-0 hammering of Mainz on Saturday when Robert Lewandowski netted twice while Arjen Robben and Thomas Mueller also got on the scoresheet."
55,10/09/2017,20:02,German female ref makes history as Leckie nets again,Germany's Bibiana Steinhaus made history on Sunday as the first female referee to officiate a match in a top European league by taking charge of Hertha Berlin's 1-1 draw with Werder Bremen.,"Steinhaus became the first woman to referee a top-tier match in the German, English, French, Italian or Spanish leagues when she oversaw the Bundesliga encounter in Berlin. The 38-year-old had built up a wealth of experience by refereeing 80 second-division games since 2007 and was the fourth official on numerous occasions in the Bundesliga, but this was her refereeing debut in the top flight. ""I'll be delighted when normality returns as of tomorrow,"" said Steinhaus after a busy week amidst intense media attention. ""The crucial thing for us is not to be the focus after 90 minutes, which is what we achieved and we're happy"" she added, speaking on behalf of her refereeing team. To mark the occasion, Hertha offered half-price tickets to female supporters who wanted to see Steinhaus in charge. She kept tight control at the Olympic Stadium and fulfilled her pre-match wish that her performance would not attract headlines for the wrong reasons. Stainhaus got a thumbs up from the president of the German Football Association (DFB). ""She was under unbelievable pressure, yet was poised for all the important situations and made the right decisions, that was a confident display,"" enthused DFB boss Reinhard Grindel. ""You could see that she has unbelievable experience."" Steinhaus smartly allowed play to continue when Australia's Mathew Leckie scored for the hosts after 38 minutes despite a foul on Hertha's Vladimir Darida in the build-up. Leckie now has three goals in as many league games this season after his arrival from Ingolstadt. ""I can only praise Bibiana Steinhaus, especially for the scenes around the first goal, when she let the advantage play on,"" said Berlin coach Pal Dardai. ""That speaks for her experience. ""Much respect - she let a lot of things go, even though it was a physically-intensive game. I am very happy."" Steinhaus then turned down Hertha midfielder Valentin Stocker's appeal for a penalty on 76 minutes, which replays showed was the right decision but one that earned her whistles from the disgruntled home crowd. Bremen earned a point in Berlin, their first of the campaign, when captain Thomas Delaney smashed the ball home on 59 minutes after forcing his way through the Hertha defence. Steinhaus' performance was also met with approval from Bremen coach Alexander Nouri, whose side remain in the bottom three. ""As I said before the game, the sex of the referee doesn't matter, only the performance and it was okay today,"" said the Werder boss. Her partner, Englishman Howard Webb, the referee for the 2010 World Cup final, was in the German capital to watch Steinhaus take charge. Named on the official list of Bundesliga referees for 2017/18, Steinhaus sat out the first two rounds of German league matches before making her top-tier debut on Sunday. Steinhaus has been refereeing since 2007 and officiated the women's Champions League final this year as well as the women's 2012 Olympic Games final in London. Schalke scored twice in the space of a minute after the break in their 3-1 victory at home to Stuttgart. Ex-Tottenham Hotspur midfielder Nabil Bentaleb converted a penalty after just four minutes, but Congo midfielder Chadrac Akolo equalised for Stuttgart with his first goal for the club before half-time. Schalke immediately regained the lead after the interval when defender Naldo headed home -- on his birthday -- and striker Guido Burgstaller fired in their third before Naldo cleared a Stuttgart shot off the line. The result left Schalke fifth, ahead of defending champions Bayern Munich, who are sixth after Saturday's shock 2-0 defeat at Hoffenheim, while leaders Borussia Dortmund were held to a goalless draw at Freiburg."
56,08/09/2017,13:38,Berlin offer cheap tickets for female ref debut,Hertha Berlin are offering women half-price tickets for Sunday's German league match against Werder Bremen with Bibiana Steinhaus set to make history as the first female referee in a top European league.,"The German Football Association (DFB) have confirmed the 38-year-old will take charge of the Bundesliga clash at Berlin's Olympic Stadium to become the first female ref in the German, English, French, Italian or Spanish leagues. Hertha are offering up to 500 ""Bibi-Steinhaus-tickets"", only available to women, at half-price. ""We want to offer all women the chance to experience this historic moment,"" said a statement on the Hertha website. Steinhaus has been refereeing since 2007 and earned her right to whistle in Germany's top flight after officiating the women's Champions League final this year and the 2012 women's Olympic tournament final in London. The police officer has already proven she can handle Bundesliga stars. As an assistant referee, she shrugged off an attempted hug by ex-Bayern Munich coach Pep Guardiola during a pitchside exchange in 2014. Last month, she bantered with Franck Ribery after the French winger cheekily untied her shoelaces while preparing for a free-kick when she officiated a German Cup first-round match. ""For me and my referee colleagues, the fact that I am a woman hasn't been an issue for a long time,"" Steinhaus said on the Hertha website. ""But we probably all need to accept and deal with the fact that it will continue to be considered a big deal in the media for now."" Steinhaus insists she has earned the chance to referee in Germany's top tier on merit, but accepts she is now a role model. ""I'm a Bundesliga referee because my performances have been good enough, not because I'm a woman,"" she said ""That's a big difference. ""If, because of that, I am considered a role model for young girls or a pioneer for equality, then that makes me even happier. ""I have a lot of experience now, which is an advantage in many situations. I have different ways of dealing with and reacting to certain situations in the game now. ""On top of that, I have also overseen many games as a fourth official, in order to take in the pace of the Bundesliga."" Both Bremen and Berlin coaches welcomed Steinhaus' debut. ""She has earned it through very good performances, at the end of the day that is the main principle, whether you are a man or a woman,"" said Bremen coach Alexander Nouri. Berlin coach Pal Dardai added: ""If someone refs so well, it doesn't matter if she is a man or a woman. She has already reffed in the second league and error-free, I believe, which is wonderful."""
57,20/08/2017,09:47,"Oh, baby! New father Leckie nets twice on Hertha debut",New-father Mathew Leckie expected to celebrate breaking his year-long Bundesliga goal-drought by changing a few nappies after scoring twice on his Hertha Berlin debut on Saturday.,"The 27-year-old Socceroos star became a father a week ago when his partner gave birth to a daughter Olivia Valentina. ""I'll be going straight home to the baby,"" said the Australia striker when asked how he would celebrate his double against Stuttgart at Berlin's Olympic Stadium. Leckie looked sharp, sprinting onto Vedad Ibisevic's header to fire home 30 seconds after the break, then netted from close range from a corner on 62 minutes to cap a dream debut in front of 44,751 fans in Berlin. Having set up two goals in Rostock in Hertha's German Cup first-round match last weekend, Leckie is enjoying his time in the capital: ""I'm having the time of my life"". Having gone 2,178 minutes without a goal in Germany's top flight for former club Ingolstadt, who were relegated at the end of last season, Leckie is delighted to have already open his Hertha account. ""Football is a crazy, funny game. I think the fresh start in Berlin was exactly what I needed,"" said Leckie, whose previous Bundesliga goal was back in May 2016. ""I was frustrated at the end (in Ingolstadt), because I knew I had chances to score. ""At the end, it didn't matter what I did, because luck wasn't on my side."" Leckie insists he doesn't ""want to say anything bad about Ingolstadt"", but Berlin's style of play under head coach Pal Dardai clearly suits his game better. ""We'd rather have the ball, which makes things easier for the forwards,"" he added. ""Hopefully I have broken the curse."" Dardai praised ""wonderful"" Leckie for how quickly he has settled into the team, but was otherwise unhappy with Hertha's second-half performance and was grateful for the two-goal cushion. ""We came out of the break well and too the lead, but you need to have some confidence,"" said Dardai. ""Instead, we lost our composure, which not okay."""

U2 will pay most of the total cost of 130,000 euros, according to German daily Bild, so that Hertha can host Liverpool on Saturday July 29 in a friendly to mark both clubs' 125th anniversaries. The match will be Klopp's third return to Germany following his 2015 departure from Borussia Dortmund, with whom he won the Bundesliga title in 2011 and 2012."
59,11/07/2017,14:02,Hertha sign son of Germany legend Klinsmann,The Klinsmann name made a return to the German football league on Tuesday as Hertha Berlin signed the son of former United States coach and Germany striker Juergen Klinsmann.,"Jonathan Klinsmann, 20, the goalkeeper with the United States Under-20s team, has been given an undisclosed contract after two weeks on trial with the Bundesliga club. Hertha plan to make Klinsmann junior their third-choice goalkeeper, behind Norway's Rune Jarstein and ex-Bayern Munich shotstopper Thomas Kraft, and he will gain experience for the Under-23 team in the regional league. ""After breakfast, Michael Preetz (Hertha's sports director) had a chat and said they had decided at short notice to offer a contract,"" said Klinsmann junior at Hertha's pre-season camp near Berlin. ""It was an unbelievably emotional moment for me, because the club has such a family history."" ""I'm looking forward to everything at the club, the city of Berlin and the challenge of playing in Germany."" His father, Jurgen Klinsmann, who enjoyed a glittering career with Bayern Munich, Monaco, Tottenham Hotspur and Inter Milan, has been a member of Hertha Berlin since 2004, while his grandfather Siegfried was born close to Berlin and was also a Hertha fan. However, Jonathan will be the first Klinsmann to play for Hertha. ""Jonathan convinced us with his ability, charisma and ambition. He'll now settle with us and develop step by step,"" said Preetz. Klinsmann was voted the best goalkeeper at the Under-20 CONCACAF championship in Costa Rica in March when the USA won the regional title by beating Honduras 5-3 in a penalty shoot."
60,23/05/2017,12:30,Europa League lures Australia's Leckie to Hertha,Australia international Mathew Leckie says the chance to play Europa League football next season was his main motivation to join Hertha Berlin following ex-club Ingolstadt's relegation from the Bundesliga.,"Leckie, a winger or striker, signed for Hertha on Monday after three years with Ingolstadt, who were relegated when the Bundesliga season ended on Saturday. Berlin's coach Pal Dardai has quickly snapped up the speedy forward. ""Mathew Leckie is a versatile player, which is characterised by the way he flies up and down the flanks,"" said Dardai after Hertha finished sixth in Germany's top flight to qualify for a Europa League place. Magazine Kicker say Hertha paid three million euros (US$3.3m) for the 26-year-old, who has made 39 appearances for Australia. ""I had a few offers, but Hertha stood out for various reasons,"" Leckie told Herthabsc.de. ""They are a big, fantastic Bundesliga club, have been very successful over the last two seasons and now they're playing in the Europa League. ""I also think that Pal Dardai is a great coach who I can learn a lot from."" Leckie has played 71 times in the Bundesliga. Having arrived in Germany as a 20-year-old in 2011 from Adelaide United, Leckie played for Borussia Moenchengladbach, then second division FSV Frankfurt, before joining Ingolstadt. ""It wasn't all easy at the start. When I first arrived here, I couldn't speak a word of German,"" he said. ""Now everything is easier for me, because I speak the language and understand almost everything. ""I want to stay here long-term, also because my wife is German. ""There's not really anything I don't like here, although the weather could be a bit better. ""At the start I was here on my own, but that's changed as well. My wife and I are expecting a baby in August."" Leckie will join the Australia squad for next month's Confederations Cup in Russia. The Socceroos open against world champions Germany in Sochi on June 19 and also face Chile and Cameroon in Group B."
61,09/04/2017,17:31,Stocker helps Hertha end losing streak,Swiss winger Valentin Stocker had a hand in both goals as Hertha Berlin ended their three-match losing streak with a 2-0 Bundesliga win over Augsburg on Sunday.,"Hertha climb back up to fifth after victory at Berlin's sun-drenched Olympic Stadium to keep their European hopes alive following straight defeats to Cologne, Moenchengladbach and Hoffenheim. Stocker played a key role as his attempted shot was headed home by US international John Anthony Brooks for the opening goal on 12 minutes. The Swiss international then netted his own goal, profiting from good play by Hertha's strikers Vedad Ibisevic and Salomon Kalou. Ibisevic held off two defenders to stab a pass through to Kalou, who spotted Stocker unmarked in the area and presented the right winger with a tap-in on 37 minutes. Kalou could have netted a late third, but failed to get a clean connection on his shot. The defeat keeps Augsburg 16th in the table -- amongst the relegation places -- and their plight was compounded later Sunday when Ingolstadt cut the gap behind them to a point by beating bottom side Darmstadt 3-2. On Saturday, Robert Lewandowski overtook Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang in the race to be the Bundesliga's top-scorer this season by netting twice in Bayern Munich's 4-1 thrashing of Borussia Dortmund. Runaway league leaders Bayern dominated the clash of Germany's giants and the win leaves them 10 points clear with six games left as Munich edge closer to a fifth straight league title. Lewandowski netted either side of half-time at the Allianz Arena to leave him with 26 league goals this season -- one more than main rival Aubameyang, who failed to find the net on Saturday. Veteran wingers Arjen Robben and Franck Ribery also netted in Bayern's morale-boosting win before Wednesday's crunch Champions League quarter-final, first-leg, tie against Real Madrid. The defeat leaves Dortmund, who host Monaco in the Champions League quarter-finals on Tuesday, fourth in the table and 18 points behind Bayern. Yussuf Poulsen's 93rd-minute goal gave 10-man RB Leipzig a 1-0 victory at home to Bayer Leverkusen after captain Willi Orban was sent off for a second yellow card. Leipzig's victory was a big step towards direct Champions League qualification next season and they are now seven points ahead of third-placed Hoffenheim, who crashed to a 2-1 defeat at Hamburg. Aaron Hunt stole the show for Hamburg -- who are unbeaten in their last nine home league games -- with both goals as Hoffenheim suffered only their third defeat this season. Wolfsburg, the 2009 champions, are just one point above the bottom three after a 4-1 hammering away to mid-table Schalke, for whom Guido Burgstaller netted twice. Mainz are only outside the relegation places on goal difference after their 1-0 defeat at Freiburg, whose striker Nils Petersen scored the second-half winner off the bench. The victory lifted Freiburg into the Europa League places in sixth above Cologne, who lost 3-2 at home to local rivals and fellow European hopefuls Borussia Moenchengladbach."
62,15/03/2017,16:29,Happy Kalou extends Hertha contract,"Ex-Chelsea striker Salomon Kalou on Wednesday extended his Hertha Berlin contract, which had been due to expire in June, with reports the new deal runs until 2020.","""I feel very comfortable in Berlin and I still have plenty that I want to achieve with Hertha Berlin. I would like to help the team continue to progress as it has in the last few years,"" said the 31-year-old Kalou. The Ivory Coast forward joined Hertha for 1.8m euros ($1.9m) from Lille in 2014, who he had joined in 2012 following six years with Chelsea. At Hertha this season he has scored six goals and provided four assists in 16 games so far. Hertha has not stipulated how long the new contract is for, but German daily Bild claims it will run for another three years. Hertha's director of sport Michael Preetz said Kalou, who has scored 30 goals in 86 appearances for Berlin, turned down other clubs to stay. Head coach Pal Dardai is pleased to keep the club's potent partnership intact with Kalou playing alongside Hertha's top-scorer Vedad Ibisevic, who has 10 league goals this season. ""Salomon is a real champion. He has won everything, but despite that he is still hungry for more. He is a model professional and a great example for all players,"" said Dardai. Kalou won the 2011/12 Champions League title, the 2010 English Premier League and lifted the FA Cup four times while at London giants Chelsea. He also played in the Ivory Coast team which won the 2015 Africa Cup of Nations. Hertha are currently fifth in Germany's top flight and bidding to qualify directly for a Champions League place next season."
63,12/03/2017,17:00,Hertha star taking legal action over Twitter pic,Hertha Berlin's Marvin Plattenhardt said Sunday he would take legal action against Germany's right-wing populist party Alternative for Germany (AfD) for posting a picture on Twitter of him alongside one of their politicans.,"The 25-year-old's defender happily posed for selfies with Hertha fans after his stunning second-half free-kick sealed Berlin's 2-1 German league win over Borussia Dortmund on Saturday. But the left-back was annoyed to discover he had unwittingly posed alongside Frank Scheermesser, an AfD politician, and the party's Berlin branch, who are seeking to promote themselves ahead of September's elections in Germany. ""@AfDFraktionAGH Please delete the photo immediately! You have no idea with whom I let myself be photographed! I distance myself from this!"" tweeted the Hertha defender. However, the tweet was not deleted and after training on Sunday, Hertha's deadball star said he would take legal action because the picture was used without his permission. ""It's an absolute cheek -- something like that is not on,"" he told reporters. ""You think you're doing a fan a favour and then something like this happens. They just used me. ""It's not correct to post something like that. ""I've responded, which was the right move, so let's see how things go in the next few days."" Plattenhardt's club Hertha has said they will support him in the event of a legal dispute."
64,10/03/2017,01:50,Five things to look for in the Bundesliga,Eintracht Frankfurt must contend with both illness and a rampant Bayern Munich while Hertha Berlin hope to halt high-flying Borussia Dortmund.,"Here are five things to look out for in the Bundesliga this weekend: Eintracht Frankfurt's squad has been hit by a virus ahead of Saturday's match at leaders Bayern Munich. Bayern have scored 25 goals in six games, notably notching up a 10-2 aggregate win over Arsenal in the last 16 of the Champions League. Germany's Jerome Boateng is set to make his first Bayern appearance after shoulder surgery. Bayern drew 2-2 at sixth-placed Eintracht in October, but Frankfurt coach Niko Kovac has low expectations. ""If I can write the names of 18 fit players on the team sheet, I'll be happy,"" he said. Defenders Michael Hector and Timothy Chandler, plus goal-scoring captain Alex Meier are amongst those affected by a stomach virus. Hertha Berlin host Borussia Dortmund on Saturday with Pal Dardai admitting he abandoned pre-match analysis to watch Barcelona's stunning win over PSG. The Hertha coach saw Dortmund's 4-0 Champions League win over Benfica on Wednesday on television, but switched channels to see the end of Barca's stunning 6-1 comeback win after his three football-mad sons protested. ""In all honesty, I turned over quick when I heard the score -- thank god -- because everyone who saw the Barca game can learn a thousand things,"" said Dardai. Hertha suffered a shock 1-0 defeat at Hamburg last weekend and lost to Dortmund last month in a penalty shoot-out in the the German Cup round of 16. The teams also drew 1-1 in Dortmund last October. Hertha face a busy afternoon trying to contain Dortmund's Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang who has hit seven goals in three games, including a hat-trick against Benfica. Tayfun Korkut makes his debut as Bayer Leverkusen coach against Werder Bremen on Friday in a final warm-up before their daunting Champions League clash at Atletico Madrid. Leverkusen replaced Roger Schmidt with ex-Hanover boss Korkut, 42, following their 6-2 mauling by Dortmund. Leverkusen have lost five of their last seven games and are 10th in Germany's top flight, 11 points away from the Champions League places. Next Wednesday, Leverkusen will try to overturn their 4-2 home-leg defeat against Atletico. ""There is no reason to fight fires here,"" said Korkut. ""I feel great willingness in the team, they are very eager, willing and highly motivated."" Leverkusen captain Lars Bender is doubtful, while Bremen skipper Clemens Fritz is out for the rest of the season with an injured ankle. Bremen's ex-Arsenal winger Serge Gnabry is doubtful with a knee injury. Second-placed RB Leipzig hope to have playmaker Naby Keita fit for Saturday's home match against Wolfsburg. The Guinean midfielder injured his foot in last weekend's 2-2 draw at Augsburg, but an MRI scan has revealed only bruising. Leipzig's top scorer Timo Werner, who has 14 goals, could pile more misery on Wolfsburg and new coach Andries Jonker, their third this season. The Dutchman has come in with the 2009 German champions only above the relegation places on goal difference and began his tenure with a 1-1 draw against Mainz. Relegation-threatened Hamburg want to back up last weekend's shock win over Hertha Berlin at home to Borussia Moenchengladbach on Sunday. Despite taking 21 points from their last 13 league games, including wins over Leverkusen and Leipzig, Hamburg remain in the bottom three. They are fighting to keep their status as the Bundesliga's only ever-present side, having appeared in every top-flight campaign since its inception in 1963-64. ""The blame lies with the first 10 games, when we took only two points,"" explained ex-Germany goalkeeper Rene Adler. Under Dieter Hecking, who took charge in December, Gladbach have posted impressive recent wins over Ingolstadt and Schalke to climb to ninth. Attacking midfielder Lars Stindl has scored four goals in his last five games. Fixtures (all times 1330 GMT unless stated)"
65,21/02/2017,16:57,Ancelotti escapes middle finger punishment,"Bayern Munich coach Carlos Ancelotti will not be punished for showing Hertha Berlin fans his middle finger but must make a donation to charity, the German Federation (DFB) said on Tuesday.","The Italian coach had made the explicit gesture after being spat at by Hertha fans during Bayern's 1-1 draw in Berlin on Saturday. The DFB said it had closed the case against Ancelotti ""on condition the Bayern Munich coach makes a 5,000-euros ($5,270) donation to the Sepp-Herberger Foundation"", the federation said in a statement on its website. The foundation -- named after the coach of the West Germany team that won the 1954 World Cup -- is an association run by the DFB to provide opportunities for handicapped footballers and to help former prisoners reintegrate into society. Bayern had publically backed their coach after his gesture, saying: ""Essentially, we find emotionally understandable the human reaction that drove Carlo Ancelotti to make this gesture, as a response to this vile attack."" On Monday, the DFB had invited Ancelotti to explain his actions -- the Italian had already admitted his guilt to German television station ARD after the match. Tensions were high during the match, in which Bayern, whose players had been jeered throughout, equalised six minutes into added time."
66,18/02/2017,20:18,Hertha boss Dardai fumes at Bayern's 'bonus' time,"Hertha Berlin coach Pal Dardai slammed the six minutes of added time as ""Bayern's bonus"" after Robert Lewandowski scored a last-minute goal to secure a 1-1 draw for Bayern Munich on Saturday.","""I think this is a Bayern bonus"", the Hungarian fumed to Sky as Lewandowski's 96th-minute winner at Berlin's Olympic Stadium denied Hertha a first win against Munich following 11 defeats. ""Sorry to anyone who might be offended, but after five minutes (of added time), the game must be finished. ""This wasn't a cup game, we don't play 120 minutes."" Hertha were seconds away from a rare win over Bayern before Lewandowski struck on 95 minutes, 59 seconds -- one of the latest goals in Bundesliga history -- to cancel out Vedad Ibisevic's first-half strike. The result extended Bayern's lead in the table to eight points and left Hertha sixth. There were angry scenes on the pitch after the final whistle as Berlin's team manager Michael Preetz argued with referee Patrick Ittrich, but Dardai had cooled his stance by the post-match press conference. ""The referee can always play as long as he wants,"" said Dardai. ""A point against Bayern is really wonderful -- but it hurts a bit."" Carlo Ancelotti's Munich struggled to return to German league duty just three days after the stunning 5-1 hammering of Arsenal in the Champions League last 16, first-leg. Lewandowski was one of four changes from the starting side which mauled the Gunners. He came off the bench with an hour gone to slot home the rebound after Arjen Robben's initial shot was charged down in a dramatic finish. ""If you score a goal in the 96th minute, it is always something special,"" said Lewandowski after his 24th goal in 30 games. Club captain Philipp Lahm spoke of ""Bayern's luck"" after they scored two last minute goals at Ingolstadt last weekend when all six league rivals behind them lost. This time, Lahm said Bayern's cast-iron will had carried them. ""We went out to win the match, you noticed that in the team,"" said Lahm. ""We did not play badly and found the spaces between the lines, but often didn't find it easy on the wings. ""Only the last pass was missing, but you can see that the team always believes until the end."" After Bayern's magnificent second-half display against Arsenal, the late winner against Berlin failed to mask a mediocre Bundesliga performance. ""We have a good mentality, we always believe we can still score a goal,"" goalkeeper Manuel Neuer. ""That is not a guarantee and we are all aware of it."" Bayern's Germany defender Mats Hummels said they deserved the point for persevering against a Hertha team intent on slowing things. ""We gave everything for this point and deserved it. Hertha tried to slow the game down -- no one needs to complain about the injury time,"" said Hummels. ""We've just tried everything until the end and believed right until the end."""
67,29/01/2017,17:41,Freiburg stun high-flying Hertha,Midfielder Janik Haberer and ex-Bayern Munich striker Nils Petersen netted for Freiburg in Sunday's shock 2-1 win over Bundesliga high-fliers Hertha Berlin.,"After pushing league leaders Bayern all the way in last weekend's 2-1 home defeat at the Schwarzwald Stadion, hosts Freiburg earned a deserved win on Sunday to climb to eighth in Germany's top flight. Haberer, who had given Freiburg a shock lead against Bayern before Robert Lewandowski netted twice, gave the hosts the lead against Hertha when he drilled home Vincenzo Grifo's cross on 39 minutes. Despite less than 40 percent possession, Freiburg, last season's second division champions, manage to contain Hertha's attack, led by Vedad Ibisevic, Berlin's top-scorer with eight goals this season. Freiburg sealed the win when super sub Petersen netted his sixth goal of the season, all of which have come as a replacement, on 87 minutes when he finished off a move started by his own goalkeeper and beat three defenders. Less than a minute later, Hertha pulled a goal back when Ibisevic's shot was saved but ex-Dortmund striker Julian Schieber rifled home. Freiburg could have made it 3-1 when Turkish midfielder Onur Bulut forced Hertha's Norway goalkeeper Rune Jarstein to tip the ball over the bar with time running out. The defeat, Hertha's sixth of the season, leaves Pal Dardai's Berlin sixth in the table and 15 points behind leaders Bayern, who won 2-1 at Werder Bremen on Saturday thanks to goals by Arjen Robben and David Alaba. Also on Saturday, second-placed RB Leipzig ended 10-man Hoffenheim's unbeaten run this season with a 2-1 comeback win to stay just three points adrift of Carlo Ancelotti's star-studded Bavarians. Hoffenheim were the last undefeated team left in Europe's top leagues before Marcel Sabitzer's 77th-minute winner dealt the visitors their first loss of the campaign after striker Sandro Wagner's dismissal. Bayer Leverkusen, who host Atletico Madrid in the Champions League last 16 in three weeks' time, threw away a two-goal lead in their 3-2 home defeat against Borussia Moenchengladbach. Goals by Germany defender Jonathan Tah and Javier Hernandez, 'Chicharito's first since October, put Leverkusen ahead before Gladbach fought back. Attacking midfielder Lars Stindl scored two goals in six minutes before Brazilian striker Raffael netted the winner. Cologne also battered bottom side Darmstadt 6-1 as Japan striker Yuya Osako scored twice. Relegation-threatened Ingolstadt remained 16th, but boosted their survival chances with a 3-1 win over Hamburg, who drop to second from bottom. Ingolstadt's Pascal Gross, Markus Suttner and Almog Cohen, who netted a penalty, netted before Hamburg's Japanese captain Gotoku Sakai pulled a goal back. Wolfsburg slumped to a 2-1 home defeat against Augsburg, whose Dominik Kohr scored the winner after Halil Altintop equalised following Germany striker Mario Gomez's early goal for the Wolves. Eintracht Frankfurt finish the weekend third thanks to Friday's 1-0 win at Schalke after Alexander Meier, the league's top scorer in 2014-15, scored a first-half winner."
68,27/11/2016,20:06,Two-goal Ibisevic sent off as Hertha go third,Vedad Ibisevic scored both goals before being sent off in Hertha Berlin's 2-1 comeback win over Mainz to lift his side to third in the Bundesliga on Sunday.,"Both teams finished with ten men for the final quarter of an hour as Ibisevic was sent off for receiving his second yellow card. His dismissal came after Mainz's defensive midfielder Jean-Philippe Gbamin was also sent for an early shower, also for a second booking. ""We stayed calm despite conceding the early goal, got ourselves level and then created the winner, so we deserved the win,"" said Hertha coach Pal Dardai. Aaron Seydel had given Mainz the lead after 25 minutes at Berlin's Olympic Stadium, but Hertha responded when Salomon Kalou spotted Ibisevic unmarked and the Bosnia forward fired home Berlin's equaliser on 36 minutes. Gbamin was sent off on 62 minutes and his dismissal changed the course of the game. Kalou and Ibisevic combined again for Hertha's second. Ivory Coast international Kalou headed back across goal on 67 minutes for his forward partner Ibisevic to fire home before he was sent off seven minutes later. Hertha climb to third behind leaders RB Leipzig and second-placed Bayern Munich. Earlier, Schalke 04 continued their rise as striker Eric Choupo-Moting atoned for a penalty miss by netting in their 3-1 comeback win against Darmstadt. Having been bottom of the table after losing their first five games -- the worst start to a season in the club's history -- the result left Schalke eighth and unbeaten in their last 11 games in all competitions. ""It's the first time we have turned things around after going behind and we haven't lost for a while now,"" Choupo-Moting told Sky. Markus Weinzierl's side will face a stern test of their renewed form when they visit Bundesliga leaders Leipzig, who won 4-1 at Freiburg on Friday to stay three points clear of Bayern, next weekend. Cameroon's Choupo-Moting showed his class by redeeming himself for a missed first-half penalty. After setting up Schalke's equaliser in the opening period, the 27-year-old made it 2-1 midway through the second half before Alessandro Schoepf grabbed their third on 90 minutes. Darmstadt took the lead at Schalke's Veltins Arena when midfielder Marcel Heller poached the opening goal with just six minutes gone. But Schalke roared back with the equaliser when Darmstadt lost the ball on the edge of their own area and Choupo-Moting fired in a cross which Bosnia defender Sead Kolasinac headed home from close range on 26 minutes. The hosts should have doubled their tally barely a minute later when Germany international Leon Goretzka was fouled in the area, but Choupo-Moting failed with his penalty attempt. He fired his spot-kick at the feet of the diving Darmstadt goalkeeper Michael Esser and the ball rebounded to safety. ""I thought he'd dive to the side, so I hit the ball down the middle, but it didn't work the way I wanted it to,"" Choupo-Moting explained. ""That sort of thing does stay on your mind, but it helps if you score afterwards."" The Cameroon forward then showed lightning reactions to slip his marker when attacking midfielder Max Meyer fired in a cross and Choupo-Moting tapped his shot past Esser on 60 minutes. It was his third league goal of the season and he could have added another when he fired wide of the post with 14 minutes left. Austria's Schoepf added Schalke's third with some good finishing after a chip over the Darmstadt defence from Ukraine international Yevhen Konoplyanka just before the final whistle."
69,30/10/2016,17:43,Suele header lifts Hoffenheim to third,Rising Germany star Niklas Suele sealed Hoffenheim's 1-0 win over Hertha Berlin which put them third in the Bundesliga and set up a mouth-watering clash against leaders Bayern Munich.,"Suele's 31st-minute header on Sunday gave unbeaten Hoffenheim their fifth win in nine games as his side took Hertha's place in Germany's top flight. It leaves Hoffenheim four points behind Carlo Ancelotti's Bayern, who they play in Munich next Saturday. The tie at Munich's Allianz Arena will pit two teams unbeaten against each other after Bayern's 3-1 win at Augsburg on Saturday. Having battled relegation last season, this is the highest Hoffenheim have been in the German league table for two years. The turn around in their fortunes is mainly down to the hard work of their 29-year-old coach Julian Nagelsmann, the youngest coach in the Bundesliga's history. Suele, 21, grabbed the winner when the giant centre-back got on the end of Kerem Demirbay's curling free-kick. With an eye on the 2018 World Cup, the strapping centre-back is in the plans of Germany's head coach Joachim Loew. Suele, who won a silver medal when Germany lost the Olympic final to Brazil in the Rio de Janeiro games, made his debut for die Mannschaft in September's 2-0 friendly win over Finland, Bastian Schweinsteiger's 121st and final appearance. The defeat cost Hertha third place and was only their second loss having also been beaten by Bayern this season. Hertha coach Pal Dardai took off Vedad Ibisevic, the club's top scorer so far this campaign with six league goals, for the final 10 minutes, for Tunisia striker Sami Allagui, who made his 100th Bundesliga appearance. Apart from Bayern being first, there is an unusual look to the top three with RB Leipzig, who won 2-0 at Darmstadt, still second and unbeaten with six wins and three draws in their debut Bundesliga season."

71,18/09/2016,19:42,High-flying Hertha down Schalke to match Bayern,Hertha Berlin maintained their 100 percent Bundesliga record with a 2-0 win over Schalke 04 to set up a top-of-the-table clash on Wednesday against Bayern Munich.,"Hertha's victory on Sunday means they are only second in the German league table on goal difference behind Bayern with the only teams boasting a perfect three wins from three in Germany's top flight poised to meet at Munich's Allianz Arena in midweek. Superb second-half goals from ex-Bayern midfielder Mitchell Weiser and Swiss midfielder Valentin Stocker at Berlin's Olympic Stadium gave Hertha three more points. A superb pass from Slovakia's Peter Pekarik was met in mid-air by Weiser who volleyed home to the delight of the home fans in the 50,000-strong crowd on 64 minutes. Hertha doubled their lead in emphatic fashion ten minutes later when Weiser's pass found Stocker in space behind the Schalke defence and the Swiss international showed great control before slamming his shot home. It means Berlin will head to Munich for a mouthwatering clash and another test for Carlo Ancelotti's Bayern. The Italian's illness-hit side had to come from behind to grind out a 3-1 win at home to Ingolstadt in Munich on Saturday. The result in Berlin was a third-straight defeat for Schalke. It is little short of disaster for new coach Markus Weinzierl and director of sport Christian Heidel after losing at Eintracht Frankfurt and being beaten at home by Bayern. The Royal Blues now badly need wins at home to Cologne on Wednesday and away to Hoffenheim on Sunday. Only goal difference keeps them off the bottom of the table, one place ahead of Werder Bremen, who sacked their coach Viktor Skripnik on Sunday. Earlier, Japan striker Yoshinori Muto again came off the bench to score his second goal in just three Bundesliga games in Mainz's 3-1 away win at Augsburg. Muto came on with 66 minutes gone for Colombia striker Jhon Cordoba, who had scored Mainz's early opener, and stabbed the ball over the line nine minutes from time after some good play by Yunus Malli. This was Muto's second goal off the bench this season after he netted, with only his fourth touch of the game, late in Mainz's 2-1 defeat at Borussia Dortmund on the opening weekend. Mainz are in the Europa League this season, drawing their first group game 1-1 at Saint Etienne on Thursday, but this was their first German league win of the campaign after also drawing 4-4 with Hoffenheim last weekend, when they squandered a 3-0 lead. On Sunday, Augsburg had again threated to share the points after Greece defender Konstantinos Stafylidis equalised in the 73rd minute to make it 1-1. But a bullet-header from Malli restored Mainz's lead two minutes later before Muto made sure of the three points to leave both teams in mid-table."
72,17/09/2016,14:45,High-flying Hertha eye perfect record at Schalke,High-flying Hertha Berlin aim to maintain their 100 percent record with three wins from three Bundesliga matches when they host under-pressure Schalke 04 on Sunday.,"Defending champions Bayern Munich and Hertha were the only teams to win both of their opening two games in Germany's top flight while Schalke arrive at Berlin's Olympic Stadium having lost both of theirs. ""We're in a good mood and Schalke are under pressure. We will see from the first minute how that will effect the game,"" said Hertha's coach Pal Dardai. ""We'll put Schalke under pressure. Act rather than react - that's the plan."" Hertha beat newly-promoted Freiburg 2-1 at home, then won 2-0 at Ingolstadt to take a maximum six points from their two games. Schalke, under new coach Markus Weinzierl, lost their season's opener 1-0 at Eintracht Frankfurt then leaked late goals in a 2-0 defeat to Bayern after putting in a battling display. Schalke produced an impressive performance in holding Bayern until Robert Lewandowski broke the deadlock in the 81st-minute. The Royal Blues' 1-0 victory at French side Nice on Thursday in their opening Europa League group stage match hints that their fortunes are on the rise. ""We're flying to Berlin with a win under our belt which is valuable for self-confidence,"" said sports director Christian Heidel. Schalke will have Dutch striker Klaas-Jan Huntelaar back from the concussion he suffered against Bayern. Germany midfielder Max Mayer, who only played the last half an hour in Nice, showed his form by setting up Abdul Baba's winning goal on Thursday. ""We want to finally get some points in the Bundesliga,"" said Schalke captain Benedikt Hoewedes, expected to play right-back in Berlin. ""Hopefully we can thrown on one or two fresh players and push up the tempo."" Hertha's USA international defender John Brooks is an injury doubt while Dardai is otherwise expected to name the same team which won at Ingolstadt."
73,28/08/2016,18:28,Super sub Schieber seals Hertha's dramatic win,Julian Schieber's injury-time winner sealed Hertha Berlin's 2-1 victory at home to newly-promoted Freiburg on Sunday for a dramatic start to the hosts' 2016/17 German league season.,"Hertha were cruising to a 1-0 win at Berlin's Olympic Stadium on the opening weekend of the Bundesliga, thanks to Vladimir Darida's second-half goal before the game burst into life in the final ten minutes. Ex-Dortmund striker Schieber came off the bench for Vedad Ibisevic with 85 minutes gone and played a key role after Freiburg drew level with a stunning header from their captain Nicolas Hoefler in the 93rd minute. With visiting Freiburg fans still cheering, Hertha roared back as Schieber latched onto a blocked shot from Japan winger Genki Haraguchi and his crude shot rolled into the goal in the 95th minute. ""It's a dream for any footballer to score the winning goal in front of home fans shortly before the end, even if it was a scuffed shot,"" said Scheiber after netting his first goal since knee surgery in March 2015. Blue skies over Germany saw the mercury hit 35 degrees Celcius in the shade in the capital and the players were often reduced to walking pace in Berlin. The hosts dominated possession and were rewarded with the three points after creating the better chances. They hit the crossbar when Haraguchi had his second-half shot saved, but the ball hit the woodwork when Hoefler headed away after 57 minutes. Berlin went ahead five minutes later when Haraguchi played the ball into Ibisevic, whose pass found Darida unmarked and his shot beat Freiburg goalkeeper Alexander Schwolow. Ivory Coast striker Salomon Kalou, who suffered a double bereavement in the last two weeks following the death of his mother and father, was left on Hertha's bench for the final ten minutes. The match in Berlin was not the only one affected by high temperatures over Germany at the weekend. Borussia Dortmund players admitted suffering in Saturday's 2-1 win over Mainz, which kicked off at 1530 local time (1330 GMT) when Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang netted twice. Borussia Moenchengladbach's 2-1 win over Bayer Leverkusen on Saturday night was also affected as the temperature hit the high 30s across Germany. On Friday, last season's champions Bayern Munich kicked-off the season with a 6-0 hammering of Werder Bremen at the Allianz Arena. Poland hot-shot Robert Lewandowski, the 2015/16 top-scorer in Germany with 30 goals, netted a hat-trick for Bayern to resume his rivalry with Aubameyang, who scored 25 times to finish second. Later on Sunday, RB Leipzig, who were only founded in 2009 when Austrian energy drinks firm Red Bull bought their licence, will make their debut in Germany's top flight away to Hoffenheim after winning four promotions in seven years."
74,08/05/2016,15:52,Wagner eyes England after breaking Hertha hearts,"Bundesliga bad-boy striker Sandro Wagner is set to play in England next season after scoring the winner, then being sent off, in Darmstadt's 2-1 win at Hertha Berlin, which effectively ended his ex-club's Champions League hopes.","Darmstadt reportedly turned down offers from Premier League sides West Bromwich Albion and Aston Villa last December as Wagner, who has a contract until 2017, went on to score 14 league goals to keep them in Germany's top flight. ""We'll have discussions with him in the summer, but he has made it clear that he imagines playing football in England,"" said Darmstadt coach Dirk Schuster on Sunday. ""We have to respect his wishes and we won't put any obstacles in his way. ""It's been a win-win situation for all parties this season: he has raised his market value and we have to thank him for helping keep us up."" Wagner scored Darmstadt's equaliser, then their 83rd-winner at Berlin's Olympic Stadium on Saturday. The result left Darmstadt 13th, while sixth-placed Hertha are three points from a Champions League play-off berth, but with an inferior goal difference to their main rivals and are set to play in the Europa League in the 2016/17 season. Angry Hertha fans stormed past security staff after the game and unsuccessfully hunted Wagner in the catacombs of the Olympic Stadium before being ejected. Wagner was booked for his over-zealous celebrations for the winning goal in front of Hertha's fans having rejuvenated his career at Darmstadt this season after three unhappy years with the Berlin club. He was then sent off two minutes from time for fouling Hertha's Mitchell Weiser. ""There were a lot of emotions. I wasn't treated so nicely here when they let me go,"" explained Wagner. ""I didn't mean it nastily,"" he said when explaining his enthusiastic celebrating in front of Hertha's fans. ""The fans here had supported me, but there were a few up there who booed me and called me blind (when he missed chances)."" The 28-year-old Wagner sparked controversy in Germany last month by suggesting footballers deserve higher wages because of the sacrifices made in their short careers. ""I think even the players at Bayern Munich do not make enough money, not even 12 million euros (US$13.6m) or so is enough. Professional athletes in American competitions make much more,"" he told Bild. ""Everybody is looking at everything you are doing, in your personal life as well. ""When you look at all the sacrifices footballers have to make, they do not earn enough money."" Munich-born Wagner came up through Bayern Munich's youth academy, but failed to win a first-team place and spent spells at Duisburg, Werder Bremen, Kaiserslautern and Hertha. He was part of the Germany Under-21 team which won the 2009 European Championships alongside the likes of Mesut Ozil, Jerome Boateng, Mats Hummels and Manuel Neuer, scoring twice in the 4-0 win over England in the final."
75,20/04/2016,22:55,Dortmund down Hertha to face Bayern in cup final,Borussia Dortmund will face Bayern Munich in the German Cup final on May 21 after their comprehensive 3-0 semi-final win at Hertha Berlin on Wednesday.,"A first-half goal by Gonzalo Castro, plus late second-half strikes from wingers Marco Reus and Henrikh Mkhitaryan sealed Dortmund's deserved win at Berlin's Olympic Stadium. The victory sends Thomas Tuchel's Dortmund team back to the same Cup final venue in a month's time. ""I am very happy with the manner and vein of the victory,"" said Tuchel as his side exorcised the bitter disappointment of last Thursday's 4-3 Europa League defeat at Liverpool. ""I need to pay the team a really fat compliment. We deserved the win."" Munich's 2-0 win over Werder Bremen on Tuesday means that Germany's top two teams will meet again when Dortmund play Bayern in a repeat of the 2012 and 2014 Cup finals. ""The joy at reaching the final is huge. That will again be an interesting game,"" said Dortmund's goal-scorer Reus ahead of their showdown with Bayern. Dortmund were dealt a blow before kick-off as top scorer Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang dropped out with a foot injury. Tuchel had said the Gabon international, who has scored 37 goals in all competitions, had the all clear to play despite breaking off the last five minutes of Monday's training session. But the knock flared up an old injury Aubameyang picked up in their quarter-final win over Stuttgart in February. His place against Hertha went to Colombia striker Adrian Ramos, who scored twice in Sunday's 3-0 league win over Hamburg. Aubameyang had netted in each of Dortmund's last seven German Cup games dating back to the start of last season. Dortmund took the lead when Mkhitaryan won the ball on the right, Shinji Kagawa fired in the cross and Castro was unmarked on the edge of the area to blast home on 21 minutes. It was a weak start from Hertha who seemed overawed by the occasion at their sold out 76,233 stadium as Dortmund dominated the early stages. Borussia then scored two goals in the final 15 minutes to deny Hertha their dream of a first Cup final appearance at their own ground since 1993. Nearly 23 years ago, their reserve team made a shock run to the final when they lost to Bayer Leverkusen. It remains the only time a reserve team has managed the feat in Germany and it is 37 since year since Hertha's first team last reached the final. ""We had a chance today and my team played to their limits,"" said Hertha coach Pal Dardai. ""At the end of the day, you have to say Dortmund were too quick for us, you could feel something was missing."" A slip by Hertha's US defender John Anthony Brooks on 75 minutes allowed Reus the space in the area to fire home Kagawa's final pass. Dortmund then completed the rout when Mkhitaryan finished off a good counter-attack with Reus again popping up to provide the final pass with the Hertha defence in tatters. Dortmund will hope for a repeat of their impressive 5-2 win over Bayern in the 2012 final when striker Robert Lewandowski netted a hat-trick against his future employers. Munich then claimed revenge two years ago with a 2-0 extra-time win in the 2014 final."
76,19/04/2016,14:51,Aubameyang fit as Dortmund hunt Anfield cure in Berlin,Borussia Dortmund's Thomas Tuchel says Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang will be fit for Wednesday's German Cup semi-final at Hertha Berlin as they look to heal the hurt of their Europa League exit at Liverpool.,"Aubameyang has scored 37 goals in all competitions for Dortmund this season, but limped out of Monday's training with a toe injury, sparking concerns about his fitness. ""Aubameyang took a hit to his toe in training, which was very painful, but it shouldn't be an issue for Wednesday,"" assured Tuchel, Dortmund's head coach. Aubameyang is on an incredible goal-scoring run in the German Cup, having scored in each of Dortmund's last seven cup games -- including their 3-1 defeat to Wolfsburg in the 2015 final -- dating back to the start of last season. With Bayern Munich meeting Werder Bremen in Tuesday's other semi-final, Dortmund are determined to reach the German Cup final to exorcise the heartache of their dramatic European quarterfinal exit at Anfield. ""The set up is similar to how it was in Liverpool: it's a knock-out game, an away match, we'll be meeting a euphoric opponent, who are full of confidence from the great support of their home fans,"" said Tuchel. Tuchel admits Dortmund are still processing last Thursday's 4-3 defeat at Liverpool having thrown away a 3-1 lead. ""It would be hypocritical to say that we will have been working on the Liverpool result until tomorrow -- there is no medicine for that,"" said Tuchel. ""We are finding things out about ourselves and that's okay. We're on the right path to dealing with it. ""Of course, after such a defeat as that, you feel bitter, but it's not the end of the world. ""It hasn't been an issue in our concrete preparations for tomorrow."" Asides from Anfield, there has also been the off-field distraction of media reports that, with a year left on his Dortmund contract, Germany midfielder Ilkay Gundogan has agreed a five-year deal to join Manchester City for next season. Having lost last year's cup final, Dortmund are eager to beat Berlin to stay in the hunt for a title as they trail Pep Guardiola's Bayern in the German league and are currently seven points adrift with four games left. Dortmund make the 500km (310 miles) trek to Germany's capital hoping to again head west for the final in a month's time. Hertha are bidding to reach the final for the first time since 1993 and with a capacity crowd of 76,233 expected, their coach Pal Dardai says 'the whole city and all the players' are up for this match. ""I expect a team from Hertha with a lot of confidence, who will defend high up the pitch,"" said Tuchel. ""They are brave in their build-up play and from week to week they are improving their possession. ""Our goal is to be in the final and win it. ""Whether this is a lesson, to learn from the Liverpool game, to play more physically, I would like to differentiate. ""It's not as though things started to unravel after the first goal in Liverpool. ""The lesson of the past few weeks after the international break is very simple: We have to play better."
77,06/03/2016,20:42,Hamburg humble third-placed Hertha,Third-placed Hertha Berlin remain on course for a return to the Champions League for the first time since 2000 despite a surprise 2-0 defeat at mid-table Hamburg on Sunday.,"Pal Dardai's Hertha are a huge 16 points adrift of second-placed Borussia Dortmund and 21 behind league leaders Bayern Munich, but hold third by a point from Schalke, who they host in Berlin next Friday. Hertha stumbled to their seventh defeat of the season as Hamburg striker Nicolai Mueller netted two second-half goals to leave his team tenth in the table. Earlier, 10-man Mainz failed to back up their shock mid-week win at Bayern, but remain in the pack alongside Schalke, Wolfsburg and Borussia Moenchengladbach hunting a Champions League place, after drawing 0-0 with Darmstadt on Sunday. Having become the only team to win at Bayern's Allianz Arena stadium this season by pulling off a stunning 2-1 victory on Wednesday, fifth-placed Mainz were frustrated by Darmstadt, who are just above the relegation places. Hosts Mainz were reduced to 10 men at the Coface Arena when Italian defender Giulio Donati was shown a straight red card on 57 minutes for kicking out at Darmstadt striker Sandro Wagner. On Saturday, leaders Bayern stayed five points clear of nearest Bundesliga rivals Dortmund after a goalless draw between Germany's top two sides. Despite the lack of goals, the game lived up to its billing as the clash of the teams which have dominated the German league this season at Dortmund's sold-out Signal Iduna Park. The game's best chance came on 64 minutes when Arturo Vidal's shot for Bayern was palmed onto the bar by Dortmund goalkeeper Roman Buerki. Earlier, Bayer Leverkusen came back from 3-0 down to avoid a fourth straight league defeat in a 3-3 draw at Augsburg. Augsburg's South Korea striker Koo Ja-Cheol scored his first hat-trick in Germany's top flight to put the hosts 3-0 up mid-way through the second half. But Leverkusen, who play Villarreal in the Europa League last 16, first leg on Thursday, fought back as Karim Bellarabi netted, then Augsburg's Paul Verhaegh scored an own goal on 80 minutes. In the dying stages, Augsburg defender Jeffrey Gouweleeuw's handball allowed Hakan Calhanoglu to convert a 92nd-minute penalty as Gouweleeuw was sent off. Earlier on Saturday, Wolfsburg warmed up for their Champions League clash at home to Gent on Tuesday with a 2-1 win over Moenchengladach. The win moved Wolfsburg up to seventh ahead of the visit of Gent on Tuesday, with the Germans leading 3-2 from the first leg of their last-16 tie. Eintracht Frankfurt's 1-1 draw at home to Ingolstadt proved to be Armin Veh's last game in charge as he was sacked on Sunday after the club slipped into the relegation places. Having shocked Leverkusen 4-1 on Wednesday when veteran Claudio Pizarro scored a hat-trick, Werder Bremen pulled further away from the relegation zone with another 4-1 thrashing, this time of bottom side Hanover 96. The 37-year-old Pizarro claimed his fourth goal in two games, and also provided an assist for Czech international Theodor Gebre Selassie as Werder moved three points clear of the relegation spots. Stuttgart are up to mid-table after their 5-1 thrashing of second-from-bottom Hoffenheim, who stay five points from safety, as defender Georg Niedermeier netted twice. Schalke are fourth after their 3-1 win at Cologne thanks to goals from Klaas-Jan Huntelaar, Max Meyer and Argentina striker Franco di Santo."

Hertha moved four points clear of fourth-place Bayer Leverkusen, while Cologne stayed ninth in the table after suffering a second straight defeat. Leaders Bayern Munich travel to Wolfsburg on Saturday while Borussia Dortmund, who trail Pep Guardiola's team by eight points, host relegation-threatened Hoffenheim on Sunday."
79,26/02/2016,02:15,Wolfsburg aim to stop Lewandowski making more history,Wolfsburg are desperate to stop history repeating itself when they host Bundesliga leaders Bayern Munich on Saturday following Robert Lewandowski's historic five-gaul haul in the reverse fixture.,"The Poland striker came off the bench and sent Bundesliga records tumbling with his nine-minute blitz single-handedly propelling Bayern to a 5-1 thrashing of Wolfsburg at Munich's Allianz Arena last September. Injury and illness mean Wolfsburg have 12 players either ruled out or struggling to be fit to face Pep Guardiola's league leaders at the Volkswagen Arena. Bayern are eight points clear of second-placed Borussia Dortmund -- and a massive 28 ahead of eighth-placed Wolfsburg. Between them Lewandowski and fellow Bayern forward Thomas Mueller have scored a combined tally of 39 Bundesliga goals -- more than the entire Wolfsburg team. Wolfsburg's ex-Bayern defender Dante says the only way to stop Lewandowski is to cut off his supply. ""If we defend as a team and the ball doesn't come to him, then he can't really do anything,"" said the Brazilian. ""We have to really get things going and be up for the game. ""We have to go into each one-on-one with real passion and every pass must hit the target."" Four days after their 2-2 draw at Juventus in the Champions League, Guardiola is set to rotate his Bayern squad, especially with defenders Holger Badstuber, Jerome Boateng and Javi Martinez all sidelined. Winger Franck Ribery could start his first Bundesliga game for a year, while Wolfsburg coach Dieter Hecking could be down to his third-choice goalkeeper with Diego Benaglio injured and Koen Casteels recovering from flu. On Sunday evening, Dortmund host rejuvented strugglers Hoffenheim. Thomas Tuchel's side is a force to be reckoned with and are unbeaten this season at their Signal Iduna Park stadium having picked up 28 points from a possible 30 at home. Second-from-bottom Hoffenheim earned fresh hope in the relegation battle when they claimed a 3-2 win over Mainz last weekend under their 28-year-old coach Julian Nagelsmann. Dortmund will be without Greek centre-back Sokratis, who is sidelined for three weeks with a groin injury, and Neven Subotic is set to take his place. Hertha Berlin are at Cologne on Friday night hoping to end their run of five league games without a win despite staying third in the table. Hertha coach Pal Dardai will be counting on Ivory Coast striker Salomon Kalou to add to his tally of eight goals scored away from home, the most on the road for any Bundesliga player. Bayer Leverkusen will not have coach Roger Schmidt on their bench for Sunday's match at Mainz. The 48-year-old is banned for three league games, and was fined 20,000 euros ($22,031), for refusing a referee's order to leave the touchline during last Sunday's 1-0 league defeat at home to Dortmund. Mainz are up to seventh in the table and are unbeaten in their last five home games, while Leverkusen's defeat to Dortmund broke their six-game unbeaten run.

80,25/02/2016,15:18,High-flying Hertha out to end winless streak,"They might be third in the Bundesliga table, but Hertha Berlin will take a five-match winless streak in Germany's top flight to mid-table Cologne on Friday.","Only Pep Guardiola's Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund are above Pal Dardai's Hertha, but the capital city club has drawn four and lost one of their last five. There is already a 15-point gulf between them and second-placed Dortmund, but although Hertha are on course for direct qualification to the Champions League, both Bayer Leverkusen and Borussia Moenchengladbach are just a point behind. Hertha have already collected more points this season (36), than the 35 they achieved in the whole of their previous campaign and have won five of their last six visits to Cologne, who are ninth. ""From the way they have developed, they are almost unrecognisable from the end of last season,"" said Cologne's coach Peter Stoeger -- Hertha finished 15th last season, just a point from relegation. A first appearance in the Champions League since 2000 is on the cards. Part of Hertha's success is down to the partnership forged by Ivory Coast striker Salomon Kalou and Vedad Ibisevic, who have bagged 17 league goals between them. In contrast, Cologne are relying solely on the 10-goal tally of the aptly-named French striker Anthony Modeste. ""They have two boys up front in Kalou and Ibisevic, who can practically guarantee goals,"" added Stoeger. ""Hertha have managed to put together a good run of results this season, which we haven't managed to do. ""We must not give them space, because they can recognise situations very quickly and exploit them."" Last September, Ibisevic scored twice in Hertha's 2-0 win over Cologne in Berlin. One of the factors behind Hertha's league success, and run to their first German Cup semi-final in 35 years, has been the silky crossing of right-back Mitchell Weiser. The 21-year-old has been a first-team regular since his transfer from Bayern Munich at the end of last season and has pitched in with five assists in the league. Having come up through Cologne's academy, Weiser is looking forward to his return to the Rhein Energie Stadion. He still holds the record -- 17 years, ten months and three days set in 2012 -- for the youngest player to represent Cologne in the Bundesliga. ""I'm really looking forward to playing there again. I played my first Bundesliga match there and it is a special place for me,"" said Weiser. Having failed to hold down a regular spot under Pep Guardiola at Bayern, Weiser has thrived at Hertha. When a fight with midfielder Anis Ben-Hatira on Hertha's team bus coming back from a game left Weiser with a black eye last month, it was Ben-Hatira who was transferred to Eintracht Frankfurt."
81,13/02/2016,17:48,Mkhitaryan seals Dortmund win to trim Bayern lead,Henrikh Mkhitaryan's superb second-half goal sealed Borussia Dortmund's 1-0 win over Hanover 96 on Saturday to trim Bayern Munich's lead at the top of the Bundesliga to five points.,"Dortmund were without injured star striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, who missed his first league match of the season having netted 20 goals in as many league games. In his absence, Mkhitaryan showed superb individual skill for the winner at Dortmund's Signal Iduna Park. With Marcel Schmelzer screaming up in support on his left, Mkhitaryan cut back inside and curled his right-footed shot around Hanover's Germany goalkeeper Ron-Robert Zieler on 57 minutes. With Pep Guardiola's Bayern at Augsburg on Sunday, Dortmund remain second while Hanover are rooted to the bottom, seven points from safety. Wolfsburg warmed up for Wednesday's Champions League, last 16, first-leg at Ghent with a 2-0 win at home to Ingolstadt to pick up their first victory since knocking Manchester United out of Europe in December. Dieter Hecking's Wolfsburg won for the first time in six games but stay eighth after first-half goals goals by Germany midfielder Julian Draxler and defender Robin Knoche. Bayer Leverkusen moved up from seventh to third as they bounced back from their shock German Cup exit at the hands of Werder Bremen in mid-week with a 2-1 comeback win at Darmstadt. On a heavy pitch, Sandro Wagner stabbed the ball home to give Darmstadt an early lead, despite Leverkusen goalkeeper Bernd Leno catching him around the throat with his forearm. Leverkusen drew level when Darmstadt defender Aytac Sulu headed into his own net on 62 minutes. The visitors then took the lead with a sweeping move which went the length of the pitch. From a Darmstadt corner, junior Julian Brandt started the move he finished by tapping home Kevin Kampl's final pass for the winner on 77 minutes. VfB Stuttgart's impressive form continued as they picked up their fifth-straight league win to go ninth with a 2-0 win at home to Hertha Berlin. A long-range strike from Ivory Coast defensive midfielder Serey Die and a second-half goal from left-wing Filip Kostic sealed the hosts' win. Hertha suffered their first defeat in nine games since losing 2-0 at Bayern in November to drop to fourth. The youngest manager in Bundesliga history made his debut when Julian Nagelsmann, 28, was on Hoffenheim's bench for their 1-1 draw at Werder Bremen in the basement battle. Nagelsmann took over after predecessor Huub Stevens resigned on Wednesday due to heart problems. Despite Hoffenheim taking the lead on 10 minutes through Croatia striker Andrej Kramaric, Werder hit back three minutes later as former Chelsea defender Papy Djilobodji scored his first Bremen goal. The result leaves both teams in the relegation places."
82,10/02/2016,21:20,Haraguchi ends Hertha's 35-year wait to reach cup semis,Hertha Berlin ended their 35-year wait to reach the German Cup semi-finals on Wednesday as Japan midfielder Genki Haraguchi sealed their 3-2 win at snowy second-division side Heidenheim.,"The hosts took an early lead when defender Arne Feick was left unmarked from a free-kick to head home on 10 minutes. But Hertha's Vedad Ibisevic netted twice to put Berlin 2-1 up after 21 minutes as heavy snow fell in southern Germany. Haraguchi scored what proved to be the winner when he beat two defenders on a mazy dribble before beating the goalkeeper on 58 minutes. There was a nervous final few minutes as Heidenheim pulled a goal back when Marc Schnatterer netted a late penalty. Hertha are now just one game away from a home cup final at Berlin's Olympic Stadium on May 21. The last time Hertha was in the last four was in 1985, almost a decade before winger Mitchell Weiser, who set up both of Ibisevic's goals, was born. ""We got off to a bad start, but we ended up dominating. Now we want to reach the final,"" said right-back Weiser. Later, Pep Guardiola's Bayern Munich will attempt to join Borussia Dortmund, Werder Bremen and Hertha Berlin in the last four when they play VfL Bochum. On Tuesday, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang claimed his 30th goal of the season as Dortmund won 3-1 at VfB Stuttgart. Gabon striker Aubameyang and Germany winger Marco Reus, who have provided 45 of Dortmund's goals in all competitions this season, netted before Henrik Mkhitaryan claimed their late third. And veteran Claudio Pizarro helped seal Werder Bremen's 3-1 win at ten-man Bayer Leverkusen by playing a key role in their shock victory. There was a strong Latin American flavour at Leverkusen's BayArena as Bremen booked their place in April's semi-finals. Mexico's Javier Hernandez put Leverkusen ahead, then Bremen's Argentinian centre-back Santiago Garcia levelled before Brazilian defender Wendell was sent off for Bayer just before the half-time break. After Wendall's dismissal, Peru's 37-year-old striker Pizarro scored Bremen's second by converting the resulting penalty, then set up their third. Leverkusen took the lead when ex-Manchester United forward Hernandez continued his record of scoring in each round of the cup. It was his 22nd goal for Bayer this season in all competitions on 22 minutes before limping off with a torn buttock muscle. The lead lasted nine minutes as Bremen's Argentinian centre-back Santiago Garcia put Werder level by hitting the bottom left-hand corner of Leverkusen's net to make it 1-1. Disaster struck for the hosts when Wendell was shown a straight red for hauling down Bartels, who was through on goal, just before the break The 37-year-old Pizarro, who last weekend became the first foreign player to make 400 Bundesliga appearances, hit his eighth goal of the season. Pizarro then played a big part in Bremen's third as his shot was saved by Leverkusen goalkeeper Bernd Leno, but Florian Grillitsch tapped home the rebound on 82 minutes."
83,06/11/2015,23:33,Kalou hat-trick takes Hertha into top four,Ivory Coast striker Salomon Kalou grabbed a hat-trick to steer Hertha Berlin to a 3-1 win at Hanover on Friday and into the top four of the Bundesliga.,The 30-year-old former Chelsea star found the target in the 33rd and 60th minutes before completing his hat-trick with a penalty three minutes from time. Kalou now has seven goals in the Bundesliga this season. Japan's Hiroshi Kiyotake scored Hanover's only goal with a 70th-minute spot-kick.
84,21/08/2015,23:29,Ujah's first league goal for Bremen saves point,Nigeria striker Anthony Ujah scored his first Bundesliga goal for Werder Bremen on Friday to rescue a point in a 1-1 draw at Hertha Berlin.,"The 24-year-old, who signed from Cologne last season, hit a 26th-minute equaliser after Swiss midfielder Valentin Stocker had given the hosts a sixth-minute lead at Berlin's Olympic stadium. The shared point means Hertha missed out on what would have been a club record of two straight wins from their opening matches of the new season to follow on from their 1-0 away win at Augsburg. Bremen take their first league point of the new season after last Saturday's 3-0 drubbing at home to Schalke."
85,09/08/2015,21:04,Motorbike rider opens fire on Hertha Berlin bus,"Shots were fired by an unidentified motorcyclist on the Hertha Berlin team bus, the German Bundesliga team's manager Michael Preetz confirmed on Sunday.","Only the driver was in the bus at the time and was not injured in the incident which came ahead of the team's German Cup match on Monday at second-division Bielefeld in the North Rhine-Westphalia region of western Germany. ""Our driver was going from the hotel to the train station at Bielefeld to collect the team. An unidentified person on a motorbike fired at the bus,"" said Preetz, adding that ""the type of firearm used has not yet been determined"". The club posted a photo on Twitter showing the bus with the impact of a bullet which smashed a hole in the windscreen at the level of the driver's head. Bielefeld police told SID, an AFP subsidiary, that an investigation was underway."

87,03/05/2015,19:41,Late Troare strike fires Gladbach back to third,Guinea's Ibrahima Traore came off the bench to score Borussia Moenchengladbach's winner in their 2-1 victory at strugglers Hertha Berlin on Sunday to reclaim third place in the Bundesliga.,"The game had been heading for a draw after an early goal by Gladbach's Germany striker Max Kruse was cancelled out by a headed equaliser from Hertha's Swiss midfielder Valentin Stocker on 13 minutes. Traore came on after 73 minutes and scored his first goal for Gladbach since joining from Stuttgart last year, drilling home the winner five minutes from time. Lucien Favre-coached Gladbach went back up to third after Bayer Leverkusen had briefly usurped them by beating newly-crowned champions Bayern Munich 2-0 on Saturday with goals by Hakan Calhanoglu and Julian Brandt. With Leverkusen now two points behind Moenchengladbach, the sides will square off at Gladbach's Borussia Park on Saturday in a key clash with the top three in Germany qualifying directly for the Champions League. ""Now we're looking forward to playing Leverkusen, we really want to win that to achieve our goal of direct Champions League qualification,"" said Gladbach's defensive midfielder Granit Xhaka. Hamburg escaped the relegation places for the first time since March after Gojko Kacar's last-gasp goal sealed a 2-1 win at 10-man Mainz. Hamburg were gifted a first-half lead thanks to an own goal when Heiko Westermann's cross clipped Mainz's Julian Baumgartlinger and flew into the net on 37 minutes. Mainz threatened to equalise when South Korea international Joo Ja-Cheol hit the post after some good work by Japan striker Shinji Okazaki on 69 minutes just before the hosts drew level. Spanish midfielder Jairo Bustara put in a cross which Mainz midfielder Yunus Malli fired home. But Hamburg's Serbian international Kacar, who is out of contract at the end of the season, slammed home his shot from just outside the area on 87 minutes to give the visitors the three points. ""It's simply now the case that the players believe they can win, we'll celebrate now, but tomorrow we start preparing for Friday's game against Freiburg,"" said Bruno Labbadia, Hamburg's fourth coach this season. Mainz were reduced to 10 men on 90 minutes when defender Daniel Brosinski was shown a straight red card for fouling Artjoms Rudnevs who was through on goal. There was more bad news for Mainz as veteran Colombia midfielder Elkin Soto, 34, was stretchered off after dislocating his knee in a challenge with Hamburg captain Rafael van der Vaart and will miss the rest of the season. ""I am really sorry, I couldn't do anything about it, I was just going for the ball,"" said Van der Vaart. Hamburg are battling to defend a proud record as the only side in Germany's top flight never to have been relegated. The win drags them up to 14th while Mainz stay tenth. On Saturday, second-placed Wolfsburg gave up a two-goal lead to draw 2-2 at relegation threatened Hanover 96. Wolves' German Cup final opponents Borussia Dortmund also drew 1-1 at Hoffenheim with both sides chasing a Europa League spot for next season, but stay just outside the top six. Fifth place Schalke secured their first win since March with a 3-2 against VfB Stuttgart to keep them on course for next season's Europa League."
88,25/04/2015,20:38,Schweinsteiger strikes as Bayern wait for title,Bayern Munich are virtually guaranteed their 25th German league title after Bastian Schweinsteiger's late goal sealed their 1-0 home win over Hertha Berlin on Saturday.,"Schweinsteiger's 80th-minute winner leaves Bayern 15 points clear in the league table with only four games left and Pep Guariola's side poised to finish the weekend with a third straight Bundesliga title. But Munich's champagne must wait on ice until second-placed VfL Wolfsburg play at Borussia Moenchengladbach when a Wolves' defeat or draw would remove all mathematical doubt and confirm Bayern as champions. After Bayern's stunning Champions League quarter-final win over Porto on Tuesday, Guardiola's side struggled to breach Berlin's goal despite nearly 80 percent possesion. Guardiola used the depth of his squad as teenage midfielder Gianluca Gaudino started for the second week running and fellow 18-year-old striker Sinan Kurt made his debut in the famous red shirt. Bayern finally got the break through when midfielder Mitchell Weiser, who was playing out of position at left-back, beat two defenders on the right and put in a cross which found Schweinsteiger unmarked to fire home. With the title effectively in the bag, Bayern are poised to take the first step towards repeating their 2013 treble of European, league and cup titles. Earlier, Hamburg boosted their hopes of avoiding an historic relegation with a dramatic 3-2 win over Augsburg to climb off the bottom of the table to leap from last to 16th place. Pierre-Michel Lasogga, who has been capped by Germany, was Hamburg's hero with two goals including the crucial late effort. Hamburg are the only team to have never been relegated from Germany's top-flight and Bruno Labbadia's side are now only one point from safety after picking up their first win in 10 matches having raced into a 2-0 lead with only 19 minutes gone. But Germany striker Lasogga sealed the three points just two minutes later when he smashed home his shot. Paderborn drop to bottom of the table ahead of Sunday's home clash with Werder Bremen. Stuttgart remain second from bottom after throwing away a two-goal lead and having Czech midfielder Adam Hlousek sent off for a second yellow card to draw 2-2 at home to Freiburg, who are just two points from the drop zone. Schalke's 2-0 defeat to Mainz on Friday and Augsburg's loss in Hamburg left both Hoffenheim and Borussia Dortmund within striking distance of the Europa League places. Dortmund, the 2013 Champions League finalists who are three points from a European place, romped to a 2-0 win at home to Eintracht Frankfurt. Gabon winger Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang converted a first-half penalty, then set up Japan attacking midfielder Shinji Kagawa's 34th minute strike which left Borussia eighth. Seventh-placed Hoffenheim are two points from a Europa League spot after Adam Schipplock scored their winner in a 2-1 victory over Hanover 96, whose new coach Michael Frontzeck lost his first game in charge having been given a five-game contract to keep them up. Bayer Leverkusen stay third after their 1-1 draw with Cologne as Julian Brandt's first-half goal was cancelled out by Bard Finne's late equaliser in the Rhine derby. Borussia Moenchengladbach can knock Leverkusen from third place -- which carries an automatic Champions League place for next season -- when they host Wolfsburg on Sunday with the rest of the league waiting to see if the result will see Bayern crowned."
89,05/04/2015,19:51,Hertha pull clear of relegation places,Hertha Berlin are set to stay in the Bundesliga next season after their 2-0 home on Sunday pushed visitors Paderborn deeper into the relegation mire.,"Second-half goals by Swiss international Valentin Stocker and midfielder Nico Schulz sealed the win at Berlin's Olympic Stadium to lift Hertha to 11th and seven points above the relegation places. The capital city club are unbeaten in their last four games while second-from-bottom Paderborn are poised for an immediate return to the second division after five defeats and a draw in their last six games. Bottom side Stuttgart, Paderborn and Hamburg are the sides currently in the relegation places with seven games left. Earlier, Schalke 04 and Augsburg's hopes of reaching next season's Champions League suffered a setback after their goalless draw. Roberto di Matteo's Schalke remain fifth in the German league, eight points behind fourth-placed Leverkusen, with the top four in Germany's top flight qualifying for next season's Champions League. Sixth-placed Augsburg are a point behind Schalke and are also destined to play in the Europa League next season alongside Di Matteo's Royal Blues if they keep their current place. Both sides had their chances at Augsburg's SGL Arena, but the point came at a price for Schalke, who lost midfielder Leon Goretzka with a thigh injury after only 15 minutes. The 20-year-old, who won his first cap for Germany last year, was making his first start after an injury-ravaged season. On Saturday, Robert Lewandowski scored against his ex-club Borussia Dortmund to seal league leaders' Bayern Munich's 1-0 win which keeps them on course for a third straight Bundesliga title. Lewandowski's 35th-minute header clinched Bayern's win which left them ten points clear at the top of the table. Their victory underlines Bayern's domination in Germany and came without injured stars David Alaba, Arjen Robben and Franck Ribery. Germany captain Bastian Schweinsteiger limped off with an ankle injury and is doubtful for Wednesday's German Cup quarter-final at Bayer Leverkusen. Dortmund's best chance was when Marco Reus' second-half free-kick was superbly saved by Manuel Neuer as Borussia suffered their first league defeat since the start of February. Borussia Moenchengladbach and Bayer Leverkusen posted big wins as the battle for third-place, and an automatic Champions League spot, intensifies. Third-placed Gladbach enjoyed an impressive 4-1 comeback win at Hoffenheim which keeps them two-points clear of Leverkusen, who recorded a 4-0 win at home over hapless Hamburg. Hosts Hoffenheim took the lead at home to Gladbach when forward Sven Schipplock enjoyed a simple tap-in on 17 minutes, but Gladbach proved their mettle with three goals in ten first-half minutes as winger Patrick Herrmann scored twice. Fourth-placed Leverkusen also underlined their Champions League pedigree by putting Hamburg to the sword and are currently on course for a Champions League play-off place. With the team third from bottom and on course for a first relegation from Germany's top flight, Hamburg sacked Joe Zinnbauer ten days ago. His successor Peter Knaebel could only watch as his team was thrashed as Gonzalo Castro and Stefan Kiessling both scored twice for Leverkusen. Second-placed Wolfsburg remain seven points clear of Gladbach with a 3-1 win at home to bottom VfB Stuttgart. Swiss midfielder Ricardo Rodriguez converted a penalty and a free-kick either side of half-time before ex-Chelsea winger Andre Schuerrle came off the bench to add their third. Freiburg find themselves three-points clear of the relegation zone after their 1-0 win at home to Cologne while Hanover dropped to just above the bottom three with a 2-2 draw at Eintracht Frankfurt. Hanover's Ivory Coast striker Didier Ya Konan rescued his team with a late equaliser, his first for the north German club since his six month sojourn at Saudi Arabian side Al Ittihad Jeddah."

He mimicked breaking off a piece of the wall with the tools at the tourist attraction, the Eastside Gallery. But what remains of the Berlin Wall, which divided Germany's capital from 1961-89, has been under a protection order since 1991. Anyone defacing it can be heavily fined with the authorities set to investigate whether any damage was done. ""I nearly fell off the sofa when I saw the footage,"" Kani Alavi, the chairman of the Eastside Gallery, told the Berliner Kurier newspaper. ""Here we have a well-paid celebrity increasing his market value at the expense of a national monument. Without respect. And with the clear backing of television. Just because there is no security patrolling the Gallery, doesn't mean you can go around doing what you want. If he had done that at the Brandenburg Gate, the player would probably have been arrested."""
91,22/02/2015,19:42,In-form Dost bags brace in Wolfsburg win,Dutch striker Bas Dost's sensational form continued as his double lifted second-placed VfL Wolfsburg to a 2-1 win over Hertha Berlin in the German Bundesliga on Sunday.,"Dost struck early in the game only to see second-bottom visitors Hertha hit back on the half-hour through Julian Schieber. But Wolfsburg stayed eight points behind leaders Bayern Munich after Dost pounced for the winning goal with 16 minutes left. The 25-year-old has now scored nine goals in Wolfsburg's five league matches since the winter break and he also netted twice in Thursday's Europa League game against Sporting Lisbon. Wolfsburg had hit the front after 10 minutes. Dost, who found the net four times in a remarkable 5-4 win against Leverkusen last weekend, swept home first-time from inside the box after Andre Schuerrle had flicked on Vieirinha's pass. But Hertha drew level when Valentin Stocker mugged Sebastian Jung down the left and crossed for Schieber. The former Dortmund striker's diving header from six yards was his seventh goal of the campaign. Schuerrle screwed a shot over before half-time and in the second half the new signing from Chelsea blazed a close-range volley off target after Dost had nodded the ball back to him. Schuerrle missed two further chances before Dost reacted quickest when Luiz Gustavo's thunderous shot from distance crashed back off the post. His 11th league goal of the season condemned Hertha to a fifth defeat in six matches. Meanwhile, an injury-time goal from substitute Branimir Hrgota earned Borussia Moenchengladbach a 1-1 draw at Hamburg and denied the home team some breathing space in their fight against relegation. A well-taken 73rd-minute strike from Zoltan Stieber looked like it might be enough to move Hamburg four points clear of the drop zone, only for Swedish forward Hrgota to power home a header from a corner. The visitors had been hoping to take a firmer grip on third place after results went their way on Saturday but in the end they were relieved to escape with a point. ""Hamburg were very aggressive,"" Gladbach boss Lucien Favre said. ""We had two very good chances at the start and we didn't take them. ""You have to say too that Hamburg fought very well. Bayern drew 0-0 here, Leverkusen lost 1-0 and Hanover lost 2-1 [in the derby]. It's not easy here."" Hamburg had made seven changes to the team that was hammered 8-0 by Bayern last weekend, with out-of-form captain Rafael van der Vaart left on the bench as Joe Zinnbauer sought a strong reaction. And goalscorer Stieber said it was vital that the home side responded well. ""We knew that last week, it was a very bad day for us,"" he said. ""All week long we showed a lot of concentration in training. ""It's tough to lose points in the last seconds but that's football. Nevertheless, we showed that we're a good team."" Gladbach looked more likely to score early on as Max Kruse fired just wide after a swift break from Patrick Herrmann. Before five minutes were up, Herrmann went even closer -- seeing his deflected close-range strike come back off the post. The game looked to be drifting to a goalless draw in the second period but it exploded into life when Artjoms Rudnevs broke at pace before setting up Stieber. The Hungarian attacker curled home into the bottom corner beyond Gladbach 'keeper Yann Sommer. But Gladbach forced a corner two minutes into stoppage time and substitute Raffael cleverly stepped out of the path of the ball to allow Hrgota's header to nestle in the corner. On Saturday, Bayern enjoyed a 6-0 win at 10-man Paderborn, while Augsburg goalkeeper Marwin Hitz scored a stoppage-time equaliser in a 2-2 draw against Bayer Leverkusen. Robert Lewandowksi's first-half double got Bayern on their way, while Arjen Robben is the league's top scorer after getting his 15th and 16th goals of the season."

It was their third straight defeat and Hertha are bidding to avoid their third relegation from Germany's top flight since 2010. Berlin are away to Mainz on Saturday with former player Pal Dardai and ex-assistant coach Rainer Widmayer tipped to take charge as caretaker coaches. Luhukay is the fourth German league coach to be dismissed this campaign after Bremen dismissed Robin Dutt in October, Mirko Slomka from Hamburg in September and Jens Keller at Schalke in October."
93,05/02/2015,11:48,Hertha coach Luhukay facing axe,Hertha Berlin coach Jos Luhukay is in danger of becoming the fourth coach sacked in the Bundesliga this season after his side slipped into the relegation places.,"Their 1-0 defeat at home to Bayer Leverkusen on Wednesday left them second from bottom of the German league as they finished with ten men after Sebastian Langkamp was sent off in the 90th minute for a second yellow card. They have lost their last three games and have won just two of their last ten matches. They are away to Mainz on Saturday and director of sport Michael Preetz refused to say whether Luhukay will be in charge. ""I can't tell you. We need to analyse and sleep on it and then we'll talk,"" Preetz told Sky after the Leverkusen defeat. ""We aren't naive and we can read the table. ""We have now slid down the table and the alarm bells have been ringing for a while."" Hertha started 2015 in poor fashion with a 2-0 defeat at resurgent Werder Bremen on Sunday after being hammered 5-0 at home to Hoffenheim in their last game before Christmas. ""I assume that I will be preparing as well as possible over the next two days for the match against Mainz,"" said Luhukay when asked about his future. The 51-year-old Dutchman took charge in July 2012, while Preetz was director of sport when they were relegated from Germany's top flight in 2010 and again in 2012. A possible dismissal would make Luhukay the fourth German league coach to be sacked this year. Bremen dismissed Robin Dutt in October, Mirko Slomka was released by Hamburg in September and Jens Keller was shown the door at Schalke in October."

Defeat at Bremen drops Hertha to 15th and just above the relegation zone, but things remain tight at the foot of the table with just three points separating the bottom six teams. On Saturday, Borussia Dortmund slipped back to the bottom for the first time since November despite picking up a point in their goalless draw at fellow Champions League side Bayer Leverkusen's BayArena. ""That was an important point. I am happy, we're within striking distance (of mid-table),"" said Dortmund coach Jurgen Klopp, whose side are enduring their worst start to a league season in 30 years. ""I can't preach that we are in a relegation battle and demand champagne football."" Schalke 04's star striker Klaas-Jan Huntelaar will miss Tuesday's Bundesliga clash at leaders Bayern Munich after being sent off in their 1-0 league win over Hanover 96. 'The Hunter', who has claimed seven league goals this season, was shown a straight red for hacking down Hanover's Manuel Schmiedebach five minutes from time. The Royal Blues went ahead at the Veltins Arena when midfielder Marco Hoeger slotted his shot past Hanover's Germany goalkeeper Ron-Robert Zieler with 32 minutes gone. The win lifted Di Matteo's Schalke, who face holders Real Madrid in the last 16 of the Champions League next month, up to fourth in the table. Pep Guardiola's Bayern had their lead cut to eight points on Friday when they suffered a shock 4-1 hammering at second-placed VfL Wolfsburg as the Bundesliga resumed after the winter break. Borussia Moenchengladbach went third in the league on Saturday after Patrick Herrmann netted their second-half goal in a 1-0 win over VfB Stuttgart, who dropped to second from bottom. Herrmann drilled home Branimir Hrgota's swirling cross 20 minutes from time to move Lucien Favre's side up behind leaders Bayern and VfL Wolfsburg. Freiburg's 4-1 win over Frankfurt featured a second-half hat-trick from ex-Bayern striker Nils Petersen, who came off the bench to grab the points for Freiburg which lifted them to 14th and put Dortmund bottom. Cologne pulled away from the relegation zone and up to tenth with a 2-0 win at strugglers Hamburg, who dropped into the bottom three. Cologne picked up their fifth away win, to match Bayern's tally on the road as midfielder Marcel Risse scored both second-half goals. Mid-table Mainz are 11th after romping to a 5-0 win over Paderborn as midfielder Yunus Malli scored twice and set up their third."
95,21/12/2014,17:49,Hertha's Brooks endures Hoffenheim horror,Hertha Berlin defender John Brooks had a Bundesliga afternoon to forget after giving away his side's first two goals in their 5-0 thrashing at home to Hoffenheim on Sunday.,"The USA international turned the ball into his own net on 23 minutes at Berlin's Olympic Stadium, then gave away a penalty three minutes later when he fouled Hoffenheim striker Sven Schipplock. Bosnia midfielder Sejad Salihovic drilled home the penalty, but things went from bad to worse for Berlin. Brook's team-mate Nico Schulz was unlucky to concede a penalty after nudging Hoffenheim captain Andreas Beck who dropped to the pitch on 39 minutes and Salihovic converted his second spot-kick. Hertha failed to put up a fight in the second-half as Schipplock added to the hosts' misery when he walked the ball into an empty net on 74 minutes after Hoffenheim ripped the Berlin defence to pieces on a counter-attack. Germany international Sebastian Rudy then came off the Hoffenheim bench to grab their fifth goal. This was seventh-placed Hoffenheim's biggest victory in their seven years in Germany's top flight while Hertha, 13th, have now leaked nine goals in their last two games after drawing 4-4 at Eintracht Frankfurt on Wednesday. On Saturday, Borussia Dortmund's Bundesliga crisis deepened as they suffered their tenth defeat of the season in losing 2-1 at fellow strugglers Werder Bremen to drop to second from bottom. Bremen's 19-year-old striker Davie Selke curled in a superb early goal from 15 metres out, then Bremen midfielder Fin Bartels converted Selke's cross on 62 minutes. Dortmund's Mats Hummels pulled a goal back when he headed home unmarked at a corner, but it was no more than a consolation. Second-placed Wolfsburg fought back to claim a 2-1 home win against mid-table Cologne later which trimmed Bayern Munich's lead at the top of the table back to 11 points. Defender Dominic Maroh gave Cologne a shock lead after just 11 minutes before Dutch striker Bas Dost equalised five minutes later. Brazil defender Naldo, who scored Wolfsburg's equaliser in their 2-2 draw at Dortmund on Wednesday, then headed the winner from a corner 12 minutes from time. Bayer Leverkusen stay third after coming from behind for a 1-1 draw at home to Eintracht Frankfurt. Eintracht captain Alexander Meier converted a penalty to make him the league's top scorer with 13 goals in 16 games before Leverkusen's Germany winger Karim Bellarabi equalised seven minutes from time. Roberto di Matteo's Schalke 04 stay fifth after being held to a goalless draw at home to Hamburg. Stuttgart remain above the bottom three places after their goalless draw at home to Paderborn. Augsburg fought back for a 2-1 win at home to Borussia Moenchengladbach, who took the lead after only two minutes when Max Kruse converted a penalty before midfielder Markus Feulner and striker Raul Bobadilla scored either side of half-time. On Friday, Bayern broke more league records as Bastian Schweinsteiger and Arjen Robben scored in their 2-1 comeback win at Mainz after Colombia midfielder Elkin Soto had given the hosts' a shock first-half lead. The Mainz result saw Bayern claim new records for the fewest goals conceded in the first-half of a Bundesliga season and their 11-point lead after 17 games is also a new best mark."
96,28/09/2014,17:44,Verhaegh gives Augsburg Bundesliga lift,A first half penalty converted by Dutchman Paul Verhaegh lifted FC Augsburg to seventh in the Bundesliga on Sunday with a 1-0 home win over Hertha Berlin.,"Rightback Verhaegh hammered his spot kick into the left corner after 27 minutes after Hertha keeper Thomas Kraft had taken down Raul Bobadilla in the box. It was all Augsburg needed to pick up their third win this season, pushing Markus Weinzierl's team to nine points, five off fellow Bavarians and leaders Bayern Munich. Eintracht Frankfurt are playing at tailenders Hamburg later Sunday with a chance to move to nine points as well, with their hosts hoping to finally score a goal this season. Reigning champions Bayern Munich extended their lead on Saturday with a 2-0 win at FC Cologne. Bayern kept a clean sheet for their fourth straight Bundesliga match to move to 14 points, two points clear of Borussia Moenchengladbach. Pep Guardiola's Munich opened on 19 minutes as Mario Goetze struck his third goal in the last two matches. The visitors continued to press Cologne and finally doubled the lead midway through the second half as Daniel Halfar put through his own net. Meanwhile, Gladbach won 2-1 at Paderborn thanks to early goals from Patrick Herrmann and Raffael, with Jens Wimmer getting one back for the promoted club, who had been top of the table before losing at Bayern in midweek. Gladbach's win took them above Leverkusen, who had to play more than an hour with 10 men but held on for a 0-0 draw away at SC Freiburg. Leverkusen defender Emir Spahic was sent off in the first half, although Freiburg also finished the game a man down after Pavel Krmas was dismissed. The visitors might have won it but Karim Bellarabi and Son Heung-Min both hit the crossbar in the final 17 minutes. In Gelsenkirchen, Schalke 04 picked up their second straight victory with a 2-1 win at home over bitter rivals Borussia Dortmund. Dortmund's recent defensive struggles continued as goals from Joel Matip and Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting left them trailing 2-0 by the midway point in the first half. Jurgen Klopp's side did reduce the deficit shortly afterwards courtesy of a Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang strike but they could not find an equaliser and have collected only seven points from six games this season, one less than Schalke. In Wolfsburg, Ivica Olic scored in the 57th minute to secure VfL Wolfsburg a 2-1 victory at home against Werder Bremen to jump to seventh with eight points. After Ricardo Rodriguez pushed Wolfsburg ahead in the 15th minute, Marnon Busch equalised for Bremen after 37 minutes. Elsewhere, Hanover 96 went down 1-0 at struggling VfB Stuttgart, Daniel Schwaab scoring his team's first goal at home this season in the 69th minute, while Mainz and Hoffenheim played out a scoreless draw on Friday, the result leaving both teams with 10 points."
97,31/08/2014,13:11,Kalou joins Hertha Berlin from Lille,Ivory Coast international striker Salomon Kalou signed for Bundesliga side Hertha Berlin from French Ligue 1 outfit Lille for a reported fee of between 2.5 and 3million euros ($3.2-3.9million) on Sunday.,"The 29-year-old -- a Champions League winner with Chelsea in 2012 -- signed a three year contract and will be paid 3million euros a year according to local media. ""It is done. Salomon Kalou is now a 'Herthaner'. Welcome,"" tweeted Hertha manager Michael Preetz. Kalou, who had been at Lille since 2012 after a six year spell with Chelsea, will fill the vacuum left by the departure of Colombian striker Adrian Ramos to Borussia Dortmund. Kalou, who opted to play for the Ivory Coast after he failed to receive Dutch citizenship while playing for Feyenoord, enjoyed a successful time with Chelsea winning the FA Cup four times and one Premier League title. Hertha have just one point after two games of the season, losing 4-2 to Bayer Leverkusen on Saturday."
98,30/08/2014,18:00,Leverkusen battle back against Hertha,Bayer Leverkusen moved top of the Bundesliga on Saturday after twice coming from behind to beat Hertha Berlin 4-2.,"Following their impressive win at Dortmund last week, Leverkusen managed to make it two wins from two thanks to late goals from Julian Brandt and Karim Bellarabi. Tim Jedvaj turned into his own net as visitors Hertha took the lead midway through the first half but the Croatian defender made amends when he levelled on 50 minutes. Hertha made it 2-1 on the hour when Julian Schieber nodded in his third goal of the campaign but two minutes later Emir Spahic headed home from a free-kick. Brandt then smashed home with 16 minutes left after Karim Bellarabi struck the bar. Bellarabi, who scored the fastest goal in Bundesliga history last week, rounded off the scoring with a beautiful volley into the corner. Paderborn earned their first win in the Bundesliga with an impressive 3-0 win at Hamburg. Elias Kachunga pounced on the rebound for his second goal in as many weeks after 29 minutes and the midfielder had another disallowed for offside before half-time. Hamburg's Pierre-Michel Lasogga went close to an equaliser before Mirko Vrancic gave Paderborn a two-goal cushion with 21 minutes left after intercepting a pass and rounding Hamburg keeper Rene Adler. Moritz Stoppelkampf added a third late on meaning that - including last season's relegation play-offs - Hamburg have now failed to win their last nine league matches. Cologne also got their first win since returning to the top flight by beating Stuttgart 2-0. Japanese forward Yuya Ozako put the away team ahead after 22 minutes when he headed in from close range. Things got worse for Stuttgart on 33 minutes when Antonio Ruediger, who has just been called up to the Germany squad, badly misjudged a long ball. His weak header back into the centre sat up perfectly for Anthony Ujah, who thumped a volley into the net from outside the penalty area. Hoffenheim meanwhile were unable to keep pace with Leverkusen after they were pegged back in a 1-1 draw at Werder Bremen. Brazilian attacker Roberto Firmino put Hoffenheim in front after 19 minutes but Alejandro Galvez equalised for the home team with 30 minutes left. Vfl Wolfsburg are still waiting on their first victory after being held to a 2-2 draw by visitors Eintracht Frankfurt. Club captain Naldo got Wolfsburg on their way in the first half but the visitors drew level when Takashi Inui's free-kick deflected in off former Eintracht full-back Sebastian Jung. Maximilian Arnold's fine strike looked to have secured all three points for Wolfsburg but Czech forward Vaclav Kadlec's struck a minute after coming on as a substitute to preserve Eintracht's unbeaten start to the season. On Friday, Borussia Dortmund held off a late comeback to win 3-2 in Augsburg for their first win of the season."
99,19/08/2014,02:05,Germany riding crest of wave as Bundesliga begins,The new Bundesliga season gets underway this weekend with German football riding the crest of a wave following the national team's triumph at the World Cup in Brazil last month.,"That thoroughly deserved victory, given to Joachim Loew's side by Mario Goetze's extra-time strike in the final against Argentina, saw a unified Germany crowned as world champions for the first time. But at club level, the Bundesliga has been leading the way for some time. It averaged 3.16 goals per game last season, considerably more than any of its major European counterparts, while average gates were over 42,000, making the German top flight the best attended league anywhere. ""In my opinion, the Bundesliga's the most attractive league in the world,"" Borussia Moenchengladbach coach Lucien Favre told bundesliga.com. ""The hype in Germany is amazing, and now they've won the World Cup so it's not going to tail off in a rush."" Nevertheless, the biggest problem facing the Bundesliga, as ever, is how to counter the dominance of Bayern Munich, who have romped to the title and added the German Cup in each of the last two campaigns. They have seen Toni Kroos and Mario Mandzukic depart and lost Javi Martinez to a serious knee injury in last week's SuperCup defeat to Borussia Dortmund, but the Bavarians remain favourites. And yet the rest can draw some hope from the very fact this is a Bundesliga season immediately following a World Cup, and that has not tended to help Bayern in the recent past. After Germany hosted the 2006 World Cup, Stuttgart went on to win the Bundesliga, while in 2011 Dortmund pipped Bayern to the title. In 2009, after Germany reached the Euro 2008 final, it was Wolfsburg who were champions. Six members of Pep Guardiola's squad played in the World Cup final, including Goetze, while Dante and Arjen Robben were also involved until the latter stages in Brazil. That is why chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge wanted the start of the new season delayed in order to give these players longer to prepare, but that request was unsurprisingly turned down by Bayern's rivals. ""We have to face the fact that the first half of the season will be difficult,"" said Guardiola, who at times had only a skeleton squad in pre-season training. ""We are at least one month behind schedule."" Guardiola has added to his squad with compatriots Juan Bernat from Valencia and Pepe Reina, who will provide competition in goal for Manuel Neuer. But the marquee signing was Robert Lewandowski, a prolific goalscorer for Dortmund in the last four years. However, Dortmund have moved to replace the Pole by signing Italy striker Ciro Immobile from Torino and Colombia's Adrian Ramos from Hertha Berlin. Stability is key at the Signal Iduna Park, where coach Jurgen Klopp, who led Dortmund to back-to-back titles in 2011 and 2012 and a Champions League final defeat to Bayern in 2013, is entering his seventh season in charge. ""We want to establish ourselves further at the top of the league and qualify directly for the Champions League,"" said sporting director Michael Zorc modestly. However, Guardiola knows where the danger lies, saying: ""We may have won the last two league titles, but they clinched the previous two. Our great challenge is to keep up our level to keep them at distance."" Beneath them, Schalke, Bayer Leverkusen and Wolfsburg will again be hoping to contend for Champions League qualification at least. Schalke have kept Klaas-Jan Huntelaar and Julian Draxler, while Sidney Sam has joined from Leverkusen, and few teams can boast a midfield as strong as Wolfsburg, with Kevin de Bruyne, Luiz Gustavo and France's Josuha Guilavogui. Bayer have signed Swiss striker Josip Drmic from Nuremberg and have a new coach in Roger Schmidt, back in his native country after winning the Austrian title with Salzburg. Hamburg will be hoping for a stable campaign after almost being relegated for the first time in their history last season. There are new coaches at Mainz, Eintracht Frankfurt and Stuttgart, who have reappointed Armin Veh, the architect of their 2007 title triumph, while Cologne are back among the elite and Paderborn are in the Bundesliga for the first time."
