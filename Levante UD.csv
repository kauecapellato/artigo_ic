0,30/01/2021,23:24,Real Madrid beaten by Levante to hand Atletico title boost,"Real Madrid had Eder Militao sent off in a 2-1 defeat by Levante on Saturday, handing Atletico Madrid the chance to move 10 points clear at the top of La Liga.","Zinedine Zidane's defending champions sit second in the table, seven points behind Atletico, who have two games in hand and face Cadiz on Sunday. Militao was shown a red card in the ninth minute at the Alfredo di Stefano Stadium, with his team already without their injured captain Sergio Ramos and Covid-stricken coach Zidane. Marco Asensio gave Madrid the lead four minutes later but Jose Luis Morales equalised close to half-time before Roger Marti made up for missing a penalty by scoring the winner. Barcelona coach Ronald Koeman had admitted earlier on Saturday his team ""have to be realistic"" about their chances of overturning Atletico's considerable lead in the table. And with Real Madrid slipping up again, it may now take a seismic collapse for Atletico to miss out on repeating their incredible La Liga triumph in 2014. ""The team were sad in the dressing room,"" said Zidane's assistant David Bettoni, who took charge of the side. ""But they still have the will to fight to the end."" ""You always have to fight, the season ends in May,"" added goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois. ""It is true that Atletico continue to win and are up there. We have to win and hope that the others lose."" It also leaves the Champions League as Real Madrid's only obvious chance of a trophy this season after they lost in the Spanish Super Cup semi-finals and went out to Alcoyano in the Copa del Rey. Madrid face Atalanta next month in the Champions League's last 16. Militao was sent off for bringing down Levante's Sergio Leon, who was darting towards goal when Militao cut across him on the edge of the penalty area. But Madrid gave themselves a lead to hang onto shortly after when Asensio continued his recent resurgence by sprinting onto Toni Kroos' brilliant through ball and finishing into the corner. Levante were dangerous, though, and drew level before the interval as Jorge Miramon's cross to the back post was expertly caught on the half-volley by Morales. Vinicius Junior came on for Madrid in the second half but made the worst possible start by kicking away the leg of Carlos Clerc, who was shown by VAR to have had his right foot inside the area. Courtois pushed away the penalty by Roger and with 11 men, Madrid might have seized the momentum. Instead, their tired legs gave way and a well-worked short corner by Levante gave a clear sight of goal to Roger, who made amends by firing into the corner. Sevilla moved up to third in the table, a point behind Real Madrid, by winning 2-0 away at Eibar. Lucas Ocampos put Sevilla in front with a penalty after the in-form Youssef En-Nesyri took a tumble in the box, before Jordan Moreno slid in at the front post in the second half to seal victory. Villarreal and Real Sociedad had to settle for a point each in their bids for the top four after drawing 1-1 but Valencia moved five points clear of the relegation zone with a 1-0 win over Elche."

2,13/12/2020,23:50,"Messi saves lacklustre Barca, Sociedad reclaim top spot","Lionel Messi saved Barcelona from another embarrassing result by scoring the decisive goal in a 1-0 win over lowly Levante, while Real Sociedad returned top of La Liga on Sunday.","Messi struck with 14 minutes remaining of a lacklustre display from Barca at the Camp Nou which will do little to ease fan fears following their 3-0 hammering at the hands of Juventus midweek. Ronald Koeman's side are still way off the pace in the title race, nine points behind Sociedad who reclaimed first place despite only drawing 1-1 with Eibar. Barcelona do however have two games in hand on the Basque outfit. Atletico are level on 26 points with Sociedad and also have two games in hand while Real Madrid are now just three points behind the leaders having played one less after beating their local rivals 2-0 on Saturday. Villarreal are four points off the lead in fourth after drawing 1-1 at Real Betis, who are one point behind Barca in ninth. ""The team is working well, they gave the maximum,"" said Koeman. ""We still lack a little confidence in ourselves, in our game, but we had a lot of chances, and I have nothing to say about the attitude of the players in this match."" Barca managed to force several saves from Aitor Fernandez, with the Levante goalkeeper doing particularly well to push away a stinging shot from Martin Braithwaite in the 16th minute and Antoine Griezmann's header five minutes later. However the best chance of the opening period fell to Jorge de Frutos in the 12th minute, the Spaniard somehow shooting straight at Marc-Andre ter Stegen after the ball broke kindly for him right in front of goal. Barca continued to dominate possession in the second half but if anything looked less threatening, with Fernandez being called into action largely for shots that were hit straight at him. However with Levante looking more comfortable than a side of their level should at the Camp Nou, Messi saved his team with a clinical finish off the post after collecting Frenkie de Jong's pass. It was hardly the sort of display to honour Sergio Busquets' 593rd appearance for the club, which takes him level at fourth of all time for matches played for Barca alongside Carles Puyol. However the three points are a boost ahead of the visit of Sociedad on Wednesday, which is then followed up by another home clash with Valencia on Saturday. Earlier Ander Barrenetxea gave Real Sociedad the lead in San Sebastian with a thumping strike in the 20th minute, but Sergi Enrich turned home with 25 minutes remaining to send his team 10th on 15 points. Sociedad would have had a bigger gap between them and Atletico had Igor Zubeldia's 80th-minute tap-in not been ruled out by VAR for an extremely tight offside. Sunday's draw was Sociedad's sixth in as many games in all competitions, and came after another 1-1 draw at Napoli on Thursday which saw them squeeze into the last 32 of the Europa League. Granada won 1-0 at Elche in Sunday's other match, a win that keeps them one point ahead of Barcelona."
3,13/09/2020,23:20,Valencia fight back to win six-goal thriller against Levante,"Valencia twice came from behind to beat local rivals Levante 4-2 on Sunday, a welcome boost to morale following a turbulent summer for the club.","Manu Vallejo scored the decisive late goals in a goal-fest at Mestalla after Jose Luis Morales's double for Levante had been cancelled out by Gabriel Paulista and the excellent Maxi Gomez. The victory was Javi Gracia's first since being appointed Valencia coach in July and gets the team off to a positive start in La Liga, despite simmering tensions off the pitch. Manuel Pellegrini also enjoyed a successful start in charge of Real Betis after they won 1-0 away at Alaves. But Unai Emery's first game as coach of Villarreal ended in a 1-1 draw at home to newly-promoted Huesca. Valencia would hope to be challenging the likes of Villarreal for a place in the top four this season but several key players have been sold, with unpopular owner Peter Lim determined to improve the club's financial situation. Gracia said on Friday he felt ""sad"" because the squad had been ""weakened"", a brave move given the board's impatience with previous coaches. Yet this was a gutsy performance that Gracia could have been proud of, even if Valencia were behind after just 37 seconds, Morales weaving his way through four defenders before poking in. Gabriel pulled Valencia level when his header crept inside the near post from a corner but Levante scored again, Morales driving into the top corner after more sloppy Valencia defending. But Valencia came back again, Maxi sliding a shot into the far corner and then Yunus Musah, the 17-year-old who left Arsenal's academy last year, clipped the crossbar with a shot in the second half. Valencia looked more likely to snatch a third and Vallejo kept a cool head when it mattered, tucking a finish into the corner after a smart dummy by Maxi. There was time even for a fourth in injury-time as Maxi pulled clear on the break and when his shot cannoned back off the post, Vallejo was perfectly placed."
4,24/06/2020,01:01,Barcelona grind out Bilbao win to put pressure back on Madrid,"Barcelona limped to a 1-0 win over Athletic Bilbao on Tuesday that sends them back to the top of La Liga, for 24 hours at least, three points ahead of Real Madrid.","Only a goal from substitute Ivan Rakitic in the 71st minute prevented Barca from another stalemate after a draw at Sevilla on Friday had allowed Real to go top on head-to-head. Madrid will return to the summit if they beat struggling Real Mallorca on Wednesday but Barcelona's victory at least puts the pressure back on Zinedine Zidane's side, whose upward momentum is yet to be reflected by the table. This Barca performance though was hardly a statement of intent, devoid of chances, lacking zip and tinged with frustration rather than the free-flowing football Quique Setien was appointed to bring in. ""We knew it was going to be complicated,"" Setien said. ""Also because of the situation there is some anxiety because there's less and less margin for error. ""Sometimes we didn't play with that composure and that showed in the first half when were more inaccurate than usual. We gave some belief and confidence to Athletic."" Lionel Messi looked particularly wearied by his team's display. The Argentinian was creator-in-chief again but the dependence on him was high and he remains one away from the 700th goal of his career. Rakitic is likely to be among a handful of players allowed to leave this summer. He has not been a regular this season and this was his first Barca goal since the Clasico in March last year. ""It's a difficult period but we have to stick together,"" said Rakitic. ""It was an important goal, it was a tough game, it was hard for us to open the game up."" Arthur Melo started, despite reports he could be close to joining Juventus, and struggled. Sergio Busquets picked up a yellow card and will be suspended against Celta Vigo on Saturday but that should be a simpler assignment than the ones that come after against in-form Atletico Madrid and Villarreal. Athletic Bilbao stay 10th after suffering their first defeat since La Liga returned. They created the better chances in the first half. Inaki Williams, playing his 150th game in a row, darted in behind and Yeray Alvarez should have scored when free at the back post but missed from four yards. Messi cut a frustrated figure as he tried to create a spark but his efforts from distance, including one chip easily collected, hinted at desperation too. In the second half, Messi's lifted pass found Antoine Griezmann clear in the area but Unai Simon was quick to close the space and Griezmann failed to react. Griezmann's disappointing night came to an end when he was replaced by Ansu Fati, who headed over with his first touch. Riqui Puig also came on and it was the 20-year-old's pass that started the attack for the goal. Messi crossed to the back post and Arturo Vidal's header should have been cleared by Mikel Balenziaga. Instead, he gave it back to Messi, whose reverse pass was taken on by Rakitic, who bundled through and finished. Raul Garcia had an open net late on after Gerard Pique and Marc-Andre ter Stegen both evaded a cross but he failed to connect. Fati struck the post with a rebound in injury-time. Earlier, Atletico Madrid continued their surge towards Champions League qualification by winning 1-0 at Levante to climb to third, thanks to an early own goal by Bruno Gonzalez. Since matches restarted in Spain two weeks ago, Atletico have taken 10 points from a possible 12 and are now six points clear of fifth, as their top-four rivals have crumbled around them. One of them is Getafe, who continued their post-suspension slump as they were held to a 1-1 draw against struggling Real Valladolid. Getafe are fifth but without a win in the four games since La Liga resumed. Valladolid are 15th, seven points clear of the relegation zone. Levante stay 11th."
5,15/06/2020,21:50,Late own goal sees Sevilla stutter in Champions League chase,Sevilla suffered a setback in their bid to qualify for next season's Champions League group stage as a late own goal by Diego Carlos allowed visiting Levante to grab a 1-1 draw on Monday.,"Julen Lopetegui's side, who sit third in La Liga, hold a five-point lead over fifth-placed Getafe, although most of their closest rivals still have to play in this round of matches. The five-time Europa League winners, who last played in the Champions League in 2017-18, are four points clear of fourth-placed Real Sociedad, with Atletico Madrid, Valencia, Granada and Villarreal also in the top-four hunt. The closest either side came to goal in the first period was when visiting winger Munir El Haddadi's brilliant free-kick crashed against the crossbar. Sevilla did take the lead in the first minute of the second half, as former Barcelona player El Haddadi teed up Dutch striker Luuk de Jong to score his sixth league goal of the season. Levante managed to create some late pressure and centre-back Carlos put through his own net three minutes from time after a mix-up with goalkeeper Tomas Vaclik. The draw helped 12th-placed Levante move 10 points clear of safety with nine matches to play. Later on Monday, Roberto Soldado rescued Granada a 2-2 draw at Real Betis in a dramatic game which saw three goals in the final six minutes. The away side looked set to move within three points of Sociedad as they led late on through Carlos Fernandez's 29th-minute strike, but Sergio Canales equalised from the spot with five minutes to play, before Cristian Tello put the hosts in front. Former Spain striker Soldado had the final say though, as the 35-year-old substitute snatched a point in injury time which moved Granada above Villarreal into eighth."
6,13/06/2020,00:19,Valencia and Getafe stumble in La Liga race for top four,Ten-man Levante scored a 98th-minute penalty on Friday to snatch a 1-1 draw against Valencia as La Liga completed its second day of fixtures since its return from the coronavirus suspension.,"It was a miserable night for the league's top-four hopefuls as Granada also came from behind to beat Getafe 2-1, meaning Atletico Madrid and Real Sociedad have the chance to capitalise on Sunday. Valencia looked to have grabbed a later winner themselves at an empty Mestalla when Rodrigo Moreno diverted in at the near post in the 89th minute. But Mouctar Diakhaby pulled down Ruben Vezo deep into injury-time and Gonzalo Melero made no mistake, equalising for Levante from the spot. The visitors also had Roger Marti sent off for a second yellow card in the 74th minute. Granada, also playing behind closed doors at Los Carmenes, scored in the 70th and 79th minutes as a Djene Dakonam own-goal and Carlos Fernandez's finish wiped out Getafe's lead, given to them in the first half by David Timor. Defeat means Getafe stay fifth, handing Atletico the chance to overtake them if they can win away at Athletic Bilbao on Sunday. Valencia remain seventh, three points of adrift of Real Sociedad, who are at home on Sunday to Osasuna. Granada, who were only promoted last season, move up to eighth, with the Europa League places now in sight while Levante edge up to 12th. La Liga became the second of Europe's five major leagues after the German Bundesliga to resume on Thursday, when Sevilla overcame Real Betis 2-0 in the division's first match since March 10. League leaders Barcelona play away at Real Mallorca on Saturday before Real Madrid, two points behind in second, return at home to Eibar on Sunday."
7,13/05/2020,14:06,"'I am innocent', says former Colombia striker Congo after anti-drugs operation",Former Real Madrid player Edwin Congo has claimed his innocence after being released following his arrest in Spain on Tuesday as part of an operation into cocaine trafficking.,"Congo, who retired in 2009, never played for Madrid's first team, instead spending time on loan at Real Valladolid, Vitoria Guimaraes in Portugal and Toulouse in France. The 43-year-old Colombian said he is innocent and has no connection with the smuggling of cocaine. ""I am innocent, I have absolutely nothing to do with the sale, manufacture or anything that has to do with cocaine,"" Congo told La Sexta on Tuesday night. Congo was arrested on Tuesday along with ten other people in a police operation concerning a cocaine trafficking network. He was released after being questioned by the police. ""I have links to people who are involved,"" said Congo. ""But to go from that to saying that I have changed my life or done something extraordinary..."" Congo joined Madrid in 1999 but enjoyed more success after moving to Levante in 2002."
8,02/11/2019,17:57,Barcelona slip to shock defeat after Levante goal flurry,Lionel Messi scored again but was helpless to prevent Barcelona conceding three goals in seven minutes on Saturday as Levante stormed to a surprise 3-1 victory in La Liga.,Messi converted a first-half penalty at the City of Valencia stadium for his sixth goal in five games only for Levante to stun the defending champions with an incredible treble shortly after the hour. Jose Campana and Borja Mayoral scored in the 61st and 63rd minutes before Nemanja Radoja added a third in the 68th to finish Barca off and give Real Madrid the chance to move top of the table later on Saturday.
9,15/09/2019,13:21,"Teenager Fati lights up Barca, Benzema brilliance inspires Real","Ansu Fati, the 16-year-old starlet from Guinea Bissau, scored his second goal of the season as Barcelona breezed to a 5-2 win against Valencia on Saturday.","Karim Benzema netted twice for Real Madrid as they fought off a late comeback to beat Levante 3-2 as Eden Hazard made his La Liga debut. Atletico Madrid retained their place at the top of the table, but only by one point from Real Madrid after their first defeat of the season when they lost 2-0 at Real Sociedad at the Basque club's newly refurbished stadium. With Lionel Messi still out and watching from the stands at the Camp Nou it was left to Fati take the plaudits. Fati, who became the third youngest scorer in La Liga history when he came off the bench to net in a 2-2 draw at Osasuna this month, scored in the second minute, before providing the assist for Frenkie de Jong's seventh minute goal. The teenager got a standing ovation when he came off after an hour. Barca coach Ernesto Valverde marvelled at Fati's composure. ""It's not usual that on his first touch he scores, and on his second he sets up a goal,"" he said. ""To get used to being a Barca player is work for anyone, even more so for a boy so young, but he's a balanced kid, he strikes me as being at ease."" Kevin Gameiro got Valencia off the mark but a brace from the fit-again Luis Suarez meant Max Gomez's injury time second for the visitors was purely academic. The defeat left Valencia with just four points from four matches, leaving new coach Albert Celades -- a former Real Madrid assistant coach -- with a huge amount of work to do before the club play their first Champions League group game against Chelsea on Tuesday. At a rain-drenched Santiago Bernabeu, Benzema's goals came just six minutes apart in the first half before Casemiro put Real 3-0 up. However Levante, who had won their previous two outings, made a fight of it in the second half as they pulled goals back through Borja Mayoral and Gonzalo Melero. ""The second half was more difficult for us, but the overall feeling was positive,"" said coach Zinedine Zidane, whose team had drawn their previous two games. ""We have got the three points and we were incredible in the first half, the way we played, the goals, the commitment. We just need to stay focused for the full 90 minutes."" Hazard also came off the bench for the final half-hour to make his first La Liga appearance after a thigh injury had interrupted the start of his Real career following his 100 million-euro ($110 million) move from Chelsea. The Belgian could now start when Real go to Paris Saint-Germain for their opening Champions League game on Wednesday. ""I am happy for him,"" said Zidane. ""He will do us good. He is not ready yet though -- he has only trained four times with the team. But when everyone is fit, when we have our rhythm, we will hurt teams."" Gareth Bale will also be available to face PSG after suspension kept him out on Saturday, but Sergio Ramos will be unable to play because of a European ban. Real would have won by a greater margin here had it not been for some inspired goalkeeping from Aitor Fernandez, who produced a stunning one-handed stop to keep out a Benzema shot midway through the first half."
10,14/09/2019,15:12,Real Madrid hang on for win after Benzema brilliance,"Karim Benzema scored twice on Saturday in an outstanding performance for Real Madrid against Levante, although his side were left hanging on for a 3-2 win on the day Eden Hazard made his La Liga debut.","Benzema's goals came just six minutes apart in the first half at a wet Santiago Bernabeu, before Casemiro put Real 3-0 up. However Levante, who had won their previous two outings, made a fight of it in the second half as they pulled goals back through Borja Mayoral and Gonzalo Melero. ""The second half was more difficult for us, but the overall feeling was positive,"" said coach Zinedine Zidane, whose team had drawn their previous two games. ""We have got the three points and we were incredible in the first half, the way we played, the goals, the commitment. We just need to stay focused for the full 90 minutes.""

He is not ready yet though -- he has only trained four times with the team. But when everyone is fit, when we have our rhythm, we will hurt teams."" Gareth Bale will also be available to face PSG after suspension kept him out here, but Sergio Ramos will be unable to play because of a European ban. Zidane was also without the injured Luka Modric here. However, as well as Hazard, fellow summer signing Eder Militao came off the bench in the second half and the former Porto defender could start in Paris. Real would have won by a greater margin here had it not been for some inspired goalkeeping from Aitor Fernandez, who produced a stunning one-handed stop to keep out a Benzema shot midway through the first half. However, the hosts went ahead shortly after that when Dani Carvajal crossed from the right for Benzema to bullet home a header. The Frenchman struck again in the 31st minute, with James Rodriguez pouncing when Sergio Postigo headed the ball down into his path, and teeing up Benzema to score his fourth of the campaign. ""I have been hearing for ages after matches that Karim put in his best performance,"" said Zidane. ""That's enough of that! It means that he has been playing well for a while."" Benzema was also involved in the build-up to the third goal five minutes before the interval, which concluded with Vinicius Junior squaring for Casemiro to finish. Levante pulled one back in the 49th minute as Carlos Clerc crossed from the left to the near post where Mayoral -- on loan from Real -- converted. Benzema then curled a shot against the post, while Vinicius had a goal disallowed and Hazard tested Fernandez, but it was Levante who scored again. Substitute Melero proved too strong for Carvajal at the far post as he headed in a marvellous cross by Jose Campana, yet Madrid held out. Leaders Atletico Madrid will seek their fourth win in as many La Liga games when they play later at Real Sociedad in the first game at the Basque club's newly refurbished stadium. Barcelona are also in action at home to Valencia, who this week sacked coach Marcelino Garcia Toral, replacing him with the former Real Madrid assistant coach Albert Celades."
11,18/05/2019,15:45,Griezmann whistled as Atletico come back to draw with Levante,Antoine Griezmann was jeered during his last game for Atletico Madrid and Rodrigo might have scored his final goal for the club as they came from behind to draw 2-2 against Levante in La Liga on Saturday.,"Griezmann received whistles at the City of Valencia Stadium from the visiting fans, who were also heard chanting ""out, out, out"" before goals from Sergio Camello and Rodrigo ensured Atletico at least ended the season with a draw. Diego Simeone has dismissed fears of a mass exodus, despite both Diego Godin and Griezmann already announcing their departures, with the likes of Rodrigo, Juanfran and Filipe Luis all expected to follow. If this was to be their farewell outing for Atletico, it was an underwhelming finale as Levante, who only secured safety from relegation last weekend, claimed a deserved point. They might have been disappointed not to take all three after leading 2-0 at half-time thanks to goals from Erick Cabaco and Roger Marti before then playing against 10 men for the best part of 40 minutes after Angel Correa was sent off. But Atletico fought back, Rodrigo firing into the top corner before 18-year-old substitute Camello scored his first goal for the club, finishing at the back post. Griezmann was unable to add to his tally of 133 goals in 257 games across all competitions in what became a bitter end to his five successful seasons for the club. Godin was given a rousing goodbye ceremony at the Wanda Metropolitano last weekend but the timing of Griezmann's announcement, perhaps deliberately, meant he avoided a last meeting with the Atleti fans. But those that made the trip to Valencia were determined to make their displeasure known and it was noticeable that Griezmann made a swift exit after the final whistle. Camello, born in Madrid and a product of Atletico's academy, delivered a more positive message for the future and a timely reminder of Atletico's ability to endure in recent years, despite the departures of their biggest stars. Levante took the lead through a brilliant opener from Cabaco, who flicked in with the back of his heel after a header back from Ruben Vezo. Roger doubled the advantage shortly before half-time, intercepting a loose pass from Thomas Partey before skipping over Rodrigo and firing past Antonio Adan, who was standing in for the injured Jan Oblak. Atletico's task became more difficult when Correa was sent off for a petulant kick on Chema but Rodrigo gave them hope with a stunning strike into the top corner, before Koke's shot fell kindly for Camello at the back post."
12,27/04/2019,23:56,La Liga belongs to Barca again as dominance leaves rivals in turmoil,Barcelona may yet prove they are the best team in Europe but they are indisputably the best in Spain after they wrapped up their fourth La Liga title in five years on Saturday.,"Barca are now nine points clear of Atletico Madrid with three games left to play, while Real Madrid look set to finish a second consecutive season trailing the champions by double figures in terms of points. The failings of Real, who now own the pitiful record of winning the league only once in seven years, are laid bare by the table but a smaller margin flatters Atletico too, masking what has, in truth, been a procession for the best part of four months. ""Our first goal is consistency, being the best every day,"" Ernesto Valverde said in September. At the start of January, Barca's advantage was five points, February six, March seven and April eight. Some then hoped there could be a race when they drew 4-4 at Villarreal but a few days later they had beaten Atletico and that was that. The stuttering form of those beneath them has certainly helped. Even if Barcelona had collapsed, Real were too far behind to capitalise while Atletico, fragile away from home, have never looked capable of the winning run required. ""For us next year, the league must be our number one priority,"" Real coach Zinedine Zidane said on Wednesday. But the faults of the Madrid pair belong to them not Barca, who have now been crowned kings of Spain eight times in 11 years, a period of dominance that was started by the historic treble-team of Pep Guardiola, consolidated under Luis Enrique and now elongated by Valverde. ""What we have done over the last years will go down in history,"" said Sergio Busquets. Valverde may never convince those who take his pragmatism to be a sign of mediocrity and his veering from the iconic style of Guardiola as contrary to the ideals of Barcelona. Winning the Champions League would surely appease the doubters, particularly if it amounted to Valverde's own treble, with a Copa del Rey final against Valencia to come next month in Seville. ""We have to close out the title as soon as possible, without letting go,"" Lionel Messi said. ""Then we can think about Liverpool and the semi-finals."" But the reputation of this Barcelona team, and their coach, is unfairly shaped by what has gone before, not least because most of those players have gone too. Messi, Busquets and Gerard Pique were the only ones present both in 2009 and 2019. Instead, Valverde adapted, by retaining some of the old, attacking verve while adding athleticism, shape and defensive discipline. When he arrived, two Super Cup defeats to Madrid prompted Pique to admit Barca felt inferior. Not now. Madrid, thrashed 5-1, Huesca, hammered 8-2, Sevilla, twice beaten 4-2, Espanyol, Levante and Real Betis, each sent packing 4-0, 5-0 and 4-1 respectively, are all testament to this Barcelona's exhilarating streak. Messi's 34 goals are too. If he can find four more in the three games left, it will be his best La Liga return since his 43 in 2015. His partner, Luis Suarez, has 21 and together, they have scored more than every team in the division except Real Madrid and Sevilla. But it was far from a two-man show. Many times, goalkeeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen came to the rescue while Jordi Alba has scored and assisted more goals than any other defender in the league. Pique has been immense in recent months and alongside him Clement Lenglet has made light of an injury-spoiled year for Samuel Umtiti. Arthur Melo looks a future star in midfield while Ousmane Dembele's early problems with fitness and indiscipline have given way to the scintillating talent that convinced Barca he was worth 105 million euros two years ago. There have been concerns too. Defensively, Barcelona were suspect until Christmas and Busquets, who turns 31 in July, has too often been exposed in midfield. Both issues could yet resurface against Liverpool next week. Philippe Coutinho left Anfield to join the elite but is yet to find his place. The January signings of Jeison Murillo and, in particular, Kevin-Prince Boateng were bizarre. But none of those blips derailed the dominance of Barca. Instead, Real Madrid were persuaded to sack their coach, twice, while Atletico kept theirs but now face an exodus of players in the summer. For both, uncertainty is the result of inferiority. Neither could argue that in 2018/19, Barcelona were not, by a distance, better than the rest."
13,24/02/2019,23:28,Blank-faced Bale earns Madrid battling win over Levante,Gareth Bale came off the bench to score a controversial winning penalty against Levante on Sunday but his refusal to celebrate suggested all may not be well again at Real Madrid.,"Bale's spot-kick earned Madrid a battling and, in truth, undeserved 2-1 victory at the City of Valencia Stadium where referee Ignacio Iglesias failed to reverse his decision, despite VAR exposing a theatrical dive from Casemiro. The absence of any delight from a stony-faced Bale was telling, as he turned and brushed off team-mates' attempts to congratulate him. This was his sixth game on the bench in the eight matches since he returned from injury in January and it remains to be seen if his cameo will be enough to win him a start against Barcelona on Wednesday, in the semi-final of the Copa del Rey. Bale replaced Karim Benzema in the 74th minute, after the Frenchman had scored his own penalty in the first half before Roger Marti pulled Levante level. Levante had already twice hit the post by then and Madrid will be relieved to have escaped with the points that keep them nine behind Barca, and two back on Atletico, who had earlier beaten Villarreal. Alvaro Morata scored his first Atleti goal at the Wanda Metropolitano, toasting his smart finish by poking fun at VAR, which had twice intervened to prevent him opening his account at his new club. Real Madrid have been among the most vocal critics of VAR in La Liga this season but Levante were the ones hard done by this time. Cheick Doucoure's swinging right foot was wild but there was no contact to merit the leap from Casemiro. Iglesias reviewed but retained his decision. Barcelona, whom Real now face in two Clasicos in four days, the second in the league, also at the Santiago Bernabeu, will now benefit from an extra day's rest and also a suspension for Nacho, who was sent off late on for a second yellow card. Madrid's humiliation at the hands of Barca proved the final straw for Julen Lopetegui in October but it was the defeat at home by Levante the week before that had pushed their coach to the brink. Only four of the side that started that day were in Santiago Solari's team, with Sergio Ramos banned and Bale on the bench. Levante dominated for the majority of the first half but missed three golden chances. Roger was most guilty, poking onto the post from three yards out, and then nipping in behind but again hitting the woodwork, when Thibaut Courtois had left the corner open. In between, Madrid took the lead against the run of play. The penalty took everyone by surprise, brought back to a Luka Modric cross blocked by the raised arm of Enis Bardhi. It was the correct call and Benzema made no mistake. Levante had been the better side and found an equaliser just before the hour, Luis Morales pulling back for Roger, who beat Nacho to the ball and expertly angled a finish into the far corner. The game was now in the balance. The lively Vinicius Junior sped in behind but was denied by the hand of Aitor Fernandez. Bale came on for Benzema and was soon called into action as Doucoure swung and missed, prompting Casemiro to tumble. Bale slid the ball into the corner. Nacho was sent off late on and so was Levante's Ruben Rochina on the bench, punished for taking his protests too far. Levante deserved more but Madrid held on. Atletico's victory was more comfortable as Barcelona's closest challengers kept up the chase with a 2-0 win over Villarreal. Since joining Atletico on loan from Chelsea last month, Morata has twice had goals ruled out on review so when this one finally stood at the Wanda Metropolitano, he celebrated by imitating a referee putting a finger to his ear. ""At last it came, and with a victory too, so I'm going home happy today,"" Morata said. ""Until I saw all the officials in the stadium had given the goal, I didn't want to celebrate too much."" Saul Niguez added a late second for Atletico, who sustain momentum after they blew away Juventus on Wednesday in the Champions League."
14,20/10/2018,16:04,Pressure mounts on Lopetegui as Madrid beaten by Levante,Real Madrid failed to ease the pressure on coach Julen Lopetegui and instead set the record for the longest goal-drought in the club's history during a surprise 2-1 defeat by Levante on Saturday.,"Madrid have now gone five games without a victory and by the time Marcelo gave them hope of a comeback at the Santiago Bernabeu, they had gone 481 minutes without a goal too. The club's previous worst run had been 464 minutes, in 1985. For a team that prides itself on flair and flamboyance, it is a streak that reflects just as badly on Lopetegui as the results, which could leave Real Madrid four points adrift of Barcelona later on Saturday, with a 'Clasico' to come next weekend at the Camp Nou. Asked about his future, Lopetegui said: ""It is the last thing I am thinking about. I am thinking only about lifting the players."" If Barca's players were watching, they would have been licking their lips at the sight of Raphael Varane handing Levante a two-goal lead here after just 13 minutes. Jose Luis Morales and Roger Marti, from the penalty spot, were the beneficiaries. At the final whistle, Lopetegui stood on the touchline, with his hands on his hips, staring ahead in disbelief. He had left Gareth Bale and Karim Benzema on the bench, perhaps due to fitness issues, and the gamble backfired, despite both making a difference when brought on in the second half. Lopetegui had cited a lack of luck in recent weeks and Madrid were not blessed with it here. They hit the crossbar twice and the post once. They suffered a two-goal swing as a result of the Video Assistant Referee, one against called as a penalty, and one ruled out for offside. ""I'm sure football will eventually give back to us what it is taking away,"" Lopetegui said. But a single goal, from their 30-year-old left-back, in over eight hours is no fluke, and neither are the defensive lapses that could have seen Levante add more to their early double. Paco Lopez took charge of Levante in March and oversaw eight wins from 11 to avoid relegation. This season they are now seventh, a point behind Madrid. ""I told the guys talent has its limits, but faith and conviction do not,"" Lopez said. ""This team believes in what they are doing."" Levante were two up in 13 minutes and both came from Varane mistakes. The first was more blatant as he misjudged the flight of Sergio Postigo's through ball, allowing Morales to nick it round Thibaut Courtois and fire into the open net. It got worse as Varane handled and VAR advised the error had been inside the box. Roger converted the penalty. For the rest of the half, Madrid were scatty and imprecise, their finishing spoiled by bad luck but a lack of composure too. VAR proved their undoing again, ruling Marco Asensio's follow-up offside after Casemiro headed against the crossbar. Mariano was also denied by the woodwork while Ramos and Lucas Vazquez missed from three yards. At half-time, there were a scattering of white handkerchiefs -- the traditional expression of discontent -- but more whistles. After the restart, the home fans sang ""echale huevos"", meaning, ""play with some balls"". Lopetegui had thrown Bale on at the interval while Benzema and Dani Ceballos were introduced on the hour. Not before the 56th minute, when Madrid's drought became their longest ever. Benzema shot straight at Oier Olazabal, who then pushed a bending Bale free-kick wide. Finally, Madrid scored, with that pair involved again as Bale flicked on to Benzema and Marcelo drove home. Madrid believed as Benzema struck the far post with a curling effort and Mariano thought he had grabbed an equaliser in the 87th minute. The striker, however, had strayed just offside. For Madrid, it was not to be."
15,20/10/2018,14:24,Real Madrid set club record for goalless run,"Real Madrid set the unwanted record of the longest goal drought in the club's history on Saturday by surpassing 464 minutes without scoring, against Levante.","Madrid's previous longest drought was in 1985 when the Spanish league giants went 464 minutes without scoring. Madrid kicked off at the Santiago Bernabeu, having gone 409 minutes without finding the net and as they still trailed Levante 2-0 in the 56th minute, their fruitless streak had extended to more than seven hours, at 465 minutes. The last Madrid goal came against Espanyol on September 22, scored by Marco Asensio, before Julen Lopetegui's struggling side drew blanks against Sevilla, Atletico Madrid, CSKA Moscow and Alaves. Lopetegui took charge in the summer after being sacked by Spain on the eve of the World Cup but pressure on the 52-year-old is mounting. After Levante, who scored twice through Jose Luis Morales and Roger Marti's penalty, Madrid play Viktoria Plzen in the Champions League on Tuesday and then Barcelona in La Liga on Saturday."
16,19/08/2018,00:25,"Messi, Coutinho get Barcelona off to winning start",Two goals from Lionel Messi either side of a Philippe Coutinho strike allowed Barcelona to start their defence of the Spanish title with a 3-0 win over Alaves at the Camp Nou on Saturday night.,"Wearing the captain's armband following the departure of Andres Iniesta to Japan, Messi stepped up to send a cheeky second-half free-kick under the jumping wall and into the net for the opener, and Barca's 6,000th La Liga goal. Coutinho, who had come off the bench, lashed in the second goal before Messi added gloss to the scoreline in stoppage time, with the clock having ticked past midnight in Catalonia. While they took their time to get going, it was an ideal opening result for Ernesto Valverde's side, who are hoping to once again see off the challenges of Real Madrid and Atletico Madrid in the battle for the title. While Cristiano Ronaldo has left Real for Juventus, Messi remains as the figurehead at Barcelona and he won his 33rd trophy with the club in the Spanish Super Cup victory over Sevilla last weekend. The 31-year-old will be aiming to put behind him the desperate disappointment that was Argentina's World Cup campaign, and he was unlucky not to get a hat-trick here. Messi saw a free-kick crash back off the bar late in the first half after going over the wall, so when he was handed another chance from a similar position in the 64th minute, he changed tack. This time, 22 yards out, he surprised the jumping Alaves defenders by going underneath and giving Fernando Pacheco in goal no chance. He then sent another curling effort off the post soon after. Coutinho started the match on the bench alongside summer signings Arthur, Malcom, Clement Lenglet and Arturo Vidal. However, he was sent on at the start of the second half and his goal seven minutes from the end effectively killed the game. The Brazilian had just squandered one chance after being played in by Messi when he picked up a pass from compatriot Arthur before lashing in, ensuring victory on the opening weekend for Barca for the 10th consecutive season. Messi, the top scorer in La Liga last season, then controlled a ball into the box on his chest before slotting in his second and his team's third in stoppage time. After the departures of Ronaldo and Zinedine Zidane, Real play their first league game under new coach Julen Lopetegui on Sunday night when they entertain near neighbours Getafe. Last season's runners-up Atletico, fresh from beating Real 4-2 after extra time in the UEFA Super Cup in Tallinn in midweek, start at Valencia on Monday. Elsewhere on Saturday, former Arsenal midfielder Santi Cazorla played his first competitive game in almost two years following a nightmare time with injuries. The 77-times capped Spanish international, who is now 33, suffered a serious Achilles injury playing for Arsenal in the Champions League in October 2016. After eight operations, the little attacking midfielder suffered a serious infection in the tendon that almost led to an amputation. But he fought back and recently returned to Villarreal, seven years after his departure for Malaga. Cazorla started in Villarreal's season-opener at home to Real Sociedad, as his side took a first-half lead through Gerard Moreno. However, the visitors fought back to win 2-1 with goals from Willian Jose and Juanmi, giving the Basque club's new coach Asier Garitano the perfect start. The other winners so far on the opening weekend are Levante, who triumphed 3-0 at Betis on Friday."
17,18/05/2018,00:15,Stars set to say farewell on La Liga's final weekend,La Liga's winners and losers are settled and the European qualification spots decided but for a collection of star players the final weekend of the season will be anything but a dead rubber.,"Here, we look at five talking points ahead of the last weekend in La Liga: Zinedine Zidane would appear to have it clear in his mind what does and does not work in Europe. Through Real Madrid's journey to the final, he has put great faith in the likes of Lucas Vazquez and Marco Asensio while Gareth Bale, Isco and even Karim Benzema have found their places less secure. Benzema and Isco, however, have proven their coach's stance can be turned and now Bale must try to follow suit. His man-of-the-match performance against Celta Vigo last weekend would surely have made an impact on Zidane and another similar display against Villarreal on Saturday might sneak him a starting spot in the final. Cristiano Ronaldo has shaken off an ankle sprain but the decision is whether to risk the Portugese's fitness this weekend or, by leaving him out, his sharpness against Liverpool. After 674 matches and 22 years associated with the club, Andres Iniesta will bid farewell to Barcelona, who host Real Sociedad on Sunday. A grand closing ceremony is planned, with the Camp Nou crowd set to form the message 'Infinito Iniesta' on both sides and Iniesta's number eight at either end. After the match, the 34-year-old will lift the La Liga trophy and it is likely Barca coach Ernesto Valverde will substitute his midfielder to allow the club's fans one final standing ovation. Torres' departure will be no easier to stomach for Atletico, whom the forward has supported since he was five years old. An 128th goal for the club against Eibar on Sunday would bring the house down. Atleti won the Europa League at a canter on Wednesday, thanks to a 3-0 win over Marseille, but silverware may not be enough to convince their two star players to stay. Antoine Griezmann, who scored twice in Lyon, looks particularly likely to move, with Barcelona expected to activate the striker's 100 million-euro buyout clause before the start of the World Cup. Jan Oblak has proven himself among, if not at the top of, the world's elite group of goalkeepers and Diego Simeone may face a fight to hold onto the Slovenian too. It is impossible to know whether had Barcelona been able to throw Messi on for the final 19 minutes against Levante last weekend, their unbeaten season would still be intact. Luis Suarez made it 5-4 in the 71st minute but Messi was not in the squad and Barca could not find an equaliser. Messi did play 16 minutes of Wednesday's friendly against Mamelodi Sundowns, a match commemorating 100 years since the birth of Nelson Mandela. Even with the World Cup approaching for the Argentinian, Barca's unbeaten season mattered. It was their chance to add some gloss to a campaign still soured by their Champions League exit to Roma. Without Messi, that chance was lost. Levante could be forgiven for not wanting the season to end. Paco Lopez took charge in March with the team in danger of relegation and has now overseen eight wins in 10 matches. If they follow up their stunning victory over Barca by beating Celta Vigo on Saturday, and other results go their way, Levante could still finish 11th. This summer promises to be a busy one but with Lopez committing himself to the club next season, better times should lie ahead. For Sevilla, a late surge under temporary boss Joaquin Caparros has secured Europa League qualification ahead of Saturday's game against Alaves but off the pitch, much is still to be decided including the positions of coach and sporting director.

18,13/05/2018,23:36,Barcelona's unbeaten season ended by five-star Levante,Philippe Coutinho hit a hat-trick but could not save Barcelona's unbeaten season as the Catalans were left stunned by an extraordinary 5-4 defeat to Levante on Sunday.,"Ernesto Valverde rested Lionel Messi for his team's penultimate match of the campaign but it was a defensive horror-show that allowed Emmanuel Boateng to score three times and Enis Bardhi twice at the City of Valencia Stadium. The La Liga and Copa del Rey champions trailed 5-1 after an hour and still came within a whisker of a sensational comeback as Coutinho's second and third goals, and a Luis Suarez penalty, set up a grandstand finish. But Levante held on for a thrilling victory, which ends their opponents' hopes of becoming the first ever club to finish a 38-game La Liga season as invincibles. After drawing at home to Real Madrid last weekend, despite playing the second half with 10 men, and thrashing Villarreal, Barcelona sat just two games away from the historical feat. It was 1932 when the last side, Real Madrid, went unbeaten in the top-flight but even that was across only 18 matches, in a 10-team division. This was Barcelona's first league loss since slipping up against Malaga on April 8 last year and while it has minimal impact on the table, Valverde will have questions to answer, not least with regards to leaving out Messi. ""We are angry not to have come through this game and not to have the opportunity to finish unbeaten,"" Valverde said. ""But in a season some matches go your way and some don't. I think this result was harsh in all respects but at other times this season, like in Seville, we could also have lost."" This defensive collapse was reminiscent of their Champions League meltdown against Roma, which has soured an otherwise successful campaign. The unbeaten record was supposed to help atone for the European failure. ""Obviously we wanted to finish the league undefeated,"" Sergio Busquets told beIN Sport. ""But this does not take away everything we have done otherwise this season - everything we have achieved in league, the run we managed across two seasons - but, it is a shame."" For Levante, this is their eighth win in 10 matches under new coach Paco Lopez, who took charge with the club in danger of relegation but has overseen a remarkable transformation. They move up to 15th. Paco's players exploded out of the blocks and pulled ahead in the ninth minute when Boateng nipped in at the near post after Jose Luis Morales' weaving run down the left. Bardhi hit the woodwork with a lifted finish over Marc-Andre ter Stegen but Barca failed to heed the warnings and Boateng made it two after half an hour, latching on to Sasa Lukic's threaded ball through. Coutinho pulled one back with a rasping shot before half-time but three Levante goals in 10 minutes after the interval sent the home fans into delirium. Bardhi's blistering shot restored the two-goal advantage before Boateng completed his hat-trick as Barca's defence was ripped apart again on the break. Another counter just before the hour ended with another crisp Bardhi finish, as Barca were now staring at a four-goal deficit. The game looked dead but Coutinho scored twice in six minutes, the first a close-range finish after Ousmane Dembele's shot spilled loose, the second an instinctive shot from the edge of the area. When Boateng brought down Busquets in the area and Suarez drove the penalty down the middle with 20 minutes left, it felt inevitable Barca would find a fifth. But without Messi even to bring on, Levante withstood the late onslaught and should even have scored a sixth only for Ruben Rochina to prode wide after a dreadful backpass by Busquets. It was the final mistake of an error-strewn display."
19,11/05/2018,01:36,Barca visit in-form Levante with unbeaten season on the line,Barcelona may have navigated their way past Real Madrid and Villarreal this week but their first ever unbeaten La Liga season is not quite over the line yet.,"Ernesto Valverde's side visit Levante on Sunday, whose lowly position of 16th betrays a late surge in form, which has included four consecutive victories and only one defeat in their last 10 games. Barca are clear favourites. They held on for a 2-2 draw at home to Real on Sunday, even after Sergi Roberto was sent off at the end of the first half, before thrashing sixth-placed Villarreal 5-1 on Wednesday. But if those two games have caused any fatigue, or even complacency, among Spain's league and cup winners, Levante could be primed to take advantage. When Paco Lopez replaced Juan Ramon Lopez Muniz as coach at the start of March, Levante had won only one of their last 22 games. Since he took charge, only Atletico Madrid have played them and tasted victory. ""It was important to change the dynamics but I don't know what changed so much,"" Lopez said. ""What we have is attitude and commitment and that has been the key."" Valverde has downplayed the importance of his team finishing the campaign as invincibles but after already winning a domestic double, it would represent something of a cherry on top. No team has ever finished a 38-game La Liga season without losing and Barca would be the first in any format since Real Madrid managed it across an 18-match schedule in 1932. With Real standing on the brink of a third consecutive Champions League triumph, their Catalan rivals need to claim every accolade they can get. ""In this club you are expected to win everything,"" Valverde said. ""We have not won everything but it is also true we had difficulties at the start of the season and we have exceeded many expectations. ""We had a terrible day in Rome in the Champions League and that has hung over us. But still, it has been a great season."" Zinedine Zidane has paid lip-service to the idea of a strong finish in the league, not least to maintain momentum ahead of their season-defining Champions League final against Liverpool in Kiev. But a heavily-rotated Real side's 3-2 defeat to Sevilla on Wednesday, when they trailed 3-0 in the 86th minute, offered a more accurate indication of the Frenchman's priorities. Real host Celta Vigo on Saturday, when it is almost certain that Cristiano Ronaldo, still recovering from a sprained ankle, will be absent. If Zidane recalls other key players it will be to prevent rust rather than to preserve hopes of beating Atletico Madrid to second. Vigo's own ambitions of sealing a place in the Europa League have extinguished but there remains a three-way battle for two spots between Villarreal, Sevilla and Getafe. Real Betis, in fifth, cannot drop out although they could still sink to seventh, which would involve playing an awkward qualification play-off in July. They host the current incumbents Sevilla on Saturday. Getafe, meanwhile, entertain Atletico while Villarreal visit already-relegated Deportivo La Coruna. Getafe may enjoy the benefits of an under-strength Atletico team, who play Marseille in the Europa League final on Wednesday. ""I have tunnel vision, like a horse,"" Atletico coach Diego Simeone said. ""I have Getafe and the final. I don't hear or see anything else."""
20,18/02/2018,22:52,"Real Madrid win eight-goal thriller, Atletico keep up Barca chase",Man of the moment Marco Asensio scored twice and Cristiano Ronaldo was also on target as Real Madrid kept up the feel-good factor with a thrilling 5-3 victory at Real Betis in La Liga on Sunday night.,"Madrid had been 2-1 down at half-time in a fantastic game at the Benito Villamarin, but they came roaring back in the second half with Sergio Ramos, Asensio -- who had scored the opener - Ronaldo and Karim Benzema all finding the net. They survived a late Betis onslaught, and after their 3-1 Champions League last 16, first-leg win against Paris Saint-Germain in midweek, this victory confirms that Zinedine Zidane's side are looking better in La Liga now too. They remain fourth, a huge 17 points behind leaders Barcelona. However, this was their fourth win in five league outings, and they are back to within a point of third-placed Valencia with a game in hand to come at Leganes in midweek. Asensio had come off the bench to set up the two late goals that allowed Real to beat PSG and he was rewarded with a start on Sunday in Seville, while Gareth Bale also came in as the likes of Benzema and Luka Modric dropped to the bench. Asensio duly headed Madrid into an 11th-minute lead after Antonio Adan had saved a Ronaldo shot, but Betis had won when the sides last met at the Santiago Bernabeu and they hit back brilliantly. Loren and Joaquin, the latter from a free-kick, both came close before Aissa Mandi headed in a Joaquin cross to make it 1-1 in the 33rd minute. It was 2-1 shortly after, as visiting defender Nacho could only help a Junior shot into his own net, and the home fans in the crowd of over 53,000 erupted. Real also saw Marcelo limp off in the first half -- a potentially worrying sign ahead of the PSG second leg -- but they recovered superbly after the restart. Ramos, whose Sevilla past always ensures a hot reception from the Betis fans, levelled with a bullet header from a Lucas Vazquez corner. Dani Carvajal then set up Asensio for his second and Real's third as the hour approached, and Ronaldo smashed in their fourth goal in the 65th minute. The Portuguese, supposedly in decline, has now scored 10 times in six games between league and Champions League. Betis may lack the consistency to properly contest a European place, but they do provide entertainment, and Cristian Tello set up fellow substitute Sergio Leon to make it 4-3 late on. Benzema, on from the bench, completed the scoring at the death with a goal that will boost his confidence. Earlier, Kevin Gameiro came off the bench in the second half to score one goal and make another for Diego Costa as second-placed Atletico Madrid beat Athletic Bilbao 2-0. It was another clinical performance from Diego Simeone's side, who have now recorded four consecutive league victories, all without conceding a goal. They remain second, seven points behind unbeaten leaders Barcelona, who won 2-0 at Eibar on Saturday ahead of their Champions League trip to Chelsea. ""We are not stopping, we are playing well at the moment, and we are enjoying ourselves,"" said Gameiro when asked about his team's pursuit of Barcelona. Atletico, who have conceded a paltry nine goals in 24 La Liga games this season, will hope to stay within striking distance of Barcelona before going to the Camp Nou in a fortnight. Villarreal are sixth after a 1-1 draw at Espanyol, while Real Sociedad beat Levante 3-0."
21,18/02/2018,18:24,"Gameiro, Costa on target as Atletico keep up Barcelona chase",Kevin Gameiro came off the bench to score one goal and make another for Diego Costa as Atletico Madrid beat Athletic Bilbao 2-0 in La Liga on Sunday.,"It was another clinical performance from Diego Simeone's side, who have now recorded four consecutive league victories, all without their mean defence conceding a goal. They remain second, seven points behind unbeaten league leaders Barcelona, who won 2-0 at Eibar on Saturday ahead of their Champions League last 16, first leg away to Chelsea. Former Chelsea striker Costa returned for Atletico at the Wanda Metropolitano after injury prevented him from taking part in their 4-1 Europa League win over FC Copenhagen in Denmark on Thursday. Atletico created little in the first half to get the crowd of just over 60,000 out of their seats. However, they livened up after the restart, and in particular after Gameiro was sent on for Koke just before the hour mark. It was Atletico's French connection that led to the opening goal midway through the second half, with Antoine Griezmann setting up Gameiro, who took a touch before firing low past Kepa Arrizabalaga and into the far corner for his fifth league goal of the season. Gameiro then turned provider with a fine through ball for Costa, who fired home to secure the points with 10 minutes remaining, the goal his second in La Liga since returning to Spain. ""We are not stopping, we are playing well at the moment, and we are enjoying ourselves,"" said Gameiro when asked about his team's pursuit of Barcelona at the top of the table. Atletico, who have conceded a paltry nine goals in 24 La Liga games this season, will hope to stay within striking distance of Barcelona before going to the Camp Nou in a fortnight. Simeone's side are also nine points clear of third-placed Valencia, who came from behind to win 2-1 at bottom club Malaga on Saturday. Real Madrid, in fourth, are at Betis on Sunday evening. Earlier on Sunday, Real Sociedad beat struggling Levante 3-0 at Anoeta."
22,03/02/2018,23:33,Pazzini late show sees Real Madrid held at Levante,"Former Italy striker Giampaolo Pazzini scored a dramatic late equaliser as Levante held Real Madrid to a 2-2 draw on Saturday, leaving Zinedine Zidane's men 18 points adrift of La Liga leaders Barcelona.","Sergio Ramos headed the visitors into an 11th-minute lead with his 50th La Liga goal for the club, but Levante equalised before half-time through Emmanuel Boateng. Isco came off the bench to put Real back in front late on, but Pazzini stunned the struggling defending champions with an 89th-minute strike on his debut. ""We controlled the game, especially in the first half, and in the second we managed to do the hard part -- get back into the game and score the second goal,"" said Zidane. ""Then we should have been ready, we could have avoided the second goal, but we didn't and it's hard because it's two dropped points."" The Champions League is Real's only realistic chance of more silverware this season, but they'll need to find a significant upturn in form to challenge Paris Saint-Germain in the last 16, first-leg tie in Madrid on February 14. ""We have to work even more, it's football and the opponent is there to try to put you in difficulty,"" Zidane added. Barcelona can move 21 points clear of their arch rivals with victory at Espanyol on Sunday, when second-placed Atletico Madrid welcome third-placed Valencia to the Wanda Metropolitano. Real didn't take long to forge ahead at Levante, as centre-back Ramos met a Toni Kroos corner with a downward header which home goalkeeper Oier fumbled into his net under pressure from Karim Benzema. They almost doubled their lead just after the half-hour mark as Oier managed to scramble the ball away from Cristiano Ronaldo after spilling Kroos' tame strike. But Levante hit back in the 42nd minute as 21-year-old Ghanaian Boateng marked his fourth league start for the team with his first La Liga goal. Jose Luis Morales ran through on goal as Ramos found himself caught out of position, and although Keylor Navas saved his effort, Boateng met the loose ball with a cool finish into the far corner. The away side continued to look frail at the back and were lucky not to fall behind as Morales led another rapid counter-attack from a Real corner which ended with Navas making a sprawling save to deny Jefferson Lerma. The reigning European champions improved after Isco replaced Gareth Bale midway through the second half, with the Spain midfielder shooting straight at Oier and Benzema having an effort deflected wide. Isco's introduction did pay off with only nine minutes remaining, as Benzema capitalised on some sloppy defending and pulled the ball back for the 25-year-old to smash home his fifth league goal of the season. Levante should have equalised in the 85th minute, but substitute Roger contrived to head wide with the goal gaping from only a couple of yards out. The home side did snatch a point, though, as Pazzini scored less than 11 minutes after coming off the bench to make his debut. The 33-year-old, who only joined on loan from Verona on Wednesday, easily got in behind the hapless Real defence and slotted into the far corner to pull Levante three points clear of the relegation zone. Sevilla's push for a top-four finish and a Champions League place took a massive dent earlier on Saturday, as they were thrashed 5-1 at Eibar. Chilean international Fabian Orellana scored twice as Eibar moved up to seventh, just one point and one place behind Sevilla. Fifth-placed Villarreal had Daniele Bonera sent off in the first half in a 2-1 defeat by Real Betis, as Betis forward Loren Moron scored twice on his debut after being promoted from the reserve team. Alaves pulled five points clear of the bottom three as former Barcelona man Munir El Haddadi scored what proved to be the winner in a 2-1 victory over Celta Vigo."

However, he found himself on the bench when coach Hannes Wolf chose new arrival Zieler, a 2014 World Cup winner with Germany who joined from Leicester City, for Stuttgart's first two Bundesliga games this season. The 29-year-old Langerak, who spent five years at Borussia Dortmund until joining Stuttgart in 2015, has signed for Levante until 2019 with the deal reported to cost one million euros ($1.2 million). ""Mitch earned his place as one of the cornerstones in our return to the Bundesliga,"" said Stuttgart director Michael Reschke. ""Understandably, he had a problem being comfortable with the role of number two."" Langerak has been replaced by Adam Federici in the Australia squad for the upcoming 2018 World Cup qualifiers against Japan and Thailand so he could complete the transfer. ""Mitch has some issues at club level that he needs to resolve,"" said Australia coach Ange Postecoglou. ""Speaking with Mitch, it was in our mutual interests that he focus on that at the moment rather than come into camp.""

24,02/05/2016,22:30,Levante relegated by Malaga defeat,Levante's six-year stay in the Spanish top flight came to an end as a 3-1 defeat to Malaga on Monday saw them relegated from La Liga.,"Defeat leaves Levante six points behind Rayo Vallecano, Sporting Gijon and Getafe with two games remaining. However, with Getafe and Sporting still to play each other on Sunday, their relegation to the Segunda Division is mathematically sealed. Levante could still have a huge part to play in who wins the title and who joins them in being relegated as they host Atletico Madrid on Sunday before travelling to Rayo on the final day of the season. Barcelona lead Atletico solely thanks to their superior head-to-head record at the top of the table with Real Madrid just a point behind in third. Jose Luis Morales's equaliser three minutes before half-time to cancel out Duje Cop's opener gave Levante hope. Morales then had another goal controversially ruled out for offside 15 minutes from time. Cop put Malaga back in front before Chory Castro's injury time strike sealed Levante's fate."

Victory revitalises Levante's chances of beating relegation as they remain bottom of the table but move to within three points of safety. Valencia's season now hinges upon overturning a 1-0 first-leg deficit at home to Athletic Bilbao in the Europa League on Thursday. Despite making five changes from the side that lost in the Basque country in awful weather conditions in midweek, Valencia looked weary from their European exploits as Levante should have had just their sixth win of the season sewn up before half-time. Rossi hit the post, whilst Diego Alves made fine saves from Deyverson and Zouhair Feddal. Sofiane Feghouli also had the visitors' two best chances before half-time, but was firstly denied by Diego Marino and then curled wide. The second-half was shorter on goalmouth action, but despite Neville's pre-match warning that they had to improve, Valencia were made to pay once more for poor defending at set-pieces as Rossi swivelled to volley a long-throw into the far corner 25 minutes from time. Neville also insisted before the game that he will fulfil his duties as an England coach during a 10-day international break later this month. That decision is likely to come under further scrutiny in the coming week with his future at the Mestalla far from secure."
26,07/02/2016,14:09,Barca equal unbeaten record with Levante win,Barcelona equalled a club record of 28 games unbeaten to move three points clear at the top of La Liga with a hard-fought 2-0 win at Levante on Sunday.,"The European champions were far from their best in coach Luis Enrique's 100th game in charge, but David Navarro's own goal and Luis Suarez's strike in stoppage time was enough to secure a 10th consecutive win in all competitions. Barca now lead Atletico Madrid by three points and have a game in hand on Diego Simeone's men. Third-placed Real Madrid are now seven points adrift of Barca, but can cut the gap when they travel to Granada later on Sunday. Fresh from hitting Gary Neville's Valencia for seven in the Copa del Rey in midweek, Barca started with purpose and should have been ahead inside two minutes when Lionel Messi was wrongly flagged offside as he slotted home from Andres Iniesta's pass. Neymar then had a fine curling effort beaten to safety by Diego Marino. However, Barca needed a slice of luck to open the scoring on 21 minutes as Jordi Alba burst down the left and his ball into the box was deflected into his own net by Navarro. Barca's star front three of Suarez, Messi and Neymar were kept for long periods, but they nearly combined for a brilliant second moments later when Messi picked out Neymar and his driven cross was turned just wide by Suarez. Levante remain rooted to the foot of the table, but had won their previous two home games and deserved to be at least level at the break as they outplayed the Catalans in the latter stages of the first-half. Verza fired a free-kick inches over before Jefferson Lerma had a great chance to level when he skewed horribly wide with just Claudio Bravo to beat. Jose Luis Morales came closest to equalising when his low effort came back off the post eight minutes before the break. Levante continued to enjoy the better of the game in the second period, but found clear-cut chances hard to come by as former Manchester United forward Giuseppe Rossi's shot from outside the box was the only time Bravo was forced into action. Barca had barely threatened themselves after half-time, but did seal the points deep into stoppage time on the counter-attack as Messi picked out an unmarked Suarez to fire home his 35th goal of the season."
27,26/10/2015,10:43,Levante fire coach Alcaraz,Spanish top-flight strugglers Levante have sacked coach Lucas Alcaraz in the wake of their comprehensive 4-0 home defeat to Real Sociedad on Sunday.,"Levante released a statement late on Sunday night to say Alcaraz had been fired along with his coaching staff following an extraordinary board meeting at the club's Ciutat de Valencia stadium. The 49-year-old former Granada coach had been appointed in October last year and kept Levante up last season, but leaves with the Valencia-based side bottom of La Liga with only six points, having won just once in nine games this season."
28,11/09/2015,22:44,Winless Sevilla held at Levante,Europa League holders Sevilla are still looking for their first win of the season after they were held 1-1 at Levante on Friday.,"Former Stoke City midfielder Steven N'Zonzi gave the visitors a deserved lead when he curled home his first goal for the Andalusians after just 12 minutes. However, Sevilla failed to turn their dominance into a more commanding lead in the first-half and were made to pay after the break. Victor Camarasa levelled from close range just before the hour mark after Sevilla 'keeper Beto had made a fine initial save from Nabil Ghilas. Both sides now have just two points from their opening three La Liga fixtures. Champions Barcelona are in action on Saturday when they face a daunting trip to face Atletico Madrid. Real Madrid also play on Saturday away at Espanyol."
29,15/02/2015,19:48,Messi hat-trick hands Barca 11th straight win,Lionel Messi marked his 300th La Liga appearance with his 31st Barcelona hat-trick as the Catalans moved within a point of Real Madrid at the top of the table with a 5-0 win over Levante.,"Barca have now won 11 straight matches in all competitions and never looked in danger despite coach Luis Enrique making eight changes from the side that beat Villarreal in the Copa del Rey in midweek. Messi teed up Neymar to open the scoring early on and then took over scoring duties himself to take his all-time La Liga tally to 269 goals. However, even the Argentine was upstaged by a stunning overhead kick from substitute Luis Suarez to round off the scoring. Victory tied Pep Guardiola's best ever run of consecutive wins during his hugely successful four-year spell in charge at the Camp Nou. But Enrique insisted it is winning at the season's end which matters most. ""Records are obviously positive, but they don't interest me,"" he said. ""The players aren't overly euphoric because they know how hard it is to win titles. ""If the fans are euphoric then great. We need to be optimistic, but it isn't important how many games we have won. What counts is if they help us to win trophies."" Messi, Neymar and Javier Mascherano were the only survivors from Wednesday's 3-1 Cup semi-final, first leg win over Villarreal as Enrique continued to use the vast resources of his squad. Those changes did understandably provoke a subdued start, but Barca's luck was in on 17 minutes when Neymar mishit Messi's dinked pass over the Levante defence only for the ball to spin high into the air and drop into the far corner of the net. The two South American stars combined once more 20 minutes later only for Messi to be wrongly flagged offside when he seemed set to double the hosts advantage. Messi didn't have to wait long for his first goal, though, as Marc Bartra robbed the ball deep inside the Levante half and fed his teammate to slot home his 35th goal of the season. The four-time World Player of the Year should have added to his tally before the break when he fired over from inside the area after Diego Marino had made a fine block from Pedro Rodriguez's original effort. Messi did add his second of the afternoon just before the hour mark as Sergio Busquets's lovely pass into Pedro was turned across goal by the Spanish international and Messi tapped home with his right foot. Neymar was then upended inside the area by Ivan Lopez and, having handed penalty taking duties to the Brazilian when Neymar missed from the spot in midweek, Messi wasn't to give up the opportunity for his fifth hat-trick of the season as he sent Marino the wrong way. Suarez was introduced at Neymar's expense shortly afterwards and the former Liverpool man provided his own moment of brilliance as he caught Adriano's cross flush on the volley for just his fourth La Liga goal 17 minutes from time. Earlier, Valencia needed an Alvaro Negredo penalty 19 minutes from time to see off Getafe 1-0 and move back up to fourth in La Liga. The on-loan Manchester City striker cheekily chipped home the winner from the spot after he had been brought down by Juan Rodriguez inside the area."
30,29/01/2015,12:18,Levante snap up Nigerian Uche,La Liga strugglers Levante have signed former Nigerian international forward Kalu Uche on a free transfer.,"The 32-year-old arrives back in Spain, where he previously enjoyed spells with Almeria and Espanyol, from Qatari club Al Rayyan. Levante currently sit in the relegation zone in the Spanish top flight having scored just 13 goals in 20 games."
31,03/01/2015,17:58,Griezmann double keeps Atletico on Real's shoulders,La Liga champions Atletico Madrid remained in the race to retain their title with a comfortable 3-1 win over Levante on Saturday thanks to two goals from Antoine Griezmann.,"With Fernando Torres watching on from the stands before his move back to his boyhood club is concluded on Monday, Griezmann was under pressure to continue his fine form after scoring a hat-trick as Atletico closed 2014 with a 4-1 win away to Athletic Bilbao two weeks ago. And he duly obliged with two headed finishes from close range early in each half before Diego Godin nodded in Atletico's third after Nabil El Zhar's deflected effort had given Levante hope. Atletico are now level with Barcelona in second place and one point behind leaders Real Madrid, with the latter two sides in action against Real Sociedad and Valencia respectively on Sunday. Torres was the star attraction before kick-off as he took his seat in the directors' box to much acclaim. However, on the field, Griezmann ensured Los Rojiblancos' former captain will find it hard to get into the side for the visit of Real Madrid in the Copa del Rey on Wednesday. The French international had a goalbound shot blocked by Loukas Vyntra and Mario Mandzukic headed just wide as the hosts began brightly. Diego Simeone's men were finally rewarded on 18 minutes when Guilherme Siqueira's cross from the left looped into Griezmann's path and he nodded past the helpless Diego Marino. Atletico should have extended their lead before half-time as Arda Turan fired just over, Mandzukic saw a goal ruled out for handball and Marino then made a fine save to deny the Croatian from point-blank range. Yet, they looked to have made the game safe just 60 seconds into the second period as despite more heroics from Marino to claw a Mandzukic header off the line, he couldn't react in time to prevent Griezmann's follow-up effort crossing the line. The unlucky Mandzukic saw another header drift wide and Tiago's deflected shot flew into the side-netting as Atletico continued to dominate. However, they were stunned just after the hour mark when Levante halved the deficit. Mandzukic was again heavily involved again as he did brilliantly to turn Victor Casadesus's header off his own line, but the ball fell to Ivan Lopez and his drive clipped El Zhar on its way into the far corner. Simeone then withdrew Turan and Mandzukic with one eye to Wednesday's repeat of last seasons' Champions League final against Real. And, not for the first time this season, the Argentine's side needed to rely on their threat from set-pieces to seal the three points eight minutes from time when Godin headed home Tiago's in-swinging cross."
32,18/10/2014,17:59,Ronaldo double propels Madrid to another five-goal rout,Real Madrid ensured they will head into a big week full of confidence with a 5-0 thrashing of Levante ahead of their meetings with Liverpool and Barcelona.,"Cristiano Ronaldo stretched his fine scoring streak at club level to nine games as he opened the scoring from the penalty spot before Javier Hernandez headed home to double Madrid's lead before half-time. Ronaldo powered home his 15th league goal in just seven appearances this season to make it 3-0 before sweet finishes from James Rodriguez and Isco rounded of a seventh consecutive win for the European champions. Madrid now lie just a point adrift of leaders Barcelona, but the Catalans can restore their four-point advantage with a win over Eibar later on Saturday. Real boss Carlo Ancelotti was missing a host of first team regulars as Karim Benzema and Raphael Varane missed out due to a fever, Sergio Ramos was sidelined by a calf injury and Gareth Bale handed a rare rest after his exertions with Wales in the past week. However, the visitors could still have put the game to bed inside the first 15 minutes as Ronaldo was uncharacteristically wasteful in front of goal. The Portuguese captain sliced wide with just Diego Marino to beat after a wonderful through ball from Luka Modric and then pulled another shot wide from the edge of the box moments later. Ronaldo, though, wasn't to be denied on 12 minutes as Hernandez was tripped inside the area by Juanfran and the World Player of the Year slammed home the resulting penalty. Levante reacted well to going behind and came close to an equaliser twice in a matter of seconds midway through the first-half as Marcelo diverted Pape Diop's effort inches past his own goal. And from the corner Modric had to make a fine clearance off the line to prevent Victor Camarasa punishing Madrid's slack marking. Madrid made sure of the three points seven minutes before half-time as Rodriguez's in-swinging cross was turned home from close range by Hernandez to register his third goal for the club. Ancelotti's men stapped up a gear after the break and put the seal on another comfortable victory with three goals of pure quality. Ronaldo doubled his tally for the afternoon as he latched onto Isco's through ball and cut inside two Levante defenders before firing past Marino. Rodriguez then produced a stunning piece of control as he took Toni Kroos's lofted pass on his chest before volleying home on his favoured left foot to make it four. Madrid should have had a fifth 15 minutes from time as Modric somehow side-footed wide with the goal at his mercy after Marino had done well to parry his initial effort. And the only negative note from a fine afternoon for Ancelotti was an injury suffered by the Croatian midfielder as he limped off to be replaced by debutant Alvaro Medran 10 minutes from time. There was still one moment of brilliance to come from the visitors as Isco again broke through midfield and this time went alone to drill the ball into the top corner for his first goal of the season."
33,21/09/2014,22:55,"Messi, Neymar on target as Barca thrash Levante",Barcelona overcame a missed penalty from Lionel Messi to return to the top of La Liga with a 5-0 win away to 10-man Levante on Sunday.,"Neymar opened the scoring with a simple finish from Messi's through ball before the Argentine star missed from the spot for the 12th time in his career after Loukas Vyntra had seen red for tripping him inside the area. However, it mattered little as Ivan Rakitic's fierce strike made it 2-0 before half-time and goals from Sandro Ramirez, Pedro Rodriguez and Messi rounded off the scoring after the break to make it four wins in four La Liga games without conceding a goal for Barca. Luis Enrique recalled many of his rested stars for Wednesday's 1-0 win over APOEL Nicosia in the Champions League as he made eight changes in all with only Messi, Neymar and Dani Alves retaining their places in the side. However, only a last-ditch challenge from Rakitic prevented Victor Casadesus turning home Jose Luis Morales's cross at the far post to give the side rooted to the foot of the table a shock lead after 15 minutes. Barca then slowly began to take charge and after Jordi Alba fired wastefully off target, Neymar was denied at the end of a flowing move by a brave block from Jesus Fernandez. The Brazilian got the better of Fernandez just after the half hour mark, though, as he latched onto Messi's ball over the top and rounded the 'keeper before slotting home his third goal of the season. Barca looked to have the game sealed when Messi was then tripped inside the area and Greek defender Vyntra harshly sent-off for denying a clear goalscoring opportunity. Messi picked himself up to take the resulting spot-kick, but blasted his effort high and wide of the target. The Argentine's blushes were spared as Rakitic rifled in his first goal for the club from outside the box shortly afterwards to ensure the visitors led 2-0 at the break. There was a brief scare for Barca when Neymar went down with an ankle injury at the start of the second period, but his protestations at being replaced by Sandro suggest the injury shouldn't keep him out of Wednesday's trip to Malaga. Sandro then got himself on the scoresheet as he became the latest recipient of a Messi assist with a low right-footed finish. Pedro registered his first goal of the season to make it 4-0 26 minutes from time as he rolled the ball into an empty net after a lovely one-two between Alba and Sandro. And Messi finally got his reward for another fine performance when he pounced on a poor clearance from Fernandez and lobbed the ball over the 'keeper for his third goal of the campaign. Earlier, Sevilla had briefly moved top with a 3-1 win at Cordoba thanks to two goals from Colombian international Carlos Bacca. Villarreal moved into the top six as they came from 2-0 down to beat Rayo Vallecano 4-2 at home, but Real Sociedad failed to move into the top half of the table as they were shocked 2-1 at home by Almeria."

35,05/08/2014,15:47,Navas up for challenge after Madrid move,Costa Rica goalkeeper Keylor Navas on Tuesday said he was ready for the challenge of beating off the competition for places at Real Madrid after completing his move to the Santiago Bernabeu.,"""I know I will have to work extremely hard. Madrid have the best players in the world in every position, they have two excellent goalkeepers,"" said Navas as he was unveiled to fans and the media at the home of the European champions. Navas is tipped to get the nod ahead of club legend Iker Casillas to start in goal for Carlo Ancelotti's side, while Diego Lopez looks likely to be forced out. ""Only God knows what will happen. It is up to me to train hard every day so that I am ready if my opportunity comes around,"" said Navas. ""I have always looked up to Casillas and Diego Lopez, who have shown themselves to be the best in the world over many years. ""It will be a learning curve for me every day. They are a reference for me in my career."" Last season, Lopez was Ancelotti's first choice in goal in La Liga but captain Casillas was used in the triumphant Copa del Rey and Champions League campaigns. Navas, 27, arrives in the Spanish capital from Levante on a six-year deal after Real reportedly paid the 10 million-euro ($13.4m, £8m) release clause in his contract with the Valencia-based side. He rose to international prominence with his performances at the World Cup, when he starred during unfancied Costa Rica's run to the quarter-finals, where they only succumbed on penalties to the Netherlands. ""The World Cup was wonderful for me. Playing against the best teams makes one improve,"" said Navas, who was warmly welcomed by Madrid president Florentino Perez. ""You will have the pride and the honour of being the first man from your country to play for this club,"" Perez told his new recruit, who was named as the winner of the Golden Glove by FIFA as the best goalkeeper of the recent tournament in Brazil. ""His performances were key in helping Costa Rica reach the quarter-finals for the first time in their history."" Navas is Madrid's third summer signing, following the arrivals of Germany's Toni Kroos from Bayern Munich for a reported 30 million euros and Colombia's James Rodriguez from Monaco for around 80 million euros."
