0,13/02/2021,17:38,Haaland spares Dortmund blushes,A late equaliser from Erling Braut Haaland spared Borussia Dortmund's blushes on Saturday as they drew 2-2 at home against Bundesliga rivals Hoffenheim.,"Haaland's 81st minute strike averted a fourth defeat in five Bundesliga games for crisis-hit Dortmund. Yet even a draw leaves Dortmund three points adrift of the Champions League places in sixth, and heaps more pressure on interim coach Edin Terzic. Dortmund have won just four of ten league games since Terzic took the reins from Lucien Favre in December, prompting growing speculation over his future. Yet veteran defender Mats Hummels defended his coach on Saturday and backed Dortmund to revive their season. ""It's never the case that things are exactly how you want them a few weeks after a new coach takes over. That wasn't the case years ago under Jurgen Klopp, and it isn't the case now under Edin,"" Hummels told Sky. ""We're working hard, and success will come,"" he added. England international Jadon Sancho gave Dortmund a perfect start, racing up the left-wing to score his fourth league goal this season on 24 minutes. The lead didn't last long, as Munas Dabbur scuffed a shot past Marwin Hitz to level just seven minutes later. Ihlas Bebou bundled in Hoffenheim's second just after half-time, the ball bouncing off the Togolese and into the goal as Hitz tried to beat away a dangerous cross from the left wing. Haaland had a goal ruled out for offside in the second half before pouncing on a misplaced pass to snatch a crucial late equaliser. Fellow Champions League hopefuls Bayer Leverkusen also dropped points after they conceded two late goals to draw 2-2 with strugglers Mainz. Lucas Alario tapped in a low Moussa Diaby cross to give Leverkusen the lead on 14 minutes. Patrik Schick appeared to have sealed three points with a second on 84 minutes. Yet second-from-bottom Mainz were rewarded for a brave performance as late goals by Robert Glatzel and Kevin Stoeger saved a point and continued their recent revival under new coach Bo Svensson. Elsewhere, Werder Bremen were held to a 0-0 draw at home to Freiburg while Sami Khedira helped rescue a 1-1 draw for Hertha Berlin against boyhood club Stuttgart. ""It was the first time I'd ever played against Stuttgart so it was strange, but it was nice to come back,"" Khedira, who joined Hertha from Juventus in January after a decade abroad, told Sky. Austrian striker Sasa Kalajdzic headed in his ninth goal of the season to give Stuttgart the lead at the end of a scrappy first half. Veteran midfielder Khedira came off the bench in the second-half and set up a late equaliser for 17-year-old Luca Netz to save the capital club from a fifth straight defeat."
1,02/02/2021,13:31,Who is new Liverpool signing Ozan Kabak?,"Hailed as one of Europe's most exciting defensive talents, Turkish centre-back Ozan Kabak is now hoping to live up to the hype after joining Liverpool on loan.","The 20-year-old defender landed on Merseyside on Monday, just before the transfer deadline, after agreeing a six-month loan deal from German Bundesliga strugglers Schalke 04. So who is the Turkish prodigy, and is he cut out for life in the Premier League? Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp hailed Kabak as a ""proper personality"" and a ""really, really big talent"" after signing the 20-year-old. That may seem like high praise for a player who has spent the last couple of years fighting relegation in the Bundesliga at Schalke and VfB Stuttgart, but Kabak comes with a glowing reference from Klopp's close friend, and former Schalke coach, David Wagner. ""David always said he would be a future captain,"" Klopp told the Liverpool club website. Though a centre-back by trade, Kabak's pace and his aerial ability make him a threat going forward. He scored three times in his first 10 games after joining Stuttgart as a teenager in January 2019, and found the net in successive games for Schalke last November. Relegated with Stuttgart in 2019 and now bottom of the league with crisis-hit Schalke, Kabak's talent has often been overshadowed by his team's poor form. Yet he was a key player in Schalke's excellent start to the 2019/20 season, helping Wagner's side rise to third place before their dramatic collapse. ""He is not only a great talent, he is also a very intelligent guy -- a young man who knows exactly what he wants,"" Wagner told broadcaster Sport1 in 2019. Kabak, who made his full international debut as a 19-year-old, is certainly a player with plenty of ambition, as he revealed in an interview with the Bundesliga website last year. ""My personal aim is to become a top defender in maybe two or three years, like Virgil van Dijk. He is my idol,"" said the Turkish defender. With Van Dijk now injured, the 20-year-old now has the chance to understudy his idol at Liverpool. For the seven-times capped Turkey international, it was also an opportunity to free himself from the shackles of Schalke and prove himself among the elite. ""When Ozan heard the name Liverpool, he didn't hesitate. When you have a chance like that, then you don't have to think about it,"" admitted Schalke coach Christian Gross on Tuesday."
2,24/01/2021,17:32,Bayern Munich seven points clear after thrashing Schalke,Bayern Munich opened up a seven-point lead at the top of the Bundesliga with a 4-0 win at bottom side Schalke 04 on Sunday as Robert Lewandowski scored for the eighth straight league game.,"Thomas Mueller headed Bayern into a first-half lead, before Lewandowski beat two Schalke defenders and netted from a tight angle midway through the second half for his 23rd goal in 17 Bundesliga matches this season. Bayern scored twice in the final two minutes, with a second Mueller header before David Alaba smashed in a long-range shot in the 90th minute."
3,22/01/2021,18:17,Bayern's Flick dismisses memories of 8-0 romp before Schalke rematch,Bayern Munich coach Hansi Flick said on Friday their record thrashing of Schalke last September will play no role when the Bundesliga leaders travel to the league's bottom club this weekend.,"Bayern's 8-0 hammering of Schalke in Munich four months ago was the highest score for the opening game of a German top-flight season. The clubs meet again this weekend in Gelsenkirchen with Schalke 10 points from safety while Bayern are four points clear at the top but Flick dismissed reminders of the crushing win ahead of Sunday's match. ""That is zero percent in our thoughts,"" Flick said. ""Schalke have a team with good individual players and their place in the table doesn't reflect their quality."" Yet Schalke have endured a miserable season. A fortnight ago, they were just one short of the league record of 31 games without a victory before US teenager Matthew Hoppe scored a hat-trick in a 4-0 win over Hoffenheim. Hoppe has also scored in both of Schalke's defeats since. The Royal Blues have added to their attack with 37-year-old Dutch veteran Klaas-Jan Huntelaar, who has returned from Ajax, set to feature at the Veltins Arena. Flick said Bayern will be without midfielder Corentin Tolisso, who suffered a leg knock in Wednesday's 1-0 win over Augsburg. Bayern rode their luck in the midweek Bavarian derby as Iceland striker Alfred Finnbogason hit the post when Augsburg were awarded a late penalty. Flick said Bayern showed the ""character and the mentality"" to hold out for the win, but the European champions have looked jaded in recent weeks. ""We still have 13 games until the international break, there's still a long way to go, so we have to manage the load properly,"" Flick added."

Zinedine Zidane's side are playing catch up to Atletico Madrid, despite having played a game more, after draws against struggling Elche and Osasuna, two of the league's bottom three, in recent weeks. Alaves beat Madrid 2-1 in the capital in late November but have won just once in eight matches since, their slide into a relegation scrap costing coach Pablo Machin his job last week with former Spain international Abelardo Fernandez returning to take charge. AC Milan v Atalanta, Saturday 1700 GMT Zlatan Ibrahimovic wasted little time shaking off any rust accrued while sidelined by a muscle injury as he scored twice against Cagliari on Monday, in his first Serie A start in two months. The 39-year-old Swede has scored 12 goals in just seven starts this season, second only to Cristiano Ronaldo in the league, and Milan this week strengthened their attack with the signing of ex-Juventus striker Mario Mandzukic on a free transfer. ""Zlatan and I have a lot of experience. In football, it's important to instill fear in your opponents, to fight and to protect your team,"" said Mandzukic, who could make his debut against an Atalanta side that arrives in Milan unbeaten in nine league outings. Monaco v Marseille, Saturday 2000 GMT Marseille are reeling after two straight defeats followed a draw at lowly Dijon, a run that has shattered any fanciful Ligue 1 title dreams and cast considerable doubt over the future of coach Andre Villas-Boas. ""I am at the service of the board. I am not here to cause problems. If they decide that I am not up to it in terms of results, then it will be the time to leave. If a change is needed, I am at their service,"" Villas-Boas said following Wednesday's 1-0 home loss to Lens. Club president Jacques-Henri Eyraud blasted the players as ""not fit to wear the shirt"" in the wake of last weekend's defeat by bottom side Nimes. A trip to Niko Kovac's in-form Monaco could spell further trouble at the Velodrome. Schalke v Bayern Munich, Sunday 1430 GMT With their 30-match winless run finally over, Schalke will want no reminding of what happened when they met Bayern Munich on the opening day of the season -- a crushing 8-0 defeat setting the tone for a disastrous first half of the campaign. In 19-year-old US forward Matthew Hoppe, Schalke have found a ray of hope in their fight against relegation, but the Royal Blues are eight points from potential safety at the halfway stage. Bayern have clawed out tough wins over Freiburg and Augsburg in their two previous games to regain control atop the Bundesliga, sending a ""signal to the rest of the chasing pack"" their hunger remains strong despite a recent dip, says Manuel Neuer. Sporting v Braga, Saturday 1945 GMT Having sparred with their rivals off the pitch over the handling of Covid-19 cases, Sporting Lisbon got the better of Porto in Tuesday's semi-final thanks to two late goals from Cape Verde-born Jovane Cabral. A day later, Braga overcame their ""outrage"" at Benfica's efforts to seek a postponement of their tie, booking a place in the final in Leiria with a 2-1 victory over an opposing side hit by a raft of coronavirus infections. Sporting and Braga have combined to win each of the past three editions of the Portuguese League Cup, the former lifting the trophy in 2018 and 2019 before Braga defeated Porto in last year's final under current Sporting boss Ruben Amorim."
5,22/01/2021,03:05,Nagelsmann promises Leipzig will 'attack' Bayern in title chase,Julian Nagelsmann says his RB Leipzig team are ready to push Bundesliga leaders Bayern Munich all the way this season as they prepare for Saturday's trip to lowly Mainz.,"""We're still within striking distance (of Bayern) and want to keep attacking,"" said Leipzig coach Nagelsmann. Mainz are second-from-bottom and winless in their last nine games but gave Bayern a huge scare three weeks ago, taking a two-goal lead before losing 5-2 at Munich's Allianz Arena. However, Nagelsmann says his team were ""incredibly mature"" on Wednesday against the stubborn defence of Union Berlin, which eventually cracked in Leipzig's 1-0 home win. Ten minutes into his cameo appearance on Wednesday, Emil Forsberg combined with Dani Olmo to unpick the Union defence with great footwork. Nagelsmann dubbed the pair ""phonebox kickers"" for the close-quarters skills which led to Forsberg's winning goal, and the Swede could feature at the weekend. Bayern meanwhile are at bottom side Schalke on Sunday with goalkeeper Manuel Neuer chasing a league record at his former club. On Wednesday, Neuer equalled Oliver Kahn's record of 196 Bundesliga clean sheets. But Bayern have looked vulnerable in recent weeks. They have won their last two league games, but were lucky to get a 1-0 victory at Augsburg on Wednesday after Alfred Finnbogason hit the post with a late penalty. ""We had to fight tooth and nail at the back,"" admitted Neuer after his first clean sheet in the league since October. Coach Hansi Flick admitted that ""it's been a long time"" since his side has dominated matches as much as last season, when Bayern won the treble of Champions League, Bundesliga and German Cup titles. At the halfway stage of the campaign, Schalke are level on seven points with Mainz, 10 away from the guaranteed safety of 15th place. American striker Matthew Hoppe, 19, will try to test Neuer after grabbing headlines by scoring five goals in his last three games. The Royal Blues have beefed up their attack by bringing back Klaas-Jan Huntelaar. The Dutch veteran, 37, who netted 126 goals for Schalke from 2010 until joining Ajax in 2017, hopes to shake off a calf strain to face Bayern on Sunday. Leverkusen's French winger scored arguably the goal of the midweek round of matches in Tuesday's 2-1 win over Dortmund with a superb finish after Leon Bailey's diagonal pass. Great work by Diaby, 21, then put Florian Wirtz into space to score the winning goal to end Leverkusen's winless run of four league games. 22: Goals Bayern striker Robert Lewandowski has scored in 17 league games this season. At the same point of the 1972/72 season, in which Gerd Mueller set the all-time record of 40 goals, 'The Bomber' had scored 17 times. 422: Matches Bayern goalkeeper Manuel Neuer needed to equal the league record of 196 clean sheets, set by ex-Germany keeper Oliver Kahn, who took 557 games. 4 - At 17 years, 261 days old, Leverkusen midfielder Wirtz, who is still at school, is the youngest player to score four Bundesliga goals, beating the previous records of Kai Havertz and Timo Werner, who are now both at Chelsea.

6,20/01/2021,21:07,Schalke lose to Cologne,"Schalke remained rooted to the foot of the Bundesliga table after slipping to a 2-1 home loss to fellow strugglers Cologne on Wednesday, despite a fifth goal in three games for American teenager Matthew Hoppe.","Cologne defender Rafael Czichos gave the visitors a first-half lead, but Hoppe equalised before the hour mark. Cologne snatched a late win when Jan Thielmann fired past Schalke goalkeeper Ralf Faehrmann in injury time. The win lifted Cologne out of the relegation play-off place to 15th, while Schalke remain behind second-bottom Mainz on goal difference. Hoppe became the first American to score a Bundesliga hat-trick in the 4-0 thrashing of Hoffenheim 10 days ago which ended Schalke's 30-match winless run in the league, before also netting in Sunday's 3-1 defeat at Eintracht Frankfurt. Schalke next host league leaders Bayern Munich on Sunday having been thrashed 8-0 by the European champions at the Allianz Arena on the opening day of the season. The Royal Blues' new signing Klaas-Jan Huntelaar missed Wednesday's game with a calf strain after rejoining on Tuesday following two years with Ajax. Cologne ended a miserable five-match goalless run in the league when Czichos headed home a deflected cross with half an hour played. Cologne nearly went 2-0 up just after the break when Schalke midfielder Benjamin Stambouli clipped his own post with an attempted clearance. The hosts drew level when Hoppe pounced on a loose ball in the area, before Thielmann's late winner."
7,17/01/2021,20:25,'Like a Hollywood film': Jovic nets twice for Frankfurt on return from Real Madrid,Real Madrid loanee Luka Jovic came off the bench to score twice in his first game back at Eintracht Frankfurt on Sunday to seal their 3-1 win over bottom side Schalke in the Bundesliga.,"""It's like a script from a Hollywood film. The air in Frankfurt clearly does him good,"" said Frankfurt director Fredi Bobic. ""We decided before the game that he would get 30 minutes today."" The 23-year-old Serbia striker, who joined Real in June 2019 in a transfer worth around 60 million euros ($72 million), has been loaned back to Frankfurt for the rest of the season. Despite netting just twice in 32 appearances for Real, Jovic came on for the final half an hour in Frankfurt and needed just ten minutes for his first goal. It was his first game for two months after contracting Covid-19 in November, then picking up an injury, but he struck again just before the final whistle in Frankfurt. Portugal striker Andre Silva gave Frankfurt the lead before US teenager Matthew Hoppe, who last weekend became the first American to score a Bundesliga hat-trick, equalised for Schalke. However, the Royal Blues are again last in the table because of Mainz's 1-1 draw at Dortmund on Saturday."
8,11/01/2021,13:30,Who is Matthew Hoppe? Meet the new Bundesliga star and Schalke hero,Matthew Hoppe earned instant hero status at Schalke with his hat-trick in the 4-0 win over Hoffenheim on Saturday that saved his club from matching the Bundesliga record for the most consecutive games without a win. So who exactly is this latest young American to break through in Germany?,"At Schalke the 19-year-old is following in the footsteps of Texas-born Weston McKennie, who left the Gelsenkirchen club to join Juventus on loan at the start of this season. There was also Christian Pulisic at Borussia Dortmund before he signed for Chelsea, while Hoppe's peers this season include Gio Reyna at Dortmund, Josh Sargent at Werder Bremen, RB Leipzig's Tyler Adams and Chris Richards at Bayern Munich. And then there is Pellegrino Matarazzo, the New Jersey-born coach of VfB Stuttgart. The Bundesliga has been good to American players in recent years and they have been good for Germany's top flight, helping raise its profile across the Atlantic. Hoppe, though, will settle for being revered in the blue half of the Ruhr region. Hoppe is from southern California and joined Schalke in 2019 after playing for the Barcelona Residency Academy USA in Arizona. He scored 29 goals in 23 games in 2018/19 while playing for Barca's USA academy and committed to San Diego State University before being offered a trial with Schalke. After moving to Germany, he did enough to impress in Schalke's reserves last season despite scoring a single goal in 16 games. The first team's dire form and lack of goals created a chance this season for Hoppe as Schalke's other strikers fell by the wayside. Vedad Ibisevic was sacked in November, Goncalo Paciencia picked up a knee injury and Wales forward Rabbi Matondo struggled before being loaned to English second-tier side Stoke City last week. Promoted to the first team in late November, Hoppe started on his Bundesliga debut, a 4-1 defeat at Borussia Moenchengladbach. Christian Gross, Schalke's fourth coach this season, arrived in late December and has clearly spotted Hoppe's talent. The former Tottenham manager selected him for his first two games, including Saturday's thrashing as Schalke ended an astonishing run of 30 games without a win, one shy of the all-time Bundesliga record of 31 set by Tasmania Berlin in the 1960s. ""I have no words,"" Hoppe said after becoming the first American to score a Bundesliga hat-trick on what was just his fifth appearance in the league. ""The first goal was the easiest as it was pure instinct,"" he said of his deft chip which put Schalke on the path to a first league win since January last year. ""I hope the team can keep fighting, stay confident and stay in the league."" Hoppe needed just 21 minutes for his three goals to become the third-youngest player to score a Bundesliga hat-trick. Ironically, Schalke are in their 30th straight season in the Bundesliga. One of Germany's best-supported teams, Hoppe's goals helped lift them off the bottom of the table, although they remain in the relegation zone, six points from outright safety after 15 games. ""He will always remember this day in his career,"" Gross said of Hoppe. The veteran coach described a player who ""doesn't shy away from working extremely hard"" in training and is ""unbelievably ambitious, has tremendous commitment and only thinks about Schalke. ""He wants to do whatever it takes to get us out of this situation. He's still very young and still has lots to learn in order to become a top-rate finisher, but we're working on that."" His hat-trick instantly made Hoppe Schalke's top scorer this season. Bayern are due in Gelsenkirchen in a fortnight, but Hoppe is not assured of his place with the Royal Blues still on the lookout for another striker. ""Nothing has changed. We're working hard to strengthen the squad - especially up front,"" Gross said."
9,11/01/2021,12:35,"Messi on form, a new American star and Bayern beaten: Talking points from around Europe","Lionel Messi is bang in form in the new year, Schalke avoided matching the Bundesliga record for the most consecutive games without a win and there was a very rare defeat for Bayern Munich.","AFP Sport rounds up some of the main talking points from across the continent: Lionel Messi looks like a man on a mission at the start of 2021 and what could be his final six months as a Barcelona player. On Saturday he scored twice -- including direct from a free-kick, one of his late-career specialities -- in a 4-0 win at Granada. That followed a masterful double and two shots off the post in a 3-2 midweek victory at Athletic Bilbao. Before that he provided the assist for Frenkie de Jong's winner at Huesca, and Barcelona have won three out of three since the turn of the year, while Messi is now La Liga's top scorer. Maybe it's not too late for Ronald Koeman's side to challenge for the title: they are third, four points behind leaders Atletico Madrid, albeit having played three games more. Matthew Hoppe is the latest young American to break through in the Bundesliga and he is already a hero for Schalke supporters. The California-born 19-year-old, who made his debut in November, had never scored a senior goal before netting a hat-trick -- the first ever for an American in the Bundesliga -- in the 4-0 defeat of Hoffenheim that rescued the Royal Blues from equalling an unwanted record. Their first win since January 17 last year, after 30 games without, prevented them from matching Tasmania Berlin's infamous German top-flight record of 31 games without a victory set in 1965/66. Hoppe has given hope to a whole club, and suddenly Schalke have new cause for optimism as they bid to beat the drop. They are off the bottom, above Mainz, but they remain in the relegation zone. Bayern Munich had begun to look a little less irresistible on a run of eight straight Bundesliga matches in which they had conceded the opening goal. But they had won five and drawn three of those matches. Then on Friday they were 2-0 up away to Borussia Moenchengladbach only to lose 3-2, just their second Bundesliga defeat since losing at the same ground in December 2019. It is a result that keeps the Bundesliga title race very much alive, although Hansi Flick's team have a winnable run of matches upcoming and they remain top, two points clear of RB Leipzig, who lost 3-1 at home to Borussia Dortmund, for whom Erling Braut Haaland scored twice. Third-placed Bayer Leverkusen are four points off the top after drawing 1-1 with Werder Bremen. Three days after a 3-1 home loss to reigning champions Juventus which ended a 27-game unbeaten run in Serie A stretching back to June, AC Milan bounced back to beat Torino 2-0 at San Siro. With second-placed city rivals Inter drawing at Roma, Milan are now three points clear at the top of the table, and remain seven ahead of Juventus, who are fourth but do have a game in hand. Added good news for Milan came with the return of veteran top scorer Zlatan Ibrahimovic as a late substitute for his first appearance since November 22 after injury. The Swede came on for Rafael Leao, who had earlier scored his third goal in five games. Can Zlatan now fire the Rossoneri to their first Scudetto since 2011? Mauricio Pochettino got his first victory as coach of Paris Saint-Germain, a 3-0 defeat of Brest, but it is Lyon who lead halfway through the Ligue 1 season. They claimed the symbolic title of autumn champions after coming back from 2-0 down to draw 2-2 at Rennes on Saturday with Memphis Depay scoring one fine goal before setting up Jason Denayer's equaliser. Rudi Garcia's team are unbeaten in 16 games although both PSG and Lille are just a point behind, and there is a very long way to go. Ensuring Depay stays to see out the remainder of his contract rather than leaving this month will be crucial."
10,09/01/2021,18:25,Schalke avoid Bundesliga longest winless run after Hoppe hat-trick,Schalke avoided a record-equalling 31st consecutive Bundesliga game without a victory on Saturday as American teenager Matthew Hoppe netted a hat-trick in a 4-0 thrashing of Hoffenheim to lift his side off the bottom of the table.,"After the 30-match run in the league, the Royal Blues enjoyed their first Bundesliga win in just under a year as 19-year-old Hoppe converted three chances created by Morocco's Amine Harit, who scored the fourth goal. ""The relief is big, huge even. But that was only one step. Now we have to move on,"" said sports director Jochen Schneider with his side still four points from guaranteed safety in the table. After his impressive display, Hoppe shyly claimed he had ""no words"" to describe the euphoria. ""I hope we keep fighting,"" he added. Mainz replace Schalke at the bottom of the table after a 2-0 home defeat to Eintracht Frankfurt, while Tasmania Berlin, who went 31 games without a win in the 1965/66 season, keep the Bundesliga record for the longest winless run. After league leaders Bayern Munich crashed to a 3-2 defeat at Borussia Moenchengladbach on Friday, second-placed RB Leipzig can go top with a home win against Borussia Dortmund later on Saturday. In Gelsenkirchen, Hoffenheim were missing 11 players either injured or suspended, while the hosts were captained by Sead Kolasinac, 27, who was making his first Schalke appearance back on loan from Arsenal. Both teams had early chances, but Hoppe got the breakthrough with a deft chip to put Schalke ahead just before the break. The teenager doubled the hosts' lead on 57 minutes when Harit's pass again put him in behind the defence to calmly round Hoffenheim's goalkeeper and fire into an empty net. Hoppe claimed his hat-trick just after the hour mark when put into space by another sublime Harit pass to fire home with another deft chip. Harit then completed the rout by hitting the bottom left-hand corner ten minutes from time. After defeats to Bayern and Eintracht Frankfurt, third-placed Bayer Leverkusen drew 1-1 at home to Werder Bremen as Patrik Schick equalised after Omer Toprak put Bremen ahead from a free-kick with only their second chance of the game. Union Berlin climbed to fourth after a controversial 2-2 draw at home to Wolfsburg, who came from behind after Maximilian Arnold was sent off just after the break. Renato Steffen gave Wolfsburg an early lead with a header, but Union striker Sheraldo Becker equalised with a crisp shot after squandering a clear chance. It was 1-1 at the break, but Arnold was shown a straight red for a nudge on Liverpool loanee Taiwo Awoniyi just outside the area and Union midfielder Robert Andrich fired in the resulting free-kick on 52 minutes. Union had the ball in the net again with an hour played, but the goal was disallowed as the referee judged Awoniyi had fouled Wolfsburg goalkeeper Koen Casteels. Wolfsburg striker Wout Weghorst equalised on 67 minutes by converting a penalty after a handball by Union defender Marcus Ingvartsen. Freiburg set a new club record of five straight league wins, which has seen them climb from 14th to eighth in the table, with a 5-0 romp at home to Cologne."
11,08/01/2021,12:01,Kolasinac back to help Schalke avoid record-equalling 31 winless games,Bundesliga bottom side Schalke welcome back Arsenal loanee Sead Kolasinac on Saturday in their desperate bid to avoid a league-record equalling 31 games without a win.,"Having joined Arsenal in 2017, Kolasinac, a product of Schalke's academy, returns on loan until the end of the season to help the club fight relegation after nearly thirty consecutive years in Germany's top flight. Their last league win was in January 2020 and failure to beat Hoffenheim at home will see Schalke equal the record of Tasmania Berlin, who went 31 games without a win during their single, disastrous Bundesliga season in 1965/66. ""No one should be afraid of this challenge,"" demanded Kolasinac, who made 123 appearances for Schalke from 2012 until 2017. ""I have a strong back, but I can't carry the whole load alone. ""We all have to stick together. We need the fans, the whole club, the supervisory board."" Approaching the halfway point of the season, Schalke are bottom and seven points from 15th which means guaranteed survival. Under Christian Gross, their fourth head coach since September, cash-strapped Schalke need a new forward after Wales striker Rabbi Matondo joined Stoke City on loan. Schalke are desperate to avoid matching Tasmania Berlin, who played in the 1965/66 Bundesliga season as last-minute replacements after Hertha Berlin were thrown out for breaking salary rules. Catapulted up from the regional leagues, Tasmania scored only 15 goals, won two of their 34 games, conceded a league-record 108 goals and were relegated in last place, never to return to the Bundesliga. Despite winning their first game in front of 80,000 at Berlin's Olympic Stadium, heavy defeats saw interest dwindle and just over 800 spectators turned up to one home game. ""It was a suicide mission,"" Hans-Gunter Becker, who captained Tasmania in 1965/66, told AFP subsidiary SID. ""We also had 800 spectators for one game, a record that will never happen again, unless you include the coronavirus era, but there is no need to talk about that."" The 82-year-old still remembers the stress of being branded the league's worst side and has sympathy with Schalke. ""I know from experience about this burden that weighs on the players,"" he added. ""I would really like it if the Schalke players find it in their hearts to say 'Let's leave the record to Tasmania'."""
12,08/01/2021,02:46,Road to nowhere: How bad is Schalke's wait for a win?,"Schalke host Hoffenheim on Saturday needing victory to avoid equalling the all-time Bundesliga record for most matches without a win of 31 games, set by Tasmania Berlin in the 1965/66 season.","Here, AFP Sport takes a look at other miserable winless streaks in Europe's biggest leagues: Derby County: 32 Premier League matches (2007/08) -- Newly-promoted Derby set multiple records in the 2007/08 Premier League, including the lowest points tally of only 11 from their 38 games. The Rams' only league win of the campaign came in their sixth fixture against Newcastle United, but they failed to secure another victory and were relegated in March. Sporting Gijon: 24 La Liga matches (1997/98) -- Sporting set several records in the 1997/98 La Liga season, including the longest winless run of 24 games, although that spanned two terms. They finished bottom of the Spanish top flight with a La Liga record-breaking 13 points, although they did at least win two games after finally snapping the streak on February 8, 1998. Like Derby, they were relegated in March, becoming the first La Liga side to have their fate sealed before April. Ancona: 28 Serie A matches (2003/04); Varese: 28 Serie A matches (1971/72) -- Ancona failed to win a single Serie A game between September 2003 and April 2004, although they did at least manage seven draws in their 28-match winless run. They mustered 13 points over the whole season, which fittingly ended in bankruptcy and relegation to the Italian fourth tier. Their run matches that of Varese, whose ""achievement"" in going 28 matches without a win was arguably even more impressive as it came in a 30-game season, in a 16-team league, in 1971-72. The club from just north of Milan, near the shores of Lake Maggiore, went almost the entire campaign without a victory before breaking their duck in the penultimate round of matches. Needless to say they finished bottom. Arles-Avignon: 23 Ligue 1 matches (2010/11) -- Arles-Avignon ""enjoyed"" a single season in France's top flight in 2010/11. They lost their first eight games in Ligue 1, eventually recording their maiden victory in early November. However that was followed by a miserable sequence of 23 games without tasting another win. By the time they won again, they had already been relegated. In fact their fate was sealed in record quick time, with seven games of the campaign remaining, and they finished 15 points adrift at the foot of the table. In 2015 they dropped down into the amateur ranks and are these days to be found plying their trade in the regional leagues. -- Although far from Europe's top leagues, Scottish outfit Fort William were dubbed the UK's ""worst professional football team"" during a run of 73 games without a win in all competitions. The Highland League outfit finally ended more than 700 days without success in 2019 with a North of Scotland Cup triumph over Nairn County. In the 2018-19 season, Fort William finished bottom of their league with minus seven points following a nine-point deduction, conceding 245 goals in 34 matches."
13,08/01/2021,02:45,Dortmund hunt win at high-fliers Leipzig to rejoin title race,Borussia Dortmund are hunting a win at second-placed RB Leipzig on Saturday to get back in the Bundesliga title race while elsewhere two German league records could be equalled this weekend.,"At the top of the table, Bayern Munich coach Hansi Flick can claim 100 league points in his first 39 games if the league leaders win at Borussia Moenchengladbach on Friday. Pep Guardiola is the only other Bundesliga coach to have reached the milestone in the same number of games after taking charge of Bayern in 2013. At the other end of the table, bottom side Schalke could equal the league record of 31 games without victory if they lose or draw at home to Hoffenheim. In Saturday night's top match, Dortmund head to Leipzig in the ""role of the hunter"", according to sports director Michael Zorc, chasing an away win to trim the eight-point gap behind leaders Bayern. A late Jadon Sancho goal sealed their 2-0 win at home to Wolfsburg last Sunday, but Dortmund are fourth after defeats to Stuttgart and Union Berlin in December dented their title hopes. Dortmund must break their habit of conceding goals at set pieces which has drawn fierce internal criticism. ""Too often we haven't played grown-up football and our style was bound to see us drop points,"" Dortmund defender Mats Hummels fumed in Sport Bild, harsh criticism caretaker coach Edin Terzic regards as ""legitimate and productive"". Up front, Dortmund striker Erling Braut Haaland needs to finish his chances after the 20-year-old fired a blank last Sunday on his return after a hip injury. Haaland's 16-year-old understudy Youssoufa Moukoko is struggling with a knee injury. Dortmund have lost five of their 14 games this season and Terzic can ill-afford to lose at Leipzig, 10 days before facing third-placed Bayer Leverkusen. ""The whole of January will set the tone for the rest of the Bundesliga season,"" Terzic admits. Leipzig are on a nine-match unbeaten run in the Bundesliga, including a thrilling 3-3 draw at Bayern last month, and their defence has only conceded nine league goals all season. Their head coach Julian Nagelsmann is ""already planning"" the club's first win over Dortmund since 2017, ""because we're brave enough, in a very good mood"" and have home advantage. Nagelsmann is missing several players as Christopher Nkunku aggravated an ankle injury in training, while new signing Dominik Szoboszlai is struggling with a groin problem. The Liverpool loanee has scored five goals in his last seven league games which has helped Union Berlin climb to fifth ahead of Saturday's home game against Wolfsburg. With Germany striker Max Kruse recovering from a knee injury, burly 23-year-old Awoniyi spearheaded Union's attack by setting up team-mate Sheraldo Becker before tapping home to seal a 2-0 win at Werder Bremen last Saturday. The Nigerian international is making an impact at Union after seven loan moves in three different countries since joining Liverpool in 2015 after winning the African Under-20 Championships. 19 - the league goals scored by Bayern striker Robert Lewandowski, who netted twice against Mainz last Sunday. Haaland is his nearest rival on 10 goals. 97 - the league points Flick has accumulated as Bayern Munich head coach in his first 38 games with 31 wins, four draws and three defeats since taking charge in November 2019. 31 - Jadon Sancho's goal against Wolfsburg was his 31st in the Bundeliga. The England winger turns 21 in March and no-one else has scored so many German league goals at such a young age. Fixtures (all times 1430GMT unless stated)"
14,02/01/2021,23:24,Near-forgotten minnows urge 'save our record' as Schalke hit 30 matches without win,"Schalke 04 are now winless in their last 30 league games - one match short of the Bundesliga's record for the longest winless streak, which near-forgotten minnows Tasmania Berlin are desperate to keep.","Placards reading ""That is our record! Ra-Ra-Ra Tasmania (The Original)"" and ""Save the record for Tas!"" were laid out in front of Berlin's Olympic Stadium before Schalke's 3-0 defeat to Hertha Berlin on Saturday. Christian Gross, Schalke's fourth head coach this season, got off to a losing start as Arsenal loanee Matteo Guendouzi, Colombia striker Jhon Cordoba and his replacement, Poland forward Krzysztof Piatek, scored for Hertha. ""I hope we can still sign in one or two players, who could bring a bit of personality,"" said Gross after watching his new team's latest loss. Schalke, who are bottom of the league, boosted their squad last Thursday by re-signing defender Sead Kolasinac, who did not face Hertha, on loan from Arsenal. They host Hoffenheim next Saturday and are now one match from equalling the league record, long held by Tasmania Berlin, who went 31 matches without winning in the 1965/66 Bundesliga season. Tasmania Berlin, based in the capital's central district of Neukoelln, now languish in the fifth-tier of German football. Their chairman Almir Numic - a fan of Schalke's arch rivals Borussia Dortmund - has mixed feelings about potentially losing the record. ""As a Dortmund fan, I wouldn't mind if Schalke continued without a win and even get relegated,"" he told website Fussball.de ""On the other hand, this story is simply part of the identity of 'Tas'. ""Our only Bundesliga season was five and a half decades ago, but we are still a topic - nationwide. We don't really have to do any advertising."""
15,02/01/2021,23:20,Olmo fires RB Leipzig top of Bundesliga ahead of Bayern Munich,RB Leipzig dislodged Bayern Munich at the top of the Bundesliga table Saturday as Dani Olmo's second-half goal was enough to seal a 1-0 win at Stuttgart.,"""It was really good for me and the team to start the year with a win,"" Olmo told DAZN. With European champions Bayern at home to strugglers Mainz on Sunday, Leipzig took the chance to go a point ahead as Olmo fired through the legs of Stuttgart goalkeeper Gregor Kobel. Stuttgart's Swiss shot-stopper had earlier pulled off some heroics by using his foot to save a Emil Forsberg first-half penalty attempt. Leipzig also wasted a golden chance when Amadou Haidara fired wide just after the break. With 23 minutes left, Spain midfielder Olmo finally got the breakthrough, finishing a move he started after Leipzig had moved the ball across the Stuttgart penalty area. ""It feels good to be top,"" admitted Leipzig defender Willi Orban. ""The first half was good, the second was better - we were clearly the dominant team."" Earlier, Bayer Leverkusen blew the chance to take first place after stumbling to a 2-1 defeat at Eintracht Frankfurt which saw them drop to third as the league resumed after a two-week break. ""I have made my feelings clear in the dressing room,"" Leverkusen head coach Peter Bosz told Sky. ""We deserved to lose. Frankfurt had a better claim to the victory."" Leverkusen midfielder Nadiem Amiri scored with a deft back-heel flick to give the visitors the lead after only 10 minutes in Frankfurt. However, Amin Younes equalised to make it 1-1 at half-time before Japan midfielder Daichi Kamada put in a cross which Leverkusen defender Edmond Tapsoba turned into his own net. Before kickoff, Frankfurt director Fredi Bobic confirmed reports his club are interested in Bayern's teenage striker Joshua Zirkzee, 19, after selling Dutch forward Bas Dost to Brugge. Zirkzee could back up Frankfurt's top scorer Andre Silva, who has notched nine league goals this season. Union Berlin rose to fourth - into the Champions League places for the first time in the club's history - after their 2-0 win at Werder Bremen. Liverpool loanee Taiwo Awoniyi, who has scored in his last three league games, capped another impressive display with a goal and assist. After Bremen lost the ball in their own half, the 23-year-old Nigeria international took advantage of a two-on-two situation by drawing the defence and passing to Sheraldo Becker, who fired home on 12 minutes. Awoniyi doubled Union's lead on 28 minutes by tapping the ball over the line, just out of the reach of Bremen goalkeeper Jiri Pavlenka. Bremen had a penalty appeal turned down when a shot by Japan midfielder Yuya Osako clipped the hand of a Union defender, then Romano Schmid had a goal ruled offside. Hoffenheim lost both defender Kevin Akpoguma and Germany midfielder Sebastian Rudy with early leg injuries as they crashed to a 3-1 home defeat to Freiburg. With the hosts struggling to reshuffle, Freiburg were 3-0 up at half-time thanks to a Baptiste Santamaria goal, a Vincenzo Grifo penalty and an own goal by Senegal defender Kasim Adams. Hoffenheim scored a second-half consolation goal through Togo winger Ihlas Bebou. Borussia Moenchengeladbach, who host Manchester City in the first leg of the Champions League last 16 next month, earned their first win in five league games with a 1-0 victory at Arminia Bielefeld. Swiss striker Breel Embolo netted the winning goal just after half-time when he held off a defender and fired home. Mid-table Augsburg rebounded after back-to-back defeats with a 1-0 win at Cologne with Brazilian winger Iago netting the late winner. Bottom side Schalke are now 30 games without a win -- one short of the Bundesliga record -- after a 3-0 defeat away to Hertha Berlin. Former Tottenham manager Christian Gross, installed as Schalke's fourth head coach this season, got off to a losing start as Arsenal loanee Matteo Guendouzi, Colombia striker Jhon Cordoba and his replacement, Poland forward Krzysztof Piatek, scored for Hertha. Having netted two minutes after coming off the bench, Piatek had a second late goal ruled offside."
16,31/12/2020,16:56,Arsenal's Kolasinac joins Schalke on loan,"Sead Kolasinac has agreed to join Bundesliga side Schalke on loan for the rest of the season, Arsenal announced on Thursday.","The Bosnia defender, 27, will head back to the club where he joined the youth set-up and went on to become a first-team regular before moving to the Premier League in June 2017. Kolasinac's loan move is set to begin on January 4. The full-back has made 113 appearances for Arsenal. Arsenal technical director Edu told the club website: ""Sead needs to be playing regularly, so we have decided together that a move back to Germany with Schalke will benefit him at this moment. ""We will be keeping in close contact with Sead, and wish him huge success for the remainder of the season with Schalke."" Schalke are currently bottom of the Bundesliga with just four points and without a win all season."

""We are in a tough situation. Our aim is to survive. I am sure that Christian Gross is the right man to help us be successful in that goal."" The 66-year-old Gross becomes the fourth manager since late September at a club whose run of Bundesliga games without a win has stretched to 29. David Wagner was fired after the club opened the season with an 8-0 loss to Bayern Munich and a home defeat to Werder Bremen. Manuel Baum was in turn axed on December 18 after drawing four and losing six in the Bundesliga. Huub Stevens took over as caretaker and oversaw another Bundesliga loss and a cup win at fourth-tier Ulm. Gross spent nine months at Tottenham Hotspur in 1997-8, taking over with the club in the bottom three and leading them to 14th. He enjoyed his greatest success in a 10-year stint at Basel where he won four Swiss league titles. He also won trophies with Grasshoppers in Switzerland, Al-Ahly in Saudi Arabia and Zamalek in Egypt. In a previous 10-month spell in Germany, he led Stuttgart to sixth place and Europa League qualification. This is his first appointment at a European club since 2012."
18,18/12/2020,14:33,Struggling Schalke sack Baum after 79 days as Stevens returns,"The Bundesliga's bottom club Schalke 04 on Friday confirmed the sacking of Manuel Baum after just 79 days as head coach, with Huub Stevens returning for his fourth stint to try to end their 28-game winless streak in the league.","Schalke are already on their third coach this season as Stevens, 67, replaces Baum, who was appointed on September 30 after predecessor David Wagner was sacked. At the time, Baum was described as the club's ""last bullet"" in the fight against relegation. Wednesday's 2-0 home loss to Freiburg left Schalke three matches short of the league record of 31 games without victory, set by Tasmania Berlin in 1965/66. This Saturday's home meeting with Arminia Bielefeld, who occupy the relegation play-off spot, is a chance for Schalke to claim a first Bundesliga win since January. After nearly 30 years in Germany's top flight, Schalke are six points from safety. ""The game against Bielefeld has enormous meaning for our club,"" said Schalke director Jochen Schneider. ""The team needs a new impulse and we trust Huub Stevens and (his assistant coach) Mike Bueskens to bring just that."" Stevens is a club legend having steered Schalke to their 1997 UEFA Cup final triumph, beating Inter Milan on penalties when Bueskens was in the side. Stevens last stepped in at Schalke when Domenico Tedesco was sacked in March 2019. The Dutchman led the team to a 4-2 win at arch rivals Dortmund the following month which kept Schalke in the Bundesliga at the end of the 2018/19 season. ""That was definitely the last time,"" Stevens insisted at the time, yet just over 18 months later he is back. The Gelsenkirchen club, who have huge debts, are taking a financial gamble with Wagner and Baum, who both signed contracts until 2022, still on their payroll."
19,16/12/2020,23:00,Schalke 04 short of the longest winless streak,Robert Lewandowski passed the milestone of 250 Bundesliga goals on Wednesday with both goals in Bayern Munich's 2-1 home win over Wolfsburg to keep the European champions in touch with German league leaders Bayer Leverkusen.,"Lewandowski, who finds out Thursday whether he has been voted FIFA's player of the year having been shortlisted alongside Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi, has scored 18 goals in 17 games for Bayern this season in all competitions. ""I haven't thought about it (the awards), I was just focused on this game - I'm pretty relaxed about it, let's see what happens,"" he told Sky after his two goals. Leverkusen, who host Bayern in Saturday's top-of-the-table clash, remain first in the table - a point ahead of Munich - after a 4-0 romp away to Cologne in the Rhineland derby. Wolfsburg took a shock lead within five minutes at the Allianz Arena when Leroy Sane's error on the edge of the area led to Maximilian Philipp smashing home the loose ball. Wolfsburg's Dutch striker Wout Weghorst then had a goal ruled offside on 17 minutes. However, Lewandowski reached the 250-goal milestone when he headed Bayern's equaliser just before the break. He became only the third to achieve the feat alongside Bayern legend Gerd Mueller and Schalke striker Klaus Fischer. Lewandowski then fired the winner into the bottom corner of the net on 50 minutes. He has now claimed 23 goals in 20 league matches against Wolfsburg. Wolfsburg suffered their first league defeat this season as Bayern got back to winning ways after drawing their two previous league games. In Cologne, Leverkusen remain the league's only unbeaten team after racing into a 2-0 lead on ten minutes thanks to goals by Mitchell Weiser and Moussa Diaby. Czech striker Patrik Schick added Leverkusen's third early in the second half when he buried Diaby's cross before former Cologne player Florian Wirtz grabbed the visitor's fourth. Things remain tight at the top of the table as third-placed RB Leipzig stayed level on 28 points with Bayern with a 1-0 win at Hoffenheim thanks to Yussuf Poulsen's second-half winner. Schalke 04 are three short of matching an unwanted Bundesliga record after their 2-0 home defeat against Freiburg left the league's bottom side without a win in their last 28 games. ""We lose hope too quickly. We must have more belief,"" Schalke defender Benjamin Stambouli told Sky. Schalke are closing in fast on the record, held by Tasmania Berlin who in their one Bundesliga season, went 31 matches without winning in 1965/66. Schalke coach Manuel Baum, who took charge in September after predecessor David Wagner was fired, already has the unwanted club record of being winless in his first 10 games. Freiburg winger Roland Sallai headed the visitors ahead after 50 minutes behind closed doors in Gelsenkirchen, then added a second 18 minutes later when he chipped home a perfectly-timed pass. Having only ended their own nine-match winless streak on Saturday with a 2-0 home victory against Arminia Bielefeld, Freiburg are up to 10th in the table. Schalke have now not won a game since January. With a third of the season gone, they are six points from safety and on course for relegation after 30 unbroken seasons in Germany's top tier. This Saturday, Schalke have their next chance to end their miserable run at home to Bielefeld, who remain in the bottom three after Wednesday's 1-0 home defeat to Augbsurg."

""The table is only a snapshot, but it's an important one because we know how tough this league can be,"" said midfielder Julian Baumgartlinger after Leverkusen went top for the first time in six years. Hoffenheim's Florian Grillitsch brushed the bar with a header after just 14 seconds, but it was Leverkusen who landed the first blow on four minutes. Playing a quick one-two with Nadiem Amiri from a Leverkusen corner, Bailey curled the ball brilliantly into the top corner from the edge of the penalty area. A misjudged pass from Andrej Kramaric allowed Bailey to double the lead just before the half-hour mark, rounding stranded goalkeeper Oliver Baumann and slotting the ball into the open goal from 20 yards out. Baumann kept his side in the game with a flying save to deny Florian Wirtz just before half-time, and Christoph Baumgartner pulled a goal back with a brilliant long-range strike after the break. Yet Hoffenheim's joy was short-lived, as Wirtz danced through the box and beat Baumann with a dainty chip on 55 minutes. The visitors' fate was sealed when both Grillitsch and Stefan Posch were sent off for second yellow cards within 15 minutes, and Lucas Alario added a fourth for Leverkusen with a stoppage-time penalty. Earlier Sunday, Schalke's hopes of a first win in 27 games were dashed by Marco Richter's stoppage-time equaliser in a 2-2 draw overshadowed by a serious injury to Mark Uth. Richter's late header crowned a heartbreaking evening for Schalke, who remain on course to equal Tasmania Berlin's notorious, 54-year-old Bundesliga record of 31 games without a win. Schalke's misery was compounded by concerns for Uth, who was stretchered from the field unconscious after a clash of heads with Augsburg defender Felix Uduokhai in the 10th minute. The striker was treated on-field for around 15 minutes before being carried from the pitch attached to a drip and wearing a neck brace. Schalke later confirmed that the 29-year-old was ""stable and responsive"" and on his way to hospital, but both sets of players were left visibly shocked by the incident. ""I didn't realise how serious it was at first, but then I saw him lying on the floor. A lot of things go through your head, I was scared and worried. I am so happy that he is ok,"" Uduokhai told Sky. After the game resumed with a 15-minute delay, Augsburg took the lead from a corner in the 32nd minute, Suat Serdar accidentally heading the ball into his own net. Benito Raman levelled the scores with a delicate chip over goalkeeper Rafal Gikiewicz on 52 minutes, before a second yellow card for Florian Niederlechner dealt another blow to Augsburg moments later. Serdar then redeemed himself as he fired a low cross towards Nassim Boujellab, who smashed the ball past Gikiewicz to give Schalke the lead. Yet Richter dashed hopes of a first league win since January 17 when he flicked a Michael Gregoritsch cross past Ralf Faehrmann two minutes from time to save a point for 10-man Augsburg. The draw leaves Schalke bottom of the league, with just four points from 11 games this season."

Schalke stayed rock bottom with their historic winless streak now at an eye-watering 26 games. The struggling giants have not won since January, and are now just five matches away from equalling the unwanted record set by Tasmania Berlin in 1966. Tasmania's record of 31 games without a win has long been considered unassailable. Promoted to the top flight for political reasons, the club picked up just two wins and eight points in a famously disastrous season. Yet Schalke, who were playing in the Champions League just two seasons ago, continued to close in on the miserable mark after their seventh defeat of the season on Sunday. Leverkusen took the lead from a corner after just ten minutes, Malick Thiaw heading into his own net as he vied for the ball with Aleksandar Dragovic. Nassim Boujellab found the net for Schalke on 32 minutes, but his celebrations were immediately cut short by the linesman's flag. Goalkeeper Michael Langer kept a dominant Leverkusen at bay until the 67th minute, when Baumgartlinger headed in a Leon Bailey corner to double the lead. Schalke's night only got worse as Steven Skrzybski's penalty was saved by Lukas Hradecky before Schick smashed in Leverkusen's third 12 minutes from time. Earlier on Sunday, Congolese winger Silas Wamangituka scored twice to give Stuttgart a 2-1 away win over Werder Bremen. After scoring from the spot in the first half, Wamangituka prompted a furious reaction from the Bremen players and was booked for unsportsmanlike conduct when he provocatively walked the ball into the open goal to seal the win in stoppage time. ""The way he finished was obviously disrespectful. He had a very good game and he should just tap the ball in, and not make a song and dance about it,"" Bremen's Davie Selke told Sky. It was a first win in six games for promoted side Stuttgart, who have nonetheless started strongly upon their return to the Bundesliga under American coach Pellegrino Matarazzo. Matarazzo's side now sit eighth in the table, having picked up 14 points from their first 10 games. Wamangituka gave Stuttgart the lead just after the half-hour mark, smashing the ball in from 12 yards after Manchester United loanee Tahith Chong fouled Wataru Endo in the box. The Congolese winger sealed the victory in stoppage time after pouncing on a mistake by goalkeeper Jiri Pavlenka. Selke nodded in a consolation goal before the final whistle, but it was too little, too late for the home side. Bremen have not won since the first week of October, and have now dropped to 12th after a promising start to the season."

The Norwegian now has 10 goals in seven Bundesliga matches this season to give him a total of 31 goals in 30 games in all competitions for Dortmund. After Matheus Cunha gave Hertha a first-half lead at Berlin's Olympic Stadium, Dortmund roared back. Haaland equalised when he tapped home an Emre Can pass on 47 minutes. He grabbed his second two minutes later with perfect timing to slip his marker and fire in a Julian Brandt pass. Haaland wrapped up his hat-trick on 62 minutes, just before Raphael Guerreiro stabbed the ball home from close range to make it 4-1. Cunha converted a late penalty, but the night belonged to Haaland who finished a move he started with 10 minutes to play. There was still time for history to be made as Moukoko made a late cameo off the Dortmund bench to replace Haaland. One day after his 16th birthday, Moukoko is the youngest player in Bundesliga history. ""He's only just turned 16 -- that is amazing,"" Haaland said of Moukoko. ""He has a big career ahead of him."" Dortmund's romp in Berlin moved them second in the standings, behind defending champions Bayern who stayed top despite a 1-1 home draw with Werder Bremen. Germany goalkeeper Manuel Neuer produced great stops to twice deny US forward Josh Sargent as Bremen earned their first point at Bayern for a decade. ""We had to invest a lot,"" Neuer told Sky. The 34-year-old bounced back after conceding six goals in Germany's crushing defeat by Spain in midweek with two brilliant first-half saves in quick succession. He used a boot to block a Sargent shot, then lunged across goal to save from Ludwig Augustinsson. In the dying stages, Neuer then stood tall to block a shot by Sargent, who had broken clear. Bayern coach Hansi Flick was far from pleased that Bremen took the lead in his 50th game in charge, saying his team ""have to defend better"". Bremen deservedly went ahead just before half-time when midfielder Maximilian Eggestein finished off a superb attack. ""We conceded a very cheap goal, that's how Bremen's plan worked and they defended very well,"" said Bayern forward Thomas Mueller. Kingsley Coman equalised in the 62nd minute at the Allianz Arena by meeting a Leon Goretzka cross at the far post. Bayern forward Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting fired over with the goal at his mercy five minutes from time. However, Neuer's heroics at the other end preserved the draw. Bayer Leverkusen are third after their 2-1 win at strugglers Arminia Bielefeld thanks to Aleksandar Dragovic's late winner. The victory was a relief for Leverkusen goalkeeper Lukas Hradecky, who scored a embarrassing own goal early in the second half. Leverkusen were 1-0 up thanks to a Leon Bailey goal when Hradecky sliced a clearance, which rolled into the empty net behind him. Dragovic stabbed home from close range two minutes from time to spare Hradecky's blushes. RB Leipzig sit fourth after Yussuf Poulsen came off the bench and produced a deft second-half volley in their 1-1 draw at Eintracht Frankfurt after winger Aymen Barkok gave the hosts an early lead. Despite having seven players quarantined with the coronavirus, a depleted Hoffenheim drew 3-3 at home with Stuttgart. Schalke's winless run stretched to 24 league games, dating back to January, after losing 2-0 at home to Wolfsburg. A Daniel Caligiuri equaliser two minutes from time gave 10-man Augsburg a 1-1 draw at Borussia Moenchengladbach."
26,07/11/2020,18:33,"Leipzig go top in Germany ahead of Bayern, Dortmund showdown",RB Leipzig went back to the top of the Bundesliga table on Saturday with a 3-0 home win over Freiburg before Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund clash in the evening showdown.,"Defender Ibrahima Konate fired home Leipzig's opener before midfielder Marcel Sabitzer added their second goal with a 70th-minute penalty. Manchester City loanee Angelino claimed Leipzig's third with a stunning free-kick which curled over the Freiburg wall just before the final whistle. The home win put Leipzig top, a point ahead of Bayern and Dortmund who meet later at Signal Iduna Park. ""We really deserved the win - we were very, very good in the first-half,"" said Leipzig head coach Julian Nagelsmann. He was especially pleased with Konate's opening goal from a towering cross before winger Christopher Nkunku, who scored in the mid-week win over Paris Saint Germain, won the penalty which Sabitzer converted after the VAR scrutinised the decision. ""We have trained a lot from set pieces,"" said Nagelsmann. ""It certainly wasn't an obvious penalty, but if the VAR says it was, then it must have been,"" he added after Nkunku went down after the slightest of touches from Freiburg defender Nicolas Hoefler. Union Berlin climbed to fourth with a 5-0 home thrashing of strugglers Arminia Bielefeld. Former Germany striker Max Kruse helped set up Union's first three goals, then converted a late penalty. After just three minutes, Japan winger Keita Endo scored his first goal for Union when he swept home Sheraldo Becker's final pass after Kruse's superb long pass. Endo went off with an injury soon after, but Union kept up the pressure as Kruse set up the next two goals for centre-back Robert Andrich and winger Becker. Kruse, 32, capped an outstanding display by converting a penalty before Cedric Teuchert, a right wing replacement for Becker, grabbed Union's late fourth goal. At the other end of the table, bottom side Mainz were held to a 2-2 draw at home to Schalke, who sit one place above them and have now gone 23 games without a league win dating back to January. After Daniel Brosinski and Jean-Philippe Mateta converted penalties for Mainz, Mark Uth pulled a goal back for Schalke who were 2-1 down late on. Schalke took a deserved point back to Gelsenkirchen when Mainz defender Jeremiah St. Juste turned the ball into his own net eight minutes from time. After five games without a win, Hertha Berlin roared back with a 3-0 win in the fog at Augsburg. Forwards Matheus Cunha, Dodi Lukebakio and Krzysztof Piatek, who cost Hertha 24 million euros ($28 million) from AC Milan in January, got on the scoresheet as Augsburg's defence crumbled."
27,03/11/2020,19:47,Schalke beat lowly Schweinfurt to win first game since February,"Struggling Schalke enjoyed their first win since February on Tuesday when they came from behind to beat fourth-tier minnows Schweinfurt 4-1 in a re-arranged German Cup, first round match.","Schalke are winless in 22 Bundesliga games, dating back to January, and their previous win in any competition was a German Cup tie the following month. Schalke head coach Manuel Baum got his first win on his fifth game in charge despite Schweinfurt taking a shock early lead through winger Martin Thomann at the Veltins Arena. Schalke roared back in Gelsenkirchen with goals by striker Vedad Ibisevic and winger Benito Raman while attacking midfielder Alessandro Schoepf netted twice. However the match was in the balance well into the second half, with Schalke goalkeeper Ralf Fahrmann pulling off a superb penalty save on 74 minutes with the top flight side at that point just a goal ahead. ""We can be very happy that Ralf Fahrmann saved the Schweinfurt penalty,"" Schalke winger Steven Skrzybski told Sky. ""We weren't exactly bursting with self-confidence, but we're all working hard and finally got the reward we deserve."" The match should have taken place in mid-September, but a legal appeal by third-division side Turkgucu Munich, who argued they should have taken Schweinfurt's place in the cup draw, was only settled in court last week."
28,29/10/2020,19:52,Sauce of the problem: Baum trying to tap 'ketchup bottle' Schalke,Schalke coach Manuel Baum has compared his Bundesliga strugglers to a bottle of ketchup as he tries to tap their talent and end a 21-match winless streak in Germany's top flight on Friday.,"""We're like a new ketchup bottle that you have to tap again after opening to get something out - we're still tapping,"" said Baum. Second-from-bottom Schalke's winless run stretches back to January. Baum took over after David Wagner was sacked in the wake of September's 8-0 thrashing at Bayern Munich, but results have failed to improve. Schalke crashed 3-0 at Dortmund last weekend and Baum desperately needs a win to drag them out of the relegation spots. ""Stuttgart is an opponent against whom we have a better chance of winning,"" said Baum even though mid-table Stuttgart are undefeated in their last five games. ""We have to show more than we did in Dortmund, where we brought little or nothing to the pitch in attack,"" he admitted after Schalke barely managed a shot on goal. Striker Mark Uth could return after a leg injury and Wales forward Rabbi Matondo is under pressure after a poor display at Dortmund before Baum hauled him off after 71 minutes."
29,23/10/2020,03:58,"Clasico, Dortmund v Schalke - what to look out for in Europe this weekend","Two of the biggest rivalries in world football will dominate the weekend's action in Europe, with the first Clasico of the season being followed by the Ruhr derby between Borussia Dortmund and Schalke on Saturday.","AFP Sport previews the standout action on the continent this weekend: Barcelona v Real Madrid, Saturday 1400 GMT Once the undisputed greatest fixture in world football, the Clasico has lost much of its lustre. Cristiano Ronaldo, Neymar and Andres Iniesta were among the superstars to move on from Real Madrid and Barcelona in recent years, and this year Gareth Bale and Luis Suarez departed too. Lionel Messi would have left as well, had Barcelona let him. Usually there would be 99,000 fans packed into the Camp Nou. This time, because of the coronavirus pandemic, there will be none. The huge global audience will remain, but it's a long time since these teams have been at such a collective low ebb. Barca are struggling to get back on their feet under new coach Ronald Koeman and lost 1-0 at Getafe last weekend. Real won La Liga last season but the last week gives a more accurate picture of where they stand: Zinedine Zidane's team lost 1-0 at home to Cadiz and then went down 3-2 to Shakhtar Donetsk in the Champions League. Madrid have lost just once in their last seven visits to the Camp Nou though. Borussia Dortmund v Schalke, Saturday 1630 GMT Another great fixture usually played before a huge crowd, only 300 fans will be allowed in to see Dortmund host Schalke, rather than the usual 80,000. These sides are fierce rivals and tensions are running extra high after Dortmund prodigy Youssoufa Moukoko, 15, received alleged death threats and racist abuse from Schalke fans after scoring a hat-trick in last Sunday's 3-2 win in an Under-19 derby. Dortmund, with Erling Braut Haaland leading the line, will be favourites to get the better of a struggling Schalke who lost 4-0 on their last visit in May. Schalke sacked coach David Wagner after their poor start this season followed a long winless run at the end of the last campaign. Manuel Baum has replaced him and got his first point last weekend against Union Berlin. Dortmund's 1-0 victory at Hoffenheim last weekend made it three wins out of four in the Bundesliga this season, but Lucien Favre's side lost 3-1 at Lazio in the Champions League in midweek. Atletico Madrid v Real Betis, Saturday 1900 GMT Atletico are hoping to take advantage of the struggles of Real Madrid and Barcelona to win a first La Liga title since 2014. The signing of Luis Suarez from Barcelona underlined their ambition, but they head into Saturday's home meeting with Betis on the rebound from their joint-worst defeat in Diego Simeone's nine years as coach in Wednesday's 4-0 loss at Bayern Munich. Manuel Pellegrini's Betis have been inconsistent so far but, with the likes of Nabil Fekir, Sergio Canales and the evergreen Joaquin, should not be underestimated. Lyon v Monaco, Sunday 2000 GMT Lyon and Monaco have been Champions League semi-finalists in recent seasons but are not in Europe at all in this campaign, so each is desperate to get back to the promised land. Lyon have started poorly in Ligue 1 with just two wins in seven but have kept hold of star men Memphis Depay and Houssem Aouar. Monaco have been inconsistent too under new coach Niko Kovac but in Wissam Ben Yedder they have one of Europe's most lethal marksmen. AC Milan v Roma, Monday 1945 GMT Milan put their perfect start to the Serie A campaign on the line when they welcome Roma to San Siro on Monday. The Rossoneri have won four out of four so far in the league with Zlatan Ibrahimovic in fine form, but Roma have some useful veterans of their own in attack in Edin Dzeko and Pedro and are also slowly building form."
30,23/10/2020,03:40,'Don't keep your distance' - Dortmund urged to get stuck into derby,Borussia Dortmund have been told to forget about social distancing and get stuck into arch-rivals Schalke in Saturday's derby as they look to challenge RB Leipzig at the top of the Bundesliga.,"Sports director Michael Zorc was fuming as Dortmund crashed to a 3-1 defeat to Lazio in Rome on Tuesday in their opening Champions League game after standing back from too many tackles. Covid-19 has cast a shadow over the Bundesliga this week with Werder Bremen, who host Hoffenheim Sunday, cancelling training Thursday after an unnamed player tested positive. Second-place Bayern Munich will face Eintracht Frankfurt on Saturday without Germany winger Serge Gnabry who sat out Wednesday's 4-0 thumping of Atletico Madrid after a positive test for the virus. As Germany recorded record high figures of the coronavirus on Thursday, most league games will be played behind closed doors. Just 300 home fans will be allowed to watch in Dortmund, whose boss Zorc urged his side not to keep their distance when defending against second-from-bottom Schalke. ""We observed the distancing rules when defending"" against Lazio, ""in exemplary fashion. We want to see a reaction,"" said Zorc drily ahead of Saturday's derby. Dortmund are third in the table, level with defending champions Bayern on nine points and just one behind leaders Leipzig. Erling Braut Haaland, who scored Dortmund's consolation goal in Rome, also netted as Schalke crashed to a 4-0 thrashing last May on their previous visit to Dortmund. Zorc wants to see ""fight and emotion"" from the home side. Gelsenkirchen-based Schalke are winless in their last 20 Bundesliga games and would love nothing more than to break their run at neighbours Dortmund. Schalke assistant coach Naldo knows all about getting a result at Signal Iduna Park. The Brazilian's last-gasp header in 2017 capped a stunning fight-back from four goals down as Schalke sealed a 4-4 draw away from home. ""Schalke will have a lot of passion, discipline and commitment - they will want to ruin our game,"" warned Zorc. Tensions are running extra high between the clubs after a racist incident last weekend. Dortmund prodigy Youssoufa Moukoko, 15, received alleged death threats and racist abuse from Schalke fans after scoring a hat-trick in Sunday's 3-2 win in an Under-19 derby in Gelsenkirchen. Schalke have apologised and are investigating the allegations. Dortmund are without centre-back Manuel Akanji, who is recovering from the coronavirus, and winger Thorgan Hazard who has a leg knock. Midfield enforcer Emre Can is available after missing the Lazio defeat with suspension. A left-back by trade, the Spaniard has scored in his last three games for league leaders RB Leipzig since moving up to the left wing. He bagged both superb goals in Tuesday's 2-0 win over Istanbul Basaksehir in the Champions League. The 23-year-old Manchester City loanee is supplying the goals in the absence of Timo Werner, who has joined Chelsea, and has been described as ""dangerous"" in front of goal by Leipzig sports director Markus Kroesche. Leipzig host Hertha Berlin on Saturday with Angelino out to add to his tally of four goals this season. 16 - the goals Schalke has conceded in just four league games so far this season. 22 - the goals Haaland, 20, has scored in 25 games for Dortmund since his transfer from Salzburg. 29 - the goals Bayern have scored in eight games this season including an 8-0 drubbing of Schalke in the opening game Fixtures (all times 1330 GMT unless stated)"
31,20/10/2020,11:29,Schalke investigate alleged racist abuse of Dortmund youngster,Bundesliga side Schalke said Tuesday they are investigating alleged death threats and racist abuse aimed at Borussia Dortmund's 15-year-old prodigy Youssoufa Moukoko during an Under-19 match.,"""Schalke 04 has evaluated the audio and video material of the match and is now working intensively on identifying the persons responsible,"" the club said in a statement. Cameroon-born Moukoko scored a hat-trick to seal a 3-2 away win over Dortmund's arch rivals in the youth game in Gelsenkirchen on Sunday. In a clip from the German FA's livestream of the game, fans could be heard screaming alleged threats and racist abuse at Moukoko. As each of the 300 tickets for the game were personalised due to coronavirus measures, Schalke hope to find the culprits. ""I am proud to have been born with this skin colour and I'll always be proud,"" Moukoko posted on his Instagram story alongside the ""Black Lives Matter"" hashtag. Dortmund striker Erling Braut Haaland, Bayern Munich centre-back Jerome Boateng and Chelsea defender Antonio Ruediger all supported Moukoko on social media. Schalke sporting director Jochen Schneider contacted Dortmund to apologise to Moukoko. ""What happened must be condemned in the strongest possible terms,"" said Schneider. ""It beggars belief the things that some people in society still think is acceptable."" German FA vice-president Guenter Distelrath, who is responsible for anti-discrimination measures, wants to see action taken against the culprits. ""I would welcome a clear signal,"" he added. ""The insults against Youssoufa Moukoko are intolerable and absolutely unacceptable."" Moukoko has sent scoring records tumbling in German youth football and could claim another landmark if he makes his Bundesliga debut after he turns 16 next month. He has already trained with Dortmund's senior squad. Moukoko could also become the youngest player in Champions League history in late November as Dortmund say they will add his name to their 'B' list for matches."
32,18/10/2020,20:09,Pacienca header earns Schalke's first point of the season,Bundesliga crisis club Schalke picked up their first point of the season on Sunday as Goncalo Paciencia's second-half equaliser rescued a 1-1 draw at home to Union Berlin.,"Paciencia's 69th minute header ended a nightmare start to the season for Schalke, who began the day with no points and one goal from their first three games. After a cagey first half, Marvin Friedrich nodded in a Christopher Trimmel cross to put Union ahead shortly after the break. Schalke coach Manuel Baum, who replaced David Wagner last month, responded by bringing on Paciencia, who levelled the scores with 20 minutes to play. After former Union player Steven Skrzybski had forced a corner on the counter-attack, the Portuguese striker found the net with a glancing header at the near post. The draw lifts Schalke off bottom spot and gives Baum's side a timely boost ahead of next week's derby at Borussia Dortmund. Yet the seven-time German champions are still without a win in 20 league games, in a miserable run which stretches back to January. Elsewhere, Eintracht Frankfurt and Portugal striker Andre Silva continued his electric early season form with a third goal in four Bundesliga games as his side drew 1-1 away to Cologne. Frankfurt missed the chance to draw level on points with league leaders RB Leipzig after Silva's first-half penalty was cancelled out by Ondrej Duda's equaliser. The visitors dominated a scrappy first half, and were rewarded just before the break when Sebastiaan Bornauw brought down Japan international Daichi Kamada in the box. Silva stepped up, and slotted the ball past Timo Horn to give his side a deserved lead. The Portuguese, who completed a permanent move from AC Milan last month, now has four goals from five games in all competitions. Duda levelled the scores shortly after half-time, blasting in a sharp cross from Kingsley Ehizibue to secure Cologne their first point of the season. Frankfurt now sit in fourth after four games, with only Leipzig, Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund having enjoyed a better start to the season."
33,30/09/2020,18:33,Struggling Schalke name Baum as Wagner's replacement,Cash-strapped Bundesliga strugglers Schalke 04 on Wednesday named Manuel Baum as head coach on a two-year contract with former club captain Naldo as his assistant.,"After David Wagner was sacked on Sunday, his successor Baum, 41, is tasked with ending Schalke's miserable 18-match winless streak in the Bundesliga dating back to January. His first game in charge will be at Champions League semi-finalists RB Leipzig on Saturday. ""Our most urgent task is to quickly give the team a sense of achieving success again, in training and in games,"" said Baum. ""I am convinced of the quality of our squad."" Schalke have had 12 different coaches in the last decade and Baum insists he knows ""what I'm doing and what I'm getting myself into"". He returns to the Bundesliga having coached Augsburg from 2016 until being fired in April 2019 with the team just above the relegation places. Since then he has coached the national Under-18 team. Former Brazil defender Naldo, 38, who recently ended his playing career at Monaco, made 80 appearances for Schalke from 2016 until 2019. ""It feels good to be back at Schalke,"" said the Brazilian. ""Everyone knows I took the club to my heart. ""I want to use everything I have learned in almost 19 years as a professional to support Manuel Baum."" Naldo's most famous goal for the Royal Blues was in November 2017 when his 94th minute header sealed a last-gasp 4-4 draw at rivals Dortmund as Schalke came back from four goals down. Baum is described by Schalke sports director Jochen Schneider as ""an absolute specialist"". ""His teams always had clear structures on the field. This is a very important factor in our current situation,"" Schneider added. He sees Baum as being a ""very good fit for Schalke"", but the new head coach will have to work with limited funds. On Wednesday, Schalke announced a loss of 9.7 million euros ($11.4 million) in the first half of the year, increasing their debt to 205.3 million euros."
34,27/09/2020,12:27,Schalke sack Wagner after worst start in the Bundesliga,"Schalke 04 announced on Sunday they have sacked head coach David Wagner after going 18 league games without a win, which includes the worst to a start to a season in Bundesliga history.","After 15 months in charge, time finally ran out for the 48-year-old former Huddersfield manager following Saturday's 3-1 defeat at home to Werder Bremen which left Schalke without a league victory since January. Having kicked off 2020/21 with a humiliating 8-0 loss at Bayern Munich last weekend, Schalke's record of 11 goals conceded with one scored in two defeats is the worst start to a season in the league's history. ""We hoped that we could turn things around. Unfortunately, the first two matches did not produce the necessary performances and results,"" said Schalke's sports director Jochen Schneider. ""We have therefore decided to take the path of a new start in terms of personnel,"" he added. ""Despite the disappointing results, this decision was anything but easy for us."" Wagner seemed resigned to his fate after Saturday's defeat, saying: ""I am the main person responsible, as a coach you need results and we aren't getting them."" His successor is expected to be announced soon, with former RB Leipzig boss Ralf Rangnick -- who has already coached Schalke in two stints -- among the best-known candidates linked to the vacant job. Having won promotion to the Premier League in 2017/18 with Huddersfield, Wagner returned to Germany with an enhanced reputation when he was unveiled as head coach of Gelsenkirchen-based Schalke in May 2019. Schalke lay third last December in Germany's top-flight, but crashed dramatically in 2020 conceding 48 goals and earning just six points in a disastrous end to last season. The cash-strapped Royal Blues have deep financial problems off the pitch and the coronavirus pandemic, with a loss of matchday revenue due to games played behind closed doors, has added to their debts."
35,21/09/2020,15:09,"Pirlo's debut, Mbappe's return and the Bayern juggernaut: European football talking points",Football across Europe is well and truly up and running again after the Italian Serie A and German Bundesliga seasons kicked off over the weekend. AFP Sport rounds up some of the main talking points from the action across the continent:,"European champions Bayern Munich returned to action 26 days after their Champions League triumph in Lisbon and began their Bundesliga campaign in style with an ominous 8-0 destruction of Schalke at an empty Allianz Arena. Serge Gnabry scored a hat-trick for Hansi Flick's team as they claimed a record victory for the opening weekend of a German top-flight season and suggested it is going to take something extraordinary to stop them winning a ninth consecutive Bundesliga title. Having won a treble last season, Bayern picked up where they left off and have now recorded a remarkable 22 straight victories. ""We're still hungry,"" insisted Leroy Sane, who was making his debut after arriving from Manchester City. While Thiago Alcantara has left for Liverpool, Sane's arrival adds extra quality in the final third and it will be a big ask for anyone to keep up with the pace set by Bayern. However, Borussia Dortmund impressed in their 3-0 win over Borussia Moenchengladbach and RB Leipzig were also victorious in their opening game. And Bayern's win does come with a caveat: a dreadful Schalke side were merely picking up where they left off at the end of last season in failing to win any of their last 16 Bundesliga outings. All eyes were on Andrea Pirlo as the rookie coach took charge of Juventus for the first time in their Serie A season opener against Sampdoria in Turin. Juventus began their bid for a 10th straight Scudetto by beating Claudio Ranieri's side 3-0 and a new face delivered the first goal of the new era, with 20-year-old Swedish winger Dejan Kulusevski's classy finish putting them ahead before Leonardo Bonucci and Cristiano Ronaldo also netted. ""It will take time. We lack players but we're trying to do the best with what we have,"" said Pirlo, who has not had long to settle in after replacing Maurizio Sarri in August. Another new face in the Juventus team on Sunday was Weston McKennie, the USA midfielder signed on loan from Schalke. Paris Saint-Germain have had a slow start to the new French season, their hangover after losing the Champions League final worsened by a raft of coronavirus cases and then a series of suspensions following an ugly brawl at the end of last week's home defeat by Marseille. But after losing their first two games of their Ligue 1 title defence, PSG edged a 1-0 win over Metz before looking more like themselves against Nice on Sunday in a 3-0 victory. It was no coincidence that the game marked the return of Kylian Mbappe after a spell on the sidelines following a positive coronavirus test. The World Cup winner won and then scored the penalty which gave PSG the lead, and made the second goal for Angel Di Maria just before half-time in PSG's 500th game since being taken over by Qatar Sports Investments in 2011. ""What he did was impressive,"" said Paris coach Thomas Tuchel. ""He does extraordinary things."" Spanish champions Real Madrid began their La Liga title defence -- and the post-Gareth Bale era -- with a flat 0-0 draw away to Real Sociedad and the headlines on Monday morning summed it up: ""Without punch"", said sports daily Marca, while As called it a ""debut without gunpowder"". With Norwegian starlet Martin Odegaard starting against the side for whom he impressed on loan last season, but with Casemiro on the bench and Eden Hazard absent altogether, Zinedine Zidane's men could not find a way through and there are legitimate questions about where this Real side really stands without any major new investment forthcoming. ""We defended well and were a little bit lacking up front, but we will work on that. We need to be calm,"" said Zidane."
36,19/09/2020,21:15,Haaland and Reyna shine as Dortmund youngsters down Gladbach,Erling Braut Haaland scored twice and 17-year-old Giovanni Reyna shone as youthful Borussia Dortmund swept aside fellow Champions League side Borussia Moenchengladbach 3-0 on Saturday on the opening weekend of the Bundesliga season.,"After holders Bayern Munich had kicked off the 2020/21 campaign on Friday with a record 8-0 thrashing of Schalke, Dortmund's youngsters also dazzled at home to Gladbach. ""It was a really good start to the season. We have a lot of young guys, it's fun to play with guys near my age,"" said USA Under-17 international Reyna. ""This is an exciting group and we have to keep working."" Haaland converted a second-half penalty, then again showcased his clinical eye for goal by finishing a superb counter as Dortmund attacked from their own goal. Coach Lucien Favre banked on youth by starting two 17-year-olds in Reyna and England Under-21 midfielder Jude Bellingham, who made his league debut, with Sancho and Haaland, both 20, leading Dortmund's attack. Reyna, making just his third league start, paid back the faith by scoring the opening goal and winning the penalty Haaland converted. Reyna drilled home Bellingham's superb pass from a tight ankle on 34 minutes, then had his ankle clipped after a darting run into the area to win the penalty for Haaland. Sancho tried to convince Haaland to let him take the spot-kick, but ""I was confident whoever took it, would score, which is the most important thing"" said Reyna. Haaland then stole the show with a stunning end-to-end sprint to support Sancho's break before crashing home Dortmund's third goal on 78 minutes. The towering Norwegian, the first player in Bundesliga history to score a hat-trick from the bench, now has 18 goals in 20 games for Dortmund since his arrival in January. For the first time since March, some German league clubs were able to welcome back limited numbers of fans, depending on permission from local health authorities. The biggest crowd of the day was in Dortmund, as 9,300 cheered the impressive home win. ""It's amazing to have fans back, they support us so much,"" added Reyna. Having finished runners-up to Bayern for the last two seasons, Dortmund are on a collision course with the European champions who they meet in the German Super Cup showdown on September 30 in Munich. Earlier, Hertha Berlin's new-signing Jhon Cordoba scored on his debut in a 4-1 away romp at Werder Bremen as the ambitious capital city club also threw down an early marker. In front of 8,500 in Bremen, Hertha defender Peter Pekarik and Belgian-born winger Dodi Lukebakio scored quick-fire goals at the end of the first half to leave Werder 2-0 down at the break and the hosts were whistled off the pitch by their own fans. Colombia striker Cordoba, signed from Cologne in mid-week, came on to start the move which Brazil Under-23 forward Matheus Cunha finished as Hertha went 3-0 up with an hour gone. Davie Selke scored Bremen's second-half consolation goal before Cordoba capped his debut by tucking home Hertha's fourth goal on 90 minutes. Just like Bayern, Cologne also had to play behind closed doors due to a rising rate of infection for their 3-2 home defeat to Hoffenheim, for whom Andrej Kramaric scored a hat-trick. The Croatia striker put the visitors ahead after three minutes following a mix up in defence, netted a penalty and smashed home the winning goal in added time after Cologne had launched a late fight back. In the capital, playmaker Michael Gregoritsch and winger Andre Hahn scored late goals as Augsburg beat hosts Union Berlin 3-1 in front of 4,600 fans. Newly-promoted Arminia Bielefeld earned a point with a 1-1 draw at Eintracht Frankfurt on their return to the top flight in front of 6,500. Stuttgart, who also came up, gave Freiburg a scare with late goals by Sasa Kalajdzic and Silas Wamangituka as they fought back in a 3-2 defeat in front of 8,000."
37,18/09/2020,23:19,Gnabry hits hat-trick as 'hungry' Bayern run riot in historic Bundesliga opener,Leroy Sane said all-conquering Bayern Munich crave even more silverware after the Germany winger scored on his debut in Friday's historic 8-0 thrashing of Schalke in the opening game of the new Bundesliga season.,"""We're still hungry, even though we won the treble last season,"" said Sane after creating two goals for Serge Gnabry, who claimed a hat-trick in the goalfest at the Allianz Arena. ""Winning our first game at home 8-0 is obviously super. ""It felt really, really good finally to be able to play with the lads,"" said Sane, who spent most of last season sidelined at former club Manchester City after tearing knee ligaments at the very start of last season. ""It's been a very good day with lots of goals."" Just 26 days after winning the Champions League final, Bayern picked up where they left off last season with their 22nd-straight win. ""It is amazing how the team has built on the performance of the past season,"" said Bayern board member and former club captain Oliver Kahn. The jaw-dropping result is the highest win in an opening game of a new Bundesliga season - five weeks to the day after Bayern's 8-2 thrashing of Barcelona in the quarter-finals of the Champions League. Leon Goretzka, Thomas Mueller and Robert Lewandowksi also netted, while England junior international Jamal Musiala, 17, became the youngest Bayern goal-scorer in the Bundesliga when he came on late. Bayern had to brush off setbacks in the days leading up to kick-off. On Thursday, the Mayor of Munich scuppered plans to allow 7,500 fans into the Allianz Arena, due to rising new cases of the coronavirus in the Bavarian capital, hours after Bayern confirmed the sale of Thiago Alcantara to Liverpool. Before kick-off, David Alaba, who is stalling over signing a contract extension with a year left to go, dropped out with a leg injury. However, Bayern picked up where they left off 26 days after winning the Champions League final in Lisbon. Cash-strapped Schalke continued their miserable finish to last season as David Wagner's side have now gone 17 games without a win. Gnabry opened the scoring with just four minutes gone with a great piece of finishing which gave Schalke goalkeeper Ralf Faehrmann no chance. Burly central midfielder Goretzka grabbed the second against his former club when he hit the bottom corner from the edge of the box on 19 minutes. Lewandowski, the Bundesliga's top scorer last season with 34 goals, opened his account for 2020/21 with half an hour gone. He netted a penalty after being brought down in the area by Schalke defender Ozan Kabak, who has been linked to a move to Liverpool. Incredibly, Lewandowski has now scored in each of his last 10 games against Schalke, dating back to April 2016, including a hat-trick in last August's 3-0 win over the Royal Blues in Gelsenkirchen. It was 3-0 at half-time, but Gnabry grabbed his second two minutes after the break when he fired into an empty net after a sprint by Sane pulled Faehrmann out of position. The pair combined again when Sane chested the ball down after getting in behind the defence and rolled the ball off to the waiting Gnabry to claim his hat-trick just before the hour mark. Mueller added the sixth on 69 minutes after Lewandowski had again cut Schalke's defence to shreds. The records were sent tumbling as Sane marked his debut with the seventh on 71 minutes when he sprinted onto Joshua Kimmich's superb pass and fired home with Lewandowski unmarked outside him. Musiala, who only turned 17 in February, became the club's youngest scorer in the Bundesliga when he darted in from the left wing to add the eighth on 81 minutes."
38,17/09/2020,15:03,Bayern Munich told to start league season behind closed doors,"Bayern Munich must kick off the new Bundesliga season behind closed doors because of a rising coronavirus infection rate in the Bavarian capital, city officials said on Thursday.","The decision puts an end the European champions' plans to allow 7,500 fans into the Allianz Arena to watch Friday's opening game at home to Schalke. ""It would be the wrong signal to let spectators into sports stadiums against the background of the current figures,"" said Munich mayor Dieter Reiter. Germany's politicians have given Bundesliga clubs the green light to allow the partial return of fans into stadiums, providing the rate of infection in each region remains below 35 per 100,000 inhabitants. However, the figure for Munich was revised to 47.6 per 100,000 on Thursday. While the defending champions must kick off without fans, set numbers of spectators are expected to attend other Bundesliga matches on the opening weekend of the league season. Reiter said he could understand the frustration of the club and Bayern's fans, but ""for me, this high number means that we at least have to think about much more drastic restrictions in public life. ""I can't let thousands of fans into the stadiums at the same time."" Bayern head coach Hansi Flick accepted the news as they start their quest to win their ninth Bundesliga title in a row. ""I've always said I'm in favour of keeping an eye on things,"" Flick told reporters on Thursday. ""We have to protect ourselves and make the best of the situation. ""You have to take the numbers into account. These are things that I can't do anything about, we have to be prepared for them."""
39,21/08/2020,17:25,Bayern insist on opening new Bundesliga season,Champions League finalists and Bundesliga title holders Bayern Munich on Friday waived the German league's offer to delay their start to the 2020/21 domestic season by insisting they keep with tradition and host the opening game.,"Bayern face Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions League final on Sunday in Lisbon to end the current term which has been affected by the coronavirus pandemic. The German Football League (DFL) had initially offered to push back Bayern's start to the new campaign until Monday September 21 in order to allow the Bavarians extra time to prepare. However, the DFL said Bayern, who won an eighth straight title last season, want to keep with the tradition, established in 2002, by hosting the opening game. As a result Bayern will play Schalke at Munich's Allianz Arena on Friday September 18. ""Bayern Munich have stated their wish to contest the season opener in keeping with the tradition and to do so without any additional preparation time,"" said a DFL statement. Originally, the DFL had pencilled in last season's runners-up Borussia Dortmund and fourth-placed Borussia Moenchengladbach to replace Bayern against Schalke as the opening game. Now Dortmund and Gladbach, who have both qualified for the Champions League, are scheduled to meet as the top game on Saturday, September 19. Opening day fixtures (all times 1330 GMT unless stated) Friday 18 September Bayern Muenchen v Schalke (1830) Saturday 19 September Eintracht Frankfurt v Arminia Bielefeld, Union Berlin v Augsburg, Cologne v Hoffenheim, Werder Bremen v Hertha Berlin, Stuttgart v Freiburg, Borussia Dortmund v Borussia Moenchengladbach (1630) Sunday 20 September RB Leipzig v Mainz, Wolfsburg v Bayer Leverkusen (1600)"

However, the match could be moved to Monday September 21 if Bayern reach the Champions League final in Lisbon on August 23, to allow Hansi Flick's star-studded squad a month between matches. Bayern host Chelsea in the last 16, return leg of the Champions League this Saturday holding a 3-0 lead from February's first leg and are among the favourites for the European title. Due to the coronavirus pandemic, the start of the 2020/21 season in Germany has been pushed back from the original date of August 21. The German Super Cup, traditionally the season's curtain-raiser, has been moved to September 30 when Bayern will play Borussia Dortmund. This week, the clubs in Germany's top two divisions agreed to the league's four-point plan to allow the partial return of fans next season, which must still be approved by politicians. A small number of fans would be allowed to sit, tickets would be personalised so spectators could be traced, alcohol at matches would be banned until October and there will be no away fans before the end of the year."

43,01/07/2020,16:22,Schalke admit to needing 'massive savings' to survive,"Following the resignation of their billionaire backer, cash-strapped Bundesliga club Schalke admitted Wednesday they must make ""massive savings"" in order to survive after their struggling finances were further hit by the coronavirus pandemic.","""Today is a turning point for Schalke. There cannot be a continuation of the current situation,"" admitted board member Alexander Jobst. Jobst insists ""massive savings"" must be made, the ""stop button"" has been pressed in many areas of the club's finances and Schalke's ""sporting goals"" must be adjusted in the coming seasons. ""In the past months, Schalke 04 has presented a miserable public image,"" he said, apologising for ""mistakes we made which must not happen again in the future"". ""We know that we have gambled away trust and scared the fans,"" he added. Schalke are one of Germany's biggest clubs, yet even before the COVID-19 pandemic hit Europe in March they already had debts of 197 million euros ($220 million), which Jobst warned at the time threatened their existence. Magazine Kicker has claimed the pandemic would leave a third of the clubs in the country's top two tiers fighting for survival. When German football restarted behind closed doors in May after a two-month hiatus, Schalke lost two million euros in revenue for each of their four home games without fans. Their financial problems were exacerbated in recent years by missing out on lucrative Champions League qualification in three of the last four seasons. Last Saturday, they finished this season with a new club record of 16 games without a win following a 4-0 drubbing at Freiburg. Tuesday's resignation of wealthy club chairman Clemens Toennies after 19 years in charge following protests by supporters has left the club reeling. A week after the head of finances walked away, Toennies also quit with fans furious about his running of the club. Away from football, the billionaire meat manufacturer was already under fire over conditions at his factory, which led to an outbreak of 15,000 cases of the coronavirus. The 64-year-old had also made an embattled start to last season, voluntarily stepping back for three months as Schalke chairman over allegedly racist comments he made in August. In the meantime, Schalke has reportedly secured 40 million-euro guarantee from its home state of North Rhine-Westphalia to help the club survive. ""We are subject to a secrecy period, which we will comply with,"" Jobst said Wednesday, without denying the reports. Moving forward, Schalke head coach David Wagner says he now expects to ""have to put together a powerful squad with a small budget"" for next season. On Sunday, Munich's Sueddeutsche Zeitung said Schalke are looking to bring in a 2.5 million-euro annual salary cap for future player contracts. Sports director Jochen Schneider painted a bleak picture, adding ""we can no longer bet on the future"". For next season, Schalke have already lost two of their best players. Goalkeeper Alexander Nuebel has joined Bayern Munich on a free transfer, while right-back Jonjoe Kenny, who was on loan from Everton, has returned to England."
44,09/03/2020,14:50,"African players in Europe: Salah, Mane rescue Liverpool","Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mane were the African stars in Europe at the weekend, with both scoring as Premier League leaders Liverpool snapped a mini all-competitions slump by beating Bournemouth 2-1 at Anfield.","Reigning African Footballer of the Year Mane netted the winner after Salah cancelled out an early opener for the relegation-threatened visitors. In Germany, Moroccan Achraf Hakimi grabbed the decisive goal for Bundesliga title challengers Borussia Dortmund in a 2-1 victory over Borussia Moenchengladbach. SADIO MANE/MOHAMED SALAH (Liverpool) Mane and Salah got Liverpool back to winning ways with both on target in a 2-1 win over Bournemouth. Egyptian Salah marked his 100th Premier League game for the Reds with his 70th goal courtesy of a trademark low left-foot finish from Mane's pass. The Senegalese then calmly slotted home his 18th goal of the season to move Liverpool to within six points of the title. JORDAN AYEW (Crystal Palace) Ayew's blistering strike from outside the area earned Palace a 1-0 win over Watford and ensured the Ghana international his best goal tally for a Premier League season with eight. ACHRAF HAKIMI (Borussia Dortmund) Hakimi was crucial for Borussia Dortmund against Borussia Moenchengladbach, scoring the winner in a 2-1 victory that kept his side in touch with Bundesliga leaders Bayern Munich. He was in the right place at the right time to collect Jadon Sancho's assist and guide the ball past Yann Sommer in the 71st minute. It was his third Bundesliga goal of the season as Dortmund moved within four points of Bayern. AMINE HARIT (Schalke) Harit came off the bench in Schalke's 1-1 home draw against Hoffenheim as the Royal Blues went for a killer blow. While his speed was noticeable against a tiring Hoffenheim defence, he was unable to add to his six goals or four assists this season. JOSH MAJA (BORDEAUX) England-born Nigerian international Maja scored his eighth goal of the season as Bordeaux drew 1-1 at Saint-Etienne. The 21-year-old former Sunderland forward met a loose ball inside the box to fire a low shot into the net. JOHN BOYE (METZ) The experienced Ghana centre-back scored a late winner as Metz claimed a crucial 2-1 win over struggling Nimes to move seven points clear of the Ligue 1 bottom three. The 32-year-old Boye, capped 67 times by Ghana, netted in the 81st minute, having also scored the winner against Strasbourg in January."
45,06/03/2020,03:35,Irate fans could provide more Bundesliga banner headlines,When Hoffenheim kick off at Schalke in the Bundesliga on Saturday many eyes will be on the fans behind the goals rather than the players on the field.,"Last week, away to Hoffenheim, Bayern fans unveiled a banner with 17 minutes to go which halted the match. When the players returned, they played keep-ball for the rest of the game, which hardly mattered as league leaders Bayern were six goals up. The key word in the banner was the German for ""son of a bitch"" which has become a code for Dietmar Hopp, Hoffenheim's 79-year-old billionaire owner. The majority of Bundesliga clubs are, in theory, fan owned and supporters are hostile to the rich owners who have transformed English, French and Italian football. Bayern fans were showing support for the ultras at their great rival Borussia Dortmund, who used the inflammatory phrase to describe Hopp and were then banned by the German football federation (DFB) from travelling to games away at Hoffenheim. Banners insulting Hopp and criticising the DFB for attacking terrace culture were also unveiled by Cologne and Union Berlin fans. The latter led to their game against Wolfsburg being interrupted. The previous week, the match between Borussia Moenchengladach and Hoffenheim was halted when home fans unveiled a banner showing Hopp in rifle crosshairs. On Wednesday, when Schalke hosted Bayern in the German Cup, home fans unfurled a banner asking their opponents if they tried the same insult ""will you stop playing so we'll get a penalty shootout?"" Bayern won 1-0. Fans of second-division Bochum, a neighbour of both Schalke and Dortmund, moved the debate in a fresh direction in their draw with Sandhausen. After Arsenal loanee Jordi Osei-Tuti scored they revealed a banner that said: ""A son of a bitch is insulted: all of Germany is shocked - Racism on a daily basis: nothing happens."" In February, Hertha's Jordan Torunarigha was sent off after throwing bottles in rage after being racially abused in a German cup game, at Schalke. On its website, explaining to Hoffenheim fans, who have chanted their support for their owner with often robust language, how to get to Veltins Arena, Schalke made clear banners would be allowed. ""Fans do not require permission to bring flags with a pole that is up to two metres in length or fence banners."" Schalke are enduring another season of unfulfilled promised, mired in sixth but already 10 points off the Champions League places. Hoffenheim are two points and two places further back, heights that would have been unthinkable 15 years ago. Many will be anticipating the banners more than the mid-table action. Borussia Dortmund have won four games in a row while conceding just one goal - scored by Neymar. They warm up for the return against Paris Saint-Germain with a potentially pivotal visit to Moenchengladbach. Dortmund are third in the Bundesliga and 'Gladbach are just behind in fourth. Last weekend, with one teenage sensation, Erling Braut Haaland, ill and on the bench against Freiburg, Jadon Sancho hit the only goal, scoring for the seventh straight home game and the 11th time in 13 games. At a club which only lists two strikers - Haaland and Marco Reus - the contribution of the English winger, who is Dortmund's league leader in goals and assists (14 in both), remains crucial. 8 - Bayern's unbeaten run, including 7 wins, since the winter break 6 - Goals Bayern scored in 73 minutes in their first game without Robert Lewandowski 22 - Goals Augsburg, Bayern's opponents, have conceded in last eight games"
46,20/10/2019,20:36,Schalke blow chance to top Bundesliga as Kramaric strikes on return,Schalke blew their chance to move to the top of the Bundesliga on Sunday as Andrej Kramaric scored on his first appearance of the season in Hoffenheim's 2-0 victory.,"David Wagner's side would have moved above the likes of champions Bayern Munich and leaders Borussia Moenchengladbach with three points at the PreZero Arena. Schalke's influential young midfielders Suat Serdar and Weston McKennie, who scored the United States' quickest ever hat-trick earlier this month, missed the match with injuries. Croatia's Kramaric, who was a World Cup runner-up last year, opened the scoring in the 72nd minute having missed the start of the campaign with a knee injury. ""It was a special moment after five months to play again, to take the first steps in the field and then score a goal, that's an absolutely incredible feeling,"" Kramaric told Hoffenheim's website. ""I have to be honest, Schalke were the better team, but we still managed to win,"" he added. Togo international Ihlas Bebou made sure of the win with five minutes remaining. Hoffenheim followed up their 2-1 victory over Bayern before the international window to go level on 11 points with Hertha Berlin in 11th place. Kramaric's effort came after substitute Bebou's shot was parried poorly by the hosts' goalkeeper Alexander Nubel. Bebou then beat Nubel at his near-post to claim his second goal of the season. Earlier on Sunday Cologne moved out of the relegation places with a 3-0 defeat of bottom-placed Paderborn. Simon Terodde netted after nine minutes before Louis Schaub and Sebastiaan Bornauw helped Cologne to their first home three points of the campaign. Paderborn remain last with only one point from their first eight games of the season. On Saturday, leaders Moenchengladbach lost 1-0 to Borussia Dortmund, who dropped England's Jadon Sancho for returning late from international duty, and Bayern drew 2-2 at Augsburg."
47,28/09/2019,21:00,Lewandowski hailed for 'extreme goals quota' as Bayern go top,"Record-breaking Bayern Munich striker Robert Lewandowski was hailed for his ""extreme quota of goals"" on Saturday as the defending German champions warmed up for their European duel against Tottenham with a nervy win at strugglers Paderborn which took them to the top of the Bundesliga.","Lewandowski became the first player in Bundesliga history to score 10 goals in the first six games to seala 3-2 victory at bottom club Paderborn. While Bayern squeezed past Paderborn, Leipzig were shocked 3-1 at home to Schalke to surrender top spot. Bayern took full advantage to claim first place before Tuesday's key Champions League clash at Spurs, but not before conceding two second-half goals. Philippe Coutinho, who is rebooting his career on loan in Munich after an unhappy stint at Barcelona, played a key role by setting up Serge Gnabry's opening goal with a sublime first-half pass. Having scored his first Bayern goal the week before in a rout of Cologne, the Brazilian playmaker tapped home Gnabry's neat pass after the break before substitute Kai Proeger pulled a goal back for Paderborn. With time almost up, Lewandowski showed great finishing prowess to put away a Niklas Suele pass and make it 3-1, becoming the first Bayern player to score in each of the first six matches of the season. He is also the first Bundesliga player to reach 10 goals after the first six games. ""It's an extreme quota, which helps when they decide games like that,"" said midfielder Joshua Kimmich of Lewandowski's goal haul. ""To have ten already is something else."" There were, however, nervous looks in Bayern's ranks during the final ten minutes after Paderborn defender Jamilu Collins beat Germany goalkeeper Manuel Neuer from 30 metres out. ""We didn't finish them off,"" admitted Gnabry. ""In the second half, we had so many goal opportunities to decide the game, but our finishing was missing. ""Tottenham will be a completely different game and, of course, we must improve, but I think we can do well there."" In Leipzig, Morocco international midfielder Amine Harit inspired Schalke to an impressive away win, winning and drilling home a penalty, then setting up a first Bundesliga goal for Welsh teenager Rabbi Matondo. The Royal Blues raced into a 2-0 lead with first-half goals as Senegalese centre-back Salif Sane headed home from a corner on 29 minutes before Harit's penalty. The referee took a long look at the replays after Harit went down after the faintest of contact from Mali defender Amadou Haidara. Schalke, under ex-Huddersfield coach David Wagner, made sure of the three points when Matondo claimed his first Bundesliga goal since joining from Manchester City. Harit again did the damage, punishing a mistake in midfield then putting in a well-timed pass which sent Liverpool-born Matondo away to fire home on 58 minutes. Emil Forsberg's consolation goal came too late for Leipzig. The shock result shook up the table with Bayern now top, Leipzig drop to second and Schalke jumped from fifth to third. Questions about Borussia Dortmund's mentality will again be raised after more defensive lapses in their 2-2 draw at home to Werder Bremen left them seventh. Milot Rashica gave Bremen an early lead at Signal Iduna Park, but Germany pair Mario Goetze and Marco Reus both scored with headers to put Dortmund 2-1 up at half-time. However, Werder claimed a point when Marco Friedl poked the ball home ten minutes into the second half. The disappointing draw comes after Dortmund skipper Reus was left fuming after his side leaked a late own goal in last Sunday's 2-2 at mid-table Eintracht Frankfurt. ""We should have had a third goal and conceding their final goal really hurts. We didn't play well,"" said Reus after the Bremen defeat. Borussia Moenchengladbach went fourth as goals from French strikers Alassane Plea and Marcus Thuram sealed a 2-0 victory at Hoffenheim. Bayer Leverkusen are just behind them in fifth thanks to late goals from forwards Kevin Volland and Kai Havertz that added to a Florian Niederlechner's first half own goal in a 3-0 win at Augsburg."

After a difficult 2018/19 season, overshadowed by injury and his involvement in a car accident in Morocco which left a man dead, Harit scored the winner and set up the other goal in Schalke's 2-1 win over Mainz last Friday. Harit, who was born in France, started his career at Nantes and played for the French Under-21s before opting for Morocco in 2017, the year he joined Schalke, for whom he also scored twice in their 5-1 demolition of Paderborn a fortnight ago. Nagelsmann credits ex-Huddersfield boss Wagner, in his first season in charge of Gelsenkirchen-based Schalke, with the rebooting of Harit's career. ""I think it's an outstanding indication of the class of David Wagner as a coach,"" said Nagelsmann, who praised the Schalke boss for harnessing the talent of ""a difficult player"", previously considered an ""enfant terrible"". ""However, this is a very, very good Bundesliga player, who David has put back on track,"" said Nagelsmann. The 32-year-old has issued ""special"" instructions to his defenders on how to contain Harit, ""which I won't give away"" and expects a tough tussle. ""They (Schalke) are a team with the most sprints and their individual players move a lot,"" said Nagelsmann. ""You can already tell that they work a lot and defend extremely well, especially in the first 65 minutes."" Leipzig top the Bundesliga and host Lyon in the Champions League on Wednesday having already earned a 2-1 win at Benfica 10 days ago, thanks to both goals by Germany striker Timo Werner. However, it's too early for any talk about them ending Bayern Munich's run of seven straight German league titles. ""It is clear that we will not start putting out the bunting at Leipzig's town hall on the fifth match day,"" said Nagelsmann, pointing out that Schalke have only three points fewer ""and strangely enough, they aren't being treated as title hopes""."

The Moroccan international won the match for the hosts when he collected the ball and darted towards goal before curling home a spectacular winner with the outside of his boot into the bottom corner. Harit was also the architect of Schalke's opener, playing a perfect pass into Suat Serdar's path before the German smashed home in the 36th minute. The defeat was tough on Mainz, who remain third-from-bottom despite Karim Onisiwo grabbing the away side a deserved leveller 14 minutes before Harit snatched the three points. Mainz are in the relegation play-off place after losing for the fourth time in five matches."

""It's a new season, and I can only ask the boys to look forward,"" said Wagner. Goalkeeper Alexander Nuebel said that new coach Wagner had ""cleared the heads"" of the Schalke players. ""We are playing much more freely now,"" he told Sky. Brazilian midfielder Cauly gave Paderborn an early lead, picking out the top corner with a looping header to celebrate his 24th birthday with a goal. Schalke were then denied several times by Paderborn keeper Jannik Huth before Salif Sane headed them level on 33 minutes. Suat Serdar completed the turnaround just after the break, firing in a loose ball at the edge of the area to put Schalke ahead. English full-back Jonjoe Kenny set up the third with a marauding run from deep, eventually cutting the ball back for Harit to slot it into the bottom corner. Ahmed Kutucu added a fourth on the counter-attack seven minutes from time, before setting up Harit minutes later to complete the rout. Earlier on Sunday, Freiburg midfielder Janik Haberer hailed a ""great day"" for the Bundesliga minnows as they beat neighbours Hoffenheim 3-0 to continue their dream start to the season. ""It is a great day for us and our fans, it is always special to win a derby,"" said Haberer, who joined Nils Petersen and Christian Guenter on the scoresheet. The win leaves Freiburg in third and sees them leapfrog perennial champions Bayern Munich, who were held to a 1-1 draw at league leaders RB Leipzig on Saturday. Freiburg were ruthless in the first half and deserved their two-goal lead at the break. Guenter swept in the opener after a darting run in from the left wing on 11 minutes, and Petersen had a goal ruled out for offside shortly before the half-hour mark. Haberer doubled the lead on 38 minutes, picking out the bottom corner brilliantly from the edge of the area. Hoffenheim, who had shown only flashes of danger in the first half, were caught napping when an unmarked Petersen poached the third goal on the hour. Christian Streich's side have now won three of their opening four games, with only Bayern and Borussia Dortmund having scored more goals so far. ""Our primary goal is still just to avoid relegation, but it is a great feeling to be so high up the table,"" Haberer told Sky."

Robert Lewandowski scored his sixth of the season in just three games, while Benjamin Pavard, David Alaba, Kingsley Coman and Alphonso Davies also scored. Mainz took a shock early lead when Jean-Paul Boetius finished a superb sixth-minute counter attack, giving the visitors hope that they might be able to pick up their first point of the season. However Pavard equalised for the hosts half-an-hour later through an expertly taken volley which recalled his stunning 2018 World Cup strike against Argentina. Alaba gave Bayern the lead with a brilliantly taken free kick just before the break, and the rout was completed in the second half. The win sees Bayern move up the table to equal second, behind leaders RB Leipzig whose 3-1 win over Borussia Moenchengladbach on Friday means they have won three out of three. In Freiburg, Cologne's Ellyes Skhiri scored the winner in second-half injury time to secure the visitors a 2-1 victory. Freiburg hit the lead in the 40th minute through an own goal by Rafael Czichos, before Cologne fan favourite Anthony Modeste equalised in the 52nd minute. Schalke picked up their first win of the season over a disappointing Hertha Berlin at Gelsenkirchen's Veltins Arena. Berlin scored own goals either side of half time through Niklas Stark and Karim Rekik. English defender Jonjoe Kenny added a third in the 86th minute to make it 3-0 -- the first goal by a Schalke player this season -- to put the game beyond doubt. Wolfsburg and Paderborn fought out a firey 1-1 draw at the Volkswagen Arena. Newly-promoted Paderborn went ahead through Cauly Souza in the 12th minute, before Josip Brekalo equalised in the 56th minute. At the BayArena, visitors Hoffenheim ended Bayer Leverkusen's 100 per cent start to the season as the sides fought out a 0-0 draw. The visitors had to endure a six-minute spell of injury time but held firm against a luckless Leverkusen attack. While Leipzig's win over Gladbach saw them secure outright first on the table, Dortmund have the chance to snatch it back when they take on Union Berlin later on Saturday."
52,24/08/2019,20:47,Lewandowski hits hat-trick as 'happy' Coutinho makes Bayern bow,"Hat-trick hero Robert Lewandowski hailed the strength of Bayern Munich's squad after securing a 3-0 victory over Schalke on Saturday, as new signing Philippe Coutinho made his Bundesliga debut for the German giants.","""Our squad is optimal now. We brought two good players on in the second half today, and we need that because we play a lot of games over the season,"" Lewandowski told Sky. Coutinho, on loan from Barcelona, replaced Thomas Mueller in the 57th minute, coming on alongside fellow debutant Ivan Perisic with Bayern already two goals up. ""I am very happy to be here. The football here is very intense, and I have only been here for three or four days, so I need to work hard,"" Coutinho told Sky. Bayern, who have not lost to Schalke in the league since 2010, took the lead from a penalty on 20 minutes. English right-back Jonjoe Kenny, on loan to Schalke from Everton, clattered into the back of Kingsley Coman, and Lewandowski slotted home from 12 yards to score against Schalke for the ninth game in a row. The Polish striker then curled in a spectacular free-kick to double the lead just after half-time. A resurgent Schalke had several handball penalty appeals turned down as Bayern struggled to maintain control in the second half. Yet Lewandowski killed the game off 15 minutes from time, slipping away from marker Salif Sane to complete the seventh Bundesliga hat-trick of his career. ""The expectations are always growing, but I always try to get better,"" said Lewandowski. Everton loanee Kenny was not the only unfortunate Englishman on Saturday, as an own-goal from youth international Lewis Baker sent Bayer Leverkusen on their way to a 3-1 win over Fortuna Duesseldorf earlier in the day. Chelsea loanee Baker turned a Kevin Volland cross into his own net after just six minutes. Charles Aranguiz and Karim Bellarabi added two more in a stylish first-half performance from Champions League qualifiers Leverkusen. Yet Volland bemoaned his side's lapse in concentration after Alfredo Morales grabbed a consolation goal for Duesseldorf. ""We deserved to win but we are not at 100 percent. Otherwise we would have kept a clean sheet,"" he said. Werder Bremen still have no points from their opening two games after they lost a five-goal thriller to Hoffenheim. The home side looked comfortable after second-half goals from Ermin Bicakcic and Ihlas Bebou had cancelled out Niclas Fuellkrug's opener and Bremen had a player sent off. Yet Yuya Osako drew the visitors level with a slaloming run and fine finish before Pavel Kaderabek's header three minutes from time sealed a 3-2 win for Hoffenheim. New Borussia Moenchengladbach boss Marco Rose celebrated his first three points as goals from Stefan Lainer, Alassane Plea and Breel Embolo saw his side come from behind to beat Mainz 3-1. Freiburg, who thrashed Mainz 3-0 last weekend, picked up a second win in two as they beat promoted side Paderborn 3-1. Goals from Luca Waldschmidt, Nils Petersen and South Korea's Chang-Hoon Kwon secured the win after Streli Mamba had given Paderborn an early lead. Sebastian Andersson scored Union Berlin's first ever Bundesliga goal, cancelling out Ruben Vargas' opener to secure a 1-1 draw with his late equaliser at Augsburg."
53,23/08/2019,04:30,New signings in the spotlight as Bayern look to reboot,New loan signings Ivan Perisic and Philippe Coutinho both hope to make their Bundesliga debuts as champions Bayern Munich attempt to reboot a rocky start to the season at Schalke on Saturday.,"Perisic and Coutinho, both of whom arrived in Munich on loan this month, will be in the squad for the first time as Bayern look to pick up their first win of the new season against David Wagner's Schalke. Coutinho, 27, has been the talk of Germany since Bayern announced his arrival on a one-year loan deal from Barcelona last week. Bayern sporting director Hasan Salihamidzic said the Brazilian would provide ""a touch of the spectacular"", and hopes the former Liverpool player can sprinkle some much-needed stardust on the German top-flight. ""Coutinho is an absolutely world-class player. We should all be happy that he is in the Bundesliga,"" former Bayern and Liverpool midfielder Dietmar Hamann told Sky. Bayern announced record engagement figures on their social media accounts following Coutinho's arrival on Monday, but fans may have to wait to see the Brazilian star in action. Coach Niko Kovac confirmed on Thursday Coutinho was not yet fit enough to play the full 90 minutes, and would start on the bench against Schalke. ""I know a lot of people want us to play him straight away, but everything needs to be right,"" said Kovac. The Croatian coach said his compatriot Perisic had better chances of making a first start for Bayern on Sunday. ""Ivan is an option, also for the starting eleven. He is at a higher level of fitness than Philippe,"" said Kovac. Perisic, 30, joined Bayern on a one-year loan from Inter Milan earlier this month, but was forced to sit out the season opener against Hertha Berlin due to a suspension carried over from Serie A. That game confirmed a bumpy start to the new season for Bayern, as they were held to a 2-2 draw and immediately slipped two points behind title rivals Dortmund, who had beaten them in the German Supercup two weeks previously. Under pressure to pick up three points in Gelsenkirchen on Saturday, Kovac warned his side would have to fight against a new-look Schalke led by former Huddersfield boss Wagner. ""It's the first home game for the new coach so they will be motivated,"" said Kovac. ""Huddersfield were one of the teams we used to study. We can expect good defending, good transitions and aggression this weekend."" Bayern will be without the injured Leon Goretzka, while Jerome Boateng and Jann-Fiete Arp are absent due to illness. Dortmund, meanwhile, will welcome back first-choice goalkeeper Roman Buerki when they travel to promoted side Cologne on Friday evening. Buerki, who missed the first three competitive games of the season with an ankle injury, returns to a team still buzzing from their 5-1 mauling of Augsburg in last week's league opener. Yet coach Lucien Favre warned Cologne would be a tougher nut to crack, saying that Friday's opponents would be ""more ready than Augsburg were."" Two of Germany's representatives in European competitions will meet on Sunday as RB Leipzig host Eintracht Frankfurt, while last year's fourth-placed team Bayer Leverkusen hope to build on their opening day win when they visit Fortuna Duesseldorf on Saturday.

54,10/08/2019,19:22,'Lost our heads': Mainz and Augsburg suffer shock German Cup defeats,Mainz were one of two Bundesliga sides to be dumped out of the German Cup in Saturday's first round after falling to a 2-0 derby defeat at Kaiserslautern.,"Midfielder Florian Pick sealed a sensational win for third-tier Kaiserslautern with a 90th minute strike after Manfred Starke's penalty had given them the lead on 63 minutes. ""We lost our heads after we went behind,"" said Mainz midfielder Daniel Brosinski. Four-time German champions Kaiserslautern were not the only giant-killers on Saturday however, with fourth-tier side SC Verl humbling Bundesliga outfit Augsburg with a deserved 2-1 win. Augsburg's defence looked helpless in the first half as an own-goal from Marek Suchy and a well-worked goal from Ron Schallenberg gave Verl a shock 2-0 lead. Andre Hahn's 83rd minute penalty proved to be little more than a consolation effort. ""Verl deserved to win and we have a lot of work to do before we play Dortmund next weekend,"" said Augsburg coach Martin Schmidt. Elsewhere, Fortuna Duesseldorf came from behind to survive a scare against fifth-tier side Villingen. Rouwen Hennings and 18-year-old Ghanaian Kevin Ofori sealed the win in extra-time for Duesseldorf after Nana Ampomah had cancelled out Steven Ukoh's first-half penalty. Hoffenheim also had a narrow escape after twice throwing away the lead against third-division club Wuerzburger Kickers. Goals from Ihlas Bebou and Pawel Kaderabek left Hoffenheim with one foot in the second round before two goals in seven minutes from Fabio Kaufmann and Albion Vrenezi brought Wuerzburg level. Adam Szalai restored Hoffenheim's lead in extra-time, only for Luca Pfeiffer to make it 3-3 with a late header. The underdogs finally succumbed in the penalty shootout, Oliver Baumann saving twice to send Hoffenheim into the second round. Schalke fans used their 5-0 victory over Drochtersen/Assel to protest against chairman Clemens Toennies, who has temporarily stepped down over a racism scandal earlier this month. Supporters held up banners reading ""Toennies out"" before watching their side cruise into the second round thanks to goals from Steven Skrzybski, Guido Burgstaller, Munir Mercan and Daniel Caligiuri. Bayer Leverkusen also progressed, beating fourth-tier Alemannia Aachen 4-1, Peter Hackenberg's own-goal and strikes from Kevin Volland, Leon Bailey and Kai Havertz saw Leverkusen sail into the next round. An extra-time goal from Luca Waldschmidt saw Freiburg beat third-tier Magdeburg, while a Claudio Pizarro brace helped Werder Bremen thrash amateur neighbours Atlas Delmenhorst 6-1. Tom Schmidt, a bank clerk who sells self-printed t-shirts on the internet, made Delmenhorst club history with his first half strike, but goals from Pizarro, Yuya Osako, Niklas Moisander, Milot Rashica and Davy Klaassen saw Werder to a victory. Second division sides Dynamo Dresden, Heidenheim, Bochum, Erzgebirge Aue and Arminia Bielefeld all knocked out lower league opposition."
55,07/08/2019,15:52,Schalke boss steps down for three months following 'racist' slur,Clemens Toennies has stepped down for three months as chairman of German Bundesliga club Schalke following widespread condemnation of alleged 'racist' comments he made last week.,"The club's five-strong ethics committee, in a statement late Tuesday, said Toennies had ""violated the ban on discrimination contained in the club's statutes"" after a lengthy meeting in which Toennies had to explain himself. The club said Toennies had decided to step down as a member and chair of the supervisory board for three months. ""He admitted the violation at the meeting on Tuesday and expressed his regret once again,"" said the panel in a statement. However, the body dismissed the accusation of racism as ""unfounded"" and avoided the heavier sanction of firing him. The 63-year-old has been sharply criticised for saying more power stations should be built in Africa, ""then Africans would stop felling trees and producing children when it gets dark"". The billionaire businessman, who employs 16,500 people and has assets estimated by Forbes at around 2.2 billion euros ($2.5 billion), made the remark at a forum in Paderborn last Thursday while criticising tax increases to fight climate change. On social media, numerous Schalke fans demanded Toennies resignation, while senior figures in German football and politics have condemned his comment. Some Schalke fans have handed back their membership cards in protest. ""The decision brings clarity and some peace. But what will happen in the three months?"" Susanne Franke, chair of a Schalke Fan Initiative, told Sky Sports News. ""There will be protests if things stay as they are."" Politician Dagmar Freitag, chairwoman of the sports committee in Germany's parliament, the Bundestag, criticised the finding of Schalke's ethics committee. ""If I had pigeonholed an entire continent and its population, then it would be racism rather than 'just' discrimination, as far as I am concerned,"" she told broadcaster NRD on Wednesday. ""Such lapses are a break in what is taboo, without scruples, and their effect on society is -- especially in these times -- devastating."" Toennies had apologised for his ""inappropriate"" words on Sunday, insisting he backs Schalke's values against ""racism, discrimination and exclusion"". Justice Minister Christine Lambrecht had previously called on the German Football Association (DFB) to ""deal"" with Toennies. ""Racism must be loudly and clearly contradicted"" at every opportunity, the politician told the Funke media group. ""Nowhere is integration as successful and quick to work as in sport - that must not be put at risk."" The DFB confirmed to AFP subsidiary SID on Wednesday that their ethics committee will meet to discuss the matter on August 15. Meanwhile, Cacau, the Brazil-born former Germany star who heads the DFB's integration committee, was also stunned by Toennies' comment. ""The longer I think about it, the more unimaginable it becomes that a man of his position and experience speaks so... disparagingly about the population of an entire continent,"" said the 38-year-old. Former Schalke forward Gerald Asamoah, one of Germany's first black internationals, said he was left ""somewhat speechless"" by Toennies remark. ""I have been working with Clemens Toennies for a long time, and we have been close friends for a long time,"" wrote the 40-year-old Asamoah on Instagram. ""He never behaved in a racist manner towards me. ""I was very surprised, shocked and injured by his statement."" Toennies comments have become a distraction for Schalke, under new head coach David Wagner, who start their league season at Borussia Moenchengladbach on August 17. Some observers, however, see the three months break as a chance for Schalke to buy time and for Toennies to settle his affairs while a successor is found. ""It could also have been the beginning of the end of the Clemens Toennies"", wrote German daily Welt."
56,04/08/2019,17:36,Pressure on Schalke boss to resign for racist slur,Schalke chairman Clemens Toennies is facing calls to resign a fortnight before the start of the Bundesliga season following widespread condemnation of racist comments he made last week.,"The 63-year-old has been criticised for saying more power stations should be built in Africa, ""then Africans would stop felling trees and producing children when it gets dark"". The billionaire businessman made the remark at a forum in Paderborn on Thursday while criticising tax increases to fight climate change.

Toennies apologised for his ""inappropriate"" words on Sunday, insisting he backs Schalke's values against ""racism, discrimination and exclusion"". However, a statement on the club website may not be enough to save him with Germany's Justice Minister Christine Lambrecht calling on the German Football Association (DFB) to ""deal"" with Toennies. ""Racism must be loudly and clearly contradicted"" at every opportunity,"" the politician told the Funke media group. ""Nowhere is integration as successful and quick to work as in sport - that must not be put at risk."" Toennies' comments are a distraction for Schalke, under new head coach David Wagner, who start their league season at Borussia Moenchengladbach on August 17. President of the German Football League (DFL) Reinhard Rauball told news agency DPA Toennies' comments are ""completely incompatible with the values of football"" held by both the DFB and DFL. Dagmar Freitag, chairman of the sports committee in the German parliament, says an apology is not enough. ""The fact that something like this is articulated by someone who holds a prominent position in sport makes things all the worse,"" Freitag told German newspaper Welt on Sunday. The politician says an apology alone ""certainly cannot make up for the socio-political damage"". Likewise Toennies must send a ""clear signal"" to atone, Sylvia Schenck, a lawyer for Transparency International also told Welt. ""Such a thing doesn't just slip out during an official speech, there is a highly problematic attitude behind it"", said the former middle-distance runner. ""Active repentance with clear signals to Africans is necessary in order to really prove Toennies has changed his opinion,"" she added."
57,05/07/2019,19:49,Norwich sign Schalke keeper Fahrmann on loan,Norwich City signed Schalke goalkeeper Ralf Fahrmann on a season-long loan on Friday as they continue to bolster their squad following promotion to the Premier League.,"Fahrmann, 30, is Norwich's third close-season signing since their promotion from the second-tier Championship after already landing Swiss striker Josip Drmic and winger Patrick Roberts. ""I'm really glad and proud to sign here. To be a part of the Premier League, I think it's a wonderful thing for all, not only for me, but also for the fans and supporters of Norwich City,"" Fahrmann told Norwich's website. Schalke confirmed they had extended the club captain's contract for a further year until 2023 ahead of him moving to England on loan for next season. ""There were a few clubs who showed interest in me, but Norwich gave me a very familiar feeling and that was the reason why the decision was easy for me,"" said Fahrmann, who has made 196 appearances for Schalke. ""I was at my old club for a really long time, over 14 years, and it felt like it was time for something new."" Fahrmann will compete with current Norwich number one Tim Krul and Northern Ireland international Michael McGovern for a spot between the sticks."
58,10/06/2019,18:44,Schalke sign Everton youngster Kenny on loan,"Everton defender Jonjoe Kenny has signed a one-year loan deal with Bundesliga outfit Schalke, the club announced on Monday.","The 22-year-old full-back is the latest young British player to try his luck in Germany after struggling to hold down a first team place in the Premier League, and follows in the footsteps of Jadon Sancho, Reiss Nelson and fellow Schalke player Rabbi Matondo. Liverpool-born Kenny made just nine league appearances for Everton under Marco Silva last season, and now hopes to pick up more first-team experience at the Veltins-Arena under former Huddersfield coach David Wagner. A member of the England squad for the upcoming Under-21 European Championships in Italy, Kenny will join the Schalke squad after the tournament ends in July. The club announced his arrival in amusing fashion, tweeting the words ""Oh my god! They signed Kenny!"" in reference to a long-running joke in the US animated comedy series South Park."
59,11/05/2019,18:02,Dortmund take title race to wire as Bayern held,Bayern Munich missed the chance to wrap up a seventh successive Bundesliga title as they were held to a goalless draw at RB Leipzig on Saturday and rivals Borussia Dortmund edged a nervy 3-2 win over Fortuna Duesseldorf.,"Chelsea-bound US international Christian Pulisic found the net in his final home game for Dortmund, helping them to battle back to within two points of league leaders Bayern ahead of the final round of games next weekend. Bayern can now secure the title with a win at home to Eintracht Frankfurt next Saturday, while Dortmund must win at Borussia Moenchengladbach. Dortmund, who looked dead and buried after slipping four points behind last week, enjoyed the rub of the green as they stumbled to victory over Duesseldorf. Pulisic, who will join Chelsea next season, bid an emotional farewell to the Dortmund fans before the game and then opened the scoring on 41 minutes. A howler from stand-in goalkeeper Marwin Hitz allowed Oliver Fink to equalise, but Thomas Delaney restored the lead for Dortmund. Hitz then gave away a penalty with a foul on Dodi Lukebakio, but the Belgian dragged the ball wide from 12 yards. Mario Goetze appeared to seal the win for Dortmund on 90 minutes, but Dawid Kownacki pulled one back for Duesseldorf minutes later to make it a nerve-jangling finish for the hosts. In Leipzig, Leon Goretzka's stylish scissor-kick sent Bayern into ecstasy after half-time, but the goal was ruled out by VAR. Serge Gnabry hit the bar later in the second half, but Bayern could not force the winner. At the other end of the table, Nuremberg and Hanover were finally relegated as Stuttgart secured the relegation play-off place with a 3-0 win over Wolfsburg. Hanover went down fighting as goals from Waldemar Anton, Ihlas Bebou and Walace saw them beat Freiburg 3-0. Yet Anastasios Donis, Gonzalo Castro and Daniel Didavi were on the mark for Stuttgart to condemn Hanover and Nuremberg to the drop. Nuremberg, meanwhile, suffered a 4-0 defeat to Borussia Moenchengladbach thanks to an own-goal from Lukas Muehl and strikes from Thorgan Hazard, Denis Zakaria and former Nuremberg man Josip Drmic. The thumping win sees Gladbach go fourth overnight, leapfrogging both Eintracht Frankfurt and Bayer Leverkusen, who were held to a 1-1 draw at home to Schalke, Guido Burgstaller cancelling out Kai Havertz's opener. Frankfurt have the chance to break back into the top four with a win over Mainz on Sunday. Werder Bremen also kept their European hopes alive with a 1-0 win over Hoffenheim, and Hertha Berlin snatched a late 4-3 victory away to Augsburg. Johannes Eggestein's first-half goal condemned RB Leipzig-bound coach Julian Nagelsmann to defeat in his last home game in charge of Hoffenheim. Andre Hahn and Michael Gregoritsch put Augsburg ahead three times but goals from Marvin Plattenhardt and Marko Grujic kept Hertha in the game before a late brace from Salomon Kalou secured three points."
60,16/02/2019,18:12,Ten-man Schalke draw blank ahead of Man City clash,Schalke 04 warmed-up for the Champions League visit of Manchester City with a goalless draw at home to fellow Bundesliga strugglers Freiburg on Saturday.,"Schalke are winless in their last three Bundesliga games and sit just above the relegation places in 14th spot. Next up is a huge challenge at home to Pep Guardiola's Premier League giants Man City in their Champions League last 16, first-leg tie on Wednesday. In Saturday's bad-tempered clash, both Schalke and Freiburg finished with ten men. The Royal Blues played for nearly 50 minutes without defensive midfielder Suat Serdar, sent off for a first-half foul, while Freiburg defender Christian Guenter was dismissed late on for a second yellow card. Schalke came close to conceding a penalty with 10 minutes left when Spanish midfielder Omar Mascarell was suspected of a handball, but the video assistant referee (VAR) over-ruled the referee's initial decision. Welsh teenage winger Rabbi Matondo, who Schalke signed last month from Man City, struggled to make an impact on only his second Bundesliga appearance, his first over 90 minutes. The 18-year-old had a good chance with 16 minutes left but ballooned his shot over the bar. Freiburg hit the Schalke woodwork twice in the second half through substitutes Jerome Gondorf and Luca Waldschmidt. League leaders Borussia Dortmund are at bottom side Nuremberg on Monday. They are two points ahead of Bayern Munich, who won 3-2 at Augsburg on Friday. RB Leipzig took their chance to stay in the title race as a 3-1 win at Stuttgart left them fourth, just a point behind Borussia Moenchengladbach, who play Sunday at Eintracht Frankfurt. Yussuf Poulsen netted two goals as Leipzig took the three points. The Denmark striker opened the scoring after just six minutes when Leipzig's Germany striker Timo Werner fired in a cross, which clipped a defender's knee for Poulsen to tap home. Steven Zuber equalised from the spot for Stuttgart ten minutes later when the video assistant referee spotted the ball had hit Willi Orban's arm after a Mario Gomez header. However, Leipzig rallied as midfielder Marcel Sabitzer curled home a superb free-kick with 20 minutes left, then Poulsen claimed his second goal soon after, tapping home following an impressive run by US international Tyler Adams. Wolfsburg climbed to fifth with a 3-0 win at Mainz with goals by midfielder Maximilian Arnold, striker Wout Weghorst and defender Robin Knoche. Hoffenheim also moved up after Algeria forward Ishak Belfodil, Brazilian striker Joelinton and Germany midfielder Kerem Demirbay netted in their 3-0 win at second-from-bottom Hanover 96 to go seventh."
61,09/02/2019,20:52,Ton up for Lewandowski as Bayern cut Dortmund's lead,Defending champions Bayern Munich trimmed the gap in the Bundesliga table to five points behind Borussia Dortmund on Saturday as Robert Lewandowski scored his 100th goal at home in a 3-1 win over Schalke 04.,"Dortmund had earlier blown a three-goal lead at home to Hoffenheim, who scored three times late on, in a dramatic 3-3 draw. Bayern dominated at Munich's Allianz Arena, taking the lead after new Schalke signing Jeffrey Bruma bundled the ball into his own net on 12 minutes. Schalke pulled level when Turkey international Ahmed Kutucu finished a brilliant counter-attack on 25 minutes to beat Sven Ulreich, Bayern's stand-in keeper with Manuel Neuer sidelined by a thumb injury. Poland striker Lewandowski restored Bayern's lead just 90 seconds later when he netted his 100th goal at the Allianz Arena in the red shirt. James Rodriguez then went close for Bayern, while Thiago Alcantara cleared a Weston McKennie header as Schalke threatened to equalise before half-time. US international McKennie hit the post after the break for Schalke, but Serge Gnabry sealed Bayern's win with a header on 57 minutes after Lewandowski directed the ball towards goal with a bicycle kick. Despite a dazzling display from Jadon Sancho, Dortmund had only themselves to blame for surrendering a commanding lead against Hoffenheim. Sancho opened the scoring, set up two goals and hit the post as the hosts shone over 70 minutes at Signal Iduna Park despite head coach Lucien Favre -- laid up with the flu -- missing from the Dortmund bench. However, with the leaders cruising at 3-0 up thanks to goals by Sancho, Mario Goetze and Raphael Guerreiro, Hoffenheim came off the ropes with Algeria forward Ishak Belfodil netting twice. ""We were really good for long periods -- it's hard to accept the final result,"" said Goetze. ""It's hard when the coach isn't there, but that shouldn't have made a difference -- we should have won."" The result will give Mauricio Pochettino food for thought before his Tottenham team host Dortmund on Wednesday at Wembley in the Champions League last 16, first leg. In the absence of top-scorer and playmaker Marco Reus, sidelined with a thigh injury, Sancho stepped up with one of his best performances since joining Dortmund from Manchester City in August 2017. However, Hoffenheim fought back in the final 20 minutes when Belfodil tapped home his first goal from a cross by Pavel Kaderabek, who made it 3-2 with a bullet header eight minutes from time. Belfodil completed the comeback and claimed a point for Hoffenheim when he launched himself at a free-kick and his header beat goalkeeper Roman Burki on 87 minutes. Elsewhere, Borussia Moenchengladbach slipped to third after losing 3-0 at home to Hertha Berlin as Salomon Kalou, Ondrej Duda and Davie Selke scored. In the basement battle, Hanover climbed off the bottom with a 2-0 home win at 10-man Nuremberg, who dropped to the foot of the table, with former Germany striker Nicolai Mueller scoring both goals. Nuremberg were reduced to 10 men after only 11 minutes when midfielder Simon Rhein was shown a straight red card for a dangerous foul. Fourth-placed RB Leipzig were held to a goalless draw at home by Eintracht Frankfurt, who are just one place behind them. Mid-table sides Freiburg and Wolfsburg shared a point in an entertaining 3-3 draw as Gian-Luca Waldschmidt equalised for hosts Freiburg two minutes from time."
62,08/02/2019,02:30,Struggling Schalke turn to Welsh teenager Matondo,Struggling Schalke are hoping Welsh teenager Rabbi Matondo can help turn their season around against Bayern Munich and his former club Manchester City in the coming weeks.,"Having finished second to Bayern in last season's Bundesliga under 33-year-old coach Domenico Tedesco, Schalke have lost ten of their 20 league games this term. Last weekend's 2-0 home defeat by Borussia Moenchengladbach left Schalke 12th in the table -- still their highest position all season -- as Matondo made his debut. He should feature again this Saturday at Bayern's Allianz Arena with Man City to come in the Champions League last-16 first leg at home on February 20. ""He's 18 years old, we know that, but we've been watching him for so long. He already has the stuff to play in the Bundesliga,"" said Schalke director Christian Heidel. Schalke are winless in 17 games against Bayern, who they last beat in the 2011 German Cup semi-finals when Bayern's current captain Manuel Neuer was still at Schalke. Third-placed Bayern will be desperate to make amends for a shock 3-1 league defeat last Saturday at Bayer Leverkusen, who attacked mercilessly on the counter and found huge holes to exploit. Bayern bounced back with a 3-2 win at Hertha Berlin on Wednesday in the German Cup, but again proved shaky at the back with Mats Hummels making a bad mistake for Hertha's second goal before Kingsley Coman's winner. Schalke romped to a 4-1 Cup win at home to Fortuna Dusseldorf with Matondo showing glimpses of his talent in playing the first half only. After a raft of injuries up front, Schalke hope the signing of the Welsh youngster can rescue their season. The Cardiff-born teenager cost nine million euros ($10.275m) and arrived after breaking a club record in Manchester, clocking 2.62secs over 20 metres in sprint testing -- the fastest of anyone at City. Schalke see Matondo as becoming their answer to Jadon Sancho -- the 18-year-old England winger who has helped bitter rivals Dortmund go seven points clear in the league with consistently eye-catching performances. Tedesco sees him as a ""medium and long-term"" investment, who is ""able to win every one-on-one"". While Leroy Sane found success by going in the other direction from Schalke to Man City, Matondo is part of a trend of teens from top British clubs heading to the Bundesliga in search of game time. ""Schalke is the right decision for my future as a footballer. Guys like Mesut Ozil, Ivan Rakitic and Leroy Sane made huge strides in their career here,"" said Matondo on joining Schalke. Tedesco has shown a ruthless streak since taking over at Schalke in 2017, dropping club captain and 2014 World Cup winner Benedikt Hoewedes, who was loaned to Juventus before joining Lokomotiv Moscow. Current skipper and fan favourite Ralf Faehrmann, another product of the Schalke academy, was also ejected last month, replaced by Germany Under-21 goalkeeper Alexander Nuebel. Nuebel's sending off last Saturday saw Faehrmann reinstated for the mid-week Cup tie, but it remains to see who Tedesco will prefer in goal against Bayern.

63,06/02/2019,23:45,Coman grabs winner as Bayern outlast Hertha in German Cup,Kingsley Coman spared teammate Mats Hummels' blushes with an extra-time winner as Bayern Munich stumbled into the German Cup quarter-finals with a 3-2 win at Hertha Berlin on Wednesday.,"Hummels' defensive mistake had gifted Hertha an equaliser in the second half of normal time, but Coman's header ensured that Bayern huffed and puffed their way into the last four. Hertha took the lead with a brutal counter-attack after just three minutes, Maximilian Mittelstaedt stroking the ball past Sven Ulreich, in Bayern's goal for the injured Manuel Neuer. Bayern hit back almost immediately through Serge Gnabry, who pounced on a loose ball and smashed in the equaliser on the half-volley. Gnabry then put Bayern ahead just after half-time, surging into the box and slotting the ball inside the far post. Yet Hummels' howler brought Hertha back into the game on 67 minutes. The Bayern defender's weak header allowed Davie Selke to dart into the box and prod the hosts level. Hummels continued to look unsettled, and he will have been mightily relieved when Coman nodded in the winner eight minutes into extra time. ""Their second goal was unnecessary, but we all make mistakes from time to time,"" Gnabry told ARD. ""It's always tough in the cup, and we are proud to be through."" Meanwhile, Schalke cruised into the quarter-finals with a 4-1 home win over Fortuna Duesseldorf on an emotional evening for the hosts. The game kicked off amid a sombre atmosphere in the wake of news that Schalke's legendary, cigar-smoking former general manager Rudi Assauer had died aged 74. ""Rudi was the architect of modern Schalke. Without him, we wouldn't be standing in this arena,"" said Schalke chairman Clemens Tonnies. The mood was lightened on the half-hour mark, as Ahmed Kutucu curled the ball into the top corner to give Schalke the lead. Their second came from a corner just after the break. Winston McKennie forced a good save from Jaroslav Drobny, before Salif Sane pounced on the rebound. Mark Uth added a third from close range on 53 minutes. Rouwen Hennings then chipped in a consolation goal for Duesseldorf before Sane sealed the win late on. Earlier on Wednesday, 19-year-old Brazilian forward Matheus Cunha made history with his first-half winner, as RB Leipzig beat Wolfsburg 1-0 to reach the German Cup quarter-finals for the first time. Cunha fired Leipzig to an early lead on nine minutes, latching on to a sharp through ball from Lukas Klostermann and turning the ball into the bottom corner. Augsburg also progressed after a smash-and-grab 1-0 victory away to second tier side Holstein Kiel. Kiel were left to rue an array of missed chances five minutes from time, when Michael Gregoritsch found the net against the run of play to send Augsburg into the quarter-finals. Hamburg, Paderborn, Heidenheim and Werder Bremen make up the list of quarter-finalists, having progressed on Tuesday."

""It's a great adventure for me - I already knew a lot about Schalke 04: Mesut Ozil, Ivan Rakitic and Leroy Sane all took important steps in their careers here,"" said Matondo, who joined City from Cardiff City's academy in 2016. ""There were lots of good discussions with the coach and my new teammates only have good things to say. ""The Bundesliga is a great league and Schalke 04 is the right decision for my footballing future."" Matondo, who became a full Wales international last November, reportedly cost nine million euros ($10.275m), with an option in his contract for City to buy him back for 50m euros - although he has not made a single Premier League appearance. ""We are happy that we have been able to convince Rabbi without much publicity that joining us is the right decision for him,"" said Schalke's director of sport Christian Heidel. Matondo arrives in Germany highly rated by City boss Pep Guardiola, who described him as ""incredibly fast"" after the Welsh teen featured in the Premier League 2 and UEFA Youth League this season for City's junior team. He is the latest in a trend of British teenagers to move to the German league following England winger Jadon Sancho, who joined league leaders Borussia Dortmund in August 2017 from Man City, and Reiss Nelson, on loan from Arsenal at Hoffenheim. Schalke moved for Matondo with the transfer market closing on Thursday following injuries to midfielders Benjamin Stambouli (broken cheekbone) and Alessandro Schoepf (knee ligament tear), plus winger Steven Skrzybski (injured hamstring) in Friday's 2-2 draw at Hertha Berlin. Matondo will boost Schalke's attack, which is thin on options after injuries to Swiss striker Breel Embolo, Austrian forward Guido Burgstaller and now Skrzybski. ""We have been interested in Rabbi for a long time, because we are impressed with his potential,"" said Schalke head coach Domenico Tedesco. ""He is extremely quick and technically strong. ""We can't forget how young he is though - we will give him the time he needs to find his feet at Schalke and in the Bundesliga."""

The transfer window in Germany closes at 1800 (1700 GMT) on Thursday, but according to magazine Kicker, teenage Welsh winger Rabbi Matondo could be signed from the Premier League champions. Right winger Schoepf is the most serious case ""he'll be out for between eight to ten weeks"" say the club, while Stambouli is only expected to return at the end of February after an operation. Skrzybski, who played as a striker in Berlin, could return within a fortnight. Having sold fans favourite Naldo to Monaco earlier this month, Schalke coach Domenico Tedesco is also looking for another centre-back, especially as Salif Sane had an off-day against Hertha. ""We usually have two centre-backs,"" Tedesco said, ""so I'd be happy if I get one."" Schalke host Pep Guardiola's side in the Champions League last 16 on February 20 in Gelsenkirchen with the return on March 12. The Royal Blues are up to 12th in the German league, and unbeaten in their last three games, after recovering from a terrible start to the season."

""That was a relief to get the win,"" said Daniel Caligiuri, who scored both goals before admitting the decision by coach Domenico Tedesco to drop Faehrmann caught the team off guard. ""It was a shock for us, Ralf is our captain, but was a bit unsure in the last few games -- we'll have to see what happens now."" Right-back Caligiuri gave the hosts the lead by converting a penalty after eight minutes, but Wolfsburg drew level midway through the first half when midfielder Elvis Rexhbecaj beat Nuebel. Schalke ensured the win, which keeps them seven points away from the bottom three, when US midfielder Weston McKennie picked out Caligiuri on the right and the 31-year-old hit the net against his former club Wolfsburg, who are sixth. Despite having qualified for the Champions League's knock-out phase, Schalke, last season's runners-up in Germany, remain just above the relegation places after losing nine of their 18 league games. They host Pep Guardiola's Manchester City in Gelsenkirchen on February 20 with the return leg on March 12. On Saturday, leaders Borussia Dortmund stayed six points clear at the top with a 1-0 win at RB Leipzig, thanks to Axel Witsel's first-half goal, in a commanding away performance without captain and playmaker Marco Reus. Defending champions Bayern Munich, who are chasing a seventh straight league title, remain second after an impressive 3-1 win at Hoffenheim on Friday as Leon Goretzka scored twice. Earlier on Sunday, veteran striker Vedad Ibisevic helped break Hertha Berlin's five-game winless streak with a hand in all three goals in their 3-1 victory at bottom side Nuremberg. Hertha earned their first win since December 8 to go seventh in the table as Ibisevic, 34, who is out of contract in June, showed his experience with a commanding performance in icy conditions. The Bosnia and Herzegovina international gave Hertha the lead after he quickly exchanged passes with strike partner Davie Selke and steered his shot past Nuremberg goalkeeper Christian Mathenia after 15 minutes for his seventh league goal this season. The hosts drew level just before the break when midfielder Hanno Behrens stabbed home a long-range shot from Eduard Loewen from the edge of the box. However, Ibisevic made sure of the three points by steering a cross from the right into the path of Ondrej Duda, who restored Hertha's lead five minutes after the break. Duda netted his second goal on 70 minutes when Ibisevic let a pass from Selkie fall to the Slovakia midfielder who crashed home his ninth goal of the season."

""The decision was extremely hard for us, he is quite rightly our captain and remains a great person and goalkeeper,"" Schalke coach Domenico Tedesco told Sky. ""But in the last few games there was a bit of uncertainty there and Alex did well in training. ""We felt that 'Ralle' was not free in the head,"" added Tedesco, who said Faehrmann's demotion was ""a snapshot, nothing permanent"". According to German daily Bild, Faehrmann was told during the club's winter training camp in Benidorm that his place was no longer guaranteed. Despite having qualified for the Champions League's knock-out phase, Schalke, last season's runners-up in Germany, are having a dreadful season and remain just above the relegation places after losing nine of their 17 league games.

68,22/09/2018,21:27,Rodriguez stars as Bayern maintain perfect Bundesliga start,"James Rodriguez shone for Bayern Munich, scoring a goal and winning a penalty, as the German champions made it four wins from their first four Bundesliga games with a 2-0 victory at Schalke to stay top on Saturday.","Rodriguez struck with just eight minutes gone at Gelsenkirchen's Veltins Arena, expertly slipping his marker, former Bayern team-mate Sebastian Rudy, to power home a header from Joshua Kimmich's cross. It was a sublime effort which left Schalke with too much to do, as they ended up suffering a fourth consecutive league defeat after finishing second last season, while Bayern are the only team with a 100-percent record. The 27-year-old Colombian, making his first league start this season, should have scored his second when he squandered a golden chance five minutes after the break. Veteran winger Franck Ribery sliced through Schalke's defence and squared with goalkeeper Ralf Faehrmann beaten, but Rodriguez slumped to the turf, head in hands, after firing wide with the goal at his mercy. To compound Schalke's problems, US international Weston McKennie, 20, was carried off with a leg injury on 50 minutes. Rodriguez then effectively settled the matter on 63 minutes after a foul in the area by Alessandro Schoepf. Star striker Robert Lewandowski stepped up and smashed home the resulting spot-kick to make it 2-0. Schalke had little to offer and only a superb save from Faehrmann kept out a long-range free-kick from David Alaba, which curled wickedly 12 minutes from time. ""We made a superb start and in the end deserved the win,"" said Bayern's ex-Schalke midfielder Leon Goretzka. Earlier, second-placed Hertha Berlin, who host Bayern next Friday, had temporarily claimed top spot as captain Vedad Ibisevic scored twice in a 4-2 home win over Borussia Moenchengladbach. After Gladbach's Belgium midfielder Thorgan Hazard netted a 29th-minute penalty -- his seventh goal in ten games against Hertha -- Berlin roared back. Ibisevic headed his first goal a minute after Hazard had struck, before Austria midfielder Valentino Lazaro scored with another header on 34 minutes. Ibisevic slotted home Berlin's third goal midway through the second half. New signing Alassane Plea gave Gladbach hope with 23 minutes to go before Ondrej Duda scored Hertha's fourth by tapping home a great cross from Dutch winger Javairo Dilrosun. US international Christian Pulisic again rescued Borussia Dortmund, who had French defender Abdou Diallo sent off 15 minutes from time, with a late goal to equalise in a 1-1 draw at Hoffenheim. ""After the red card, many thought that it was over, but we came back. We can be happy with the result, we know that,"" said Dortmund coach Lucien Favre, whose side are now third. Hoffenheim took the lead just before the break when Brazilian forward Joelinton pounced on a mistake by Diallo. Dortmund were saved as VAR spotted a marginal offside when Ermin Bicakcic headed into the net five minutes after the break. Frenchman Diallo capped a bad day at the office when he was sent off on 76 minutes for bringing down Andrej Kramaric, who was through on goal. Having marked his 20th birthday with the winner at Club Brugge on Tuesday in the Champions League, Pulisic equalised six minutes from time, converting a Marco Reus cross. Elsewhere, Everton misfit Davy Klaassen scored his second goal in as many Bundesliga games to grab Werder Bremen a 3-2 win over Augsburg. The Dutch playmaker, who cost Bremen 14 million euros ($16.3 million) in July, profited 15 minutes from time after Augsburg goalkeeper let the ball roll through his legs from a cross. Korean midfielder Koo Ja-Cheol and Philipp Max had pulled Augsburg level after Max Kruse and Maximilian Eggestein put Werder 2-0 with early goals. An Anton Waldemar own goal and a late second from Toerles Knoell sealed Nuremberg a 2-0 win at Hanover 96. Germany striker Nils Petersen scored at the second attempt, heading home a parried first-half penalty, as Freiburg won 3-1 at Wolfsburg, who suffered their first loss of the season."
69,18/09/2018,16:38,Struggling Schalke accused of 'selling future',"Schalke, who return to the Champions League on Tuesday after a four-year hiatus, have been accused of ""selling their future"" for allowing three rising stars to leave.","The Royal Blues, who finished second in the German league last season, host Porto in Gelsenkirchen in their Group D opener, but are struggling after losing their first three Bundesliga games. Despite finishing second to Bayern Munich last season, Schalke are already struggling this term leaving head coach Domenico Tedesco under pressure after 15 months in charge. Ex-Germany midfielder Steffen Freund has criticised Tedesco's boss, Schalke's sports director Christian Heidel, after Leon Goretzka joined Bayern and Max Meyer, both 23, left for Crystal Palace on free transfers last season. On top of that, centre-back Thilo Kehrer, 21, was sold to Paris Saint-Germain last month for a reported fee of 37 million euros ($42.3 million). ""The departures play a big role. Perhaps one notices now that Max Meyer, Leon Goretzka and Thilo Kehrer were the future of Schalke and they sold it,"" said Freund, a Euro '96 winner with Germany, told broadcaster RTL. Schalke are second from bottom in the German league table after losing to mid-table sides Wolfsburg, Hertha Berlin and Borussia Moenchengladbach, where they were beaten 2-1 on Saturday. They reached the Champions League's semi-finals in 2011, bowing out after defeat to Manchester United, but will be lucky to get out of Group D this season, which includes Lokomotiv Moscow and Galatasaray. Tedesco says the Champions League offers a fresh start as Schalke make their return since losing to Real Madrid in the last 16 of 2014/15. ""Obviously recent results are playing on our minds, but the Champions League is a fresh start for us and we have earned the right to play these games,"" said Tedesco. However, Freund, who retired in 2004 after spells with Tottenham Hotspur and Borussia Dortmund, says the problems are in both attack and defence. ""Schalke have problems scoring goals, they need twenty goal shots to score. You have to compare it with last season - because then they only needed eight shots,"" said Freund, who spent two seasons at Schalke in the early 90s. ""They also concede two goals per game. ""Last season they still had the second best defence behind Bayern. ""What is quite amazing is that they also let in goals from standard set piece plays."""

""After 18 years I say good bye,"" Jones wrote on Instagram. ""I have a clear vision, after I had a couple of months to concentrate on what comes next!!! THANKS to all my teammates, coaches and clubs who stuck with me &amp; believed in me through all of the years. And a special thanks to all the fans who supported me all the way. See you all soon."" Jones, 38, scored four goals in 69 caps for the US squad after switching nations from Germany after playing for under-20 and under-21 sides. His lone World Cup for the Americans came in 2014, when he netted an equalizer against Portugal in a 2-2 draw. In MLS, Jones had his best success with the New England Revolution, reaching the 2014 MLS Cup final before losing to the Los Angeles Galaxy. He later played for the Colorado Rapids and the Galaxy."

Their hopes of bouncing back from an opening day defeat to Wolfsburg were dashed by a well-organised Hertha side on Sunday. Domenico Tedesco's men should have gone ahead on 13 minutes when Hertha's Marko Grujic conceded a penalty with a clear handball, but Daniel Caligiuri dragged his spot-kick wide of the post. Within minutes, Schalke had paid dearly for their missed opportunity, as Hertha surged forward with a long ball, and Duda's deflected shot put the Berliners in front. Schalke's miserable evening was crowned seconds from time, when Yevhen Konoplyanka was sent off for bringing down Dennis Jastrzembski in front of goal, and Duda converted the resulting free-kick to give Hertha their first away win over Schalke in 14 years. RB Leipzig are also still searching for a first league win of the season, after they were held to a 1-1 draw by promoted side Fortuna Duesseldorf earlier in the day. After a heavy defeat in Dortmund last week, Leipzig were facing a nightmare start to the season when Matthias Zimmermann fired Duesseldorf in front, before Jean-Kevin Augustin spared his side's blushes with a 68th-minute equaliser. ""I think they underestimated us today,"" Zimmermann told Sky. ""We played brilliantly going forward, and created a lot of chances. Sadly, we lost two points in the end."" Leipzig made a nervy start to the game, and Marvin Ducksch squandered a gilt-edged opportunity to put Duesseldorf ahead after just six minutes. Augustin found the net for Leipzig just before half-time, bundling in the rebound after Emil Forsberg had stung the palms of Fortuna keeper Michael Rensing. The Frenchman, though, was ruled offside. Duesseldorf wasted no time after the break and took a deserved lead on 47 minutes, Zimmermann linking up with Niko Giesselmann to sweep the ball into the bottom corner. The home side responded with tenacity and were rewarded when Augustin picked up a loose ball in the box and prodded it past Rensing. Matheus Cunha came within inches of scoring a brilliant winner for Leipzig ten minutes from time, but his overhead kick bounced just the wrong side of the post, before Ducksch forced a flying save from Peter Gulacsi at the other end."

He only joined Bayern last August on a free transfer from Hoffenheim and had signed a contract with the club until 2020, but was frustrated by his lack of game time in Munich. ""We welcome into the team a player who has great technique and a real football brain and who has already proved his ability at international level,"" Schalke coach Domenico Tedesco said. Rudy has made 26 international appearances and was part of the Germany squad which crashed out in the group phase at the World Cup in Russia.

Gabon striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang is much less successful at Arsenal this season, failing to score for a third consecutive English Premier League match. MOHAMED SALAH (Liverpool) The 2017 African Footballer of the Year fired Liverpool to the top of the Premier League with the only goal in a win over Brighton. Salah netted in the 23rd minute with a clinical finish, superbly steering a left-foot shot inside the far post from Senegalese Sadio Mane's pass. WILFRIED ZAHA (Crystal Palace) Despite scoring, the Ivory Coast forward endured another frustrating trip to Watford, as Palace crashed to a 2-1 defeat. Vicarage Road has been a house of horrors for Zaha, who has been booked on his last two visits for diving. He was memorably taunted by Watford mascot Harry the Hornet in 2016 when he threw himself in front of Zaha after the final whistle to ridicule the Palace player's diving. PIERRE-EMERICK AUBAMEYANG (Arsenal) His goalless start to the season extended to three games as he failed to find the net in a 3-1 win over West Ham at the Emirates Stadium. Aubameyang was superb in his first few months with Arsenal following a January move from Borussia Dortmund, but he has struggled under new boss Unai Emery, who declared last week that his forward is lacking confidence. CHRISTIAN KOUAME (Genoa) Ivorian Kouame scored on his Serie A debut with the second goal in a 2-1 win for Genoa over Empoli in his team's first match since the bridge tragedy in the city two weeks ago. The 20-year-old beat the offside trap to run onto a through ball and scored from an angle after 18 minutes as the crowd observed 43 minutes of silence, one for each of the victims of the bridge collapse. KEVIN-PRINCE BOATENG (Sassuolo) Germany-born Ghana forward Boateng converted a penalty with the last kick of the game to snatch a point for Sassuolo after Leonardo Pavoletti's Cagliari brace. VAR judged Filippo Romagnoli to have handled the ball and Boateng converted the penalty to equalise for a 2-2 draw. It was the 31-year-old former AC Milan player's first goal for his new club since moving back to Italy from Eintracht Frankfurt in Germany this season. KALIDOU KOULIBALY (Napoli) Senegalese defender Koulibaly's Napoli suffered an early scare after going two goals down before fighting back to beat AC Milan 3-2 at their San Paulo Stadium. But the 27-year-old said he was pleased with how the Serie A runners-up reacted to turn it around for the second week in a row. ""It's a pity that we conceded those two goals, but we'll learn from the experience and improve,"" said the Senegalese. ""We know that we can turn situations around, and will go far with this mentality."" NABIL BENTALEB (Schalke 04) The Algeria midfielder came off the bench to convert a late penalty for Schalke to cancel out John Anthony Brook's first-half goal before Daniel Ginzcek scored a dramatic 94th-minute winner in Wolfsburg's 2-1 shock win. Former Tottenham Hotspur midfielder Bentaleb, 23, made just 12 league starts for Schalke last season and only came on after 83 minutes as last season's runners-up crashed on the opening day of the season.

However, the game was dominated by chaotic scenes midway through the second-half at Wolfsburg's Volkswagen Arena as VAR interventions led to a flurry of card reversals. Schalke coach Domenico Tedesco later claimed he was insulted during a heated exchange with match referee Patrick Ittrich over the interventions. ""It was very one-sided, I did not have much to say,"" Tedesco replied when asked what he said to Ittrich. ""I asked the fourth official a question - a normal question - and then I was insulted. ""This means that the conversation was not very respectful from my point of view. ""Emotions are part of the game - even for the referee, which makes it okay."" Schalke were reduced to 10 men when defender Matija Nastasic was sent off for going in studs up on Wolfsburg's Dutch striker Wout Weghorst on 66 minutes. A VAR ruling meant the yellow card he was initially shown was upgraded to a red by referee Patrick Ittrich. Weghorst was then sent off moments later for barging Schalke forward Guido Burgstaller. However, his red card was downgraded to a yellow after the video assistant spotted that Burgstaller, who was subsequently booked, had shoved the Dutchman over in the penalty area. VAR chaos in Wolfsburg comes after defending champions Bayern Munich beat Hoffenheim 3-1 on Friday with the help of a controversial penalty despite the referee consulting VAR. Wolfsburg took the lead when Maximilian Arnold's corner drifted to the back post and was headed into the top corner by burly centre-back Brooks on 33 minutes. The American defender then gave away a late penalty for a kick on Schalke's Swiss striker Breel Embolo. Ex-Tottenham Hotspur midfielder Bentaleb, who had just come off the bench, fired home the 85th-minute spot kick before Ginczek struck. On Saturday night, Borussia Moenchengladbach enjoyed an impressive 2-0 win at home to Bayer Leverkusen, capped by a stunning goal from US forward Fabian Johnson. Thorgan Hazard squandered a first-half penalty when his weak shot was saved by Leverkusen goalkeeper Ramazan Ozcan. It was goalless at the break, but Gladbach were not to be denied at Borussia Park and midfielder Jonas Hofmann converted a penalty on 55 minutes before Johnson scored the goal of the opening weekend. After a superb exchange of quick passes at close quarters with Raffael, the American forward toed the ball home for a 58th-minute goal which gave Leverkusen no chance. Elsewhere, Nuremberg suffered a 1-0 defeat at Hertha Berlin on their return to the Bundesliga after a four-year absence. Hertha captain Vedad Ibisevic slammed home the first-half winner at Berlin's Olympic Stadium. Eintracht Frankfurt, under new coach Adi Huetter, made up for their shock German Cup defeat to fourth-tier minnows Ulm last weekend with a 2-0 win at Freiburg as strikers Nicolai Mueller and Sebastien Haller scored. Werder Bremen were held to a 1-1 draw at home to Hanover 96 with Hendrik Weydandt's goal for the visitors cancelled out by a late header by Bremen's Czech defender Theodor Gebre Selassie.

""We were not in Munich for the sake of pleasure... Everything else is speculation, and I won't participate in that,"" Tedesco replied to questions about Rudy, a defensive midfielder. After agreeing to sell Germany Under-21 centre-back Thilo Kehrer for a reported 37 million euros ($42.3 million) to Paris Saint-Germain last week, Schalke can certainly afford Rudy, who has a market value of around 15 million euros. The 28-year-old moved in 2017 on a free transfer from Hoffenheim to Bayern, where he is under contract until 2020, but he was not used in key games last season. Rudy has made 26 appearances for Germany but played just 31 minutes at the World Cup, suffering a broken nose in the last-gasp 2-1 win over Sweden, as the Germans crashed out in the group stage. Bayern chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge has already said the club has too many midfielders and Arturo Vidal has since been sold to Barcelona. RB Leipzig's director of sport Ralf Rangnick on Wednesday described reports they have already signed Rudy as ""the mother of all fake news"", but did not rule out a future deal. ""According to how things currently stand, Sebastian Rudy will not move to RB Leipzig, but I do not know yet how things will look in a week or two,"" added Rangnick. Hoffenheim coach Julian Nagelsmann, who will take over at RB Leipzig for the 2019/20 season, says Rudy would slot into the vacancy left by Naby Keita, who has joined Liverpool. Rudy has a reputation for being a midfield organiser rather than an eye-catching match-winner. ""He is not a player who clearly stands out, but someone who brings a good structure into the game,"" said Nagelsmann. Bayern, who have won the Bundesliga each of the last six seasons, open the new campaign at home to Hoffenheim on August 24. Schalke kick off their 2018/19 campaign a day later at Wolfsburg while RB Leipzig travel to Borussia Dortmund on August 26."

79,30/06/2018,21:48,Morocco World Cup player involved in fatal road accident,"Morocco's 21-year-old World Cup midfielder Amine Harit was involved in a road accident in which a pedestrian was killed, the Moroccan football federation and local police said Saturday.","Harit was driving a Mercedes car registered in France when the accident in which the 30-year-old man died occurred shortly after midnight in Marrakesh, police said. Police said his 14-year-old brother was in the Mercedes when the accident happened. A police spokesman said Harit's passport had been confiscated and he had been summoned to appear before prosecutors on Monday. Harit, who plays for Bundesliga club Schalke 04, was part of the Morocco side that were eliminated after losing two and drawing one of their first-round matches at the World Cup in Russia. Schalke said in a statement: ""As the driver of the car involved, he was unable to prevent the tragic accident."" The Gelsenkirchen-based club added: ""Above all else, Amine and all of us at FC Schalke would like to send our condolences to the relatives of the victim."" It said Harit was receiving counselling. Harit was voted man-of-the match in Morocco's game against Iran even though his side lost."
80,30/05/2018,21:14,"Germany's 'Mr Safe Hands' Neuer, still beloved at Schalke","The pitheads around Gelsenkirchen bear testimony to the heavy industry linking the region to local Bundesliga club Schalke 04, nicknamed 'The Miners', where Manuel Neuer started his impressive career.","The west German city's famous son was voted the world's best goalkeeper for four years running from 2013-16 and was Germany's ""Mr Safe Hands"" at the 2014 World Cup with a string of superb performances. As a result, Neuer finished third in the voting for the 2014 Ballon d'Or behind superstars Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo, who won the title. Sidelined by a foot fracture since September, Neuer is set to play his first full match in Saturday's friendly international against Austria in Klagenfurt. Germany fans hope their goalkeeper and captain will prove he is ready to face Mexico in Moscow on June 17 in their first World Cup match -- none more so than one of his first coaches at Schalke. ""He didn't become a world-class goalkeeper for nothing. I hope he comes back better than ever,"" Norbert Elgert, 61, told AFP at Schalke's youth academy. Neuer was born in Gelsenkirchen in March 1986. He still has strong ties to the city having opened the youth club 'MANUS' in 2014 for disadvantaged children, which is supported by the Manuel Neuer Kids Foundation. Neuer started out in Schalke's academy - dubbed 'The Miners' Forge'. After making his senior Bundesliga debut in August 2006, Neuer won the 2009 European Under-21 Championship in the same junior Germany team as future World Cup winners Mesut Ozil and Benedikt Hoewedes, also products of Schalke's youth academy. Neuer joined Schalke as a small boy in 1991 and wept when he announced in April 2011, after 203 appearances for the Royal Blues, that he was leaving to join present club Bayern Munich. The move was the springboard to winning every title available for club and country, including both the Champions League and Club World Cup in 2013. In Neuer's 298 appearances for Bayern, more than half have been clean sheets. He has made 74 appearances for Germany and let in just four goals in seven matches at the 2014 World Cup, keeping a clean sheet in the 1-0 win against Argentina in the final. However, there were few early signs of the huge career -- or imposing height at 1.93m (6ft 4ins) -- that Neuer was to reach. ""I've known him since he was 10 or 12 years old. At that point he wasn't fixed on being a goalkeeper,"" explained Elgert, a former Schalke midfielder. ""At that point, he was relatively short, there was no way of knowing he would grow so tall. ""However, the one thing he had was that he was positively obsessed with football, even though he wasn't considering a professional career at the time. ""He could have been a pro as an outfield player, but what made him exceptional was his overall talent, his joy of life and of playing. ""For Manuel, it's irrelevant whether he's playing with millions watching at home on television or with 100,000 in the stadium. ""He'd happily play with no one watching."" Neuer is renowned for rock-solid confidence, quick reactions and an imposing presence in the box, which makes opposing strikers think twice. Elgert recalls how Neuer reacted to stiff competition in Schalke's academy. ""His real ambition didn't emerge until he was in the Under-19s,"" said Elgert. ""He was not first-choice, an older goalkeeper was ahead of him, who was in age-group national team. ""I told Manu: 'With your talent, you can decide for yourself when you will get in the team'."" Sure enough, after a series of convincing performances, ""Manuel quickly became our first-choice and the national goalkeeper for his age-group"". It has been seven years since Neuer left Schalke, yet he is far from forgotten in Gelsenkirchen and Elgert admits the announcement of his departure was a sad day. ""Of course it hurt, the boy grew up here in the academy,"" said Elgert. ""He's now 100 percent Bayern. For sure, he loves his current club and blossoms with it, but he'll always remain 'a Schalker'. ""The boys who leave us always have a bit of Schalke in them. ""It's something beautiful and is why when they come back here we should always say 'welcome home'."""
81,04/05/2018,02:10,Hamburg adopt knock-out mentality for survival fight,"Midfielder Lewis Holtby says Hamburg must treat Saturday's match at Eintracht Frankfurt as ""a cup semi-final"" if they want to avoid a historic first relegation from the Bundesliga.","Second-bottom Hamburg are five points from safety with two league games left -- at Eintracht Frankfurt and then at home to Borussia Moenchengladbach -- as they bid to avoid slipping out of the top flight for the first time. But they sit just two points behind Wolfsburg, who occupy 16th place, which provides the solace of a relegation play-off against the team who finish third in the second tier. Holtby says, from a Hamburg perspective, those remaining games against clubs fighting for European places next season are effectively knock-out matches. ""This is our 'semi-final',"" said Holtby, who has scored four goals in Hamburg's last five games to breathe life into their survival hopes. ""We aren't dead yet. I believe 100 percent that we can rescue things."" Hamburg are the only club to have played in every season since the Bundesliga was established in 1963 -- when even mighty Bayern Munich were still a second-division club. A seven-point gap at the start of April has been slashed by wins over fellow strugglers Freiburg, 1-0 at home a fortnight ago, and Wolfsburg, 3-1 away last Saturday. Three wins in their last four games have given belief to Hamburg's players and fans alike, but they need Wolfsburg to drop more points. Moreover, they are facing a Frankfurt side eager to bounce back from a 4-1 mauling at champions Bayern Munich, which followed a 3-0 home defeat by Hertha Berlin. ""We have not achieved anything yet, if we want to get over the line, then we need further victories,"" said Christian Titz, Hamburg's third coach since January. Hamburg have fallen on hard times in recent seasons, needing to win the relegation play-off in both 2013/14 and 2014/15 to stay up. This season has been a disaster. Hamburg were second from bottom with 15 points from 19 games when Markus Gisdol was sacked as head coach in late January. Former player Bernd Hollerbach took over, but was soon dismissed after failing to win any of his seven games, admitting ""we need a miracle"". Titz was promoted from the reserves and the 47-year-old has coaxed three wins from his six games to turn the corner. ""We are playing a totally different style of football, the coach has his own ideas and sticks to them,"" enthused midfielder Aaron Hunt. Hamburg need Wolfsburg to slip up either this Saturday at RB Leipzig, who are winless in their last five games and fighting to keep a Europa League place, or at home to Cologne, who are already relegated. Having already had their relegation confirmed last weekend, bottom side Cologne host champions Bayern Munich, who are licking their wounds after their agonising Champions League exit in midweek. Bayern, who sealed a sixth straight league title last month, hold a massive 24-point lead in the table. Coach Jupp Heynckes is sure to rotate after they drew 2-2 at Real Madrid on Wednesday to lose their Champions League semi-final 4-3 on aggregate. Saturday's fixtures (all 1330 GMT) Borussia Dortmund v Mainz, RB Leipzig v Wolfsburg, Cologne v Bayern Munich, Werder Bremen v Bayer Leverkusen, Borussia Moenchengladbach v Freiburg, Eintracht Frankfurt v Hamburg, Augsburg v Schalke, Hanover 96 v Hertha Berlin, Stuttgart v Hoffenheim"
82,30/04/2018,21:43,Schalke suspend Meyer over bullying allegations,Schalke on Monday hit back at allegations from Max Meyer that senior club officials bullied him by suspending the Germany midfielder for their last two games.,"Meyer's contract expires at the end of the season and despite being linked to Arsenal, Liverpool and Paris Saint-Germain, he has yet to reveal his plans. Schalke moved quickly after Meyer told German daily Bild that he ""felt bullied"" out of the club by sports director Christian Heidel and chairman Clemens Toennies. ""We cannot tolerate this approach and these statements - even more so the incorrect allegations which disturb us and we strongly reject,"" said Heidel. Schalke's coach Domenico Tedesco, who has steered the club to second in the Bundesliga behind Bayern Munich, also slammed Meyer. ""I am disappointed with his personal attacks and I cannot understand them, because they just are not true,"" said Tedesco. Meyer, 22, has been suspended from the first-team squad, effectively cutting his ties after nine years with the German club he joined as a junior. Having made the last of his four appearances for Germany in 2016, Meyer recently informed Schalke he will not renew his contract. His suspension follows a season-long stand off as Schalke tried to persuade him to stay after losing Germany midfielder Leon Goretzka to Bayern for next season. Heidel publically confirmed last week that Meyer will leave and the relationship quickly soured. The box-to-box midfielder reportedly rejected an offer of 5.5 million euros ($6.6m) per season to stay and insists his motivation to leave is not based on money. ""I has never been about money, otherwise I would have accepted the second improved offer,"" Meyer told Bild on Monday. ""That's why I find it a mess that Clemens Toennies went on television and said it was all about money. ""I simply did not want to stay with Schalke and work under Mr Heidel. ""That is what it's all about -- lately it has felt like bullying to me."" Just hours after the interview was posted on Bild's website, Meyer was suspended."
83,30/04/2018,13:26,Rare blank for Salah as Nigerian 'Simy' bags brace,"Prolific Liverpool scorer Mohamed Salah had a rare goalless outing at the weekend, leaving little unknown Nigerian 'Simy' to star among Africans in Europe with a Serie A brace.","Egyptian Salah failed to score in an English Premier League match at Anfield for the first time since December as lowly Stoke City greatly exceeded expectations to force a 0-0 draw. In Italy, 'Simy' struck twice to help Crotone whip higher-placed Sassuolo 4-1 and climb three points above the danger zone. MOHAMED SALAH (Liverpool) In a season where he has already scored a remarkable 31 Premier League goals, to suggest the Egypt forward might miss a relatively straightforward chance was to invite ridicule. Yet that is what happened to Salah during Liverpool's goalless draw at home to Stoke -- the first time since a match against Swansea on December 26 last year that Salah has not scored on home turf in the Premier League. He had Liverpool's best chance when, in the fifth minute, he clipped the ball over Stoke goalkeeper Jack Butland only for his shot to miss the target. Proof he is fallible after all. WILFRIED ZAHA (Crystal Palace) The Ivory Coast forward was in superb form as Palace thrashed Leicester 5-0 to all but assure themselves of top-flight survival. He crowned a brilliant passing move to open the scoring in the 17th minute, then set up the second goal for James McArthur before drawing a foul which resulted in Marc Albrighton being sent off. IDRISSA GUEYE (Everton) Best known as a defensive midfielder, the Senegal international scored his first goal of 2018 when he drilled in a shot 13 minutes from time to secure Everton's 2-0 win at Huddersfield. The goal capped an impressive display where Gueye's industry was equalled by his eye for a pass. AMATH NDIAYE DIEDHIOU (Getafe) The young Senegalese put his club ahead midway through the first half of a 1-1 home draw against Girona. Both clubs are challenging for 2018/2019 Europa League places. KALIDOU KOULIBALY (Napoli) Senegal defender Koulibaly, a hero just a week ago when he scored the last-gasp header that kept Napoli's title ambitions alive with a 1-0 win over Juventus in Turin, turned villain in Florence when he was sent off after just eight minutes. Ten-man Napoli crumbled to a 3-0 defeat against Fiorentina that leaves their title challenge in tatters. Second-placed Napoli are four points behind champions Juventus with just three games left. 'SIMY' (Crotone) Nigerian forward Simeon 'Simy' Tochukwu Nwankwo grabbed a brace as Crotone moved away from the relegation zone with a 4-1 win over Sassuolo. The 25-year-old nodded in the first off a corner after quarter of an hour and added a second in the final minute in Calabria. It was the third consecutive game that 'Simy' has scored in for the southerners. MUSA BARROW (Atalanta) Gambian forward Barrow, 19, scored the opening goal after 16 minutes as Atalanta continued their push for Europa League football next season with a 3-1 win over Genoa, which extended their unbeaten run to eight games. It was the second goal with the senior team for Barrow. NABIL BENTALEB (Schalke 04) The Algeria midfielder lasted just 13 minutes of second-place Schalke's 1-1 draw at home to Borussia Moenchengladbach before being sent off. He was shown a straight red card for pushing Lars Stindl in the face. NABY KEITA (RB Leipzig) Liverpool-bound Keita earned his fourth red card of the season after two bookings in quick succession at the end of Leipzig's 3-0 defeat at Mainz. Keita saw red for fouling Mainz scorers Alexandru Maxim and Bote Baku, which was ""completely unnecessary"", said Leipzig captain Willi Orban. Keita has now been sent off three times for Leipzig and once for Guinea in the 2017/18 season. ISMAIL TRAORE (Angers) The France-born Ivory Coast defender produced a late leveller to earn Angers a 1-1 draw against Europa League semi-finalists Marseille, the stalemate putting the breaks on the southern giants' bid for Champions League football next season. Florian Thauvin's third-minute penalty looked to have secured Marseille the three points until Traore's header in the 79th minute. The 31-year-old rose highest at the back post to meet Flavien Tait's free-kick from deep on the left and fire a header past a rooted Yohann Pele and into the bottom corner for his third goal of the season."
84,29/04/2018,14:29,'My World Cup dream is over' admits Germany's Stindl,"Lars Stindl admits his World Cup dream is over as he awaits an ankle operation, capping a bad week for injuries to Germany players.","Stindl was helped off the pitch in the first half of Borussia Moenchengladbach's 1-1 draw with Schalke on Saturday. An examination has revealed torn ligaments in the left ankle, ruling him out of the finals in Russia, which kick-off on June 14. ""To injure yourself so badly at this time is very hard,"" said Stindl on crutches in Moenchengladbach with his foot in a cast on Sunday. ""For one thing, I can't help the (Moenchengladbach) team in an important part of the season, on the other, it is bitter that my World Cup dream is over."" Stindl, who scored the winning goal in last July's Confederations Cup final in St Petersburg, is the latest Germany international to have had his World Cup dreams dashed. Hoffenheim's ex-Arsenal winger Serge Gnabry was also ruled out on Friday after tearing his groin against Hanover. While Stindl and Gnabry are out of World Cup contention, Bayern Munich stars Manuel Neuer and Jerome Boateng are battling to be fit. Boateng picked up a groin injury against Real Madrid last Wednesday, while Neuer has missed the last seven months recovering from a fractured metatarsal. Head coach Germany Loew will name Germany's World Cup squad on May 15. Loew has said he is planning on Neuer, Germany's captain and star goalkeeper, being involved for their pre-World Cup camp from May 23 to June 7 in northern Italy. ""Of course he will have to catch up a bit,"" commented Loew, with Neuer having last played in September. Germany begin their defence of the World Cup title against Mexico in Moscow on June 17."
85,22/04/2018,20:51,Risse scores 'saddest' goal as Cologne face drop,"Marcel Risse gave bottom-side Cologne faint hope of avoiding relegation from the Bundesliga with the ""saddest"" equaliser of his career in Sunday's 2-2 draw at home to Schalke.","The dead-ball expert punched the air after his speculative free-kick beat Schalke goalkeeper Ralf Faehrmann on 84 minutes. Risse's equaliser cancelled out Schalke's early goals by Yevhen Konoplyanka and Breel Embolo before Leon Bittencourt pulled one back. ""That's one of the saddest goals I have scored in my career,"" Risse, 28, said. ""It's a very emotional mood, because week after week, it's becoming clearer that relegation is approaching."" With just three games left, and Bundesliga champions Bayern Munich still to come, Cologne remain eight points from safety with only a mathematical chance of surviving after three seasons back in Germany's top flight. Several Cologne players shed tears after the final whistle. The point rewarded the hosts for coming back from 2-0 down against second-placed Schalke, whose coach Domenico Tedesco slammed their performance. ""Our style was good in the first half, but you cannot play more arrogantly or handle the chances we had with more negligence,"" he fumed after Schalke wasted several opportunities. In pouring rain, Schalke raced into a 2-0 lead in the opening 24 minutes with Konoplyanka causing havoc. The Ukrainian cut inside from the left wing and squared for Embolo to fire into an empty net on four minutes. Cologne battled away, but Schalke scored again. Konoplyanka again cut in from the left, beat a defender and curled his shot past Cologne's goalkeeper Timo Horn for a stunning goal. Cologne pulled one back two minutes later. Germany defender Jonas Hector played midfielder Leonardo Bittencourt into the Schalke box to smash his shot home. With time running out, Risse's free-kick beat Faehrmann from 30 metres for the equaliser. Earlier, Iceland international Alfred Finnbogason set up one goal and scored another as Augsburg ran out 2-0 winners over beat relegation-threatened Mainz. Michael Gregoritsch got the opener before Finnbogason sealed the win that ended any doubt Augsburg would remain in the top flight for next season. They are in the security of mid-table, while Mainz remain level on points with Freiburg, who occupy the relegation play-off berth with three games remaining. Hamburg and Cologne sit in the bottom two and look set to drop down automatically into the second tier. Finnbogason was part of the Iceland side that reached the quarter-finals of Euro 2016 and is set to be part of his country's squad at the World Cup in Russia. He produced a superb piece of skill to set up the first-half opener for the unmarked Gregoritsch to tap-in. Just before the final whistle, the burly Icelandic striker fired home his 12th Bundesliga goal of the season. He then earned himself a yellow card as he ripped off his shirt in celebration."
86,16/04/2018,18:12,Schalke sacking was a 'punch in face' says Boateng,"Eintracht Frankfurt midfielder Kevin-Prince Boateng says his departure from Schalke felt ""like a punch in the face"" with the clubs to clash in Wednesday's German Cup semi-final.","Boateng, 31, still carries bad memories after being released by Schalke in December 2015, six months after he was suspended over a ""lack of mutual trust"", as the club put it. Boateng did not see eye-to-eye with Schalke's then-coach Roberto Di Matteo. Now he has the chance to avenge his departure with a win at Gelsenkirchen in Wednesday's semi. ""It's the place I have thought the most about - it was like a punch in the face,"" he told sport1.de. ""It showed me the reality that everything is wonderful when it runs smoothly. And if not, you will be dropped. ""That was the (low) point for me. ""And I can be proud today that I came out of there and could turn all that power, sadness, energy and aggressiveness into something positive."" He said it had opened his eyes to how fast things can go in the football business world. ""Sometimes it's just better to split up, because then you can make a fresh start."" Boateng wants to beat his ex-club to put Frankfurt in their second German Cup final in as many years. Bayern Munich face Bayer Leverkusen away in Tuesday's other last four clash. ""Schalke has shown this year that the team plays at a very high level,"" said Boateng. ""Even if it's not always pretty, they know how to bring home, or keep, the points. ""That's what makes them outstanding. ""I hope we learned our lesson that a 2-0 lead is not enough,"" he added. Schalke, under current coach Domenico Tedesco, came from two-goals down to claim a 2-2 draw in Frankfurt in the league last December. Boateng has been a driving force in Frankfurt's midfield this season after quitting Spanish side Las Palmas last August for family reasons. After Schalke sacked him, Boateng rebuilt his career at AC Milan before a season at Las Palmas. He has rediscovered his best form this season under Frankfurt's head coach Niko Kovac, a former team-mate at Hertha Berlin. Frankfurt crashed to a 4-1 league defeat at Leverkusen on Saturday, the day after it emerged Kovac will coach Bayern next season. ""At the end of the day, we know that's football -- it can happen,"" Boateng said after defeat dropped Frankfurt to seventh -- outside the European places for next season. ""We did a great job up to now and we want to finish the season the way we started it. ""We want to reach our targets and we'll see what's going to happen with the rest."""
87,13/04/2018,02:07,Dortmund out to settle score in derby duel at Schalke,Borussia Dortmund head to neighbours Schalke for Sunday's high-profile Bundesliga clash still smarting after their arch rivals came from four-goals down last time in the 'Ruhr derby of the century'.,"""We are really up for it, especially when you remember the home game,"" said Dortmund's sports director Michael Zorc before the 174th derby in Gelsenkirchen. Dortmund are still sore after Schalke scored four unanswered second-half goals in a frenetic 4-4 draw at Borussia's Signal Iduna Park last November. Brazil defender Naldo dramatically equalised with a 94th-minute header just before the final whistle to cap a remarkable fight back. ""If the game had gone on a minute longer, we would have probably conceded the next goal,"" admitted goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller after Dortmund's defence collapsed. ""I was glad when the referee whistled, it was a relief for us. I came off feeling ashamed."" The match was dubbed the 'Ruhr derby of the century' because no team had ever previously came from 4-0 down in the fixture's 92-year history. Bragging rights aside, key Bundesliga points are up for grabs in Sunday's derby. Bayern Munich, the confirmed champions, are 20 points clear of Schalke in the table, but Dortmund are a point behind in third. They can leap-frog the Royal Blues into second place with a win in Gelsenkirchen. Schalke took second-place from Dortmund just over a month ago and tensions are running high between the clubs. Only 36 kilometres (22 miles) separate them and police in Gelsenkirchen are on high alert with no love lost in one of European football's fiercest derbies. ""This isn't just a game like any other -- you can feel the tension,"" said Schalke striker Guido Burgstaller. For Dortmund, the goal is simple, ""if we win, we move past Schalke"" said midfielder Nuri Sahin. The top game on Saturday sees Bayern host Borussia Moenchengladbach at the Allianz Arena with one eye on next Tuesday's German Cup semi-final at Leverkusen. Having reached the Champions League semi-finals in mid-week, Bayern are now the only European team left still in contention for the treble this season. Head coach Jupp Heynckes is likely to rotate his squad against Gladbach. Bayern are waiting to see how Javi Martinez recovers from a bruised his knee. James Rodriguez also hurt his thigh in Wednesday's draw at home to Sevillla which put Bayern into the last four in Europe. Behind Bayern, Schalke have the second best defence in the league, conceding 33 goals to Munich's 21. The Royal Blues' back four will be tested by Michy Batshuayi, who has scored seven goals in nine league games since joining Dortmund on loan from Chelsea. Borussia hope to have Marco Reus running their attack with the Germany star having scored six goals in 12 games against Schalke. The Royal Blues are smarting from last weekend's shock 3-2 defeat at Hamburg, who moved off the bottom of the table with their first league win since November. Dortmund have had the better of recent derbies and have not lost any of their last five clashes with Schalke, but the last three encounters were draws. Schalke coach Domenico Tedesco described it as 'hell' being 4-0 down at Dortmund and wants no repeat at home. ""I still get goosebumps when I think about it,"" said Burgstaller, who scored Schalke's first goal in the fight back. ""We definitely don't want to be 4-0 down again at half-time.""

In the dying minutes of the half, Ribery twinkle-toed his way through the defence to set up Lewandowski's second, before getting on the scoresheet himself with Bayern's fifth, lofting the ball elegantly over goalkeeper Roman Burki. ""We were totally absent today,"" said Dortmund defender Marcel Schmelzer. ""Bayern just played cat and mouse with us. It was a disgrace, and it can't go on like this.""

Bayern's title celebrations remain on hold after Schalke eased to a 2-0 victory over Freiburg earlier in the day.

Having danced around several defenders to fire in a net-busting opener in the first half, Gnabry grabbed a second just after half-time, picking out the bottom corner from the edge of the box. Cologne-born forward Mark Uth grabbed a brace, as he and Lukas Rupp scored three goals in the space of 10 minutes. Uth then set up Steven Zuber to prod home Hoffenheim's sixth."

Having danced around several defenders to fire in a net-busting opener in the first half, Gnabry grabbed a second just after half-time, picking out the bottom corner from the edge of the box. Cologne-born forward Mark Uth grabbed a brace, as he and Lukas Rupp scored three goals in the space of 10 minutes. Uth then set up Steven Zuber to prod home Hoffenheim's sixth."
90,03/03/2018,21:16,Three-star Reus targets World Cup after Dortmnd leveller,Marco Reus underlined his brilliant return from a serious knee injury by scoring in his third straight Bundesliga game on Saturday as Borussia Dortmund drew 1-1 at RB Leipzig.,"After eight months sidelined having torn his cruciate knee ligament in last May's German Cup final, Germany winger Reus now has three goals in four games. Having missed Germany's 2014 World Cup victory with torn ankle ligaments and Euro 2016 with a groin injury, the fleet-footed Reus is even more determined to help defend the global title at Russia 2018. ""I'd be lying if I said that I didn't think about the World Cup and really want to be there,"" he told Bundesliga.com before kick-off. ""I won't make a secret of the fact it's a big goal of mine to be there. I know I've got a good chance, if I'm playing well."" Reus was a constant threat on Saturday and involved in the build up when striker Michy Batshuayi tapped home on 16 minutes, but Andre Schuerrle, who supplied the final pass, was offside. Leipzig took the lead when Liverpool-bound Naby Keita, back after a thigh injury, played a pass through Dortmund's defence which Jean-Kevin Augustin tucked away on 29 minutes. Having also had an earlier goal flagged for offside, Reus made no mistake at the second attempt, sprinting onto Batshuayi's well-timed pass and equalised seven minutes from half time. With an hour gone, Batshuayi, on loan from Chelsea, bungled the chance to grab the winner with the goal at his mercy. Leipzig, who picked up a point after three defeats, stay sixth. Dortmund coach Peter Stoeger is unbeaten in his ten league games in charge. ""I am happy with the 90 minutes, we are in the group fighting for Champions League places, it'll stay that way until the end of the season, and our goal is to qualify,"" said the Austrian. The result leaves Dortmund third after Schalke had earlier snatched second spot with a 1-0 home win against Hertha Berlin. Marko Pjaca, on loan from Juventus, claimed his second goal in five league games when Daniel Caligiuri whipped in a cross and Franco di Santo let the ball roll to Pjaca, who scored on 37 minutes. Schalke are 17 points behind runaway leaders Bayern, who play mid-table Freiburg on Sunday. Reports Bayern approached Freiburg boss Christian Streich last month to replace Jupp Heynckes as head coach next season have added extra spice to the game. Eintracht Frankfurt are fourth after their 1-0 win at home to mid-table Hanover as defender Danny da Costa scored their winner. Argentina striker Lucas Alario converted a first-half penalty and Julian Brandt scored with a superb chip as Bayer Leverkusen consolidated fifth place with a 2-1 win at ten-man Wolfsburg. Admir Mehmedi scored the consolation effort for Wolfsburg against his former club. The hosts finished with ten men when Brazilian left-back William was sent off for a second yellow card in added time. It finished goalless, but there was plenty of drama in Hamburg's basement battle at home to Mainz. Hamburg winger Filip Kostic hit the woodwork and had a goal ruled off side in the first half. Mainz had Nigeria defender Leon Balogun sent off for a second yellow card when he fouled Luca Waldschmidt in the area on 61 minutes. The referee pointed to the spot, but Kostic's weak attempt was saved by goalkeeper Florian Mueller on his Bundesliga debut. Hamburg are now seven points behind 16th-placed Mainz and on course for a first relegation in the club's history. ""Giving up is not in my nature, but we need a small miracle,"" admitted Hamburg coach Bernd Hollerbach. Having been booed by his own fans last weekend, the pressure eased on Hoffenheim coach Julian Nagelsmann with a 2-0 win at Augsburg. Croatia striker Andrej Kramaric scored for the fifth match in a row before Germany winger Serge Gnabry added a superb second after the break."
91,27/02/2018,14:03,Meyer set to quit Schalke after rejecting new deal,Schalke 04 are set to lose another key young player for next season amidst reports on Tuesday that Max Meyer has turned down a lucrative contract extension.,"Meyer, a 22-year-old midfield dynamo who was linked to Arsenal in January, has so far refused a reported new salary offer of 5.5 million euros ($6.7m) a year. ""At the moment, we're still ready to talk, but we have to plan for the new season,"" Schalke's director of sport Christian Heidel told Kicker magazine. Germany midfielder Leon Goretzka, 23, has already said he is joining Bayern Munich next season while Meyer is out of contract with Schalke in June. Some reports suggested he wants to stay in Germany and fight for a place at Bayern alongside Goretzka. Schalke are currently third in Germany's top flight behind runaway leaders Munich. Under Schalke's coach Domenico Tedesco, Meyer has shone in an encouraging season after struggling last year under Markus Weinzierl. Meyer, a robust defensive midfielder who is skilful on the ball and has quick feet, has also been linked to Spanish giants Barcelona. He captained Germany to the silver medal at the 2016 Olympic Games, losing to Brazil on penalties in the final in Rio de Janeiro. Schalke are on course for a Champions League berth next season, but with Goretzka already leaving, Meyer's departure would be another significant loss. The Bundesliga club is putting Meyer under pressure to commit one way or the other. ""Domenico Tedesco has formed the team around him, so that Max Meyer is now in an ideal position,"" Heidel told magazine Sport Bild. ""That wasn't the case before. He has to think, regardless of the economic aspect, 'would I be in this position at another club?'"""
92,23/02/2018,02:10,Five things to look out for in the Bundesliga,"Bayern Munich coach Jupp Heynckes will be chasing a 38-year-old club record when his team host Hertha Berlin on Saturday, but will do so without the injured James Rodriguez.","Heynckes is looking to become the first Bayern coach to win 15 games in a row as his team look to consolidate a commanding 19-point lead at the top of the Bundesliga. Second-place Borussia Dortmund host Augsburg on Monday, with fans from both sides set to boycott the game. Elsewhere, Bruno Labbadia takes charge of Wolfsburg for the first time against Mainz on Friday, while RB Leipzig look set to host Cologne without star midfielder Naby Keita. Here are five things to look out for in this weekend's Bundesliga action: Jupp Heynckes has worked wonders since returning to Bayern Munich, and on Saturday he looks set to break an incredible club record. Heynckes, who has led Bayern to 23 victories in 24 games since October, could now become the first Bayern coach ever to win 15 games in a row. The 72-year-old watched his side romp to victory over Besiktas in midweek to pick up a 14th consecutive win, equalling a club record set under Pal Csernai back in 1980. Bayern are expected to be without James Rodriguez, who was forced to leave the pitch after 44 minutes against Besiktas with a calf problem. A diagnosis on Wednesday confirmed that the Colombian will be out of action for no more than a few days. More fan protests are expected this Monday when Borussia Dortmund take on Augsburg in the Bundesliga's second Monday night fixture. Last week's inaugural Monday game saw fierce protests from Eintracht Frankfurt fans, who blew whistles and held up banners in protest at the new scheduling. This Monday, both Dortmund and Augsburg fan groups are expected to continue protests. Around 300 Dortmund fan clubs have reportedly signed up to a boycott led by the influential fan group ""Suedtribuene Dortmund"". ""We accept every opinion and every protest, as long as it is carried out peacefully,"" said Dortmund CEO Hans-Joachim Watzke. RB Leipzig will be without star midfielder Naby Keita when they host Cologne on Sunday evening. The Guinean midfielder left the field after just an hour in Leipzig's defeat to Frankfurt on Monday, having pulled his hamstring. Captain Willi Orban is also a doubt after suffering a cut to his knee in a collision with Frankfurt's Sebastien Haller on Monday. Coach Ralph Hasenhuettl, though, claimed that the injuries were not a disaster for his team, as Leipzig look to muscle their way back into the top four this weekend. ""We have enough quality to replace both of them,"" insisted Hasenhuettl. Bruno Labbadia takes charge of Wolfsburg for the first time on Friday evening, as the Wolves travel to Mainz for a crucial bottom of the table clash. Labbadia took charge of the struggling Wolves after Martin Schmidt's sudden resignation earlier this week, and is now tasked with leading the club back to safety. ""We have to use every hour available to us,"" said Labbadia. ""I will demand of my players that they invest everything into this fight."" Relegation threatened Hamburg find themselves in last chance saloon ahead of Saturday's visit to arch rivals Werder Bremen. Hamburg have not won in 10 games, and are now six points from safety as they prepare for a must-win game over fellow strugglers Bremen. ""The derby is coming just at the right time,"" said Hamburg's Aaron Hunt. ""It is a great chance for us to turn things around.""

93,20/02/2018,14:29,Fifefighter call-out leaves Tekpetey red-faced,"Ghana international Bernard Tekpetey was left red-faced after firefighters had to break into his home to deal with a smoking cooking pot while he was at a Bundesliga match, reports in Germany said.","The 20-year-old right winger, who is back at Schalke 04 after a loan spell in Austria, was an unused replacement for Saturday's 2-1 home win against Hoffenheim. While he sat hoping to come on, with his family watching in Gelsenkirchen, the pot was still cooking. It triggered a fire alarm as smoke poured from the flat. Firefighters forced their way in after a call from the neighbours, according to German daily Bild. The incident happened at 10pm (2100 GMT) local time on Saturday, no one was injured and Tekpetey arrived home half an hour after the drama. The forward made two appearances for Ghana at the 2017 Africa Cup of Nations and has just returned to Schalke after a six-month loan spell at Austrian side Altach. He moved to Schalke from Ghana side Unistar SA in February 2016."
94,18/02/2018,20:50,Five things we learned from the Bundesliga,"Arjen Robben missed his first penalty in six years, but that didn't stop Bayern Munich from snatching victory against Wolfsburg and taking their lead to 19 points. Borussia Dortmund moved up to second after Marco Reus fired them to victory over Borussia Moenchengladbach, but RB Leipzig could yet overtake them with a win against Eintracht Frankfurt on Monday. Elsewhere, Mario Gomez lifted Stuttgart away from the relegation zone with a winner against Augsburg.","Here are five talking points from this weekend's Bundesliga action. Arjen Robben stirred unhappy memories in Bayern Munich's 2-1 win against Wolfsburg, missing a penalty for the first time since the 2012 Champions League Final. Robben's penalty misery six years ago marked a low point in his career, as opponents Chelsea went on to win the title. The Dutchman had not missed a spot-kick since for Bayern until he failed to beat Koen Casteels from 12 yards on Saturday. He would quickly make amends, however, providing the assist for Bayern's equaliser and winning the penalty for Robert Lewandowski's injury-time winner. ""If you pick up an assist and win a penalty after having missed one earlier in the game, I think you can be happy,"" said Robben. Marco Reus marked his return to fitness with a fine goal on Sunday, but it was the playing surface which made the headlines as Borussia Dortmund beat Borussia Moenchengladbach. Ravaged by both cold and wet weather in recent weeks, the pitch at the Borussia Park was in a dreadful condition, and became steadily worse as the game progressed. Referee Bastian Dankert chose to let the game go ahead, however, and bobbling balls and a slippy surface were not enough to stop Reus from lashing in a brilliant first-half winner for Dortmund. Breel Embolo netted what would be the decisive goal in Schalke's 2-1 victory over Hoffenheim on Saturday, and immediately dedicated his winner to the team's video analyst. The Swiss international took advantage of a mistake by Hoffenheim's Kevin Vogt, intercepting a pass across the defensive line and sliding the ball effortlessly past goalkeeper Oliver Baumann. ""At least 80 per cent of the goal belongs to our video analyst,"" admitted Embolo. ""We knew in advance that Vogt has a tendency to play brave passes, and that sometimes he is too brave."" Mario Gomez will be hoping that his winner for Stuttgart on Sunday will have caught the eye of Germany coach Joachim Loew. The 32-year-old has his sights set on a return to the national team set-up for this summer's World Cup in Russia. ""Joachim Loew knows that he can rely on me,"" he told Welt. ""The important thing is that he sees I am fit, that I have energy and self-confidence. At the moment, I have all those things, 100 per cent."" Gomez certainly showed that on Sunday, as his first-half strike inspired Stuttgart to a first away win of the season. The video assistant referee was once again the subject of controversy. Cologne were left furious when Claudio Pizarro's late winner against Hanover was ruled out with the help of VAR, and there was confusion in Augsburg after Michael Gregoritsch's equaliser was disallowed after a full two minutes of discussion. ""It's not about whether the decision is right or not, it's that it seems arbitrary when the referee chooses to use VAR,"" said Cologne goalkeeper Timo Horn. ""Anyone who loves football has lost something this season."""
95,17/02/2018,20:44,Last-gasp Lewandowski penalty rescues Bayern at Wolfsburg,Robert Lewandowski converted a 91st-minute penalty to rescue Bundesliga leaders Bayern Munich with a 2-1 win at Wolfsburg on Saturday which took their winning streak to 13 and extended their advantage at the top of the table to 21 points.,"With Bayern hosting Besiktas in the last 16, first leg of the Champions League on Tuesday, they rested several stars and were almost made to pay. Wolfsburg striker Daniel Didavi gave the hosts an early lead while Bayern winger Arjen Robben had a second-half penalty saved. However, Sandro Wagner headed Bayern level in the 64th minute before substitute Lewandowski hit the winning penalty in injury time. The win stretched Bayern's runaway lead to 21 points as they steam towards a sixth straight title. ""This will to win games, even though it does not seem to be exciting at the top (of the table), makes it fun. This team is just awesome,"" said Bayern captain Thomas Mueller. Bayern coach Jupp Heynckes named a weakened team with David Alaba, Jerome Boateng, Mats Hummels, Joshua Kimmich, Mueller and Lewandowski starting on the bench. Wolfsburg profited from Bayern's slow start after only eight minutes when Yunus Malli's cross was headed home by Didavi. Bayern winger Franck Ribery was then booked when the video referee spotted he had swatted Renato Steffen in the face in a challenge for the ball. It was 1-0 at the break, but Bayern were awarded a penalty when Steffen barged over Corentin Tolisso in the area on 53 minutes. Steffen was booked for his furious protest, but Wolfsburg goalkeeper Koen Casteels palmed Robben's spot-kick onto the post. Bayern drew level when Robben's cross was met in the middle by Wagner -- Lewandowski's back-up -- to head home on 64 minutes. Heynckes responded by bringing on Mueller, Alaba and Lewandowski in the final half an hour. When Germany Under-19 international Gian-Luca Itter pulled Robben back in the area, the referee pointed to the spot. Casteels got a glove to the ball, but Lewandowski claimed his 20th league goal this season with the last-gasp penalty. RB Leipzig are at Eintracht Frankfurt in the Bundesliga's first Monday night kick-off, which allowed Bayer Leverkusen to climb to second with a 2-1 win at Hamburg. Leon Bailey continued his stellar season by rounding Hamburg's goalkeeper Christian Mathenia on 40 minutes. It was the 20-year-old Jamaican's ninth league goal this season. Leverkusen's 18-year-old striker Kai Havertz doubled their lead after the break, finishing a move Bailey started. Hamburg forward Andre Hahn came off the bench to claim a consolation goal. Schalke climbed to fifth with a 2-1 win at home to Hoffenheim, whose captain Kevin Vogt gave away the winning goal with a howler of an error. With Schalke 1-0 up in Gelsenkirchen, Vogt's lazy pass across his goal was intercepted by Breel Embolo. With Hoffenheim's goalkeeper out of position the Swiss striker tapped into an empty net on 28 minutes, before Andrej Kramaric headed a consolation goal for the visitors. The result leaves just a point separating second-placed Leverkusen from Schalke in fifth. Freiburg captain Nils Petersen converted a first-half penalty in their 1-0 win at home to Werder Bremen in persistent falling snow. The win ended Freiburg's three-match run without a victory while Bremen stay just above the relegation places. Bottom side Cologne remain nine points from safety as they drew 1-1 at home to Hanover. Japan striker Yuya Osako gave Cologne an early lead before Hanover forward Niclas Fuellkrug equalised with his 10th league goal of the season. In the dying stages, 39-year-old Claudio Pizarro came off the Cologne bench and had the ball in the net, but his header was ruled offside. On Sunday, Borussia Dortmund can go second with a win at Borussia Moenchengladbach as Michy Batshuayi looks to add to his five goals in three games."
96,26/01/2018,13:25,Chelsea's Baba to be loaned to Schalke,"Chelsea's Ghana international left-back Abdul Rahman Baba is set to spend a second loan period at German club Schalke, according to reports.","Kicker magazine says the 23-year-old will undergo a medical examination in Gelsenkirchen before agreeing the loan deal. ""It looks like we can bring together what Chelsea envisages and what Schalke imagine,"" said director of sport Christian Heidel. If the deal goes through, Baba would be Schalke's third signing this January after forward Cedric Teuchert, 20, from Nuremberg and Marko Pjaca, 22, from Juventus. Croatia striker Pjaca netted his first goal for Schalke in last Sunday's 1-1 home draw against Hanover 96 which left them third in the table. Baba joined Chelsea for 10 million euros ($12.4 million) from Augsburg in 2015, but already spent the 2016-2017 season on loan at Schalke. He played 21 matches for the Royal Blues before tearing his cruciate knee ligament in January 2017 and the loan deal ended at the end of last season. He has only made a handful of appearances for Chelsea's reserves this season as he bids to regain fitness. Schalke hope Baba can take part in his first training session next week. He will be battling Bastian Oczipka for the left-back berth."
97,21/01/2018,20:42,Schalke threaten to drop Bayern-bound Goretzka,Schalke's chairman on Sunday threatened to banish Bayern Munich-bound midfielder Leon Goretzka to the stands for the rest of the season if he fails to perform for the Bundesliga club.,"The two sides confirmed on Friday that Goretzka, 22, will join Bayern next season on a free transfer after five years with Schalke. The Gelsenkirchen-based club say they did ""everything possible"" to keep the talented midfielder. Club chairman Clemens Toennies has said he will insist Goretzka be banished to the stands if he underperforms in his time left at the Royal Blues. ""I hope he will play a second-half to the season of his life,"" Toennies told Sky Sports News. ""However, if it is better for the team, then it could also be the case that Leon Goretzka sits until the end of the season in the stands."" Schalke fans made their feelings known before Sunday's home match against Hanover 96 as Goretzka was jeered and booed after being named in the starting line-up. ""Neither dosh nor titles are worth more than our club! If you do not appreciate that, you can piss off now!"" read one banner on the terraces, while another stated: ""1000 friends let down for emotionless titles and superficial flash Harries."" Goretzka admitted the jeers and whistles had got to him. ""When your own fans boo you, of course it hurts, but I can understand it and the main thing is that the reaction didn't affect the team,"" he said. The midfielder broke into the Germany squad when a young team minus their World Cup-winning stars lifted the Confederations Cup in Russia last July by beating Chile 1-0 in the final. He is poised to retain his Germany place for this summer's World Cup, but his chances of playing in Russia will be damaged if Toennies follows through with his extraordinary threat. ""I am not declaring myself as his enemy, but we can't allow the goals of the club to be endangered,"" Toennies added. The Schalke boss feels Goretzka is joining Bayern too soon as he follows the path trodden by Germany captain Manuel Neuer, who also quit Schalke for Bayern in 2011. ""Personally, I think it's too early. He should have stayed two more years and then gone as a big star,"" said Toennies. ""It was his decision, we have to accept that and Schalke 04 won't go under because of it."""

99,19/01/2018,16:35,Germany star Goretzka to join Bayern next season,"Schalke 04 confirmed Friday that Germany midfielder Leon Goretzka will join Bayern Munich for next season on a free transfer, with the Bundesliga leaders beating Liverpool to his signature.","""Leon Goretzka informed us at the start of the week that he wants to leave the club and will join FC Bayern,"" said Schalke sporting director Christian Heidel. ""We did everything to keep Leon at Schalke."" The 22-year-old completed a medical in Munich on Thursday and has signed a contract until June 30, 2022, Bayern later revealed on their website. ""We are very happy that Leon Goretzka has decided to join Bayern, despite considerable competition from abroad,"" said Bayern chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge after Barcelona and Juventus were also linked to Goretzka. ""This ensures that Leon Goretzka remains in the Bundesliga."" The midfielder has vowed to help Schalke finish in the top four this season, to earn a Champions League place, and to lift German Cup as his parting gift. ""I know it will disappoint everyone, but anyone who knows me, just a little bit, knows I will give my all, as usual,"" he said. ""I want to lead Schalke back into the Champions League and win the German Cup in Berlin on May 19. ""The five years at Schalke will stay firmly in my heart and mind."" Goretzka, 22, has scored six goals in 12 appearances for his country. He made his breakthrough at the 2017 Confederations Cup, where he helped a Germany side missing their World Cup-winning stars beat Chile 1-0 in the final. The right-footed Goretzka joined Schalke from VfL Bochum in 2013 and has scored 19 goals in 130 games for the Royal Blues. He can play as a deep-lying midfielder, winger or attacking midfielder and his versatility will be a bonus for Bayern, whose head coach Jupp Heynckes welcomed the move. ""He has developed really well, is intelligent and performance-oriented, he can bring a new impulse,"" said Heynckes in Munich."
100,14/01/2018,09:39,Liverpool-bound Keita hits wonder goal for Leipzig,Naby Keita showed why Liverpool want to sign him in this transfer window by scoring a superb goal for RB Leipzig in Saturday's 3-1 Bundesliga win over Schalke.,"The 22-year-old Guinea midfielder, who already has a contract with Liverpool to join them next season, showed his class with a thunderbolt of a shot to give Leipzig the lead just before half-time. The result lifted Leipzig to second, 13 points behind leaders Bayern Munich who won 3-1 at Bayer Leverkusen on Friday, while Schalke drop to third. Liverpool reportedly want to bring Keita to Merseyside early after losing Philippe Countinho, who signed for Barcelona last week for 160 million euros ($192 million). However, before kick-off, Leipzig's director of sport Ralf Rangnick insisted Keita will not leave until the end of the season. ""There is no offer from any club, we found a solution last year in September and I expect him to play 19 more games with us,"" Rangnick told Sky. Jurgen Klopp's Liverpool are set to pay around 70 million euros for the midfielder, but reports say they would pay an extra 15 million for Keita to join them early. After Leipzig's Jean-Kevin Augustin had a penalty saved by Schalke goalkeeper Ralf Fahrmann, Keita struck by rifling a shot home off his right boot on 41 minutes. He was taken off after fouling Alessandro Schoepf on 54 minutes -- his fifth booking this season which means he is suspended for next Saturday's game against Freiburg. Schalke drew level on 55 minutes when Brazil defender Naldo headed home, but Leipzig sealed the win with two goals in quick succession as Timo Werner came off the bench to score on 69 minutes after great work from Emil Forsberg. Portugal midfielder Bruma then slammed home a third goal two minutes later as Schalke suffered a first loss in 13 games, a run stretching back to September. Earlier, Nigel de Jong made an unhappy return to the Bundesliga by conceding a first-half penalty as Mainz threw away the lead in a 3-2 defeat at Hanover. The defensive midfielder played for the Netherlands in the 2010 World Cup final defeat by Spain and won the 2012 Premier League title with Manchester City. The 33-year-old, who played for Hamburg between 2006 and 2009, has signed for Mainz until the end of the season. His new club claimed early goals by Japan striker Yoshinori Muto and Alexander Hack. However, after Hanover striker Niclas Fuellkrug made it 2-1 with a header towards the end of the first half, De Jong brought down midfielder Felix Klaus in the area and the referee pointed to the spot. Fuellkrug netted the resulting penalty on 38 minutes, then hit the winning goal 15 minutes from time to complete his hat-trick. The defeat leaves Mainz 15th in the table, just a point above the bottom three, while Hanover climb to 10th. There was a happier return for Germany striker Mario Gomez, back at Stuttgart after an eight-year gap, as he helped seal a 1-0 win at home to Hertha Berlin. With time running out, former Bayern forward Gomez was brought down in the area by Hertha's Niklas Stark. While the German international was appealing for a penalty, the ball looped off Stark's boot and into the net for the winning own goal on 78 minutes. The result leaves Stuttgart 12th, one place below Hertha, who hit the post through Austria international Valentino Lazaro in the first half. Elsewhere, Augsburg climbed to seventh with a 1-0 win over strugglers Hamburg thanks to a winning header by South Korea international Koo Ja-Cheol. Eintracht Frankfurt blew the chance to jump from ninth to third after French striker Sebastien Haller gave them a lead at home to Freiburg, who equalised through a header by defender Robin Koch in the second half in a 1-1 draw. Werder Bremen and Hoffenheim played out a 1-1 draw as Czech international Theodor Gebre Selassie's second-half goal for hosts Bremen cancelled out Benjamin Huebner's first-half header."
101,15/12/2017,02:09,Tedesco heads crop of young Bundesliga coaches,Domenico Tedesco has steered sleeping giants Schalke to second place in the Bundesliga with the 32-year-old part of a crop of young coaches enjoying success in Germany's top flight.,"The Royal Blues of Gelsenkirchen took a gamble at the start of the season by plucking Tedesco from second-division Erzgebirge Aue to revitalise their squad. As a result, Schalke are on ten-match unbeaten run for the first time in nine years and leave their fans dreaming of a return to the Champions League. It is more than six years since they made the semi-finals, spearheaded by Spanish striker Raul, beating Valencia and Inter Milan en route to a 6-1 aggregate defeat by Manchester United in the last four of Europe. Having nurtured talented fleet-footed Morocco winger Amine Harit, 20, and coaxed seven goals from Austria striker Guido Burgstaller, Tedesco now wants to lower expectations. ""The table does not interest me at all,"" said Tedesco, ""we try to ignore it."" But Schalke's recent success cannot be ignored. Tedesco wrote himself into Schalke's footballing folklore when his side came from four goals down at arch-rivals Borussia Dortmund as Naldo's last-gasp equaliser poached a 4-4 draw last month. ""I'm not the hero of the derby, its the team that turned the match, not the coach,"" Tedesco said. Tedesco never played top-flight football, but is passionate about tactics and modern methods of motivation. The expression ""emotional intelligence"" often features in his vocabulary. The Italian-born coach, whose surname ""Tedesco"" means German in the language of his parents, sets high standards and brought order to Schalke's play. However, they are still susceptible to sloppy defending as proved by leaking four goals in 20 minutes at Dortmund and threw away a two-goal lead on Wednesday. Schalke dazzled by racing into a two-goal lead through a deft Franco Di Santo back-heel and a Burgstaller strike before Augsburg fought back to 2-2. Only a late Daniel Caligiuri penalty rescued the three points. Rather than being relieved, Tedesco demanded the squad learn the lessons before Saturday's tough away trip to Kevin-Prince Boateng's Eintracht Frankfurt. Tedesco has brought structure to Schalke's game, demonstrated by the way they kept playing and refused to panic when 4-0 down at Dortmund. ""This team has a plan,"" said sporting director Christian Heidel, ""and very often sticks to it."" Tedesco showed his tough streak on his arrival by dropping World Cup-winner and club captain Benedikt Hoewedes, 29, and the Schalke stalwart left in August on loan at Juventus. Tedesco has nurtured the talent of USA midfielder Weston McKennie, 19, and Morocco's Amine Harit, 20, who are producing consistent performances. ""We owe a lot to the coach,"" said Schalke's defender Bastian Oczipka. ""He has brought in a new sense of purpose, everyone has gotten better."" Tedesco is just the latest in a crop of young coaches given a chance alongside VfB Stuttgart's Hannes Wolf, 36, Mainz's Sandro Schwarz, 39, and Augsburg's Manuel Baum, 38. Yet Tedesco, Wolf, Schwarz and Baum all owe a lot to Hoffenheim's brave decision to appoint Julian Nagelsmann, who was then just 29, as their head coach in February 2016. ""My appointment as head coach certainly paved the way for other young coaches,"" Nagelsmann, now 30, told website Omnisport in August. ""If it would not have worked out for me, Domenico Tedesco and Hannes Wolf would probably not be head coaches in the Bundesliga right now."" The trend of appointing young coaches is not universally popular here. Ex-Germany midfielder Mehmet Scholl described the likes of Tedesco and Nagelsmann as ""system coaches"" who came through the German FA's coaching scheme - ""eleven months of brainwashing"" - to get their coaching licences. Felix Magath, who won the Bundesliga with Wolfsburg in 2009, said they lack experience. He has a point. Nagelsmann was born around the time current Bayern coach Jupp Heynckes started his first stint in charge of the Bavarians in 1987. However, Heynckes, 72, approves of his young rivals Tedesco and Co. ""You should give young coaches a chance and let them make mistakes,"" said Bayern's 2013 treble-winning coach. ""He (Tedesco) is calm on the sidelines, I like that."""
102,25/11/2017,18:36,Naldo saves Schalke in eight-goal derby thriller,Former Borussia Dortmund player Naldo sealed Schalke's thrilling four-goal fightback against his old club with a 94th-minute header that saw the Ruhr derby finish in a frantic 4-4 draw.,"Brazilian defender Naldo's last gasp header brought Schalke back from the dead against troubled, 10-man local rivals Dortmund after going four down after just 25 minutes to snatch a dramatic Bundesliga point. Schalke, who are unbeaten since September, are third in the table, three points ahead of fourth-placed Dortmund, and five behind leader Bayern Munich, who play later at Borussia Moenchengladbach. The hosts had Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang sent off in the 72nd minute for two yellow cards with the score 4-2 after giving Dortmund an early lead, but Borussia's defence collapsed in the second-half. Aubameyang had broken his five-game goal drought in the 2-1 Champions League defeat to Tottenham Hotspur on Tuesday The disastrous defeat increases the pressure on head coach Peter Bosz after leaving Dortmund winless in their last six league games. The biggest win in a Ruhr derby -- 10-0 to Schalke in 1940 -- looked under threat when Dortmund raced into a 4-0 lead. Christian Pulisic's cross was flicked on by Nuri Sahin to the far post where Aubameyang slid the ball home on 12 minutes. Dortmund doubled the lead six minutes later when Sahin's free-kick was volleyed into his own net by Schalke midfielder Benjamin Stambouli, who was then beaten for pace on the flank by Aubameyang, before the Gabon international fired in a superb cross for Mario Goetze to head in the third on 20 minutes. Schalke looked dead and buried when Raphael Guerreiro volleyed home Dortmund's fourth with just 25 minutes on the clock. In a bid to avert a debacle, Schalke coach Domenico Tedesco brought on midfielders Leon Goretzka and 20-year-old Amine Harit on 34 minutes, which tightened things in the middle, and after coming to their senses, it was a totally different story for Schalke in the second-half. The away side won their tackles and pulled their first goal back when Stambouli's long floated pass was headed home by striker Guido Bergstaller on 61 minutes. Harit made it 4-2 four minutes later, taking advantage of terrible defending to fire home at close range. Schalke were now attacking in waves, and Aubameyang was given his marching orders on 72 minutes after clattering Harit and being given his second booking. Dortmund were holding on by their fingernails by the time midfielder Daniel Caligiuri buried Schalke's third on 86 minutes in a frantic finale that included seven minutes of stoppage time. Schalke deservedly got their equaliser when Naldo escaped his marker at a corner and powered home his header, sparking wild celebrations among the travelling fans. Tensions boiled over after the leveller and both Sahin and Schalke captain Ralf Faehrmann received yellow cards after the final whistle as both teams got into a shoving match. Elswehere, RB Leipzig remain second after their 2-0 win at home to second-from-bottom Werder Bremen with goals from Liverpool-bound midfielder Naby Keita and Brazilian defender Bernardo. Bayer Leverkusen moved up to sixth with a 1-0 win at Eintracht Frankfurt with Germany forward Kevin Volland scoring the winner. Michael Gregoritsch and Alfred Finnbogason scored for mid-table Augsburg as they came from behind to seal a 2-1 win over ten-man Wolfsburg, who had Maximilian Arnold sent off after only 11 minutes. That was Wolfsburg's first defeat since losing to Stuttgart in September."
103,24/11/2017,01:55,Struggling Dortmund face must-win Ruhr derby,"Crisis-hit Borussia Dortmund will look to get their crumbling season back on the rails when they face arch rivals Schalke 04 in the Bundesliga on Saturday, as coach Peter Bosz fights to keep his job.","Elsewhere, Bayern Munich hope to consolidate their grip on top spot with a win at Borussia Moenchengladbach, while RB Leipzig host Werder Bremen. This weekend, though, all eyes will be on the Ruhr derby, as Dortmund host Schalke. Dortmund have not won a league game since September, and have lost five of their last nine in all competitions, leaving their hopes of challenging for the title in tatters. Having held a five-point lead at the top of the table earlier in the season, Dortmund are now nine points behind leaders Bayern, having slipped down to fifth place. Among those to have overtaken them are local rivals Schalke, who have climbed up to second, adding even more spice to Saturday's derby. While Dortmund have been the dominant force in the Ruhr in recent years, the German media are now cautiously predicting a shift in power towards Schalke. In terms of both points and pride, the derby is a must-win game for Dortmund. ""We have to win on Saturday. We simply have to win,"" said Bosz after Dortmund's defeat by Tottenham Hotspur on Tuesday. Bosz is under immense pressure to turn things around, his job security dwindling with every defeat. At the beginning of the week, Bild reported that the Dutchman had two games to save himself. Having been knocked out of the Champions League, Saturday's derby may be his last stand. Captain Marcel Schmelzer, however, said that the players, not the coach, were responsible for Dortmund's calamitous defending and ineffective attack. ""We're completely behind Peter Bosz,"" said Schmelzer on Tuesday. ""We as players are responsible. The coach prepares us for every opponent, but we are responsible for what happens on the pitch."" While Dortmund have struggled, Schalke have quietly found form, surging up the standings on the back of a six-game unbeaten run. Schalke's last defeat in a competitive match came back in September and now lead the chasing pack behind Bayern. Victory against Dortmund would see them move six points clear of their local rivals. ""Dortmund's current situation won't play a decisive role,"" goalkeeper Ralf Faehrmann told Kicker. ""The derby is always like a cup game, a knockout game. ""It's a lot about how much heart you have, and we have heart."" Faehrmann and his team will be further heartened by the prospective return of midfield star Leon Goretzka. Sidelined for the last four weeks, Goretzka returned to training on Wednesday, and hopes to make his Bundesliga return in the derby. Elsewhere, Bayern look to bounce back from a difficult week when they travel to Moenchengladbach. Despite winning a ninth game in a row under Jupp Heynckes, Wednesday's 2-1 victory over Anderlecht was an unhappy occasion for Bayern, with both Arjen Robben and Thiago Alcantara picking up injuries. The pair join Manuel Neuer, Thomas Muller and Franck Ribery on Bayern's star-studded injury list, leaving Heynckes with limited options against Gladbach. Sebastian Rudy and Corentin Tolisso are both expected to start on Saturday. Fellow title contenders RB Leipzig, meanwhile, will be full of confidence after their 4-1 win in Monaco on Tuesday. Six points behind Bayern, Leipzig will be looking to narrow the gap this weekend, though they too have injury problems, with Marcel Sabitzer having suffered a blow to the shoulder in midweek.

104,19/11/2017,20:02,Schalke soar to second in Germany,Goals by strikers Franco di Santo and Guido Burgstaller sealed Schalke 04's 2-0 win over Hamburg on Sunday as the Royal Blues climbed to second place in the Bundesliga.,"Under 32-year-old head coach Domenico Tedesco, Schalke are unbeaten in seven games dating back to September, and the home win in Gelsenkirchen moved them second behind leaders Bayern Munich. ""It's a great moment for the whole team, we have worked really heard in the last few weeks,"" said Schalke midfielder Max Meyer. Schalke took the lead at the sold-out Veltins Arena in front of 62,271 supporters when Ukraine midfielder Yevhen Konoplyanka was fouled in the area and Di Santo converted the resulting penalty on 17 minutes. Hamburg had an appeal for handball against Schalke defender Thilo Kehrer turned down by the video assistant referee (VAR) just after the break. The hosts sealed the deserved win after some good work in the area when Konoplyanka found Burgstaller in space and the Austria international fired home from close range 12 minutes from time. This was an efficient, if uninspiring display from Schalke, who defended doggedly and will be buoyed for next Saturday's derby at arch rivals Borussia Dortmund, who have dropped to fifth after collecting just one point from a possible 15. ""We are just taking it one game at a time,"" added Meyer. ""We won't be favourites in Dortmund and it'll be a 50-50 game."" Hamburg are just above the relegation places, but at the other end of the table Schalke and RB Leipzig are six points behind defending champions Bayern, who beat Augsburg 3-0 in Munich on Saturday as Robert Lewandowski scored twice. The Poland forward has now scored 17 goals for the Bavarians this season. He has also netted 18 times against Augsburg for both Bayern and his former club Borussia Dortmund. Germany striker Max Kruse netted a hat-trick as Werder Bremen picked up their first win of the season on Sunday in emphatic style with a 4-0 thrashing of mid-table Hanover 96. Kruse set up his forward partner Fin Bartels for the opening goal in Bremen, then wrapped up his hat-trick inside 23 minutes in the second half with Bartels twice laying on the assist. It is the first time Kruse has scored since breaking his collarbone in October. The result leaves Bremen still in the bottom three but is a timely boost for caretaker coach Florian Kohfeldt, 35, in only his second game since taking charge when Alexander Nouri was sacked at the end of October. ""Max is a very important player for us who can decide a game,"" said Kohfeldt. ""Of course, I am happy that he got three goals today and we played well, but we still have a long way to go."""
105,19/09/2017,22:59,James hits first Bundesliga goal as Bayern go top,James Rodriguez scored his first Bundesliga goal on Tuesday to help Bayern Munich top the table for the first time this season following a 3-0 win at Schalke 04.,"The Colombian was involved in all three goals after winning the penalty which Robert Lewandowski converted for the opening goal before his deft chip saw Arturo Vidal fire home. After five games, the victory in Gelsenkirchen put defending champions Bayern top for the first time, but Borussia Dortmund can regain the lead if they win at Hamburg on Wednesday. The away win was a boost for Bayern who confirmed Tuesday that goalkeeper and captain Manuel Neuer had undergone another operation on his left foot and is out until January. ""That wasn't so easy, but at the end we managed to dominate,"" said Neuer's replacement Sven Ulreich, who now finds himself as Bayern's first-choice goalkeeper after wanting to quit in the summer. ""Of course it's a tough situation for the team and Manuel, but we hope he'll be back soon."" Bayern coach Carlo Ancelotti rotated the squad with James on the right wing as one of six changes from the side which beat Mainz 4-0 on Saturday. James won a penalty on 23 minutes when the video assistant referee confirmed his cross had been knocked away by the hand of Schalke defender Naldo. Lewandowski dispatched the penalty for his sixth goal in five games. James, who signed a two-year loan deal from Real Madrid in July, then fired home on 29 minutes when Corentin Tolisso's pass found him with acres of space in the area. It was a sublime chip over the Schalke defence from James which was then drilled home by Vidal on 75 minutes. The win left Bayern two points clear at the summit while Augsburg are up to third, with 10 points, after their shock 1-0 home win against RB Leipzig. Austria midfielder Michael Gregoritsch scored Augsburg's winner after only four minutes in Bavaria, but Leipzig coach Ralph Hasenhuettl paid the price for making nine changes as his team played poorly. Belgium striker Divock Origi, on loan from Liverpool, scored his first goal for Wolfsburg in their 1-1 draw at home to Werder Bremen before Fin Bartels equalised. Origi showed his pace to win a foot race for the ball and stabbed home on 28 minutes as Wolfsburg's new coach Martin Schmidt, who replaced the fired Andries Jonker on Monday, picked up a point. Earlier, Brazil striker Raffael scored two second-half goals as Borussia Moechengladbach climbed to seventh after their 2-0 home win at home to Stuttgart. It was Stuttgart's first game since captain Christian Gentner suffered multiple facial fractures and concussion in a collision during Saturday's win over Wolfsburg. Gladbach's Raffael opened the scoring by finishing the move he started with a superb 57th-minute goal after releasing Nico Elvedi on the wing and firing home the Swiss right-back's cross. Stuttgart defender Dennis Aogo gave away a penalty when he held Belgian forward Thorgan Hazard back in the area and Raffael slotted away the spot-kick on 74 minutes."

They are fourth in the table, one place below champions Bayern, who have an identical record of three wins and a defeat but are third on goal difference. A win in Gelsenkirchen could put Schalke top as current leaders Borussia Dortmund play Hamburg on Wednesday, the same day second-placed Hanover are at Freiburg. But Tedesco is warning his side to not get ahead of themselves. ""If you go into the game thinking that you want to lead the table, then you forget all the small steps you need to take,"" said the Schalke coach. Nevertheless, there is an air of confidence around the Veltins Arena. ""If you play against Bayern you have to step out with your head held high -- which we can now do,"" said Schalke midfielder Leon Goretzka, who hit the winner in Saturday's 2-1 victory at Werder Bremen. Goretzka, 22, shone at the Confederations Cup in the summer when Germany lifted the trophy but is out of contract next June and likely to be on Bayern's radar. Bayern hammered Mainz 4-0 on Saturday after suffering a shock league defeat at Hoffenheim a week earlier. Their challenge is proving it was not a one-off. ""We must confirm that this is not unique,"" said Arjen Robben, who scored Bayern's second goal against Mainz but will be missing in Gelsenkirchen with flu. Bayern have confirmed Germany goalkeeper Manuel Neuer is out after injuring his left foot, the same one he had surgery on for a stress fracture in May. Sven Ulreich will deputise. Juan Bernat and David Alaba are also missing but Thomas Mueller will hope to keep his place after impressing his coach at the weekend. ""He played well and was fantastic in his movement, even without the ball,"" enthused Ancelotti. Centre-back Jerome Boateng is set to be rested having only just returned from injury. The biggest threat facing Ancelotti and sporting director Hasan Salihamidzic is keeping the squad together amidst obvious cracks. Hot-shot striker Robert Lewandowski, who has now scored 82 goals in 100 league games for Bayern, has criticised the club's spending policy. Robben slammed the team's performance for struggling to break down 10-man Anderlecht before winning 3-0 in the Champions League last midweek. And winger Franck Ribery threw his shirt at the bench in a temper after being substituted in that same game. Now Ancelotti has been criticised by his former coach Arrigo Sacchi. ""It looks as though some changes would do Bayern good,"" Sacchi, one of Italy's former top coaches, told German broadcaster Sport1. ""One gets older and loses the passion and the absolute will -- that's life,"" added the 71-year-old in a thinly-veiled attack on Ancelotti. ""I have the impression that the enthusiasm of the team has been lost."" The 58-year-old Ancelotti is one of Europe's most successful coaches having won three Champions League titles with AC Milan and Real Madrid. As a player, Ancelotti won the European Cup under Sacchi in 1989 and 1990 at Milan. Meanwhile, former Mainz boss Martin Schmidt has been appointed by Wolfsburg to replace Andries Jonker, who was sacked following Saturday's 1-0 defeat at VfB Stuttgart. Schmidt will get an early chance to assess his new charges as they host Bremen on Tuesday evening before going to Bayern on Friday.

He is set to face Cameroon on Sunday in the final Group B match with Germany on the verge of the semi-finals. The Schalke midfielder scored in Germany's opening 3-2 win over Australia in Group B, then put in a strong display in Thursday's 1-1 draw with Chile. He has a year left on his Schalke contract and Goretzka insists he is fully focused on the Confed Cup. However, with Juventus, Bayern Munich and Tottenham Hotspur also said to be interested, reports from the UK claim Arsenal are preparing a 21 million pounds ($26.8m) bid for him. ""I do not really want to say anything about the transfer rumours, I'm focusing on the Confed Cup,"" he said in Sochi. ""I'm not going to give state-of-play updates, but if there are facts, I will announce them. ""I'm not the type to be impressed by newspaper reports, I know what my qualities are, but I will not build myself up."" If he joins the Gunners, Goretzka would be Arsenal's second off-season signing from Schalke after Bosnia defender Sead Kolasinac left earlier this month. Christian Heidel, Schalke's general manager, says they will not let Goretzka leave before his contract expires in June 2018. However, Germany's head coach Joachim Loew revealed he has spoken to the midfielder about his future.

But Bayern, who have just won a fifth-straight Bundesliga title, announced Friday that they are releasing Badstuber, who joined the German giants in 2002 as a 13-year-old. ""It was clear from the start that Holger Badstuber, after his loan spell at Schalke, would seek a new experience most likely abroad,"" said Bayern chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge. ""Therefore Bayern Munich wish Holger Badstuber all the best and we thank him for his exemplary commitment in nearly 15 years at Saebener Strasse (Bayern's training ground)."" Carlo Ancelotti's Bavarian giants already have four centre-backs on their books for next season in Jerome Boateng, Mats Hummels and Javi Martinez with Niklas Suele, 21, to arrive for 2017/18 from Hoffenheim. Earlier this week, Schalke said they would not be signing Badstuber permanently after ten league appearances for the Royal Blues since January. The burly defender made the last of his 31 appearances for Germany in March 2015. However, his career has been dogged by injury including back-to-back cruciate ligament tears in 2012 and 2013 that sidelined him out for long spells."

They are in pole position for a Europa League place but rivals Hertha Berlin, Cologne and Werder Bremen are all within two points with two games remaining. Niederlechner scored twice in the first-half at the Schwarzwald Stadion, where Freiburg have won 10 of their 16 home games this season. Freiburg's march to Europe is echoed by second-placed RB Leipzig, who were also promoted last season, yet secured a direct Champions League berth for next season with a 4-1 win at Hertha Berlin on Saturday. Earlier, relegation-threatened Hamburg and Mainz both boosted their Bundesliga survival chances by earning a point apiece in a goalless draw. Mainz had the best chances to take the three points in Hamburg as Spanish midfielder Jairo Samperio came off the bench and twice went close late on. The result leaves both clubs on 34 points, with Hamburg in the relegation play-off place due to their inferior goal difference. However the two sides moved four points clear of second-bottom Ingolstadt with just two games left to play. Hamburg are fighting to preserve their status as the Bundesliga's only ever-present club, having flirted with relegation from Germany's top tier in recent seasons. They remain in 16th place, which would lead to a two-legged play-off at the end of the season against the team that finishes third in the second division in order to stay in the Bundesliga. Bottom side Darmstadt were relegated on Saturday following their 1-0 defeat at champions Bayern Munich with Mainz, Hamburg and Ingolstadt battling to avoid joining them in the second tier next season. Ingolstadt are four points adrift of safety and must effectively win their final two games -- at Freiburg and home to Schalke -- while hoping Hamburg and Mainz drop points in order to stay up. Mainz host Eintracht Frankfurt and then visit Cologne in their run-in, while Hamburg travel to Schalke before taking on Wolfsburg at home in the final round of matches."

""In the category of 18-22 year olds, we are at the front in Europe,"" boasted Borussia's CEO Hans-Joachim Watzke. Under coach Thomas Tuchel, Dortmund are nurturing the likes of Germany's 21-year-old defensive midfielder Julian Weigl. Teenager forwards Dembele, 19, and Pulisic, still just 18, have attracted interest from Europe's top clubs. ""Age doesn't play a role as far as our trainer is concerned,"" said Dembele. ""It comes down to ambition, commitment and a fighting spirit,"" is how Schalke's captain, World Cup winner Benedikt Hoewedes, sums up the clash. Such is his desire to help Schalke that Hoewedes, 29, has delayed surgery on a groin injury until June. Dortmund striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, the league's top scorer with 23 goals this season, loves scoring in the derby and has netted in four of the five games he has started against Schalke. Aubameyang is locked in a battle with Bayern Munich's Robert Lewandowski and Cologne's Anthony Modeste to be the league's top scorer, and has scored nine goals in his last six games for Dortmund. Likewise, Schalke will rely on their talented youngsters defender Sead Kolasinac (23), play-maker Max Meyer (21) and defender Thilo Kehrer (20). ""It's unbelievable how successful our youth academy is,"" said sports director Christian Heidel, with all three having rise through Schalke's ranks. In the last ten years, Schalke's academy has produced current Germany stars Hoewedes, Manuel Neuer, Mesut Ozil and Julian Draxler. The neighbouring cities of Dortmund and Gelsenkirchen, the home of Schalke, are just 50 kilometres (31mi) apart, and there is no love lost. Schalke, who are up to tenth last beat Dortmund in September 2014, but are desperate to cap a third straight league win by beating their old rivals. Dortmund are third, a huge 16 points behind leaders Bayern Munich, and face Schalke at the start of a busy period with nine games to play in April including Champions League quarter-finals against Monaco. Bayern are home to Augsburg on Saturday with Carlo Ancelotti's side missing defender Javi Martinez with suspension. The Bavarian giants are unbeaten in their last 19 games in all competitions and are 13 points clear at the top of the table. Like Dortmund, Bayern are embarking on a busy April schedule with nine games including home and away Champions League clashes against Real Madrid. Ancelotti is sure to rotate in Augsburg, as they face fourth-placed Hoffenheim away next Tuesday before hosting Borussia Dortmund, the only Bundesliga team to beat them this season a week on Saturday. Second-placed RB Leipzig host bottom side Darmstadt on Saturday hoping to bounce back after straight defeats to strugglers Wolfsburg and Werder Bremen leave them with just seven points from their last seven games.

115,12/03/2017,18:27,Burgstaller's brace ends Schalke's winless streak,Austria striker Guido Burgstaller netted twice on Sunday as Schalke 04 broke their six-match winless streak with a 3-0 victory at home to Augsburg in the Bundesliga.,"Schalke's coach Markus Weinzierl had an enjoyable afternoon against his former club as the Royal Blues wrapped up the win with just over half an hour played in Gelsenkirchen. ""We put in a very strong first half -- I must pay the team a big compliment,"" said Weinzierl, whose team next face Borussia Moenchengladbach away in the Europa League's last 16 after Thursday's 1-1 first-leg draw. ""In the second half, you could see we had a few games in our legs. ""A lot of people have written us off in the Europa League, but we still believe in our chance,"" he added ahead of Thursday's away leg at Gladbach. Burgstaller opened the scoring with four minutes gone when he stabbed home at the far post from a corner, then grabbed his second on 29 minutes after a cross from Cameroon's Eric Choupo-Moting. Schalke captain Benedikt Hoewedes, a World Cup winner with Germany, conceded a penalty by fouling Augsburg's burly striker Raul Bobadilla. Goalkeeper Ralf Faehrmann saved Paul Verhaegh's spot kick on 32 minutes but Schalke's attacking midfielder Daniel Caligiuri netted the home team's third goal just two minutes later. The victory reverses Schalke's slide down the table. They climbed two places to 11th, two ahead of Augsburg. It takes the pressure off Schalke's coach Weinzierl, who had been under the cosh following last weekend's 4-2 drubbing at Borussia Moenchengladbach. At the top of the table, leaders Bayern Munich extended their lead to 10 points on Saturday after their 3-0 win over Eintracht Frankfurt on a red-letter day for the Bavarian giants as their nearest rivals lost. Second-placed RB Leipzig crashed to a shock 1-0 defeat at home to Wolfsburg, while Borussia Dortmund, who are third, suffered a Champions League hangover in the capital as they lost 2-1 at Hertha Berlin."
116,01/03/2017,23:03,Sublime Lewandowski fires Bayern into cup semis,Robert Lewandowski took his season tally to 30 goals to inspire Bayern Munich's 3-0 win over ten-man Schalke in the German Cup quarter-finals on Wednesday.,"Having hit a hat-trick in last weekend's 8-0 mauling of Hamburg at home, Lewandowski's rich form continued at the Allianz Arena as he was involved in all three Bayern goals, scoring twice. He is the Bundesliga's joint top-scorer with 19 goals, alongside Borussia Dortmund's Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, having also scored six times in the Champions League and five in the cup. ""We managed to do everything we want to in the first-half and attacked well,"" said man-of-the-match Lewandowski. ""Schalke couldn't do much about it. We know one goal isn't enough in the cup, which is why we wanted more."" The Poland hot-shot gave holders Bayern the lead with just three minutes gone by deftly chipping Franck Ribery's pass over Schalke goalkeeper Ralf Faehrmann. He the turned provider by supplying the cross for attacking midfielder Thiago Alcantara to head home on 16 minutes. Lewandowski then drilled Ribery's pass into the Schalke net on 29 minutes for a seventh goal in his last four games. Schalke defended well in the second half, but it was a miserable return to Munich for defender Holger Badstuber, on loan in Gelsenkirchen from Bayern until June. The Germany centre-back was sent off late on for a second booking when he fouled Javi Martinez after pulling Arjen Robben's shirt moments before. Schalke shot-stopper Faehrmann said Bayern's early goals were like a ""punch in the face"" for the Royal Blues. ""The first-half was nothing for us,"" he fumed. ""We didn't put in the challenges and were behind in all areas. ""That is simply the class from Bayern that you can't allow any mistakes."" The win keeps Bayern on course for the treble of Champions League, Bundesliga and German Cup this season and was their third-straight dominant display in Munich. Their Champions League Round of 16, first-leg 5-1 hammering of Arsenal, who they face away in Tuesday's return, was followed by the goal-bonanza against Hamburg. Earlier, Borussia Moechengladbach booked their semi-final berth with a 2-1 win at Hamburg thanks to penalties by captain Lars Stindl and Brazilian striker Raffael. Both Borussia Dortmund and third-division giant-killers Sportfreunde Lotte will go into the pot for the semi-finals after their clash on Tuesday was postponed by a heavy snowfall. The referee deemed the playing surface in Lotte unsafe and the replay will take place on March 14. The German Football Association (DFB) have reportedly advised Lotte to find an alternative ground given the poor condition of the pitch at their 10,000-capacity stadium. Eintracht Frankfurt also reached the last four thanks to their 1-0 win at home to Arminia Bielefeld. Midfielder Danny Blum scored Frankfurt's first-half winner. However, the night belonged to ex-captain Marco Russ, who came off the bench in added time to make his first appearance since battling cancer last year."
117,28/02/2017,13:26,Lahm offers Schalke tips to face rampant Bayern,Philipp Lahm has offered Schalke tips on how to avoid being the next victims of a Bayern Munich pounding in Wednesday's German Cup quarter-final.,"Holders Bayern have reached the cup's last eight in each of the last 10 years, which no other German club can match. They are bidding to reach the semi-finals for an eighth year-in-a-row, while Schalke have not got this far since the 2010/2011 season when they last won the trophy by hammering Duisburg 5-0 in the final. Bayern are in goal-scoring form after hammering Hamburg 8-0 in Munich on Saturday in the Bundesliga which came 10 days after their 5-1 demolition of Arsenal in the Champions League. Schalke are the next team bidding to halt Munich's goal-machine and are unbeaten in their last seven games in all competitions, dating back to their 1-1 league draw with Bayern at the Allianz Arena four weeks ago. The Royal Blues put in a battling second-half display to take a Bundesliga point on their last visit as Naldo's stunning free-kick cancelled out Robert Lewandowski's early goal. Schalke use a three-man defence, operating alongside two wing backs who can drop back to form a back five. Having an extra man in defence could pay off against Bayern, according to club captain Lahm, after his team ran riot against Arsenal and Hamburg's back four. ""That's how things are at the moment. It looks like it is easier for us against a back four,"" said Lahm as a compact defence of five defenders allows Bayern little space to attack. Playing a back five does however present disadvantages, admitted Lahm. ""An opponent with a four-man defence has more potential to attack, especially on the counter, because they have more midfield players when they have won the ball,"" added Lahm. Germany's star Thomas Mueller, who was impressive against Hamburg with two assists, agreed with his skipper that Bayern profit against a four-man defence. ""It is easier for the lines of running if we do not have to play against a five-chain every time,"" says Mueller. ""You can move into the gaps better without betraying too much to your opponents.""

118,04/02/2017,17:58,Bayern's Schalke draw opens door for Leipzig,Bayern Munich left the door open for second-placed RB Leipzig to trim their lead in the Bundesliga to one point after being held to a 1-1 draw by Schalke on Saturday.,"Robert Lewandowski's deft chip gave Bayern an early lead in Munich before Schalke defender Naldo drilled home a free-kick on 13 minutes to level the scores. Captain Philipp Lahm made his 500th appearance for Bayern, but the Bavarian giants were made to work for their point. ""It was a tough game because Schalke played well,"" said Bayern coach Carlo Ancelotti. ""We started well but were not so compact, also in midfield, and our two lines were too far apart from one another. ""We could only increase the pressure slightly at the end, but it was not enough."" Flu-hit Leipzig will look to cut into Bayern's provisional four-point lead with a win at Borussia Dortmund in Saturday night's key showdown in Germany's top flight. But Leipzig have a tough task with top-scorer Timo Werner, midfielder Diego Demme and striker Marcel Sabitzer all out with flu, while playmaker Emil Forsberg is suspended. In Munich, Bayern took the lead with just nine minutes gone. Arturo Vidal, back from injury, threaded a pass to Lewandowski and the Poland striker lifted his shot over Schalke goalkeeper Ralf Faehrmann for his 15th league goal this season. But Schalke kept their composure and equalised four minutes later when Naldo hammered a free-kick past Bayern goalkeeper Manuel Neuer. Both sides had clear first-half chances as Schalke striker Guido Burgstaller hit the crossbar, just like Lewandowski did at the other end. This was a tight, bruising encounter as Schalke fought hard for the point which left them 11th. ""Our plan would have worked out 100 percent if we'd won, but we can be very happy and can live with the point,"" said a delighted Schalke coach, Markus Weinzierl. Hoffenheim, the last team in a top European league to lose their unbeaten record last weekend, went third with a 4-0 hammering of Mainz at home. Hoffenheim went ahead when midfield playmaker Sebastian Rudy's long pass was chested down by striker Mark Uth, who drilled home his shot with five minutes gone. Hoffenheim doubled the lead when midfielder Marco Terrazzino headed their second nine minutes from time then replacement striker Adam Szalai scored two goals off the bench against his old club. Hertha moved up to fourth with a 1-0 win at home to strugglers Ingolstadt. After losing their first two games of 2017, coach Pal Dardai had demanded a reaction and Hertha delivered with an early goal. Salomon Kalou took advantage of some weak defending, sprinted down the wing to cross for Japan midfielder Genki Haraguchi to give them the lead after just a minute at Berlin's Olympic Stadium. Cologne are fifth following their 1-0 win at Wolfsburg thanks to Anthony Modeste's second-half penalty, having been fouled by Wolves goalkeeper Diego Benaglio in the area. Borussia Moenchengladbach picked up their second straight win with a 3-0 victory at home to Freiburg courtesy of goals from captain Lars Stindl, striker Raffael and winger Patrick Herrmann to go tenth."
119,03/02/2017,01:45,Neuer warns misfiring Bayern to be wary of Schalke,Germany goalkeeper Manuel Neuer has warned misfiring Bundesliga leaders Bayern Munich that they must rediscover their form against Schalke on Saturday following lacklustre back-to-back displays in 2017.,"Bayern laboured to 2-1 league wins at both Freiburg and Werder Bremen in the last fortnight to stay three-points clear of RB Leipzig. Carlo Ancelotti's Bayern have failed to fire since flooring Leipzig 3-0 at home in December. Neuer says the Bavarian giants must step up before their last 16, first leg, of the Champions League at home to Arsenal in two weeks -- starting against his ex-club Schalke, who are 11th. ""We know we have important games ahead,"" said Neuer, who was born in Gelsenkirchen. ""We're determined to play better football and want to show it in our first home game of the year."" Mid-table Schalke are struggling for form with just one win in their last six games with coach Markus Weinzierl under pressure. ""Schalke are standing with their backs against the wall. This is a dangerous match as, from Schalke's point of view, a win over Bayern would make a lot of things good again,"" warned Neuer. Bayern could face their Germany defender Holger Badstuber, who is on loan to Schalke, but has been on the bench so far. Bayern are set to welcome back captain Philipp Lahm and midfielder Arturo Vidal after injury, but are without defender Jerome Boateng (shoulder) and Franck Ribery (thigh). Tensions will be high for Borussia Dortmund's home clash against second-placed Leipzig. Leipzig, who were only founded in 2009, are sponsored by Austrian energy drinks giants Red Bull. Dortmund's hardcore 'Ultra' supporters are planning protests during the match against the commercialism RB represent. Leipzig's chairman Oliver Mintzlaff has upped the ante by saying he is 'not sad' Dortmund coach Thomas Tuchel turned Leipzig down in mid 2015. At the start of the season, Dortmund's CEO Hans-Jaochim Watzke described RB as 'performing cans', created to sell drinks, words he later had cause to regret as Dortmund lost 1-0 at Leipzig's Red Bull Arena in September. ""If that was true, then 11 'cans' beat 11 'bottles', which in German (slang) means 'someone who played poorly,"" Leipzig's director of sport Ralph Rangnick retorted in December. Leipzig will be without top-scorer Timo Werner, who has netted 11 goals this season. He is laid low with flu, while coach Ralph Hasenhuettl has recovered after also contracting the virus. Dortmund have told star striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang to tone down any talk of leaving in June after giving interviews when he said he may quit to take his career 'to the next level'. Having spent 33 million euros ($35.7m) on new recruits in January's transfer window -- the most in the Bundesliga -- Wolfsburg are hoping to see some return at home to Cologne on Saturday to climb up from 14th. Coach Valerien Ismael hopes to have ex-Fulham midfielder Ashkan Dejagah, who signed from Doha-based Al-Arabi, available if the necessary paperwork is done in time. Wolfsburg also signed goal-scoring attacking midfielder Yunus Malli from Mainz, central midfielder Riechedly Bazoer from Ajax and France forward Paul-Georges Ntep, but stumbled to a 2-1 defeat at home to Augsburg last weekend. Having been the last team in a European league to lose their unbeaten record with a 2-1 defeat at Leipzig last weekend, fifth-placed Hoffenheim host Mainz on Saturday. Hoffenheim are without suspended striker Sandro Wagner, who was sent off at Leipzig, while Mainz's new signing, ex-Barcelona forward Bojan Krkic could make his debut having signed on loan from Stoke City, Fixtures (all times 1430 GMT unless stated)"
120,01/02/2017,16:55,Hoewedes delays hip surgery to face Bayern,Germany defender Benedikt Hoewedes has delayed hip surgery until the end of the season to help steer Schalke out of their crisis -- and face Bundesliga leaders Bayern Munich on Saturday.,"The 28-year-old Schalke captain was part of the Germany team which won the 2014 World Cup but has been told by doctors that he needs surgery to fix a hip problem. The Royal Blues defender has delayed going under the knife until June in order to help his side, starting with Bayern away at Munich's Allianz Arena on Saturday. ""Benedikt came to us and suggested it -- we would never ask it of a player,"" Schalke's sports director Christian Heidel told German daily Bild. Hoewedes has been with Schalke, nicknamed 'Die Knappen' (The Miners), since 2001 and wants to help with coach Markus Weinzierl under pressure after losing nine of his 18 league games since taking charge this season. ""We are now in such a menacing situation that we have to try and take points everywhere,"" said Hoewedes, who is Schalke's top scorer against Bayern in recent years with three goals. ""Why not in Munich? Of course we're playing like crap, but the fact we are being whistled by our own fans really damn hurts."" Bayern are three points clear in Germany's top flight while Schalke are 11th in the table. After four poor performances in a row, Schalke's fans are running out of patience with Weinzierl, recruited from Augsburg, and ex-Mainz boss Heidel, who are both in their first season in Gelsenkirchen. Weinzierl's record makes him the worst Schalke coach since 1993 having lost his first five games in charge this season -- an unwanted new club record."
121,11/01/2017,13:53,Badstuber out to kick-start career at Schalke,Injury-prone Germany defender Holger Badstuber is relishing his loan transfer from Bundesliga leaders Bayern Munich to Schalke 04 until the end of the season to help kick-start his career.,"""Schalke is a club with a great fan base, a great stadium, a young and hungry team, plus a trainer I rate highly,"" Badstuber told Sky as Bayern finished their winter training camp in Doha. ""The overall package is very exciting for me. ""I am an emotional player and I need an emotional environment."" The Royal Blues beat off competition from Pep Guardiola's Manchester City, Hamburg and Swansea City for the centre-back, who won the last of his 31 caps for Germany in March 2015. The short-term switch to Schalke benefits all parties. Badstuber, 27, who suffered numerous injuries in the last four years, including back-to-back knee injuries, has played just 28 minutes of Bundesliga football since October. He was Bayern's fourth-choice centre-back behind Germany pair Jerome Boateng and Mats Hummels, plus Javi Martinez. His Bayern contract expires at the end of the season, but head coach Carlo Ancelotti has made it clear the loan transfer will not be made permanent. The Italian said it was 'no problem' for Badstuber to join Schalke to get some game time under his belt over the next six months. At Schalke, who are 11th in the table, Badstuber will pair up with Germany defender Benedikt Hoewedes under head coach Markus Weinzierl. ""I am grateful that FC Bayern has met my wish. I want to get some match practice, which I now need, and I am looking forward to my time in Gelsenkirchen,"" Badstuber told the Bayern website. His experience will boost a Schalke team which has been erratic so far this season. They set an unenviable club record by losing their first five league games, but climbed from bottom to eighth by being unbeaten in their next seven, only to be winless in their last four matches of 2016. Badstuber will undergo a medical in Gelsenkirchen on Thursday before signing his contract. He could feature, along with Schalke's new Austria striker Guido Burgstaller from second-division Nuremberg, in Saturday's friendly at third-division Chemnitzer FC."
122,10/01/2017,18:19,Bayern's Badstuber makes Schalke loan move,Schalke 04 beat off reported interest from Manchester City and Swansea City to land Bayern Munich centre-back Holger Badstuber on loan on Tuesday for the rest of the season.,"It comes after Bayern coach Carlo Ancelotti ruled out a permanent move for the out-of-favour German international, 27, with ex-Bayern boss Pep Guardiola reportedly interested in teaming up with Badstuber again at City. ""Holger deserves to play. He's been injured so often but now he's physically fit again and would like to play more games,"" said Bayern chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge. ""That's why he asked us to allow him to go out on loan to Schalke, and we gladly agreed. We hope Holger will get plenty of minutes under his belt in the coming months."" Badstuber, who will undergo a medical at Schalke in the next few days, said: ""I'm thankful that FC Bayern have agreed to my request. I'd like to get some much-needed match practice at Schalke and I'm looking forward to my time in Gelsenkirchen."" Speaking earlier from Bayern's winter training camp in Doha, Ancelotti said that there was ""no chance"" that the defender would be sold and the German champions want to extend his contract when it expires at the end of the season. ""I said if he decided to leave because he wanted to play we can deal with it for six months,"" said the Italian. Badstuber has fallen out of favour under Ancelotti after suffering numerous injuries in the last four years, including back-to-back knee injuries. He has played just 28 minutes for the Bundesliga leaders since October. He won the last of his 31 caps for Germany in March 2015, but is Bayern's fourth-choice centre-back behind Mats Hummels, Jerome Boateng, who is currently injured, and Javi Martinez. ""He is a very interesting player because he has international experience and is a Bayern Munich player, but I don't know if it is realistic,"" said Schalke coach Markus Weinzierl at their training camp in Benidorm, before news broke of Badstuber's move. Schalke are 11th in the Bundesliga. Bayern, who have been in Doha for one week, are set to return home to Germany on Wednesday after playing a friendly match against Qatari-owned Belgian league side KAS Eupen on Tuesday evening."
123,03/12/2016,20:35,"RB Leipzig knock Bayern off top, extend record",RB Leipzig again knocked Bayern Munich from top spot in the Bundesliga table on Saturday as their 2-1 win at home to Schalke 04 left them three points clear.,"Carlo Ancelotti's Bayern had regained the lead with a 3-1 win at Mainz on Friday night, but Leipzig replaced them less than 24 hours later. Bayern and Leipzig are set to meet at Munich's Allianz Arena on December 21 in a mouth-watering pre-Christmas showdown. A second-half own-goal from Schalke's Bosnia international Sead Kolasinac sealed Leipzig's win, their 10 league victory, extending their record unbeaten run to 13 matches in their first Bundesliga season. Leipzig took an early lead in controversial fashion as Schalke goalkeeper Ralf Faehrmann conceded a penalty with just 19 seconds gone when the referee judged he had made contact with RB's top scorer Timo Werner. Replays showed the Leipzig forward dived, but the 20-year-old Werner drilled in his eighth league goal of the season. Faehrmann was booked to add insult to injury for Schalke Schalke regained their composure and drew level when Bosnia winger Kolasinac drilled home a cross on 32 minutes. But the 23-year-old, who has been linked to Liverpool, turned the ball into his own net two minutes into the second half following a free-kick from Leipzig's Emil Forsberg. Faehrmann tipped the ball onto the bar to deny a header from Leipzig defender Marcel Halstenberg 20 minutes from the end and with time running out Schalke's Brazil centre-back Naldo cleared off the line from Forsberg. This was Schalke's first defeat in 13 games, dating back to the end of September, to leave them eighth. Earlier, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang scored twice as Borussia Dortmund prepared for their Champions League clash at Real Madrid with a 4-1 rout of Borussia Moenchengladbach. With both sides already into the last 16, the victor at Real's Bernabeu on Wednesday will be confirmed as Group F winners and fifth-placed Dortmund warmed-up with an emphatic win over Moenchengladbach at Signal Iduna Park. Fleet-footed Marco Reus weighed in with three assists as Dortmund fought back after Gladbach took the lead with six minutes gone when Brazilian forward Raffael slotted home from the edge of the area. Lukasz Piszczek headed home and Ousmane Dembele also netted in the second half to seeal an emphatic win. Hertha Berlin held onto third with a 3-2 comeback victory at 10-man Wolfsburg as Salomon Kalou converted the winning penalty in the 91st minute. Wolfsburg coach Valerien Ismael dropped Germany international Julian Draxler from his starting line-up and his side responded with two goals in the opening 20 minutes. Ex-Real Madrid striker Borja Mayoral gave Wolfsburg a 12th-minute lead before Marvin Plattenhardt put Hertha level by expertly drilling his free-kick over the wall. Wolfsburg went back in front when midfielder Paul Seguin, who was later sent off for a second booking five minutes from time, slammed his shot home on 18 minutes. Alexander Esswein levelled for Hertha 20 minutes from time before Daniel Caligiuri fouled Plattenhardt to concede the penalty Kalou converted for the winner. Hoffenheim, who along with RB Leipzig are the only unbeaten teams in the Bundesliga, are fourth after romping to a 4-0 win at home to Cologne. Ex-Bayern striker Sandro Wagner scored twice for Hoffenheim while Jeremy Toljan and Mark Uth also got on the scoresheet. Bayer Leverkusen, who host Group E winners Monaco on Wednesday with both teams through to the knock-out stages of the Champions League, drew 1-1 at home to Freiburg. Janik Haberer gave Freiburg a shock first-half lead before Hakan Calhanoglu levelled after the break. Leverkusen's Javier Hernandez failed to convert a late penalty as the Mexico striker fired his spot-kick at the feet of Freiburg goalkeeper Alexander Schwolow. Werder Bremen climbed out of the bottom three with a 2-1 win at home to Ingolstadt, who are second from bottom, thanks to Fin Bartels' second-half winner."
124,27/11/2016,18:25,Choupo-Moting atones as Schalke continue rise,Schalke 04 continued their rise up the Bundesliga table on Sunday as striker Eric Choupo-Moting atoned for a penalty miss by netting in their 3-1 comeback win against Darmstadt.,"Having been bottom of the table after losing their first five games -- the worst start to a season in the club's history -- the result left Schalke eighth and unbeaten in their last 11 games in all competitions. ""It's a lot of fun playing in this team,"" Choupo-Moting told Sky. ""It's the first time we have turned things around after going behind and we haven't lost for a while now."" Markus Weinzierl's side will face a stern test of their renewed form when they visit Bundesliga leaders RB Leipzig, who won 4-1 at Freiburg on Friday to stay three points clear of Bayern Munich, next weekend. Cameroon's Choupo-Moting showed his class in Gelsenkirchen by redeeming himself for a missed first-half penalty. After setting up Schalke's equaliser in the opening period, the 27-year-old made it 2-1 midway through the second half before Alessandro Schoepf grabbed their third on 90 minutes. Darmstadt took the lead at Schalke's Veltins Arena when midfielder Marcel Heller poached the opening goal with just six minutes gone. But Schalke roared back with the equaliser when Darmstadt lost the ball on the edge of their own area and Choupo-Moting fired in a cross which Bosnia defender Sead Kolasinac headed home from close range on 26 minutes. The hosts should have doubled their tally barely a minute later when Germany international Leon Goretzka was fouled in the area, but Choupo-Moting failed with his penalty attempt. He fired his spot-kick at the feet of the diving Darmstadt goalkeeper Michael Esser and the ball rebounded to safety. ""I thought he'd dive to the side, so I hit the ball down the middle, but it didn't work the way I wanted it to,"" Choupo-Moting explained. ""That sort of thing does stay on your mind, but it helps if you score afterwards."" The Cameroon forward then showed lightning reactions to slip his marker when attacking midfielder Max Meyer fired in a cross and Choupo-Moting tapped his shot past Esser on 60 minutes. It was his third league goal of the season and he could have added another when he fired wide of the post with 14 minutes left. Austria's Schoepf added Schalke's third with some good finishing after a chip over the Darmstadt defence from Ukraine international Yevhen Konoplyanka just before the final whistle."

The Ligue 1 leaders can still finish second but will likely need two wins to do so. Their chances will be somewhat diminished given that Liverpool misfit Balotelli has scored seven goals in nine games this season.
126,25/09/2016,17:43,Schalke slump to fifth straight League defeat,Schalke remain bottom of the German Bundesliga following a fifth straight Bundesliga defeat with Sunday's 2-1 loss at Hoffenheim piling the pressure on coach Markus Weinzierl.,"Werder Bremen's dramatic 2-1 win over Wolfsburg on Saturday, with both of their goals coming in the last five minutes, had seen Schalke take Bremen's place at the bottom of the table in Germany's top flight. This was the first time the Royal Blues have lost their first five games in the Bundesliga. With Germany coach Joachim Loew watching, Schalke looked to be on course for their first league points of the season after taking a fourth minute lead at Hoffenheim's Rhein Neckar Arena. Swiss striker Breel Embolo -- who has so far failed to justify the 22 million euros ($24.5m) Schalke paid Basel for him -- fired in a cross which Cameroon striker Eric Choupo-Moting headed home at the far post. But Hoffenheim drew level when Croatia striker Andrej Kramaric, signed from Leicester City, headed them level on 17 minutes. And midfielder Lukas Rupp slotted home what proved to be the winning goal when his shot beat Schalke goalkeeper Ralf Faehermann on 41 minutes after his defence had given the ball away in their own half. Hamburg sacked coach Bruno Labbadia on Sunday after their 1-0 defeat to leaders Bayern Munich, their fourth-straight loss which left them 16th, and Weinzierl is now the next boss sweating about his future with Schalke two places below in rock bottom. Having been recruited from Augsburg at the start of the season, while sports director Christian Heidel was poached from Mainz, Weinzierl has endured a disastrous start and Schalke are the only club to have no points from their first five league matches. They play their next Europa League group stage match at home to RB Salzburg on Thursday, then face Champions League side Borussia Moenchengladbach next Sunday at home in the Bundesliga."
127,19/09/2016,18:53,New Schalke coach under fire after worst start,Schalke's Markus Weinzierl is under growing pressure ahead of Wednesday's Bundesliga clash at home to Cologne after becoming the first Royal Blues coach to lose his opening three league games.,"With his side second-from-bottom in the table, Schalke host Cologne in Gelsenkirchen desperate for points following defeats to Eintracht Frankfurt, Bayern Munich and Hertha Berlin, who beat them 2-0 on Sunday. The historic start to the season -- Schalke had never before lost their opening three games -- comes after a busy summer of vhange at the Veltins Arena. Swiss striker Breel Embolo, 19, was signed from Basel for 22 million euros ($24.5m), defender Abdul Rahman Baba was signed on loan from Chelsea while midfielder Max Mayer was away in Rio de Janeiro, impressing as he captained Germany to Olympic silver. Weinzierl was poached from Augsburg and new sports director Christian Heidel was recruited from Mainz. But they have had a dreadful start. Schalke won their opening Europa League match last Thursday 1-0 at Nice, but the new-look Royal Blues are struggling with the old problem of finding form in Germany's top flight. ""Now we face Cologne under even more pressure and must turn them over,"" said Heidel. ""Talk of unrest is being carried by the media, which is the way it always is at Schalke and we have to live with that. ""Internally, there is no unrest here."" But the Schalke squad is restless following recent results. ""I didn't sleep much,"" admitted midfielder Leon Goretzka on Monday after the defeat in Berlin. ""There is no point sticking our heads in the sand."" Germany defender Benedikt Hoewedes spoke to travelling Schalke fans after the Hertha defeat -- and got a round of applause. ""I told them that we didn't play well, but we all have to stay calm,"" said the Schalke captain. ""That's the only way we'll get out of this together."" Heidel praised the fans for their reaction at Berlin's Olympic Stadium, ""hats off, that could have gone very differently"", but he knows only a win against Cologne will sooth growing tensions."

Superb second-half goals from ex-Bayern midfielder Mitchell Weiser and Swiss midfielder Valentin Stocker at Berlin's Olympic Stadium gave Hertha three more points. A superb pass from Slovakia's Peter Pekarik was met in mid-air by Weiser who volleyed home to the delight of the home fans in the 50,000-strong crowd on 64 minutes. Hertha doubled their lead in emphatic fashion ten minutes later when Weiser's pass found Stocker in space behind the Schalke defence and the Swiss international showed great control before slamming his shot home. It means Berlin will head to Munich for a mouthwatering clash and another test for Carlo Ancelotti's Bayern. The Italian's illness-hit side had to come from behind to grind out a 3-1 win at home to Ingolstadt in Munich on Saturday. The result in Berlin was a third-straight defeat for Schalke. It is little short of disaster for new coach Markus Weinzierl and director of sport Christian Heidel after losing at Eintracht Frankfurt and being beaten at home by Bayern. The Royal Blues now badly need wins at home to Cologne on Wednesday and away to Hoffenheim on Sunday. Only goal difference keeps them off the bottom of the table, one place ahead of Werder Bremen, who sacked their coach Viktor Skripnik on Sunday. Earlier, Japan striker Yoshinori Muto again came off the bench to score his second goal in just three Bundesliga games in Mainz's 3-1 away win at Augsburg. Muto came on with 66 minutes gone for Colombia striker Jhon Cordoba, who had scored Mainz's early opener, and stabbed the ball over the line nine minutes from time after some good play by Yunus Malli. This was Muto's second goal off the bench this season after he netted, with only his fourth touch of the game, late in Mainz's 2-1 defeat at Borussia Dortmund on the opening weekend. Mainz are in the Europa League this season, drawing their first group game 1-1 at Saint Etienne on Thursday, but this was their first German league win of the campaign after also drawing 4-4 with Hoffenheim last weekend, when they squandered a 3-0 lead. On Sunday, Augsburg had again threated to share the points after Greece defender Konstantinos Stafylidis equalised in the 73rd minute to make it 1-1. But a bullet-header from Malli restored Mainz's lead two minutes later before Muto made sure of the three points to leave both teams in mid-table."

But Lewandowski struck his fourth goal in two games nine minutes from the end to put Bayern ahead, before setting up Kimmich in stoppage time to wrap up a second victory in as many matches for Carlo Ancelotti's side. The Italian handed Sanches, 19, his first Bayern start following his return to fitness from a thigh injury initially sustained during Portugal's triumphant Euro 2016 campaign. Schalke coach Markus Weinzierl introduced two new faces of his own by fielding Ukrainian winger Yevhen Konoplyanka and Algeria midfielder Nabil Bentaleb after both joined the Royal Blues on loan last month. Lewandowski scored a hat-trick in Bayern's 6-0 demolition of Werder Bremen on the season-opening weekend, and the Poland striker missed an opportunity to add to his haul when he dragged wide from a Thomas Mueller cutback on 24 minutes. But Schalke, beaten 1-0 by Eintracht Frankfurt a fortnight ago, showed plenty of promise and Manuel Neuer and David Alaba combined to deny Huntelaar shortly before the break after Konoplyanka skipped past Mats Hummels. The Netherlands international went even closer on 56 minutes when Neuer produced a superb fingertip save to tip Huntelaar's thunderous long-range effort onto the woodwork. Lewandowski should have broken the deadlock on 73 minutes when Alaba's cross evaded Mueller, with last year's leading scorer then somehow spooning the ball over from point-blank range. But he soon atoned for that glaring miss, taking Javi Martinez's through ball in his stride and rifling a clinical finish beyond Ralf Fahrmann to end Schalke's resistance. With the hosts pressing for an equaliser, Bayern hit Schalke on the counterattack in the dying stages and Lewandowski played in Kimmich to tuck away his first goal in the German top flight. On Saturday, Borussia Dortmund travel to promoted RB Leipzig, while Germany striker Mario Gomez is likely to make his Wolfsburg debut away to Cologne following his return to the Bundesliga after finishing as the top scorer in Turkey last season. Borussia Moenchengladbach, who visit Manchester City in their Champions League opener next week, must first go to promoted Freiburg."

132,25/08/2016,14:14,Schalke swoop for Bentaleb and Stambouli,Schalke 04 strengthened their squad for the new German Bundesliga season on Thursday by confirming the loan signing of Algerian international Nabil Bentaleb and closing in on the capture of French midfielder Benjamin Stambouli.,"Schalke, who finished fifth in Germany's top flight last season to qualify for the Europa League, have signed Bentaleb from Premier League side Tottenham Hotspur on a season-long loan for a fee of around one million euros. Meanwhile, Stambouli will join from Paris Saint-Germain and is set to cost the Royal Blues 8.5 million euros ($9.5m, £7.3m), according to German media. ""We're very happy that Nabil Bentaleb has decided to join us, we've been working on this transfer for six weeks,"" said Schalke's sporting director Christian Heidel. ""Everything is signed from our side and he will train with us this afternoon. ""He is an aggressive midfielder who gives us another option."" Schalke have the option of buying the 21-year-old holding midfielder, born in France, once his loan deal expires. Bentaleb has won 19 caps for Algeria and played in all three of their group-stage matches at the 2014 World Cup in Brazil when they lost to eventual winners Germany in the last 16. Bentaleb was a regular in the Spurs side in the 2014/15 season, but only made five Premier League appearances last season. Like Bentaleb, Stambouli, 26, is a defensive-minded midfielder. The former France under-21 international has signed on a four-year deal after just a season at PSG. Stambouli started his career at Montpellier and won the French title with them in 2012 before later spending a season at Tottenham, alongside Bentaleb, in 2014/15. ""Everything is settled with Paris,"" said Heidel. ""We must await the results (of the medical examination), but we are optimistic that everything will work out."" Schalke host Eintracht Frankfurt in Gelsenkirchen on Saturday as the 2016/17 Bundesliga season kicks off."
133,02/08/2016,12:59,Schalke sign Chelsea's Baba on loan,"Schalke 04 has signed Ghana international left-back Abdul Rahman Baba on loan from Chelsea for the coming season, both clubs confirmed on Tuesday.","Last season, Baba made 23 appearances for Chelsea, 19 of them starts, including his debut in the Champions League, but has been sent on loan by new Chelsea coach Antonio Conte to Schalke, who finished fifth in Germany's top flight last season. ""Abdul is a strong attacking left back, one who I have a lot of faith in. He will fit in well here, because of his excellent attitude,"" said Schalke's coach Markus Weinzierl, who worked with Baba while he was on loan at Augsburg. The 22-year-old spent the 2014/15 season with Augsburg, knows his way around German football after a stint with Greuther Fuerth, and has played 51 Bundesliga games, plus 24 matches in Germany's second tier. Baba signed a five-year contract with Chelsea in 2015 and has made a total of 15 Premier League appearances for the Blues, featuring four times in the Champions League. He was part of the Ghana side that reached the 2015 Africa Cup of Nations final, when his side lost to Ivory Coast on penalties."
134,02/08/2016,11:38,City confirm signing of Leroy Sane from Schalke,"Germany winger Leroy Sane has signed a five-year deal for Manchester City, both the Premier League side and his now former Bundesliga club Schalke 04 confirmed Tuesday.","City tweeted a picture of the 20-year-old Sane signing a contract, which is reportedly worth £37m (43m euros), plus add-ons, after he completed the medical examination in Manchester on Monday. ""One of the reasons I decided to join City was Pep Guardiola; he convinced me to come here and that I can continue to progress,"" said Sane on the Man City website. ""I know I will learn a lot under him and now I can take the next step in my career."" If the figure is confirmed, it will make Sane the most expensive German signing of all time. ""We have given the green light for the transfer. Those in charge of Manchester City behaved professionally at all times. There were difficult, but fair discussions,"" said Schalke's director of sport Christian Heidel. Sane is a rising star in the Germany squad and has already posed for pictures with City fans in Manchester. The reported transfer figure seems astronomical given that Sane has made just 47 Bundesliga appearances, scoring 11 goals and creating seven more, since his debut in Germany's top flight in April 2014. The fleet-footed forward made the last of his four international appearances for the world champions as a late replacement in last month's 2-0 defeat to hosts France in the Euro 2016 semi-finals. Sane, who scored eight goals in 33 Bundesliga games last season, was missing when Schalke flew to their pre-season training camp in Austria on Monday."

""Eating normal food is no longer possible,"" the 35-year-old winger, who made 211 Bundesliga appearances, scoring 21 goals for Schalke 04, Hanover 96 and Alemannia Aachen, told German daily Bild. ""I can't bite into hard foods, like an apple, any more. ""Sometimes, I don't even have the strength to chew, but there is no point going around crying about it."" Pinto has decided an operation to repair his jaw is too risky and has not sought a renewal of his contract at second-division Fortuna Duesseldorf, which expired at the end of the season. Having spent the 2013-14 season with Levante playing in Spain, Pinto returned to Germany and spent the last two seasons at Fortuna, for whom he made his last appearance in April 2015, when he broke his jaw for a second time. ""I'd have liked to have decided for myself when to stop,"" said Portugal-born Pinto, who moved to Germany with his family when he was 12. ""I'd have liked to have said goodbye on the pitch, but that wasn't possible anymore, which one has to accept,"" he added."

Neustadter -- who was born in the Ukrainian city of Dnipropetrovsk during the Soviet era -- has played two international friendlies for the Germany, but that did not compromise his eligibility to play for Russia. Earlier this month, President Vladimir Putin decreed that Neudstadter be granted Russian citizenship. Russian manager Leonid Slutsky has included Neustadter on his 23-man squad for the European Championship which gets underway in France on June 10. The squad also includes Brazilian-born goalkeeper Guilherme of Lokomotiv Moscow, who received Russian citizenship last year. Russian sports minister Vitaly Mutko said in January that the country was working to grant Neustadter a passport but that the process was not simple. Russia, the host nation for the 2018 World Cup, have been drawn alongside England, Wales and Slovakia in Group B for Euro 2016. Russia will play pre-tournament friendlies against the Czech Republic on June 1 before facing Serbia four days later."

His contract was due to expire in June 2017. The 42-year-old, who was Schalke's ninth coach in the last decade, replaced Roberto di Matteo last June. Breitenreiter's successor has not been named, but Augsburg coach Markus Weinzierl has been tipped to take over at the Gelsenkirchen club next season.

Stephan Beckenbauer, son of the 70-year-old legendary defender and Luca's father, died of a brain tumour in July 2015, aged just 46, having worked as a coach in Bayern's academy. His grieving son now wants to make a fresh start away from the Bavarian giants. ""Luca has been toying with the idea for some time,"" Franz Beckenbauer told German daily Bild on Saturday. ""It was his wish to move to a new environment. That will certainly help him in his development."" Schalke's youth academy has produced the likes of Germany stars Mesut Ozil and Manuel Neuer. ""Luca is a very consistent defender and his attacking game is sure to improve at Schalke."" Franz Beckenbauer captained and coached West Germany to the 1974 and 1990 World Cup titles respectively. Beckenbauer was the chairman of the 2006 World Cup's organising committee hosted by Germany.

140,30/04/2016,18:35,Bayern made to wait for historic fourth title in row,Pep Guardiola's Bayern Munich must wait to have their historic fourth consecutive Bundesliga title confirmed after being held to a 1-1 draw at home to Borussia Moenchengladbach on Saturday.,"The champagne had to be put back on ice at the Allianz Arena after Thomas Mueller's first-half header for Bayern was cancelled out by Andre Hahn's superb second-half strike for Gladbach. Second-placed Borussia Dortmund romped to a 5-1 win at home against Wolfsburg to trim Bayern's lead at the top to five points with two games left. Bayern are away to mid-table Ingolstadt next Saturday, then host relegated Hanover on the final day of the season in a fortnight. The draw with Gladbach comes three days before Tuesday's crunch Champions League home semi-final against Atletico Madrid with Bayern having lost the first leg 1-0 away last Wednesday. ""Of course, we had wanted to win today, for our fans and for ourselves,"" said Guardiola. ""We need just a point now, a draw, or a win to secure the title. ""But now there's time to concentrate on Atletico Madrid, it will be a different game on Tuesday. We must play better."" Bayern were punished for sitting back after Mueller's sixth-minute headed opener. Gladbach, one of only two clubs to beat Bayern in the German league this season, hit back when Hahn slotted home on 72 minutes having gone close just moments before. A superb pass from Lars Stindl put Hahn in behind the Bayern defence and he wrong-footed Medhi Benatia before firing his shot past Manuel Neuer. There was some good news for Bayern as Jerome Boateng played his first game since January. The Germany defender is now in line to face Diego Simeone's Atletico with a place in the Champions League final on May 28 at stake. In Dortmund, Borussia hammered Wolfsburg with Japan midfielder Shinji Kagawa scoring their first and creating their second before Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang came off the bench to score twice. The Gabon striker now has 25 league goals this season, leaving him two short of Bayern's Robert Lewandowski. Dortmund took the lead when Henrikh Mkhitaryan's bullet pass was deflected home by Kagawa, who then set up Ramos to leave Dortmund 2-0 up inside nine minutes. Marco Reus grabbed their third by chipping home with an hour gone. Aubameyang replaced Ramos on 69 minutes and scored his first just eight minutes later when Mkhitaryan's pass found him unmarked to header home, then netted a second header just a minute later before Wolfsburg's Andre Schuerrle scored a consolation. At the other end of the table, Hanover 96's relegation was confirmed by their 3-1 defeat to Schalke. Eintracht Frankfurt boosted their survival hopes with a 2-1 win at Darmstadt to go 16th, which carries a two-legged promotion/relegation play-off at the end of the season. But 17th-placed Werder Bremen can push Frankfurt back down the table if they beat VfB Stuttgart, who are 15th, at home on Monday in a crunch relegation battle. Mid-table Hamburg played out a goalless draw at home to Mainz, who stay seventh and on course for a Europa League place. Hoffenheim looked to have escaped relegation under 28-year-old coach Julian Nagelsmann, the youngest in the Bundesliga's history, and they are four points from the drop zone, after their 2-1 win at home to Ingolstadt."
141,16/04/2016,20:34,Lewandowski double puts Bayern 10 points clear,"Bayern Munich are ten points clear, and on the verge of an historic fourth straight Bundesliga title, after Robert Lewandowski netted twice in Saturday's 3-0 win over Schalke.","With second-placed Borussia Dortmund hosting bogey side Hamburg on Sunday, Pep Guardiola's Bayern took the chance to extend their lead at Munich's Allianz Arena. With four league games left and depending on other results, Bayern could be confirmed as the first club to win four straight German league titles when they host Borussia Moechengladbach in a fortnight. Guardiola can sign off his three years in Munich with the treble. Bayern face Bremen in the German Cup semi-finals on Tuesday and have drawn Atletico Madrid in the semi-finals of the Champions League. After a disjointed first-half display in Munich, Bayern went up a gear after the break. Arturo Vidal's header was chested down by Lewandowski, who turned and hit the back of the net on 54 minutes. The Poland hot-shot headed home his 27th league goal of the season on 65 minutes to leave him as the Bundesliga's top scorer, four ahead of Dortmund's Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang. Vidal added Bayern's third when he tapped home after some superb individual skills from Franck Ribery who jinxed his way through the Schalke defence before providing the final pass. Earlier, Bayer Leverkusen climbed to third, and are on course for a direct Champions League place next season, after their 3-0 win over strugglers Eintracht Frankfurt. Kevin Kampl gave Bayer the lead on 70 minutes, just 43 seconds after coming off the bench for Leverkusen's top scorer, Javier Hernandez, who limped off after pulling up with an injury. Julian Brandt and Germany winger Karim Bellarabi then added further goals to leave Frankfurt second from bottom. Leverkusen claim third from Hertha Berlin, who dropped one place after their 2-1 defeat at Hoffenheim. Hertha, who are bidding for a first Champions League place since the 1999/2000 season, are winless in their last three games. Hoffenheim earned the win when Mark Uth headed home at the far post to move his side up to 13th -- three points above the relegation places. Four days after their Champions League quarter-final exit at the hands of Real Madrid, Wolfsburg lost again when they went down 3-2 at relegation-threatened Werder Bremen. Having lost 3-0 in Madrid, Wolfsburg were well beaten as Claudio Pizarro scored his 102nd goal for Bremen, to become the club's all-time top scorer, by converting a first-half penalty. Wolfsburg's France midfielder Josuha Guilavogui equalised before the break, but Bremen netted goals from Fin Bartels and Mali midfielder Sambou Yatabare. Wolfsburg's director of sport Klaus Allofs was dismissed to the stands early in the second half after arguing with the fourth official. The visitors pulled a late goal back when Dutch striker Bas Dost powered a header home, but Wolfsburg stay eighth. Despite the win, Bremen are in the relegation play-off place, but just three points from 11th place as things remain tight at the bottom. Augsburg stayed just above the relegation places with a 1-0 win at home to VfB Stuttgart. Mid-table Darmstadt enjoyed a 2-0 win over Ingolstadt, while on Friday bottom side Hanover 96 enjoyed a 2-0 win over Borussia Moenchengladbach, but remain 12 points from safety."
142,15/04/2016,02:15,"Bring back the fun, Sammer tells Bayern",Bayern Munich sporting director Matthias Sammer has called on his players to rediscover their fun-loving side ahead of Saturday's fixture against Schalke 04.,"The German champions qualified for a fifth consecutive Champions League semi-final this week, and now have the chance to establish a ten point lead at the top of the Bundesliga. Bayern have been grinding out positive results in recent weeks, but have failed to dominate games in the way they are expected to. ""I want to see more desire, more ambition and more enjoyment in our play,"" said Sammer. ""The players should be thinking about what they can achieve."" Sammer was quick to defend the Bayern players, however, arguing that Bayern are currently in a better position than the likes of Barcelona or Real Madrid. ""When you look at the other top clubs in Europe, you see that they are not picking up points. We could be doing some things better, but we are getting results."" After Borussia Dortmund were held to a draw against Schalke last weekend, Bayern now hold a seven-point lead at the top of the table. Victory on Saturday would put them ten points clear for at least one night, with Dortmund set to play Hamburg on Sunday. Dortmund usually fare badly against Hamburg, having picked up just four points from their last seven Bundesliga games against the northern club. Coach Thomas Tuchel is aware that another slip-up would almost certainly spell the end of his team's title chances. ""The most realistic scenario is that Bayern win the title,"" he said. ""I'm not sure if we can pull off a sensational comeback now."" With the title race losing steam, the battle for Europe has become even more significant in the Bundesliga. Only four points separate Hertha Berlin in third and Schalke in seventh. Surprise package Hertha have hit rocky ground in recent weeks. A 5-0 thrashing at the hands of Borussia Mönchengladbach was followed by a 2-2 draw against bottom of the table Hanover 96. The Berliners face another tricky test on Saturday against a Hoffenheim team unbeaten in their last four. Hertha coach Pal Dardai will also be without star youngster Mitchell Weiser, who is serving a one-game suspension. Just one point behind Hertha, Bayer Leverkusen are hoping to secure their place in the top four with a win over relegation threatened Frankfurt. Despite a myriad of defensive injuries, Leverkusen have gone four games without conceding a goal, while Frankfurt have the third worst scoring record in the league. Fifth placed Gladbach will be looking to break their poor run of away form in Hanover on Friday evening. The Foals have just one point from their last five games away from home. ""If we want to finish in the top four, we have to start getting points away from home as well,"" said defender Toni Jantschke. That should be easy against Hanover. With the club nine points adrift at the foot of the table, defeat to Gladbach would see them equal a Bundesliga record of 13 home defeats in one season. Fresh from their Champions League exit at the hands of Real Madrid, Wolfsburg face a Werder Bremen side desperate to haul themselves out of the bottom three. Bremen are hoping to see star striker Claudio Pizarro return to the team after a nearly a month out injured. Saturday will also see Augsburg host fellow relegation rivals Stuttgart, and Darmstadt welcome Ingolstadt. On Sunday, Mainz will be looking to keep their Champions League hopes alive against out of form Cologne. Bundesliga fixtures (all times 1330 GMT unless stated)"
143,10/04/2016,17:39,Dortmund's draw at Schalke puts Bayern on verge of title,"Shinji Kagawa's superb chip was not enough to prevent Borussia Dortmund drawing 2-2 at Schalke on Sunday, edging Bayern Munich towards a historic fourth straight Bundesliga title.","The draw in Gelsenkirchen leaves Pep Guardiola's Bayern seven points clear of second-placed Dortmund with five games left. The Bavarians are hoping to become the first club to win the Bundesliga title four years in a row. ""It is very likely that Bayern will be champions,"" conceded Dortmund coach Thomas Tuchel. The Borussia boss gambled by resting star forwards Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, Marco Reus and Henrikh Mkhitaryan from his starting line-up, but was pleased with the point. Borussia play Liverpool away on Thursday in the Europa League quarter-final return leg at Anfield, after the first match ended in a 1-1 draw. The game at Schalke's Veltins-Arena burst into life after a goalless first half when Japan midfielder Kagawa put Dortmund ahead with a perfectly-timed chip over Schalke goalkeeper Ralf Faehrmann on 49 minutes. Schalke equalised two minutes later when German junior international Leroy Sane, who has been linked with Manchester City, smashed home his shot. Sloppy defending allowed Dortmund to go back in front when Schalke's Roman Neustaedter was out-jumped by Matthias Ginter from a free-kick and the defender headed home on 56 minutes. There was plenty of bite in the derby between the neighbouring clubs, who are only 50kms apart. Dortmund defender Sokratis brought down Klaas-Jan Huntelaar in the area on 66 minutes and the Dutch striker nailed the spot kick. Denmark midfielder Pierre-Emile Hoejbjerg, on loan to Schalke from Bayern, was lucky to escape with only a yellow card when he hacked down Mkhitaryan in the 71st minute. Schalke replacement Max Meyer had the chance to win the game in added time but he fired over the bar with the goal at his mercy. Dortund's 68 points from 29 league games is a club record for this stage of the season, although Bayern have 75 while the draw leaves Schalke seventh, just outside the European places. In 49 of the last 52 Bundesliga seasons, Dortmund's tally would have been enough to win the title outright with a month still left. Bayern are bidding to repeat their 2013 treble of Champions League, Bundesliga and German Cup titles in Guardiola's swansong before taking over as Manchester City manager. The Bavarians play Benfica away in the Champions League quarter-final return leg on Wednesday, holding a slender 1-0 lead from the first match in Munich. Mexico striker Javier Hernandez scored his 16th league goal of the season in Bayer Leverkusen's 2-0 win at Cologne in the Rhine derby. The victory lifted Leverkusen to fourth and into the Champions League places for next season. After junior Germany international Julian Brandt put Leverkusen ahead, 'Chicharito' slotted home from close range just before the break. There was a bad-tempered end during the seven minutes of added time as Cologne's Leonardo Bittencourt was sent off for bringing down Swiss striker Admir Mehmedi. In the heated exchanges immediately after, Leverkusen's Brazil defender Wendell was shown a second yellow card, and subsequent red, for grabbing a Cologne player by the throat. Bayern and Dortmund have already qualified from the Bundesliga for next season's Champions League. But Hertha Berlin, Leverkusen, Borussia Moenchengladbach, Mainz and Schalke are all fighting for third place, which carries a direct place, while fourth carries a play-off place."
144,09/04/2016,18:49,Bayern win Benfica warm up to go eight points clear,Bayern Munich warmed up for Wednesday's crucial Champions League quarter-final at Benfica with a 3-1 win at Stuttgart on Saturday to maintain their iron-grip on the Bundesliga title race with five games left.,"An own goal from Stuttgart defender Georg Niedermeier and a second-half David Alaba strike put Pep Guardiola's Bayern 2-0 up. Daniel Didavi pulled a goal back for Stuttgart with an hour gone as he recovered from stumbling in the area to chip home while lying on the floor before Brazil winger Douglas Costa blasted in Bayern's late third. The win gave Bayern three more points in their quest to become the first club to win four successive German league titles ahead of their return leg in Benfica with Bayern holding a 1-0 lead. ""Now we need three more (league) wins and a draw in order to create something that no team in Germany has ever managed,"" said Guardiola. Bayern's head coach made five changes from the side which beat Benfica in Munich last Tuesday, but Thomas Mueller came on with only 25 minutes gone to replace Arturo Vidal. The Chilean picked up a rash yellow card for a foul on Didavi and came off as Guardiola looked to boost his midfield. With second-placed Borussia Dortmund at arch-rivals Schalke on Sunday in the Ruhr Valley derby, Bayern took their chance to go eight points clear. But having won their preceding three games by 1-0 margins, this was another laboured display from the Bavarians at Stuttgart's Mercedes Benz Arena. ""We had a lot of problems, we attacked well, but we were a bit too lazy and gave away free-kicks and corners,"" added Guardiola. ""We made life complicated for ourselves, but after taking the lead we improved, espcially in the second half, attacking better and the strikers moved more."" Bayern took the lead when Franck Ribery's cross clipped Niedermeier's boot on the way into the Stuttgart net on 31 minutes and the visitors extended their lead when Alaba fired inside the near post on 52 minutes. Mid-table Stuttgart got back in the game when attacking midfielder Didavi, who will play for Wolfsburg next season, managed to lob Bayern goalkeeper Manuel Neuer. The goal came despite Didavi being flat on the turf, when the ball fell into his path after a mistimed clearance by Munich striker Robert Lewandowski. In the final ten minutes, Bayern's Thiago hit the crossbar before Costa smashed in their third goal from the edge of the area. Borussia Moenchengladbach stay fourth despite their 1-0 defeat at Ingolstadt. At the bottom, Hoffenheim, coached by 28-year-old Julian Nagelsmann, the youngest ever coach in Germany's top flight, are now three points clear of the relegation places after their 2-0 win at second from bottom Eintracht Frankfurt. Midfielder Nadiem Amiri, who netted just a minute after coming off the bench, and forward Mark Uth scored their second-half goals. Under Nagelsmann, Hoffenheim have now taken 17 points in their last nine games to climb out of the bottom three to 14th. Augsburg escaped the bottom three, and dropped opponents Werder Bremen into the relegation places, with a 2-1 win in north Germany as South Korea defender Hong Jeong-Ho scored their dramatic 87th-minute winner. Mid-table Darmstadt enjoyed a 2-1 win at Hamburg while on Friday Hertha Berlin were held to a 2-2 draw at home to bottom side Hanover."

With your support it will be easier for me. I want to thank every single fan, club and companion in my last 17 years as a professional footballer,"" Hildebrand wrote on his Facebook page. The ex-Germany shot-stopper is without a club and has decided to hang up his gloves after a move to an MLS club in the United States fell through. Hildebrand set the German league record in nine games, bridging the 2002/03 and 2003/04 seasons. ""This record was part of an outstanding team performance. If anyone manages to beat it, it will be Bayern and Manuel,"" Hildebrand magazine Kicker. Bayern Munich's Manuel Neuer came closest to beating Hildebrand's figure in 2011 when he went 770 minutes unbeaten in the German league. Hildebrand won the last of his seven caps for Germany in 2007 and made 301 appearances in the Bundesliga for VfB Stuttgart, Hoffenheim, Schalke 04 and Eintracht Frankfurt. He also had spells at Valencia and Sporting Lisbon after winning the Bundesliga title with Stuttgart in the 2006/07 season.

Hildebrand has signed up to study for his coaching licence and says he may well work for VfB Stuttgart in the future. ""I am rooted to the club and can well imagine doing something at VfB in the future. I have good contacts,"" he said. For now he is busy with projects in sports business and event management and is a partner in a supermarket chain of vegan food."

Later on Saturday, second-placed Borussia Dortmund host leaders Bayern Munich in a mouth-watering clash. Draxler, who also netted in Wolfsburg's 4-0 drubbing of bottom side Hanover 96 on Tuesday, opened the scoring at Wolfsburg's Volkswagen Arena.

Koo, playing his sixth season in Germany after spells at Wolfsburg and Mainz, wrapped up his hat-trick inside the hour. Leverkusen fought back with goals by Karim Bellarabi and an own goal from Augsburg's Dutch defender Paul Verhaegh on 80 minutes. In the dying stages, defender Jeffrey Gouweleeuw used his hands to block a shot which saw the referee point straight to the penalty spot. Augsburg were denied a first win over Leverkusen at the tenth attempt when Hakan Calhanoglu converted the 92nd-minute spot kick as Gouweleeuw was sent off. Leverkusen's suspended coach Roger Schmidt was in Spain to watch Villarreal ahead of their Europa League last 16, first leg trip on Thursday. Having shocked Leverkusen 4-1 on Wednesday when Claudio Pizarro scored a hat-trick, Werder Bremen pulled further away from the relegation zone with a 4-1 thrashing at home to bottom side Hanover 96. The 37-year-old Pizarro claimed his fourth goal in two games, and his 11th league goal of the season, when he flicked the ball over his shoulder, beating three defenders, and rifled home on 26 minutes. He then provided an assist as Czech international Gebre Selassie added Bremen's third on 56 minutes. Stuttgart are now up to mid-table after their 5-1 thrashing of second-from-bottom Hoffenheim as defender Georg Niedermeier netted twice.

Colombia striker Jhon Cordoba came off the bench to seal only Mainz's second victory in Munich with the winner on 86 minutes to finish off a counter-attack. ""We had our chances and then let them counter-attack. We shouldn't have allowed that to happen,"" fumed Bayern's goal-scorer Arjen Robben. Mainz took a shock lead at the Allianz Arena when Spanish winger Jairo fired home in the first-half with the Bayern defence well beaten. Robben pulled a goal back for the Bavarians on 64 minutes. Despite Mainz managing only 22 percent of possession, Cordoba grabbed the late winner and was mobbed by his team-mates. ""We knew how we could win here with a strong defensive display and a good counter-attack,"" said Mainz coach Martin Schmidt, who praised his side's 'outstanding display'. ""It feels really good."" Dortmund's 2-0 win at Darmstadt on Wednesday cut Bayern's lead from eight points to five as another Colombia striker, Adrian Ramos, and defender Erik Durm netted. ""We and Bayern both know that things can now be a bit tight. We want to win the thing,"" said Dortmund's Germany defender Durm. Hertha Berlin cemented third place, but remain 15 points adrift of Dortmund, with a 2-0 win over Eintracht Frankfurt in the capital. Ivory Coast striker Salomon Kalou and Mitchell Weiser scored to keep Hertha on course for a first return to the Champions League since 2000. At the other end of the table, Werder Bremen climbed out of the relegation places with a shock 4-1 win at Bayer Leverkusen as veteran Claudio Pizarro claimed a hat-trick. The 37-year-old Peru international showed why he is the Bundesliga's top scoring foreigner by needing just under half an hour to wrap up his hat-trick which included a penalty. Having knocked Leverkusen out of the German Cup in the quarter-finals last month, Bremen again humbled Bayer. Roger Schmidt's Leverkusen has now lost four of their last five games in all competitions and drop to seventh in the league. Elsewhere Schalke climbed to sixth with a 3-2 comeback win at home to Hamburg while Borussia Moenchengladbach remain fourth after their 4-0 thrashing at home to Stuttgart. Second-from-bottom Hoffenheim boosted their survival chances with a 2-1 win over Augsburg. On Tuesday, Germany winger Andre Schuerrle claimed the first Bundesliga hat-trick of his career as Wolfsburg routed bottom side Hanover 96 4-0 away. March 1 is a lucky day for Schuerrle who also scored a hat-trick for ex-club Chelsea against Fulham in the Premier League exactly two years ago. His performance will boost his standing at Wolfsburg and in this one game he has scored more goals than in his previous 33 matches for the Champions League side. He needed just 26 minutes to score three goals before Germany team-mate Julian Draxler added Wolfsburg's fourth at Hanover's HDI Arena. The win leaves Wolfsburg eighth while Hanover are bottom, four points from their nearest rival and seven points from safety. The German FA (DFB) is expected to fine both clubs after one of the flares fired from the away fan block hit the Hanover bench before kick-off, but no-one was hurt. Elsewhere, French striker Anthony Modeste rescued a point for Cologne in their 1-1 draw at Ingolstadt after forward Lukas Hinterseer had given the hosts the lead."

""He frequently tried to return to training, but he was never 100 percent,"" said Schalke coach Andre Breitenreiter. ""That is why the medical staff decided to send him back to Japan to see his surgeon. ""From what I have heard, he will stay there for the next few weeks.

Aogo initially thought the bag had been taken as a practical joke by his Schalke team-mates, but it quickly emerged that it had been stolen and initially, it was unclear whether Aogo could fly without his passport. Fortunately, the police were able to issue him with a provisional passport, so he could fly with his team-mates, and then scanned the airport's CCTV cameras to see if they could catch the thief. It was a stressful start to the away match as Aogo, who has made 12 appearances for Germany, looks to play his first match since November after an Achilles tendon injury."

Argentina striker Franco di Santo scored his first goal for Schalke after 15 games in the blue shirt, with an 82nd-minute header. ""If we hadn't won again, we would have slowly lost our touch,"" said goal-scorer Geis. ""The pressure is always there, especially if you haven't won your last five games. ""But you can feel the fans support and they have strengthened us."" The win had an extra element of relief as Schalke's strikers Huntelaar and Di Santos both netted after previously scoring just four league goals between them this term. ""The fans gave us the extra energy,"" said Holland's Huntelaar, the Bundesliga's top scorer in the 2011/12 season as Schalke have now just three games left before the winter break starts in a fortnight."
161,21/11/2015,20:50,Martinez breaks drought as Bayern go eight clear,Javi Martinez scored his first goal for Bayern Munich for two years on Saturday in his side's 3-1 win at Schalke 04 which opened an eight-point lead.,"After second-placed Borussia Dortmund's shock 3-1 defeat at Hamburg on Friday, Pep Guardiola's Bayern took their chance to extend their lead. David Alaba's early goal was cancelled out by Schalke's Max Meyer before Martinez, then Thomas Mueller struck for Bayern. They took a fortuitous lead in Gelsenkirchen when Alaba's long-range shot clipped Leon Goretzka's heel and flew into the Schalke net with nine minutes gone. Schalke drew level through Meyer's superb goal on 17 minutes when he turned Bayern captain Philipp Lahm and powered his shot past goalkeeper Manuel Neuer. But Bayern maintained their unbeaten record in Germany's top flight when Spain's Martinez headed Arjen Robben's pin-point cross on 69 minutes. It was the centre-back's first league goal for Bayern since August 2013, then Mueller added a late third by curling his shot inside the far post. Earlier, Germany striker Max Kruse netted twice in Wolfsburg's 6-0 rout of Werder Bremen. Kruse said he was glad to get back to football after the horror scenes from Paris and the postponed Germany-Holland friendly in Hannover last Tuesday due to a bomb scare. There was a minute's silence at all Bundesliga grounds -- the players also wore black armbands -- out of respect for the Paris victims. ""Of course you have a few thoughts after a week like that, but we have to go out as role models and not be put off by what has happened,"" said Kruse. Stuttgart's 4-0 thumping at home to Augsburg was delayed by 15 minutes due to the tightened security checks at stadiums across the country. There were no such problems at Wolfsburg's Volkswagen Arena as Bremen gifted the opener when defender Alejandro Galvez slid the ball into his own net on 11 minutes. Kruse put Wolfsburg 2-0 up at the break by heading home a free-kick then Portugal international Vierinha netted on 56 minutes. The floodgates opened when France midfielder Josuha Guilavogui, on for the injured Brazil star Luiz Gustavo, stabbed home his shot, Kruse then set up Netherlands striker Bas Dost on 78 minutes. He completed the scoring three minutes from time by converting a cross. The result leaves Wolfsburg five points behind Dortmund. Borussia Moenchengladbach are up to fourth as Andre Schubert celebrated his first match in charge as head coach with a 2-1 win at home to Hanover 96. Having taken over in September with Borussia bottom of the table, the 42-year-old has been promoted from a caretaker role after steering Gladbach to seven wins and a draw in his eight league games. Gladbach took the lead when Guinea midfielder Ibrahima Traore was left unmarked on the edge of the area with half an hour gone. Hanover equalised through Poland international Artur Sobiech on 65 minutes, but Brazil striker Raffael scored the winner six minutes from time. Ex-Manchester United star Javier Hernandez scored his first brace for Bayer Leverkusen in their 3-1 win at Eintracht Frankfurt. Christmas came early for Hernandez in Frankfurt when Eintracht centre-back David Abraham allowed a cross to roll between his legs and the striker stabbed home on 11 minutes. The Mexico striker doubled his tally on 39 minutes when Hakan Calhanoglu's pass split the Frankfurt defence. Hernandez did the rest, but it finished 2-1 at the break when Serbian midfielder Slobodan Medojevic headed home on the stroke of half-time. Calhanoglu sealed the win with Leverkusen's third goal on 72 minutes. Augsburg climbed off the bottom of the table with an emphatic 4-0 win at VfB Stuttgart as woeful defending by the hosts allowed the visitors to take an early 2-0 lead with both goals by midfielder Alexander Esswein. Defender Jan-Ingwer Callsen-Bracker grabbed a third before former South Korea captain Koo Ja-Cheol scored Augsburg's fourth when he hit the top right-hand corner from 10 metres out on 54 minutes. The Rhine derby finished goalless as Mainz drew at Cologne as the hosts abandoned plans to play in a special-edition carnival-themed shirt out of respect for those who died in Paris."
162,18/11/2015,21:27,Dortmund's Christmas tree gets a Schalke flag,The towering Christmas tree in Dortmund's city centre has become a good-natured battle ground between rival football fans after a Schalke flag was spotted flying from the 45-metre giant.,"Just 35 kilometres (21 miles) separates Borussia Dortmund's Signal Iduna Park stadium from Schalke's Veltins Arena in the Ruhr Valley and there is an intense rivalry between the neighbouring clubs. Borussia won the Ruhr derby 3-2 at home a fortnight ago, but Schalke fans had the last laugh by flying their team's blue and white flag from the huge Christmas tree in the centre of Dortmund last weekend. Anyone supporting Gelsenkirchen-based Schalke in Dortmund can expect trouble and the scaffolding company responsible for ensuring the 40,000kg (40 tonnes) tree stands safely has been told to pay a tongue-in-cheek fine to charity. ""I have informed the scaffolding company that I expect a penalty of 500 euros $532),"" the tree's organiser Hans-Peter Arens told local newspaper WAZ. The scaffolding firm responsible is based in Dortmund, but a large number of their employees hail from Bottrop, near Gelsenkirchen, -- deep in the heartland of Schalke fans. A Dortmund supporter in the team of scaffolders restored order on Monday by flying a yellow and black Borussia flag from the tree and Arens said there will be no fine on this occasion. ""I can hardly hand out a fine when there is a Borussia Dortmund flag hanging from the tree,"" he quipped."
163,08/11/2015,17:36,Aubameyang strikes again as Dortmund edge tense derby,Gabon striker Pierre-Emerick Aubamenyang claimed his 14th Bundesliga goal of the season as Borussia Dortmund edged past arch-rivals Schalke to win a tense Ruhr derby 3-2 on Sunday.,"Aubameyang joined Bayern Munich striker Robert Lewandowski as the league's top scorer by netting Dortmund's third after Japan midfielder Shinji Kagawa and Germany defender Matthias Ginter had netted at Borussia's Signal Iduna Park stadium. Schalke are now winless in their last six matches, but the Royal Blues fought to the end as Netherlands striker Klaas-Jan Huntelaar scored goals in each half following mistakes in the Dortmund defence. ""There was no need for it to have been so tense at the end,"" admitted Dortmund coach Thomas Tuchel as his side enjoyed their seventh-straight win in all competitions. ""We had so many high-quality chances that we could have made it 4-1, but I had the feeling that the players didn't want to make any mistakes, which made us tense."" The result leaves second-placed Dortmund five points behind Bundesliga leaders Bayern, and eight points clear of third-placed Wolfsburg, while Schalke stay fifth. After Kagawa gave Dortmund a 30th-minute lead with a rare header, Huntelaar equalised three minutes later after Borussia captain Mats Hummels gave the ball away. The hosts then netted twice as Ginter was left unmarked at a corner on 43 minutes as it finished 2-1 at the break. Aubameyang then slotted what proved to be the winning goal after a superb final pass from Gonzalo Castro, who started on the left wing in place of injured Germany star Marco Reus. Aubameyang received a yellow card after pulling off his shirt in celebration to reveal a T-shirt bearing the text 'Do you remember?' under the Batman logo, having donned a ""Caped Crusader"" outfit in the derby last February when he also scored in a 3-0 win over Schalke. But Huntelaar grabbed his second when Dortmund centre-back Sokratis tried to back-heel a cross, but the ball landed at the feet of the Dutch player who slotted home on 71 minutes. Schalke's Pierre-Emile Hoejbjerg hit the post with ten minutes to go, then cleared a Dortmund shot off the line in the dying stages. Aubameyang is again the league's joint top-scorer alongside Lewandowski, who netted his 14th league goal in Bayern's 4-0 win over VfB Stuttgart on Saturday. The Bavarian giants' star-studded attack ran riot with Arjen Robben, Douglas Costa and Thomas Mueller also getting on the scoresheet as defeat pushed Stuttgart back into the bottom three. Bayern have turned the Allianz Arena into a fortress by scoring 28 goals in their last six home games, conceding just three, and have now claimed 34 points from 36 and are the only unbeaten team in Germany's top flight. Augsburg remain bottom of the league after their 2-1 defeat at home to Werder Bremen on Sunday when Peru veteran Claudio Pizarro, 37, scored his first goal since his return from Bayern. Midfielder Fin Bartels doubled the visitors lead on 69 minutes before Augsburg defender Paul Verhaegh netted a late penalty as Bremen moved up to 14th. Wolfsburg, last season's runners-up, are 13 points adrift of Bayern after crashing to a 2-0 defeat at Mainz on Saturday as Pablo de Blasis and Yunus Mali scored. Wolfsburg also had Germany midfielder Julian Draxler sent off early on. Fellow Champions League side Bayer Leverkusen were also beaten as they suffered a 2-1 defeat at home to neighbours Cologne in the Rhine derby as defender Dominic Maroh scored the visitors goals while Javier Hernandez scored for the sixth match running. His Leverkusen team was reduced to 10 men when defender Kyriakos Papadopoulos was shown a red card. Hoffenheim remain second from bottom after their goalless draw with Eintracht Frankfurt while Hamburg drew 1-1 at Darmstadt as Pierre-Michel Lasogga's first-half penalty was cancelled out by Marcel Heller's equaliser for hosts Darmstadt. Borussia Moenchengladbach had their six-match winning streak under caretaker coach Andre Schubert ended by a goalless draw at home to Ingolstadt. On Friday, Ivory Coast striker Salomon Kalou grabbed a hat-trick to steer Hertha Berlin to a 3-1 win at Hanover and into the top four."
164,07/11/2015,16:58,Rising star Sane poised for Germany debut,Schalke's rising star Leroy Sane is set for a big week in his fledgling career ahead of Sunday's crunch derby against Borussia Dortmund after being called into Germany's senior squad.,"The talented 19-year-old has attracted the attention of Premier League sides Liverpool and Arsenal with match-winning goals for Schalke in Germany's top-flight this season. He is poised to play in his first Ruhr Valley derby at the Royal Blues' arch-rivals Dortmund and could make his senior international debut against France in Paris next Friday, or four days later against the Netherlands in Hanover. ""We've already got to know him in our youth selections and he's one of the big positives to have emerged from the current season,"" said Germany's head coach Joachim Loew after calling up Sane on Friday. ""He's quick, technically gifted and he likes going one-on-one with his opponents, while he's totally easy-going. We can see his enormous potential."" Sane's rise has been meteoric despite making just 25 Bundesliga appearances before his senior call-up. The eldest son of ex-Senegal striker Soulemayne Sane and former German Olympic gymnast Regina Sane-Weber, Leroy joined Schalke's academy aged nine while both of his younger brothers play for the club's junior teams. He broke into the senior Schalke side by making his German league debut in April 2014 -- just three months after his 18th birthday. ""Leroy has inherited great genes from his father,"" said Schalke's director of sport Horst Heldt at the time. ""We hope that he'll follow in his footsteps."" Sane jnr scored his first goal on only his fourth league appearance, then produced a superb strike away to Real Madrid last March in the Champions League which alerted the rest of Europe to his precocious talent. Two of his four league goals this season have been match-winners, while he rescued a point with an equalising header in last Saturday's 1-1 draw against Ingolstadt. His length-of-the-pitch sprint led to Schalke's third goal by Klaas-Jan Huntelaar in a 3-0 rout of Werder Bremen on the season's opening day, proving he can create as well as finish chances. Gabon striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang is Dortmund's top scorer with 13 goals in 11 league games, while Sane is Schalke's top hot-shot, scoring four times from the right wing. He can play either on the wing or as a striker. His big hair matches his confidence, but he admits to being nervous about Sunday's derby as Schalke attempt to avenge their 3-0 defeat at Dortmund last February. ""I'm a bit nervous, but I'm obviously really looking forward to the game, it's one of our most important of the season. I am really fired up for the derby atmosphere,"" he said. ""I'm obviously very happy that I have scored four goals already. ""I don't see it as a burden, I see it more as a challenge and my aim is to score eight goals this season. ""That's what I said at the start of the season. I didn't want to set my aims too high, but so far, it's been going very well. ""I'll obviously try my best to score another goal. Maybe I can even get two for once. But it will definitely be a very, very difficult game against Dortmund."" Dortmund, who started the weekend second, have won their last six games while fifth-placed Schalke are winless in their last five, but Sane says form counts for nothing when neighbours clash. ""None of that matters in the derby. Every player is fired up, everyone wants to win at all costs,"" said the teenager. ""We have to compete from the start and then take our chances. ""Then we'll start playing better in general and winning games again."""
165,07/11/2015,13:48,Dortmund without injured Reus for derby clash,Borussia Dortmund's goal-machine shows no sign of slowing for Sunday's crunch Bundesliga derby clash against Schalke 04 -- even without injured Germany winger Marco Reus.,"Dortmund have scored 68 goals in 21 games so far this season under new coach Thomas Tuchel, but will be without groin-strain victim Reus for the home derby against Schalke. Reus picked up the injury while scoring Dortmund's opening goal in Thursday's 4-0 rout of Armenia's FK Qabala in the Europa League and his place on Dortmund's left wing is set to go to Jonas Hofmann or Gonzalo Castro. Even after Reus went off, Dortmund still managed to score three more goals through Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and winger Henrikh Mkhitaryan. ""We still have a wide number of players who are dangerous,"" said Dortmund's director of sport Michael Zorc as only leaders Bayern Munich have scored more goals in the Bundesliga. ""That's what makes a good team."" While Dortmund have had no trouble finding the net, Schalke have struggled in front of goal and only netted 14 goals in 11 games this season. That's just one more than Borussia's Gabon striker Aubameyang has managed on his own in Germany's top flight this season in a total tally of 21 goals in all competitons. ""It's a really important game for Dortmund fans... you can lose all your matches, but the derby is the one they want you to win,"" said Aubameyang. ""I'm sure we'll win, because we're at home and the team is playing well."" Borussia are second in the table and have won their last six games, while Schalke are down to fifth and winless in their last five, but form counts for little in a derby, according to Royal Blues midfielder Leon Goretzka. ""You shouldn't pay too much attention to what the current table says before a derby,"" he said after their 1-1 draw on Thursday at Sparta Prague in the Europa League. ""Even if we're 18th and Dortmund are first, you can still win."" Dortmund trounced Schalke 3-0 when the teams last met at Borussia's Signal Iduna Park stadium in February as the hosts fired in 31 shots on goal, while the Royal Blues set a league record low of just three in reply. ""We have a little something to make up,"" admitted Schalke's goalkeeper Ralf Fahrmann. Schalke's top scorer is teenage rising star Leroy Sane, who has netted four times in 11 games and his eye-catching displays have led to the 19-year-old being called up to Germany's senior squad for forthcoming internationals against France and the Netherlands."
166,31/10/2015,19:05,"Oh, brother! Matip siblings face off in Bundesliga","Cameroon internationals Joel and Marvin Matip went head-to-head for the first time in the Bundesliga on Saturday when Joel's Schalke were held 1-1 by Ingolstadt, captained by brother Marvin.","It was the 24th time brothers have been on opposing teams in the Bundesliga and Joel specially ordered 15 tickets so family members could go to the game. Ingolstadt took a shock first-half lead through Tobias Levels at Gelsenkirchen's Veltins Arena. But it was the Matip brothers' Cameroon team-mate Eric Choupo-Moting who provided the final pass for Germany Under-21 striker Leroy Sane to head home the equaliser on 77 minutes. The Matip brothers were born to a German mother in Bochum, but father Jean has lived in Germany since 1975 and seen both of his sons play for Cameroon. The 55-year-old said he would be wearing the green shirt of Cameroon in Gelsenkirchen as he did not want to favour either son, whose educations he funded to make sure their dreams of playing professional football came true. ""Since the boys were six years old, I told them there'd be no football without your abitur (university entrance exam),"" he told German daily Bild. ""They went to a private school, otherwise it wouldn't have worked."" Having risen up through Schalke's academy, strapping centre-back Joel, 24, made his league debut for the Royal Blues in November 2009. Despite an approach from the German Football Association (DFB), he opted for Cameroon and made his debut for the Indomitable Lions in a friendly against Italy in March 2010. Marvin, 30, was included in the Cameroon squad in 2008, but his name had to be taken off the list as he had already played for Germany at under-20 level and an application had to be made to FIFA to allow him to switch. He eventually made his senior international debut in 2013 and the centre-back is now captaining Ingolstadt in their first campaign in Germany's top flight after they won the second division last season."
167,15/10/2015,20:12,Spanish legend Raul to retire after season,"Spanish striker Raul, the 38-year-old former Real Madrid star now playing for the New York Cosmos, announced Thursday he will retire when the minor-league club's season ends next month.","Raul began his pro career at Real Madrid in 1994 and spent 16 years with the Spanish side, sparking the capital side to six La Liga crowns, four Spanish Super Cups and three UEFA Champions League titles. He departed in 2010 as Real Madrid's all-time top goal scorer with 323, before recently being equalled by Cristiano Ronaldo on September 30th. After netting 40 goals in 98 matches for Germany's Schalke 04 and helping the Bundesliga side to the 2011 Champions League semi-finals, he departed in 2012 for Qatari side Al-Sadd and retired in 2014 only to make a comeback late last year with the Cosmos, who play in the second-tier North American Soccer League (NASL). ""When I signed for the New York Cosmos in December, I said I would evaluate how I felt towards the end of the year and assess whether I would continue to play,"" Raul said. ""My decision is to retire from playing at the end of this season. I am fully focused on finishing the season strong and helping the New York Cosmos win the NASL championship. In the coming months I will decide the next step in my career."" The Cosmos rank third behind Ottawa and Minnesota in the table with two regular-season matches remaining. ""The decision to retire is not an easy one but I believe it is the right time,"" Raul said. Raul has seven goals in 26 appearances for the Cosmos. ""Raul is one of the world's most iconic players,"" Cosmos coach Giovanni Savarese said. ""I knew when we signed him what he would bring on to the pitch but his knowledge, passion, professionalism and commitment exceeded my expectations."""
168,04/10/2015,17:48,Cologne stun hapless Schalke,Third-placed Schalke crashed to their first defeat in seven games on Sunday as they were stunned 3-0 at home to Cologne.,"With leaders Bayern Munich hosting second-placed Borussia Dortmund later, Schalke missed their chance to climb one place in the table as they were soundly beaten by Cologne, a surprise package this season, who are now fifth. Schalke had been flying high after four Bundesliga wins and two Europa League victories before Sunday's kick-off. Cologne's French striker Anthony Modeste claimed his sixth goal in eight games when he netted a Leonardo Bittencourt pass on the stroke of half-time at Schalke before the guests ran riot in the final ten minutes. Cologne doubled their lead at Gelsenkirchen's Veltins Arena when defensive midfielder Yannick Gerhardt slotted home after beating three defenders to make a mockery of the home back four, on 79 minutes. To compound Schalke's misery, substitute Simon Voller drilled his shot into the bottom right-hand corner, just a minute after coming on, to wrap up the three points on 84 minutes. On Saturday, Borussia Moenchengladbach continued their rise up the table as they bounced back from their midweek Champions League defeat against Manchester City with a 2-0 win over Wolfsburg. Norway midfielder Haavard Nordtvelt and French-born Guinean winger Ibrahima Traore did the damage to leave Gladbach now 13th and four points above the relegation places, having been bottom a fortnight ago, while Wolfsburg dropped to ninth. It was their third straight league match under caretaker coach Andre Schubert after Lucien Favre's sudden resignation. Hertha Berlin's impressive season continued as they climbed to fourth with a 3-0 win over Hamburg in the capital as Salomon Kalou gave the hosts a first-half lead, then Vedad Ibisevic netted twice in as many minutes. Hoffenheim and VfB Stuttgart remain in the bottom four after their 2-2 draw. Germany international winger Kevin Volland scored both goals for hosts Hoffenheim while bottom side Stuttgart rescued a point as Pirmin Schwegler scored a 90th-minute equaliser. Hanover won their first match of the season as they defeated Werder Bremen 1-0 thanks to the only goal on 56 minutes through French-born Senegalese international Salif Sane. Bavaria's Ingolstadt, who are in their debut Bundesliga season, defeated Eintracht Frankfurt 2-0 with late goals from Pascal Gross and Stefan Lex to take sixth spot.

Liverpool were ready to pay for him,"" said Heldt. According to magazine Sport Bild, Liverpool offered 15 million euros (£11m, $16.74m) for the fleet-footed teenager who has scored in each of Schalke's last three games and has a contract until 2019. ""The offer didn't interest us or the player,"" insisted Heldt. The son of ex-Senegal international Souleyman Sane has made waves in the Bundesliga with a series of eye-catching performances off the bench and he scored a superb goal at Real Madrid in the Champions League last season. He was part of the Schalke team which won the Under-19 German league title and made his Bundesliga debut for the senior team in 2014. He scored the winning goal in Schalke's 1-0 victory over Hamburg last weekend wich left the Royal Blues third in the table. ""From the potential he is showing, Leroy has a big career ahead of him and is on the right path,"" said Schalke coach Andre Breitenreiter. Sane, who can play as a striker or winger, was already being courted by Europe's top teams as a 17-year-old when Ajax made a five-million-euro offer for him. Having sold Germany international Julian Draxler to Wolfsburg before the last transfer window closed, it looks like the Royal Blues face a battle to keep another one of their rising stars."

Hertha should have equalised before the break as striker Vedad Ibisevic headed onto the post, then fired over the bar. But they finally drew level on 82 minutes when substitute Alexander Baumjohann chested the ball through to Darida and the ex-Freiburg attacking midfielder slammed his shot past Frankfurt goalkeeper Lukas Hradecky. The point leaves Hertha sixth and Frankfurt 10th in the table. With second-placed Borussia Dortmund hosting Darmstadt on Sunday evening, defending champions Bayern Munich took the chance to go five points clear on Saturday with a 3-0 win at Mainz as Robert Lewandowski's goal haul continued. The Poland hot-shot took his tally to 101 Bundesliga goals and has now scored 10 goals in just six league games this season. Having sent German league records tumbling last Tuesday with five goals in just nine minutes after coming the bench in the 5-1 rout of Wolfsburg, the 27-year-old claimed two more against Mainz before Bayern host Dinamo Zagreb in the Champions League on Tuesday. Lewandowski marked his 100th Bundesliga goal by heading Kingsley Coman's cross inside the far post on 51 minutes and pulled up his shirt to reveal a T-Shirt which stated: ""100"". ""The T-Shirt was my idea, I didn't know if I'd score today, but you always have to think positively, which is why I had it made,"" he told reporters. An Arturo Vidal pass then put Lewandowski in behind the defence to round the goalkeeper for his 101st on 63 minutes. France Under-21 winger Coman grabbed Bayern's third five minutes later with a simple tap in from a Douglas Costa cross. Schalke remain third after Germany Under-21 attacking midfielder Leroy Sane scored for his third game in succession to seal Saturday's 1-0 win at Hamburg with a superb strike on the hour. Bayer Leverkusen, who play European champions Barcelona away on Tuesday, romped to a 3-0 win at Werder Bremen with goals by Swiss forward Admir Mehmedi, winger Kevin Kampl and Germany Under-21 talent Julian Brandt.

Bas Dost's header was cancelled out by Japan midfielder Hiroshi Kiyotake's superb volley on 57 minutes to leave Wolves fourth in the table. Borussia Moenchengladbach, who host Manchester City on Wednesday, picked up their second win since Lucien Favre's shock resignation last Sunday with a 3-1 victory at VfB Stuttgart. The goals came from Granit Xhaka, a Christian Gentner own-goal and Raffel's late effort afer Daniel Ginczek slotted a 40th-minute penalty for Stuttgart. Hoffenheim climbed to 15th with a 3-1 win at Augsburg as Germany international Kevin Volland scored twice, including a second-half penalty."
171,20/09/2015,17:50,Sane strike seals Schalke's win at Stuttgart,Schalke's Leroy Sane underlined his status as one of Germany's rising junior stars with his club's second-half winner to seal Sunday's 1-0 victory at VfB Stuttgart in the Bundesliga.,"The Germany Under-19 international, who scored three goals in 13 games last season, calmly slotted home Schalke's 53rd-minute decider after pouncing on a mistake in the Stuttgart defence and the victory left Schalke fourth. Sane, whose father is ex-Senegal international Souleyman Sane, only made his Bundesliga debut in April 2014 and scored in Schalke's stunning 4-3 Champions League win at Real Madrid, last season, before bowing out of the last-16 on aggregate. The defeat is Stuttgart's fifth in succession to leave them 17th and they only stay off the bottom of the table by virtue of goal difference from Borussia Moenchengladbach. Borussia Dortmund have the chance to reclaim top spot on Sunday evening when they host Bayer Leverkusen looking to defend their unbeaten record after Bayern Munich took over first place after Saturday's 3-0 win at Darmstadt. Pep Guardiola's Bayern, who are bidding to become the first team to win the German league four times in succession, have won all five games so far this season. All three scorers -- Arturo Vidal, Kingsley Coman and Sebastian Rode -- claimed their first goals of the season with Munich's star forward Robert Lewandowski injured and Thomas Mueller on the bench. The result left Darmstadt in 12th place and still chasing their first win over Bayern after seven failed attempts. Gladbach's disastrous start to the season continued as they suffered their fifth straight defeat in losing 1-0 at neighbours Cologne in the Rhineland derby to stay bottom of the table. French striker Anthony Modeste claimed his seventh goal in all competitions, and his fourth in the Bundesliga this season, with a crisp header on 64 minutes. The victory left Cologne fifth while Gladbach, who lost their opening Champions League group stage match 3-0 at Seville on Tuesday, remain rooted to the foot of the table. Wolfsburg, who play at Bayern Munich on Tuesday, celebrated their 70th birthday with a 2-0 win at home to Hertha Berlin as Dutch striker Bas Dost netted twice and lifted his side up to third. After coming off the bench on 71 minutes, Dost netted the opener five minutes later, then drilled home a penalty on 89 minutes after a foul on Germany international Julian Draxler. But Dost was later slammed by his coach Dieter Hecking for behaving 'like someone had taken his toys away' in training having been subbed off in Wolfsburg's Champions League win at home to CSKA Moscow last Tuesday. Ingolstadt made history as the first Bundesliga team to win all three of their home games in their debut season in Germany's top flight after Moritz Hartmann drilled home a 93rd-minute penalty which put the Bavarians fifth with a 1-0 win at Werder Bremen. Bremen were reduced to ten men five minutes into injury time when midfielder Philipp Bargfrede was sent off for fouling Ingolstsadt's USA international Alfredo Morales. Hamburg were held to a goalless draw at home to Eintracht Frankfurt while Mainz are seventh after Friday's 3-0 win at home to Hoffenheim when midfielder Yunus Malli claimed a hat-trick."
172,03/09/2015,17:50,Bundesliga clubs reach out to Germany's refugees,German Bundesliga club Bayern Munich on Thursday announced it will donate one million euros (US$1.1m) to projects supporting some of the refugees pouring into Germany amidst the ongoing Europe-wide crisis.,"The club is working with Munich authorities to set up 'training camps' for children to receive German lessons, meals and football kits. The city of Munich has been particularly affected by the refugee crisis after local police reported that more than 100 migrants arrived in an hour on Wednesday in the Bavarian capital. For their next home match against Augsburg on September 12, Bayern players will walk out hand-in-hand with both a German and a refugee child as a mark of support for the integration of refugees. ""We at FC Bayern consider it our socio-political responsibility to help displaced and needy children, women and men, by supporting and assisting them in Germany,"" Bayern's chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge wrote on the club's website. So far this year, German police have recorded over 125,000 illegal entries, more than double last year's total of about 57,000, with many coming from war-torn Syria as well as from Eritrea, Afghanistan, Kosovo and Serbia. The influx has sparked a wave of attacks on asylum-seekers and violent protests against foreigners. Chancellor Angela Merkel has said Germany will have ""no tolerance"" for ""shameful and vile"" violence against refugees. Germany's World Cup-winning footballers have condemned xenophobic attacks and led calls to help the refugees. The German Football Association (DFB) has produced a video in which a group of star players appear holding up signs condemning violence and calling for ""respect"", ""help"", ""integration"" and ""fairplay"" towards any refugee arriving in Germany. In Germany's football community, Bayern are not alone in offering help to those seeking refuge in Germany, with Europe's biggest economy this year expecting a record 800,000 asylum applications, more than any other EU country. Bayern's Bundesliga rivals Schalke invited 100 refugees to their opening home game of the season and have founded the ""Kumpel-Kiste"" (""mate's box"") initiative where clothes and toys can be sent to refugees. Schalke have released a video showing club legend Gerald Asamoah, the first African-born footballer to play for Germany, talking about the importance of understanding what the refugees are going through. In the video for the programme ""Stand Up"", Asamoah appears with the Schalke team and says the insults players hear from the terraces during a 90-minute match are nothing compared to what many refugees are experiencing on a daily basis in Germany as they wait to receive asylum. ""Ask yourself: Why are we doing this. If everyone shows some civil courage, if we talk about the issue and say, 'This isn't right!' then we can achieve so much. We have to take a stand. That means we must stand up!"" Schalke's bitter rivals Borussia Dortmund, who invited 220 refugees to a Europa League game, responded by saying ""separated by colours, united by this"". Other Bundesliga clubs have also got involved including Werder Bremen founded a ""Stay on the Ball"" project to help refugees in the region, while both Hannover and Hoffenheim have delivered kits and shoes to help."
173,03/09/2015,17:50,Bundesliga clubs reach out to Germany's refugees,German Bundesliga club Bayern Munich on Thursday announced it will donate one million euros (US$1.1m) to projects supporting some of the refugees pouring into Germany amidst the ongoing Europe-wide crisis.,"The club is working with Munich authorities to set up 'training camps' for children to receive German lessons, meals and football kits. The city of Munich has been particularly affected by the refugee crisis after local police reported that more than 100 migrants arrived in an hour on Wednesday in the Bavarian capital. For their next home match against Augsburg on September 12, Bayern players will walk out hand-in-hand with both a German and a refugee child as a mark of support for the integration of refugees. ""We at FC Bayern consider it our socio-political responsibility to help displaced and needy children, women and men, by supporting and assisting them in Germany,"" Bayern's chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge wrote on the club's website. So far this year, German police have recorded over 125,000 illegal entries, more than double last year's total of about 57,000, with many coming from war-torn Syria as well as from Eritrea, Afghanistan, Kosovo and Serbia. The influx has sparked a wave of attacks on asylum-seekers and violent protests against foreigners. Chancellor Angela Merkel has said Germany will have ""no tolerance"" for ""shameful and vile"" violence against refugees. Germany's World Cup-winning footballers have condemned xenophobic attacks and led calls to help the refugees.

174,02/09/2015,16:54,"Schalke bosses lament, defend Draxler's sale","Schalke coach Andre Breitenreiter has bitterly lamented the sale of Germany international Julian Draxler to rivals Wolfsburg, while sports director Horst Heldt has defended the club's record transfer.","The Royal Blues sold their star midfielder to Wolfsburg on Monday for a reported 35 million euros ($39.3m), plus five million in bonuses, as the 21-year-old left the club he joined in 2001 as a child. He played 170 matches for Schalke and scored 30 goals. ""Jule arrived with us for nothing, we educated him and now we've sold him for 40 million,"" Heldt told SID, an AFP subsidiary. ""We have secured the most expensive transfer in the club's history."" But Heldt admits that while Schalke are now flushed with cash, they will be poorer on the pitch. ""There is a loss of quality, as we know,"" Heldt added. The Draxler transfer will help reduce Schalke's debt of 163.9 million euros up until the end of 2014. Wolfsburg bought Draxler to replace Belgian attacking midfielder Kevin de Bruyne, who left for Manchester City, but Breitenreiter regrets selling their best player -- who played against Wolfsburg in Schalke's 3-0 away defeat last Friday. ""In Julian, we have lost our best player, the quality in the squad has dropped,"" fumed Breitenreiter. ""Until last weekend, I thought he was staying. ""If I had known on Thursday that he's going, he wouldn't have played against Wolfsburg on Friday. ""The club and the fans need to ask themselves why Julian left. ""We still have a number of talented players, but we have to be careful."" Breitenreiter, who took charge at the start of the season, also rued the club's decision to drive advertising lorries through Gelsenkirchen and neighbouring Dortmund when Draxler signed a five-year extension in 2013. Alongside the caption ""Julian Draxler: With pride and passion until 2018"" was a giant image of the player in a Schalke strip. ""The club itself raised the hype around him and built him up,"" added Breitenreiter. ""I wouldn't have allowed the lorries to drive around back then."""
175,01/09/2015,15:59,"Wolfsburg's Draxler will ""carry Schalke in heart""","Germany international Julian Draxler admitted he will ""always carry Schalke 04"" in his heart, despite being unveiled as Wolfsburg's replacement for Kevin de Bruyne on Tuesday, alongside Brazil defender Dante.","Having sold De Bruyne to Manchester City on Sunday for a reported record fee of £54 million ($83.6m, 74m euros), Wolfsburg wasted no time by signing centre-back Dante from Bayern Munich and Draxler from Schalke on Monday. Draxler, 21, who like De Bruyne is an attacking midfielder, cost Wolfsburg a reported 35 million euros, while they paid around four million euros for the 31-year-old Dante. After 14 years with Gelsenkirchen's Schalke, Draxler said he needed a change, but admitted it was hard to get used to the green of Wolfsburg after the Royal Blue of Schalke. ""I'll always wear Schalke in my heart,"" he told a press conference on Tuesday. ""The situation is still very unusual. When I walk through the dressing room, everything here is green and not blue, but I needed a change of air."" Schalke fans reacted angrily to his departure. ""Julian is a Schalke boy and should have stayed so! That's why it is all the sadder that he's left,"" fumed one typically disgruntled Schalke fan in German daily Bild. Draxler has not been called into the Germany squad for Friday's key Euro 2016 qualifier against Poland in Frankfurt with Joachim Loew's side second in Group D behind the visitors. After two stagnant years in Schalke, Draxler will make the step up to become the world-class attacking midfielder Wolfsburg need to fulfill their European ambitions as they prepare for their first Champions League campaign since 2009. But Wolfsburg coach Dieter Hecking warned reporters not to compare Draxler to De Bruyne. ""Don't make the mistake of comparing De Bruyne to Draxler, he is a very different type of player,"" said Hecking in an attempt to take some of the expectations off their new signing. Germany coach Joachim Loew backed Draxler's move to Wolfsburg. ""My expectation is that he will play to his class and skills and will be more consisent,"" said the Germany boss. Having won three back-to-back Bundesliga titles and been part of Bayern's treble-winning team in 2013, Brazil's Dante arrives in Wolfsburg with a string of experience and eager to link up with fellow Selecao internationals Luiz Gustavo and Naldo. He admits he was ""sad"" to leave Bayern, but Hecking said he hopes Dante's experience will rub off on his new team-mates. ""We're hoping we can annoy Bayern again with Dante in our team,"" said Hecking, while director of sport Klaus Allofs added: ""He has not only the quality, but also the mentality that you need to succeed."""
176,28/08/2015,22:35,Wolfsburg cruise past Schalke minus City-target De Bruyne,VfL Wolfsburg enjoyed a 3-0 win over Schalke on Friday to top the Bundesliga as they draw close to agreeing a transfer with Manchester City over Kevin de Bruyne.,"The 24-year-old was left out of Friday's squad with Wolfsburg poised to agree to a reported Bundesliga record fee of 74 million euros ($83.64m, £54m) before Germany's transfer window closes at 1800 (1600 GMT) on Monday. In De Bruyne's absence, Dutch striker Bas Dost gave Wolfsburg an early lead by drilling home a 17th-minute cross before Swiss left-back Ricardo Rodriguez converted a penalty just before the hour mark. Centre half Timm Klose then netted Wolfsburg's third goal with 61 minutes gone as his side bounced back with a convincing win compared to last weekend's uninspired 1-1 draw at Cologne. Wolves' director of sport Klaus Allofs expects the on-going De Bruyne transfer saga to be resolved over the weekend. ""It's all about a few small details. It could be that we reach an agreement today or tomorrow,"" Allofs told Sky before kick-off. The De Bruyne deal is set to smash the Bundesliga transfer record after Liverpool paid Hoffenheim 41 million euros for Brazil striker Roberto Firmino in July. Reports suggest Wolfsburg could pocket up to 80 million euros, with an extra six million euros in bonuses, for De Bruyne if the attacking midfielder helps City win this season's Premier League title. Schalke's Germany midfielder Julian Draxler, who played the first 73 minutes on Friday, could be his possible replacement at Wolfsburg, but Allofs added: ""I could give you ten to 15 possible names"". Croatia midfielder Ivan Perisic, who was also left out of the Wolfsburg squad, is poised to join Inter Milan for 20 million euros before the transfer window closes. Both De Bruyne and Perisic were in the stadium to watch their team win to top the table by a point from Borussia Dortmund and third-placed defending champions Bayern Munich. ""We need players who identify themselves 100 percent with the club,"" explained Allofs when asked why the pair were left out."

Now Bayern have confirmed another loan spell at the Gelsenkirchen-based outfit. ""I'm looking forward to this new challenge until the end of the season,"" Hojbjerg told the Bayern website. ""I want to gain match practice and prove myself for FC Bayern. That's what I want to achieve in Schalke."" Schalke are at Wolfsburg on Friday, while Bayern host Bayer Leverkusen on Saturday with both sides going into the Allianz Arena showdown in the top three. ""This is a very good solution for all three parties,"" said Bayern's director of sport Matthias Sammer. ""We continue to count on Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg and we're certain his future lies in Munich, but to develop further, he needs match practice which he will get at Schalke. ""We at FC Bayern have positive experiences with loan spells of this kind in the case of Philipp Lahm, Toni Kroos and David Alaba."""
178,23/08/2015,18:13,Dortmund floor Ingolstadt to top Bundesliga,Borussia Dortmund's dream start to the season continued Sunday as their 4-0 win at new-boys Ingolstadt saw them leapfrog Bayern Munich to top the Bundesliga table on goal difference.,"Dortmund claimed their sixth win in all competitions under new coach Thomas Tuchel as defender Matthias Ginter, Marco Reus, Shinji Kagawa and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang scored second-half goals. ""I knew we'd go top of the table after we went 3-0 up, but what especially pleased me was the performance,"" said Tuchel. ""I'm proud that the team kept the performance up for 90 minutes and never waned. ""I'd hoped in the half-time break that they would be rewarded for playing well."" Dogged Ingolstadt defending meant Dortmund only went ahead when right-back Ginter fired home Henrikh Mkhitaryan's final pass on 55 minutes. Germany winger Reus doubled the lead by converting a penalty on the hour after left-back Marcel Schmelzer was fouled. Kagawa added the third with a superb shot off his left foot after beating two defenders on 84 minutes before Aubameyang claimed his sixth goal in six games in stoppage time. Later Borussia Moenchengladbach, who will discover their Champions League group stage opponents on Thursday, dropped to bottom of the table on goal difference after losing 2-1 to Mainz. Leaky defence let them down again having lost 4-0 to Dortmund last Saturday. Gladbach cancelled out Jairo Samperio's first-half goal when Germany winger Patrick Herrmann equalised just after the break only for right-winger Christian Clemens to score Mainz's 79th-minute winner to leave Gladbach without a point. On Saturday, Bayern needed a 90th-minute Robert Lewandowski goal to earn a dramatic 2-1 win at Hoffenheim after conceding the joint fastest goal in German league history and had Jerome Boateng sent off. The Poland striker sealed the champions' comeback after Hoffenheim's Germany Under-21 striker Kevin Volland had opened the scoring with just nine seconds gone at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena. Bayern equalised when Thomas Mueller jabbed home a rebound shot on 40 minutes as Hoffenheim wasted the chance for an historic first win over Bayern at the 15th attempt when Eugen Polanski blasted his penalty attempt off the post after Boateng was sent off for a handball on 72 minutes. Bayern claimed the dramatic winner when Brazil winger Costa fired in a superb cross and Lewandowski drilled home his shot. Bayer Leverkusen are third after a 1-0 win at Hanover saw them join Bayern and Dortmund as the league's only teams with two wins. Dead-ball specialist Hakan Calhanoglu's 18th-minute free-kick sealed the win to give Leverkusen a boost before Wednesday's Champions League play-off qualifier, second-leg, at home to Lazio, who they trail 1-0 after the first leg. Belgian attacking midfielder Kevin de Bruyne started what could be his last match for last season's runners-up VfL Wolfsburg in a 1-1 draw with Cologne. The 24-year-old, despite having said earlier in the week he would be staying with Wolfsburg for this season, is reported to have agreed terms with Manchester City and will earn £200,000 (275,632 euros, $313,890) a week in the Premier League, if his present club accept City's improved offer of £55 million. Hosts Cologne took the lead when striker Simon Zoller lobbed goalkeeper Koen Casteels on the half hour mark, but sixth-placed Wolfsburg equalised when ex-Arsenal and Juventus striker Nicklas Bendtner tapped home a Daniel Caliguri cross at the far post on 83 minutes. Schalke, who routed Bremen 3-0 on the opening weekend of the season, are fourth after their 1-1 draw at newly-promoted Darmstadt. Konstantin Rausch's 18th-minute goal was cancelled out by Schalke's Germany international Julian Draxler, who has been linked to a move to Italian champions Juventus, on 47 minutes. Hamburg moved up to ninth with a 3-2 win at home to ten-man VfB Stuttgart as their ex-Arsenal defender Johan Djourou scored the 89th-minute winner after Stuttgart right-back Florian Klein was sent off for a second booking in as many minutes. Hertha Berlin had briefly led the table on Friday night after their 1-1 draw at home to Werder Bremen when Valentin Stocker's goal was cancelled out by Anthony Ujah's equaliser."

A few hours earlier, Portuguese media reported that the deal had hit a stumbling block because Boateng had failed a medical. The 28-year-old, who was born in Germany and has spent the last two seasons at Schalke 04, had appeared set to sign a two-year contract at the Estadio Jose Alvalade, according to local press reports. The former Hertha Berlin, Borussia Dortmund, Portsmouth and AC Milan forward was suspended indefinitely by Schalke in May after the Gelsenkirchen club's Bundesliga defeat to Cologne."

The Royal Blues kicked Boateng out of the squad last May after a shock defeat at Cologne. Schalke finished sixth in the Bundesliga and missed out on a Champions League berth for the first time since the 2010/11 season. Boateng was allowed to talk to other clubs to negotiate a transfer and had already been linked to former club AC Milan. He played for Borussia Dortmund and Portsmouth in England before moving to Italy where he played 101 matches for AC Milan and 60 with Schalke after his return to the Bundesliga.

""We are very happy to have found the right head coach for FC Schalke 04 in the form of Andre Breitenreiter,"" Schalke sporting director Horst Heldt told the club's website. ""After Roberto Di Matteo's departure, I emphasised what I expect from a new coach: Attractive and passionate attacking football and a team spirit that enthuses our own fans."" The 41-year-old, who played for the likes of Hannover, Hamburg and Wolfsburg in the 1990s, arrives from Paderborn, the unfashionable club who he led to promotion to the top flight a year ago but could not keep in the Bundesliga in the season just finished. Di Matteo had only been appointed last October but failed to achieve his primary objective of securing Champions League qualification for the Gelsenkirchen club.

He opted for surgery on the patella problem against the advice of both the team doctor and Munich-based expert Hans-Wilhelm Mueller-Wohlfahrt, who treats the German team. ""Atsuto Uchida has flown to Japan and has undergone an operation due to ongoing patella tendon problems. Our doctors' advice was different,"" Schalke's director of sport Horst Heldt told schalke04.de tersely. ""We were convinced that it made more sense to take on a conservative approach to treating the injury. ""That was an opinion also shared by Germany national team doctor Dr. Mueller-Wohlfahrt, who Uchida visited a number of times. ""However, the player made a different decision. He has the right to choose whichever doctor he wishes."" With the new season set to start in Germany on August 14, Uchida is set to miss the start of pre-season training next month. ""We will see how the first six weeks of Uchida's rehab in Japan go and expect him to return to Germany after that,"" said Horst. Schalke are without a coach after Roberto di Matteo resigned last month and Uchida will have a new boss on his return to the Gelsenkirchen-based club.

Schalke are without a coach after Roberto di Matteo stepped down after less than a year in charge as his side finished sixth in the German league and failed to qualify for the Champions League. ""Due to the time lag in our planning after qualifying directly for the Europa League, we are no longer convinced of a successful and smooth trip to China,"" said Schalke's marketing director Alexander Jobst. ""Cancellations of proposed friendlies, no guarantee of nationwide broadcast from the Chinese state television, as well as a lack of trust in the agency responsible for organising this trip, have led to the decision to postpone. ""A trip like this has to be prepared extensively and needs to guarantee a convincing success in this new market for the club. ""Unfortunately, this does not appear to be realistic.""

Having won the last of their six German league titles in 1983, Hamburg are a club in turmoil with Bruno Labbadia the latest of four coaches to have taken charge this season. ""The pressure situation is already obvious within the team, so it's important to try and stay relaxed,"" said Labbadia amidst a sea of anxious faces in the Hanseatic city. A clock at the stadium records how long Hamburg have been in the Bundesliga since 1963 -- and it could be stopped for the first time on Saturday afternoon. The consequences of dropping to the second division for the first time could be dire -- both for the club and the city. The club supports around 750 jobs, many of which would come under threat, and the club's budget would nearly halve from 120 million euros to 75 million if they go down. ""We have to win our game,"" said Labbadia, ""and I believe we're capable of doing that to give ourselves a chance of escaping the relegation places."" Hamburg have been in this situation before. Last season they stayed up only by virtue of a single away goal having drawn both legs of a relegation play-off against Greuther Fuerth. One of the tightest relegation battles in Bundesliga history will unfold on Saturday with the bottom six teams all fighting to stay up. The bottom two sides, currently Paderborn and Hamburg, will be relegated automatically while the 16th-placed team faces a play-off against the third-best team in the second division. Bottom side Paderborn can finish no higher than 16th, the ranking of their visitors Stuttgart, another former German giant on the brink of relegation. Hanover are at home to Freiburg, who enjoyed a shock 2-1 win over Bayern last Saturday, with both sides locked on 34 points, just one above the relegation places. Hertha Berlin could drop from 13th into the relegation mire and 16th place with a defeat at Hoffenheim which would threaten their third relegation in five years.

Boateng, 28, remains under contract with Schalke, but is allowed to talk to other clubs to negotiate a transfer and has already been linked to former club AC Milan. Schalke has told both Sam and Berlin-born Kevin-Prince, who played for the Black Stars at the 2014 World Cup, that they have no future with the club, but Bayern Munich defender Jerome Boateng says his half-brother has been treated unfairly. ""They were clearly looking for a scapegoat,"" the Bayern defender told German magazine Sport Bild. ""My brother hadn't played for weeks in the starting side. ""Just because he started one game in the team, which has been playing without success for weeks, he is supposed to have suddenly pulled the whole team down?"" ""He doesn't have an explanation for the sudden turn of events, he is naturally very disappointed with those responsible at Schalke, which I can completely understand. ""Why wasn't the whole team criticised for the defeat? ""Instead, they threw two players out, one of whom also spent five weeks on the bench with Kevin, and had still done all they could.""

They are in danger of missing out on a Europa League berth next season having reached the last 16 of the Champions League this year. With neighbours Dortmund hard on their heels in the league table, Schalke face relegation-threatened Paderborn and Hamburg, who are both desperate for points to stay in Germany's top flight, in their final two games. Should Schalke finish outside the top six, questions will no doubt be asked as to whether ex-Chelsea boss Di Matteo and director of sport Horst Heldt are the right men for their jobs. After two seasons with Schalke, Boateng, the club's top earner, has struggled for form and was substituted just after half-time against Cologne, while Sam was not in the match-day squad having joined from Leverkusen at the start of the season. Heldt has confirmed both Boateng and Sam have no future with the club. ""It's not the case that he had a positive aura through his body language,"" Heldt said of Sam. ""He only worries about himself and he doesn't give off positive energy, we don't need that for the next 14 days. ""Sidney played very, very well at Leverkusen, but it just hasn't worked out here."" Hoeger is suspended from training ""because of doubts about his loyalty to the club"" until Saturday when he will have the chance to redeem himself in the final week of the season. More players could find themselves with a terminated contract unless results improve, according to Heldt. ""That was the first step,"" he said. ""We will monitor closely the reaction of the others this week. ""I assume they have realised that we're getting down to business and that others may also be affected."""

Wolves picked up their first win in four league games when Swiss defender Timm Klose headed home on 16 minutes before Dost netted nine minutes later by meeting Ivan Perisic's cross at the near post. The 25-year-old showed his predatory skills by pouncing on a parried save eight minutes from time to slot home his second. Paderborn pulled a goal back when midfielder Lukas Rupp hit the top right-hand corner with a speculative shot on the edge of the area just before the whistle. The defeat keeps Paderborn 17th, but with all still to play for as just two points separate the bottom five teams of Hamburg, Freiburg, Hanover 96, Paderborn and bottom side VfB Stuttgart with two games left. Schalke dropped to sixth after their 2-0 defeat at Cologne means Robert di Matteo's side has won just one of their last eight league games and in danger of dropping out of the European places for next season. Schalke are just two points ahead of neighbours Dortmund, who are making a late bid for a Europa League spot after starting February last in the table. Goals by midfielders Marcel Risse and Yannick Gerdhardt confirmed Cologne's survival in the top flight. On Saturday, ten-man Bayern Munich suffered a morale-sapping fourth straight defeat by losing 1-0 to Augsburg ahead of Tuesday's Champions League semi-final, return leg against Barcelona. Augsburg's Paraguay striker Raul Bobadilla followed on from Barcelona's Lionel Messi by inflicting more misery on the Bundesliga champions. Bayern host Barca facing an uphill task having been routed 3-0 in Spain, when Messi scored twice, which followed defeats to Borussia Dortmund in the German Cup semi-final and a league defeat at Bayer Leverkusen. Bayern played nearly 80 minutes with ten men after reserve goalkeeper Pepe Reina was shown a straight red card with just 13 minutes gone. Dutch defender Paul Verhaegh hit the post with the resulting spot-kick. But Augsburg grabbed the winner when Danish midfielder Pierre-Emile Hoejbjerg, on loan from Bayern, put in a cross which Bobadilla deftly back-heeled on 71 minutes.

Germany striker Max Kruse, who will play for Wolfsburg next season, Patrick Herrmann and Guinea forward Ibrahima Traore scored Gladbach's goals. Borussia Dortmund enjoyed a 2-0 win at home to Hertha Berlin as goals by defenders Neven Subotic and Erik Durm lifted Dortmund to seventh. Hanover remain third from bottom after their 1-1 draw at home to Werder Bremen while Stuttgart stayed at the foot of the table despite their 2-0 win over Mainz.

195,19/04/2015,19:48,Wolves' stumble to Schalke puts Bayern on verge,Bayern Munich could wrap up a third straight Bundesliga title next weekend after second-placed Wolfsburg needed a late Kevin de Bruyne equaliser to seal Sunday's 1-1 draw against Schalke.,"Pep Guardiola's Bayern finished the weekend 12 points clear after their 2-0 win at Hoffenheim and with five games left they could have their title confirmed with a home win over Hertha Berlin on Saturday if other results go their way. At Wolfsburg's Volkswagen Arena, defender Ricardo Rodriguez hit the cross-bar early in the second-half from a free-kick in the hosts' best clear chance. But Schalke took a spectacular lead against the run of play as Germany under-19 left winger Leroy Sane won the ball on the edge of his own area, then sprinted away before beating two Wolves defenders to fire home on 53 minutes. Having also earlier gone close with a free-kick, Belgium international De Bruyne rescued the hosts when he hit the bottom right-hand corner from 20 metres out to claim his 10th Bundesliga goal of the season on 78 minutes. Wolfsburg could have snatched the three points at the death as France midfielder Joshua Guilavogui blasted a late volley over the bar. Earlier, bottom side Hamburg suffered their fifth straight defeat and are heading towards an historic relegation from Germany's top flight after their 1-0 defeat to Werder Bremen in the north German derby. Bremen's Argentine striker Franco di Santo claimed his 13th goal of the season by netting an 84th-minute penalty just after Hamburg's Swiss midfielder Valon Behrami was sent off -- on his 30th birthday -- for pulling down Werder's Zlatko Junuzovic. Bremen are one of the league's success stories this season having gone from last place in December to finish the weekend four points adrift of a Europa League spot. In contrast, hapless Hamburg have just five games to close the four-point gap to safety as Bruno Labbadia suffered defeat in his first game since being appointed as Hamburg's fourth coach this season on Wednesday. ""To lose a game with a penalty like that is bitterly disappointing,"" said Labbadia, who is in his second stint as Hamburg boss. ""For me that was never, ever a red card."" The only side to have never been relegated from Germany's top flight, Hamburg only avoided the drop last season by winning a play-off. Meanwhile, leaders Bayern sealed a hard-fought win at Hoffenheim, but have fresh injury worries for Tuesday's crucial Champions League quarter-final, second-leg against Porto as they look to over-turn a 3-1 deficit. Left-back Juan Bernat had to be helped off after a bone-crunching first-half tackle in Hoffenheim, but coach Pep Guardiola said the Spaniard was only taken off as a precaution. ""We didn't want to take any risks,"" he added. Borussia Dortmund enjoyed a 3-0 victory at home to Paderborn to climb to ninth in their first game since coach Jurgen Klopp announced he would be leaving at the end of the season to be replaced by ex-Mainz boss Thomas Tuchel next season. After Borussia Moenchengladbach's goalless draw at Eintracht Frankfurt on Friday, Bayer Leverkusen took Gladbach's place in third, and amongst the automatic Champions League berths, with a 4-0 mauling of Hanover 96."

""He is incredibly well-regarded in the national team and we have talked several times. ""Now it's the task of (Schalke team manager) Horst Heldt and his advisers to find an acceptable solution."" Khedira is one of Real Madrid's top earners and his contract expires at the end of the season. He confirmed last month that he will leave the Spanish giants at the end of the current campaign, but has not revealed his plans. Toennies also poured doubt on UK media reports that Germany defender and Schalke captain Hoewedes is set to leave for Spurs next season. ""I am very close to Benedikt Hoewedes and if there was anything in it, then I would be the first to know about it,"" said Toennies. ""I won't assume that anything has been agreed."" Having spent his entire career at Schalke, the 27-year-old Hoewedes has a release clause in his contract, which expires in June 2017, and has also been linked to Spurs' North London rivals Arsenal."

Schalke have reached the Champions League's knock-out stages for the last four years, having been semi-finalists in 2011 when they lost to Manchester United. Di Matteo's side stunned current title holders Real Madrid with a 4-3 victory in Spain last month, but bowed out of this season's last 16 with a 5-4 defeat on aggregate. But Di Matteo, who steered Chelsea to the 2012 Champions League title during only eight months in charge at Stamford Bridge, says Schalke's chances of a fifth consecutive season in European football's top domestic tournament have gone. ""If you're being realistic, then you have to say that it's almost impossible with the games we have left,"" said Di Matteo, who took charge of Schalke last October. ""Now we have to look forward and try to play in international competition (the Europa League) next season."" Schalke are at second-placed Wolfsburg next Saturday, then face Mainz, VfB Stuttgart, Cologne, Paderborn and Hamburg in their final games before the season ends on May 23."
198,11/04/2015,17:41,Lewandowski double helps Bayern brush off injury woes,Robert Lewandowski scored twice as injury-hit Bayern Munich romped to a 3-0 league win over Eintracht Frankfurt on Saturday to warm-up for their Champions League quarter-final at Porto.,"With second-placed Wolfsburg at Hamburg on Saturday night, league leaders Bayern took the chance to go thirteen points clear. Lewandowski, the Bundesliga's top scorer last season, added to his tally to leave him with 16 goals for the season and third in the current rankings. Frankfurt were missing the league's top scorer with Alexander Meier, who has 19 goals in 26 matches, out with a knee injury. Coach Pep Guardiola has described Bayern's injury situation ahead of Wednesday's first-leg at FC Porto as 'very critical' with only 14 players fit to face Frankfurt. ""I've never known anything like it in my career,"" rued the Spaniard before the win. Centre-back Medhi Benatia, who has a groin injury, joined flu-victim Bastian Schweinsteiger, plus wingers Franck Ribery, Arjen Robben and left-back David Alaba as just some of the stars on Bayern's casualty list. Guardiola made Bundesliga history by naming four Spain internationals in his starting line-up in Pepe Reina, Xabi Alonso, Thiago Alcantara and Juan Bernat. Despite their woes, Bayern needed just 15 minutes to take the lead at Munich's Allianz Arena when Lewandowski produced a world-class turn and volley. The Poland star made sure of the three points when he headed home, with suspicion of offside, on 66 minutes. Mueller added the third eight minutes from time when he fired home a seemingly-impossible angle. Third-placed Borussia Moenchengladbach picked up their fourth straight league win with an impressive 3-1 victory over Borussia Dortmund. Tenth-placed Dortmund went behind after just 29 seconds as Patrick Herrmann's shot was blocked by Borussia's Roman Weidenfeller, but Sweden left-back Oscar Wendt slammed home the parry. Brazilian forward Raffel addded their second on 32 minutes after a strong run by Herrmann before Norway's Havard Nordveit fired home when left unmarked at the far post with 67 minutes gone before Ilkay Gundogan pulled a late goal back for Dortmund. Bayer Leverkusen enjoyed a 3-2 win over Mainz as they consider terminating the contract of Bosnia international Emir Spahic, who is being investigated by police for allegedly assaulting a club steward. South Korea striker Son Heung-Min opened the scoring with 15 minutes gone and Stefan Kiessling added a second early in the second-half. Dead-ball specialist Hakan Calhanoglu added their third when he drilled homehis 73rd-minute free-kick, but Mainz pulled a goal back when South Korea international Koo Ja-Cheol converted two late penalties. The win leaves Leverkusen fourth in the battle for one of the Bundesliga's three automatic Champions League places for next season. Fifth-placed Schalke are now 10 points adrift of a Champions League place for next season after their goalless draw with relegation-threatened Freiburg. Augsburg stay sixth in the league despite their shock 2-1 defeat at Paderborn, who picked up their first win since February to climb up to 16th. It left Hamburg second-from-bottom as they bid to avoid a first relegation from Germany's top tier."
199,05/04/2015,17:39,"Schalke, Augsburg suffer Champions League setback",Schalke 04 and Augsburg's hopes of reaching next season's Champions League suffered a setback on Sunday after their goalless Bundesliga draw in Bavaria.,"Roberto di Matteo's Schalke remain fifth in the German league, eight points behind fourth-placed Leverkusen, with the top four in Germany's top flight qualifying for next season's Champions League and only seven games left. Sixth-placed Augsburg are a point behind Schalke and are also destined to play in the Europa League next season alongside Di Matteo's Royal Blues if they keep their current place. Both sides had their chances at Augsburg's SGL Arena with Schalke's Dutch striker Klaas-Jan Huntelaar squandering four chances, while Augsburg's Argentine striker Raul Bobadilla had four of his sides 20 shots on Schalke's goal. On Saturday, Robert Lewandowski scored against his ex-club Borussia Dortmund to seal league leaders' Bayern Munich's 1-0 win which keeps them on course for a third Bundesliga title. Lewandowski's 35th-minute header clinched Bayern's win which left them ten points clear at the top of the table. Their victory underlines Bayern's domination in Germany and came without injured stars David Alaba, Arjen Robben and Franck Ribery, while Germany captain Bastian Schweinsteiger limped off with an ankle injury and is doubtful for Wednesday's German Cup quarter-final at Bayer Leverkusen. Dortmund's best chance was when Marco Reus' second-half free-kick was superbly saved by Manuel Neuer as Borussia suffered their first league defeat since the start of February. Earlier, Borussia Moenchengladbach and Bayer Leverkusen posted big wins as the battle for third-place, and an automatic Champions League spot, intensifies. Third-placed Gladbach enjoyed an impressive 4-1 comeback win at Hoffenheim which keeps them two-points clear of Leverkusen, who posted a 4-0 win at home to over hapless Hamburg. Hosts Hoffenheim took the lead at home to Gladbach when forward Sven Schipplock enjoyed a simple tap-in on 17 minutes, but Gladbach proved their mettle with three goals in ten first-half minutes as winger Patrick Herrmann scored twice. Fourth-placed Leverkusen also underlined their Champions League pedigree by putting Hamburg to the sword and are currently on course for a play-off place. With the team third from bottom and on course for a first relegation from Germany's top flight, Hamburg sacked Joe Zinnbauer ten days ago, but his successor Peter Knaebel could only watch as his team was thrashed as Gonzalo Castro and Stefan Kiessling both scored twice for Leverkusen. Second-placed Wolfsburg remain seven points clear of Gladbach with a 3-1 win at home to bottom VfB Stuttgart. Swiss midfielder Ricardo Rodriguez converted a penalty and a free-kick either side of half-time before ex-Chelsea winger Andre Schuerrle came off the bench to add their third. Freiburg find themselves three-points clear of the relegation zone after their 1-0 win at home to Cologne while Hanover dropped to just above the bottom three with a 2-2 draw at Eintracht Frankfurt. Hanover's Ivory Coast striker Didier Ya Konan rescued his team with a late equaliser, his first for the north German club since his six month sojourn at Saudi Arabian side Al Ittihad Jeddah."
200,21/03/2015,21:11,Bellarabi fires Leverkusen into top three,Germany winger Karim Bellarabi fired Bayer Leverkusen into the Bundesliga's top three on Saturday with a 1-0 win at Schalke 04.,"Having bowed out of the Champions League on Tuesday suffering the heartbreak of a penalty shoot-out defeat to Atletico Madrid in the last 16, Leverkusen leap-frogged Borussia Moenchengladbach to go third in Germany's top flight. Bayer's Germany winger Bellarabi, who has been linked to Arsenal, grabbed the 35th-minute winner from the tightest of angles with a superb shot across goal. ""Now we are up where we want to still be at the end of the season,"" said Bellarabi who has been named in Germany's squad for Wednesday's friendly with Australia and next Sunday's Euro 2016 qualifier against Georgia. Having won the last 16, first leg clash against Atletico 1-0 in Leverkusen, Bayer lost 1-0 in Madrid before suffering the disappointment of losing 3-2 on spot-kicks after ex-Germany striker Stefan Kiessling blasted over his crucial penalty. ""We played a very good game and deserved the win,"" said Leverkusen coach Roger Schmidt after his side beat Schalke. ""The fact that the team was able to play with so much concentration after Tuesday's match is fantastic."" But Schalke coach Roberto di Matteo was bitterly disappointed as his side are now five points from a possible Champions League place in fifth. ""There were too many mistakes in our build up play,"" said ex-Chelsea coach Di Matteo, who took charge in October and whose Royal Blues bowed out of the Champions League in the last 16 despite beating holders Real Madrid away. ""We didn't control the game and didn't create enough chances, too often we didn't make the right decision."" After the international break, Leverkusen play strugglers Hamburg in a fortnight before their crucial German Cup quarter-final at home to holders Bayern Munich on April 4."
201,20/03/2015,02:30,"Bayern to welcome back Robben, Ribery for Gladbach",Bayern Munich hope to welcome back wingers Arjen Robben and Franck Ribery for Sunday's clash at home to Borussia Moenchengladbach as they look to edge closer to the Bundesliga title.,"Pep Guardiola's Bayern start the weekend 11 points clear and could still break last season's record when they claimed the title with seven games to spare. The Allianz Arena clash sees the runaway leaders host third-placed Gladbach, but Lucien Favre's Borussia are already a staggering 20 points adrift of Guardiola's Bavarians. With 17 league goals in 20 games this season, Robben is battling Frankfurt's Alex Meier to become the Bundesliga's top scorer but the flying Dutchman is battling to overcome a trapped nerve that saw him miss last Saturday's 4-0 rout of Werder Bremen. Robben took part in training this week, as did left winger Franck Ribery, who also sat out the Bremen victory with an ankle injury. However, with Poland striker Robert Lewandowski pillaging six goals in his last five league games and on 13 for the season, the champions would still have plenty of firepower without the pair. Bayern will be without suspended centre-back Medhi Benatia, whose yellow card at Bremen was his fifth of the season, carrying with it an automatic suspension. Bayern captain Philipp Lahm is set for another place on the bench having made his return from injury at Bremen. Gladbach face an uphill task to take points off their hosts with Bayern unbeaten at home this season after 11 wins and a draw. Fresh from their midweek Champions League exit, tenth-placed Borussia Dortmund are hunting their first win in four games when they travel to Hanover 96, who are 13th. Germany defender Marcel Schmelzer is an injury doubt having picked up a knock in their 3-0 last 16 defeat to Juventus, which sealed a 5-1 aggregate defeat, but defensive midfielder Nuri Sahin is definitely out with a leg injury. ""Our main priority is the league now, although that doesn't mean that we don't want to progress in the German Cup,"" said Borussia coach Jurgen Klopp. His side have improved in the league since the turn of the year having started February bottom of the table following a dire set of results. Hanover coach Tayfun Korkut is under pressure as his side have won just one of their last 10 games. Fifth-placed Schalke have a chance to improve their Champions League chances for next season when they host fourth-placed Bayer Leverkusen on Saturday night with just three points separating the teams. ""I think you can describe this game as a 'six-pointer',"" said Schalke coach Roberto di Matteo. ""We're playing at home and are confident of getting a good result."" The 44-year-old is set to keep teenage goalkeeper Timon Wellenreuther between the posts with first-choice stopper Ralf Faehrmann working his way back from injury after picking up a cruciate knee ligament strain in January. Both teams exited the Champions League at the last 16 stage with Schalke going out 5-4 to Real Madrid on aggregate despite a stunning 4-3 win in Spain just over ten days ago. Bayer are still licking their wounds after bowing out on a penalty shoot-out at Atletico Madrid on Tuesday despite winning the first leg in Leverkusen.

202,11/03/2015,02:00,Madrid implosion 'incomprehensible' for Ancelotti,Real Madrid boss Carlo Ancelotti admitted he is at a loss to explain the European champions dramatic slump in form as they sneaked into the quarter-finals of the Champions League despite losing 4-3 to Schalke on Tuesday.,"A 2-0 first leg advantage was just enough to carry Los Blancos into the last eight for a fifth consecutive season on a night when Cristiano Ronaldo's achievement in becoming the all-time leading scorer in European competitions was overshadowed. Ronaldo twice equalised in the first-half to surpass Real legend Raul with 78 goals in European competitions after Christian Fuchs and Klass-Jan Huntelaar had given Schalke the lead. Karim Benzema then put Madrid in front on the night before Leroy Sane and a stunning strike from Huntelaar gave Schalke a deserved victory. Ancelotti's men swept all before them in a 22-game winning run to end 2014 with a club record four-trophy haul for the calendar year after winning the Club World Cup. However, since the turn of the year they have lost five times in 15 games to surrender their La Liga lead to Barcelona and were on the verge of suffering one of the biggest shocks in Champions League history. ""We are playing very badly. It is quite incomprehensible after what we did until December,"" said Ancelotti. ""It is clear I feel very sorry because everyone has seen we played very badly. This is not good for the image of the club. ""It is normal that the players lack confidence. I think we have dipped a bit physically too. We had problems in every aspect of the game: offensive, defensive, desire, fight and concentration."" Ancelotti was even asked whether he fears the sack in the coming days with a crucial El Clasico clash against Barcelona in the La Liga title race to come on March 22. The Italian insisted he still has faith in the players that carried the club to their 10th European Cup win just 10 months ago. ""I don't think about this (being sacked). I continue doing my job, but I need to do it better. This is the responsiblity of the coach to put out a team that can play better than they did tonight. ""I continue having total confidence in this squad because I know what they can do. We are not doing it at the moment and we need to work harder, train harder, do everything better."" Madrid captain Iker Casillas said the Spanish giants had hit ""rock bottom"" after a three-game winless streak. ""It is clear we have hit rock bottom in a spectacular way, but the positive thing is that a week on Friday we will be in the draw and we can forget the past 10 days,"" said the Spanish captain Ancelotti insisted that things can turn around for the better just as quickly as they have deteriorated, especially with key players such as Sergio Ramos and Luka Modric returning from injury. Modric made his return after four months out for the final half an hour, while Ramos is expected to make an appearance when Levante visit the Bernabeu on Sunday. ""Things change quickly in football as we have seen. No one in December would imagine what we are going through now,"" said Ancelotti. ""The presence of Modric gives us more control and more possession in midfield. ""We can't ask too much of him because he was out for four months. I think he did well for 30 minutes. ""He is going to help us in the next games, as will Sergio Ramos with his qualities and character."""
203,10/03/2015,22:44,Madrid edge past Schalke despite stunning defeat,Cristiano Ronaldo became the all-time leading goalscorer in European competitions as Real Madrid sneaked into the quarter-finals of the Champions League 5-4 on aggregate despite losing a seven-goal thriller 4-3 to Schalke on Tuesday.,"The holders looked well set for a place in the last eight for a fifth consecutive season after cruising to a 2-0 win in Gelsenkirchen three weeks ago, but they were given an almighty scare as Schalke twice took the lead in the first-half through Christian Fuchs and Klass-Jan Huntelaar. Ronaldo twice responded with textbook headers to take his tally in European competitions to 78 and surpass former Real and Schalke legend Raul in the process. Karim Benzema then put the hosts in front on the night early in the second-half, but Schalke earned a fully merited win thanks to further strikes from Leroy Sande and Huntelaar. Real came into the game unbeaten in 21 Champions League games at the Bernabeu, but that record seemed under threat from the off in a wretched performance that was only salvaged by Ronaldo's prediatory instincts. Despite their 2-0 deficit from the first-leg Schalke started brightly and should have been in front when Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting side-footed wide from the impressive Max Mayer's cut-back. The visitors did go in front on 20 minutes when Tranquillo Barnetta's cross found its way through to Fuchs and the Austrian's drive had too much power for Iker Casillas. Madrid responded to that shock just five minutes later when Ronaldo rose highest to power home Toni Kroos's corner. However, the chances continued to flow for Schalke as Huntelaar nearly capitalised on a short passback by Raphael Varane and then struck the crossbar with a spectacular volley. The former Madrid striker did find the net at the third time of asking in quick succession as he pounced after Casillas could only parry Meyer's low effort. Again the lead only last five minutes as right on the stroke of half-time Ronaldo headed home his historic goal from a sumptuous Fabio Coentrao cross. The holders finally looked to have put their place in the last eight beyond any doubt eight minutes after the break when Benzema showed his composure in front of goal to leave Timon Wellenreuther on the floor before slotting home. Yet, Schalke refused to lie down and were back in the game just before the hour mark when some more atrocious defending by Madrid allowed 19-year-old substitute Sane plenty of space to curl into the far corner. Madrid boss Carlo Ancelotti then called on Luka Modric on his first appearance after a four-month layoff through injury and Marcelo to restore some order from the bench. The Croatian's presence helped settle Madrid's nerves and Wellenreuther had to be alert to tip a rising over from his compatriot Kroos over the bar. However, another defensive lapse allowed Huntelaar in behind the Madrid defence once more six minutes from time and he fired a stunning finish in off the underside of the bar. And Casillas made some amends for his previous errors by flying to his right to make a desperate save from Benedikt Hoewedes to prevent Schalke pulling off one of the biggest shocks in the history of the competition."
204,09/03/2015,18:01,First goal key to Schalke miracle - Di Matteo,Schalke coach Roberto di Matteo believes his side must score first at the Santiago Bernabeu on Tuesday if they are to have any chance of overturning a 2-0 first leg deficit against Real Madrid in the last 16 of the Champions League.,"Madrid destroyed Schalke 9-2 on aggregate on their way to winning the Champions League for a 10th time last season, but have stumbled recently in La Liga. Carlo Ancelotti's men were beaten for a fourth time in 14 games in 2015 at Athletic Bilbao on Saturday to surrender top spot in La Liga to Barcelona for the first time in five months. ""We have to score the first goal and if we open the scoring then the match could be interesting for us,"" said the Italian, who won the Champions League when in charge of Chelsea in 2012. Madrid's star front three of Cristiano Ronaldo, Karim Benzema and Gareth Bale have particularly come in for criticism as the goals have dried up for Los Blancos in recent weeks. However, Di Matteo dismissed suggestions Schalke were meeting Madrid at the right time to cause an upset. ""I don't believe Real Madrid are in a crisis. I hope the media is right that the strikers are not in good form. We will need a little bit of luck as well tomorrow night to get a positive result. ""The game on Saturday was different. It was an away game in Bilbao, who are a very strong team, and they didn't allow Real Madrid to get into their flow. ""Tomorrow they play in front of their home fans and I think it will be different. ""I think three weeks ago they were talking about a crisis as well with the Real Madrid team. I don't expect a team in crisis tomorrow."""

The unnamed supporter, a member of Schalke's 'Hugos' ultra fan group who has repeatedly appeared in front of the Gelsenkirchen district court for football-related offences since he was 16, had originally been given a suspended sentence last year. But an appeal by state prosecutors saw the sentence changed to a prison term by a regional court in Essen, which the fan has already appealed. The German Football Association (DFB) has been clamping down on flares being lit in Bundesliga stadiums and this is one of the first times a fan has been jailed. During sentencing judge Marcus Doerlemann said the football supporter had acted with complete disregard for the safety of the eight fellow supporters who needed hospital treatment after the 12 flares were let off in a tightly-packed fan block. ""(The flares) were completely out of control, there were children in the fan block, but you didn't care,"" said the judge."
206,28/02/2015,19:02,Caped Aubameyang strikes as Dortmund down Schalke,Gabon star Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang was happy to play Borussia Dortmund's 'superhero' on Saturday by netting in their 3-0 home win over Schalke 04 in the Ruhr Valley derby.,"Dortmund climbed to ninth in the table after picking up their fourth consecutive league win after starting February bottom of the table. After wasted a string of chances, Dortmund got the breakthrough when Aubameyang -- who had compared winning the derby to 'an orgasm' in midweek -- pounced on a mistake in the visitors' defence to roll the ball home on 78 minutes. It was his fifth goal in as many league games and the 25-year-old celebrated by donning a 'Batman' hat, playing up to his 'caped crusader' nickname. His team-mate Marco Reus wore a 'Robin' mask to play his side-kick. ""If you didn't know who Batman and Robin were before, you do now,"" joked Aubameyang. It emerged Aubameyang's translator Massimo Mariotti had hidden the costumes behind the Schalke goal. Henrikh Mkhitaryan made it 2-0 just over a minute after Aubameyang's goal when he slid home Ilkay Gundogan's cross to claim his first goal of the season. Reus, who had crashed a shot against the crossbar, fired wide and had a shot blocked in the first half, finally got on the scoresheet by poaching Borussia's third on 86 minutes to score for the fifth match running in all competitions. Schalke's 19-year-old goalkeeper Timon Wellenreuther paused too long over a back-pass and Reus simply tapped the ball into the empty net behind the despairing teenager. ""That was the game of the year, you can't have a better feeling during the season,"" said Reus. The defeat drops Schalke, who were missing several stars with injury, to fifth while neighbours Dortmund are now just eight points adrift of a Champions League place for next season. ""That was a fantastic afternoon for us. We worked hard for a deserved result,"" said Dortmund coach Jurgen Klopp. ""That was a perfect game from my team from the first to the last minute."" Elsewhere, Bayer Leverkusen built on their shock Champions League win over Atletico Madrid on Wednesday with a 1-0 win at home to strugglers Freiburg to go fourth. Veteran midfielder Simon Rolfes, who will retire at the end of the season, grabbed a first-half winner to give Leverkusen their first league win in four games. Augsburg dropped to sixth after their 1-0 defeat at Hertha Berlin as ex-Chelsea striker Salomon Kalou scored a late winner at the Olympic Stadium to claim his sixth goal of the season. Stuttgart stay bottom after their 1-1 draw at Hanover 96 while Hoffenheim are just two points short of the European places for next season after their 2-0 win at home to Mainz. On Friday, Bayern Munich celebrated their 115th birthday with a 4-1 win over Cologne to go 11 points clear before second-placed Wolfsburg go to resurgent Werder Bremen on Sunday. Arjen Robben netted his 17th goal in 19 league matches this season with a crisp header with 20 minutes left to remain the league's top scorer. Earlier, captain Bastian Schweinsteiger gave hosts Bayern an early lead at the Allianz Arena before Franck Ribery added a second inside 10 minutes. Cologne fought back when Nigeria international Anthony Ujah scored right on the stroke of half-time but Bayern roared back as Robben then Poland striker Robert Lewandowski extended their lead."
207,26/02/2015,13:19,Losing to Schalke is 'forbidden' for Dortmund's Reus,"After Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang compared winning the Ruhr Valley derby to ""an orgasm"" now his Borussia Dortmund team-mate Marco Reus says losing at home to Schalke on Saturday is ""forbidden"".","With just 35 kilometres separating Dortmund from Gelsenkirchen-based Schalke, their Ruhr Valley rivalry is Germany's top derby and is perfectly poised with 30 wins each and 25 draws in their 85 previous meetings. ""When you see the blue and white shirts, you now it's going to be a red-hot battle until you drop. Losing is forbidden,"" Dortmund-born Reus, who last week extended his Borussia contract until 2019, told Bundesliga.de. ""It's a derby you always look forward to, especially when you're playing at home. ""For the city, the club and the fans, it's extremely important to give everything to have to get the win."" Dortmund face the Royal Blues of Schalke at their 80,000-capacity Westfalenstadion ground with the hosts looking to avenge their 2-1 defeat in Gelsenkirchen last September. Three straight league wins have seen Dortmund climb to 12th from bottom of the Bundesliga while Schalke are fourth in the table. Borussia's top-scorer Aubameyang raised eye-brows earlier this week by insisting winning the derby had an erotic factor. ""I love games like this. Derby wins - even if it sounds strange - are almost like an orgasm. In all honesty, it is a similar feeling,"" the fleet-footed winger who has scored four goals in his last four games told magazine Sport Bild. Schalke hope to include Klaas-Jan Huntelaar for Saturday after the Dutch striker returned to training on Monday having bruised his shin in last week's 2-0 Champions League defeat against Real Madrid. Dortmund will definitely be without defender Lukasz Piszczek for the next six weeks after the left-back tore ankle ligaments in Borussia's 2-1 defeat at Juventus on Tuesday. Greece centre-back Sokratis Papastathopoulos faces a race against time with a groin injury, but both defender Neven Subotic and winger Kevin Kampla are set to return after recovering from an upset stomach."
208,18/02/2015,22:54,Real move towards last eight with win over Schalke,"Holders Real Madrid have one foot in the Champions League quarter-finals after beating Schalke in the last 16, first leg, in Germany for a second year running.","A Cristiano Ronaldo header gave the visitors a deserved lead at the break and Marcelo rifled home a superb second goal with 11 minutes left as the Spanish league leaders stretched their winning streak in the competition to 10 games. Ronaldo's goal, his first in four matches, was his 73rd in the Champions League. The Ballon d'Or winner now sits only two behind Barcelona's Lionel Messi in the all-time scorers list. Schalke's Champions League debutant Felix Platte had struck the bar before Marcelo's goal, as the German side fared much better than last season when Real won 6-1 at the Veltins Arena. The home team had employed a compact 5-3-2 formation in the hope of avoiding a repeat of that result and they enjoyed a solid start. With the home fans and players growing in belief, Schalke wing back Dennis Aogo blazed over from the edge of the box after being well set up by Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting and Marco Hoeger. And there were howls of derision when a wild effort from Ronaldo almost went out for a throw-in as Real, playing in unfamiliar pink, struggled to test Schalke goalkeeper Timon Wellenreuther on his Champions League debut. Soon after that, former Real striker Klaas-Jan Huntelaar followed up a bustling run with a long-range strike that Real 'keeper Iker Casillas pushed to safety. But on 27 minutes the visitors hit the front with a remarkably simple goal. Aogo backed off Dani Carvajal, allowing the Real full back to deliver a left-footed cross from the right side of the box. Ronaldo was left completely unmarked and timed his run well to head over the advancing Wellenreuther. It nearly got worse for the home team just past the half hour when Toni Kroos played in Karim Benzema but 19-year-old Wellenreuther made just enough contact to prevent the ball squirming into the net. Schalke's hopes of coming back looked bleak when Huntelaar hobbled off through injury and was replaced by 19-year-old Platte. Wellenreuther then flung himself to his right to keep out a free kick from Ronaldo after the Real attacker was scythed down by Kevin-Prince Boateng. Boateng was booked as a result of the foul, meaning he will be suspended for the return leg on March 10. Ronaldo continued to threaten but Schalke survived until the interval. In the second half, Boateng twice tried his luck from distance and Isco side-footed over from inside the box for Real before Schalke came desperately close to an equaliser. Atsuto Uchida ran on to a long ball after 74 minutes and cleverly teed up the impressive Platte, who saw his fierce strike hit the bar. Uchida got on the end of the rebound but his effort lacked the power to beat Casillas. And Real ensured they would return to Spain with a commanding advantage when Brazilian left-back Marcelo drove a sublime right-footed strike to the top corner from the edge of the penalty area."
209,17/02/2015,18:15,"Real won't thrash Schalke again, vows Di Matteo",Schalke manager Roberto Di Matteo is confident his side can avoid another thrashing at the hands of Real Madrid in their Champions League last 16 clash on Wednesday.,"On their way to being crowned European champions last season, Real hammered Schalke 9-2 on aggregate at the same stage of the competition. Last year's tie was all but over after the first leg, which the Spanish side won 6-1 in Germany. But Di Matteo is hopeful that the home team will be more competitive at the Veltins Arena this time. ""It'll be a test of how far we've come at an international level, how far the guys have developed and improved,"" Di Matteo said. ""Obviously Real are the favourites over the two games but I think we have a bit more experience of these games now and hopefully we can show that tomorrow."" Di Matteo replaced Jens Keller as Schalke manager in October and guided the German side to a second-placed finish in their group behind his former team Chelsea. The Italian has already proven that he can upset the odds on this stage, having led Chelsea to their first Champions League title in 2012 by beating Bayern Munich in the final in a penalty shootout. ""That's experience but that's the past,"" he said on Tuesday. ""I'm coaching a different team now and we're playing against the current Champions League holder - a great team. So I think it's a different situation. ""We just want to show that we've improved - that we're a better team than in the past."" Schalke have no fresh injury concerns following a 1-0 defeat at Eintracht Frankfurt on Saturday and they also have former Real Madrid striker Klaas-Jan Huntelaar available again. The Dutch international, who has been serving a domestic ban, believes the Bundesliga outfit have learned from the five-goal loss against Real Madrid last season. ""I think in that game we made a few mistakes at the start and we conceded a goal too,"" he said. ""But at the same time I think we had some good moments, like with Julian Draxler's chance. ""It could have been 1-1 then but once we went 3-0 down we lost too easily."" Huntelaar, who scored Schalke's consolation goal in last year's first leg, has also taken solace from their two league draws against Bayern Munich this season. ""I think at the moment we're playing a different system that's brought us some stability,"" the 31-year-old said. ""In the last game against Bayern we played that way too and Bayern are a top team like Real. We're pleased about it and it's made us stronger I think."""
210,17/02/2015,02:30,Kroos wary of Real complacency at Schalke,"Having routed Schalke on their last Gelsenkirchen visit, Real Madrid return to Germany for Wednesday's Champions League last 16, first-leg, clash with Toni Kroos warning the Spanish giants against complacency.","Real ran riot at Schalke's Veltins Arena at exactly the same stage of the competition last February when Karim Benzema, Cristiano Ronaldo and Gareth Bale each scored two goals in a 6-1 thrashing as part of a 9-2 aggregate victory. It was Schalke's heaviest European home defeat until the margin was matched when Chelsea drubbed the hosts 5-0 in Gelsenkirchen in the group stages last November. Madrid have won only three of their 27 trips to Germany, but two of victories came last year when they smashed Schalke, then routed Bayern Munich 4-0 at home in the semi-final, second-leg. Holders Real will arrive in Germany with a lengthy walking-wounded list with Sergio Ramos, Luka Modric, James Rodriguez, Sami Khedira and Fabio Coentrao all out injured. Carlo Ancelotti's Spanish league leaders are struggling for form after being hammered 4-0 at Atletico Madrid ten days ago and laboured to a 2-0 home win over Deportivo La Coruna on Saturday. ""You don't win anything by going through the motions, that also goes for Real Madrid,"" said their Germany midfielder Kroos. ""If we have two good days, we can go very far, but only then."" Real defender Pepe is rated as doubtful as he recovers from a rib injury. Madrid superstar Cristiano Ronaldo is struggling with the patella tendon injury in his left knee that affected him towards the end of last season and at the World Cup. The Ballon d'Or winner has not scored in the last three games and has come under-fire since being sent off last month in the narrow win at Cordoba. He was heavily criticised for hosting his 30th birthday party hours after Real were thrashed by Atletico. But attacking midfielder Isco says Real are at their best when under pressure. ""What's great about this team is that it's able to pick itself up from the tough situations,"" said the 22-year-old who scored against Deportivo. ""I think that having been brought down to earth is going to do us good and now we're going to move forward. ""Now we have to go to Germany, to a difficult ground, but we're Real Madrid and we go for it. ""This week will be an important step for what's ahead."" Fourth-placed Schalke stumbled to a 1-0 defeat at mid-table Eintracht Frankfurt in the Bundesliga on Saturday. It was the Royal Blues first defeat in six league games, but nevertheless they are relishing the challenge ""We know we got swatted away last year and that Real Madrid is currently one of the best sides in the world, but teams like that are beatable,"" insisted Schalke captain Benedikt Hoewedes. Schalke will have Dutch goal-ace Klaas-Jan Huntelaar available after missing their last two Bundesliga matches with suspension. Fabian Giefer could be set to return from injury after third-choice teenage shot-stopper Timon Wellenreuther has started the last two games with first-choice Ralf Faehrmann out with a knee injury. Cameroon defender Joel Matip says Shalke must prove they learnt the lessons from last year's Real debacle. ""You can always achieve something in football, we are looking forward to the game and we want to show that we learnt from the last year,"" he said. But one comment which could well come back to haunt Schalke came when board member Peter Peters bullishly stated: ""form beats class"" after the draw in Nyon. In truth, Roberto di Matteo's Royal Blues can not realistically stake a current claim to either. ""We won't treat this as a jaunt and it should be our goal to do better than we did last time,"" said director of sport Horst Heldt with a more realistic appraisal."

Replacement striker Srdjan Lakic levelled just a minute after coming on and his 72nd-minute header was followed up when Alban Meha found the back of the net with a free-kick on 79 minutes. It was Paderborn's first win since the start of November and saw them climb from 17th before kick-off to 12th. Earlier, Freiburg had briefly escaped the bottom three with a 2-0 win at Hertha Berlin in Sunday's basement battle. The defeat dampened Pal Dardai's debut in charge of Hertha after the Hungarian national team coach took charge when Jos Lukukay was sacked earlier this month. But Paderborn's victory pushed Freiburg back to 16th and in the relegation places with Hertha second from bottom on a bumper weekend of goals in the German league. There were 38 goals in the German league's nine games as leaders Bayern Munich enjoyed an 8-0 rout of Hamburg while Wolfsburg won a 5-4 thriller at Bayer Leverkusen. On Saturday, Bayern claimed the biggest Bundesliga win for 30 years to warm up for Tuesday's Champions League clash at to Shakhtar Donetsk by hammering Hamburg in Munich. Stars Arjen Robben, Thomas Mueller and Mario Goetze all netted twice as Bayern ran riot at Munich's Allianz Arena ahead of Tuesday's last-16, first-leg clash against Shakhtar in Lviv. This was Bayern's biggest league win since routing Kickers Offenbach 9-0 in March 1984 and it was the league's highest score since Borussia Moenchengladbach crushed Eintracht Braunschweig 10-0 in October the same year. It was Hamburg's heaviest ever league defeat. Just over two years after their 9-2 drubbing at Munich's Allianz Arena, Hamburg were again made to suffer having also been beaten 3-1, 5-0 and 6-0 on their last four visits to Bavaria. Second-placed Wolfsburg had Bas Dost to thank for their 5-4 win at Leverkusen as the towering Dutch striker claimed four goals while Bayer's Son Heung-Min scored a hat-trick, yet still lost. Having gone 3-0 up, Wolfsburg survived a spirited fight-back as Son claimed a hat-trick in just ten second-half minutes. Leverkusen finished with 10 men after Bosnia defender Emir Spahic was sent off late on for a second yellow card before Dost hit his fourth goal in the 93rd minute to secure a dramatic victory. The result leaves Wolfsburg both eight points ahead of third-placed Gladbach and as many behind leaders Bayern. Moenchengladbach claimed a 1-0 win at Cologne as Swiss midfielder c headed their 91st-minute winner. Two home fans were arrested after a 30-strong group invaded the pitch after the final whistle. Schalke 04 suffered a 1-0 defeat at Eintracht Frankfurt in preparation for hosting holders Real Madrid in Wednesday's Champions League last 16, first-leg, tie. Frankfurt's Brazilian midfielder Lucas Piazon headed home from a corner with 65 minutes gone to leave his side ninth while Schalke dropped to fourth. Werder Bremen's remarkable run continues with a 3-2 win at Augsburg for their fifth straight victory which has taken them from 18th to eighth and the verge of a European place. VfB Stuttgart stayed bottom of the table after their 2-1 defeat at Hoffenheim, thanks to Sebastian Rudy's 93rd-minute winner.

But Zidane, who currently coaches Real's reserves, says the first-team should take nothing for granted this time in Gelsenkirchen. ""I would like to say that Schalke has no chance and Real will safely reach the quarter-finals,"" the 42-year-old ex-Real midfielder told German daily Die Welt on Sunday. ""But in the knockout phase anything can happen. In two games, you have double the chance of an outsider playing above themselves. ""You must always be cautious -- especially against a German team."" Real have won only three of their 27 away matches in Germany. Two of those victories came last season when they smashed Schalke, then routed Bayern Munich in the semi-finals on the way to winning the title.

216,06/02/2015,02:16,Guardiola shows strain as Bayern head to Stuttgart,Pep Guardiola is showing signs of feeling the pressure as Bundesliga leaders Bayern Munich hunt their first win of the year at strugglers VfB Stuttgart on Saturday.,"Bayern have failed to impress so far in 2015 in their two matches since returning from the Bundesliga's winter break with an 11-point lead. Their shock 4-1 thrashing at second-placed Wolfsburg last Friday was followed by a 1-1 draw at home to Schalke on Tuesday after playing for 70 minutes with ten men. The usually calm and composed Bayern coach sprinted 45 metres to remonstrate with the assistant referee after a Robert Lewandowski goal was disallowed in the 66th minute against Schalke. ""It was an emotional thing to do. I just spoke to him. It was very, very nice,"" said Guardiola tongue-in-cheek after the heated confrontation. But despite his brush-off remark, Guardiola needs an impressive display from Bayern to sooth any jarred nerves after the Wolfsburg defeat. Having steamrollered their domestic rivals before Christmas, Bayern were rattled in Wolfsburg and allowed Schalke to equalise, albeit with a numerical disadvantage following Jerome Boateng's dismissal. The Germany defender is banned for the next three games and misses the Stuttgart trip, plus home matches against Hamburg and away to Paderborn Stuttgart present the ideal chance to get back on track as Huub Stevens side are third from bottom after winning just one of their nine home games this season. Arjen Robben headed Bayern into the lead at the Allianz Arena before Schalke equalised and the Dutch star says they can ill afford similar performances as they bid for silverware. ""Of course, we played with ten men for most of the match, but when you let them equalise, conceding a goal like that can be deadly in the Champions League,"" said the 31-year-old. Bayern have two league games before they face Shakhtar Donetsk in the Ukrainian city of Lviv in the Champions League last 16, first-leg clash. Second-placed VfL Wolfsburg are set to give Andre Schuerrle his debut at home to Hoffenheim after signing the Germany winger from Chelsea on Monday to end his 19-month sojourn in London. Wolves needed a late Kevin de Bruyne goal to scrape a point in their 1-1 draw at Eintracht Frankfurt on Tuesday after their shock win over Bayern. China's Zhang Xizhe is waiting for his debut. Hertha Berlin are at Mainz 05 on Saturday with the capital city club second from bottom and with former player Pal Dardai and ex-assistant coach Rainer Widmayer now in charge. On Thursday, ex-coach Jos Luhukay became the fifth Bundesliga coach to be sacked this season after Wednesday's 1-0 loss at home to Bayer Leverkusen meant three defeats in three games. The Berlin club are battling to avoid their third relegation since 2010. Mainz will have striker Shinji Okazaki back in the side for the first time since his return from the Asian Cup where Japan reached the quarter-finals. Ahead of their trip to face Freiburg, Borussia Dortmund's coach Jurgen Klopp has insisted he will not resign with his side bottom of the table as they bid to avoid a first relegation since 1976. Dortmund will be without Kevin Grosskreutz at Freiburg and the Germany midfielder misses the next six weeks with a torn thigh muscle. He joins Ilkay Gundogan, Erik Durm and Lukasz Piszczek on Borussia's injury list. Roberto di Matteo's Schalke 04, who are sixth, have the chance to climb further up the table when they host third-placed Borussia Moenchengladbach. ""They are a direct competitor for a Champions League place and if we play as well as we did at Bayern, we will make Friday count,"" said Schalke captain Benedikt Hoewedes. Fixtures (all times GMT)"
217,04/02/2015,22:21,Ten-man Augsburg add to Dortmund's relegation woes,Borussia Dortmund's relegation worries deepened on Wednesday after their 11th defeat of the season a 1-0 loss at home to 10-man Augsburg kept the ailing German giants rooted to the bottom of the Bundesliga.,"Raul Bobadilla's second-half goal lifted his team up to fourth in the table but left Dortmund -- who in the past four seasons have won two successive titles in 2011 and 2012 and finish runners-up in the subsequent campaigns -- in serious danger of being relegated for the first time since 1972. Augsburg took a deserved lead when veteran Turkish international striker Halil Altintop managed to get his pass away despite the attentions of a posse of Dortmund defenders to leave Bobadilla free to fire home his third goal in as many games on 50 minutes. To add to Borussia's woes, Kevin Grosskreutz joined their lengthy walking wounded list by limping off with a thigh injury. Augsburg were reduced to ten men on 64 minutes when defender Christoph Janker was shown a straight red for hauling down Dortmund's Gabon winger Pierre-Emerick Aubemayang. But Jurgen Klopp's 2013 Champions League finalists failed to make the numerical advantage count to suffer their fourth home defeat of the season. Italy striker Ciro Immobile squandered a golden chance in added time when he headed straight at Augsburg goalkeeper Alexander Manninger. Dortmund are two points adrift of second-from-bottom Stuttgart after they drew 0-0 with Cologne. Bayer Leverkusen moved up to fifth thanks to a 1-0 win at Hertha Berlin, Stefan Kiessling scored the only goal of the game just after the half-time break at the Olympic Stadium. Hamburg moved up to 13th in the table with their first win in five matches with an emphatic 3-0 victory at home to Paderborn. Their captain and Dutch midfielder Raphael van der Vaart opened the scoring after just two minutes when he converted a penalty as left winger Marcell Jansen was fouled in the area. Former Germany squad member Jansen then made sure of the three points when he fired home on 72 minutes before attacking midfielder Zoltan Stieber added their third in the 91st minute. Hamburg's north German neighbours Werder Bremen continued their eyecatching climb up the table to 11th with their third straight win as they claimed a 2-1 victory at Hoffenheim. Bremen took an early lead when ex-Chelsea striker Franco di Santo scored his third goal in his two matches since a knee injury after just eight minutes. Hoffenheim drew level through a header by defender Ermin Bicakcic, only for Philipp Bargfrede to make it 2-1 when he fired home Di Santo's final pass on 52 minutes. Bayern Munich stayed eight points clear at the top of the table despite playing for 70 minutes with 10 men in their 1-1 draw at home to Schalke 04 on Tuesday. Arjen Robben headed Bayern into a second-half lead before Royal Blues captain Benedikt Hoewedes equalised from a corner five minutes later. Pep Guardiola's defending champions were reduced to ten men when Jerome Boatenng was shown a straight red with only 17 minutes gone for fouling Sidney Sam in the area. Second-placed VfL Wolfsburg missed the chance to close the gap behind Bayern when they needed a late Kevin de Bruyne goal to rescue a point in their 1-1 draw at Eintracht Frankfurt."
218,04/02/2015,20:35,Legendary German coach Lattek dies,"Legendary German coach Udo Lattek, who won the European Cup, UEFA Cup and European Cup Winners' Cup with three different clubs, died on Wednesday aged 80.","He passed away at a nursing home in Cologne and is survived by his wife and two daughters. Lattek led Bayern Munich to their 1974 European Cup triumph and to three straight German league titles between 1972 until 1974. He then steered Borussia Moenchengladbach to the 1979 UEFA Cup and the German league titles in 1976 and 1977 before taking his Midas touch to Spain where he won the 1982 European Cup Winners' Cup with Barcelona. In total, he won 14 titles at the three clubs and along with Giovanni Trapattoni is the only coach to have won all three major European club titles. ""It is with deep sadness that I learnt of Udo Lattek's death,"" FIFA president Sepp Blatter tweeted. ""A coaching legend has passed away. My condolences to his family."" Wolfgang Niersbach, the president of the German Football Association (DFB), led the tributes from across Germany's football community. ""Udo Lattek was not only the most successful coach in the Bundesliga's history, but an outstanding personality of German football,"" he said. ""In 2012, the DFB honoured him for his life's work, because he had a decisive influence over decades of football. ""He will be remembered for the championships and titles he won as well as for his direct, but always endearing manner. ""Udo Lattek was a living legend, he will be missed."""
219,04/02/2015,14:13,Huntelaar suspended until Real Madrid clash,"Schalke striker Klaas-Jan Huntelaar was suspended Monday for the next three Bundesliga games by the German Football Association (DFB), ruling him out until the club's Champions League clash against Real Madrid.","'The Hunter' was shown a straight red for tackling Hanover's Manuel Schmiedebach from behind last Saturday, earning him an automatic one-game ban. Having already sat out Schalke's 1-1 draw at Bayern Munich on Tuesday, the DFB decided his offence, a wild hack at the back of Schmiedebach's legs, warranted a four-game ban in total. The Dutch striker will not now play again until Schalke host holders Real Madrid in the Champions League last 16, first-leg clash, in a fortnight in Gelsenkirchen. The 31-year-old had been facing a potential six-match ban by the DFB's disciplinary committee, but was instead given four with two matches suspended. The Netherlands forward must also pay a 15,000 euros ($17,177) fine. The two suspended matches of his ban will be enforced if Huntelaar receives another red card before January 31 2016. Huntelaar, who has scored seven goals in 17 games this season, misses Friday's clash at third-placed Borussia Moenchengladbach, and trips to mid-table Eintracht Frankfurt on February 14 and Werder Bremen a week later."
220,04/02/2015,12:40,Bayern target first win of 2015 at Stuttgart,Bayern Munich's stand-in captain Bastian Schweinsteiger says the Bundesliga leaders must raise their game at VfB Stuttgart on Saturday to secure their first league win of 2015.,"After Friday's shock 4-1 defeat at second-placed Wolfsburg, Bayern took a point despite playing for more than 70 minutes with ten men in Tuesday's 1-1 draw at home to Schalke, who are fourth. Arjen Robben's second-half header for the hosts was cancelled out by Benedikt Hoewedes at Bayern's Allianz Arena after Germany defender Jerome Boateng was sent off with just 17 minutes gone. Bayern hold an eight-point lead at the top of the table, but having taken just a single point from a possible six, Schweinsteiger wants both a win and convincing display at second-from-bottom Stuttgart. ""We need a win as well as a good performance in Stuttgart,"" said Schweinsteiger, Bayern's skipper in the absence of the injured Philipp Lahm. ""We played better than we did against Wolfsburg, we controlled the game more and didn't allow them to counter-attack, but we're not happy to have drawn with Schalke. ""Even with ten men, we still had chances to win the game."" Goal-scorer Robben says Bayern must improve if they want to challenge for this season's Champions League title as they prepare to face Shakhtar Donetsk away in a fortnight in their last 16, first-leg tie. ""We controlled the game with a man down, but the Schalke result is annoying,"" said the 31-year-old Robben. ""Of course, we played with ten men for most of the match, but when you go 1-0 up and then let them equalise, conceding a goal like that can be deadly in the Champions League."" Schalke face holders Real Madrid at home in their Champions League last-16, first-leg clash in a fortnight. Roberto di Matteo's side face a tough task having been routed 6-1 by the Spaniards at the same stage of the competition in Gelsenkirchen last season. ""We picked up a point in Munich and our plan worked well, but despite that we're a bit disappointed with the result,"" said Di Matteo. The ex-Chelsea boss was forced into giving teenager Timon Wellenreutehr his professional debut in the second-half after Schalke's two other goalkeepers were injured. Goal-scorer and captain Hoewedes said the Royal Blues need to beat third-placed Borussia Moenchengladbach on Friday to stay on course for a place in next season's Champions League. ""We've made a good start to the second half of the season, but now it's all about Borussia Moenchengladbach at home,"" he said. ""This a direct competitor for a Champions League place and if we play as well as we did at Bayern, we will make Friday count."""
221,03/02/2015,22:38,Schalke hold ten-man Bayern,Defending champions Bayern Munich managed to secure a 1-1 draw at home to Schalke 04 despite having played over 70 minutes of the match with just 10 men after Jerome Boateng was sent off on Tuesday.,"While Bayern have failed to win their two games since the return to action after the winter break they maintained their eight point lead at the top of the table. Second-placed VfL Wolfsburg -- who inflicted the leaders first league defeat of the season last Friday -- had to come from behind to draw 1-1 at Eintracht Frankfurt. Bayern had Boateng dismissed with just 17 minutes gone at the Allianz Arena for a foul on Schalke's Sidney Sam, but Munich goalkeeper Manuel Neuer easily saved the resulting penalty. Arjen Robben's second-half header gave Bayern the lead before Schalke captain Benedikt Hoewedes equalised five minutes later. Schalke had personnel problems of their own as Dutch striker Klaas-Jan Huntelaar, last season's league top scorer, is suspended while injury meant the Royal Blues played their third-choice goalkeeper for the second half. Bayern suffered an early set back as centre-back Boateng was shown a straight red for bringing down Sam. It was the first penalty Bayern have conceded at home in the league all season, but Neuer easily stopped Eric Choupo-Moting's weak effort. Schalke gave 19-year-old goalkeeper Timon Wellenreuther his debut for the second-half after Fabian Giefer, who had replaced first-choice Ralf Faehrmann, was unable to come back out as he had suffered a thigh injury. The teenager made a key save to deny Robben early in the second-half, but Schalke fell behind soon afterwards. Xabi Alonso's corner found Robben unmarked and he headed home on 67 minutes. The lead lasted five minutes as Bayern made the same mistake to leave Schalke skipper Hoewedes free to power home a header to level the scores. Wolfsburg needed a late goal from Belgian international Kevin de Bruyne to rescue a point. Wolves opted to leave Andre Schuerrle out of the matchday squad having signed the Germany winger for a club record 32 million euros ($36million, £24million) from Chelsea on Monday. The visitors were brought back down to earth after beating Bayern as Frankfurt's Stefan Aigner put the hosts ahead in the 58th minute and nearly added a second soon after. But De Bruyne, who scored twice in the 4-1 romp over Bayern, underlined his stellar season by scoring two minutes fron time to leave him with six goals and 11 assists this season. Borussia Moenchengladbach consolidated third place with a 1-0 win at home to Freiburg, Patrick Herrmann scoring his second goal in as many games. Wednesday's action will see ailing giants Borussia Dortmund, presently bottom of the table, bid to claim three much-needed points when they host fifth-placed Augsburg."
222,02/02/2015,09:57,Bayern out to bounce back against Schalke 04,German league leaders Bayern Munich look to get their Bundesliga campaign back on track against Schalke 04 on Tuesday following their shock defeat at VfL Wolfsburg.,"Second-placed Wolves cut Bayern's lead to eight points on Friday as Bas Dost and Kevin de Bruyne both struck twice as the Bavarian giants suffered their heaviest league defeat for six years. Roberto di Matteo's Schalke, who are fourth in the table, are seeking only their fourth away league win of the season and their first at Munich's Allianz Arena since 2009. Bayern's Gelsenkirchen-born goalkeeper Manuel Neuer is relishing facing his home town club. ""It would have been worse if we'd had to wait eight days for our next game,"" said the ex-Schalke shot-stopper. ""Wolfsburg wasn't a good start to the second half of the season for us, that is obvious, we had imagine things would go differently. ""It wasn't a catastrophe, but we know we still have a lot of work ahead of us."" Netherlands winger Arjen Robben said Pep Guardiola's Bayern must respond after their ""wake-up call"" against Wolves. ""We have to learn our lessons and perhaps it's not so bad for the future,"" added Robben. Schalke will be without Netherlands star striker Klaas-Jan Huntelaar, the league's top scorer last season, who is suspended after being sent off for a reckless tackle in the 1-0 home win over Hanover 96 last Saturday. ""Klaas is obviously disappointed, it's a real shame. We'll have to see how we can cope with his loss,"" said Di Matteo. The Schalke coach is also waiting on the fitness of midfielder Marco Hoeger, who limped off after scoring Saturday's winner with a thigh injury. Second-placed Wolfsburg are hoping to include Chelsea's Andre Schuerrle for Tuesday's away match at Eintracht Frankfurt if they sign the Germany winger before the transfer window closes. Schuerrle has said he wants to join Wolves, who are offering a four-year deal and a transfer worth 30 million euros, but the deal is reported to be stalling over the money offered to Chelsea. Bottom side Borussia Dortmund have their work cut out as they chase their first win in six games when they travel to Augsburg on Wednesday. Augsburg climbed to fifth after securing their tenth win of the season with a 3-1 victory over Hoffenheim on Sunday while Dortmund have lost 10 of their first 18 matches. Borussia earned a precious point with a goalless draw at fellow Champions League side Bayer Leverkusen on Saturday, but are only three points from mid-table. Fixtures (All times 1900 GMT)"

The Dutch international has netted 66 goals in 117 league games at Schalke, but is now suspended for what already looked a difficult league clash at Bayern's Allianz Arena on Tuesday. ""The red card against Klaas-Jan Huntelaar has hurt us,"" admitted Schalke coach Roberto Di Matteo. ""It was a foul and the referee was in a good position. ""Klaas-Jan was trying to win the ball, but didn't succeed and, of course, it's a pity he will be missing now."" The Royal Blues went ahead at the Veltins Arena when midfielder Marco Hoeger slotted his shot past Hanover's Germany goalkeeper Ron-Robert Zieler with 32 minutes gone. The win lifted Di Matteo's Schalke, who face holders Real Madrid in the last 16 of the Champions League next month, up to fourth in the table. Pep Guardiola's Bayern had their lead cut to eight points on Friday when they suffered a shock 4-1 hammering at second-placed VfL Wolfsburg as the Bundesliga resumed after the winter break. Borussia Moenchengladbach went third in the league on Saturday after Patrick Herrmann netted their second-half goal in a 1-0 win over VfB Stuttgart, who dropped to second from bottom. Herrmann drilled home Branimir Hrgota's swirling cross 20 minutes from time to move Lucien Favre's side up behind leaders Bayern and VfL Wolfsburg. With Borussia Dortmund at Bayer Leverkusen later on Saturday, Freiburg sent Jurgen Klopp's Dortmund to the bottom of the table with a 4-1 comeback win at home to Eintracht Frankfurt. Ex-Bayern Munich striker Nils Petersen came off the bench to claim a second-half hat-trick on his debut, having joined from Werder Bremen at the end of December. Freiburg picked up their first win since November, which catapulted them up from last place to 13th in the table. Cologne pulled away from the relegation zone and up to tenth with a 2-0 win at strugglers Hamburg, who drop to 15th and just above the bottom three. Cologne picked up their fifth away win, to match Bayern's tally on the road as midfielder Marcel Risse scored both second-half goals. He fired his first through the legs of Hamburg goalkeeper Jaroslav Drobny before burying a final pass from Nigeria's Anthony Ujah 12 minutes from time. Mid-table Mainz romped to a 5-0 win over Paderborn as midfielder Yunus Malli scored twice and set up their third."
224,29/01/2015,09:08,Guardiola relishing Wolfsburg showdown,Bayern Munich resume their seemingly relentless march towards a third straight Bundesliga title on Friday with coach Pep Guardiola relishing their clash at second-placed Wolfsburg.,"The Bavarian giants hold an 11-point lead over the Wolves as the Bundesliga resumes after the winter break. Bayern travel north with only captain Philipp Lahm, Javi Martinez and Thiago Alcantara on the long-term casualty list with Germany defender Holger Badstuber set to return from injury. Bayern want to hit the ground running before hosting Schalke 04 next Tuesday and then facing Stuttgart away the following Saturday. ""I think it's good to face the team in second immediately because it forces us to pick up the pace,"" said Guardiola. ""Wolfsburg have played an outstanding season so far so that will be tough. ""Then we have our first home game of the new year against Schalke and that will also be difficult."" ""We know how important the first two or three games will be and if we can win our first couple of games of 2015 then we will realise we can take a big step towards defending our Bundesliga title."" Wolfsburg play their first match since the death of Belgium Under-21 international Junior Malanda earlier this month in a car crash. It remains to be seen whether China midfielder Zhang Xizhe makes his Bundesliga debut for Wolves. Due to their massive lead, Bayern's main rivals have given up hope of catching up with Wolfsburg coach Dieter Hecking rejecting the media's label for his side of 'Bayern Hunters'. Rudi Voeller, third-placed Bayer Leverkusen's director of sport, has insisted there are ""worlds"" between Bayern and the chasing pack. At the other end of the table, last season's runners-up Borussia Dortmund look to climb out of the relegation places. After 10 defeats in 17 games, Dortmund are level with bottom side Freiburg on 15 points and the 2013 Champions League finalists are determined to improve their fortunes at Bayer Leverkusen on Saturday. Dortmund welcome back Germany winger Marco Reus and attacking midfielder Henrikh Mkhitaryan from injury. But they will be without defensive midfielders Sven Bender and Sebastian Kehl after the pair picked up injuries during the winter break training camp in Spain. Dortmund coach Jurgen Klopp has described going into the winter break in 17th place as feeling ""like going on holiday on a bed of nails"". Dortmund boosted their squad over the winter break by signing Slovenian right winger Kevin Kampl from RB Salzburg. Klopp has said his main focus is keeping Dortmund in the Bundesliga, rather than targeting a Champions League place. ""Obviously, we have been viewed harshly, also by our own fans,"" Klopp admitted. ""We have to win back some credit, but we can't just focus on Leverkusen."" Fifth-placed Schalke 04, who face holders Real Madrid in the last 16 of the Champions League, host mid-table Hanover 96, who have re-signed Ivory Coast striker Didier Ya Konan after a six-month sojourn with Saudi Arabian side Al-Ittihad.

The heavy fine, handed out by the German Football Association (DFB), comes after a referee's assistant was also hit by a plastic beer cup during a home league match last September. Schalke face Real Madrid in the last 16 of the Champions League next month and are currently fifth in the Bundesliga table before their first league match against Hanover 96 on January 31."
226,21/12/2014,02:10,Bayern's domination sparks 'boring Bundesliga' debate,"Bayern Munich will start 2015 with a record 11-point lead in the Bundesliga, sparking debate over how to stop Germany's top flight becoming boring.","Pep Guardiola's Bayern have brushed off their domestic rivals with ease and are poised to become the first team to go through a Bundesliga campaign unbeaten on their way to what would be a third consecutive title. They set more records in Friday's 2-1 comeback win at Mainz having conceded just four goals since August and their points lead at the season's halfway stage is also a league best. They have dropped only six points from a possible 51 so far and post heavy wins in Germany's top tier with monotonous regularity. None of the chasing pack of Wolfsburg, Borussia Moenchengladbach, Bayer Leverkusen or Schalke look realistically capable of closing the gap while last season's runners-up Borussia Dortmund are languishing in the relegation places. Ex-Germany coach Berti Vogts sparked debate about how to loosen Bayern's iron grip on the German title by suggesting they should receive less of the league's television revenue. Sky currently pay 628 million euros ($768m) to televise Bundesliga games in Germany and the cash is divided up on a percentage basis with the most going to the league winner. ""We have to get to the point where we subsidise the smaller clubs, by a redistribution of the television money, for example,"" suggested Vogts. But the mere suggestion left ex-Bayern midfielder and Germany international Paul Breitner fuming. ""We (Bayern) can't do anything about the inability of the other clubs. And if we have to bleed now, so the money is redistributed, that's just nonsense!"" he snapped. Bayern are one of the world's richest clubs. They recently paid off the loan on their Allianz Arena stadium decades ahead of schedule and posted a record 528.7 million-euro turnover for the 2013/14 season, with a profit of 16.5 million euros. German teams seem to play Bayern in more hope than expectation of claiming league points. ""Bayern Munich are in a different league, I think we can all agree on that,"" said Augsburg coach Markus Weinzierl after Bayern thrashed his team 4-0 at home. And Hoffenheim coach Markus Gisdol reached the same conclusion before his side were duly dispatched 4-0 in Munich. ""Bayern will lose at home sooner or later, but when you lose four, five or six-nil in Munich, that's normal,"" he mused. Having won the 2011 and 2012 German league titles, then finished runners-up to Bayern in the last two seasons, Dortmund now peer up at Guardiola's Munich from near the foot of the table. Having seen his top players playmaker Mario Goetze and striker Robert Lewandowski join Bayern in the last two seasons, Dortmund coach Jurgen Klopp said any German football fan looking for a consistently successful team has only one choice. ""Anyone who just wants to be successful has only one avenue to go down: you have to be a Bayern fan,"" said Klopp, tongue-in-cheek. Klopp predicted the current league situation back in April 2013, two months before Guardiola's arrival. Just before Bayern beat Dortmund 2-1 in the 2013 Champions League final, the German media questioned whether the Bundesliga was following the Spanish league, where two clubs, Real Madrid and Barcelona, traditionally dominate. But Klopp accurately predicted the Bundesliga would mirror Scotland, where Celtic have won the last three league titles after rivals Rangers dropped out of the top flight after the club's liquidation in 2012. ""It's nice that people put us in the same boat as Bayern,"" said Klopp in April 2013, with Dortmund second in the table, but trailing Bayern by 20 points. ""But I think from the start of next season, we'll see that the comparison to Spain doesn't fit, it's more like Scotland."" Even the league's top scorer, Eintracht Frankfurt's Alexander Meier, expects the trophy for the most goals this season to eventually end up in Munich. ""I don't look at the top-scorer table and I honestly think the trophy will go to someone from Bayern,"" he said."

Schalke, who have drawn Real Madrid in the last 16 of the Champions League, broke the news before Saturday's Bundesliga match against Hamburg. Huntelaar, the third highest scorer in Schalke's history, has scored seven goals in 15 Bundesliga games this season, scoring three times in the Champions League, and has forged a partnership alongside Cameroon striker Eric Choupo-Moting."

""We highly recommend that the person responsible gives himself up to police,"" Peters added, which would mean a milder punishment if there is a conviction. Roberto di Matteo's assistant Huebscher was left pole-axed and bleeding from a head wound on the sidelines after being struck on the head by a lighter on Saturday at Gelsenkirchen's Veltins Arena. The metal lighter was thrown from a section of the crowd behind the Schalke bench in the late stages of Saturday's 2-1 home defeat by Cologne which left the Royal Blues sixth in the league.

""We hope the perpetrator can be identified. That is unacceptable,"" said Schalke's director of sport Horst Heldt. Having scraped into the Champions League's last 16 with a 1-0 win at Slovenia's Maribor on Wednesday, Di Matteo's Schalke had their three-match winning streak ended by Cologne.

""We put in a very good performance and deserved the win over Mainz,"" said the 44-year-old Di Matteo in only his ninth game as Schalke head coach. ""That was a win for the whole group and was the best reaction we could have expected after the Chelsea defeat. ""We defended very well and then played well going forward."" Schalke's all-action performance in the win over Mainz was in stark contrast to their confidence-sapping drubbing at the hands of Chelsea. Huntelaar fired Schalke into a 2-0 lead after just 25 minutes with two superb goals before Japan striker Shinji Okazaki pulled one back for visitors Mainz. Schalke made sure of the three points when Huntelaar's final pass was curled home by Swiss midfielder Tranquillo Barnetta on 54 minutes. The Dutchman completed his hat-trick when he slammed home Eric-Choupo Moting's final pass on 61 minutes. On Tuesday, Di Matteo, who remains the only Chelsea coach to have won the Champions League title, came off second best to Jose Mourinho's Premier League leaders, who booked their last 16 passage as group winners while Schalke dropped to third in Group G. Chelsea dominated Schalke from start to finish as defender John Terry scored with a header after just 87 seconds. Schalke must now beat bottom side Maribor away in Slovenia in 10 days, while hoping Chelsea beat Sporting Lisbon at Stamford Bridge, to reach the knock-out stage."

Further first-half scores by Willian and an own goal from defender Jan Kirchhoff was followed by second-half strikes from Didier Drogba and Brazil midfielder Ramires. The result fell just short of Schalke's record European home defeat when they were hammered 6-1 by Real Madrid in last season's round of 16, first leg, in February this year. Chelsea remain unbeaten in all 19 matches this season and are now four-points clear in the table ahead of their final match at home to second-placed Sporting Lisbon in a fortnight. Schalke drop to third, having been leap-frogged by Sporting who won 2-1 at home to Maribor, who they now face away in Slovenia in their final game next month. Di Matteo, who is just eight games into the Schalke job, remains the only Chelsea manager to win the Champions League title and Mourinho refused to even talk about him in the match's build-up. The self-styled 'Special One', who won the Champions League with Inter Milan in 2010 and Porto in 2004, is bidding to win the European crown at the fifth attempt with Chelsea and his side dominated their hosts in Gelsenkirchen. Chelsea needed less than two minutes to take the lead at Schalke's Veltins Arena. Eden Hazard put Diego Costa away and the Spain striker tested Schalke goalkeeper Ralf Faehrmann, who palmed his shot away. Cesc Fabregas floated in the corner from which Chelsea captain John Terry rose highest to head home barely challenged. Cameroon striker Eric Choupo-Moting gave Schalke brief hope on 13 minutes when his shot deflected off Gary Cahill's boot and looped over Chelsea goalkeeper Thibault Courtois, but clattered off the bar. Chelsea were unpicking the Schalke defence with worryingly ease as they doubled their lead. Hazard timed his pass to Willian perfectly and the Brazilian's low drive shot under Faehrmann's dive on 28 minutes to put the guests 2-0 up. Booes and whistles echoed around the Veltins Arena by the time defensive midfielder Jan Kirchoff turned the ball into his own net on 44 minutes and raised to a noisy crescendo when the referee ended a miserable half moments later. With his side facing eight games in a busy December period, Mourinho replaced Costa, who has netted 11 goals this season, with veteran forward Didier Drogba with an hour gone. He scored their fourth when Fabregas put through a superb pass to Willian, who squared to present Drogba with a simple tap in on 76 minutes. The guests fifth goal followed just two minutes later as Drogba crossed for Ramires, who out jumped the porous home defence. Only good keeping by Fahrmann denied Chelsea replacement Andre Schuerrle, then Hazard, in the final five minutes as the guests hunted a sixth goal. The home side were again booed at the final whistle."
232,23/11/2014,13:51,Di Matteo tagets point against ex-club Chelsea,Schalke 04 coach Roberto di Matteo has targeted taking at least a point when the Royal Blues host his former club Chelsea in Tuesday's Champions League clash.,"The sides drew 1-1 at Stamford Bridge in September's opening round of Champions League matches when Dutch striker Klaas-Jan Huntelaar equalised in the second-half after Cesc Fabregas had given the hosts an early lead. Jose Mourinho's Chelsea hold a three-point lead at the top of Group G with second-placed Schalke on course to join them in the knock-out stage. Both sides warmed up for the Gelsenkirchen clash with victories on Saturday as Chelsea romped to a 2-0 home win over West Bromwich Albion in the Premier League while Schalke posted an impressive 3-2 win over Wolfsburg which ended Wolves eight-match winning streak. ""Wins always do the self-confidence a bit of good and we'll take a lot of positives from the game and see where we can improve,"" said Matteo, who has won all four home matches since taking charge last month. ""Chelsea also played and they are in the same position as us in terms of recovery. ""We have the Champions League game on Tuesday where everything is still open and anything can happen, but we want to take at least a point from the home game."" The Schalke job is Di Matteo's first since being sacked by Chelsea in November 2012 despite having steered them to the Champions League title that May after beating Bayern Munich on a penalty shoot-out in the Bavarian capital. But Di Matteo insists his emotions will be under control for the Gelsenkirchen clash. ""For me personally, I'll just concentrate on my work of trying to win the game with Schalke,"" he insisted."
233,21/11/2014,12:46,Di Matteo's Schalke hunt Wolves in Chelsea warm-up,Roberto di Matteo's Schalke hope to end Wolfsburg's eight-match winning streak in the Bundesliga on Saturday in their final warm-up before hosting his former club Chelsea in the Champions League.,"Second-placed Wolves are unbeaten in their last 10 games and are targeting a seventh straight Bundesliga win at Schalke's Veltins Arena with the Royal Blues 11th in the table. Di Matteo has so far refused point blank to talk about Chelsea, who sacked him in November 2012 just six months after he had steered them to the Champions League title as caretaker coach. Schalke are second in their Champions League group, three points behind leaders Chelsea, having earned a goalless draw at Stamford Bridge in September and host Jose Mourinho's side on Tuesday. The 44-year-old Di Matteo has won all three of his home games since taking charge last month, but Wolves is his biggest test and his side are just one place higher in the league than when he took charge. ""I don't know if there's a favourite for this game, but for sure we're the home team and we've got to take the initiative,"" said Di Matteo. ""Wolfsburg has a very good record and they have a lot of quality in their squad, which is well balanced. ""They have a stable defence, conceded few goals and are very good on the counter-attack."" Di Matteo will be without suspended defender Denis Aogo, forward Jefferson Farfan is out with a knee cartilage problem while midfielder Julian Draxler and defender Sead Kolasinac are on the long-term injured list. He has potential problems looming in January as both Cameroon internationals Eric Choupo-Moting and Joel Matip will be involved with the Africa Cup of Nations (from January 17-February 8). Japan defender Atsuto Uchida is also set to miss most of Schalke's winter training camp because of January's Asian Cup, hosted by Australia, before the Bundesliga resumes on January 30."
234,03/11/2014,19:56,Torn hamstring rules Draxler out until 2015,Schalke 04 will be without German World Cup winning midfielder Julian Draxler until next year as it was announced on Monday he needs an operation on a torn hamstring.,"The 21-year-old suffered the injury in Schalke's 1-0 Bundesliga win over Augsburg last Friday. Germany's team doctor Hans-Wilhelm Mueller-Wohlfahrt diagnosed the injury and among the matches Draxler will miss are Wednesday's Champions League match against Sporting Lisbon, the Euro 2016 qualifier against Gibraltar next week and a friendly against Spain. Schalke director of sport Horst Heldt has confirmed he will not play again until after January's winter break. The Royal Blues are hoping to have Ghana midfielder Kevin-Prince Boateng back from an ankle injury for their Champions League clash in Lisbon which pits second in the group Schalke against the tailenders Sporting. The 27-year-old attacking midfielder took part in Monday's training session having missed the last two Bundesliga games and may feature in the game. Schalke will also definitely be without Cameroon defender Joel Matip, who misses the match with a bruised foot."

237,31/10/2014,22:56,Schalke up to seventh as Di Matteo wins again,Schalke 04 moved up to seventh in the Bundesliga as new coach Roberto di Matteo picked up his third win in four games with Friday's 1-0 victory over Augsburg.,Netherlands striker Klaas-Jan Huntelaar scored the 37th-minute winner in Gelsenkirchen. Ex-Chelsea boss Di Matteo has moved Schalke up from 12th when taking charge three weeks ago. But the win barely masked Schalke's poor performance as the hosts were out-played for long periods at the Veltins Arena by mid-table Augsburg. Huntelaar scored his seventh goal of the season in all competitions after Japan defender Atsuto Uchida won possession in his own half and fed the Dutch striker after a superb piece of play. The victory may have come at a heavy price ahead of Wednesday's trip to Sporting Lisbon in the Champions League after Schalke's Germany midfielder Julian Draxler went off with a thigh injury after only four minutes.
238,30/10/2014,17:17,Schnitzel-fan Uchida extends Schalke stay,"Japan defender Atsuto Uchida has extended his Schalke 04 contract until 2018, his Bundesliga club announced Thursday, and revealed some of the cultural differences he has encountered in Germany.","The 26-year-old, who played for Japan at the 2010 and 2014 World Cup finals, has penned a new contract to keep him in Gelsenkirchen until June 2018. ""It's good news for us and all our fans in Japan will be especially pleased,"" said sporting director Horst Heldt with the number of Schalke fans having swollen in the Far East since Uchida's arrival in 2010. ""We have achieved our goal of binding another player to the club who is extremely reliable and has played consistently at a high level."" The right-back joined Schalke from J-League side Kashima Antlers and has played 132 matches, making 90 Bundesliga appearances. ""Schalke 04 is a special club with wonderful fans and I want to thank them for their confidence in me with good performances,"" he told Schalke04.de. Uchida says German cuisine, the fan culture and his nickname here took some getting used to. ""The first time I went to be tested for doping, there was a bottle of beer waiting for me, that's when I knew I was in Germany,"" he told football magazine 11Freunde. ""Nutrition is a big thing for me and I have learnt that curry wurst, chips and beer all go together when watching football in Germany. ""I like schnitzel, but I have to say I find German food quite fatty. ""Luckily there is a Japanese community in Duesseldorf and the restaurants aren't so far from Gelsenkirchen. ""I go there once a week and at the end of the day, I mostly eat only Japanese food when I am not with the team."" Uchida has said the passion of German football fans won him over. ""At my old club in Japan, there are fans who sing behind the goals and fire up the team, but in Schalke the whole stadium joins in,"" he said. The Japanese also revealed his German nickname 'Uschi' caused him a few problems when he first arrived. ""What most Germans perhaps don't realise is that there is a funny double-meaning for my nickname 'Uschi' - it sounds almost like the Japanese word for 'cattle',"" he explained. ""It doesn't matter to me when Germans use it, but I'm not such a fan when I hear it from Japanese supporters."""
239,28/10/2014,19:03,Sporting's Champions League appeal fails,Portuguese side Sporting Lisbon on Tuesday failed in their protest to UEFA over last week's controversial 4-3 Champions League loss to German outfit Schalke 04.,"Sporting were disputing the last minute penalty awarded to Schalke, and other refereeing decisions in the October 21 Group G tie. They had called on European football's governing body to either award a draw, or order a replay. They argued that their Argentine defender Jonathan Silva did not handle the ball which resulted in the 90th minute spot-kick awarded by Russian referee Sergei Karasev. They suggested the ball came off the player's head. Sporting played with 10 men from the 33rd minute after Mauricio was sent-off. Sporting are bottom of Group G after three games with just one point, six behind leaders Chelsea and four back from Schalke."
240,22/10/2014,02:15,Di Matteo unimpressed by Schalke's late win,Roberto di Matteo admitted Schalke 04 rode their luck as their dramatic 4-3 Champions League win over 10-man Sporting Lisbon on Tuesday was settled by a dubious penalty.,"Sporting were denied a Group G point in Gelsenkirchen when Schalke substitute Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting converted a controversial 93rd-minute penalty. Replays showed Russian referee Sergey Karasev was wrong to award Schalke the decisive spot-kick as the ball struck defender Jonathan Silva in the face from a Klaas-Jan Huntelaar header. It was a fortuitous let-off for Schalke who had seen their 3-1 lead eroded after Sporting's Adrien Silva scored two second-half goals to level with 12 minutes left before the late controversy. ""The spectators probably had more fun watching that than the coach, but it was an important win,"" admitted di Matteo after what was just his second game in charge of the Royal Blues. ""When you lead 3-1, you must control the game better than that and we made silly mistakes. ""But it was a win and that was our aim."" But he admitted Schalke could consider themselves lucky for the penalty which sealed their first win of their European campaign. ""It looked like the ball hit the defender's face for the penalty, but it's three points and we need three more on Saturday,"" he said before Schalke's next Bundesliga game against Bayer Leverkusen. The win leaves Schalke second in the Group G table, two points behind leaders Chelsea with Sporting bottom ahead of the return leg in Lisbon in a fortnight. Sporting's coach Marco Silva was furious at both Karasev's penalty decision and the first-half dismissal of centre-back Mauricio. ""What happened is not normal. It is a tremendous injustice. I don't feel like saying anything else about it,"" he fumed. ""There are two completely different games - one before and one after the sending off."" Di Matteo coached Chelsea to glory in the 2012 Champions League during his eight-month reign at Stamford Bridge, and he faces his old side in Gelsenkirchen on November 25 in a Group G showdown. Schalke held the London side to a 1-1 draw at Stamford Bridge last month when Jens Keller was still in charge. However, Keller has since been replaced by the 44-year-old former Italy international, who has had a galvanising effect on the team as they have won both their games in his first fortnight in charge. Sporting took an early lead on the night through Nani, then had centre-back Mauricio sent off for a second yellow card with just over half an hour gone before Schalke eased into a 3-1 lead. Nigeria's Chinedu Obasi, Huntelaar and Schalke captain Benedikt Hoewedes all hit the back of the net before Sporting fought back, only to be denied at the final whistle. ""Only the three points count, but to be honest, there was a lot of luck,"" admitted Hoewedes. ""Seconds before the end it didn't look like this could be a great evening, but we never gave up."""
241,21/10/2014,23:14,Late penalty gifts Schalke win over Sporting,Roberto di Matteo's Schalke 04 enjoyed a dramatic 4-3 win over 10-man Sporting Lisbon on Tuesday after a dubious penalty in time added on settled their Champions League clash.,"Sporting had earlier fought back from two-goals down as Adrien Silva scored a double in the second-half to put the visitors on level terms with just 12 minutes remaining. But Sporting were denied a point when Schalke substitute Eric Choupo-Moting converted a controversial 93rd-minute penalty. Replays showed Sporting's furious protests were justified as the ball struck defender Jonathan Silva in the face from a Klaas-Jan Huntelaar header. But Russian referee Sergey Karasev judged it came off his upper arm and pointed to the spot. Di Matteo, who coached Chelsea to the 2012 Champions League title and who ironically are in the dame group this time round, has had a galvanising effect on the team as they made it two wins from two under the 44-year-old. The win -- their first in this season's competition -- leaves Schalke second in the table, two points behind leaders Chelsea with Sporting bottom ahead of the return leg in Lisbon in a fortnight. Sporting took an early lead through Nani, then had centre-back Mauricio sent off with just over half an hour gone before Schalke eased into a 3-1 lead. Nigeria's Chinedu Obasi, Huntelaar and Schalke captain Benedikt Hoewedes all hit the back of the net before Sporting fought back, only to be denied at the final whistle. Sporting made a positive start and took the lead when Nani slammed home his shot, which took a deflection off Huntelaar and Schalke's goalkeeper Ralf Faehrmann on it's way into the net with just 16 minutes gone. The game swung in Schalke's favour when Sporting's Brazilian centre-back Mauricio was sent off for a second yellow card -- for a clumsy challenge on Marco Hoeger -- with just 33 minutes gone. Schalke drew level barely a minute later when Dennis Aogo's free-kick was headed home by Obasi. Sporting's goalkeeper Rui Patricio looked to have saved the shot, but the ball span back over his body to leave the sides level at the break. Ghana midfielder Kevin-Prince Boateng failed to come out after the break having aggrevated an ankle injury, but Schalke wasted no time in scoring twice in the first 15 minutes of the second-half. Huntelaar made it 2-1 when he darted onto Obasi's final pass and fired his shot into the far corner and away from the despairing Patricio on 51 minutes. Then Germany defender Hoewedes made it 3-1 when the Schalke captain rose highest to a corner and blasted his header home from six metres out with an hour gone. Sporting pulled a goal back on 64 minutes when Silva converted a penalty after Andre Carillo was fouled by Schalke's centre-back Kaan Ayhan. The visitors levelled when Silva was left unmarked at the far post and he headed home but the hosts were to dash their hopes of a deserved point right at the death."
242,20/10/2014,17:36,Schalke's Di Matteo looks to shut down Sporting,Roberto Di Matteo makes his Champions League debut as Schalke coach on Tuesday with the ex-Chelsea boss urging the Royal Blues to keep visitors Sporting Lisbon bottom of Group G.,"The 44-year-old Di Matteo kicked off his fledgling Schalke career with a 2-0 win over Hertha Berlin on Saturday as striker Klaas-Jan Huntelaar and midfielder Julian Draxler hit the target and helped lift the side to eighth in the Bundesliga. Having won the 2012 Champions League during his eight-month reign at Chelsea, Di Matteo makes his Royal Blues' bow in Europe and says they must take the initiative at home to Sporting with Schalke second in the group behind leaders Chelsea. ""I think it doesn't look too bad (in the group), there is everything still to play for,"" said Di Matteo, whose side drew at Chelsea and at home to Maribor in their opening European games. ""When you have a home game, you have to take the initiative. ""The moral after the win is very good, but they (Sporting) are a technically good team, who like to keep the ball. ""We mustn't let them get into the game."" Sporting coach Marco Silva has made just one change to his squad after Saturday's 3-1 Portuguese Cup win at Porto with forward Heldon Ramos coming in for defender Miguel Lopes, who is cup-tied. Di Matteo will have both defender Joel Matip available, after the Cameroon star missed the Hertha match with suspension, while winger Sidney Sam is back after a leg injury, but squad rotation could still be a factor. ""When you have two games per week, you need to use the complete squad and share around the workload,"" said Di Matteo. Huntelaar has said Schalke will score goals against Sporting, who have just a point from their two games, and that confidence is flowing back through the squad after beating Hertha. ""We'll score goals, we have got some of our self-confidence back after the Hertha victory and we need to continue that,"" said the Netherlands star. ""The days are easier when you win than when you lose, that's obvious. There are things we need to improve from, but it was a good start and a good performance. It's important that we're solid as a team."""
243,20/10/2014,02:15,Di Matteo hunts second win as Schalke host Sporting,Schalke's coach Roberto Di Matteo is looking to pick up the second win of his fledgling Royal Blues' career when they host Sporting Lisbon in the Champions League on Tuesday.,"The 44-year-old, who led Chelsea to the premier European club title in 2012 during his eight-month reign at Stamford Bridge, enjoyed a 2-0 win over Hertha Berlin on his Bundesliga debut on Saturday. The ex-Italy midfielder took charge a fortnight ago after Schalke sacked Jens Keller following a poor start to the season which left them 11th in the table. Having earned a point from their 1-1 draw at Group G leaders Chelsea in September, Schalke are second to the Premier League side with two points compared to Chelsea's four. Di Matteo's Schalke host Chelsea in Gelsenkirchen on November 25, but for now the new Royal Blues' boss is concentrating on bottom side Sporting at the Veltins Arena. ""Our focus is now on Sporting Lisbon. We want to have a good and successful game in the Champions League,"" said Di Matteo. The Swiss-born Italian acknowledges his side still lack self-confidence despite moving up to eighth after picking up only their third league win of the season. They need points to keep pressure on Jose Mourinho's Chelsea in the forthcoming home-and-away series against Sporting with the teams to meet again in Lisbon on November 5. ""We can still improve our organisation and the self-confidence will grow if we pick up a win or two,"" added Di Matteo. Netherlands striker Klaas-Jan Huntelaar, who equalised for Schalke both at Stamford Bridge and in their 1-1 draw at home to Slovenia's Maribor last month, is impressed with the new coach. ""He knows what he wants. He shows us exactly what he wants in terms of tactics,"" said the Dutch star. 'The Hunter' netted Schalke's opening goal with a superb header against Hertha before Germany midfielder Julian Draxler made sure of the win with a second-half strike. Schalke's Cameroon forward Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting says the Royal Blues still have much to improve on against Sporting. ""Of course we can play better football, I am sure we will do that in the next few weeks,"" said the 25-year-old. ""In the next few games we need to work on not losing the ball so much when going forward."" Having lost 1-0 at home to Chelsea and drawn 1-1 at Maribor, Marco Silva's Sporting need a result in Gelsenkirchen to breath life back into their European campaign. Sporting warmed-up for their trip to Germany with a 3-1 win over former Champions League winners Porto on Saturday in the third round of the Portuguese Cup. Sporting's star forward Nani put them 2-1 up at the break after Porto's Ivan Marcano scored an own goal before Peru's Andre Carrillo sealed the win with an 83rd-minute strike for the visitors."
244,18/10/2014,21:12,Di Matteo enjoys winning start at Schalke,Roberto di Matteo enjoyed a winning start as Schalke 04 coach on Saturday as his Royal Blues earned a 2-0 victory at home to Hertha Berlin in the Bundesliga.,"The 44-year-old, who won the 2012 Champions League title with Chelsea, signed a three-year contract when he took over as Schalke coach after predecessor Jens Keller was sacked a fortnight ago. Netherlands striker Klaas-Jan Huntelaar gave Schalke the lead against Hertha in Gelsenkirchen with a long-range header on 19 minutes before Germany midfielder Julian Draxler grabbed their second with a well-taken goal on 65 minutes. The result lifts Schalke up to eighth from 11th in the Bundesliga. ""The atmosphere was great, the game wasn't spectacular, but it was important for us to get three points,"" said Di Matteo. ""It was very pleasing that we didn't concede a goal. We were very committed and organised, we had two good chances in the first-half, but there is still work to do. ""We need to keep working on our organisation and the goal now is just to win as many games as possible."" Schalke host Sporting Lisbon in the Champions League on Tuesday and will play Group G leaders Chelsea in Gelsenkirchen on November 25. The ex-Azzurri midfielder is the third Italian coach to work in the Bundesliga after Giovanni Trapattoni, who worked at Bayern Munich, and Nevio Scala, the former Borussia Dortmund boss."
245,17/10/2014,01:55,Di Matteo begins Schalke reign,Roberto di Matteo begins his reign as Schalke 04's coach on Saturday by attempting to turn around the Royal Blues' fortunes when they host Hertha Berlin in the Bundesliga.,"Despite having qualified for the Champions League, Schalke are 11th in the table and brought in former Azzurri star di Matteo to replace the sacked Jens Keller. Keller's 22-month tenure ended last week after his side took eight points from their first seven games and their 2-0 defeat to Hoffenheim was the final straw. Having won the Champions League title with Chelsea in 2012, di Matteo has trained Schalke behind closed doors and wants a good start against Hertha, who are 12th in the table. ""We want to play a well-organised game in defence and attack,"" said Di Matteo. ""We have a lot of attacking potential, but we have to improve our organisation. ""I am really looking foward to the game, the stadium is amazing and the atmosphere will be unbelievable but it's important to get a good start after the international break."" The 44-year-old has two home games in quick succession as Schalke host Sporting Lisbon in their Champions League group on Tuesday with Schalke are third in the table. Di Matteo has set the goal of progressing to the knock-out stage in Europe and finishing in the Bundesliga's top three to guarantee their Champions League place next season. The Swiss-born Italian says there are ""no miracles in football"" but he is Schalke's fifth coach in five years and is under pressure to get results quickly. At the top of the table, Bayern Munich are out to add to their four-point lead when they host bottom side Werder Bremen at the Allianz Arena on Saturday. Bremen have taken heavy beatings at the hands of the Bavarians in their last three games having been trounced 5-2 in Munich last April and 7-0 in Bremen last December. They have leaked 15 goals in their last three visits to Munich. Bayern had some bad news in mid-week as Spain midfielder Thiago Alcantara faces a fresh operation after re-injuring the medial ligament in his right knee. Even with the likes of Bastian Schweinsteiger, Franck Ribery and Javi Martinez on the long-term injury list, Bayern coach Pep Guardiola has plenty of strength in depth. Poland striker Robert Lewandowski and Netherlands winger Arjen Robben both scored two goals each as the Bavarians trounced Hanover 96 4-0 in Munich two weeks ago. The result left Bayern four points clear and they are hunting a fifth-straight win before next week's Champions League trip to play AS Roma away. In contrast, Borussia Dortmund badly need to get their Bundesliga campaign back on track when they play Cologne away on Saturday with Jurgen Klopp demanding a fresh start from his squad. ""For us, the rest of the season starts now,"" he said in Thursday's press conference. Dortmund have won both of their opening Champions League matches to top their group, but their Bundesliga form has deserted them. They are winless in their last four league matches to drop to 13th -- their worst start to the domestic season for five years -- and need a booster before playing Galatasaray away on Wednesday in Europe. ""We clearly have too few points and not enough positive results, everyone is hoping the boys will give 100 percent on the pitch,"" said Klopp. ""But we mustn't believe that we'll automatically win every game now."" Germany midfielders Marco Reus and Ilkay Gundogan, plus Arminia's Henrikh Mkhitaryan are working their way back to fitness with Gundogan having last played for Dortmund 14 months ago after a back injury. ""It looks really good, they are all available and it looks like they will all be able to play again soon,"" added Klopp."
246,08/10/2014,21:32,Lewandowski looking forward to to facing world champions,Poland striker Robert Lewandowski says he is relishing taking on world champions Germany in Warsaw this Saturday in a Euro 2016 qualifier which pits him against several of his Bayern Munich team-mates.,"The 26-year-old hot-shot, who was the top scorer in the Bundesliga last season, will lead Poland's attack against Joachim Loew's Germany at the National Stadium in a key game in Group D. ""Maybe they will be too confident after winning the World Cup. Maybe they will oversleep a little and we will be able to take advantage. I hope so,"" said Lewandowski in quotes reported by UEFA.com. ""We know their qualities, but we will not park a bus in our penalty area."" Poland started their campaign last month with a resounding 7-0 win against minnows Gibraltar, in which Lewandowski scored four times, while the Germans enjoyed a nervy 2-1 win at home to Scotland. Lewandowski will come up against several of his Bayern colleagues, including goalkeeper Manuel Neuer, who will captain the world champions with Bastian Schweinsteiger injured. ""I have good memories of my many games against Manuel,"" said Lewandowski, previously of Borussia Dortmund. ""I remember only too well that I scored my first Bundesliga goal against Schalke, with Neuer between the posts. ""I gave an interview to German television and they asked me a lot about it, but it is Poland v Germany and I would be equally happy if any of my team-mates scored. It does not have to be me. ""Will this match be special for me? I would not say special as such, just different. ""I know most of Germany's players - I played with some at Dortmund and now I play with some more at Bayern. ""Of course, we joked a little bit about the game and they admitted, jokingly, they would happily accept a draw in Warsaw."" Neuer said watching Lewandowski train on a daily basis at Bayern, after he joined from Borussia Dortmund in the summer, will work to his advantage. ""I have got to know his game better by having trained so often with him,"" said Neuer at a press conference in Frankfurt. ""I know where he likes to get the ball, he's one of the best strikers in the world, so you have to watch his every move."""
247,08/10/2014,21:28,Di Matteo out to shore up shaky Schalke,Schalke's new coach Roberto Di Matteo said Wednesday his priority is to improve the Royal Blues' defence as he sets his sights on a Champions League showdown with his ex-club Chelsea.,"The 44-year-old was officially unveiled in Gelsenkirchen as Schalke's coach with his new team 11th in the Bundesliga and low on confidence after just two wins in 10 games this season. The Swiss-born Italian will take charge of his first training session on Thursday and his first match as coach is at home to Hertha Berlin on October 18. Di Matteo says his goals are to qualify for the Champions League knock-out phase and to secure their place in next season's competition by finishing in the top three in the Bundesliga. ""It's a good team, which has a lot of potential going forward, but it has some problems in defence,"" said Di Matteo, who has replaced fired predecessor Jens Keller. ""We have to work on our defensive organisation and I have a lot of work ahead of me."" Di Matteo is Schalke's eighth coach in six years and he knows the importance of stamping his authority on the team. ""There is only one boss in the dressing room,"" he told reporters. ""We have to work on getting more organised and work on the players' confidence. There is no miracle cure, we need patience and time."" There will be plenty of attention for his showdown at home against his former club on November 25 in the Champions League, although Di Matteo, who steered Chelsea to European Cup glory in 2012, did not want to be drawn on it. ""I have only been here 24 hours and there are a lot of games to come before that one,"" said the ex-Lazio star. Schalke sit second to Chelsea in Group G after drawing their first two Champions League games, including a 1-1 stalemate at Stamford Bridge. Di Matteo even took some tips from Germany coach Joachim Loew before taking the Schalke job, his first coaching appointment since being sacked by Chelsea in November 2012. ""I have been friends with Jogi for years,"" he revealed. ""I managed to get a lot of information from him, so that I was well prepared."" Whether Di Matteo, whose assistant will be Attilio Lombardo, will sign any new players in January remains to be seen. ""We have enough time until the next transfer window to be able to get a good picture of what we have,"" said Schalke's director of sport Horst Heldt."
248,08/10/2014,21:23,Germany's Arsenal star Ozil out for 12 weeks,"Mesut Ozil will miss Germany's Euro 2016 qualifier against Poland on Saturday and faces up to 12 weeks out with a knee injury, the German Football Association (DFB) confirmed Wednesday.","The 25-year-old Arsenal star complained of pain in his left knee and was flown to Munich on Wednesday morning to be treated by the DFB's doctor, who diagnosed a partial tear of the left cruciate knee ligament. Ozil will miss the Group D qualifiers in Warsaw and against the Republic of Ireland in Gelsenkirchen next Tuesday. He also misses a qualifier against minnows Gibraltar in Nuremberg on November 14, plus a friendly against European champions Spain on November 18. Ozil is also added to Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger's mounting injury list and will miss the rest of the Gunners' Champions League group stage matches, including the key Group D showdown at home to Borussia Dortmund on November 26. Germany coach Joachim Loew is already missing several stars for the trip to Warsaw with captain Bastian Schweinsteiger, Sami Khedira, Benedikt Hoewedes, Marco Reus and Mario Gomez all injured while midfielder Julian Draxler has the flu. Chelsea forward Andre Schuerrle also missed training on Wednesday with a muscular problem, but is expected to be fit. ""Things look good for Andre, he received some treatment on Tuesday, so it's normal that he sat out training the day after,"" said team manager Oliver Bierhoff. Draxler, of Schalke, is expected to join the squad once he recovers from illness. Even without Ozil, Loew has targeted six points from their games against Poland and Ireland to give the Germans control of Group D after they beat Scotland 2-1 in their opening match. Bierhoff said Germany are rebuilding after established stars Philipp Lahm, Per Mertesacker and Miroslav Klose all retired in the wake of their World Cup triumph in Brazil in July. ""We want to win both games and give ourselves a bit of a cushion in the qualifiers,"" added Bierhoff. ""It's going to be a tough October with two difficult games. ""We have to introduce several new players into the squad because of injuries and a few retirements. ""The team will have a different look to how it was two months ago."" With Schweinsteiger injured, Germany will be captained by goalkeeper Manuel Neuer for the next two games. ""These are key games for us, it is important to keep playing well after the win over Scotland,"" said Neuer, of Bayern Munich. Loew is set to hand a first cap to Bayer Leverkusen attacking midfielder Karim Bellarabi, who has opted to play for Germany over Morocco, where his mother was born, on the back of several impressive displays in the Bundesliga."
249,07/10/2014,12:50,Di Matteo takes over as Schalke boss,German club Schalke 04 on Tuesday appointed former Chelsea manager Roberto di Matteo as coach to replace the sacked Jens Keller.,"Di Matteo, who will be presented to the media on Wednesday, has signed a contract through to June 30, 2017 at the Veltins Arena. Keller's fate was sealed by a 2-1 defeat to Hoffenheim on Saturday, which left the Gelsenkirchen club 11th in the Bundesliga with just eight points from seven games. Schalke are also third in their Champions League group after two draws in their first two matches, including a 1-1 stalemate with Chelsea at Stamford Bridge. That impressive result, as well as a 2-1 win against Borussia Dortmund in the recent Ruhr derby, could not save Keller from the axe. ""The team's performances in recent weeks have varied greatly. Even the positive tendencies such as seven points collected from the recent busy league schedule and the icing on the cake that was the derby win haven't shown a lasting effect,"" said sporting director Horst Heldt in a statement on the club website. ""We're lacking the consistency needed in order to achieve our goals. That's why we have decided to take this step. ""By changing the manager, we want to create new momentum,"" added Heldt. ""We're utterly convinced that Roberto di Matteo will stabilise the team and achieve our goals in the Bundesliga and Champions League."" Di Matteo, 44, starred as a player for Italy and Chelsea and as caretaker manager led the London club to their first Champions League title in 2012. He has also managed Premier League club West Bromwich Albion. Keller had taken over at Schalke from Dutchman Huub Stevens in December 2012. He is the second coach to lose his job in the Bundesliga already this season, after Hamburg parted company with Mirko Slomka."
250,26/09/2014,09:27,Victory needed by both Schalke and Dortmund in derby,Bayern Munich are right where they want to be atop the Bundesliga after five rounds and ahead of a tough showdown against Cologne this weekend while Schalke and Borussia Dortmund both head into the 145th derby needing a victory.,"Munich head to Cologne on Saturday to face a team which had not conceded a goal in their first four games this season until Hanover scored in the midweek round of games. Bayern are happy about where they are, knowing that the weekend/midweek rhythm is just starting with a match-up against CSKA Moscow coming in the Champions League next week. ""I think we can be satisfied after the first five games. We've picked up 11 out of a possible 15 points, three wins and two draws - that's okay,"" said Munich board chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge after the team's 4-0 victory over the previous surprise leaders SC Paderborn. ""Some people expected a bumpy start after the World Cup. We can be very satisfied with the season to date including the Champions League."" Bayern winger Arjen Robben said the win over Paderborn was important but the Cologne game matched that in their bid to stay atop the Bundesliga. ""It was really important for us to win and lay down a marker. That's what we're aiming for, where we want to be and - much more important - we want to stay there,"" said Robben. The top two challengers at the moment - Bayer Leverkusen and Hanover 96 - both have 10 points and play at teams who have not yet won this season in SC Freiburg and VfB Stuttgart respectively. Stuttgart sit second-to-last with two points after failing to hold a 2-0 lead at Dortmund in a 2-2 draw midweek. Stuttgart's troubles - they had scored just one goal going into the Dortmund match - resulted in the sacking of sporting director Fredi Bobic. ""In the end, we probably have to consider ourselves somewhat fortunate to be taking a point. With this performance, we have certainly taken a step in the right direction,"" said Daniel Didavi, who scored both goals against Dortmund. The Yellow-Blacks actually could have beaten Stuttgart but had a shot blocked at the line in stoppage time. In general, though, Dortmund know they cannot give up two goals every game. ""We need more stability in defence. We have already conceded nine goals in five matches which is not just a poor record, it is a very poor record,"" said captain Mats Hummels, who came on in the second half for his first action this season. ""We need to defend better as a team, and all eleven players have to play their part. If you concede two goals in each game, as has already happened four times this season, it's very hard to win."" And Dortmund need to win, having already dropped four points behind Bayern and three behind Leverkusen and Hanover. Schalke come into the match having finally won their first competitive match of the season - a 3-0 beating of Werder Bremen. The Royal Blues have won just one of the last four derbies at home against Dortmund. Manager Jens Keller knows his team will be well served to put together a string of victories to move back up the table. And Dortmund are a perfect opponent for that. ""We don't need to motivate the players for this match. It's the biggest derby in Germany. We are all excited for the match,"" said Keller, whose team has five points in 13th place.

251,22/09/2014,13:53,Draxler handed two-match ban after red card,Schalke's international midfielder Julian Draxler has been hit with a two-match ban after being sent off in the 2-2 draw against Eintracht Frankfurt over the weekend.,"The 21-year-old, who was part of Germany's triumphant World Cup squad in Brazil, was found guilty of violent conduct when he clashed with Frankfurt's Carlos Zambrano in Saturday's game. The player and club have said they will not appeal the ban which was handed down by the German football federation (DFB). Schalke have picked up two points from four matches this season and lie third from bottom in the Bundesliga as they head to Werder Bremen on Tuesday looking for their first victory of the young campaign."
252,17/09/2014,23:12,Chelsea frustrated as Huntelaar earns a point,Chelsea made a spluttering start to their Champions League campaign as Klaas-Jan Huntelaar's second-half equaliser earned Schalke a surprise 1-1 draw at Stamford Bridge on Wednesday.,"Jose Mourinho's side had been in dominant mood in the early weeks of the season and they looked well in control of their Group G opener after an early strike from Spain midfielder Cesc Fabregas. But Fabregas's first goal for Chelsea since his £27 million ($44 million) pre-season move from Barcelona was the prelude to a frustrating evening for the Blues, who wasted a string of chances to finish off Schalke and were made to pay when Huntelaar fired home to give the Germans the point their perseverance deserved. The Premier League leaders will still expect to qualify from a group also including Sporting Lisbon and Maribor, but this was hardly the kind of ruthless performance required to go one step further than last season's semi-final appearance. ""I'm frustrated because we had very good chances to make it 2-0 and after the 1-1 we had a fantastic reaction and had more chances to win the game,"" Mourinho said. ""Schalke fought hard and congratulations to them. It's a good point for them and a point for us, but not a fantastic point."" Schalke manager Jens Keller by contrast was ecstatic with his side's performance. ""I'm very proud of what we did against such a top team. Our plan went perfectly. ""It's possible they underestimated us, but my team produced a really good tactical performance."" Fuelled by the predatory finishing of Spain striker Diego Costa, who has scored seven times in four matches since arriving from Atletico Madrid, Mourinho's men had reeled off four successive victories. But despite Costa's impressive form, Mourinho opted to rest the Brazil-born star and handed Didier Drogba his first start since his return to the Bridge. Chelsea defeated Schalke both home and away in the Champions League group stage last season and it wasn't long before Keller's men were in trouble again as the Blues took the lead in controversial fashion in the 11th minute. Stretching to win possession, Fabregas lunged in on Max Meyer, missing the ball and leaving the Schalke midfielder writhing in agony. With furious Schalke players appealing for the foul, Croatian referee Ivan Bebek instead waved play on and Fabregas sprinted to receive a clever back-flicked pass from Eden Hazard in the area before guiding a cool finish past Ralf Faehrmann. Fabregas should have doubled Chelsea's lead before half-time when he lofted a pass to Branislav Ivanovic and surged onto the return ball, only to miscue his left-footed shot over the bar. Schalke gradually came into the match and Ghana midfielder Kevin-Prince Boateng lashed in a fierce long-range effort that brought a fine save from Thibaut Courtois. The visitors came even closer to equalising on the stroke of half-time when Julian Draxler's impressive acceleration took him past Ivanovic and Gary Cahill and into the area where he drilled a low shot just past the far post with only Courtois to beat. Ivanovic was denied by Faehrmann from an acute angle as the hosts pressed for the killer second goal after the interval. There was more frustration for Chelsea when Drogba muscled his way into a dangerous position from Hazard's pass, but then clipped his shot wide. And Schalke made Mourinho's side pay for their profligacy in the 62nd minute. In a reversal of Chelsea's goal, Fabregas was dispossessed after a possible foul from Huntelaar, whose pass released Draxler to launch a rapid counter-attack that ended with Dutch striker Huntelaar planting a clinical low strike past Courtois to stun the Bridge into silence. Mourinho called for the cavalry, sending on Costa and Loic Remy for the final 18 minutes. Remy went close to bagging the winner, but the France striker's shot was headed off the line by Roman Neustaedter. That set the stage for a tense finale as Chelsea poured forward, but Hazard shot over and then saw his poked effort blocked by Faehrmann."
253,23/08/2014,17:44,Schalke's nightmare start continues,Schalke 04's nightmare start to the new German season continued on Saturday as they fell to a 2-1 defeat at Hanover.,"The visitors were dumped out of the German Cup by third division Dynamo Dresden on Monday but Klaas Jan-Huntelaar's goal looked set to give them victory on the opening weekend of the Bundesliga. Last season the Dutch striker's 12 goals helped Schalke finish third and he opened his account for the new campaign 90 seconds into the second half. But the home side levelled 20 minutes later, when Leonardo Bittencourt surged down the right and picked out Edgar Prib. Two minutes later Hanover got what proved the winning goal. Summer signing Joselu tried his luck from outside the box and the former Hoffenheim striker's shot took a slight deflection before nestling in the corner. Elsewhere, Thomas Schaaf enjoyed his return to the Bundesliga as his Eintracht Frankfurt side beat visiting Freiburg 1-0. Schaaf had taken a year out of football after spending 14 years at Werder Bremen and an early strike from Haris Seferovic gave him plenty to smile about. After 15 minutes, the ball broke kindly for the Swiss striker inside the box and the 3.2 million euro summer signing from Real Sociedad slotted home the only goal. Julian Schieber scored twice on his Hertha Berlin debut but the home side were held to a 2-2 draw against Werder Bremen. Former Borussia Dortmund forward Schieber headed home a cross from another new signing, Dutch winger Roy Beerens, to give Hertha the lead after 16 minutes. Hertha continued to create chances and deservedly doubled their lead when a cross deflected into Schieber's path on 47 minutes. Assani Lukimya gave the visitors hope at the other end when he bundled home from a free-kick on 53 minutes and two minutes later Franco di Santo hauled Werder level. Hoffenheim also scored two goals in three minutes as they beat Augsburg 2-0. The home team took the lead after 33 minutes after a scramble ensued when Augsburg goalkeeper Marvin Hitz failed to hold Roberto Firmino's cross shot. The ball eventually fell to Hungarian striker Adam Szalai, who had a simple finish for his first goal since moving from Schalke in the summer. Two minutes later, Firmino was again involved as Hoffenheim moved further clear. The Brazilian squared for Norway's Tarik Elyounousssi to score as Augsburg, who lost to fourth tier Magdeburg in the German Cup, slumped to another defeat. Meanwhile chances were few and far between as newly-promoted Cologne were held to a scoreless draw at home by big-spending Hamburg. On Friday, goals from Thomas Mueller and Arjen Robben helped defending champions Bayern Munich open with a 2-1 home win over VfL Wolfsburg."
254,19/08/2014,02:05,Germany riding crest of wave as Bundesliga begins,The new Bundesliga season gets underway this weekend with German football riding the crest of a wave following the national team's triumph at the World Cup in Brazil last month.,"That thoroughly deserved victory, given to Joachim Loew's side by Mario Goetze's extra-time strike in the final against Argentina, saw a unified Germany crowned as world champions for the first time. But at club level, the Bundesliga has been leading the way for some time. It averaged 3.16 goals per game last season, considerably more than any of its major European counterparts, while average gates were over 42,000, making the German top flight the best attended league anywhere. ""In my opinion, the Bundesliga's the most attractive league in the world,"" Borussia Moenchengladbach coach Lucien Favre told bundesliga.com. ""The hype in Germany is amazing, and now they've won the World Cup so it's not going to tail off in a rush."" Nevertheless, the biggest problem facing the Bundesliga, as ever, is how to counter the dominance of Bayern Munich, who have romped to the title and added the German Cup in each of the last two campaigns. They have seen Toni Kroos and Mario Mandzukic depart and lost Javi Martinez to a serious knee injury in last week's SuperCup defeat to Borussia Dortmund, but the Bavarians remain favourites. And yet the rest can draw some hope from the very fact this is a Bundesliga season immediately following a World Cup, and that has not tended to help Bayern in the recent past. After Germany hosted the 2006 World Cup, Stuttgart went on to win the Bundesliga, while in 2011 Dortmund pipped Bayern to the title. In 2009, after Germany reached the Euro 2008 final, it was Wolfsburg who were champions. Six members of Pep Guardiola's squad played in the World Cup final, including Goetze, while Dante and Arjen Robben were also involved until the latter stages in Brazil. That is why chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge wanted the start of the new season delayed in order to give these players longer to prepare, but that request was unsurprisingly turned down by Bayern's rivals. ""We have to face the fact that the first half of the season will be difficult,"" said Guardiola, who at times had only a skeleton squad in pre-season training. ""We are at least one month behind schedule."" Guardiola has added to his squad with compatriots Juan Bernat from Valencia and Pepe Reina, who will provide competition in goal for Manuel Neuer. But the marquee signing was Robert Lewandowski, a prolific goalscorer for Dortmund in the last four years. However, Dortmund have moved to replace the Pole by signing Italy striker Ciro Immobile from Torino and Colombia's Adrian Ramos from Hertha Berlin. Stability is key at the Signal Iduna Park, where coach Jurgen Klopp, who led Dortmund to back-to-back titles in 2011 and 2012 and a Champions League final defeat to Bayern in 2013, is entering his seventh season in charge. ""We want to establish ourselves further at the top of the league and qualify directly for the Champions League,"" said sporting director Michael Zorc modestly. However, Guardiola knows where the danger lies, saying: ""We may have won the last two league titles, but they clinched the previous two. Our great challenge is to keep up our level to keep them at distance."" Beneath them, Schalke, Bayer Leverkusen and Wolfsburg will again be hoping to contend for Champions League qualification at least. Schalke have kept Klaas-Jan Huntelaar and Julian Draxler, while Sidney Sam has joined from Leverkusen, and few teams can boast a midfield as strong as Wolfsburg, with Kevin de Bruyne, Luiz Gustavo and France's Josuha Guilavogui. Bayer have signed Swiss striker Josip Drmic from Nuremberg and have a new coach in Roger Schmidt, back in his native country after winning the Austrian title with Salzburg. Hamburg will be hoping for a stable campaign after almost being relegated for the first time in their history last season. There are new coaches at Mainz, Eintracht Frankfurt and Stuttgart, who have reappointed Armin Veh, the architect of their 2007 title triumph, while Cologne are back among the elite and Paderborn are in the Bundesliga for the first time."
255,09/08/2014,21:04,Adebayor on target as Spurs see off Schalke,Togo striker Emmanuel Adebayor was on the scoresheet as Tottenham concluded their preparations for the new Premier League season with a 2-1 friendly win over Schalke on Saturday.,"Adebayor's 29th-minute goal and a 66th-minute effort from much-maligned strike partner Roberto Soldado ensured new Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino enjoyed a winning debut at White Hart Lane following his pre-season move from Southampton. Pochettino, who replaced the sacked Tim Sherwood, arrives with a reputation for producing sides who play entertaining football and there were enough positive moments against Schalke to offer hope of a bright future under the Argentine coach. Ghana midfielder Kevin-Prince Boateng got one back for German side Schalke with 10 minutes remaining, but the north London team held on to secure a morale-boosting victory ahead of next weekend's Premier League opener at local rivals West Ham. At Upton Park, West Ham prepared for that derby showdown with a 3-2 success against Italian team Sampdoria. Youngster Reece Burke got the winner in the last minute to ease the pressure on Sam Allardyce as West Ham finally earned their first pre-season victory. Mo Diame's solo effort had hauled the Hammers level after goals from Stefan Okaka and Citadin Eder sandwiched Mark Noble's penalty. Southampton's miserable pre-season continued with a 1-0 home defeat against German team Bayer Leverkusen. Since the end of last season, Saints fans have seen Adam Lallana, Luke Shaw, Rickie Lambert, Calum Chambers and Dejan Lovren all sold, with new boss Ronald Koeman struggling to find quality replacements. To make matters worse, one of his new signings, striker Graziano Pelle, scored an own goal on his home debut when he deflected a corner past goalkeeper Artur Boruc in the 57th minute. Leicester, promoted as Championship winners, enjoyed a 1-0 win over German outfit Werder Bremen thanks to defender Wes Morgan's seventh minute header. Elsewhere, Burnley, who came up along with Leicester, were 3-1 winners against Italian side Verona, with Matt Taylor, Lukas Jutkiewicz and Ross Wallace scoring for Sean Dyche's club. Swansea, who face Manchester United in their Premier League opener, will need to improve dramatically on their 3-0 home defeat against Spanish team Villarreal. West Bromwich Albion were beaten 3-1 by Porto at the Hawthorns, while Everton lost 3-1 at Paderborn. Aston Villa drew 0-0 with Italian side Parma and QPR lost 1-0 to PAOK Thessaloniki. Crystal Palace shared a goalless draw with Augsburg and Stoke's Mame Biram Diouf scored in a 1-1 draw with Freiburg."

Germany will play the USA, who are coached by ex-Germany boss Jurgen Klinsmann, in Recife on June 26 in their final Group G match. But Jones, who has 43 caps for the USA, says he will be respectful if he scores against Joachim Loew's German side. ""I wouldn't celebrate in any circumstance,"" insisted the Besiktas midfielder, who used to play in the Bundesliga for Schalke 04. ""It's a matter of respect. I have lots to thank Germany and the German Football Association (DFB) for. ""I made my first international appearance for Germany and I am pleased that Loew gave me that chance."" But Jones says he decided to switch nations after being overlooked by Loew for Euro 2008 where Germany lost the final to Spain. ""One of our midfielders, Tim Borowski, had been in bed for a week with sickness, but then Loew decided to take him to the Euros anyway,"" said Jones. ""It was one of the reasons why I decided to play for the USA."" The USA open their Group G campaign against Ghana in Natal on Monday, then face Portugal on June 22 in Manaus."

258,08/06/2014,03:02,Football: Blood not always thicker than water in World Cup,"Kevin-Prince Boateng and Jerome Boateng will be one of several pairs of brothers to line up at the World Cup finals, but unlike the others they will be on opposing sides.","Even more unusually, just as in 2010, they will face each other in the group stage. While Yaya and Kolo Toure from the Ivory Coast and Hondurans Wilson and Jerry Palacios can give each other fraternal advice and morale boosting chats, there will be none of that between the Boateng half-brothers. For Ghanaian forward Kevin-Prince and German defender Jerome -- who made history in 2010 becoming the first brothers to face each other in a World Cup finals -- there is a strict no contact policy before they play each other even in the Bundesliga, where the former turns out for Schalke 04 and the latter for champions Bayern Munich. This will hold true for the brothers -- whose father is Ghanaian but both have German mothers -- till Germany play Ghana in Fortaleza on June 21 in their Group G game. However, at least they arrive at this World Cup on speaking terms. This was not the case back in 2010 when Kevin-Prince, who is the elder at 27 while Jerome is 25, had been vilified in Germany for a tackle on Michael Ballack in the English FA Cup final between his side Portsmouth and Chelsea which ruled the German star out of the finals. That tackle only served to add fuel to the fire in Germany of Kevin-Prince's image, where he was viewed as a wild child who had been in trouble with the police as a youngster, and has several tattoos associated with gangster life on his body. Jerome, though, is fed up with this image of his brother and spoke out last year defending him over that tackle and also of his pride when Kevin-Prince was hailed for leading his then AC Milan team-mates off the pitch in a pre-season friendly when he heard racist abuse from the other team's fans. ""It (the tackle) just happened, and it fitted the mould of a lot of people at that time. The Ghetto kid from the deprived area, the gangster footballer from Wedding (an area of Berlin) and whatever else was published about him,"" he told German newspaper Der Taggespiegel last year. ""But now this -- I am proud of him. It could have ended differently."" While the Boatengs have had their differences, the bond between the Palacios boys, Wilson who is an attacking midfielder with Premier League side Stoke City and Jerry a striker for Costa Rican outfit Alajuelense, has been made even tighter because of their grief over the murder by a kidnap gang of their younger brother Edwin in 2009. ""If either of us scores a goal it would be a very special moment to stay with us for life,"" Wilson told the Stoke Sentinel last month. ""It would mean everything and we would dedicate it to my family and especially my brother Rene (Edwin's middle name), who lives on in our hearts. ""Everything we do is for our little brother in heaven."" The Toures, like the Boatengs, have found their relationship stretched at some point, notably as Yaya's club Manchester City edged the elder Kolo's side Liverpool for the Premier League title last season. However, Yaya, who played with Kolo at City before his elder sibling moved on, says that his respect for his brother knows no bounds. ""You have to understand the relationship we have,"" Toure said in 2011. ""He is my big brother. I have always looked up to him and listened to his advice. He is the wise, strong one. ""When we were younger Kolo was the better player because he was older and had such an appetite for hard work. ""He is a fantastic guy who has always put me first."""
259,13/05/2014,16:28,Football: Goetze dismisses Boateng's Germany dig,"Mario Goetze on Tuesday jumped to the defence of his Germany team after Ghana midfielder Kevin-Prince Boateng described the German squad as ""characterless"" ahead of next month's World Cup clash.","The Germans host Poland in Hamburg on Tuesday in the first of their three friendly warm-ups and Goetze has said Germany deserve their status amongst the World Cup favourites, five weeks before facing Ghana at Brazil 2014. ""We definitely have a good squad, with great players and great ambition, and as a football player you have to be able to deal well with pressure,"" said Bayern Munich's midfielder Goetze. Germany are set to face Ghana in both teams' second Group G match in Fortaleza on June 21 with the World Cup to kick off on June 12. Schalke midfielder Boateng turned up the heat for the showdown on Monday by insisting the Germans lack a strong leader, like former captains Stefan Effenberg or Michael Ballack. ""Germany have a superior team - and that's the problem,"" said Ghana midfielder Boateng, who is set to face his brother Jerome Boateng, a Germany centre-back, in Fortaleza. ""Germany are feeling the pressure to be world champions, but they don't have the characters and types of player to deal with that in Brazil, someone like an Effenberg or a Ballack. ""When the pressure comes on, they (Germany) don't pull through."" After Boateng added that Germany's vice-captain Bastian Schweinsteiger has been short on leadership in the past and ""just wants to play his football in peace"", Goetze said Schweinsteiger's experience speaks for itself. ""Bastian is a seasoned player and has already won many titles,"" Goetze said of the 29-year-old Schweinsteiger, who has just won his seventh Bundesliga title with Bayern Munich and will be appearing at his third World Cup. ""You don't achieve what he has done without special qualities in your game."""
260,12/05/2014,02:35,Football: Experimental Germany kick-off World Cup preparations,Germany begin their final preparations for the World Cup on Tuesday in Hamburg as an experimental side faces neighbours Poland in the first of three friendlies.,"Coach Joachim Loew has included just 10 of the players named in his provisional World Cup squad last week, with the remaining 20 absent due to ongoing club commitments. Seven Bayern Munich players and six from Borussia Dortmund are missing with their clubs meeting in the German Cup final in Berlin next Saturday, while Marcell Jansen is preparing for a relegation play-off with his side Hamburg and six more foreign-based players still have club commitments to honour. Instead, Loew will give a chance to a number of young talents against a Poland side who will themselves be deprived of Dortmund striker Robert Lewandowski. ""The result will not be important,"" declared Loew after announcing a squad featuring the likes of Borussia Moenchengladbach duo Marc-Andre ter Stegen and Christoph Kramer and Eintracht Frankfurt's Sebastian Jung, none of whom will go to Brazil. ""Most of the players are young, have just left school or have just finished their first season in the Bundesliga. ""This is a chance for them to show what they can do and experience the international atmosphere, and why not book their place on the plane to Brazil."" That last message was aimed at others, such as 21-year-old Hoffenheim striker Kevin Volland and Schalke's teenage duo Leon Goretzka and Maximilian Meyer, who have been named in the provisional World Cup squad, to show that they deserve to make the final cut. The squad will be cut to 25 or 26 players on Wednesday before later being reduced to the definitive 23. Volland, who has scored 11 goals and set up nine more this season, appears better-placed than most of the Bundesliga's young talents with Loew lacking back-up in attack to the veteran Lazio striker Miroslav Klose. But Loew added: ""Those who don't make it (to the World Cup), are certainly in our thoughts for 2016 (the European Championship in France) and 2018 (the World Cup in Russia)."" After the game against Poland, who will not go to the World Cup but will face Germany again in Euro 2016 qualifying, the coach will hope to get experienced midfielders Sami Khedira and Bastian Schweinsteiger back to full fitness. Khedira, of Real Madrid, is only just returning from a serious knee injury suffered in November while Bayern's Schweinsteiger hurt himself playing against Stuttgart on the final day of the Bundesliga season on Saturday. The reduced German squad will depart for a training camp in the Italian Alps on May 21 before returning to meet Cameroon in a friendly in Moenchengladbach on June 1. After that game, Loew will name his final 23-man squad, and then there will be one last friendly against Armenia in Mainz on June 6 before Germany head to Brazil. The three-time world champions were drawn in Group G at the World Cup alongside Portugal, Ghana and the United States, who are coached by former Germany star Jurgen Klinsmann."
261,03/05/2014,19:56,Football: Bayern romp deepens Hamburg relegation fears,Mario Goetze netted twice in Bayern Munich's 4-1 win at Hamburg on Saturday which left the hosts facing a nerve-racking final weekend where they could be relegated for the first time.,"As the only team in Germany's top tier to have never been relegated, Hamburg's 20th defeat of the season left them third from bottom on 27 points. That's one point ahead of Nuremberg and two in front of Eintracht Braunschweig with those two sides occupying the automatic relegation places. The best former European champions Hamburg can now hope for is a two-legged relegation play-off against the third-placed side in the second division to preserve their top-flight status. Bayern bounced back from Tuesday's 4-0 defeat to Real Madrid in the Champions League semi-final, second-leg to return to winning ways a fortnight before facing Borussia Dortmund in the German Cup final on May 17. ""It wasn't easy after the Champions League defeat, but the win was important for us for the cup final in Berlin,"" said Bayern coach Pep Guardiola. ""I wish Hamburg the best of luck and hope they reach the play-offs. A club with their history belongs in the Bundesliga."" Bayern needed 32 minutes to take the lead as Goetze squared to Arjen Robben and then tapped home the return pass to put the champions 1-0 up. They doubled their lead when Goetze was left free to fire home Robben's corner on 55 minutes, which went in off colleague Thomas Mueller. Goetze grabbed his second when he slotted home Mueller's pass after Robben's shot was saved by Hamburg keeper Rene Adler. Hamburg pulled a goal back with 20 minutes left through Turkey midfielder Hakan Calhanoglu before Claudio Pizarro grabbed Bayern's fourth. Bayern defender Jerome Boateng was sent off just before the final whistle for striking Kerem Demirbay. The defeat means Hamburg cannot now finish outside the bottom three, the same fate befalling Nuremberg after their 2-0 defeat at home to Hanover 96. Bottom side Eintracht Braunschweig, who lost 1-0 at home to Augsburg thanks to Raul Bobadilla's 94th-minute goal, were already certain of finishing in the bottom three in their first season back in Germany's top flight. As the bottom three are separated by just two points, all that remains to be decided in next weekend's final round of matches is which two go down and who goes into the play-off. Poland striker Robert Lewandowski enjoyed a 3-2 win against Hoffenheim in his final home match for second-placed Borussia Dortmund before joining Bayern next season. Hoffenheim took the lead after just five minutes when Brazilian forward Roberto Firmino beat both Germany defender Mats Hummels and Marcel Schmelzer to drill home his shot. But Dortmund roared back with three goals in five minutes before the break. Germany winger Kevin Grosskreutz slotted in a 29th minute shot, Henrikh Mkhitaryan headed home two minutes later and then Lukasz Piszczek hit their third after a mix up in the Hoffenheim defence from a free-kick. A bad mistake by Dortmund goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller, who allowed a long-range shot from Niklas Suele to fly through his legs, made it 3-2 to the hosts with 66 minutes gone. Ten-man Schalke 04 need just one more point to secure a direct Champions League place next season after their 2-0 win at Freiburg kept them three points clear of Bayer Leverkusen in third as Dutchman Klaas-Jan Huntelaar scored his 59th league goal for the Royal Blues in his 100th Bundesliga game. Leverkusen kept their grip on fourth, and a Champions League play-off place, with a 2-0 win at Eintracht Frankfurt. But both Borussia Moenchengladbach and Wolfsburg can still claim the Bundesliga's fourth Champions League place next season. 'Gladbach's 3-1 win at home to Mainz keeps them sixth, three points from fourth, while Wolfsburg's 2-1 win at VfB Stuttgart, thanks to Ivica Olic's late goal, also keeps them in the hunt for a Champions League spot, a point below Leverkusen."

Bayern needed after 32 minutes to take the lead at Hamburg as Goetze squared to Arjen Robben and then tapped home the return pass to put the champions 1-0 up. The Bavarian giants were recovering from their 4-0 defeat to Real Madrid in the Champions League semi-final, second-leg, but doubled their lead when Goetze was left free to roam and fired home Robben's corner on 55 minutes, which went in off Germany colleague Thomas Mueller. Goetze grabbed his second when he slotted home Mueller's pass after Arjen Robben's shot was saved by Hamburg's Rene Adler. Hamburg pulled a goal back with 20 minutes left through Turkey midfielder Hakan Calhanoglu before Claudio Pizarro grabbed Bayern's fourth. Bayern defender Jerome Boateng was sent off just before the final whistle for striking Kerem Demirbay. Goetze's double states his case to start against his former club Borussia Dortmund in the German Cup final on May 17 having voiced his disgruntlement after starting on the bench against Real. The defeat means Hamburg can not now finish outside the bottom three, the same fate befalling Nuremberg after their 2-0 defeat at home to Hanover 96. Bottom side Eintracht Braunschweig, who lost 1-0 at home to Augsburg thanks to Raul Bobadilla's 94th-minute goal, were already certain of finishing in the bottom three in their first season back in Germany's top flight.

264,03/05/2014,14:25,Football: Germany's Neuer extends Bayern deal until 2019,Germany goalkeeper Manuel Neuer is set to finish his career at Bayern Munich after extending his deal with the Bavarian giants until 2019.,"Having joined Bayern from Schalke 04 in 2011, the 28-year-old Neuer, who has made 45 appearances for Germany, has signed a three-year extension and will be 33 when his new deal expires. ""I feel really well at this club and in this city. This team still has big goals and I am looking forward to the future,"" Neuer wrote on his Facebook page, having been Germany's first-choice goalkeeper since 2010. News of Neuer's extension was revealed by chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge during Friday's extraordinary general meeting, three days after Bayern exited the Champions League with a 4-0 drubbing at home to Real Madrid in their semi-final, second-leg defeat. ""Our goalkeeper Manuel Neuer has today extended his contract to 2019,"" Rummenigge said. ""It is a sign of his wonderful character that he said: 'Bayern forever' and I'd like to thank him for that."" Since joining Bayern three years ago, Neuer has helped Munich lift the 2013 Champions League trophy, won two Bundesliga titles, the German Cup, the German Super Cup, Club World Cup and the UEFA Super Cup. Bayern won this season's Bundesliga title at the end of March with a record seven games to spare."
265,02/05/2014,02:25,Football: Real rout boosts Hamburg's hopes against Bayern,Rafael van der Vaart says Real Madrid's 4-0 drubbing of Bayern Munich in the Champions League will boost relegation-threatened Hamburg against the Bavarian giants in Saturday's Bundesliga clash.,"Hamburg, the only club in Germany's top flight to have never gone down, sit third from bottom in the table and at risk of an historic relegation. A thousand fans watched the team go through their paces on Thursday and shouts of ""never in the second division!"" echoed around the training ground. Hamburg are five points from safety with two games left and desperately need points against champions Bayern to climb out of the bottom three. If they finish 16th, they will face a last chance play-off against the third-placed side in the second division to try to maintain their Bundesliga place. But Bayern's Champions League exit in Tuesday's 4-0 semi-final, second-leg drubbing at home to Real has given Hamburg hope, says Netherlands star Van der Vaart. ""It's a matter of survival and honour for us. If we give our all, then we also have a chance against Bayern,"" said the 31-year-old, who is hoping to play after recovering from a calf injury. But the Dutch playmaker says Hamburg must be confident against Bayern. ""We need to show some balls, Bayern won't give anything away and it would be really bad for them to lose two games in a row,"" he said. Since being confirmed Bundesliga champions with a record seven games to spare at the end of last month, Bayern have produced some below-par performances which culminated in their drubbing at the hands of Real. ""After the defeat to Real, Bayern are sure to have no great desire to get on the plane to Hamburg. We want to annoy them,"" said director of sport Oliver Kreuzer in a radio interview. The Bavarian giants have wounded pride and will be looking to bounce back at Hamburg ahead of their German Cup final against arch rivals Borussia Dortmund in Berlin on May 17. ""We need to quickly lick our wounds so we put in a better performance in the Cup final against Dortmund,"" insisted chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge. Hamburg have suffered some heavy losses to Bayern recently, being routed 5-0 at home in February's German Cup quarter-finals and humbled 9-2 in Munich in the league in March 2013. Hamburg, for whom Mirko Slomka is their third coach this season after Thorsten Fink and Bert van Marwijk were both fired, are low on confidence after six defeats in their last ten games. Even Kreuzer has voiced doubts they will survive. ""There are legitimate doubts about a positive outcome. I have been waiting for weeks to see a reaction from the players,"" he fumed after Hamburg's lacklustre 3-1 defeat at home to mid-table Augsburg last Sunday, their third loss in a row. Hamburg have a few personnel worries with Germany pair Heiko Westermann, Marcell Jansen and Turkey midfielder Hakan Calhanoglu all struggling with injuries or illness. The top two places in the league are already decided with Bayern champions and Borussia Dortmund uncatchable in second. Schalke 04 are set to finish third, but the fight for fourth, which carries the final Champions League place for next season, rages on between Wolfsburg, who are at strugglers VfB Stuttgart, and Bayer Leverkusen, who are at mid-table Eintracht Frankfurt. At the other end of the table, bottom side Eintracht Braunschweig are at home to Augsburg while Nuremberg, who are 17th, host Hanover 96 with both teams knowing defeat could see them automatically relegated."

Real have never won in Munich after eight defeats and a draw, but Bayern must score at least twice to progress. Madrid also have a terrible overall record in Germany with just two wins, 19 defeats and six draws, but Real eliminated Bundesliga sides Schalke and Borussia Dortmund en route to the semi-finals. With Bayern bidding to reach their fourth Champions League final in five years, the visitors can expect a warm welcome from the home fans in the cauldron of the 70,000-capacity Allianz Arena. Robben, who spent two seasons at Real before moving to Munich in 2009, says Madrid will be under no illusions about what to expect in Bavaria. ""It is clear they will have lots of confidence because of the result in Madrid but they know it won't be easy here,"" said Robben. ""We won't be giving anything away tomorrow. ""Of course they won't be worried, but they also know it won't be easy. ""The Arena in Munich will be on fire. ""We will give everything. We need our fans and the support. ""All 11 players on the pitch and seven on the bench will give everything and we have lots of confidence."" Bayern chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge has turned up the heat for the Munich match by suggesting away ""teams think they are in hell"" at the Allianz Arena. But Real coach Carlo Ancelotti retorted: ""We hope the trees will burn on Wednesday, not Tuesday, when we leave"" after his side's impressive 4-0 Spanish league win at home to Osasuna on Saturday. Real's Gareth Bale started on the bench in the first leg, but with the Welshman having recovered from flu, Ancelotti is expected to play his lethal BBC in atack -- Bale, Benzema and Cristiano Ronaldo, who proved his hamstring injury is behind him with two goals against Osasuna. ""It won't be any easier for us if Ronaldo and Bale are playing from the beginning,"" added Robben. ""We were all surprised about their defensive play in Madrid. ""We have to focus on playing offensively and scoring goals but we also have to take care of their counter-attacks."" Having failed to progress from the semi-finals for the last three years, Real are desperate to reach the final in Lisbon on May 24, while Bayern are bidding to become the first team to retain the Champions League title. ""We are all motivated enough,"" said Robben. ""We know Madrid wants the 'Decima' (their 10th European triumph). We are still hungry and we know we can write history with this team so we are as motivated as they are. The two teams have great aims."""
267,27/04/2014,19:31,Football: Defeat leaves Hamburg deep in relegation mire,Former European champions Hamburg remain in danger of being relegated from the Bundesliga for the first time in their history after losing 3-1 away to Augsburg on Sunday.,"They were three goals down inside 42 minutes as Turkey striker Halil Altintop scored a brace and Andre Hahn added another goal for the hosts, and Heiko Westermann's reply just before the interval proved to be a mere consolation for HSV. Hamburg won the European Cup in 1983 but have not won any major honours since 1987, and now their status as the only club in Germany's top flight never to have been relegated is under serious threat with only two games of the season remaining. Mirko Slomka's side lie 16th in the table, only a point clear of the automatic relegation places and with a home game against reigning European champions Bayern Munich and a tricky trip to Mainz still to come. Should Hamburg remain third from bottom, they will earn a reprieve in the form of a two-legged play-off against the side which finishes third in the second tier for the right to play top-flight football next season. Borussia Dortmund, who drew 2-2 with Bayer Leverkusen on Saturday, will finish the season second to Bayern for the second year running after third-placed Schalke lost 1-0 at home to Borussia Moenchengladbach on Sunday. A first-half strike from winger Patrick Herrmann gave Gladbach the win in Gelsenkirchen which left Schalke in third and seven points adrift of neighbours Dortmund with two games left. On Saturday, Bayern Munich warmed up for Tuesday's Champions League semi-final second leg at home to Real Madrid with a 5-2 come-from-behind win against Werder Bremen. Three days after their 1-0 first-leg loss in Madrid, Bayern fell behind twice against Bremen at the Allianz Arena before scoring four second-half goals without reply. The flattering scoreline failed to mask Bayern's woeful first-half defending, which must sound the alarm bells for coach Pep Guardiola given the danger of conceding an away goal to Real. Bayern have conceded the first goal in seven of their nine matches since winning the Bundesliga title late last month with a record seven matches to spare. Once again the Munich defence was left wanting in the first 45 minutes before the reigning European champions roared back. Bayern blasted Werder 7-0 in Bremen last December, but Czech defender Theodor Gebre Selassie fired the visitors into a 1-0 lead after 10 minutes at the Allianz Arena. France winger Franck Ribery equalised before Aaron Hunt capitalised on some poor marking for Bremen's second to make it 2-1 at the break. Bayern equalised again when Thomas Mueller headed on Ribery's corner and Claudio Pizarro was on hand to stab home his shot to make it 2-2 on 54 minutes, then the Peru veteran added his second against his old club four minutes later. Bastian Schweinsteiger then powered home a header on 61 minutes before Arjen Robben hit the top corner of the net to make it 5-2 on 74 minutes, less than 60 seconds after coming off the bench. On Saturday night Dortmund drew 2-2 at fourth-placed Bayer Leverkusen with all four goals coming in the first 45 minutes. Goals by Lars Bender and Gonzalo Castro for the hosts were cancelled out by a header from Dortmund's Oliver Kirch and a Marco Reus penalty following a clear handball from Bayer defender Roberto Hilbert. VfL Wolfsburg's own hopes of Champions League qualification were dealt a blow when they were held to a 2-2 draw at home by Freiburg to stay fifth. Eintracht Braunschweig remain rooted to the bottom of the table after their 2-0 defeat at Hertha Berlin with USA international John Anthony Brooks and Tunisia striker Sami Allagui scoring the capital club's second-half goals. Striker Shinji Okazaki became the highest-scoring Japanese player in a single Bundesliga season when he scored his 14th goal to break Shinji Kagawa's previous record in Mainz's 2-0 win at home to Nuremberg. Okazaki headed his side's opening goal to break Shinja Kagawa's previous record, set for Borussia Dortmund in the 2011/12 season before he joined Manchester United."

Leverkusen's South Korea star Son Heung-Min made sure of the victory when he sprinted clear on a counter-attack and drew the defence for Spahic to tap home his second with ten minutes left. Ex-Germany international Roberto Hilbert grabbed Leverkusen's fourth seven minutes later having come off the bench. ""We want a Champions League place and we won't rest until we get it,"" said Leverkusen's director of sport Rudi Voeller. Leverkusen lead Wolfsburg by a point with just three games left to decide Germany's fourth Champions League place after Wolves had spent 24 hours in fourth after Saturday's 3-1 win at Hamburg. Bayer enjoyed their second straight win since ex-Liverpool captain Sami Hyypia was sacked as coach, while Nuremberg suffered their fourth straight defeat which leaves them second from bottom. VfB Stuttgart took a big step towards survival with a 3-1 win at home to third-placed Schalke 04 which leaves them four points from the relegation places. Austria striker Martin Harnik netted twice while Germany forward Cacau also scored as Stuttgart raced into a 3-0 lead before Hungary's Adam Szalai pulled one back for the visitors with 20 minutes left. ""We've shown we can fight, keep things together and beat a team who are better than us on paper,"" said Stuttgart coach Huub Stevens. ""That's a step (away from relegation), but nothing more."" On Saturday, champions Bayern Munich ended a run of three Bundesliga games without victory with an unimpressive 2-0 win at bottom club Eintracht Braunschweig ahead of Wednesday's Champions League semi-final, first-leg at Real Madrid. Peru veteran Claudio Pizarro, 35, and Croatian striker Mario Mandzukic were on target with late goals in what was only Bayern's third win in their last seven games in all competitions. The victory left Bayern on 81 points and 17 points clear of second-placed Dortmund who picked up their fifth straight win. Borussia enjoyed a 4-2 victory at home to ten-man Mainz 05 as coach Jurgen Klopp faced his former side having coached them from 2001-08. Dortmund took the lead after just six minutes through a curious goal when Milos Jojic's strike went in off the upper arm of Borussia's Oliver Kirch, but despite furious protests the goal stood. Japan striker Shinji Okazaki scored twice for Mainz to make it 2-2, his second after pouncing on a terrible back pass from Dortmund's Nuri Sahin. The Japanese international scoring either side of Bayern-bound Robert Lewandowski's strike for Dortmund. Dortmund made sure of the three points, which confirmed their Champions League direct qualification, with goals by defender Lukasz Piszczek and Germany winger Marco Reus, who converted a penalty 12 minutes from time after Mainz had centre-back Niko Bungert sent off for a handball. Ten-man VfL Wolfsburg romped to a 3-1 win at Hamburg as goals by Ivan Perisic, Kevin de Bruyne and Ivica Olic gave Wolves a 3-0 lead just after the break before Hamburg's Ivo Ilicevic scored a consolation for the hosts who remain third from bottom. Wolves were reduced to ten men when Brazil midfielder Luiz Gustavo was sent off for a second yellow card on 90 minutes. Hamburg are facing an historic first relegation from Germany's top flight. Freiburg are virtually assured of their survival as their 4-2 win at home to ten-man Borussia Moenchengladbach left them eight points above the relegation places with three games left. Likewise, Werder Bremen are set to stay in the Bundesliga as their 3-1 win at home to Hoffenheim lifted them up to 11th and nine points from danger while mid-table Hertha Berlin and Augsburg shared the points in a goalless draw."

Bayern were without Manchester United-target Toni Kroos and Rafinha, who were both suspended, while left-back David Alaba was missing with a cold. Germany goalkeeper Manuel Neuer sat out the trip to Braunschweig as he recovers from a calf injury with reserve shot-stopper Lukas Raeder stepping in for the third time.

271,18/04/2014,02:20,Football: Bayern eager for Real Madrid confidence boost,Bayern Munich need a convincing win at Bundesliga bottom side Eintracht Braunschweig on Saturday to dismiss talk of a mini-crisis ahead of their Champions League semi-final at Real Madrid.,"With only two wins in their last six games, Bayern have suffered a dip since winning the Bundesliga nearly a month ago with a record seven games to spare. Bayern booked their place in next month's German Cup final with a 5-1 drubbing of second division Kaiserslautern in Wednesday's semi-final in Munich. But Munich's director of sport Matthias Sammer said while the scoreline was impressive, the performance was lacking spark. Bayern have lost back-to-back league matches, an obvious concern ahead of Wednesday's Champions League semi-final, first leg at Real Madrid. ""I had the feeling that we're not really running hot at the moment,"" said Sammer, who questioned Bayern's desire to win the Champions League and German Cup finals. ""For the tasks we are facing, that's not enough. We have to ask ourselves if we still want to win these two titles."" On paper, Bayern's trip to Braunschweig looks straightforward, but the hosts have picked up seven points in their last four games to boost their survival bid. Braunschweig are without injured captain and striker Domi Kumbela, a rich source of goals for them in recent weeks, and are just three points from safety. Bayern will be without right-back Rafinha, who is serving a three-match ban after being sent off in last Saturday's 3-0 league defeat at home to Borussia Dortmund. There is also a question mark over Germany goalkeeper Manuel Neuer who missed the mid-week game with a calf strain. It remains to be seen whether coach Pep Guardiola rests his squad or looks for some continuity by naming a strong team four days before the trip to Real. Second-placed Borussia Dortmund host Mainz looking to pick up their fifth straight win having booked their German Cup final berth against Bayern on May 17. Dortmund enjoyed a 2-0 win over Wolfsburg in Tuesday's semi-final but both goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller (groin) and striker Robert Lewandowski (thigh) are carrying knocks. Lewandowski scored his 100th goal for Dortmund against Wolfsburg, but his final match in the black and yellow jersey will be against future employers Bayern in the cup final. Seventh-placed Mainz 05 now find themselves in a Europa League spot due to both cup finalists Dortmund and Bayern having qualified directly for next season's Champions League. A few shock results can be expected in the last four weeks of the season with sides desperate for points in the lower half of the table set to surprise those higher up. A good example is Saturday evening's tie when relegation-threatened Hamburg host VfL Wolfsburg, who are just a point off a Champions League berth for next season. Hamburg are the only team in Germany's top-flight to have never been relegated and have just four games left to escape the bottom three. Hamburg coach Mirko Slomka is without centre-back Heiko Westermann who has a groin injury. Wolves are without defensive midfielder Junior Malanda who tore knee ligaments in Tuesday's cup defeat at Dortmund. There will be a similar points battle when Nuremberg host Bayer Leverkusen on Sunday with the visitors eager to hold off Wolves and stay fourth. Second-from-bottom Nuremberg are two points from safety, but have lost their last three games. Likewise, Leverkusen have fragile confidence with only two wins in their last 13 matches despite their fourth place and fired coach Sami Hyypia a fortnight ago.

Hanover were reduced to ten men when midfielder Andre Hoffmann was sent off on 62 minutes for a dangerous foul before Jan Hochscheidt scored the hosts' third just before the final whistle. ""That was an important three points and for our fans it's also an important emotional win,"" said Braunschweig's relieved coach Torsten Lieberknecht whose side face champions Bayern Munich in a fortnight. The result leaves Braunschweig unbeaten in their last three games and just two points from safety, while Hanover are two points from the relegation mire after four straight defeats. Later, mid-table Hoffenheim held Hertha Berlin to a 1-1 draw in the capital as Sami Allagui's early goal was cancelled out by Poland international's Eugen Polanski equaliser with half an hour gone. Hoffenheim's Germany hopeful Kevin Volland was only denied the winning goal on the final whistle when his free-kick was palmed over the bar by Hertha goalkeeper Thomas Kraft. On Saturday, champions Bayern Munich suffered their first league defeat since October 2012 as their record 53-match unbeaten run was ended by a 1-0 defeat at Augsburg. Coach Pep Guardiola paid the price for naming a weakened team for the Bavarian derby with one eye on Wednesday's Champions League return leg at home to Manchester United. The Spaniard made seven changes from the side which drew 1-1 at Manchester United last Tuesday in the quarter-final first leg. Guardiola started with three teenagers in Augsburg, giving Bundesliga debuts to reserve team wing-backs Ylli Sallahi and Mitchell Weiser while Pierre-Emile Hoejbjerg was named on the left wing. The gamble backfired when Weiser lost possession to Augsburg's Daniel Baier who fed Sascha Moelders and the  striker blasted his shot past Bayern's goalkeeper Manuel Neuer with 31 minutes gone to claim the winning goal. This was only Bayern's third defeat of the season in all competitions having already been confirmed Bundesliga champions ten days ago with a record seven games to spare. Second-placed Borussia Dortmund earned a morale-boosting 2-1 win at home to VfL Wolfsburg ahead of Tuesday's Champions League quarter-final, second-leg at home to Real Madrid. After Croatia's Ivica Olic gave Wolves an early lead, a Robert Lewandowski header put Dortmund level before Germany winger Marco Reus hit the 77th-minute winner. Borussia face a near-impossible task of overturning a 3-0 defeat from the first leg against Real to reach the Champions League's semi-finals. Schalke 04 are now three points adrift of Dortmund in third as they came from behind to claim a 1-1 draw at Werder Bremen. At the other end of the table, VfB Stuttgart improved their chances of avoiding relegation with a 2-0 win at home to Freiburg to escape the bottom three with goals by Romania's Alexandru Maxim and Austria's Martin Harnik. Nuremberg drop to second from bottom after their 2-0 defeat at home to Borussia Moenchengladbach, who moved up to fourth and into the Champions League places at the expense of Bayer Leverkusen. Leverkusen sacked coach Sami Hyypia on Saturday less than 24 hours after their 2-1 defeat at strugglers Hamburg which left them facing a battle to qualify for next season's Champions League. Hyypia, who took on his first senior coaching role last August, has been replaced by Sascha Lewandowski, the head coach of Leverkusen's junior side, who has five games to rescue their Champions League status."

With the title already confirmed, Bayern were held to a 3-3 league draw at home to Hoffenheim last Saturday, then 1-1 at Old Trafford against Manchester United in the first leg of the Champions League quarter-final on Tuesday. ""After winning the title in Berlin, things were a bit complicated, but I get the impression that we're back now and we will be at full throttle again,"" said Dante.

Bayern will be without reserve left-back Diego Contento, who has damaged a ligament in his left ankle, meaning first-choice David Alaba is likely to start at Augsburg.

With seven games left, it is now mathematically certain that Bayern cannot be caught by any of their rivals, although in truth the title race has been over for weeks already. ""Everything has come together for us. We've played phenomenal football this season,"" said Bayern and Germany goalkeeper Manuel Neuer. ""We're so happy to have Pep Guardiola here. He's evolved our game even further."" Kroos, whose recent contract extension negotiations have stalled, opened the scoring in the sixth minute when he fired home from a Mueller cross. Goetze doubled the lead when he headed home from a Bastian Schweinsteiger delivery eight minutes later and Bayern enjoyed a remarkable 83 percent of the possession in the opening half. It could have been 3-0 at the break as Mueller headed off the crossbar with Hertha's ex-Bayern goalkeeper Thomas Kraft beaten seven minutes before the interval. The hosts pulled a goal back when Ramos netted a penalty on 66 minutes after being fouled in the area by Bayern's Brazilian right-back Rafinha. However, with 11 minutes left, Ribery scored the best goal of the night when he chipped home from a seemingly impossible angle after a storming run by Goetze. Dortmund held onto second place with a goalless draw at home to third-placed local rivals Schalke 04 with no trouble reported despite security concerns seeing some 3000 police officers deployed for the match. VfL Wolfsburg moved up to fifth with a 3-1 win at mid-table Werder Bremen as Junior Malanda, Ivan Perisic and Germany Under-21 attacking midfielder Maximilian Arnold, who is still only 19, found the net for the visitors. Centre-back Sebastian Proedl netted a consolation for Bremen. Bottom side Eintracht Braunschweig breathed some life into their survival fight with a shock 3-1 win at home to seventh-placed Mainz 05 as Congolese-born captain Dominick Kumbela scored twice. The result keeps things tight at the foot of the table with just four points separating the bottom five teams."

Bayern left it late at Mainz with midfielder Bastian Schweinsteiger striking with a header on 82 minutes before Germany team-mate Mario Goetze netted the European champions' second four minutes later. Their massive 23-point lead means Bayern are now set to be crowned champions with a record seven Bundesliga games left if they win at Hertha Berlin on Tuesday. Bayern fired in 23 shots on goal to Mainz's four as they extended their record unbeaten run to 51 Bundesliga matches and earn their 18th consecutive league win. Second-placed Dortmund, who made the Champions League quarter-finals in midweek despite a last-16 second leg home defeat to Zenit Saint Petersburg, enjoyed a 3-0 win at Hanover 96. Hanover made a bright start when centre-back Andre Hoffmann clattered the post, leaving Dortmund coach Jurgen Klopp shaking his head on the sidelines. But Dortmund took control when centre-back Mats Hummels fired home just before the break then Poland striker Robert Lewandowski netted a spectacular second-half goal. There was nothing on when the 26-year-old, who joins Bayern next season, took the ball on the left wing, raced down the flank, cut inside and drilled his shot home despite the attention of five defenders. There was more good news for Klopp late on as Marco Reus celebrated his comeback from injury by scoring their third in added time having come off the bench. Schalke 04 bounced back from Tuesday's Champions League exit at Real Madrid with a 3-1 win at home to bottom side Eintracht Braunschweig. Teenage midfielder Leon Goretzka gave Schalke the lead when he fired home a long-range shot on 17 minutes. Dutch striker Klaas-Jan Huntelaar claimed his 10th goal of the season when he fired home a direct free-kick 20 minutes from time to claim his sixth goal in his last three league games. Not to be outdone, Huntelaar's replacement Adam Szalai netted the Royal Blues third just before the final whistle after Benjamin Kessel scored Eintracht's consolation. Augsburg were held to a 1-1 draw at VfL Wolfsburg, who had ex-Chelsea midfielder Kevin de Bruyne sent off for a second yellow card. Midfielder Tobias Werner had given Augsburg a first-half lead before Croatia striker Ivica Olic equalised for Wolfsburg nine minutes from time to keep Wolves fifth. At the other end of the table, Stuttgart climbed out of the bottom three with a 1-0 win at home to 10-man Hamburg. Hamburg took Stuttgart's place in the bottom three, while new coach Huub Stevens enjoyed his first win in only his second game in charge as Stuttgart picked up their first win in ten games. Guests Hamburg were reduced to ten men when Turkey midfielder Hakan Calhanoglu was shown a second yellow card, and the subsequent, red on 53 minutes.

306,21/03/2014,02:36,Football: March madness as Bayern on verge of record triumph,Bayern Munich could be crowned German league champions in record time on Saturday if they win at Mainz 05.,"Pep Guardiola's Bayern hold an enormous 23-point lead and victory would given them the title providing rivals Borussia Dortmund fail to win at Hanover and Schalke do not beat bottom side Eintracht Braunschweig at home. Should Bayern wrap up a 24th German league title at Mainz, they will do so with eight games to spare, breaking their own record of six, set last season. No side has ever been crowned German champions in March and Bayern are bidding to become the first team to go through an entire Bundesliga campaign unbeaten. Mainz, who are on their own five-match unbeaten run, have risen to fifth in the table and are challenging for a Champions League place next season. But the Rhineland club are all too aware of the enormous task facing them against the European champions. ""Perhaps the club who finally break Bayern Munich's unbeaten run should be given an extra cup to mark the achievement. That's what we're trying to win on Saturday,"" said Mainz manager Christian Heidel. Bayern will be at near full strength, while Mainz are waiting on the fitness of Cameroon striker Eric Choupo-Moting who has had a stomach infection. ""We need to be brave and believe in a sensational win against Bayern Munich,"" said Mainz coach Thomas Tuchel. Should Bayern claim the title, any celebrations will be muted with the Bavarian giants in the quarter-finals of the Champions League and determined to defend their title. ""(Any party) wouldn't last long, we still have too many games ahead of us,"" said Bayern's Dutch winger Arjen Robben. ""We have a game every two or three days coming up and the focus is on the Champions League."" Even if Bayern's bid is foiled this weekend, they can still claim the title at Hertha Berlin on Tuesday. ""We will be champions, but exactly when is secondary,"" said Bayern's attacking midfielder Toni Kroos. Dortmund travel to Hanover 96 on Saturday without Germany left-back Marcel Schmelzer, who has a torn muscle in his pelvis, to add to their latest injury woes. The 26-year-old suffered the injury in the later stages of Dortmund's 2-1 defeat at home to Zenit St Petersburg on Wednesday in the last 16 of the Champions League. Dortmund still reached the quarter-finals with a 5-4 win on aggregate having won the first-leg in Russia 4-2 three weeks ago. Schmelzer's misfortune is the latest in a string of ailments to befall Dortmund, who are already without long-term knee injury-victims centre-back Neven Subotic and winger Jakub Blaszczykowski. Despite last Saturday's 2-1 defeat at home to Moenchengladbach, Dortmund are second in the table and are hoping to welcome back Germany winger Marco Reus, who has missed their recent games with a leg injury. Schalke 04 host Braunschweig without captain Benedikt Hoewedes, who has torn his left groin and becomes the ninth Royal Blues' player on the injury list. This is the third injury of the season for the 26-year-old Germany centre-back, who suffered the tear in Tuesday's 3-1 defeat at Real Madrid in the Champions League.

""We've overtaken two teams now, which means nothing other than we now have something to defend -- namely, not being in the relegation places,"" said Slomka. Nuremberg drop to 15th while VfB Stuttgart, who drew 1-1 at Werder Bremen on Saturday under new coach Huub Stevens, find themselves second from bottom.

312,16/03/2014,02:10,Football: Bayern plan to welcome Hoeness back after jail,"Despite his conviction for tax fraud, Bayern Munich are planning to welcome back ex-president Uli Hoeness after he has served his prison sentence.","The 62-year-old resigned as both Bayern president and chairman of the club's supervisory board on Friday and was a noticeable absentee for Saturday's 2-1 win over Bayer Leverkusen. He stepped down less than 24 hours after being sentenced to three and a half years in jail by Munich regional court having cheated the state out of 28.5 million euros ($39.5 million) in unpaid taxes. He admitted to hiding his wealth in secret Swiss bank accounts while obsessively ""gambling"" on stock and currency markets for years. But while Hoeness waits to start his time behind bars, the Bavarian giants already hope he will be back at the Allianz Arena soon. ""This club is one of the best in the world and that is down to the personality of Uli Hoeness,"" said coach Pep Guardiola. ""He deserves our respect. I hope he can come back in the future and help us."" On Saturday, Bayern named Karl Hopfner as Hoeness' successor as club president. Adidas' CEO Herbert Hainer, the CEO of German sportswear giants Adidas, takes over from Hoeness as chairman of Bayern's advisory board. Both positions must be ratified by a vote on May 2 at the club's general assembly. But Edmund Stoiber, head of Bayern's management board, implied there will be a role for Hoeness with the European champions following his release. ""A door is always open and Uli Hoeness will always be the soul of the club,"" Stoiber told Die Welt. ""Whatever he wants to do, anything is possible."" Hoeness's fall from grace comes with the club he built on the ascendancy and confirmed as the world's best domestic side after winning the Club World Cup last December. There has been zero condemnation from within the tight-knit Bayern camp, even after the guilty verdict. Chants of ""Hoeness - you're the best man!"" could be heard at Munich's Allianz Arena during the win over Leverkusen. Sky television underscored his absence when zooming in on the empty seat next to chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge where Hoeness normally sits and there were a few banners of support from fans. ""His resignation deserves the respect from FC Bayern and from all football fans,"" said Rummenigge. ""I am not a fan of the saying, 'the king is dead, long live the king', more of Franz Beckenbauer's sentiment that 'you never separate from good friends'. ""It's very hard to replace someone like Uli Hoeness at the top of the club."" The club's stance has always been that the tax matters were personal choices made by Hoeness, unconnected to his work as an employee. His conviction tarnishes the image of his beloved Bayern, even if the club's success is directly entwined with Hoeness' drive. All five of Bayern's European titles in 1974, 1975, 1976, 2001 and 2013 came with him involved as either a player, general manager or club president. Before his arrival as an 18-year-old in 1970, they had won just two of their 23 German league titles with a 24th imminent. Bayern became Germany's first side to win the treble of Champions League, Bundesliga and German Cup under Jupp Heynckes last season, breaking or equalling 25 league records. Hoeness was instrumental in luring Heynckes's successor Guardiola to Munich and Bayern have thrived this season under the Spaniard. Hoeness will not start his sentence for a few weeks while the verdict is finalised with the prosecution able to appeal having wanted a longer sentence. As a first-time offender, Hoeness is most likely to serve his sentence in Landsberg prison, 60 kilometres east of Munich. It is the same jail where Adolf Hitler wrote his novel 'Mein Kampf' in 1924 while serving 264 days detention for his part in the previous year's Munich Beer Hall Putsch. A spokesperson for Munich's regional court has said Hoeness could qualify for day release after just a few weeks of his sentence. In his absence, his successful sausage-making factory will be run by his son Florian. Bayern's 24th German league title could be confirmed next Saturday if they win at Mainz 05 and both rivals Dortmund and Schalke draw, but Hoeness may already be behind bars. ""It's a very tough situation for FC Bayern, for Uli Hoeness and his family,"" said France winger Franck Ribery following the win over Leverkusen. ""We want to keep winning for him. ""It's a difficult situation, but we have to keep going forward. ""He's a big figure and he will always be with us."""

Leverkusen are the last German team to win against Bayern -- who are unbeaten in all of their 49 matches since -- dating back to October 28, 2012. Behind the scenes, Bayern have endured arguably the most turbulent week in the club's history after Uli Hoeness was convicted of major tax fraud on Thursday and resigned as club president 24 hours later. If Bayern go 23 points clear, they could be confirmed Bundesliga champions next Saturday, if they pick up another three points and their rivals lose, to go 26 points clear with eight games left to play. Gladbach earned their first win in ten games to dent Dortmund's confidence ahead of Wednesday's Champions League last 16 clash at home to Zenit St Petersburg when they hold a 4-2 lead from the first leg. ""That is a bitter result for us, so the disappointment is huge,"" said Dortmund captain Sebastian Kehl. Dortmund are now just one point clear of third-placed rivals Schalke ahead of the Ruhr Valley derby on March 25. ""We could have a cushion behind us, now things are tight,"" admitted Dortmund midfielder Nuri Sahin. Swiss coach Lucien Favre extended his Gladbach contract last week until 2017 and his side produced a devastating nine-minute first-half spell at Dortmund's Westfalenstadion. ""Don't worry, you'll still finish second in the league,"" Favre told Klopp after the final whistle. Gladbach took the lead when a scuffed shot from Brazilian striker Raffael wrong-footed Dortmund goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller on 31 minutes after Patrick Herrmann got the better of Borussia defender Mats Hummels to fire in a cross. The hosts doubled their lead five minutes before the break when Herrmann found Juan Arango and the Venezuelan put in a great final pass for Germany squad striker Max Kruse to fire home five minutes before the break. Gladbach midfielder Havard Nordtveit was sent off for a second yellow card for the final 20 minutes and new-signing Milos Jojic pulled one back for Dortmund on 77 minutes. Mainz moved up to fifth with a sensational 4-2 victory at Hoffenheim with Japan's Shinji Okazaki netting their last two goals as the guests scored three times in seven stunning second-half minutes to come from 2-0 down. The win keeps Thomas Tuchel's Mainz in the hunt for a European spot next season and are only three points short of a Champions League berth. Relegation-threatened VfB Stuttgart, with new coach Huub Stevens in charge, are winless in their last 10 matches as they were held to a 1-1 draw at Werder Bremen. Stuttgart's Martin Harnik hammered a first-half penalty attempt off the post just before the break against his old club, but defender Georg Niedermeier gave the guests a 55th-minute lead. Bremen's Germany midfielder Aaron Hunt fired home a direct free-kick on 79 minutes to share a point. Wolfsburg drop to sixth after their 1-1 draw at bottom side Eintracht Braunschweig as only three points separate the bottom four clubs including Freiburg, Hamburg and Stuttgart. Hertha's European aspirations suffered a dent as they lost 2-0 at home to Hanover 96 to stay ninth and four points off the top six. On Friday, Schalke 04 moved up to third -- an automatic Champions League spot -- with a 2-1 win at Augsburg as Dutch striker Klaas-Jan Huntelaar scored twice. Having scored a hat-trick in last Saturday's 4-0 rout of Hoffenheim, Huntelaar took his tally to six goals in his last four games. The victory is a welcome boost for the Royal Blues ahead of Tuesday's trip to Real Madrid where they face the near-impossible task of over-turning their 6-1 home leg defeat."

Since then Bayern are unbeaten in 49 league matches and enjoy a 20-point lead in the table. But the club is in turmoil after Hoeness resigned as both president and chairman of the advisory board on Friday after being sentenced to three and a half years in jail on Thursday, The 62-year-old, who won the 1974 World Cup with West Germany, cheated the German state out of 28.5 million euros ($39.5 million) of taxes. ""Tax evasion was the mistake of my life,"" Hoeness said in a statement on the Bayern website. ""I want to avert harm to my club. ""Bayern Munich is my life's work and always will be. ""I will stay committed to this great club and its people as long as I live."" Having been the driving force behind the Champions League holders since joining them as an 18-year-old in 1970, Hoeness played a huge part in turning them into a European powerhouse. Bayern have won 21 of their 23 German league titles and all five of their European Cup or Champions League victories with him involved either as a player, club manager or president. Leverkusen have problems of their own and last won on February 7, losing six of their last seven matches. Third-placed Bayer were knocked out of the Champions League's last 16 on Wednesday when they lost 2-1 at Paris Saint-Germain after being drubbed 4-0 at home.

But the visitors had right-back Traesch sent off for a foul in the area and Hoffenheim's Sejad Salihovic netted the penalty before Modeste's replacement Sven Schipplock hit their sixth. Wolfsburg's result leaves them fifth. It means all three teams immediately behind leaders Bayern Munich and second-placed Borussia Dortmund, who beat Nuremberg 3-0 on Saturday, suffered defeats over the weekend. VfB Stuttgart are fourth from bottom after losing 2-1 at Eintracht Frankfurt in what was a club record eighth straight defeat and heaped further pressure on coach Thomas Schneider. Stuttgart striker Martin Harnik's first-half goal was cancelled out by Eintracht midfielder Jan Rosenthal ten minutes from time before captain Alexander Meier hit the 89th-minute winner. On Saturday, an Arjen Robben hat-trick saw Bayern open a 20-point lead at the top of the table with a 5-1 win over ten-man Schalke 04.

Schalke were gifted a goal when Jefferson Farfan's corner was turned into his own net by Munich right-back Rafinha, in for captain Philipp Lahm, with 25 minutes left. To compound Schalke's misery, Greece centre-back Kyriakos Papadopoulos was shown a straight red for bringing down Mandzukic in the area.

Having dropped just four points all season, his side have now claimed 65 points after 23 games -- setting another league record. Bayern won last season's treble of league, cup and Champions League titles. They had wrapped up the Bundesliga with a record six games to spare and Guardiola's side is on course to at least equal that. Having won 14 titles in four years as Barcelona coach before standing down in 2012, Guardiola could have his first Bundesliga title confirmed by the end of March in his first season in charge. ""In the break, we talked about respect for the opponent and about how we needed to keep serious,"" said Guardiola, ever the perfectionist as his side led 4-0 at half-time at Munich's Allianz Arena. ""Congratulations to the team. With every game we move a little closer to defending the league title,"" he added with 11 league games left. Guardiola has already won two titles at Munich having scooped the UEFA Super Cup by beating Chelsea in Prague last August, then lifting the Club World Cup in Morocco in December. On Friday, Guardiola flippantly told reporters ""don't ask me about the title!"" in broken German, but Bayern will wrap up their 24th German league title when they host Hoffenheim at home on March 29 if they maintain their massive lead. Germany winger Thomas Mueller was the first from the Bayern camp to admit the title race is over, telling Munich newspaper TZ: ""I don't think anyone is reckoning that we will lose six of our last remaining matches"". Bayern were never troubled by Schalke, who lost 6-1 at home to Cristiano Ronaldo's Real Madrid on Wednesday in the Champions League, and were 4-0 down inside half an hour on Saturday. With three minutes gone, left-back David Alaba netted a free-kick, then Robben scored either side of Mario Mandzukic's header from a superb Alaba cross. Schalke were gifted a goal when Jefferson Farfan's corner was turned into his own net by Munich right-back Rafinha, in for captain Philipp Lahm, with 25 minutes left -- it was only the tenth goal Bayern have conceded all season. To compound Schalke's misery, Greece centre-back Kyriakos Papadopoulos was shown a straight red for bringing down Mandzukic in the area. His foul allowed Robben to wrap up his hat-trick with a 77th-minute penalty. ""My son will enjoy having the match ball, my kids are my biggest fans,"" said Dutch winger and father of three Robben. ""We play with so much aggression and tempo, we really put our foot down.

""We have no choice, but to write off the game,"" said Schalke midfielder Julian Draxler in the wake of the Real debacle. ""We have to get it out of our heads and prepare for Bayern."" Ronaldo finished with ten shots on goal, the same as the entire Schalke team. The Royal Blues now face an equally tough challenge at Bayern, who have won all of their last 14 games and are on a record 47-match unbeaten run. ""They (Bayern) are even better than Real, but we're not just going there to limit the damage,"" said Schalke's director of sport Horst Heldt. Bayern's 4-0 romp at Hanover 96 last Sunday left Pep Guardiola's European champions 19-points clear at the top of the table. If they maintain their lead, their 24th German league title can be confirmed by the end of March at the latest and they have dropped just four points all season. They are on course to become the first Bundesliga side to complete a season unbeaten. In contrast, Schalke's Real debacle was the worst home defeat by a German side in Champions League history and has had a physical effect, as well as battering their confidence. Both centre-back Felipe Santana and central midfielder Kevin-Prince Boateng are ruled out with leg injuries. Left-back Sead Kolasinac has a bruised jaw and defensive midfielder Roman Neustaedter has a knee injury. ""It makes no sense to use ailing players, so others will have to get involved,"" said Heldt with a host of changes expected. Bayern are set to welcome back left wing Xherdan Shaqiri while Franck Ribery continues to recover from buttocks surgery. Germany star Bastian Schweinsteiger is set to make his second start after back-to-back injuries. Third-placed Borussia Dortmund host Nuremberg on Saturday with concerns at centre-back. Greece defender Sokratis is nursing a foot injury from their 4-2 Champions League last 16, first-leg win at Zenit St Petersburg. Coach Jurgen Klopp is without both his first-choice centre backs. Mats Hummels is on the verge of returning from an ankle knock while Neven Subotic is out for the season with a torn knee ligament. Bayer Leverkusen are second in the table, but low on confidence as they host resurgent Mainz 05 after a horror sequence of seven losses in nine games. Following the shock German Cup defeat at home to second-division Kaiserslautern, Bayer were routed 4-0 at home to Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions League, then crashed 3-1 at Wolfsburg last weekend in the league. ""They have been the worst ten days,"" admitted striker Stefan Kiessling. Leverkusen will be without winger Gonzalo Castro and defender Emir Spahic who are both suspended. Mainz are ninth, but closing in on a top six place after losing just one of their last eight games. There is a relegation battle brewing in the north German derby when strugglers Werder Bremen host Hamburg, who are third from bottom. Hamburg's new coach Mirko Slomka made his debut in last Saturday's shock 3-0 win at home to Borussia Dortmund which broke their run of eight straight defeats.

Fourth-placed Schalke are licking their wounds after suffering the heaviest home defeat by a German team in Champions League history on Wednesday by Real. But ex-Schalke goalkeeper Neuer said Bayern can expect the Royal Blues to come out fighting in Munich while Pep Guardiola's European champions look to extend their record 47-match unbeaten league run. ""They will not come to Munich and let us win easily,"" said the 27-year-old Neuer, who joined Bayern from Schalke in 2011, before Saturday evening's match. ""Schalke will want to show their true colours, even after they have had to cope with this severe disappointment. ""We can't afford to take them lightly, we just want to win the game and stay at our high level."" Likewise, Bayern's former Schalke defender Rafinha said Munich cannot expect to enjoy a win over Schalke by a similarly high scoreline as the one Real enjoyed. ""This is a different competition and we can't afford to underestimate a team like Schalke,"" said the Brazil wing-back. ""For us winning is all that's important, a one or two nil result would be enough."" While holders Bayern are well placed to reach the Champions League's quarter-finals after their 2-0 first-leg win at Arsenal, Schalke are all but out. They need a near-impossible 6-0 win at Real in the return leg in Madrid on March 18 to progress. ""We have no choice but to write off the game,"" said Schalke midfielder Julian Draxler.

Real's Ballon d'Or winner Cristiano Ronaldo also scored twice to see him take over from Zlatan Ibrahimovic as the competition's top-scorer with 11 European goals this season. Netherlands striker Klaas-Jan Huntelaar scored a 91st-minute consolation goal for Schalke, but the Royal Blues still suffered their heaviest defeat in European competition. Carlo Ancelotti's Real are now unbeaten in their last 27 games dating back to October. The huge victory went some way to correcting Real's terrible away record in Germany as they made the Royal Blues of Schalke look anything but regal. This was only Real's second win in 26 visits to Germany after 18 defeats, including their 4-1 drubbing at Borussia Dortmund in last season's Champions League's semi-final. Real needed just 13 minutes to take the lead at the Veltins Arena as their star-studded attack clicked into gear. Wales winger Bale cut in from the right, Ronaldo flicked his pass into space and Benzema beat the Welshman to the loose ball and fired past Schalke goalkeeper Ralf Faehrmann. Schalke almost immediately equalised as teenage midfielder Max Meyer fired over the bar with the goal at his mercy after Ilker Casillas had blocked Julian Draxler's shot. Schalke were punished for wasting their rare opportunity and with 21 minutes gone, Bale held off two Schalke defenders to make it 2-0 with La Liga leaders in full control. Schalke's situation was not helped by Ronaldo effortlessly switching with Bale from the left to the right wing midway through the first half, only to revert back after the break. Schalke came out all guns blazing for the second-half as Kevin-Prince Boateng forced Casillas into a rare save. But Ronaldo finally got on the scoresheet at the fourth attempt to claim his 10th European goal of the season in his sixth Champions League match. He effortlessly turned Cameroon centre-back Joel Matip inside, then out before tucking the ball just inside the far post with 52 minutes gone. Just five minutes later, his deft backheel fell into Benzema's path for the Frenchman to drill home his second of the night and Real's fourth past the despairing Faehrmann. It was one-way traffic by now and Bale scored his second and Real's fifth when Sergio Ramos's through ball was driven low into the bottom left-hand corner on 69 minutes. Ronaldo then grabbed his second on 89 minutes to leave him with 36 goals in 33 games for Real before Huntelaar finally put Schalke on the board just before the final whistle. The Royal Blues face another tough challenge ahead of the return trip to Spain as they face European champions Bayern Munich away in the Bundesliga on Saturday."

Ancelotti said the midfield star was ""highly motivated"" for the last 16 clash at the Veltins Arena having scored nine goals in five European games this season. ""He's really wanted to play, he was not happy about not being able to do so,"" said Ancelotti. ""He's done very well in training. ""He is in optimal physical and mental shape."" Unbeaten in their last 26 matches in all competitions, Real are eager to progress having reached the Champions League's semi-finals for the last three seasons. ""I do not have to say much to motivate my players because they want to play a leading role in all competitions,"" said the 54-year-old Italian, who won the European Cup twice as a player with AC Milan and its successor the Champions League a further two times as coach of Milan. ""The Champions League is the most prestigious, but also the most difficult competition. ""There is no doubt that we are in a very good shape and we want to continue our good run."" Madrid have an awful record in Germany, prevailing just once in 24 previous away matches against Bundesliga opposition and losing 17 times. That includes a 4-1 drubbing at Borussia Dortmund in last season's semi-final first leg when Robert Lewandowski hit all four goals. Schalke are fourth in the Bundesliga and having been guilty of erratic form in the first half of the season, they won their first four games of 2014. Ancelotti singled out Schalke's rising midfield stars Max Meyer (18) and Julian Draxler (20), who is on the verge of returning from a foot injury, combined with proven stars Klaas-Jan Huntelaar and Kevin-Prince Boateng. ""They have very good young players like Draxler, although I do not know if he will play tomorrow, and very experienced players like Huntelaar or Boateng,"" said Ancelotti. ""It's not a spectacular team, but they have a very effective, solid game. ""I expect an intense match in which Schalke will give everything."" Ancelotti also said Welsh winger Gareth Bale is set to start, ""he plays when he's fit"", while Schalke coach Jens Keller has said his side will not be overawed by star-studded Real. ""We want to pull off a small miracle. We're not just going out there to swap shirts with Real's stars,"" said Keller."

335,25/02/2014,02:00,Football: Bale targets rare Real win in Germany,"Real Madrid are targeting a rare win in Germany when they take on Schalke 04 in Wednesday's Champions League last 16, first-leg clash, the Spanish giants' Gareth Bale says.","Having scored 20 goals in the group stages, Madrid are looking to improve on their dreadful away record in Germany as they take on Schalke for the first time. ""We know the Champions League is a big competition with all the best teams in it, so we know it is going to be difficult,"" said the 24-year-old Wales winger. ""I think we are ready, we believe we can win every game so we'll go over there and hopefully come back with the win."" The Spanish league leaders are unbeaten in 26 games in all competitions, dating back to last October, and are clear favourites against the Royal Blues of Gelsenkirchen, who are fourth in the Bundesliga. But Madrid have prevailed just once in 24 previous away matches against German opposition, losing 17 times, including a 4-1 drubbing at Borussia Dortmund in last season's semi-final first leg when Robert Lewandowski hit all four goals. That said, Schalke's form this season has been erratic and they have won only five of their last 11 home encounters against Spanish opponents, suffering four defeats. Madrid will be able to call on the firepower of Ballon d'Or winner Cristiano Ronaldo, who returns from a three-game ban. The injury doubts are left-backs Marcelo and Fabio Coentrao as neither played in the 3-0 win against Elche on Saturday, so Alvaro Arbeloa could deputise if neither are fit. Luka Modric and Sergio Ramos are also expected to return after being suspended and rested respectively at the weekend. Schalke were denied a fifth straight league win when they were held to a goalless draw at home to Mainz on Friday. There was good news, though, for Schalke as Arsenal-target Julian Draxler came off the bench to make his return after two months out with a foot injury. ""As a young boy you dream about facing teams like Real Madrid so we're all really up for it,"" said the 20-year-old. ""I'm happy to be back out on the pitch, but I think I'm still some way off my best form. ""That was the first lengthy lay-off of my career, so I'm a bit impatient, but I know I need more time."" Teenager Leon Goretzka has said the hosts are looking for an upset at the Veltins Arena. ""We're looking forward to the highlight in the Champions League,"" said the 19-year-old. ""We'll do everything in our power to cause an upset."" Goalkeeper Ralf Faehrmann has said Schalke are relishing the role of underdogs. ""Sometimes we find it easier when we don't really have to take the game to our opponents,"" he said. ""We need to stay compact and wait for our chances. ""You always get a chance in a match and when we do we need to take it. ""We aren't favourites, of course, but we hope to take advantage of our underdog role to spring a surprise."" Coach Jens Keller, who hopes to have captain and centre-back Benedikt Hoewedes fit, has said Schalke will not be intimidated by star-studded Real. ""We want to pull off a small miracle. We're not just going out there to swap shirts with Real's stars,"" said Keller defiantly, referring to Bayer Leverkusen's drubbing by Real's Spanish rivals Barcelona at the same stage in the competition two years ago. Leverkusen were beaten 3-1 at home in the last 16, then thrashed 7-1 in Barcelona, but not before Bayer players Michal Kadlec and Manuel Friedrich had argued over who would swap shirts with Barcelona star Lionel Messi."

Bayern are hoping to have Mueller back for the Champions League last 16, second-leg clash, against Arsenal in Munich on March 11 with Bayern holding a 2-0 lead from the first leg, when Mueller scored the European champions' second goal with a late header."
337,23/02/2014,20:49,Football: Bayern rout Hanover to go 19 points clear,European champions Bayern Munich opened a 19-point gap in the Bundesliga on Sunday with a 4-0 victory at Hanover 96 -- their 20th win from 22 league matches.,"Bayern coach Pep Guardiola had described the Bundesliga as ""pizzas and hamburgers"" compared to the ""gourmet"" of the Champions League in the wake of last Wednesday's 2-0 win at Arsenal in Europe. Their main domestic rivals did little to disprove Guardiola's point as Bayer Leverkusen, Borussia Dortmund and Schalke picked up just a point between them over the weekend. ""It took a while for the players to find their rhythm, but we played well after the first goal,"" said Guardiola. ""We had the opportunity to extend our lead and the boys took it."" The Bavarian giants extended their record unbeaten run to 47 Bundesliga matches, dating back to October 2012, to strengthen their iron grip on what will be their 24th German league title, baring a miracle. Having won last season's league title with a record six games to spare, Bayern are on course to break their own best mark. Hanover offered little resistance as Germany winger Thomas Mueller scored twice while attacking midfielder Thiago Alcantara and Croatia striker Mario Mandzukic also netted. There was more good news for both Bayern and Germany as Bastian Schweinsteiger made his first start since November after an ankle, then knee injury, to partner captain Philipp Lahm in the defensive midfield. ""It was good to start and have no problems, I feel good, even in terms of fitness,"" said Schweinsteiger. ""I still need to get into my rhythm and need some more match practice to get top fit. I just hope things stay positive for me."" Brazil's Rafinha, who took over from Lahm at right-back, strengthened his case for a Selecao place at June's World Cup with two crosses which both led to goals. Mueller set Bayern on the way to their 14th consecutive league win when he headed home Rafinha's cross with 25 minutes gone. Thiago then chested down Schweinsteiger's superb pass and fired home to make it 2-0 after 34 minutes. Mueller profited from a Mandzukic pass to get behind the Hanover defence and score his second on 59 minutes, while Mandzukic then headed home Rafinha's cross for Bayern's fourth, seven minutes later. On Saturday, Borussia Dortmund suffered a shock 3-0 league defeat at strugglers Hamburg ahead of Tuesday's Champions League last-16 clash at Zenit St Petersburg. Hamburg recorded their first league win since November in Mirko Slomka's first match in charge as his side broke their eight-match losing streak, including a club record seven league matches. The result sees Hamburg remain among the relegation places, but move up to 16th, while Dortmund stay third. There was more bad news for Jurgen Klopp on Sunday as defensive midfielder Sven Bender was ruled out for the next 10 weeks with an inflamed pelvis. Second-placed Bayer Leverkusen went down 3-1 at VfL Wolfsburg as Sami Hyypia's side lost for the seventh time in their last nine games. Leverkusen suffered a Champions League hangover, following their 4-0 last-16, first-leg home defeat to Paris Saint-Germain, with another poor display. Braunschweig are now three points adrift at the bottom after their 2-1 defeat at ten-man Nuremberg in a match where three penalties were saved. Borussia Moenchengladbach stay sixth, but are winless in their last seven games after their 2-2 draw at home to Hoffenheim. Augsburg got back to winning ways with a 4-2 victory at Freiburg to bounce back from last weekend's defeat to Nuremberg, their only loss in the last eight games. VfB Stuttgart are just above the bottom three after they suffered their seventh straight defeat at home to Hertha Berlin, who ran out 2-1 winners. Hertha's replacement striker Sandro Wagner headed the winner, three minutes from time, but was then sent off for a second yellow card having only been on the pitch for 12 minutes. Fourth-placed Schalke, who host Real Madrid in Wednesday's Champions League last-16, first-leg clash, stayed fourth after their goalless draw at home to Mainz 05 on Friday."

""That is just one of 13 games and we won't stop working,"" said Slomka. ""We didn't quite deserve to win by that margin, but we did well in defence and the team can be proud of the points.""

""Mainz were strong opposition, so there's nothing wrong with the result,"" said Keller with Schalke fourth in the Bundesliga. ""We now look forward to the Champions League game against Real Madrid."" Schalke have a decent Champions League record in recent years having reached the 2010/11 semi-finals and bowed out at the last 16 stage to Galatasaray last season. ""These are the games you dream of as a small child,"" said Germany midfielder Julian Draxler, who came on for the last 25 minutes against Mainz after missing three months with an ankle injury. Schalke certainly have their work cut out in the next week hosting Carlo Ancelotti's Real on Wednesday in the Champions League, then European champions Bayern Munich away in the Bundesliga next Saturday. ""Next Saturday we play against the best team in the world, and on Wednesday against one that is not far from it,"" said Schalke's director of sport Horst Heldt."
346,21/02/2014,02:15,Football: New Hamburg boss Slomka relishing Dortmund test,New Hamburg coach Mirko Slomka has said he is relishing hosting Borussia Dortmund on Saturday as he begins the task of escaping the relegation places to ensure his new club's Bundesliga survival.,"Slomka penned a two-year deal as Hamburg coach on Monday, replacing ex-Netherlands boss Bert van Marwijk who was sacked last Saturday with the club second from bottom and on an eight-match losing streak. The 46-year-old Slomka has just 13 matches left to prevent former European champions Hamburg being relegated from Germany's top flight for the first time. And he has a tough opener against a resurgent Dortmund side who have won their last four matches and are eager to reclaim second spot in the league. Jurgen Klopp's Dortmund will be using the match to tune up for Tuesday's Champions League last 16, first-leg trip to Russia to face Zenit St Petersburg having hammered Eintracht Frankfurt 4-0 at home last Saturday. ""The challenge of facing Dortmund is a good measuring stick for us,"" said Slomka. ""Everyone knows them and how they play, but we have a home game and, as I already have said and will keep on saying, we must win our home games. ""And I am sure the fans will give their support on Saturday."" Some 800 supporters turned out to watch Slomka's first training session on Monday. The response was a far cry from their last home game when angry fans pelted the team and attacked their cars following the 3-0 defeat to Hertha Berlin two weeks ago. Both sides have injury concerns with Hamburg missing captain Rafael van der Vaart, who suffered an ankle injury in last Saturday's 4-2 loss at bottom side Eintracht Braunschweig which led to Van Marwijk's dismissal. Dortmund hope to welcome back winger Marco Reus, although centre-back Mats Hummels is expected to miss out as his ankle injury continues to heal. League leaders Bayern Munich are at mid-table Hanover 96 on Sunday evening looking to maintain their 16-point lead at the top of the table and extend their unbeaten league run to 47 matches. Bayern coach Pep Guardiola will be without France winger Franck Ribery, who also missed their 2-0 win at Arsenal on Wednesday in the first leg of their Champions League last-16 tie as he recovers from buttock surgery. But Ribery, 30, has said he is targeting a return against Schalke 04 next Saturday. Meanwhile, Bayern's Germany midfielder Toni Kroos, who scored their first goal at Arsenal, is no closer to agreeing to a new Munich deal past 2015, with wages being the main stumbling block. ""There are no further discussions planned in the near future,"" he told German magazine Kicker with a host of Premier League clubs chasing his signature. Schalke host Mainz 05 on Friday hoping to pick up a morale-boosting fifth straight win before Wednesday's Champions League visit of Real Madrid. Both centre-back Benedikt Hoewedes and attacking midfielder Julian Draxler are set to return to the Schalke side after injury. Second-placed Bayer Leverkusen need to bounce back from their 4-0 home defeat at the hands of Paris Saint-Germain in the last 16 of the Champions League on Tuesday. Sami Hyypia's Leverkusen have lost all of their last three home games and have suffered six defeats in their last eight matches as they prepare to travel to European hopefuls Wolfsburg.

347,18/02/2014,11:50,Football: Bundesliga's marketing lags behind England: CEO,"All four German clubs have reached the Champions League's last 16, but Bundesliga boss Christian Seifert believes the German league is ten years behind England's Premier League in its marketing.","The 2013 Champions League final was an all-German affair last May as Bayern Munich enjoyed a 2-1 victory over Borussia Dortmund at London's Wembley. This season, both Bundesliga sides have joined domestic rivals Schalke and Bayer Leverkusen, who host Paris Saint-Germain on Tuesday, in the competition's last 16. But Seifert says while the Germans may be enjoying on-field success, their marketing is a decade behind that of their English rivals. In January, Premier League side Arsenal signed a five-year kit deal with Puma worth 30 million pounds (36.6 million euros, US$50m) per season. ""I am convinced that the Bundesliga will benefit from sustained good performances in Europe, in terms of global marketing,"" Seifert, CEO of the German Football League (DFL) told Hamburg daily Handelsblatt. ""But when you read that Puma have just pledged a three-figure deal in terms of millions, then that is food for thought. ""In terms of international marketing, the Bundesliga is ten years behind the Premier League."" Both Bayern and their Bundesliga rivals Hertha Berlin have announced recent bumper sponsorship deals. Munich's coffers will be boosted by an extra 110 million euros from Bavarian-based finance services company Allianz and Hertha have attracted 61.2 million euros from American investment group KKR. Seifert sees both developments as positive for the league. ""In my view, such a financial commitment can be quite meaningful,"" he said. ""After all, the Bundesliga is economically and sportingly one of the strongest professional leagues in the world."" But Seifert warns clubs to be wary of big-money deals from investors who could pull out overnight. ""During that period, an investor would have had some influence on the course of the competition, including de facto relegation and qualifications for international competitions,"" he said. ""We owe it to the clubs, their fans and their business partners to look at these deals very closely."" There are already safeguard measures in Germany, where the ""50+1"" rule means each club has to have a controlling stake to stop commercial investors gaining control. At European champions Bayern Munich, for example, Audi, Adidas and now Allianz each own nine per cent, but the rest is controlled by the members via the club."
348,17/02/2014,02:05,Football: PSG out to brush aside off-form Leverkusen,"Bayer Leverkusen must brush off recent poor form if they are to stop Zlatan Ibrahimovic's Paris Saint-Germain's march to the Champions League quarter-finals in Tuesday's last 16, first-leg clash.","Leverkusen have their work cut out containing maverick Ibrahimovic and overcoming the formidable obstacle of high-scoring PSG if they are to reach the last eight for the first time since 2002. Any side with Ibrahimovic in their ranks is dangerous and the Parisians finished as comfortable winners of Group C, scoring 16 goals in the process. The 32-year-old boasts the superb return of eight goals from five Champions League matches this term, leaving him second only to Real Madrid's Cristiano Ronaldo, who has nine. The Sweden star already has three more than in his previous best seasons in the competition with Inter Milan in 2007/08 and AC Milan in 2011/12. Sami Hyypia-coached Leverkusen have had far from an ideal preparation, crashing to their second straight home defeat, their fifth loss in seven games, when they went down 2-1 to Schalke 04 in Saturday's Bundesliga match. The defeat followed second-division Kaiserslautern's shock 1-0 extra time German Cup win at Leverkusen's BayArena last Wednesday, but Hyypia refuses to panic. ""If we play like we did against Schalke, we will be able to live with Paris,"" said the ex-Liverpool defender. ""Only playing well doesn't bring us points, we have to be more effective and score goals. I hope we manage that against Paris."" Hyypia will be able to call up Germany winger Sidney Sam, who was rested for the Schalke defeat after announcing in January that he will join the Royal Blues at the end of the season. Having reached the quarter-finals for the first time last season, big-spending PSG are gunning to be crowned European champions for the first time. ""I think it would mean a lot,"" said Ibrahimovic, who scored in PSG's 3-0 win at home to Valenciennes on Friday to stay top of the French league. ""If we can get further than the quarter-finals this year, it would be a big step for us. ""This project has been ongoing for two years and I've been here for one-and-a-half - it is developing."" Leverkusen's last foray into the Champions League's knockout rounds came two years ago when they lost 3-1 at home to Barcelona in the last 16's first-leg, only to be humiliated 7-1 in Spain when Lionel Messi hit a record five goals. With the return leg in Paris on March 12, Leverkusen will need to tighten up at the back. The Werkself need to correct their deep-lying defence, which was punished when Dutch striker Klaas-Jan Huntelaar headed Schalke's late winner. Hyypia will be without Australia winger and knee injury-victim Robbie Kruse, who is out for the season, while ex-Bayern Munich midfielder Emre Can is suspended. Uruguay forward Edinson Cavani is missing for PSG with a hamstring injury, while defenders Zoumana Camara, calf, and Christophe Jallet, back, are rated doubtful. Nevertheless, PSG head to Leverkusen in buoyant mood after Friday's win kept them top of the French league with a five-point lead. ""The primary goal before the Leverkusen match was to take the three points,"" said PSG coach Laurent Blanc. ""The players were thinking about Leverkusen, but they ignored that and got the job done."""
349,16/02/2014,20:43,"Football: Hamburg turn to Slomka, Van der Vaart injured","Hamburg are to turn to experienced coach Mirko Slomka to help them avoid relegation from the Bundesliga following Bert van Marwijk's dismissal, while captain Rafael van der Vaart is injured.","Ex-Netherlands coach Van Marwijk, 61, was sacked on Saturday night after Hamburg were drubbed 4-2 at bottom side Eintracht Braunschweig, their seventh consecutive league defeat seeing them set an unwelcome club record. There was more bad news on Sunday when it was confirmed Netherlands midfielder and club captain Van der Vaart will be out for the next three weeks with an ankle injury after going off injured at Braunschweig. Slomka is set to step in after spells at both Bundesliga sides Schalke 04 and Hanover 96, who sacked him in December after a string of away defeats. Reports confirm Hamburg's board are in agreement to take on Slomka, with only details of the contract to be finalised and the 46-year-old is set to become Hamburg's 11th coach in just over 10 years. The 46-year-old notably helped Schalke to second place in 2007 and he took over at Hanover 96 in 2010, steering the Lower Saxony side to the Europa League in 2011-12 and 2012-13. After only 143 days in charge, Van Marwijk was relieved of his post, along with his assistant Roel Coumans, after an emergency meeting of the club's board late Saturday with the team second from bottom. Hamburg have never previously been relegated from the Bundesliga and Slomka faces an unenviable task to inspire a squad low on morale."
350,16/02/2014,02:30,Football: Bayern relishing Arsenal clash after Freiburg rout,"Manuel Neuer said holders Bayern Munich are relishing facing Arsenal in Wednesday's Champions League last-16, first-leg clash after routing Freiburg to go 16 points clear in the Bundesliga.","Germany goalkeeper Neuer was barely bothered by Freiburg's attack at Munich's Allianz Arena on Saturday as Pep Guardiola's champions extended their record unbeaten Bundesliga run to 46 matches with a 4-0 victory. Guardiola rested several stars ahead of the trip to the Gunners' Emirates Stadium, but still started with 10 internationals. ""We wanted to put in a good performance before the Arsenal game -- now we're looking forward to the Champions League,"" said Neuer. Brazil centre-back Dante opened the scoring when he headed home on 19 minutes, and Swiss Xherdan Shaqiri added the second on 34 minutes after a superb reverse pass from Claudio Pizarro fell into his path and he fired home. The stocky Swiss then added his second just before the break, and veteran striker Pizarro added a fourth two minutes from time. The game ended on a sour note for Shaqiri, though, as he went off with a torn hamstring and will miss the Arsenal match. Guardiola praised his side for a ninth straight victory in all competitions dating back to December's 3-2 defeat at home to Manchester City in the Champions League group stage. ""It is always difficult when the whole world says we have to win,"" said the Spaniard. ""I am very happy, it is unbelievable how the players are always fully concentrated, regardless of what happens. ""We didn't play particularly well this time, but we were serious. ""We only played well in the first 15, 20 minutes, but that's three more points and one game less."" Having won last season's league title with a record six games to spare, Bayern are on course to have the German league title again confirmed early. In contrast, second-placed Bayer Leverkusen, who host Paris Saint-Germain in the last 16 of the Champions League on Tuesday, crashed to another home defeat when they lost 2-1 to Schalke 04. Having suffered a shock 1-0 extra-time defeat at home to second-division Kaiserslautern on Wednesday in the German Cup quarter-finals, Leverkusen stumbled to their fifth defeat in their last seven games. ""I am very pleased with the way the team played today,"" said Leverkusen boss Sami Hyypia, the ex-Liverpool centre-back. ""There was a huge difference with the way we played on Wednesday. ""I'd also be pleased if we played like that on Tuesday. ""The team has shown character, that was bad luck today and I feel for the team."" With Sweden star Zlatan Ibrahimovic leading PSG's attack, Laurent Blanc's side are closing in on back-to-back French league titles and Leverkusen defender Philipp Wollscheid summed up the downbeat mood. ""We just have to keep going. It's a shitty feeling to lose, but we did ok,"" said the 24-year-old Germany central defender. ""We have to get the game out of our legs and heads to focus on PSG."""
351,15/02/2014,13:32,Football: Fulham turn to hardman Magath,"Fulham have recruited Felix Magath to preserve their Premier League status, but with a reputation for big spending and tough training methods, he comes with mixed reviews from the Bundesliga.","All of last week, the German media had touted Magath as a replacement for Dutchman Bert van Marwijk at Hamburg, where ex-Germany international Magath won the 1983 European title as a player. Reports suggest struggling Hamburg could not meet the wage demands of Magath, who was soon raving about England's Premier League as a ""fantastic working environment for every coach and footballer"". Having coached eight Bundesliga teams, this is Magath's first managerial sojourn outside of Germany and his first job in 18 months. First, the good news for Fulham supporters. The 60-year-old won three Bundesliga title with two different clubs, leading Bayern Munich to the league and cup double in both 2004-05 and 2005-06, then Wolfsburg to the 2009 Bundesliga title. He is a fitness fanatic who enjoys sending his squads on long runs, preferably up hills, and has the nickname 'Quelix' -- a crude combination of his first name and the German word for torture. As TV pundit and former Norway international Jan Age Fjortoft put it, from their time together at Eintracht Frankfurt, ""I don't know if Magath would have saved the Titanic, but the survivors would have been fit."" Fjortoft took to Twitter on Friday to sing the praises of his time working with Magath, who saved Frankfurt from relegation in 2000: ""I loved it. I was just too tired sometimes. ""Dear Fulham-fans! Never will you say again: - the players didn't run enough, the players don't train enough or the boss is not clear enough."" But there are plenty of Magath detractors after he left both Schalke and Wolfsburg with little success and a huge wage bill. Magath has had his fair share of either keeping teams up through hard work or being relieved of his duties when relegation was imminent and his players close to revolution. Fjortoft's former Frankfurt teammate Bachirou Salou once famously dubbed Magath ""The last dictator in Europe"" after one long run too many. Despite back-to-back doubles, Magath was dismissed by Bayern in January 2007 with his side fourth in the league, outside the Champions League places in those days. ""Felix Magath likes to use pressure,"" summed up Bayern captain Philipp Lahm in his autobiography. ""He leaves many players in suspense as to whether he needs them and uses this method to get the maximum out of them. ""For the players, he is very demanding, and there comes a point where they no longer stand by the coach's side."" The harmonious spell of four titles in two seasons quickly soured when results refused to go Bayern's way. ""It was a logical farewell,"" said Lahm. ""There was a fatigue-based breakdown between the coach and the team."" Magath then masterminded VfL Wolfsburg's stunning run to the 2009 Bundesliga title, including a 5-1 romp at home to his ex-club Bayern. Strikers Edin Dzeko and Brazilian Grafite both scored twice while play-maker Zvjezdan Misimovic ran riot to embarrass the Bavarian giants. Having earned the plaudits, Magath immediately left to take charge at Schalke 04, finishing his first season as runners-up. But things unravelled at the Royal Blues, where Magath was all-powerful as both director of sport and coach, leading to his dismissal the following season with poor results and a huge wage bill. ""I don't ever want to see Felix Magath again, his number has long since been deleted from my phone,"" fumed Schalke midfielder Jermaine Jones. ""Our time shared at Schalke was unbearable."" Having been dismissed by the Royal Blues in March 2011, Magath was out of a job for less than 48 hours as Wolfsburg asked him to step in after ex-England manager Steve McClaren was sacked. But with the 2009 squad dispersed, Magath failed to bring success back to Wolfsburg despite heavy investment. The team finished mid-table in 2011-12 and he left by mutual consent in October 2012 with his enormous squad bottom of the table with five points from eight matches."
352,14/02/2014,02:10,Football: Bayern welcome back Schweinsteiger as Arsenal await,Bayern Munich hope Germany midfielder Bastian Schweinsteiger will start against Freiburg in the Bundesliga on Saturday as the holders warm-up for next week's Champions League clash at Arsenal.,"The 29-year-old made his comeback after three months out with an ankle injury, playing the last 25 minutes of Wednesday's 5-0 romp at Hamburg in the German Cup quarter-finals. Schweinsteiger is set to feature at Munich's Allianz Arena as the European champions prepare to face the Gunners away in Wednesday's last 16, first leg, of the Champions League. Coach Pep Guardiola welcomed back his midfield general: ""It's super, super, super news, he has huge experience, but he still needs time."" Such is Bayern's strength in depth that they have continued to pick up wins even without the likes of Schweinsteiger and injured France winger Franck Ribery, who is out until March after an operation on his buttocks. Bayern have won all of their last nine matches, are unbeaten in a record 45 league matches and are 13 points clear in the table. Freiburg coach Christian Streich has suggested some unusual tactics against the league leaders -- to make sure Bayern enjoy themselves. ""Bayern should have fun and they only have that when they play against a good opponent,"" said the eccentric Streich, with his side 15th in the league, just above the relegation places. Third-placed Borussia Dortmund are chasing a second win this week over Eintracht Frankfurt at home. Gabon international winger Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang headed home Dortmund's second-half winner at Frankfurt in Tuesday's 1-0 cup quarter-final victory. Frankfurt climbed up to 12th in the table with a 3-0 win at home to bottom side Eintracht Braunschweig last Saturday as they bounced back from their 5-0 drubbing at Bayern the week before. Dortmund are hoping to have Germany midfielders Marco Reus and Sven Bender back after the pair both suffered thigh injuries in last Saturday's 5-1 win over Werder Bremen. ""We'll have to see, we don't want to take a risk with either of them,"" said coach Jurgen Klopp with both expected to train on Friday. There is still no news on when Dortmund midfielder Ilkay Gundogan will return to training after suffering from a virus. Bert van Marwijk is in a precarious position as he takes 17th-placed Hamburg to bottom side Eintracht Frankfurt with huge doubts over his future after a club record of six league defeats. Ex-Bayern, Schalke and Wolfsburg coach Felix Magath has already been widely tipped to replace former Holland coach Van Marwijk, who only took charge in September. Director of sport Oliver Kreuzer said he only has a job guarantee until Saturday, but another defeat could well be the Dutchman's last. Saturday's top clash sees second-side Bayer Leverkusen, who suffered a shock 1-0 cup defeat at home to second-division Kaiserslautern on Wednesday, host fourth-placed Schalke. Schalke were buoyed on Thursday when captain and centre-back Benedikt Hoewedes made a surprise return to training sooner than expected after recovering from a leg injury. ""The healing process has gone very, very well, but he still has a few problems and is still questionable,"" said Schalke coach Jens Keller. Keller said right back Atsuto Uchida has flown back to Japan and could face an operation for a leg injury, while midfielders Julian Draxler and Roman Neustaedter are both in the squad for Leverkusen.

Munich will host second-division Kaiserslautern and Dortmund at home to VfL Wolfsburg with the final at Berlin's Olympic Stadium on May 17. Bayern's Croatia international striker Mario Mandzukic scored a hat-trick at Hamburg as the hosts' defence capitulated in what could be coach Bert van Marwijk's last game in charge.

Having also lost 3-0 at home to Hertha Berlin on Saturday, Hamburg have leaked eight goals without reply in their last two games and are second from bottom in the league.

Germany midfielder Mario Goetze found some space and dribbled to the goal-line, held off his marker and squared for Mandzukic to tap home. Brazil centre-back Dante followed that up with a header four minutes later from a Toni Kroos' corner to give the visitors a 2-0 lead at the break. Holland winger Arjen Robben then chested down a beautiful long ball from Kroos and fired past Hamburg goalkeeper Rene Adler on 54 minutes.

Croatia's Mandzukic then added two more in as many second-half minutes as Bayern finished with a flurry. Having also lost 3-0 at home to Hertha Berlin on Saturday, Hamburg have leaked eight goals without reply in their last two games and are second from bottom in the league. Ex-Holland coach Van Marwijk's position grows every more precarious. With an internal battle raging behind the scenes between Hamburg's Supervisory and Executive boards, Van Marwijk could well have had his last game in charge having only taken charge in September. Ex-Bayern, Schalke and Wolfsburg coach Felix Magath is widely tipped as the favourite to take over. Bayern were rarely troubled and goalkeeper Manuel Neuer needed 15 minutes to get his first touch of the ball and the opening goal came just six minute later. Germany midfielder Mario Goetze found some space and dribbled to the goal-line, held off his marker and squared for Mandzukic to tap home. Brazil centre-back Dante followed that up with a header four minutes later from a Toni Kroos' corner to give the visitors a 2-0 lead at the break. Holland winger Arjen Robben then chested down a beautiful long ball from Kroos and fired past Hamburg goalkeeper Rene Adler on 54 minutes. Mandzukic made it 4-0 when he profited again from another superb piece of skill from Goetze on 74 minutes, then fired home his third with 76 minutes gone. There was more good news for Bayern as Germany midfielder Bastian Schweinsteiger came on for the last 25 minutes after three months out with an ankle injury. Bayern will be joined in the draw for April's semi-finals by Borussia Dortmund, VfL Wolfsburg and second-division Kaiserlautern, who inflicted a shock 1-0 defeat on Bayer Leverkusen. A 114th-minute penalty from Norway midfielder Ruben Jenssen was enough to see Kaiserlautern into the last four as the soul non-Bundesliga representative. Wolfsburg also booked their place with a 3-2 win at Hoffenheim with Swiss defender Ricardo Rodriguez converting two first-half penalties for Wolves, but was then sent off for a second yellow card after 70 minutes. On Tuesday, 2012 German Cup winners Dortmund booked their semi-final berth with Gabon's Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang heading the winner in their 1-0 victory at Eintracht Frankfurt."

""I have to see how things go, I still have a bit of mild pain,"" said the midfielder. Schalke will be without defenders Benedikt Hoewedes and Japan's Atsuto Uchida for the next few weeks, including the Real game, after the pair have both suffered thigh injuries, the club confirmed. Meanwhile, Schalke have confirmed they have signed Germany defender Dennis Aogo until June 2017 on a permanent deal from Hamburg after the left-back joined the Royal Blues on loan last year."

Teenage wunderkind Max Meyer added a second a minute before the break. ""That was a very good performance we put in,"" enthused Schalke coach Jens Keller, who said defender Atsuto Uchida picked up a leg injury and midfielder Roman Neustadter had a badly cut knee.

""It was a very important game for us as we came in with only a four-point lead, so we're very happy,"" said Son. ""It was a good pass and I got the ball in a good position, so it gave me space to shoot. ""It's something I often practice in training and I'm delighted it came off. ""We put the work in today and we deserved the three points."" Lucien Favre's Gladbach started 2014 third in the league, but they suffered their three consecutive defeat on Friday which leaves them down in fifth. Their nightmare run at home to Leverkusen, who they have not beaten in Monechengladbach for 25 years, continued. The last time they beat Bayer at home was their 2-0 win on February 22 1989, less then eight months before the Berlin Wall fell. The hosts had their chances with 14 shots on goal, compared to Bayer's 12, and both Germany striker Max Kruse and winger Patrick Herrmann went close. There was an unusual yellow card handed out by referee Florian Meyer when substitute Philipp Wollscheid was booked while on the bench after only nine minutes. The replacement defender threw a spare ball into play and was swiftly shown a yellow card. Leverkusen have a busy programme as they host Schalke 04 next Saturday before Paris Saint Germain visit them in the Champions League's last 16, first round tie on February 18."

With Holtby out of favour at White Hart Lane, Spurs head coach Tim Sherwood has indicated the Germany midfielder would be allowed to leave with Dortmund poised to take him on loan, but Klopp refused to divulge whether he would take it any further. ""I have heard the name a few times,"" said Klopp in a press conference with the transfer window to close at midnight on Friday. ""I know exactly what we will do, given the situation it would be imprudent not to look, but that doesn't mean we will do anything."" Holtby's agent Marcus Noack denied reports Holtby was already in Germany's Ruhr Valley. ""It looks like that he won't be transferring to the Bundesliga,"" Noack told SID, an AFP subsidiary, after Holtby joined Spurs a year ago from Dortmund's rivals Schalke. ""He is in the squad for the game (Wednesday evening) against Manchester City and is preparing for it. ""He was not in Germany today, yesterday or the day before that."" Third-placed Dortmund have picked up just five points from their last seven league games and badly need to get back to winning ways at bottom side Eintracht Braunschweig on Friday. Klopp has had a boost with Germany centre-back Mats Hummels set to return after a two-month injury lay-off. Hummels tore ankle ligaments in Germany's friendly win over England at Wembley on November 20. The 25-year-old has taken full part in training this week and played a 60-minute warm-up match for the reserves against VfL Bochum on Tuesday. ""It looks positive, he looked really good,"" said Klopp, who lost both his first-choice centre backs last November when Neven Subotic was ruled out for six months after tearing his cruciate knee ligament."

Hildebrand was Germany's third choice 'keeper at the 2006 World Cup when Jurgen Klinsmann's side reached the semi-finals and has picked up seven caps, the last of which was in 2007. According to German press reports, Schalke are planning for the departure by stepping up negotiations to sign Fabian Giefer from second division side Fortuna Dusseldorf.

But Hertha got back on level terms when striker Adrian Ramos hit his 11th goal of the season after Hertha's Sami Allagui pounced on a mistake to put in a cross for the Colombia forward to convert on 23 minutes. Tunisia forward Allagui then gave Hertha the lead by pouncing on a mistake by Dortmund's 18-year-old centre-back Marian Sarr, rounding Dortmund goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller and firing into an empty net on the stroke of half-time. Borussia coach Jurgen Klopp substituted the clearly distressed Sarr for the start of the second-half, moving left-back Kevin Grosskreutz into centre-back, but his side failed to grab a precious equaliser despite seven minutes of added time. Dortmund stay third but will drop to fourth if Borussia Moenchengladbach pick up at least a point at home to VfL Wolfsburg on Sunday. On Saturday evening, Nuremberg, the only team in a major European league without a win so far this season, are bidding to finish 2013 with a maiden victory to move off the bottom of the table when they host Schalke. Eintracht Braunschweig went above Nuremberg with a 1-0 win over Hoffenheim while Freiburg extended Hanover 96's appalling away record to eight consecutive defeats with a 2-1 win to help the hosts in their bid to escape the bottom three. Swiss striker Admir Mehmedi scored two first-half goals to leave Hanover with just one win in their last nine games as Freiburg broke their five-match losing streak before Hanover scored an equaliser through Leonardo Bittencourt. Japan striker Shinji Okazaki hit a late winner after Mainz 05 had scored two goals in three minutes to bounce back from conceding an early goal for a 3-2 win at ten-man Hamburg. Hamburg's Turkey midfielder Hakan Calhanoglu gave the hosts the lead with 21 minutes gone before Okazaki hit Mainz's first on 47 minutes before Germany's Nicolai Mueller grabbed their second three minutes later. Netherlands midfielder Rafael van der Vaart looked to have save Hamburg's blushes with an equaliser 11 minutes from time as the hosts finished with ten men after Venezualan midfielder Tomas Rincon was sent off late on after being shown a second yellow card. But with 94 minutes on the clock Okazaki grabbed his second of the game for a win to lift Mainz to ninth."
380,20/12/2013,02:30,Football: Rivals out to attack absent Bayern's lead,"With runaway leaders Bayern Munich involved in Saturday's Club World Cup final, their Bundesliga rivals Borussia Dortmund and Bayer Leverkusen will be aiming to trim the Bavarians' lead.","Munich hold a seven-point lead at the top of the table and are threatening to again run off with the title, unless their rivals can steal a march with Bayern in Morocco. Second-placed Bayer Leverkusen face Werder Bremen away on Saturday with the hosts winless in their last five games. ""It won't be easy for us but we want to make a good impression in our last match before the winter break and take all three points,"" said Bayer coach Sami Hyypia. Leverkusen can set a new club record of 40 points for the first half of the season with a win at Bremen on what will be the final Bundesliga weekend of 2013. But Bayer slumped to a shock defeat at the hands of strugglers Eintracht Frankfurt last weekend and Bremen plan to follow suit. ""Bayer 04 have been in the leading pack for years but we've got a chance in front of our own fans,"" said Bremen midfielder Clemens Fritz. ""Frankfurt showed the way. Football is always capable of springing a surprise."" Werder coach Robin Dutt was so furious after his side's 3-2 defeat at Hertha Berlin last weekend that he sent the squad for a 4am gym session on their return to Bremen. Dutt is waiting on the fitness of captain Aaron Hunt as the veteran midfielder struggles with a calf injury. ""There is a big question mark against him, he would be a big loss,"" said Dutt. Third-placed Borussia Dortmund, who are 12 points behind Bayern and five adrift of Leverkusen, host Hertha Berlin looking for only their second league win in five games. Four points from those five matches has been a poor return and coach Jurgen Klopp is hoping to get some of his stars off the injured list to try to turn things around. Germany left-back Marcel Schmelzer could feature after a calf tear but it is still too early for defensive midfielder Ilkay Gundogan, who has at least trained with the squad this week. The 23-year-old has not played since injuring his back in Germany's friendly draw against Paraguay in August. And Klopp is also without both centre-backs Neven Subotic and Mats Hummels. Yet rather than looking forward to seeing the back of 2013, he remains eager to get their title challenge back on track. ""I'm not ready yet for Christmas,"" he said. ""We have had a great week of training and we could get down to some good work. The team are up for it."" Nuremberg host Schalke 04 on Saturday evening still looking for their first win of the season -- the only team in Europe's major leagues without a victory so far. Should Dortmund falter against Berlin, fourth-placed Borussia Moenchengladbach can usurp them from third when they host VfL Wolfsburg on Sunday. Gladbach are unbeaten in their last seven games and enjoyed a six-match winning streak before being held to a goalless draw at Mainz last Saturday."
381,16/12/2013,10:54,Football: Record-breaking Bayern dominate in 2013,European champions Bayern Munich begin the quest for their first Club World Cup title on Tuesday having dominated German football in 2013 and finished the year unbeaten in the Bundesliga.,"The Bavarian giants' 3-1 win at home to Hamburg on Saturday means they finish with a new record 93 Bundesliga points for a calendar year and were unbeaten in the German league in 2013. The victory also extended the Champions League winners' unbeaten record in the Bundesliga to 41 games, dating back to October 2012. They launch their Club World Cup campaign in Morocco against China's Asian champions Guangzhou Evergrande FC in Tuesday's semi-finals for a place in Saturday's final. ""2013 has been an unbelievable year for FC Bayern, now we fly to Morocco and try to win our next title,"" said coach Pep Guardiola. Despite losing 3-2 at home to Manchester City last Tuesday, Bayern still finished top of their group to progress to the last 16 of the Champions League as they look to defend the title they won at Wembley in May. The Bavarians run to the 2013 final included a 7-0 drubbing of Barcelona on aggregate in the semi-finals as Bayern became the first German side to win the treble of European, league and cup titles under Jupp Heynckes. Under Heynckes, Bayern set 25 Bundesliga records including the most points (91) and fewest goals conceded (18 over the 34 matches) and show no sign on faltering under new boss Guardiola. Having returned from his year-long sabbatical in New York after winning 14 titles in four years at Barcelona, Guardiola took charge of Bayern in June. Midfielders Thiago Alcantara and Mario Goetze were added to their star-studded squad for this season as Guardiola has brought his own version of Barcelona's tiki-taka football to Bavaria. Bayern now enjoy around 75 percent possession in most league games and humbled Werder Bremen 7-0 in north Germany ten days ago. Guardiola picked up his first title with Bayern in August's UEFA Super Cup when Chelsea were beaten in Prague as the Spaniard enjoyed his eighth win in 16 matches against his rival Jose Mourinho, the former Real Madrid manager. The Bavarians extracted penalty shoot-out revenge after Chelsea had beaten them on spot-kicks to lift the 2012 Champions League title at Munich's Allianz Arena. With the holders through to the German Cup quarter-finals and having reached the Champions League's knock-out stage, Bayern are on course to defend all three titles they won last season. Guardiola has yet to have his full squad available with the likes of stars Javi Martinez, Thiago, Goetze, Bastian Schweinsteiger and Arjen Robben having all spent time on the sidelines recovering from injuries. Having beaten Bundesliga rivals Borussia Dortmund 2-1 at Wembley in May's first all-German Champions League final, the Germans are again flying the flag in Europe with another first. After Dortmund, Bayer Leverkusen and Schalke joined Munich in qualifying for the knock-out phase, Germany will have four teams in the Champions League's knock-out stages for the first time in 2014. At international level, Germany have drawn Portugal, Ghana and the United States Group G at Brazil 2014 with the Germans amongst the favourites to claim their fourth World Cup title having finished third in at South Africa 2010. The Germans' attacking prowess is undeniable with the likes of Goezte alongside Arsenal's Mesut Ozil, Bayern's Thomas Mueller and Dortmund's Marco Reus. But their defence, traditionally Germany's strength, has repeatedly come under fire in 2013. A weakened Germany crashed to a 4-3 defeat to the USA, coached by ex-Germany boss Jurgen Klinsmann, in Washington in June, then fought back from 2-0 down for a 3-3 draw at home to lowly Paraguay in August. The Germans rounded up their Brazil 2014 qualifying campaign with a 5-3 win over Sweden in Stockholm to finish with nine wins from ten games, the 4-4 draw with Sweden in Berlin in October 2012 being the only blot."

The Germans have the joint biggest contingent in the knock-out stages alongside English quartet Manchester City, Manchester United, Chelsea and Arsenal, while three Spanish teams, Real Madrid, Barcelona and Atletico Madrid are also through.

Pep Guardiola's Bayern also went through as group winners, despite losing 3-2 at home to Manchester City on Tuesday, winning five of their six matches. Schalke finished second in Group E after a 2-0 win at home to Swiss champions FC Basel, while Bayer Leverkusen were second in Group A behind Manchester United.

The 43-year-old has been told a decision on his future will be made over the winter break in the wake of the Royal Blues' erratic form this season. Having been knocked out of the German Cup last week and trailing leaders Bayern Munich by 17 points in the Bundesliga, Keller would have been set for dismissal after a year in charge had Schalke failed to go through. Schalke's successful qualification will see them earn 4.5 million euros (US$6.2m). ""No one can understand the pressure the team and I were under,"" said Keller. ""The joy in winning a game like that is huge. ""No one had given us any credit. ""The fact we have reached the knock-out phase is hugely important for the club, especially financially."" The win comes at a cost for Schalke as both Draxler and captain Benedikt Hoewedes face spells on the sidelines having suffered torn leg ligaments. The Royal Blues had to win to go through and faced 10 men for an hour as FC Basel had centre-back Ivan Ivanov, who cleared an early shot off the line, sent off for holding back Schalke's Adam Szalai on 31 minutes. Hoewedes was lucky not to be shown a red card, instead of the yellow he received, on 29 minutes, as he injured himself with a rugby-style tackle on Basel captain Marco Streller, who would have been clear on goal. The breakthrough Schalke desperately needed came on 50 minutes when Farfan swung in a cross and found Draxler unmarked at the far post to slam home his shot and give the Royal Blues the lead. Schalke secured their passage to the knockout phase seven minutes later when their second goal arrived in bizarre fashion. Replays showed that five Schalke players were offside as the ball came into the box from a Farfan free-kick, but the assistant referee did not raise his flag and Matip was left alone to slot past Basel goalkeeper Yann Sommer. ""I had my eyes on the linesman, who didn't react. I was suprised by that,"" admitted Matip. Basel coach Murat Yakin was left protesting incredulously on the sidelines, but the defeat means the Swiss champions finish third in the group and drop into the Europa League. ""We started the game well, our passing was good, we kept calm and had a lot of possession,"" said Yakin after the final whistle. ""Unfortunately, we then had a player sent off, which unbalanced the team.""

Hoewedes was lucky not to be shown a red card, instead of the yellow he received, on 29 minutes, as he injured himself with a rugby-style tackle on Basel captain Marco Streller, who would have been clear on goal. Schalke had the best chance of the first half though, as Jefferson Farfan's cross was cleared onto the crossbar by Basel defender Taulant Xhaka on 12 minutes.

Now Swiss champions Basel and Schalke meet in Gelsenkirchen with Group E's second qualifying berth on the line. Should Chelsea lose at Stamford Bridge against Steaua Bucharest, the winners in Gelsenkirchen will top the group. Third-placed Schalke must beat Basel to reach the last 16 and failure to reach the Champions League's knock-out phase -- which means prize money worth 3.5 million euros (US4.8m) -- could be the final nail in Keller's coffin. ""It's the most important game of the season for us, not just because it means a lot of money for the club,"" Schalke's Germany midfielder Julian Draxler told magazine Kicker. ""And all of us players want to present ourselves well on the big stage. ""That's why Basel is a very, very important game."" Draxler admitted the players need to produce a convincing performance to help keep Keller in office as their recent showings have only heightened calls for his dismissal. ""We have a responsibility to put our foot on the gas and win,"" said the 20-year-old. ""Anything else is up to the club's management."" Schalke's decision makers -- general manager Horst Heldt and Clemens Toennies, head of the advisory board -- have strongly hinted the axe will fall for Keller should Schalke fail to beat Basel. Potential successors have already been mentioned in the German media with ex-Werder Bremen coach Thomas Schaaf a possible contender to replace Keller, who took charge in December last year. The ex-Stuttgart boss still has supporters in the Schalke squad. ""We need to have some tunnel vision, there can be no distractions,"" said goalkeeper Ralf Faehrmann. ""The coach gives us a plan and it's not his fault if we don't stick to it."" Having reached the knock-out phase of the Champions League for the first time two years ago, Basel are eager to repeat the feat and avenge their 1-0 defeat to Schalke in Switzerland at the start of October. The Swiss champions are second in the group and have already shown impressive form on the road this season in Europe. They pulled off a shock 2-1 win over Chelsea in London and are currently top of the Swiss Super League with just one defeat."

Basel are currently on eight points, one behind already-qualified Chelsea and one ahead of Schalke, meaning they could still finish atop the group should they win and Chelsea be held to a draw or lose. Schalke have to go for the victory to ensure they edge the Swiss out of the second qualifying spot in the group. One bad omen for Basel is that the last time they travelled to face German opposition, they suffered a 7-0 hammering at the hands of Bayern Munich in the 2012 round of 16 second leg. Chelsea (ENG) v Steaua Bucharest (ROM) Chelsea have already qualified for the knock-out stages, but still need to beat the Romanians to guarantee pole position in Group E. Beaten 3-2 by Stoke in English Premier League action on the weekend, the west London side have now conceded six goals in their last two games. Coach Jose Mourinho reacted by giving his players a rare day off after the Stoke defeat, saying it would be ""good for their heads"". Steaua are yet to register a victory in Group E, having notched up three draws and two defeats in their five games. In fact the Romanians last won in Champions League action way back in September 2006, against Dynamo Kiev, a 22-game winless streak equalling that of Spartak Moscow (December 2000-November 2006). Group F Napoli (ITA) v Arsenal (ENG) Arsene Wenger's Arsenal will clinch qualification, and top spot, with a draw or a victory in Naples. The Premier League table-toppers will also go through with a defeat by two goals or less. Wenger's side enjoy a good record in Italy and with 12 points, are three ahead of Borussia Dortmund and Rafa Benitez's Napoli. The Italian side must beat Arsenal by three clear goals, should Dortmund also win their match against Marseille - who are yet to pick up a point from five losses in five matches. Marseille (FRA) v Borussia Dortmund (GER) Victory for Jurgen Klopp's Borussia Dortmund over Marseille will keep their hopes alive of a return to the Champions League final for the second straight season. The Bundesliga side will reach the knockout stages by taking maximum points regardless of what happens between Napoli and Arsenal in Italy. Should Dortmund draw, they will progress if Napoli do not win. Dortmund suffered their fourth league defeat of the season on the weekend, a 1-0 loss at home to second-placed Bayer Leverkusen, with Germany midfielder Sven Bender now ruled out of the Marseille game and Turkey international Nuri Sahin a doubt. The winless French club go into the match in disarray, coach Elie Baup replaced last week by long-time Marseille employee Jose Anigo. Group G Austria Vienna (AUT) v Zenit St Petersburg (RUS) The Austrian outfit will be bidding to bow out of the group stage with a face saving first win. However, the Russian side are sure to go for the victory that would ensure they progress even if Porto beat group winners Atletico Madrid in Spain. The hosts, though, are far from sure performers at home losing three European matches in a row already an unwanted team record. Zenit -- who despite being down to 10 men drew 0-0 in the home clash with Austria Vienna -- are effective away from home and have won three of their four away games in this season's competition. Zenit's Belgian centreback Nicolas Lombaerts told uefa.com that he believes the Russians are yet to show their best form. ""We are motivated because we did not manage to qualify last season. I think we gave it away, we gave away points,"" he said. ""It is in our own hands now. It would be a shame if we give it away again. We have to give 100% for one more game and then we should be able to achieve it."" Atletico Madrid (ESP) v Porto (POR) The Spanish side have sailed serenely through qualifying and are guaranteed top spot even before hosting former champions Porto. In a delightful twist of fate Atletico can consign Porto to the Europa League just as the Portuguese side did to them in the 2008/09 campaign and the 2009/10 season to boot. Atletico beat Porto 2-1 in Portugal in their first meeting this season and are likely to repeat the dose again and confirm their status as a danger to the more established sides for the trophy this term. Group H AC Milan (ITA) v Ajax (NED) Milan have had a pretty underwhelming season thusfar and failure to get the draw they need at home to Ajax and secure their place in the Last 16 would all but certainly signal the exit of coach Massimiliano Allegri. For the second consecutive season Milan's run-in to Christmas is anything but festive: they currently sit ninth in Serie A, 22 points behind leaders Juventus and 14 adrift of the first Champions League qualifying spot. They will be looking to Mario Balotelli to be on form both physically and mentally against an Ajax side that despite their deserved 2-1 win at home to Barcelona in the previous round of matches has a woeful away record in the competition having not won on their last six trips abroad. Barcelona (ESP) v Celtic (SCO) The Catalan giants require a point against the Scottish champions to ensure they finish top of the group. Barca will again be without the injured Lionel Messi, Victor Valdes and Dani Alves, but Jordi Alba -- who scored an injury time minute winner when the two sides met at the Camp Nou last season -- returned in the Cup win last Friday against Cartagena after three months out and is expected to start. Celtic have nothing but pride to play for as not even a win would get them Europa League football in the New Year."

Freiburg squandered a couple of clear chances before Wolfsburg's Germany defender Marcel Schafer came off the bench for Olic to score their third in added time. Freiburg remain third from bottom with a third straight defeat and to make matters worse they had French midfielder Francis Coquelin, on loan from Arsenal, carried off with a suspected broken ankle just after the break. Hertha Berlin stayed seventh and kept hosts Eintracht Braunschweig rooted to the bottom of the table with a 2-0 away win. Colombia striker Adrian Ramos headed Berlin into a first-half lead before 20-year-old midfielder Tolga Cigerci added a late second with his first for the club. On Saturday, France star Franck Ribery produced a commanding display as Bayern Munich extended their record unbeaten Bundesliga run to 40 matches with a 7-0 away romp at Werder Bremen. Ribery boosted his claim for the 2013 world footballer of the year award, which will be announced on January 13, by creating two goals and scoring twice in the rout. Bayern, who last lost in the German league in October 2012, produced their biggest win so far under Pep Guardiola, cutting Bremen's defence to tatters. The victory was short of the Bundesliga's 57-year-old record of 9-0 for an away win and was Werder's heaviest home league defeat. Bremen coach Robin Dutt kept the team on the pitch for a stern lecture as they dropped to 14th after just two wins in their last 10 games. Belgium's Daniel van Buyten, Croatia's Mario Mandzukic plus Germany's Thomas Mueller and Mario Goetze also joined Ribery on the scoresheet after Bremen scored an own goal. Second-placed Bayer Leverkusen stayed four points behind Bayern with a hard-fought 1-0 win at third-placed Borussia Dortmund, who now find themselves six points behind Leverusen and ten points behind Munich. South Korea striker Son Heung-Min hit the 18th-minute winner after Leverkusen's attack pounced on a mistake by Dortmund defender Manuel Friedrich for Son to score his fifth goal in his last three games against Borussia. Both sides finished with 10 men in a tense affair. Dortmund lost both defensive midfielders Sven Bender and Nuri Sahin during the match with ankle injuries. Germany's Bender has been ruled out of Wednesday's Champions League game at Marseille with a sprained ankle, while Sahin has a torn ligament and is rated extremely doubtful.

390,08/12/2013,17:33,Football: Wolves floor Freiburg to extend unbeaten run,VfL Wolfsburg extended their unbeaten run to eight matches with a 3-0 win at strugglers Freiburg on Sunday to climb up to fifth in the Bundesliga table.,"Wolves raced into a 2-0 lead after only 11 minutes as Germany Under-21 forward Maximilian Arnold netted with a deft touch before ex-Bayern Munich star Luiz Gustavo laid the ball off for Croatia's Ivica Olic to blast home. Freiburg squandered a couple of clear chances before Wolfsburg's Germany defender Marcel Schafer came off the bench for Olic to score their third in added time. Freiburg remain third from bottom with a third straight defeat and to make matters worse they had French midfielder Francis Coquelin, on loan from Arsenal, carried off with a suspected broken ankle just after the break. On Saturday, France star Franck Ribery produced a commanding display as Bayern Munich extended their record unbeaten Bundesliga run to 40 matches with a 7-0 away romp at Werder Bremen. Ribery boosted his claim for the 2013 world footballer of the year award, which will be announced on January 13, by creating two goals and scoring twice in the rout. Bayern, who last lost in the German league in October 2012, produced their biggest win so far under Pep Guardiola, cutting Bremen's defence to tatters. The victory was short of the Bundesliga's 57-year-old record of 9-0 for an away win and was Werder's heaviest home league defeat. Bremen coach Robin Dutt kept the team on the pitch for a stern lecture as they dropped to 14th after just two wins in their last 10 games. Belgium's Daniel van Buyten, Croatia's Mario Mandzukic plus Germany's Thomas Mueller and Mario Goetze also joined Ribery on the scoresheet after Bremen scored an own goal. Second-placed Bayer Leverkusen stayed four points behind Bayern with a hard-fought 1-0 win at third-placed Borussia Dortmund, who now find themselves six points behind Leverusen and ten points behind Munich. South Korea striker Son Heung-Min hit the 18th-minute winner after Leverkusen's attack pounced on a mistake by Dortmund defender Manuel Friedrich for Son to score his fifth goal in his last three games against Borussia.

391,08/12/2013,15:06,Football: Schalke's Keller under pressure for Basel clash,Schalke 04 coach Jens Keller faces a make-or-break Champion League clash against Swiss champions FC Basel on Wednesday with a third-straight defeat likely to cost the 43-year-old his job.,"Having been dumped out of the German Cup last Tuesday by a shock 3-1 home defeat to Hoffenheim, on Saturday Schalke lost 2-1 at fourth-placed Borussia Moenchengladbach, who opened a seven-point gap over fifth-placed Schalke in the Bundesliga. With the Royal Blues now 17 points behind Bundesliga leaders Bayern Munich and out of the German Cup, a Champions League exit -- albeit with entry to the Europa League if they finish third in Group E -- would end their interest in all three major competitions. And it could well be Keller's last game in charge having taken over in December last year. ""You need to ask those in charge who make those decisions,"" Keller replied tersely when asked about his future after Wednesday' match at Gelsenkirchen's Veltins Arena. ""Yes,"" said Schalke's general manager Horst Heldt when aked if Keller would be in charge for Wednesday's match, but he refused to comment when asked about next Sunday's home Bundeliga game against Freiburg. Clemens Toennies, head of Schalke's advisory board, said it is all about results now. ""Now is not the time to address the question about the coach,""  Toennies told magazine Sport Bild. ""It's all about winning our next few games."" Schalke are a side badly in need of a confidence boost after suffering their eighth defeat of the season in all competitions at 'Gladbach. The Royal Blues can justifiably argue they were the victims of some harsh decisions by referee Felix Zwayer at Moenchengladbach. With the scores level at 1-1, Schalke captain Benedikt Hoewedes was sent off for a second yellow card after a shot on goal ricocheted off his upper arm, earning the Germany defender a red card following an earlier yellow. To make matters worse, striker Max Kruse converted the resulting penalty, on the stroke of half-time, which proved to be Moenchengladbach's winner. ""That was not a penalty, I was turning myself out of the way (of the ball) and it's a pity the game was decided by a goal like that,"" said Hoewedes. Gladbach coach Lucien Favre agreed with the Schalke defender. ""The red-yellow against Hoewedes was, from my perspective, too harsh. Perhaps it's the rules, but it wasn't necessary,"" said the Swiss coach. Only a superb save from Borussia goalkeeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen, deep in extra-time, from a Kevin-Prince Boateng header denied Schalke an equaliser as their luck deserted them. Hoewedes admitted Wednesday's game is ""all-or-nothing"" now with regards to their season."

""We are all happy, but we must continue to play like that,"" said Ribery as the European champions warmed up for Tuesday's Champions League match at home to Manchester City. ""This team has a great mentality, it makes it fun to play."" Bayern, who last lost in the German league in October 2012, produced their biggest win so far under Pep Guardiola, cutting Bremen's defence to tatters. ""I must say a big thank you to my team, they played very, very well,"" beamed Guardiola. The victory was just short of the Bundesliga's 57-year-old record of 9-0 for an away win. ""It was an honour to coach them today, but I know Bremen can play much better than that."" Bremen coach Robin Dutt kept the team on the pitch for a stern lecture as they dropped to 14th after just two wins in their last 10 games. ""The defeat has shocked us, of course, but it won't throw us off the rails,"" said Dutt, who took charge in July, but has suffered seven defeats in 15 league games. ""There will be a lot said about this until our next game against (Hertha) Berlin (on Friday), but we have to stay very focused on what has become an important game for us."" Ribery, who started his first Bundesliga match for nearly a month after a rib injury, gave Bayern the lead when his cross was turned into the net for an own goal by Werder's Congo defender Assani Lukimya on 21 minutes. Towering Belgian centre-back Daniel van Buyten then doubled Bayern's lead six minutes later when he headed home from a corner before Ribery added their third on 38 minutes when he simply tapped home Thomas Mueller's cross from the right wing. With exactly an hour gone, Ribery provided the cross for Croatia striker Mario Mandzukic to fire into an empty net for the fourth. And six minutes later, Germany midfielder Mario Goetze picked out Mueller in the thick of the Bremen defence to fire home for Bayern's fifth with 68 minutes gone. Ribery capped an eye-catching display when he converted left-back David Alaba's cross on 82 minutes before Goetze powered past tired defenders to hit Munich's seventh with 90 minutes gone. With second-placed Bayer Leverkusen at third-placed Borussia Dortmund on Saturday night in the key clash of the weekend, Bayern have opened a seven-point gap at the top of the table. Fourth-placed Borussia Moenchengladbach stayed in touch with the league leaders as they picked up their sixth-straight win with a 2-1 win at home to Schalke 04, whose coach Jens Keller has been told a decision on his future will be made over the winter break. Schalke must beat Swiss champions FC Basel on Wednesday to reach the Champions League's knock-out phase and another defeat could be Keller's last having taken charge of the Royal Blues in December 2012. Eintracht Frankfurt stay just above the relegation places after losing 2-1 at home to Hoffenheim while Hamburg, who had been steadily climbing the table under ex-Holland manager Bert van Marwijk, slumped to a 1-0 defeat at home to Augsburg.

Bundesliga side Schalke have failed to settle on a regular goalkeeper since Germany's Manuel Neuer joined Bayern Munich in July 2011 and Giefer is a highly regarded prospect having risen up through Germany's junior ranks. Sam made the last of his five appearances for Germany in last month's 1-0 win over England at Wembley.

Bayern already have injury concerns with captain Philipp Lahm and star midfielder Bastian Schweinsteiger both out, but France winger Franck Ribery should be back in Bremen after a rib injury. Robben was left with a cut to the bone on his right knee having been stretchered off after scoring in Wednesday's 2-0 German Cup win at Augsburg which put Bayern in the quarter-finals. After scoring in each of his last four games for Bayern, Robben's injury is a blow, but Pep Guardiola's side show no signs of slowing down in their quest for more silverware. The European champions last lost in the Bundesliga in October 2012 and are already in the last 16 of the Champions League, have booked their quarter-final berth in the German Cup on Wednesday and are four points clear in the league. But the Bavarians are refusing to rest on their laurels with director of sport Matthias Sammer inisting there is plenty more to come. ""We have only been German champions once in the last three years,"" said Sammer. ""There is this stupid debate about how dominant we are, which is superficial and implies we should win games like this, just by turning up."" But Bayern are certainly able to see off most of their Bundesliga rivals without too much effort, as they proved in last Saturday's 2-0 lacklustre win at home to bottom side Eintracht Braunschweig. Bayern are used to around 75 percent possession in league games and Werder coach Robin Dutt said there is no secret to beating the Bavarians. ""The first trick is to run, the second is to run some more and the third is to keep running,"" he quipped. Having dropped to third after losing back-to-back league matches, Dortmund can regain second place by beating Bayer Leverkusen at home in Saturday's key game. The hosts are waiting on the fitness of midfielders Sven Bender, who broke his nose against Napoli, and Nuri Sahin, who has a leg injury. Germany winger Marco Reus, who has a bruised calf, is improving, with a decision to be made after the final training session. ""There will be no excuses on Saturday,"" said Klopp, whose side will also need to win at Marseille on Wednesday to reach the last 16 of the Champions League. ""This is a difficult game for both teams. ""We have now got used to having a few players missing and we have adjusted well."" Schalke are at fourth-placed Borussia Moenchengladbach on Saturday with coach Jens Keller needing a win having been told his job is only guaranteed until Christmas. Schalke were dumped out of the German Cup with a 3-1 defeat at home to Hoffenheim and must beat Swiss champions FC Basel at home on Wednesday to go through to the last 16 of the Champions League.

405,25/11/2013,02:01,"Football: Chelsea look to seal progress, Dortmund in danger","Four teams have already qualified for the last 16 ahead of matchday five of this season's Champions League group phase. On Tuesday, Chelsea can also clinch progress with just a point in Switzerland, while Arsenal could wrap up qualification too.","Group E FC Basel (SUI) v Chelsea (ENG) Knocked out in the group stage last season as the defending champions, Chelsea need just a draw against Basel in Switzerland to clinch their place in the last 16, and a fourth successive win in Group E will see the Blues advance as winners of the section. Chelsea won at St Jakob-Park last season in the semi-finals of the Europa League but will be wary of the Swiss champions, having lost 2-1 when they met in London in September. Chelsea come into the game fresh from a 3-0 win at West Ham United that left them in third place in the Premier League. They have lost just one of their last 13 games in all competition, while Basel remain clear at the top of the Swiss Super League and have lost just once in 19 outings. Steaua Bucharest (ROM) v Schalke 04 (GER) Schalke come into matchday five in second place in Group E, and a win in Romania coupled with a defeat for Basel against Chelsea will see the Bundesliga club through to the knockout stages. The Royal Blues were comfortable 3-0 winners when the sides met in Gelsenkirchen in September but they can be infuriatingly inconsistent and threw away a two-goal lead before needing a late Benedikt Hoewedes equaliser to earn a 3-3 draw at Eintracht Frankfurt in the Bundesliga on Saturday. Coach Jens Keller described that result as ""maddening"". He is still without long-term injured Klaas-Jan Huntelaar for the visit to the Romanian capital to face a Steaua side who are unbeaten domestically but without a win in Group E. Group F Arsenal (ENG) v Marseille (FRA) Arsenal will look to close in on a place in the last 16 by inflicting a fifth defeat in five games in this season's competition on Marseille. If the Gunners win at the Emirates Stadium, they will qualify for the last 16 should Borussia Dortmund fail to win at home to Napoli. A draw will be enough if Dortmund lose. Meanwhile, Marseille are already eliminated but could yet steal third place and a Europa League berth with the right combination of results. That seems unlikely, though, especially with coach Elie Baup having fitness concerns over Andre-Pierre Gignac and Mathieu Valbuena. Premier League leaders Arsenal - who won 2-1 in southern France in September - welcomed back Theo Walcott after injury in Saturday's Premier League victory over Southampton. Borussia Dortmund (GER) v Napoli (ITA) Last season's beaten Champions League finalists Borussia Dortmund could be eliminated with one round of group games still to play if they fail to beat Napoli in Germany and Arsenal beat Marseille. Such a threat is very real for Jurgen Klopp's team, who suffered a shattering 3-0 home defeat at the hands of Bayern Munich in the Bundesliga on Saturday as they struggle to cope with a defensive injury crisis. Neven Subotic, Mats Hummels and Marcel Schmelzer are all sidelined. Napoli beat Dortmund 2-1 in Italy and a win here will seal their place in the last 16. However, they also come into the game on the back of a disappointing domestic result at the weekend, a 1-0 home loss to Parma damaging their title prospects in Serie A. Group G FC Porto (POR) v Austria Vienna (AUT) Two-time European champions Porto need to win at home to Austria Vienna at the Estadio do Dragao as they chase Zenit for second place in Group G and a spot in the last 16. The Portuguese side won 1-0 in Vienna in September thanks to a second-half Lucho Gonzalez goal but have taken just one point in their subsequent three matches, losing at home to Zenit and Atletico Madrid. Paulo Fonseca's side are undefeated in their domestic league just now and sit top, but were held to a 1-1 draw at home by Nacional on Saturday, leaving the pitch at full-time to jeers from their supporters. Those fans will not tolerate another slip-up against an Austrian side who have registered just one point in Group G so far and failed to score a single goal. Zenit St Petersburg (RUS) v Atletico Madrid (ESP) Atletico are already through to the last 16 as the only side apart from defending champions Bayern Munich to win their first four group games. Diego Simeone's side are already certain to finish first in Group G too, so the Argentine coach has rested key players for the trip into a Russian winter, Diego Costa and David Villa among those left at home. The clash with Zenit comes on the back of a stunning 7-0 win against Getafe that kept them in contention at the top of La Liga. Zenit have only won once so far in the group and were beaten 3-1 in Madrid in September, but a win at the Petrovski stadium will take them through to the last 16 should Porto fail to win later on Tuesday. Group H Ajax (NED) v Barcelona (ESP) Remarkably, Barcelona's 4-0 win against Ajax in September was the first ever competitive meeting of two European giants linked by iconic former player and coach Johan Cruyff. Now they meet in Amsterdam for the first time, with Barcelona already through to the last 16 and needing just a point to be sure of winning Group H. The Catalans - who are top of La Liga - are without a host of injured players just now, including world player of the year Lionel Messi and goalkeeper Victor Valdes. Ajax beat Celtic in their last group game to keep alive their chances of progressing and come into this match fresh from a 3-0 win against Heracles in the Eredivisie at the weekend. Celtic (SCO) v AC Milan (ITA) This tie at Celtic Park is a crunch encounter in the race for the second qualifying spot in Group H. Milan head to Glasgow in second place and will be through if they win and Ajax lose at home to Barcelona. However, the Rossoneri are a club in crisis just now, their 1-1 weekend draw with Genoa leaving them in the bottom half of Serie A and sparking protests from angry fans. Celtic are bottom of the group but they are a formidable prospect at home and beat Milan 2-1 in Glasgow's East End in the group stage of the competition in 2007. A repeat this time would take the Hoops above Massimiliano Allegri's side in the standings."

But Bert van Marwijk's Hamburg brushed off the loss of their skipper to claim their first home win in six attempts. ""It was a hard-fought victory for us with both teams under pressure. Hanover are going through a difficult time while we needed to finally win at home,"" said Van Marwijk. ""We haven't improved much, but we are better organised and we gave fewer balls away."" Hanover's Hungary midfielder Szabolcs Huszti put his side ahead when he hit the top left corner from 16 metres with 28 minutes gone. But the hosts responded with Croatia's Milan Badelj equalising three minutes later before right-wing Maximilian Beister slipped his marker just a minute into the second-half to head home. Beister then turned provider as he found 19-year-old Turkey midfielder Hakan Calhanoglu in space and the attacking midfielder fired home for the third six minutes from time. Hanover's Senegal defender Salif Sane was sent off in the dying stages for a second yellow card to compound the guests' misery. It was Hanover's eighth match without a win, their sixth straight away defeat, and saw Mirko Slomka's side drop to 13th in the league. Werder Bremen slumped to 12th and their third defeat in four games, as they went down 3-2, despite a late fight back, at home to seventh-placed Mainz 05, for whom Japan's Shinji Okazaki scored twice. On Saturday, Bayern Munich's Germany star Mario Goetze came off the bench to score the opening goal in the European champions' comprehensive 3-0 win at his ex-club Borussia Dortmund. Goetze, who joined Bayern for 37 million euros (US$50m) in July after 12 years at Dortmund, gave the perfect reply to the chorus of boos he received on his return to Borussia's Westfalenstadion. The 21-year-old smashed home a Thomas Mueller pass on 66 minutes, before the floodgates opened and Arjen Robben and Mueller added late goals in the final five minutes. Bayern capped a commanding performance by beating Dortmund for the first time in seven Bundesliga attempts, dating back to February 2010. It was Munich's first win in Dortmund since September 2009. ""We're happy, we won against the best counter-attacking team in the world,"" said Bayern coach Pep Guardiola. Again, Munich ran out winners in a replay of May's Champions League final as Dortmund had been forced to patch together their entire back four after a spate of injuries. But there can be no excuses as Bayern extended their record unbeaten run in the Bundesliga to 38 matches and opened a seven-point lead over Dortmund, who drop to third. Bayer Leverkusen warmed up for Wednesday's Champions League clash at home to Manchester United by going second with a 1-0 win at Hertha Berlin. The win came at a cost as Germany winger Sidney Sam was ruled out of the United clash after tearing a thigh muscle four minutes into the game. Sixth-placed Schalke, who are away to Steaua Bucharest in the Champions League on Tuesday and are second in Group E behind Chelsea, drew 3-3 at Eintracht Frankfurt. They raced into a 2-0 lead after only 18 minutes but leaked three goals in 12 disastrous second-half minutes. Germany defender Benedikt Hoewedes saved Schalke's blushes when he hit the top-right hand corner to equalise with just four minutes left. Wolfsburg's four-match winning streak, which has seen them climb to fifth in the league, was ended when they were held to a 1-1 draw at second-from-bottom Nuremberg. Freiburg stay in the relegation places despite their 1-0 win at bottom side Eintracht Braunschweig, while Augsburg are up to tenth after their 2-0 win at Hoffenheim. On Friday, Borussia Moenchengladbach stayed fourth with a 2-0 win at VfB Stuttgart, their fourth straight win, with goals by Brazil's Raffael and Sweden's Oscar Wendt."

On Saturday, European champions Bayern Munich set a new record for the longest unbeaten run in Bundesliga history with a 3-0 victory at home to Augsburg. Bayern have now gone 37 league matches since their last defeat, at Bayer Leverkusen in October 2012, breaking Hamburg's previous record of 36 from January, 1983. Pep Guardiola's Bayern face their biggest test in a fortnight when they travel to second-placed Borussia Dortmund in a repeat of last season's Champions League final. Guardiola also set a personal record as he celebrated his 12th league match without defeat -- with 32 pointsa it's the best start by a new Bundesliga coach in the league's history. The Champions League holders opened the scoring at Munich's Allianz Arena when Germany centre-back Jerome Boateng headed home from a corner after just five minutes. France winger Franck Ribery then smashed home a free-kick on 42 minutes before Germany's Thomas Mueller netted a penalty in the fifth minute of injury time. Bayern, who have won 31 of their last 37 Bundesliga matches, were without Germany's Bastian Schweinsteiger, who will miss the forthcoming internationals against Italy and England with an ankle injury. It was Bayern's second milestone of the week after they equalled Barcelona's record from the 2002/03 season of nine consecutive Champions League wins with a 1-0 midweek success at Viktoria Pilsen. Breaking records is nothing remarkable for Bayern these days having set or equalled 25 league markers under Guardiola's predecessor Jupp Heynckes last season. Bayern also extended their lead at the top of the table to four points as second-placed Dortmund went down 2-1 at VfL Wolfsburg. It was Dortmund's second defeat of the week after losing 1-0 at home to Arsenal in the Champions League. After Germany winger Marco Reus put Dortmund ahead with a thunderbolt of a free-kick on the stroke of half-time, Wolves hit back to pick up their fourth straight victory to leave them fifth. Swiss defender Ricardo Rodriguez smashed home a free kick before Croatia striker Ivica Olic hit a great goal in off the far post with 20 minutes left. Third-placed Bayer Leverkusen are level with Dortmund on 28 points after beating Hamburg 5-3 with South Korea's star striker Son Heung-Min scoring a hat-trick. Son completed his hat-trick within 55 minutes before setting up Stefan Kiessling for Leverkusen's fourth. Borussia Moenchengladbach scored three goals in the last 18 minutes to come from behind and seal a 3-1 win at home to Nuremberg to stay fourth. Schalke 04 bounced back from their Champions League defeat at Chelsea as they came from behind to beat Werder Bremen 3-1, with Ghana midfielder Kevin-Prince Boateng netting two headers.

Bayern have now gone 37 league matches since their last defeat, at Bayer Leverkusen in October 2012, breaking Hamburg's previous record of 36 from January, 1983. Pep Guardiola's Bayern face their biggest test in a fortnight when they travel to second-placed Borussia Dortmund in a repeat of last season's Champions League final. Guardiola also set a personal record as he celebrated his 12th league match without defeat -- the best start by a new Bundesliga coach in the league's history with 32 points. The Champions League holders opened the scoring at Munich's Allianz Arena when Germany centre-back Jerome Boateng headed home from a corner after just five minutes. France winger Franck Ribery then smashed home a direct free-kick on 42 minutes before Germany's Thomas Mueller netted a penalty in the fifth minute of injury time. Bayern, who have won 31 of their last 37 Bundesliga matches, were without Germany's Bastian Schweinsteiger, who will miss the forthcoming internationals against Italy and England with an ankle injury. It was Bayern's second milestone of the week after they equalled Barcelona's record from the 2002/03 season of nine consecutive Champions League wins with a 1-0 at Viktoria Pilsen. Breaking records is nothing remarkable for Bayern these days having set or equalled 25 league records under Guardiola's predecessor Jupp Heynckes last season. Heynckes stood down in May, with his side unbeaten in their previous 25 league games, after Bayern won the treble of European, cup and Bundesliga titles last season. Bayern also extended their lead at the top of the table to four points as second-placed Borussia Dortmund went down 2-1 at VfL Wolfsburg. It was Dortmund's second defeat of the week after losing to 1-0 at home to Arsenal in the Champions League. After Germany winger Marco Reus put Dortmund ahead with a thunderbolt of a free kick on the stroke of half-time, Wolves hit back to pick up their fourth straight victory to leave them fifth. Swiss defender Ricardo Rodriguez smashed home a free kick before Croatia striker Ivica Olic hit a great goal in off the far post with 20 minutes left. Dortmund defender Neven Subotic out for at least six months with torn knee ligaments. Third-placed Bayer Leverkusen are level with Dortmund on 28 points after beating Hamburg 5-3 with South Korea's star striker Son Heung-Min scoring a hat-trick. Son scored after nine and 16 minutes before hitting his third on 55 minutes, before setting up Stefan Kiessling for Leverkusen's fourth. Borussia Moenchengladbach scored three goals in the last 18 minutes to come from behind and seal a 3-1 win at home to Nuremberg to stay fourth in the table. Schalke bounced back from their Champions League defeat at Chelsea as they came from behind to beat Werder Bremen 3-1 with Ghana midfielder Kevin-Prince Boateng netting two headers. Hertha Berlin stayed seventh after their 3-2 win at Hoffenheim with Colombia's Adrian Ramos scoring two goals, including the winning goal when he headed the winner six minutes from time."

He now has a chance to become Germany's leading goalscorer of all time, currently sharing the benchmark of 68 goals with Gerd Mueller. Bayern Munich midfielder Schweinsteiger is out of contention as he requires further surgery on his problem right ankle. Loew's squad features a first call-up for Borussia Dortmund goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller. The 33-year-old has pressed home his claim for inclusion thanks to some fine performances for Dortmund in both the Bundesliga and in Europe, where he helped his side make it to the Champions League final last season. ""We've followed with interest his constant results with Dortmund in the Bundesliga and Champions League,"" explained Loew, who emphasised that Bayern's Manuel Neuer remained his number one 'keeper. Despite Schweinsteiger's absence, Bayern have six of their players on the list including captain Philipp Lahm. Arsenal are doubly represented through Mesut Ozil and Per Mertesacker, while there is one other player from the Premier League in Andre Schuerrle. The Chelsea winger produced a second-half hat-trick in Germany's 5-2 comeback win against Sweden in their final qualifier last month. Germany, who went through qualifying unbeaten to secure their berth in Brazil, face Italy in Milan on November 15 followed by England at Wembley four days later. The Italy game will be Loew's 100th in charge of Germany.

419,05/11/2013,15:17,Football: Torres out of Schalke clash,Fernando Torres has been ruled out of Chelsea's Champions League clash with Schalke on Wednesday and will have scans to determine the extent of his muscular problem.,"Torres suffered the injury in training and will not return until after the international break at the earliest. It means the Spain striker, who scored twice in Chelsea's 3-0 Group E win over Schalke in Germany last month, is unavailable for a match at Stamford Bridge where Blues manager Jose Mourinho has demanded a response following a 2-0 Premier League defeat at Newcastle United last weekend. ""Fernando has a muscular injury,"" Mourinho told reporters at Chelsea's training ground in Cobham, south of London, on Tuesday. ""We don't know the dimension but we await the scans. ""But he is out for this game and out for the weekend too. After that comes an international break. Let's see if he can recover after that,"" the Portuguese added. Torres's injury comes at a bad time for Mourinho as he wants his team back on track after defeat at St James' Park ended a run of six successive wins. Mourinho has pointed the finger at a change of mentality and complacency in his squad as a reason for the London club's poor performance in the north-east on Saturday. ""Sometimes, when you win a lot of times, players forget why they win,"" he explained. ""Probably they forgot why they won against Schalke, they won against Arsenal, against Manchester City. ""When you win three, four, five matches they forget why they won and think they win just because they are good. ""But there are many other ingredients in football that make you a consistent winner. ""I hope now they don't forget why they won a lot of matches and why they lost against Newcastle,"" added Mourinho, now in his second spell as Chelsea manager. ""If they have that clear in their minds, they'll be fine."" Mourinho revealed he angrily confronted his players at half-time against Newcastle when, even though the game was still goalless, he sensed something wasn't right. ""Suddenly you get a match where you become a little bit complacent. It's the mistake not just of football players, but human beings. ""Maybe I was also influenced by the way they grew up so fast as a team, and the way they could play so fast to compete in that week. ""They coped very, very well with the pressure we put on ourselves in the Champions League. ""They reacted so well under that pressure, winning six crucial points for us. ""So maybe I was also caught by surprise. But the only difference is, during the first half, it looked like they were not feeling it and I was feeling it. ""You cannot think you win because you have a nice shirt or are in a good run or a lucky moment. If you think like that, you're in trouble. ""You can never forget why you are winning matches. Maybe we forgot."" Mourinho is unlikely to change the entire team from the Newcastle defeat, despite saying afterwards he made 11 selection mistakes. However, Ryan Bertrand has also been ruled out with a training-ground injury. Meanwhile Mourinho said he remained wary of the threat posed by Schalke. ""First of all, their record away is very good. Not just in the Bundesliga but also in European competitions. ""They have very good results away, which means they feel much more comfortable playing away than at home."""

Group E Chelsea (ENG) v Schalke 04 (GER) Chelsea host Schalke smarting from their shock 2-0 defeat at Newcastle at the weekend, a defeat that could lead Blues boss Jose Mourinho to tinker with his line-up. After an opening loss to Basel Chelsea have got into their European stride, with impressive wins against Steaua Bucharest and at Schalke last time out. ""We are in a stable position to qualify in the Champions League but if we lose again we are in a difficult position,"" Mourinho warned. Schalke, sharing top spot with Chelsea on six points, travel to Stamford Bridge on the back of a 2-0 win over Hertha Berlin in the Bundesliga. Basel (SUI) v Steaua Bucharest (ROM) Basel came away from Bucharest with a disappointing draw a fortnight ago which left them in third and on target for a post-Christmas ticket to the Europa League. After upsetting Chelsea in their first group game though they will be anxious to bag all the points here to keep them in the running for a place in the knockout stages. Group F Borussia Dortmund (GER) v Arsenal (ENG) Dortmund ruined Arsene Wenger's 64th birthday celebrations with a 2-1 win at the Emirates a fortnight ago. Dortmund 'keeper Roman Weidenfeller is wary of a reaction, saying: ""We have irritated them with our win in London. Now they want to strike back."" The Bundesliga outfit could not be in better shape, meting out a 6-1 drubbing to Vfb Stuttgart last Friday. Arsenal, second on goal difference to Dortmund, make the trip in good heart themselves having seen off Liverpool 2-0 to pull five points clear in the Premier League. Wenger said: ""We go to Dortmund now and we were very disappointed with how we lost to them. It was a very sloppy goal when we were in control but we got a good result in Germany last season against Bayern Munich. So we have been there before and are used to the atmosphere over there and hopefully we can get a good result."" Napoli (ITA) v Marseille (FRA) Rafael Benitez's Napoli are on a three-match winning run in Serie A, and host Marseille after a 2-1 win at the Velodrome on matchday three. That's left the Italians bang in contention for a place in the knockout round, level on six points with Dortmund and Arsenal, while for pointless Marseille, who ended a five match losing run in Ligue 1 on Saturday, it's a case of win or bust. The Italians are without right back Giandomenico Mesto, who underwent knee surgery on Monday. Group G Zenit St Petersburg (RUS) v FC Porto (POR) Zenit can steal a march on Porto for the runners-up spot by beating them on Wednesday and open up a four point gap with two games remaining. The Russian side made heavy weather of beating Porto in their match a fortnight ago as the hosts played most of the match with only 10 men. Zenit, though, go into the game having seen their eight match winning streak ended at the weekend with a 1-1 draw by Amkar Perm. Porto too were held to a surprise draw, 1-1 away at unheralded Belenenses. Porto boast a good away record away against Russian sides, winning four and losing one, while Zenit have never lost at home to Portuguese clubs in five matches. Atletico Madrid (ESP) v Austria Vienna (AUT) Atletico have made light work of a weak group and can seal their place in the Last 16 -- for the first time since the 2008/09 campaign -- with victory over an Austrian team they outclassed last month in a 3-0 win. A win for Atletico would also set a new club record of four successive wins in European club football's premier competition, beating the three in the 1958/59 season. Atletico warmed up for the game with a comfortable 2-0 win at home to Athletic Bilbao on Sunday for their 11th win in 12 La Liga games. Coach Diego Simeone will be looking to his Brazilian-born striker Diego Costa to inflict more pain on their opponents after he scored a double against them in the first match. ""It's not just his goals, in his participation in the play and the connection he has with the other players he makes the team better,"" purred Simeone of his leading scorer, who has more than made up for the sale of Falcao in the close season. Group H Ajax (NED) v Celtic (SCO) Ajax need at least a point from this game if they are not to be in serious danger of missing out even on third spot and a place in the Europa League. Celtic by contrast will be seeking a repeat of the win they grabbed against the Dutch side last month which reignited hopes of qualifying for the knockout stages for the second successive season. Ajax have made their worst ever start to a CL campaign while Celtic are bidding to avoid a third successive away defeat. Celtic manager Neil Lennon says that he wants his players to take their chances otherwise it could prove very costly. His Ajax counterpart, though, Frank de Boer believes that if his young team repeat the performance they produced against Celtic in the first game they will take the points. ""If we play like that again in two weeks, then we will beat them in the Amsterdam ArenA. I really believe in that."" Barcelona (ESP) v AC Milan (ITA) Barcelona can all but seal their place in the Last 16 with victory at home to a woefully out of sorts and injury-hit Milan side. Barcelona's worries are small by comparison to the Italians, who have made their worst start to a Serie A season in over 20 years, their loss to Fiorentina at the weekend their fifth of the season already. However, coach Massimiliano Allegri appears to be benefiting from some unaccustomed patience from the club directors who have called for no one to panic. However defeat in Barcelona and a Celtic win would really heap pressure on them in the chase for the second spot. The Scottish side are yet to host them and will fancy their chances of avenging an unfortunate defeat at the San Siro."
422,01/11/2013,02:30,Football: More records in sight as Bayern go to Hoffenheim,Bayern Munich have their eyes set on equalling a 30-year-old record for the Bundesliga's longest unbeaten run as they prepare to go to Hoffenheim on Saturday.,"Following their treble-winning 2012-13 campaign in which they broke one record after another, the outgoing Jupp Heynckes appeared to have left his successor Pep Guardiola with a thankless task. But Guardiola has picked up where Heynckes left off and has already equalled Bayern's longest ever unbeaten start to a Bundesliga season, set in 1968/69. As a result, the reigning champions are now undefeated in their domestic league in 35 games in over a year and a draw or a win at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim on Saturday will see them match the previous best mark set by Hamburg between January 1982 and January 1983. ""Our target and ambition is to take all three points in Hoffenheim,"" left-back David Alaba said this week. ""But obviously, we know Hoffenheim will make it as hard as they can for us in front of their home crowd. Hoffenheim are much stronger compared to last season and they're playing well as a team."" Games involving Hoffenheim have tended to be entertaining affairs this season, with Markus Gisdol's side the joint-top scorers in the division alongside Borussia Dortmund. And their last home game was the now infamous 2-1 defeat to Bayer Leverkusen a fortnight ago in which Stefan Kiessling's 'phantom goal' ultimately proved to be the decisive counter. Hoffenheim have since learned that the result of that match will stand, but their confidence was lifted by a 4-1 win at Hannover last week and Gisdol is looking forward to welcoming the champions. ""It's a special game for us -- for Bayern not so much,"" said Gisdol this week, perhaps forgetting the record that is in sight for the visitors in Sinsheim. Bayern have won eight and drawn two of their opening 10 games to sit a point clear of Dortmund and Bayer Leverkusen at the top of the standings, and that trio have already opened up a gap on the pack below that looks unlikely to be closed again. It has been an excellent last week for Dortmund, who followed up wins at Arsenal in the Champions League and at Schalke in the Ruhr derby with the announcement that sought-after coach Jurgen Klopp had extended his contract until the summer of 2018. ""We're all so pleased that we can help this team, which is still a long way from reaching its peak, to develop. We want to shape the future of this wonderful club together,"" Klopp told the Bundesliga's official website. On Friday, Dortmund entertain Stuttgart looking to beat the Swabians at home for the first time since September 2008. Klopp -- who was born in Stuttgart -- knows to expect another tough test against a side who are unbeaten in seven league games since Thomas Schneider replaced Bruno Labbadia in the dugout. ""I assume it will be a closely fought game, but I also believe that we will win,"" said Klopp, who could have Sebastian Kehl back after injury. Like Bayern, Leverkusen have records in sight this weekend, as a win at struggling Eintracht Braunschweig will make this their best ever start to a season in 34 years in the Bundesliga. Sami Hyypia's side, who saw Germany midfielder Lars Bender sign a contract extension this week tying him to the club until 2019, should prove too strong for Braunschweig, who have won just once so far in what is their first top-flight campaign in more than quarter of a century. In other games, Schalke warm up for their Champions League trip to face Chelsea by taking on fifth-place Hertha Berlin in the capital, and struggling duo Nuremberg and Freiburg are both still looking for their first win of the season as they meet in Franconia.

A victory at the Veltins Arena would therefore allow Jurgen Klopp's side to get one over on the Royal Blues as well as keep the pressure on Bayern Munich, the leaders who come into the weekend a point clear of Dortmund and Bayer Leverkusen. While Dortmund were beating Arsenal 2-1 in London, Schalke were also in Champions League action on Tuesday, although they were outclassed 3-0 at home by Chelsea. Jens Keller's men have only lost once in their last six Bundesliga outings, with that a 4-0 home hammering by Bayern, but they have beaten Leverkusen at home this season and will be determined to repeat their 2-1 derby triumph of March, when Klaas-Jan Huntelaar scored the decisive goal in a 2-1 victory. ""That was the shadow that lay over last season for us and we need to make amends,"" said Klopp. For Schalke, Huntelaar is missing but Kevin-Prince Boateng will be available to face the side with whom he had a spell in the 2008-09 season. Upon signing for the Gelsenkirchen club, he was forced to retract earlier comments about Dortmund being his ""favourite team"". The rivalry between the clubs is fierce, and the nature of it has not been lost on Schalke's Japanese full-back Atsuto Uchida. ""When I came to Germany I was told straightaway that I wasn't allowed to wear anything yellow, and even to steer clear of black boots. That is how intense it is,"" he said. ""You never want to lose against Dortmund -- and we beat them twice last season. They're a fine team, but we'll be going out looking for another win this time as well."" After tasting victory in his first derby in charge, Keller is hoping for more of the same this weekend. ""You can feel the derby fever everywhere. Everyone knows how special this game is,"" said the man who was under severe pressure at the start of the campaign after Schalke took just one point from their first three games. Elsewhere on Saturday, Bayern put their 34-match unbeaten run in the Bundesliga on the line when they entertain Hertha Berlin, the capital club who sit fourth. A win will keep Pep Guardiola's reigning champions top and will see them go a whole year undefeated since a 2-1 loss to Leverkusen on October 28 2012. Bayern, who are closing in on Hamburg's 30-year-old record 36-match unbeaten streak, have lost veteran Peruvian striker Claudio Pizarro for up to six weeks with a thigh muscle tear suffered in training. That leaves Mario Mandzukic as their only fit centre-forward, although Guardiola should have no qualms about playing Thomas Mueller or Mario Goetze as a false nine. After the controversy of Stefan Kiessling's 'phantom' goal that helped Leverkusen to a 2-1 win at Hoffenheim, Sami Hyypia's side crushed Shakhtar Donetsk 4-0 in the Champions League on Wednesday and now host Augsburg on Saturday. Further down the table, 16th-placed Nuremberg are still without a win as they prepare to face Stuttgart away on Friday in what will be Dutchman Gertjan Verbeek's first game in charge since he was appointed as the successor to the sacked Michael Wiesinger.

Having beaten Steaua 3-0 at home and Basel 1-0 away, Schalke face the biggest test of their credentials at the Veltins Arena on Tuesday, ahead of the return leg at Stamford Bridge on November 6. ""We lost the first match at home, but won the second away, we now play two matches against the strongest team in the group,"" said Mourinho as his team arrived at Duesseldorf airport on Monday. Schalke are without Dutch striker Klaas-Jan Huntelaar, who has a knee injury, and Peru forward Jefferson Farfan, who has hamstring problems, while England left-back Ashley Cole is out with a rib injury. ""They are missing a couple of players but so are we, Ashley Cole is an important player and isn't playing,"" said Mourinho. ""John Terry will play, but I need to make a decision between David Luiz and Gary Cahill (at centre-back)."" Fifth-placed Schalke laboured to a 3-2 win away at Bundesliga bottom side Eintracht Braunschweig on Saturday, but Chelsea know the Royal Blues -- who reached the Champions League semi-finals in 2011 -- are a different proposition at home. ""We know about them. They pose a real threat. They look solid defensively. We understand it's a tough game,"" said Terry. Chelsea are second in the Premier League, just two points behind  Arsenal after their 4-1 win over Cardiff City in London on Saturday with Eden Hazard scoring twice while Samuel Eto'o and Oscar also got on the scoresheet. Mourinho must choose between Fernando Torres, who is back in contention after a knee injury, Eto'o or Demba Ba up front for the Blues. ""Samuel Eto'o needs time, he's played in Italy and Spain which are very different, but his game against Cardiff was very good,"" said Mourinho."

Schalke are top of Group E after beating both Steaua Bucharest and FC Basel, but second-placed Chelsea arrive in Gelsenkirchen gunning for top spot having beaten Bucharest 4-0 after suffering a shock 2-1 home defeat to Basel in their opening game. Chelsea will provide Schalke with their biggest test thus far and the Gelsenkirchen-based outfit welcome Boateng back after labouring to a 3-2 win at Bundesliga bottom side Eintracht Braunschweig on Saturday. ""He is an exceptional player with enormous quality and tremendous leadership qualities,"" said Schalke team manager Horst Heldt. ""Chelsea are the top favourites to win the group and they have a very strong squad. They have numerous possibilities, so we need to step up."" Boateng has made his mark since joining Schalke from AC Milan in late August with three goals in five league games and scored in their 3-0 Champions League win against Bucharest. ""He's an incredible player who spreads fear in the enemy,"" said Schalke defender Denis Aogo. As well as Boateng, Schalke are also set to welcome back USA midfielder Jermaine Jones, after a knee injury, and Germany goalkeeper Timo Hildebrand, who had a back problem. ""With them back, we have more options,"" said Schalke coach Jens Keller. ""We'll take some confidence from our results in the last few weeks, of course we want to win the game, but we'd be able to live with a draw."" Schalke are missing star striker Klaas-Jan Huntelaar, who has a medial knee injury, and winger Jefferson Farfan, who has a torn hamstring.

The Bucharest club, who won their 24th Romanian title last season, have won just four of their 38 group matches over seven campaigns, picking up 11 draws. Their last victory came at Dynamo Kiev in 2006 while their most recent home win was against Widzew Lodz in 1996. Basel, semi-finalists in the Europa League last season, could not build on their surprise 2-1 matchday one victory at Chelsea, losing 1-0 at home to group leaders Schalke last time out. They currently lead the Swiss league. Schalke (GER) v Chelsea (ENG) Chelsea and Schalke last met in the 2007/08 group stage, with the match in Germany ending scoreless while the English club were 2-0 victors at Stamford Bridge thanks to Florent Malouda and Didier Drogba. Schalke are hoping to welcome back goalkeeper Timo Hildebrand from a back injury, while US midfielder Jermaine Jones and Ghana star Kevin-Prince Boateng should be fit after knee injuries. But Schalke look to be without defensive midfielder Marco Hoeger, who twisted his knee against Braunschweig in the 3-2 win at the weekend. Chelsea badly need a win in Gelsenkirchen to build on their 4-0 win at Steaua Bucharest. Chelsea are unbeaten in their last six games since their shock defeat at home to Basel and have scored 10 goals in their last three games. Ashley Cole is likely to miss the match after suffering a rib injury while Germany winger Andre Schuerrle, who missed Saturday's 4-1 win over Cardiff with a thigh injury, could return along with Spain striker Fernando Torres. Group F Arsenal (ENG) v Borussia Dortmund (GER) Premier League leaders Arsenal and Dortmund, last season's Champions League runners-up, faced each other in 2011-2012 when two Robin van Persie strikes gave Arsenal the points at home despite Shinji Kagawa's injury-time reply. Van Persie and Ivan Perisic were on the scoresheet in a 1-1 draw in the return game. The Gunners are in the group stage for the 16th season in a row. For the sixth time in eight campaigns they had to negotiate a qualifying round, dispatching Fenerbahce 5-0 on aggregate in the play-offs with in-form Aaron Ramsey scoring three times. Arsenal have managed to move to the top of the Premier League, two points ahead of Chelsea and Liverpool, without a number of key players such as Theo Walcott, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Lukas Podolski. Mathieu Flamini may miss Tuesday's game after suffering concussion in Saturday's 4-1 win over Norwich. Dortmund are second in the Bundesliga, a point behind Bayern Munich, after a hard-fought 1-0 win at home to Hanover on Saturday. The German side are without midfielder Nuri Sahin who has an ankle injury. Marseille (FRA) v Napoli (ITA) Brazilian defender Lucas Mendes will miss the game after suffering an ankle injury in Friday's 1-0 defeat at Nice. With two defeats from their first two Group F matches, Marseille must beat the Italians to keep their knock-out stage hopes alive. Napoli could be without Argentine striker Gonzalo Higuain who has a thigh strain. Goran Pandev is likely to start for a Napoli team who have so far beaten Borussia Dortmund but lost to Arsenal. Group G Porto (POR) v Zenit St Petersburg (RUS) Zenit's record signing Hulk will make an emotional return to the club where he scored 78 goals. The 27-year-old Brazilian has started to show form for Zenit this term, after a troubled first season where some of his team-mates objected to his wages, scoring seven goals in eight league appearances. Zenit are on a hot streak with seven league successive wins but have just a single point from their European campaign. Porto have three points and will be looking to preserve their unbeaten home record against Russian sides which stands at five, although the last time these two were in the same group, it was Zenit who progressed to the last-16. Austria Vienna (AUT) v Atletico Madrid (ESP) Atletico suffered their first league defeat of the season, 1-0 at Espanyol on Saturday. Diego Simeone's men have two wins from two in the Champions League, including an impressive come from behind victory at Porto. Atletico are likely to be without Brazilian youngster Leo Baptistao, who has a sprained ankle, and will most likely be replaced by 25-year-old Diego Costa, who has missed two games through suspension, but is the Liga leading scorer with 10 goals. He will be keener than ever to impress Spanish coach Vicente del Bosque as he seeks to get into the squad for next year's World Cup finals in his birthplace of Brazil. Group H Celtic (SCO) v Ajax (NED) The Scottish champions desperately need a result in the first of two clashes with Ajax, but will be without captain Scott Brown, who is suspended following his red card against Barcelona, and Kris Commons, who went off early in their draw with Hibs on Saturday with a hamstring strain. Winger James Forrest looks set to start after scoring a fine goal. Ajax drew 1-1 with league leaders Twente on Saturday and will be looking to at the very least put themselves in position for the Europa League spot having garnered one point in a 1-1 draw with Milan in their previous match. AC Milan (ITA) v Barcelona (ESP) Milan could count themselves fortunate to have grabbed a point against Ajax, a last minute penalty by Mario Balotelli forcing the draw. However, the talented striker is likely to be a key absentee as he suffered a thigh injury in last week's World Cup qualifier with Armenia. However, they are also likely to have to call on third choice goalkeeper Marco Amelia as Christian Abbiati is injured and Gabriel, who played on Saturday, was not on the list of the Champions League squad. Barcelona, looking for their third win in three group games, failed to score in a league match for the first time since January 2012 with a 0-0 draw with Osasuna. Carles Puyol made his first start after a seven-month absence due to knee surgery while four-time world player of the year Lionel Messi came on for the final quarter after sitting out several games with a thigh strain."

On Saturday, European champions Bayern extended their unbeaten Bundesliga run to 34 games by coming from behind for a 4-1 home win over Mainz to go back to the top. Having last lost in the German league back in October 2012, Bayern are now just two matches short of equalling Hamburg's 30-year-old, 36-match streak. Bayern were punished for a poor first-half in Munich when Mainz striker Shawn Parker fired home after capitalising on a mistake by centre-back Jerome Boateng. But Bayern roared back when Germany midfielder Mario Goetze came off the bench for the second-half and played a key part in the hosts' first three second-half goals. His dream pass through to Arjen Robben allowed the winger to equalise on 50 minutes and two minutes later, Goetze combined with the Dutchman for Germany's Thomas Mueller to fire home to make it 2-1. With Bayern finally making their 80 percent possession pay off, Goetze fired in a cross for Mario Mandzukic to score their third on 69 minutes. And when Bayern vice-captain Bastian Schweinsteiger was fouled in the area, Mueller stepped up to drill home the penalty for his second of the game eight minutes from time. Bayer Leverkusen had briefly gone top on Friday thanks to a controversial 'phantom' goal in their 2-1 win at Hoffenheim. The German Football Federation (DFB) will investigate on Monday while Hoffenheim have called for a replay after Stefan Kiessling's 70th-minute winner came in bizarre circumstances. Replays showed his header only ended in the back of the net after flying through a hole in the side netting. Schalke 04, who host Chelsea in the Champions League on Tuesday, needed a 91st-minute winner from Roman Neustaedter to seal a 3-2 win at bottom side Eintracht Braunschweig. Dortmund, who are at Arsenal on Tuesday in the Champions League, stayed second with a hard-fought 1-0 win at home to Hanover 96. Germany winger Marco Reus hit the winning penalty after just four minutes when Hanover's Japan defender Hiroki Sakai fouled left-back Erik Durm in the area. Borussia stay second and level on 22 points with third-placed Leverkusen, just a point behind Bayern.

Having last lost in the German league back in October 2012, Bayern are now just two matches short of equalling Hamburg's 30-year-old, 36-match streak. Bayern were punished for a poor first-half in Munich when Mainz striker Shawn Parker fired home after capitalising on a mistake by centre-back Jerome Boateng. But Bayern roared back when Germany midfielder Mario Goetze came off the bench for the second-half and played a key part in the hosts' first three second-half goals. His dream pass through to Arjen Robben allowed the winger to equalise on 50 minutes and two minutes later, Goetze combined with the Dutchman for Germany's Thomas Mueller to fire home to make it 2-1. With Bayern finally making their 80 percent possession pay off, Goetze fired in a cross for Mario Mandzukic to score their third on 69 minutes. And when Bayern vice-captain Bastian Schweinsteiger was fouled in the area, Mueller stepped up to drill home the penalty for his second of the game eight minutes from time. Bayer Leverkusen had briefly gone top on Friday thanks to a controversial 'phantom' goal in their 2-1 win at Hoffenheim. The German Football Federation (DFB) will investigate on Monday while Hoffenheim have called for a replay after Stefan Kiessling's 70th-minute winner came in bizarre circumstances. Replays showed his header only ended in the back of the net after flying through a hole in the side netting and a DFB sports court is set to meet on Monday. Schalke 04, who host Chelsea in the Champions League on Tuesday, needed a 91st-minute winner from Roman Neustaedter to seal a 3-2 win at bottom side Eintracht Braunschweig. Dortmund, who are at Arsenal on Tuesday in the Champions League, stayed second with a hard-fought 1-0 win at home to Hanover 96. Germany winger Marco Reus hit the winning penalty after just four minutes when Hanover's Japan defender Hiroki Sakai fouled left-back Erik Durm in the area. Borussia stay second and level on 22 points with third-placed Leverkusen, just a point behind Bayern. Second-from-bottom Freiburg picked up a point with a goalless draw at Werder Bremen, while Eintracht Frankfurt drew 1-1 at home to Nuremberg. Later Sunday, Augsburg are home to Wolfsburg."

With Bayern leading the Bundesliga by a point and players returning from injury, competition is set to increase, but the Spanish coach is demanding patience. ""We will only fight for the (league) title at the end of the season if every player accepts my decisions -- otherwise we will have problems,"" he told Bayern's magazine. ""I support those who accept them, but those who don't want to understand them will often find themselves sitting in the stands."" Traditionally a strong mid-table side, Mainz have had an erratic start to the season, winning their first three league games then losing their next four before drawing with Hoffenheim a fortnight ago. Bayern midfielder Mario Goetze scored for Germany in Tuesday's 5-3 win over Stockholm and is back in contention for selection after an ankle injury. Goetze is hoping for an appearance against Mainz after a long lay-off having damaged his ankle after returning from April's hamstring injury at the start of the season. ""(The Sweden game) was important for me after so long out,"" said Goetze."" ""How long I will play for against Mainz is down to the coach. ""I'm just looking forwards and am excited about the future -- hopefully without injury."" Bayern, who host Czech side Viktoria Pilsen on Wednesday and are top of their Champions League group, are without Swiss winger Xherdan Shaqiri until December after he returned from international duty with a torn hamstring. Mainz are waiting on the fitness of striker Nicolai Mueller, who has six goals this season, after the 26-year-old twisted an ankle in training on Wednesday. Mainz coach Thomas Tuchel described the training ground accident as ""one of those awful moments"" and the guests need their top scorer at Munich's Allianz Arena. Champions League side Bayer Leverkusen have the chance to go top of the German league on Friday when they travel to mid-table Hoffenheim. With just a point separating the top three, second-placed Borussia Dortmund host fifth-placed Hanover 96 boosted by their injury worries having been eased by the international break. Midfielders Nuri Sahin, Marco Reus and Jonas Hofmann all returned to training on Wednesday. ""Things aren't as bad as they could have been,"" said coach Jurgen Klopp, who still has Lukasz Piszczek, Sebastian Kehl, Ilkay Gundogan and Mats Hummels on the injured list. With Dortmund away to Arsenal on Tuesday in the Champions League, Klopp needs a moral-boosting win over Hanover. Senegal striker Mame Diouf returned to full Hanover training on Tuesday, having torn a thigh muscle in September, and could feature at Dortmund's Westfalenstadion. Hanover's Ivory Coast winger Didier Ya Konan is definitely out for the rest of the year after surgery on an ankle injury. Schalke 04 warm-up for their home Champions League Group E showdown with Chelsea next Tuesday at bottom side Eintracht Braunschweig. Having picked up their first win at the eighth attempt at Wolfsburg a fortnight ago, Braunschweig will be eager to prove the three points they took at Wolves was no fluke."

The 78-year-old won a total of eight German league titles, six with Bayern and two with Moenchengladbach, and was Germany's assistant coach at the 1966 World Cup, when they lost the final 4-2 to England at Wembley. He steered Bayern to the European Cup in 1974, their first of three back-to-back titles, before joining Borussia Moenchengladbach, where he won the 1976 and 1977 Bundesliga titles. He also won the 1982 European Cup Winners' Cup with Barcelona, as well as the 1983 Copa del Ray, before returning to the Bundesliga and eventually retired from coaching in 2000. ""My husband has Parkinson's. If my Udo has been lying down for a few days, then he normally needs a wheelchair,"" his wife Hildegard told German daily Bild. ""There are days when Udo's state of mind is very unsteady."" Lattek has been in poor health since suffering a stroke in 2010 and having spent time in hospital recently, he is being cared for at home in Cologne."

Last week, the 46-year-old Klopp watched Dortmund's 3-0 home win over Olympique Marseille from the stands and will do the same at Emirates Stadium on October 22, having decided not to appeal UEFA's ban handed out on October 2. ""My main motivation is that I don't want to give the impression that I am trivialising my own misconduct or want to detract from it,"" Klopp explained to German newspaper Revier Sport. Klopp's place on the Dortmund bench in London will again be taken by assistant coach Zeljko Buvac after UEFA's written verdict arrived in Dortmund on Tuesday and club bosses on Wednesday opted not to lodge an appeal. With the international break coming up, Dortmund's next match is at home to Hanover 96 in the Bundesliga on October 19 and the pause comes at a perfect time for Klopp with 10 players injured, including Germany midfielders Marco Reus and Ilkay Gundogan. Reus has cried off Germany's World Cup qualifier against the Republic of Ireland in Cologne on Friday with an ankle injury, while Gundogan could miss the rest of the year with a trapped nerve, according to German daily Bild. Dortmund, second in the Bundesliga, have a busy finish to the month as they face the trip to London to face Arsenal on October 22, then travels to rivals Schalke in Gelsenkirchen four days later in the Bundesliga."

""It's great to get the hat-trick, but it's more important that things went so well for the team,"" said Lasogga, who claimed the fastest away hat-trick in Bundesliga history. This was only the second game for Van Marwijk, 61, who coached Holland to the 2010 World Cup final. He replaced Thorsten Fink last month after a disastrous start left Hamburg in the relegation places. The Dutchman has promised to tighten Hamburg's defence, but it was their attack which ran riot at Nuremberg. ""I like attacking football, although tactical discipline belongs to that and we still lose the ball too often, but it's getting better,"" said Van Marwijk, whose reign opened with a draw at Frankfurt last week. ""A 5-0 win doesn't happen every week, but it's important to help the self-confidence come back."" Dutch midfielder Rafael van der Vaart opened the scoring with a superb scissor-kick volley on 17 minutes. The Hamburg captain then provided the final passes for Lasogga to fire home his first two goals while the ex-Hertha Berlin forward completed the hat-trick when he pounced on a loose ball and smashed his shot inside the inside post. Midfielder Tolgay Arslan bagged the fifth 16 minutes from time to leave Nuremberg reeling. The rout lifts Hamburg up to 14th, while Nuremberg slip into the bottom three. On Saturday, European champions Bayern Munich went top for the first time under Pep Guardiola after a 1-1 draw at Bayer Leverkusen. Bayern extended their unbeaten run to 33 Bundesliga games and are closing in on Hamburg's record of 36, set in January 1983, as the Bavarians returned to the site of their last league defeat in October 2012. Previous leaders Borussia Dortmund lost top place after suffering a shock 2-0 defeat at Borussia Moenchengladbach earlier in the day. In a high-tempo clash at Leverkusen's BayArena, Germany midfielder Sidney Sam's 31st-minute equaliser for the hosts cancelled out Toni Kroos' opening goal for Bayern. Leverkusen goalkeeper Bernd Leno guaranteed a point for his side by denying Franck Ribery twice in as many second-half minutes, then Mario Goetze, while Thomas Mueller had a penalty appeal turned down. But Guardiola was a picture of frustration, brooding on the Bayern bench and drumming his fingers as Bayern enjoyed 27 shots on goal and 78 percent possession, but managed just a single goal. The point was enough to send Bayern top, with Leverkusen third, behind Borussia Dortmund. Fresh from their impressive 3-0 Champions League win over Marseille, Dortmund were set to claim an away point until a disastrous final 10-minute spell, triggered by Mats Hummels' red card. The Germany defender was sent off on 81 minutes after a reckless challenge on 'Gladbach's Norway midfielder Havard Nordtveit in the area. Germany striker Max Kruse netted the resulting penalty, then Brazilian forward Raffael hit their second four minutes from time to see 'Gladbach move up to fourth. Schalke 04 came from behind to claim a 4-1 win over 10-man Augsburg in Gelsenkirchen to move up to eighth. VfB Stuttgart dropped to seventh after their 1-1 draw at home to Werder Bremen while Hoffenheim stayed 10th with a 2-2 draw at Mainz. Eintracht Braunschweig, who have been bottom of the table since last season's promotion, picked up their first win of the season with a shock 2-0 victory at VfL Wolfsburg -- their first Bundesliga victory since 1985. Despite the win, Braunschweig stay bottom of the table on goal difference but level on points with 17th-placed Freiburg who drew 1-1 at home to ten-man Eintracht Frankfurt on Sunday."

Dutch midfielder Rafael van der Vaart opened the scoring with a superb scissor-kick volley on 17 minutes. The Hamburg captain then provided the final passes for Lasogga to fire home his first two goals while the ex-Hertha Berlin forward completed the hat-trick when he pounced on a loose ball and smashed his shot inside the inside post. Midfielder Tolgay Arslan then bagged the fifth 16 minutes from time to leave Nuremberg reeling. The rout lifts Hamburg up to 14th, while Nuremberg slip into the bottom three. On Saturday, European champions Bayern Munich went top of the German league for the first time under Pep Guardiola after a pulsating 1-1 draw at Bayer Leverkusen. Bayern extended their unbeaten run to 33 Bundesliga games and are closing in on Hamburg's record of 36, set in January 1983, as the Bavarians returned to the site of their last league defeat in October 2012. Previous leaders Borussia Dortmund lost top place after suffering a shock 2-0 defeat at Borussia Moenchengladbach earlier in the day. In a high-tempo clash at Leverkusen's BayArena, Germany midfielder Sidney Sam's 31st-minute equaliser for the hosts cancelled out Toni Kroos' opening goal for Bayern. Leverkusen goalkeeper Bernd Leno guaranteed a point for his side by denying Franck Ribery twice in as many second-half minutes, then Mario Goetze, while Thomas Mueller had a penalty appeal turned down. But Guardiola was a picture of frustration, brooding on the Bayern bench and drumming his fingers as Bayern enjoyed 27 shots on goal and 78 percent possession, but managed just a single goal. The single point was enough to send Bayern top, with Leverkusen third, behind Borussia Dortmund. Fresh from their impressive 3-0 Champions League win over Marseille, Dortmund were set to claim an away point until a disastrous final 10-minute spell, triggered by Mats Hummels' red cord. The Germany defender was sent off on 81 minutes after a reckless challenge on 'Gladbach's Norway midfielder Havard Nordtveit in the area. Germany striker Max Kruse netted the resulting penalty, then Brazilian forward Raffael hit their second four minutes from time to see 'Gladbach move up to fourth. Schalke 04 came from behind to claim a 4-1 win over 10-man Augsburg in Gelsenkirchen to move up to eighth. VfB Stuttgart dropped to seventh after their 1-1 draw at home to Werder Bremen while Hoffenheim stayed 10th with a 2-2 draw at Mainz. Eintracht Braunschweig, who have been bottom of the table since last season's promotion, picked up their first win of the season with a shock 2-0 victory at VfL Wolfsburg -- their first Bundesliga victory since 1985. The win lifted Braunschweig off bottom place with Freiburg, who host Frankfurt on Sunday, dropping down to last place."

450,01/10/2013,14:28,"Football: 'Super, super' Guardiola's 100th day at Bayern","The plaudits flowed for Pep Guardiola as Tuesday marked his 100th day as Bayern Munich coach, but his team is yet to rediscover the domination of last season's treble-winning campaign.","Guardiola faces arguably the toughest test of his brief reign when the holders face Manchester City away in the Champions League on Wednesday. Having been unveiled as Bayern boss on June 24, Guardiola has led European champions Bayern to their UEFA Super Cup win over Chelsea on penalties and have dropped just two points in seven league games so far. ""His ideas are unbelievable, he is a coach who knows exactly how the players feel and think,"" enthused Bayern's Germany midfielder Bastian Schweinsteiger. Likewise, Bayern president Uli Hoeness, not one to gladly suffer fools or egotistical coaches, was just as enthusiastic. ""It's a huge amount of fun to work with him. He is a totally open person and wears his heart on his sleeve,"" said Hoeness. ""I am very happy that we have him here. ""During the meetings with him, you always feel that you're progressing in life."" Guardiola has poured on the charm by speaking passable German from his first day in office and punned the expression ""super, super, super"" to emphasis a particular positive point in interviews. But having insisted at his initial press conference that he would neither make significant early changes nor recruit players from his former club Barcelona, Guardiola soon did the exact opposite. With Guardiola's brother Pere as his agent, Spain Under-21 captain Thiago Alcantara moved from Barcelona to Bavaria while the treble-winning 4-2-3-1 system was abandoned for a 4-1-4-1 formation. Guardiola's competitive debut resulted in a 4-2 defeat at arch-rivals Borussia Dortmund for the German Super Cup at the end of July. Bayern then avenged their 2012 Champions League final defeat at home to Chelsea by beating the Blues in Prague in August for the UEFA Super Cup, but the Germans twice came from behind, including a 121st-minute equaliser from Javi Martinez. Part of the problem in Prague -- as it has been for most of the season -- has been Guardiola's insistence on a single defensive midfielder playing in front of the back-four. Last season, Schweinsteiger and Martinez formed a rock-solid midfield pairing, often shutting down opposition attacks before they even troubled the defence, as Bayern conceded 18 league goals all season. With both Martinez and Schweinsteiger having spent the opening weeks of the season recovering from minor operations, Guardiola has deployed captain Philipp Lahm as a single defensive midfielder. It has meant more space for the opposition to attack in front of the Bayern back-four and without that composure, Bayern's attacks have on occasion lacked sparkle, despite averaging 70 percent possession. Their 3-0 win at home to Russian champions CSKA Moscow and the 4-0 league win at Schalke in mid-September were the only times Bayern stamped their authority on a game. As Guardiola himself acknowledges, his main problem is ""that people are no longer satisfied with a 2-0 win"" and that ""you always have to play spectacular football and sweep away the opposition"". Guardiola's achievement of dropping only two league points in seven league matches pales next to last season's achievement of winning all eight opening games under predecessor Jupp Heynckes. Traditionally, Bayern's loudest critics come predominantly from within. Last month, director of sport Matthias Sammer stirred the waters by accusing the team of ""lethargic football"" and ""going through the motions"" before they responded by seeing off Moscow and Schalke. Guardiola insisted he has no problem with Sammer's criticism of his team while this week Swedish star Zlatan Ibrahimovic relaunched his war-of-words by calling the Spaniard a ""coward"" who has ""no balls"". But regardless of such comments, the Bavarians under Guardiola remain the team to beat both in Germany and on the European stage. Having broken or equalled 25 Bundesliga records last season, Bayern are just four short of the league record of 36 games without defeat, set by Hamburg in the 1980s, and they last lost in the league on October 28 last year."
451,30/09/2013,02:30,"Football: Chelsea face 'must-win' match, Arsenal flying high",Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho believes Tuesday's Champions League trip to Steaua Bucharest is a match they cannot lose while Premier League leaders Arsenal take on Napoli for the first time.,"AFP Sports looks at all eight of Tuesday's fixtures on matchday two: Group E Basel (SUI) v Schalke (GER) Basel, who made the Europa League semi-finals last season, stunned 2012 champions Chelsea 2-1 at Stamford Bridge in their opener with goals from Mohamed Salah and Marco Streller. It was the first win for a Swiss club on English soil in 20 attempts. Basel lead the Swiss league but were held to a 2-2 draw by Sion. The last time Basel faced a German side they lost 7-0 to Bayern Munich in a last-16 second leg tie in 2011-2012. Schalke were also winners on matchday one, beating Steaua Bucharest 3-0. But the German side are only mid-table in the Bundesliga and on Saturday surrendered a 2-0 lead against Hoffenheim to draw 3-3. Kevin-Prince Boateng, man of the match against the Romanians, was on the scoresheet on Saturday. Steaua Bucharest (ROM) v Chelsea (ENG) Chelsea warmed-up for Tuesday's tie by drawing 1-1 at London rivals Spurs in a match which saw Fernando Torres sent-off and John Terry score his team's only goal. Juan Mata will start the match that coach Jose Mourinho says is a game Chelsea can't afford to lose. Steaua beat Chelsea 1-0 last season in the Europa League round of 16 first leg. Mata levelled the overall scores at Stamford Bridge before Vlad Chiriches restored Steaua's aggregate lead. But Terry and Torres struck to take the Londoners through. The Romanians are playing in the group stage for the first time since the 2008-2009 season. Their last victory came at Dinamo Kiev in September, 2006. Group F Arsenal v Napoli The Gunners' remarkable turnaround after an opening day defeat to Aston Villa in the Premier League has seen them reel off nine consecutive wins, including a 2-1 victory away to Marseille in their Group F curtain raiser. Arsene Wenger celebrated his 17th anniversary as Arsenal boss with a 2-1 win away to Swansea over the weekend with in-form midfielder Aaron Ramsey on target for a fourth game running. Theo Walcott is sidelined, but Czech midfielder Tomas Rosicky could return after a month out. Rafael Benitez's Napoli are also off to a strong start in Italy's Serie A, having dropped just two points from a possible 18. Benitez will have a rested Marek Hamsik to call upon. Borussia Dortmund v Marseille Last season's finalists Borussia Dortmund are off to a flying start in the Bundesliga with six wins from seven matches, including a 5-0 thrashing of Freiburg on Saturday. However, Jurgen Klopp's men have work to do on the European stage after slumping to a 2-1 defeat at Napoli a fortnight ago. Goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller, who was sent off in Italy, is banned while left-back Marcel Schmelzer is sidelined with a thigh problem. Marseille's first trip to Signal Iduna Park two seasons ago culminated with a dramatic late winner from Mathieu Valbuena as the visitors came from two goals down to win 3-2 and qualify for the round of 16. Group G Zenit Saint Petersbug v Austria Vienna Both sides will be desperate to take all three points, having lost their openers to Atletico Madrid and FC Porto. Zenit, who lost 3-0 in Madrid, will be the more confident of the two, playing at home just a few days after going top of the Russian Premier League thanks to a 4-2 win over Spartak Moscow. Alexander Kerzhakov became the all-time leading scorer in the Russian league in that game as he notched his 208th career goal. Austria Vienna, 1-0 losers at home to FC Porto, went down 1-0 at Admira and are in fifth position in the top flight league. They are playing in the Champions League Group stages for the first time. FC Porto v Atletico Madrid Atletico have made a fantastic start to the campaign with six consecutive wins in all competitions, culminating in a first league victory over Real Madrid for 14 years on Saturday. Unfortunately for Diego Simeone's men, talisman Diego Costa is unavailable as he serves the final match of his four-game European ban. His absence is likely to mean a first ever Atletico start for Leo Baptistao, who scored in the Spanish side's 3-1 victory over Zenit St Petersburg two weeks ago. Porto sit two points clear of Sporting Lisbon at the top of the Portuguese league after six games. However, Paulo Fonseca's men will have bad memories of facing Spanish opposition after being dumped out at the quarter-final stage by Malaga last season. Group H Ajax v AC Milan Ajax will be looking to bounce back from the 4-0 mauling they suffered at the hands of Barcelona and can hold out some hope against an Italian side that has won just twice in six Serie A games. Ajax warmed up for the match with a 6-0 thrashing of Go Ahead Eagles to leave them a point off leaders PSV Eindhoven. An injury-hit Milan will be seeking to secure their second successive win in the competition -- they beat Celtic 2-0 in their opener. Celtic v Barcelona Celtic gave Scottish football a rare moment of joy last season when they recorded an historic 2-1 win over Barcelona in the Champions League group stage. This time round Celtic manager Neil Lennon is not expecting a repeat. However, Barcelona will be without Lionel Messi who suffered a thigh injury in Saturday's 2-0 win over Almeria. With his tough tackling compatriot Javier Mascherano also out of the match with a hamstring injury it poses some problems for coach Gerardo Martino. Defeat for Celtic would be their 100th in all European club competitions."
452,29/09/2013,19:32,Football: Stuttgart hammer bottom-side Braunschweig,VfB Stuttgart moved up to sixth in the Bundesliga with an emphatic 4-0 rout of bottom side Eintracht Braunschweig on Sunday.,"After Bosnia striker Vedad Ibisevic headed Stuttgart ahead five minutes before the break, Guinea midfielder Ibrahima Traore's parried long-range shot was netted by Romania's Alexandru Maxim for a 2-0 lead. The 25-year-old Traore then scored his first league goal of the season when he latched onto Christian Gentner's pass behind the defence to slot home on 76 minutes. Traore then found acres of space on the left wing and his cross was converted by Austria's Martin Harnik four minutes from time to inflict a sixth defeat from seven games on Braunschweig. Earlier, Werder Bremen and Nuremberg fought out a six-goal thriller with Dutch winger Eljero Elia scoring twice for the hosts for a 3-3 draw. Japan midfielder Hiroshi Kiyotake played a key role in sparking Nuremberg's fight back from 2-0 down with a first-half goal before his superb pass saw Czech midfielder Adam Hlousek hit the equaliser. Bremen raced into a 2-0 lead after Nuremberg defender Berkay Dabanli turned the ball into his own net before Elia bagged his first with a superb shot on 34 minutes. Nuremberg fought back after Kiyotake produced a goal from nothing just before the break, then Josip Drmic made it 2-2 early in the second half. Former Juventus star Elia restored Bremen's lead with a thunderbolt shot from outside the area with 66 minutes gone before Kiyotake's through ball saw Hlousek hit the equaliser to share the points. The result left Bremen joint eighth and Nuremberg in 15th, but still chasing their first win of the season. On Saturday, Borussia Dortmund consolidated their place at the top with a 5-0 rout of 10-man Freiburg. Bayern Munich's 1-0 win over VfL Wolfsburg at the Allianz Arena means Pep Guardiola's second-placed side remain level on 19 points with Dortmund, but Jurgen Klopp's team have a superior goal difference. Dortmund ran riot at Signal Iduna Park with Germany winger Marco Reus and Poland striker Robert Lewandowski scoring twice before Polish midfielder Jakub Blaszczykowski added the fifth 10 minutes from time. Freiburg's fortunes took a sharp downturn at 1-0 down when Senegalese centre-back Fallou Diagne was sent off after hauling down Lewandowski and Reus drilled home the resulting spot-kick in the 47th minute. Dortmund host Marseille in the Champions League on Tuesday looking to bounce back from their 2-1 defeat at Napoli while the defeat keeps Freiburg second from bottom. Ahead of Wednesday's Champions League match at Manchester City, Bayern stuttered to a 1-0 win over Wolfsburg. ""We won, but we must improve a few things,"" admitted Guardiola ahead of the trip to Manchester and next Saturday's Bundesliga clash at third-placed Bayer Leverkusen. ""I am certain that we will put in a good performance in Manchester and Leverkusen."" Bayern needed an hour to break the deadlock as Germany star Thomas Mueller netted his first Bundesliga goal of the season when he met Franck Ribery's pass from the left wing at the far post. Bayer Leverkusen stayed third, just a point behind Dortmund and Bayern, with a 2-0 win at home to Hanover 96 as Germany midfielders Simon Rolfes and Sidney Sam scored first-half goals. Leverkusen's Sami Hyypia host Real Sociedad in the Champions League on Wednesday and deserved the win having peppered the Hanover goal with 17 shots compared to the guests' seven. Ex-Holland boss Bert van Marwijk made his debut as Hamburg coach with a 2-2 draw at Eintracht Frankfurt as the Hanseatic side twice came from behind with Marcell Jansen scoring a late equaliser. Van Marwijk, who steered Holland to the 2010 World Cup final, saw Hamburg pick up their first point in three matches, but they stay 16th. Schalke, who are at FC Basel in the Champions League on Tuesday, were held to a thrilling 3-3 draw at Hoffenheim while Hertha Berlin moved up to fifth after coming from behind to beat Mainz 05 3-1 in the capital."

458,27/09/2013,02:20,Football: Wolves face tough task against on-song Bayern,VfL Wolfsburg admit they face an uphill task in their bid to try and stop Bayern Munich's march to the top of the Bundesliga table on Saturday.,"Bayern are on a 31-match unbeaten streak in the Bundesliga and last tasted defeat at home to Bayer Leverkusen in October 2012. Pep Guardiola's side go into the weekend's matches in second place in the table, trailing leaders Borussia Dortmund on goals scored before facing the Wolves at the Allianz Arena. Having blitzed Schalke 4-0 in Gelsenkirchen last Saturday in the league and routed Hanover 96 4-1 in the German Cup on Wednesday, Bayern are showing signs of further progress under Guardiola since he succeeded Jupp Heynckes as head coach in June. Bayern saw off Hanover with a side featuring the likes of Diego Contento, Xherdan Shaqiri, Daniel van Buyten and Claudio Pizarro as Guardiola rotated his squad before Saturday's visit of the Wolves and next Wednesday's Champions League clash away to Manchester City. However, the reigning European champions want more silverware and are endlessly looking for ways to improve, so there was a little frustration with the nature of Wednesday's performance. ""We shifted down a gear after going 2-0 up and Hanover were immediately right back in the game, we can't let that happen again,"" said Thomas Mueller, who scored twice in the German Cup second-round win. In contrast, Wolfsburg team manager Mike Schuessler admitted he ""didn't find many weaknesses"" after watching Guardiola's Bayern, while director of sport Klaus Allofs said: ""We'll need a good performance to get a result there."" Ex-Bayern midfielder Luiz Gustavo will be back in the Wolfsburg side after serving a one-match ban while another former Munich star, Ivica Olic, should be able to play despite carrying an ankle injury and Brazilian midfielder Diego should be fit too. Bayern have no new injury concerns with Spain midfielders Javi Martinez and Thiago Alcantara working their way back to fitness after minor operations. Elsewhere, league leaders Dortmund host Freiburg on Saturday with a question mark over left-back Marcel Schmelzer after the Germany defender aggravated a thigh injury in the 2-0 German Cup win over second-division 1860 Munich. Schmelzer is back in training, ""but whether that is enough for Saturday, we'll have to see,"" said coach Jurgen Klopp, whose team face Marseille in the Champions League next Tuesday. Dortmund are definitely without right-back Lukasz Piszczek, who is recovering from hip and groin surgery, midfielder Ilkay Gundogan, who has a back injury, and captain Sebastian Kehl, who has torn ankle ligaments. Dortmund dropped their first points of the season in last Saturday's 1-1 draw at Nuremberg, while Freiburg have yet to win a match this season after three draws and three defeats. Bayer Leverkusen boss Sami Hyypia has said there will be changes to his team on Saturday at fourth-place Hanover 96 ahead of Wednesday's Champions League clash at home to Spain's Real Sociedad. However, Australia's Robbie Kruse is looking to make his second start for the club after netting twice in last Saturday's 4-1 rout of Mainz. Ex-Holland coach Bert van Marwijk has taken charge at struggling Hamburg, and the Hanseatic club are looking for only their second win of the season as they go to Eintracht Frankfurt. HSV are already in the relegation zone after a disastrous start to the season and the 61-year-old van Marwijk was named as Thorsten Fink's successor on Monday after signing a two-year deal worth 1.4 million euros ($1.9 million) a year. ""My mission is to look at the structures in place and clarify the style of play,"" said Van Marwijk, who inherits a side who have been routed 5-1 and 6-2 by Hoffenheim and Dortmund respectively this season. ""We have to leave the bottom of the table as quickly as possible."" Fixtures (kick-offs 1330 GMT unless stated)"

It was Schalke's worst home league defeat since May, 1981. Guardiola, who took charge of the European champions in June, hailed Bayern's display. ""That was our best performance so far in the Bundesliga, we dominated against one of the best teams in Germany,"" said Guardiola after his side enjoyed 70% ball possession against Schalke. Despite a bright opening 20 minutes, Jens Keller's Schalke undid their good work as first Munich vice-captain Bastian Schweinsteiger, then striker Mario Mandzukic were left unmarked in the area to head home.

Dortmund coach Jurgen Klopp brought a weakened team with centre-back Mats Hummels missing with a back injury. Star striker Robert Lewandowski and midfielder Henrikh Mkhitaryan started on the bench and were rested after Borussia's 2-1 Champions League defeat at Napoli on Wednesday.

The league's joint top-scorer Stefan Kiessling then scored his fifth goal of the season when he headed home unmarked early in the second half, before Mainz midfielder Yunus Malli netted a late consolation. Hanover 96 stay fourth after a 2-1 win at home to Ausgburg with Hungary midfielder Szabolcs Huszti netting an 89th-minute penalty. After sacking coach Thorsten Fink last week in the wake of their 6-2 drubbing at Dortmund, Hamburg slumped to their fourth defeat of the season, losing 2-0 at home to neighbours Werder Bremen. Wolfsburg moved up to sixth with a 2-1 win at home to Hoffenheim as Croatia's ex-Bayern striker Ivica Olic scored both Wolves goals. On Sunday, VfB Stuttgart drew 1-1 with Eintracht Frankfurt, a result which left both teams in mid-table. Stuttgart striker Vedad Ibisevic missed two clear chances including a 93rd-minute penalty. After successive defeats, Hertha Berlin picked up their first point in three games with a 1-1 draw at Freiburg. Striker Admir Mehmedi's early goal for Freiburg was cancelled out by Norway international midfielder Per Skjelbred's first-half equaliser.

""We went into the game from the first minute with a very serious approach, the mentality was there,"" said Germany star Schweinsteiger.

Since his arrival from AC Milan last month, Kevin-Prince Boateng has helped lift Schalke up to ninth with the Ghana international adding some steel to their attacking midfield. The 26-year-old scored the winner at Mainz last Saturday in a 1-0 victory and hit the second goal in Wednesday's 3-0 Champions League victory over Steaua Bucharest. European champions Bayern will provide an acid test of Schalke's winning streak, but there promises to be fireworks when the Boateng brothers clash. ""He is my brother, but there will be no love lost in the game,"" said Berlin-born Kevin-Prince Boateng. ""I have already told him I would be disappointed if he didn't go at me 100 percent during the game. I will be doing the same."" Bayern have dropped just two points from their first five Bundesliga games and opened the defence of their Champions League title on Tuesday with a 3-0 win at home to CSKA Moscow. Jerome Boateng, 25, has said he will be hoping to leave Gelsenkirchen with three more league points and will not take a backward step against his sibling. ""I'll try and do that without bringing him down, but if there is no other way, I'll do it,"" said the Bayern star. ""He won't run away from me."" Bayern travel to north-west Germany from Bavaria as clear favourites, but Kevin-Prince is defiant. ""For the game in Schalke, anything is possible."" The last time the brothers played each other was the 2010 World Cup group stage match when Germany beat Ghana 1-0 in Johannesburg. ""It's a big thing for us that we can play against each other at such a high level,"" said Kevin-Prince. Bayern will still be without several stars at Schalke. Spain midfielder Javi Martinez missed training on Thursday and Friday for a dental operation, while Germany midfielder Mario Goetze is training after an ankle injury. Both will miss the Schalke game, although vice-captain Bastian Schweinsteiger should feature having come on in the win over Moscow. Schalke are still without Holland striker Klaas-Jan Huntelaar, who is recovering from a knee injury, with Hungary striker Adam Szalai deputising. League leaders Dortmund head to Nuremberg looking to preserve their 100 percent record, and earn their sixth victory in the process, but centre-back Mats Hummels is rated highly doubtful. The 24-year-old came off with a back injury in the 2-1 defeat at Napoli in Wednesday's Champions League defeat. ""I don't think it'll be ready in time,"" admitted Hummels. Hamburg host Werder Bremen with caretaker coach Rodolfo Cardoso in charge after Torsten Fink was sacked in the wake of last Saturday's 6-2 drubbing at Dortmund.

469,17/09/2013,02:06,Football: Resurgent Schalke out to see off Steaua,Rejuvenated Schalke 04 will be hoping to continue their winning form since Ghana midfielder Kevin-Prince Boateng's arrival as they tackle Steaua Bucharest in the Champions League on Wednesday.,"Having only signed from AC Milan in August, the former Portsmouth and Tottenham Hotspur midfielder helped break Schalke's worrying early season slump when he made his debut in the 2-0 win over Bayer Leverkusen. The 26-year-old then scored his first goal for the club in Saturday's 1-0 victory over Mainz to leave Schalke unbeaten in their last three games, starting with their dramatic 3-2 win at Greece's PAOK in the Champions League play-off. UEFA rules stipulate Boateng is cleared to play for Schalke in the Champions League even though he scored twice for AC Milan in their play-off win over PSV Eindhoven. The uncompromising Ghana international has added some backbone to Schalke's midfield alongside talented teenager Julian Draxler and insists spirits are high in the Royal Blues camp. ""We're up for it, that's clear,"" said Berlin-born Boateng, whose half-brother Jerome plays for European champions Bayern Munich and Germany. ""We were defensively very strong in Mainz, you have to pay the boys in defence a compliment. ""We have to do that again against Steaua and if that works, I think we'll be able to get a positive result."" With Schalke currently mid table in the Bundesliga, victory over Steaua in Group E would relieve the pressure on coach Jens Keller. Schalke will feel they have a good chance of progressing in a group in which Jose Mourinho's Chelsea are the favourites and will see the Germans travel to Swiss champions FC Basel in a fortnight. The Royal Blues' main injury worry is Dutch striker Klaas-Jan Huntelaar, who has been out for the last five games with a knee injury. After finishing fourth in the Bundesliga last season, Schalke needed a gutsy away win in Greece to come through the play-offs and reach the Champions League group stages in a competition in which they reached the semi-finals in 2011. After a 1-1 home draw with PAOK in the play-offs, Jens Keller's side faced an uphill task in the return in Greece when striker Adam Szalai's opening goal was cancelled out and midfielder Jermaine Jones was sent off. But Draxler and Szalai struck second-half goals to steer Schalke through 4-3 on aggregate. Romanian champions Steaua, the 1986 European Cup winners, came through three qualifying rounds to return to the group stage for the first time since 2008-09. Currently fourth in the Romanian league, Steaua made three signings on transfer deadline day, including experienced Greek international forward Pantelis Kapetanos, back after more than two years at CFR Cluj. The 30-year-old scored 27 league goals in his first spell at the club, between July 2008 and January 2011. Cape Verde Islands international centre-back Fernando Varela was also brought in to replace Vlad Chiriches, who was sold to Tottenham Hotspur. While Schalke reached the last 16 last season before losing to Galatasaray, the stats are against Steaua, who have won just four of their 36 matches in their seven Champions League campaigns so far. Their last victory came at Dynamo Kiev more than seven yers ago and since then they have recorded two draws and six defeats."
470,17/09/2013,02:00,"Football: Mourinho eyes Chelsea glory as Barca, Ajax clash at last","A first-ever meeting of Barcelona and Ajax, two of European football's most famous names, tops the billing in Wednesday's Champions League card, while Jose Mourinho's Chelsea and last season's runners-up Borussia Dortmund are also in action.","AFP sports takes a look at all of the opening ties in Groups E, F, G and H: Group E CHELSEA V BASEL Jose Mourinho's quest to win the Champions League with Chelsea recommences with a home fixture against the Swiss champions Basel at Stamford Bridge. These clubs met as recently as May, with Chelsea winning 5-2 on aggregate in the semi-finals of the Europa League on their way to lifting the trophy with a final victory against Benfica in Amsterdam. However, they only dropped into that competition after being eliminated from the Champions League at the group stage. This season's draw is a kind one, however, and the London club will be confident of getting back on track after Saturday's Premier League loss at Everton, even if they must do without the suspended Ramires. SCHALKE 04 V STEAUA BUCHAREST After a troubled start to the campaign, Schalke's confidence has been lifted thanks to a run of three consecutive victories. The most recent of those was a 1-0 triumph away to Mainz in the Bundesliga on Saturday, secured thanks to Kevin-Prince Boateng's first goal for the club. Boateng returned to Germany after scoring twice for AC Milan in their play-off round win over PSV Eindhoven, although he is eligible to represent Schalke in the group stage and will have an important role to play for Jens Keller's side, who have been without Klaas-Jan Huntelaar recently due to a knee injury. Romanian champions Steaua, the 1986 European Cup winners, came through three qualifying rounds to return to the group stage for the first time since 2008-09. Group F MARSEILLE V ARSENAL Arsenal have injury problems, with Santi Cazorla joining the likes of Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Lukas Podolski on the sidelines, but the signing of Germany star Mesut Ozil has lifted the London club and he helped inspire them to a 3-1 win at Sunderland in the Premier League on Saturday. That was a fifth consecutive win for Arsene Wenger's side in all competitions ahead of their visit to familiar foes Marseille. The clubs met in the group stage of the same competition two years ago, with Arsenal winning 1-0 in the south of France before a goalless draw in London. Elie Baup's side, who needed a late goal to draw 1-1 at Toulouse in Ligue 1 on Saturday, are the outsiders in a testing group. NAPOLI V BORUSSIA DORTMUND Last season's Champions League runners-up kick-off their campaign with a trip to Naples, in what is a contender for the outstanding game of matchday one. Jurgen Klopp's side are top of the Bundesliga having won all five matches so far, including a 6-2 trouncing of Hamburg on Saturday. Summer signings Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Henrikh Mkhitaryan were both on target in that game, and Dortmund could scarcely be in better shape ahead of this match at the Stadio San Paolo. Napoli, however, also boast a perfect record in Serie A, with summer recruits Gonzalo Higuain and Jose Callejon netting in Saturday's 2-0 home win against Atalanta. They return to the Champions League after a year's absence having lost to Chelsea in the last 16 two years ago. This time they are coached by a European specialist in Rafael Benitez, the mastermind of Liverpool's 2005 triumph and Chelsea's Europa League victory last season. Group G ATLETICO MADRID V ZENIT ST PETERSBURG Europa League winners twice in the last four seasons, Diego Simeone's side return to Europe's leading club competition fresh from winning their opening four games in La Liga. The most recent of those was a 4-2 defeat of Almeria on Saturday, featuring goals by strike duo Diego Costa and David Villa. Brazilian frontman Costa will not be able to play in Wednesday's game at the Vicente Calderon due to a suspension carried over from last season, though, and Atletico can expect a stern test from big-spending Zenit. The Russians will be eager to do better than last season, when they failed to make it beyond the group stage, and warmed up with a 2-0 win against Rostov on Saturday, which left them in second place in the Russian Premier League. AUSTRIA VIENNA V PORTO Portuguese champions Porto begin their Group G campaign at the scene of one of their greatest triumphs, with their match against Austria Vienna being played at the Ernst-Happel Stadion. It was there that Porto won their first European Cup in 1987, Rabah Madjer's legendary backheeled effort helping them come from behind to beat Bayern Munich 2-1 in the final. Porto lost the likes of James Rodriguez and Joao Moutinho over the summer, and have a new coach this season in Paulo Fonseca, but they have proven adept at rebuilding quickly in the past and still boast greater experience than their hosts, who are competing in the group stage for the first time. Nenad Bjelica's side came through two qualifying rounds to get here, but warmed up for this game by losing 3-2 at home to Groedig in the Austrian Bundesliga on Saturday. Group H BARCELONA V AJAX Group H brings together four former winners of the trophy, and both Barcelona and Ajax have been European champions on four separate occasions. The links between Barca and Ajax are plentiful, notably thanks to Johan Cruyff, who starred as a player and a coach for both sides. Rinus Michels and Louis van Gaal also coached both sides, while former Ajax player Frank Rijkaard led the Catalans to Champions League glory in 2006. Remarkably, though, this will be the first-ever competitive meeting of the two clubs. While the Dutch champions will arrive at the Camp Nou led by Frank de Boer, who spent four years as a player at Barcelona, the match will be an entirely new experience for his opposite number in the dugout. Tata Martino, who has overseen four wins out of four so far in La Liga, has plenty experience of South America's Copa Libertadores, but none of the Champions League. AC MILAN V CELTIC Seven-times European champions Milan entertain 1967 winners Celtic in Italy in a repeat of a 2007 last-16 tie, which the Serie A club won 1-0 after extra-time thanks to a Kaka goal. The Brazilian has recently returned to the San Siro after four years with Real Madrid but will miss Wednesday's game due to injury. Milan needed two late goals to earn a 2-2 draw at Torino on Saturday and also had to come through a play-off against PSV Eindhoven to reach the group stage. Massimiliano Allegri's side will be very much the favourites to get the better of the Scottish champions, who needed to win three qualifying ties to get this far. All-conquering at home, Neil Lennon's Celtic were comfortably beaten by another Italian club, Juventus, in the last 16 of this competition last season."
471,16/09/2013,17:44,Football: Hamburg's Fink under fire after Dortmund drubbing,Hamburg coach Thorsten Fink's job is on the line after his chairman lambasted the faltering team's defence on Monday.,"Hamburg were drubbed 6-2 at Bundesliga leaders Borussia Dortmund on Saturday, leading to chairman Carl Edgar Jarchow's astonishing public rebuke of his coach. Jarchow said he expects to see an improvement quickly, or else he and the board may be tempted to act. ""I take the long-term view, but on the board we expect things to be implemented,"" Jarchow told SID, an AFP subsidiary, on Monday. ""In Dortmund, it was a repeat of the debacle against Hoffenheim -- defence is our weak point and these mistakes must be eliminated. ""That is his (Fink's) job."" Hamburg are 15th -- just above the relegation zone -- after five games, but more worryingly they have conceded 15 goals -- 11 of which came in just two games. Having been hammered 5-1 at home by Hoffenheim in mid-August, Fink's defence again collapsed against Dortmund, despite recovering from 2-0 down to equalise just after half-time. With Dortmund's Poland striker Robert Lewandowski and Germany winger Marco Reus, plus new signings Henrikh Mkhitaryan and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang running riot, Hamburg's defence leaked four goals in 16 minutes during a second-half horror show. ""We were naive and lost almost every one-on-one,"" fumed Fink after Dortmund peppered the Hamburg goal with more than a dozen shots on target. Hamburg also capitulated 9-2 at Bayern Munich last March and the Hamburg board are running out of patience with Fink, who took charge in October 2011. After the Hoffenheim defeat, Fink gave his players two days off, then threw left-back Dennis Aogo out of the squad before he was sold to Schalke 04, while centre-backs Slobodan Rajkovic and Michael Mancienne were told they have no future at the club. The 4-0 drubbing of Eintracht Braunschweig last month failed to mask Hamburg's defensive frailties and Fink now faces a make-or-break clash against north German neighbours Werder Bremen in the Bundesliga on Saturday. Jarchow left no doubt that defeat in that game could spell the end for Fink. ""One thing is for sure, that is a very important game for everyone,"" said Jarchow. Bremen are just one place above Hamburg in the league and suffered their third consecutive defeat when they went down 3-0 at home to Eintracht Frankfurt on Saturday. ""Everything depends on this game,"" insisted club captain Rafael van der Vaart."

Striker Anthony Modeste gave Hoffenheim the lead just before the break, then provided a superb through ball for Volland to pounce on, turn the defence and hit the bottom right-hand corner. ""It was a great pass from Anthony, things are going well for me, I worked hard in pre-season which gave me confidence,"" said the Germany Under-21 skipper. ""I just want to have a good season with Hoffenheim and anything else would just be a bonus,"" he added when asked about a possible call up to Joachim Loew's senior Germany side. Gladbach pulled a goal back when Swedish striker Branimir Hrgota powered through the Hoffenheim defence fifteen minutes from time, but the defeat left Lucien Favre's side in mid-table. Later, bottom side Eintracht Braunschweig picked up their first point of the season after four defeats with a 1-1 draw at Nuremberg, with the hosts also in the bottom three. On Saturday, Borussia Dortmund picked up their fifth win to maintain their 100 percent record with a 6-2 romp at home to Hamburg to stay top of the league. After Pep Guardiola's Bayern had briefly claimed top spot with a 2-0 win over Hanover 96, Dortmund replied by routing Torsten Fink's Hamburg in emphatic style. New signing Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang netted twice, as did Poland striker Robert Lewandowski, as Champions League runners-up Dortmund pulled away after Hamburg had levelled at 2-2. New signing Henrikh Mkhitaryan and Germany winger Marco Reus also scored as Dortmund took control after Hamburg's defenders Zhi-Gin Lam and Heiko Westermann had put their side level. All four Bundesliga teams -- Dortmund, Bayern, Bayer Leverkusen and Schalke -- warmed-up for their first Champions League matches in mid-week with comfortable wins over the weekend. Bayer Leverkusen prepared for their Old Trafford trip to face Manchester United on Tuesday with a convincing 3-1 win over 10-man VfL Wolfsburg to stay third. Germany winger Sidney Sam put the hosts ahead before Wolfsburg's Croatia striker Ivica Olic levelled just before the break. Stefan Kiessling netted twice to give Leverkusen their fourth win from their opening five games, heading home on 65 minutes before slamming in his second in added time. Wolfsburg were reduced to 10 men when ex-Bayern Munich midfielder Luiz Gustavo was sent off in the final 10 minutes, for the second time this season. The Brazilian had only just returned from suspension after being dismissed in the 2-0 defeat at Mainz at the end of August. Schalke 04, who host Steaua Bucharest on Wednesday, continued their revival by picking up their second victory with a 1-0 win over Mainz. New signing Kevin-Prince Boateng hit the first-half winner in only his second league match since arriving from AC Milan. The victory lifts the Royal Blues up to ninth, while Mainz remain fifth. Werder Bremen crashed to their third straight defeat when they went down 3-0 at home to Eintracht Frankfurt after new signing Franco di Santo was sent off for kicking an opponent in the face. Czech Republic striker Vaclav Kadlec scored two first-half goals before Austria defender Sebastian Proedl added a late own-goal to complete Bremen's misery. Augsburg needed a 90th-minute winner from midfielder Tobias Werner to seal a 2-1 win at home to Freiburg. On Friday VfB Stuttgart earned a 1-0 win in the capital against Hertha Berlin to pick up their second win under caretaker coach Thomas Schneider."

New signing Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang netted twice, as did Poland striker Robert Lewandowski, as Champions League runners-up Dortmund pulled away after Hamburg had levelled at 2-2.

Hamburg responded as defender Zhi-Gin Lam scored his first goal with a thunderbolt from outside the area on 26 minutes, before centre-back Heiko Westermann headed the second on 49 minutes. But Dortmund then hit top gear as Aubameyang grabbed his second by burying Mkhitaryan's pass before the Gabon winger set up Lewandowski for Dortmund's fourth. With Hamburg's defence in disarray, Germany winger Marco Reus slotted past goalkeeper Rene Adler, then Lewandowski compounded the guests' misery when he headed the sixth just shy of the final whistle. Borussia remain the only Bundesliga side with a 100 percent record after five games ahead of Wednesday's trip to Napoli in their Champions League opener.

Slomka's side take on a Bayern team in transition since Pep Guardiola took charge in June, but Hanover will be without Senegal striker Mame Diouf, who has an ankle injury. Bayern dropped their first points in the league under Guardiola when they were held to a 1-1 draw at Freiburg a fortnight ago and the Champions League holders face a taxing three weeks with seven games in 22 days.

Then follows an away trip to Schalke 04, home matches against Hanover, again, in the cup, Wolfsburg in the league, then a Champions League away trip to Manchester City before facing Bayer Leverkusen in the Bundesliga -- all in the next three weeks. Despite their punishing schedule, Bayern's top brass expect their side to prove they are just as strong under Guardiola as they were under his predecessor Jupp Heynckes. ""We have to immediately go full throttle and tackle our work with hunger, as we did so phenomenally last season,"" president Uli Hoeness told German daily Bild. Chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge also said there can be no more excuses. ""We're at the stage where you can't allow for any more weaknesses"", he said, refering to Bayern's 1-1 draw at Freiburg a fortnight ago. Stern-faced director of sport Matthias Sammer also described the result as ""reckless and annoying"" after Guardiola fielded a weakened side. Dutch winger Arjen Robben beleives Bayern must quickly turn their attantions back to the league, having had a host of players on recent international duty. ""We have to hit the ground running and switch back to Bundesliga mode, Hanover won't give us time to settle,"" said Robben. ""We must be careful they don't hit us on the counter-attack, they'll be strong."" Bayern have a few injury problems with central midfielders Mario Goetze, Thiago Alcantara, plus defensive midfielders Javi Martinez and Jan Kirchoff on the sidelines. But they expect to have Germany star Bastian Schweinsteiger back as their vice-captain trained on Thursday after spraining his ankle at Freiburg. With four games played, Bayern are two points behind leaders Borussia, something which does not bother Robben. ""Dortmund is not the most important thing for us, we have to deal with ourselves,"" said the Dutch winger. ""Of course, we want to be at the top of the league, but you can only do that if you win."" Dortmund, the only team with a 100 percent record, host Hamburg on Saturday with concerns over Poland midfielder Jakub Blaszczykowski, who injured knee ligaments on international duty. ""It has got better, but it's still not good, it'll be close,"" said Dortmund coach Jurgen Klopp. Striker Robert Lewandowski is expected to be fit after suffering a knee strain while midfielder Marco Reus has trained since Wednesday after missing Germany's World Cup qualifier against Faroe Islands on Tuesday with an upset stomach. Schalke 04 warm-up for Wednesday's opening Champions League visit by Steaua Bucharest with a trip to mid-table Mainz and are hoping Dutch striker Klaas-Jan Huntelaar will soon be back after a knee injury. ""He's still not an option for the weekend, but for the game against Bucharest, we'll have to wait and see,"" said Schalke coach Jens Keller. Schalke are out to prove their victory over Bayer Leverkusen a fortnight ago was no fluke, with their Hungary striker Adam Szalai facing his former club. But new signing Kevin-Prince Boateng is an injury concern, having pulled out of Ghana's international last week with a knee injury."

It means Dortmund go into the international break for the forthcoming World Cup qualifiers two points clear of European champions Bayern. Mkhitaryan started off by finishing a defence-splitting pass from Poland winger Jakub Blaszczykowski after ten minutes. Frankfurt equalised when Stefan Aigner's bullet-header slammed off the post and Czech striker Vaclav Kadlec rifled home the rebound on 36 minutes for his first Bundesliga goal, having joined from Sparta Prague last month. But Mkhitaryan restored Dortmund's lead with the winner when he dribbled along the edge of the area and unleashed a fearsome shot past Frankfurt goalkeeper Kevin Trapp. However, the Armenian said Dortmund must improve to keep Bayern in second. ""I feel good in Dortmund and I'm happy with the goals, but I think we need to be much better,"" insisted Mkhitaryan, while Dortmund coach Jurgen Klopp described the midfielder as ""a weapon in front of goal with an awesome shooting technique"". The result means Dortmund finish the weekend as the league's only team with a 100 percent record as Bayern, who drew 1-1 with Freiburg on Tuesday, Mainz and Bayer Leverkusen all dropped points. Earlier, VfB Stuttgart romped to a 6-2 Bundesliga win over Hoffenheim with striker Vedad Ibisevic netting a hat-trick after coach Bruno Labbadia was sacked last Monday. Stuttgart picked up their first points of the season after three straight defeats led to Labbadia's dismissal. Caretaker coach Thomas Schneider got off to an emphatic start as Stuttgart's Romanian striker Alexandru Maxim did the damage by scoring two goals and setting up two more, while Bosnia striker Ibisevic claimed a hat-trick. The result lifts Stuttgart out of the bottom three and into 14th and leaves Hoffenheim 11th after their first defeat of the season. On Saturday, Leverkusen blew the chance to go top with a 2-0 defeat at resurgent Schalke 04. Both Germany left-back Dennis Aogo, who has joined Schalke on loan from Hamburg, and Ghana midfielder Kevin-Prince Boateng, who signed a four-year deal after arriving from AC Milan on Friday, started as the Royal Blues picked up their first league win of the season. Schalke went ahead with half an hour gone when a free-kick went in off midfielder Marco Hoeger's right shoulder before Peru forward Jefferson Farfan made sure of the win when he drilled home an 83rd-minute penalty after being hauled down in the area. Mainz 05 also wasted their opportunity to go top as they crashed to a 4-1 defeat at Hanover 96. Mainz took a 12th-minute lead through striker Nicolai Mueller, but Senegal striker Mame Diouf and Poland forward Artur Sobiech put the hosts 2-1 up at the break before Ivory Coast forward Didier Ya Konan and midfielder Edgar Prib increased the lead. Elsewhere, struggling Hamburg picked up their first win of the season after two consecutive defeats with a 4-0 thumping of promoted Eintracht Braunschweig. Dutch international Rafael van der Vaart put Hamburg ahead in the seventh minute on their first attack before Cameroon striker Jacques Zoua doubled the lead on 17 minutes as the hosts counter-attacked at pace. Hamburg made sure of the three points -- and Braunschweig's fourth straight defeat to leave Eintracht bottom of the table -- when 19-year-old Turkish midfielder Hakan Calhanoglu came on for Van der Vaart on 79 minutes to claim a brace, including a stunning free-kick. Meanwhile, Borussia Moenchengladbach moved up to seventh as they romped to a 4-1 home win over Werder Bremen. Wolfsburg enjoyed a 2-0 win at home to Hertha Berlin with Ivica Olic and Diego on target, while Augsburg picked up their second straight win with a 1-0 success at Nuremberg thanks to a late goal from substitute Kevin Vogt."

484,01/09/2013,17:50,Football: Resurgent Stuttgart slaughter Hoffenheim,VfB Stuttgart romped to a 6-2 Bundesliga win over Hoffenheim on Sunday with striker Vedad Ibisevic netting a hat-trick after coach Bruno Labbadia was sacked last week.,"Stuttgart picked up their first points of the season after three straight defeats led to Labbadia's dismissal last Monday with his team in the relegation places. Caretaker coach Thomas Schneider got off to an emphatic start as Stuttgart's Romania striker Alexandru Maxim did the damage by scoring two goals and setting up two more while Bosnia striker Ibisevic claimed a hat-trick. ""It was a fun game for us, we gave it our all after a tough week,"" said Ibisevic, who was sporting a black-eye after receiving a stray boot in the face late on. ""That was a reaction from the events of the last few weeks."" The result lifts Stuttgart out of the bottom three and into 14th and leaves Hoffenheim 11th after their first defeat of the season. Borussia Dortmund can usurp defending champions Bayern Munich at the top of the Bundesliga table if they win at Eintracht Frankfurt on Sunday evening. On Saturday, Bayer Leverkusen blew the chance to go top as they lost their 100 percent record with a 2-0 defeat at resurgent Schalke 04. Both Germany left-back Dennis Aogo, who has joined Schalke on loan from Hamburg, and Ghana midfielder Kevin-Prince Boateng, who signed a four-year deal from AC Milan on Friday, started as the Royal Blues picked up their first league win of the season. Schalke went ahead with half an hour gone when a free-kick went in off midfielder Marco Hoeger's right shoulder before Peru forward Jefferson Farfan made sure of the win when he drilled home an 83rd-minute penalty after being hauled down in the area. Mainz 05 also lost their 100 percent record and wasted their chance to go top as they crashed to a 4-1 defeat at Hanover 96. Mainz took a 12th-minute lead through striker Nicolai Mueller, but Senegal striker Mame Diouf and Poland forward Artur Sobiech put the hosts 2-1 up at the break before Ivory Coast forward Didier Ya Konan and midfielder Edgar Prib doubled the lead. Elsewhere, struggling Hamburg picked up their first win of the season after two consecutive defeats with a 4-0 thumping of promoted Eintracht Braunschweig. Dutch international Rafael van der Vaart put Hamburg ahead in the seventh minute on their first attack before Cameroon striker Jacques Zoua doubled the lead on 17 minutes as the hosts counter-attacked at pace. Hamburg confirmed their first three points -- and Braunschweig's fourth straight defeat to leave Eintracht bottom of the table -- when 19-year-old Turkish midfielder Hakan Calhanoglu came on for van der Vaart on 79 minutes to claim a brace, including a stunning free-kick. Meanwhile, Borussia Moenchengladbach moved up to seventh as they romped to a 4-1 home win over Werder Bremen. Venezuelan winger Juan Arango opened the scoring on 36 minutes with a wonderful strike from the left and Gladbach then added three more in the second half, including one from German international forward Max Kruse. Norway midfielder Havard Nordtveit's 69th minute own-goal proved to be a mere consolation for Robin Dutt's Bremen, who have now lost two on the bounce. Wolfsburg enjoyed a 2-0 win at home to Hertha Berlin with Ivica Olic and Diego on target, while Augsburg picked up their second straight win with a 1-0 success at Nuremberg thanks to a late goal from substitute Kevin Vogt."

That makes me proud,"" said Schalke coach Jens Keller. ""We implemented everything we had planned. Both Kevin-Prince Boateng and Dennis Aogo did really well on their debuts."" Schalke recovered from losing their opening two Bundesliga games against Wolfsburg and Hanover 96 to qualify for the Champions League group stage at the expense of Greek club PAOK on Tuesday and built on that success with what was a convincing home league win against Leverkusen. Keller's side took the lead with half an hour gone when a free-kick went in off midfielder Marco Hoeger's right shoulder before Peru forward Jefferson Farfan made sure of the win when he drilled home an 83rd-minute penalty after being hauled down in the area.

""I've always said that I wanted to play again in Germany."" The half-brother of Bayern Munich and Germany defender Jerome Boateng started his career at Hertha Berlin and moved to Tottenham Hotspur for 7.9 million euros in 2007. He returned briefly to Germany for a loan spell with Schalke's bitter rivals Borussia Dortmund before joining Portsmouth and then Milan. Boateng scored twice in the Italian team's 3-0 victory against PSV Eindhoven in their Champions League play-off second leg on Wednesday that took them through to the group stage 4-1 on aggregate. A tough character, Boateng's tackle on Michael Ballack in the 2010 FA Cup final ruled the Germany captain out of the World Cup in South Africa and he has been brought in to add some middle backbone for the Royal Blues. ""He is an exceptional player with enormous quality and tremendous leadership skills,"" said Schalke coach Jens Keller. Alongside Schalke's 19-year-old star Julian Draxler, Boateng could form an impressive midfield partnership and Schalke's general manager Horst Heldt ruled out selling the teenager Draxler before the transfer window closes next week. ""It would be schizophrenic to sign one player of quality, but then let another one go. That's not what we want to do,"" said Heldt.

Schalke won away from home despite finishing with ten men after American midfielder Jermaine Jones was dismissed for a second yellow card as Hungary striker Adam Szalai hit two goals including the dramatic 90th-minute winner. But the 25-year-old is suspected to have suffered a broken scaphoid in his right hand during training and then landed on it after scoring Schalke's first goal. ""It was extremely painful,"" he told German daily Bild with a scan set to reveal the extent of the damage. Szalai, who cost Schalke 8 million euros (US$ 10.7m) from Mainz 05 in July, could be ruled out for up to eight weeks and Schalke are already without first-choice striker Klaas-Jan Huntelaar for the next few weeks with torn knee ligaments. According to German media, Schalke are set to recruit left-back Aogo, who has won 12 caps for Germany on loan with the 26-year-old reportedly needing only to pass a medical to finalise the deal. Schalke will discover their Champions League opponents on Thursday when the group stage draw is made in Monaco (1745 local time) with defending champions Bayern Munich and fellow Bundesliga rivals Borussia Dortmund and Bayer Leverkusen also in the draw."

The Welshman netted in the first leg and scored both goals in the return at the Emirates Stadium, rolling the ball into an empty net in the 25th minute after Lukas Podolski and Theo Walcott combined to set him up. Ramsey then got his second on the night in the 72nd minute with a superb first-time finish on the volley from a Kieran Gibbs assist. That saw Arsenal win 2-0 on the night and progress 5-0 on aggregate, but the loss of Podolski to injury right at the start of the second half took some of the gloss off a fine evening's work for Arsene Wenger's side. With Ramsey also going off before the final whistle with a groin problem pressure will mount on Wenger to buy before the transfer window closes. ""We played a heavy price on the injury front because we lost Podolski. I don't know how bad Ramsey is. I don't know how Wilshere responds to an ankle problem,"" said Wenger. ""He (Wilshere) looks all right. But Podolski is definitely out for 21 days and Ramsey we have to check how severe his groin is tomorrow (Wednesday)."" Semi-finalists in 2011, and knocked out in the last 16 last season, Schalke also returned to the group stage after getting the better of Greek club PAOK. Coached by former Schalke boss Huub Stevens, PAOK held the upper hand in this tie after a 1-1 draw in the first leg in Germany, but some of their advantage was lost by the fact that the return at their own Stadio Toumbia was played behind closed doors. Robbed of their passionate support, PAOK then lost their advantage in the tie when Atsuto Uchida squared for Adam Szalai to put Schalke ahead just before the interval. The hosts turned up the pressure in the second half and got their reward when Stefanos Athanasiadis fired home, and Schalke were then reduced to 10 men when Jermaine Jones was shown a second yellow card just after the hour. However, Julian Draxler put the Bundesliga club back in front, leaving PAOK - who were late replacements for banned Ukrainian club Metalist Kharkiv - needing to score twice to progress. The veteran Kostas Katsouranis got one, but Draxler set up Szalai to clinch a 3-2 win on the night for Schalke, who progress 4-3 on aggregate. Elsewhere, 1986 European champions Steaua Bucharest of Romania returned to the group stage for the first time since the 2008-09 season after sneaking past Legia Warsaw on away goals. After the first leg ended in a 1-1 draw, early goals from Nicolae Stanciu and Federico Piovaccari effectively ended the tie as a contest. Legia came back to draw 2-2 on the night, but the 3-3 aggregate saw Steaua progress. Swiss champions Basel enjoyed smoother progress, beating Bulgaria's Ludogorets Razgrad 2-0 for a 6-2 aggregate success. Fabian Frei and Philipp Degen got the goals for last season's Europa League semi-finalists. Meanwhile, Austria Vienna became the first club from the country to reach the group stage since Rapid Vienna in 2005 with a 4-3 aggregate victory against Dinamo Zagreb. Leading 2-0 from the first leg, the Austrians took an early lead on the night only for the Croats to score three, leaving them in the driving seat. However, a late Roman Kienast goal clinched the hosts' progress. The remaining play-off ties will be played on Wednesday, including AC Milan against PSV Eindhoven, Real Sociedad against Lyon, and Celtic against Shakhter Karagandy of Kazakhstan, with the Scots looking to overturn a 2-0 first-leg deficit."

495,24/08/2013,18:01,"Football: Ribery, Robben strike as Bayern earn third win","Bayern Munich earned their third straight win of the season with a 2-0 victory over Nuremberg on Saturday, but still found themselves third on goal difference in the Bundesliga.","French winger Franck Ribery's header on 69 minutes broke the deadlock before Dutch star Arjen Robben scored for Pep Guardiola's European champions who had missed a first-half penalty. The win at Munich's sold-out Allianz Arena in front of 71,000 fans marks the start of a busy seven-day period for Bayern who have an away league game at Freiburg on Tuesday, then travel to Prague for Friday's showdown with Chelsea for UEFA'S Super Cup. Guardiola started with a star-studded attacking midfield with wingers Robben and Ribery either side of Spain's Thiago Alcantara and Germany playmaker Mario Goetze, who made his debut for Bayern after joining from Borussia Dortmund. The hosts rode their luck in the first-half as only the crossbar denied Nuremberg when striker Daniel Ginczek's shot clattered off the underside with Munich goalkeeper Manuel Neuer beaten on 15 minutes. Bayern were awarded a penalty on 33 minutes by referee Christian Dingert when Robben was brought down by Sweden defender Per Nilsson, but the replay showed the Dutchman used his hand to keep the ball from going out. Justice was served when David Alaba's spot kick was saved by Nuremberg goalkeeper Raphael Schaefer. With time running out, Ribery headed home before a crisp shot from Robben on 78 minutes to maintain Bayern's 100 percent record this season in the league. Goal-difference leaves Bayern third behind leaders Borussia Dortmund, who beat Werder Bremen 1-0 at home on Friday, and second-placed Bayer Leverkusen. Schalke, who need to win at Greece's PAOK on Tuesday to progress to the Champions League group stages after drawing 1-1 in Wednesday's play-off first-leg, suffered another confidence-sapping defeat as they lost 2-1 at Hanover 96. The guests had defender Benedikt Hoewedes sent off on 14 minutes for bringing down Hanover striker Mame Diouf with only the goalkeeper to beat and Hungary midfielder Szabolcs Huszti drilled home the penalty. Diouf then headed home three minutes from the break to leave Schalke reeling before striker Adam Szalai pulled one back for Schalke in the second-half. Having also been hammered 4-0 at Wolfsburg last Saturday, Schalke have just one point from their first three games, leaking nine goals and scoring four, leaving them 14th in the table. Another defeat at PAOK will leave coach Jens Keller in a precarious position. Champions League side Leverkusen earned their third straight win with a 4-2 victory at home to Borussia Moenchengladbach with Germany midfielder Sidney Sam scoring twice in front of national coach Joachim Loew. Mainz are the fourth team to maintain a 100 percent record after they enjoyed a 2-0 win at home to VfL Wolfsburg, who had new signing Luiz Gustavo sent off for a second yellow card on just his second appearance since signing from Bayern. Hoffenheim were held to a 3-3 draw at home by Freiburg in an action-packed game which saw each side finish with 10 men and Freiburg coach Christian Streich was banished to the stands. Later on Saturday, Hamburg desperately need a win at Hertha Berlin in the capital after Thorsten Fink's side were pounded 5-1 at home by Hoffenheim last weekend."

497,23/08/2013,18:50,Football: Billionaire investor slams 'amateurish' Hamburg,"A billionaire who has invested in Hamburg has branded the Bundesliga club ""amateurish on all levels"" and called for ex-Bayern Munich coach Felix Magath to become the new president.","Hamburg have taken just a point from their first two Bundesliga games after they followed the 3-3 draw at Schalke on the opening weekend of the season with a 5-1 hammering at home to Hoffenheim last Saturday. Furious coach Thorsten Fink gave his players two days off after the debacle, then threw defender Dennis Aogo and midfielder Tomas Rincon out of the squad to play Hertha Berlin away on Saturday for using the time to fly to Mallorca. ""In my opinion, the club is amateurish on all levels. The Hamburg house isn't so much on fire as ablaze,"" 76-year-old Swiss investor Klaus-Michael Kuehne told Hamburg newspaper Abendblatt. ""I am incredibly disappointed by coach Thorsten Fink, his decisions are incomprehensible to me."" Kuehne called for former Hamburg midfielder Magath - who scored the winning goal for HSV in their 1983 European Cup final triumph against Juventus - to be brought in as president to make structural reforms. Magath also coached Hamburg before leading Bayern to the 2005 and 2006 titles and then Wolfsburg to Bundesliga glory in 2009. ""He could give Hamburg the much-needed boosts,"" Kuehne said of the 60-year-old Magath, who has earned a reputation in Germany as a hard task-master. Kuehne went as far as to call current club manager Oliver Kreuzer ""third division"", branding him ""the wrong man in the wrong place"". In response, Kreuzer, who only took charge in June, told Sky Sports News: ""Mr Kuehne doesn't have a football background and is far away from football business, otherwise he wouldn't make such statements. ""It is a disaster when individuals believe they can defame everyone here."" Having played a key role in providing the finance to bring Dutch midfielder Rafael van der Vaart back to Hamburg from Tottenham Hotspur in August 2012, Kuehne said he will not provide anymore support unless changes are made. ""Without structural reforms, as an investor I am no longer available,"" the Swiss insisted."

""Poldi is a great guy who will really suit Schalke. It would be brilliant,"" said former international Gerald Asamoah who recently moved to Schalke from Greuther Furth. The team are off to a poor start in domestic action with just one point from two matches and are in desperate need of strike power with Dutch veteran Klaas-Jan Huntelaar out for several weeks with a knee problem while Peruvian Jefferson Farfa is also struggling for fitness. It is not the first time the Gelsenkirchen club have shown interest in the Polish-born 28-year-old who has scored 46 goals in 111 appearances for Germany, but their bid to sign him in 2007 failed to materialise."
499,20/08/2013,13:49,Football: Schalke wary of Stevens in Champions League battle,Germany's Schalke 04 go into Wednesday's Champions League play-off first leg against Greece's PAOK Salonika on the back of a Bundesliga hammering and wary of former coach Huub Stevens.,"Schalke were routed 4-0 at Wolfsburg last Saturday when their shredded defence leaked four second-half goals, while they also lost Dutch striker Klaas-Jan Huntelaar for the next four weeks with torn medial ligaments in his right knee. Losing the two-leg play-off, with the return match on August 27 at PAOK's Stadio Toumba, would have financial consequences and Schalke are low on confidence after leaking seven goals in their first two Bundesliga games. The Royal Blues made 27.8 million euros (US$37.2m), not including ticket revenue from the four home games, when they reached the last 16 of last season's Champions League, eventually losing to Turkey's Galatasaray. Schalke fired Stevens in December after a poor run of results and replaced him with current coach Jens Keller. The 59-year-old Stevens coached Schalke in 304 matches from 1996 to 2002 and then had a 15-month period back in Gelsenkirchen until he was sacked last December. Having also worked at German clubs Hamburg, Cologne and Hertha Berlin, Stevens has ominously never lost at Schalke's Veltins Arena as the away coach. ""I am really looking forward to the reunion. Schalke has the first place in my heart,"" said Stevens. Despite a difficult second spell in charge at Schalke, the Dutchman returns to Gelsenkirchen as a legend having steered them to the 1997 UEFA Cup in his first stint as coach, but the Royal Blues are wary. ""Even if Huub is through and through a Schalke man, he will do all he can to try to beat us,"" said Schalke's director of sport Horst Heldt. Defensive midfielder Marco Hoeger also admitted having an uneasy feeling about Steven's return as PAOK replace Metalist Kharkiv, who were thrown out of the competition by UEFA for match-fixing. ""As a team, he knows us closely and will set his team out accordingly,"" said Hoeger. Schalke are aiming to qualify for the Champions League in successive seasons for the first time in their history. ""We will take a giant step forward if we reach the group stages this year,"" said Heldt. ""Three or four years in succession would be optimal, then we could reach the next level."" That would mean threatening Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund's current stranglehold on the Bundesliga title and would also give the Royal Blues a better chance of keeping hold of stars like 19-year-old Julian Draxler. Schalke lie 13th in the Bundesliga after two games and are already five points from the top five, where they want to be, but must stay positive. ""If we fall into self-pity and quarrel with ourselves that will not help for Wednesday,"" warned Hoeger."
500,19/08/2013,02:15,"Football: Arsenal, Milan face tough Champions League trips",Arsenal and AC Milan face daunting Champions League dates in mid-week as 20 teams chase the 10 remaining places in the world's most lucrative club competition.,"Arsenal, runners-up in 2006, have a series of fitness worries ahead of their tricky trip to Istanbul to face Fenerbahce on Wednesday. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Kieran Gibbs both went off injured in the first half of their 3-1 home defeat to Aston Villa on Saturday while right-back Bacary Sagna also had to be replaced after falling awkwardly on the back of his neck late on. They were already without midfielder Mikel Arteta while centre-back Thomas Vermeulen and full-back Nacho Monreal both missed Saturday's clash with back problems. It is in defence that Arsenal are most vulnerable and their absentees in that department could cost them dearly, particularly with former Chelsea nemesis Didier Drogba likely to line up opposite them. Arsenal midfielder Jack Wilshere said the club must rebound quickly. ""We're not happy, we've got to look at ourselves,"" he said. ""We've got a big qualifier coming up and there can be no mistakes now, we've got to push on. We've got to pick ourselves up."" Adding spice to Wednesday's clash is that Fenerbahce's potential participation in the group stage, should they get through, depends on a ruling from the Court of Arbitration for Sport, expected at the end of the month, having been banned from European competition by UEFA for match-fixing in domestic competition. It will be a baptism of fire for AC Milan as the Italians start their season with a trip to PSV Eindhoven on Tuesday. While the Dutch outfit have already played five matches, including the Champions League third qualifying round in which they thumped Belgians Zulte-Waregem 5-0 on aggregate, Milan have yet to take to the field competitively as Italy's Serie A does not kick-off until this coming weekend. It means a daunting trip to Holland for Massimiliano Allegri's men to tackle a side that have won every match they have played this season, scoring 16 goals in the process and conceding only two. PSV's attacking prowess will be a concern to Milan who had a mixed bag in pre-season, including conceding five goals to Manchester City in a friendly in Germany, while they also lost games against Chelsea and Juventus, although they did beat Spaniards Valencia and Brazil's Sao Paolo. The good news for Milan is that Italy striker Mario Balotelli looks set to start despite missing last week's international friendly against Argentina. The importance on reaching the Champions League group stages has not been lost on goalkeeper Christian Abbiati. ""For Milan, participating in the Champions League is fundamental. Milan don't exist without the Champions League,"" he told Sky Sport earlier last week. Milan last missed out on the Champions League group stages in 2008/09 having finished only fifth in Serie A the previous season and Allegri, who was under fire for most of last season, will know that anything other than progress against PSV will likely cost him his job. In other first leg games Schalke 04 have had to change their preparation at the last minute with Greek side PAOK replacing their original opponents Metalist Kharkiv, with the Ukrainians having been banned over a match-fixing scandal in their homeland. Metalist had knocked out PAOK in the third qualifying round but the Greeks were offered a reprieve by their opponents' ban. Portugal's Pacos Ferreira will be looking to make history as they host Russians Zenit St Petersburg, the 2008 Europa League winners. Pacos had never finished higher than sixth in the Portuguese league until their third place last season earned them this opportunity of a first ever Champions League appearance. Bulgarians Ludogorets Razgrad are also looking for a debut group stage appearance as they host Basel. Ludogorets had never even won a European game until this season. Scottish champions Celtic face the long trip to Kazakhstan to face Shakhter Karagandy on Tuesday."

Hofmann replaced Dortmund's other key signing Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, then took a crisp return pass from defender Mats Hummels to drill his shot in off the far post on 75 minutes. Hofmann was then fouled in the area five minutes from time allowing Reus to drill home the penalty for Dortmund's second before Braunschweig pulled one back when Kevin Kratz's 89th-minute corner deflected in off Borussia's Poland striker Robert Lewandowski. It was not the way Lewandowski, Dortmund's top-scorer last season with 24 goals in 31 league games, would have wanted to celebrate his 100th top-flight match, while coach Jurgen Klopp enjoyed his 100th German league win with Borussia. ""Braunschweig stuck to their defensive plan, but in the second-half we had lots of chances,"" said Klopp, as Dortmund enjoyed 66 percent possession and 17 shots on goal compared to Eintracht's four. ""Jonas Hofmann turned the game for us in the right direction, so all-in-all, I'm pleased."" After Aubameyang hit a hat-trick on his German league debut in last weekend's 4-0 rout of Augsburg, the three points leave Dortmund top of the table on goal difference with European champions Bayern Munich and Bayer Leverkusen in joint second.

Berlin drew level when Tunisia striker Sami Allagui's shot bounced in off the chest of Nuremberg centre-back Berkay Dabanli on 61 minutes. Brazilian midfielder Ronny then netted a 79th-minute penalty for Hertha before Kiyotake's late leveller shared the points. On Saturday, defending champions Bayern laboured to a 1-0 win at Eintracht Frankfurt while both Hamburg and Schalke 04 suffered heavy defeats which left Leverkusen in second after their 1-0 win at VfB Stuttgart. Croatia striker Mario Mandzukic gave Bayern the three points at Frankfurt when he volleyed home a cross from Germany's Thomas Mueller on 13 minutes. It was a rare highlight in a below-par performance as Bayern failed to dominate, despite enjoying 70 percent possession, while Frankfurt captain Alex Meier had a goal ruled offside and a penalty appeal turned down in the dying stages. Bayern coach Pep Guardiola, taking charge of only his second Bundesliga match, started with Dutch winger Arjen Robben, Germany star Mario Goetze and new-signing Thiago Alcantara all on the bench.

""I didn't like the fact we fell apart,"" said Hamburg coach Thorsten Fink. ""We were very, very, very bad defensively, it was an example of how not to defend. ""We don't have to sugarcoat anything, we just have to work hard and win back the fans' trust."" Mainz enjoyed a 2-1 win at Freiburg while Champions League side Bayer Leverkusen picked up their second win of the season with a 1-0 victory at VfB Stuttgart thanks to an own goal by the hosts' defender Daniel Schwaab. Bremen also enjoyed another win, a 1-0 victory at home to Bavaria's Augsburg. Later Borussia Moenchengladbach host Hanover 96 while on Sunday, Champions League finalists Broussia Dortmund host promoted Eintracht Braunschweig and Hertha are at Nuremberg."
506,17/08/2013,17:43,Football: Bayern fail to impress in win at Frankurt,European champions Bayern Munich laboured to a 1-0 win at Eintracht Frankfurt while both Hamburg and Champions League side Schalke 04 suffered heavy defeats in the Bundesliga on Saturday.,"Croatia striker Mario Mandzukic gave Bayern the three points at Eintracht, who were humbled 6-1 at Hertha Berlin the previous weekend, when he volleyed home a cross from Germany's Thomas Mueller on 13 minutes. But it was a rare highlight in a below-par performance as Bayern failed to dominate Eintracht, whose captain Alex Maier had a clear penalty appeal turned down in the dying stages. Before the match, Bayern's director of sport Matthias Sammer told German daily Bild that the defending champions must raise their standards. ""At the moment, others (in the league) may feel that they have a hope against us, but we have to make sure they get the feeling again that they have no chance,"" he said, but his words failed to fire the Bavarians in Frankfurt. Bayern coach Pep Guardiola, taking charge of only his second Bundesliga match, started with Dutch winger Arjen Robben, Germany star Mario Goetze and new-signing Thiago Alcantara all on the bench, while Spain's Javi Martinez failed to even make the matchday squad. Brazil midfielder Luiz Gustavo, who signed for Wolfsburg last week from Bayern after rejecting offers from Arsenal and Barcelona, made his Wolves' debut in their 4-0 win at home to Champions League side Schalke 04. The Royal Blues lost Holland striker Klaas-Jan Huntelaar at the break with a knee injury and the hosts took full advantage with three goals in 12 second-half minutes by defender Knoche, Portugal midfielder Vieirinha and Brazil defender Naldo. Wolfsburg striker Stefan Kutschke then hit the fourth just five minutes after coming off the bench. Having drawn 3-3 at Hamburg last Sunday, Schalke need to find some form ahead of their Champions League play-off first-leg at home to Greece's PAOK on August 28. Hamburg were humiliated 5-1 at home to Hoffenheim as Brazilian striker Roberto Firmino ran riot, scoring twice and setting up the other three. Firmino's forward partner, Frenchman Anthony Modeste, a new signing from French league outfit Bastia, had plenty to boast about with two well-taken second-half goals. Mainz enjoyed a 2-1 win at Freiburg while Champions League side Bayer Leverkusen picked up their second win of the season with a 1-0 victory at VfB Stuttgart thanks to an own goal by the hosts' defender Daniel Schwaab. Bremen also enjoyed another win on the second weekend of the Bundesliga season with a 1-0 victory at home to Bavaria's Augsburg. Later Borussia Moenchengladbach host Hanover 96 while on Sunday, Champions League finalists Broussia Dortmund host promoted Eintracht Braunschweig and Hertha are at Nuremberg."
507,16/08/2013,02:15,Football: Robben relaxed as Goetze set for Bayern debut,Arjen Robben has said Mario Goetze's imminent league debut for Bayern Munich can only be a good thing for the defending champions ahead of Saturday's Bundesliga trip to Eintracht Frankfurt.,"Goetze, 21, came off the bench and scored twice for Bayern in Sunday's friendly win at Hungarian champions FC Gyor, his first appearance since tearing a hamstring while playing for previous club Borussia Dortmund in the Champions League semi-finals last season. Having cost Bayern 37 million euros (US$49.2m), Goetze is another top name coach Pep Guardiola needs to accomodate in his star-studded midfield. Goetze is an option alongside Spain Under-21 captain Thiago Alcantara in an attacking midfield role, flanked by France winger Franck Ribery and Germany's Thomas Mueller, leaving Dutchman Robben on the bench. The 29-year-old, who scored Bayern's winning goal in May's Champions League final against Dortmund, only returned to the starting line-up last season after injury to Toni Kroos, but the he said competition for places is a healthy thing in the Bayern ranks. ""It was our strength last season that we never lost our quality, even when players dropped out with injury,"" Robben told German daily Bild. ""You have to trust yourself and not be afraid of the opposition. ""And with a World Cup at the end of the season, even if you sit out the occasional game, it could be a positive thing at the end of the day."" With 10 full international midfielders in the Bayern squad, Brazil's Luiz Gustavo is on the verge of a move to VfL Wolfsburg according to reports while Munich travel to a Frankfurt side who are licking their wounds just now. While Bayern kicked off the season with a 3-1 win over Borussia Moenchengladbach last Friday, Eintracht were hammered 6-1 at promoted Hertha Berlin. And they could be forgiven for feeling a sense of trepidation ahead of this weekend's game, given that Bayern have not lost in any of their last 19 away matches in the Bundesliga. Bayern's Spain star Javi Martinez will also be looking to maintain his remarkable Bundesliga record of having yet to lose a German league match after 25 wins and three draws. Champions League finalists Dortmund host promoted Eintracht Braunschweig on Sunday with Germany midfielder Ilkay Gundogan out for two weeks with a back injury he aggravated playing for his country in Wednesday's 3-3 draw with Paraguay. Dortmund got off to a flying start last weekend when Gabon forward Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang scored a hat-trick on his Bundesliga debut in the 4-0 win at Augsburg. And Poland striker Robert Lewandowski is set to make his 100th league appearance having scored 55 goals in Germany's top flight. Having won promotion, Braunschweig went down to a late goal at Werder Bremen last weekend. Their coach Torsten Lieberknecht and Dortmund boss Jurgen Klopp were teammates at Mainz between 1995 and 2001, while Lieberknecht's last five games for Mainz came with Klopp as coach. Hertha are flying high after their 6-1 victory at home to Frankfurt which went down as the biggest win on the opening day of the season for any newly-promoted club in Germany's top flight. Having spent last season in Germany's second tier, the club from the capital's result left them as the surprise league leaders after the first week. ""The standings are just a snapshot, if we get beaten 6-1 next week, no one will be interested in what happened against Frankfurt anymore,"" said Hertha captain Fabian Lustenberger.

510,13/08/2013,02:05,Football: Germany face Paraguay on the path to Brazil,Germany host Paraguay in Wednesday's friendly with head coach Joachim Loew looking to fine-tune his side for next month's World Cup qualifiers on the road to Brazil 2014.,"Loew has named a powerful squad with nine players from European champions Bayern Munich and Champions League finalists Borussia Dortmund. Bayern's star midfielders Bastian Schweinsteiger and Mario Goetze, who are both regaining fitness after injury, are the only noticable absentee as Loew looks to prepare for September's qualifiers against Austria and the Faroe Islands. Schalke's teenage attacking midfielder Julian Draxler was forced out on Sunday after injuring his Achilles tendon in the 3-3 Bundesliga draw with Hamburg. ""We're really looking forward to the game,"" said Germany manager Oliver Bierhoff ahead of the friendly in Kaiserslautern with the hosts ranked second in the world and Paraguay are 49th. ""It's our first match of a season which will finish with the World Cup and we want to play with renewed enthusiasm. ""The match is important for everyone with a view towards the important qualifiers in September against Austria and the Faroe Islands. ""We want to qualify as quickly as possible and our match against Paraguay is a step towards that goal."" Germany are five points clear at the top of Group C in the European World Cup qualifying pool and two wins next month will leave Loew's team on course to book their Brazil 2014 berth in October's away matches in Sweden and the Republic of Ireland. Paraguay are out of the running in the South American qualifying group as they are bottom of the table. Coached by Victor Genes, Paraguay return to Kaiserslautern's Fritz Walter Stadium where they enjoyed a victory over Trinidad and Tobago at the 2006 World Cup. Genes has called up 15 foreign-based players in his 21-man squad, the most interesting name being Barcelona's 17-year-old forward Antonio Sanabria, who has risen through his country's junior teams and wins his first selection for the senior side. Sanabria's teammate from the Paraguay Under-20 side, Jorge Rojas, is also on the plane to Germany and the Benfica winger has considerable pace. Notable absentees include ex-Borussia Dortmund striker Lucas Barrios, who has just completed a move from China's Guangzhou Evergrande to Russia's Spartak Moscow as Genes favours youth over experience. Loew has named two strikers in his squad in Fiorentina's Mario Gomez and Lazio's Miroslav Klose. The 35-year-old Klose is on 67 goals for his country, just one short of Gerd Mueller's astonishing record of 68 goals in 62 games for West Germany from 1966-74. Both Dortmund midfielders Ilkay Gundogan and Marco Reus sat out training on Monday as a precautionary measure. Gundogan had a sore back while fleet-footed winger Reus, who scored twice in Germany's 4-1 win over Kazakhstan in March, has a light cold, but both are expected to train with the team on Tuesday."

Schalke's new-signing Adam Szalai scored the Royal Blues' crucial third goal to share the points with Hamburg while Gabon forward Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang marked his Dortmund debut with a hat-trick. Mainz's Shinji Okazaki of Japan and Leverkusen's South Korea star Son Heung-Min both also scored on their respective debuts. But there was bad news for Germany coach Joachim Loew as Schalke's teenage midfielder Julian Draxler withdrew from Wednesday's international friendly against Paraguay. The 19-year-old attacking midfielder limped off after only 23 minutes against Hamburg having damaged his left Achilles tendon. ""The injury could quickly get inflamed and turn into a long drawn-out affair, so it makes no sense (for him to play on Wednesday),"" said Schalke team manager Horst Heldt. Schalke took the lead at home to Hamburg when Holland striker Klaas-Jan Huntelaar struck after just 84 seconds before compatriot Rafael van der Vaart netted a 12th-minute penalty to level. Striker Maximilian Beister produced a bullet header on 24 minutes to put Hamburg in front before Huntelaar levelled right at the end of the first half. Ex-Dortmund defender Lasse Sobiech then headed the hosts ahead just after half-time before Hungary's Szalai, who joined Schalke from Mainz in the summer, pounced on a mistake by Hamburg goalkeeper Rene Adler on 72 minutes for a share of the points. Okazaki netted in Mainz 05's 3-2 home win over his ex-club VfB Stuttgart -- who he left last month. Mainz picked up three points when Germany midfielder Nicolai Mueller netted goals either side of Okazaki's 65th-minute strike. Mueller scored his first after just 14 minutes, but Bosnia striker Vedad Ibisevic levelled just two minutes later. Okazaki, who joined Mainz on July 1 in a three-year deal after two years at Stuttgart, slotted home his team's second when he converted a cross from Czech Republic defender Zdenek Pospech before Meuller made it 3-1, 12 minutes from time. Stuttgart's Martin Harnik gave his side hope with eight minutes left to make it 3-2, but Mainz hung on. Aubameyang, 24, showed why Dortmund paid French League Cup winners St Etienne 13 million euros (US$17.3m) for him as he became the sixth player in Bundesliga history to hit three goals on his debut. Poland striker Robert Lewandowski converted a penalty in the dying stages to complete Augsburg's misery. South Korea's Son also netted on his first competitive appearance for Champions League hopefuls Bayer Leverkusen in their 3-1 win at home to Freiburg. Hertha Berlin marked their return to the top-flight after a year's absence with a stunning 6-1 rout of Eintracht Frankfurt. Colombia striker Adrian Ramos and Tunisia forward Sami Allagui each scored twice in the hammering at Berlin's Olympic Stadium while a first-half penalty from Eintracht Frankfurt midfielder Alex Meier was all the guests could muster. Hanover 96 enjoyed a 2-0 win over Wolfsburg, who finished with nine men after both midfielder Maximilian Arnold and Swiss defender Timm Klose were sent off. Hoffenheim were held to a 2-2 draw at home to Nuremberg while Werder Bremen edged newly-promoted Eintracht Braunschweig 1-0 with Austria midfielder Zlatko Junuzovic hitting the 82-minute winner."

Having made six international appearances, Draxler has been ruled out of Germany's friendly in Kaiserslautern as Germany head coach Joachim Loew prepares for next month's World Cup qualifiers against Austria and the Faroe Islands. ""The injury could quickly get inflamed and turn into a long drawn-out affair, so it makes no sense (for him to play on Wednesday),"" said Schalke team manager Horst Heldt. Heldt said it would be ""tight"" for Draxler to be fit for Schalke's next Bundesliga match against VfL Wolfsburg on Saturday.

""Aubameyang was used to great effect,"" said Dortmund coach Jurgen Klopp. ""I am not surprised about what he has to offer, only the fact that most of his shots went in. It's a very good start from us."" Aubameyang became the sixth player in Bundesliga history to hit three goals on his debut. He opened his account by heading home a Marcel Schmelzer cross from the left wing to put Dortmund ahead after 24 minutes. Aubameyang celebrated with his trademark forward somersault, then doubled Dortmund's advantage when he slipped his marker and fired home across the goal on 66 minutes. The Gabon star went on to convert a great pass from Robert Lewandowski on 79 minutes to wrap up his hat-trick before the Poland striker converted a penalty in the dying stages. South Korea striker Heung-Min Son also scored on his first competitive appearance for Champions League side Bayer Leverkusen in their 3-1 win at home to Freiburg. Germany striker Stefan Kiessling put the hosts ahead with 22 minutes gone, but Freiburg's new signing Mike Hanke levelled just before the break. Son restored Leverkusen's lead just two minutes after the break when he fired home from close range after a final pass from Sidney Sam. Germany midfielder Sam then converted Kiessling's cross to seal the win with 52 minutes gone, while Leverkusen goalkeeper Bernd Leno protected his side's lead when he saved a 67th-minute penalty from Jonathan Schmid. Hertha Berlin marked their return to the top-flight after a year's absence with a 6-1 rout of Eintracht Frankfurt. Colombia striker Adrian Ramos and Tunisia forward Sami Allagui each scored twice in the hammering at Berlin's Olympic Stadium while a first-half penalty from Eintracht Frankfurt midfielder Alex Meier was all the guests could muster. ""The performance was sensational,"" said Hertha coach Jos Luhukay. ""From the first minute, we made sure Frankfurt failed to find their rhythm. ""We have our first three points, it was a good start, but now we need to get back to business and improve on it."" Hanover 96 enjoyed a 2-0 win over Wolfsburg, who finished with nine men after both midfielder Maximilian Arnold and Swiss defender Timm Klose were sent off. Arnold was shown a straight red card with just 32 minutes gone for a bad tackle on Hanover's Tunisia defender Karim Haggui, while Klose was sent off seven minutes after the break for his second yellow card. Hoffenheim were held to a 2-2 draw at home to Nuremberg while Werder Bremen enjoyed a 1-0 win at newly-promoted Eintracht Braunschweig with Austria midfielder Zlatko Junuzovic hitting the 82-minute winner. On Sunday, Mainz host Stuttgart and Hamburg are at Schalke."
