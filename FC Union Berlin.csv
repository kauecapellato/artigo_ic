0,21/01/2021,19:32,Union's Huebner banned but 'no evidence' found of racial abuse towards Amiri,"The German FA (DFB) on Thursday said there was ""no evidence"" that Union Berlin's Florian Huebner racially abused Bayer Leverkusen midfielder Nadiem Amiri, but gave the defender a two-match ban and 20,000-euro ($24,292) fine.","Huebner was alleged to have used a racist insult against German-born Amiri, whose parents are from Afghanistan, after the pair argued following Union's 1-0 Bundesliga win in the capital last Friday. But the DFB said ""no evidence of a racially motivated or discriminatory act could be provided"" and instead banned Huebner for ""unsportsmanlike conduct"". ""Even Nadiem Amiri could not rule out during the investigations that the choice of words was different,"" the DFB said in a statement. The disciplinary committee said both players had apologised to each other for their ""respective misconduct"". Huebner said in a statement on the Union Berlin website that he was ""glad that the matter has been settled quickly"". ""It is of fundamental importance to me that the sports tribunal and the German FA assume that I myself had previously been verbally attacked and that my comments were not discriminatory or racist in any way,"" he added. ""Any kind of xenophobia and discrimination is deeply abhorred in my family and by me. ""I have spoken to my opponent Nadiem Amiri and we have cleared everything up. This also includes admitting a mistake to each other."" The 29-year-old will miss Saturday's game at mid-table Augsburg and the home game against Borussia Moenchengladbach on January 30."
1,15/01/2021,22:46,Union down Leverkusen to climb to fourth,Union Berlin claimed another key Bundesliga scalp at home on Friday as a late goal sealed a 1-0 win over Bayer Leverkusen which put the hosts fourth in the table.,"Having hit the post earlier, Union's replacement forward Cedric Teuchert sprinted onto a pass which split Leverkusen's defence and fired home winning goal two minutes from time. The 24-year-old made amends for squandering a golden chance six minutes after the break when his shot beat Lukas Hradecky, smashed the post and rolled agonisingly along the goalline and away to safety. Having shocked Borussia Dortmund at the Alten Foersterei stadium four weeks ago, Union now sit just a point behind third-placed Leverkusen. The victory could have come at a cost as Teuchert replaced Union's Dutch striker Sheraldo Becker, who was helped off after just 24 minutes with an ankle injury. On Saturday, RB Leipzig can go top of the table if they beat Wolfsburg. A Leipzig win would bridge the two-point gap behind embattled leaders Bayern Munich, who host Freiburg on Sunday. Bayern are under pressure after last weekend's league defeat at Borussia Moenchengladbach and the midweek German Cup exit at second division Holstein Kiel."
2,02/01/2021,23:20,Olmo fires RB Leipzig top of Bundesliga ahead of Bayern Munich,RB Leipzig dislodged Bayern Munich at the top of the Bundesliga table Saturday as Dani Olmo's second-half goal was enough to seal a 1-0 win at Stuttgart.,"""It was really good for me and the team to start the year with a win,"" Olmo told DAZN. With European champions Bayern at home to strugglers Mainz on Sunday, Leipzig took the chance to go a point ahead as Olmo fired through the legs of Stuttgart goalkeeper Gregor Kobel. Stuttgart's Swiss shot-stopper had earlier pulled off some heroics by using his foot to save a Emil Forsberg first-half penalty attempt. Leipzig also wasted a golden chance when Amadou Haidara fired wide just after the break. With 23 minutes left, Spain midfielder Olmo finally got the breakthrough, finishing a move he started after Leipzig had moved the ball across the Stuttgart penalty area. ""It feels good to be top,"" admitted Leipzig defender Willi Orban. ""The first half was good, the second was better - we were clearly the dominant team."" Earlier, Bayer Leverkusen blew the chance to take first place after stumbling to a 2-1 defeat at Eintracht Frankfurt which saw them drop to third as the league resumed after a two-week break. ""I have made my feelings clear in the dressing room,"" Leverkusen head coach Peter Bosz told Sky. ""We deserved to lose. Frankfurt had a better claim to the victory."" Leverkusen midfielder Nadiem Amiri scored with a deft back-heel flick to give the visitors the lead after only 10 minutes in Frankfurt. However, Amin Younes equalised to make it 1-1 at half-time before Japan midfielder Daichi Kamada put in a cross which Leverkusen defender Edmond Tapsoba turned into his own net. Before kickoff, Frankfurt director Fredi Bobic confirmed reports his club are interested in Bayern's teenage striker Joshua Zirkzee, 19, after selling Dutch forward Bas Dost to Brugge. Zirkzee could back up Frankfurt's top scorer Andre Silva, who has notched nine league goals this season. Union Berlin rose to fourth - into the Champions League places for the first time in the club's history - after their 2-0 win at Werder Bremen. Liverpool loanee Taiwo Awoniyi, who has scored in his last three league games, capped another impressive display with a goal and assist. After Bremen lost the ball in their own half, the 23-year-old Nigeria international took advantage of a two-on-two situation by drawing the defence and passing to Sheraldo Becker, who fired home on 12 minutes. Awoniyi doubled Union's lead on 28 minutes by tapping the ball over the line, just out of the reach of Bremen goalkeeper Jiri Pavlenka. Bremen had a penalty appeal turned down when a shot by Japan midfielder Yuya Osako clipped the hand of a Union defender, then Romano Schmid had a goal ruled offside. Hoffenheim lost both defender Kevin Akpoguma and Germany midfielder Sebastian Rudy with early leg injuries as they crashed to a 3-1 home defeat to Freiburg. With the hosts struggling to reshuffle, Freiburg were 3-0 up at half-time thanks to a Baptiste Santamaria goal, a Vincenzo Grifo penalty and an own goal by Senegal defender Kasim Adams. Hoffenheim scored a second-half consolation goal through Togo winger Ihlas Bebou. Borussia Moenchengeladbach, who host Manchester City in the first leg of the Champions League last 16 next month, earned their first win in five league games with a 1-0 victory at Arminia Bielefeld. Swiss striker Breel Embolo netted the winning goal just after half-time when he held off a defender and fired home. Mid-table Augsburg rebounded after back-to-back defeats with a 1-0 win at Cologne with Brazilian winger Iago netting the late winner. Bottom side Schalke are now 30 games without a win -- one short of the Bundesliga record -- after a 3-0 defeat away to Hertha Berlin. Former Tottenham manager Christian Gross, installed as Schalke's fourth head coach this season, got off to a losing start as Arsenal loanee Matteo Guendouzi, Colombia striker Jhon Cordoba and his replacement, Poland forward Krzysztof Piatek, scored for Hertha. Having netted two minutes after coming off the bench, Piatek had a second late goal ruled offside."
3,18/12/2020,23:11,Moukoko becomes youngest Bundesliga scorer as Dortmund flop at Union,Borussia Dortmund's Bundesliga title aspirations suffered a fresh dent on Friday as they crashed to a 2-1 defeat at Union Berlin on the night their striker Youssoufa Moukoko became the league's youngest ever goalscorer.,"After Liverpool loanee Taiwo Awoniyi headed Union into the lead early in the second half, Moukoko leapt into the air to celebrate making history when he equalised for Dortmund aged just 16 years and 28 days. Moukoko broke the previous record of Leverkusen's Florian Wirtz, who was 17 years, 34 days when he scored against Bayern Munich in June. However, Moukoko's delight was short-lived as Dortmund again conceded from a set-piece with Union centre-back Marvin Friedrich heading the winner from a corner with 12 minutes left. ""We have now lost two league games through set-pieces -- that's a disaster,"" Dortmund defender Mats Hummels fumed to DAZN, also referring to November's 2-1 shock home defeat to Cologne. ""We're simply beating ourselves up, that can't be allowed to happen."" Saturday's 5-1 thrashing at home to Stuttgart cost head coach Lucien Favre his job, but Dortmund's defensive woes were exposed again by Union, who also beat them 3-1 in eastern Berlin last season. Despite bouncing back in mid-week with a 2-1 win at Werder Bremen under caretaker coach Edin Terzic, Dortmund were again punished for yielding possession easily and sloppy defending. This is Dortmund's fifth defeat this season, leaving them fourth in the table, six points behind Leverkusen who host Bayern Munich in Saturday's top-of-the-table clash. Union, who held European champions Bayern to a 1-1 draw in their previous home game, climb to fifth, just a point behind Dortmund. They deservedly took the lead behind closed doors when Awoniyi slipped his marker Giovanni Reyna and headed past Dortmund goalkeeper Roman Buerki on 57 minutes. ""The fact that an opposing striker was so free is unforgivable,"" Hummels complained after the final whistle. Having previously hit the Union woodwork, Moukoko made history three minutes later when he stabbed home the equaliser, but Friedrich was left alone in the area to head the winning goal in off the post. ""It's great that we win the game through two set-pieces,"" Union captain Christopher Trimmel told ZDF. ""There was a lot of passion, no opponent has it easy against us."" The Bundesliga starts a two-week winter break after this weekend and Dortmund have a tough month ahead in January when they face RB Leipzig, Bayer Leverkusen and Borussia Moenchengladbach. However, Moukoko clearly has a bright future after now claiming three records in the last month. ""You have to congratulate the young 16-year-old on his Bundesliga goal, that's something very special,"" Trimmel added graciously. Moukoko also became the Champions League's youngest player ten days ago, coming off the bench in the win at Zenit St Petersburg with Dortmund through to the last 16 where they face Sevilla. He also became the youngest player in Bundesliga history on November 21 -- the day after his 16th birthday."
4,12/12/2020,20:30,Bayern Munich stay top after Lewandowski equaliser at Union,Robert Lewandowski marked his 200th Bundesliga appearance for Bayern Munich with a second-half equaliser in Saturday's 1-1 draw at Union Berlin which keeps the defending champions top on goal difference.,"After Grischa Proemel put Union ahead on four minutes, Lewandowski, the Bundesliga's top-scorer, slotted his 13th goal in his 10th league game to rescue a point on 67 minutes. The result keeps Bayern top, but level on 24 points with RB Leipzig, who briefly led the table after their 2-0 win over Werder Bremen earlier Saturday. Union stay sixth, two points behind Dortmund who crashed to a 5-1 defeat against VfB Stuttgart in their worst home defeat since 2009."
5,11/12/2020,02:42,Bayern star Lewandowski eyes league milestones at Union Berlin,"Robert Lewandowski, the German league's top-scorer, can make his 200th Bundesliga appearance for Bayern Munich in Saturday's tricky away match at FC Union, where Germany's leading clubs have struggled in the past.","In fact, Lewandowski could claim two milestones in Berlin as he is just two short of scoring 250 Bundesliga goals for both Bayern and ex-club Dortmund. Lewandowski has shaken off a leg knock which ruled him out of Wednesday's 2-0 home win over Lokomotiv Moscow in the Champions League with the holders already through to the last 16 as group winners. ""I assume that he is 100 per cent fit,"" said Bayern coach Hansi Flick before they headed to Berlin. Lewandowski, the Bundesliga's top scorer for the last three seasons, once again leads the way with 12 goals so far. Two of his closest rivals - Dortmund's Erling Braut Haaland, who has 10 goals, and Leverkusen's Lucas Alario, on seven - are sidelined by knee injuries. Bayern hold a one point lead over Bayer Leverkusen, who they face away the following weekend. Union's eight-match winning run was ended last Friday by a 3-1 derby defeat at Hertha Berlin. To make matters worse, Union's top-scorer Max Kruse, who claimed five goals and four assists in November, misses Saturday's game against Bayern with a torn hamstring. Even without Kruse, Union coach Urs Fischer is looking forward to the ""awesome task"" of facing the league leaders and European champions. ""We will try to be brave and get through the difficult phases. We must not lose the courage to attack,"" added Fischer, whose side are sixth. Union's Swiss coach has just signed a contract extension, reportedly until 2023. In the two years since his arrival, Fischer has turned Union into a side capable of tripping up sides at the top of the league. Last season, both Dortmund and Moenchengladbach were first in the table when they lost at Union's packed Alten Foersterei stadium, where Bayern laboured to a 2-0 win behind closed doors in May. In recent home games, Union saw off strugglers Mainz 4-0, then Arminia Bielefeld 4-0 before Kruse netted twice in a 3-3 draw with Frankfurt a fortnight ago. Peter Bosz's Leverkusen, who are home to Hoffenheim on Sunday, have climbed to second by joining Wolfsburg as the league's only unbeaten teams. Part of their success is due to Bosz improving Leverkusen's threat at set-pieces and they scored twice from Leon Bailey corners in Sunday's 3-0 win over bottom side Schalke. ""That is a huge factor for us and cannot be overestimated,"" said midfielder Julian Baumgartlinger, who scored with a header against Schalke off a Bailey corner. RB Leipzig's Swedish playmaker is back to his best after a groin strain sidelined him earlier in the year with strong displays against Bayern Munich and Manchester United. After claiming his first headed Bundesliga goal in last weekend's thrilling 3-3 draw at Bayern, Forsberg was a constant menace in Tuesday's 3-2 home win which dumped Manchester United out of the Champions League. Third-placed Leipzig trail Bayern by two points before Saturday's home game against Bremen. 248 - the league goals Lewandowski has scored for Bayern and ex-club Dortmund. Only Munich legend Gerd Mueller and Schalke striker Klaus Fischer have previously reached the 250 goals milestone. 330 - the Bundesliga games Lewandowski has played in his career, including 199 for Bayern. 44 - the Bundesliga games Union Berlin have played in the club's history.

6,04/12/2020,22:45,Piatek double for Hertha in Berlin derby ends Union's unbeaten run,Hertha Berlin replacement striker Krzysztof Piatek scored two goals in three second-half minutes to seal a 3-1 win over 10-man FC Union in the Bundesliga derby on Friday night.,"""It's an amazing feeling to get two goals in the derby,"" Piatek told broadcaster DAZN. Union's eight-match unbeaten run came to an abrupt end behind closed doors at the Olympic Stadium as Hertha enjoyed their first home win this season. Union played for more than an hour with ten men after midfielder Robert Andrich was shown a straight red for going into a challenge with his foot up. Union took the lead when Nigeria striker Taiwo Awoniyi got between two defenders and hit the bottom corner of the net on 20 minutes. However, Union were down to ten men just three minutes later. Andrich went into a tackle on Hertha midfielder Lucas Tousart with his foot up, making no attempt to pull out of the challenge. It stayed 1-0 at the break, but the numerical disadvantage took its toll on Union as Piatek came off the bench at half-time and Hertha managed three unanswered goals. They equalised when Matheus Cunha shot from range and although his shot was parried, right-back Peter Pekarik was on hand to tap home the rebound. It was 2-0 on 74 minutes when Piatek's shot deflected off defender Marvin Friedrich and wrong-footed Union goalkeeper Andreas Luthe. Piatek grabbed his second in style 13 minutes from time when he smashed a volley past Luthe. The visitor's miserable night was summed up when Union's former Germany striker Max Kruse limped off with a knee injury in added time. The result lifts Hertha to 11th in the table with Union sixth."
7,03/12/2020,03:15,Union striker Kruse in spotlight for Berlin derby at Hertha,"Hertha Berlin host capital-city rivals Union Berlin behind closed doors at the Olympic Stadium in Friday's derby, with former Germany striker Max Kruse in stunning form for the visitors, who are on an eight-match unbeaten run.","This will be the third Bundesliga clash between the clubs since Union's promotion in 2018/19 and the second behind closed doors due to the coronavirus pandemic. East Berlin-based Union won a fiery confrontation at home last season with a 90th-minute penalty in November 2019, only for Hertha, who play in the west, to exact revenge with a 4-0 thumping in May. To make their presence felt, Hertha had tens of thousands of flags in the club's blue and white colours planted across Berlin on Monday. ""We're playing a derby without fans, we wanted to create a little derby atmosphere, a little derby fever,"" a Hertha spokesman said on Wednesday. Rival fans were soon posting pictures either posing proudly with their flag or dumping them in the nearest bin -- depending on their loyalties. However, the PR stunt happened without the necessary permit, putting Hertha offside with city authorities, who threatened to fine the club. Union's unbeaten run has taken them to sixth in the table, six points behind leaders Bayern Munich, who they host the following weekend. In contrast, Hertha are 13th and yet to win a home game this season, having been thrashed 5-2 by Borussia Dortmund a fortnight ago with Erling Braut Haaland scoring four goals. Union took a gamble this season by signing the ageing Kruse, 32, a renowned card player who has competed in the World Series of poker, but the transfer has paid dividends. He made the last of his 14 appearances for Germany five years ago, yet Kruse has banged in five goals and made four assists in his last four games. He came to the rescue last Saturday by scoring twice, including a late equaliser to salvage a point in a 3-3 home draw with Eintracht Frankfurt. ""Hopefully Max will be important in the derby,"" said Union coach Urs Fischer. ""He's a great guy and he's shown that he knows when he has to work hard. I'm happy. He's there for the team and it's gone exactly as I expected."" Fischer's opposite number Bruno Labbadia made it clear how difficult it will be to stop the Union forward. ""You have to keep him in check collectively,"" added Labbadia, who is without injured Argentine midfielder Santiago Ascacibar and Colombia striker Jhon Cordoba."
8,07/11/2020,18:33,"Leipzig go top in Germany ahead of Bayern, Dortmund showdown",RB Leipzig went back to the top of the Bundesliga table on Saturday with a 3-0 home win over Freiburg before Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund clash in the evening showdown.,"Defender Ibrahima Konate fired home Leipzig's opener before midfielder Marcel Sabitzer added their second goal with a 70th-minute penalty. Manchester City loanee Angelino claimed Leipzig's third with a stunning free-kick which curled over the Freiburg wall just before the final whistle. The home win put Leipzig top, a point ahead of Bayern and Dortmund who meet later at Signal Iduna Park. ""We really deserved the win - we were very, very good in the first-half,"" said Leipzig head coach Julian Nagelsmann. He was especially pleased with Konate's opening goal from a towering cross before winger Christopher Nkunku, who scored in the mid-week win over Paris Saint Germain, won the penalty which Sabitzer converted after the VAR scrutinised the decision. ""We have trained a lot from set pieces,"" said Nagelsmann. ""It certainly wasn't an obvious penalty, but if the VAR says it was, then it must have been,"" he added after Nkunku went down after the slightest of touches from Freiburg defender Nicolas Hoefler. Union Berlin climbed to fourth with a 5-0 home thrashing of strugglers Arminia Bielefeld. Former Germany striker Max Kruse helped set up Union's first three goals, then converted a late penalty. After just three minutes, Japan winger Keita Endo scored his first goal for Union when he swept home Sheraldo Becker's final pass after Kruse's superb long pass. Endo went off with an injury soon after, but Union kept up the pressure as Kruse set up the next two goals for centre-back Robert Andrich and winger Becker. Kruse, 32, capped an outstanding display by converting a penalty before Cedric Teuchert, a right wing replacement for Becker, grabbed Union's late fourth goal. At the other end of the table, bottom side Mainz were held to a 2-2 draw at home to Schalke, who sit one place above them and have now gone 23 games without a league win dating back to January. After Daniel Brosinski and Jean-Philippe Mateta converted penalties for Mainz, Mark Uth pulled a goal back for Schalke who were 2-1 down late on. Schalke took a deserved point back to Gelsenkirchen when Mainz defender Jeremiah St. Juste turned the ball into his own net eight minutes from time. After five games without a win, Hertha Berlin roared back with a 3-0 win in the fog at Augsburg. Forwards Matheus Cunha, Dodi Lukebakio and Krzysztof Piatek, who cost Hertha 24 million euros ($28 million) from AC Milan in January, got on the scoresheet as Augsburg's defence crumbled."
9,24/10/2020,18:30,Lewandowski hits hat-trick as Bayern Munich rout Frankfurt,Robert Lewandowski took his Bundesliga tally to 10 goals in five games this season with a hat-trick as Bayern Munich thumped Eintracht Frankfurt 5-0 on Saturday.,"Lewandowski has scored nine goals in his last three league games and wrapped up his treble within an hour at the Allianz Arena. Defending champions Bayern have scored 22 goals this term -- 10 more than league leaders RB Leipzig who stayed top with a 2-1 win over 10-man Hertha Berlin. Bayern sit one point behind in second place. In Munich, Leroy Sane marked his return from injury with the fourth goal during a brief cameo, before England Under-17 midfielder Jamal Musiala also came off the bench to net the fifth. However, Bayern's victory could come at a price as Canadian left-back Alphonso Davies was in clear distress after going off early with an ankle injury. Lewandowski underlined his status as one of the world's best strikers last season by scoring a career-best 55 goals in 47 games, including 34 in the Bundesliga. The Polish international opened the scoring on 10 minutes when he fired home after a Thomas Mueller pass. Frankfurt goalkeeper Kevin Trapp couldn't do anything to stop Lewandowski's header from a Joshua Kimmich corner in the 26th minute. Bayern had a penalty appeal turned down when Douglas Costa's cross clipped the hand of Frankfurt's Makoto Hasebe. Lewandowski wrapped up the victory on the hour mark with a clinical finish from another Costa cross. After sitting out the last two games, Sane ghosted past a defender and drove a shot into the bottom corner with 18 minutes to play. Manuel Neuer pulled off a great save to deny Frankfurt striker Bas Dost before Musiala grabbed the final goal as the visitors suffered their first league defeat of the season. Leipzig came from behind to seal a 2-1 win over Hertha, whose Colombian striker Jhon Cordoba scored in the eighth minute. Leipzig drew level when defender Dayot Upamecano fired home from a free-kick on 11 minutes, but Berlin were reduced to 10 men after the break when substitute Deyovaisio Zeefuik was shown two yellow cards within four minutes of coming on. Leipzig made the man advantage count when Marcel Sabitzer converted a penalty with 13 minutes left. Hertha were lucky not to finish with nine men when another sub, Jessic Ngankam, scythed down Leipzig left-back Angelino and the referee changed his decision to a yellow card having initially showed a straight red. Borussia Moenchengladbach warmed up for Tuesday's Champions League game at home to Real Madrid with a 3-2 comeback win at Mainz. Germany midfielder Lars Stindl gave Gladbach an early lead, but the visitors were 2-1 down at half-time after French striker Jean-Philippe Mateta scored twice for Mainz. Gladbach midfielder Jonas Hofmann converted a penalty on 76 minutes, after a shot by replacement Marcus Thuram was blocked by a Mainz hand before Matthias Ginter headed the winner as Gladbach climbed to fifth. Union Berlin were held to a 1-1 draw at home to Freiburg as Vincenzo Grifo's first-half goal was cancelled out two minutes later by Union midfielder Robert Andrich."
10,18/10/2020,20:09,Pacienca header earns Schalke's first point of the season,Bundesliga crisis club Schalke picked up their first point of the season on Sunday as Goncalo Paciencia's second-half equaliser rescued a 1-1 draw at home to Union Berlin.,"Paciencia's 69th minute header ended a nightmare start to the season for Schalke, who began the day with no points and one goal from their first three games. After a cagey first half, Marvin Friedrich nodded in a Christopher Trimmel cross to put Union ahead shortly after the break. Schalke coach Manuel Baum, who replaced David Wagner last month, responded by bringing on Paciencia, who levelled the scores with 20 minutes to play. After former Union player Steven Skrzybski had forced a corner on the counter-attack, the Portuguese striker found the net with a glancing header at the near post. The draw lifts Schalke off bottom spot and gives Baum's side a timely boost ahead of next week's derby at Borussia Dortmund. Yet the seven-time German champions are still without a win in 20 league games, in a miserable run which stretches back to January. Elsewhere, Eintracht Frankfurt and Portugal striker Andre Silva continued his electric early season form with a third goal in four Bundesliga games as his side drew 1-1 away to Cologne. Frankfurt missed the chance to draw level on points with league leaders RB Leipzig after Silva's first-half penalty was cancelled out by Ondrej Duda's equaliser. The visitors dominated a scrappy first half, and were rewarded just before the break when Sebastiaan Bornauw brought down Japan international Daichi Kamada in the box. Silva stepped up, and slotted the ball past Timo Horn to give his side a deserved lead. The Portuguese, who completed a permanent move from AC Milan last month, now has four goals from five games in all competitions. Duda levelled the scores shortly after half-time, blasting in a sharp cross from Kingsley Ehizibue to secure Cologne their first point of the season. Frankfurt now sit in fourth after four games, with only Leipzig, Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund having enjoyed a better start to the season."
11,26/09/2020,20:26,Union close to signing Karius from Liverpool on loan - reports,German goalkeeper Loris Karius is poised to return to the Bundesliga with Union Berlin amid reports Saturday that Liverpool have agreed to a one-year loan deal.,"Broadcaster Sky, magazine Kicker and daily newspaper Bild claim the 27-year-old is set to undergo a medical in Berlin early next week. ""He could be a possible newcomer,"" Union's managing director Oliver Ruhnert told Sky after Saturday's 1-1 draw with Borussia Mönchengladbach, not wanting to confirm the deal. Karius joined Liverpool from Mainz in 2016, but his name is synonymous with the 2018 Champions League final as his mistakes against Real Madrid contributed to a 3-1 defeat in Istanbul. Karius has spent the last two seasons on loan at Besiktas, but has little hope in forcing his way into the Liverpool team past first-choice goalkeeper Adrian."
12,19/09/2020,21:15,Haaland and Reyna shine as Dortmund youngsters down Gladbach,Erling Braut Haaland scored twice and 17-year-old Giovanni Reyna shone as youthful Borussia Dortmund swept aside fellow Champions League side Borussia Moenchengladbach 3-0 on Saturday on the opening weekend of the Bundesliga season.,"After holders Bayern Munich had kicked off the 2020/21 campaign on Friday with a record 8-0 thrashing of Schalke, Dortmund's youngsters also dazzled at home to Gladbach. ""It was a really good start to the season. We have a lot of young guys, it's fun to play with guys near my age,"" said USA Under-17 international Reyna. ""This is an exciting group and we have to keep working."" Haaland converted a second-half penalty, then again showcased his clinical eye for goal by finishing a superb counter as Dortmund attacked from their own goal. Coach Lucien Favre banked on youth by starting two 17-year-olds in Reyna and England Under-21 midfielder Jude Bellingham, who made his league debut, with Sancho and Haaland, both 20, leading Dortmund's attack. Reyna, making just his third league start, paid back the faith by scoring the opening goal and winning the penalty Haaland converted. Reyna drilled home Bellingham's superb pass from a tight ankle on 34 minutes, then had his ankle clipped after a darting run into the area to win the penalty for Haaland. Sancho tried to convince Haaland to let him take the spot-kick, but ""I was confident whoever took it, would score, which is the most important thing"" said Reyna. Haaland then stole the show with a stunning end-to-end sprint to support Sancho's break before crashing home Dortmund's third goal on 78 minutes. The towering Norwegian, the first player in Bundesliga history to score a hat-trick from the bench, now has 18 goals in 20 games for Dortmund since his arrival in January. For the first time since March, some German league clubs were able to welcome back limited numbers of fans, depending on permission from local health authorities. The biggest crowd of the day was in Dortmund, as 9,300 cheered the impressive home win. ""It's amazing to have fans back, they support us so much,"" added Reyna. Having finished runners-up to Bayern for the last two seasons, Dortmund are on a collision course with the European champions who they meet in the German Super Cup showdown on September 30 in Munich. Earlier, Hertha Berlin's new-signing Jhon Cordoba scored on his debut in a 4-1 away romp at Werder Bremen as the ambitious capital city club also threw down an early marker. In front of 8,500 in Bremen, Hertha defender Peter Pekarik and Belgian-born winger Dodi Lukebakio scored quick-fire goals at the end of the first half to leave Werder 2-0 down at the break and the hosts were whistled off the pitch by their own fans. Colombia striker Cordoba, signed from Cologne in mid-week, came on to start the move which Brazil Under-23 forward Matheus Cunha finished as Hertha went 3-0 up with an hour gone. Davie Selke scored Bremen's second-half consolation goal before Cordoba capped his debut by tucking home Hertha's fourth goal on 90 minutes. Just like Bayern, Cologne also had to play behind closed doors due to a rising rate of infection for their 3-2 home defeat to Hoffenheim, for whom Andrej Kramaric scored a hat-trick. The Croatia striker put the visitors ahead after three minutes following a mix up in defence, netted a penalty and smashed home the winning goal in added time after Cologne had launched a late fight back. In the capital, playmaker Michael Gregoritsch and winger Andre Hahn scored late goals as Augsburg beat hosts Union Berlin 3-1 in front of 4,600 fans. Newly-promoted Arminia Bielefeld earned a point with a 1-1 draw at Eintracht Frankfurt on their return to the top flight in front of 6,500. Stuttgart, who also came up, gave Freiburg a scare with late goals by Sasa Kalajdzic and Silas Wamangituka as they fought back in a 3-2 defeat in front of 8,000."
13,27/06/2020,18:01,"Bremen snatch play-off survival chance, champions Bayern rout Wolfsburg","Werder Bremen gave themselves hope of avoiding relegation from the German Bundesliga by thrashing Cologne 6-1 to grab a play-off place on the last day of the season, while champions Bayern Munich routed Wolfsburg before lifting the trophy on Saturday.","Japan striker Yuya Osako scored twice as Bremen stole the lifeline of the relegation/promotion play-off place from Fortuna Duesseldorf, who lost 3-0 at Union Berlin and were relegated with Paderborn, finishing one point behind Bremen. Florian Kohfeldt's Werder will face second-tier opponents in either Heidenheim or possibly neighbours, rivals and fellow fallen giants Hamburg in the play-off first leg on Thursday. Bremen have spent more seasons than any other team in the Bundesliga, having only spent one term in the second tier, in 1980-81. A burst of goals from Osako, Milot Rashica and Niclas Fuellkrug -- all in the space of eight minutes -- had Werder 3-0 up at the break against Cologne at the Weserstadion. Former Everton midfielder Davy Klaassen then fired home a rebound just after the break before Osako, facing his old side, added his second and USA international Josh Sargent completed the rout. Dominick Drexler pulled a goal back for Cologne. Werder, the four-time Bundesliga champions, also needed a favour from Berlin and got one as Union beat Fortuna 3-0 with goals from Nigerian duo Anthony Ujah and Suleiman Abdullahi either side of veteran midfielder Christian Gentner's effort. Bremen will find out their play-off opponents on Sunday, with Heidenheim currently in the play-off place ahead of the final round of matches in the second division. At Wolfsburg, Bayern striker Robert Lewandowski scored a penalty for his 34th league goal of the season, finishing as the top scorer for the fifth time. Kingsley Coman, Michael Cuisance and Thomas Mueller also got on the scoresheet as Bayern, champions for the eighth straight season, finished 13 points clear of second-placed Borussia Dortmund. Mueller set up Coman for Bayern's opening goal to finish the campaign with a league record 21 assists, and his goal that rounded out the win was also Bayern's 100th league goal this season -- one short of the Bundesliga record. Wolfsburg captain Josuha Guilavogui was sent off for a second yellow card after fouling Cuisance, leading to Lewandowski's penalty. Meanwhile, Borussia Moenchengladbach and RB Leipzig secured qualification for next season's Champions League after 2-1 wins over Hertha Berlin and Augsburg respectively, as fifth-placed Bayer Leverkusen missed out by two points despite beating Mainz 1-0. Dortmund, who had already wrapped up second place, crashed to a 4-0 home defeat by Hoffenheim, for whom Croatia striker Andrej Kramaric scored all four goals, including one penalty. That result allowed Hoffenheim to leapfrog Wolfsburg and take sixth place, although both sides will go into the Europa League next season along with Leverkusen. Before kick-off in Dortmund, Mario Goetze, whose winning goal sealed Germany's victory in the 2014 World Cup final, was given a send-off by the club. He will leave this summer with his contract having expired, but the 28-year-old attacking midfielder has not announced his future club. Elsewhere, Timo Werner signed off with a brace in RB Leipzig's 2-1 win at Augsburg in what was his final appearance for the club before moving to Chelsea. Schalke's disastrous second half of the season was completed with a 4-0 thrashing at the hands of Freiburg as they finished the season 12th, having been third in December. Eintracht Frankfurt beat bottom side Paderborn 3-2 in Saturday's other game."
14,20/06/2020,16:12,Union Berlin fined for car park party with fans,The German Football League (DFL) has fined Union Berlin and two players over an impromtu party with fans in the club's stadium car park after their Bundesliga survival was confirmed in mid-week.,"Late Friday, the DFL slapped fines on Union, club captain Christopher Trimmel and midfielder Sheraldo Becker after a group of players held a makeshift party with fans in the stadium car park following Tuesday's 1-0 home win over Paderborn. A year after their promotion, the home victory, played behind closed doors due to the coronavirus pandemic, confirmed that Union will play a second season in Germany's top flight. However, the DFL took a dim view of images of the players' party, which ""had obviously violated general hygiene and infection protection standards"", said the league a statement. ""This can be seen in video recordings that have been published on social networks, among others."" Several players, staff and Union coach Urs Fischer were involved, but the DFL singled out Trimmel and Becker, because of footage of them celebrating arm-in-arm with fans. Both players were put into isolation until they returned two negative tests for COVID-19. Trimmel captained Union at Hoffenheim in the league on Saturday with Becker left out of the match squad."
15,07/06/2020,20:20,"Werder slip towards drop, Union eye safety as teams take knee for Floyd","Werder Bremen were staring at relegation from the Bundesliga on Sunday after a 1-0 home defeat to Wolfsburg, while Union Berlin edged towards safety on a day that featured a renewed show of solidarity with the global protests sparked by the death of George Floyd.","Wout Weghorst headed home the decisive goal for Wolfsburg eight minutes before the end to push his team back up to sixth and into the Europa League spots. The Dutch international's 12th league goal of the season came just seconds after Xaver Schlager crashed a shot off the bar and leaves Werder, the team with the most seasons in the Bundesliga, facing the drop for the first time since 1980. ""It is very disappointing, but everything is still possible. We will give everything until the end,"" said Werder captain Niklas Moisander to DAZN. With four matches left, Florian Kohfeldt's side are second-from-bottom, six points from safety and three from the relegation playoff place following back-to-back home defeats. Werder are the league's lowest scorers with 30 goals and have won just once at home all season, losing 11 times. They travel to bottom side Paderborn next weekend in a match that could be decisive for their survival, with league leaders Bayern Munich the following weekend and relegation rivals Mainz, who are just outside the drop zone and won 2-0 at Eintracht Frankfurt on Saturday, three days later. The match began after both starting elevens gathered round the centre circle at the Weser Stadium before dropping to one knee, echoing a gesture made by Borussia Dortmund and Hertha Berlin players and Mainz midfielder Pierre Kunde Malong on Saturday. Union Berlin and Schalke players then did the same before their 1-1 draw in the German capital. Favourites to go down in their first ever Bundesliga season, Union are 14th on 32 points, seven ahead of Werder who occupy the final automatic relegation place, and four away from the playoff spot. However their Nigerian striker Anthony Ujah failed in his attempt to score and take the knee himself, as he had promised he would do on Saturday. Ujah did set up Robert Andrich's neat 11th-minute opener. Union are level on points with Augsburg, who snatched a late draw at home to Cologne thanks to Philipp Max's 88th-minute equaliser, which came just three minutes after Anthony Modeste had fired the away side into the lead. Cologne are 12th on 35 points after a draw which also saw Florian Niederlechner miss a first-half penalty for Augsburg. Schalke, who grabbed a point at Union thanks to a fierce Jonjoe Kenny strike in the 28th minute, have failed to win in 12 league games but are 10th and are seven points from the European places. ""It's a tough situation we're in but it's a good step to come away and get a point at a difficult place to come,"" said English goalscorer Kenny. With protests against police brutality and for racial equality taking place around the world on Sunday, the Bundesliga has become a stage for tributes to Floyd, a black American man who died last month at the hands of police in Minneapolis. On Saturday, Dortmund players also wore messages on their T-shirts during their warm-up in honour of Floyd. Jadon Sancho and Achraf Hakimi wore the messages ""no justice, no peace"", while midfielders Axel Witsel and Emre Can's T-shirts displayed the words ""black"", ""white"", ""yellow"" and ""red"" crossed out, with the word ""human"" below. Prior to their 4-2 win at Bayer Leverkusen on Saturday, Bayern Munich players warmed up in T-shirts bearing both the Black Lives Matter hashtag and the slogan of the club's official ""Reds Against Racism"" campaign."
16,06/06/2020,15:16,Nigeria's Ujah 'proud' of Bundesliga anti-racism protests,"Union Berlin's Nigerian striker Anthony Ujah said he is ""proud"" of Jadon Sancho and other Bundesliga players who staged on-pitch protests following the death of black American George Floyd, and pledged to do the same if he scores against Schalke this Sunday.","""I am proud of the players who are taking a stand. I am proud of Jadon Sancho. I am proud of Weston McKennie. I am proud of Marcus Thuram. I am proud of Achraf Hakimi. The whole world saw their message,"" wrote Ujah in an article for German daily FAZ. After scoring in Dortmund's win at Paderborn on Sunday, England winger Sancho lifted his shirt to reveal the message ""Justice for George Floyd"". He was booked, but for lifting his shirt over his head rather than for the message. His Dortmund team-mate Hakimi unveiled a similar t-shirt, while Schalke's McKennie wrote the same message on his captain's armband during a defeat to Werder Bremen. Gladbach striker Thuram, meanwhile, dropped to one knee after scoring against Union. The German Football Association (DFB) later decided not to sanction the four players for what they said were ""symbols of solidarity"". ""This line will also be taken should further players make demonstrations on racism and the death of Floyd over the course of upcoming matchdays,"" the DFB added. Ujah, who staged a similar protest while playing for Cologne six years ago following the death of another black American man Eric Garner, said he would not hesitate to do so again. ""Six years later, we are again talking about exactly the same thing. A black person is no longer able to breathe and loses his life under police violence. That is a disgrace. Every year we hope that it will improve, but exactly the same things happen again,"" said the Nigerian."
17,31/05/2020,23:09,Protests and fireworks: Three things from German football,"Marcus Thuram, Jadon Sancho and Weston McKennie joined the protests against racism and police brutality in the US while Bayern Munich and head coach Hansi Flick sent records tumbling as his team stayed seven points clear.","AFP Sport looks at three talking points from the weekend in the German Bundesliga: -- Borussia Dortmund's England winger Jadon Sancho, Moenchengladbach's French striker Marcus Thuram and Schalke's American midfielder Weston McKennie all took part in on-field protests after the death of George Floyd during an arrest in Minneapolis. Sancho scored a hat-trick in a 6-1 win over Paderborn and revealed a ""Justice for George Floyd"" T-shirt Sunday. The 20-year-old Sancho was booked after removing his jersey in the second half to reveal his message. Sancho later wrote on Instagram: ""Delighted to get my first career hat trick, a bittersweet moment personally as there are more important things going on in the world today that we must address and help make a change."" Thuram took a knee after heading in his team's second goal just before half-time in a 4-1 win over Union Berlin. ""When people say that they don't want to see political messages in sport, I have to say quite honestly, if this was an action to show that you are against racism, what can I say against it?"" said Moenchengladbach coach Marco Rose. ""That is where I stand behind my player. I think if you stand up against racism in public, it's really okay."" US midfielder McKennie wore an armband against Werder Bremen bearing the words ""Justice for George"". ""To be able to use my platform to bring attention to a problem that has been going on too long feels good!!!"" he tweeted. -- Having defeated second-placed Borussia Dortmund 1-0 away in midweek, Bayern enjoyed a 5-0 romp over Fortuna Duesseldorf to stay firmly on track for an eighth straight league crown. Head coach Hansi Flick claimed his 22nd win in his first 25 games, the best record of any Bayern coach, bettering even the start Pep Guardiola made when he took charge in 2013. ""Statistics and records don't interest me, what's important is to have a successful season,"" said Flick. -- Dynamo Dresden remain rock bottom of Bundesliga 2 after a 2-0 defeat to fallen giants Stuttgart. Dresden had to delay their return from the coronavirus suspension earlier this month after two members of staff tested positive. That put the entire squad into a 14-day quarantine. Before their game at the weekend, fans staged a spectacular firework display with an accompanying banner which read: ""Together against the rest of the world."" Sadly, such enthusiasm was absent on the pitch as the team's 84 days without football showed. ""We come from the balcony. We trained for two weeks in the living room and on the balcony,"" said despondent coach Markus Kauczinski."
18,31/05/2020,18:16,Thuram makes protest by taking a knee in Bundesliga,Borussia Moenchengladbach routed Union Berlin 4-1 on Sunday behind closed doors with French striker Marcus Thuram scoring twice and taking a knee in protest at the death of an unarmed black man in the United States.,"First-half goals by midfielder Florian Neuhaus, who bagged Gladbach's 3,000th goal in the Bundesliga, and Thuram put Gladbach 2-0 up at the break. Union's Swedish striker Sebastian Andersson pulled one back early in the second-half after being left unmarked. However, Gladbach pulled away when Thuram added his second after pressing the Union defence. The 22-year-old French striker then took a knee on the Borussia Park turf, imitating NFL star Colin Kaepernick. It was the latest show of Bundesliga solidarity with the current protests sweeping the United States. Schalke's US midfielder Weston McKennie wore an armband in Saturday's defeat to Werder Bremen bearing the words ""Justice for George"". George Floyd, 46, died in Minneapolis in an arrest by a police officer who pinned him to the ground for several minutes by kneeling on his neck. On Sunday, Alassane Plea grabbed a goal of his own for Gladbach, having set up Thuram's first, when he fired home off his left foot on 81 minutes to beat Union goalkeeper Rafal Gikiewicz. After a 3-1 defeat to Leverkusen last weekend, and a goalless draw with relegation-threatened Werder Bremen on Tuesday, this was an important win for Gladbach. It lifted them to third in the table, but RB Leipzig can take their place if they win at Cologne on Monday. On Saturday, reigning champions Bayern Munich opened a 10-point lead with a 5-0 thrashing of Fortuna Duesseldorf with the league's top-scorer Robert Lewandowski netting twice. Later Sunday, second-placed Borussia Dortmund can trim Bayern's lead if they win at bottom side Paderborn."

""It would have been fantastic if we could have played a game like that in front of 75,000 spectators. But I hope that the fans at least had fun in front of their TVs,"" said Hertha coach Bruno Labbadia. ""In the first half we played very well against well-organised opponents. I had to make that clear to my team at half-time because they were feeling a bit negative. ""By the end we were happy because these were important points in the relegation battle."" Labbadia started Czech Republic midfielder Vladimir Darida in the only change from last Saturday's win at Hoffenheim in his first home match in charge. Union's Urs Fischer, who guided the east Berlin outfit to the top-flight for the first time this season, brought in four fresh faces to his starting lineup after Sunday's loss to champions Bayern Munich. A minute silence was held before kick-off at the eerily quiet ground in the German capital in remembrance of all victims of COVID-19. The best chance of the opening 20 minutes, which were dominated by Labbadia's men, fell to winger Lukebakio but the DR Congo international's effort was saved by Rafal Gikiewicz. Labbadia's side continued their dominance into the second half. Lukebakio was stopped two minutes into second half again by Gikiewicz before captain Ibisevic headed home a powerful opener. Just 70 seconds later Hertha doubled their lead as Bosnia-Herzegovina forward Ibisevic fed Lukebakio who got the better of Gikiewicz with a side-footed effort. Both goals were greeted by the Hertha club anthem echoing around the ground built for the 1936 Olympics as it was played on the public address system. Labbadia celebrated by elbow bumping with his coaching staff as did his players on the field. Hertha added a third on the hour mark as Brazilian playmaker Matheus Cunha scored his fourth goal of the season. Lukebakio missed with an ambitious overhead kick inside the box and Cunha, who joined from RB Leipzig in January, side-footed home from outside the area after 62 minutes. Centre-back Boyata, who apologised for breaching virus-related league protocol after grabbing the face of team-mate Marko Grujic during last weekend's win, claimed a fourth with 13 minutes to play. The Belgium defender celebrated by kissing his elbows and chest-bumping team-mates including Jordan Torunarigha as they clinched revenge after November's derby defeat, the first time the sides had met in the German top-flight. ""We laid it on a plate for Hertha. But we've lost one game, nothing more, nothing less,"" said Union coach Fischer. On Saturday, second-placed Borussia Dortmund can close the gap to a point on leaders Bayern Munich with a win over Wolfsburg. Bayern host Eintracht Frankfurt in 13th spot later in the day. Elsewhere, Borussia Moenchengladbach will place 13,000 cut-out images of fans in their stadium for the visit of Bayer Leverkusen."

22,17/05/2020,21:04,Five things from the Bundesliga comeback,Bayern Munich maintained their four-point lead at the top of the Bundesliga as Germany gave fans across the world their first taste of elite football for two months amid empty stands and stringent hygiene guidelines designed to curtail the spread of the coronavirus.,"AFP looks at the five things we learned from one of oddest weekends in the game's history. The Bundesliga has a head start of at least a month on the other major leagues aiming to restart this summer, and some of strange scenes seen in Germany will become the new normal should football return to England, Italy and Spain. La Liga and Serie A are aiming for mid-June as a potential start date for their suspended seasons, and fans in both countries may have to get used to silent, empty stadiums, socially-distanced goal celebrations, footballers in face masks and the spectre of players catching COVID-19. Italy's clubs for example are debating a medical protocol that currently rules that if a player tests positive for the virus he and anyone who has come into close contact with him must be quarantined for two weeks, in contrast to Germany where only the player is isolated. How Bundesliga teams fare under their hygiene regulations could provide the model for the coming months. Heading into his team's tough trip to giant-killers Union Berlin, Bayern Munich coach Hansi Flick wondered whether his team would be able to last a full 90 minutes after only being given the go-ahead to resume full team training last week. However a dominant display in the German capital, against a team that had already beaten two different league leaders at home this season, showed why they are the strongly-tipped to win their eighth straight league title. Bayern had two thirds of possession at the Alten Foesterei stadium, and once Robert Lewandowski slotted home his 26th league goal of the season from the penalty spot five minutes before the break, the result was never in doubt as the champions went on to claim a 2-0 win. In the aftermath of Dortmund's 4-0 thumping of Ruhr rivals Schalke, teen striking sensation Erling Braut Haaland was a young man of few words with the awaiting media desperate for something from the 19-year-old goal machine. However, according to AFP subsidiary SID, Haaland mumbled a total of eight English words to reporters, including ""Why not?"" and ""Yes"". It didn't really matter, as Haaland had done his talking on the pitch, picking up where he left off before the world went into virus lockdown. The Norwegian, who turns 20 this summer, swept home the opener, the league's first goal of its restart, before laying on the first of Raphael Guerreiro's brace, showing once again that he is Europe's player to watch. He has 41 goals this season in all competitions and 13 for Dortmund in just 12 games since joining in January from Red Bull Salzburg. Specialist website DWDL.de reported on Sunday that over six million people in Germany watched the first top-tier matches in two months, with 3.68 million tuning into broadcaster Sky Germany's subscription channels on Saturday. A further 2.45 million tuned into the 'Konferenz' -- a simultaneous live broadcast of the five afternoon games -- on free-to-air Sports News Channel. Sky Germany had a market share of 27.4 percent on their pay-to-view channels and 18.2 percent on their free channel. The German Football League (DFL) told AFP that matches were televised by more than 70 broadcasters worldwide, all on previously-agreed deals. British newspaper the Daily Mail reports that UK viewers were left frustrated as the BT Sport application showing the matches buckled under the weight of demand from fans. Germany has one of the world's most vibrant football fan cultures, with raucous fans packing stadiums where entrance fees are priced at a fraction of what Premier League fans have to shell out. And while millions tuned in to watch some live football, a significant portion of match-going supporters are livid at the idea of games going ahead without the noisy backdrop provided by German fans. On Saturday Augsburg fans left a banner inside their team's ground which read ""Football gives life -- your business is sick"". St Pauli, meanwhile, on Sunday published a picture on Twitter of a banner that read: ""Football lives through its fans! Without you, it's all nothing!"""
23,17/05/2020,20:34,Leaders Bayern brush Union aside on Bundesliga return,Robert Lewandowski bagged his 26th league goal this season as leaders Bayern Munich restarted the Bundesliga season with a 2-0 win at Union Berlin behind closed doors on Sunday.,"Lewandowski netted a first-half penalty and defender Benjamin Pavard scored a late header for Bayern in Berlin after the Bundesliga became the first top European league on Saturday to resume during the COVID-19 pandemic. Poland star Lewandowski, who missed two games with injury before the league was interrupted in mid-March, reached 40 goals for the campaign in all competitions as Bayern restored their four-point lead over Borussia Dortmund. Dortmund, who thrashed Schalke 4-0 in the Ruhr derby on Saturday, host Bayern in a pivotal fixture in 10 days' time, another game that will be behind closed doors due to the league's strict hygiene guidelines. Union had shocked previous leaders Dortmund and Borussia Moenchengladbach earlier in the season, backed by passionate home support at their Alten Foersterei stadium. However, with the players' voices echoing around the Union stadium, Bayern dominated their mid-table opponents. Thomas Mueller looked to have given Bayern an early lead on 18 minutes when Serge Gnabry presented him with a simple tap-in. However, the goal was disallowed when the video assistant referee (VAR) spotted Mueller was offside. With Bayern enjoying around 70 percent possession, it was just a matter of time before they took the lead. Sure enough when Union defender Neven Subotic fouled Leon Goretzka in the area on 38 minutes, Lewandowski stepped up to slot home the resulting penalty. After the break, dogged defending by the hosts repeatedly frustrated Bayern. To help grab a second goal to seal the result, Bayern coach Hansi Flick brought on French winger Kingsley Coman for his 100th Bundesliga appearance. It was his countryman Pavard who made the points safe on 80 minutes when he headed a Joshua Kimmich corner inside the far post. Union's best chance came in the dying stages when Felix Kroos, brother of Germany star Toni, fired straight at Bayern goalkeeper Manuel Neuer. Earlier, Cologne striker Mark Uth said that the absence of fans was no excuse for throwing away a two-goal lead in a 2-2 draw with struggling Mainz. ""If you're up 2-0, you have to finish things off -- with or without spectators,"" fumed goalscorer Uth. The hosts took an early lead when Uth, on loan from Schalke, converted a penalty with just six minutes gone after the striker was brought down in the area. With hugs and handshakes banned, and fans excluded from the ground due to the pandemic, the players celebrated with elbow bumps instead. Cologne added a second goal when Florian Kainz headed home a cross with just over half an hour left. However, Mainz came roaring back with an hour played as the visitors knuckled down. Replacement striker Taiwo Awoniyi, who had only been on for five minutes, tapped home from close range for his first Bundesliga goal. Cameroon midfielder Pierre Kunde floored Cologne and earned a point for Mainz when he beat two defenders and poked the ball past goalkeeper Timo Horn to equalise on 72 minutes. ""It was like street football, a huge game for us,"" said Mainz sports director Rouven Schroeder. ""For the first game after so many weeks, it was really good. The guys didn't want to be left behind."" The result leaves Mainz on the verge of the relegation places but four points above the bottom three while Cologne are 10th."
24,17/05/2020,16:26,Bayern aim to shake off cobwebs with quiet confidence in Berlin,Bayern Munich restart their charge for an eighth straight Bundesliga title at Union Berlin on Sunday amid doubts the Bavarian giants will be able to last the distance after a two-month hiatus.,"Hansi Flick's side hold a slender one-point lead at the top of the league heading into their trip to the German capital, which has been the scene of some impressive upsets thanks to promoted Union's form at their Alten Foersterei stadium. Union have twice shocked the league leaders this season, beating Borussia Dortmund 3-1 in August and turning out 2-0 victors over Borussia Moenchengladbach three months later. Now it's Bayern's turn. Bayern flew up to Berlin by private jet from a military airport in Ingolstadt, near Munich, with the two team buses allowed to drive directly onto the tarmac. The players and Flick's backroom staff tested negative for the coronavirus -- for the fifth time -- and the squad all wore face masks for the brief flight. Flick is unsure of his team's ability to play out a full match after having only received the go-ahead to resume team training last week. ""We don't know if the team can hold out over 90 minutes,"" said Flick. ""We have to just deal with the situation."" The Bundesliga is the first major league in Europe to return to action since the coronavirus brought football to a halt two months. The restart was only possible thanks to a host of strict health regulations, such as near-empty stands in what are usually passion-filled stadiums and regular testing for the virus. That means Union won't be able to count on their ferocious home support at their ground in east Berlin on the outskirts of the German capital. They will also be without their coach Urs Fischer after breaking the team quarantine following the death of his father-in-law. ""It's not possible to surprise Bayern with the experience their players have,"" said Union assistant coach Markus Hoffmann, who is in charge against Bayern. ""They've already experienced everything. ""We have to concentrate on ourselves and try to implement what we can to influence the game in the best possible way."" Bayern's lead was cut to a single point by Borussia Dortmund, who on Saturday showed no ring rustiness in a 4-0 demolition of Ruhr rivals Schalke. Norwegian sensation Erling Braut Haaland, 19, scored the first Bundesliga goal after the restart and set up Raphael Guerreiro for the first of his brace. As well as the echoing arenas, a host of other rules have been put in place to try to stop the spread of the virus, from frequent testing to masks for players on the subs bench and a week-long quarantine for teams ahead of the restart. However, advice to socially distance didn't stop Hertha Berlin players from celebrating their goals in a 3-0 win at Hoffenheim by hugging each other. ""The fact is that this is part of football,"" said Hertha coach Bruno Labbadia. ""We've been tested so many times that we can allow it. ""If you can't celebrate anymore, the whole thing breaks down."" A German Football League (DFL) spokesman confirmed there will be no punishment, as it had only offered ""guidelines"" on how goals should be celebrated. However senior politician Markus Soeder, the state minister for Bavaria, said Sunday that he expects Bundesliga bosses to ""tighten up"" the hygiene guidelines after Hertha's hugs in Hoffenheim. The DFL has also made no secret of the fact that several clubs are in a dire financial situation as a result of the lockdown. If they are able to complete the nine remaining rounds of matches by June 30, clubs could receive around 300 million euros ($324 million) from television contracts. Clubs in England, Spain and Italy, where leagues are weeks away from returning, will be watching to see how the rest of weekend goes. td-ryj/td <org>BORUSSIA DORTMUND</org>"
25,17/05/2020,15:10,Germany kicks off as Europe eases curbs but virus marches on,"German football champions Bayern Munich were set to play their first match in more than two months on Sunday as coronavirus restrictions ease in parts of Europe, but the devastating pandemic remains on the march elsewhere with deaths soaring in Brazil.","With the worldwide death toll topping 311,000 and the global economy reeling from the vast damage caused by lockdowns, the reopenings in some of the hardest-hit countries such as Italy provided much-needed relief. But the number of COVID-19 fatalities soared past 15,000 in Brazil with 230,000 infections, making it the country with the fourth-highest number of cases, a grim reminder of the scale of the crisis. And in the United States -- the worst-hit country -- former President Barack Obama launched a scathing attack on the way the crisis has been handled, saying a lot of American leaders ""aren't even pretending to be in charge"". In Germany, where authorities have started a gradual easing of restrictions, reigning Bundesliga champions Bayern Munich were set to play Union Berlin in the capital Sunday night, a day after the league resumed play in empty, echoing stadiums. Already attracting a record TV audience, the Bundesliga restart is under intense scrutiny as a test case, with top sports competitions trying to find ways to resume play without increasing the risk of spreading the virus, which has infected 4.6 million people globally. The first big-purse golf tournament in months also wrapped up Sunday, with the normally overlooked Korean LPGA Championship winning new interest to women's golf. ""The moment I had always dreamt of finally has come true,"" said the tearful 20-year-old winner Park Hyun-kyung, who was congratulated by her mask-wearing peers with elbow-bumps. One question that has arisen during the pandemic is whether masks are an effective weapon against the virus, with little research on the subject leading several countries to backflip on their official advice. A team of leading experts in Hong Kong said Sunday that research conducted on hamsters found that non-contact transmission of the virus could be reduced by more than 60 percent when masks are used. There have been positive signs in a slowly reopening Europe, with Spain reporting its number of new deaths dropped to 87 on Sunday -- the first time the number has fallen below 100 in two months. But despite the optimism in some European countries, the rising infection and fatality numbers in other parts of the world offered reminders of the threat posed by the deadly disease. The number of infections in Latin America passed half a million on Sunday, as Chile locked down its capital Santiago following a sharp rise in cases. Despite the surging numbers in Brazil, far-right President Jair Bolsonaro is keen to end lockdowns, which he claims have unnecessarily damaged the economy. ""Unemployment, hunger and misery will be the future of those who support the tyranny of total isolation,"" Bolsonaro tweeted. In Russia, which has the world's second highest number of infections, the top health official claimed Sunday the country had ""halted the growth"" of the virus, just a day after reporting its deadliest day. There were happier scenes in Europe, with excited swimmers diving into the waters off newly reopened beaches in France, Greece and Italy, while Britons enjoyed the sun in parks after lockdown measures eased. Italy, for a long stretch the world's worst-hit country, announced that European Union tourists would be allowed to visit from June 3, and a 14-day mandatory quarantine would be scrapped. ""We're facing a calculated risk in the knowledge that the contagion curve may rise again,"" Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said. With the threat of a second wave of infections and with no vaccine available, authorities in many countries have asked people not to throng public spaces as they are made accessible again. And a stark warning came on Sunday from one of the top medical experts in China, where the disease first emerged late last year but has largely been brought under control after more than 4,600 deaths. ""The majority of... Chinese at the moment are still susceptible... because (of) a lack of immunity,"" Zhong Nanshan, the Chinese government's senior medical advisor, told CNN. ""We are facing (a) big challenge, it's not better than the foreign countries I think at the moment."" But with people growing weary of confinement and suffering immense economic pain, pressure is growing on governments to ease lockdowns despite the threat of a second wave. With more than 88,000 deaths and 1.47 million confirmed coronavirus cases, the US is the worst-hit country on the planet, and President Donald Trump is keen to restart the world's biggest economy despite experts warning against moving too quickly. Former president Barack Obama on Saturday took a swipe at the response to the pandemic, telling graduates at a virtual college commencement ceremony that many leaders today ""aren't even pretending to be in charge"" -- a remark widely regarded as a rare rebuke of his successor. ""Doing what feels good, what's convenient, what's easy -- that's how little kids think,"" he later told high school students Someone whose handling of the pandemic has been more praised is New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern -- however even she is not exempt from coronavirus measures. She was denied entry to a cafe over the weekend as it had reached its customer limit. ""I have to take responsibility for this, I didn't get organised and book anywhere,"" her fiancee Clarke Gayford tweeted. burs-dl/bp <org>BORUSSIA DORTMUND</org> <org></org>"
26,15/05/2020,19:21,Union coach Fischer to miss Bayern clash after quarantine breach,Bundesliga giant-killers Union Berlin will be without head coach Urs Fischer for Sunday's home clash against Bayern Munich after he broke the team quarantine following a family bereavement.,"The Bundesliga becomes the first top European league to resume this weekend behind closed doors despite the coronavirus pandemic. The guidelines for the German top flight's restart include a week-long quarantine for every club, which Fischer broke on Monday to join his family after the death of his father-in-law. The Swiss plans to return to Berlin on Saturday, but will not rejoin the team, because he broke the German Football League (DFL) guidelines, the club said Friday. ""All our sympathy goes to the Fischer family in this difficult time,"" said Union president Dirk Zingler. In the build-up to Sunday's game, Fischer's assistant coach Markus Hoffmann will take charge of Union and be on the bench for the match. According to DFL guidelines, Fischer will only return to the team after two negative tests for the coronavirus. Mid-table Union, in their first ever season in the top division, are a force to be reckoned with at home having beaten previous league leaders Dortmund and Moenchengladbach this season. However, the terraces of their east Berlin stadium will be empty Sunday with Bayern looking to build on their four-point lead in their bid to win an eighth straight league title. Also set to miss the return of the Bundesliga is Augsburg coach Heiko Herrlich, whose trip from his team's hotel to buy toothpaste cost him his place on the bench for the home fixture with Wolfsburg on Saturday. ""I made a mistake by leaving the hotel,"" admitted Herrlich who said he went to a supermarket to buy toothpaste and skin cream. ""In this situation, I didn't live up to my position as a role model for my team and the public."" The former Germany international took over Augsburg from Martin Schmidt earlier his year, penning a deal until 2022. His team are 14th in the Bundesliga, five points clear of the relegation play-off spot."
27,13/05/2020,03:22,"The Bundesliga is back, so can Dortmund catch Bayern?","Bayern Munich are in pole position to win an eighth straight title, but Borussia Dortmund lead the chasing pack and are spearheaded by Erling Braut Haaland as the Bundesliga comes out of its coronavirus-enforced hibernation this weekend.","AFP Sport takes a look at what is at stake on the field when the German top flight ends a two-month shutdown to play out its final nine matchdays. Teams have undergone testing and been forced into quarantine training camps because of the virus, and all matches will be played behind closed doors in the league with the highest attendances in world football. So this will not be the Bundesliga as we know it, but something else may be just as before -- Bayern, the country's most successful club, are on track to win another title, which would be their eighth in a row. They had put a patchy start to the season under Niko Kovac behind them before the shutdown, with Hansi Flick coming in as coach and Bayern winning 10 and drawing one of their last 11 league games. The Bavarians are four points clear of Dortmund at the top and have been busy since their last game, with Flick signing a new contract until 2023. Key players Thomas Mueller and Alphonso Davies followed suit by penning extensions of their own, while former striker Miroslav Klose has joined as assistant coach. With Robert Lewandowski scoring 25 goals in 23 games, Bayern are formidable. They still have to visit Dortmund and Bayer Leverkusen, although it remains to be seen how much home advantage will matter without fans. It could still just about be a four-horse title race, with Borussia Moenchengladbach six points off the pace in fourth, but Dortmund are best-placed to stop Bayern. Lucien Favre's side were last seen going out of the Champions League to Paris Saint-Germain, but before that were in thrilling form led by young stars Haaland and Jadon Sancho. They won seven out of eight league games after 19-year-old Norwegian powerhouse Haaland arrived from Red Bull Salzburg. He scored nine goals in that run. Dortmund, though, will not be able to rely on their fans who usually pack the 81,000-capacity Signal Iduna Park and their next two home games -- against Ruhr rivals Schalke on Saturday and then Bayern -- will lose much of their edge as a result. ""Having to play behind closed doors is an enormous challenge, especially for a club like BVB, which draws a lot of strength from the passion of its supporters,"" admitted Dortmund chief executive Hans-Joachim Watzke. Dortmund also must still visit Leipzig, who reached the Champions League quarter-finals before the suspension but whose patchy league form after the winter break saw them fall off the pace. In Timo Werner, they have their own fearsome striker. And in Julian Nagelsmann, 32, they have one of Europe's most exciting young coaches, so anything is possible. Gladbach were the last team to beat Bayern in the league but would now settle for holding off fifth-placed Leverkusen to secure Champions League qualification. There are two points between those sides, who are due to meet next weekend. Beneath them, in the fight for one Europa League spot, Schalke, Wolfsburg, Freiburg and Hoffenheim are all within two points. At the bottom Paderborn prop up the division but the plight of Werder Bremen is more striking. The four-time champions are four points adrift of Fortuna Dusseldorf in the relegation play-off place and eight points from outright safety. They have a game in hand, but are in danger of following the path of Hamburg and Stuttgart, two giants to have been relegated in recent seasons. ""We all know how precarious our league position is. That's motivation enough,"" said sporting director Frank Baumann when asked about playing home games without fans. Elsewhere, Hertha Berlin seem far enough clear of relegation trouble but it has been a chaotic campaign in the capital. Bruno Labbadia has become the club's fourth coach this season since the shutdown began, with Jurgen Klinsmann's short-lived time in charge ending."

Club management and other employees have agreed to short-time working arrangements, which will also result in salary cuts, said a statement. ""These are exceptional circumstances we have to deal with,"" said club president Dirk Zingler. ""Our club's purpose is football. If it ceases to exist, then it will touch the core of our existence. ""The management, our staff, the squad and backroom staff have worked hard in recent months to ensure success in the Bundesliga. ""Now they are giving up a lot of money to get through this crisis together.""

On Tuesday, Bayern Munich and Dortmund players sais they would accept a cut in wages. So far, the coronavirus has claimed 149 lives in Germany."
30,09/11/2019,21:52,Bayern brush aside off-field woes to thrash Dortmund in 'Klassiker',Managerless Bayern Munich thrashed Borussia Dortmund 4-0 in 'Der Klassiker' on Saturday as Robert Lewandowski continued his phenomenal scoring run with two goals at the Allianz Arena.,"Lewandowski's first-half header and 76th-minute tap-in mean he has scored in all of Bayern's Bundesliga and Champions League games this season for a tally of 23 goals. ""We were very focused, we knew we had to give 100 percent and improve,"" said Lewandowski after the reigning Bundesliga champions bounced back emphatically from last weekend's 5-1 drubbing at Eintracht Frankfurt. Serge Gnabry claimed Bayern's second, while visiting captain Mats Hummels scored a late own goal for his former club as Dortmund suffered another heavy defeat in Munich after a 5-0 rout in April. ""After 10 minutes, we made it clear that we wanted to win,"" said Bayern forward Thomas Mueller. ""The alibis had all been used up."" Bayern moved up to third, level on points with second-placed RB Leipzig and one behind leaders Borussia Moenchengladbach, who host Werder Bremen Sunday. Interim coach Hansi Flick enjoyed his second win in charge since Niko Kovac was sacked last Sunday. ""It's not been easy for the team, we didn't have that many training sessions,"" said Flick. ""They knew they had a duty to improve and they did."" Afterwards, club chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge said Flick will stay in charge for Bayern's next game on November 23 at Fortuna Duesseldorf. However, Bayern are having difficulties finding a new coach, with Arsene Wenger on Saturday contradicting their claims they turned him down as Kovac's successor and slammed the club for a lack of discretion. Ajax coach Erik ten Hag and Paris Saint-Germain boss Thomas Tuchel have already made it clear they will not join Bayern this season. Despite their off-field troubles, Bayern dominated as Lewandowski opened the scoring with a superb header from a Benjamin Pavard cross on 17 minutes. Dortmund winger Jadon Sancho was taken off on 36 minutes after failing to make an impact on proceedings. Gnabry had a goal ruled out for offside as Bayern went in 1-0 up at the break, but the Germany winger struck two minutes into the second half. When Lewandowski stumbled with the goal at his mercy, Gnabry fired home. With an hour gone and his side 2-0 down, Dortmund coach Lucien Favre brought on forwards Marco Reus and Paco Alcacer, who have only just recovered from foot and calf injuries respectively. Alcacer had his head in his hands after failing to connect with an Achraf Hakimi cross with 20 minutes left as Dortmund's best chance went begging. Bayern's third came as Lewandowski finished another counter-attack by the hosts, just before Hummels' own goal. ""That was a huge disappointment, a lot of our players didn't play well. Bayern were better,"" admitted Dortmund coach Lucien Favre. Earlier, Timo Werner netted twice as Leipzig went second with a 4-2 win at Hertha Berlin in the capital, where the Berlin Wall fell on November 9, 1989. To mark the 30th anniversary, a replica of the Wall, which divided Germany's capital from 1961, separated Hertha and Leipzig before being knocked down prior to kick-off. Midfielder Maximilian Mittelstaedt gave Hertha a first-half lead which lasted six minutes before Werner converted a penalty. Marcel Sabitzer added Leipzig's second on the stroke of half-time before three goals came in the final five minutes. Kevin Kampl netted Leipzig's third with a superb left-footed strike before Werner grabbed his second for his 11th league goal in as many games, before Hertha striker Davie Selke scored against his former club. Striker Rouwen Hennings completed his hat-trick five minutes from time as Fortuna Duesseldorf held Schalke to a 3-3 draw. The Royal Blues squandered the lead three times as goals by Daniel Caligiuri, Ozan Kabak and Suat Serdar in Gelsenkirchen were cancelled out by Hennings. Union Berlin are up to 11th after their third straight win as Sebastian Anderson scored twice in a 3-2 victory at Mainz. Augsburg climbed out of the bottom three with a 1-0 win at bottom club Paderborn thanks to a goal by defender Philipp Max."
31,02/11/2019,22:09,"Fireworks halt play, tempers boil over as FC Union win emotional Berlin derby",Fireworks brought play to a halt and tempers threatened to boil over as FC Union defeated city rivals Hertha Berlin 1-0 on Saturday in their first Bundesliga derby since German reunification.,"A 90th-minute penalty, converted by home striker Sebastian Polter, sealed the hosts' third league win this season on an emotional night at Union's sold-out Alten Foersterei stadium. However, the referee had to march both teams off for six minutes at the start of the second-half after fireworks launched from the terraces landed on the pitch. After the final whistle, a group of Union 'Ultras' -- masked hardcore fans -- invaded the pitch seemingly intent on confronting their Hertha rivals, before Union players persuaded them to return to the stands. ""It's a city derby and there was a lot of emotion,"" said match-winner Polter. ""We, as players, wanted to make sure the (image of the) club wasn't harmed and we had a responsibility to prevent our fans from doing anything stupid."" Nevertheless, hosts Union now enjoy bragging rights after an historic night for football in Germany's capital. ""To put it simply, it's the most important game of the season, definitely, more important than the (Bundesliga) championship, I would say,"" Union fan Kenny Schwarz told AFP outside the stadium. Next Saturday will mark 30 years since the Berlin Wall came down. Hertha had originally wanted to host the derby on the anniversary, an idea Union rejected. ""I'm only 22,"" laughed Schwarz. ""I got all the coverage -- that Hertha wanted to play on November 9 -- but that doesn't mean much today."" Just 26 kilometres (16 miles) separates Berlin's top clubs, but the Iron Curtain that divided communist East Germany from capitalist West Germany from 1961 kept the two clubs at a much greater distance until the Wall came down in 1989. This was only the fifth competitive meeting between the clubs, following Union's promotion to the Bundesliga in May, having previously only met in Germany's second tier. Among older fans too, the sporting rivalry replaced any nostalgic thoughts. At 48, Nicole Burckhardt experienced the fall of the Wall as a teenager. ""At my age"", she said, ""I believe that history plays no part, for me it's all about football"". Fellow Union fan Andreas Rudolf, 56, agreed the derby's background pales compared with bragging rights now secured. ""That was a long time ago, but we are two different clubs, one is blue, one is red"" and both clubs wanted ""to be number one today"". ""It's definitely not a friendship, but perhaps there's no hostility either, that has to do with"" the past, but ""we don't like them - the Blues."" Union now leads the mini series with two wins with two draws, to a single Hertha victory, in competitive games. Hertha hosted Union in a friendly at the Olympic Stadium in January 1990 -- just days after the Wall fell -- when both sets of fans united on the terraces to sing about Germany's imminent reunification - a unique moment some fans will never forget. ""It used to be that Hertha and Union were friends, which is important to us,"" said 71-year-old Hertha fan Helmut Klopftleich, a former East German who fled to west Berlin in 1984. ""We lived in East Berlin at the time of the Wall, but ran away to the west, and moved from Union to Hertha. ""Today, we are real Hertha (fans)... and have been since 1984."" cpb-ryj/dj"
32,30/10/2019,04:00,"Hertha, Union fans see post-Wall unity in Berlin derby","Three decades after the fall of the Berlin Wall, the German capital's FC Union and Hertha Berlin will meet for their first Bundesliga derby, with fans wondering if a real rivalry will grow or if the spirit of reunification will prevail.","Union and Hertha's stadiums are 26 kilometres (16 miles) apart, but the Iron Curtain that divided communist East Germany from capitalist West Germany had kept the two clubs at a much bigger distance. Elmar Werner, 65, underlined the extraordinary significance of Saturday's game when Union play host to west Berlin's Hertha. ""It will be a very special game, especially as it comes 30 years after the fall of the wall,"" Werner, who has carried Union membership card number 467 since 1979, told AFP. Saturday's game will be only the fifth competitive match between the two Berlin clubs. Their first meeting was on January 27, 1990, when Hertha hosted a friendly at the Olympic Stadium 79 days after the Berlin Wall fell. A capacity crowd of 52,000 sang on the terraces about Germany's imminent reunification as Hertha won 2-1. It would be 20 years before the clubs met in a competition. They played four times in Bundesliga II after Hertha were relegated in 2010 and again in 2012. Union did not win any of the games as Hertha bounced straight back to the top division both times. This weekend the two sides are playing their first top division derby after Union won promotion for the first time last season. Ahead of Saturday's historic game, Andreas Cramer, 60, was at Union's fan shop buying giant posters which he plans to plaster along the streets to greet fans heading to their homeground stadium Alte Foersterei at the leafy Berlin suburb of Koepenick. Visiting Hertha fans will find the area plastered in Union's red and white colours, while slogans will scream ""Berlin sees red!"". But the provocation against blue-and-white-clad Hertha fans will stop there, long-time Union fans said. ""We have a friendship with Hertha, they're not enemies,"" said Cramer, a Union fan for ""more than 40 years"". ""For us, this is not a derby but a city championship."" While football's top derbies are often marked by deep enmity and ending in violence and chaos, Saturday's meeting of Berlin's crosstown rivals appears set to take on an unusually warm atmosphere. Underlining the friendliness, Werner noted that among anthems sung by fans of both sides before reunification was one declaring that ""we hold together like the wind and sea, the blue-white Hertha and FC Union"". West Berlin-born Hertha fan Manon Duering, 55, also said she ""was delighted when Union came up"" to the top division. ""I grew up with the Wall. I was in my 20s when it came down. Berlin offers so much, but it needs a stronger football culture,"" she said. ""It sounds idealistic, but my wish is Union will grow a little with Hertha, who can also benefit from Union. Football isn't as important here as in other cities."" Union have always been viewed favourably as the east German anti-establishment club, a likeable alternative to Dynamo Berlin, linked to the hated Stasi secret police. Many of the songs Union fans sing are aimed not at West Germany's Hertha, but at Dynamo, who won 10 consecutive league titles from 1979 to 1988 but now languish in Germany's fourth division. Despite the warm words from both sides, police will be on high alert as around 22,000 fans pack into Union's ground, as Duering admits, ""no one knows what will happen"". Cramer also noted that while old-timers like him had a fraternal feeling towards Hertha, ""it is different with the younger generation -- the younger ones can't stand Hertha"". Union fan Daniel Rossbach voiced hopes that the derby will not ""grow vicious"", but it will ""always be a rivalry"". Timo Dobbert, a Hertha fan for 30 years, also hopes the derby can grow into something reflecting Berlin's chequered history. ""It would be great if Berlin were the only city in Europe where both clubs and fan groups support and celebrate each other,"" he said. The Berlin derby ""could become a living symbol of the city's history, divided, then reunified, that you wouldn't find anywhere else."""
33,26/10/2019,18:23,Lewandowski makes history again as Bayern reclaim summit,"Robert Lewandowski made yet more history on Saturday by netting in Bayern Munichs 2-1 home win against Union Berlin, which sent the defending champions back to the top of the Bundesliga table by a point.","The Poland striker showed clinical finishing to tuck away an Alphonso Davies second-half pass at the Allianz Arena to claim his 13th league goal and set a new record for scoring in the first nine Bundesliga games of the season. Lewandoski, on the mark in each of his last 13 games for Bayern, overtook the previous league record set by current Arsenal forward Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang who scored in each of the first eight games of the 2015/16 season for Borussia Dortmund. Lewandowski also scored twice in Bayern's 3-2 midweek win at Olympiakos in the Champions League, leaving the 31-year-old with 19 goals in just 14 appearances in all competitions during what is turning into the best season of his career. Lewandowski is already the top-scoring foreigner in Bundesliga history with 215 league goals for Bayern and former club Dortmund. Bayern quickly took charge at the Allianz Arena as defender Benjamin Pavard gave the hosts the lead before Lewandowski's second just after the break. At the other end, Bayern captain Manuel Neuer saved a Sebastian Anderson penalty on 59 minutes and not to be outdone, Union's Poland goalkeeper Ralf Gikiewicz denied Bayern winger Serge Gnabry from close range. Lewandowski looked to have claimed a second, but his effort six minutes from time was ruled out. Union grabbed a late consolation goal when replacement striker Sebastian Polter netted from the penalty spot having been brought down by Pavard. Munich can lose top spot Sunday to previous leaders Moenchengladbach, who host Eintracht Frankfurt, and Wolfsburg who can leap-frog Niko Kovac's Bayern by beating Augsburg at home. Dortmund moved up to third after a goalless draw at Schalke, who had the better chances in the Ruhr derby. Schalke centre-back Salif Sane headed onto the crossbar with nearly half an hour played and soon after midfielder Suat Serdar hit the post. Schalke's Welsh striker Rabbi Matondo, 19, wasted three clear chances, while at the other end Dortmund playmaker Marco Reus and England winger Jadon Sancho went close for the visitors. Freiburg went second after bouncing back from last weekend's shock defeat at Union to earn a 2-1 win at home to RB Leipzig. After beating Zenit Saint-Petersburg in the Champions League in mid-week, Leipzig came unstuck as Nicolas Hoefler gave Freiburg the lead on the stroke of half-time before striker Nils Petersen came off the bench to add a second on 90 minutes. Lukas Klostermann scored a consolation goal for Leipzig. Bottom side Paderborn earned their first win this season as defender Sebastian Schonlau and midfielder Abdelhamid Sabiri scored in a 2-0 win at home to Fortuna Duesseldorf. Mid-table Hoffenheim earned their third straight success, having beaten Bayern and Schalke, with Benjamin Huebner scoring late in their 3-2 win at Hertha Berlin."

Gladbach dominated their lowly opponents and were three goals up after just 13 minutes and 4-0 ahead by half-time. Bayern, who lost 2-1 at Hoffenheim on Saturday, surrendered top spot. Borussia Dortmund, a further two points back, and Leipzig both drew. Gladbach hit the lead in the second minute, when Denis Zakaria tapped home from close range. Patrick Herrmann quickly scored twice to put the hosts three ahead. Alassane Plea added the fourth in the 39th minute. Augsburg opened the second half more positively. Florian Niederlechner probed and pushed for the Bavarians before having an effort turned onto the post with 15 minutes remaining. Niederlechner scored the away side's only goal five minutes later, but Breel Embolo made it five for Gladbach just five minutes later to seal a comprehensive victory. In Sunday's late games, Wolfsburg have the chance to go second when they host Union Berlin, before Frankfurt close the round against Werder Bremen."
35,31/08/2019,21:06,Union Berlin upset Dortmund,"Union Berlin pulled off perhaps the biggest victory in their turbulent history, defeating Borussia Dortmund 3-1 at the Stadion An der Alten Foersterei on Saturday.","Dortmund came into the match heavily favoured to win and reclaim their place on top of the table but struggled to match Berlin's enthusiasm in sweltering conditions in the German capital. Union were 1-0 in the 22nd minute, with Marius Buelter scoring the side's first ever top-flight goal at home. Buelter latched onto a Berlin corner which had been struck low and fast, hammering the ball into the bottom right of the net. The goal stung Dortmund into action, who equalised just two minutes later through Paco Alcacer. Dortmund coasted through the remainder of the first half, dominating possession and territory as they went in search of what seemed like an inevitable second. It was Union who would score next, however, with Buelter grabbing a second by pouncing on a desperate clearance from Dortmund keeper Roman Buerki. Sebastian Andersson added another in the 75th minute to put the home side 3-1 up and seal their first ever win in the top division. Union manager Urs Fischer said he was proud of his side's performance -- and planned on letting them savour the victory. ""We knew that it would be a really difficult 90 minutes -- when you want to take points off (Dortmund) you have to work hard and try everything. And we did it,"" Fischer said. ""I think there might be a beer or two tonight -- we'll see if we get around to completing the video analysis tonight or not."" Dortmund captain Marco Reus said the entire team was to blame for the loss. ""We had plenty of opportunities but the last pass seemed to fail us every time,"" he said. ""We simply didn't put in enough tonight."" Earlier on Saturday, Bayern Munich new boy Ivan Perisic bagged his first goal for the Bundesliga champions as they romped to a 6-1 win over a hapless Mainz at the Allianz Arena. Robert Lewandowski scored his sixth of the season in just three games, while Benjamin Pavard, David Alaba, Kingsley Coman and Alphonso Davies also found the net. In Freiburg, Cologne's Ellyes Skhiri scored the winner in second-half injury time to secure the visitors a 2-1 victory. Freiburg took the lead in the 40th minute through an own goal by Rafael Czichos, before Cologne fan favourite Anthony Modeste equalised in the 52nd minute. Schalke picked up their first win of the season over a disappointing Hertha Berlin at Gelsenkirchen's Veltins Arena. Hertha scored own goals either side of half-time through Niklas Stark and Karim Rekik. English defender Jonjoe Kenny added a third in the 86th minute to make it 3-0 -- the first goal by a Schalke player this season -- to put the game beyond doubt. Wolfsburg and Paderborn fought out a 1-1 draw at the Volkswagen Arena. Newly-promoted Paderborn went ahead through Cauly Souza in the 12th minute, before Josip Brekalo equalised in the 56th minute. At the BayArena, visitors Hoffenheim ended Bayer Leverkusen's 100 percent start to the season as the sides fought out a 0-0 draw. The visitors had to endure a six-minute spell of injury time but held firm against a luckless Leverkusen attack."
36,18/08/2019,20:25,Leipzig dominate newcomers Union Berlin,"Julian Nagelsmann started his RB Leipzig career with a bang as his side hammered Bundesliga new boys Union Berlin 4-0, as the home fans staged a silent 15-minute protest against the visitors.","Leipzig, one of the favourites to challenge Bayern Munich for the Bundesliga title this season, were always going to provide Union with a difficult initiation. It was the first time the capital city outfit had conceded four goals at home since November 2014, when they lost 4-1 to 1860 Munich. Christopher Nkunku, who arrived from Paris Saint-Germain in the summer, scored just three minutes after being substituted on for Germany striker Timo Werner, who also got on the scoresheet. Marcel Halstenberg and Marcel Sabitzer also scored for the visitors, who took a 3-0 lead into halftime. Union Berlin fans used their debut fixture in the top-flight to stage a 15-minute silent protest aimed at opponents RB Leipzig's ownership by an energy drinks company. Home fans remained quiet for the opening quarter of an hour at the Stadion An der Alten Foersterei as an expression of their opposition to the way Leipzig are run. Red Bull controls the club in one of the few exceptions to German football's ""50+1"" principal that members should own a majority of shares. Ironically, the visitors took the lead 57 seconds through Halstenberg after the Union crowd began to chant for the first time. Midfielder Halstenberg took advantage of a seemingly unfocused Berlin, curling home while unmarked on the edge of the box. Leipzig coach Nagelsmann said his side were prepared for the boycott and used it to their advantage. ""For a coach it isn't so bad at all - you can talk directly to your players (from the sideline),"" he said. ""The boys knew that after 15 minutes it would get really loud - and the atmosphere was unbelievably good afterwards. ""I would always wish that the (Berlin) fans would give it everything from the opening whistle as it's a great atmosphere here at Union - unbelievable."" Leipzig added a second 15 minutes later as heavy rain began to fall, with Marcel Sabitzer punishing Berlin for a defensive mistake inside their own half. Werner added another in the 42nd minute with a powerful strike into the top corner, with the shellshocked home side struggling to keep up with the visitors' talented outfit. Nkunku's goal in the 69th minute made it 4-0. Union boss Urs Fischer said his team couldn't afford to give teams of Leipzig's quality so many chances. ""When you're playing against a Champions League participant... And you provide so many gifts as we did, you don't need to wonder why the score is 4-0 at the end of the match,"" he said. Earlier on Sunday, a Martin Hinteregger strike after 36 seconds was enough to see Eintracht Frankfurt to a narrow 1-0 victory over TSG Hoffenheim on Sunday in their opening game of the new Bundesliga season. After winning an early corner in the opening 10 seconds, the Hoffenheim defence was caught off guard when Japan midfielder Daichi Kamada played it short to winger Filip Kostic, who curled it to the waiting Hinteregger who volleyed into the top of the net. Kostic was a constant threat throughout for the home side, vindicating Frankfurt's decision to make his loan deal permanent during the summer. Despite the loss, the visitors put in a strong performance under new coach Alfred Schreuder, showing promise as the side enters the post-Nagelsmann era."
37,18/08/2019,19:04,Union Berlin fans hold silent protest,Union Berlin fans used their club's first ever Bundesliga game on Sunday to stage a 15-minute silent protest aimed at opponents RB Leipzig's ownership by an energy drinks company.,"Home fans remained quiet for the opening quarter of an hour at the Stadion An der Alten Foersterei as an expression of their opposition to the way Leipzig are run. Red Bull controls the club in one of the few exceptions to German football's ""50+1"" principal that members should own a majority of shares. Ironically, the visitors took the lead 57 seconds after the Union crowd began to chant for the first time. Last Monday, Union's Polish goalkeeper Rafal Gikiewicz asked supporters not to stage the protest. ""You can do anything, but a boycott won't help us,"" he posted on Instagram. ""Your planned boycott in the first 15 minutes is not good for us players,"" Gikiewicz, who started on Sunday, added."
38,27/05/2019,22:58,'East' Berliners Union promoted to Bundesliga,Union Berlin were promoted to the Bundesliga for the first time in their history on Monday after beating Stuttgart in a promotion-relegation play-off.,"Having narrowly missed out on the top-tier in 2017, they are the first club from the former communist East Germany to reach the Bundesliga since Energie Cottbus were relegated in 2009. Union and Stuttgart drew 0-0 on Monday having also drawn 2-2 in the first-leg on Thursday and went through on away goals. While Bundesliga high-flyers RB Leipzig, who came up in 2016/17, are also from the East, they were founded in 2009 -- long after German reunification. Union, by contrast, are an icon of the communist era, and spent the 1970s and 1980s yo-yoing between the top two divisions of East German football. Their Alte Foersterei stadium, nestled in the forests of East Berlin, earned a reputation as a lightning rod for those critical of the regime. Since the fall of the Berlin Wall, Union have established themselves as a rare success story of East German football. Like many former East German clubs, they initially struggled with severe financial difficulties in the wake of reunification, but have since become one of the healthiest clubs in the region. Having earned promotion from the third tier in 2009, they have remained in the second division ever since, a rare bastion of stability in a volatile league. In recent years, Union have developed cult status due to their passionate support. Their fans famously helped to build the current stadium during a 2008 renovation, and gave blood to help the club pay off its debts in 2004. Promotion to the Bundesliga ranks among the clubs greatest on-field achievements, alongside their East German Cup triumph of 1968, and a German Cup final appearance in 2001. In Union and their West Berlin rivals Hertha, the German capital will be able to boast of two Bundesliga clubs this season. It will be the first time that two clubs from a single city have been in the top flight since 2010/11, when Hamburg were joined by cross-city rivals St. Pauli. Joining Union will be second-tier champions Cologne as well as Paderborn and heading down with Stuttgart are former Germany champions Hannover and Nuremberg."
39,23/05/2019,22:41,Friedrich equaliser puts Stuttgart on brink,Union Berlin defender Marvin Friedrich went from zero to hero and kept his side dreaming of promotion to Germany's top flight as they fought to a 2-2 draw at Stuttgart in the first leg of the Bundesliga relegation play-off.,"Friedrich headed home the away side's second equaliser 22 minutes from the end, not long after comically deflecting Mario Gomez's weak shot past his own goalkeeper, to give the Berliners the edge with two away goals going into the second leg. The draw means three-time German champions Stuttgart must beat second-tier side Union in the capital on Monday to avoid relegation, after finishing third from bottom in the top division. Anastasios Donis ran almost the full length of the pitch to set up Christian Gentner for Stuttgart's opener just before half-time, but Union hit back through Suleiman Abdullahi directly from the restart. Abdullahi, who missed a late chance to secure automatic promotion in Bochum at the weekend, picked up a long ball flicked on by Sebastian Andersson and smashed the ball in from just inside the area. Stuttgart coach Nico Willig brought on Gomez at half-time, and the veteran striker restored the home side's lead five minutes later when he scuffed his shot in off the head of the unfortunate Friedrich. Friedrich's redemption came 15 minutes later as he headed the visitors level again, giving them the advantage ahead of the decisive return leg at the Alte Foersterei stadium."
40,12/04/2019,04:30,Cult east Berlin club eyes Bundesliga promotion with suspicion,"Before every home game, fans of Union Berlin belt out their team's anthem, by East German punk rock legend Nina Hagen.","One line at the end of the first verse is sung with particular gusto: ""Who will never be bought by the West?!"", scream the ""Unioners"". Berlin's second biggest club, behind top-tier Hertha Berlin, has a rebellious streak dating back to the days of communist rule in East Germany. With the club third in the second division, bidding for a first promotion to the Bundesliga, Unioners rail against the commercialism of modern football. Nestled in the woods of the East Berlin suburb of Koepenick, Union's fiercely local fanbase is growing, as young newcomers to the city fall in love with the club's identity. ""Union is a mixture of extremely different people who have chosen the same club,"" Union fan Christoph Arend, 53, tells AFP in the stadium's local pub - ""Abseitsfalle"" (Offside trap). A red-and-white scarf around his neck, Christoph remembers the ""slightly anarchic"" atmosphere around the club when he first became a fan as an 11-year-old in the 1970s. Founded in 1966, Union were conceived as a ""civilians' club"", as opposed to the official army club Vorwaerts Berlin, and the club of the secret police Dynamo Berlin. They came to be seen as a plucky, likeable alternative to Dynamo, who dominated East German football. ""There was a saying back then: 'Not all Union fans are in the opposition, but everyone in the opposition supports Union',"" laughs Christoph. He remembers how fans would shout ""down with the wall!"" when players formed a wall to defend a free-kick. ""Everyone in the stadium knew which wall they were talking about,"" he smiles. While the once mighty Dynamo have sunk to Germany's fourth tier, Union are one of the few clubs from the former communist East who have enjoyed success in reunified Germany. Union's ""Alte Forsterei"" stadium remains refuge from the hyper-commercialism of modern football. There is minimal advertising and the club has ruled out selling the stadium's name to a sponsor. ""The match is not a circus event or a television show,"" explains Union's head of communications and stadium announcer Christian Arbeit. The club works to keep its fans and members on side, partly in recognition of all they have done for it in the past. In 2004, with Union on the brink of bankruptcy, many fans gave blood at their local medical centre and donated their donor's fees to the club. Four years later, more than 2,500 fans volunteered to help renovate the stadium so it would meet second-division requirements. The club later erected a monument to the volunteers. Union can now look back on a decade of stability in the second tier. Plans to add around 15,000 places to the 22,000-capacity stadium were announced in 2017, and the team are regular promotion candidates. Yet former stadium announcer Andre Rolle worries that promotion may harm the club's unique identity. ""I don't want the club to go up because I am convinced that, little by little, they would then have to sacrifice their values,"" he tells AFP. He is not alone. In 2017, when Union came within a few games of promotion, fans held up a banner reading: ""Shit! We're going up!"" More recently, Union fans have made national headlines for the wrong reasons. During last month's 2-0 home win over Ingolstadt, an apparent Union supporter launched an anti-Semitic Twitter tirade against Ingolstadt's Israeli captain Almog Cohen. The tweet was immediately condemned by the club, and was the subject of a police investigation. For Florian Schubert, author of a book called ""Antisemitism in Football"", this was an ""isolated case"". Andre Rolle, meanwhile, believes that ""a good number"" of Union supporters vote for the far-right AfD party, but points out that the leading ultra fan groups tend to be more left-wing. ""Unlike other places, like Chemnitz or Cottbus, the extremists don't get to decide which flags are displayed or which songs are sung,"" insists Rolle."
41,10/03/2019,16:35,Anti-Semitic fooball tweet sparks outrage in Germany and Israel,"The Israeli government on Sunday said it was ""shocked"" by an anti-Semitic tweet sent to an Israeli football player during a second division game in Berlin, in an incident being investigated by German police.","In a profanity-laced insult, an apparent fan of FC Union Berlin tweeted that Almog Cohen, captain of opposing team Ingolstadt, should disappear into ""the chamber"", a reference to the gas chambers used by the Nazis to kill Jews during the Holocaust. The tweet was posted after Cohen received a red card during Friday's match in the German capital, which Union Berlin won 2-0. ""We are shocked by the anti-Semitic tweet against Almog Cohen and expect the German authorities to take firm action against the person"" responsible, foreign ministry spokesman Emmanuel Nahshon told AFP. Both football clubs immediately condemned the abuse, with Union Berlin swiftly filing a complaint with police for incitement to hatred. ""I'm ashamed of such Union fans,"" club president Dirk Zingler said in a statement. ""FC Union stands for humanistic and democratic values. Anyone who doesn't share these values has no place in our club or our stadium."" A Berlin police spokeswoman told DPA news agency that the state security service, which deals with politically motivated crimes, had opened an investigation. The rant brought an outpouring of support for 30-year-old Cohen, who also plays for the Israeli national team. ""Almog, you will never be alone!"", tweeted the Israeli ambassador to Germany, Jeremy Issacharoff, condemning the ""despicable"" anti-Jewish insult. Christoph Heubner, vice-president of the International Auschwitz Committee, said the hate-filled tweet highlighted a worrying rise in anti-Semitism in Germany. Such ""outbursts of hatred"" are ""disgusting and alarming -- and not just to Holocaust survivors -- because of their direct reference to the gas chambers of Auschwitz,"" he said. Cohen, who has lived in Germany for nine years, tweeted a message of thanks to his supporters. ""As a Jewish professional football player in Germany I just want to say: I am very proud of my heritage and of representing my country in the second division and being captain of Ingolstadt 04,"" he wrote. ""A big thank you to my club which gives me the support and therefore the strength to master any situation."" The German Football Association (DFB) also slammed the ""disgusting"" tweet and said it would look into the matter. The DFB is no stranger to condemning racist behaviour from fans, especially from hardcore so-called ""Ultras"" linked to the far-right. In a separate incident at the weekend, fourth-tier club Chemnitzer FC sparked an uproar after it allowed supporters to stage a tribute to a recently deceased fan, who was reportedly a known neo-Nazi, at the start of a regional match. The deceased, Thomas Haller, for years provided security for the club and co-founded the ""HooNaRa"" (Hooligans-Nazis-Racists) group in the 1990s that was disbanded in 2007, local broadcaster MDR reported. He remained a leading figure in Chemnitz's far-right scene, MDR said, and took part in racist riots that rocked the city last year following the fatal stabbing of a German man, allegedly by immigrant men. Some of the protesters at the time were arrested for giving the Hitler salute, which is illegal in Germany. On Sunday, the club announced their CEO and commercial managing director Thomas Uhlig had resigned with immediate effect over the scandal. Chemnitz also fined striker Daniel Frahn, who held up a T-Shirt, which is popular amongst neo-Nazis, during the match but later apologised. ""I was not aware that this T-shirt was so widely used in the Nazi scene,"" said Frahn in a statement. The latest controversies come less than a month after the German government revealed a startling increase in anti-Semitic hate crimes, echoing a trend seen in other Western countries like France as the political climate becomes more polarised and the far-right more outspoken. German police recorded 1,646 offences motivated by hatred against Jews last year, an increase of almost 10 percent and the highest level in a decade. Among these were 62 violent offences, up from 37 in 2017. Most of the crimes were committed by far-right sympathisers, but Berlin has also expressed growing concern about anti-Jewish sentiment among migrants from Arab states. ""It shames and hurts me that anti-Semitism is once again showing its ugly face more often and more openly in Germany, of all places,"" German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier said on Sunday."

43,27/10/2016,00:21,"Bayern march on in cup, Dortmund need penalties",Holders Bayern Munich reached the third round of the German Cup with a 3-1 win over Augsburg on Wednesday while second-division Union Berlin took injury-hit Borussia Dortmund to penalties.,"Goals by Philipp Lahm, Julian Green and David Alaba sealed Bayern's win at the Allianz Arena, while Borussia, last season's finalists, endured nervous moments before beating Union 3-0 in a shoot-out after it finished 1-1 in Dortmund. In Munich, Bayern coach Carlo Ancelotti rested a host of stars for Saturday's away Bundesliga clash -- also against Augsburg -- and next Tuesday's Champions League clash at PSV Eindhoven. Alaba, Holger Badstuber, Arjen Robben, Arturo Vidal, Xabi Alonso and Robert Lewandowski were all on the bench while US striker Green made a rare start. Bastuber came on for the last ten minutes for his first appearance in nearly nine months after injury. ""In the first galf we controlled the game, but we weren't so good after the break,"" admitted Ancelotti. ""I'm very pleased that Holger is back, he worked hard for it."" Bayern went ahead with two minutes gone when Thomas Mueller fed Lahm and the Bayern captain drilled home his shot. Mueller then floated in the cross which Green headed home to make it 2-0 on 41 minutes. Bayern defender Mats Hummels conceded a penalty on Augsburg midfielder Gojko Kacar, but Manuel Neuer came to the rescue when Germany's goalkeeper saved Koo Ja-Cheol's spot kick on 49 minutes. Augsburg pulled a goal back on the counter attack when Ji Dong-Won cut in and blasted his shot home from a tight angle on 69 minutes. But Alaba came on with five minutes to go and rifled home Bayern's third in the 94th minute to settle the result. Dortmund, missing a host of injured stars like Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Marco Reus, went through after a scare. Dortmund took the lead thanks to a first-half own goal from ex-Dortmund defender Michael Parensen, but Union striker Steven Skrzybski levelled with nine minutes left Goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller was Dortmund's hero with two saves in the shoot-out, while Ousmane Dembele, Matthias Ginter and Mario Goetze netted their spot-kicks. Schalke scrapped into the third round with a nervy 3-2 win over second-division Nuremberg. Ukraine winger Yevhen Konoplyanka scored twice as the Royal Blues raced into a 3-0 half-time lead. But Ghana defender Abdul Rahman Baba, on loan from Chelsea netted an own goal, then Tobias Kempe converted a penalty for Nuremberg to set up a tense final 20 minutes. Cologne beat Hoffenheim 2-1 as Anthony Modeste, the Bundesliga's top scorer, netted a 91st-winner in extra time as Hoffenheim suffered their first defeat of the season. There were several upsets elsewhere. Bundesliga club Darmstadt were humbled 1-0 by fourth division Astoria Walldorf while second division Greuther Fuerth sealed a 2-1 win over top-tier side Mainz. In total, seven top German league clubs exited at the second-round stage. On Tuesday, Champions League side Bayer Leverkusen lost on penalties to third-division Sportfreunde Lotte which leaves head coach Roger Schmidt under pressure. Freiburg were beaten by second-division Sandhausen and Eintracht Frankfurt beat Ingolstadt on penalties in an all-Bundesliga clash."

""Sambou is tall, powerful, dynamic and courageous, but like any new player he will need time to adjust,"" said Bremen's director of sport Thomas Eichin. ""He is a player both the coach and I wanted to sign. He was number one on our list and we are pleased the transfer has come off."" Bremen, who are third from bottom, host third-placed Hertha Berlin in Germany's top flight on Saturday, which comes too soon for Yatabare to feature. Tremmel, 37, was born in Munich and boasts 125 Bundesliga appearances with SpVgg Unterhaching (in 2000/01), Hannover 96, Hertha Berlin and Energie Cottbus. He has been brought in as cover for first-choice shot-stopper Felix Wiedwald, with reserve goalkeepers Michael Zetterer and Raphael Wolf struggling with injuries. ""We needed to reinforce in goal,"" explained Eichin. ""Gerhard Tremmel is a goalkeeper with a huge amount of experience who will support our young goalkeepers and Felix Wiedwald."" Meanwhile, Bremen has sent Germany star Toni Kroos' brother Felix, who made eight league appearances this season, on loan to Berlin-based FC Union, who are mid-table in the second division. The Bundesliga's winter transfer window closes at 1800 local time (1700 GMT) on February 1."
45,21/12/2014,14:47,Berlin club swaps floodlit football for candle-lit carols,"The stadium's terraces are packed to capacity with the crowd singing loudly, but there's no match on -- floodlit football has been replaced with carols by candlelight.","Welcome to second-division club FC Union's 'Weihnachtssingen' -- a candle-lit carol concert with 27,500 fans expected to belt out festive songs alongside a choir, a band and a small religious service. Berlin-based Union, who are currently mid-table in Germany's second tier, have long since sold all the tickets for Tuesday's event, which has become a traditional date at the club's An der Alten Foersterei Stadium in the eastern suburb of Koepenick. Free candles and song sheets are handed out at the entrance as players and fans sing German carols like 'O Christmas Tree' and 'Silent Night' side-by-side on the pitch or in the stands. Other German clubs have borrowed the idea with 1860 Munich and Alemannia Aachen now holding their own carol concerts on a smaller scale. ""For me, it's the best of both worlds, you start to have that Christmas feeling with Gluehwein (mulled wine) and songs, but with a football atmosphere in a filled stadium at the same time,"" Union fan Juri Denecke told AFP. The event has illicit roots when a group of 89 Union fans, carrying Gluehwein and festive biscuits, climbed over the fence to break into the stadium in December 2003 to hold an impromptu carol concert on the pitch with friends and family. The annual 'secret' gathering spread by word of mouth, grew year on year and is now the biggest event in the club's calender. Torsten Eisenbeiser, who helps organise it, was one of the original singers more than a decade ago and is staggered by it's development. ""No one at the time thought we would ever reach such dimensions,"" he admits. Due to demand, it will be ticket-only for the first time this year, with five euros (six dollars) for standing or 10 euros for a seat. The gates had to be closed last December when the 27,500 capacity was reached, leaving hundreds locked out. ""Preparations have been going on for weeks,"" Union's press officer Christian Arbeit told AFP. ""The biggest problem is getting enough staff, because it's always held the last night before Germans celebrate Christmas and many people are either on holiday or are preparing their own celebrations. ""But we need more employees for that evening than we do for any other night of the year. ""More people came last year than fit in the stadium, so we had to limit numbers and the fans voted to charge five euros, with the money going to the club's youth section. ""All members got a free ticket to give as many people as possible the chance to come. ""And it also gives long time Union fans, who built this place and kept the club alive, a little advantage."" Arbeit is not only involved in organising the event, he will be playing in it. ""We try and keep the programme as familiar as possible,"" he explained. ""There is always a choir from the same school in Koepenick and a parish priest from the town, while my parents and I will be on the trombone, clarinet and trumpet -- like a small family celebration. ""So we can all feel at home -- even if there are now so many people."" The pitch will be well protected after the 2012 event cost the club a quarter of a million euros because a new playing surface had to be laid after heavy rain and thousands of trampling feet ruined the grass. While neighbours Hertha Berlin ply their trade in Germany's Bundesliga, Union's supporters have carved out a reputation for social initiatives. When the club lacked the funds to renovate the stadium six years ago, around 2,500 fans gifted 140,000 work hours between May 2008 and June 2009 to make sure the modernisation was completed. And in 2004, with the club facing bankruptcy, supporters organised the campaign ""Bleed for Union"" where fans gave blood and forwarded the nominal fee donors receive in Germany to the club."
