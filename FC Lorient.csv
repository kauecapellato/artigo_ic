0,01/02/2021,14:47,"Messi fuels Barcelona revival, Marseille violence, Poch beaten: Talking points from around Europe","Lionel Messi kept up his improved form in La Liga as Barcelona won again amid more controversy about the Catalans' finances, while there was drama on and off the field in France and the Milan clubs continue to fight it out at the top of Serie A.","AFP Sport rounds up some of the main talking points from across the continent: Barcelona have said they will take legal action against Spanish newspaper El Mundo after it published details at the weekend of Lionel Messi's current contract, which it says is worth up to 555 million euros ($674 million) over four years. El Mundo called it the ""colossal contract that ruins Barcelona"", just as the Catalans are wrestling with a dire financial situation, worsened by the pandemic, and with Messi's future currently up in the air. Yet the Argentine underlined his value to Barca by scoring a superb free-kick in their 2-1 win over Athletic Bilbao. Barca are unbeaten in 10 n La Liga, winning eight, with Messi scoring eight times in that run. However, both Barcelona and Real Madrid are 10 points behind leaders Atletico Madrid, who beat Cadiz 4-2 and still boast a game in hand. Marseille's weekend game against Rennes in Ligue 1 was postponed after angry supporters attacked the club's training ground, while the players were there, in what was called ""a frenzy of unjustifiable violence"". Local police said 25 arrests were made and seven officers were injured after several hundred Ultras stormed La Commanderie in a protest against the club leadership and the team's poor recent run of results. Marseille's owner, the American tycoon Frank McCourt, called the protestors ""thugs"" and likened the incidents to last month's storming of the US Congress. The growing crisis comes with the former Champions League winners having slumped to ninth in Ligue 1 and after coach Andre Villas-Boas indicated he will leave at the end of the season. On the pitch in France, the title race is hotting up after reigning champions Paris Saint-Germain suffered their first defeat under new coach Mauricio Pochettino, conceding at the death to lose 3-2 at struggling Lorient despite Neymar scoring two penalties. It was a fifth defeat in Ligue 1 this season for PSG, who are third, three points behind leaders Lille. Lille beat Dijon 1-0, while Lyon are two points off top spot in second after scoring late to beat Bordeaux 2-1. It could even become a four-way fight. Monaco are six points off the lead after winning their last five games. Bayern Munich maintained their seven-point lead at the top of the German Bundesliga by beating Hoffenheim 4-1 as Robert Lewandowski scored his 24th goal of the league campaign. After a mini slump, the Bavarians have now four on the bounce and remain well clear of nearest rivals RB Leipzig. The result against Hoffenheim also allowed Hansi Flick's side to exact perfect revenge for their 4-1 defeat away to the same opponents in September, in what was their only loss in 46 matches in all competitions across a remarkable 2020. The only cloud on Bayern's weekend came as midfielder Corentin Tolisso was dropped and fined for getting a tattoo, therefore falling foul of Covid-19 quarantine regulations. Zlatan Ibrahimovic's spat with Romelu Lukaku dominated the headlines last midweek as Inter beat AC Milan in their Coppa Italia derby. On Saturday Ibrahimovic missed a penalty for the fourth time this season but Ante Rebic followed up to score and Franck Kessie later netted another spot-kick as Milan won 2-1 at Bologna. That result kept the Rossoneri two points clear of Inter at the top of Serie A, as Antonio Conte's side beat Benevento 4-0 with Lukaku scoring a brace at San Siro. The Belgian is on 14 league goals for the season and Inter remain best-placed to overhaul Milan, even if Roma, Juventus, Lazio and Napoli all also won at the weekend."
1,31/01/2021,17:10,PSG suffer first defeat under Pochettino,Paris Saint-Germain suffered their first defeat under Mauricio Pochettino as lowly Lorient fought back to claim a dramatic 3-2 victory on Sunday and prevent the defending champions from retaking top spot in Ligue 1.,"Neymar scored two penalties but the visitors collapsed late on at the Stade du Moustoir, as Nigerian Terem Moffi netted an injury-time winner. The loss saw PSG stay one point behind league leaders Lyon, although third-placed Lille could go two points clear when they host Dijon later on Sunday. ""We have to keep the positive aspects and move forward,"" said former Tottenham manager Pochettino. ""Accidents happen in football. We have to keep working. It makes us realise that it can happen if we don't play at 100 percent."" It was the first defeat in six games as PSG coach for Pochettino since he took over from the sacked Thomas Tuchel. The win takes struggling Lorient into the relegation play-off spot. ""(Moffi's goal) was magical. Against PSG, it's even crazier,"" said Lorient's Laurent Abergel, who scored the opening goal. ""For a Marseille fan like me, the first dream is perhaps to play for OM and the second to beat PSG."" Lorient started brightly and had the first real shot in anger in the 30th minute, as Adrian Grbic's long-range strike had to be pushed away by PSG goalkeeper Sergio Rico. The hosts did take the lead six minutes later, though, as PSG failed several times to clear and Abergel picked out the top corner with the outside of his left boot. Neymar levelled on the stroke of half-time from the penalty spot with his fifth league goal of the season. PSG improved after the break and took the lead in the 57th minute as Houboulang Mendes, who also conceded the first penalty, brought down Mauro Icardi and Neymar again made no mistake. It was the first time since Zlatan Ibrahimovic in 2015 that a PSG player had netted two spot-kicks in a Ligue 1 match. The visitors pressed for a third, but Lorient goalkeeper Matthieu Dreyer made an excellent stop to keep out an Icardi header. That proved to be crucial, as the stubborn home side equalised in the 80th minute. Substitute Yoane Wissa scored an excellent individual goal, his sixth of his first full campaign as a top-flight player. PSG went in search of a winner, but the closest they came saw full-back Layvin Kurzawa's drive fly narrowly wide. They over-committed in the second minute of added time, leaving no defenders within 60 yards of their own goal as Moffi was sent racing clean through. The 21-year-old, on as a sub, slotted the ball into the bottom corner to spark wild celebrations for the home team."
2,20/12/2020,23:59,Lorient groundsman dies after heat lamp accident,A groundsman working for Lorient died on Sunday after being hit by a falling playing field heat lamp shortly after the Ligue 1 club's 3-0 home defeat to Rennes.,"The mayor of Lorient Fabrice Loher confirmed the news after widespread reports in French media of the death. ""A member of the contracted pitch maintenance team working for the club died after the accidental fall of a heat lamp,"" the city said in a statement. It was Rennes substitutes who raised the alarm as they were still on the pitch when the accident took place. Players and medical staff were seen on television rushing back out to the pitch to help, and were shortly joined by a team of fire fighters. Some remained on the sidelines in shock as rescue workers tried to save the man, reportedly a 38-year-old father of three. He was transported to a local emergency unit but did survive."
3,18/08/2020,15:06,Trevoh Chalobah joins Lorient on loan from Chelsea,Lorient on Tuesday announced the arrival of Chelsea defensive midfielder Trevoh Chalobah on a one-season loan without an option to buy.,"Chalobah, who is 21, is a product of the Chelsea youth system. He was born in Freetown, Sierra Leone, but has captained England at every level from under-16 to under-20. His older brother Nathaniel, who is at Watford, is an England intentional. Trevoh, who is 1.90 metres (6ft 3in) tall, spent the last two years playing in the English championship, first on loan at Ipswich and last season on loan at Huddersfield. ""Chalobah is easy in possession, tough in the tackle and quick across the ground,"" said Chelsea announcing the loan on their website. Lorient are returning to Ligue 1 after winning promotion because they were top of the second division when the coronavirus pandemic halted the French season. ""Trevoh is a young player with a lot of experience,"" said Lorient coach Christophe Pelissier. ""He has built up a character that allows him to play at the highest level and to fight to stay there. A versatile player, since he can also play in central defence, Trevoh has an athletic profile that complements our squad."""
4,02/10/2016,19:11,Balotelli beauty leaves Nice top,A superb Mario Balotelli strike four minutes from time gave Nice a 2-1 win over Lorient on Sunday that left them top of the Ligue 1 table going into the international break.,"Ricardo Pereira put Nice in front on the Cote d'Azur but Benjamin Moukandjo equalised in the second half and it looked as if Lucien Favre's side would have to settle for a draw until Balotelli bent in a brilliant late winner. Beaten 5-2 in Russia by Krasnodar in the Europa League on Thursday, this result got Nice back on track and maintained their impressive unbeaten record domestically so far. After eight games, they sit a point clear of local rivals Monaco, who beat Metz 7-0 away on Saturday to record their biggest ever away win in France's top flight. Defending champions Paris Saint-Germain are third, four points adrift of the leaders, following a 2-0 defeat of Bordeaux on Saturday in which Edinson Cavani scored twice to take his tally for the season to eight league goals. At the Allianz Riviera, Nice went in front with just 11 minutes on the clock as Portuguese full-back Pereira cut in from the right and sent in a shot that surprised Benjamin Lecomte in the Lorient goal. But the Brittany side had beaten Lyon in their last outing and they caused problems for a Nice side showing only two changes from the starting line-up that took to the field in Russia barely 72 hours previously. Jimmy Cabot came close on a couple of occasions in the first half and Arnold Mvuemba had a free-kick deflected just wide two minutes into the second half. The equaliser duly arrived shortly after the hour mark when Cameroon international Moukandjo finished nicely from a Mohamed Mara pass. Malang Sarr then deflected a Mara shot onto his own bar as Nice found themselves hanging on, but then a moment of magic from their Italian striker decided the game in the home side's favour. Wylan Cyprien flicked the ball into the path of Balotelli inside the area, and he took a touch before curling a powerful shot into the top-right corner of the net for his sixth goal in a Nice shirt in just five appearances. Nice are next in action at home to Lyon on Friday, October 14. Earlier on Sunday, Pierrick Capelle's stoppage-time equaliser gave Angers a 1-1 draw at home to struggling Marseille, who had taken the lead via Florian Thauvin's deflected effort. Lyon host bitter rivals Saint-Etienne in Sunday's late game."
5,31/08/2016,17:09,Sunderland pay record fee for Gabon star Ndong,"Gabonese international midfield dynamo Didier Ndong signed for Premier League side Sunderland from French outfit Lorient on Wednesday for a club record fee of £13.6 million (16 million euros, $17.8m).","The 22-year-old -- capped 18 times since making his debut in 2012 -- signed a five-year contract with the 'Black Cats', ending a stay of just under two years with Lorient where he scored twice in 46 appearances. His disciplinary record may be a cause for concern for Sunderland manager David Moyes as he accrued 11 yellow cards last season and he had already been sent off once in the present Ligue 1 campaign. ""I am very proud and happy to sign for Sunderland,"" said Ndong, who cost Lorient just a million euros when they signed him. ""This is a new adventure for me and to play in the Premier League is a dream come true. ""Maybe the Sunderland fans don't know me yet, but I promise that they will quickly discover that I will give everything for them and the club. ""It will be an honour to wear the Sunderland shirt and I will wear it with a true understanding of what it means. ""Today is the most beautiful day of my life."" Ndong, who began his professional career with Tunisian side CS Sfaxien, is Moyes' seventh signing since he replaced Sam Allardyce when he was appointed England boss."
6,27/01/2016,21:28,Sunderland sign Kone from Lorient,"Relegation-threatened Sunderland on Wednesday signed Ivory Coast defender Lamine Kone from French side Lorient for an undisclosed fee, the English Premier League club announced.","The 26-year-old French-born centre-back signed a deal which will keep him at the Stadium of Light until the end of 2020 season. ""Strengthening our defensive options was a priority for us and Lamine is a player that has impressed me when I've seen him play,"" said Sunderland manager Sam Allardyce. ""He is big and strong, attributes you need to play in central defence in the Premier League, and his arrival will give us healthy competition for places in a key position."" Kone represented France at youth level before making his full international debut for the Ivory Coast in 2014. Sunderland are currently second from bottom of the table, having conceded 46 goals in 23 games for the worst defensive record in the top flight."
7,12/12/2015,22:16,Antonetti continues winning start with Lille,Lille grabbed the spotlight with a third straight Ligue 1 win under their new coach Frederic Antonetti on Saturday as Lorient were beaten 3-0.,"Lille sacked previous coach Herve Renard, who had garnered just two league wins, in November and since taking over the motivational Antonetti has also overseen wins at Caen and at home to Saint Etienne in his two other games. Striker Eric Bautheac opened the scoring for Lille with a fine header on 28 minutes and doubled the tally with a tap in on 56 minutes before Djibril Sidibe ended any suspense on six minutes from time. With the attention of the football world fixed on the Euro 2016 draw, the day's Ligue 1 programme featured none of the major teams. Runaway leaders Paris Saint Germain are 15 points clear at the top and host Lyon on Sunday evening as second placed Angers entertain Bordeaux earlier in the afternoon. Elsewhere on Saturday evening, bottom side Troyes earned just their seventh point of the season with a 1-1 draw at home to Bastia. Second from bottom Toulouse got a point at Nantes with a 1-1 draw while Montpellier came from behind to beat Guingamp 2-1. Nice started the season well but gave up a late 1-1 draw at Reims to extend their winless run to four league games. After three matches without a goal, at least Claude Puel's men raced into a lead from their first real attack with a towering header from striker Valere Germain. It was his eighth league goal of the season. Nice were guilty however of sitting back on their single goal lead and conceded a penalty under pressure, converted with 15 minutes to go by Diego Rigonato. In Friday's games Rennes and Caen shared the spoils after a 1-1 draw that kept Caen third ahead of Monaco's chance to climb above them on Sunday when they host Saint Etienne. Laurent Blanc's PSG will look to continue a stunning start to their campaign that has seen them drop just six points. Paris have not lost a domestic game since March and a fourth straight title already appears a formality. Elsewhere, Marseille can continue their mini-revival at home to Corsican side Gazelec Ajaccio with the top three just six points above them."
8,21/11/2015,14:22,Indomitable Lion Moukandjo roaring at Lorient,"While the presence of Zlatan Ibrahimovic at the top of the scorers' charts in France will surprise nobody, that of Benjamin Moukandkjo would not have been expected even at his own club.","Moukandjo scored nine goals in his first 13 appearances for Lorient since joining the modest Brittany outfit from their Ligue 1 rivals Reims in the summer. That allowed him to match the tally of Paris Saint-Germain superstar Ibrahimovic before Lorient welcomed the team from the capital to their tidy Stade du Moustoir on Saturday. Lorient were probably expecting the biggest impact in attack to come from Ghana star Majeed Waris, another summer recruit, but instead it is the 27-year-old Cameroon international who is, a little belatedly, fulfilling his undoubted potential. Born in Douala, Moukandjo started out at the Kadji Sport Academies (KSA) in the suburbs of Cameroon's largest city and commercial capital. When he was just 17, his pace, technical ability and eye for goal led many to compare him to Indomitable Lions superstar Samuel Eto'o, who also came through the KSA. It is a comparison that Moukandjo does not like -- ""It is not me who made that comparison"", he invariably replies when it is put to him. Indeed, Moukandjo has had a journeyman career compared to the glittering success enjoyed by Eto'o. In France since the age of 18, he played for Rennes, Nimes, Monaco and Nancy before joining Reims in 2014. His eight goals last season helped the Champagne outfit avoid relegation and led to him joining Lorient on a two-year deal in the summer. ""He has been a great success that we are very proud of,"" said Lorient's English vice-president Alex Hayes. ""He is having a great start to the season and is giving a demonstration of the art of the modern attacker, because he is a player who plays out wide, as a number nine, as a number 10."" The player himself has been much more modest about his performances. ""I didn't expect, when I arrived, to have such a prolific start to the season,"" said Moukandjo, who has already beaten his personal best for goals scored in a single campaign. The likes of Andre-Pierre Gignac, Kevin Gameiro, Jordan Ayew and fellow Cameroonian Vincent Aboubakar have all passed through Lorient in recent years but none started a season with such a bang as Moukandjo now. ""He is profiting from the work put in by his team-mates but beyond his qualities and talent he also works very hard for the team,"" said Lorient coach Sylvain Ripoll. His goals helped Lorient to seventh place in the table before the November international break and the striker, who played for his country at last year's World Cup in Brazil, is targeting more success. ""This is not an end in itself. I am not going to limit myself to this. I am going to try to do much more because I know I can,"" said Moukandjo, a great admirer of Swedish star Ibrahimovic. ""He has a very strong character and takes responsibility for everything he does and says. In this business and in everyday life, that is something you need. ""You have to admire him, watch him and try to match him. ""If I could achieve half of what he has done it would be wonderful. He is a source of inspiration for me and must be for many other players too."""
9,18/10/2015,16:27,Stuttering Marseille held by Lorient,Stumbling Marseille dropped points again on Sunday as they were held to a 1-1 draw by Lorient at the Stade Velodrome in Ligue 1.,"Michel's side took the lead thanks to a Michy Batshuayi penalty midway through the first half but Benjamin Moukandjo levelled for the visitors before the interval. Marseille's failure to build on an encouraging performance in losing 2-1 at Paris Saint-Germain in their last outing before the international break leaves them without a win in six matches in all competitions. They continue to languish in 16th place in the table and are six points adrift of Lorient, with the Bretons provisionally up to eighth having lost just one of their last six outings. OM were looking for revenge for a 5-3 defeat at home to Lorient last season and they took the lead in the 22nd minute when Belgian striker Batshuayi converted from the spot after Francois Bellugou had been penalised for handball. However, the away side were back on level terms eight minutes prior to half-time as Nicolas Nkoulou got caught underneath a high ball and his Cameroon colleague Moukandjo took advantage to score. On Saturday, Paris Saint-Germain warmed up for their Champions League clash with Real Madrid by beating Bastia 2-0 in Corsica thanks to two second-half goals by Zlatan Ibrahimovic. PSG are still unbeaten this season and remain five points clear of surprise nearest challengers Angers and Caen, who both won away from home, 2-1 at Toulouse and 1-0 at Reims respectively. Saint-Etienne are fourth after easing to a 2-0 win at home to bottom side Gazelec Ajaccio with Robert Beric and Kevin Monnet-Paquet both on target, but Rennes can go back above Les Verts on goal difference if they beat Nice on Sunday evening. A late Rafael equaliser earned Lyon a 1-1 draw at Monaco on Friday after the principality club had taken the lead through on-loan Chelsea midfielder Mario Pasalic. Elsewhere this weekend, Nantes beat struggling Troyes 3-0 and Guingamp held Lille 1-1 in Brittany. Sunday's other game sees Bordeaux host Montpellier."
10,06/08/2015,10:56,Ghana striker Majeed joins Lorient,"Ghana international striker Waris Majeed has signed for Lorient, the French Ligue 1 outfit said on Thursday.","Majeed, 23, had been expected to join Rennes in a 3.5 million euro ($4.36 million) deal from Turkish side Trabzonspor. But at the last hour, Lorient trumped their Ligue 1 rivals' bid with a 4-million-euro plus bonuses offer. Lorient were able to outbid fellow Bretons Rennes thanks to the 12 million-euro fee garnered from Aston Villa for the sale of Majeed's Ghana international teammate Jordan Ayew. Contacted by AFP, Rennes, who had sent someone to Charles de Gaulle airport just outside Paris to meet Majeed, refused to comment. Majeed previously played in France for Valenciennes in 2013/14 where he scored an impressive nine goals in 16 appearances."
11,27/07/2015,16:33,Aston Villa snap up Ayew,Aston Villa have once again raided France's Ligue 1 to complete the signing of Ghana striker Jordan Ayew from Lorient.,"Villa announced on Monday that the 23-year-old had signed for an undisclosed fee and had penned a five-year deal in Birmingham after passing a medical. ""I'm really pleased to bring Jordan to the football club. He is a fantastic young player who is perfectly suited to the Premier League,"" said Villa manager Tim Sherwood. Ayew, the son of Ghana legend Abedi Pele, started his career at Marseille but struggled to win a regular first-team place at the Stade Velodrome. He shone on loan at Sochaux in the second half of the 2013-14 season and then joined Lorient last year, scoring 12 goals in 31 Ligue 1 games. He had been a target for Lille, but has chosen to move to Villa where he will attempt to help fill the void left by Christian Benteke's £32.5 million (45.6m euro, $50.6m) switch to Liverpool. Earlier on Monday, Spanish side Cordoba announced that they had agreed a deal for 28-year-old full-back Jose Angel Crespo to move to Villa. Sherwood's side have already been busy in the transfer market this summer, with signings including Lille's Senegal midfielder Idrissa Gueye and young Nice full-back Jordan Amavi as well as Manchester City defender Micah Richards. Ayew's elder brother Andre also recently swapped France for the Premier League, joining Swansea City on a free transfer after his contract with Marseille expired."
12,08/03/2015,19:11,Late goals lift Saint-Etienne,"Saint-Etienne brought their seven-game winless streak to an end with a 2-0 victory over strugglers Lorient on Sunday and leapfrogged Bordeaux into fifth place in Ligue 1, closing in on the European places.","Yohan Mollo came off the bench to break the deadlock with just 15 minutes to go before Max-Alain Gradel made sure of all three points in injury time. Saint-Etienne, who needed penalties to beat third-tier Boulogne in the French Cup quarter-finals on Tuesday, found Benjamin Lecomte in defiant mood in the Lorient goal. ""It's an important win for us. We needed it after last week's draw at Toulouse and the French Cup win,"" said Saint-Etienne coach Christophe Galtier. ""We have had quite a few injuries lately and lost a few players so there have been some changes in the team. ""But this has given us the chance to look at some of the younger players. And the substitutes have played their part, too."" Mollo, who had only been on the field a matter of minutes, took his chance from just outside the box. His powerful shot, deflected by Mehdi Mostefa, beat the hapless Lecomte with a quarter of an hour left. Africa Cup of Nations winner Gradel then grabbed his third goal in as many league games to seal the match by tapping in a clever Romain Hamouma cross in injury time. Lorient, who had been reduced to 10 men when Didier Ndong was sent off for a second bookable offence in the 67th minute, are now just two points above the relegation zone. Meanwhile, Guingamp slumped to a third straight league defeat, going down 1-0 at home to Lille with Nolan Roux scoring the only goal of the game. The result takes Lille up to eighth but leaves Guingamp, who won through to the semi-finals of the French Cup in midweek, in the bottom half. Later on Sunday, Lyon, who have managed a mere six points from their last five league outings, travel to Montpellier needing a win to overtake Paris Saint-Germain and go back to the top. On Saturday, PSG provisionally moved into first place with a routine 4-1 home win against struggling Lens. Fourth-placed Monaco also won, 3-1 away at Evian, to move back to within six points of Marseille, who are third, with a game in hand."
13,15/02/2015,23:24,Lorient stop Lyon for Ligue 1 status quo,Leaders Lyon failed to take advantage of stalemates by chasing Paris Saint-Germain and Marseille being held to a 1-1 draw at Lorient in Ligue 1 action on Sunday.,"PSG and Marseille, who were both held 2-2 over the weekend, remain two points behind Lyon, who have 51 points from 25 games. A Jordan Ayew header early in the second half stunned the French leaders before they grabbed a point when Clinton N'Jie levelled with 12 minutes to go. The Ghanaian forward, playing his first game since losing to the Ivory Coast in the Africa Cup of Nations final, was at the end of a Benjamin Jeannot cross to net his seventh goal of the season just five minutes after coming on at halftime. Struggling in Brittany, Lyon relied on N'Jie to find the net at a time when a goal seemed unlikely. The young forward profited from a Wesley Lautoa mistake, exploited by Yoann Gourcuff and Henri Bedimo, to apply a low finish past keeper Benjamin Lecomte. Jeannot, who has netted six goals in his last ten Ligue 1 games, was the first in action. Just three minutes into the game, the Lorient forward went through on goal but was denied by a diving Anthony Lopes at the first attempt and Samuel Umtiti on the rebound. Ten minutes later, it was Rafidine Abdullah's turn to give Lyon a fright with a 25-yard screamer that rattled Lopes' crossbar. Lyon had to wait for the 35th minute to get their first chance, but Nabil Fekir's low shot didn't worry Lecomte. Before that, Jeannot was again at the end of a superb collective display from Vincent Le Goff, Walid Mesloud and Raphael Guerreiro. But Umtiti was on hand to deflect the effort. The U23 France defender could only watch minutes later as Jeannot's glancing header flew just wide of the far post. Lorient played with fire after N'Jie's equaliser and can thank keeper Lecomte for a fine save as Christophe Jallet's curled strike looked like it was looping into the top corner with only five minutes remaining on the clock. The draw prevents Lyon from widening the gap at the top of the table, but it allowed Lorient to leapfrog Toulouse to sit 16th with 28 points, two points above the first relegation spot. Earlier, Bordeaux defeated Saint-Etienne 1-0 to help their chances of European football next season. A 42nd minute strike from Diego Rolan, which 'handcuffed' goalkeeper Stephane Ruffier, lifted Willy Sagnol's side level on 40 points with Monaco and one point behind fourth-placed Saint-Etienne. It was Bordeaux's first win at home since December 6, while Saint-Etienne failed to win in the league for the fifth straight outing. ""It's a great success against one of our direct rivals,"" said delighted Bordeaux coach Sagnol. ""We knew the importance of this match and could have been seven points back but now we're only one back which is within our capacities."" Guingamp added to Metz' woes with a 2-0 victory away from home. Goals from Christophe Mandanne and Jeremy Pied helped the Brittany side jump to the 10th place. Metz, who are in search of the first goal in five games, remain bottom of the league."
14,02/12/2014,21:51,Marseille penalised by former striker Ayew,Lorient's Ghana international Jordan Ayew scored a penalty to cancel out Dimitri Payet's opener and salvage a 1-1 draw against his former club Marseille on Tuesday.,"The stalemate left titlechasers Marseille two points clear of champions Paris Saint-Germain who face Lille on Wednesday. In an attempt to end a run of three successive defeats on the road Marseille coach Marcelo Bielsa opted for a five-man defence. Up front, Andre-Pierre Gignac had an off night, missing all his chances, including a lob attempt in the 24th minute. In the 71st minute, he struck the ball at a virtually empty Lorient goalmouth, only for his shot to be aimed at Vincent Le Goff - the only defender guarding the goalline. Marseille were struggling to create much real danger, aside from in the 32nd minute when Payet out-foxed Lorient keeper Benjamin Lecomte to put the south coast visitors in the lead. Marseille's lead lasted a matter of minutes, with Lorient levelling via Marseille's former striker Ayew's penalty awarded after keeper Steve Mandanda's late challenge on Benjamin Jeannot. Bielsa's gamble after the hour mark when he introduced Michy Batshuayi for Abdelaziz Barrada failed to pay off. Marseille finished the last 20 minutes the stronger side, sensing Lorient were flagging. Lorient captain Wesley Lautoa made a game-saving goalline tackle to deny Batshuayi with 10 minutes remaining. Marseille, according to Bielsa, deserved to have come away with all three points. ""The difference between the two sides wasn't reflected in the result, so there's a sense of dissatisfaction,"" said the Argentinian. ""We had enough opportunities but lacked efficiency,"" he added. Also on Tuesday, Toulouse saw off hosts Nantes 2-1, while Monaco welcomed Lens in the late game. Paris Saint-Germain can take over at the Ligue 1 summit on Wednesday with success at Lille, although they will have to do so without their absent star striker Zlatan Ibrahimahic."
15,01/11/2014,19:17,PSG gear change cranks up pressure on Marseille,Unbeaten Paris Saint Germain drew to within a single point of Ligue 1 leaders Marseille on Saturday with a come-from-behind 2-1 away win over Lorient.,"Lorient stunned the champions with Raphael Guerreiro's tight shot opening the scoring on 42 minutes. But Paris came back early in the second-half with goals from Edinson Cavani and substitute Jean-Christophe Bahebeck. Marseille, who lost at Lyon last weekend, have 25 points ahead of their home game with Lens on Sunday and PSG have 24, as these two giants of French football get ready to go head-to-head in Paris next weekend. Paris also maybe had one eye on their Champions League clash with APOEL of Cyprus in midweek, given the pedestrian nature of a sluggish first-half performance. But they were given a rude awakening just before half-time. Lorient came out of defence to launch a blistering break in their orange strip and yellow boots. Andre Ayew took the ball into the box and fed midfielder Raphael Guerreiro, who stunned PSG goalkeeper Salvatore Sirigu with his sudden tight-angled shot to make it 1-0. ""We played badly all over the pitch in the first half. But you saw straight away the difference in the second half, and we got a goal straight away and went in for the win,"" the PSG 'keeper said. And the difference was indeed eye-catching as Paris moved up a gear. A defence splitting pass from Argentine playmaker Javier Pastore set up Cavani's equaliser just after the break, the Uruguayan nimbly hoisting the ball over the onrushing 'keeper before executing his traditional rifle-shot goal celebration. It was his third goal in three starts. Coach Laurent Blanc then made a double substitution bringing on Marco Veratti for the misfiring Yohan Cabaye and Jean-Christophe Bahebeck for a tired looking Ezequiel Lavezzi and it paid immediate dividends. Veratti fed Bahebeck as he ran into space and his shot flew home from a tight angle to send a wave of joy through a relieved Paris side. PSG can now look ahead to next Sunday with confidence.
