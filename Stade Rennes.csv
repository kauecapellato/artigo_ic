0,01/02/2021,14:47,"Messi fuels Barcelona revival, Marseille violence, Poch beaten: Talking points from around Europe","Lionel Messi kept up his improved form in La Liga as Barcelona won again amid more controversy about the Catalans' finances, while there was drama on and off the field in France and the Milan clubs continue to fight it out at the top of Serie A.","AFP Sport rounds up some of the main talking points from across the continent: Barcelona have said they will take legal action against Spanish newspaper El Mundo after it published details at the weekend of Lionel Messi's current contract, which it says is worth up to 555 million euros ($674 million) over four years. El Mundo called it the ""colossal contract that ruins Barcelona"", just as the Catalans are wrestling with a dire financial situation, worsened by the pandemic, and with Messi's future currently up in the air. Yet the Argentine underlined his value to Barca by scoring a superb free-kick in their 2-1 win over Athletic Bilbao. Barca are unbeaten in 10 n La Liga, winning eight, with Messi scoring eight times in that run. However, both Barcelona and Real Madrid are 10 points behind leaders Atletico Madrid, who beat Cadiz 4-2 and still boast a game in hand. Marseille's weekend game against Rennes in Ligue 1 was postponed after angry supporters attacked the club's training ground, while the players were there, in what was called ""a frenzy of unjustifiable violence"". Local police said 25 arrests were made and seven officers were injured after several hundred Ultras stormed La Commanderie in a protest against the club leadership and the team's poor recent run of results. Marseille's owner, the American tycoon Frank McCourt, called the protestors ""thugs"" and likened the incidents to last month's storming of the US Congress. The growing crisis comes with the former Champions League winners having slumped to ninth in Ligue 1 and after coach Andre Villas-Boas indicated he will leave at the end of the season. On the pitch in France, the title race is hotting up after reigning champions Paris Saint-Germain suffered their first defeat under new coach Mauricio Pochettino, conceding at the death to lose 3-2 at struggling Lorient despite Neymar scoring two penalties. It was a fifth defeat in Ligue 1 this season for PSG, who are third, three points behind leaders Lille. Lille beat Dijon 1-0, while Lyon are two points off top spot in second after scoring late to beat Bordeaux 2-1. It could even become a four-way fight. Monaco are six points off the lead after winning their last five games. Bayern Munich maintained their seven-point lead at the top of the German Bundesliga by beating Hoffenheim 4-1 as Robert Lewandowski scored his 24th goal of the league campaign. After a mini slump, the Bavarians have now four on the bounce and remain well clear of nearest rivals RB Leipzig. The result against Hoffenheim also allowed Hansi Flick's side to exact perfect revenge for their 4-1 defeat away to the same opponents in September, in what was their only loss in 46 matches in all competitions across a remarkable 2020. The only cloud on Bayern's weekend came as midfielder Corentin Tolisso was dropped and fined for getting a tattoo, therefore falling foul of Covid-19 quarantine regulations. Zlatan Ibrahimovic's spat with Romelu Lukaku dominated the headlines last midweek as Inter beat AC Milan in their Coppa Italia derby. On Saturday Ibrahimovic missed a penalty for the fourth time this season but Ante Rebic followed up to score and Franck Kessie later netted another spot-kick as Milan won 2-1 at Bologna. That result kept the Rossoneri two points clear of Inter at the top of Serie A, as Antonio Conte's side beat Benevento 4-0 with Lukaku scoring a brace at San Siro. The Belgian is on 14 league goals for the season and Inter remain best-placed to overhaul Milan, even if Roma, Juventus, Lazio and Napoli all also won at the weekend."
1,30/01/2021,22:24,Marseille match postponed after 'savage' fans attack training ground,"Marseille hit out at a ""frenzy of violence"" as their game against Rennes in France's Ligue 1 on Saturday was postponed after hundreds of angry supporters broke into the club's training ground and caused widespread damage in a protest.","The hardcore Ultras, who were demonstrating against the club leadership and the team's poor recent run of results, assembled in the afternoon in front of Marseille's La Commanderie training ground, throwing smoke bombs and firecrackers. ""Several hundred Ultras used force and violence to get into the training ground, including the first team's building,"" the club said in a statement. ""A frenzy of unjustifiable violence put the lives of those present in danger. Thefts were committed and vehicles damaged. Five trees were burnt down...several hundred thousand euros worth of damage was caused."" Local police in France's Bouches-du-Rhone department earlier said 25 arrests were made and seven police officers were injured after ""300 OM supporters violently attacked police officers present to secure La Commanderie"". Sports daily L'Equipe reported that Marseille's Spanish defender Alvaro Gonzalez was struck on the back by a projectile as he went to confront the supporters. ""We are all astonished: staff, coaching staff and players. We were not expecting a savage horde to turn up and destroy everything,"" Marseille president Jacques-Henri Eyraud told Canal Plus. ""I think we avoided an even worse situation. It could have been a tragedy. Everyone is shocked, players and staff. These are not real supporters, they are hooligans, delinquents, people who have no respect for anything."" The French league reacted to the incidents by postponing Marseille's home game against Rennes, scheduled for Saturday evening, ""to a later date"", even though it was due to go ahead behind closed doors due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Marseille were second in Ligue 1 when last season ended early because of the pandemic. However, they have lost their last three league matches and have slid 14 points behind leaders Lyon, albeit with two games in hand. A 2-1 win for Lens at Montpellier on Saturday saw Marseille slip to seventh place. They have won just one of their last nine games in all competitions and are due to visit Lens in midweek before hosting fierce enemies Paris Saint-Germain next weekend. On Friday coach Andre Villas-Boas admitted he expected to leave at the end of the season. ""The place needs a clear-out... I'm responsible for the results and right now they're awful,"" the Portuguese former Porto, Chelsea and Tottenham Hotspur coach said. For several weeks supporters have organised protests before home matches, which are all being played behind closed doors. On Saturday an increased number of banners attacking club leadership, including Eyraud, were hung around the city on motorway bridges, roundabouts and even the Corniche overlooking the Mediterranean Sea. ""Follow AVB, get out of here"", ""Parisians, get out of here"", ""Give us back OM"", read some of them. Eyraud, who was born in Paris, was a frequent target after he angered fans during a conference on management when he talked about the ""danger"" of having too many Marseille residents or club supporters working at the club. ""JHE: No Marseille fans at OM? Get out of here"", said one banner unfurled above a motorway, and ""JHE, Marseille vomits you out"" said another at the Prado roundabout, a few metres from the Stade Velodrome. ol-stt-mdm/fbr/pb/bsp/as/dj"
2,20/12/2020,23:59,Lorient groundsman dies after heat lamp accident,A groundsman working for Lorient died on Sunday after being hit by a falling playing field heat lamp shortly after the Ligue 1 club's 3-0 home defeat to Rennes.,"The mayor of Lorient Fabrice Loher confirmed the news after widespread reports in French media of the death. ""A member of the contracted pitch maintenance team working for the club died after the accidental fall of a heat lamp,"" the city said in a statement. It was Rennes substitutes who raised the alarm as they were still on the pitch when the accident took place. Players and medical staff were seen on television rushing back out to the pitch to help, and were shortly joined by a team of fire fighters. Some remained on the sidelines in shock as rescue workers tried to save the man, reportedly a 38-year-old father of three. He was transported to a local emergency unit but did survive."
3,18/12/2020,17:08,Villas-Boas apologises for threatening journalist,Marseille coach Andre Villas-Boas on Friday gave a limited apology to a journalist from a local newspaper who he threatened and struck after a defeat earlier in the week.,"On Wednesday, after his team lost 2-1 in a Ligue 1 game in Rennes, Villas-Boas approached the journalist from Marseille-based La Provence, gave him ""two unfriendly claps on the shoulder"" and threatened him, according to witnesses. On Thursday, the newspaper published an article headlined: ""When Villas-Boas insults and threatens one of our journalists."" On Friday, the former Tottenham, Chelsea and Zenit St Petersburg coach offered an apology at his press conference. ""I had a reaction that I regret,"" said Villas-Boas. ""The substance of my thought has not changed, but I understand that the way I expressed it provoked your criticism, which is fair. Freedom of expression is one of the most precious human rights. ""I don't have a problem with the press or with criticism, but I had a bad experience with two articles that, for me, attacked my dignity and integrity as a professional and as a person. ""I had a reaction that a person cannot have, I regret it and I am ready to apologise to the journalist."" Marseille struggled again in the Champions League this season and the journalist had written that this continued a career pattern for Villas Boas and that his results in the competition were ""not brilliant"". That had drawn complaints from the Portuguese coach at earlier press conferences, on one occasion lamenting that the writer was not in the room. On Wednesday morning, La Provence published another article on the subject. That evening, Villas-Boas approached the journalist after his brief press conference. ""Thank you. Keep it up, I'll get you,"" he reportedly said after striking the journalist on the shoulder. ""If I'm lucky enough to get you... keep on like this, that's fine."" The dispute continued in the stadium car park. According to another witness, Villas-Boas approached the journalist and ""insulted him in Portuguese"". Ricardo Carvalho, Villas-Boas' deputy, separated the two men."
4,24/11/2020,21:26,Giroud fires Chelsea into Champions League last 16,Chelsea reached the last 16 of the Champions League on Tuesday with two matches to spare after a late Olivier Giroud strike gave the Blues a 2-1 win over Rennes.,"The France forward's powerful header in stoppage time snatched the points for Frank Lampard's side after Serhou Guirassy had levelled Callum Hudson-Odoi's first-half opener. Chelsea were joined in the next round by Group E rivals Sevilla after the Spanish side won 2-1 at Krasnodar. Both sides are on 10 points, nine ahead of third-placed Krasnodar and will now do battle for first place come the end of the group stage. Chelsea can concentrate on domestic duties, with Premier League leaders Tottenham Hotspur visiting Stamford Bridge at the weekend, thanks to out-of-favour Giroud, who has been tipped to leave in January as he seeks more regular football ahead of next summer's European Championship. ""I have a problem because we have Tammy who's playing well... I have two players in a similar position fighting for a place. That's a good problem,"" Lampard told British broadcaster BT Sport. ""Olly (Giroud) will get his minutes because we have a busy schedule, we're playing every few days."" Chelsea started strongly and should have been ahead as early as the seventh minute, when Timo Werner flashed Hudson-Odoi's low cross over the bar with the goal at his mercy. Their early dominance was rewarded in the 22nd minute following superb play from Mason Mount, who won the ball near his own area before spotting the marauding Hudson-Odoi on the right. Mount picked out his fellow Chelsea academy graduate with a long pass. The winger took two touches before slotting past Alfred Gomis. England international Mount was unlucky not to double the away side's lead eight minutes later when Gomis pulled off a superb save to keep out his close-range effort following a Ben Chilwell pull-back. Goalkeeper Edouard Mendy had a quiet start to his return to the club from whom Chelsea signed him in the summer, but the hosts got a foothold in the contest after a rocky opening period. James Lea Siliki shot over in the 32nd minute after the ball rebounded to him off Kurt Zouma. Rennes then began to cause Chelsea some problems. Mendy showed the difference he has made to Chelsea with solid saves from Guirassy and Damien Da Silva towards the end of the opening period. Chelsea thought they had added a second shortly after the break but Werner's header was ruled offside and Rennes continued to pose them problems. Mendy made the save of the night in the 73rd minute when he got his body in the way of a powerful Gerzino Nyamsi header, and then pounced to stop a goal on the rebound. Rennes thought they had punished Chelsea with five minutes remaining when an unmarked Guirassy thumped a header past Mendy. But Giroud pounced less than a minute into stoppage time after Gomis' save from another Werner miss bounced up, allowing the Frenchman to head Chelsea into the last 16."
5,23/11/2020,02:33,Eduardo Camavinga - The rapid rise of France's next superstar,"The landmarks just keep on coming for Eduardo Camavinga of Rennes and France, possibly the most exciting teenage prospect in world football.","Earlier this month he celebrated his 18th birthday and revealed with a cheeky grin that he had passed his driving test the same day ""with flying colours"". In the last 12 months this prodigious talent has become a French citizen -- and turned up at the ceremony in a black suit, bow-tie and white trainers -- before going on to become the national team's youngest representative, and youngest goal-scorer, in over a century. ""What is happening to him is fantastic,"" said Rennes coach Julien Stephan after Camavinga got that first call-up. Throughout his giddy rise to prominence he has been regularly linked with a move to one of Europe's super clubs, most notably Real Madrid. But for now Camavinga is happy to keep developing at Rennes, with whom he will face Chelsea in the Champions League this midweek. Camavinga missed the last meeting of the teams three weeks ago due to injury, and without him the Champions League debutants lost 3-0 at Stamford Bridge after having a man sent off in the first half. With their Angolan-born starlet back, Rennes may just have a chance of causing an upset that would keep them alive a little longer in the competition and, perhaps, help convince him to stick around a little longer in Brittany. Last week French sports daily L'Equipe reported Camavinga was close to extending his contract at Roazhon Park until 2023. It is unlikely he will stay at Rennes that long, but by penning the deal he will guarantee an even bigger windfall when the time does come to move on. He is a simply mind-blowing talent, always playing with his head up, graceful on the ball and at ease on his left foot. He glides across the pitch and the signs are that he is starting to become a goal-scoring threat too. In August he conjured a fabulous, and decisive, goal for Rennes in a Ligue 1 game against Montpellier. Last month he found the net nine minutes into his first start for France, against Ukraine. In doing so, Camavinga became the youngest player to score for Les Bleus since Maurice Gastiger, who was 17 years and five months old, in 1914. Asked last week what aspects of his game he wanted to improve, he responded: ""My finishing. I want to score more, be more decisive. And my right foot."" Nevertheless, he is almost making Kylian Mbappe, a comparative veteran at 21, old news in a country where the conveyor belt of young talent is seemingly never-ending. ""He is young, but it's like Kylian, their age doesn't matter. I'd lump the two of them together. There is a serenity and maturity about them that I didn't have at that age,"" said Paul Pogba recently. ""The future is in his hands."" Camavinga's story would be remarkable enough even without the football career. Born in a refugee camp in the Angolan exclave of Cabinda, he was two when he arrived in France with his family. Their first port of call was the northern city of Lille, before they moved to Fougeres, a town in Brittany not far from Rennes. One of six children, Eduardo wanted to do judo like his big brother, but it soon became apparent he had extraordinary ability with a football. In 2013 the family home was destroyed in a fire, in which the Camavingas lost all proof of their identity. But that is the year Eduardo joined Rennes, and by the time the family posed at their naturalisation ceremony he had been a professional for a year. As he grows up, Camavinga knows the expectations on him will become greater, but he is keeping his feet on the ground. ""I have my parents close by, so I know that as soon as I do something foolish they will bring back me into line,"" he said last week. ""But I need to concentrate on my football. I am not going to become big-headed."""
6,08/11/2020,13:41,Di Maria brace in Rennes stroll keeps depleted PSG top,Angel Di Maria scored twice as Paris Saint-Germain made short work of Rennes despite a raft of absences in a 3-0 win on Saturday that enables the champions to hold onto their lead at the top of Ligue 1.,"Di Maria struck in each half, with Moise Kean scoring the other, to move PSG up to 24 points, five ahead of second-placed Lille who take on Brest in Sunday's early fixture. Rennes stay third on 18 points -- but can be overtaken by Nice should they beat Monaco on Sunday -- while Montpellier are a further point back in sixth after their 2-0 win at Bordeaux. PSG's win was their eighth in a row in the French top flight and came as under-fire coach Thomas Tuchel battles with an injury crisis that has left him without the likes of Neymar, Kylian Mbappe and Marco Verratti. Marquinhos was moved back into the defence following injury to centre-back Presnel Kimpembe, while Pablo Sarabia failed to overcome a muscle strain. However new arrival Kean put the hosts ahead after 10 minutes with his third Ligue 1 goal of the season when he collected Di Maria's pass and lashed a low shot past Alfred Gomis. Di Maria then added the second 10 minutes later when fellow Argentine Leandro Paredes picked him out with a fine through ball and he dinked his finish over Gomis. PSG suffered what looked to be more injury strife when Thilo Kehrer left the field 10 minutes before the end of the first half, before Kean then began limping on the hour mark before being substituted shortly afterwards. The result was never really in doubt however, and Di Maria made absolutely sure of the points in the 73rd minute when his low drive squirmed past the unfortunate Gomis. A thumping win over Rennes is unlikely to improve Tuchel's precarious position at PSG though as last season's Champions League finalists struggle in this year's edition. The 47-year-old German, whose contract is up at the end of this season, is in a sticky position after PSG lost 2-1 at RB Leipzig on Wednesday to leave them with two defeats out of three in the competition's group stage. It has become an open secret that Tuchel does not get on with Leonardo, PSG's powerful sporting director, who did not hire the German and wants to bring in his own man."
7,23/10/2020,23:02,Rennes lose to Angers as fans try to beat curfew record,"Rennes sent 5,000 fans racing home to beat a curfew on Friday ruing another wasted lead after their team lost 2-1 at home to Angers in Ligue 1.","A spike in Covid-19 cases in the region brought the introduction of a curfew from midnight on Friday. That gave fans barely an hour to get home after the match or risk a 135-euro ($160) fine. Rennes could have moved to the top of Ligue 1 with a victory, instead, they suffered their first defeat of the season as, for the fourth time in four games, they blew a lead. This time they did not even gain a draw. The home team started well. After 18 minutes, Paul Bernadoni, Angers record signing, failed to hold a tame volley from Flavien Tait. Adrien Hunou pounced on the loose ball to slide it in from close range. Angers quickly hit back. In the 27th minute, former Southampton player Sofiane Boufal's shot from the edge of the box took a small deflection off Steven Nzonzi and a bigger one off Damien Da Silva before flying past Alfred Gomis. In the 57th minute, Angelo Fulgini chasing a long punt forward wriggled past Da Siva and stretched out a toe to lob the ball over Gomis to give Angers the lead. Almost at once, Gomis atoned with a spectacular save from a point-blank Boufal header. The victory lifted Angers into the top six. ""For us, it's an exploit,"" said Angers coach Stephane Moulin adding that the Champions League had taken a toll on Rennes. ""They used a lot of energy on Tuesday evening."" Angers had conceded 10 goals over their last two away games. ""We had to close the floodgates and I liked the way we did it,"" said Moulin Rennes manager Julien Stephan made five changes to the starting lineup from the club's Champions League debut against Krasnodar on Tuesday when they squandered a lead and drew 1-1 at home. ""I'm disappointed with our match, with the two faces we showed,"" said Stephan. ""We know it's difficult to play every three days but we fought like hell last season to get the chance to play these matches one after the other."" In that European match, the Rennes ultras, many without masks, had grouped behind the goal and celebrated together when their team took the lead. On Friday, UEFA announced it had opened a disciplinary investigation against Rennes for violating its health protocol and failing to ""maintain social distancing"". For the game against Angers, the club again allowed 5,000 spectators to attend, insisting it would enforce stricter distancing rules and enforce a four-seat gap between them. ""We asked them to distribute these 5,000 spectators in the four stands"", said the prefect of Brittany, Michele Kirry. As they watched their team lose to Angers, the fans were carefully spaced around the stadium, which might have also made it easier for them to rush for the exits at the final whistle as the match ended just over an hour before the curfew started. ""The curfew order only comes into force at midnight tonight,"" said Kirry. ""It's very complicated to cancel things on the day they are scheduled."""
8,23/10/2020,03:50,French clubs seek solace amid poor Champions League form and Mediapro dispute,"Just two months after Paris Saint-Germain's run to the final of the Champions League in Lisbon, and Lyon's appearance in the semi-finals, a miserable midweek for Ligue 1 clubs in Europe's elite competition offered no relief at a time when French football is in crisis off the field.","PSG lost 2-1 at home to Manchester United after Marcus Rashford popped up with a late winner for the visitors, and Marseille conceded even later to lose 1-0 at Olympiakos. It was left to Rennes to salvage some pride, but a 1-1 draw with Russian novices Krasnodar still leaves them up against it. On the pitch, Ligue 1 remains the poor relation among Europe's ""Big Five"" leagues, and the outlook is not being helped by the economic crisis and a worrying dispute with the game's chief domestic TV rights holder. Chinese-owned Spanish firm Mediapro did not meet a scheduled 172 million-euro ($203m) payment due this month and is now trying to renegotiate the record deal it agreed for four seasons starting this year, citing the economic downturn caused by the coronavirus pandemic. Mediapro won the rights after agreeing to pay over 800 million euros per season, out of a total deal worth a record 1.15 billion euros annually. Clubs now face an uncertain future, just as they are being starved of gate revenue due to restrictions on gatherings as a result of the pandemic. The French league (LFP) has taken out a loan of 112 million euros to tide over clubs in the short term, but it is unclear what happens next with Mediapro CEO Jaume Roures saying the company intends to honour the full term of their deal while also indicating the next scheduled payment may not be forthcoming either. ""If there were no TV rights it would be catastrophic for everyone,"" admitted Montpellier president Laurent Nicollin. Meanwhile, interested observers elsewhere believe French clubs will have no choice but to renegotiate the deal. ""There was no pandemic when Mediapro offered the money they did. Nobody knew there was going to be a pandemic and that all the bars would close, that the season would start later than planned,"" LaLiga president Javier Tebas told AFP. ""The conditions were no longer the same so this is all normal. We have also negotiated with many operators."" The France superstar endured a difficult night in PSG's loss to Manchester United and has now gone six games without scoring in the Champions League. It is a worrying run for a player who had previously been so prolific both with his current club and Monaco, and it is notable that Rashford has now scored as many Champions League goals in Paris since the start of 2018/19 as Mbappe. Perhaps he was tired after starting twice and playing another 45 minutes as a substitute for France during the recent international break, and it will be interesting to see if PSG coach Thomas Tuchel starts him on Saturday against Dijon or gives him a rest ahead of the Champions League trip to Istanbul Basaksehir. 1 - France's three representatives collected a solitary point between them in the Champions League in midweek. 24 - PSG have scored 24 goals without reply in their six previous home meetings with Dijon in league and cup. They notably won 8-0 in January 2018. 6 - Lille went top of Ligue 1 last weekend for the first time in six years. They have their best record seven games into a season since 1952."
9,09/09/2020,17:50,"Mendy talks with Chelsea 'have started', say Rennes","Rennes admitted on Wednesday that they were in talks with Chelsea over the transfer of Edouard Mendy, as the Premier League club look to continue their summer spending spree by bagging the Senegal goalkeeper.","Frank Lampard's Blues have already splashed out almost £200 million (220.2 million euros) in the close season signing Timo Werner, Kai Havertz, Hakim Ziyech and Ben Chilwell, and are looking for a new stopper after disappointing displays from Kepa Arrizabalaga. ""Talks have begun, but we're still in the discussion phase, there is no agreement for now, far from it,"" Rennes president Nicolas Holveck told reporters during the unveiling of forward Serhou Guirassy, signed from Amiens. France-born Mendy, 28, arrived at Rennes last summer and was a key man in the team that finished third in Ligue 1 last season and qualified for the group stages of the Champions League for the first time in their history. The move to Chelsea would be another step forward for a player who worked his way up the ranks of French football before finally arriving in the top flight with Reims in 2018, at the age of 26. ""I can understand Edouard's desires, he's spoken to us about it. But he's not exactly at the worst club in Europe,"" added Holveck. ""For now he's with Rennes and is very much part of our club."""
10,29/08/2020,23:11,Camavinga on the mark as Rennes collect first win,Rennes teenager Eduardo Camavinga celebrated his first France call-up with a terrific solo goal in Saturday's 2-1 victory at home to Montpellier in Ligue 1.,"Camavinga, 17, was included this week in Didier Deschamps' squad for Nations League games against Sweden and Croatia next month as a replacement for Paul Pogba who has tested positive for Covid-19. Julien Stephan's side will compete in the Champions League for the first time this season, and Angolan-born Camavinga has reiterated his commitment to the club despite reported interest from Real Madrid. Damien Le Tallec inadvertently gave Rennes the lead when he flicked Raphinha's cross into his own net on 22 minutes, with the visitors reduced to 10 men before half-time as Florent Mollet was dismissed after catching the head of Faitout Maouassa with his studs. Rennes hit the woodwork three times at Roazhon Park, twice through Adrien Hunou and again when Raphinha crashed a curling free-kick against the bar on the hour, with Montpellier's Arnaud Souquet hitting the upright at the other end. The hosts saw Martin Terrier sent off with 15 minutes left for a late tackle on Gaetan Laborde but Camavinga soon added a second, effortlessly gliding into the area and shaking free of his defender with a wonderful shimmy before driving low into the far corner. The masked Laborde, sporting protective headgear after breaking his nose in midweek, grabbed a consolation in stoppage time with a superb diving header but it could not deny Rennes a first win of the season. ""It's a well deserved victory but far too tight given the number of chances we had. The game should have been over at half-time,"" said Stephan. Patrick Vieira's Nice made it two wins from as many matches as Denmark international Kasper Dolberg netted both goals in a 2-0 victory at Strasbourg. Dolberg scored from the spot after a clumsy foul by Lamine Kone in the first half and then struck again on 59 minutes after latching onto Amine Gouiri's deflected ball through. Lyon beat Dijon 4-1 in their first game of the campaign on Friday, while Marseille are due to visit Brest on Sunday after their planned opener against Saint-Etienne last week was postponed after several players tested positive for coronavirus. Title holders Paris Saint-Germain's game at Lens initially scheduled for Saturday has been pushed back to September 10 following their run to Champions League final in Lisbon."
11,21/08/2020,22:49,"'I'll stay at Rennes,' says teen star Camavinga despite Real Madrid interest",Rennes teenager Eduardo Camavinga said on Friday he will remain with the French club despite reported interest from Real Madrid.,"The Angolan-born 17-year-old has a deal until 2022 with the Breton outfit who will be in the Champions League for the first time next season. ""To put it simply, I'm Rennes through and through. I have years left on my contract and I'm happy to be at Rennes. I will be at Rennes for this season,"" he told broadcaster Telefoot. Camavinga, who made his France U21 debut last November after receiving citizenship in the country where he moved to aged two years old, remained calm-headed despite being linked with Madrid in the Spanish press. ""It has no effect on my at all, it's football, you have to be ready for it,"" he said. ""In football, you have some that are true and some that are false, you can't pay attention to them,"" he added. The summer transfer window for Spain's La Liga and most European leagues has been extended to October 5 due to the coroanvirus pandemic."

Rennes left-back Faitout Maouassa struck the opener inside 10 minutes at Roazhon Park and Adrien Hunou doubled the lead for Rennes, whose French Cup title defence was ended Thursday by a 2-1 loss to Saint-Etienne. Flavien Tait added a third for Rennes on 68 minutes before Romain Del Castillo converted a penalty. Hunou grabbed his second of the match from the spot late on to complete the rout. Lille edged out in-form Lyon thanks to a first-half goal from Loic Remy. The former Chelsea and Newcastle striker has now scored 11 goals in his last 18 appearances, having scored only three goals before that this season. ""We will continue our journey, our path,"" said Lille coach Christophe Galtier. ""It (the last part of the season) is a sprint and every match is going to be a fight."" Paris Saint-Germain's game at Strasbourg on Saturday was postponed due to fears over the coronavirus outbreak. The decision was made after a number of people tested positive for COVID-19 in the Haut-Rhin region, which neighbours the Bas-Rhin region where Strasbourg is located. It was the first Ligue 1 match to be called off because of the virus, which has infected 1,126 people in France and caused 19 deaths."

His pace and trickery unsettled Liverpool and he was rewarded with two goals before setting up Troy Deeney for the third. ISMAILA SARR (Watford) The Hornets' record signing was up against his idol Mane and stabbed home the opener at the near post and then showed his pace and poise to chip Alisson Becker for Watford's second. Sarr then turned provider for the third as he teed up Deeney to complete a famous win that lifted Watford out of the bottom three. JORDAN AYEW (Crystal Palace) Ayew scored the only goal as Palace got the better of rivals Brighton to ease any fear of being dragged into a relegation battle. The Ghanaian's strike took his league tally for the season to seven -- matching his best tally for a single campaign in England. MBWANA SAMATTA (Aston Villa) Samatta did Tanzania proud by scoring in the League Cup final against Manchester City, but his diving header at the near post just before half-time was merely a consolation for Villa as City won 2-1 to lift the trophy for a third straight season. YOUSSEF EN-NESYRI (Sevilla) En-Nesyri scored a 93rd-minute winner as Sevilla beat Osasuna 3-2 to move up to third in La Liga. The Moroccan striker, who joined Sevilla from Leganes in January, opened the scoring with a guided shot into the corner before Lucas Ocampos made it two on the stroke of half-time. Osasuna came back in the second half through goals from Aridane and Roberto Torres, only for En-Nesyri to snatch victory for Sevilla in injury-time with a close-range finish. RAMY BENSEBAINI (Borussia Moenchengladbach) Algerian Bensebaini scored a crucial early goal for Moenchengladbach as they beat Augsburg 3-2 to keep pace with the top of the Bundesliga table. Bensebaini, in his first start in 2020 after returning from injury, headed home a cross from Lars Stindl to put the visitors 1-0 up. When asked how it felt to be back in the Foals' line-up after the match, he simply replied ""it was fun"". ACHRAF HAKIMI (Borussia Dortmund) Having made his name as one of Dortmund's best going forward this season, the Real Madrid loanee was called on to do more than his fair share of defending against a stubborn Freiburg side. Working on the edge of a four-man midfield, Hakimi's pace was valuable during the 1-0 win as he snuffed out several Freiburg counter attacks. He did have a shot on goal deflected in the dying stages but was unable to add to his tally of two Bundesliga goals this season. STEPHANE BAHOKEN (Angers) The Cameroon striker was rewarded with a start for his team at Brest after coming off the bench against Montpellier last weekend and scoring the winner a minute later. He delivered again in Brest, although he needed a full 43 minutes to bag the only goal of the match this time. MAX-ALAIN GRADEL (Toulouse) Ivory Coast winger Gradel, 32, returned to the Toulouse starting line-up last weekend for the first time in a Ligue 1 game since early December following injury. He kept his place and wore the captain's armband but could not prevent the division's bottom side from going down 2-0 at home to Rennes. They have now taken just a single point from their last 17 league games and are heading fast towards relegation. KARL TOKO-EKAMBI (Lyon) Cameroon forward Toko-Ekambi, who joined Lyon on loan from Villarreal in January, came off the bench and contributed to their 2-0 win over derby rivals Saint-Etienne. Having earlier had a goal disallowed for offside, he won the late penalty which Moussa Dembele scored to seal the victory. Toko-Ekambi had started the 1-0 Champions League last-16, first leg win over Juventus in midweek and hit the bar in the first half against the Italians."
14,23/02/2020,19:03,Late Niang winner fires Rennes back into third,"M'Baye Niang scored a double, including an 89th-minute winner, as Rennes edged out Nimes 2-1 on Sunday to retake third place from Lille in Ligue 1.","Senegal international Niang helped Julien Stephan's side recover from a goal down and end a three-match winless streak in the league, while snapping lowly Nimes' four-match winning run. Rennes are now one point clear of last season's runners-up Lille, who beat rock-bottom Toulouse 3-0 on Saturday, in the race for the third and final Champions League spot. Marseille sit second, eight points ahead of Rennes but 10 points adrift of runaway leaders Paris Saint-Germain, who host Bordeaux later on Saturday. Nimes, whose strong recent run has given them fresh hope of avoiding relegation, grabbed the lead inside the first minute when Nolan Roux picked out the top corner. Niang levelled just six minutes later, diverting in a loose ball inside the box. Nimes centre-back Anthony Briancon was sent off early in the second half to leave the visitors down to 10 men, and Rennes eventually took advantage. Niang was left unmarked to nod home his 10th league goal of the campaign."
15,11/02/2020,23:51,Rennes end plucky Belfort's French Cup run in last eight,The magical run by minnows Belfort in the French Cup came to an end at the quarter-final stage on Tuesday after a 3-0 home defeat to holders Rennes.,"The fourth division side were applauded off the pitch at a packed Stade Auguste Bonal, the home of Ligue 2 side Sochaux, after a thrilling cup run which saw them knock out Champions League-chasing Montpellier in the previous round. Rennes are third in Ligue 1 and hoping to qualify for Europe's top competition next season, but that didn't stop Belfort from pushing them all the way -- so much so that Rennes players gave their amateur opponents a guard of honour at the end of the match. ""We have no regrets,"" said Belfort coach Anthony Hacquard. ""We're truly amateur so we're just proud to have been there. To see all these people coming to the stadium makes us proud."" A first half strike by Raphinha, an M'Baye Niang spot kick 16 minutes from the end and Jordan Siebatcheu's counter-attack finish in stoppage time did for Belfort. The score would however have been bigger had Belfort goalkeeper Eddy Ehlinger not pulled off some magnificent saves in the second half. Just 18 years old and already a penalty shoot-out hero against Montpellier, Ehlinger kept the deficit at one goal midway through the second half with two magnificent one-on-one saves from Adrien Hunou and Niang, but could do nothing to stop Rennes making it two from the subsequent corner. Yannick Konki got his hand to a shot, allowing Senegal international Niang to make amends from the spot for his miss seconds earlier and ensured Rennes moves on to the semis. Belfort continued to push for a goal as the enthusiastic home crowd cheered them on, but Rennes threatened on the break and Ehlinger denied Hunou again with 10 minutes left with a superb stop from point-blank range. However Siebatcheu made the scoreline more flattering for Rennes a minute into added time, meeting Raphinha's low pass with a calm finish. Epinal, another fourth-tier team who saw off Lille in the last 16, have the chance to take amateur football to the semis when they host Saint-Etienne on Thursday. Wednesday sees two all-Ligue 1 encounters, who Dijon awaiting the visit of Paris Saint-Germain and Lyon coach Rudi Garcia facing his old team Marseille in the other last eight tie."
16,04/02/2020,21:46,Rennes fail to take second place with Lille defeat,Rennes missed the chance to go second in Ligue 1 on Tuesday after Loic Remy's early goal consigned them to a 1-0 defeat at Champions League-chasing Lille.,"Remy struck in the fourth minute for the hosts when he collected Jonathan Ikone's pass before lashing home a long-range effort to move his fourth-placed side up to 37 points, three behind Rennes. The away side remain a further three points away from Marseille, who travel to Saint-Etienne on Wednesday and would have been temporarily overtaken by Rennes had they won by two goals or more. Monaco meanwhile won their first league match of 2020 1-0 over Angers thanks to Stevan Jovetic, who guided in Youssouf Fofana's long pass with his head to move Robert Moreno's side ninth, level on 32 points with four other teams. The victory ends a four-match winless run in the league for Monaco that was made worse by last week's French Cup exit at the hands of Saint-Etienne last week. Later Paris Saint-Germain look to extend their 12-point lead at the top of Ligue 1 with Neymar out with a rib complaint and Kylian Mbappe starting following his touchline spat with coach Thomas Tuchel at the weekend."
17,31/01/2020,21:45,Rennes sign world champion Nzonzi for European push,"Rennes, a surprising third in French Ligue 1, invested in their Champions League push when they took World Cup winner Steven Nzonzi on loan from Roma on Friday.","The 31-year-old midfielder came on as a substitute for the last 35 minutes when France beat Croatia in the 2018 World Cup final Nzonzi started at Amiens but has never played in Ligue 1. He moved to Blackburn at the age of 20 and then moved on to Stoke and Sevilla where he won the Europa League in 2016. He joined Rome for 30 million euros in 2018. Roma loaned Nzonzi to Galatasaray at the start of this season. He played nine league games before the Istanbul club suspended him in December for ""inappropriate behaviour"" in training. On Friday afternoon they announced they were terminating Nzonzi's contract shortly before Rennes introduced the player to fans before the kick off of their derby game against Nantes. Rennes signed Nzonzi until the end of June with an option for an additional year. According to media reports, the move to Rennes almost stalled over Nzonzi's salary. At Roma he was on an estimated at 3.3 million euros until the end of the season. With Rennes third in the Ligue 1 and still in the French Cup, coach Julien Stephan had pleaded to bring in an experienced midfielder to make up for the absence of several injured players. Stephan is the son of Guy Stephan the assistant coach on the France team."
18,10/01/2020,23:04,Strootman fires Marseille within four points of PSG,Kevin Strootman scored a late winner as Marseille edged out high-flying Rennes 1-0 on Friday to move within four points of Ligue 1 leaders Paris Saint-Germain.,"Andre Villas-Boas' men clinched victory in a tight encounter when Dutch midfielder Strootman volleyed into an empty net after Dimitri Payet's 84th-minute free-kick hit the post. The visitors stretch their unbeaten run to nine games and moved eight points clear of the Bretons with the win. ""A draw might have been fairer for a match like that,"" Villas-Boas said. ""It's a very good result for us as we move away from our opponents in the table."" Reigning champions PSG have two games in hand on Marseille and face Robert Moreno's Monaco on Sunday and again three days later in a rescheduled match. Marseille are bidding for a first French title since 2010 and underlined their credentials as PSG's closest challengers by ending third-placed Rennes' five-game winning streak. Visiting goalkeeper Steve Mandanda only had to make one difficult save to deny Benjamin Bourigeaud just before half-time at Roazhon Park, after Alvaro had struck the woodwork for Marseille. On Saturday, struggling Lyon visit Bordeaux, while Lille have the chance to leapfrog Rennes and move into the Champions League places when they face Dijon on Sunday."
19,15/12/2019,20:56,Depay's Euro 2020 at risk after potential cruciate ligament tear,Memphis Depay's bid to play for the Netherlands in Euro 2020 could be in doubt after Lyon coach Rudi Garcia revealed he may have torn the cruciate ligaments in his left knee during Sunday's 1-0 Ligue 1 defeat to Rennes.,"Depay was hurt in a clash with Hamari Traore in the 29th minute but was only substituted at half-time and Garcia feared the worst for his star attacker, who has scored eight times in his last eight matches in all competitions for Lyon, including the goal that took them to the last 16 of the Champions League. ""We will wait to know more but it really doesn't look good for Memphis. We think it's the cruciate (ligaments),"" Garcia said after a defeat which keeps his side eighth in Ligue 1. ""I hope we get news contrary to what we think in the hope that it is not too serious."" Depay has been a key player for a revitalised Dutch team, scoring eight times and making eight assists as the Oranje qualified for their first major tournament since finishing third at the 2014 World Cup. However, should the injury be confirmed, he faces months on the sidelines and no guarantee of being fit for next summer's Euros. Lyon failed to follow up on the dramatic 2-2 draw with RB Leipzig that took them to the next round of the Champions League as they were booed off following their dismal defeat to Rennes, who moved into the European places with the win. Youngster Eduardo Camavinga shot Rennes into fourth place with a late strike that gave Rennes their fourth league win in a row. The 17-year-old's first ever Ligue 1 goal in his debut season in the French top flight moved his side to 30 points in the Europa League spot, just one point away from the Champions League places. The game looked to be heading for a goalless draw when Rennes goalkeeper Edouard Mendy pulled off a sensational double save with six minutes left to deny Maxence Caqueret and Bertrand Traore. However, Camavinga stunned the home fans after 89 minutes when he collected Romain Del Castillo's pass and slalomed past Rafael and Joachim Andersen before squeezing his shot past Anthony Lopes."

22,20/10/2019,20:57,Ben Yedder strikes late to give Monaco win over Rennes,Wissam Ben Yedder fired Monaco out of the Ligue 1 mire on Sunday with a stoppage time winner that earned an entertaining 3-2 win over Rennes.,"Yedder pounced on Keita Balde's flick two minutes into added time to lash home a powerful left-foot finish and send Leonardo Jardim's side up to 14th just as it looked as if a handball spotted by VAR had denied them the three points. Balde thought he had won the game for Monaco seconds before when he capitalised on a dreadful error by Rennes goalkeeper Romain Salin to roll the ball into an empty net, only for the video assistants to spot him controlling the ball with his hand. The last-gasp winner was Ben Yedder's eighth goal in as many league matches, putting him top of the Ligue 1 scoring charts and making fans forget Radamel Falcao's departure to Galatasaray. ""I'm very happy, it wasn't an easy match. We scored in the last seconds and it was a very good goal, so I'm very happy,"" said Ben Yedder. Monaco started the weekend in 16th but dropped into the relegation playoff places before Sunday's match. It seemed they would stay there once Balde's goal was rightly ruled out. The late goal means they are now level on 12 points with Toulouse, Amiens and 12th-placed Rennes, who have not won a match since August. Monaco had taken the lead through Ben Yedder's smart finish after just two minutes. However, a wonderful solo run and finish from Faitout Maouassa and Adrien Honou's tap-in put Rennes ahead just after the break. Monaco levelled after the away side gifted the ball to Cesc Fabregas. The Spaniard rolled in Islam Slimani to score in the 57th minute. ""We came back to 2-2 when we could have lost, and that's good. It was hard work but often those matches are what do you good,"" added Ben Yedder. Earlier, Claude Puel continued his perfect start as Saint-Etienne coach. Denis Bouanga's stoppage time penalty at Bordeaux launched Puel's side into the top half of the table. The 10-time French champions were second-bottom in Ligue 1 after their home loss to Metz late last month but have won three straight, the last two under Puel. Their turnaround in form, which includes victory over local rivals Lyon in Puel's first match, has moved them to ninth, ahead of 10th-placed Marseille's clash with Strasbourg. Bordeaux meanwhile missed the chance to move into the Champions League positions with their second home loss on the bounce."

24,16/10/2019,10:58,Lazio hit with stand closure for Celtic game over 'racist behaviour',"Italian club Lazio have been hit with a partial stadium closure for their next Europa League home match against Celtic for ""racist behaviour"" by fans against Rennes, UEFA confirmed on Wednesday.","The Roman side have been ordered to close four sections of the Stadio Olimpico which make up the Curva Nord (North Stand) for the game against the Scottish champions on November 7. Lazio had been charged after some of their supporters made fascist salutes in the Curva Nord section during the 2-1 home win over French club Rennes on October 3. Lazio have also been fined 20,000 euros ($22,000) by European football's governing body which has called for football to launch a war on racism. A suspended sentence of playing one match behind closed doors was also handed down while Lazio must display a banner with the wording #EqualGame, with the UEFA logo on it. On Tuesday UEFA president Aleksander Ceferin said football needed to 'wage war' on racism, after Bulgaria's football union chief resigned following racist incidents at England's Euro 2020 qualifier against Bulgaria in Sofia the previous day. Lazio released a statement prior to the announcement protesting the ""deeply damaging"" ruling. ""The decisions constitute a heavy penalty that seems not to have taken into account the clear condemnation from the Biancocelesti club against the odious racist behaviour of a few irresponsible people,"" the club said. The statement added that the club ""reaffirms its intention to prosecute criminally and civilly those responsible for unacceptable behaviour""."
25,07/10/2019,00:16,Late goal earns Saint-Etienne derby win over Lyon on Puel debut,Robert Beric scored a last-minute winner as Saint-Etienne defeated bitter rivals Lyon 1-0 on Sunday and new coach Claude Puel made a triumphant start in his first match in charge.,"Former Leicester City and Southampton boss Puel replaced Ghislain Printant on Friday after signing a three-year deal with the club that entered the derby clash bottom of Ligue 1. ""To produce such a display against Lyon is great, especially in such a short amount of time,"" said Puel, who also spent three years at Lyon from 2008-2011. ""This victory shows the players the sacrifice and desire they need to put into a match. I'm building something here and this fine start must be backed up."" Lyon began the weekend in trouble of their own, languishing a disappointing 11th after a domestic six-match winless run but buoyed by a Champions League victory at RB Leipzig. Anthony Lopes tipped a Riyad Boudebouz effort onto the post in a cagey first half at the Stade Geoffroy-Guichard, and the Lyon goalkeeper made another top reflex save to deny Denis Bouanga on the hour. Moussa Dembele came off the bench for Lyon and forced Jessy Moulin to palm away his header on 85 minutes, with Houssem Aouar then trickling an effort wide after sneaking in behind the hosts' defence. Beric won it at the death though as he rose superbly to head a Boudebouz cross beyond the reach of Lopes to send Saint-Etienne up to 13th and two points above Lyon. ""I'm very worried by our results,"" said Lyon coach Sylvinho. ""We're losing all our matches in the same way. It's not up to me to say if I'm the man for the situation. ""I feel the same as I did after (the 2-2 draws with) Amiens and Brest,"" he added. ""We've conceded again at the end of the match. It's even more frustrating in a derby."" In-form Victor Osimhen's seventh league goal of the season wasn't enough for Lille as they missed the chance to go third after drawing 2-2 with Nimes. Nigeria international Osimhen, 20, who also scored in Lille's 2-1 Champions League defeat to Chelsea midweek, struck the hosts' leveller with 11 minutes remaining after a Renaud Ripart penalty at the end of the first half and Kevin Denkey's neat 70th-minute finish had cancelled out Loic Remy's 13th-minute opener. A win for Lille would have moved them above surprise package Angers following their 4-0 hammering at the hands of league leaders Paris Saint-Germain on Saturday. Instead Christophe Galtier's side stay in fifth on 15 points from nine matches, but they could have easily lost against a spirited Nimes side that belied their pre-match league position of 17th. The lively Romain Philippoteaux, who won the spot-kick that Ripart calmly slotted home, came close to scoring a wonderful individual strike when his finish clipped the outside of the post following an exciting dribble. Reims moved into sixth, a point behind Lille after Boulaye Dia's strike three minutes after half-time consigned former high-fliers Rennes to the latest defeat in a miserable run of form. Level with PSG at the top of the league at the end of August, Julien Stephan's Rennes haven't won in the eight games in any competition since and have plummeted down to 10th. Reims meanwhile consolidated a fine start to the season that sees them with the league's best defensive record alongside PSG, with just four goals conceded in nine games."
26,03/10/2019,23:36,Martinelli stars for Arsenal in Europa League as Man Utd toil,"Arsenal teenager Gabriel Martinelli scored twice to spark a 4-0 rout of Standard Liege in the Europa League group stage on Thursday, while Manchester United stuttered to a goalless draw against AZ Alkmaar.","Martinelli, 18, headed in superbly to give last year's runners-up Arsenal the lead on 14 minutes at the Emirates Stadium before adding a quick-fire second barely two minutes later. The Brazilian was making just his second start for the Gunners since joining the club in July. He also struck twice on his full debut against Nottingham Forest in the League Cup. Joe Willock fired in a third for a youthful Arsenal on 22 minutes and Martinelli set up Dani Ceballos on the hour to wrap up another comfortable win in Europe as Unai Emery's side moved on to six points at the top of Group F. ""The team had a great performance. It's a very important win for us,"" defender Hector Bellerin told BT Sport, praising the dedication shown by Martinelli. ""He keeps his head down, he works really hard, he is doing what the coach wants him to do and it shows on the pitch. Everyone is really pleased for him."" Arsenal are three points clear of both Standard and Eintracht Frankfurt, who beat Vitoria Guimaraes 1-0 in Portugal. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's United again struggled in attack and failed to muster a single shot on target with the club still searching for a first away win since March. United are winless in 10 games away from home -- a run that has seen them score just five times. ""The conditions were tough but I thought we did very well. It puts us in a good position,"" said Solskjaer. ""If you get your draws away from home and win the home games, you'll be fine."" Academy product Brandon Williams was handed his first start for United, who saw teenager Mason Greenwood denied by a superb block from Ron Vlaar on 30 minutes. The game was played in The Hague, on an artificial surface described as ""one of the worst"" by Solskjaer, after a storm damaged Alkmaar's home ground in August. United rarely threatened with substitute Jesse Lingard firing wide although Solskjaer reacted in disbelief when Marcus Rashford appeared to be chopped down in the penalty area. ""It's a penalty 101 times out of 100,"" said the Norwegian. Owen Wijndal and Oussama Idrissi forced David de Gea into a couple of smart saves late on as the draw left United level on four points in Group L with Partizan Belgrade, who won 2-1 away to Astana. Steven Gerrard's Rangers conceded an injury-time goal in a 2-1 loss at Swiss side Young Boys. Colombian forward Alfredo Morelos put Rangers ahead just before half-time, but Young Boys levelled through Roger Assale and Christian Fassnacht grabbed a 93rd-minute winner. Feyenoord claimed a 2-0 home victory over Porto in a clash of former European champions in the other match in Group G. Celtic gained a degree of revenge on CFR Cluj, the Romanians who ousted them in the third qualifying round of the Champions League, as Odsonne Edouard and Mohamed Elyounoussi scored in a 2-0 win in Glasgow. Wolves, in their first European campaign since 1980, rebounded from an opening loss to Braga as Willy Boly's stoppage-time goal earned them a 1-0 win at Besiktas. ""It's huge for us. We don't want to make up the numbers, we want to compete to win,"" said Wolves captain Conor Coady. Espanyol forward Wu Lei became the first Chinese man to score in a major European competition as his side beat CSKA Moscow 2-0. Austrian debutants Wolfsberg drew 1-1 at home to Roma in Group J, while Javier Hernandez grabbed the only goal as five-time champions Sevilla overcame APOEL of Cyprus. Azerbaijani club Qarabag beat Dudelange 4-1 in a game that was interrupted in the first half when a drone carrying a flag from the disputed separatist region of Nagorno-Karabakh flew over the pitch in Luxembourg. PSV Eindhoven defeated Rosenborg 4-1, while Lazio came from behind to beat Rennes 2-1."
27,19/09/2019,23:24,Lennon energised by Celtic display in Europa League opener,"The Europa League group stage might be a turn-off for some, but for Celtic it is a valuable platform on which to measure themselves and Neil Lennon's side can take plenty of positives from a 1-1 draw away to French Cup winners Rennes on Thursday.","The Glasgow giants again missed out on a place in the Champions League group stage this season but their point in Brittany, secured thanks to a Ryan Christie second-half penalty, is an ideal start in Group E, which also features Lazio and CFR Cluj. Celtic had to come from behind after conceding to M'Baye Niang's 38th-minute spot-kick for the home side, and they ended the game with 10 men as substitute Vakoun Issouf Bayo was sent off in injury time. A draw at Roazhon Park is better than Paris Saint-Germain managed as they went down 2-1 here last month, while Arsenal were beaten on this ground last season. It was a result to be proud of for Celtic's boisterous, sunburnt supporters who brought the city to a standstill on a mass march to the stadium earlier in the day. ""I have got to be satisfied to come away from home and play very strongly against a good side. It speaks volumes for the character and the quality of the team,"" said Lennon, who also thought his team could have had another penalty in the game. ""I am delighted with the performance, and I know we can improve as well as we go along. It was really important in the opening game in the group. We have a lot to look forward to."" Celtic's next opponents will be Cluj, the Romanians who ousted them in the third qualifying round of the Champions League, the second season running in which they have fallen at that hurdle. That has major consequences financially for the Scottish champions, whose revenue broke through the £100 million ($125 million) mark for the first time last year on the back of their appearance in the 2017-18 Champions League group phase. That campaign was marred by heavy defeats at the hands of PSG and Bayern Munich, and in truth this competition is Celtic's level now. For a club who are former European Cup winners that can still be hard to take, especially when facing a Rennes side whose run to the last 16 of the Europa League last season represented their best ever showing in continental competition. According to France Football, Rennes have a budget of 65 million euros ($71.9 million) for this season and so Celtic should be able to compete with them on the field as they did here. ""It's great, it's something obviously we want to improve as we go along,"" the Northern Irishman said of their improved away form in Europe. He was full of praise for centre-back Christopher Jullien and striker Odsonne Edouard, two big-money buys from Ligue 1 who were back on home soil here. Edouard, he pointed out, ""is only 21 and he takes on a huge responsibility being the main striker at a club as big as this."" Having sold Moussa Dembele to Lyon for a huge profit last year, Celtic may not be able to keep hold of Edouard much longer either. Nevertheless, Brendan Rodgers's successor hopes this result can have an effect on the club similar to the last time they came to Rennes. Lennon oversaw a 1-1 draw here in the 2011-12 Europa League before taking the Hoops to the Champions League last 16 in the following campaign. ""This team is superior to the team we had maybe seven or eight years ago and I think there is more experience at this level,"" he mused. ""And off the back of what the players have achieved domestically over the last three or four years we have the makings of a good side."""
28,01/09/2019,18:25,Nice depose Rennes to give Ratcliffe first victory,Nice won for the first time under new ownership to draw level on points with leaders Paris Saint-Germain on Sunday when they inflicted a first defeat of the season on Rennes.,"The 2-1 win moved Nice onto nine point after four games, the same as Rennes as well as champions PSG and Angers, who both won earlier in the weekend. The Parisians already have a significant advantage in goal difference. In the other early game on Sunday, last season's runners up Lille lost 2-0 at Reims. On Wednesday, in their first match after English petrochemical billionaire Jim Ratcliffe's Ineos completed his purchase of the club, Nice lost at home to Marseille. That game was dominated by the over 10-minute suspension ordered by match officials as part of a crackdown on offensive chanting from French football authorities. Nice started badly on Sunday at Roazhon Park. Defender Gautier Lloris, the younger brother of Tottenham goalkeeper Hugo, scored an own goal at a corner after 25 minutes. The visitors dominated the second half and won a penalty when Benjamin Bourigeaud and Hamari Traore sandwiched Youcef Atal. Wylan Cyprien converted from the spot. Nice won the game two minutes into added time. Racine Coly, at the far post from a corner, scored the winner with his knee. In Champagne country, Lille finished with 10 men. The game was still goalless when Lille midfielder Yusuf Yazici received a second yellow card after 52 minutes. The visitors conceded a penalty for a foul on Moussa Doumbia, and after a delay for video review, the winger converted in the 73rd minute. In the 90th minute, Remi Oudin's cross flew into the Lille net. The visitors won a penalty deep into added time, but goalkeeper Pedrag Rajkovic pushed Jonathan Bamba's spot kick onto the post. New signing Renato Sanches was first to the rebound but missed the goal. Later on Sunday struggling Monaco travel to Strasbourg and Marseille host Saint-Etienne."
29,25/08/2019,19:38,Rennes go top of Ligue 1 as Monaco's struggles continue,Rennes backed up their shock win over Paris Saint-Germain last weekend with a 2-0 win at Strasbourg on Sunday that sent them to the top of the early Ligue 1 table.,"Julien Stephan's side, who also stunned PSG to win last season's French Cup, saw off 10-man Strasbourg thanks to goals in either half from Clement Grenier and M'Baye Niang. Grenier drilled the visitors into a 16th-minute lead at the Stade de la Meinau. Jonas Martin missed the chance to equalise for Strasbourg shortly before half-time when his tame penalty was saved by Edouard Mendy. Niang, who also netted against PSG last time out, doubled the advantage nine minutes into the second period. Any home hopes of a comeback were ended when Abdallah Ndour was dismissed late on. Elsewhere, Monaco's miserable start continued as they blew a 2-0 half-time lead to be held to a 2-2 draw by fellow strugglers Nimes in the principality. Close-season signings Islam Slimani and Wissam Ben Yedder put Leonardo Jardim's men, who only narrowly avoided relegation last term, in control at the break. But Brazilian centre-back Jemerson's 55th-minute red card changed the game, and Romain Philippoteaux and 18-year-old Togolese Kevin Denkey struck to grab Nimes a point. Later on Sunday, reigning champions PSG welcome Toulouse to the Parc des Princes, with Neymar again omitted from the squad as he eyes a move away from France."
30,18/08/2019,23:43,PSG suffer defeat at Rennes with 16-year-old in starring role,Champions Paris Saint-Germain slipped up in their second league game of the season losing 2-1 to Rennes on Sunday in a repeat of April's French Cup final with a 16-year-old playing a starring role.,"Edinson Cavani scored after less than 15 minutes of play for the visitors in Brittanny before Mbaye Niang and Romain del Castillo responded for the home side. PSG were without forward Neymar for a third successive game this term with the world's most expensive player continuing to be the subject of interest from Barcelona and Real Madrid. Angolan-born 16-year-old Eduardo Camavinga starred in Rennes midfield, and proved to be key in his team's winning goal, along with experienced playmaker Clement Grenier. Rennes boss Julien Stephan said Camavinga, the first player born since January 2002 to feature in Europe's top five leagues, had continued to improve since making his first team debut in April. ""It's more than six months he's been training with the professionals. He's settled in well with the squad,"" he told broadcaster Canal+. ""We've prepared him with the players, the staff and the whole club so he can evolve in the right conditions. ""He started doing it at the end of last season and he's confirming all the talent we think he has at the start of this season,"" he added. PSG skipper Thiago Silva admitted his side stepped off the gas after their good start through Cavani's effort. ""We started well but we eased off a bit, I don't know why, we lost concentration,"" he told Canal+. ""It wasn't the real PSG. Rennes played well, they were solid defensively, they were more careful than us,"" he added. The Parisians dominated the early proceedings and showed their quality with two good chances within the opening quarter of an hour of play. Firstly Julian Draxler's half-volley skimmed over the bar before Cavani's header hit the post after 14 minutes. Uruguay forward Cavani made up for hitting the woodowrk by scoring 20 minutes later after a defensive howler from Rennes captain Damien da Silva. The centre-back received the ball in his own box but his mis-placed pass to goalkeeper Romain Salin was intercepted by Cavani who tucked it away to make it 1-0. The sides were back level just before the half-time whistle. Right-back Hamari Traore found Niang in the box with a soft cross and the Senegal forward took two light touches, held-off Marquinhos before smoothly curling his effort past Alphonse Areola. The Bretons took the lead than four minutes later of the second-half following a sublime cross from Camavinga. Midfielder Camavinga found a free Del Castillo, starting instead of suspended Flavien Tait, who easily beat Areola with a header. The hosts refused to settle for the one-goal advantage and had a superb chance to make it 3-1 on 62 minutes. Benjamin Bourigeaud played his corner to front post and centre-back Jeremy Gelin's header glanced past Areola but hit the post and dribble out for a goal-kick. Youngster Camavinga could have added a third himself but his half-volley skied over the crossbar. Kylian Mbappe and Cavani had a late chances but they could not save PSG and Thomas Tuchel's blushes, losing to the side who finished in 10th place in the league last season. Earlier on Sunday Saint-Etienne salvaged a late point at home to promoted Brest with new signing Denis Bouanga's 83rd minute effort claiming a 1-1 draw and it finished goalless between Reims and Strasbourg."
31,28/04/2019,13:29,Neymar says he was wrong to hit fan after cup-final defeat,Brazilian superstar Neymar accepted on Sunday that he had made a mistake striking a fans who insulted Paris Saint-Germain players as they filed up to collect their French Cup losers' medals.,"Neymar scored to put PSG 2-0 up after 21 minutes at the Stade de France on Saturday, but Rennes fought back to tie the game at 2-2 and win the penalty shootout 6-5 after extra time. As the players climbed the steps to receive their medals, shaking the hands of those nearby, Neymar, one of the last in line, struck one of the fans in the face. The blow was caught on numerous mobile phones, including that of the victim, Edouard, a 28-year-old delivery driver from Nantes. ""Did I act badly?"" Neymar asked in an Instagram comment. ""Yes. But no one can stay indifferent."" A Brazilian friend of Neymar's, Alex Bernardo, posted on Instagram a transcript of the comments audible on Edouard's video starting with unused reserves goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon and defender Layvin Kurzawa. ""Oh, Buffon, dirty Bouffon! Oh, Kurzawa, keep your hand to yourself!"" Then to Marco Verratti: ""Oh, racist!"" and to Neymar: ""Oh, go and learn to play football."" The Brazilian striker reacted by pushing down the phone to hit Edouard in the face. ""Who will defend me from going in defence of my teammates?"" Neymar wrote in a comment on Bernardo's post. PSG quickly responded with a statement that said that a ""friend of a Rennes player had insulted all the players"" to ""create a buzz"" on social media. ""I did not insult him,"" Edouard told French sports daily L'Equipe. ""I told him that they had been useless."" ""When the players passed, Verratti, Buffon, I mocked them: 'You are worthless. Allez Rennes!'"" Edouard said he had contemplated bringing charges against Neymar who left him with ""a cut lip and bloody nose"". The blow continued a bad-tempered end to the evening for PSG. Neymar's strike partner Kylian Mbappe was sent off for a dreadful tackle with two minutes left in extra time. The defeat ended PSG's four-year reign in the French Cup and means that, while they have retained the French league, they have won none of the cups they entered this season, with the most painful their exit at the last 16 stage of the Champions League to Manchester United."
32,28/04/2019,02:43,Mbappe sent off as PSG lose French Cup final to Rennes,"Kylian Mbappe was sent off for a shocking tackle as Paris Saint-Germain were stunned by Rennes in Saturday's French Cup final, losing 6-5 on penalties after a dramatic game finished 2-2 at the end of extra time.","PSG substitute Christopher Nkunku blazed his sudden-death spot-kick over the bar in the shootout, sparking scenes of joy among the Rennes fans at the Stade de France as they won a first trophy in almost half a century. ""It has been talked about enough at the club in the last few weeks for us to realise that we have achieved something historic,"" said Rennes coach Julien Stephan. It was a remarkable comeback from the Brittany side, who had seen Dani Alves and the returning Neymar give Ligue 1 champions PSG a 2-0 lead midway through the first half. Thomas Tuchel's side appeared poised to wrap up a domestic double, but Presnel Kimpembe's own goal gave Rennes hope and Edson Mexer headed them level in the 66th minute to take a gripping final -- attended by President Emmanuel Macron -- to extra time. Penalties were already looming when Mbappe, who endured a frustrating evening, was shown a straight red card in the 118th minute for a dreadful challenge on Damien Da Silva. The France star caught the Rennes defender on the knee with his studs, and can expect a lengthy ban. ""He had a slight muscle injury yesterday, he stopped training early and went to hospital for tests. Maybe that was in his head,"" said Tuchel. ""You got the feeling he was lacking confidence and didn't feel free. The red card at the end, it's not him."" Without him, PSG fell short of securing the double in Tuchel's first season in charge, which will also be remembered for the Qatar-owned club's Champions League exit to Manchester United in the last 16. ""I am sad,"" said Neymar. ""We weren't quite up to it, but there is no point crying about it now. There is nothing we can do."" They had been looking to win the Cup for the fifth year running, but instead it is traditional underachievers Rennes -- owned by luxury goods mogul Francois Pinault, one of France's richest men -- who celebrate a famous victory. It is their first silverware since the 1971 French Cup and also means a return to the Europa League next season. ""We can stop talking about being losers. This title will change the history of the club,"" added Stephan. Few of their fans would have imagined it possible after the way they started, with PSG looking more like their former selves as Neymar made his first start in three months after injury. Rennes had been knocked out of this competition following heavy defeats by PSG in each of the last two seasons, and another hiding looked on the cards as they went 2-0 down. The opener came in the 13th minute when a corner fell to Alves just outside the area and he met the ball with a volley that flew low into the corner. The second goal came midway through the first half, as a stray Hatem Ben Arfa pass was intercepted by Alves before Angel Di Maria sent Neymar through to score with a delightful chip over Tomas Koubek, who had come off his line. It was a 21st goal of the season for the world's most expensive player. Rennes roused themselves to finish the half strongly, however, and Mbaye Niang struck a post before they reduced the arrears five minutes from the interval. Hamari Traore crossed from the right and Kimpembe sliced the ball into his own net. They continued to cause problems to PSG in the second half, and it was no surprise when Rennes equalised as Clement Grenier's corner was headed home by Mexer, the Mozambican defender. Into extra time they went, and Neymar set up Mbappe for a shot against the post, but proof that Rennes had done more than just ruffle PSG's feathers came when France's golden boy was sent off. It was not his or PSG's night, for once."
33,26/04/2019,02:20,Neymar headlines returning cast,Paris Saint-Germain's pursuit of a fifth successive French Cup title will be bolstered by the return of Neymar and Edinson Cavani from long-term injuries for Saturday's showdown with Rennes at the Stade de France.,"Brazil star Neymar made his first appearance since January 23 as a second-half substitute in Sunday's 3-1 win over Monaco as PSG celebrated clinching a sixth Ligue 1 crown in seven years. Cavani also returned to action, coming on for the final 17 minutes, as PSG's famed front three -- which has accounted for 78 goals this season -- were reunited after months apart. Coach Thomas Tuchel admitted he ""worried"" for PSG's prospects after they blew a third chance to wrap up the league at Nantes last week, but the German struck a more positive note after watching his team belatedly seal the title. ""Our objective is clear: to win the double. We have to win on Saturday,"" said Tuchel, who is also set to welcome back Angel Di Maria after six weeks out. ""The French Cup is very important to us, and we hope to clinch it and leave nothing for the others,"" added goalkeeper Alphonse Areola, his thoughts echoed by defender Marquinhos. ""A title is always about honour and pride. We all know what our goal for the season is, and that's to win a maximum number of titles for the club,"" said the Brazilian. Anything less than a domestic double for PSG, attempting to lift the French Cup for a record 13th time, would cast further gloom over the Qatari-backed club after their latest European failure. But Gianluigi Buffon expects Rennes, who enjoyed their best ever run on the continent this year by reaching the Europa League last 16, to present a tricky test. PSG beat Rennes 3-1 at Roazhon Park and won 4-1 at the Parc des Princes, but Rennes will look for the ultimate revenge as they chase a first French Cup in 48 years. ""The fact that it's a one-off match, a final, brings the two sides closer together, the gap isn't as wide as it can be over 38 matches,"" Buffon told PSG TV. ""In the league our chances might have been 80-20, in the final it's more like 60-40 or 65-35, because it's a final where anything can happen."" Rennes won the trophy in 1965 and 1971, but the Brittany club have painful memories of their past two finals -- finishing as runners-up to neighbours Guingamp in both 2009 and 2014. ""We have a bit more experience now than we did during our first games in Europe but it's still a totally different game,"" said Rennes captain Benjamin Andre. ""Lifting the trophy at the Stade de France would be great. We know the expectations at Rennes. We'll obviously give it our all like we do in each match."""
34,03/04/2019,00:42,Genesio future unclear as Lyon lose in French Cup,Lyon president Jean-Michel Aulas said he will wait until the end of the season to decide the future of coach Bruno Genesio following Tuesday's 3-2 defeat at home to Rennes in the French Cup semi-finals.,"Rennes twice led at the Groupama Stadium through goals from Mbaye Niang and Benjamin Andre, but Lyon hit back with a Bertrand Traore goal and Moussa Dembele penalty. Algeria defender Ramy Bensebaini drilled home the winner for Rennes on 81 minutes to send his side through to the final and a possible showdown with holders Paris Saint-Germain. Bensebaini's strike allowed Rennes to avenge Friday's 1-0 league defeat by Lyon and denied Genesio's side the chance to claim their first silverware since lifting the trophy in 2012. ""It was agreed that if we were in the final -- which is no longer the case -- and if we were in the top three, there would be a two-year extension,"" Aulas said afterwards. ""The deal that was reached with Bruno is that there will not be a contract renewal between now and the end of the season. ""It will stay like that. It's really sad not to be able to say that Bruno will extend his stay."" Lyon are third in Ligue 1 and trail Lille by four points in the race for the second automatic Champions League qualifying spot. ""I'm very disappointed we're not through to the final,"" said Genesio, who has been in charge at Lyon since December 2015. ""There are eight games left in the league and I'm going to do everything to lead the team into the Champions League. ""My personal situation is not the priority. We're not in control of our destiny because we're third. The goal is to be less than three points adrift of Lille when they come to play us (in early May)."" Rennes will face either four-time reigning champions PSG or Nantes, who meet in Paris on Wednesday, in the French Cup final at the Stade de France on April 27."

The LFP said in a statement they had agreed to help the Breton club to ""prepare in the best possible conditions"" for the first leg of their round-of-16 tie at The Roazhon Park on Thursday March 7. Rennes have a French Cup quarter-final on Wednesday, meaning Saturday's league fixture could not be brought forward to Friday. Nimes complained in a statement that they did ""not understand this decision which will upset once again the calendar and challenges the principle of fair play."" ""When you have a game called off for the 256th time this season,"" Nimes jokingly tweeted with the attached video saying ""Again, it's a lot"" as in recent weeks they have had to squeeze in home matches against Angers and Nantes which were postponed because of 'yellow vests' protests in the town. Rennes are ninth in Ligue 1, a point ahead of Nimes and both clubs still have an outside chance of finishing high enough to qualify for next year's Europa League."
36,22/02/2019,16:44,"Arsenal face Rennes in Europa League last 16, Chelsea draw Dynamo Kiev","Arsenal will face French side Rennes in the last 16 of the Europa League, while Chelsea were paired with Dynamo Kiev in Friday's draw.","Both Premier League clubs were initially drawn to be at home in the first leg on Thursday, March 7. However, in order to avoid two games in London on the same night, Arsenal will now travel to France for the first leg, before hosting Rennes at the Emirates Stadium on March 14. Arsenal's draw means that their veteran goalkeeper Petr Cech will return to face the club he represented for two seasons before joining Chelsea in 2004. ""When a goalkeeper makes the draw good things happen,"" tweeted Cech after former Sevilla 'keeper Andres Palop performed the draw at UEFA's headquarters in Switzerland. The Gunners overturned a 1-0 first-leg deficit to qualify for the last 16 by beating BATE Borisov of Belarus 3-0 on Thursday. Meanwhile, Rennes reached the last 16 for the first time in their history with a fine 3-1 win away to Real Betis in Spain, a result that gave them a 6-4 aggregate triumph. The Brittany club finished fifth in Ligue 1 last season and are currently in mid-table, but have impressed since the 38-year-old Julien Stephan was appointed as coach in December. Arsenal manager Unai Emery -- who won the Europa League three years running as coach of Sevilla -- is familiar with Rennes from his two seasons in charge of Paris Saint-Germain. London rivals Chelsea, the other Premier League club still in the competition, might also view winning the Europa League as their most likely route into next season's Champions League. After beating Swedish side Malmo 5-1 on aggregate, they might find the going tougher against Ukrainian giants Dynamo though. The clubs met in the group stage of the Champions League in 2015-16, drawing 0-0 in Kiev before Chelsea won 2-1 at Stamford Bridge. Elsewhere, Sevilla, who have won the trophy five times including twice in its former guise as the UEFA Cup, will face Slavia Prague. Widely-fancied Napoli will take on the Austrian champions Salzburg, who reached the semi-finals last season. Former European Cup finalists and UEFA Cup winners Eintracht Frankfurt were drawn against Inter Milan, who won the UEFA Cup three times in the 1990s. Benfica face Dinamo Zagreb, while Valencia's reward for knocking out Celtic is a tie against FC Krasnodar of Russia. That is one of two ties between Russian and Spanish sides, with Zenit Saint Petersburg drawn against Villarreal. The final of this season's Europa League will be played in Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan, on May 29."
37,04/02/2019,18:50,Ben Arfa takes PSG to court over year-long 'shutout',"Former France international Hatem Ben Arfa is seeking millions of euros of damages from Paris Saint-Germain for allegedly freezing him out in the final year of his contract, his lawyer told AFP on Monday.","The 31-year-old former Newcastle United midfielder lodged his claim with the Paris industrial tribunal last week, lawyer Jean-Jacques Bertrand said. Ben Arfa joined PSG in 2016, but was sidelined from April 2017 until his contract expired at the end of last season. He played in 23 Ligue 1 matches for PSG, often as a substiute, without scoring a single league goal. French newspaper Journal du Dimanche reported he is claiming he was shut out after the club took exception to the player appealing directly to PSG's owner, the emir of Qatar, over a lack of contact with the club's president Nasser Al-Khelaifi. Ben Arfa, who is currently with Ligue 1 side Rennes, is seeking between seven and eight million euros ($8 million and $9.1 million) in damages for ""discrimination"" he suffered for non-sporting reasons, French radio station RMC Sport reported. The damages correspond to bonuses Ben Arfa says are unpaid. Once one of his country's brightest prospects, Paris-born Ben Arfa joined his home-town side among much fanfare after a standout season at Ligue 1 rivals Nice that helped rebuild a tarnished reputation following a disappointing period with Hull City in England. He began his professional career with Lyon, before spells with Marseille and three and a half seasons with Newcastle. After leaving PSG as a free agent he joined Rennes at the start of the season."
38,27/01/2019,23:14,PSG cruise to victory as worries grow over Neymar fitness,Edinson Cavani scored twice as Paris Saint-Germain shook off the loss of Neymar to injury with a 4-1 win over Rennes at the Parc des Princes on Sunday that keeps them unbeaten at the top of Ligue 1.,"The Uruguayan's goals took him to 16 for the season in 14 league appearances and bookended the scoring in the French capital, with Angel Di Maria and Kylian Mbappe also on target for PSG. Mbaye Niang had equalised for Rennes in the first half, but Thomas Tuchel's side eventually ran away with the game after the break and are once again a massive 13 points ahead of Lille at the top of the table, with two matches in hand. Despite that, this encounter was played out in a rather flat atmosphere, with one end of the stadium partially closed as a punishment following incidents during a game late last year. Brazil coach Tite and national team coordinator Edu were in attendance at the start of a European tour to check on the form of some of their key players, but it is unclear what they will have taken from this game. Neymar was missing after suffering a metatarsal injury in a French Cup win over Strasbourg in midweek, with some media reports in France now claiming that the world's most expensive player will definitely miss the first leg of their Champions League last-16 tie against Manchester United on February 12. Meanwhile, a lack of alternatives meant Tuchel fielded Marquinhos and Daniel Alves out of position together in midfield. On top of that, skipper Thiago Silva was caught out as Niang flicked Rennes level just before the half-hour, cancelling out Cavani's headed opener from a Di Maria cross. Rennes were arguably the better side in the first half, although Tuchel was raging after Niang escaped with a yellow card for a dangerous challenge on Thilo Kehrer. The referee upheld his decision even after a VAR review. Nevertheless, PSG ran away with the game after the break, going back in front on the hour mark when Silva sent Di Maria through to clip a delightful finish over Tomas Koubek. When Clement Grenier was caught in possession, Julian Draxler released Mbappe to score his 18th league goal of the campaign and make it 3-1. PSG completed the scoring in the 71st minute when Mbappe squared for Cavani to grab his second of the evening, making it 15 goals in three home wins for them in nine days. Earlier, Lyon strengthened their grip on a Champions League position after defender Jason Denayer's headed goal handed them a 1-0 win at Amiens. With their Champions League last-16 first leg against Barcelona looming on the horizon, Lyon remain third in Ligue 1, three points behind second-placed Lille. Lille won 2-1 at Marseille on Friday in a game which was held up for more than half an hour in the second half after a firecracker thrown from the stands exploded next to home player Kevin Strootman. Struggling Monaco slumped to a 2-0 defeat at relegation rivals Dijon on Saturday in their first game since Thierry Henry was sacked as coach. Henry lasted just three months in charge before being replaced by his predecessor Leonardo Jardim, who watched Saturday's game in the stands in Dijon. Monaco remain three points from outright safety."
39,26/01/2019,23:12,Monaco plight persists in wake of Henry exit,"Monaco suffered another damaging defeat as they lost 2-0 at Dijon in Ligue 1 on Saturday, just 24 hours after reappointing former boss Leonardo Jardim to take over from the sacked Thierry Henry.","Former France and Arsenal star Henry was suspended and later axed by Monaco after just two wins in the league since his arrival in October. Jardim, who led Monaco to the French title in 2017, is returning to the club only three months after he was dismissed following a dreadful start to the season. His first game back in charge will be Tuesday's League Cup semi-final against Guingamp, as Henry's former assistant Franck Passi oversaw the trip to fellow strugglers Dijon. The abject nature of this latest defeat further emphasised Monaco's perilous position in the table where they remain second from bottom, a point above last-placed Guingamp. ""We're giving everything but it's not enough,"" said Monaco captain Radamel Falcao. ""Each player has to continue to give more, all of us together. We're all in the same boat. ""We didn't manage to change things with Thierry Henry and now we must carry on with a better spirit and all fight together."" Dijon's Kwon Chang-hoon notched his first league goal since May, having recently returned from an Achilles injury, with a calm finish on 24 minutes after a static Naldo played the South Korean onside. Monaco were reduced to 10 men on the hour when Brazilian Naldo saw red for a clumsy challenge on Julio Tavares, and another defensive lapse allowed Naim Sliti to wrap up what was just Dijon's second league win since August. It was Naldo's second red card in a week after he was also dismissed in the 5-1 loss to Strasbourg last Saturday. ""We had chances just like in the past four of five matches but we always make a mistake that kills us,"" said Passi, who refused to be drawn on his own future. ""We let the other team go ahead and we're chasing after the result and that obviously makes it harder,"" he added. ""These players have the quality. They have what it takes to stay up but they just need for things to click and for it to happen quickly."" Youcef Atal and Allan Saint-Maximin scored for Patrick Vieira's Nice in a 2-0 home win over Nimes, while Kenny Lala fired home a sweet half-volley with practically the final kick to give Strasbourg a 1-0 victory over Bordeaux. Reims climbed into the top half as a 1-0 win at Guingamp stretched their unbeaten run to six matches. On Sunday, leaders Paris Saint-Germain will host Rennes without the injured Neymar. The world's most expensive player limped out of Wednesday's French Cup win over Strasbourg after hurting his foot, an injury similar to the one that ruled him out for more than two months last season. PSG coach Thomas Tuchel has said it is ""still too early"" to assess the seriousness of Neymar's injury, leaving the French giants sweating over his fitness ahead of their Champions League clash with Manchester United next month."
40,03/12/2018,15:19,Lamouchi shown the door at Rennes,"Rennes have effectively sacked their coach Sabri Lamouchi after he was suspended in the wake of poor recent form, the French Ligue 1 club announced on Monday.","In a statement, Rennes said Lamouchi had been ""suspended"" and reserve team coach Julian Stephan been put in temporary charge of the first team. Lamouchi is unlikely to return, meaning Sunday's chastening 4-1 home defeat against Strasbourg will be the last of his year-long spell in charge in Brittany. Rennes are currently 14th in Ligue 1, four points clear of the relegation zone before Wednesday's trip to Lyon. The 47-year-old former French international midfielder -- who has previously coached the Ivory Coast national team and in Qatar -- took over in November last year and led Rennes to European qualification via a fifth-place finish in Ligue 1. A win at home to Astana of Kazakhstan next week will see Rennes advance to the knockout phase of the Europa League. It would be the first time in their history they are still involved in European competition in the second half of a season. But Rennes have won just two of their last 11 league games and Lamouchi has failed to integrate successfully Hatem Ben Arfa, the club's highest-profile signing at the start of the campaign."
41,22/10/2018,00:06,Vieira's Nice continue to struggle with Marseille loss,Patrick Vieira's Nice slumped to a fourth defeat in five home league games this season as Morgan Sanson's first-half strike fired Marseille to a 1-0 win in Ligue 1 on Sunday.,"It was a laboured performance from Nice, who sit 14th in the table and only two points above the relegation play-off spot, eight points adrift of fourth-placed Marseille. Vieira may need a good run of results if he is to keep his job long enough to take on former Arsenal and France teammate Thierry Henry when his side visit Monaco on December 8. ""Unfortunately, tonight's match reflects our other home games,"" said Vieira. ""(Forwards) Allan (Saint-Maximin), Mario (Balotelli) and Myziane (Maolida) have not been successful. In the last 30 metres there has been a lack of quality, we haven't always made the right choices."" For Marseille, all eyes will now be on next Sunday's clash with arch rivals and runaway league leaders Paris Saint-Germain at the Velodrome. The hosts went into the match having mustered only seven goals in nine league games this season, and Vieira responded by handing Mario Balotelli just his third start of the campaign up front. The first decent chance at the Allianz Riviera fell to the Italy international, but after latching onto a long ball forward from Dante his well-struck volley was kept out by the legs of Marseille goalkeeper Steve Mandanda. A clever dummy from Balotelli created space for Allan Saint-Maximin, but his shot was tame and easily gathered by Mandanda. The away side grabbed the lead in the 42nd minute, though, as full-back Bouna Sarr skipped clear down the right-hand side and crossed for Sanson to smartly turn and fire into the bottom corner. Nice plugged away in search of an equaliser but never looked like having the quality to break through, with centre-back Dante's looping volley onto the roof of the net the best effort Vieira's men could muster. Balotelli, who was strongly linked with Marseille during the close-season before opting to stay at Nice, has failed to score this term after netting 43 goals over the last two campaigns. ""Mario? He was just like the team -- very good in the first half, then he wasn't as good. He still has to work,"" said Vieira. Earlier on Sunday, Montpellier moved into third as goals from Gaetan Laborde and Andy Delort sealed a 2-0 win over Bordeaux, while Saint-Etienne drew 1-1 against Rennes. Henry suffered a miserable return to French football on Saturday as Monaco lost at Strasbourg in his first match as a head coach, while PSG thrashed Amiens to make it 10 successive wins to start the season."
42,07/10/2018,20:13,Monaco crash again as Halilhodzic loses Nantes debut,"Monaco slumped to a fifth defeat in nine Ligue 1 matches as Hatem Ben Arfa earned Rennes a 2-1 victory on Sunday, while ex-Japan coach Vahid Halilhodzic was beaten 3-0 on his return to French football following his appointment at former club Nantes.","Defender Damien Da Silva turned home a Ben Arfa corner to give Rennes, who arrived in the principality just two points above 18th-placed Monaco, the lead on 14 minutes. Monaco's Andrea Raggi was sent off for throwing a punch at Clement Grenier just before half-time, but the home side levelled early in the second half through Radamel Falcao. However, Rennes secured a first win in five games as Monaco goalkeeper Danijel Subasic allowed Ben Arfa's powerful 25-yard drive to zip past him on 77 minutes, giving the former Paris Saint-Germain outcast his first league goal since April 2016. Leonardo Jardim's Monaco, runners-up to PSG last season, remain winless since the opening weekend and above the automatic relegation spots only on goal difference. Earlier, Franco-Bosnian Halilhodzic watched his Nantes side slide to a heavy defeat at Bordeaux on a day to forget for on-loan Chelsea defender Matt Miazga. The colourful 66-year-old Halilhodzic replaced Miguel Cardoso on Tuesday just eight games into the season, with Nantes having won just once in the Portuguese's brief spell in charge. Halilhodzic won a Ligue 1 title as a striker with Nantes in the 1980s, and later went on to coach Lille and Rennes but has not worked in France since he was fired by PSG in 2005. Since then he has coached clubs in Turkey, Croatia and Saudi Arabia. He also managed the national teams of Ivory Coast, Algeria -- who he led to the knockout rounds at the 2014 World Cup -- and Japan, where he was fired after guiding the Blue Samurai to qualification for this year's finals in Russia. Nantes' rotten run showed no sign of abating though as Yann Karamoh curled in a brilliant opening goal after just five minutes. They quickly found themselves two down after a mix-up between goalkeeper Ciprian Tatarusanu and US international Miazga allowed Francois Kamano to take full advantage. Kamano struck again in a torrid first half for the visitors, winning and converting a penalty after a rash challenge from Miazga to move onto a joint-best seven league goals this term. ""This performance worries me. When one is subjected to such tactical and technical domination you understand why Nantes are in this position,"" said Halilhodzic. ""If someone else had offered me this, I would never come. But I couldn't refuse for Nantes. There's still a considerable amount of work to be done."" Marseille rebounded from throwing away a two-goal lead at Apollon Limassol in the Europa League to climb third following a 2-0 victory over Caen. Kostas Mitroglou and Florian Thauvin bagged first-half goals at the Velodrome, the latter moving level with Kamano, Neymar and Jonathan Bamba atop the goalscoring chart. Thomas Tuchel's PSG will bid for a record ninth consecutive win to start the season at home to Lyon later, having matched the mark set by Olympique Lillois in 1936 last weekend."
43,23/09/2018,17:07,Neymar gets PSG back on track,"From a deeper than usual playmaker role Brazil's Neymar pulled the strings as Paris Saint-Germain came from behind to beat Rennes 3-1 in Ligue 1 on Sunday, helping to dispel midweek memories of a European flop at Liverpool.","Hosts Rennes took a surprise 11th minute lead when PSG midfielder Adrien Rabiot nodded past his own 'keeper, Gianluigi Buffon, from a corner before goals from Angel Di Maria, Thomas Meunier and Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting gave them a hard-fought sixth straight Ligue 1 win. Later Sunday Lyon, who stunned Manchester City in the Champions League in midweek, host bitter rivals Marseille. PSG critics have suggested the French giants had overspent on strikers and forgotten about the midfield after a tame 3-2 defeat in the Champions League at Anfield this week. With superstar striker Kylian Mbappe sitting out through suspension, there was room for both Di Maria and German winger Julian Draxler in the starting line up, with Neymar pulled into the No.10 position, where his passes were a sight to behold, behind Edindson Cavani. A young fan ran on to the pitch as Neymar was leaving as a late substitute and the youngster crumpled in tears as his hero hugged him and gave him his shirt in touching scenes that are likely to go viral on social media. After Rabiot's earlier upset Neymar seemed to be at the origin of almost everything the visitors threw at Rennes, including when Cavani hit the post from a sumptuous piece of play. On the stroke of half-time Draxler cut back from the byline and Cavani's dummy set up Di Maria to fire a precise shot into the bottom right-hand corner from a good 25 metres out. Neymar, 26, was then at the root of both Meunier's 61st minute goal and Choupo-Moting's first goal for the Parisians since joining from Stoke. ""We did well to come back into it,"" said PSG handler Thomas Tuchel, who instead of praising Neymar singled out Meunier. ""He was great again, a goal and some great passing, a top performance."" Buffon had his work cut out in the second half as Rennes playmaker Clement Grenier fed the speedy Senegalese strike-pair M'Baye Niang and the 20-year-old Ismaila Sarr. Rennes coach Sabri Lamouchi threw on ex-PSG midfielder Hatem Ben Arfa for one last roll of the dice but PSG went home with all three points and ideas about a new format for coach Tuchel. Pointless Guingamp were left rock bottom of Ligue 1 Sunday when they were beaten 3-1 at home by Bordeaux, who thereby climbed out of the drop zone with just their second win from six outings."
44,02/09/2018,14:59,Hatem Ben Arfa joins Rennes from PSG,"French international attacking midfielder Hatem Ben Arfa has joined Rennes from Paris saint Germain, the player revealed via his Twitter account on Sunday.","The 31-year-old former Newcastle and Hull player thereby ends two miserable seasons at PSG where featured in just 23 games and played no competitive soccer last season. Rennes posted a video on their website announcing the arrival of a 'new artist' which showed Ben Arfa dribbling around bewildered opponents set to th Michael Jackson hit 'I want you back'. The video pans out to a smiling Ben Arfa, who has won five Ligue 1 titles, wearing the Rennes number 18 shirt. ""I'm on top form and I've done all the tests,"" Ben Arfa pointed out on Sunday. ""I'm really happy to be here where there are great ambitions, I feel like it is the right club for me,"" he said. It had been thought Ben Arfa would opt for a switch back to Nice, where he had a wonderful 2015-2016 season. ""It's quite complicated going back to a club where you have already been, a bit like going back with an ex-girlfriend. Rennes' first game after the international break is against Nice."
45,04/06/2018,15:51,Rennes swoop for Swedish World Cup hero,"French top flight outfit Rennes have signed Sweden's injured World Cup hero Jakob Johansson from Greek champions AEK Athens, the Brittany club said on Monday.","Johansson is the man who sent Sweden to the World Cup finals in Russia by scoring the winning goal in a play-off with Italy in November. ""Rennes are a very well structured club with fine training facilities and a great stadium,"" Johansson told the Rennes website. ""They also have a very clear and ambitious project."" Rennes came fifth in Ligue 1 last season and are coached by former France midfielder Sabri Lamouchi. Johansson was club captain at AEK in their title winning campaign but was omitted from Sweden's 23-man World Cup squad due to a knee injury that limited his appearances this season. The 27-year-old has signed a two year deal at Rennes and moves on a free agent contract."
46,20/04/2018,23:13,Five-star Lyon take another step towards Champions League return,Captain Nabil Fekir scored a superb goal as Lyon stayed on course for a return to the Champions League by romping to a 5-2 win at Dijon in Ligue 1 on Friday.,"Memphis Depay, Houssem Aouar, Bertrand Traore and Maxwel Cornet were also on target for the visitors in Burgundy, as a rampant Lyon claimed a sixth consecutive league victory. Bruno Genesio's side -- who missed out on a Champions League place this season -- are now just a point behind second-placed Monaco, who visit Guingamp on Saturday. Crucially, they are also three points ahead of fourth-placed Marseille, who entertain Lille in another Saturday game. Only the top three sides qualify for the Champions League in Ligue 1, and OL looked to be out of the running after a poor run of form in February and into March. However, they have come roaring back on a winning run that has included a dramatic away victory at Marseille and has seen them score 19 goals while taking 18 points from a possible 18. This was the fifth away game this season in which they have scored five times, with Depay setting them on the way when he turned in a cross from fellow former Manchester United man Rafael early on. The Dutchman has now scored 15 Ligue 1 goals this season, with six coming in his last five games. A terrific Naim Sliti strike meant the scores were level at the interval, but Depay helped on another Rafael cross for Aouar to put Lyon ahead again five minutes after the break. French international Fekir, making his first start since returning from a knee injury, then dribbled into the penalty area before finishing neatly into the roof of the net at the end of a counterattack to make it 3-1 in the 53rd minute. Dijon still made a fight of it, with Sliti scoring again to reduce the deficit before the hosts were left furious when Wesley Said went down under a Rafael challenge in the box but no penalty was given. However, substitute Cornet came on to set up former Chelsea forward Traore to side-foot in Lyon's fourth, and Cornet himself completed the scoring with seven minutes left. Elsewhere on Friday, Rennes came from behind to draw 1-1 at derby rivals Nantes in a meeting of two sides fighting for Europa League qualification. Adrien Thomasson put Claudio Ranieri's Nantes in front before the break, but they then had Emiliano Sala sent off just after the restart, and James Lea-Siliki got Rennes' leveller. Rennes are fifth, in a Europa League qualifying slot, while Nantes are two points behind in eighth. Reims secured promotion back to Ligue 1 after a two-year absence, with the former European Cup finalists beating Ajaccio 1-0 to clinch the Ligue 2 title. After winning a fifth Ligue 1 title in six seasons last weekend, champions Paris Saint-Germain are at Bordeaux on Sunday."
47,29/01/2018,14:01,Sakho joins Rennes from West Ham,"Senegalese centre-forward Diafra Sakho has returned to France, leaving West Ham United after four years for Ligue 1 side Rennes, the Brittany-based side said on Monday.","Rennes, sitting mid-table in France, hope to give Sakho his debut against leaders Paris Saint-Germain on Tuesday, if the 28-year-old's papers are processed in time. ""I'm ready to play, maybe not to start the game but to play some part,"" Sakho told a press conference. No fee was mentioned by either club for the man who scored 18 goals in 62 appearances for the Londoners after signing from Metz in 2014, but the deal is for two and a half seasons and is said to have cost Rennes £10 million ($14 million, 11.4 million euros). ""It's never easy to get a player from the Premier League, there were other people interested in England and France,"" said Rennes president Olivier Letang, who tried to sign Sakho in the summer. ""Rennes was the team I wanted to join, the president came after me and I appreciate that. It's a big club with a great history and big ambitions, so I signed with both pride and joy,"" Sakho told the club's website."
48,14/12/2017,00:00,PSG cruise into League Cup quarters,Paris Saint-Germain brushed off the absence of Neymar to ease into the French League Cup quarter-finals with a 4-2 victory at Strasbourg on Wednesday.,"The Ligue 1 leaders gained a measure of revenge for their shock 2-1 league defeat by Strasbourg less than a fortnight ago as they started their bid for a fifth straight League Cup title. PSG will take on Amiens in the last eight, after the newly-promoted top-flight club edged out second-tier Tours 2-1. ""We needed to improve from the league game and the team was more focused from the start,"" said PSG coach Unai Emery. ""Maybe we could have scored more goals and played better after it went to 4-2, but we are still happy."" With Neymar having only just returned from a visit to his native Brazil, Emery opted to play Edinson Cavani up front on his own with Kylian Mbappe on the bench. Home hopes of a repeat performance for Strasbourg were dashed in only the 12th minute, as Yoann Salmier sliced Angel Di Maria's cross into his own net. Argentina international Di Maria made it two midway through the first half, capitalising on a goalkeeping error by Alexandre Oukidja to slot in his fourth goal of the season. But Strasbourg pulled one back before half-time against the run of play as midfielder Jeremy Grimm, who has been with the club throughout their rise from the third tier, slotted into the corner. The hosts battled hard in the second period but their resistance was finally ended when Thomas Meunier crossed for fellow full-back Dani Alves to tap in from close range. German international Julian Draxler impressed in a three-man attacking midfield alongside Di Maria and Javier Pastore, and drilled in to end a nine-game goal drought for club and country. Jeremy Blayac came off the bench to score a late consolation for Strasbourg, but PSG had long since secured their place in the quarters. Elsewhere, a much-changed Lyon were stunned 4-1 at Montpellier despite taking a 10th-minute lead through teenager Myziane Maolida, as Souleymane Camara scored twice for the hosts. Nice goalkeeper Yoan Cardinale was the hero as Lucien Favre's men edged past managerless Lille on penalties after Mario Balotelli had rescued the a 1-1 draw for the visitors. Monaco will be Nice's last-eight opponents, after the principality outfit saw off Caen on Tuesday. Rennes beat Marseille in a penalty shootout after an entertaining 2-2 draw at Roazhon Park, where Kostas Mitroglou and Valere Germain scored for the visitors, but to no avail. Quarter-final draw (ties to be played January 9/10): Angers v Montpellier, Amiens v Paris Saint-Germain, Nice v Monaco, Rennes v Toulouse"
49,08/11/2017,18:13,Sabri Lamouchi named new Rennes coach,"Former France midfielder Sabri Lamouchi was named new coach of Rennes on Wednesday, the Ligue 1 club announced.","Lamouchi, who replaces Christian Gourcuff, signed a two-year deal with an option for a third in what will be his first experience of the elite French division. Since his retirement as a player during which time he played for Auxerre, Monaco, Parma, Inter Milan and Marseille among others, the 12-times capped Lamouchi coached Ivory Coast from 2012-14 and Qatari club El-Jaish since 2015."
50,18/09/2017,14:37,Balotelli screamer fires Nice past Rennes,A sizzling Mario Balotelli strike ten minutes from time gave Nice a 1-0 win at Rennes on Sunday as last season's Ligue 1 pace-setters appear to be overcoming a poor start this term.,"Balotelli hammered a supreme shot into the top corner for his fourth goal in three games since missing the start of the season as Lucien Favre's side continue their climb up the table into eighth place. ""It could easily have been a draw,"" said Favre, whose side beat Monaco 4-0 last week and who led Nice to third in Ligue 1 last season. ""Considering it's been three games in a week, this is more than satisfying,"" he said. For the Italian international it was an 18th league goal in 26 matches for Nice, who beat Zulte Waregem 5-1 away in the Europa League on Thursday where the giant former AC Milan and Manchester City striker with his mohican haircut scored twice. Earlier Sunday Marseille also pulled out of an early season slump when a Clinton Njie brace gave the ambitious southerners a 2-0 win at Amiens. Under new ownership with a bevvy of new signings Rudi Garcia's side were thrashed 6-1 at Monaco two weeks ago followed by an embarrassing 3-1 home defeat to Rennes. But a lucky break up at northern outfit Amiens helped get Marseille back on track for their dream of Champions League football when a deflected cross hit Njie in the midriff and bounced into the goal with the 'keeper wrong-footed. The 24-year-old former Spurs man then doubled the tally two minutes later after rounding 'keeper Regis Gurtner on 55 minutes. In a good sign of things to come Cameroon international Njie, winner of the 2017 Africa Cup of Nations, took his Ligue 1 tally to five. American businessman Frank McCourt, former owner of the LA Dodgers and Marseille's new owner, has promised he'll get them back into the Champions League for the first time sine 2013. The win lifted Marseille to fifth on 10 points from six games while table toppers Paris Saint-Germain have 15 points ahead of their late game with Lyon. On Saturday a revitalised Radamel Falcao grabbed a brace as second-placed champions Monaco beat Strasbourg 3-0. Saint-Etienne moved up to third as Jonathan Bamba's third goal of the season from the penalty spot saw them edge out lowly Dijon 1-0. Nantes continued their good form under Claudio Ranieri, as they beat Caen 1-0 to make it four games unbeaten without conceding a goal while Bordeaux stayed unbeaten with a 1-0 victory at Toulouse."
51,12/05/2016,16:34,Dortmund sign rising French star Dembele,"Borussia Dortmund signed France's young player of the year Ousmane Dembele from Rennes on Thursday, the German club fighting off strong English Premier League interest in the teenage forward.","Dortmund called the 18-year-old ""one of Europe's most sought after talents"" in a statement announcing the transfer on a five-year contract. The Bundesliga side did not give a figure for the deal, but German media said the fee was in the region of 15 million euros (£11.8m, $17.1m). British media had earlier reported that Liverpool were ready to offer £28 million for the France under-21 international, who was voted Ligue 1's young player of the year last weekend. Dembele, born in Normandy, has been a revelation for Rennes this season, scoring 12 goals and and five assists since making his debut in November. ""Ousmane can play nearly every position in attack,"" Dortmund's sporting director Michael Zorc told the club's website. ""He is strong one-on-one, he can play with both feet, he is good at nutmegging and dribbling, and he is fast and dangerous in front of goal."" Dortmund have been tracking the young talent for a long time. ""BVB showed a lot of interest in me right from an early stage and they have always kept close contact with me - this really impressed me,"" said Dembele, who came close to leaving Rennes last summer before making a single top-team appearance. ""I can hardly wait to play in the Bundesliga in front of more than 80 000 spectators in the Signal Iduna Park and to walk onto the pitch in the Champions League with my new team-mates,"" he added. News of his signing emerged 48 hours after Bayern Munich prised away Dortmund's captain, Germany centre-back Mats Hummels."
52,28/04/2016,11:40,PSG chasing Ligue 1 points record against Rennes,"French champions Paris Saint-Germain continue to tick off their remaining league fixtures as they welcome Rennes to the capital on Friday night, knowing that a win would equal their own Ligue 1 points record.","Laurent Blanc's men made it three French League Cup triumphs in a row last weekend, despite being reduced to 10 men, thanks to Angel Di Maria's winner against Lille. Now they will turn their attention back to the league, where they are 27 points clear at the top of the table with just four matches to play. PSG have just one game left this season of any real importance, the French Cup final against arch rivals Marseille at the Stade de France on May 21, although they need just four more points to break the Ligue 1 record of 89 that they set in 2013-14. The only disappointment for the club this season was the Champions League quarter-final exit at the hands of Manchester City, but Qatari chairman Nasser Al-Khelaifi quashed speculation about coach Blanc's future by saying that he would stay at the club next term. Some of the PSG players, including Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Javier Pastore, were allowed to go on holiday to Las Vegas after the French League Cup win. Rennes coach Rolland Courbis though brushed off any thoughts that the weekend trip could affect their performance or fitness levels on Friday. ""Given that they have had three days' rest, I have other things to do than to judge PSG players and they had permission to go to Las Vegas,"" he told sports daily L'Equipe. ""I would have preferred them to have just played in the Champions League semi-finals, or to have just played a Ligue 1 game like Lille and Angers (on Wednesday), but we are not in charge. ""After their three days' rest, they can do what they want."" Rennes have dropped out of the race for Champions League qualification after picking up just one point in their last three matches, although Courbis still thinks that a top-six finish and a possible Europa League place are within his side's grasp with three games to go. ""Two wins could be enough to finish sixth, which would be much better than seventh,"" Courbis, whose team sit one point behind sixth-placed Lille, added. ""The minimum target for our last three games against PSG, Montpellier and Bastia is six points. ""We must stay professional and not let go when there is still something we can achieve, and that something is sixth. It's not easy, but it's not impossible."" It will be tough for Rennes to pick up one of their two targeted victories at the Parc des Princes, where PSG have lost just once in 37 league matches. Having said that, the Brittany club have only been defeated twice in their last eight Ligue 1 trips to the capital. German goalkeeper Kevin Trapp is likely to return in place of Salvatore Sirigu for PSG, with Di Maria and Ibrahimovic looking to cap off a week in which they were both nominated for the Ligue 1 Player of the Year award. Courbis has said that striker Kamil Grosicki is a doubt with a muscle problem, while Fallou Diagne is suspended."
53,18/03/2016,22:41,Rennes run riot against crisis club Marseille,Rennes moved provisionally into third place in Ligue 1 with a stunning 5-2 win at Marseille on Friday that plunged their hosts into full-blown crisis mode.,"The visitors were 3-0 up inside 14 minutes at the Stade Velodrome thanks to goals from Yoann Gourcuff, Fallou Diagne and Ousmane Dembele. Florian Thauvin and Jorge Rolando scored to bring Marseille back into the match but Gourcuff struck again and Giovanni Sio rounded off a remarkable Rennes victory in a tense atmosphere. The win takes Rennes, who have lost just once in seven matches, into the final Champions League qualifying berth in Ligue 1, a point clear of Nice and two ahead of Lyon before they play later this weekend. Meanwhile, Marseille continue to stagnate in mid-table and a run of seven league games without a win increases the pressure on Spanish coach Michel. Marseille ultras had decided to use the first quarter of an hour of the game to protest against the way the club is being run and their team's miserable record of not having won in 12 home league games since September, the worst such run in their history. However, by the time 15 minutes were up, their team's chances of ending that sequence were dead and buried. Gourcuff opened the scoring when he fired home from a Sio cutback for his first goal since returning for a second spell at Rennes, the club where he began his career -- his last goal for the Brittany side had come exactly a decade ago, on March 18, 2006. Defender Diagne escaped his marker to head home a Kamil Grosicki free-kick before teenage sensation Dembele, one of the hottest properties in European football, saw his shot deflected in to make it 3-0. At that point, tensions were rising in the stands and Marseille's Florian Thauvin was struck by a plastic bottle thrown from the crowd as riot police intervened to keep the calm. The threat of a terrace revolt was eased as Thauvin curled one in to reduce the deficit in the 20th minute, and defender Rolando poked home a second goal for OM early in the second half after Rennes goalkeeper Benoit Costil dropped a corner. Remy Cabella then hit the post from a Javier Manquillo cutback but a rare mistake by Marseille goalkeeper Steve Mandanda -- one of the few impressive performers in Michel's side this season -- allowed Rennes to score again just before the hour mark. Mandanda let a Gourcuff shot slip under his grasp for Rennes' fourth goal and Sio rubbed salt into Marseille's wounds when he converted the visitors' fifth after being superbly set up by Dembele. Lyon are at home to Nantes on Saturday while Nice face struggling Gazelec Ajaccio on Sunday before champions Paris Saint-Germain, who secured the title last weekend, entertain second-placed Monaco at the Parc des Princes."
54,04/03/2016,02:20,PSG focus on Chelsea ahead of Montpellier visit,Paris Saint-Germain head into Saturday's clash at home to a resurgent Montpellier with most eyes firmly fixated on next week's return leg at Chelsea in the last 16 of the Champions League.,"PSG rebounded from losing their 46-game unbeaten domestic run at Lyon last weekend by remaining on course to defend their French Cup crown after beating Saint-Etienne 3-1 in midweek. However, victory at the Stade Geoffroy-Guichard potentially came at a cost with midfielder Blaise Matuidi facing a race against time to be fit for Wednesday's trip to Stamford Bridge. The France international was seen clutching his hamstring after he was taken off ""as a precaution"" midway through the second half, with Laurent Blanc admitting he was ""worried"" about Matuidi's fitness. Blanc will have to decide whether or not to rest key players ahead of the Chelsea clash, with Marco Verratti (groin) and Angel Di Maria (thigh) also struggling with injuries. The PSG boss though was pleased with the manner in which the runaway Ligue 1 leaders responded at Saint-Etienne after suffering their first defeat of the season. ""We can't erase (the loss), but we can use it to our advantage. That's what we did (on Wednesday) and I'm very happy about it. It was a good way to respond after the defeat which provoked quite a buzz,"" said Blanc, in quotes published by French daily L'Equipe. ""Montpellier will be a difficult match because we'll be thinking about the game against Chelsea which will be huge,"" said PSG captain Thiago Silva, with 2012 French champions Montpellier arriving in the capital on the back of three straight wins to pull clear of relegation trouble. ""We're ready for Chelsea. I think everyone knows what awaits us over there. I hope (Matuidi) will be able to play because he's an important player for the team,"" the Brazilian added. Defeat at Lyon means Paris can't clinch a fourth straight French title this weekend, but they could do so next week should Monaco slip up at fellow European hopefuls Caen on Friday. Monaco have lost just once in 15 league outings and have an eight-point cushion over Caen, who trail third-place Lyon on goal difference, in the race for the second automatic Champions League qualifying berth. Four wins in five has reignited Lyon's campaign and Bruno Genesio's side will bid to build on recent momentum when Guingamp visit Parc OL in Sunday's late game. A four-match winless run has slowed Nice's European charge, but they will fancy their chances of ending that series at home to bottom side Troyes on Saturday. Rennes and Nantes, unbeaten in the league since November, meet in the Brittany derby with both sides also firmly in the hunt for Europe, while Saint-Etienne travel to slumping Angers. Pascal Dupraz will embark on the daunting task of trying to salvage Toulouse's top-flight status having replaced Dominique Arribage ahead of Sunday's trip to Marseille. Toulouse are 10 points from safety and without a win in eight, but there is hope as Marseille have struggled mightily at the Stade Velodrome with just two wins all season and none in their last 11 home fixtures.

Since joining the Soweto-based outfit in 2013, Erasmus scored 13 goals in 51 games for the Pirates.

58,20/01/2016,13:12,Controversial Courbis takes reigns at Rennes,"French outfit Rennes, sixth in Ligue 1, sacked their coach Philippe Montanier on Wednesday and replaced him with the controversial journeyman Rolland Courbis.","The sacking comes a day after Rennes were knocked out of the French Cup by second tier Bourg-en-Bresse and a week after 62-year-old Courbis joined Rennes as an advisor to the club president Rene Ruello. While the club were sixth in Ligue 1 they had failed to win any of their previous ten home games. Courbis, who coined the 'Zizou' nickname for Zinedine Zidane while coaching at Bordeaux, has also handled Marseille, Montpellier, Toulouse, Ajaccio and Toulon in the French top flight. The larger-than-life Courbis once enjoyed a jet-set lifestyle with an Italian Countess, and the two were banned from all casinos in France in 1990 after a major win at the tables was followed by a fraud trial. Courbis was also shot in the gangland slaying of Corsican underworld character Dominique Rutily in 1996 in a car park at Hyeres, the killers were never found. A transfer scandal at Marseille also caught up with him and he was sentenced to 21 months in jail, before early released in February 2010 after five months, albeit wearing an electronic bracelet. So famous is he in France that he had his own puppet in the long running Canal Plus satyrical tv show 'Les Guingnols', which was similar to Britain's 'Spitting Images'.

He joined Porto from Italian club Pescara in 2013, while his new deal includes a 40-million-euro ($43.5 million) release clause. Quintero has 13 caps for Colombia but was left out of coach Jose Pekerman's final 23-man squad for last year's Copa America.

60,12/01/2016,14:06,Gourcuff feared more injury woe after team-mate clash,Injury-plagued Rennes midfielder Yoann Gourcuff admitted he feared the worst following a nasty collision with a team-mate during Saturday's 2-2 draw with Lorient as he made his first appearance in 10 months.,"The France playmaker, who rejoined Rennes in November, came on as a substitute 15 minutes from time, but was left with bruising to his ankle and knee after he was clattered by Cheikh Mbengue in stoppage time as both players attempted a shot. ""Yes, I was very scared because it was a violent collision and the situation was an unlikely one, but it's nothing serious and the tests have been reassuring,"" said Gourcuff, who was officially presented to the media on Tuesday. Gourcuff, who won the last of his 31 France caps in June 2013, added he was ""rather moved and surprised"" by the reception he received from Rennes fans after replacing Juan Fernando Quintero. He added: ""It's always important and appreciated when you feel supported by the fans. But at the same time I felt a bit awkward because I'm quite a reserved person. I was almost a little embarrassed by the reception I got."""
61,06/11/2015,23:18,Rennes end seven-match winless streak,"Rennes ended a seven-match winless streak with a 2-0 victory at Angers on Friday, topping off a week which had already seen France playmaker Yoann Gourcuff return to his boyhood club.","Rennes were ahead after just four minutes when Abdoulaye Doucoure finished off a fine move between Sylvain Armand and Giovanni Sio. Gelson Fernandes added the second goal on the hour mark after Angers failed to clear a corner. The win moved Rennes into sixth place in Ligue 1, 12 points behind leaders and champions Paris Saint Germain while Angers are fourth, 10 points off the pace. Earlier this week, Rennes signed former French international Gourcuff who was a free agent. The 31-times capped midfielder had already agreed in September to return to the club where he began his career but had not yet pen to paper."
62,02/11/2015,19:12,Rennes complete signing of Gourcuff,"Rennes have formalised the signing of France playmaker Yoann Gourcuff, who was a free agent, a source close to the club said on Monday.","The 31-times capped midfielder had already agreed in September to return to the club where he began his career but had not yet pen to paper. Gourcuff, 29, is expected to begin training on Tuesday but he may not make a first-team appearance until 2016 as he recovers from injury. ""I am very happy. I hope to be back on the field very soon and to be able to enjoy myself. I don't know when I will play again, we'll see, I miss being on the pitch,"" Gourcuff said in an interview with newspaper Ouest France. Gourcuff's five-year spell at Lyon was marred by injuries and he left the Stade de Gerland in the summer when his contract expired. He has since been recovering from a stress fracture in his foot and had insisted he did not want to rush back. Gourcuff, who won the last of his 31 caps in June 2013, started his career at Rennes before moving to AC Milan in 2006 and later joining Bordeaux, with whom he won the French title in 2009."
63,29/10/2015,18:01,Rennes betting on upset against dominant PSG,"Unbeaten Paris Saint-Germain will go 10 points clear at the top of Ligue 1, at least for 24 hours, with a win against Rennes in Brittany on Friday.","The capital club's imperial domestic form in recent times has raised the question of whether anyone can beat them in Ligue 1 this season ahead of a match brought forward to help Paris prepare for their trip to Real Madrid in the Champions League next week. Laurent Blanc's side were streets ahead of Saint-Etienne -- seen as contenders for a top-three finish -- in a 4-1 stroll at the Parc des Princes last Sunday. They are currently seven points clear of second-placed Angers and have gone 22 matches without losing in all competitions since being beaten by Barcelona in the Champions League quarter-finals last April. In Ligue 1, their unbeaten run covers 20 games going back to March, and few give Rennes, or anyone, a chance of ending that record right now. ""Against PSG, I get the impression that players from other teams go onto the pitch with a feeling of resignation,"" former Lyon, Paris and France goalkeeper Gregory Coupet told leading sports daily L'Equipe this week. ""For example, on Sunday for PSG v Saint-Etienne, we try to talk it up as a big match, but well...you could see that they were just trying to avoid getting hammered. ""It feels like when clubs face PSG they go into the game knowing already they won't get one point never mind three."" However, Rennes could be helped by the number of leading names missing from the Paris squad that departed for Brittany on Thursday, with David Luiz, Marquinhos, Javier Pastore and Edinson Cavani all missing. Blanc may be tempted to rest some players ahead of the Madrid clash but Zlatan Ibrahimovic should start in attack with the Swede having scored seven goals in his last five league games. Rennes have gone six games without a league win, although a strong line-up secured a 1-0 victory at Bastia in the League Cup on Tuesday. ""They are superior to us in every area,"" said Rennes coach Philippe Montanier, although he remains hopeful of causing an upset. ""In one match everything is possible. If someone wants to become rich they should put a euro on us."" Angers are in action on Sunday away to Monaco, who are unbeaten in seven games and beginning to look like the side that finished third last season. Caen, currently in third, visit struggling Bastia on Saturday, while Lyon are away at winless bottom side Troyes as they seek a confidence-boosting win ahead of a crucial Champions League clash against Zenit St Petersburg. Saint-Etienne are at home to Reims as they look to bounce back from a punishing trip to Paris, and Marseille travel to Nantes on Sunday evening. Before that, Nice will seek to get back on track after a shock loss to struggling Gazelec Ajaccio when they face Lille on the Cote d'Azur. Claude Puel's side had scored 17 goals in recording four straight wins prior to that, inspired by the superb form of Hatem Ben Arfa, who is now being linked with a France recall. ""I am not going to question Hatem's quality and his talent,"" France coach Didier Deschamps told Eurosport as he refused to rule out naming the mercurial playmaker for next month's friendly matches against Germany and England. ""Why not? I will think about it based on what he has done with Nice,"" added Deschamps of Ben Arfa, who has had a chequered career but has scored seven Ligue 1 goals this season.

64,04/10/2015,19:28,"Monaco held by Rennes, Caen beat Saint-Etienne","Monaco's stuttering early-season form continued as they were held to a 1-1 draw at home to Rennes in Ligue 1 on Sunday, while Caen rose to third after beating Saint-Etienne.","Rennes, whose terrific start has somewhat subsided after a fourth draw in a row, took a first-half lead at the Stade Louis II through Abdoulaye Doucoure. But Monaco fought back after the break with Brazilian Wallace scoring his first goal in the French top flight to salvage a point for Leonardo Jardim's men, who also had Danijel Subasic to thank for a second-half penalty save. The principality side have now won just three of nine matches to start the campaign and sit tenth in the table, seven points behind Paris Saint-Germain ahead of their clash with bitter rivals Marseille later. Rennes broke the deadlock four minutes before the break when Monaco were caught short at the back as Doucoure slipped in between Andrea Raggi and Thomas Lemar to head past Subasic. Monaco responded six minutes into the second half as Nabil Dirar flicked on a Lemar corner with Wallace applying the finishing touch. Rennes should have regained the lead on 64 minutes after Fabinho brought down Cheikh M'Bengue in the area but Pedro Henrique saw his spot-kick kept out by Subasic. Rennes also suffered the loss of winger Paul-Georges Ntep, who was stretchered off with a hamstring injury midway through the second half - probably ruling him out of international duty with France next week. Elsewhere, Caen registered a fourth win in five as Andy Delort's 62nd-minute goal was enough to give them all three points against Saint-Etienne as Les Verts slumped to a second successive defeat, having entered the weekend in second. The result left Patrice Garande's men level with promoted Angers, just two points behind three-time reigning champions PSG. Lorient rallied from a goal down to beat Bordeaux 3-2 with Benjamin Moukandjo, Majeed Waris and Zargo Toure all on target for the hosts after Diego Rolan had given Willy Sagnol's men a first-half lead. Both teams finished with 10 men as Lorient's Lamine Gassama and Bordeaux's Andre Biyogo Poko were dismissed near the end before Adam Ounas pulled one back for the visitors."
65,14/09/2015,18:02,France international Gourcuff joins Rennes,"France international midfielder Yoann Gourcuff has joined Rennes on a one-year deal, a source close to the club said Monday.","The 29-year-old, who left Lyon at the end of last season, is not yet fit to play, however, due to a foot injury that is still healing. Once considered France's brightest young star and heir to Zinedine Zidane, Gourcuff spent five difficult seasons at Lyon blighted by injuries following a 22 million-euro transfer from Bordeaux, where he won the Ligue 1 title. Several teams had expressed interest in the former AC Milan player once he left Lyon but Gourcuff insisted on signing a one-year contract and refused to do so until sure he would regain full fitness. As such he now joins the club where he began his career in 2003 before moving to Italy three years later. Gourcuff has played 31 times for France, scoring four goals, and played at the 2010 World Cup, although he has rarely been picked since 2011."
66,29/06/2015,17:08,Ivorian striker Sio joins Rennes,"Ivory Coast striker Giovanni Sio has signed a three-year deal with Rennes, the French Ligue 1 club announced on Monday.","The 26-year-old joins from the Swiss champions FC Basel, although he spent the second half of last season on loan in France with Corsican club Bastia. Sio, who was born in France, started out at Rennes' local rivals Nantes and had spells in Spain and Germany before moving to Basel. He is Rennes' third summer signing after the arrivals of Lens defender Ludovic Baal and former Aston Villa midfielder Yacouba Sylla, who had been playing in Turkey with Kayseri Erciyesspor."
67,20/02/2015,17:59,Austria striker Hosiner has kidney removed,"Austrian international striker Philipp Hosiner, of French Ligue 1 club Rennes, revealed on Friday that he has had his left kidney removed after a tumour was detected during a medical.","The 25-year-old had been set to join German Bundesliga club FC Cologne on loan last month but failed a medical when the problem was spotted. ""I returned to Austria and I had an operation last week,"" the player said. ""Everything went well but my left kidney had to be completely removed. ""As my other kidney is perfectly healthy, it will have no effect on my footballing career. I will be back in a few months."" Hosiner was the leading scorer with Austria Vienna in 2013 as they won the Austrian title but he has struggled to make an impression since joining Rennes last summer."
68,07/02/2015,18:27,Marseille squander chance to go top,Marseille stretched their undefeated run at Rennes to seven games on Saturday but a laboured 1-1 draw meant they squandered the chance to go top in France.,"Marcelo Bielsa's side are one point behind leaders Lyon who tackle champions and third-placed Paris Saint Germain in the weekend's standout fixture on Sunday. In a depressing summary of Marseille's afternoon, they finished the game in Brittany with 10 men after Mario Lemina was red-carded for a foul on Ola Toivonen. Swedish striker Toivonen was a thorn in Marseille's side all afternoon. The 28-year-old gave Rennes the lead after 26 minutes, smartly chesting down a loose ball to score past Steve Mandanda in the visitors' goal. Marseille were saved when Lucas Ocampos, the Argentine signed on loan from Monaco in the last moments of the transfer window, found the net in the 59th minute after coming on as a half-time substitute. The winger was handily placed to score from a corner taken by Dimitri Payet."
69,30/01/2015,22:29,PSG edge Rennes to close gap on Lyon,Ezequiel Lavezzi scored the only goal as champions Paris Saint-Germain edged Rennes 1-0 on Friday to maintain their undefeated Ligue 1 home record and cut the gap on leaders Lyon to just one point.,"The win was PSG's sixth consecutive home win in all competitions while stretching their Ligue 1 record at the Parc des Princes to eight wins and three draws. However, Lyon, who face PSG in 10 days' time, can restore their four-point lead with victory at Monaco on Sunday. Lavezzi grabbed the decisive goal after 29 minutes after a neat interchange of passes down the left between Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who was involved twice, Adrien Rabiot and Javier Pastore. Argentine star Lavezzi, who has been linked with a move to Liverpool before the transfer window shuts on Monday, was then on hand to tuck the ball past Benoit Costil in the Rennes goal for his third goal of the season. Rennes may have gone into Friday's game having not won a game in Ligue 1 since December 3 but they had defeated PSG 2-1 on their last visit to the capital in May. They showed they would not be intimidated by the champions and came close to an equaliser moments later. Pastore played a poorly-weighted back pass which was intercepted by Abdoulaye Doucoure. The midfielder was clean through but his tame shot was well saved by an alert Salvatore Sirigu in the PSG goal. Five minutes after the interval, it was the turn of Costil to keep his team in the hunt. Brazilian defender Marquinhos found Edinson Cavani with a neat pass which dissected the Rennes backline but the Uruguayan striker was denied his 17th Ligue 1 goal of the season by a fine diving save from Costil. Cavani missed another close-range opportunity before he was hauled off by manager Laurent Blanc. At the other end, Sirigu kept PSG's advantage intact with a save from Christian Bruls after Lavezzi had given the ball away."
70,13/12/2014,22:56,"Lucky Nantes down Bordeaux, Bastia beat Rennes","A freak own goal helped Nantes to a 2-1 win over Bordeaux, struggling Bastia beat Rennes and a brace from Brazilian Diego Rigonato helped Reims past Evian in Ligue 1 action on Saturday.","Nantes ended their three-match losing run thanks to Jordan Veretout's opener, cancelled out by Kian Hansen's own goal. In the 66th minute Bordeaux's young Slovenian reserve keeper Azbe Jug haplessly scored the decider when the ball, rebounding off a post, struck him on the head and ended up in his own net. Nantes remain seventh with Bordeaux in fifth, on 31 points, one behind Saint-Etienne who face Nice on Sunday. Also on Sunday Paris Saint-Germain are at lowly Guingamp and leaders Marseille are at south coast rivals Monaco. Sixth-placed Rennes were thwarted 2-0 at Bastia, playing much of the game a man down after Fallou Diagne's 26th minute red card. A first half stoppage time goal from Ryad Boudebouz and Yannick Cahuzac's effort nine minutes from time earned Bastia a precious fourth win of the season. They climbed one place into third from bottom, on 17 points, one behind Guingamp. Reims' Brazilian midfielder Rigonato scored either side of the break in Reims' pulsating defeat of Evian, while on a high-scoring day in the French top flight Lens came from behind to salvage a 3-3 draw at Montpellier. On Friday, Ligue 1's leading scorer Alexandre Lacazette grabbed a brace as Lyon beat bottom club Caen 3-0 to make it eight consecutive home wins."
71,29/10/2014,23:03,Marseille dumped out of League Cup,"French Ligue 1 leaders Marseille were eliminated from the League Cup at the first hurdle on Wednesday, conceding in the last minute to lose 2-1 at Rennes.","OM are four points clear at the top of the league but saw their run of eight consecutive wins ended in a 1-0 reverse at Lyon last weekend and coach Marcelo Bielsa opted to rotate his squad for the trip to Brittany. Bielsa made six changes to his starting line-up, with Michy Batshuayi getting his chance up front as Andre-Pierre Gignac was rested. And the young Belgian striker gave the visitors the lead in the 19th minute at the Stade de la Route de Lorient to put Marseille seemingly on course for a berth in the last 16. However, Anders Konradsen headed in the equaliser from inside the six-yard box on the hour and Austrian forward Philipp Hosiner then diverted the ball into the net in injury time to take Rennes through. That winning goal came after Brice Dja Djedje and Paul-Georges Ntep were sent off following a clash as tempers flared, leaving both teams to end the game with 10 men. Earlier on Wednesday, Metz eliminated Nice on penalties after squandering a 3-0 lead to draw the match on the Cote d'Azur 3-3. Along with the winners of Tuesday's ties, Rennes and Metz progress to the last 16 in December, when France's six European representatives -- including holders Paris Saint-Germain -- will enter the draw."
72,28/09/2014,19:24,Bordeaux keep pressure on Marseille,"Bordeaux went provisionally back to the top of the Ligue 1 table on Sunday, striking late to beat Rennes 2-1 and leapfrog leaders Marseille.","Willy Sagnol's side have surprised many with their excellent start to the campaign, although it looked like they would have to settle for a point when Wahbi Khazri's opener for the hosts was cancelled out by a Habib Habibou equaliser with just 10 minutes remaining. However, youngster Thomas Toure, who until three days ago had not started a Ligue 1 game, scored his first goal at the highest level in style in the third minute of added time to give Bordeaux the points. The six-time champions move a point clear of Marseille, although Marcelo Bielsa's side will have the chance to regain first place when they host Saint-Etienne later on Sunday. ""The players never gave up. They were cooked at the end, but they kept looking for the winner into the final minutes,"" said a delighted Sagnol. ""They can be proud but they also know that there is work to be done in terms of the performance."" Elsewhere, Lyon made it four games unbeaten but threw away the lead in a 1-1 draw away to Nantes at the Stade de la Beaujoire. Burkina Faso defender Bakary Kone headed in Alexandre Lacazette's free-kick to put OL ahead six minutes into the second half, but he then shoved Georges-Kevin Nkoudou to the ground inside the box, allowing Jordan Veretout to level from the penalty spot in the 72nd minute. Sunday's other game saw Lens draw 0-0 with fellow promoted club Caen at their temporary home in Amiens. On Saturday, Paris Saint-Germain were held to a 1-1 draw at Toulouse, their fourth draw in their last five matches meaning that they will not go into Tuesday's Champions League showdown with Barcelona in the best shape. France's other Champions League group stage representative Monaco suffered a fourth loss in just eight league games this season, falling 1-0 at home to Nice in the Cote d'Azur derby, while there were wins for Lille, Metz, Montpellier and Evian."
73,13/09/2014,20:17,PSG miss chance to go top in Brittany,Paris Saint Germain missed the chance to take provisional top spot in Ligue 1 on Saturday with a 1-1 draw at Rennes putting a dampener on preparations for next week's Champions League action.,"The two-time defending champions have nine points from five games and now see their second spot under threat from the chasing pack while leaders Bordeaux, on ten points, can pull further ahead as they travel to lowly Guingamp on Sunday. It was a third draw in three outings for PSG who had opened the scoring two minutes before the break through a rare goal from defender Zoumana Camara. But a slipup by Camara allowed the hosts get a share of the points as Cameroon striker Paul-Georges Ntep got one past PSG goalkeeper Salvatore Sirigu after 55 minutes. The visitors only had one other clear chance on goal through Swedish international Zlatan Ibrahimovic in the first half. ""I would have preferred not to score and to win the match,"" admitted Camara. ""It's not worrying. It's a draw. There's nothing alarming about that. Now we have to recover because the Champions League is Wednesday. It's going to be something else, that's for sure."" Laurent Blanc's side now have a busy schedule with six more games in the next three weeks, with their Champions League campaign beginning at Ajax next Wednesday. ""We really wanted to score a second goal but everything was against us,"" said Blanc with skipper Thiago Silva still sidelined while David Luiz suffered a knee knock playing for Brazil and Serge Aurier needs extra tests after losing consciousness during a clash of heads playing for the Ivory Coast. Rennes move up to third, a point behind PSG. Lyon, meanwhile, got back to winning ways on Friday with a 2-1 home win against Monaco. Nabil Fekir opened the scoring after 30 minutes for the hosts before Lucas Ocampos equalized nine minutes later. Corentin Tolisso's goal after 73 minutes ended a three-game losing streak for new coach Hubert Fournier, as Monaco sit 16th after five games, ahead of Tuesday's Champions League game at home against Bayer Leverkusen. The win lifted Lyon to 12th place, four points behind leader Bordeaux, as they prepare to play at Paris Saint-Germain next week."
74,10/08/2014,19:03,Lyon get campaign off to winning start,Seven-time French champions Lyon began their Ligue 1 campaign in fine style as they defeated Brittany club Rennes 2-0 at the Stade Gerland on Sunday.,"As the opening weekend of the French season reached it's conclusion, with just last season's runners-up Monaco set to host Lorient in the final match later Sunday, Caen were the early frontrunners on goal difference after their 3-0 win at Evian on Saturday. Lyon, who won their titles consecutively from 2002 and 2008, opened the scoring in their first league match under new coach Hubert Fournier with a strike from 34-year-old midfielder Steed Malbranque after 64 minutes. French international Alexandre Lacazette, who scored 23 goals last season, made the points safe from the penalty spot with 16 minutes left. Champions Paris Saint-Germain were held to a 2-2 draw at Reims in the Ligue 1 curtain raiser on Friday while Marseille were pegged back in a 3-3 draw at Bastia 24 hours later in a match marred by crowd trouble. There were also opening day wins for Saint-Etienne, Bordeaux, Nice and Nantes while Champions League hopefuls Lille, who drew Porto in the final qualfiying round, were held to a 0-0 stalemate at home by Metz."
