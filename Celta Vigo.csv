0,08/02/2021,23:08,Suarez strikes twice but Atletico stumble against Celta,Atletico Madrid slipped up in La Liga for the first time in nine games on Monday as Celta Vigo snatched a late equaliser to deliver a ray of hope to Barcelona and Real Madrid.,"Luis Suarez scored twice at the Wanda Metropolitano to overturn Santi Mina's opener for Celta, with Atletico on course to restore their 10-point lead at the top of the table. Instead, Facundo Ferreyra slid in to score in the 89th minute to earn a deserved 2-2 draw for the visitors, meaning Atletico's advantage at the end of the weekend is reduced to eight, still with a game in hand. It remains a large cushion but after Madrid and Barca beat Huesca and Real Betis respectively, there is at least room for encouragement for the chasing pack. Real Madrid can cut the gap to five points if they win at home to Getafe on Tuesday. Suarez shows no sign of letting up, the Uruguayan now with 11 goals in his last nine games and 16 for the season. Those 16 goals in 17 games played for Atletico makes him the fastest player to score that many for one La Liga club in the 21st century, one game faster than Cristiano Ronaldo after he joined Real Madrid. Celta were the better side in the first half, dominating possession and taking a deserved lead after 13 minutes when Hugo Mallo curled in a cross from the right for Mina to head in. Atletico rarely troubled Celta but managed to go in level, Suarez scoring with their first shot on target. Marcos Llorente's driven cross evaded four sets of Celta toes and found him at the back post. Lucas Torreira came on at half-time for Felipe -- Atletico reverting to a back four -- and within five minutes they were ahead. Geoffrey Kondogbia floated a ball out to the left and Renan Lodi volleyed it across goal, where the sliding Suarez arrived on his knees to finish. Celta almost had a second when Iago Aspas bundled through but Kondogbia darted back to make a superb tackle, just as the striker was about to shoot. Atletico were moments away but caved with one minute left, a brilliant through ball by Aspas freeing Augusto Solari, whose cross found Ferreyra two metres out."
1,05/01/2021,21:38,Ibiza dump Celta Vigo out of Copa del Rey,"Third-tier outfit Ibiza claimed a dramatic 5-2 win over Celta Vigo on Tuesday to reach the last 32 of the Copa del Rey for the second straight year, while Sevilla saw off Linares.","Ibiza were only formed in 2015 and lost 2-1 in the third round of Spain's domestic Cup competition last season to Barcelona, having led with less than 20 minutes to play. They made no mistake in dumping out top-flight opposition this time around, racing into a 3-0 half-time lead over Celta, helped by two goals from Sergio Castel. The island club moved further in front just after the hour through Manu Molina's penalty, but the visitors showed their La Liga class as they launched a comeback. Santi Mina and Scottish midfielder Jordan Holsgrove scored in the final 12 minutes. But Mina missed the chance to make it 4-3 from the penalty spot in the first minute of injury time and Ibiza netted again through Angel Rodado shortly afterwards. Europa League holders Sevilla had little trouble in beating third-division Linares 2-0. Villarreal, sitting fourth in La Liga, also cruised past third-tier Zamora, winning 4-1 with Colombian striker Carlos Bacca scoring his first domestic goal of the season. Top-flight Getafe also bowed out to a third-tier side, losing 1-0 at Cordoba, who were in La Liga as recently as 2015."
2,02/01/2021,23:56,Real Madrid beat Celta to take Liga top spot,Real Madrid jumped to the top of La Liga on Saturday with a 2-0 home victory over in-form Celta Vigo.,"Lucas Vazquez headed in a cross from Marco Asensio at the far post in the sixth minute, barely a minute after Real centre back Nacho had cleared a shot by Celta striker Iago Aspas off the line. He returned the favour in the 53rd minute, laying a diagonal ball into the path of Asensio with the visiting defence in disarray. Asensio drove his shot into the roof of the net. ""We said before the game that if we counter-attacked we could do damage and that's how it turned out,"" said Asensio. Real rebounded from a draw with promoted Elche on Wednesday to move one point clear at the top of the table, but second-place Atletico Madrid have played three fewer games and can regain the lead when they face Alaves on Sunday. ""After the draw in Elche we wanted to show aggression,"" said Vazquez. With Real Madrid in control, coach Zinedine Zidane took off Asensio, Luka Modric, Dani Carvajal, Toni Kroos and, right at the end, captain Karim Benzema and brought on Eden Hazard and Fede Valverde, who are returning from injuries, and youngsters Martin Odegaard and Vinicius Junior. ""Today we played well from the first minute until the end,"" said Zidane. ""There is a lot of the season left and we have to keep going."" It was Celta's first loss since Eduardo Coudet took over as manager on November 12, ending a run of seven games unbeaten that had lifted them from the relegation zone to eighth in the table. ""We generated very little for the amount of possession we had,"" said Coudet. Earlier, Sevilla, who could have climbed to third, were fortunate to escape with a 1-1 draw at neighbours Betis. Suso opened the scoring for Sevilla after 48 minutes. Sergio Canales replied with a penalty after 53 minutes. When the home team won another spot kick in the 75th minute, Nabil Fekir took it but Sevilla goalkeeper Yassine Bounou saved. French international Fekir has not managed a goal or an assist in three months. Sevilla dropped to fifth behind Villarreal, who beat Levante 2-1."
3,01/01/2021,20:28,In-form Celta and veteran Aspas eye Real Madrid shock,"Real Madrid will attempt to hang onto the coattails of La Liga leaders and city rivals Atletico on Saturday when they tackle in-form Celta Vigo and Iago Aspas, the veteran striker who leads the Spanish scoring charts this season.","Zinedine Zidane's side lost ground in the title race when they were held to a 1-1 draw by Elche in midweek. Atletico, however, defeated Getafe 1-0 and have a two-point lead as well as two games in hand. Since the arrival of 46-year-old Argentine coach Eduardo Coudet, Celta have soared from the edge of the relegation zone to eighth in the table. That turnaround has been achieved on the back of a run of six wins, a draw and just one loss in their last eight games. Celta are just two points behind Barcelona. Aspas, 33, has been instrumental for Celta with nine goals in La Liga this season. He even leads the top scorers charts with one more goal than Real's Karim Benzema and two ahead of even Barcelona superstar Lionel Messi. ""Aspas is spectacular, he's also an international,"" said Zidane of a player who once spent two seasons on Liverpool's books. ""He has always proved it, he is very good. He's the kind of player who makes a difference. He's a key player for them."" Atletico's victory in midweek came in coach Diego Simeone's 500th match in charge. They face 13th-placed Alaves on Sunday looking for a fourth consecutive win. Key will be Luis Suarez who grabbed the winner against Getafe, taking his goals total to eight for the season. Third-placed Real Sociedad, six points off the top, host Osasuna on Sunday. Barcelona, 10 points behind Atletico, ended a mediocre 2020 on Tuesday with a 1-1 draw against Eibar. They start 2021 on Sunday with a trip to bottom club Huesca. Messi, who missed the game with Eibar with a right ankle injury, enters the new year with just six months left on his contract and more questions than before over his future plans. Barcelona suffered another setback on Friday when they announced Philippe Coutinho will need surgery to treat the injury to the lateral meniscus of his left knee. ""Once the surgery has been completed, further information will be provided to detail the approximate expected recovery time,"" said a club statement. Coutinho suffered the injury against Eibar."
4,09/11/2020,12:10,Celta Vigo sack Garcia after miserable start to season,"Celta Vigo have sacked Oscar Garcia as coach, the club confirmed on Monday after a poor start to the season.","Celta drew 1-1 away at newly-promoted Elche on Friday to make it seven matches in a row without a victory. They have won only once in La Liga since the start of the season and sit 17th, a point above the bottom three. Garcia was appointed in November last year but failed to pull the team away from a relegation scrap, even if survival was secured on the final day. ""Oscar Garcia and his coaching staff will no longer be in charge of Celta,"" the club said in a statement."
5,01/11/2020,23:43,Silva off the mark as Real Sociedad go back to top of La Liga,David Silva scored his first goal for Real Sociedad on Sunday to help them go back to the top of La Liga after a 4-1 win over Celta Vigo.,"Silva headed La Real in front at Balaidos for his first goal since he left Manchester City in the summer, and his first in La Liga since he departed Valencia 11 years ago. Mikel Oyarzabal made it two with his fifth of the season, a tally that also makes him the league's top scorer so far. Willian Jose then hit the net twice in the second half, either side of Iago Aspas converting a penalty, which gave Celta brief hope of a comeback. Celta's Jose Fontan was sent off for a second yellow card late on, to cap a disappointing afternoon for the home side, who sit 17th, without a win in six games. But another impressive victory for Real Sociedad means they have won their last four league games on the bounce, with scorelines of 3-0, 3-0, 4-1 and 4-1. They return to the top of the table, one point ahead Real Madrid, who had temporarily taken first place after their 4-1 win over Huesca on Saturday. Atletico Madrid are third, three points off the leaders but with two games in hand. Valencia, meanwhile, avoided a fourth straight defeat by drawing 2-2 at home to Getafe but could easily have lost or won the game after a wild finish at Mestalla. Leading 1-0 through a goal from Yunus Musah, Valencia were reduced to 10 men when Thierry Correia was sent off just before the hour. They conceded in the 87th minute when Juan Camilo Hernadez equalised for Getafe, who then looked to have snatched a victory when Angel scored again in the 94th minute. But Valencia hit back in the 10th minute of injury-time, Carlos Soler converting a penaly to ensure they at least went away with a point. Getafe's Damian Suarez was also shown a red card in the 98th minute to add to the mayhem. Getafe slip to eighth while Valencia stay 13th. Real Betis had earlier beaten Elche 3-1 to climb to seventh. Elche drop to 10th."
6,17/10/2020,18:55,Suarez leads Atletico to Celta win but Costa injured ahead of Bayern test,Luis Suarez partnered Diego Costa for the first time and scored as Atletico Madrid beat struggling Celta Vigo 2-0 win in La Liga on Saturday.,"But the Suarez-Costa combination came to an early end as Costa was forced off injured in the second half. Sitting in the stands, Costa was seen with his face in his hands and he was also hobbling after the final whistle. He is now likely to miss Atletico's Champions League opener away at Bayern Munich on Wednesday. Atletico climb to fourth, two points behind early leaders Real Madrid and one ahead of Barcelona, after the win. Celta, meanwhile, have managed only one win from their first six games and sit 13th. This was a much-needed victory for Atletico after back-to-back goalless draws had dampened enthusiasm following their 6-1 opening win against Granada. Suarez made his debut that day, coming off the bench to score twice when Granada were already down and out, but his early strike shaped this game against Celta, until Yannick Carrasco headed in a second in injury-time. Diego Simeone had kept Suarez and Costa apart by using one to substitute the other in each of Atletico's first three matches but he paired them together from the start at Balaidos, with Joao Felix on the bench. Costa predicted last month they would be handful together, saying ""it will be good, one bites, the other one kicks."" There were flickers of chemistry, with Suarez missing a chance for a second from the Costa pass that caused him to feel pain in his lower leg. ""He's important because of his career and what he has done at Atleti,"" said Suarez. ""We try to adapt to each other despite never having played together before."" Felix also impressed when he came on and will provide a more creative, if less combative, foil for Suarez in Costa's absence. After replacing the injured Costa after half-time, it was Felix's curling shot that hit the bar, allowing Carrasco to nod in the rebound. Suarez had earlier put Atletico in front in the sixth minute, sweeping in after 20-year-old left-back Manu Sanchez picked him out with a clever pull-back. There was also a debut for Lucas Torreira, the Uruguayan signed on loan from Arsenal, who was energetic and tidy in central midfield, despite feeling some cramp late on."
7,04/11/2019,21:14,Celta Vigo hire Garcia after dismissing Escriba,"Celta Vigo have appointed Oscar Garcia as coach until the end of the season, a day after the Spanish La Liga outfit parted company with Fran Escriba.",The 46-year-old former Barcelona player has won league titles with Maccabi Tel Aviv and Red Bull Salzburg and takes Celta to the Nou Camp to play La Liga leaders Barca on Saturday. The Catalan coach takes over at Celta with the Atlantic coast outfit third bottom on nine points after 12 games having lost four on the bounce.
8,21/09/2019,20:48,Creativity lacking again as Atletico held by Celta,Atletico Madrid missed the chance to return to the top of La Liga on Saturday as they were held to a goalless draw at home to Celta Vigo.,"After coming from two goals down to salvage a point against Juventus in the Champions League on Wednesday, Atletico failed to sustain the momentum in a match of few chances at the Wanda Metropolitano. Atletico had capitalised on the stumbling starts of both Barcelona and Real Madrid by winning their opening three league games this season but they are now two without a victory, following last weekend's shock defeat away at Real Sociedad. They sit level on points with early frontrunners Sevilla, who will host Real Madrid on Sunday. Celta, meanwhile, sit 14th in the table, having won only one of their five games so far, leaving Atletico's coach Diego Simeone with familiar questions to answer about his side's creativity and attacking threat. Summer signing Joao Felix started before being replaced by Alvaro Morata in the second half, the Spanish striker available again after recovering from a knee injury. But neither Felix nor Morata, or their partner Diego Costa, could conjur up the decisive opening, with full-backs Renan Lodi and Kieran Trippier by far the team's most effective outlets in the final third. Atletico were the better side in the first half but only created a handful of chances, none of which could be classed as clear opportunities. Trippier's early free-kick should have been headed in by Felipe Monteiro on his first start for the club but Ruben Blanco did well to react from five yards and push the ball over the crossbar. Ruben made another smart save to deny Lodi's driven effort from 30 yards while Felix found space at the back post soon after but his prodded finish was also tipped away. Celta held their own either side of half-time as the match became increasingly high on intensity but low on quality. Costa wanted a penalty after the hour, claiming he was pushed after failing to make contact with Lodi's cross while Brais Mendez might have scored for Celta had Jan Oblak not been quick to shut down Santi Mina's superb ball through. Lodi fizzed a late shot past the far post but desperation turned to frustration in the closing stages. Lucas Olaza and Costa each picked up a yellow card for a skirmish after the final whistle."
9,03/09/2019,00:15,Barcelona's Rafinha joins Celta on loan,"Barcelona forward Rafinha has joined Celta Vigo on loan until the end of the season, the clubs announced on Monday.","Rafinha spent a year on loan at Celta in 2013-14 and will rejoin the Galician side in the hope of being given more opportunities to play. Barca have also extended Rafinha's contract to prevent the Brazilian being able to leave on a free next summer. ""FC Barcelona and the Rafinha player have reached an agreement for the renewal of his contract until the end of the 2020/21 season,"" Barca said in a statement. ""Likewise, FC Barcelona and Celta have reached an agreement for the transfer of the player for the 2019/20 season."" Celta will pay Rafinha's contract and could owe Barcelona a further 1.5 million euros in potential add-ons. Brought through at Barcelona with his brother Thiago Alcantara, who is at Bayern Munich, Rafinha's career has been interrupted by serious knee injuries in 2015, 2017 and 2018. He has also struggled for minutes under Ernesto Valverde and looked set for another season on the fringes, behind the likes of Lionel Messi, Luis Suarez, Antoine Griezmann and Ousmane Dembele. Celta called it a ""particularly exciting return"" and said Rafinha, who grew up in Vigo, would add ""enormous quality, versatility, commitment and enthusiasm""."
10,17/08/2019,19:22,Bale returns to and Madrid get back to winning ways at Celta,Zinedine Zidane promised changes but it was a retro Real Madrid that gave the revolution a winning start on Saturday as Gareth Bale led the way in a 3-1 victory over Celta Vigo.,"Bale was back in the team and back in form at Balaidos, with Zidane's eagerness to move him out this summer still perhaps in his mind as he teed up Karim Benzema's opening goal. Celta saw a potential equaliser chalked off before half-time. Then Real's Luka Modric was sent off 11 minutes inti the second half but a stunning 30-yard shot from Toni Kroos put Madrid firmly back in control. By the time Lucas Vazquez added a delicious third, at the end of a silky passing move, it was possible to wonder where this Madrid have been for the last 12 months, particularly as this starting line-up included not a single summer signing. Zidane wanted Paul Pogba but it was Casemiro, Modric and Kroos in midfield, the same trio he picked for the Champions League final in 2018. The coach also started Marcelo, arguably Madrid's worst performer last term, and Bale. Only last month Zidane had said it would be ""best for everyone"" if the Welshman were sold. Eden Hazard, who injured his thigh in training on Friday, will certainly start when he is fit again and there will be much tougher opponents than Celta, who finished 17th last season and were dead and buried before Iker Losada delivered a late consolation. But, after a poor pre-season, Zidane needed a positive opening. This one was made all the sweeter by Barcelona's defeat by Athletic Bilbao on Friday night. Celta spent much of the match feeling aggrieved, no more so than after Benzema scored after just 12 minutes. The home team claimed a foul by Casemiro in the build up. After that, Bale still had a lot to do, his dart one way and then the other freeing space for a drive towards the near post, where Benzema reacted fastest. Early on, Bale was everywhere, blocking a cross in his own penalty area before being unleashed on the break, his rasping shot pushed away by Ruben Blanco. Celta also had their moments. Gabriel Fernandez's lunge was just short at the back post. Brais Mendez tapped in after the impressive Denis Suarez robbed Alvaro Odriozola and Iago Aspas made the final pass. Aspas, however, had strayed offside as VAR spared Odriozola's blushes. The referee, Javier Estrada, departed to a chorus of whistles at half-time. Benzema and Aspas both spurned chances soon after the restart before Modric was sent off for an innocuous late challenge on the heel of Suarez. Estrada consulted the review and was left in no doubt. Nestor Aruajo headed the ball straight at Thibaut Courtois but just as Madrid seemed about to give way, Kroos produced his thunderbolt from 30 yards, the ball cannoning down off the crossbar and in. That knocked the stuffing out of Celta. They went three down when a brilliant team move, involving Isco, Benzema and Marcelo, found Vazquez free at the back post. Bale had been replaced by Isco, exchanging a hand slap with Zidane as he went, before Losada prodded home in injury-time."
11,16/08/2019,14:38,Hazard to miss Madrid opener against Celta through injury,"Eden Hazard will miss the start of the season after sustaining a thigh injury in training on Friday, the day before Real Madrid's La Liga opener against Celta Vigo.","Hazard was ready to make his debut in Vigo after joining Madrid for an initial 100 million euros from Chelsea in June. But the Belgian pulled up with a minor strain at the club's training base in Valdebebas and is now expected to be out for three to four weeks. ""After tests carried out after training today on our player Eden Hazard by the Real Madrid Medical Services, he has been diagnosed with a muscular injury to the anterior part of his right thigh,"" a club statement read. ""His recovery will continue to be assessed."" Madrid begin away at Celta on Saturday before facing Real Valladolid and a trip to Villarreal ahead of the international break. Hazard could be in line to return for their match against Levante at the Santiago Bernabeu on September 1. His absence comes as a blow to Madrid's coach Zinedine Zidane, who will be hoping for a positive start after some disappointing performances in pre-season. Zidane is already without Ferland Mendy, who has a calf injury, and Marco Asensio, who is likely to be out for several months after rupturing his anterior cruciate ligament."
12,01/07/2019,08:33,Barcelona midfielder Denis Suarez returns to Celta,"Barcelona midfielder Denis Suarez has agreed to move back to his boyhood club Celta Vigo on a four-year deal, the Spanish champions said.","Celta Vigo, based in Spain's northwestern Galicia region, will pay the Catalan giants 12.9 million euros ($14.7 million) plus 3.1 million euros in variables, Barcelona said in a statement late on Sunday. ""Barcelona would like to publicly express its gratitude to Denis Suarez for his commitment and dedication and wish him every bit of luck and success in the future,"" it said. The 25-year-old came through Celta Vigo youth academy before moving to Manchester City aged 17 but he never played a competitive game for the Premier League side. He left the English club for Barcelona in 2013. After a season with Barcelona's reserve team and another year on loan at Sevilla, the former Spain Under-21 international joined Villarreal on a permanent deal. He returned to Barcelona in 2016, this time to the Catalan club's first team but failed to find a regular spot on the starting lineup. Suarez went on loan to Arsenal in January but his second spell in England ended prematurely due to injury."
13,17/05/2019,02:15,Valencia seek perfect end to remarkable recovery in La Liga,Valencia lost to Arsenal in the Europa League semi-finals but hold pole position for La Liga's last Champions League spot as the race for the top four reaches its climax on Saturday.,"Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang's hat-trick ended Valencia's hopes of qualifying by lifting a trophy and their chances looked slim in the league too, when they trailed Getafe by three points ahead of the penultimate weekend. But a 3-1 win over Alaves, combined with Getafe losing away to a wounded Barcelona, means it is Valencia with their fate in their own hands, as they prepare to face Real Valladolid at Jose Zorrilla. A superior head-to-head over Getafe means they need only match the result of Jose Bordelas' side, who host a Villarreal team sitting 14th and with little left to play for. Yet Valladolid's position appears in Valencia's favour too. Victory away at Rayo Vallecano last weekend means their safety is already secured. Win, and Valencia will be guaranteed Champions League football in consecutive seasons for the first time in seven years, a feat that not too long ago seemed almost unthinkable. After five games, they were 15th and still to win. After 10, they were 14th, having won once and scored seven goals. After 15 games, they had won three but were back in 15th, ground to a halt by nine draws. When Marcelino was appointed in 2017, he was the club's 12th coach in five years and only one of them -- Nuno Espirito Santo -- had overseen enough matches to make even one full league season. Most waited for the trigger to click but Marcelino stayed and after 10 draws in 13 games, they won, coming from behind in the Copa del Rey to beat Segunda B side Ebro, who had a man sent off after 29 minutes. ""There was this click,"" said striker Kevin Gameiro in an interview with AFP this month. ""And there was also a bit of luck."" Defeats by Girona, Juventus and Real Madrid tempered hopes of a recovery but in between came three victories in a row and after, five games unbeaten, including a Champions League win over Manchester United. Eighth in the table at the start of the year, Valencia then surged through March and April, 10 wins thrusting them within sight of the top four. ""The word surrender does not exist in my vocabulary,"" said Marcelino. They stumbled again, twice, defeated last month by Atletico Madrid and Eibar, the resurgence almost evaporating in the space of four days. But their rivals wobbled too as Getafe lost their nerve and Sevilla faded, the bounce from bringing in Joaquin Caparros to replace Pablo Machin proving short-lived. Sevilla's decision to act has them lying sixth, needing to win at home to in-form Athletic Bilbao on Saturday and needing both Valencia and Getafe to lose. Valencia's decision to persevere may be about to pay off, a top-four finish the perfect boost ahead of the Copa del Rey final on May 25 against Barcelona, who will be without Luis Suarez and perhaps goalkeeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen. ""The spirit of the team has merged with the spirit of Valencia, which is always: never give up,"" said striker Rodrigo earlier this month. For Getafe, the Europa League would be a disappointment, even for a team who were promoted to the top flight only two years ago and whose annual wage bill is more than ten times less than Real Madrid, the club they hope to finish one place behind. ""Everything can still happen,"" said Bordalas. Getafe have a chance, which is perhaps more than can be said for Girona, whose players and coach Eusebio Sacristan conceded their loss at home to Levante last weekend had been decisive in the fight against relegation. ""All that's left is to say sorry,"" said an emotional Eusebio afterwards. ""I was convinced I could do it but I failed."" They are 18th, needing to make up three points and a six-goal deficit in goal difference to overtake Celta Vigo on the final day. Celta have the added advantage of hosting already-relegated Rayo Vallecano while Girona play at Alaves. Barcelona's title-winning campaign will end away at Eibar on Sunday just as Real Madrid's miserable season finishes at home to Real Betis."
14,04/05/2019,23:11,Under-strength Barca beaten by Celta,Barcelona rested all 11 players that started against Liverpool in the Champions League but paid the price on Saturday as they were beaten 2-0 by struggling Celta Vigo in La Liga.,"Lionel Messi, Luis Suarez and Philippe Coutinho were all among those left out ahead of the return at Anfield on Tuesday but Barca were not unscathed, after Ousmane Dembele hobbled off early in the first half. The club later confirmed Dembele sustained a hamstring injury and will undergo tests on Sunday but it seems unlikely the Frenchman will be fit to face Liverpool in the semi-final second leg. Dembele missed almost four months with a hamstring strain last season and suffered from problems in the same area in January and March, sitting out for another month each time. Defeat will hardly trouble Barcelona, who wrapped up their 26th La Liga title last weekend, but victory comes as a major boost for Celta, who move five points clear of the bottom three with two games left to play. Real Valladolid and Girona, both just beneath them, may feel disappointed by Ernesto Valverde's team selection, particularly given his side took six and four points off them respectively this season. The result also means Rayo Vallecano are relegated after they were thrashed 4-1 by Levante earlier on Saturday. Rayo needed Celta, the only team they could catch, to lose all three of their remaining matches. Barcelona will now quickly turn their attention back to Liverpool, who at the same time on Saturday were playing Newcastle in the Premier League, making only four changes to their own line-up from the side that lost 3-0 at Camp Nou on Wednesday. Liverpool won 3-2 but Mohamed Salah was stretchered off in the second half. Barca's changes created the strange spectacle of Celta giving a guard of honour to youngsters like Jean-Clair Todibo, Carles Alena, Moussa Wague and Riqui Puig before kick-off. Dembele lasted only six minutes and was replaced by Alex Collado, the 20-year-old midfielder thrown on for his first-team debut. Puig was perhaps the most impressive of the fledglings and he teed up Barca's best chance in the first half but Wague's shot was well saved by Ruben Blanco. Celta came on strong in the second 45 and thought they had taken the lead when Gustavo Cabral's header was palmed out by Jasper Cillessen to Nesto Araujo, who finished. Araujo was shown by VAR to have been a fraction offside. But Celta did not have long to wait. In the 67th minute, with Todibo off injured, Barca were briefly down to 10 and Maxi capitalised, brilliantly volleying in Ryad Boudebouz's cross in at the near post. There was still time for one more in the 88th minute as VAR spotted a handball by Wague in the area and Aspas converted to confirm a crucial win. Atletico Madrid had earlier missed the chance to ensure they finish above Real Madrid for a second consecutive year after they slipped to a surprise 3-0 defeat by Espanyol. Atletico needed only a point to guarantee second place in La Liga, with two games left to play, but Espanyol were deserving winners at the RCDE Stadium thanks to Diego Godin's own-goal and two strikes from Borja Iglesias, the second a penalty. ""The first goal changed the game, the second one made us worse,"" said Atleti coach Diego Simeone. ""Espanyol were deserving winners. They were better and they had more chances,"" he added. Real Madrid face Villarreal on Sunday but a third-place finish seems inevitable. To overtake their city rivals, Real will need to win all three of their remaining games and hope Atletico lose both of their last two."
15,16/03/2019,18:31,Bale and Isco give Zidane winning start against Celta,Zinedine Zidane brought Real Madrid's outcasts in from the cold and they repaid him with a win in his first game back as Isco and Gareth Bale each scored in a 2-0 victory over Celta Vigo on Saturday.,"Isco had not started a single La Liga game under Santiago Solari but opened the scoring here shortly after the hour, before Bale got the goal his own committed display deserved to put sorry Celta out of sight. Bale was teed up by Marcelo, who was also dropped by Solari but recalled, while Keylor Navas pulled off a superb save in the first half, having been brought back ahead of Thibaut Courtois. Even Marco Asensio has been almost anonymous through Madrid's troubles this season and he seemed rejuvenated too, his weaving run leading to the opener from Isco, who was otherwise the quietest of Zidane's recovering group. The victory ends a run of four consecutive home defeats and means Madrid reduce the gap to nine points behind Barcelona, who play away at Real Betis on Sunday. That deficit will surely prove too big to close but Zidane's job is to restore morale in the 11 league games that are left and to find out what, and who, needs changing in the summer. At times, this felt like a pre-season fixture, not just because of the baking hot sun but the relaxed atmosphere and the sense this is now a team on trial. Bale, whose relationship with Zidane deteriorated to breaking point last season, was arguably the biggest winner, his performance proving there could yet be a place for him in what the club's president Florentino Perez has dubbed ""the glorious new era"". Marcelo impressed too while Courtois might well wonder what his next couple of months hold, given Navas, an old favourite of Zidane, looks to be back in favour. Zidane had enjoyed his press conference on Friday, joking with journalists about their changed hairstyles and smirking as he admitted he had given the same answers before. There was a cosy feeling at the Santiago Bernabeu too, where fans had a new song to the tune of 'Hey Jude', replaced by 'Zizou', and cheered their new coach's name when it was announced before kick-off. Bale came closest to scoring in the first half with an acrobatic scissor-kick that crashed against the crossbar and later teed up Karim Benzema to tap in, only for the referee to book the Welshman for a foul in the build-up. In between, Madrid were rather muted, but dominant in possession. Marcelo pulled back for Isco, who slipped, and then watched his fizzing shot from distance pushed away by Ruben Blanco. Toni Kroos' effort grazed the roof of the net and from a corner, Sergio Ramos headed wide. Celta found chances on the break but never looked liked converting. Maxi Gomez, with only Ramos to beat, curled wide while Sofiane Boufal's finish had to be blocked on the line by Marcelo as Madrid were again caught upfield. Benzema's goal was ruled out just before half-time and Luka Modric had one chalked off just after, this time VAR intervening to show Raphael Varane offside and close enough to be deemed active. Isco's influence had diminished and Dani Ceballos was ready to replace him just before he scored the opening goal. Asensio made it, a superb run allowing Benzema to cross and Isco to bundle in. There was still time for Bale to add a second, his touch making space for the shot after Marcelo had slipped him clear. The ball clipped the post and rolled in."
16,13/11/2018,18:17,New Celta Vigo coach Miguel Cardoso slips-up at his unveiling,New Celta Vigo manager Miguel Cardoso made one of the worst mistakes possible as he was unveiled as the club's new coach on Tuesday.,"As Cardoso was introduced as Antonio Mohamed's replacement the Portugese boss said ""A big thank you to the president, a big thank you to the sport management staff for believing in me and my technical staff in starting a new project at Club Deportivo... Celta Vigo."" The 'Club Deportivo' slip-up by Cardoso refers to Celta's long-standing local rivals in Deportivo La Coruna. To add to the situation the 46-year-old is a former member of Deportivo's coaching staff, working with his current club's bitterest of enemies during the 2012-13 season. After attempting to regain Celta's fans' faith after his embarrassing blunder his next challenge will be to lift the confidence of his squad who sit in 14th place in La Liga with only one victory in their last ten games across all competitions. His first fixture in charge of the Galicians is set to be the trip to Real Sociedad on November 25 after the international window."
17,12/11/2018,23:22,Celta appoint Cardoso after sacking Mohamed,"Spanish league strugglers Celta Vigo sacked Argentinian coach Antonio Mohamed and replaced him with Portugal's Miguel Cardoso, the club said Monday.","Mohamed, 48, arrived at Celta in the summer but has registered three wins, five draws and four defeats so far, including a decisive 4-2 defeat to Real Madrid on last weekend. Mohamed becomes the second Argentinian coach to face the chop from La Liga after Leo Franco was sacked by Huesca. Cardoso, 46, takes the reins at Celta barely six weeks after being sacked by French Ligue 1 side Nantes, with whom he won just one game, drawing three and losing four in his opening eight games in charge."
18,12/11/2018,14:22,Spanish press call for Solari appointment as permanent Real Madrid coach,The Spanish press have called for the permanent appointment of Santiago Solari as Real Madrid coach after an unbeaten run as interim boss of the 13-time Champions League winners.,"According to Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) rules, Real's period of 14 days to either select Solari full-time or to find another coach to replace Julen Lopetegui comes to an end on Monday but Solari's appointment does not seem to be imminent. Since taking over on October 29 Solari has guided the European Cup holders to four victories in as many matches including Sunday's impressive 4-2 La Liga display at Celta Vigo. Lopetegui was dismissed after an embarrassing 5-1 defeat at arch-rivals Barcelona, his fourth loss in the last of his five La Liga games in charge. Newspapers were unanimous in support of the 42-year-old who has lifted Real up three places to sixth in the table in the space of a fortnight. AS said ""Solari deserves to continue (as manager) after 15 goals in four matches."" Marca said the lack of an official announcement showed the club had abandoned the idea of an external replacement for Lopetegui in favour of Solari. And Catalonia-based Sport had ""Real players extend Solari's contract"" as their headline on Monday. Real's next fixture and possibly Solari's maiden match as long-term boss is the trip to Eibar in La Liga on November 25, following the international break."
19,11/11/2018,23:41,Madrid 'very happy' with Solari - Butragueno,Real Madrid director Emilio Butragueno has said the club are delighted with Santiago Solari's spell in charge after the team posted their fourth consecutive win by beating Celta Vigo on Sunday.,"Madrid claimed a 4-2 victory at Balaidos and the expectation is Solari will now be given the job full-time, following a transformation in results. Four victories during his tenure have brought 15 goals scored and just two conceded while Real have cut the gap behind Barcelona to four points in La Liga. The win over Celta was the club's last fixture before Solari's two weeks as an interim coach ends during the international break. ""He has done excellently,"" Butragueno said on Sunday. ""He arrived in a very particular moment and has achieved very good results, above all today against Celta in a very difficult game. We are very happy with how things have gone."" Butragueno would not confirm whether Solari's position would be made permanent but it is likely the Argentinian will remain in the post, at least until the end of the season. ""We will see,"" Solari said. ""I usually don't plan too far ahead but in principle, it's my day off tomorrow. ""The important thing is to do everything for the good of the team and Real Madrid. Nothing else is important for me."" Madrid defender Alvaro Odriozola said the players are behind Solari. ""These things are decided by those at the top, we just have to work to get out of the crisis,"" Odriozola said. ""We'll go to the death with him, he's a great coach and of course we want him to continue."" Madrid dominated a chaotic match against Celta that featured three goals and a red card in the final 10 minutes. Karim Benzema scored a brilliant opener before instigating a second, his shot cannoning in off Gustavo Cabral. Hugo Mallo pulled one back for the hosts in the second half but Sergio Ramos chipped in a late penalty to put the result beyond doubt and Cabral was sent off for receiving a second yellow card. Dani Ceballos' stunning effort made it four, with Brais Mendez adding a late Celta consolation. ""The team showed a lot of personality to come through all the circumstances of the game,"" Solari said. Madrid suffered a spate of injuries as Casemiro, Sergio Reguilon and Nacho were all forced off. Gareth Bale took a knock to his left ankle in the first half but was able to continue. ""Gareth made a massive effort, his ankle was very swollen,"" Solari said. ""Celta played very aggressively, on the edge of the rules."""
20,11/11/2018,23:24,"Barca suffer first league home defeat in two years, Real boost Solari hopes","Barcelona lost at home in La Liga for the first time in more than two years as Real Betis pulled off a stunning 4-3 victory on Sunday, despite Lionel Messi scoring twice on his return from injury.","Barca last endured a league defeat at the Camp Nou against Alaves in September 2016 but, following 42 games unbeaten, their run was ended by a brilliant, counter-attacking display from Betis. Three hours later, Real Madrid were putting the finishing touches to a 4-2 win away at Celta Vigo, a result expected to earn Santiago Solari an extension to his tenure as coach. Real have now posted four consecutive victories since Solari was put in temporary charge while the gap behind Barca has been reduced to four points. ""He has done excellently,"" Madrid club director Emilio Butragueno said afterwards. ""We are very happy with how things have gone."" On his future, Solari said: ""We'll see. I don't usually plan too far ahead but in principle, it´s my day off tomorrow."" Barca's shock defeat came despite a return for Messi, whose two goals, one from the penalty spot and another deep into injury-time, proved little more than consolations. ""We don't leave with the feeling Betis were the better team,"" coach Ernesto Valverde said. ""I don't want to take any credit away from our opponent but we could have countered them better."" It was the first time ever that Messi scored twice and Barcelona lost, but they stay top of the table, even if three clubs now lurk just one point behind. Atletico Madrid, whom they face at the Wanda Metropolitano after the international break, Sevilla and Alaves lead the chasing pack. Alaves beat Huesca 2-1 earlier on Sunday, while Sevilla won by the same scoreline at home to Espanyol, Wissam Ben Yedder prodding in an 89th-minute winner. ""Top of the table is fine, I won't deny it,"" Valverde said. ""It should also help us to realise it is never easy to win."" Betis' reward for beating Barca is to climb to 12th. Quique Setien's side may have pulled back on the sumptuous, attacking football that earned them a sixth-place finish last term but, in full flow, they remain one of Spain's most difficult opponents to stop. ""We have been a brave team in every way,"" former Spain international Joaquin said. ""Winning at the Camp Nou requires concentration and doing everything very well. We played a great game."" Betis seemed faster, sharper and hungrier while Barcelona's midfield was repeatedly carved open on the break. It took five passes for the opener, the last a first-time drive from William Carvalho to free Junior Firpo down the left. He weaved inside Sergi Roberto and struck hard into the net. Barca had chances but Betis were soon pouring forward again, with Junior's cross evading everyone except Giovani Lo Celso on the opposite flank. His cute cut-back picked out Joaquin, who stabbed in Betis' second. Arturo Vidal replaced the jaded Arthur Melo at half-time and, in the 68th minute, Barca pulled one back, with Jordi Alba tugged down by Cristian Tello, and Messi converting the penalty for his eighth league goal of the season. But the recovery stalled three minutes later as Marc-Andre ter Stegen let Lo Celso's shot slip through his fingers and drop into the far corner for 3-1. Barca were not done yet. Two substitutes combined for a second, Munir El Haddadi laying on Vidal but no sooner had the comeback begun again, it was halted. First, Ivan Rakitic was sent off, a second yellow card for a late challenge on Lo Celso, and then Sergio Canales tapped in Betis' fourth from Junior's cross. Messi added his second in injury-time but there was to be no more late drama. Madrid's win was more straightforward as Karim Benzema opened the scoring, a sublime touch and turn making space for a crisp finish into the corner. Benzema's shot then cannoned in off Gustavo Cabral before Hugo Mallo's sweet volley gave Celta hope. Sergio Ramos, however, chipped in a late penalty, Cabral was sent off for a second yellow card and Dani Ceballos wrapped up the points with a superb long-range strike. Brais Mendez scored a second for Celta in injury-time. The only blot for Solari was a spate of injuries which saw Casemiro, Sergio Reguilon and Nacho all forced off. Gareth Bale also took a knock to his left ankle in the first half but was able to continue."
21,07/10/2018,21:41,Sevilla move top of La Liga after defeating 10-man Celta Vigo,Sevilla moved top of La Liga and pushed Real Madrid down to fourth after beating 10-man Celta Vigo 2-1 on Sunday.,"Pablo Sarabia headed in to open the scoring before Celta defender Nestor Araujo was sent off for picking up two yellow cards in as many minutes. Wissam Ben Yedder doubled Sevilla's lead shortly after the hour-mark and while substitute Sofiane Boufal pulled one back for Celta, it proved too little to late. The victory is Sevilla's fourth in a row and means they move one point above Atletico Madrid, and two clear of Real Madrid and Barcelona. Barcelona, however, play Valencia later on Sunday. ""At the the moment we are playing with a lot of confidence,"" Ben Yedder said. ""We are showing we can be consistent."" Atletico had earlier continued their own strong run after Angel Correa's goal proved decisive in an untidy 1-0 win over Real Betis. Atletico sat seven points behind Real and Barca after winning only one of their opening four league games but as their rivals have stumbled, Diego Simeone's side have sprung into form. This was Atleti's fifth win in six in all competitions, with their only dropped points coming in a stalemate away to Real Madrid. ""We look at everything quietly and continue to improve,"" Simeone said. ""We have grown."" Simeone can take some of the credit too for this victory at the Wanda Metropolitano, after throwing on both Correa and Thomas Partey as substitutes in the second half. Thomas provided the assist. ""When the players respond, the coaches look better,"" Simeone said. ""The teams that challenge up the top of the table are there because of the players they can bring off the bench."" The contest was billed as a classic clash of styles, with Atletico's stubborn defence up against the free-flowing Real Betis, who lit up the league last season with their flurry of goals. It is testament to the threat they pose that opponents have become more cautious this season and Atletico were successful here in their strategy of absorb and counter-attack. ""A great coach once said, the best Plan B is always to do Plan A better,"" said Betis coach Quique Setien. They could also have gone top with a win, such is the scrunched nature of the top half, but instead Betis stay seventh. ""We have less points than our performances deserve,"" Setien added. Diego Costa was missing with a thigh injury, allowing Nikola Kalinic to make his first start since joining from AC Milan in August. There was a lack of width and clear thinking in the first half although Betis had the best chance early on. Loren Moron raced through a rare gap in the Atletico defence but the ball got stuck under his feet and he skewed wide. Atletico posed a threat on the break but repeatedly fluffed the final pass. Kalinic struck the post early in the second half after Aissa Mandi gave it away, before Rodrigo lashed a shot at Pau Lopez. Simeone flapped his arms to beckon the home crowd ane Atleti were finding their rhythm as Antoine Griezmann pulled back for Kalinic and then Correa fired across goal but neither Griezmann nor Diego Godin turned it in. Correa, on for the quiet Thomas Lemar, had made a difference with his direct running and he deserved his goal in the 74th minute. Thomas flicked it into his path and with no better option, the forward drove low into the bottom corner. Betis pushed in the latter stages but there was little hint of an equaliser. Atletico held on."
22,05/05/2018,23:42,Villarreal boost Europa League hopes with late win over Valencia,Villarreal moved to within touching distance of qualifying for the Europa League after Mario Gaspar scored a late winner to beat rivals Valencia on Saturday.,"Gaspar headed in Manuel Trigueros' free-kick in the 86th minute at Estadio de la Ceramica to secure a dramatic 1-0 win over Valencia, who have also sealed their place in next season's Champions League. Valencia's place in the top four was guaranteed even before kick-off after Real Betis had earlier lost to Athletic Bilbao. Villarreal's victory means they will be guaranteed to finish in La Liga's top seven if Getafe, in eighth, fail to beat Las Palmas on Sunday. This season, the team that finishes seventh in the table will also qualify for the Europa League, as well as fifth and sixth, after Barcelona won the Copa del Rey. Valencia had the better of the chances in the first half but Santi Mina missed a one-on-one with Sergio Asenjo and they were made to pay the price. Trigueros swung in a cross from the left and Gaspar rose highest at the front post, flicking the ball with his head into the far corner. Villarreal could still finish fifth after Athletic Bilbao beat Betis thanks to two goals in the final 15 minutes from Iker Muniain and Aritz Aduriz. Celta Vigo's chances of playing European football next seasona are all-but over after they were held to a 1-1 draw by already-relegated Deportivo La Coruna. Girona's hopes were also diminished by a 4-1 defeat at home to Eibar."
23,11/01/2018,23:48,Messi puts on masterclass for watching Coutinho,Lionel Messi put on a masterclass in front of new recruit Philippe Coutinho as Barcelona trounced Celta Vigo 5-0 Thursday to ease into the Copa del Rey quarter-finals 6-1 on aggregate.,"Coutinho, dressed in a black shirt dotted with white stars, was in the stands at the Camp Nou for the first time since his 160 million-euro ($192 million) move from Liverpool. It didn't take long for the Brazilian star to appreciate the playing riches on show on the pitch. Level at 1-1 after the first leg, the three-time defending champions were 4-0 up by half-time. Messi grabbed the opening two goals in the 13th and 15th minutes, both finished with a sublime first touch with his left foot, both created by Jordi Alba. Messi then returned the favour by setting up Alba to score past the hapless Sergio Alvarez in the Celta goal before Luis Suarez made it 4-0 on the night after 30 minutes when the Uruguayan burst through the defence. The tie petered out in the second half but French international Ousmane Dembele showed why Barcelona paid 105 million euros for him last year when he dribbled past three defenders from the halfway line before being denied by a desperate tackle. Dembele did have time to set up the fifth goal of the night three minutes from the end when his corner was headed home from close range by an unmarked Ivan Rakitic. ""It's luxury to have Leo in the side, he's the best in history. We always look for each other to score goals and today we have done it twice,"" said Alba. Earlier Thursday, Espanyol overturned a 2-1 loss in the first leg to defeat Levante 2-0 with Leo Baptistao and Gerard Moreno on target either side of half-time. Sevilla also progressed with a 2-1 win at home to second-tier Cadiz for a 4-1 aggregate. Wissam Ben Yedder, after 31 minutes, and Joaquin Correa in the 54th minute, were on target for Vincenzo Montella's team. On Wednesday, Real Madrid laboured to a 2-2 draw with Numancia to progress to the quarter-finals 5-2 on aggregate. In a much-changed side, Lucas Vazquez scored both of Real's goals after the 11th and 59th minutes. But on both occasions, their modest visitors fought back thanks to a brace from Guillermo on the stroke of half-time and then after 82 minutes. Numancia ended the game with 10 men after captain Dani Calvo was red-carded in the dying moments. Leganes, a modest club from the Madrid suburbs, reached the quarter-finals for the first time in their 89-year existence. Despite losing 2-1 at Villarreal, who are currently sixth in La Liga, Leganes progressed on away goals having won the first leg 1-0. Moroccan international Nabil El Zhar scored the crucial away goal for mid-table Leganes on the half-hour mark."
24,01/12/2017,11:03,Five things to look out for in La Liga,Barcelona look to extend their four-point lead at the top of La Liga against an old friend turned foe in Celta Vigo coach Juan Carlos Unzue on Saturday.,"Meanwhile, Real Madrid travel to a struggling Athletic Bilbao with their eyes firmly on one of Athletic's rising stars. Here, AFP Sport looks at five things to look out for in La Liga this weekend. Gareth Bale's emergence off the bench to save a faltering young Real side from embarrassment against third-tier Fuenlabrada in the Copa del Rey earned the Welshman rave reviews in the Spanish press on Wednesday. Marca declared Bale had been handed a ""fresh start"" after a year dogged by a series of injuries. Yet, he could be absent again at San Mames due to a niggling calf problem having missed training for the past two days. Unlike Bale, Keylor Navas didn't help Madrid on his return to action after six weeks out by turning Fuenlabrada's opener into his own net in midweek. Kiko Casilla was also at fault for Malaga's second goal at the Bernabeu last weekend, intensifying Real's search for a new goalkeeper. According to reports, the new man will be Athletic's Kepa Arrizabalaga, who has been one of few shining lights in a hugely disappointing season for Bilbao. Arrizabalaga didn't feature as the Basques did suffer Cup humiliation at the hands of tiny islanders Formentera on Wednesday, edging coach Jose Angel Ziganda closer to the sack. Unzue returns to the Camp Nou hoping to continue Celta's record of beating Barca once in each of the three previous seasons when he was assistant to Luis Enrique. Celta's daring approach against the Catalans in recent years has though had mixed success. Whilst they have twice hit Barca for four at home, in their last two visits to the Catalan capital Celta have been smashed 6-1 and 5-0. Las Palmas are looking for already their third coach of the season after Pako Ayestaran was sacked on Thursday. Ayestaran was only appointed in September when Manuel Marquez resigned. How the Islanders must wish they had held on to the man they will face this weekend back when Quique Setien brings Real Betis to the Canary Islands. Setien not only kept Las Palmas up in the previous two seasons, but did so thanks to some thrilling attacking football. That has continued at Betis, whose 13 La Liga games this season have produced 50 goals. However, contractual differences with the board saw Setien walk out in the summer and left Las Palmas in the lurch. Valencia kept their unlikely title challenge alive by holding Barca at home last weekend. That point came at a cost, thought, as PSG loanee Goncalo Guedes suffered a broken toe that is expected to keep the Portuguese winger out for the rest of the year. Guedes's three goals and five assists have played a huge part in Valencia's revival. However, a kind fixture list during Guedes's absence offers Valencia hope with a visit to Getafe on Sunday followed by Celta, Eibar and Villarreal before the winter break."
25,11/05/2017,23:04,Nervy Man United reach Europa League final,Manchester United survived a nervy last few minutes to reach their first Europa League final after a 1-1 draw with Celta Vigo.,Jose Mourinho's team went through 2-1 on aggregate following last week's 1-0 win in northern Spain. Marouane Fellaini had given United a first half lead with a header but Facundo Roncaglia gave Celta hope with a header five minutes from time. Roncaglia and United's Eric Bailly were sent off on 88 minutes after a clash before John Guidetti missed an open goal with the last kick of the match that would have sent the Spaniards into the Stockholm final.
26,10/05/2017,21:26,Celta inspired by Bielsa in bid to topple Man Utd,"Celta Vigo will draw inspiration from Athletic Bilbao's 2012 victory over Manchester United when they face Jose Mourinho's side in the Europa League semi-finals on Thursday, says coach Eduardo Berizzo.","A Bilbao side coached by Marcelo Bielsa defeated a United team who had reached the Champions League final the season before 5-3 on aggregate in the Europa League last 16 before losing to Atletico Madrid in the final. United have the upper hand ahead of Thursday's second leg, having won last week's first leg 1-0, but Berizzo said they would approach the game with the same fearlessness as his countryman Bielsa's Bilbao. ""That performance with Bielsa does serve as an inspiration,"" the Argentine told reporters at Old Trafford on Wednesday. ""Our style of play and what we're known for is pressing high up the pitch. If we can do that tomorrow night, I don't see it as a defensive tactic. ""It's a way of being offensive, by trying to win the ball back as far from our goal as possible. That's our emblem, our identity, if you like. ""This fantastic competition has really given us an opportunity to push the envelope and go through the ceiling. ""Let's hope we can do that one more time. The boys are really motivated and there's great energy in the camp. Let's hope we can put it to good use tomorrow."" Celta have already eliminated Shakhtar Donetsk, Russian side Krasnodar and Belgian outfit Genk and are seeking to reach the first European final in their history. While his side cannot compete with United's European pedigree, Berizzo believes the backing of over 2,500 travelling fans could give them an edge. ""Tomorrow represents a massive hurdle for Celta. This in itself is a motivation,"" said Berizzo, whose side are currently 12th in La Liga. ""Having nearly 3,000 people travelling all the way from Spain -- even after losing the first leg 1-0, those fans didn't give up, even against the most powerful team in the world with 70,000 of their own fans. ""We've got to go with the attitude that in football, everything is possible."""

United will travel to Spain for the first leg on May 4 before Celta visit Manchester for the return on May 11. With United currently four points outside the Premier League top four, winning the Europa League for the first time may represent their best chance of qualifying for the Champions League. Celta sit 10th in La Liga and progressed from the quarter-finals after following up a 3-2 home win against Genk by drawing Thursday's second leg 1-1 in Belgium. United have never faced Celta in UEFA competition and the Spanish side are through to a major European semi-final for the first time in their history. As England's final European representatives this season, United were made to sweat by Anderlecht in the quarter-final second leg on Thursday. Marcus Rashford's extra-time goal sealed a 2-1 win at Old Trafford that sent United through 3-2 on aggregate. If United make it to the final in Stockholm's Friends Arena on May 24 it will be the club's first appearance in the decisive match of Europe's second-tier tournament. It would also be United's first European final since they lost the 2011 Champions League decider against Barcelona at Wembley."
30,16/04/2017,22:48,Adams slumps to heavy home defeat on Granada bow,Granada's slim hopes of launching a bid for La Liga survival under Tony Adams were further diminished as an under-strength Celta Vigo ran out 3-0 away winners on Sunday.,"Former Arsenal and England captain Adams took temporary charge until the end of the season earlier this week having previously worked at Granada as an adviser to Chinese owner Jiang Lizhang. Granada remain seven points off safety with just six games remaining. Adams named a side of 11 different nationalities and without a single Spaniard in his starting line-up at Nuevo Los Carmenes stadium. But Granada rarely threatened a much-changed Celta side, with one eye on the second leg of their Europa League quarter-final against Genk, and Jozabed opened the scoring midway through the first half. Marcelo Diaz's fine free-kick doubled Celta's lead 17 minutes from time before Claudio Beauvue added a third after Theo Bongonda's effort came back off the post. At the other end of the table fourth-placed Sevilla's slump in form continued but they were grateful to escape with a point from a 0-0 draw at Valencia. Valencia were denied a fourth consecutive win as Italian striker Simone Zaza had a goal ruled out for handball 17 minutes from time. Sevilla's best effort saw Stevan Jovetic hit the post early on, but Jorge Sampaoli's men have now won just one of their last eight games in all competitions. A point means Sevilla trail Atletico Madrid by three points in the battle for automatic Champions League qualification in third. However, they enjoy a comfortable eight-point lead over fifth-placed Villarreal, who travel to Alaves on Monday. Leganes remain just five points above the relegation zone after Leo Baptistao struck in stoppage time to hand Espanyol a 1-0 win. Eibar's quest to qualify for Europe for the first time faltered as they lost 2-0 at Real Betis."

Spain's Celta Vigo take on another Belgian club Genk, while Dutch giants Ajax face Germany's Schalke 04 in home and away ties to be played on April 13 and 20."
32,19/01/2017,01:36,Defeated Real Madrid surprise Zidane,"Real Madrid coach Zinedine Zidane admitted he was surprised by his side's slow start as they slumped to a second defeat in four days, 2-1 at home to Celta Vigo in the first leg of their Copa del Rey quarter-final on Wednesday.","Zidane's men hadn't lost in a Spanish record 40 games stretching back to April last year before conceding twice in the final five minutes to lose 2-1 at Sevilla on Sunday. And Zidane believes the European champions suffered a hangover from that disappointment in a first 45 minutes devoid of goalmouth action at a frigid Santiago Bernabeu with temperatures plummeting below zero degrees ""It was a strange game, especially the start,"" said Zidane. ""We have to analyse it, something is wrong for sure. We didn't do what we had prepared to do, especially the intensity. The intensity wasn't good at the start of the game."" However, the real damage to the hosts was done in a six-minute spell midway through the second-half as Celta grabbed two vital away goals and their first win at the Bernabeu in a decade. Iago Aspas's 15th goal of the season put the visitors in front before Marcelo equalised with a sensational volley five minutes later. However, Celta went immediately back in front when left-back Jonny exploited a huge gap in the centre of the Madrid defence to slot home. The sides meet again for the second leg on January 25. ""There is no excuse. We are Real Madrid,"" added Zidane. ""We have to keep working and think about the next game. We will overcome this. ""We have done well until now and in the last two games we can't be happy with above all the results. The performance in Sevilla was good, today it was a bit worse, but we shouldn't worry."" However, Brazilian midfielder Casemiro admitted Real's confidence has been rocked by back-to-back defeats. ""This defeat is concerning because Madrid can never lose,"" he said. ""Losing in Seville has damaged us."" Celta boss Eduardo Berizzo claimed he wasn't surprised by his side's success having knocked Atletico Madrid out at this stage of the competition last season. However, he insisted Madrid remain the favourites to progress and believes Celta will need to play even better in the return leg in seven days time to reach the last four. ""It is a bit arrogant to say we are favourites against Real Madrid, but we will enjoy a win like this,"" said Berizzo. ""None of my team's victories surprise me. It is a huge win, coming to a place like this and facing the best team in the world, but we believed we could do it. ""We are happy to win, but it obliges us to play even better in Vigo because we are facing a brilliant opponent and it is the toughest footballing test."""
33,05/03/2016,17:56,Four-goal Ronaldo silences Madrid critics in Celta rout,Cristiano Ronaldo silenced his critics with four goals in Real Madrid's 7-1 mauling of Celta Vigo on Saturday after being jeered by certain sections of the home support.,"Ronaldo wheeled away in celebration with hand cupped to his ear after smashing home Madrid's second after Pepe had headed Zinedine Zidane's men in front before half-time. The three-time World Player of the Year added three more to surpass Telmo Zarra as the second highest scorer in La Liga history. And there was further good news for Real as Gareth Bale scored Madrid's seventh on his first appearance after six weeks out with a calf injury. Victory moved Real back to within nine points of leaders Barcelona, who travel to Eibar on Sunday. There was little evidence that Ronaldo or Real were about to burst into life during a quiet first-half played out in front of a frustrated home crowd after last weekend's 1-0 defeat to Atletico in the Madrid derby. Iago Aspas had a huge chance to put Celta in front when he headed against the bar before Keylor Navas smothered his follow-up effort from point-blank range. Ronaldo didn't make his presence felt until 20 minutes in when his fierce strike from distance was beaten to safety by Ruben Blanco. The Celta 'keeper also denied Isco and Casemiro, but the visitors were struggling to deal with cross balls and Pepe powered home the opener five minutes before the break from Isco's cross. Ronaldo had controversially claimed Real would be top of the league if the rest of his teammates matched his exacting standards after the Atletico game. And the Portuguese was met with a few whistles from the crowd early in the second-half after losing possession twice in quick succession. However, he responded instantly with a dipping strike from 25 yards that flew past Blanco. Ronaldo immediately headed towards the stand behind the goal with his hand placed over his ear as a warning shot to his critics. More was to come from Ronaldo as he then curled home a brilliant free-kick into the top corner to bring up 250 La Liga goals in just 228 appearances. Ronaldo hit the bar with another free-kick before Aspas capitalised on the huge amount of space in behind the Madrid defence to pull a goal back with a neat chip over Navas. However, Madrid duly replied with a further three goals in 13 minutes. Firstly, Ronaldo completed his 30th La Liga hat-trick with a tap in from Isco's unselfish low cross. Bale then made his entrance with the Welsh star's return to fitness a huge boost for Zidane ahead of Madrid's Champions League last-16, second-leg clash with Roma on Tuesday. Ronaldo headed home his fourth of the afternoon before substitute Jese Rodriguez smashed home Madrid's sixth after a fine solo run. And Bale showed what Madrid were missing last week against Atletico when he drove at the Celta defence before firing in his 14th goal of the season off the post."
34,11/02/2016,22:28,Sevilla to meet Barcelona in Copa del Rey final,Sevilla set up a meeting with Barcelona in the final of the Copa del Rey after a 2-2 draw away to Celta Vigo on Thursday saw them win their semi-final 6-2 on aggregate.,"Unai Emery's side had done the damage in last week's first leg at home, winning 4-0 to leave Celta with a mountain to climb in the return at Balaidos. However, in the driving Galician rain, Celta did make Sevilla fret as they went 2-0 up on the night thanks to a brace either side of half-time by Iago Aspas. But Ever Banega quickly pulled one back for Sevilla and Swedish striker John Guidetti struck the post with a penalty for Celta after he had been brought down in the box by goalkeeper Sergio Rico. Sevilla then equalised on the night when Vitolo set up Yevhen Konoplyanka for an easy finish late on. Sevilla and Barcelona, who met in the final of the UEFA Super Cup in Tbilisi at the start of the campaign with Barca winning 5-4 in extra time, will now clash again in the final of the Copa del Rey, with the game scheduled for May 21 at an as yet undecided venue. Barcelona are the holders while Sevilla last lifted the trophy in 2010, when they defeated Atletico Madrid 2-0 in the final at the Camp Nou."
35,17/01/2016,13:54,Celta Vigo seal deal for Lyon's Beauvue,Celta Vigo confirmed the signing of Guadeloupe international striker Claudio Beauvue from Lyon on a five-and-a-half year deal on Sunday to boost their push for a place in the Champions League next season.,"""The attacker is now a Celta Vigo player after passing a medical and signing his contract,"" Celta said in a statement on their website. The 27-year-old scored eight goals in 29 games since joining Lyon from Guingamp in July. ""He is a very good footballer, very direct and quick,"" said Celta coach Eduardo Berizzo. ""He will adapt quickly and feel comfortable in our system."" Beauvue is Celta's second signing of the January window after Chilean international Marcelo Diaz signed on Friday from Hamburg to replace the departed Augusto Fernandez, who joined Atletico Madrid earlier this month. Celta were looking to bolster their attack with Spanish international Nolito expected to complete a move to Barcelona before the end of the month. The Galicians edged a seven-goal thriller 4-3 against Levante on Saturday to move up to fifth in La Liga and within six points of Villarreal in the final Champions League spot. Celta are also still alive in the Copa del Rey, where they face La Liga leaders Atletico Madrid in the quarter-finals on Wednesday."
36,01/01/2016,10:54,Atletico sign Celta midfielder Augusto Fernandez,Atletico Madrid have boosted their La Liga title challenge with the signing of Argentine international midfielder Augusto Fernandez from Celta Vigo for an undisclosed fee.,"""Fernandez passed a medical on Thursday and has signed his contract with our club on January 1 for the remainder of the season plus three more,"" Atletico said in a statement on their website on Friday. The 29-year-old enjoyed a successful three-and-a-half year spell at Celta, scoring 10 goals in 122 appearances, and helping to guide them to fifth in the table so far this season. ""It is an important signing that gives us options in midfield,"" said Atletico boss Diego Simeone. His arrival is expected to cover for the absence of the injured Tiago, who will be out until March with a broken leg. ""He is a player with veritable experience in La Liga, who will offer quality and competition to a great central midfield like ours,"" said Atletico sporting director Jose Luis Perez Caminero. ""His incorporation will help us with the demands of challenging in three competitions in the coming months."" Atletico are joint top of La Liga with Barcelona, albeit having played a game more than the European champions, and have reached the last 16 of both the Copa del Rey and Champions League. Fernandez already has title winning experience under Simeone as they won the Argentine Clausura title together when at River Plate in 2008. His registration won't be cleared in time to face Levante on Saturday, so Fernandez could even make his debut by returning to Balaidos when Atletico travel to Celta on January 10."
37,07/11/2015,18:10,Valencia stick five past high-flying Celta,Valencia eased the pressure on coach Nuno Espirito Santo with by far their best result of the season to thrash Celta Vigo 5-1 at Balaidos on Saturday.,"Paco Alcacer and Dani Parejo both struck twice before Shkodran Mustafi added a late header to lift Valencia to within two points of the top four. Victory takes Valencia up to sixth, three points behind Celta in third. Celta had started the day with the chance to move level with Real Madrid and Barcelona at the top of the table. By contrast, Valencia travelled to Galicia with rumours surrounding Nuno's future after a dreadful performance in losing 1-0 to Gent in the Champions League on Wednesday. True to form, Celta dominated the majority of the match, but they suffered just their second defeat of the season thanks to some brilliant Valencia finishing and comical defending from the hosts. Alcacer had once again been named in Vicente del Bosque's Spain squad on Friday despite scoring just once from open play all season. However, he justified the former Real Madrid coach's faith by sweeping home Parejo's pass for the opener on 12 minutes. Celta were deservedly level 11 minutes later when Augusto Fernandez headed home from close range. The home side were then outraged when they had the ball in the net again moments later, but referee Inaki Vicandi Garrido had already blown for a Celta free-kick on the edge of the area. Parejo turned the game on its head just before half-time with a stunning free-kick that found the top corner. Seconds into the second-half it was 3-1 as Alcacer pounced on a short back-pass from Jonny to coolly slot home his second of the afternoon. Alcacer then turned provider for Parejo to score the fourth before Mustafi added a fifth from a corner 13 minutes from time. League leaders Real Madrid and Barcelona are both in action on Sunday in their final match before they clash in El Clasico on November 21. Madrid travel to Sevilla, whilst Barcelona host fifth-placed Villarreal at the Camp Nou."
38,24/09/2015,01:40,"Barca outclassed by brilliant Celta, admits Enrique",Barcelona coach Luis Enrique hailed the quality displayed by his former club Celta Vigo as they thrashed the European champions 4-1 on Wednesday.,"Enrique's men had arrived in Galicia with a 100 percent record in La Liga, but were well beaten as goals from Nolito and John Guidetti either side of a double from former Liverpool striker Iago Aspas sealed a famous night for Celta. ""When a team has been better than you there is no more to add,"" said Enrique, who took charge of Celta during the 2013-14 season before joining Barca. ""I prefer to be beaten by a team that plays like Celta, without any traps and purely on football grounds. ""I congratulate them and urge them to continue playing like that."" Barca have now conceded four goals in a game three times in just nine matches this season. However, Javier Mascherano claimed it was being outplayed that concerned him more than last season's treble winners' defensive woes. ""It always hurts to lose at Barca. We have a thick skin and all we can do now is think about Saturday and remember what happened last season,"" said the Argentine. ""There can be a day when the opponent is better and beats you to every ball. Part of it is our fault and part of it is to their credit. ""We don't have any excuses. They beat us soundly and we have to keep working. The most worrying thing is that we feel outplayed."" Celta also stunned Barca 1-0 at the Camp Nou last season and their coach Eduardo Berizzo believes the fearlessness of their performance was worthy of such a sensational result. ""There were special circumstances and a bit of luck that went our way,"" he said. ""Our idea is to play the way we did tonight, trying to take the game to the opponent no matter who we are playing. ""The players have delighted the fans. Football and the people present tonight were the winners. ""I congratulate the players because they were perfect."" Barca's defeat allowed Real Madrid to go top of the table for the first time this season as they were 2-1 victors at Athletic Bilbao thanks to Karim Benzema's double. The Frenchman scored either side of Sabin Merino's second-half equaliser to take his tally to six goals in his last five games. ""We knew how difficult it would be because we knew how much the fans would drive Athletic forward,"" said Madrid boss Rafael Benitez. ""We showed our quality in the first-half and then our character and intensity in the second. ""To win like this reinforces the confidence in the team."""
39,23/09/2015,22:01,Barca thrashed 4-1 by Aspas-inspired Celta Vigo,Barcelona's 100 percent start to La Liga season was brought to a stunning end as Celta Vigo moved top of the table with a stunning 4-1 victory on Wednesday.,"The side formerly managed by Barca boss Luis Enrique were deservedly given a 2-0 half-time lead by excellent finishes from Nolito and former Liverpool striker Iago Aspas. Barca's first league defeat since February was sealed when Aspas struck again on the counter-attack early in the second period. Neymar pulled a goal back for the visitors, but Celta rightly had the final word as John Guidetti rounded off a famous win with the Galicians' fourth nine minutes from time. It is the third time Barca have conceded four goals in just nine games this season having been thrashed 4-0 by Athletic Bilbao in the Spanish Super Cup and beaten Sevilla 5-4 in the UEFA Super Cup. Barca were back close to full strength for what Enrique warned would be one of their toughest tests of the season as Gerard Pique returned from suspension, whilst Andres Iniesta and Luis Suarez were restored to the starting line-up after being rested for Sunday's 4-1 win over Levante. Despite Celta's bright start it was the visitors who had the first two chances, but both Lionel Messi and Neymar placed efforts too close to Sergio Alvarez who repelled the ball to safety. Celta took the lead on 25 minutes when Nolito found space inside the area and curled the ball perfectly high into the far corner to join Cristiano Ronaldo as the league's top scorer with five goals. Things got worse for the European champions just four minutes later when an error from Pique allowed Nolito to play in Aspas, who remained calm before expertly clipping the ball over the helpless Marc-Andre ter Stegen. Aspas had a great chance to put the game to bed five minutes into the second-half, but this time he pulled his shot just wide of the target. The hosts then had to withstand a brief Barca onslaught as Messi struck the post from Iniesta's cut-back. Pique then headed just over and Messi saw another powerful effort turned behind by Alvarez. Yet, from the resulting corner, Celta's lightning speed and accuracy shone through as Aspas hooked the ball over Dani Alves and sprinted half the length of the field before slotting home his second of the night. Nolito should have made it 4-0 when he side-footed just wide as Celta broke dangerously again from another Barca corner. However, Celta were also grateful to Alvarez for keeping Barca at bay as he made a brilliant stop to prevent Neymar pulling a goal back. The Brazilian did finally get Barca on the scoresheet as he controlled a fantastic pass from Messi before smashing the ball home. Yet, Celta needed just two minutes to restore their three-goal lead when former Celtic and Manchester City striker Guidetti took advantage of more slack Barca marking to fire home his first goal in Spanish football."
40,20/09/2015,20:27,"Celta inflict more Sevilla pain, Villarreal second",Europa League holders Sevilla's terrible start to their La Liga season continued as Celta Vigo climbed into third place with a 2-1 win at the Sanchez Pizjuan on Sunday.,"Villarreal moved into second, ahead of Celta on goal difference, with a convincing 3-1 win over a depleted Athletic Bilbao. Celta's bright start to the campaign had been aided by their three previous opponents having a man sent-off early on, but they needed no such help in Andalusia as a brilliant first-half display put them on course for victory. Nolito added to his burgeoning reputation as one of Spain's top strikers with a sweet finish from a narrow angle to open the scoring before Daniel Wass pounced on some shambolic Sevilla defending to fire in the second. Fernando Llorente was introduced at half-time by Sevilla boss Unai Emery and made a quick impact by nodding home his first goal for the club nine minutes into the second period. Yet, for all their dominance in the final half hour, Sevilla couldn't find an equaliser as they remain on just two points after four games. Athletic are only one point better off as they have struggled to overcome the hangover of their Spanish Super Cup success over Barcelona to start the campaign. By contrast, Villarreal are flying high as they scored three goals for the third consecutive game thanks to a penalty from Bruno and fine strikes from Mario Gaspar and Leo Baptistao before Aritz Aduriz scored a consolation for the visitors in stoppage time. Sporting Gijon claimed their first victory since returning to the top flight with a 3-2 win in a thrilling encounter away at Deportivo la Coruna. Antonio Sarabia struck twice in the opening seven minutes for Sporting before Juanfran and Luis Alberto brought Deportivo level before the half hour mark. However, the visitors got the winner in an open first-half through Alex Menendez to move into the top half of the table."
41,20/09/2015,14:02,Celta inflict more pain on winless Sevilla,Europa League holders Sevilla's terrible start to their La Liga season continued as Celta Vigo climbed into second place with a 2-1 win at the Sanchez Pizjuan on Sunday.,"Celta's bright start to the campaign had been aided by their three previous opponents having a man sent-off early on, but they needed no such help in Andalusia as a brilliant first-half display put them on course for victory.

42,26/04/2015,22:55,Hernandez stars for Madrid in six-goal thriller,Javier Hernandez struck twice as Real Madrid kept the pressure on Barcelona at the top of La Liga by reducing the Catalans' lead to two points with a enthralling 4-2 win at Celta Vigo on Sunday.,"Nolito fired the hosts into an early lead before goals from Toni Kroos and Hernandez turned the game around. Santi Mina brought Celta level, but James Rodriguez's deflected effort put Madrid in front once more before the break and Hernandez rounded off the scoring in style 22 minutes from time. Hernandez had starred with the only goal of the tie as Real beat Atletico Madrid for the first time in eight meetings this season to reach the Champions League semi-finals in midweek. However, they were pushed onto the back foot straight away by a Celta side that had already claimed the scalps of Barcelona and Atletico in La Liga this season. Nolito opened the scoring after just nine minutes as he eased past the weak challenges of Dani Carvajal and Asier Illarramendi before leaving Iker Casillas flat-footed with a low shot that rolled in at the near post. Celta's lead lasted only seven minutes as Cristiano Ronaldo's dangerous cross from the right was cleared only as far as Kroos at the edge of the area and the German curled home just his second goal for Madrid. The visitors then went in front as Hernandez's scoring streak continued with a fine low finish after a neat one-two with Rodriguez. Yet, again the lead was short-lived when Fabio Orellana's through ball split the Madrid defence wide open and Mina slotted into an empty net at the second attempt after his initial effort came back off the post. Celta's offensive approach was allowing Madrid plenty of space to counter-attack and Ronaldo nearly took advantage of another lightning break when he struck the post from Hernandez's pass. However, Carlo Ancelotti's men only had seconds to wait for the third goal to arrive and there was a touch of fortune about it as Rodriguez's shot was deflected past the helpless Sergio Alvarez. Celta began the second period with the same intensity as they had the first and the home fans were screaming for a penalty when Orellana tumbled inside the area under pressure from Kroos, but the referee was unmoved. Hernandez then sealed the three points in stunning fashion as he controlled Sergio Ramos's brilliant ball over the top before slamming past Alvarez for his fourth goal in as many games. Earlier, Europa League holders Sevilla maintained their push for a return to the Champions League with a comfortable 2-0 win over Rayo Vallecano on Sunday. Unai Emery's men had edged out Zenit St Petersburg in a gruelling 90 minutes to make it back to the semi-finals of the Europa League with a 2-2 draw in Russia on Thursday. However, they showed little sign of fatigue in a commanding first 45 minutes and made the game safe before the break thanks to goals from Vicente Iborra and Daniel Carrico. Victory moves the Andalusians a point above Valencia in the fight for a top four finish, although Los Che can move back into the final Champions League place should they avoid defeat at home to Granada on Monday. At the other end of the table, Almeria gave their hopes of survival a huge boost with a 2-0 win over fellow strugglers Eibar thanks to goals from Thievy Bifouma and Verza. That result elevated Almeria out of the relegation zone at Deportivo la Coruna's expense after they had earlier claimed a point in a 1-1 draw away to Malaga."
43,05/04/2015,22:57,Mathieu saves Barca,Jeremy Mathieu headed home a vital winner 16 minutes from time as Barcelona ground out a 1-0 win at Celta Vigo to remain four points clear of Real Madrid in La Liga on Sunday.,"Earlier, Cristiano Ronaldo's first ever five goal haul had taken Madrid back to winning ways in stunning style with a 9-1 thrashing of Granada. Mathieu had opened the scoring in Barca's 2-1 victory over Madrid last time out and just his second league goal for Barca could be just as crucial as they laboured for long spells against a well-organised Celta side. There were no such troubles for Madrid, as after Gareth Bale's opener, Ronaldo took over as he scored three times in eight minutes just after the half hour mark. Karim Benzema struck twice either side of Ronaldo's fourth as Real added three more in a four-minute spell just after the break. Robert Ibanez grabbed a consolation for the visitors, but Diego Mainz's own goal made it 8-1 before Ronaldo rounded off the scoring with a towering header. Meanwhile, Valencia's outside hopes of a late title challenge were dented as they remain in fourth, nine points off the top, after a 0-0 draw at home to Villarreal. Celta stunned Barca at the Camp Nou when they last met back in November and the visitors knew they were in for another uncomfortable 90 minutes when Claudio Bravo had to turn away former Barca forward Nolito's low drive 10 minutes in. At the other end Messi was first to threaten as Sergio Alvarez did well to parry his curling effort before Neymar fired the rebound well over. The best chance by of the opening 45 minutes fell to Celta's Joaquin Larrivey, but the man who scored the winner at the Camp Nou blazed over with just Bravo to beat. Barca started the second period brightly and could have been in front as Neymar had a sweetly struck goal ruled out for a marginal offside call. In the end the visitors had to rely on a set-piece to get the job done as a wonderful in-swinging free-kick from Xavi was met by a equally good header by Mathieu to thunder the ball in off the crossbar. Celta then ended the game with 10 men as Fabian Orellana was sent off in bizarre circumstances for throwing a clump of turf at Sergio Busquets. However, a lean night in front of goal for Lionel Messi means Ronaldo's quintuple takes him four clear of the Argentine in the race to be La Liga's top goalscorer. ""Happy to have scored five goals with this excellent team work. Thank you for all your support,"" Ronaldo posted on his official Twitter account. ""What more can I say about him? It is the first time he has scored five goals with Real Madrid which is great for him and for us looking forward to the next game,"" said Madrid boss Carlo Ancelotti. Bale was first to capitalise on some terrible Granada defending when he latched onto Toni Kroos's through ball to round Oier Olazabal and slot home from a narrow angle. James Rodriguez made his return after two months out with a foot injury and sealed his comeback with a lovely assist with the outside of his left foot to allow Ronaldo to curl home his first of the afternoon. The Portuguese soon made it 3-0 by lashing home from close range after Olazabal had spilled a cross and he sealed an eight-minute hat-trick with some more help from the Granada 'keeper as he couldn't keep out the World Player of the Year's drive from 20 yards. Granada offered embarrassingly little resistance after the break as Benzema was given plenty of time to control a corner from the left and fire home to make it 5-0. Bale then unselfishly teed up Ronaldo to nod home his 46th goal of the season, although there was a brief scare for the home fans as Ronaldo collided with the frame of the goal in doing so but was soon back on his feet. More shocking defending from Granada allowed Benzema to saunter through for a seventh barely 60 seconds later. Granada pulled a goal back when Ibanez burst clear of Raphael Varane to slot past Casillas, but their miserable day was rounded off when Mainz could only turn Luka Modric's cross into his own net. And fittingly Ronaldo had the final word when he rose highest to power Modric's free-kick in at the far post."
44,15/02/2015,22:57,"Messi hat-trick fires Barca, Atletico beaten by Celta",Lionel Messi marked his 300th La Liga appearance with his 31st Barcelona hat-trick as the Catalans moved within a point of Real Madrid at the top of the table with a 5-0 win over Levante.,"However, champions Atletico Madrid remain seven points off the top in third after losing 2-0 at Celta Vigo. Barca have now won 11 straight matches in all competitions and never looked in danger despite coach Luis Enrique making eight changes from the side that beat Villarreal in the Copa del Rey in midweek. Messi teed up Neymar to open the scoring early on and then took over scoring duties himself to push out his all-time La Liga tally to 269 goals. Yet, even the Argentine was upstaged by a stunning overhead kick from substitute Luis Suarez to round off the scoring. Victory tied Pep Guardiola's best ever run of consecutive wins during his hugely successful four-year spell in charge at the Camp Nou. But Enrique insisted it is winning at the season's end which matters most. ""Records are obviously positive, but they don't interest me,"" he said. ""The players aren't overly euphoric because they know how hard it is to win titles. ""If the fans are euphoric then great. We need to be optimistic, but it isn't important how many games we have won. What counts is if they help us to win trophies."" Messi, Neymar and Javier Mascherano were the only survivors from Wednesday's 3-1 Cup semi-final, first leg win over Villarreal as Enrique continued to use the vast resources of his squad. Those changes did understandably provoke a subdued start, but Barca's luck was in on 17 minutes when Neymar mishit Messi's dinked pass over the Levante defence only for the ball to spin high into the air and drop into the far corner of the net. Messi didn't need the same fortune to make it 2-0 as Marc Bartra robbed the ball deep inside the Levante half and fed his teammate to slot home his 35th goal of the season. The four-time World Player of the Year doubled his tally just before the hour mark as Sergio Busquets's lovely pass into Pedro was turned across goal by the Spanish international for Messi to tap home. Neymar was then upended inside the area by Ivan Lopez and, having handed penalty taking duties to the Brazilian when Neymar missed from the spot in midweek, Messi wasn't going to give up the opportunity for his fifth hat-trick of the season as he sent Marino the wrong way. Suarez was introduced at Neymar's expense shortly afterwards and the former Liverpool man provided his own moment of brilliance 17 minutes from time as he caught Adriano's cross flush on the volley for just his fourth La Liga goal. Atletico were a shadow of the side that thrashed Real Madrid 4-0 last weekend as a fifth league defeat of the season all but ended their title hopes. Celta dominated the opening 45 minutes without creating a clear-cut opportunity, but they were handed the chance to open the scoring in controversial circumstances from the penalty spot as the referee missed a handball by Augusto Fernandez in the build-up before Nolito was upended by Mario Suarez inside the area. Nolito stepped up to send Miguel Angel Moya the wrong way from the spot and could only look on in disbelief moments later when Joaquin Larrivey somehow failed to turn his cross into an open goal. Atletico then came alive as Sergio Alvarez saved from Saul Niguez and Antoine Griezmann, but they were caught on the break 19 minutes from time when Michael Krohn-Dehli fed Fabian Orellana to drill the ball into the far corner. Valencia needed an Alvaro Negredo penalty 19 minutes from time to see off Getafe 1-0 and move back above Sevilla into fourth. The on-loan Manchester City striker cheekily chipped home the winner from the spot after he had been brought down by Juan Rodriguez. Villarreal's chances of a top four finish were dented, however, as they were undone by second-half goals by Alberto Bueno and Gael Kakuta in a 2-0 defeat at Rayo Vallecano."
45,31/03/2014,15:23,Football: Valdes out for seven months with knee injury,Barcelona goalkeeper Victor Valdes will miss the rest of the season and Spain's defence of the World Cup as he will be sidelined for seven months following knee surgery.,"""Victor Valdes underwent surgery on his torn anterior cruciate ligament on Monday morning with doctors Ulrich Boenish and Ricard Pruna in Augsburg, Germany,"" Barcelona said in a statement on Monday. ""They made an incision in the internal meniscus of the right knee and the surgery was completed in a satisfactory manner. ""The estimated time out will be seven months."" The 32-year-old had been primed to push Spain captain Iker Casillas for his place in goal at the World Cup in Brazil later this year given the Real Madrid man's lack of first team action this season. Instead, Manchester United's David de Gea is likely to go as back up to Casillas and Napoli's Pepe Reina. It is expected that Valdes has also played his last game for Barcelona when picking up the injury in a 3-0 win against Celta Vigo last week after declaring his intention to leave the club when his contract expires in June. Valdes has been linked with a number of clubs including Monaco and Manchester City, but has made no official announcement on where he will play next season."
