0,17/01/2021,23:44,Metz end Lyon's run as PSG take Ligue 1 lead,Lyon slumped to a shock 1-0 home defeat to Metz on Sunday that ended a long unbeaten run and allowed Paris Saint-Germain to stay top of Ligue 1.,"Rudi Garcia's side had come into Sunday's late match on the back of 16 league games without defeat, knowing that a win would have put them back in the lead of France's top flight. However Aaron Leya Iseka struck in the final minute to snatch the points for resilient Metz, who had to withstand a second-half onslaught before finally prevailing and moving ninth. ""We pushed, they pushed, and we were rewarded for our efforts. We knew that we would have little of the ball and that we would have to counter well, and that's what we did,"" said Belgian Leya Iseka. The loss leaves Lyon third, two points behind PSG and Lille, whose own late goal from Jonathan David secured a 2-1 win over Reims. Lyon should have taken the lead six minutes before the break when Karl Toko Ekambi was fed by Tintotenda Kadewere on a breakaway attack. Cameroonian Ekambi, who had forced a good save from Alexandre Oukidja three minutes earlier, successfully cut inside to fashion himself a shooting opportunity but could only blast over. Three minutes later Metz twice came close to taking a shock lead, first hitting the post following a Farid Boulaya cross before Marcelo charged back to block Lamine Gueye's shot on the line. With 16 minutes remaining Ekambi slammed home what he thought was the opener when the ball fell to him after fine play between Memphis Depay and Thiago Mendes. However after a long VAR review the goal was ruled out for Houssem Aouar straying offside when Mendes shot and then pressuring Metz defender Fabien Centonze, who had nodded the ball out to Ekambi. Islam Slimani had the perfect chance to win the match with seven minutes left of his Lyon debut but he shanked his shot, and Oukidja then did brilliant to keep out Aouar's close range effort after fine work from Memphis Depay. That allowed Leya Iseka to claim a shock win for Metz. Earlier David pounced in the first minute of stoppage for Lille to tap home after Xeka's powerful low drive was spilled by Reims goalkeeper Predrag Rajkovic to put Lille on 42 points, equal with champions PSG. Jonathan Bamba's long-range leveller two minutes after the break gave Lille a chance to snatch the win after Arber Zeneli had given Reims a 35th-minute lead with a cross that bamboozled home stopper Mike Maignan. Monaco are six points off the lead in fourth after Wissam Ben Yedder's brace gave them a 3-2 win over Montpellier on Friday. The Principality club are level on 36 points with fifth-placed Rennes, who earlier on Sunday fought back from going a goal down after just three minutes at Brest to win 2-1. Saint-Etienne are just four points above the relegation zone after a 1-0 defeat at Strasbourg. The 10-time French champions are 16th and winless in five league matches thanks in part to a missed 10th-minute penalty from Ryad Boudebouz. Ludovic Ajorque scored the winner for the team from Alsace just before the half-hour mark. Nantes are hovering above the drop zone after drawing 1-1 at home with Lens, with Gael Kakuta's 81st-minute leveller for the away side denying Raymond Domenech a first win in charge of the hosts. The former France coach has guided Nantes to three straight draws since his much-derided appointment last month, with his team battling a run of games without a win that stretches back to early November. Bordeaux strolled to a thumping 3-0 win at Nice, who are also without a win in five."
1,06/11/2020,23:20,Sanson strike edges Marseille past struggling Strasbourg,A rejigged Marseille line-up was forced to dig deep for a narrow 1-0 win over Strasbourg in Ligue 1 on Friday as a thunderous strike from Morgan Sanson sealed three precious points against the run of play.,"The result gives Marseille coach Andre Villas-Boas a little breathing space after his team lost 3-0 at Porto in the Champions League on Tuesday. Marseille climbed to within three points of Ligue 1 leaders Paris Saint-Germain, with all the top outfits on nine games ahead of PSG's clash with third-placed Rennes on Saturday. PSG lead Ligue 1 with 21 points, Lille have 19 and Rennes and Marseille both have 18. The acrobatic 72nd minute shot from the edge of the area from midfielder Sanson was set up by Dimitri Payet, who had come on as a substitute with 20 minutes remaining at a cold, windy and empty Stade de la Meinau. Payet replaced former Newcastle player and France international Florian Thauvin, who was playing his 200th game for Marseille. After a miserable first half without a single shot on target from either side Strasbourg defender Anthony Caci hit the crossbar with a deflected shot just ahead of the hour. The visitors also appealed for a penalty when the ball appeared to hit Stefan Mitrovic's hand but the referee waved play on. Strasbourg coach Thierry Laurey is currently sidelined with Covid-19 and his side are second bottom on six points from 10 games."
2,18/10/2020,16:42,Lyon back on track after Depay triple assist,Captain Memphis Depay set-up three goals as Lyon beat Strasbourg 3-2 away in Ligue 1 on Sunday to claim their first win since August.,"Netherlands' attacker Depay was the provider for Tino Kadewere and twice for Karl Toko Ekambi in the first half before Habib Diallo and Jean-Eudes Aholou scored for the hosts. Depay's side move up to eighth with their first three points since an August 28 win over Dijon. Strasbourg remain in 18th with just one victory this season. Zimbabwe forward Kadewere opened the scoring after a quarter of an hour, firing home first time from Depay's long ball. Depay, who also assisted Donny van de Beek on international duty on Wednesday, then combined on two occasions with Toko Ekambi before the 42-minute mark to make it 3-0. The hosts fought back as Senegal's Diallo cut the deficit 79 seconds later. Ivory Coast midfielder Aholou, on loan from Monaco then made it a one-goal game with his first effort since the opening day of last season with a left-footed volley into the bottom corner 10 minutes into the second half. Depay, who was linked with a move to Barcelona during the transfer window, almost claimed a fourth assist but Marcelo's header from a corner was blocked on the line by Kenny Lala. The highlight of later matches Sunday is the northern derby as third-placed Lille host promoted Lens in fourth. On Saturday, Marseille warmed up for their return to the Champions League next week with a 3-1 victory over Bordeaux. On Friday, Kylian Mbappe scored twice in PSG's 4-0 win at Nimes."
3,08/10/2020,18:39,Former fan favourite Strasbourg president Gindorf dies aged 89,"Former Strasbourg president Egon Gindorf, who used to watch home matches in the stands with supporters, has died at the age of 89, the Ligue 1 club announced on Thursday.","""All our thoughts are with his family, loved ones and all Racing (Strasbourg) fans who have today lost a emblematic and historic figure in the club's history,"" the club said in a statement. Gindorf, who took charge of the club in 2003, oversaw the side when they won the League Cup in 2005. He won over the locals by joining the club's hardcore 'ultra' supporters in the stands for matches, and on very cold nights he would even share a pot of split pea soup with his fellow fans. He quit his position in December 2005 for personal reasons, after which the club began a slow slide down the divisions and years of instability before re-establishing themselves as a Ligue 1 team in 2017."
4,28/08/2020,19:23,Veteran Japan keeper Kawashima comes in from the cold at Strasbourg,"Strasbourg coach Thierry Laurey is expected to stick with Eiji Kawashima between the posts for Saturday's Ligue 1 visit of Nice, the 37-year-old Japan international emerging as an unlikely starter having entered the season as the club's third-choice goalkeeper.","Kawashima, a veteran of three World Cups with Japan, made his first club appearance since May 2019 in last weekend's 3-1 loss in the season opener at Lorient after a combination of injury and illness decimated Strasbourg's goalkeeping ranks. Matz Sels, a virtual ever-present since signing from Newcastle in 2018, ruptured his Achilles tendon in July. Bingourou Kamara, who starred in Strasbourg's 2019 League Cup title run, tested positive for Covid-19 at the start of August, propelling the well-travelled Kawashima into the lead role. ""It's clear the players who are behind physically haven't been able to recover. We'll take stock after the first international break,"" Laurey said in reference to the nine players at the club who have contracted Covid-19. Kawashima, idolised in his home country on the back of appearing 91 times for Japan, described his return to Ligue 1 action a week ago as a ""pleasure"" despite finishing on the losing side. He has now spent a decade in Europe, originally arriving in Belgium with Lierse in 2010 before moving on to Standard Liege two years later. Kawashima joined Dundee United for the 2015-16 campaign, one that ended in relegation from Scotland's top flight. Following his release he signed for Metz, staying for two seasons, and then came to Strasbourg in the weeks following the 2018 World Cup, where Japan lost 3-2 to Belgium in the last 16 after surrendering a two-goal lead. ""There were possibilities abroad, I could also have returned to Japan but that wasn't my aim,"" Kawashima told AFP. ""I wanted to stay in France where there are some good competitions."" He has, however, largely watched on from the stands in Alsace, and occasionally from the substitutes' bench. But just like at Metz, Kawashima has suddenly gone from a back-up role to the starter in the blink of an eye. ""I put in the effort to play well, I work each day with the same mentality in training or in a match,"" he said. ""If there's a chance for me, I'm here to help the group. It's then up to the coach to decide."" Kawashima is the league's second oldest keeper behind Marseille's Yohann Pele but is still dreaming of playing at a fourth World Cup in Qatar in 2022, downplaying his advancing years by insisting ""it's all in the mind"". For Kamara, 23, the Covid-19 infection was an unfortunate setback, forcing him into a two-week quarantine until August 18 and stifling his momentum. It could also shake up the pecking order behind Sels, who will not return before 2021. ""It's bound to be disappointing for him deep down but I'm trying to tell him it's part of a career,"" Strasbourg's goalkeeping coach Stephane Cassard told AFP, advising Kamara to stay ""patient and positive""."
5,06/03/2020,22:28,PSG's game at Strasbourg postponed over virus fears,"Paris Saint-Germain's Ligue 1 game at Strasbourg on Saturday has been postponed over coronavirus fears, the French football league (LFP) announced on Friday.","""Following an order from the Bas-Rhin authorities concerning the spread of the coronavirus, the meeting is postponed,"" the LFP said in a statement. It is the first French league match to be postponed because of the new coronavirus. The decision was made after a number of people tested positive for COVID-19 in the Haut-Rhin region, which neighbours the Bas-Rhin region where Strasbourg is located. ""The arrival of 26,000 at the Stade de la Meinau, a quarter of which would come from the Haut-Rhin region, is likely to promote the spread of COVID-19,"" local authorities said in a statement. On Friday, the French health ministry said that the number of coronavirus infections in the country had jumped by 154 to 577, with two more deaths bringing the total toll to nine. Runaway Ligue 1 leaders PSG will not be too put out by the postponement, as the decision will give them an extra day of rest before their Champions League last-16 second leg against Borussia Dortmund at the Parc des Princes on Wednesday. Strasbourg sit 10th in the French top flight, eight points off a Europa League spot. ""Faced with the risks associated with the coronavirus and its spread, we understand that people's health, in this case spectators'... represents an absolute priority,"" said Strasbourg president and former France international Marc Keller."
6,16/02/2020,19:47,Lyon's Ligue 1 slump continues with Strasbourg draw,Lyon's poor form in Ligue 1 continued on Sunday with a 1-1 home draw against Strasbourg at a blustery Groupama Stadium that leaves them languishing in mid-table.,"Rudi Garcia's side are 10th on 34 points after a fourth match without a win, one in which the away side struck the post twice late on. ""There wasn't enough going forward,"" said Garcia. ""We didn't create enough goal-scoring opportunities and we didn't shoot enough at goal. We didn't do enough as the home side."" Burkino Faso international Bertrand Traore gave the hosts the lead in the 21st minute when he stooped to head home Maxwel Cornet's brilliant swinging cross. Strasbourg, who sit seventh, three points away from the European places, were level just before the break. Kevin Zohi latched onto Majeed Arsis's through ball and slotted home as the Lyon defence and the linesman had their arms aloft for offside. The goal was initially ruled out but a VAR check showed that Zohi was onside before he fed his finish in off the post. The hosts struggled to break down Strasbourg in the second half. The visitors came within inches of snatching the win in the dying moments. With three minutes left Kenny Lala curled a shot off the post. Then Strasbourg somehow failed to grab the winner in stoppage time. Dimitri Lienard's free kick from the touchline slapped the base of the post and sprung out to Alexander Djiku, who from centimetres out knocked the ball wide of the other upright as his teammates looked on in horror. Later, Marseille will be looking to to bounce back from Wednesday's French Cup exit at the hands of Lyon by strengthening their grip on second place with a win at Lille without star man Dimitri Payet. Andre Villas Boas' side are eight points ahead of third-placed Rennes, who suffered a shock 1-0 home defeat to Reims on Sunday, while Lille will take third and the last Champions league spot should they end Marseille's 13-match unbeaten run in Ligue 1. Brest moved seven points clear of the relegation zone after a 3-2 win against Saint-Etienne that plunges the 10-time French champions to within just two points of the drop."
7,10/02/2020,12:16,African players in Europe: Gambian Barrow stars in Italy,"Gambian Musa Barrow was the star African performer in Europe at the weekend, scoring twice for Bologna in a 3-2 Serie A victory at Roma.","The 21-year-old forward is on loan from Champions League last-16 qualifiers Atalanta and valued at 13 million euros ($14,2 mn). He stole the limelight as many African stars, including Liverpool duo Sadio Mane and Mohamed Salah, were enjoying mid-season breaks. WILFRIED ZAHA (Crystal Palace) The Ivorian's fifth assist of the season for Christian Benteke was not enough to halt Crystal Palace's Premier League slide as the Eagles were beaten 3-1 at Everton. Palace have not won in eight games and remain six points above the relegation zone. YOUSSEF EN-NESYRI (Sevilla) The Moroccan scored his first goal for Sevilla but could not prevent them slipping to a 2-1 defeat at struggling Celta Vigo in La Liga. En-Nesyri joined Sevilla from Leganes last month and put them ahead after racing clear and finishing in the 23rd minute. MUSA BARROW (Bologna) The Gambian scored two excellent individual efforts either side of half-time to send Bologna on their way to a 3-2 victory over Roma. Barrow has scored three goals in four games since moving to Bologna, who climbed to seventh, just one point off the Europa League berths. JEREMIE BOGA (Sassuolo) The Ivorian found the net for a second consecutive game with his 90th-minute header and also earned the penalty that gave Sassuolo their first goal in a 2-1 win at rock-bottom SPAL. Boga has scored seven league goals this season. FRANCK KESSIE (AC Milan) Ivory Coast midfielder Kessie set up AC Milan's second goal with his clever flick towards Zlatan Ibrahimovic allowing the Swede to head in against city rivals Inter Milan. But Milan let their two-goal advantage from the first half slip and fell 4-2 to drop to 10th. ACHRAF HAKIMI (Borussia Dortmund) The Moroccan was a handful on the right wing, but his Dortmund team leaked two late goals within 82 seconds to crash to a 4-3 defeat at Bayer Leverkusen. At 2-2 early in the second half, it was Hakimi's return pass that Jadon Sancho swept home for a superb strike, which was disallowed after the VAR spotted a push in the build up. However, the 21-year-old, on loan from Real Madrid for the rest of the season, set up Raphael Guerreiro, who fired home from a tight angle moments later to put Dortmund 3-2 up with 25 minutes left. SALOMON KALOU (Hertha Berlin) The 34-year-old former Ivory Coast striker is set to leave Hertha Berlin when his contract runs out in June, having sat out a 3-1 defeat at home to Mainz -- the fifth game in a row head coach Jurgen Klinsmann has left him out of the squad. After his contract expires, the former Chelsea forward says he would like to link up with former Blues team-mate John Terry, now assistant coach at Aston Villa, but would have difficulty getting a permit to play in England, so America could be an option. VICTOR OSIMHEN (LILLE) The Nigerian striker continued his fine debut campaign in Ligue 1 with the opening goal as Lille won 2-0 at Angers to move to within a solitary point of the Champions League places. It was his 12th league goal of the season, but the 21-year-old's night ended when he was stretchered off in the second half with an apparent thigh injury. MAJEED WARIS (STRASBOURG) The 28-year-old Ghanaian forward returned for a third spell in France last month when he joined Strasbourg from Porto on a loan deal that will be turned into a permanent transfer at the end of the season. He scored his first goal for his new club in a 1-0 win at Toulouse last midweek and followed that up by scoring again in a 3-0 win over Reims that left Strasbourg just outside the European places in France's top flight."
8,20/10/2019,23:37,"Marseille end slump with Strasbourg win, Ben Yedder saves Monaco",Marseille ended a four-match winless streak in Ligue 1 on Sunday after Boubacar Kamara's early strike and a late Kevin Strootman penalty saw them to a deserved victory over lowly Strasbourg.,"Kamara, 19, struck the opener with just two minutes on the clock when his shot was deflected home by Strasbourg defender Ludovic Ajoruqe, and Strootman finished off with a calm spot-kick deep in stoppage time after Dario Benedetto was brought down by Mohamed Simakan. The win sends Andre Villas Boas' inconsistent side fourth, one point off the Champions League places, while Strasbroug drop to the bottom of the league after a performance that offered little. However, Marseille are still eight points behind leader Paris Saint-Germain, who swatted Nice aside 4-1 on Friday. The hosts could have easily won by more, striking the woodwork either side of half-time through Duje Caleta-Car and Nemanja Radonjic. Benedetto also wasted a decent opportunity in the 56th minute with Marseille still just a goal up when he failed to get a contact on Maxine Lopez's cross, but in the end it mattered little. Wissam Ben Yedder fired Monaco out of the Ligue 1 mire with a stoppage time winner that earned an entertaining 3-2 win over Rennes. Yedder pounced on Keita Balde's flick two minutes into added time to lash home a powerful left-foot finish and send Leonardo Jardim's side up to 14th just as it looked as if a handball spotted by VAR had denied them the three points. The scores were level thanks to Islam Slimani equalising Faitout Maouassa and Adrien Honou's strikes for Rennes when Balde thought he had won the game for Monaco seconds before Yedder's winner. Balde capitalised on a dreadful error by Rennes goalkeeper Romain Salin to roll the ball into an empty net, only for the video assistants to spot him controlling the ball with his hand. The last-gasp winner was Ben Yedder's eighth goal in as many league matches, putting him top of the Ligue 1 scoring charts and making fans forget Radamel Falcao's departure to Galatasaray. ""I'm very happy, it wasn't an easy match. We scored in the last seconds and it was a very good goal, so I'm very happy,"" said Ben Yedder. The late goal means they are now level on 12 points with Toulouse, Amiens and 12th-placed Rennes, who have not won a match since August. Claude Puel continued his perfect start as Saint-Etienne coach. Denis Bouanga's stoppage time penalty at Bordeaux launched Puel's side into the top half of the table. The 10-time French champions were second-bottom in Ligue 1 after their home loss to Metz late last month but have won three straight, the last two under Puel. Their turnaround in form, which includes victory over local rivals Lyon in Puel's first match, has moved them to 10th place. Bordeaux meanwhile missed the chance to move into the Champions League positions with their second home loss on the bounce."
9,13/09/2019,15:22,Neymar could make PSG return Saturday: Tuchel,Neymar could return to action for Paris Saint-Germain on Saturday following four months of absence after the Brazilian was selected in the matchday squad for the Ligue 1 match against Strasbourg.,"PSG coach Thomas Tuchel said on Friday: ""We have 'Ney' in our squad, for sure"", adding ""he needs to make his comeback"". Neymar, the world's most expensive player, has had to come to terms with the prospect of a third season in Ligue 1 after PSG and his former club Barcelona failed to agree terms on a move before the transfer window shut on September 2. The 27-year-old has since been away on international duty for Brazil in two friendly matches in the United States, scoring one goal and making another in a 2-2 draw with Colombia and then coming on as a substitute in a 1-0 loss to Peru. Those were his first appearances this season after he was left out of French champions PSG's opening four league games amid uncertainty over his future. Asked if he feared Neymar would receive a hostile reception from the Parc des Princes crowd after supporters held up a banner reading ""Neymar, get lost"" at a match in August when it appeared he was about to join Barcelona, Tuchel said the fans' reaction was beyond his control. ""I can understand that all the supporters are not happy at the moment. But I can't influence this reaction or control the supporters,"" Tuchel said. ""The only thing that I can control is my team."""
10,25/08/2019,19:38,Rennes go top of Ligue 1 as Monaco's struggles continue,Rennes backed up their shock win over Paris Saint-Germain last weekend with a 2-0 win at Strasbourg on Sunday that sent them to the top of the early Ligue 1 table.,"Julien Stephan's side, who also stunned PSG to win last season's French Cup, saw off 10-man Strasbourg thanks to goals in either half from Clement Grenier and M'Baye Niang. Grenier drilled the visitors into a 16th-minute lead at the Stade de la Meinau. Jonas Martin missed the chance to equalise for Strasbourg shortly before half-time when his tame penalty was saved by Edouard Mendy. Niang, who also netted against PSG last time out, doubled the advantage nine minutes into the second period. Any home hopes of a comeback were ended when Abdallah Ndour was dismissed late on. Elsewhere, Monaco's miserable start continued as they blew a 2-0 half-time lead to be held to a 2-2 draw by fellow strugglers Nimes in the principality. Close-season signings Islam Slimani and Wissam Ben Yedder put Leonardo Jardim's men, who only narrowly avoided relegation last term, in control at the break. But Brazilian centre-back Jemerson's 55th-minute red card changed the game, and Romain Philippoteaux and 18-year-old Togolese Kevin Denkey struck to grab Nimes a point. Later on Sunday, reigning champions PSG welcome Toulouse to the Parc des Princes, with Neymar again omitted from the squad as he eyes a move away from France."
11,10/04/2019,16:20,Choupo-Moting apologises for PSG goal howler,Paris Saint-Germain striker Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting apologised Wednesday for his botched goal miss that effectively prevented the club winning the French league title in record-equalling time.,"Choupo-Moting gave PSG an early lead with his third Ligue 1 goal against Strasbourg on Sunday, but later in the first half somehow succeeded in turning a net-bound Christopher Nkunku shot onto the post while standing on the line. The match ended a 2-2 draw, and the striker was widely pilloried for his miss, with footage soon going viral. ""Ups &amp; downs, that's life! I can't change what happened but for sure I will try to do better!"" the Cameroonian ex-Stoke player said on Instagram, along with a photo of him celebrating in front of the PSG fans and a video of his goal against Strasbourg. ""I am sorry for those I disappointed, but mistakes are #human, especially in sports! It's sad to see how negative things are pushed, especially by the media and brainwashing people's minds."" Choupo-Moting, who has become something of a cult hero at the Parc des Princes and has 439,000 Instagram followers, added: ""I really like our club @psg and It was a wonderful feeling to score in front of you supporters #collectifultrasparis. ""Unfortunately after that I made the big mistake and all was forgotten! I hope that those #haters which are insulting me feel better now and find their #peace and #happiness in their own life! ""For those who are always supporting me or just understanding that mistakes can happen, I want to say thank you and big respect. I will continue to give everything."" PSG could win their sixth Ligue 1 title in seven years with a win or a draw away to Lille on Sunday."
12,08/04/2019,00:03,Choupo-Moting goal-line howler as PSG miss chance to wrap up French title,"Paris Saint-Germain squandered the chance to clinch the Ligue 1 title in record-equalling time on Sunday after a 2-2 draw at home to Strasbourg, with Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting's incredible miss from on the goal-line costing his team dear.","PSG were handed the opportunity to win their sixth French crown in seven seasons after second-placed Lille drew 1-1 at Reims earlier. That left Thomas Tuchel's side knowing that three points at the Parc des Princes would see them retain the title and wrap it up with eight games to spare, matching the speed with which Laurent Blanc's team became champions in 2016. Choupo-Moting gave them an early lead with his third Ligue 1 goal, but later in the first half he somehow succeeded in turning a net-bound Christopher Nkunku shot onto the post while standing on the line. ""I wondered if I was offside and it all happened very fast. I touched the ball, it hit the post and, well, it's a real shame because the ball was going in,"" Choupo-Moting told Canal+. ""Sorry about that."" Fresh from winning the League Cup last weekend, Strasbourg had equalised prior to Choupo-Moting's howler when Nuno Da Costa turned in a Lionel Carole cross, and they found themselves 2-1 up in the 38th minute when Anthony Goncalves lashed home from 22 yards. Kylian Mbappe came off the bench on the hour mark but it was another PSG substitute who made it 2-2 with eight minutes remaining. Julian Draxler sent in a corner from the right and Germany defender Thilo Kehrer headed home. However, having drawn at home to PSG back in December, mid-table Strasbourg then held on for a point. Cameroon international Choupo-Moting started with Mbappe rested and Neymar, Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani all unfit -- the latter watched from the stands sporting a beret. ""He is an excellent back-up player to have but if you start a lot for PSG you need to have confidence and he lacks that,"" said Tuchel of Choupo-Moting. ""He was very unfortunate because he started very well and then he stopped that ball on the line which would have made it 2-1 for us. ""I don't know why he did that. In English you say it's Murphy's law."" Still a huge 20 points clear at the summit and with a game in hand, PSG will now hope to secure the eighth league title in their history when they go to Lille next weekend. A point will be enough in that game, but PSG should have finished the job here -- Choupo-Moting's miss was one of the worst you are ever likely to see, while Dani Alves hit the bar after the break. Earlier, Jose Fonte's 56th-minute header had Lille on course to take all three points away to Reims, but substitute Remi Oudin's 78th-minute leveller -- initially ruled out for offside but then given after a VAR review -- denied the visitors. Lille are more concerned with holding off the teams below them as they look to secure second place, which provides automatic qualification for next season's Champions League group stage. The draw at the Stade Auguste-Delaune moved them five points clear of third-placed Lyon, who slumped to a shock 3-1 loss at home to relegation-threatened Dijon on Saturday. ""If we had won I think we would have sealed our place on the podium,"" said Lille coach Christophe Galtier. ""We are 11 points ahead of Saint-Etienne but there are still 21 points to play for."" Fourth-placed Saint-Etienne drew 2-2 at Amiens on Saturday, while Marseille, in fifth, were beaten 2-0 at Bordeaux on Friday. Reims are just a point behind OM in sixth and are level on points with Patrick Vieira's Nice, who beat Montpellier 1-0."
13,09/03/2019,22:31,Skipper Marcelo injured as Lyon stumble before Barca trip,"Lyon's stand-in captain Marcelo left the field with a leg injury as his side struggled to a 2-2 draw at Strasbourg on Saturday, just days away from the Champions League last 16 second leg at Barcelona.","Bruno Genesio's side head to the La Liga giants with the tie finely balanced at 0-0 after the first leg in France but the Brazilian defender is a doubt for Wednesday's fixture. ""It's too early to know if he'll play against Barcelona. He has a little issue with his hamstring. We'll do everything we have to so he plays, but we have to wait until Sunday,"" Genesio told Canal+. Genesio added he plans to talk to the club's doctor after extra tests are carried out on the centre-back on Sunday. Moussa Dembele scored twice for Lyon at the Stade de la Meinau before Ludovic Ajorque claimed a double of his own in the space of 60 seconds during the second half. Club skipper Nabil Fekir, forward Bertrand Traore, attacker Memphis Depay as well as midfielder Tanguy Ndombele started on the bench as Genesio attempted to rest the influential four as the French club eye a first quarter-final in Europe's top-tier competition since 2010. Fekir and Traore were brought on during the last quarter of an hour looking for a late winner but their efforts were in vain. Lyon remain in third place in the table, four points behind Lille who travel to Saint Etienne on Sunday. Elsewhere big-spending Monaco dropped down to 17th place after a 1-1 draw against Bordeaux as 10-man Amiens beat mid-table Nimes 2-1 to move to 16th and Dijon rose out of the automatic relegation places with a 1-1 stalemate against Reims."
14,03/03/2019,20:18,Dembele nets double as Lyon thrash Toulouse,"Moussa Dembele scored twice as Lyon thrashed Toulouse 5-1 on Sunday to strengthen their grip on a top-three place in France, while second-placed Lille edged out Dijon.","Bruno Genesio's Lyon, who are also through to the French Cup semi-finals and claimed a 0-0 first-leg draw in the Champions League last 16 against Barcelona, continued their strong season by moving six points clear of fourth-placed Saint-Etienne. ""Often this season, we haven't been calm under pressure, but against Toulouse it was a good match,"" said Lyon captain Nabil Fekir, whose 21-year-old younger brother Yassin made his Ligue 1 debut as a 79th-minute substitute. ""Playing with my brother was a huge pleasure."" The home side took less than 10 minutes to break the deadlock at the Groupama Stadium as Memphis Depay fired home a wonderful individual goal. Mathieu Dossevi levelled for Toulouse on the quarter-hour mark, but the visitors folded after Bertrand Traore restored Lyon's advantage in the 30th minute. Nabil Fekir netted a penalty five minutes later, and former Celtic striker Dembele compounded Toulouse's misery in the second half. He powered through the pitiful away defence midway through the second period and slotted a left-footed shot into the corner, before tapping in his 13th goal of the season shortly afterwards from Fekir's low cross. Traore also had another goal ruled out by VAR for offside, while Toulouse finished the game with 10 men as former Bastia midfielder Yannick Cahuzac was sent off for the 11th time in his Ligue 1 career. Lille remain second behind Paris Saint-Germain after Christophe Galtier's men claimed a narrow 1-0 win over struggling Dijon. With PSG still 17 points clear at the top with a game in hand, Lille are well-placed to secure a return to the Champions League group stage for the first time since 2012. Dijon, who remain five points from safety in 19th spot, made life tough for Lille at the Stade Pierre-Mauroy until Wesley Lautoa put through his own net in the 72nd minute. ""We will continue to work to be able to hold off the teams who want to take our place, qualifying for the Champions League is a dream we will try to achieve,"" said Lille forward Rui Fonte. Elsewhere, Patrick Vieira's Nice boosted their hopes of qualifying for next season's Europa League as Youcef Atal's 20th-minute strike was enough to see off Strasbourg 1-0. Nice are seventh in the table, three points adrift of fourth-placed Saint-Etienne."
15,26/01/2019,23:12,Monaco plight persists in wake of Henry exit,"Monaco suffered another damaging defeat as they lost 2-0 at Dijon in Ligue 1 on Saturday, just 24 hours after reappointing former boss Leonardo Jardim to take over from the sacked Thierry Henry.","Former France and Arsenal star Henry was suspended and later axed by Monaco after just two wins in the league since his arrival in October. Jardim, who led Monaco to the French title in 2017, is returning to the club only three months after he was dismissed following a dreadful start to the season. His first game back in charge will be Tuesday's League Cup semi-final against Guingamp, as Henry's former assistant Franck Passi oversaw the trip to fellow strugglers Dijon. The abject nature of this latest defeat further emphasised Monaco's perilous position in the table where they remain second from bottom, a point above last-placed Guingamp. ""We're giving everything but it's not enough,"" said Monaco captain Radamel Falcao. ""Each player has to continue to give more, all of us together. We're all in the same boat. ""We didn't manage to change things with Thierry Henry and now we must carry on with a better spirit and all fight together."" Dijon's Kwon Chang-hoon notched his first league goal since May, having recently returned from an Achilles injury, with a calm finish on 24 minutes after a static Naldo played the South Korean onside. Monaco were reduced to 10 men on the hour when Brazilian Naldo saw red for a clumsy challenge on Julio Tavares, and another defensive lapse allowed Naim Sliti to wrap up what was just Dijon's second league win since August. It was Naldo's second red card in a week after he was also dismissed in the 5-1 loss to Strasbourg last Saturday. ""We had chances just like in the past four of five matches but we always make a mistake that kills us,"" said Passi, who refused to be drawn on his own future. ""We let the other team go ahead and we're chasing after the result and that obviously makes it harder,"" he added. ""These players have the quality. They have what it takes to stay up but they just need for things to click and for it to happen quickly."" Youcef Atal and Allan Saint-Maximin scored for Patrick Vieira's Nice in a 2-0 home win over Nimes, while Kenny Lala fired home a sweet half-volley with practically the final kick to give Strasbourg a 1-0 victory over Bordeaux. Reims climbed into the top half as a 1-0 win at Guingamp stretched their unbeaten run to six matches. On Sunday, leaders Paris Saint-Germain will host Rennes without the injured Neymar. The world's most expensive player limped out of Wednesday's French Cup win over Strasbourg after hurting his foot, an injury similar to the one that ruled him out for more than two months last season. PSG coach Thomas Tuchel has said it is ""still too early"" to assess the seriousness of Neymar's injury, leaving the French giants sweating over his fitness ahead of their Champions League clash with Manchester United next month."

The Brazilian covered his eyes as he went off to be replaced by Moussa Diaby just after the hour mark, a worrying sign for the PSG camp with the first leg of their Champions League last-16 tie against Manchester United less than three weeks away. Coach Thomas Tuchel had already chosen to rest Kylian Mbappe for this game, with Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting handed a rare start in place of the superstar France forward. The Cameroon international set up Cavani for the fourth-minute opener, before Di Maria -- who had earlier hit the post -- finished into the roof of the net 10 minutes from time as PSG stay on track to win the French Cup for the fifth season running. Before kick-off, fans applauded and chanted the name of Emiliano Sala, the former Nantes striker who is feared dead after the plane he was travelling in disappeared over the Channel Islands on Monday as he was on his way to join his new club Cardiff City. Nantes' own Cup tie away at third-tier Entente Sannois Saint-Gratien has been postponed until Sunday, with their players still in a state of shock over Sala's disappearance. Elsewhere, Caen ended the run of plucky sixth-tier amateurs Viry-Chatillon in a 6-0 rout, with Yacine Bammou setting the Ligue 1 club on their way. An emotional Bammou raised his hands towards the sky after his early goal, in tribute to Sala, with whom he played at Nantes last season. Caen coach Fabien Mercadal said Bammou had made clear his desire to be involved despite the tragic turn of events. ""We talked about it. What happened is not fair. He was a friend to Yacine, he was deeply affected. The worst thing for him would have been to not play,"" said Mercadal. A group of Caen supporters, for whom Sala spent the second half of the 2014-15 season on loan, also fastened a banner that read ""Emiliano"" to a fence surrounding the pitch. Elsewhere, Naim Sliti scored a hat-trick as relegation-threatened Dijon claimed a stunning 6-3 win away at Saint-Etienne for their first victory under new coach Antoine Kombouare, while Rennes overcame fourth-division Saint-Pryve 2-0."

PSG coach Thomas Tuchel can also go on holiday relaxed with his club on 47 points, as second-placed Lille, 13 points adrift, lost 2-1 at home to Toulouse. ""I'm very happy because we can see the progress of the team,"" said Tuchel. ""You can feel the energy, it's a good thing to build on next year."" With Neymar away, Angel Di Maria was in the line-up and came closest to making it 2-0, forcing a fine save from Nantes goalkeeper Ciprian Tatarusanu, who then watched the Argentine hit the crossbar from the rebound. Meanwhile, third-placed Lyon drew 1-1 at fourth-placed Montpellier after opening the scoring thanks to their captain Nabil Fekir before a great header from Ruben Aguilar gave the surprise-package southerners a share of the spoils. Henry's Monaco were dreadful and the former Arsenal striker spat on the ground after Nolan Roux of Guingamp made fools of the Monaco defence to make it 2-0. ""I'm not going to have a good holiday,"" bemoaned Henry. ""Now you have to work and make do with what you have. ""It's necessary to work and work. There are still a lot of points to play for and that's the only positive thing about this evening."" Monaco were champions in 2017 but now have 13 points from 18 matches, just two more than Guingamp, and vice-president Vadim Vasilyev said the club needs to dip into the January transfer market. ""Until tonight, I thought we didn't need new players, but we do,"" Vasilyev told Canal+. ""It's difficult to analyse right now as I'm upset like the supporters. I understand the disappointment, it's up to us to act and draw the right conclusions."" Strasbourg paid hommage to the victims of a terror attack that killed five people on December 11 in their first home game since as they won 2-0 against Nice. Meanwhile, Marseille, in sixth, drew 1-1 at Angers and fifth-placed Saint-Etienne beat Dijon 3-0."

The incident in the heart of the medieval city as the annual Christmas market was closing on Tuesday left three dead, 13 injured and crowds of traumatised witnesses. The suspected attacker, 29-year-old Strasbourg native Cherif Chekatt, opened fire and exchanged gunshots with police and soldiers but managed to escape. More than 700 police in France have been searching for him since and the government has raised its security alert for terrorism to its highest level. Heavy demand for security personnel amid ongoing ""yellow vest"" protests and the threat of more terror attacks has forced the postponement of six of the 10 planned Ligue 1 matches this weekend."

The equaliser came when Romain Metanire was judged to have tripped Fode Ballo-Toure as he raced into the box, just as the away side thought Remi Oudin's 64th-minute strike would be enough for the three points. PSG were one of a host of French teams to have their matches postponed for security fears ahead of a weekend of fierce protests from ""gilet jaune"" demonstrators. Lille are two points ahead of Montpellier, who were set to take on Thomas Tuchel's champions in Paris on Saturday before the match was moved to next month, while Lyon are a further point back in fourth after their trip to Toulouse was also put back to January. Earlier on Sunday, Strasbourg were stopped from following up a midweek draw with PSG with a win over relegation strugglers Caen when Saif-Eddine Khaoui struck with 10 minutes remaining to grab a precious away point."

""If you arrive in flip flops against PSG, you go home with a good spanking,"" said Strasbourg coach Thierry Laurey. ""We suffered at times but we managed to minimise their offensive power. They dominated the play but we were never in too much danger."" Thomas Tuchel's side, who also drew at Bordeaux at the weekend and started without Kylian Mbappe and Thiago Silva, remain way ahead of the rest after a night in France full of late goals, incident and VAR. Champions PSG are 14 points ahead of Lille, who moved second on Tuesday after beating Montpellier 1-0 and stayed there thanks to Hatem Ben Arfa and Jordan Siebatcheu leading Rennes to a 2-0 win at Lyon on Wednesday. Bruno Genesio's Lyon are fourth, 15 points behind PSG, while inconsistent Marseille are a further two points back after a 3-2 defeat at Nantes. PSG now don't play until they travel to Serbia for their Champions League clash at Red Star Belgrade, where a win will ensure their progress to the last 16, after Saturday's match with Montpellier was postponed because of security concerns. ""We reacted and showed a lot of quality in the second half. We completely controlled play in the opposing half and had both a lot of possession and dangerous situations,"" said Tuchel. ""We played very well in the second half, showed quality but could not score."" The video assistant referees were involved in a series of key decisions on Wednesday, and it was VAR that helped Strasbourg take the lead over PSG, with referee Antony Gautier awarding Lala's spot kick a full four minutes after Thilo Kehrer handled Lionel Carole's fizzing cross. The half-time deficit led Tuchel to bring Mbappe off the bench, and it was France's World Cup star who won the penalty that Cavani blasted past Matz Sels, Lala hacking the 19-year-old superstar down in the box. PSG looked a different proposition to the sluggish team that slogged through the opening period, and Kehrer thought he had made amends for giving away the opening penalty six minutes after the break, only to see his header saved at point-blank range by Sels. However as the half wore on the away side ran out of ideas and Strasbourg made a push for the win in the final minutes. Substitute Adrien Thomasson forced a superb stop from Alphonse Areola with a minute left, and the 24-year-old thought he had snatched a famous win deep in injury time when he headed home Youssouf Fofana's pinpoint cross. However while the majority of the crowd celebrated wildly, the linesman's flag was rightly raised to rule the unfortunate Thomasson's goal out for offside. Chief among the other crucials decisions helped by VAR on a dramatic night was Loick Landre's 96th-minute winner for Nimes at Caen, which came after Prince Oniangue had levelled at 1-1 in the 90th minute and was eventually given after Landre was found to be onside. VAR also came to Bordeaux's assistance by awarding the penalty slotted home by Francois Kamano as they followed up on drawing with PSG at the weekend with a last gasp 3-2 win over Champions League-chasing Saint-Etienne at the Matmut Atlantique. Pablo bagged the points in the final minute, and Bordeaux's opening goal came at a cost to Neven Subotic, who was stretchered off with blood pouring down his face after being clattered by his own goalkeeper Stephane Ruffier just before Jimmy Briand scuffed in. Dijon sank rock-bottom Guingamp further into the relegation mire thanks to Oussama Haddadi scoring four minutes in time to hand the hosts a 2-1 win."

Neymar had earlier put PSG in front but the reigning champions ended up seeing their perfect domestic record this season come to an end after 14 straight wins. ""With 'Ney' it is almost the same thing but not too serious,"" coach Thomas Tuchel said at a press conference on Tuesday. ""He can't play against Strasbourg but after that it is the same as after the international break -- he rested against Toulouse but played against Liverpool."" Neymar has scored 15 goals this season and his performance in last week's Champions League win over Liverpool was one of his best since moving to Paris from Barcelona last year. Without him Edinson Cavani will hope to return to the starting line-up after being left on the bench in Bordeaux, as PSG seek revenge for a 2-1 defeat at Strasbourg last season. After Wednesday's match against a Strasbourg side who ended the weekend in eighth place, PSG will have a free weekend before their crucial Champions League trip to Red Star Belgrade. They had been due to host Montpellier on Saturday, but that game has been postponed following a request from Paris police, probably due to concerns about a repeat of last weekend's violence in the French capital amid demonstrations against planned fuel tax increases. PSG need to win in Belgrade to be certain of qualifying for the last 16 of the Champions League for the seventh straight season, but Tuchel said he was unsure if the postponement would help his side. ""Honestly I don't know if it's good or not. I am not thinking too much about it, but for me it is absolutely clear, security has to come first,"" said the German, who will also be without Lassana Diarra in Strasbourg due to a knee problem. ""It is a new situation for us but one that we need to deal with. That is our challenge now, to find a good training plan to get us ready for Belgrade."" PSG's dominance is such that they are already 14 points clear at the top of the table from Montpellier, who host fourth-placed Lille on Tuesday. Third-placed Lyon are at home to Rennes on Wednesday aiming to extend a nine-game unbeaten run in all competitions that included a rousing performance in drawing with Manchester City in the Champions League last midweek. Rennes come into the match in turmoil after suspending coach Sabri Lamouchi on Monday in the wake of a 4-1 home defeat against Strasbourg. The move means the former France midfielder will almost certainly not return, and reserve team coach Julian Stephan will take interim charge. With just one win in nine games since the appointment of Thierry Henry as coach, relegation-threatened Monaco are at Amiens on Tuesday. The principality side are without as many as 14 players due to injuries and suspensions. ""I have never in my career seen half a squad out injured. It is unusual and it complicates things for us,"" said goalkeeper Diego Benaglio. Midweek fixtures (kick-offs 1800GMT unless stated):"

Vieira may need a good run of results if he is to keep his job long enough to take on former Arsenal and France teammate Thierry Henry when his side visit Monaco on December 8. ""Unfortunately, tonight's match reflects our other home games,"" said Vieira. ""(Forwards) Allan (Saint-Maximin), Mario (Balotelli) and Myziane (Maolida) have not been successful. In the last 30 metres there has been a lack of quality, we haven't always made the right choices."" For Marseille, all eyes will now be on next Sunday's clash with arch rivals and runaway league leaders Paris Saint-Germain at the Velodrome. The hosts went into the match having mustered only seven goals in nine league games this season, and Vieira responded by handing Mario Balotelli just his third start of the campaign up front. The first decent chance at the Allianz Riviera fell to the Italy international, but after latching onto a long ball forward from Dante his well-struck volley was kept out by the legs of Marseille goalkeeper Steve Mandanda. A clever dummy from Balotelli created space for Allan Saint-Maximin, but his shot was tame and easily gathered by Mandanda. The away side grabbed the lead in the 42nd minute, though, as full-back Bouna Sarr skipped clear down the right-hand side and crossed for Sanson to smartly turn and fire into the bottom corner. Nice plugged away in search of an equaliser but never looked like having the quality to break through, with centre-back Dante's looping volley onto the roof of the net the best effort Vieira's men could muster. Balotelli, who was strongly linked with Marseille during the close-season before opting to stay at Nice, has failed to score this term after netting 43 goals over the last two campaigns. ""Mario? He was just like the team -- very good in the first half, then he wasn't as good. He still has to work,"" said Vieira. Earlier on Sunday, Montpellier moved into third as goals from Gaetan Laborde and Andy Delort sealed a 2-0 win over Bordeaux, while Saint-Etienne drew 1-1 against Rennes. Henry suffered a miserable return to French football on Saturday as Monaco lost at Strasbourg in his first match as a head coach, while PSG thrashed Amiens to make it 10 successive wins to start the season."

Monaco, who were runners-up to PSG last season, are now 24 points adrift of the reigning champions after they cruised to a 5-0 thrashing of Amiens at the Parc des Princes despite resting several key players. A dreadful error by Monaco's third-choice goalkeeper Seydou Sy gifted Strasbourg midfielder Adrien Thomasson an early opener, and substitute Samuel Grandsir was sent off midway through the second half. Lebo Mothiba doubled the advantage, and a late Youri Tielemans penalty was a mere consolation for the 2017 Ligue 1 title-winners. ""It wasn't easy, we tried to put something in place which worked at the beginning, and then we conceded that goal that I don't need to describe... Human error, I don't want to wipe the floor with anyone,"" said the 41-year-old Henry. ""Then we tried to change the game, and unfortunately Sam (Grandsir) is sent off. After that it was even harder, but we still tried to keep playing. ""But I want to keep positive despite the negatives... The game could have turned in our favour, but it didn't. In addition, we lost (Radamel) Falcao at the beginning. It wasn't the dream scenario."" Henry -- a World Cup winner and Arsenal's all-time record goalscorer who started his playing career at Monaco -- made four changes to the team which lost to Rennes before the international break, with former Manchester City and Inter Milan striker Stevan Jovetic restored up front. But his new side got off to the worst possible start as they handed Strasbourg a 17th-minute lead. Kenny Lala's long ball forward was nodded hopefully towards goal by Thomasson, but Senegalese 'keeper Sy -- who was only playing due to injures to Diego Benaglio and Danijel Subasic -- comically fumbled the ball over his own line. A disappointing first half ended poorly for Henry and Monaco, as captain and star striker Radamel Falcao was forced off injured. It was proving a miserable debut for Henry, as just two minutes after being brought on as a substitute, Grandsir was given a straight red card for catching Anthony Goncalves in the hip with a high boot, with the Strasbourg winger collapsing to the ground holding his face. As the visitors pushed for an equaliser, they were hit on the counter-attack in the 84th minute as South African international Mothiba raced clear before a cute lob gave him his seventh goal of the season for club and country. Tielemans pulled one back with an injury-time spot-kick after Moussa Sylla was brought down in the area, but it proved too little, too late. Paris Saint-Germain continued the blistering start to their Ligue 1 title defence as Kylian Mbappe scored again earlier on Saturday. Coach Thomas Tuchel left key men Neymar, Thiago Silva and Thomas Meunier out of the squad altogether at the Parc des Princes with Wednesday's Champions League clash with Napoli in mind, but PSG had more than enough to see off Amiens. ""Everyone thinks that Ligue 1 might be too easy to prepare for the Champions League, but it's not like that,"" insisted Tuchel, who took over the reins from Unai Emery in the close-season. ""That would mean you're blaming the other teams, but we focus on ourselves. Nobody won 10 games in a row, and we did it."" Brazilian centre-back Marquinhos nodded the hosts into a 12th-minute lead and Adrien Rabiot made it two shortly before half-time. Germany winger Julian Draxler grabbed the third headed goal of the game, and the 19-year-old Mbappe fired in late on to score his ninth goal in just six league outings this season. Moussa Diaby came off the bench to complete the rout as the capital-city giants maintained their eight-point lead over Lille at the top of the table."
25,17/10/2018,17:42,Henry hopeful playing success rubs off on Monaco,Thierry Henry hopes his illustrious playing days will help underpin a successful career in management as he embarks on his first top job in club football at Monaco.,"The 41-year-old French World Cup winner, who had been working as an assistant to Belgium coach Roberto Martinez since 2016, returned to the club where he began his professional career after replacing Leonardo Jardim. Henry scored a record 51 goals in 123 appearances for France, winning not only the 1998 World Cup but also Euro 2000, while starring for almost a decade at Arsenal before claiming the treble with Barcelona in 2009. ""I hope it will be an advantage,"" Henry said on Wednesday, when asked how his success as a player would serve him as a manager. ""But that doesn't mean it's going to be easy because of that. I think it will help. But there are some great managers who haven't played football, and vice versa."" The former striker will be joined at Monaco by Joao Carlos Valado Tralhao, under-23 coach at Benfica, and Patrick Kwame Ampadu, coach at Arsenal's academy and father of Chelsea player Ethan Ampadu. Henry graduated from Monaco's youth system and made his debut for the club in 1994. ""To have the chance to come back is incredible,"" he said. ""When the offer came it seemed logical to me, it was the choice of my heart. You know my fondness for London, but here is where I started."" Henry's first game in charge will be against Strasbourg in the league on Saturday with a must-win Champions League tie against Club Brugge four days later. However, he was reluctant to look too far ahead with Monaco languishing 18th in the league after just one win in 12 matches in all competitions this season. ""For me, a coach is supposed to make people better first and foremost,"" Henry said. ""Improving players for me is already a success, but then you have different types of success. ""How do you define success? It's difficult. At a big European club success is winning the Champions League. At other clubs, it's winning the league or helping players get better. ""Long term, it's really far away when I know the situation we're in here and what we need to do."" Jardim guided Monaco to the Ligue 1 title in 2017 but was sacked last week after a string of poor results. Club vice-president Vadim Vasilyev said there were no fixed goals for Henry, who follows former international team-mates Didier Deschamps, Zinedine Zidane and Patrick Vieira into management. ""We haven't set any objectives for Thierry Henry. Given we're 18th in the table today, it's difficult to set an objective,"" said Vasilyev. ""We need to get out of the relegation zone for a start. We're not thinking about the end of the season, we're only thinking about getting out of this difficult situation."""
26,26/09/2018,23:14,Record-setting PSG make it seven wins in seven,Paris Saint-Germain set a new club record on Wednesday when a 4-1 victory over Reims gave them a seventh win from seven games this season and an eight-point lead in Ligue 1.,"With a perfect 21 points, new coach Thomas Tuchel surpassed the previous best start of 19 points by predecessor Unai Emery last season. The champions can now claim another slice of history on Saturday where a victory over Nice will allow PSG to equal Lille's all-time record of eight wins at the start of a season set back in 1936-1937. Missing the injured Lassana Diarra and suspended Kylian Mbappe, PSG surprisingly fell behind to Reims after just two minutes on Wednesday when Xavier Chavalerin stunned the Parc des Princes. But Edinson Cavani levelled after five minutes and then won the 24th-minute penalty which was converted by Neymar. Uruguay striker Cavani hit the third before half-time to take his season's goal tally to five, the same as Neymar. Thomas Meunier tucked away the fourth in the 55th minute after being set up by young striker Moussa Diaby much to the delight of watching US basketball legend Michael Jordan in town for this week's Ryder Cup. Moussa Dembele scored his first two goals for Lyon in two minutes in Dijon to set his team on course for an 3-0 victory that lifted them into second in Ligue 1. The 22-year old striker, who joined from Celtic on August 31, scored the opener after 17 minutes with a first-time chip over the goalkeeper and two minutes later added a second, acrobatically putting home a rebound. Martin Terrier headed a third in the 35th minute. On a night when six early matches produced six red cards, Lyon played the last 34 minutes with 10 men after Lucas Tousart received a second yellow card. Dijon's Enzo Loiodice followed in the final minute. Lyon are on 13 points from seven games, eight behind PSG. Lille, who started the evening in second, lost 1-0 at Bordeaux. Francois Kamano put the home team ahead after just seven minutes. Lille played the last few minutes with 10 men after Adama Soumaoro received a second yellow card. The other two teams who could have climbed to second, Marseille and Montpellier played games that followed similar patterns until the dying seconds. Montpellier fell behind at Caen to a goal by Saif-Eddine Khaoui after 10 minutes. Andy Delort and Damien Le Tallec resplied and put the visitors ahead and, briefly, second in the league. But Yacine Bammou leveled after 64 minutes. Seven minutes from time, Montpellier's Vitorino Hilton was sent off for a wild sliding tackle. Caen created dangerous chances, but Montpellier held on to draw 2-2. In Marseille, Kenny Lala broke away and put Strasboug ahead after 27 minutes. The home team replied twice just before half time. After Florian Thauvin was sent flying in the 41st minute, Dimitri Payet coolly converted the penalty. Then Morgan Sanson curled a shot inside the post to put Marseille ahead on the stroke of half time. After Jordan Amavi received a straight red in the 52nd minute the 10 men of Marseille held out until the 89th minute when Nuno Da Costa leveled for the visitors. Marseille responded with one last attack, and Valerie Germain met a low cross with a ferocious shot to secure a 3-2 win."
27,30/08/2018,21:26,New French leave for Bafana Bafana's Lebo Mothiba,"South African international striker Lebo Mothiba has signed up for a second stint of French leave after swapping Lille for Strasbourg, his new club announced Thursday.","The 22-year-old had arrived in the eastern city Wednesday for a medical ahead of inking a three-year contract for a four million euro ($4.4 million) deal which includes a buyback clause valid for two years, a source said. Cash-strapped Lille, who Mothiba helped keep afloat last season in the top flight, notably with a final-day brace against Dijon, would also take half the transfer fee were Strasbourg to move him on during that time, the source told AFP. Mothiba, on the South African Olympic squad in 2016, joined Lille in 2014 from the Diambars academy in Johannesburg and had a successful stint with second tier Valenciennes early last year to earn a place at Lille. His early season form earned him a call-up to Bafana Bafana full squad this month but Lille chairman Gerard Lopez said the club was obliged to trim its squad."
28,24/08/2018,22:58,Fekir returns as Lyon brush aside Strasbourg,Nabil Fekir made his first appearance of the new season as Lyon bounced back from last week's surprise loss to Reims by seeing off Strasbourg 2-0 in Ligue 1 on Friday.,"Bruno Genesio's men eased to their second victory from as many league home matches this term thanks to goals from Martin Terrier and Bertrand Traore, while Fekir, who saw a move to Liverpool fall through in the close season, played the last 11 minutes. The home side took the lead shortly before half-time as full-back Ferland Mendy slipped through an inch-perfect pass for Terrier, who spent last season on loan at Strasbourg, to curl into the bottom corner. Former Chelsea forward Traore wrapped up the win in style with a fantastic individual goal in the 64th minute, latching onto Memphis Depay's ball before dribbling past visiting goalkeeper Matz Sels and a backtracking defender to slot in. Fekir missed the first two games of the season after returning late from the World Cup, where he made six substitute appearances in France's triumphant campaign. Lyon, who finished third last season to qualify for the Champions League group stage, have now won their last eight home Ligue 1 matches. Reigning champions Paris Saint-Germain welcome Angers to the Parc des Princes on Saturday, when new coach Thomas Tuchel could field forwards Edinson Cavani, Neymar and Kylian Mbappe together for the first time."
29,18/02/2018,19:43,Lyon lose more ground in Champions League race,Bertrand Traore struck twice but Lyon fell further behind their rivals for a Champions League berth in France after surrendering a two-goal lead in Sunday's 2-2 draw at struggling Lille.,"Burkina Faso forward Traore, who joined from Chelsea last July, scored twice in the first half as Lyon looked on course for a welcome victory following three successive defeats in Ligue 1. But goals after the break from Nicolas Pepe and Brazilian striker Luiz Araujo earned Christophe Galtier's side a point that left Lille just one place above the relegation zone. Lyon looked the side most capable of troubling Paris Saint-Germain after beating the league leaders in January, but a subsequent rotten run of form means they could finish the weekend six points adrift of third-placed Marseille. Rudi Garcia's men host in-form Bordeaux later on Sunday at the Velodrome. Earlier, Nice captain Dante scored his first Ligue 1 goal for the club in a 1-1 draw with Claudio Ranieri's Nantes to snap a four-match losing run. The result bumped Nantes back up to fifth, while Mario Balotelli's Nice -- who lost 3-2 to Lokomotiv Moscow in the Europa League on Thursday -- are ninth after halting their recent slide. Nantes goalkeeper Ciprian Tatarusanu had a busy and effective afternoon but Dante got a toe to a loose ball in a scramble to give last season's third-place finishers a fifth-minute lead at the Allianz Riviera. The 34-year-old Dante joined Nice from Wolfsburg in 2016 and this was his first strike for them in 55 league games. The equaliser for Ranieri's visitors came courtesy of an Emiliano Sala penalty on 27 minutes as the Argentine striker netted his 11th goal of the campaign. Atlantic coast outfit Nantes appointed Ranieri, who won the Premier League with Leicester, just ahead of the current campaign when Sergio Conceicao quit to join Porto. PSG defeated Strasbourg 5-2 on Saturday to remain perfect at home this campaign, while second-placed Monaco thumped Dijon 4-0 on Friday."
30,18/02/2018,17:43,Dante breaks duck and Nice losing streak,Nice captain Dante scored his first Ligue 1 goal for the club in a 1-1 draw with Claudio Ranieri's Nantes on Sunday to snap a four-match losing run.,"The result bumped Nantes back up to fifth, while Mario Balotelli's Nice -- who lost 3-2 to Lokomotiv Moscow in the Europa League on Thursday -- are ninth after halting their recent slide.

31,17/02/2018,22:29,"Cavani, Neymar key as PSG rebound from Madrid gloom",Edinson Cavani struck twice as Paris Saint-Germain beat Strasbourg 5-2 on Saturday to relieve some of the pressure on the runaway Ligue 1 leaders following their Champions League defeat at Real Madrid.,"Strasbourg struck early through Jean Eudes Aholou, but PSG hit back courtesy of a Julian Draxler effort before two goals in as many minutes from Neymar and Angel Di Maria put the home side in control. Stephane Bahoken pulled one back midway through the second half as Strasbourg threatened an unlikely comeback, but Cavani's league-best 22nd and 23rd goals of the season ensured victory for Unai Emery's team. ""The victory was important after the match on Wednesday. We win all our home matches,"" said Emery, whose side last dropped points at the Parc des Princes in May. ""We have to show we can maintain this level of play against bigger teams, without meaning any disrespect to Strasbourg."" He added: ""We spoke about (the Madrid defeat) in the dressing room. Of course they remember the match from Wednesday. That's normal so it's important to speak about positive things. We feel very strong at the Parc."" Captain Thiago Silva and Di Maria were recalled after Emery faced criticism for dropping them for the 3-1 loss in Madrid, and the coach was whistled by a section of home supporters unhappy with the Spaniard's decisions in midweek. Neymar was largely overshadowed by Cristiano Ronaldo in Spain on Wednesday, but the Brazilian could have struck within 90 seconds in Paris when he was denied the legs of Strasbourg goalkeeper Alexandre Oukidja. The visitors, who inflicted PSG's first defeat of the season in early December, sprang another surprise by grabbing the lead on six minutes following a clinical counter-attack. Neymar was guilty of overplaying and lost possession allowing Strasbourg to break with great effect, the move finishing off with Aholou steering home a precise first-time finish from Kenny Lala's cross. PSG responded quickly though as an intended pass through from Neymar was diverted straight into the path of Draxler who swept low into the far corner for his first league goal in over three months. The hosts promptly surged ahead as Neymar, picked out lurking on the far side of the box by Giovani Lo Celso, exhibited terrific composure and a deft touch to eliminate two defenders and tap home after his initial effort was kept out by Oukidja. A dreadful lapse of concentration from Pablo Martinez then allowed Di Maria to pinch the ball from the centre-back within seconds of the restart and drill beyond Oukidja for PSG's third. Oukidja shovelled away a powerful Cavani header and Di Maria fluffed a glorious chance to extend the lead after Dani Alves had squared for the Argentine, but Bahoken gave Strasbourg a lifeline as he guided home from the edge of the box on 67 minutes. However, Cavani allayed fears of another late PSG collapse with a clever chipped finish over the advancing Oukidja, and the Uruguayan struck again 11 minutes from time after latching on to an assist from Neymar. Elsewhere, Saint-Etienne secured a third win in four outings with a 1-0 victory at Angers, Montpellier climbed to fifth after a 1-1 home draw with Guingamp, and Troyes moved out the relegation zone thanks to a 1-0 win over Metz. Diafra Sakho netted his first league goals for Rennes following his January move from West Ham in a 2-2 draw away to Caen, with the hosts left to rue a pair of missed penalties. Defending champions Monaco eased to a 4-0 home win over Dijon on Friday as Pietro Pellegri eclipsed Kylian Mbappe to become the youngest player in the club's history. The win, which saw Pellegri -- at 16 years, 10 months and 30 days -- beat Mbappe's previous record set in December 2015, kept second-placed Monaco 12 points behind PSG. Lyon will look to arrest a three-match losing streak away to Lille on Sunday, while third-placed Marseille can return to within a point of Monaco if they beat a resurgent Bordeaux at the Velodrome."
32,02/12/2017,19:37,Neymar's PSG beaten by lowly Strasbourg,Newly-promoted Strasbourg stunned Neymar's Paris Saint-Germain 2-1 on Saturday to inflict the first defeat of the season on the runaway Ligue 1 leaders.,"The exhausted Strasbourg players charged over to their gobsmacked fans at the final whistle of a breathless encounter which saw the lowly hosts hold off a bombardment from their all-star guests that lasted right to the end of the nine minutes of stoppage time. Stephane Bahoken downed PSG, who travel to Bayern Munich on Tuesday, with a bullet finish in the 65th minute to drag the lowly home side away from relegation trouble and up to 14th. His goal also gave Marseille the chance to close the 10-point gap between Rudi Garcia's in-form side and PSG when they face Montpellier on Sunday. ""We missed out tonight. We created chances but we weren't able to convert them. We conceded two silly goals, we lacked a bit of concentration,"" PSG defender Marquinhos told Canal+. ""We will learn from this. We have a very important match coming up and we need to think about that already."" Striker Bahoken struck just as Unai Emery's side looked primed to snatch the three points, with Kylian Mbappe equalising Nuno Da Costa's 13th-minute headed opener three minutes before the break and PSG piling on the pressure. But with PSG camped in Strasbourg's half and the rested Edinson Cavani readying himself to come on to push for the win, Bahoken raced onto Da Costa's flick-on and thumped his winner past Alphonse Areola to consign PSG to their first defeat in all competitions since April. Dominant but wasteful PSG had two gilt-edged chances just before Mbappe eventually equalised, and both were fluffed by Angel Di Maria in the space of two minutes. First the Argentine sliced wide from a tight angle in the 39th minute after racing onto Neymar's precision through-ball, then he shot straight at Bingourou Kamara when fed neatly by his countryman Javier Pastore. Pastore thought he'd given PSG a deserved lead just before the break when he spun on Mbappe's cross and drilled a hard low shot that flashed past Kamara but crashed off the post and back into the beaten keeper's arms. PSG continued to press for the winner throughout the second half but Bahoken struck in a lightning breakaway attack, and Strasbourg shut up shop for the final 25 minutes. They kept the away side at bay in a frantic final flurry that saw substitute keeper Alexandre Oukidja save the points with seconds remaining, tipping away Cavani's header just as the Uruguayan looked certain to snatch what would have been a heartbreaking point."
33,16/10/2017,00:10,Mitroglou rescues Marseille as Mandanda sets record,Greece striker Kostas Mitroglou netted a late equaliser on his first Marseille start to salvage a point in Sunday's 3-3 draw at Strasbourg as Steve Mandanda made a club record 453rd appearance.,"Dimitri Payet gave Marseille the lead on five minutes, but Jean Eudes Aholou's deflected shot pulled Strasbourg level before Morgan Sanson's cross made it 2-1 to the visitors just after the break. Bakary Kone powered in a corner as Strasbourg hit back and the hosts looked on course for just a second win on their return to the top flight when Dimitri Lienard struck on 74 minutes. Stephane Bahoken poked against the post with Martin Terrier blasting wide from the follow-up as Strasbourg wasted a glorious chance to wrap up the three points. It proved costly as Mitroglou, who scored three times on international duty to help Greece earn a World Cup play-off place, pounced on a rebound two minutes from time after a mistake from Bingourou Kamara. ""Mitroglou was involved in almost everything good we did. He can do a bit more and a bit better but you have to give him time. It's a good starting point,"" said Marseille coach Rudi Garcia. Mandanda, back in France after an unsuccessful spell at Crystal Palace last season, broke the long-standing record of former midfielder Roger Scotti, who played 452 times for Marseille in a career that lasted from 1942 to 1958. Despite Mitroglou's late rescue act, Marseille saw their three-match winning run in the league snapped as they finished the weekend eight points behind leaders Paris Saint-Germain ahead of next Sunday's showdown at the Velodrome. ""This draw isn't what we were hoping for. We came for something different,"" said Payet. ""We know there's the eagerly awaited game on Sunday (against PSG). We're certainly going to need to do better than tonight if we hope to get a result."" Nice slumped to a second successive defeat as they lost 2-0 at Montpellier after Mario Balotelli and Alassane Plea failed to convert a string of chances in a frustrating first half. ""We had lots of chances to lead by two or three goals, but a match lasts 95 minutes,"" lamented Nice coach Lucien Favre. ""In the second half we struggled to maintain our rhythm that we had in the first half."" Montpellier registered just a third win in nine matches with fine solo efforts from Benin international Stephane Sessegnon, on 54 minutes, and Isaac Mbenza in the final quarter hour. Bordeaux forward Malcom notched his fifth goal of the season in a 1-1 draw at home to Nantes, who extended their unbeaten run under Claudio Ranieri to seven games."
34,16/09/2017,21:17,Falcao double gets Monaco back on track,Radamel Falcao grabbed a brace as French champions Monaco bounced back from last week's thrashing by Nice with a 3-0 win over Strasbourg at the Stade Louis II on Saturday.,"The hosts started slowly, but took the lead on the stroke of half-time through Rony Lopes' first goal for the club. Falcao made the points safe early in the second period, before completing his double in the 67th minute. ""Falcao is a great player, a great professional with an always positive attitude,"" Monaco coach Leonardo Jardim said. ""A year and a half ago, 80 percent of people thought it was over (for him). Today he is at a high level."" The three points move Monaco level on points with early Ligue 1 leaders Paris Saint-Germain, who host Lyon on Sunday. Monaco were looking to respond after seeing their record 16-match winning run in the league ended by a 4-0 thumping at Nice last week. The principality outfit have actually had a better start to this season than 12 months ago, when they also lost 4-0 at Nice in September before going on to win the title. ""It's true (we've had a better start), but it's difficult to compare with other seasons,"" Jardim added. Jardim gave Montenegrin forward Stevan Jovetic and winger Rachid Ghezzal their full debuts after close-season moves from Inter Milan and Lyon respectively, in the only two changes from the side that claimed a 1-1 draw at RB Leipzig in their Champions League opener on Wednesday. But promoted Strasbourg more than held their own for the first half an hour, and almost took the lead when Ivorian midfielder Jean-Eudes Aholou headed over from only three yards out. The hosts were a shadow of the side that stormed to last season's title and started this campaign with four straight wins, but they broke the shackles in the 44th minute. Ghezzal's ball over the top picked out an intelligent run from Falcao, who squared for Lopes to prod the ball in at the back post. The hosts didn't have to wait long to score a second, as captain Falcao grabbed his league-leading eighth goal of the campaign six minutes into the second half. Full-back Jorge's low cross left the Colombian with the simple task of diverting the ball home. Falcao wasn't done there though, as he capitalised on Strasbourg captain Kader Mangane's terrible mistake before lashing into the corner. The 31-year-old has now scored two or more goals three times already in Ligue 1 this season. On Friday, Brazilian Malcolm's third goal of the campaign helped Bordeaux stay unbeaten with a 1-0 victory at Toulouse."
35,08/06/2016,08:29,Former Nigeria coach 'Big Boss' Keshi dies,"Former Nigeria football coach Stephen Keshi died Wednesday aged 54 of a suspected heart attack, his family said in a statement.","The charismatic coach, dubbed ""Big Boss"" by fans, died in Benin City in southern Nigeria from ""cardiac arrest"", the statement said. His brother and manager, Emmanuel Ado, confirmed Keshi's death. ""It is true, my brother has passed on. He has gone to meet his wife,"" Ado said, referring to Kate, Keshi's wife of 35 years, who died last year after a long battle with cancer. ""He was not ill at all, never showed any signs of illness, but we suspect he never got over the death of his wife,"" said a friend of Keshi's who spoke on condition of anonymity. In 2013, Keshi led his country's team to victory in the Africa Cup of Nations. A year later, Nigeria qualified to the Round of 16 of the World Cup in Brazil. Keshi also coached other national squads, qualifying Togo to the 2006 World Cup and taking charge of Mali. The ""Big Boss"", as he was named by fans because of his charisma and leadership skills, sparked an exodus of Nigerian players to Belgium in 1985 when he joined top club Anderlecht. He also played for Strasbourg in France and Stade Abidjan in Ivory Coast."
