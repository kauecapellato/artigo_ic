0,13/02/2021,19:19,PSG warm up for Barcelona,Moise Kean struck the winning goal as a Paris Saint-Germain side missing the injured Neymar survived a scare to beat Nice 2-1 on Saturday and boost their Ligue 1 title hopes three days before facing Barcelona in the Champions League.,"Kean struck in the 76th minute for his 10th Ligue 1 goal since joining PSG on loan from Everton, handing Mauricio Pochettino's side the points after Julian Draxler's opener had been cancelled out by Rony Lopes at a freezing Parc des Princes. The result allowed the reigning champions to go provisionally top of the table on goal difference from Lille, who play Brest at home on Sunday. Lyon are two points back in third but can climb to the summit with a win at home to Montpellier later on Saturday. ""Today in the circumstances I think we need to be happy. We are in the position we need to be in,"" Pochettino told Canal Plus. ""I think we controlled the game and deserved the victory. We didn't play great but I think it was a very professional performance."" PSG are expected to be without Neymar for at least the next three weeks after the world's most expensive player came off with a groin injury in a midweek French Cup win at second-tier Caen, a huge blow ahead of the Champions League last 16, first leg in Barcelona on Tuesday. Angel di Maria will also be out for that game, and the Argentine watched the visit of Nice from the stands next to Marco Verratti, another key player on the injury list just now. PSG were knocked out of the Champions League in the last 16 in each of Neymar's first two seasons with the club, defeats against Real Madrid and Manchester United both coming after the Brazilian suffered an untimely injury. After reaching the final last season, the fear now is that another injury to their talisman could prove fatal to their hopes against Barcelona. ""We are missing some important players but we have a squad in whom we can trust,"" insisted Pochettino. ""It is always better when you have everyone available but of course we are going to try to win the game and there can be no excuses."" Pochettino handed starts to Kean and Mauro Icardi alongside Kylian Mbappe in attack against Nice, as PSG sported a pink and violet-coloured fourth kit with player names on the back in Mandarin to mark the Lunar New Year. The new look inspired the home side to go in front midway through the first half thanks to Draxler, who followed up to score after Icardi had turned Thilo Kehrer's cross onto the post, the German scoring on his first league start since October. However, a Nice side who have struggled badly for form this season drew level five minutes into the second half when Marquinhos attempted a pass out from the back but only succeeded in finding Lopes, who picked up the ball on the edge of the box and fired high into the net. Keylor Navas then turned Amine Gouiri's shot onto the bar with PSG on the ropes, but Pochettino's side grabbed the winner with just under quarter of an hour left. Mbappe's cross from the left to the back post was returned into the six-yard area by Icardi, and Kean headed in."
1,17/01/2021,23:44,Metz end Lyon's run as PSG take Ligue 1 lead,Lyon slumped to a shock 1-0 home defeat to Metz on Sunday that ended a long unbeaten run and allowed Paris Saint-Germain to stay top of Ligue 1.,"Rudi Garcia's side had come into Sunday's late match on the back of 16 league games without defeat, knowing that a win would have put them back in the lead of France's top flight. However Aaron Leya Iseka struck in the final minute to snatch the points for resilient Metz, who had to withstand a second-half onslaught before finally prevailing and moving ninth. ""We pushed, they pushed, and we were rewarded for our efforts. We knew that we would have little of the ball and that we would have to counter well, and that's what we did,"" said Belgian Leya Iseka. The loss leaves Lyon third, two points behind PSG and Lille, whose own late goal from Jonathan David secured a 2-1 win over Reims. Lyon should have taken the lead six minutes before the break when Karl Toko Ekambi was fed by Tintotenda Kadewere on a breakaway attack. Cameroonian Ekambi, who had forced a good save from Alexandre Oukidja three minutes earlier, successfully cut inside to fashion himself a shooting opportunity but could only blast over. Three minutes later Metz twice came close to taking a shock lead, first hitting the post following a Farid Boulaya cross before Marcelo charged back to block Lamine Gueye's shot on the line. With 16 minutes remaining Ekambi slammed home what he thought was the opener when the ball fell to him after fine play between Memphis Depay and Thiago Mendes. However after a long VAR review the goal was ruled out for Houssem Aouar straying offside when Mendes shot and then pressuring Metz defender Fabien Centonze, who had nodded the ball out to Ekambi. Islam Slimani had the perfect chance to win the match with seven minutes left of his Lyon debut but he shanked his shot, and Oukidja then did brilliant to keep out Aouar's close range effort after fine work from Memphis Depay. That allowed Leya Iseka to claim a shock win for Metz. Earlier David pounced in the first minute of stoppage for Lille to tap home after Xeka's powerful low drive was spilled by Reims goalkeeper Predrag Rajkovic to put Lille on 42 points, equal with champions PSG. Jonathan Bamba's long-range leveller two minutes after the break gave Lille a chance to snatch the win after Arber Zeneli had given Reims a 35th-minute lead with a cross that bamboozled home stopper Mike Maignan. Monaco are six points off the lead in fourth after Wissam Ben Yedder's brace gave them a 3-2 win over Montpellier on Friday. The Principality club are level on 36 points with fifth-placed Rennes, who earlier on Sunday fought back from going a goal down after just three minutes at Brest to win 2-1. Saint-Etienne are just four points above the relegation zone after a 1-0 defeat at Strasbourg. The 10-time French champions are 16th and winless in five league matches thanks in part to a missed 10th-minute penalty from Ryad Boudebouz. Ludovic Ajorque scored the winner for the team from Alsace just before the half-hour mark. Nantes are hovering above the drop zone after drawing 1-1 at home with Lens, with Gael Kakuta's 81st-minute leveller for the away side denying Raymond Domenech a first win in charge of the hosts. The former France coach has guided Nantes to three straight draws since his much-derided appointment last month, with his team battling a run of games without a win that stretches back to early November. Bordeaux strolled to a thumping 3-0 win at Nice, who are also without a win in five."
2,04/01/2021,21:53,Saliba completes loan move from Arsenal to Nice,"Arsenal defender William Saliba has moved to Nice on loan until the end of the season, both clubs announced on Monday.","In a statement, Ligue 1 outfit Nice said the deal with Arsenal for the 19-year-old was without an option to buy, although a source close to the deal told AFP that the loan could be extended into next season. Arsenal said that the move had the aim of giving Saliba ""the chance for more competitive playing time"". ""We're confident he will have a great career with us but we must remember that he is still only 19 years old and has a lot of time ahead of him,"" said Arsenal's technical director Edu. Saliba has yet to feature for the Gunners' first team since joining from Saint-Etienne in June. The Premier League outfit paid 30 million euros ($36.8 million) in July 2019 for the France under-20 international before sending him back to Saint-Etienne on-loan for a season. Saliba could come in as cover for injured captain Dante for Wednesday's trip to Brest, Nice's first match since the winter break."
3,19/12/2020,23:47,Kadewere helps 'magnificent' Lyon go top of Ligue 1,Lyon climbed to the top of Ligue 1 as Zimbabwe attacker Tino Kadewere scored a goal and set up another in a 4-1 win at Nice on Saturday.,"Kadewere made an impact either side of half-time to move his side a point above Lille who entertain third-placed Paris Saint-Germain on Sunday. ""We understand each other on the field when we play together,"" he told Canal+ of his teammates. ""If you play with players like my teammates it's magnificent, we have a lot of good players. ""We need to work further to finish the season with a lot of points to get back to the Champions League."" The visitors' boss Rudi Garcia handed Belgium defender Jason Denayer his 100th Lyon appearance as Memphis Depay returned to the starting line-up after scoring off the bench in the midweek draw with Brest. Nice attacker Jeff Reine-Adelaide was ineligible for the fixture against his parent club as Alexis Claude-Maurice came into Adrian Ursea's side on the right wing. Depay opened the scoring just after the half-hour mark with a 'Panenka' penalty before Kadewere took his tally for the season to six goals on 39 minutes. He intercepted a Hicham Boudaoui pass and beat home goalkeeper Walter Benitez with ease. Kadewere turned provider in the 63rd minute as he set up Cameroon striker Karl Toko Ekambi with a squared pass into the box. The three points were secured with less than 30 minutes to go as France playmaker Houssem Aouar fired home from close range for his first goal since late October. Earlier, Andre Villas-Boas said Marseille's 1-1 draw with Reims was a ""missed opportunity"" as they failed to move into the top three for the first time this season. Japan's Yuto Nagatomo scored an own goal before Florian Thauvin grabbed an equaliser at the Stade Velodrome. Villas-Boas' men, who lost to Rennes on Wednesday when Pape Gueye was sent off, stay fourth in the table, five points behind leaders Lyon, albeit with at least one game in hand on all their title rivals. ""It's a missed opportunity and I didn't expect it after a good performance when it was 11 v 11 at Rennes,"" the former Chelsea and Tottenham boss said. ""It's a blow and we were very disappointed in the changing room."" Opa Nguette and Farid Boulaya scored in Metz's 2-0 win over Lens to send their side up to eighth."
4,04/12/2020,14:22,Patrick Vieira sacked as Nice coach after run of defeats,"Patrick Vieira has been sacked as coach of Nice and replaced by his assistant following a run of five consecutive defeats, the French Ligue 1 club announced on Friday.","The final straw for the former Arsenal player and France 1998 World Cup winner was Thursday's 3-2 defeat at home to Bayer Leverkusen, which confirmed Nice's elimination from the Europa League. Adrian Ursea will take over from Vieira. The 53-year-old Romanian, who has spent much of his playing and coaching career in Switzerland, had been an assistant to previous Nice coach Lucien Favre and returned last year to work under Vieira. ""In a meeting after last night's match, the Nice board informed Patrick Vieira of its decision to put an end to their collaboration,"" the club said in a statement. ""Patrick Vieira put all his heart and professionalism into his service for OGC Nice over the last two and a half years."" Appointed in 2018, Vieira had been under growing pressure after last week's shock home defeat by struggling Dijon left the ambitious Cote d'Azur club in the bottom half of Ligue 1. His side had been badly hampered by the loss of veteran captain Dante, the former Brazil defender, to a serious knee injury. Now 44, Vieira had not worked in France since leaving Cannes for AC Milan in 1995 but joined Nice in June 2018 after two and a half years in charge of MLS side New York City FC. Before that he had been coaching the development squad at Manchester City, where he ended his playing career in 2011. Vieira took Nice to seventh in Ligue 1 in his first season and then fifth place and European qualification in the last campaign, which was curtailed because of the coronavirus pandemic. Nice had been hoping to build on that and challenge towards the top of the table this season following considerable investment from the club's owners Ineos. The group chaired by Monaco-based British petrochemicals billionaire Jim Ratcliffe took over Nice last year, adding the club to a portfolio of sporting ventures which included Swiss side Lausanne-Sport but also cycling's Team Ineos, formerly Team Sky. Ineos, which has also invested in the Mercedes Formula One team and an America's Cup sailing team, wants Nice to become regulars in European competition, a status that currently appears under threat, even if they are only six points off the top five in Ligue 1 and have a game in hand. After Thursday's defeat, which was their fourth in five Europa League group matches, Vieira admitted he was ""weakened as any coach who has lost five consecutive games is"". ""We are as disappointed as the supporters,"" he said. Born in Senegal, Vieira was capped 107 times by France between 1997 and 2009. He came off the bench in their win over Brazil in the 1998 World Cup final and then played a central role in France's victory at Euro 2000. Vieira also played in the team that reached the World Cup final in 2006, while at club level he enjoyed enormous success in nine years under Arsene Wenger at Arsenal, winning three Premier League titles. He is not the only star of that France generation to have been sacked by a Ligue 1 club in recent times: Thierry Henry, his former colleague at Arsenal, notably had a disastrous three-month spell at Monaco in 2018/19. Vieira has in the past stated a desire to one day return to manage in Italy -- where he also played for Juventus and Inter Milan -- or England, but his departure from Nice is likely to be a major setback to those plans."
5,20/09/2020,23:00,Mbappe inspires PSG to victory in Nice,Kylian Mbappe returned to the starting line-up for Paris Saint-German on Sunday and scored the opener in a 3-0 win at Nice which marks another step on the road to recovery for the French champions.,"The 21-year-old, who tested positive for coronavirus on September 7, was on target from the penalty spot in the 38th minute. Angel di Maria added a second just before half-time and Marquinhos headed the third after 66 minutes. Mbappe thought he had scored a fourth late on but it was ruled out for offside. He was replaced by Pablo Sarabia shortly after. ""I'm impressed by his performance after only one training session with the team,"" said coach Thomas Tuchel. ""He always shows that he can do extraordinary things and that he knows how to make a difference. It helps us a lot."" It was a second successive Ligue 1 win for PSG who began the season still smarting from defeat in the Champions League final. They lost their opening two games and the second ended in a mass brawl against Marseille which led to the suspension of Brazilian forward Neymar. With Marco Verratti also back, PSG rarely looked troubled in the sunshine of the Mediterranean. When 19-year-old Khephren Thuram-Ulien clipped Mbappe's ankle as the striker surged into the box, the France forward picked himself up to blast the ball high into the net. Four minutes later, Nice almost levelled when PSG keeper Keylor Navas had to get down sharply to his left to beat away a shot from Rony Lopes. Mbappe was back in the thick of it as the game entered stoppage time at the end of the first half. Losing two defenders, Mbappe fired in a sharp shot which Nice keeper Walter Benitez did well to parry but only as far as the feet of Di Maria, who tapped in for 2-0. PSG continued to control the game after the break and were rewarded with a third when Marquinhos got in front of the defence to head home. Saint-Etienne just about held onto top spot in the table despite throwing away a two-goal lead to draw 2-2 at Nantes and end their perfect start to the new season. Claude Puel's side are level on 10 points with next weekend's opponents Rennes after goals from Moses Simon in the 71st minute and Renaud Emond five minutes from time cancelled out Adil Aouchiche and Yvann Macon's strikes for the away side. Later, Valere Germain salvaged a late point Marseille in a 1-1 draw with Lille thanks to his 85th-minute equaliser. Luiz Araujo had claimed a 47th-minute lead for the visitors at Stade Velodrome."

The sources who spoke to AFP confirmed a news report in the French publication l'Equipe. The club refused to comment when contacted by AFP and said coach Patrick Vieira would hold his weekly pre-match press conference on Friday. The Parisians head to the Allianz Riviera on Sunday with the French league protocol saying games are to be postponed if four or more cases of the virus are found at one side. jgi-jp/iwd/lc
8,28/08/2020,19:23,Veteran Japan keeper Kawashima comes in from the cold at Strasbourg,"Strasbourg coach Thierry Laurey is expected to stick with Eiji Kawashima between the posts for Saturday's Ligue 1 visit of Nice, the 37-year-old Japan international emerging as an unlikely starter having entered the season as the club's third-choice goalkeeper.","Kawashima, a veteran of three World Cups with Japan, made his first club appearance since May 2019 in last weekend's 3-1 loss in the season opener at Lorient after a combination of injury and illness decimated Strasbourg's goalkeeping ranks. Matz Sels, a virtual ever-present since signing from Newcastle in 2018, ruptured his Achilles tendon in July. Bingourou Kamara, who starred in Strasbourg's 2019 League Cup title run, tested positive for Covid-19 at the start of August, propelling the well-travelled Kawashima into the lead role. ""It's clear the players who are behind physically haven't been able to recover. We'll take stock after the first international break,"" Laurey said in reference to the nine players at the club who have contracted Covid-19. Kawashima, idolised in his home country on the back of appearing 91 times for Japan, described his return to Ligue 1 action a week ago as a ""pleasure"" despite finishing on the losing side. He has now spent a decade in Europe, originally arriving in Belgium with Lierse in 2010 before moving on to Standard Liege two years later. Kawashima joined Dundee United for the 2015-16 campaign, one that ended in relegation from Scotland's top flight. Following his release he signed for Metz, staying for two seasons, and then came to Strasbourg in the weeks following the 2018 World Cup, where Japan lost 3-2 to Belgium in the last 16 after surrendering a two-goal lead. ""There were possibilities abroad, I could also have returned to Japan but that wasn't my aim,"" Kawashima told AFP. ""I wanted to stay in France where there are some good competitions."" He has, however, largely watched on from the stands in Alsace, and occasionally from the substitutes' bench. But just like at Metz, Kawashima has suddenly gone from a back-up role to the starter in the blink of an eye. ""I put in the effort to play well, I work each day with the same mentality in training or in a match,"" he said. ""If there's a chance for me, I'm here to help the group. It's then up to the coach to decide."" Kawashima is the league's second oldest keeper behind Marseille's Yohann Pele but is still dreaming of playing at a fourth World Cup in Qatar in 2022, downplaying his advancing years by insisting ""it's all in the mind"". For Kamara, 23, the Covid-19 infection was an unfortunate setback, forcing him into a two-week quarantine until August 18 and stifling his momentum. It could also shake up the pecking order behind Sels, who will not return before 2021. ""It's bound to be disappointing for him deep down but I'm trying to tell him it's part of a career,"" Strasbourg's goalkeeping coach Stephane Cassard told AFP, advising Kamara to stay ""patient and positive""."
9,21/08/2020,15:25,Nice coach Vieira 'worried' after two players contract virus,Nice coach Patrick Vieira says he is concerned about the impact two COVID-19 cases could have on the club ahead of the start of the new French season this weekend.,"A number of Ligue 1 clubs have reported positive tests in recent days and Nice announced Friday two of their players were held out of training and placed in quarantine after contracting the virus. ""I felt on the pitch the rest of the squad is worried. I am too, for the match against Lens on Sunday and for what happens next,"" Vieira said at a news conference on Friday. ""It complicates the planning. We'll have to put up with it and be very responsible at home."" Lens are awaiting the results of further tests after defender Jonathan Clauss returned a positive sample earlier in the week. ""I hope we will play. If we start by postponing the first weekend, we'll get nowhere,"" said Lens coach Franck Haise. ""I think we need to play as much as we can when it's possible otherwise we're going to finish the season in 2023."" A 57-page medical and health protocol set up by the French league is designed to limit stoppages and reduce contamination as much as possible. Players will be tested two to three days before each match and a game will be postponed as soon as four cases are found at the same club within an eight-day period. Friday's scheduled Ligue 1 opening fixture between Marseille and Saint-Etienne was postponed due to an outbreak at the former. Fans will instead be greeted by Bordeaux hosting Nantes."
10,12/08/2020,16:38,Nice to play Ligue 1 season opener behind closed doors,"The match between Nice and Lens on the first weekend of the French Ligue 1 season will be played behind closed doors despite earlier hopes a crowd would be allowed into the Allianz Rivieria, the southern club's president said on Wednesday.","The promoted outfit are set to travel to Nice on August 23. The French government announced this week that the cap of 5,000 people at public gatherings such as sports events would be maintained until October 30. Yet the number of COVID-19 cases is rising in France and authorities have sounded the alarm about the prospect of mass gatherings. ""Looking at the health situation in our region and the accelaration of COVID-19, we have decided to play the game against Lens behind closed doors,"" club president Jean-Pierre Rivere said. ""It might be excessive wisdom but the club want to be responsible,"" he added. The 2019-2020 Ligue 1 season was declared over in April due to the coronavirus pandemic with Paris Saint-Germain named winners. The new season begins on August 21 with Marseille hosting Saint-Etienne. jgi-est/iw/kau/iwd/gj"
11,23/06/2020,16:27,Schneiderlin joins Nice from Everton,"Morgan Schneiderlin has joined Ligue 1 side Nice from Everton for an undisclosed fee, the Premier League club announced on Tuesday.","The 30-year-old midfielder, capped 15 times by France, scored once in 88 appearances for Everton after his move from Manchester United in 2017. Schneiderlin failed to replicate the form he showed for his first English club Southampton either at Manchester United or at Everton. He had just over a year remaining on his contract. ""Everton midfielder Morgan Schneiderlin has completed a transfer to French club Nice for an undisclosed fee,"" read the Everton statement. Nice said on their website the fee would be between 2 and 4 million euros and said his 200 plus games in the Premier League and his appearances for France at the 2014 World Cup and 2016 Euros would bring them much-needed experience. ""Finding a good player is one thing, but finding one with this kind of mentality is difficult to do. He will be our major signing of the cose season,"" Nice director Julien Fournier said. Nice are managed by former Arsenal midfielder Patrick Vieira and finished fifth in Ligue 1 in 2019/20. The club is owned by British chemicals magnate Jim Ratcliffe who runs the Ineos empire of companies which sponsors the world's richest cycling team. Schneiderlin joined Everton from Manchester United in a £24 million ($30 million, 26.5 million euro) deal in January 2017 but struggled for form, making only 18 appearances this season before suffering a knee injury in February which required surgery."
12,18/10/2019,23:10,"Di Maria, Mbappe guide PSG past nine-man Nice",Angel Di Maria grabbed two goals while Kylian Mbappe struck on his return from injury as Paris Saint-Germain won 4-1 at Nice on Friday to surge five points clear at the top of Ligue 1.,"PSG lost Neymar and the influential Idrissa Gueye to injury over the international break while Mbappe and Edinson Cavani were only fit enough to make the bench for the trip to the Cote d'Azur. ""At the start of a run of six very intensive matches, it's always good to start with a win,"" said PSG coach Thomas Tuchel. ""We had a good first half, I was happy. We had chances to control the match but at the start of the second half, we forgot to close it out."" A spectacular triple save by Walter Benitez kept out Presnel Kimpembe and Abdou Diallo in the opening minutes at the Allianz Riviera but PSG soon made the breakthrough. Di Maria raced on to a first-time pass from fellow Argentine Mauro Icardi before calmly guiding beyond Benitez in the Nice goal on 15 minutes. Only Mbappe has been involved in more goals in France this year than Di Maria, who duly doubled his tally six minutes later with a sublime lob from an unfavourable angle. Marquinhos replaced PSG captain Thiago Silva at half-time and headed against the crossbar at a corner, but a mistake from the Brazilian presented Nice a lifeline on 67 minutes. An ill-advised attempt at chesting down a cross allowed Kasper Dolberg to tee up Ignatius Ganago to blast home via the underside of the bar. Any chance Patrick Vieira's side had of salvaging a result effectively evaporated though with the dismissal of Wylan Cyprien and Christophe Herelle in a matter of minutes. Cyprien was shown a second yellow card for dissent with Herelle sent off following a VAR review for a petulant slap on Leandro Paredes. Tuchel threw on Mbappe, restricted to just two substitute appearances since August, for the final eight minutes and PSG made the most of their two-man advantage. Mbappe drove low under Benitez to claim his first goal since August 11 and then laid on an assist for Icardi to tap home in stoppage time. Nantes could trim PSG's lead back to two points on Saturday when they head to bottom side Metz, while Rudi Garcia begins his reign as Lyon manager against lowly Dijon. Garcia, 55, must win over underwhelmed fans and turn around a season that is already threatening to go off the rails after taking charge of Lyon on Monday. He has been tasked with ending a miserable run that has left them languishing in 14th place after nine games, already seven points away from the Champions League places for which they are expected to challenge."
13,01/10/2019,18:50,Nice sack teen forward over Dolberg watch theft,"Nice have terminated the contract of 18-year-old striker Lamine Diaby Fadiga after he admitted stealing a 70,000-euro ($76,500) watch from team-mate Kasper Dolberg, the club said Tuesday.","""Following the theft of Kasper Dolberg's watch from the professional first team's changing room, and the subsequent admission of the player, the club decided to cancel its contract with the 18-year-old forward with immediate effect,"" Nice said in a statement. ""Above and beyond all sporting and financial consideration, OGC Nice cannot and will not accept such behaviour."" Diaby Fadiga, a France Under-18 international, confessed to the theft last week and apologised to Dolberg, pledging to fully reimburse the Denmark international. The teenager could however find a new club in the coming days, with Ligue 2 side Paris FC reportedly considering a move for him."
14,01/09/2019,18:25,Nice depose Rennes to give Ratcliffe first victory,Nice won for the first time under new ownership to draw level on points with leaders Paris Saint-Germain on Sunday when they inflicted a first defeat of the season on Rennes.,"The 2-1 win moved Nice onto nine point after four games, the same as Rennes as well as champions PSG and Angers, who both won earlier in the weekend. The Parisians already have a significant advantage in goal difference. In the other early game on Sunday, last season's runners up Lille lost 2-0 at Reims. On Wednesday, in their first match after English petrochemical billionaire Jim Ratcliffe's Ineos completed his purchase of the club, Nice lost at home to Marseille. That game was dominated by the over 10-minute suspension ordered by match officials as part of a crackdown on offensive chanting from French football authorities. Nice started badly on Sunday at Roazhon Park. Defender Gautier Lloris, the younger brother of Tottenham goalkeeper Hugo, scored an own goal at a corner after 25 minutes. The visitors dominated the second half and won a penalty when Benjamin Bourigeaud and Hamari Traore sandwiched Youcef Atal. Wylan Cyprien converted from the spot. Nice won the game two minutes into added time. Racine Coly, at the far post from a corner, scored the winner with his knee. In Champagne country, Lille finished with 10 men. The game was still goalless when Lille midfielder Yusuf Yazici received a second yellow card after 52 minutes. The visitors conceded a penalty for a foul on Moussa Doumbia, and after a delay for video review, the winger converted in the 73rd minute. In the 90th minute, Remi Oudin's cross flew into the Lille net. The visitors won a penalty deep into added time, but goalkeeper Pedrag Rajkovic pushed Jonathan Bamba's spot kick onto the post. New signing Renato Sanches was first to the rebound but missed the goal. Later on Sunday struggling Monaco travel to Strasbourg and Marseille host Saint-Etienne."
15,28/08/2019,22:27,Ligue 1 match halted after Nice fans' homophobic chants,Marseille won their first match under new coach Andre Villas-Boas on Wednesday thanks to a 2-1 derby win at Nice in a match that was suspended in the first half following homophobic abuse from the home side's hardcore supporters.,"Dimitri Payet moved his side up to 13th on four points with a spot-kick with 17 minutes remaining after Nice midfielder Wylan Cyprien had levelled Dario Benedetto's first Marseille goal with his own penalty. The France international's strike also ended Nice's brief perfect start in the new season's third round of matches, but the clash was dominated by the over 10-minute suspension ordered by match officials as part of a crackdown on offensive chanting from French football authorities. Players from both teams were escorted from the pitch in the 28th minute of the contest following repeated appeals to Nice fans to stop chants of ""Marseille are a bunch of queers"" and ""Go fuck yourself, Ligue 1"". Fans also unfurled homophobic banners including one which called Marseille an ""LGBT club"". The second chant, sparked by the French league's attempt to stamp out homophobic chants from the stands, continued as the players returned down the tunnel, where they waited for the still-goalless match to recommence. Villas-Boas said referee Clement Turpin ""did the right thing in stopping the match"" adding that the abuse was ""above all a societal problem"", while Nice coach Patrick Vieira said that he was ""absolutely right to interrupt"" proceedings. French equalities minister Marlene Schiappa also congratulated on Twitter Turpin's ""respect for football"", and blasted ""a homophobic banner (which) dirtied the stands"". However, goalscorer Cyprien bemoaned Turpin's decision, saying that ""we can't stop every match each time some idiot does something, otherwise we will never play"". ""I am against all discrimination, be it against gays or racist abuse,"" he continued to Canal+. ""But we can't stop matches as soon as there are insults that have nothing to do with the gay community."" Instructions were sent to referees before the start of the season to stop matches if homophobic songs could be heard, and the Ligue 2 game on August 16 between Nancy and Le Mans was halted for a few minutes -- a first in France. That match only resumed after Nancy players pleaded with their fans to stop, but the club was still hit late on Wednesday with a one-game closure for one stand by the French league. The league has mooted the idea of introducing a list of banned words in football stadiums in an attempt to combat homophobia and bad language. On Sunday, a referee threatened to stop Monaco's 2-2 home draw with Nimes after the away fans insulted the league organisers with offensive language. The controversy comes just two days after Ineos announced their purchase of Nice, who were aiming to maintain their perfect start against fellow south coast side Marseille, yet to win under new coach Villas-Boas. Bob Ratcliffe, the brother of billionaire Jim Ratcliffe who owns petrochemical giant Ineos, looked on embarrassed from the stands as his team were forced off the field due to their fans' behaviour. Earlier, Nigerian starlet Victor Osimhen shot a brace that took him to the top of the Ligue 1 scoring charts as Lille cruised to a simple 3-0 win over Saint-Etienne. The 20-year-old fired in the hosts' opener shortly before the break and sealed the points with a fine turn-and-strike 15 minutes from the end, taking his tally to four goals from the season's opening three matches and moving Lille into fourth. Jonathan Bamba had added the second from the spot six minutes earlier after being upended by Mathieu Debuchy."
16,15/03/2019,23:32,Monaco edge away from relegation with Vinicius winner at Lille,Monaco moved nine points away from Ligue 1's relegation play-off spot as a 90th-minute Carlos Vinicius goal helped them beat second-place Lille 1-0 on Friday.,"The Brazilian scored his first goal for the Principality outfit since joining on-loan from Napoli in January as the hosts lost only for a second time at home in the league this campaign. Coach Leonardo Jardim, who led his side to the title in 2017, sees Monaco go clear of Dijon in 18th place with their fourth win in seven games since he returned to the Stade Louis II in January. ""A victory like today against the second-best team in the championship is very important,"" said Jardim. ""It's an important win, but we're still in a difficult situation."" The home side had the best of the early opportunities on goal as winger Jonathan Bamba hit the crossbar after 11 minutes with a left-footed effort. Bamba and Nicolas Pepe both had shots on goal to break the deadlock before the break but wasted their chances in front of Monaco goalkeeper Danijel Subasic. The visitors started the second half strongly as Aleksandr Golovin and Gelson Martins tested Mike Maignan before the 50-minute mark. Vinicius' first goal in Monaco colours came as he received the ball in the box. He took a deft touch with his toe to lift the ball over defender Jose Fonte, chested the ball down and slotted it past Maignan in the Lille goal. Lille remain 17 points behind leaders Paris Saint-Germain, who host arch-rivals Marseille on Sunday. Elsewhere on Friday, substitute Firmin Mubele clinched a 1-1 draw for Toulouse at Nice with an 89th-minute effort. On Saturday, bottom-of-the-table Guingamp can close the gap on Dijon, Caen host Saint-Etienne, Angers face lowly Amiens and Strasbourg head to Nimes."
17,13/03/2019,20:38,Balotelli celebration leaves ex-Nice teammates seething,"Mario Balotelli made headlines once again with a quirky goal celebration after firing the winner in Marseille's 1-0 victory over the fiery Italian's former club Nice, but there was one person who wasn't amused.","A week after his Instagram selfie video celebration against Saint-Etienne, Balotelli played 'rock, paper, scissors' with Florian Thauvin after bagging the decisive goal in the 61st minute of his first match against Nice, who he left in January having not scored a goal all season. Nice defender Christophe Herelle's verdict of Balotelli's antics was to the point: ""That goal celebration pissed me off."" ""He did not score a single goal in six months and I saw him running like never before. At some point you have to respect the club, the people and the fans,"" said Herelle ahead of Nice's match with Toulouse on Friday. At half-time the 28-year-old was filmed by Canal Plus arguing with his old teammates, with whom he had a tense relationship in his final months at Nice. ""He told us that he didn't want (Nice coach) Patrick Vieira coming out at the same time as him. I told him to shut it,"" Herelle said. Balotelli's winner on Sunday took his tally to five in seven matches since arriving at Marseille, and Rudi Garcia's side have seen a sudden upturn in form after a miserable winter that saw them dumped out of the French Cup by fourth-tier Andrezieux and finish bottom of their Europa League group. The win extended their unbeaten run to six -- with five wins -- ahead of Saturday's visit to hated rivals Paris Saint-Germain."
18,03/03/2019,20:18,Dembele nets double as Lyon thrash Toulouse,"Moussa Dembele scored twice as Lyon thrashed Toulouse 5-1 on Sunday to strengthen their grip on a top-three place in France, while second-placed Lille edged out Dijon.","Bruno Genesio's Lyon, who are also through to the French Cup semi-finals and claimed a 0-0 first-leg draw in the Champions League last 16 against Barcelona, continued their strong season by moving six points clear of fourth-placed Saint-Etienne. ""Often this season, we haven't been calm under pressure, but against Toulouse it was a good match,"" said Lyon captain Nabil Fekir, whose 21-year-old younger brother Yassin made his Ligue 1 debut as a 79th-minute substitute. ""Playing with my brother was a huge pleasure."" The home side took less than 10 minutes to break the deadlock at the Groupama Stadium as Memphis Depay fired home a wonderful individual goal. Mathieu Dossevi levelled for Toulouse on the quarter-hour mark, but the visitors folded after Bertrand Traore restored Lyon's advantage in the 30th minute. Nabil Fekir netted a penalty five minutes later, and former Celtic striker Dembele compounded Toulouse's misery in the second half. He powered through the pitiful away defence midway through the second period and slotted a left-footed shot into the corner, before tapping in his 13th goal of the season shortly afterwards from Fekir's low cross. Traore also had another goal ruled out by VAR for offside, while Toulouse finished the game with 10 men as former Bastia midfielder Yannick Cahuzac was sent off for the 11th time in his Ligue 1 career. Lille remain second behind Paris Saint-Germain after Christophe Galtier's men claimed a narrow 1-0 win over struggling Dijon. With PSG still 17 points clear at the top with a game in hand, Lille are well-placed to secure a return to the Champions League group stage for the first time since 2012. Dijon, who remain five points from safety in 19th spot, made life tough for Lille at the Stade Pierre-Mauroy until Wesley Lautoa put through his own net in the 72nd minute. ""We will continue to work to be able to hold off the teams who want to take our place, qualifying for the Champions League is a dream we will try to achieve,"" said Lille forward Rui Fonte. Elsewhere, Patrick Vieira's Nice boosted their hopes of qualifying for next season's Europa League as Youcef Atal's 20th-minute strike was enough to see off Strasbourg 1-0. Nice are seventh in the table, three points adrift of fourth-placed Saint-Etienne."
19,26/01/2019,23:12,Monaco plight persists in wake of Henry exit,"Monaco suffered another damaging defeat as they lost 2-0 at Dijon in Ligue 1 on Saturday, just 24 hours after reappointing former boss Leonardo Jardim to take over from the sacked Thierry Henry.","Former France and Arsenal star Henry was suspended and later axed by Monaco after just two wins in the league since his arrival in October. Jardim, who led Monaco to the French title in 2017, is returning to the club only three months after he was dismissed following a dreadful start to the season. His first game back in charge will be Tuesday's League Cup semi-final against Guingamp, as Henry's former assistant Franck Passi oversaw the trip to fellow strugglers Dijon. The abject nature of this latest defeat further emphasised Monaco's perilous position in the table where they remain second from bottom, a point above last-placed Guingamp. ""We're giving everything but it's not enough,"" said Monaco captain Radamel Falcao. ""Each player has to continue to give more, all of us together. We're all in the same boat. ""We didn't manage to change things with Thierry Henry and now we must carry on with a better spirit and all fight together."" Dijon's Kwon Chang-hoon notched his first league goal since May, having recently returned from an Achilles injury, with a calm finish on 24 minutes after a static Naldo played the South Korean onside. Monaco were reduced to 10 men on the hour when Brazilian Naldo saw red for a clumsy challenge on Julio Tavares, and another defensive lapse allowed Naim Sliti to wrap up what was just Dijon's second league win since August. It was Naldo's second red card in a week after he was also dismissed in the 5-1 loss to Strasbourg last Saturday. ""We had chances just like in the past four of five matches but we always make a mistake that kills us,"" said Passi, who refused to be drawn on his own future. ""We let the other team go ahead and we're chasing after the result and that obviously makes it harder,"" he added. ""These players have the quality. They have what it takes to stay up but they just need for things to click and for it to happen quickly."" Youcef Atal and Allan Saint-Maximin scored for Patrick Vieira's Nice in a 2-0 home win over Nimes, while Kenny Lala fired home a sweet half-volley with practically the final kick to give Strasbourg a 1-0 victory over Bordeaux. Reims climbed into the top half as a 1-0 win at Guingamp stretched their unbeaten run to six matches. On Sunday, leaders Paris Saint-Germain will host Rennes without the injured Neymar. The world's most expensive player limped out of Wednesday's French Cup win over Strasbourg after hurting his foot, an injury similar to the one that ruled him out for more than two months last season. PSG coach Thomas Tuchel has said it is ""still too early"" to assess the seriousness of Neymar's injury, leaving the French giants sweating over his fitness ahead of their Champions League clash with Manchester United next month."
20,23/01/2019,16:24,Balotelli completes six-month move to Marseille,"Marseille have completed the signing of Italy striker Mario Balotelli from their French rivals Nice, the Ligue 1 club confirmed on Wednesday.","Balotelli, 28, has signed for the former European champions until the end of the season after being released from the remainder of his contract by Nice and passing a medical at the Velodrome earlier in the day. The impending arrival of the former AC Milan, Inter and Liverpool forward, who has scored 14 goals in 36 games for Italy, had been confirmed to AFP on Tuesday by sources close to the deal. Marseille coach Rudi Garcia said this week that signing Balotelli was his ""number one priority"". OM are currently seventh in Ligue 1 and have struggled for goals after failing in an attempt to bring Balotelli to the club last summer. Their main strikers, Valere Germain and Kostas Mitroglou, have scored just three league goals each so far this season. Balotelli netted 33 goals in 51 league appearances for Nice over the last two seasons, but leaves the Cote d'Azur club without having found the net in the current campaign. Having not featured for Patrick Vieira's side since early December, Garcia has already ruled out any prospect of Balotelli starting when Marseille play Lille on Friday evening."
21,16/01/2019,21:20,"Henry, Vieira reunion ends in stalemate on Cote d'Azur",It was honours even between Thierry Henry and Patrick Vieira as the old France and Arsenal teammates clashed for the first time as coaches on Wednesday in a controversy-laden 1-1 draw between Monaco and Nice.,"The presence of the two greats in the respective dugouts made an international event out of what is usually little more than a hotly contested local derby on the Cote d'Azur. It was a spicy encounter, with Allan Saint-Maximin putting Nice ahead before youngster Benoit Badiashile levelled for the hosts in the second half. Nice played half the game with 10 men but also saw Saint-Maximin miss a great chance to win all three points when he had a late penalty saved. Members of France's 1998 World Cup-winning side and later colleagues for six years in Arsene Wenger's Arsenal team, Henry and Vieira embraced warmly before kick-off at the Stade Louis II. They did so again at full-time, both allowing themselves a smile even though the stalemate will likely not satisfy either man. Henry's Monaco are scrapping to pull away from the relegation zone in Ligue 1, and they remain 19th in the table, three points adrift of outright safety. They have still not won at home this season. Vieira's Nice, meanwhile, have lost just once in 10 league matches but might regret dropping two points in their quest to qualify for Europe. The 41-year-old Henry has now won just twice in 11 league games since being appointed to his first coaching job in October, although performances have improved since the turn of the year. He will also wonder how this game might have ended had he been able to call on the services of new signing Cesc Fabregas. The Spaniard -- another former protege of Wenger's at Arsenal -- joined from Chelsea last week and made his debut at Marseille on Sunday. Unveiled to the media earlier on Wednesday, he was nevertheless ineligible for this match because it was originally supposed to be played in December before being called off due to security concerns linked to the 'yellow vest' protest movement in France. Fabregas instead watched from the stands, and he saw Saint-Maximin, a former Monaco player, put Nice in front on the half-hour mark, running through to score after some sloppy play from the home side. That has characterised Monaco's season, but they were helped when Nice were reduced to 10 men in stoppage time at the end of the first half. Ihsan Sacko raked his studs down the calf of Benjamin Henrichs, and was shown a straight red card after the referee reviewed the images. The hosts then drew level early in the second half, Badiashile's header just crossing the line despite the best efforts of Nice 'keeper Walter Benitez. There was controversy as referee Benoit Bastien used VAR again to give 10-man Nice a penalty in the 76th minute, despite the footage suggesting that Youcef Atal had dived. Henry will feel that justice was done, though, as Saint-Maximin's kick was saved by Diego Benaglio. The home side could still have won it late on, but Radamel Falcao's shot came back off the post, and Monaco are now just a point clear of bottom side Guingamp, who defeated Rennes 2-1. Champions League hopefuls Lyon needed a brilliant late free-kick by Nabil Fekir to grab a point in a 2-2 draw at Toulouse, while Nimes beat Nantes 1-0."
22,15/01/2019,02:25,"Henry, Vieira set for reunion",Thierry Henry renews acquaintances with former France and Arsenal team-mate Patrick Vieira on Wednesday when Monaco face Nice as part of a rearranged batch of midweek fixtures in Ligue 1.,"The coaching showdown between two of France's 1998 World Cup winners was first scheduled for December 7, but the game was postponed amid security concerns over the ongoing ""yellow vest"" protests in France over rising living costs. Since taking over at the Stade Louis II, Henry has won just two of 10 league matches as Monaco find themselves second from bottom and four points from safety midway through the season. The 2017 French champions have sought to address their plight with a number of January recruits -- Cesc Fabregas, Naldo and Fode Ballo-Toure all started Sunday's 1-1 draw at Marseille. ""Fabregas got better as the minutes ticked by,"" said Henry of the Spaniard's promising debut at the weekend. ""He managed to take the match in his grasp and read between the lines. We could have finished certain moves off better, but we're on the right track."" ""We had to react and we did that. The draw will be a good result if there are wins after it,"" he added. ""Now we need to string things together and continue to pick up points."" Experienced midfielder William Vainqueur has also joined on loan from Antalyaspor, however, none of Monaco's new signings are eligible to feature against Nice as the game was originally due to be played before the reopening of the transfer window. Striker Radamel Falcao is highly doubtful due to illness, although France international Djibril Sidibe is set to return after two months out with injury. Goalkeeper Danijel Subasic is back in training as well, having made just two appearances for the club this term because of a thigh problem. ""As soon as he's operational he will be back in the group for sure,"" said Henry. ""I'm counting on him a lot."" Cote d'Azur rivals Nice are within four points of the Champions League spots after a stuttering start to life under Vieira, whose name was chanted by home fans during Saturday's 1-0 win over Bordeaux. ""It's important and it really touches me. When we say 'the club', that includes everybody, the supporters included, it's a family,"" said Vieira, whose side are level with sixth-placed Strasbourg after a run of just one defeat in nine outings. ""It's better to be here than at the bottom. But then the league is very tight, a run of two to three matches in either way could change the table a lot,"" he added. Runaway leaders Paris Saint-Germain, who are 13 points clear of Lille with two games in hand, are at a mid-season training camp in Doha and will make up their match at home to Montpellier on February 20. Marseille's run of eight games without a win in all competitions -- including a shock French Cup loss to fourth-tier Andrezieux -- prompted a frosty reception at the Velodrome for the draw with Monaco. Supporters held up a banner that read ""owners, coach, players... all guilty"", with Marseille languishing in ninth and eliminated from all three cup competitions. ""The hostile reaction from the crowd didn't help, obviously,"" said coach Rudi Garcia. ""What counts is how the players responded out on the pitch, the solidarity that they showed even after the match. The players going to see the fans as a group was a nice image."" Marseille visit Saint-Etienne on Wednesday, while Lyon will look to stay ahead of their bitter rivals ahead of Sunday's Rhone derby as they travel to Toulouse.

23,29/12/2018,19:30,Vieira tells Balotelli to decide on Nice future,Troublesome Italian striker Mario Balotelli has been given extended leave by French outfit Nice and told to make up his mind about his plans with the club.,"Under contract at Nice until the end of the 2018-2019 season, the 28-year-old has scored 33 goals in 51 games since joining the Ligue 1 side in 2016. Observers however feel Patrick Vieira -- who took over as coach in June and has overseen just seven wins in 18 league matches -- is ready to transfer Balotelli during the winter break with interest reported in England and Turkey. ""I have given Mario a few extra days off to think about his future and what he wants to do,"" said Vieira, who played alongside the giant centre-forward at Manchester City and Inter Milan. ""He's under contract here and everything is possible, if we can come to a common agreement who knows,"" said Vieira. Balotelli came close to a move to Marseille over the summer and returned to training late and unfit after the deal fell through."

PSG coach Thomas Tuchel can also go on holiday relaxed with his club on 47 points, as second-placed Lille, 13 points adrift, lost 2-1 at home to Toulouse. ""I'm very happy because we can see the progress of the team,"" said Tuchel. ""You can feel the energy, it's a good thing to build on next year."" With Neymar away, Angel Di Maria was in the line-up and came closest to making it 2-0, forcing a fine save from Nantes goalkeeper Ciprian Tatarusanu, who then watched the Argentine hit the crossbar from the rebound. Meanwhile, third-placed Lyon drew 1-1 at fourth-placed Montpellier after opening the scoring thanks to their captain Nabil Fekir before a great header from Ruben Aguilar gave the surprise-package southerners a share of the spoils. Henry's Monaco were dreadful and the former Arsenal striker spat on the ground after Nolan Roux of Guingamp made fools of the Monaco defence to make it 2-0. ""I'm not going to have a good holiday,"" bemoaned Henry. ""Now you have to work and make do with what you have. ""It's necessary to work and work. There are still a lot of points to play for and that's the only positive thing about this evening."" Monaco were champions in 2017 but now have 13 points from 18 matches, just two more than Guingamp, and vice-president Vadim Vasilyev said the club needs to dip into the January transfer market. ""Until tonight, I thought we didn't need new players, but we do,"" Vasilyev told Canal+. ""It's difficult to analyse right now as I'm upset like the supporters. I understand the disappointment, it's up to us to act and draw the right conclusions."" Strasbourg paid hommage to the victims of a terror attack that killed five people on December 11 in their first home game since as they won 2-0 against Nice. Meanwhile, Marseille, in sixth, drew 1-1 at Angers and fifth-placed Saint-Etienne beat Dijon 3-0."

Both teams also had their matches called off last week, ahead of a weekend of ""yellow vest"" anti-government protests in France that descended into violence in Paris and several other cities. LFP said it would reschedule the other match, between Nantes, scene of violent demonstrations last weekend, and Montpellier, at a later date. The league said it had taken the decision ""because of current events and the assignment of the police on other missions"". Last Saturday, protests in Nanted by nearly 3,000 people resulted in 13 arrests and injuries to five police officers and three protesters. Last weekend, six Ligue 1 matches were postponed at the request of local authorities. They are due to be played in midweek on January 15 and 16. In addition to possible protests, the government have increased security levels following a deadly attack on the Christmas Market in Strasbourg on Tuesday."

Sunday night's encounter between Saint-Etienne and Marseille and Saturday's meeting of Angers and Bordeaux have also been postponed on the request of local authorities. The latest postponements come after Paris Saint-Germain's game against Montpellier and Lyon's trip to Toulouse -- scheduled for Saturday -- were both called off due to security concerns, and the possibility remains that all other French top-flight games could be postponed too. Since November 17, demonstrators wearing yellow, high-visibility vests have blockaded roads in protest against higher taxes on diesel fuel. Demonstrations turned particularly violent last Saturday, with 412 people arrested after the worst clashes in central Paris for decades. A new round of protests is expected this weekend. The Cote d'Azur derby was due to see Monaco take on a Nice side coached by Patrick Vieira, Henry's former teammate at Arsenal and the French national side. Henry oversaw just his second win in 10 games in charge of struggling Monaco as they beat Amiens 2-0 away on Tuesday with a brace of penalties by Radamel Falcao, but the 2017 champions remain in the bottom three. Five games will go ahead including second place Lille who welcome Reims looking to close the gap with PSG to 11 points."

Vieira may need a good run of results if he is to keep his job long enough to take on former Arsenal and France teammate Thierry Henry when his side visit Monaco on December 8. ""Unfortunately, tonight's match reflects our other home games,"" said Vieira. ""(Forwards) Allan (Saint-Maximin), Mario (Balotelli) and Myziane (Maolida) have not been successful. In the last 30 metres there has been a lack of quality, we haven't always made the right choices."" For Marseille, all eyes will now be on next Sunday's clash with arch rivals and runaway league leaders Paris Saint-Germain at the Velodrome. The hosts went into the match having mustered only seven goals in nine league games this season, and Vieira responded by handing Mario Balotelli just his third start of the campaign up front. The first decent chance at the Allianz Riviera fell to the Italy international, but after latching onto a long ball forward from Dante his well-struck volley was kept out by the legs of Marseille goalkeeper Steve Mandanda. A clever dummy from Balotelli created space for Allan Saint-Maximin, but his shot was tame and easily gathered by Mandanda. The away side grabbed the lead in the 42nd minute, though, as full-back Bouna Sarr skipped clear down the right-hand side and crossed for Sanson to smartly turn and fire into the bottom corner. Nice plugged away in search of an equaliser but never looked like having the quality to break through, with centre-back Dante's looping volley onto the roof of the net the best effort Vieira's men could muster. Balotelli, who was strongly linked with Marseille during the close-season before opting to stay at Nice, has failed to score this term after netting 43 goals over the last two campaigns. ""Mario? He was just like the team -- very good in the first half, then he wasn't as good. He still has to work,"" said Vieira. Earlier on Sunday, Montpellier moved into third as goals from Gaetan Laborde and Andy Delort sealed a 2-0 win over Bordeaux, while Saint-Etienne drew 1-1 against Rennes. Henry suffered a miserable return to French football on Saturday as Monaco lost at Strasbourg in his first match as a head coach, while PSG thrashed Amiens to make it 10 successive wins to start the season."

With 24 points, PSG, chasing a sixth French title in seven seasons, are sure to end the weekend at least eight points clear of their closest challengers. PSG have lost this season, in the Champions League, and with Red Star Belgrade visiting Parc des Princes on Wednesday, coach Thomas Tuchel left Marco Verratti and Edinson Cavani on the bench and also experimented again with a back three. His team still dominated Nice goalkeeper Walter Benitez turned away early efforts from Adrien Rabiot and Kylian Mbappe. Then Angel di Maria hit a post. In the 22nd minute, Christopher Nkunku surged down the right and slid the ball to Mbappe, who completely missed his shot. The ball was retrieved by Moussa Diaby who rolled it to Neymar and the Brazilian curled his shot into the net from 22 metres. PSG wasted several chances before half-time and in the 44th minute Mbappe set up Neymar, who netted from close range only for VAR to show a marginal offside. Nice coach Patrick Vieira threw on Mario Balotelli for the second half, but any hopes of a fightback were quickly punctured. A minute after the restart, Di Maria released Mbappe who raced through the visiting defence and evaded Benitez and one defender. When his shot struck another Nice player, the ball fell to Nkunku who popped it into the goal. Nice finished the game with 10 men. Wylan Cyprien, a first-half substitute, earned a second yellow for whacking Neymar in the face with an elbow while leaping for a header. Cyprien went off, Neymar continued, holding a bandage to his bleeding mouth. In the dying seconds, Mbappe again burst clear and squared the ball to Neymar who tapped in his second."
29,21/08/2018,00:17,"Balotelli opts to stay at Nice, say French club","Mario Balotelli has signed a new deal to stay at Nice despite strong interest from French rivals Marseille, the Ligue 1 club announced on Monday.","The striker, whose strong form in the last two seasons at the Allianz Riviera has seen him return to the Italy team, has scored 43 goals for the club. Nice have got off to a slow start this year under new coach Patrick Vieira, with the former Arsenal and France midfielder seeing his charges lose at home to Reims and draw at Caen. But the decision of the 28-year-old Balotelli to stay will be a massive boost to Vieira and his team. ""After careful consideration, Mario Balotelli has decided to stay at OGC Nice,"" the club said in a statement. ""The Italian international expressed his wishes to the directors. There will be a third season for the forward. The agreement was signed by all parties on Monday evening."" Balotelli had also been linked with a possible move to Serie A, with Roma and Napoli reportedly interested, but it was Marseille and the Stade Velodrome where he was expected to arrive before the end of the month. Nice were quick to poke fun at their near neighbours' failure to land the enigmatic former Manchester City, Inter Milan, Liverpool and AC Milan forward. ""Made slightly complicated at the start of the summer by another club from the south of France, the situation is now back to normal,"" said Nice. ""Simple, clear. Like one of SuperMario's strikes."""

Vieira, who arrived in June from New York City FC of Major League Soccer, is the third member of the class of '98 to manage in Ligue 1 after World Cup winning coach Didier Deschamps, who was at Monaco and Marseille, and Laurent Blanc, who had spells at Bordeaux and Paris Saint-Germain. Once again, Nice president Jean-Pierre Rivere has shown his knack for recruiting big names either on the bench, where Vieira follows Claude Puel and Favre or on the field where Hatem Ben Arfa, Wesley Sneijder and Mario Balotelli have all played for the club. Rivere sees Vieira as, above all, the man to build a team based on attractive football and youthful talent. ""We did not recruit a name, nor a world champion, nor did we take a gamble,"" said Rivere after hiring Vieira. ""Our project is very clear and projects are run by men. The goal is to keep the club growing, and after 20 minutes of talking with Patrick, I told him: 'You are exactly what we are looking for'."" At 42, the challenge is daunting for the native of Dakar who played 107 times for France but had long left Ligue 1 when he won the World Cup. At 19 he moved to Serie A and played for both Milan clubs, Juventus and Arsenal in England before retiring as a player with Manchester City in 2011. He spent two seasons coaching City's under-21 team before moving to the club's New York cousin. ""I did not think twice before signing for Nice,"" said Vieira, who started his career along the Riviera at Cannes in 1994. ""I have confidence in my ability to manage."" Though he is smiling and open, Vieira is unbending on his basic principals. ""He is tolerant but knows how to pull you back into line when necessary. He puts the team before any other consideration,"" veteran Nice defender Christophe Jallet told AFP. ""A healthy mentality."" Balotelli found this out when he arrived at camp late after a transfer failed to materialise. He had to train alone to catch up physically before joining the rest of the squad this week. ""Everything is based on group cohesion,"" said midfielder Pierre Lees-Melou. ""In the morning, we breakfast together at 07:30 am. We train from 9.00 to 11.00. Then there is treatment and lunch at the club,"" Vieira knows what he wants. ""It's important for me to play forward, in a style that expresses the talent of the players,"" he said. Now it is up to those players to put that into practice."
31,11/06/2018,19:08,France and Arsenal great Vieira takes over as Nice coach,"After more than 20 years away, former Arsenal and France star Patrick Vieira, is returning to Ligue 1 to take the reins at Nice where he was unveiled as manager on Monday.","""I'm very happy to return to France, which I left at the age of 19 or 20,"" Vieira told a press conference. ""Returning to Ligue 1 was honestly always an objective, but I wanted to do so in the best circumstances and I think that's the case."" Vieira, 41, arrives after a stint at MLS outfit New York City FC. He has signed a three-year contract and replaces Lucien Favre who is moving to Borussia Dortmund. Nice released a statement describing the 1998 World Cup winner as a ""monument of French football"", whose dynamism and charisma had made him the obvious choice. Vieira said he had several conversations with the club's sporting director Julien Fournier and the president Jean-Pierre Rivere ""I was seduced by the project but above all by the men carrying it out,"" Vieira said. ""When I look at the squad, I was very eager, it's very encouraging. I think there's everything here that it takes to succeed."" The former midfield dynamo started his playing career at Cannes but left in 1995 for a brief spell AC Milan before becoming the rock on which Arsenal built a decade of glory, starring for the Gunners from 1996-2005. After winning three Premier League titles and three FA Cups with Arsenal, he joined Juventus for a season as the club topped Serie A but were stripped of the title and then had four years with Inter Milan each of which ended with a Serie A crown. ""My career as a player no longer counts, it's part of my past,"" Vieira said. ""I know the sacrifices necessary to progress and I hope, of course, to help the young players express their talent and that I can guide them."" Vieira played 107 times for France and was part of the squads that won the World Cup and Euro 2000. ""As for my honours with clubs or with Les Bleus, that will give me the confidence of the players for three months,"" he said. ""After that I need to win their trust and be clear what I want from them."" Vieira retired as a player in 2011 and moved into coaching taking charge of the under-19 and under-21 Manchester City teams before coaching New York, which shares its owner with City. He leaves New York second in the MLS Eastern Conference after Friday's draw with Atlanta. ""I've come to know myself and my personality over the last three, four years on the coach's bench,"" Vieira said. ""I've learned from all of my former coaches."" In a statement announcing the hiring, the Riveira club had said they were ""looking for a coach with the ability to continue to play flowing football, bring on young players and take the risk of having them evolve while bringing a winning spirit to the table. That coach is Patrick Vieira."" Vieira, a powerful, battling midfielder with a deft touch on the ball, expressed a similar vision. ""I want a team that pushes forward creatively, in which the players express their qualities,"" Vieira said. ""Nice has set the bar pretty high in recent years in terms of beautiful football."" jgi-mdm/pb/lp <org>BORUSSIA DORTMUND</org> <org>JUVENTUS FOOTBALL CLUB</org>"
32,20/05/2018,12:09,Coach Favre to quit Nice amid Dortmund rumours,"French coach Lucien Favre said he is leaving Ligue 1 club Nice after his side lost their final match of the season at Lyon on Saturday, amid speculation of a move to Borussia Dortmund.","German media have been reporting in recent weeks that the 60-year-old is set to return to the Bundesliga with Dortmund, having previously taken Borussia Moenchengladbach to the Champions League during a four-year spell in charge from 2011. ""It was necessary to work to stabilise Nice in the top eight (in France), in 2013 the club was 17th,"" he said. ""I will leave Nice and France. But I cannot say any more."" Favre, who also worked in Germany with Hertha Berlin from 2007-2009, led Nice to a third-placed finish last season, although they lost in the Champions League playoff round to Napoli last August. But this term a poor start to their league campaign proved costly, as Saturday's 3-2 loss at Lyon ensured they finished eighth and missed out on European football altogether."
33,20/05/2018,12:06,Depay treble sees Lyon beat Nice and pip Marseille to Champions League spot,Memphis Depay struck a wonderful hat-trick as Lyon fought back to beat Nice 3-2 at the Groupama Stadium on Saturday to qualify for the Champions League from Ligue 1 at the expense of Marseille.,"Monaco saw off relegated Troyes 3-0 to wrap up second spot behind champions Paris Saint-Germain, as Bruno Genesio's Lyon finished one point clear of Marseille in third after a dramatic final day of the season. It capped a miserable week for beaten Europa League finalists Marseille, who will have to make do with a return to Europe's second-tier competition despite beating Amiens 2-1. Nice missed out on the Europa League with Saturday's defeat, and coach Lucien Favre announced he was leaving the club after the game. Marseille's defeat by Atletico Madrid on Wednesday in Lyon had ensured that the third-placed finishers in Ligue 1 would join the top two in the group stage of Europe's premier competition, rather than face the qualifying rounds. ""The group this year has done very well, it is a fair reward to finish third,"" Lyon captain Nabil Fekir told French television, before refusing to commit his future to the club. ""I don't know, frankly. I gave everything at Lyon, we'll see for the future. It hasn't been perfect this season, but it's a good finish."" Lyon were the first of the three sides in contention to slip up, as Alassane Plea raced clean through on goal and fired through the legs of home goalkeeper Anthony Lopes to put Nice ahead. OL desperately needed a quick leveller after half-time and Depay provided just that. Fekir did excellently to twist into space and square for Depay to tap home. Depay has arguably been the best player in France during the latter stages of the season, and the Dutchman produced the moment of magic needed to send Lyon into the Champions League. The former Manchester United flop showed magnificent creativity and execution to roll a free-kick under the wall and into the bottom corner to score his 18th goal of the campaign and his ninth in as many games. Depay completed a sublime treble late on by dinking the ball over away goalkeeper Walter Benitez, and although Plea fired home from long range in the 89th minute, Lyon held on as Nice missed on a Europa League spot. Marseille struck first in the race for the Champions League against Amiens at the Stade Velodrome, as teenager Boubacar Kamara's clever pass picked out Morgan Sanson who slammed a fierce shot into the roof of the net to give Rudi Garcia's men an 11th-minute lead against Troyes. Just seconds after Lyon fell behind at the Groupama Stadium, things got even better for Garcia's team as Kostas Mitroglou reacted quickest after Lucas Ocampos' header was saved to stab in the ninth goal of his first Ligue 1 season. But Amiens hit back to give Lyon a boost, as Moussa Konate took advantage of some terrible home defending to halve the deficit before half-time. Visiting midfielder Thomas Monconduit was rightly sent off for a horrendous challenge as he slammed his studs into the planted leg of Ocampos, who was lucky not to escape serious injury, early in the second half. Marseille saw out the win, but the three points provided little joy as results elsewhere meant they wasted two chances to return to Europe's top table in just four days. ""Everyone started screaming in the stands and we thought it was 3-3 in Lyon,"" said Marseille star forward Florian Thauvin. ""We've had a good season, but haven't been rewarded."" Monaco knew that they would be assured of a Champions League place if they avoided defeat and a double from Rony Lopes and Jordi Mboula's late strike saw them relegate Troyes with a comfortable win. That result sent Troyes down to the second tier with already-relegated Metz, as Toulouse secured a playoff with a 2-1 victory over Guingamp. Elsewhere, Caen held champions Paris Saint-Germain to a goalless draw to secure safety, while Bordeaux thrashed Metz 4-0 to join Marseille and Rennes in the Europa League."
34,16/03/2018,14:03,Tough market: France's Ligue 1 makes play for Asia,France's Ligue 1 will make a belated play for the lucrative Asian market when Paris Saint-Germain take on Nice in a specially scheduled match on Sunday.,"Entering a time slot long occupied by rival European competitions, the game will kick off at 1200 GMT -- 1:00 pm in France, and 8:00 pm in China. One big problem is the absence of injured Brazilian star Neymar, who is a huge draw for Asian fans but is recuperating after foot surgery. But Didier Quillot, general manager of the French Professional Football League (LFP) said he hoped the game would attract ""several million"" viewers in Asia. ""It's an exceptional coverage. This is part of the international development strategy of Ligue 1, and in order to have a better exposure in China,"" Quillot told AFP. ""We chose to do it with a flagship match, with PSG playing."" Sunday's game has strong competition, with Spain's La Liga, the English FA Cup, Germany's Bundesliga and Italy's Serie A all having matches at a similar time. It will be shown live on two paid-for streaming services in China, as well as regional TV networks in Shanghai and Guangzhou, probably only reaching a small fraction of China's vast viewership. The game will also be screened in Japan, Hong Kong, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia and Singapore, Quillot said. ""We are far behind (other leagues) and need to catch up,"" Quillot said. ""Our visibility is not good enough right now."" Philippe Demizieux of Shanghai-based Mailman, a digital marketing company which counts PSG as a client, said it was ""inevitable"" Neymar's absence would affect Sunday's viewing figures. ""Mailman research shows that especially in China, fans follow more an athlete than the team itself,"" he said. ""They love Neymar so (support of PSG) is not because of PSG but because of Neymar."" But he maintained that French football could rival the popularity of the English Premier League, the runaway market leader in Asia, or the Bundesliga, if a Ligue 1 team reaches the final stages of the Champions League. ""If we manage to get PSG in the semi-finals or final of the Champions League maybe we can get (to the same popularity) but the Champions League is crucial,"" he said. Despite splashing out 400 million euros ($490 million) on Neymar and French teenage striker Kylian Mbappe to mount a challenge for Europe's top club prize, PSG crashed out of the Champions League against Real Madrid at the last-16 stage this month. Demizieux said viewing parties would be held this weekend by PSG's fan groups in China, which are based in Harbin, Shenzhen, Guangzhou and Shanghai. The French league has also arranged a viewing for PSG and Nice fans in Guangzhou, he said. But they will have to wait a while for their next Sunday night Ligue 1 game: Quillot said there will be no more this season, although another ""two or three"" were planned for next season. ehl-pst-th/gj"

""After hearing from the representatives of Dijon and Nice, and reading the report of the officials, the commission decided to dismiss the case concerning Dijon,"" said a statement from the French Professional League (FLP) disciplinary commission. ""The commission decided, however, to withdraw the yellow card given to the player Mario Balotelli."" The referee who booked Balotelli while the Nice striker was complaining of racist abuse in the game has said he ""didn't hear insults or shouts from the stand"". ""If I had heard 'monkey chants' as indicated in the query by Nice, I would at no point have given Mario Balotelli a yellow card,"" Nicolas Rainville said."

Balotelli was booked for gesticulating angrily at the crowd in the game on Saturday. He then complained to the referee that he had been subjected to racist abuse. Nice had posted a message on Twitter during the match claiming Balotelli had ""picked up a yellow card after... getting annoyed at fans' racist abuse"". British organisation Kick It Out, which campaigns against discrimination, weighed in with a statement saying it ""was shocked to see Mario Balotelli booked for bringing to the attention of the referee alleged racist chanting directed towards him by Dijon supporters"". Kick It Out said it ""expects a strong response from the French football authorities"". Nice president Jean-Pierre Rivere said Balotelli, whose biological parents are from Ghana, has ""all our support"". ""We deplore the fact that Mario has again had to suffer racist abuse,"" he said. ""It's unforgivable, and let's not forget that it is unfortunately not the first time in our league."" Last season Bastia were hit with a suspended one-point deduction and three-game partial stand closure by the French League over the behaviour of some of their fans. The club cancelled the season ticket of one fan in his 40s while a court in Bastia handed the supporter a two-month suspended prison sentence, a 1,000 euro ($1,227) fine and an 18-month stadium ban. Balotelli was also targeted while playing for both Inter Milan and AC Milan in his homeland. During Euro 2012, UEFA punished the Croatian Football federation and investigated Spain following racist abuse directed at Balotelli by fans. In 2014 British police investigated offensive remarks directed at Balotelli, who has played for both Manchester City and Liverpool, on Twitter. adc-mam/pgr/jde/bc/jc"
39,11/02/2018,15:03,Balotelli 'booked for racist abuse complaint',"Mario Balotelli was booked during Nice's 3-2 loss at Dijon for complaining about racist abuse, his French Ligue 1 club and a local newspaper have claimed.","A tweet from Nice at half-time in Saturday's match said Balotelli had ""picked up a yellow card after... getting annoyed at fans' racist abuse"". Local newspaper Nice Matin in its match report said Balotelli ""eyeballed and pointed his finger"" at fans and ""complained of racist abuse"". The newspaper said Dijon goalkeeper Baptiste Reynet had tried to calm down a furious Balotelli telling him he ""hadn't heard any racist chants"", to which the Italian forward replied it was coming from ""two or three supporters"". Nice Matin said Balotelli's booking was for his reaction to the Dijon fans, after which he had ""alerted the fourth official to the alleged abuse"". It would not be the first time Balotelli, 27, has been targeted by racist abuse, in France and beyond. Last season some Bastia fans hurled insults at the former Liverpool, Inter Milan and AC Milan forward, who is of Ghanian origin. He was the target of racist chanting back in his homeland with Juventus fans accused numerous times, as well as Inter supporters when he was playing against his old club for their city rivals Milan. Before Euro 2012, Balotelli had threatened to ""walk off the pitch"" if he was abused by fans in Poland or Ukraine. That came after the BBC aired a documentary showing hardline ultra fans in both countries making Nazi salutes and monkey chants. The Croatian Football Federation was fined during that tournament for racist abuse by fans directed at Balotelli, while UEFA also investigated Spain following their match with Italy. In 2014, British police investigated offensive remarks directed at Balotelli on Twitter."
40,09/01/2018,23:48,Lemar helps Monaco beat Nice in League Cup quarters,Thomas Lemar scored as Monaco beat Cote d'Azur rivals Nice 2-1 at the Allianz Riviera on Tuesday to reach the French League Cup semi-finals.,"Lemar, who has been heavily linked with a move to England, nodded Monaco into an early lead, before Alassane Plea equalised after a video review. Monaco moved back in front before half-time through 21-year-old Adama Diakhaby and Leonardo Jardim's French champions held on with the aid of a terrible miss by Nice midfielder Pierre Lees-Melou. ""This victory was deserved and it is very important for our fans,"" said Monaco coach Jardim after his side's sixth straight win. ""Diakhaby is progressing, even if he's not doing everything right, he's young and we believe in him."" The Video Assistant Referee (VAR) is being used for the rest of the competition as a test ahead of its expected arrival in Ligue 1 next season, having been used in the promotion/relegation play-off last year. ""It's good, we're losing two or three minutes in the whole game,"" Jardim said. ""Errors will decrease, not totally, but by 80 percent."" The hosts were given a blow before kick-off as the in-form Mario Balotelli failed to regain fitness in time after suffering with glute pain. Monaco made a fast start and took the lead in only the third minute, as Lemar found space to head in Keita Balde's cross from close range to score his third goal of an injury-hit season and send out a message to potential suitors at Arsenal and Liverpool. The 22-year-old drilled into the roof of the net 10 minutes later, only to be denied a second goal by the linesman's flag for offside. Nice levelled against the run of play in the 18th minute as Plea ran onto Allan Saint-Maximin's pass and slotted past Diego Benaglio at the Monaco goalkeeper's near post. The referee checked with VAR for offside, but replays showed that Plea had timed his run to perfection before grabbing his 10th goal of the campaign. The visitors continued to be the better side, though, and they retook the lead as forward Diakhaby sent a half-volley flying into the corner from another excellent Balde delivery. Nice threw bodies forwards in the second half without creating many clear-cut chances, but Lees-Melou should have equalised when he headed wide with the goal gaping from only three yards out. Runaway Ligue 1 leaders Paris Saint-Germain, who have won four straight League Cups, will look to extend their incredible 34-match winning streak in domestic cup games at Amiens on Wednesday."

He was then sent off for the third time in Ligue 1 since moving to Nice at the start of last season, receiving a straight red card for chopping down Dijon defender Cedric Yambere from behind with a minute left. Balotelli remonstrated with the fourth official as he went off but Nice held on to end a run of four successive league defeats and six consecutive losses in all competitions. They climb back up to 15th, one point and one place above Dijon. Elsewhere on Sunday, Lyon can reclaim third place from Nantes with a win away to Saint-Etienne in the Rhone derby, one of the biggest fixtures in French football. Struggling Lille go to bottom club Metz with rumours swirling that enigmatic Argentine coach Marcelo Bielsa could lose his job in the event of another slip-up. Marseille, in fifth, host Caen at the Velodrome in an atmosphere made tense after Patrice Evra was suspended by the club for aiming a karate kick at the head of one of his team's own supporters. Evra was red-carded after the incident, which occurred in the pre-match warm-up before Thursday's Europa League defeat to Vitoria Guimaraes in Portugal. A banner at one end of the ground on Sunday carried the slogan ""This Game is Over"" in English, parodying Evra's favourite slogan of ""I love this game"". Chants also rang out insulting the 36-year-old former Manchester United and Juventus left-back."
42,27/10/2017,22:40,Cavani doubles up to send PSG seven points clear,Suspended Neymar watched from the stands as Edinson Cavani's brace inspired Paris Saint-Germain to a 3-0 win over Nice on Friday to send Unai Emery's side seven points clear in Ligue 1.,"Cavani's first half double, both assists provided by Angel Di Maria, earned unbeaten PSG their ninth league win of the season. It pushed them up to 29 points, seven clear of defending champions Monaco who face Bordeaux on Saturday. And it was the ideal warm-up ahead of Tuesday's clash with Anderlecht when they can secure a place in the Champions League last 16. The win also served to erase the memory of last week's draining 2-2 draw with hated rivals Marseille. Neymar was absent for only the second time since his world record signing, the Brazilian copping a one-match ban after being sent off in that stormy visit to the south coast. Di Maria filled Neymar's expensive shoes on only his second start since August. Emery introduced centre back Presnel Kimpembe for Marquinhos with Spanish left-back Yuri Berchiche replacing Layvin Kurzawa. Rightback Dani Alves returned but veteran midfielder Thiago Motta was absent because of a knee complaint Mario Balotelli was a welcome starter for the visitors after missing last week's 2-1 loss to Strasbourg with a calf knock. Nice coach Lucien Favre was forced into an unscripted last minute change when keeper Yoan Cardinale suffered an injury in warm-up with Walter Benitez summoned off the bench. The Argentine stand-in keeper was quickly put to work by PSG as Di Maria fired in an inch perfect freekick from the left with the match barely three minutes old. Cavani dived low to head past Benitez by the near post to bring a smile to the face of Neymar and to secure a place in his club's history with their 2,500th league goal. Balotelli tested PSG keeper Alphonse Areola with a long range effort down at the other end but that proved a rare respite for Benitez. On 31 minutes Cavani claimed his 99th Ligue 1 goal when the Uruguayan ran onto Di Maria's neat flick to round the on-rushing Benitez and slide the ball into an empty net. Benitez then had to act sharply to deny Di Maria getting his first goal of the campaign off an assist from Kylian Mbappe. The second half was only seven minutes old when a defensive blunder by Nice led to Cavani heading into the box with Alves getting a touch before the ball was helped on its way past Benitez by Nice captain Dante. Mbappe then showed why he will become the world's second most expensive player when his loan deal is completed at the end of the season, the teenager sprinting round a cluster of Nice defenders before firing into the side netting. As PSG reflected on a job well done Nice were left contemplating their fourth league loss on the bounce to keep them hovering above the relegation zone."
43,01/10/2017,23:16,Ocampos brace helps Marseille stun Nice,Ten-man Marseille moved up to third in Ligue 1 after Lucas Ocampos hit a brace in a thrilling come-from-behind 4-2 win at Mediterranean rivals Nice on Sunday.,"Players joined fans in a minute's applause in memory of the two victims of a knife attack in Marseille earlier on Sunday, after which the south coast rivals put on a sparkling show. In an entertaining first half, Marseille hit back from two goals down to head into the break leading 3-2. Mario Balotelli opened the scoring with a close-range header from a Pierre Lees-Melou corner after just four minutes while Jean Michael Serri doubled Nice's advantage with a heavily-deflected shot from outside the area. Ocampos bagged his first soon before the half hour mark, prodding in from close range after Nice's defence failed to deal with a cross. Allan Saint-Maximin blazed over when one-on-one with goalkeeper Steve Mandanda and Nice were made to pay. Five minutes from the break, a sliding Lees-Melou deflected a Florian Thauvin cross past his own goalkeeper. And in the final minute of the half, Nice imploded again as captain Dante gave away the ball and goalkeeper Yoann Cardinale parried Luiz Gustavo's shot weakly into the air for Ocampos to nod over the line. Two minutes into the second period, more sloppy play handed Gustavo a shooting opportunity the Brazilian gleefully accepted to find the bottom corner. Midway through the half, though, Gustavo was shown a straight red for following through studs up on Lees-Melou. There was still time for Mandanda to save an Alassane Plea penalty after Saint-Maximin was tripped in the box but Marseille held out. ""It's a great victory, we showed that we had character,"" said Ocampos. ""We wanted to show that the 6-1 loss to Monaco was an accident, that it wasn't fair."" Earlier, Marcelo was controversially sent off as Lyon's winless streak extended to five matches after letting a two-goal lead slip in a 3-3 draw at Angers. With Bruno Genesio's visitors leading 3-1 in the 50th minute, defender Marcelo was booked for a foul on the edge of the box. The Brazilian then accidentally knocked the yellow card out of the referee's hand with a dismissive gesture, earning a straight red card just seconds after his booking. Lyon president Jean-Michel Aulas said that he hoped Marcelo's suspension would be rescinded. ""I had the video, so I asked that the referee watch it,"" he said. ""It's not a question about trying to change this match, I was thinking about the next match against Monaco and I wanted him to see the images to show that Marcelo does not make a gesture against him, it's simply a gesture of frustration."" Lyon started quickly as former Real Madrid forward Mariano Diaz scored his sixth league goal of the season in the fifth minute. Rafael put through his own net to draw Angers level on the half-hour mark, but goals from Mouctar Diakhaby and former Manchester United winger Memphis Depay put the away side in control at the break. After Marcelo's bizarre dismissal, Angers roared back with goals from Karl Toko Ekambi and Ismael Traore. World-record signing Neymar scored twice, including from a penalty, as PSG moved three points clear of champions Monaco at the top by thrashing Bordeaux 6-2 on Saturday. Despite Radamel Falcao's 12th goal of the season, Monaco were held 1-1 by Montpellier on Friday."
44,18/09/2017,14:37,Balotelli screamer fires Nice past Rennes,A sizzling Mario Balotelli strike ten minutes from time gave Nice a 1-0 win at Rennes on Sunday as last season's Ligue 1 pace-setters appear to be overcoming a poor start this term.,"Balotelli hammered a supreme shot into the top corner for his fourth goal in three games since missing the start of the season as Lucien Favre's side continue their climb up the table into eighth place. ""It could easily have been a draw,"" said Favre, whose side beat Monaco 4-0 last week and who led Nice to third in Ligue 1 last season. ""Considering it's been three games in a week, this is more than satisfying,"" he said. For the Italian international it was an 18th league goal in 26 matches for Nice, who beat Zulte Waregem 5-1 away in the Europa League on Thursday where the giant former AC Milan and Manchester City striker with his mohican haircut scored twice. Earlier Sunday Marseille also pulled out of an early season slump when a Clinton Njie brace gave the ambitious southerners a 2-0 win at Amiens. Under new ownership with a bevvy of new signings Rudi Garcia's side were thrashed 6-1 at Monaco two weeks ago followed by an embarrassing 3-1 home defeat to Rennes. But a lucky break up at northern outfit Amiens helped get Marseille back on track for their dream of Champions League football when a deflected cross hit Njie in the midriff and bounced into the goal with the 'keeper wrong-footed. The 24-year-old former Spurs man then doubled the tally two minutes later after rounding 'keeper Regis Gurtner on 55 minutes. In a good sign of things to come Cameroon international Njie, winner of the 2017 Africa Cup of Nations, took his Ligue 1 tally to five. American businessman Frank McCourt, former owner of the LA Dodgers and Marseille's new owner, has promised he'll get them back into the Champions League for the first time sine 2013. The win lifted Marseille to fifth on 10 points from six games while table toppers Paris Saint-Germain have 15 points ahead of their late game with Lyon. On Saturday a revitalised Radamel Falcao grabbed a brace as second-placed champions Monaco beat Strasbourg 3-0. Saint-Etienne moved up to third as Jonathan Bamba's third goal of the season from the penalty spot saw them edge out lowly Dijon 1-0. Nantes continued their good form under Claudio Ranieri, as they beat Caen 1-0 to make it four games unbeaten without conceding a goal while Bordeaux stayed unbeaten with a 1-0 victory at Toulouse."

""After the match (against Napoli) I met with Barcelona's directors for more than an hour and they didn't tell me anything about not going through with signing me,"" said the Ivorian. ""I went home really happy; then the next day I read the news. I was stunned to see the move had broken down in an incomprehensible manner for me. ""I went to the Nice offices to see the board and find out what happened. I exploded! The walls shook. They didn't say anything to me, they didn't look me straight in the eye. ""It was clear what had happened. They had promised me one thing, but didn't keep their word and asked for more money."" Relations between Barca and PSG have been strained by Neymar's world record 222 million euro ($265 million) move to the French side, whilst Barca have sued the Brazilian star for breach of contract. Barca have already reinvested a large proportion of their windfall from Neymar's departure by making French winger Ousmane Dembele the second most expensive player ever in a 105 million euro move that could rise to 147 million depending on Dembele's performance. Seri remains hopeful he could yet be a Barcelona player before the transfer window closes this week, but insists he is also wanted by a host of other top European clubs if Barca's interest fades. ""I want to be optimistic and think that there is still a chance for the two clubs to get back around the table and reach an agreement,"" he added. ""We are not taking about any other club. ""Big European clubs like Juventus, PSG, Arsenal, Borussia Dortmund and Liverpool want to sign me."""
46,16/08/2017,23:48,Napoli punish nine-man Nice,"Napoli took a big step towards the Champions League group stage with a 2-0 win over outclassed nine-man Nice in their play-off, first-leg in Italy on Wednesday.","The Riviera side were down to nine men after 79 minutes when Alassane Pléa was sent off for a second yellow card just after Vincent Koziello's straight dismissal. Belgian midfielder Dries Mertens had slotted in the opener after 13 minutes with Jorginho doubling the hosts' account with a penalty after 70 minutes. It was a third straight defeat for Lucien Favre's side who have lost their first two French Ligue 1 matches, and travelled without Mario Balotelli and new signing Wesley Sneijder. Napoli, third in Serie A and in the Champions League last 16 last year, were a class above the French punishing defensive errors in front of a delighted 50,000 home fans at the San Paolo Stadium. ""At this stage of the season, we can say we played a great match,"" said Napoli coach Maurizio Sarri. ""We were playing against a team who were more advanced than us in physical preparations, so the risk was very high."" Napoli took control of the game early with Mertens outwitting the Nice defence and taking advantage of an error by Yoan Cardinale to slot past the advancing Nice goalkeeper. And in the 70th minute it was again Mertens, brought down by Christophe Jallet, who earned the penalty which Jorginho slotted in. Despite his initial error Cardinale made some key saves against Joe Callejon (15), Mertens (21) and two Lorenzo Insigne efforts after 42 and 67 minutes. The Italians also other missed chances to increase their advantage with Insigne hitting the woodwork after 51 minutes. Nice played the final ten minutes with nine men after first Koziello was shown a straight red card for a dangerous tackle on Piotr Zielinski. Plea was then dismissed for a second yellow card, allowing the Italians to wrap up a deserved victory ahead of their Serie A opener on Saturday. Maurizio Sarri's side are now ideally placed to join Juventus and AS Roma in the group stage as Nice have it all to do in the return home leg in the Allianz Riviera stadium on August 22. Spanish side Sevilla also set themselves up for a place in the group stage alongside Liga rivals Real Madrid, Barcelona and Atletico Madrid by beating Istanbul Basaksehir 2-1 in Turkey. Franco-Tunisian forward Wisam Ben Yedder, picked up a backheeled pass from Jesus Navas, to seal the winner six minutes from time. Sergio Escudero opened for Sevilla after 16 minutes with Eljero Elia getting the equaliser after 64 minutes. A Scott Sinclair double helped Celtic to a 5-0 thrashing of Astana in their play-off round first leg in Glasgow. An own-goal from Evgeni Postnikov opened the scoring in the 32nd minute before Sinclair doubled Celtic's advantage 10 minutes later. The English winger then grabbed his sixth goal of the season on the hour before James Forrest added another in the 79th minute. Leigh Griffiths rounded off the rout in the 79th minute with a deflection off Igor Shitov to help the Scottish champions secure a commanding advantage to take to Kazakhstan for the return leg next Tuesday. ""It was an outstanding team performance and the boys deserve a huge amount of credit. They managed the game very well,"" said Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers. Elsewhere Hapoel Beer-Sheva beat Maribor of Slovenia 2-1 at home in Israel while Olympiacos beat Croatian side Rijeka by the same score in Greece."
47,08/08/2017,19:31,Sneijder hoping Nice success will lead to World Cup,Veteran Wesley Sneijder is dreaming of playing in a fourth World Cup next summer and believes a good season with Nice can help him achieve that aim.,"The 33-year-old, the most capped player in the Netherlands' history with 131 national team appearances, was the latest marquee signing to join the Cote d'Azur outfit when he put pen to paper on Monday. He joins the likes of Mario Balotelli, Hatem Ben Arfa, Dante and Younes Belhanda as recent stand-out signings for the ambitious Ligue 1 outfit, who face a two-legged play-off with Napoli later this month to qualify for the Champions League group stages. And despite Nice losing their opening match of the Ligue 1 campaign 1-0 at Saint-Etienne on Saturday, Sneijder believes this can be another successful season for the Eaglets. ""Of course I'm thinking about playing the World Cup in Russia, that's obvious,"" he told journalists during his first press conference at the club on Tuesday. ""I want to play always on the high level. If I have the chance to go to a World Cup, I have to go for it. ""It's important to me, of course, but first we're going to make a great season with Nice and I really believe in that."" Nice finished third last season behind champions Monaco and big-spenders Paris Saint-Germain, who had taken Ben Arfa off them last summer. Belhanda's loan spell from Dynamo Kiev was up at the end of last season and he subsequently signed for Galatasaray, to replace Sneijder who was released on a free transfer. Now the Dutchman, a winner of league titles in four different countries, will fill the Moroccan international's boots on the south coast of France. ""I always make a decision to go for a new adventure and a new challenge,"" said Sneijder, who won the Champions League with Inter Milan in 2010. ""I always want to play for prizes -- I've won many prizes in my career so far, I'm never getting tired of winning prizes. That's why I'm here and I believe we can do something very good."" Sneijder won the Dutch title with Ajax, the Spanish La Liga with Real Madrid, Italy's Serie A with Inter and then most recently the Turkish top flight. ""I'm still a winner and I hate to lose, that's what I always have inside me: that's my character and I'll never change that,"" he said. He won't be making his Nice debut on Friday against Troyes, though, as his coach Lucien Favre believes he is not yet match fit. ""He'll need a few days, or even a few weeks to get back into his stride because he hasn't done much preparation,"" said the Swiss handler. ""He had two months of holidays where he trained alone, we can't put him in the team on Friday."""
48,07/08/2017,18:35,Sneijder completes Nice signing after medical,Wesley Sneijder completed his free transfer to Nice on Monday as the Ligue 1 club secured yet another star name.,"Following the signing of France international Hatem Ben Arfa two years ago and Italian bad boy Mario Balotelli last season, unfashionable Nice have done it again to secure the services of another marquee signing. ""Nice can count a third Champions League winner in our squad after Dante and Mario Balotelli,"" said the club. ""Having arrived on the Cote d'Azur on Sunday night, Wesley Sneijder is an Eaglet after passing Monday's medical exam."" Nice have made a habit of securing eye-catching acquisitions with Brazilian Dante, who won the Champions League with Bayern Munich in 2013, and Moroccan playmaker Younes Belhanda both joining last summer. Belhanda was on a year-long loan and returned to Dynamo Kiev at the end of last season before moving on to Galatasaray, to replace the departing Sneijder. The Dutchman, his country's all-time record caps holder with 131, won the Champions League alongside Balotelli under Jose Mourinho at Inter Milan in 2010. He is Nice's fifth summer recruit, although they have also seen a few players leave with more still coveted by richer clubs. The 33-year-old Snejider has won league titles in four different countries having started his career at Ajax and moved on to Real Madrid, before joining Inter and then Galatasaray. His signing is a huge boost for Nice, who finished third last year and face a two-legged play-off with Napoli later this month to earn qualification for the Champions League group stages."
49,06/08/2017,20:12,Sneijder agrees 'in principle' to join Nice,"Champions League winner Wesley Sneijder is on the brink of becoming the latest star name to sign for ambitious Ligue 1 outfit Nice after the two parties reached an ""agreement in principle"" on Sunday.","Unfashionable Nice have made a habit of signing top class talent over the last few seasons, with France international Hatem Ben Arfa, Italian striker Mario Balotelli, Brazilian centre-back Dante and Morocco playmaker Younes Belhanda all joining over the past two years. Now, 33-year-old Dutch international Sneijder, who won the Champions League with Inter Milan in 2010, is set to sign a one-year deal with an option for another year, according to a club source. On Sunday evening, Nice posted on Twitter to say they had reached an ""agreement in principle"" with the former Real Madrid and Ajax star. They also posted a photo of the player at their club offices and an emoji of two shaking hands. Sneijder, who arrived in Nice at 5pm, will undergo a medical on Monday and could put pen to paper later in the day. The attacking midfielder, who played in the 2010 World Cup final for the Netherlands and has won league titles in four countries, was released by Galatasaray at the end of last season, meaning he is available for free. Nice signed Ben Arfa from Newcastle United in 2015, with the talented playmaker helping them qualify for the Europa League before moving on to Paris Saint-Germain. Nice followed that up a year ago by bringing in Balotelli, who won the Champions League alongside Sneijder at Inter, Dante and Belhanda. The latter left to return to Dynamo Kiev, from where he'd been on loan, before signing for Galatasaray -- replacing Sneijder. Nice finished third in Ligue 1 last season and face a two-legged play-off against Napoli later this month to qualify for the Champions League group stages. On Saturday they lost their opening league match of the season 1-0 to Saint-Etienne."

Although Balotelli will be missing after suffering a hamstring injury in the 1-1 first leg draw in southern France, in which he scored Nice's goal, Dante is relieved the temperamental Italian has remained on the Cote d'Azur. ""Mario was free (to leave). The two parties made an effort, though. We're very happy with that,"" said Brazilian Dante. Favre had been courted by Borussia Dortmund in the close season but Nice, who finished third in the top flight last season, ruled out any exit for the Swiss coach in June, with the Bundesliga outfit appointing Peter Bosz instead. ""I never though the coach would leave before the end of his contract,"" said Dante. ""He behaves in the right way and is respectful of his commitments, and he never told me about a desire to leave.

In Glasgow, Celtic struggled to break down Norwegian opponents Rosenberg without the injured Moussa Dembele and Lee Griffiths, who was banned for one match by UEFA for ""provoking spectators"" in the previous round against Linfield. Celtic goalkeeper Craig Gordon produced a series of excellent stops to deny former Arsenal striker Nicklas Bendtner, Anders Konradsen Matthias Vilhjalmsson, with the hosts fortunate to escape without serious damage. ""Nil-nil is never a bad result in Europe. If you can't score it is important we don't concede,"" said Celtic coach Brendan Rodgers. ""I was pleased with the players.

A source close to the negotations on Thursday had suggested Balotelli could extend his stay in Nice by two years with a monthly salary of 450,000 euros ($502,000). Balotelli, who played in Italy for AC Milan and Inter Milan and England with Liverpool and Manchester City, joined Nice last August and scored 17 goals in 28 appearances as the club came third -- their best finish in 41 years. Balotelli's move to Nice was seen by many as a last roll of the dice for a player who endured two miserable seasons in 2014-15 and 2015-16 before landing at the Allianz Riviera on a free transfer. The Italian helped fire Nice into the qualifying rounds for next season's Champions League -- after Lucien Favre's side finished behind Monaco and Paris Saint-Germain -- but Balotelli was also sent off three times. He was also the target of racist abuse from Bastia fans and found himself dropped over his attitude -- an issue Italy coach Gian Piero Ventura said Balotelli must address if he is to fight his way back into contention for the 2018 World Cup. Nice president Jean-Pierre Rivere had said earlier in the week that Balotelli was very keen to remain with the club after resurrecting his faltering career last season. ""I can tell you three things - one, he's a player who wants to continue with us; two, he's ready to make a financial effort; three, discussions are continuing,"" said Rivere on Thursday."

""It's a complicated dossier,"" said a source close to the discussions, adding that the player could extend by two years with a monthly salary of 450,000 euros ($502,000). Balotelli -- who played in Italy for AC Milan and Inter Milan and England with Liverpool and Manchester City -- joined Nice in 2016, with his 15 goals helping lift the team to third in Ligue 1 and a Champions League spot next season. The 26-year-old could opt to stay in France and try to resurrect his international career with Italy for the 2018 World Cup finals in Russia. Balotelli has scored 13 times in 33 international appearances, but hasn't played for Italy since featuring in a 1-0 defeat to Uruguay that saw the Azzurri eliminated during the group stages of the 2014 World Cup in Brazil."

""It is equally legitimate that this opportunity could arouse the interest of Lucien Favre. ""Nice have no difficulty in understanding that.

But Balotelli critics at some of his previous clubs such as Liverpool or AC Milan may raise an eyebrow at his other comments. ""When something goes wrong he lets his head drop, he starts grumbling and can be difficult to talk to,"" Eysseric said. Eysseric was talking within the context of having started Nice's last game, a 1-0 win at Saint Etienne, after the Italian began on the bench following a strop at the end of Nice's 4-0 defeat by Monaco in their previous game. ""He was angry and upset after the (Monaco) game ""Maybe right now with my level of commitment to the team, the boss (coach Lucien Favre) thinks I'm doing more than Mario,"" he said. ""It's a great pity he has this tendency to let his head drop."" Balotelli has been highly influential in Favre's first season at Nice, who are level on points with second placed PSG in Ligue 1 just three points behind leaders Monaco.

66,20/12/2016,01:47,Balotelli stirs Nice hopes of fairytale finish,Nice fans are dreaming of seeing their Mario Balotelli-fuelled underdogs do a Leicester and steal the French title from the likes of crisis-stricken Paris Saint-Germain.,"Balotelli's double in a 2-1 victory over Dijon on Sunday ensured Nice will go into the winter break on top of Ligue 1, and victory over Bordeaux on Wednesday would only add to the embarrassment of their well-heeled rivals. Balotelli, so often the misfit in England and his native Italy, has now scored eight goals in eight games in an injury shortened half-season. The Cote d'Azur side have also benefited from the sensational form of Alasane Plea, 23, who has hit 10 goals. Dante, the former Bayern Munich stalwart, has been a rock in defence. Nice have lost only once in 18 games and are four points ahead of Monaco and seven in front of PSG. So is the championship possible? ""Without injuries, without European competition, without the League Cup, why not?"" said former Olympique Marseille and Bordeaux coach Rolland Courbis. Despite their hot Ligue 1 form, Nice have crashed out of the Europa League and France's League Cup. Monaco and PSG are both still going for the Champions League as well as all domestic trophies. ""Nice remind me of what we saw with Leicester last year,"" said Toulouse coach Pascal Dupraz. ""They are dynamic, fresh, they have good technique and well-marshalled players. You can see that Nice have gone up a gear,"" he added after his side were beaten by the surprise leaders earlier this month. Leicester City were helped by weaknesses exposed in the Premier League's big-spending giants, and Nice have also taken advantage of PSG's disastrous start to the season. Their four defeats so far, the latest at Guingamp on Sunday, have left PSG coach Unai Emery worrying about his job. Nice coach Lucien Favre is following the example of Leicester counterpart Claudio Ranieri and refusing to discuss winning the title. ""We have 43 points, we are safe (from relegation),"" he joked after the Dijon win. Favre can see the practical and tactical minefield ahead -- Balotelli played as a solo centre forward against Dijon, forcing Plea out onto the wing, a position he does not like. ""The truth is it's difficult,"" said Favre. ""Mario scored braces against Marseille, Monaco and now Dijon as a lone centre forward. Alassane scored nine of his 10 goals when Mario was absent. That's it!"" he added with a smile. Courbis sees other problems looming for Nice. Key midfielders Younes Belhanda and Jean-Michel Seri will be playing at the Africa Cup of Nations in January for Morocco and Ivory Coast respectively. Courbis said that Balotelli has to put in more regular performances ""which he has not been doing so far."" The injury list, which includes Valentin Eysseric and Brazilian left-back Dalbert, is also growing. Even the 33-year-old Dante is scheduled to have tests on his knee. Favre did throw aside his normal caution on Sunday to condemn the fixture pile-up which will have seen Nice play 10 matches in 31 days up to the start of the break on Thursday. ""I don't know who organised it, but its too much. It's unmanageable,"" Favre said. The players are still enjoying the heights however. ""The aim is to go as high as possible, not set ourselves any limit,"" said goalkeeper Yoan Cardinale. ""There is still a lot to do. Autumn champions does not go on the list of trophies won."" Courbis said it would be ""exceptional"" for Nice to finish the season in the top three, having ended fourth last year. Other cautious observers recall how Nice were top of the table in December in the 1972-73 and 1975-76 seasons. Each time they finished second."
67,09/12/2016,02:15,Pressure on Emery as PSG meet Nice in summit clash,Unai Emery is once again a coach under pressure as his Paris Saint-Germain side prepare to face Nice on Sunday looking to close the gap on the surprise Ligue 1 leaders.,"A 12-game unbeaten run had appeared the perfect response to early-season criticism of Emery at PSG, but in the last week the Spaniard has seen his side humbled 3-0 by Montpellier and then left to scramble a 2-2 draw with Ludogorets in the Champions League. After two such worrying performances, it is debatable whether Emery could even survive a defeat at home to Nice, which would leave the defending champions seven points adrift of the southern upstarts with the season's halfway stage approaching. ""It is a difficult spell, but we will show a reaction on Sunday in what is a huge match for us,"" insisted midfielder Blaise Matuidi, just about the only PSG player deserving of pass marks against Ludogorets. PSG needed a late Angel di Maria equaliser to avoid defeat at home to the Bulgarians after a lacklustre display but the result meant they finished second in Champions League Group A to Arsenal. ""This disappointment must give us the desire to lift our hands and show a different face in the last 16. We must improve, and that starts on Sunday against Nice,"" said Emery in his still stumbling French. PSG have Adrien Rabiot and Javier Pastore on the sidelines while Di Maria is in wretched form, so they may look to Hatem Ben Arfa for creative inspiration against the club for whom he starred last season. Without him, the side from the Cote d'Azur -- with a reported budget less than a tenth of PSG's -- have gone from strength to strength this season under Lucien Favre and they have topped the table since mid-September. They have only lost once in the league all season and impressed in beating Toulouse 3-0 last weekend to hold a three-point lead over Monaco and a four-point advantage over the capital giants. Mario Balotelli is in line to feature after making his comeback from a month on the sidelines with a calf injury in Thursday's Europa League meeting with Russian outfit Krasnodar. Monaco travel to Bordeaux on Saturday knowing a win would take them provisionally top of the table, above Nice on goal difference. Leonardo Jardim's prolific side are still running at an average of more than three goals per game and were able to rest key players for Wednesday's Champions League defeat to Bayer Leverkusen in Germany having already qualified for the last 16 as group winners. They are targeting the symbolic title of topping the table at the year's end and striker Valere Germain said: ""It would be nice to be autumn champions and we will give everything in the final matches of the year to do that."" Lyon will aim to bounce back from the disappointment of being eliminated from the Champions League after failing to get the better of Sevilla as they host Rennes. Rennes are fourth but have struggled away from home this season and Lyon can leapfrog them with a win. Bruno Genesio's men also have a game in hand after their match at Metz last weekend was abandoned when firecrackers were thrown at OL goalkeeper Anthony Lopes, leaving him with ""acoustic trauma"" but no lasting damage. Nantes, who are in the relegation zone, will have new coach Sergio Conceicao watching from the stands when they host Caen on Saturday. Conceicao, the 42-year-old former Portugal winger, was in charge of Vitoria Guimaraes last season. Fixtures (kick-offs 1900 GMT unless stated)"
68,27/11/2016,19:25,Nice held as rivals turn up pressure,Nice reclaimed top spot in Ligue 1 on Sunday but had their momentum slowed in a 1-1 draw at home to bitter rivals Bastia at the Allianz Riviera.,"Alassane Plea had put the home side in front only for Enzo Crivelli to earn the Corsicans a draw and leave Nice with only one win in their last five games in all competitions. Lucien Favre's side are back on top of the table after seeing Cote d'Azur neighbours Monaco leapfrog them on Saturday by beating Marseille 4-0, but their lead at the summit has been trimmed to a single point over the course of the weekend. Defending champions Paris Saint-Germain can join Monaco and also move to within one point of Nice with a win when they visit Lyon later on Sunday. Those two are in superb form -- Monaco have won their last five matches and are unbeaten in eight, while PSG have gone 10 games without defeat. In contrast, Nice have shown some signs that the pace is beginning to catch up with them recently and this game came less than 72 hours after a defeat away to Schalke in Germany eliminated them from the Europa League. ""We didn't get the breaks that have helped us before when we have not played so well,"" admitted Favre. ""We scored quite early on and then, maybe subconsciously, we started to relax. ""All our matches against teams towards the bottom of the table have been difficult."" Favre made five changes to his team from the Schalke game but he was still without Mario Balotelli with the Italy striker sidelined by a calf injury. Plea is their leading scorer and he headed in his eighth of the season to give Les Aiglons the breakthrough with just 11 minutes on the clock. However, struggling Bastia -- who had not won any of their previous six league outings -- equalised on the hour as Crivelli followed up to score after goalkeeper Yoan Cardinale had come out and saved from Yannick Cahuzac. Nice still could have taken all three points but Malang Sarr headed against the post from a Jean Michael Seri free-kick and Plea rounded goalkeeper Jean-Louis Leca only to hit the bar with his shot three minutes from the end. Saint-Etienne won 2-1 at Angers earlier in the day to go eighth. On Saturday, Monaco secured their record margin of victory against Marseille thanks to a brace by Valere Germain in between a brilliant Gabriel Boschilia free-kick and a Guido Carrillo effort at the death."
69,22/11/2016,19:11,Balotelli to miss Nice's Schalke clash,"Nice go into their crunch Europa League clash with Schalke 04 without star striker Mario Balotelli after the Italian pulled a calf muscle in training, the French club said on Tuesday.",Nice are bottom of Group I on three points while Schalke have already qualified for the next round on 12 points. The Ligue 1 leaders can still finish second but will likely need two wins to do so. Their chances will be somewhat diminished given that Liverpool misfit Balotelli has scored seven goals in nine games this season.
70,06/11/2016,13:28,Balotelli says Nice can win French title,"Seeking to bounce back from tough times at Liverpool and AC Milan, maverick Mario Balotelli says his adopted club Nice can lift the French title.","Nice are unbeaten in 11 games and top the table ahead of Monaco. They are six points clear of big spenders Paris Saint Germain helped by a Balotelli purple patch of seven goals in eight games. Balotelli was asked whether Nice could hold on to their lead to grab the title from PSG and France's other established names. ""It's possible but it will be difficult. We've only played 11 games. But I'm here to win something so I think it's possible,"" the Italy international striker said in an interview with TF1's Telefoot programme broadcast Sunday. The 26-year-old had a poor stint across two seasons with Liverpool and an equally disapointing second spell with AC Milan before winding up at Nice. But the seemingly backwater move has paid dividends and the Cote d'Azur side -- who won four championships in the 1950s -- have taken to him as he has to them. Nice were ""a good side, even without Mario,"" joked Balotelli. ""I am happy, We are top of the league. But that isn't enough for me."" His exploits have not been enough to earn an Italy recall from coach Giampiero Ventura, who left him off the squad for a World Cup qualifier this month against Liechtenstein and a friendly against Germany, who he majestically knocked out of Euro 2012. Since a poor 2014 World Cup Balotelli has not featured for the Squadra Azzurra. Balotelli said he found the French league a tougher competition than he had imagined. ""When I arrived I thought it would be a lot easier."" Nice were looking to add to their strong start later Sunday with a win over Caen."
71,25/10/2016,22:23,"Nice raise 120,000 euros for truck attack victims","French Ligue 1 leaders Nice have raised more than 120,000 euros ($130,000) at auction for the victims of July's Bastille Day truck massacre in the city.","Collectors' team jerseys were sold to raise money for the ""Promenade des Anges"" group, an association of victims and families of victims of the attack on July 14 on the Promenade des Anglais that killed 86 people. In the attack, a 31-year-old Tunisian extremist rammed a 19-tonne truck through a crowd of more than 30,000 Bastille Day revellers on the seafront promenade before police shot him dead. Star Nice forward Mario Balotelli's jersey fetched 11,100 euros on Tuesday. Former Nice player Hatem Ben Arfa, now with Paris Saint-Germain, was amongst the buyers alongside the club's Ligue 1 rivals Montpellier and the French Football League."
72,22/10/2016,17:07,Football: Balotelli again sidelined for Nice,"Mario Balotelli will again be missing for Nice when the French Ligue 1 leaders travel to Metz on Sunday, coach Lucien Favre indicated.","The Italian has been a revelation since joining Nice, scoring five goals in four league appearances and also netting once in the Europa League. However, he missed Thursday's 1-0 win away to Salzburg in Europe with an adductor problem that has not yet cleared up. ""We will see at the start of the week if he can return to training,"" Favre said of the former Liverpool and AC Milan striker. Nice will also be weakened by the absences of centre-back and captain Paul Baysse and Brazilian full-back Dalbert as they seek to extend their unbeaten start to the French campaign. The latter will be out for a month with a knee ligament injury suffered against Salzburg."
73,06/10/2016,21:59,Football: Balotelli has red card overturned,Mario Balotelli will be able to play in Nice's next game after a red card he picked up last weekend was overturned on Thursday.,"The Italian striker was sent off in stoppage time in Nice's 2-1 win over Lorient on Sunday that kept his new club on top of Ligue 1 and unbeaten after eight games. But the second yellow card that led to his sending-off, shown for an apparent altercation with the Lorient defender Steven Moreira, was wiped out after the match referee admitted his error. Balotelli will therefore be able to play when Nice entertain Lyon on Friday, October 14, providing a massive boost to Lucien Favre's side. The former Liverpool player had netted a brilliant late winner against Lorient shortly before being dismissed, taking him to six goals from five appearances since moving to the Cote d'Azur at the end of August."
74,03/10/2016,21:43,No love lost for Klopp as Super Mario targets Italy recall,Mario Balotelli said he plans an explosive return to the Italy national team in an interview in which he also hit out at former clubs Liverpool and AC Milan.,"Balotelli has not played for Italy since defeat to Uruguay in the final group match of the 2014 World Cup in Brazil sent the Azzurri crashing out of the tournament at the first hurdle. But he has enjoyed a lightning start with French Ligue 1 side Nice, scoring five goals in his first three league appearances to help them to the top of the table, above more-fancied Monaco and Paris Saint-Germain. The 26-year-old was not selected for Italy's upcoming 2018 World Cup qualifiers at home to Spain and away in Macedonia, but on current form a return to Giampiero Ventura's squad cannot be far away. ""It was right not to select me because I didn't deserve it,"" Balotelli told Sky Sport Italia. ""It's better for Ventura to not select me this time around because when I return, I want to be at my best."" Known as one of the more controversial footballers of the past decade, Ballotelli appears to have turned over a new leaf. After a torrid end to a controversial three-year spell at Manchester City, Balotelli joined AC Milan in January 2013 before moving to Liverpool in 2014. Balotelli never settled at Anfield and returned to Milan on loan last season, only to struggle with a troubelsome groin injury. And when Balotelli returned to Liverpool in the summer, manager Jurgen Klopp shot down his chances of regular football and advised him to move on. Balotelli said: ""Klopp doesn't know me, I spoke to him once, he told me to go somewhere else, work hard and then return. So I said goodbye to them, and that we wouldn't be seeing each other again."" Balotelli claimed both Milan and Liverpool, ""weren't adapted to me"". ""It wasn't anyone's fault. They weren't ideal environments for me,"" he added. ""I didn't make mistakes in terms of my game or my behaviour, but I did get injured and that's not something I can control."" Balotelli said the climate at seven-time European champions Milan, who have struggled to qualify for Europe in recent seasons, was ""confusing"". ""The problem there is the administration,"" added Balotelli. ""There's only one person who is phenomenal, and that's (club CEO, Adriano) Galliani. All the rest is just... confusion."" Balotelli has six goals in five games in all competitions for Nice, where he has enjoyed a perfect start save for a red card right at the end of Sunday's 2-1 home win over Lorient, shortly after scoring a superb late winner. He puts his current form down to feeling settled with his new team-mates, and in his new surroundings on France's Mediterranean coast. ""At the start, I chose Nice for the climate, I wanted to be in a relaxing but beautiful place, where it's difficult to get out the wrong side of the bed,"" he said. ""The other reason I chose Nice is because there's a decent group of young players. We're all about the same age."""
75,02/10/2016,19:11,Balotelli beauty leaves Nice top,A superb Mario Balotelli strike four minutes from time gave Nice a 2-1 win over Lorient on Sunday that left them top of the Ligue 1 table going into the international break.,"Ricardo Pereira put Nice in front on the Cote d'Azur but Benjamin Moukandjo equalised in the second half and it looked as if Lucien Favre's side would have to settle for a draw until Balotelli bent in a brilliant late winner. Beaten 5-2 in Russia by Krasnodar in the Europa League on Thursday, this result got Nice back on track and maintained their impressive unbeaten record domestically so far. After eight games, they sit a point clear of local rivals Monaco, who beat Metz 7-0 away on Saturday to record their biggest ever away win in France's top flight. Defending champions Paris Saint-Germain are third, four points adrift of the leaders, following a 2-0 defeat of Bordeaux on Saturday in which Edinson Cavani scored twice to take his tally for the season to eight league goals. At the Allianz Riviera, Nice went in front with just 11 minutes on the clock as Portuguese full-back Pereira cut in from the right and sent in a shot that surprised Benjamin Lecomte in the Lorient goal. But the Brittany side had beaten Lyon in their last outing and they caused problems for a Nice side showing only two changes from the starting line-up that took to the field in Russia barely 72 hours previously. Jimmy Cabot came close on a couple of occasions in the first half and Arnold Mvuemba had a free-kick deflected just wide two minutes into the second half. The equaliser duly arrived shortly after the hour mark when Cameroon international Moukandjo finished nicely from a Mohamed Mara pass. Malang Sarr then deflected a Mara shot onto his own bar as Nice found themselves hanging on, but then a moment of magic from their Italian striker decided the game in the home side's favour. Wylan Cyprien flicked the ball into the path of Balotelli inside the area, and he took a touch before curling a powerful shot into the top-right corner of the net for his sixth goal in a Nice shirt in just five appearances. Nice are next in action at home to Lyon on Friday, October 14. Earlier on Sunday, Pierrick Capelle's stoppage-time equaliser gave Angers a 1-1 draw at home to struggling Marseille, who had taken the lead via Florian Thauvin's deflected effort. Lyon host bitter rivals Saint-Etienne in Sunday's late game."
76,27/09/2016,16:10,Toilet humour as Balotelli presented with bidet,Controversial Italian star Mario Balotelli was presented with an unexpected gift following training with his club Nice on Tuesday.,"Presenters from a satirical Italian television show turned up on the Cote d'Azur to offer Balotelli a bidet. In Italy there is a running joke about French hygiene due to the fact few people own a bidet, while almost every bathroom across the Alps is equipped with one. Balotelli, whose reputation is anything but squeaky clean, took the joke in his stride, laughing as he accepted the gift before leaving it on the ground. The ""Le iene"" (the hyenas) presenters thanked Balotelli before taking the bidet away with them. Balotelli has had a storming start to life with Nice, scoring a brace in each of his first two league appearances for the Ligue 1 pace-setters following a free transfer from Liverpool. In the past he has been in trouble for a number of off-field antics, such as throwing darts at junior players at Manchester City, where he also set fire to his bathroom after setting off fireworks from inside his house."
77,12/09/2016,16:20,Verratti tells Balotelli to get serious,Paris Saint Germain's Italian midfielder Marco Verratti has challenged troubled Ligue 1 new boy Mario Balotelli to concentrate on his football all week long and not just on matchdays.,"The former AC Milan, Manchester City and Liverpool striker scored twice on his debut for French outfit Nice on Sunday, where he is trying to resurrect his floundering career. And the gloves were off when Italy international Verratti was asked what he thought of his compatriot. ""I just hope he realises that football is not just 90 minutes, but an all week long thing,"" Verratti said at the PSG training ground. ""He's a good player who has always had a problem with his mentality. But I do know he's a good guy."" The midfield enforcer was on the same side as Balotelli at the 2014 World Cup, where the striker had been tipped to peak but was instead one of the major disappointments of the tournament. The 26-year-old signed a one-year deal at the Allianz Riviera after being allowed to leave Anfield on a free transfer. He struck twice on his debut to help Nice beat Mediterranean rivals Marseille 3-2 in Ligue 1 on Sunday."

The forward struggled on loan at former club AC Milan last season having made little impact at Liverpool in the previous campaign, but Raiola was critical of the way Klopp handled Balotelli's departure. ""For me, he didn't take into account that he was talking to a human being,"" Raiola said, in quotes published Saturday on the Gazzetta dello Sport website. ""Mario has been exemplary, he never complained about training alone. To say that it was wrong of Klopp would be an understatement, he was a piece of shit about it."" The outspoken Raiola, who is also the agent of Manchester United midfielder Paul Pogba, supported Balotelli's earlier assertion that Nice had not taken a risk in signing the striker. ""It's a gamble that'd I'd try for sure,"" he said, predicting that Balotelli would score 20 goals in Ligue 1 this season should he remain fit."

""To me I don't represent a risk. I have had fitness problems, but a risk? No!"" The 26-year-old signed a one-year deal at the Allianz Riviera after being allowed to leave Anfield on a free transfer, but Nice are reported to be paying their new recruit an annual salary of 4.5 million euros (3.8 million pounds, $5 million). ""We know the risk we are taking, but it's one I take with pleasure,"" said Nice president Jean-Pierre Rivere, whose club helped successfully relaunch the career of France forward Hatem Ben Arfa last season. Ben Arfa returned to his home country after a difficult time in England and ended last season by being nominated for France's player of the year award. He was recalled to the national set-up and joined champions Paris Saint-Germain over the summer. Balotelli struggled on loan at former club AC Milan last season having made little impact at Liverpool in the previous campaign. During his Manchester City days he became better known for his off-field antics, and one journalist asked Balotelli if Nice supporters should be worried about the number of nightclubs on the Cote d'Azur given the Italian's reputation as something of a party boy. ""I prefer not to hear that question,"" replied the player, who insisted his decision to join Nice was ""purely sporting"". ""My priority was to play. I spoke to the coach (Lucien Favre) and he really wanted me. I hope that this year will be very good. That's all!"" Balotelli could make his Nice debut in the Mediterranean derby at home to Marseille on Sunday, September 11. ""He has enormous qualities. I have seen clips of his best moments and it was impressive, but this is a long-term job,"" said Swiss coach Favre. ""Everything will depend on how willing he is. His fitness is the basis. Otherwise, I have no doubts about his technical ability."""
81,31/08/2016,22:04,Misfit Balotelli joins France's Nice,"Controversial Italian international forward Mario Balotelli has joined Ligue 1's Nice from Liverpool, the French side said on their website on Wednesday.","The 26-year-old known as 'Super Mario', whose career has stalled over the last two years, has signed a permanent deal, Nice said, without revealing the fee or the length of the contract. ""Mario Balotelli will train with us on Thursday and be officially presented to the press on Friday,"" said Nice, who came fourth in Ligue 1 last season. British media reported he had moved on a free transfer, with Liverpool avoiding having to pay off his hefty contract, as had been feared after a raft of European clubs refused to take him. ""We know, he and the club, that it will not be simple, but with desire and support from the fans, he cam blossom here and bring all his talent to the service of the team,"" Nice president Jean-Pierre Rivere said. ""We hope that in the family atmosphere at this club, he will start to enjoy his game again."" Nice have a recent track record of bringing wayward talent back to the boil after a similar experience last season with France international Hatem Ben Arfa, who moved to Paris Saint-Germain in the close season. Liverpool bought Balotelli from AC Milan for 25 million euros ($27.9 million) in 2014, but a year later loaned him back to the Italian giants, where he managed a paltry one goal in 20 matches. Once considered a potential great, Balotelli scored a brilliant brace for Italy in their Euro 2012 semi-final win over Germany. He also shone at the 2013 Confederations Cup, but since leaving Manchester City that year his career has been in gradual decline. Balotelli was shipped back to Milan on loan after just one campaign at Liverpool, but his miserable spell at Anfield is finally over. Liverpool also allowed Serbian winger Lazar Markovic to join Sporting Lisbon on a season-long loan."
82,31/08/2016,09:44,Report: Ballotelli to have medical at Nice,"Liverpool's outcast Italian striker Mario Balotelli was to have a medical at French side Nice on Wednesday amid transfer deadline day talks between the clubs, l'Equipe newspaper reported.","The 26-year-old could be sold or loaned to Nice, the report said. Once one of the biggest hopes in Europe, Balotelli has not played for Italy since the 2014 World Cup and has been told he is not wanted by Liverpool coach Juergen Klopp. A Nice official told l'Equipe no agreement had been reached and that the medical was ""to save time"" if an accord could be found. ""If the situation works out, maybe late in the day, it will be done. If we don't agree with Liverpool, he will leave again,"" the official added. Nice want a permanent transfer but a loan was also possible, the club official was quoted as saying. Balotelli spent last season on loan at AC Milan but the Italian side chose not to extend the deal."

Dante won the Champions League with Bayern Munich in 2013 and was part of three Bundesliga title-winning sides during his time in Bavaria. He also helped Wolfsburg make a surprise run to the quarter-finals of Europe's premier club competition last season and has been capped 13 times at international level.

Dundee manager Paul Hartley said he had been impressed with the Frenchman on a week's loan period. ""He's got good quality, he has been playing at the highest level in France. He can pass the ball, he has good qualities about him. He's strong and quick so hopefully he'll do well for us,"" he said.

""I'm now very happy to join Southampton. You only have to look at the facilities and their results over the last few seasons to know that this is a very good Premier League club,"" Pied said. ""I'm very proud. The English league is a very attractive one and it was a goal of mine to be able to play in it.""

Mendy, who played 110 Ligue 1 games for Nice, worked under Leicester manager Claudio Ranieri during a spell with Monaco, and becomes the club's third signing of the summer after Germany goalkeeper Ron-Robert Zieler and Spanish defender Luis Hernandez. ""I know the coach, I know his mentality and I know his philosophy. When he speaks it's direct and clear and for me I like this,"" he added. If the transfer fee is confirmed it would be the biggest in the history of Nice after striker Loïc Rémy in 2010 to Marseille for 15 million euro."
87,24/05/2016,18:02,Favre takes over at Nice after Puel resigns,Switzerland's Lucien Favre was named coach of Ligue 1 outfit Nice on Tuesday after the resignation of the highly-respected Claude Puel.,"Favre, 58, has been out of work since being sacked by Bundesliga club Borussia Moenchengladbach in September, but was set to sign a three-year contract with Nice, according to sources. The former Swiss international midfielder, known for encouraging attacking football, led Moenchengladbach into the Champions League but paid the price for a dreadful start of the season. The outgoing Puel, 54, had previously coached Lyon and famously took Monaco to the 2004 Champions League final, while this season he gave a free role to France forward Hatem Ben Arfa as the side finished fourth in France. ""We came to a common decision not to continue our adventure,"" a statement said on Nice's website on the end of a four-year collaboration with Puel. The move could well be taken badly by the club's fans, who are also set to lose their star player Ben Arfa in June after their highest league finish for 30 years. As well as his run to the Champions League and French League victory at Monaco, Puel also led Lyon to the Champions League semi-final in 2010, and guided Lille to a 2004 Intertoto Cup and a French league runners up spot in 2005."

89,13/05/2016,19:09,Lyon bid for old boy Ben Arfa,Lyon president Jean-Michel Aulas said on Friday he had made a bid to Nice to resign forward Hatem Ben Arfa.,"After a brilliant season with Nice, Ben Arfa was reported a week ago to be on the verge of a move to Barcelona. But Aulas has always had a nose for a deal and his former charge will be out of contract at the end of the season. ""He's one of our priorities. He wants to come back, he's open to that,"" Aulas said in an interview on French cable tv channel BeIN Sports. The 29-year-old winger has relaunched his career at Nice, with 17 league goals this season, but was disappointed on Thursday to be left out of the France squad for Euro-2016, only making the reserve list. The former Newcastle and Marseille player made his debut for Lyon at just 17-years-old back in 2004 and went on to play 91 times for the club, while winning four straight Ligue 1 titles. Last Friday, Nice president Jean-Pierre Rivere told television station France 3, confirming reports in sports daily L'Equipe, that said a move to Barcelona was ""very probable"". ""I would be very, very happy for Hatem, who deserves to go to a club like Barca,"" Rivere said. ""But it is not done yet from what Hatem has said. They are in talks, as are other clubs."" Playmaker Ben Arfa has been unstoppable with the ball at his feet this season, leading Nice to the brink of Champions League qualification in scintillating style after coach Claude Puel built a side around his mercurial talents."

""Quite honestly, if (a transfer) were to happen, I would be very, very happy for Hatem who deserves to go to a club like Barca. ""But it is not done yet from what Hatem has said. They are in talks as are other clubs."" The 29-year-old will be out of contract at the end of the season and has successfully relaunched his career at Nice, his 17 league goals having the Cote d'Azur club on course to qualify for Europe. Ben Arfa, who also won a recall to the France squad earlier this season, is likely to make his final home appearance as a Nice player in Saturday's game against Saint-Etienne. The former Lyon and Marseille player's renaissance this season has come after he spent the first six months of 2015 without a club having had a loan spell at English Premier League side Hull City cut short before being released by Newcastle United. He is on a four-man shortlist for France's player of the year award alongside Paris Saint-Germain duo Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Angel Di Maria and Marseille midfielder Lassana Diarra."
91,29/04/2016,02:20,Quartet scrapping for Champions League berths in France,"While Paris Saint-Germain have long since had the Ligue 1 title wrapped up, the battle for Champions League qualification beneath them is only intensifying in the final weeks of the French season.","Just two points separate Lyon in second from Saint-Etienne in fifth with three matches remaining, including a crucial set of fixtures this Saturday. Lyon sit second ahead of Monaco on goal difference, with Nice and Saint-Etienne both two points back. Only second carries with it automatic qualification for next season's Champions League group stage, with the team in third facing entry in the third qualifying round in late July. Monaco are desperate to avoid that fate after losing to Valencia in the Champions League play-offs at the start of this season, but their form has dipped rather alarmingly of late. Leonardo Jardim's side have won only two of their last eight matches, allowing Lyon to catch them up thanks to six wins and two draws over the same period. The two teams meet each other in a huge game on the penultimate weekend of the season, but first Monaco entertain Guingamp at the Stade Louis II on Saturday just before Lyon entertain relegation-threatened Gazelec Ajaccio. ""It is a decisive match, a bit like a semi-final. There will be something to play for at Lyon only if we win against Guingamp,"" said Monaco coach Jardim, whose side drew 1-1 at Rennes last weekend. ""The fact OL are favourites now changes nothing. There are four of us fighting for second place and all the teams will give everything to get it. ""The draw against Rennes doesn't change much. We are still obliged to win our next three matches. If we do that we will finish second."" Lyon, whose leading scorer Alexandre Lacazette has this week been linked with a move to Barcelona, will look to defend their unbeaten record at their new Parc OL when they host Gazelec. ""It is a very important match and we are really concentrated on it. We are not thinking about the match against Monaco,"" said midfielder Corentin Tolisso. ""Everything depends on a victory on Saturday. We need to be in front of them before playing Monaco."" With Hatem Ben Arfa in the form of his life, Nice have lost just once -- to PSG -- in their last seven games and go to Nantes looking to keep alive their hopes of a first podium finish since 1976. Ben Arfa, who has scored 17 Ligue 1 goals this season, has been nominated for the player of the year award in France along with PSG duo Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Angel Di Maria and Marseille midfielder Lassana Diarra. Nice need points before hosting Saint-Etienne next weekend, before which Les Verts entertain Toulouse on Saturday. Christophe Galtier's side are bidding to secure a fourth consecutive top-five finish and are on a run of five successive wins, all without conceding a goal. PSG's win against Lille last weekend ensured fifth place would bring with it a Europa League berth, while sixth will also offer European qualification if PSG beat Marseille in the French Cup final next month. Lille, who visit Lorient on Saturday, are currently sixth, one point ahead of Rennes, who go to Paris on Friday. Champions PSG can equal their own record for the most points in a Ligue 1 season with a win against Rennes after a week in which several stars used their days off to take a mini break in Las Vegas. ""My players do what they want. They had three days off, I gave them to them, and I think that's a good thing,"" coach Laurent Blanc said in response to media criticism after Ibrahimovic and Javier Pastore were among those who visited Vegas."
92,27/04/2016,14:01,"Ben Arfa, Di Maria and Diarra in Ibrahimovic slipstream",Nice forward Hatem Ben Arfa and Marseille midfield dynamo Lassana Diarra are on a shortlist of four alongside Parisian big guns Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Angel di Maria for the French player of the year award.,"The award is announced May 8 and is voted upon by the quartet's fellow Ligue 1 players. After a serious slump in the first half of the season last year's winner Lyon striker Alexandre Lacazette failed to make the cut despite his 12 goals since January. Winner in 2013 and 2014 Zlatan Ibrahimovic is Ligue 1's top scorer with 32 goals and is top passer with 13 assists and looks to be hot favourite to pick up a third award in the final season of his PSG contract. Angel di Maria has also run defences ragged but cannot boast the same statistics or wield the same authority as his Swedish teammate. Playmaker Ben Arfa has been unstoppable with the ball at his feet and has led Nice to the brink of Champions League qualification in scintillating style and scored 17 Ligue 1 goals. While Diarra's performances have been the one constant in Marseille's awful season, the former Chelsea, Arsenal and Real Madrid star is tipped to join arch rivals PSG in the summer. The Player's Union also elect a coach of the year with PSG handler Laurent Blanc in the running after winning the League and League Cup with a French Cup final to come. Ben Arfa's coach Claude Puel, who took Monaco to the 2004 Champions League final, may well pip Blanc after a thrilling season at Nice. Also on the list are early season form team Angers' coach Stephane Moulin and Thierry Laurey who has worked wonders on a shoe-string budget at relegation threatened Corsican minnows Gazelec Ajaccio. Players short list: Hatem Ben Arfa (FRA/Nice), Lassana Diarra (FRA/Marseille), Angel Di Maria (ARG/PSG), Zlatan Ibrahimovic (SWE/PSG) Coaches short list: Laurent Blanc (FRA/Paris SG), Thierry Laurey (FRA/Gazélec Ajaccio), Stéphane Moulin (FRA/Angers), Claude Puel (FRA/Nice)"
93,14/04/2016,11:36,Lyon host Nice in clash of Champions League hopefuls,Lyon host Nice on Friday in a Ligue 1 clash between two in-form sides fighting for an automatic Champions League qualifying spot next season.,"Lyon, second behind Paris Saint-Germain whose midweek defeat to Manchester City ended French interest in the Champions League, are level on 55 points with Monaco who host struggling southern rivals Marseille on Sunday. But Nice are just two points behind with five matches left to play. Monaco's grip on an automatic qualifying berth loosened as the principality side were swept aside 4-1 at Lille last Sunday, before Hatem Ben Arfa's hat-trick saw Nice past Rennes 3-0. As Monaco wobble Nice are now on form with their star striker Ben Arfa in inspirational mood. Lyon meanwhile have netted 14 goals in their past five matches to move above Monaco on goal difference and into second spot and automatic qualification with a 2-0 win at Montpellier last week. It was Lyon's eighth win from their last 10 games, a run that has catapulted them back into contention for Europe's top club competition. Lyon, who had dropped to ninth place nine points behind Monaco, have been boosted by the return of injured players. Coach Bruno Genesio, appointed last December in place of Hubert Fournier, has managed to win over the sceptics with the way he has forged team spirit. And the 50-year-old admitted that the club's 2-1 win over PSG in January acted ""like a real trigger"". ""That made us aware of our qualities,"" said Genesio. Lyon are unbeaten in their last seven games at home and defender Christophe Jallet believes playing at their Parc Olympique Lyonnais will be decisive. ""We know that Nice have an experienced team, unfortunately for them they are coming to Lyon,"" said Jallet who extended his contract midweek until 2018. But the coach is above all able to count on a full squad compared to his predecessor, which has allowed him to even relegate French international midfielder Mathieu Valbuena to the bench. Forward Alexandre Lacazette has returned to full form demonstrating the efficiency which escaped him in the first half of the season, bringing his total to 16 Ligue 1 goals - 10 since the winter break. Players like Rachid Ghezzal and Maxwell Cornet, who scored both goals against Monptellier, have also found their stride. Monaco will be hoping to take advantage of the crisis in Marseille who are sitting 14th, just six points above the relegation zone. To add to the disarray Marseille owner Margarita Louis-Dreyfus announced on Wednesday that the club was now officially up for sale. PSG, meanwhile, return to domestic duty following their inglorious exit from Europe bidding to finish their season with dignity starting with Saturday's game at home to midtable Caen. Laurent Blanc, who made tactical errors against Man City, will need to avoid further disappointing the clubs Qatari owners.

94,11/04/2016,12:16,Ben Arfa still dreaming of Euro 2016,Hatem Ben Arfa admitted he is in the form of his life and still holds out hope of reaching the France squad for Euro 2016 after scoring the first hat-trick of his career on Sunday.,"The 29-year-old scored all the goals in Nice's 3-0 win against Rennes that leaves the south-coast side fourth in the Ligue 1 table, just two points off a Champions League spot with five matches remaining. Ben Arfa has scored 16 league goals in a superb season to relaunch his career after a frustrating time in England with Newcastle United and Hull City. Only Zlatan Ibrahimovic has scored more, and Ben Arfa later told sports daily L'Equipe: ""I'm loving it here. I am so happy to be playing at Nice. ""I am having the best time of my career, with these players and this coach,"" he added of life under Claude Puel on the Cote d'Azur. Ben Arfa, who is out of contract at the end of the season and attracting the interest of clubs abroad, was recalled to the France squad last November and won his 15th cap in the 2-0 friendly defeat in England. He was then left out of coach Didier Deschamps' squad for friendly wins over the Netherlands and Russia last month, leaving his hopes of being included when the hosts' 23-man squad for the Euros is announced on May 12 semingly in tatters. There is intense competition for places in the French attack, but Ben Arfa's display on Sunday put Rennes prodigy Ousmane Dembele firmly in the shade and the player himself is not giving up hope. ""The squad will be announced on May 12. I am going to give everything on the field to be there,"" he said. ""As long as there is still hope I will keep believing. You know, I am a competitor, you'll see, I will give everything and I will be there until the very end trying to reach our objectives."""
95,02/04/2016,19:06,Insatiable Ibrahimovic nets hat-trick in PSG victory,Zlatan Ibrahimovic bagged a hat-trick as Paris Saint-Germain warmed up for their Champions League clash with Manchester City by beating Nice 4-1 at the Parc des Princes on Saturday.,"Ibrahimovic took his tally for the season to 30 league goals and David Luiz also scored for PSG, who secured their fourth consecutive Ligue 1 title with eight matches to spare last month, while Hatem Ben Arfa had earlier found the net for Nice. It was the best possible preparation for Paris before they host City in the first leg of their Champions League quarter-final on Wednesday, as they bounced back from a 2-0 defeat at home to Monaco in their last outing before the international break and responded to City's 4-0 win at Bournemouth earlier in the Premier League. Coach Laurent Blanc sent out a strong side, albeit one in which youngster Hervin Ongenda made just his third league start of the season, and the capital club proved far too strong for a Nice side who started the day in third and were looking to close the gap on Monaco above them. Nice remain five points behind second-placed Monaco, who were beaten 2-1 at home by Bordeaux on Friday, and could be leapfrogged by both Lyon and Rennes with both clubs in action later this weekend. Ibrahimovic opened the scoring quarter of an hour in when he superbly controlled a high ball into the box by Luiz and fired past Nice goalkeeper Yoan Cardinale. However, the excellent Ben Arfa quickly brought Nice back on level terms with a superb strike that also exposed PSG's slight weakness in defence. The France winger saw centre-backs Luiz and Thiago Silva back off him, giving him the time and space to send a curling shot past Kevin Trapp into the top-left corner for his 14th goal of the season in all competitions. Nevertheless, PSG were back in front before the break thanks to a stunning Ibrahimovic free-kick, the Swede sending a rocket of a shot into the top-left corner from the edge of the area to make it 2-1. Brazil centre-back Luiz increased PSG's lead three minutes into the second half with a near-post header from a corner and Ibrahimovic completed his hat-trick eight minutes from time after being set up by Adrien Rabiot. The 34-year-old striker, who is out contract in the summer, has now equalled his best ever goals tally in a Ligue 1 season and has 38 for the campaign in all competitions."
96,20/03/2016,19:17,Brilliant Ben Arfa sparks Nice victory,Hatem Ben Arfa's latest breathtaking strike set Nice up for a 3-0 win over struggling Gazelec Ajaccio on Sunday that keeps them right in contention for a surprise top-three finish in Ligue 1.,"Ben Arfa collected possession wide on the right and skipped away from two challenges as he cut into the box before curling a shot beyond goalkeeper Clement Maury to set Nice on their way in the 14th minute at the Allianz Riviera. Ben Arfa, who was left out of the France squad for the upcoming friendly matches against the Netherlands and Russia, then turned provider for Alassane Plea to make it 2-0 and Ivorian midfielder Jean-Michael Seri wrapped up the victory late on. A third straight win for Claude Puel's side leaves them in the third place that brings with it a spot in next season's Champions League qualifying rounds. They are a point ahead of fourth-placed Lyon, who beat Nantes 2-0 on Saturday, and two clear of Rennes, 5-2 winners at Marseille on Friday. Nice also sit two points adrift of their Cote d'Azur rivals Monaco, who visit champions Paris Saint-Germain in Sunday's late match. At the bottom, Gazelec are in the relegation zone, although only goal difference separates them from Reims and the safety of 17th place. Earlier on Sunday, Bordeaux were held to a 1-1 draw at home by Bastia in their first match since Willy Sagnol was sacked and replaced in the dugout by club legend Ulrich Rame. Former Bayern Munich defender Diego Contento put Bordeaux ahead with only eight minutes remaining, but Bastia equalised moments later courtesy of Axel Ngando."
97,26/02/2016,22:40,Nice dealt blow by Bastia in race for Europe,Bastia continued their climb up the Ligue 1 table on Friday with a 2-0 victory away to Champions League hopefuls Nice.,"Hosts Nice, who have now won just once in six outings, were reduced to 10 men before the hour when Paul Baysse was dismissed, and Bastia took full advantage with goals from Sadio Diallo and Floyd Ayite shortly after. Nice remain in third spot above Saint-Etienne on goal difference in the race for France's third Champions League berth, while Bastia moved up to 10th after registering a third straight win. Paris Saint-Germain, unbeaten in 36 league matches, will aim to continue their march towards a fourth successive Ligue 1 title on Sunday when they visit fifth-place Lyon."
98,19/02/2016,23:31,Nice maintain European push with Bordeaux stalemate,Nice underlined their European aspirations with a goalless draw at Bordeaux on Friday which consolidated their third place in Ligue 1.,"The Riviera side, 6-1 winners at home against Bordeaux last September, quickly doused any hopes of revenge Willy Sagnol's side might have had. Lacking inspiration in front of goal, it was a disappointing result for Bordeaux who missed the chance to move to within one point of Nice. Nice have 41 points from 27 games, 29 points behind leaders Paris Saint-Germain who host struggling Reims on Saturday, with Bordeaux sitting ninth, four points behind their visitors. ""You have to admit that Nice are a great team who aren't on the foot of the podium (third) for nothing and who will be in the reckoning until the end of the season,"" said Sagnol. Without top scorer Hatem Ben Arfa, Claude Puel's side had few early opportunities apart from a header on seven minutes by defender Paul Baysse following a freekick by Ivorian Jean Michael Seri. But Nice goalkeeper Yoan Cardinale was made to work over the next half hour with a wave of pressure from the hosts lead by Argentine midfielder Valentin Vada. Mali forward Cheick Diabate, so prolific in January, missed two chances either side of the break, with Bordeaux's Ivorian striker Thomas Toure having no more success. Bordeaux's France international fullback Mathieu Debuchy, on loan from Arsenal, was forced off after 82 minutes with a hamstring injury. ""It doesn't seem serious but we'll need 48 hours to give a more precise diagnosis,"" said Sagnol with the player set to play with France in two pre-Euro 2016 friendlies against the Netherlands and Russia next month."

The 28-year-old has enjoyed a spectacular return to form this season, netting 11 league goals to spearhead Nice's challenge for European football next season. Claude Puel's side are third in France, above Saint-Etienne on goal difference, in the race for the final Champions League spot, although they will be without Ben Arfa at home to Marseille this weekend.

The Riveria derby clash between the second and third placed teams failed to ignite Monaco's Stade Louis II before midfielder Tiemoue Bakayoko struck after 81 minutes. A long free-kick off the boot of Portuguese midfielder Moutinho found Bakayoko who slotted in after the ball had bounced in front of Nice goalkeeper Yoan Cardinale. The win allows Monaco, second behind runaway leaders Paris Saint-Germain, to move six points clear of Nice, who remain third, two points ahead of Angers with Lyon moving up to fifth a further point back. Monaco's Moroccan midfielder Nabil Dirar was sent off after he vigorously disputed a call by referee Tony Chapron, as Angers were also playing a man down following a 16th minute red card for Thomas Mangani. ""The players showed that apart from PSG, there is no team better than us. We know each other well, we know how to play at 10 and showed this,"" said Monaco coach Leonardo Jardim. ""The players had a great match."" ""Paradoxically, the sending off seemed to do them good,"" said Nice coach Claude Puel. ""If they continue to be successful like that they can even envisage catching Paris,"" added Puel of Monaco who trail Paris Saint-Germain by 21 points. The reigning three-time champions will be looking to extend their Ligue 1 unbeaten streak at bitter rivals Marseille on Sunday. Lyon secured back-to-back league wins for the first time since November and gave new coach Bruno Genesio a first league victory away from home. Last season's runners-up took an early lead through Christophe Jallet, and the hosts fell two behind when winger Rachid Ghezzal picked out the roof of the net just after half-time. Corentin Tolisso wrapped up the scoring late on as Lyon moved to within three points of the Champions League places. ""It is satisfying to have a second consecutive victory and what was important is the way we found confidence as a team,"" Genesio said. ""I am not sure that it was a better performance than in the defeat at Saint Etienne or the draw with Marseille, but with our first real chance we got the opening goal and that is always so important now in Ligue 1."" With eight of the bottom nine teams in action in the five late Saturday kick-offs it was unsurprisingly a tense evening of football. Montpellier blew a great chance to haul themselves out of the bottom three as they were held to a 1-1 draw by ten-man Lorient. Francois Bellugou was given a straight red card, and Kevin Berigaud took advantage to give Frederic Hantz's Montpellier a half-time lead. But Jimmy Cabot scored his first goal for Lorient since joining from Troyes last month to snatch a point. Reims made the most of Montpellier's slip-up as they saw off Caen 2-0. Goals from Thievy Bifouma and Prince Oniangue helped take Olivier Guegan's Reims three points clear of the relegation zone. Bastia picked up a much-needed victory by easing past bottom club Troyes 2-0 despite having a man sent off for the fifth time in five league games. Goalkeeper Jean Louis Leca's red card was sandwiched by a Floyd Ayite brace for the Corsicans, as visiting Troyes were reduced to nine men in a feisty encounter. Gazelec Ajaccio are now winless in six league games and just a point above the drop zone after playing out a goalless draw with fellow strugglers Guingamp, who had Lionel Mathis kick off the pattern of the night with his 10th minute dismissal. Meanwhile, a 0-0 stalemate with Nantes leaves Toulouse second-from-bottom and six points from safety."

Businessman Edward Blackmore, the head of the Sports Investment Fund, said that he was unable to reveal the identity of his Gulf partner. ""We are investing together with my partner, but not only him,"" said Blackmore who would only say that the member of the Saudi royal family was at his home on the Cote d'Azur.

However, Ben Arfa netted a first penalty to bring Nice level 10 minutes from the end after Jean-Michael Seri was fouled inside the area. And the home side were awarded another spot-kick in the 84th minute when a Niklas Hult cross struck the arm of Vincent Manceau. Ben Arfa stepped up again to send Alexandre Letellier the wrong way from 12 yards and score his ninth Ligue 1 goal of the campaign. Nice, whose only defeat in their last six Ligue 1 games came against leaders Paris Saint-Germain, move provisionally up to third on goal difference from their Cote d'Azur rivals Monaco, who visit Lorient on Sunday. Angers remain a point above them in second but they are an enormous 20 points adrift of still unbeaten PSG, who can extend their advantage further with a win at Toulouse on Saturday. The big game of the weekend sees Lyon visit fierce rivals Saint-Etienne on Sunday evening."
105,14/01/2016,16:34,Broken leg ends Nice striker Le Bihan's season,"Nice striker Mickael Le Bihan has a fractured shin which has ruled him out for the rest of the season, the Ligue 1 club said on Thursday.",The 25-year-old will now undergo surgery after suffering the injury in September. It had gone unidentified until now. He was the top scorer in Ligue 2 last season with 18 goals in 36 games for Le Havre before joining Nice just prior to the closure of the summer transfer window.
106,20/11/2015,22:41,Nice beat Lyon as Ligue 1 resumes after Paris attacks,"Nice beat second-placed Lyon 3-0 as Ligue 1 resumed on Friday as scheduled, a week on from the Paris terror attacks that left 130 people dead and more than 350 injured.","Valere Germain and Vincent Koziello struck either side of a Mapou Yanga-Mbiwa own goal on an emotional evening at the Allianz Riviera as tributes were paid to the victims of last week's attacks in the French capital. A moving rendition of the French national anthem, 'La Marseillaise', was played before kick-off and was followed by a minute's silence, during which fans held aloft candles. A Nice supporters group had urged fans to come dressed in black to honour victims of last Friday's attacks, while players wore black armbands as a traditional mark of respect. Sports Minister Thierry Braillard, along with French football officials, had taken the decision on Tuesday to allow Ligue 1 and Ligue 2 matches to go ahead under heavy security, but without away fans. League president Frederic Thiriez said security forces across the country were too stretched to allow fans to travel. Mathieu Valbuena was named in the Lyon team just hours after giving evidence in the sex tape blackmail affair in which his France colleague Karim Benzema has been charged. Valbuena, who was seen leaving a Versailles court, on the outskirts on Paris, at around 12:45pm local time (1145 GMT) then travelled to the Cote d'Azur, almost 1,000 kilometres away, on a private jet laid on by the club. Lyon should have taken an early lead when Claudio Beauvue was left unmarked 10 yards out, only for the striker to blaze over the crossbar. The visitors, unbeaten on their last five trips to Nice, went even closer on the quarter hour as last year's leading scorer Alexandre Lacazette fired against the base of the post. Having initially rode their luck early Nice made the breakthrough 20 minutes in as Valere Germain gathered Jean-Michael Seri's pass and glided into the box before lifting a superb dinked finish over Lyon goalkeeper Anthony Lopes for his sixth goal of the season. The hosts stretched their lead three minutes after half-time when Lyon defender Mapou Yanga-Mbiwa inexplicably diverted Jeremy Pied's low cross into his own net. Twenty-year-old Vincent Koziello rounded off the victory on 71 minutes with a thumping finish into the roof of the net as Nice climbed to third in the table, just a point behind Lyon. Reigning champions Paris Saint-Germain travel to Lorient on Saturday with a chance to further increase their healthy 10-point cushion at the top."
107,16/11/2015,02:05,To Hull and back - Ben Arfa comes in from cold,"For Hatem Ben Arfa, France's friendly against England on Tuesday represents an opportunity to show both countries that they were wrong to think they had seen the best of him.","Ben Arfa left England almost a year ago following an unsuccessful loan spell at Hull City and subsequently spent nine long months in the sporting wilderness after a proposed return to French football collapsed. But having made a storming start to the season with Nice, he is back in the France squad after three years away and returns to England with next year's European Championship on home soil in his sights. ""I'm savouring every moment,"" the 28-year-old forward said last week. ""I know that it's very far away, and that lots of things could happen between now and then, but it's a target to play in a Euro in your own country. It'd be a crazy thing."" A year ago, the crazy thing was the thought of ever seeing Ben Arfa in a France shirt again as the talented but quarrelsome winger crawled towards the end of a brief, disappointing stint at Hull. Frozen out by Alan Pardew at Newcastle United, where he was made to endure what he called the ""hell"" of having to train with 16 and 17-year-olds in the club's reserves, Ben Arfa had joined Hull in the hope of resurrecting his career. But he was no happier at the KC Stadium and after just five Premier League starts he signed for Nice, only for FIFA to block the move due to transfer rules barring players from playing for more than two clubs in one season. It left Ben Arfa stranded, unable to play competitive football and forced to swat away rumours that he was contemplating retirement at the age of just 27. His career was at a crossroads, but he got his head down, hired a personal fitness coach and made sure that, when Nice were finally in a position to complete a move for him in June, he was ready. Playing either up front or as a number 10, Ben Arfa has been a sensation, scoring seven goals -- including staggering solo efforts against Caen and Saint-Etienne -- and providing two assists. In doing so he has inspired a youthful team whose tally of 27 goals in 13 games is bettered by only Paris Saint-Germain in Ligue 1, causing France's football fans to fall in love all over again with one of French sport's most notorious 'enfants terribles'. Ben Arfa credits his return to form to Nice's disciplinarian coach Claude Puel, who dismisses the notion that it was simply a case of giving the former Lyon prodigy the freedom to play. ""I actually think people have said that to him too much in the past,"" Puel told France Football magazine. ""We didn't roll out the red carpet for him."" According to Nice captain Mathieu Bodmer: ""It works here because people leave him alone."" Ben Arfa got lost looking for the toilets on his first day back at Clairefontaine, France's national training centre, which he first got to know as a preternaturally gifted 12-year-old. Prior to Friday's 2-0 friendly win over Germany, when he made a late cameo, his previous game for France had come at Euro 2012, when he was substituted in the 59th minute of a 2-0 group-stage loss to Sweden in Kiev. He was subsequently given a warning by the French Football Federation after an alleged altercation with then-coach Laurent Blanc, which only served to emboss his reputation as a troublemaker. Three years on, with Karim Benzema and Mathieu Valbuena embroiled in a blackmail scandal, it is other players who are giving France coach Didier Deschamps headaches. Ben Arfa clashed with Deschamps during their time at Marseille, which yielded a Ligue 1 title triumph in 2010, but it seems that belatedly, he has learnt to do his talking on the pitch."
108,08/11/2015,19:10,Nice bounce back to sink Marseille,Nice returned to winning ways on Sunday as a first-half Valere Germain goal secured a 1-0 victory away to Mediterranean rivals Marseille at the Stade Velodrome in Ligue 1.,"Germain, who was born in Marseille when his father Bruno was playing for OM and supported the club as a boy, got the only goal of the game in the 16th minute, collecting a Wallyson Mallmann pass and drilling in a low shot from range that beat Steve Mandanda and found the bottom-left corner. It was a welcome win for Nice, who were recently inspired to a fine run of form by the brilliance of Hatem Ben Arfa but made the trip along France's south coast after failing to win any of their previous three Ligue 1 outings. Claude Puel's side move provisionally up to sixth in the table, but there was more frustration for Marseille, who have never really got going under Spanish coach Michel. After three straight wins in all competitions, this setback leaves OM in 12th place, only three points above the relegation zone. ""I am more disappointed than worried,"" said Michel, who had to make do without the injured Romain Alessandrini and the suspended Lassana Diarra, Remy Cabella and Nicolas Nkoulou. ""I don't think it was the absences that made the difference today."" The encounter was notable for the return of Ben Arfa to face his former club -- the winger, who was this week recalled to the France squad for upcoming friendlies against Germany and England, played for Marseille between 2008 and 2010 before joining Newcastle United. However, it was on-loan Monaco striker Germain who made the decisive intervention, his fifth goal of the season, and first since late September, proving enough to give Nice the points. Ben Arfa had a shot palmed away by Mandanda after he held off Karim Rekik just after the half-hour mark, and he also had a free-kick turned around the post by Mandanda in the second period. Jean-Michael Seri also threatened from a free-kick for the visitors, while Marseille offered little, coming closest to levelling when Michy Batshuayi muscled his way into the box in the second half before firing over the bar. Later on Sunday, Lyon host bitter rivals Saint-Etienne in what will be the last ever Rhone-Alpes derby at the Stade de Gerland before OL move into a new 59,000-seat stadium early in the New Year ahead of Euro 2016. Mathieu Valbuena was included in the Lyon starting line-up at the end of a week overshadowed by the arrest of his France colleague Karim Benzema. The Real Madrid striker was charged with complicity to blackmail and conspiring to commit a criminal act in an extortion case involving a sex tape featuring Valbuena. Second place is the prize on offer to the winner of that game, while Monaco can climb into the European places if they win at Bordeaux. On Saturday, Paris Saint-Germain extended their lead at the top of the table to 11 points by thumping hapless Toulouse 5-0 to continue their unbeaten start to the domestic season. Zlatan Ibrahimovic scored twice, and now has nine goals in his last six Ligue 1 appearances, with Angel Di Maria, Lucas Moura and Ezequiel Lavezzi also on target at the Parc des Princes. Caen are second in the table after beating Guingamp 2-1 in Normandy with burly striker Andy Delort scoring what proved to be the winning goal."
109,27/09/2015,23:22,Brilliant Ben Arfa inspires Nice victory,"Hatem Ben Arfa produced two moments of magic as nine-man Nice romped to a 4-1 victory away at Saint-Etienne on Sunday, preventing their opponents from closing the gap on Ligue 1 leaders Paris Saint-Germain.","Vincent Koziello had given Nice an early lead at the Stade Geoffroy-Guichard, but Loic Perrin soon equalised for Saint-Etienne, converting the rebound after a Fabien Lemoine shot crashed back off the bar. That was when Ben Arfa intervened, volleying past Stephane Ruffier and into the far corner of the net to put the visitors back in front in the 39th minute. Even better was to come a minute prior to the interval as Ben Arfa, who started out at Saint-Etienne's bitter rivals Lyon, dribbled into the box past several challenges and dispatched a low shot across Ruffier. The goals were confirmation that France international Ben Arfa is flourishing again in his homeland after a disappointing spell in England with Newcastle United and then Hull City followed by six months out of the game earlier this year. ""Sometimes, Hatem can be very good but he never lets it go to his head,"" said Nice coach Claude Puel. ""He stays focussed just like his teammates. We all know his quality and that he can settle situations at any time. Tonight was easily his best game for us."" Jean-Michael Seri put Nice further ahead following a counter-attack led by Valere Germain, before Nampalys Mendy and Maxime Le Marchand were both sent off in the final half-hour. The latter walked after conceding a penalty that was missed by Jean-Christophe Bahebeck as Nice claimed a third win in just over a week following a 3-1 victory at Bastia and a 6-1 thumping of Bordeaux. Nice are up to seventh while Saint-Etienne remain second, four points behind leaders and defending champions Paris Saint-Germain, who won 4-1 at Nantes on Saturday. Elsewhere on Sunday, Marseille's poor start to the season continued with a 2-1 defeat at home to promoted Angers. Goals from Thomas Mangani, a penalty, and Romain Thomas had Marseille in deep trouble at the Stade Velodrome before Michy Batshuayi reduced the deficit 11 minutes from time, again from the spot. The result left Michel's struggling side down in the bottom half of the table, just four points above the relegation zone. ""We played very badly in the first half, that's not the way to start a match,"" moaned Michel. ""We weren't in the match and were below par for many minutes. We lacked creativity and penetration. I can't explain it but we'll have to find a solution."" Angers continued their impressive return to the top flight after an absence of 21 years as they moved into fifth, level on points with third-placed Rennes. ""Fifteen points after eight matches is crazy,"" said Angers coach Stephane Moulin. ""We're not crazy, we know Marseille are better than us, individually and collectively, but in football little teams can make life difficult for the big ones."" It was a disastrous outcome for Marseille to a peculiar match in which the Velodrome was empty at both ends due to a punishment related to last weekend's incidents during the 1-1 draw with Lyon, in which several Marseille fans threw missiles at police and onto the pitch. Later on, a lucky goal from Nicolas Benezet a minute from time denied Monaco victory as Guingamp snatched a 3-3 draw in Brittany. Having won 3-2 at Montpellier on Thursday, Monaco looked on course for a second successive away victory but despite taking the lead three times in the match, through Bernardo Silva, Andrea Raggi and Nabil Dirar, the hosts pegged them back each time thanks to Sloan Privat and a Benezet brace, the last of which appeared to be a cross that sliced into the net at the near post. Montpellier, the 2012 champions, got their first win of the season in a 2-1 victory over mid-table Lorient. Jonas Martin hit the winner in the 57th minute after Lorient's Raffidine Abdullah -- who was later sent off -- had cancelled out Ramy Bensebaini's opener, although Montpellier remain in the bottom three."
110,23/09/2015,21:50,Ben Arfa at double as Nice hit Bordeaux for six,"Hatem Ben Arfa inspired Nice to a come-from-behind 6-1 victory over Bordeaux on Wednesday, scoring twice in a performance that should help bury his recent tussles with footballing red tape.","Jaroslav Plasil had finished off a neat Bordeaux build-up on six minutes as the visitors looked firmly on top, but Nice soon pulled ahead thanks to Ben Arfa's industry and imagination. Goals from Valere Germain and then Mikael Le Bihan, who tapped in a rebound from a long range shot from Ben Arfa, had Nice 2-1 ahead at half-time. From the restart things got even worse for Bordeaux with a red card for Enzo Crivelli after 50 minutes and then an own-goal by Nicolas Pallois a minute later. Ben Arfa then crowned a magnificent personal performance with a brace of goals on 68 and 74 minutes, one a tap in after a lightning breakaway, the other a flashing shot after a mazy run. Alexandre Mendy added the sixth in the 84th minute. Ben Arfa had been set to join Nice during the last winter break but was caught up in an administrative mix-up before FIFA and the French football governing body stepped in to block the transfer. He had played a game with Newcastle's reserves during the summer of 2014 before being loaned out to Hull City, meaning he was prevented from joining Nice due to a rule that a player can only play for two clubs in a single season. Earlier this week, he lost his appeal against the ruling and where he had been trying to recover the earnings he lost during the time he was sidelined. Saint Etienne needed an own goal in a 1-0 win against plucky newcomers Troyes, which came when Thomas Ayase tried to keep track with the onrushing striker Romain Hamouma only to turn the ball into his own goal. Christophe Galtier's team came fifth last season but are now sitting pretty in second, just a point behind Paris Saint Germain who beat Guingamp 1-0 on Tuesday. Elsewhere, Lyon beat Bastia 2-0, Lorient beat Caen by the same score and tiny Gazalec Ajaccio of Corsica got their first home points in Ligue 1 with a 1-1 draw with Rennes."
111,18/09/2015,16:19,CAS reject Ben Arfa appeal,The Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) has dismissed an appeal filed by French footballer Hatem Ben Arfa against a FIFA decision which blocked him for playing for Ligue 1 side Nice last season.,"The 28-year-old midfielder had been set to join Nice during the winter break but was caught up in an administrative mix-up before FIFA and the French football governing body stepped in to block the transfer. Ben Arfa had played a game with Newcastle's reserves during the summer of 2014 before being loaned out to Premier League rivals Hull City, meaning he was prevented from joining Nice due to a rule that a player can only play for two clubs in a single season. The former Lyon and Marseille forward spent six months without a club before returning to France after five years in England by joining Nice at the start of the current season. In his appeal, Ben Arfa sought the annulment of the FIFA decision, but CAS said in a statement ""the player did not prove how the annulment of the FIFA Decision would impact him financially or sportingly"". ""In conclusion, the Panel found that Hatem Ben Arfa did not have standing to challenge the FIFA Decision and dismissed his appeal,"" the statement added."

The fee will be of immense use to Nice, who have been searching for funds for its future training centre whose cost is put at 15million euros. Amavi, who will see his wages rise considerably with the move, has only played at leftback for a season having been converted from attacking midfielder by Nice manager Claude Puel playing 36 times last season and scoring four goals. Amavi, whose large transfer fee represents a gamble by Sherwood and for a team that has struggled to avoid relegation in the past two seasons, made his Ligue 1 debut in 2012 but only became a regular first choice last term"

Minutes later, Mathieu Bodmer deflected a speculative effort from Said Benrahma to level with the last kick of the half. But Paris took a decisive lead in the second half with a fine volley from Pastore and an Edinson Cavani penalty in a game sandwiched between Champions League commitments. PSG temporarily moved a point ahead Lyon at the top of the table ahead of Sunday's derby against Saint-Etienne. Nice remain mired in midtable in 11th but are still not sade, only six points above the relegation zone. With Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Marco Verratti suspended, on top of injuries to Thiago Silva and Thiago Motta, PSG coach Laurent Blanc had to rely on a reshuffled team to get past the French Riviera side.

But it was Pastore's fourth goal of the season, following a defence-opening pass by Lucas, who gave PSG the breakthrough with their first real chance of the match. It was, however, quickly cancelled out by former Parisian Bodmer, although Nice still went into the half-time break frustrated to have nothing more to show form their first half dominance.

122,17/04/2015,02:25,"Wounded Paris resume title chase, Lyon face derby rivals",Paris Saint-Germain will have little time to lick their wounds following their Champions League loss to Barcelona as they turn their focus back to the Ligue 1 title race for Saturday's trip to Nice.,"PSG are staring at a third successive exit from the Champions League at the quarter-final stage after losing 3-1 at home to Barcelona in the first leg at the Parc des Princes on Wednesday. The second leg at the Camp Nou awaits next Tuesday, but Laurent Blanc's side can ill afford a slip-up when they face Nice, 650 kilometres along the Mediterranean coast, at the Allianz Riviera on Saturday afternoon. Blanc acknowledged the game is one his side ""absolutely have to win"" as they lie a point behind leaders Lyon, albeit with a game in hand. Already banned against Barcelona in midweek, Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Marco Verratti will be suspended again, while captain Thiago Silva came off with a thigh injury in the first half on Wednesday and Blanc may not be willing to risk David Luiz after he had to play 70 minutes of the Champions League game after being rushed back from a hamstring problem. Having already beaten Lyon, Monaco and Marseille this season, mid-table Nice may therefore fancy their chances as they look to pull further clear of the relegation zone. However, when asked if he thought this was a good time to face PSG, Nice coach Claude Puel replied: ""I don't think so. I would have preferred to play PSG after a good result. For them, for French football and for us. ""They didn't play as well as they would have wanted against the Catalans and they will be eager to put in a better showing against us."" Lyon reclaimed top spot on Wednesday when they beat Bastia 2-0 thanks to late goals by Mohamed Yattara and Alexandre Lacazette, the latter getting his 25th in the league this season. Hubert Fournier's side have won their last two outings to boost their title chances but now they play host to Saint-Etienne in the most passionate derby in French football at the Stade de Gerland on Sunday evening. Lyon may have home advantage but Les Verts come into the Rhone derby in great shape, a run of seven games unbeaten in the league leaving them fifth in the table, two points shy of the podium. In addition, having struggled so badly in the derby for the last two decades, Christophe Galtier's team won 3-0 at home to Lyon in November and have lost on just one of their last six visits to their rivals. ""It is a chance for us to make the supporters and the city proud. It would be great if we could repeat our performance of last season but Lyon will want revenge,"" said Saint-Etienne midfielder Jeremy Clement, who started his career with Lyon. Monaco currently occupy the third and last qualifying berth for next season's Champions League as they prepare to welcome Rennes to the Stade Louis II on Saturday. ""For me it is the key game that we have to win if we are to finish on the podium. It is the most important match in Ligue 1 this year,"" said Monaco coach Leonardo Jardim. His team are unbeaten in eight league games but this match falls between the two legs of their Champions League quarter-final tie against Juventus and captain Jeremy Toulalan could again miss out with a hamstring problem. A point behind Monaco in fourth, Marseille are at Nantes on Friday, while Bordeaux in sixth go to in-form Lille on Sunday. At the foot, the bottom two Metz and Lens meet in what is almost certainly the last chance for either to avoid the drop. Fixtures (kick-offs 1800 GMT unless stated)"
123,10/04/2015,19:23,Nice defender Diawara behind bars for extortion,Nice's Senegalese defender Souleymane Diawara was remanded in custody in a Marseille prison on Friday for attempted extortion in a case involving the purchase of a stolen car.,"According to police sources, Diawara, 36, and four other people, including his brother, tried to take the law into their own hands by attempting to get the player's money back from a man who had sold him a Porsche which later turned out to have been stolen. Diawara is said to have bought the Porsche Cayenne for 50,000 euros in cash, but discovering it was stolen, he and the four others visited the seller's home in the middle of the night. They are alleged to have threatened the man, whose wife and two children were also present, but no weapons were used and no-one was hurt in the altercation. Diawara's lawyer Gregory Bensadoun told French TV station BFM TV he ""found it incredible that someone who is beyond reproach"" like Diawara should find himself ""detained"". ""For now, nothing can justify him being held in custody,"" he added. The seller was interviewed by police but later released without charge Diawara, capped 48 times by his country, has previously won the French title with both Bordeaux and Marseille, where is considered a club legend. He has played 14 league matches this season for Nice."
124,01/03/2015,19:00,Montpellier edge Nice to close on European places,Nice found the back of the net for the first time in five games but couldn't keep their lead in a 2-1 defeat against Montpellier on Sunday.,"Eric Bautheac's penalty after 36 minutes put the visitors in front but Bryan Dabo fired a rapid equaliser just before the break. Lucas Barrios, who initiated the play with a deft backheel, pounced on a deflected Souleymane Camara attempt to grab the winner in the 66th minute. The former Borussia Dortmund forward's seventh goal of the season lifted Montpellier level with Bordeaux in sixth, one point behind Monaco. Earlier, a Yacine Bammou strike offered Nantes their first win of 2015 when they beat Guingamp 1-0 in a hard-fought Brittany derby. On Saturday, leaders Lyon were stunned 2-1 by Lille in their first defeat in 12 games on Saturday. Their defeat gives Paris Saint-Germain the chance to climb above OL into top spot if they can win at in-form Monaco later Sunday. Lyon, however, remain four points ahead of third-placed Marseille, who suffered a shock 3-2 defeat at home to Caen on Friday."
125,20/02/2015,23:28,Monaco warm up for Arsenal with derby win,Monaco gave themselves a boost ahead of their trip to play Arsenal in the Champions League by beating Cote d'Azur rivals Nice 1-0 at the Allianz Riviera in Ligue 1 on Friday.,"Substitute Bernardo Silva was the hero for the principality side, coming off the bench to net the only goal of the game five minutes from time. The Portuguese midfielder stroked the ball low into the far corner of the net from the edge of the box after Yannick Ferreira Carrasco had intercepted a Kevin Gomis clearance to give Monaco a win that lifts them up to fourth place in the table before the rest of the weekend's games. It was their first league win since late January and the clean sheet was their ninth in their last 10 Ligue 1 games. However, it was not all good news for Leonardo Jardim's side, who saw influential left-back Layvin Kurzawa limp off in the first half with a knock that may make him a doubt for Wednesday's Champions League last-16 first leg against the Premier League side. In addition, Monaco won the game despite having Tunisian defender Aymen Abdennour sent off in stoppage time at the end of the first half for a dangerous challenge on Romain Genevois. Abdennour will now be automatically suspended for next week's home game with Paris Saint-Germain, and such selection problems are not what Jardim would have wanted at a time when the likes of Andrea Raggi and Ricardo Carvalho are already on the sidelines. However, Jardim was delighted to get the three points, while Nice slumped to a first league defeat of 2015 as they failed to score for the fourth game in a row, only coming close to scoring when Carlos Eduardo headed against the bar in the second half. ""Nice started the match well but from the 25th minute on, we controlled it,"" said Jardim. ""It was difficult when we were down to 10 men but we still played well. ""Layvin Kurzawa took a knock on the thigh but we will see if he can recover in time to play Arsenal on Wednesday."" Monaco move above Saint-Etienne, who entertain second-placed Marseille on Sunday. Leaders Lyon, who are two points clear at the top, play host to Nantes on Sunday while Paris Saint-Germain, in third, are at home to Toulouse on Saturday. PSG must do without the injured Serge Aurier, Yohan Cabaye, Lucas and Thiago Motta for that game, while David Luiz and Marco Verratti are both banned."

Under world football's governing body rules, he cannot join a third team during the same season. The French Football League immediately slapped a ban on Ben Arfa from playing for Nice this season. However, the league's judicial commission said they would allow the player to train with the Ligue 1 club. The English Football Association (FA) had contacted FIFA on January 23 in a bid to clear up confusion concerning the transfer of the French midfielder.

Ben Arfa was on loan at Hull City from Newcastle United during the first half of the season and FIFA have said he cannot sign for Nice because a player cannot appear for more than two clubs in the same season. The 27-year-old playmaker's appearance for Newcastle's under-21 team on August 25, before moving on loan to Hull, was considered an official match by FIFA. It means his proposed move to Nice cannot be rubber-stamped by the French Football Federation (FFF), effectively leaving him without a club until next season. The FFF have written to FIFA asking for a ""clear and firm"" ruling for the sports' world governing body in the case."
130,14/01/2015,18:16,Ben Arfa's Nice move hits stumbling block,"France international Hatem Ben Arfa could find himself left in limbo until the end of the season after FIFA said he cannot sign for Nice, the French Football Federation said Wednesday.","FIFA rules state that a player can appear for no more than two clubs in the same season. Ben Arfa was on loan to Hull City from Newcastle United during the first half of the season before the former cancelled his loan and the latter tore up his contract, both of which were due to run out at the end of the season. That freed him up to move back home and join Nice, but now FIFA have said that because the 27-year-old turned out for Newcastle's under-21 team at the beginning of the season in an official match, he cannot join a third team in the current season. It means his proposed move to Nice cannot be rubber stamped by the FFF, effectively leaving him without a club until next season."
131,12/01/2015,16:24,Ben Arfa move to Nice runs into trouble,"French international Hatem Ben Arfa's move to Nice has run into administrative difficulties, the club announced on Monday.","Ben Arfa, 27, was released from his contract by Newcastle United after his loan deal with Premier League Hull City was cancelled, and agreed to return to France, signing an 18-month deal with Nice last week. But the paperwork has still not gone through and he was unable to make his debut in the weekend's 3-1 win over Lorient. And it now emerges that the stumbling block is the French Federation's refusal to rubber-stamp the deal until it receives the green light from FIFA. The Federation are asking for clarification of ""the rule which states a player cannot take part in official matches for three different clubs during the course of the same season"", Nice explained on their official website. Ben Arfa did not play for Newcastle in the Premier League after being disciplined by then manager Alan Pardew, and was subsequently loaned to Hull. However, he did play in an English Under-21 Premier League game against Reading in August, while training with Newcastle reserves before joining Hull. Although the English FA does not consider matches in the newly-formed under-21 league official fixtures, the French Federation want to make sure FIFA agree before clearing his move to Nice and issuing an international transfer certificate, Nice explained."

Ben Arfa, who has played 13 times for France but has a bad reputation for indiscipline in his homeland, said he had ""really wanted to return to France"" following four and a half years in the English Premier League. Although born in the Parisian suburbs, he began his career at Lyon before moving to Marseille. He won the French title four times with Lyon and once with Marseille before moving to Newcastle in 2010 ""We know we've signed a boy with history but I met someone at peace who told me about his desire to play football, to enjoy himself and to bring pleasure to us,"" said Nice president Jean-Pierre Rivere. Ben Arfa fell out with Newcastle manager Alan Pardew -- who has since moved to Crystal Palace -- and was loaned out to Hull at the beginning of this season, only for their manager Steve Bruce to reveal that the move had not worked out due to a difference of opinion. Ben Arfa played just eight times for Hull."

135,03/01/2015,12:42,Ben Arfa set for transfer to Nice,"French midfielder Hatem Ben Arfa is set to join Nice, the Ligue 1 side announced on Saturday, on what could be an 18-month long contract.","The 27-year-old is currently on Newcastle's books but has been on loan with Hull City this season without establishing himself in Steve Bruce's side. His loan spell at the KC Stadium was cut short and Newcastle have made it clear there is no further role for home at St James' Park, opening up the prospect of a return to France. ""OGC Nice have reached an agreement in principle with Hatem Ben Arfa. The France international will have a medical on Monday prior to signing with Le Gym,"" the club said on its website, adding that he had trained with his new teammates on Saturday. Sources close to the Cote d'Azur side said that the length of the contract would likely be 18 months. Ben Arfa, who emerged as one of France's most promising players early in his career with Lyon and Marseille, won the last of his 13 caps for France at Euro 2012. He joined Hull on a season-long loan from Newcastle United in the summer, but failed to make an impact in his nine Premier League appearances. He also had a strained relationship with Bruce who reportedly was unhappy with Ben Arfa's lack of work ethic at training. He subsequently returned to Paris and was training on his own, fuelling speculation that he was looking for a return to France. Nice are currently in 11th place in Ligue 1 just three points clear of the relegation zone."

Nevertheless, Laurent Blanc's side remain unbeaten this season and have now recorded nine consecutive victories in all competitions, with this latest triumph allowing them to close the gap on Marseille back to one point following OM's 2-0 defeat of Nantes on Friday night. ""The third match in a week is always a difficult match. We changed half the side from the one that beat Ajax on Tuesday,"" said PSG coach Blanc. ""We'd like to be better, but we're working on it and the best is still to come for this team."" PSG welcomed back captain Thiago Silva and Thiago Motta after both had missed the midweek Champions League game against Ajax, and while Nice might have opened the scoring inside seven minutes when Alassane Plea tested Salvatore Sirigu with a low shot, the home side came flying out of the blocks. Edinson Cavani, who had scored seven goals in his last seven club appearances, sent a dipping volley from outside the area narrowly wide before Ibrahimovic showed sublime skill to take down a long Javier Pastore ball, turn and lash a shot against the post. The breakthrough duly arrived on the quarter-hour when a penalty was awarded after Lucas was cleaned out in the box by two Nice defenders, Jordan Amavi and Romain Genevois. And Ibrahimovic, who scored a hat-trick in this fixture last season, stepped up to score from the spot despite goalkeeper Mouez Hassen diving the right way. Cavani then forced a good save out of Hassen after exchanging passes with Ibrahimovic but, perhaps with one eye on next Wednesday's trip to Lille, Paris were unable to keep up their excellent start to the game. ""My team learned a great deal tonight, we were overwhelmed in the first half hour,"" said Nice handler Claude Puel. ""We were so tense in the first-half we could hardly clear the ball. But we survived the storm with great team-work and generosity."" Nice maintained hope of snatching something from the encounter and Plea should have done better with a header from Amavi's cross before the latter himself glanced a header wide from a free-kick 12 minutes from time. However, PSG held out and have now been beaten just once in their last 38 home league games. Marseille continue to set the pace after Florian Thauvin scored one goal and set up another on Friday to end Nantes' sequence of nine matches without defeat that had seen the resurgent Canaries climb into the top four. Thauvin deftly converted a Dimitri Payet cross and then saw his free-kick headed in by Rod Fanni before half-time for Marcelo Bielsa's side. In the later games on Saturday, Monaco followed their Champions League win at Bayer Leverkusen in midweek with a 2-0 defeat at Rennes, as the Brittany outfit climbed to fourth. Three rapid-fire goals in five second-half minutes saw Lorient climb out of the relegation zone with a 3-2 win at Toulouse. Caen and Motpellier drew 1-1, Lens beat Metz 2-0 in the northern derby and Bastia's new interim coach Ghislain Printant saw his side slump back into the relegation zone with a 2-1 defeat at Reims. On Sunday, third-placed Lyon make the short journey to face derby rivals Saint-Etienne, who are sixth."

138,19/10/2014,21:03,Bastia refuse blame for Nice crowd trouble,French Ligue 1 club SC Bastia declared on Sunday that they would not accept any punishment from authorities for the brawl and pitch invasion that marred the end of their match with Nice on Saturday.,"At the end of the game at Nice's Allianz Riviera stadium, which Bastia won 1-0, the visitors' substitute goalkeeper Jean-Louis Leca took to the pitch brandishing a Corsican flag, portraying a Moor's head, the emblem of the island, above his head. Players from both sides then clashed and dozens of supporters forced their way onto the pitch in an apparent attempt to get at Leca. However, a statement issued by Bastia read: ""We will not accept any punishments to Sporting Club Bastia or any suggestion that Jean-Louis Leca played the role of provocateur."" They added that Leca simply ""wanted to display with conviction and in a peaceful manner his pride in what he is -- a Corsican player who had won a hugely important derby for the first time in 20 years."" Four men were later arrested and remanded in custody after invading the pitch, and both clubs are likely to be punished by the French league. The incidents came after a government decree ordered that no travelling supporters could attend the game between the two rivals. Local authorities in Nice also banned ""the carrying, holding or use of any object or item of clothing in the colours of SC Bastia."" Nice claim that the trouble was sparked by Leca's actions, and the player himself admitted that the carrying of the flag was in response to the local government order. Bastia added that ""the presence of the flag in the stadium constituted the symbolic response to the surreal and liberty killing decree"" of the Prefect of the Alpes-Maritimes department. Nice is the main port for ferries connecting the French mainland with the Mediterranean island of Corsica and there is a deep-rooted rivalry between supporters of the two clubs. The incidents came after the Euro 2016 qualifier between Serbia and Albania in Belgrade had to be abandoned last Tuesday night after a drone was flown over the pitch carrying a pro-Albanian flag, sparking fighting on and off the pitch."
139,16/10/2014,21:40,Puel extends deal as Nice coach,"Nice coach Claude Puel has signed a one-year extension to his contract, keeping him on the Cote d'Azur until 2016, the Ligue 1 club announced on Thursday.","The 53-year-old Puel, who arrived at Nice in July 2012 on an initial three-year deal, also has the option of extending by a further season. Sources close to the club indicated that he will receive an increase on his monthly salary of 100,000 euros (£79,582, $127,916). Nice finished fourth in Ligue 1 in Puel's first season in charge but ended last season just one place above the relegation zone. Puel spent his entire playing career with Nice's local rivals Monaco and then coached the principality club to the title in 2000 before enjoying a successful six years at Lille and three seasons at Lyon, in which time he took them to the Champions League semi-finals in 2010."
140,24/09/2014,21:22,Lille slump to first defeat of season,"Lille slumped to their first Ligue 1 defeat of the season on Wednesday, shattering their hopes of moving into second place in the table behind leaders Marseille.","It was Lille's first away defeat since February when Nice also got the better of them, also by a single goal. On Wednesday, it was their former player Mathieu Bodmer who secured Nice's third home win of the season with a 41st minute header from a corner. Lille remain fourth in the table, four points off the lead, but they can be overtaken later in the evening when champions Paris Saint Germain go to Caen. Lyon, the seven-time champions, were the night's biggest winners with a 4-0 home win against Lorient. Nabil Fekir scored twice with Alexandre Lacazette and 21-year-old Clinton N'Jie also on target. Highly-rated Cameroon star N'Jie had earlier signed a new five-year deal with Hubert Fournier's side and marked the occasion in style with his first goal for the club. Monaco, last season's runners-up, recorded their third win in three games to shake off their early season slump which had seen them slip to bottom place. After a Champions League win over Leverkusen and a 1-0 win against Guingamp, Monaco needed a stoppage time winner from substitute Valere Germain to beat Montpellier. Monaco are now comfortably in mid-table with 10 points from seven games. On Tuesday, Marseille picked up their fifth straight victory as top scorer Andre-Pierre Gignac claimed a brace in a 5-0 thrashing of Reims. Gignac could even afford the luxury of a missed eighth-minute penalty, before scoring two first-half goals while Ghana international Andre Ayew also struck twice at the Stade Auguste Delaune. The win took Marcelo Bielsa's side three points clear at the top of the French table ahead of Saint-Etienne and Bordeaux who meet on Thursday. ""It's very satisfying to get five wins in a row and we did it in style as well,"" said Gignac, who also scored twice in the 3-0 win over Rennes at the weekend. ""Obviously it's been a good day and now we can look forward to a big match against Saint-Etienne on Sunday."""

Bielsa's methods had been called into question after Marseille took just one point from their opening two games of the campaign but they recorded a narrow 1-0 win at Guingamp last weekend and were far too strong for Claude Puel's Nice at the newly refurbished Velodrome. Payet, who Marseille had been keen to get off their wage bill this summer, opened the scoring in the 19th minute, slotting home after Andre Ayew's initial effort had been blocked by former OM defender Souleymane Diawara. Nice won away to their south-coast foes in Ligue 1 and in the French Cup last season, but they never looked like doing so again this time and they conceded again right on half-time, Thauvin being left with an easy finish into an empty net from Ayew's ball across the face of goal. The third goal arrived just three minutes after the restart, with Payet beating 'keeper Mouez Hassen with a diving header from Thauvin's flighted cross, and after substitute Romain Alessandrini had an effort cleared off the line, the hosts completed a convincing win with three minutes left. Hassen saved from Giannelli Imbula, but the rebound fell to Alessandrini, who cut the ball back for Barrada, making his debut after signing from Al Jazira in the United Arab Emirates, to tap home. Monaco are at home to Lille on Saturday, while Sunday sees leaders Bordeaux looking to extend their perfect start to the season at home to Bastia before champions Paris Saint-Germain entertain Saint-Etienne in the capital."

The third goal arrived just three minutes after the restart, with Payet beating 'keeper Mouez Hassen with a diving header from Thauvin's flighted cross, and after substitute Romain Alessandrini had an effort cleared off the line, the hosts completed a convincing win with three minutes left. Hassen saved from Giannelli Imbula, but the rebound fell to Alessandrini, who cut the ball back for Barrada, making his debut after signing from Al Jazira in the United Arab Emirates, to tap home. Monaco are at home to Lille on Saturday, while Sunday sees leaders Bordeaux looking to extend their perfect start to the season at home to Bastia before champions Paris Saint-Germain entertain Saint-Etienne in the capital."

150,13/04/2014,16:21,Football: Nice protest ban on mascot eagle,French Ligue 1 side Nice are furious at the professional league for banning their club mascot eagle from flying before matches.,"The eagle was unleashed at Nice's home game against Lorient on Saturday night two days after the French Professional League (LFP) imposed the ban. Nice started using the Royal Eagle from Africa at the start of the season when they moved into their new stadium. ""The competition committee told us Thursday that they were withdrawing permission given at the start of the season for this pre-match event, because they say the eagle is dangerous,"" said Nice director general Julien Fournier. ""We have decided not to conform to this decision which is questionable in every way. We will appeal,"" the official added. The club vowed that the eagle will be seen at the two last home games this season. The eagle flies around the stadium before each home game and then returns to the arm of its falconer in the middle of the pitch. It has become hugely popular and Nice fans and school children are choosing a name for the bird. Before a recent league game against Paris St Germain however the eagle was made nervous by the capacity crowd and hid in the stadium roof. In a French Cup game against Monaco in February, the eagle perched on the crossbar. The eagle is part of the Nice coat of arms and deputy mayor Christian Estrosi said the French league's decision had caused ""incomprehension"" in the city. He called on the French league to drop the ban, insisting that the eagle was no danger as it was fed by its keeper. Portugal's most famous club Benfica also have an eagle displayed before each game and Fournier said there had been no incident. The eagle did Nice no good on Saturday, they lost 2-1 to Lorient."
