0,16/01/2021,23:19,PSG beat Angers to go top of Ligue 1 without Pochettino,A rare Layvin Kurzawa goal was enough for Paris Saint-Germain to beat Angers 1-0 on Saturday and go top of Ligue 1 despite coach Mauricio Pochettino testing positive for Covid-19 before the game.,"Kurzawa scored with 20 minutes left at the Stade Raymond Kopa to send PSG provisionally two points clear of Lyon, who will have the chance to reclaim first place when they host Metz on Sunday. Assistants Jesus Perez and Miguel D'Agostino took charge of the PSG side with Pochettino having to self-isolate after the announcement on Friday that he had contracted the virus. The Argentine's positive test followed those of three Paris players -- Brazilian Rafinha, Germany's Thilo Kehrer and French Under-21 international Colin Dagba -- in the last week. However, Neymar made his return to the starting line-up in Angers for the first time since suffering an ankle injury in a defeat to Lyon a month ago. With Kylian Mbappe and Angel di Maria also starting behind Moise Kean in attack, it was a strong Parisian line-up but they appeared to play within themselves against an Angers side who sit seventh. The home team even almost went ahead early in the second half when a Lois Diony diving header from close range was well saved by Keylor Navas. Stephane Bahoken also saw an attempt deflected over before PSG broke through in the 70th minute. Alessandro Florenzi's cross from the right was inadvertently helped on by Angers defender Romain Thomas for Kurzawa, arriving from left-back, to score his first goal in almost a year with a first-time cushioned volley at the back post. It was a third win in four games for PSG since former Tottenham Hotspur coach Pochettino was appointed two weeks ago. He won his maiden trophy in midweek when the reigning Ligue 1 champions beat Marseille 2-1 to claim the Champions Trophy, the French equivalent of a Super Cup. Before Lyon play on Sunday night, third-placed Lille can also go level on points again with PSG if they beat Reims. Meaanwhile Marseille's hopes of staying in the title race were dealt another blow earlier on Saturday as Florian Thauvin missed a penalty in a shock 2-1 home defeat by struggling Nimes. France World Cup winner Thauvin sent a woeful spot-kick wide in the first half and Swedish winger Niclas Eliasson then converted twice from close range after the break to give the away side an unassailable lead behind closed doors at the Velodrome. Argentine forward Dario Benedetto pulled one back late on for Andre Villas-Boas's side but this result left them with just one win in six Ligue 1 games. Marseille are sixth in the league, now 10 points behind leaders PSG, albeit still with two games in hand. ""We risk losing touch with the teams at the top, who are more consistent than us,"" said Villas-Boas. ""We were very bad and we paid an expensive price for it. We can't go from playing well against Paris to a miserable match like today."" Nimes move off the foot of the table after their first win in nine, but they remain in the bottom three. The two sides below them, Lorient and Dijon, had their clash set for Sunday postponed after a Covid-19 outbreak at the Brittany club."
1,23/10/2020,23:02,Rennes lose to Angers as fans try to beat curfew record,"Rennes sent 5,000 fans racing home to beat a curfew on Friday ruing another wasted lead after their team lost 2-1 at home to Angers in Ligue 1.","A spike in Covid-19 cases in the region brought the introduction of a curfew from midnight on Friday. That gave fans barely an hour to get home after the match or risk a 135-euro ($160) fine. Rennes could have moved to the top of Ligue 1 with a victory, instead, they suffered their first defeat of the season as, for the fourth time in four games, they blew a lead. This time they did not even gain a draw. The home team started well. After 18 minutes, Paul Bernadoni, Angers record signing, failed to hold a tame volley from Flavien Tait. Adrien Hunou pounced on the loose ball to slide it in from close range. Angers quickly hit back. In the 27th minute, former Southampton player Sofiane Boufal's shot from the edge of the box took a small deflection off Steven Nzonzi and a bigger one off Damien Da Silva before flying past Alfred Gomis. In the 57th minute, Angelo Fulgini chasing a long punt forward wriggled past Da Siva and stretched out a toe to lob the ball over Gomis to give Angers the lead. Almost at once, Gomis atoned with a spectacular save from a point-blank Boufal header. The victory lifted Angers into the top six. ""For us, it's an exploit,"" said Angers coach Stephane Moulin adding that the Champions League had taken a toll on Rennes. ""They used a lot of energy on Tuesday evening."" Angers had conceded 10 goals over their last two away games. ""We had to close the floodgates and I liked the way we did it,"" said Moulin Rennes manager Julien Stephan made five changes to the starting lineup from the club's Champions League debut against Krasnodar on Tuesday when they squandered a lead and drew 1-1 at home. ""I'm disappointed with our match, with the two faces we showed,"" said Stephan. ""We know it's difficult to play every three days but we fought like hell last season to get the chance to play these matches one after the other."" In that European match, the Rennes ultras, many without masks, had grouped behind the goal and celebrated together when their team took the lead. On Friday, UEFA announced it had opened a disciplinary investigation against Rennes for violating its health protocol and failing to ""maintain social distancing"". For the game against Angers, the club again allowed 5,000 spectators to attend, insisting it would enforce stricter distancing rules and enforce a four-seat gap between them. ""We asked them to distribute these 5,000 spectators in the four stands"", said the prefect of Brittany, Michele Kirry. As they watched their team lose to Angers, the fans were carefully spaced around the stadium, which might have also made it easier for them to rush for the exits at the final whistle as the match ended just over an hour before the curfew started. ""The curfew order only comes into force at midnight tonight,"" said Kirry. ""It's very complicated to cancel things on the day they are scheduled."""
2,02/10/2020,23:30,Neymar bags brace as PSG hit six,Neymar scored twice for Paris Saint-Germain in a crushing 6-1 win over Angers on Friday as the French champions continue to build up momentum following a poor start to the Ligue 1 season.,"Alessandro Florenzi, Julian Draxler, Idrissa Gana Gueye and Kylian Mbappe were also on target at the Parc des Princes for PSG, who claimed their fourth consecutive victory after starting the campaign with two straight defeats. Thomas Tuchel's side move up to second in the early table, a point behind leaders Rennes who play Reims on Sunday. There were only 1,000 spectators allowed into the Parc des Princes as authorities clamp down on gatherings amid a new rise in coronavirus cases in the French capital, but the few who were there saw Florenzi open the scoring with a lovely goal in the seventh minute. The Italian right-back, who remains PSG's only new face for this season so far after joining on loan from Roma, controlled the ball in the box before netting with a delightful volley into the far corner. Mbappe then cut the ball back for Neymar to score in off the underside of the bar as PSG doubled their lead before half-time. Neymar was starting after avoiding punishment following allegations of racist and homophobic abuse in an ill-tempered defeat by Marseille last month. The French league's disciplinary committee ruled on Wednesday that it did not have sufficient proof to take action against the Brazilian or Marseille defender Alvaro Gonzalez, who Neymar had accused of calling him a ""monkey"". The world's most expensive player scored his second and PSG's third goal on the night just after half-time, finishing first-time as the ball broke to him in the box. The goals were his first two of the new season after a start to the campaign disrupted by a positive Covid-19 test and suspension. Ismael Traore soon pulled one back for Angers with a back-post header, but Mitchel Bakker crossed for Draxler to make it 4-1 and Gueye added another with a deflected strike. Mbappe completed the scoring by converting from a Pablo Sarabia assist six minutes from the end, and PSG look to have definitively put their defeat by Bayern Munich in the Champions League final in August behind them. Coach Tuchel will now hope to see more new faces arrive before Monday's transfer deadline, with a busy schedule lying in store once the Champions League group stage begins later in October. Paris will start their continental campaign at home to Manchester United on October 20."
3,02/03/2020,12:30,African players in Europe: Sarr sparkles as Watford stun Liverpool,Ismaila Sarr overshadowed fellow Senegalese Sadio Mane by scoring twice as lowly Watford won 3-0 to end the 44-match unbeaten Premier League streak of runaway leaders Liverpool.,"Mane has been among the key figures as the Reds march toward a first league title in three decades, but he had to take a back seat at Vicarage Road as Sarr blossomed. His pace and trickery unsettled Liverpool and he was rewarded with two goals before setting up Troy Deeney for the third. ISMAILA SARR (Watford) The Hornets' record signing was up against his idol Mane and stabbed home the opener at the near post and then showed his pace and poise to chip Alisson Becker for Watford's second. Sarr then turned provider for the third as he teed up Deeney to complete a famous win that lifted Watford out of the bottom three. JORDAN AYEW (Crystal Palace) Ayew scored the only goal as Palace got the better of rivals Brighton to ease any fear of being dragged into a relegation battle. The Ghanaian's strike took his league tally for the season to seven -- matching his best tally for a single campaign in England. MBWANA SAMATTA (Aston Villa) Samatta did Tanzania proud by scoring in the League Cup final against Manchester City, but his diving header at the near post just before half-time was merely a consolation for Villa as City won 2-1 to lift the trophy for a third straight season. YOUSSEF EN-NESYRI (Sevilla) En-Nesyri scored a 93rd-minute winner as Sevilla beat Osasuna 3-2 to move up to third in La Liga. The Moroccan striker, who joined Sevilla from Leganes in January, opened the scoring with a guided shot into the corner before Lucas Ocampos made it two on the stroke of half-time. Osasuna came back in the second half through goals from Aridane and Roberto Torres, only for En-Nesyri to snatch victory for Sevilla in injury-time with a close-range finish. RAMY BENSEBAINI (Borussia Moenchengladbach) Algerian Bensebaini scored a crucial early goal for Moenchengladbach as they beat Augsburg 3-2 to keep pace with the top of the Bundesliga table. Bensebaini, in his first start in 2020 after returning from injury, headed home a cross from Lars Stindl to put the visitors 1-0 up. When asked how it felt to be back in the Foals' line-up after the match, he simply replied ""it was fun"". ACHRAF HAKIMI (Borussia Dortmund) Having made his name as one of Dortmund's best going forward this season, the Real Madrid loanee was called on to do more than his fair share of defending against a stubborn Freiburg side. Working on the edge of a four-man midfield, Hakimi's pace was valuable during the 1-0 win as he snuffed out several Freiburg counter attacks. He did have a shot on goal deflected in the dying stages but was unable to add to his tally of two Bundesliga goals this season. STEPHANE BAHOKEN (Angers) The Cameroon striker was rewarded with a start for his team at Brest after coming off the bench against Montpellier last weekend and scoring the winner a minute later. He delivered again in Brest, although he needed a full 43 minutes to bag the only goal of the match this time. MAX-ALAIN GRADEL (Toulouse) Ivory Coast winger Gradel, 32, returned to the Toulouse starting line-up last weekend for the first time in a Ligue 1 game since early December following injury. He kept his place and wore the captain's armband but could not prevent the division's bottom side from going down 2-0 at home to Rennes. They have now taken just a single point from their last 17 league games and are heading fast towards relegation. KARL TOKO-EKAMBI (Lyon) Cameroon forward Toko-Ekambi, who joined Lyon on loan from Villarreal in January, came off the bench and contributed to their 2-0 win over derby rivals Saint-Etienne. Having earlier had a goal disallowed for offside, he won the late penalty which Moussa Dembele scored to seal the victory. Toko-Ekambi had started the 1-0 Champions League last-16, first leg win over Juventus in midweek and hit the bar in the first half against the Italians."
4,05/02/2020,20:19,French soccer chairman charged with sexual assault: prosecutor,"The chairman of top-flight French football club Angers was charged Wednesday with sexual assault, a prosecutor said Wednesday, in the latest scandal to rock sports in the country.","Three employees and one former employee filed complaints against 55-year-old Said Chabane, who was detained for questioning earlier in the day, prosecutor Eric Bouillard said. Chabane was charged with sexual assault by ""a person who abuses the authority conferred on him by his role,"" Bouillard added. The investigation was opened in January after three women -- one an employee of the Ligue 1 side, the other former staffers -- came forward with allegations against the club's chief. A fourth woman, who had been identified by investigators as a potential victim, also filed a complaint on Wednesday. The four were all aged between 20 and 25 at the time of the alleged assaults, which took place between 2014 and 2019, Bouillard said. Some of the women allege they were caressed in a forceful way in intimate areas by Chabane. The club had earlier issued a statement saying Chabane rejected all the allegations against him and would fully cooperate with investigators. ""He will offer the judicial authorities all the elements needed to re-establish the truth and preserve his honour,"" it said. Angers are currently placed 13th in Ligue 1. The case comes as the sport of ice skating in France was rocked by claims from former world championship bronze medallist Sarah Abitbol that she was raped by coach Gilles Beyer from 1990 to 1992, starting when she was just 15 years old. An investigation into those allegations has also been launched. Beyer, 62, has admitted to having had ""intimate"" and ""inappropriate"" relations with Abitbol, and told AFP he was ""sincerely sorry""."
5,25/01/2020,20:37,Marseille's slim title hopes hit by Angers stalemate,"Andre Villas-Boas' Marseille laboured to a tame 0-0 draw at home against Angers on Saturday, handing Paris Saint-Germain the chance to move 10 points clear at the top of Ligue 1.","Second-placed Marseille are seven points adrift of reigning champions PSG, who visit last year's runners-up Lille on Sunday. The hosts rarely threatened against a solid Angers outfit at the Stade Velodrome, but did extend their unbeaten run in all competitions to 12 matches. Villas-Boas defended his side when asked if they rely too much on star Dimitri Payet, who missed the game through suspension. ""With 11 guys behind the ball, where do you want us to go? You need dribbling, winning duels, finding the last pass or goal and Payet does just that,"" said the Portuguese coach. ""But Barcelona are (Lionel) Messi-dependent, Juve are (Cristiano) Ronaldo-dependent. If we are Payet-dependent, I have no problem with that."" Nemanja Radonjic fired narrowly wide for Marseille on the stroke of half-time, while the away side almost snatched a 90th-minute winner when Antonin Bobichon's effort flew over. But Angers failed to muster a single shot on target, with their opponents managing just two. Marseille sit five points clear of Rennes in the race for automatic qualification for next season's Champions League group stage, after the third-placed side were held to a 1-1 draw at Nice on Friday. Elsewhere on Saturday, Monaco slipped to a 3-1 home defeat by Strasbourg to leave new coach Robert Moreno still waiting for a first Ligue 1 win after three matches. The principality club, who drew 3-3 with PSG before being thrashed 4-1 by the champions in former Spain boss Moreno's first two league games, sit 12th in the table and eight points behind Rennes. Montpellier edged out struggling Dijon 2-1 to move into fourth, while former Sunderland winger Wahbi Khazri scored twice in Saint-Etienne's 2-1 win over Nimes."
6,03/12/2019,21:09,"Maja hat-trick hammers Nimes, Marseille close gap",Nigeria international Josh Maja scored a hat-trick as Bordeaux hammered Nimes 6-0 to go third in Ligue 1 as Andre Villas-Boas' second-placed Marseille moved within two points of leaders Paris Saint-Germain on Tuesday with a 2-0 victory at Angers.,"London-born Maja, 20, who joined the French club from Sunderland in January, netted three times in half an hour in a game delayed for 25 minutes as more than 20 Bordeaux fans invaded the pitch at the Matmut Stadium. The supporters, who climbed down onto the field after 11 minutes, were targeting club president Frederic Longuepee after being refused from flying a banner calling for his resignation. ""It's an amazing feeling, I don't think it has sunk in yet,"" Maja told broadcasters Canal+. ""Once I get home and speak to my family will I realise what I've done and I'll be really happy,"" he added. Maja, who made his debut for the Super Eagles in October's friendly draw with Ukraine, claimed his first after 24 minutes and added a second to double his tally for the season 13 minutes later. He saved his best finish for this third effort firing high above Paul Bernardoni eight minutes into the second half for his first hat-trick in senior football. Nicolas De Preville and a double from Brazilian midfielder Otavio made sure of all three points moving Paulo Sousa's side up to third in the table, five points behind Marseille. Midfielder Dimitri Payet was involved in both goals at Angers, setting up Morgan Sanson for the opener before converting from the penalty spot as Andre Villas-Boas' side extended their unbeaten run to five. ""PSG's position doesn't occupy our minds, our goal is to finish second at the end of the season,"" Villas-Boas said. ""If we can beat Bordeaux on Sunday it can allow for a bit of a gap on other teams before the Christmas break,"" he added. The Portuguese boss kept faith with the side which beat Brest 2-1 on Friday electing against giving match-winner Nemanja Radonjic a spot in the starting lineup. Angers boss Stephane Moulin made five changes from the weekend's loss to Nice as Ismail Traore took over the captaincy from Thomas Mangani. Villas-Boas' men claimed the lead after 17 minutes as Sanson registered his second goal in four league games. Payet played his free-kick quickly to find midfielder Sanson who side-footed cooly past Ludovic Butelle. The former West Ham playmaker doubled the advantage after 41 minutes slotting his third penalty of the season. Japan right-back Hiroki Sakai was tripped up in the Angers box and the France attacker scored his fifth goal of the season. Marseille held on during the second half to move on to 31 points, with PSG, who have played two games fewer, on 33. Elsewhere, Italian Cristian Battocchio scored a hat-trick as Brest moved up to 12th spot with a 5-0 hammering of Strasbourg. And Lyon lost 1-0 at home to Lille after defensive errors enabled Jonathan Ikone to grab the decisive goal. On Wednesday PSG can restore their five-point lead over Marseille as they welcome Nantes, who have recovered from a run of four straight defeats, to the French capital."
7,05/10/2019,20:56,Icardi scores first Ligue 1 goal as PSG cruise past Angers,Mauro Icardi scored his first Ligue 1 goal as Paris Saint-Germain moved five points clear at the top of the table with a 4-0 thrashing of high-flying Angers on Saturday.,"The reigning champions had suffered a shock 2-0 loss in their previous home game against Reims, but had no such trouble at the Parc des Princes on this occasion despite their opponents' surprisingly strong start to the season. PSG head into the international break totally in control of the title race, although Nantes, who leapfrogged Angers into second on goal difference, could cut the gap to two points when they host Nice later on Saturday. ""It's a good end to this period for us, and with a clean sheet, that's good,"" said Paris coach Thomas Tuchel, who saw three of his recent signings score as Pablo Sarabia and Idrissa Gueye also found the net. ""With the recruits, we have gained personality and experience. We are more reliable."" Neymar's late strike rounded off a strong individual display as he continued to repair his relationship with the team's fans after failing in his effort to force through a return to Barcelona. ""It (the situation) is better, it's easier,"" said Tuchel of Neymar. ""It's up to him to show that he is decisive, that he gives everything. ""He is suffering and working for us. It's not necessary to talk... He scored another goal today, he did a lot of dribbling, decisive things. ""He is capable of doing more extraordinary things, and it's to him to show them."" Tuchel opted to rest Angel Di Maria, as on-loan Inter Milan striker Icardi was rewarded for his first PSG goal in midweek at Galatasaray with a full Ligue 1 debut. The capital city club remained without the injured Edinson Cavani, while Kylian Mbappe missed out after suffering a setback in his recovery from a thigh problem. But the first opportunity fell to in-form Angers forward Rachid Alioui, although the Algerian dallied on the ball and home goalkeeper Keylor Navas was able to save with his foot. The hosts took the lead in the 13th minute, though, as Ander Herrera played in Sarabia, who cut inside and wrong-footed Ludovic Butelle in the Angers goal to net for the first time since joining PSG from Sevilla in the close-season. The visitors continued to threaten on the counter-attack, with Navas having to beat away Baptiste Santamaria's long-range drive. The game was all but ended as a contest eight minutes before the break, as Neymar and Sarabia combined to give Icardi the simplest of tasks to fire into the roof of the net. Although Spain international Sarabia scuffed a rebound after his initial shot was cleared off the line just before the hour mark, former Everton midfielder Gueye was on hand to tap in his first PSG goal. But there was little respite for Angers, as Neymar launched a one-man mission in his attempt to get on the scoresheet. The Brazilian was twice denied by Butelle in quick succession, before the goalkeeper produced a brilliant save with his legs when the world's most expensive player was clean through on goal. Neymar eventually found a way past Butelle in the final minute, rounding the 'keeper and slotting into an empty net to complete a straightforward outing for PSG with his fourth goal of the campaign."
8,13/09/2019,21:14,Nigeria's Osimhen scores again as Lille beat Angers,Nigerian youngster Victor Osimhen scored his fifth Ligue 1 goal of the season as Lille claimed a 2-1 win over Angers on Friday.,"The 20-year-old Osimhen netted the opener six minutes before half-time to move clear of Lyon's Memphis Depay at the top of the early goalscoring charts in France. Luiz Araujo's fine individual strike in the 53rd minute doubled the lead for last season's runners-up, who held on to take their third victory of the new campaign despite a late goal from Angers forward Stephane Bahoken. Osimhen, who scored doubles in previous home victories over Saint-Etienne and Nantes, took advantage of a dreadful error by visiting goalkeeper Ludovic Butelle to grab his goal. Lille are now third in the fledgling table, level on points with leaders Paris Saint-Germain and second-placed Rennes. Lyon could overtake them, though, when they visit Amiens later on Friday. Reigning champions PSG could see Neymar feature for the first time this term after his long transfer saga when they host Strasbourg on Saturday."
9,16/08/2019,22:45,"Depay, Dembele at the double as Lyon hammer Angers",Lyon forwards Memphis Depay and Moussa Dembele both scored twice to guide their side to a 6-0 drubbing of Angers in France's Ligue 1 on Friday.,"Midfielder Houssem Aouar and new face Jean Lucas also helped coach Sylvinho and sporting director Juninho to continue the perfect start to their tenures. A large banner behind one goal carrying Brazilian Juninho's face was unveiled pre-match as the former playmaker made his return to the club where he won numerous league titles more than a decade ago. The two sides faced each other less than 48 hours after Jeff Reine-Adelaide completed a club record 25 million euros ($27.7 million) move from Angers to Lyon. The midfielder's new employers took an early lead through Aouar's 11th minute effort. The 21-year-old Lyon academy product intercepted a sloppy Romain Thomas pass before charging forward and beating goalkeeper Ludovic Butelle. Their second goal arrived on the 36-minute mark as Dembele made the most of a lucky ricochet. Lucas Tousart's attempted pass was deflected onto Dembele's path inside the Angers box and the former Celtic forward held-off the back-tracking Mateo Pavlovic to shoot past Butelle's right hand. Depay's double came in a seven-minute spell either side of half-time. Aouar became the provider setting up Depay for both, the second a deft lob before the Dutch international cooly finished despite VAR checking an off-the-ball collision between Dembele and right-back Vincent Maneau. Dembele claimed his second with 25 minutes remaining as Pavlovic was once again caught out after attempting to intercept Depay's pass. The France youth international picked up the loose ball and slotted easily past a hapless Butelle. The rout was confirmed with 18 minutes to go as substitute Jean Lucas scored his first goal for the club since joining from Flamengo during the summer. On Saturday, Andre Villas-Boas takes his Marseille team to Nantes looking for an improvement after losing his first league game in charge last weekend. On Sunday the saga of Neymar's possible departure overshadows champions Paris Saint-Germain's trip to Rennes in a replay of last season's French Cup final when the Brazil forward was banned for three games after an altercation with a fan."
10,11/05/2019,19:14,Neymar scores on final PSG game before ban,Neymar responded to being handed a three-match ban by scoring as champions Paris Saint-Germain ended their three-game losing streak away from home with a 2-1 Ligue 1 victory at Angers on Saturday.,"Thomas Tuchel's PSG have seen their season fizzle out since a shock Champions League exit at the hands of Manchester United in March, losing the French Cup final and embarking on a run of just one win in seven matches. The return of Neymar from a foot problem has been a plus, with the world's most expensive player finding form ahead of his Copa America campaign with Brazil, which starts next month. The 27-year-old's suspension for lashing out at a fan following PSG's penalty-shootout loss to Rennes in the French Cup final comes into effect on Monday, while he will also miss three Champions League games at the start of next season for criticising the referee after the Man United defeat. But he scored his third goal in four games on his final appearance of the season to give PSG a 20th-minute lead at the Stade Raymond-Kopa, diving to head home Dani Alves' scooped pass. And Neymar turned provider as Angel Di Maria nodded in at the back post just before the hour mark to double the visitors' advantage. But PSG have conceded 18 goals in eight games, failing to keep a clean sheet, after Flavien Tait grabbed a late consolation for midtable Angers, tapping in the rebound after Gianluigi Buffon had saved his penalty. The French giants will now hope to ensure that the underwhelming win does not prove to be Neymar's final match for the club, ahead of the start of the transfer window next month. Later on Saturday, 17th-placed Monaco will look to edge closer to safety as they visit Nimes, before Champions League-chasing Lyon face Marseille on Sunday."
11,19/04/2019,22:56,Depay helps Lyon end winless streak,Memphis Depay helped Lyon defeat Angers 2-1 in Ligue 1 on Friday to end a three match winless run and maintain their push for Champions League football next season.,"First half goals from the Dutch international and Martin Terrier saw Lyon consolidate their hold on third place on 59 points, six clear of fourth-placed Saint-Etienne. But not before they suffered a late scare when Lucas Tousart sent the ball into his own net just minutes after coming on after a poor clearance from Lyon keeper Anthony Lopes. This was Lyon's first outing since coach Bruno Genesio announced his departure at the end of the season. That came in the aftermath of last week's Ligue 1 defeat to struggling Nantes with the former multiple French champions also knocked out of the Champions League and French Cup in just over a month. Depay put Lyon in front on 14 minutes, Houssem Aouar providing the long assist. Outsprinting Angers defender Mateo Pavlovic the former Manchester United star's angled shot had keeper Ludovic Butelle foxed. The 25-year-old striker almost added to that tally minutes later only for his shot to be deflected off Butelle's near post. As half-time approached Terrier wrong-footed Butelle to double Lyon's advantage after another counter-attack with Aouar once again providing the decisive pass. Earlier Rennes, who face Paris Saint-Germain in next weekend's French Cup final, lost 3-2 at Dijon. PSG can wrap up the Ligue 1 title on Sunday when they host Monaco, and will be crowned champions before that match if second-placed Lille fail to win at Toulouse."
12,29/03/2019,03:00,Balotelli and Marseille readying Champions League charge,Marseille host Angers on Saturday with the Mediterranean side's late season push for Europe energised by the goals and all-round contribution of Italian striker Mario Balotelli.,"Fourth placed Marseille lost 3-1 at bitter rivals Paris Saint-Germain before the international break, but with five Balotelli goals in eight appearances since his January switch from Nice the club is in upbeat mood. The often controversial striker looks to be thriving in the glare of Marseille's often comic, soap-opera like atmosphere. ""We can count him in our number,"" said club president Jacques-Henri Eyraud. Coach Rudi Garcia agrees, saying: ""when we are down and under pressure, you can always find him, he can hold up the ball and get everyone going again."" Former OM idol Didier Drogba admitted last week he told Balotelli a stint at Marseille would be good for him. ""Grab your chance. Go for it. It's a club that'll do you good,"" Drogba said he told the 28-year-old. The striker will be well rested after Roberto Mancini left him out of Italy's squad for recent Euro 2020 qualifiers, saying he was unfit, causing him to write on Instagram that he was ""tired"" of being underestimated -- ominously for Angers. Club owner Frank McCourt has launched a 'Champions Project' to get Marseille back in the Champions League, and his team now sit six points adrift of that target with nine matches remaining. ""We are more than satisfied with the way he has fitted in and with his contribution on the pitch,"" Eyraud says of the part Balotelli has played. Marseille's direct rival for the final Champions League spot is Lyon, who sit in third and warm up for next week's French Cup semi-final with Rennes by travelling to take on the same team on Friday missing several key players. Goalkeeper Anthony Lopes is back after suffering both concussion and a mental battering in a 5-1 Champions League defeat at Barcelona. But defender Ferland Mendy is still out with a calf strain from that Barca bruiser while striker Maxwel Cornet and Dutch defender Kenny Tete are also in the Lyon sick bay. Hatem Ben Arfa's Rennes, eliminated by Arsenal in the Europa League two weeks ago, have three players suspended but go into the match on good form and with a solid home record. Twenty points clear atop Ligue 1, defending champions PSG travel to Toulouse on Sunday ahead of their own French Cup semi-final with Nantes. Toulouse have won just one of their last five games and face Ligue 1 top scorer Kylian Mbappe's growing prowess as a lone striker in the absence of injured Neymar and Edinson Cavani and a PSG side with seven straight league wins under their belts. Emiliano Sala's former club Nantes host second-placed Lille with the Atlantic coast outfit learning this week that Cardiff have declared the deceased striker's transfer null and void. Sala remains Nantes' top scorer on 12 with two others Gabriel Boschilia and Majeed Waris on just four apiece. But the 2001 French champions are 10 points ahead of the drop zone -- and nine away from the relegation play-off spot -- and seasoned coach Vahid Halilhodzic appears to have got the Canaries focused again after the shock of the death of their former teammate. Lille, who won the French league themselves as recently as 2011, were beaten last time out by resurgent Monaco and will be keen to win with Lyon closing the gap behind them in third.

PSG coach Thomas Tuchel can also go on holiday relaxed with his club on 47 points, as second-placed Lille, 13 points adrift, lost 2-1 at home to Toulouse. ""I'm very happy because we can see the progress of the team,"" said Tuchel. ""You can feel the energy, it's a good thing to build on next year."" With Neymar away, Angel Di Maria was in the line-up and came closest to making it 2-0, forcing a fine save from Nantes goalkeeper Ciprian Tatarusanu, who then watched the Argentine hit the crossbar from the rebound. Meanwhile, third-placed Lyon drew 1-1 at fourth-placed Montpellier after opening the scoring thanks to their captain Nabil Fekir before a great header from Ruben Aguilar gave the surprise-package southerners a share of the spoils. Henry's Monaco were dreadful and the former Arsenal striker spat on the ground after Nolan Roux of Guingamp made fools of the Monaco defence to make it 2-0. ""I'm not going to have a good holiday,"" bemoaned Henry. ""Now you have to work and make do with what you have. ""It's necessary to work and work. There are still a lot of points to play for and that's the only positive thing about this evening."" Monaco were champions in 2017 but now have 13 points from 18 matches, just two more than Guingamp, and vice-president Vadim Vasilyev said the club needs to dip into the January transfer market. ""Until tonight, I thought we didn't need new players, but we do,"" Vasilyev told Canal+. ""It's difficult to analyse right now as I'm upset like the supporters. I understand the disappointment, it's up to us to act and draw the right conclusions."" Strasbourg paid hommage to the victims of a terror attack that killed five people on December 11 in their first home game since as they won 2-0 against Nice. Meanwhile, Marseille, in sixth, drew 1-1 at Angers and fifth-placed Saint-Etienne beat Dijon 3-0."
14,26/09/2018,16:51,Monaco coach Jardim up for the fight despite poor start to season,Monaco coach Leonardo Jardim insists he will not walk away from the club after their dreadful start to the season continued on Tuesday.,"The principality side slumped to a 1-0 home defeat against Angers, leaving the 2017 champions without a win in six league matches since beating Nantes on the opening weekend of the campaign. The Angers defeat was played out in front of a sparse crowd of just 5,502 at the Stade Louis II, but the home fans who did turn out booed their team off, and Monaco are languishing in 16th place in Ligue 1. ""This is my fifth year in Monaco, but I think I am still getting my message across,"" said Jardim on Wednesday, after seeing his team fail to muster a shot on target against Angers. ""We are going through a difficult time, but there have been others, like in my first year when we had a very difficult start but managed to lift ourselves and bounce back."" Monaco again lost a host of key players in the close season, as has become customary at a club whose business model is centred around investing in talented youngsters who are then sold on at a profit. The list of those who have left since Monaco's title triumph last year, when they also reached the Champions League semi-finals, is remarkable. Kylian Mbappe, Benjamin Mendy, Fabinho, Joao Moutinho, Bernardo Silva, Tiemoue Bakayoko, Thomas Lemar and Valere Germain -- all regulars in that side -- have been sold. Against Angers, the only key members of the title-winning team to feature were skipper Radamel Falcao and the defensive trio of Jemerson, Kamil Glik and Djibril Sidibe. Meanwhile, a summer spending spree headed by the signing of Russian World Cup star Aleksandr Golovin has not yet produced positive results for a club owned by Russian billionaire Dmitry Rybolovlev. Monaco play Saint-Etienne this weekend and Jardim added: ""The expectations at Monaco are high, as they are for the new signings. ""Everyone knows the context at Monaco. We don't have 50,000 people in the stadium insulting the players, or 300 coming to the training ground and smashing in cars, but we need to be aware of what we represent."" It is all very dispiriting for the highly-regarded Jardim, but he says he is up for the fight. ""I have a year left on my contract. I have always respected my contract,"" said the 44-year-old. ""I have had opportunities to leave but chose to stay. I am not going to escape now."" Monaco also lost to Atletico Madrid in their opening Champions League match and their hopes of progressing to the last 16 may depend on picking up a positive result at Borussia Dortmund next week. Meanwhile, if challenging Paris Saint-Germain for the title was never a realistic objective, it will still be galling that they can find themselves 15 points behind the capital side on Wednesday evening, should Thomas Tuchel's team beat Reims. cb-as/pb <org>BORUSSIA DORTMUND</org>"
15,24/08/2018,22:58,Fekir returns as Lyon brush aside Strasbourg,Nabil Fekir made his first appearance of the new season as Lyon bounced back from last week's surprise loss to Reims by seeing off Strasbourg 2-0 in Ligue 1 on Friday.,"Bruno Genesio's men eased to their second victory from as many league home matches this term thanks to goals from Martin Terrier and Bertrand Traore, while Fekir, who saw a move to Liverpool fall through in the close season, played the last 11 minutes. The home side took the lead shortly before half-time as full-back Ferland Mendy slipped through an inch-perfect pass for Terrier, who spent last season on loan at Strasbourg, to curl into the bottom corner. Former Chelsea forward Traore wrapped up the win in style with a fantastic individual goal in the 64th minute, latching onto Memphis Depay's ball before dribbling past visiting goalkeeper Matz Sels and a backtracking defender to slot in. Fekir missed the first two games of the season after returning late from the World Cup, where he made six substitute appearances in France's triumphant campaign. Lyon, who finished third last season to qualify for the Champions League group stage, have now won their last eight home Ligue 1 matches. Reigning champions Paris Saint-Germain welcome Angers to the Parc des Princes on Saturday, when new coach Thomas Tuchel could field forwards Edinson Cavani, Neymar and Kylian Mbappe together for the first time."
16,30/04/2018,13:26,Rare blank for Salah as Nigerian 'Simy' bags brace,"Prolific Liverpool scorer Mohamed Salah had a rare goalless outing at the weekend, leaving little unknown Nigerian 'Simy' to star among Africans in Europe with a Serie A brace.","Egyptian Salah failed to score in an English Premier League match at Anfield for the first time since December as lowly Stoke City greatly exceeded expectations to force a 0-0 draw. In Italy, 'Simy' struck twice to help Crotone whip higher-placed Sassuolo 4-1 and climb three points above the danger zone. MOHAMED SALAH (Liverpool) In a season where he has already scored a remarkable 31 Premier League goals, to suggest the Egypt forward might miss a relatively straightforward chance was to invite ridicule. Yet that is what happened to Salah during Liverpool's goalless draw at home to Stoke -- the first time since a match against Swansea on December 26 last year that Salah has not scored on home turf in the Premier League. He had Liverpool's best chance when, in the fifth minute, he clipped the ball over Stoke goalkeeper Jack Butland only for his shot to miss the target. Proof he is fallible after all. WILFRIED ZAHA (Crystal Palace) The Ivory Coast forward was in superb form as Palace thrashed Leicester 5-0 to all but assure themselves of top-flight survival. He crowned a brilliant passing move to open the scoring in the 17th minute, then set up the second goal for James McArthur before drawing a foul which resulted in Marc Albrighton being sent off. IDRISSA GUEYE (Everton) Best known as a defensive midfielder, the Senegal international scored his first goal of 2018 when he drilled in a shot 13 minutes from time to secure Everton's 2-0 win at Huddersfield. The goal capped an impressive display where Gueye's industry was equalled by his eye for a pass. AMATH NDIAYE DIEDHIOU (Getafe) The young Senegalese put his club ahead midway through the first half of a 1-1 home draw against Girona. Both clubs are challenging for 2018/2019 Europa League places. KALIDOU KOULIBALY (Napoli) Senegal defender Koulibaly, a hero just a week ago when he scored the last-gasp header that kept Napoli's title ambitions alive with a 1-0 win over Juventus in Turin, turned villain in Florence when he was sent off after just eight minutes. Ten-man Napoli crumbled to a 3-0 defeat against Fiorentina that leaves their title challenge in tatters. Second-placed Napoli are four points behind champions Juventus with just three games left. 'SIMY' (Crotone) Nigerian forward Simeon 'Simy' Tochukwu Nwankwo grabbed a brace as Crotone moved away from the relegation zone with a 4-1 win over Sassuolo. The 25-year-old nodded in the first off a corner after quarter of an hour and added a second in the final minute in Calabria. It was the third consecutive game that 'Simy' has scored in for the southerners. MUSA BARROW (Atalanta) Gambian forward Barrow, 19, scored the opening goal after 16 minutes as Atalanta continued their push for Europa League football next season with a 3-1 win over Genoa, which extended their unbeaten run to eight games. It was the second goal with the senior team for Barrow. NABIL BENTALEB (Schalke 04) The Algeria midfielder lasted just 13 minutes of second-place Schalke's 1-1 draw at home to Borussia Moenchengladbach before being sent off. He was shown a straight red card for pushing Lars Stindl in the face. NABY KEITA (RB Leipzig) Liverpool-bound Keita earned his fourth red card of the season after two bookings in quick succession at the end of Leipzig's 3-0 defeat at Mainz. Keita saw red for fouling Mainz scorers Alexandru Maxim and Bote Baku, which was ""completely unnecessary"", said Leipzig captain Willi Orban. Keita has now been sent off three times for Leipzig and once for Guinea in the 2017/18 season. ISMAIL TRAORE (Angers) The France-born Ivory Coast defender produced a late leveller to earn Angers a 1-1 draw against Europa League semi-finalists Marseille, the stalemate putting the breaks on the southern giants' bid for Champions League football next season. Florian Thauvin's third-minute penalty looked to have secured Marseille the three points until Traore's header in the 79th minute. The 31-year-old rose highest at the back post to meet Flavien Tait's free-kick from deep on the left and fire a header past a rooted Yohann Pele and into the bottom corner for his third goal of the season."
17,29/04/2018,23:15,"Draw dents Marseille Euro bid, Cavani sets PSG record with rescue act",A late leveller from Ismael Traore put the brakes on Marseille's bid for Champions League football next season as the southern giants were held to a 1-1 draw at Angers on Sunday.,"Marseille travelled west hoping to move into the Ligue 1 top three after Monaco were held to a scoreless draw at home to Amiens on Saturday as Lyon took second by beating Nantes. Paris Saint-Germain, who battled back from two goals down to draw 2-2 with Guingamp on Sunday, wrapped up the title with plenty of room to spare two weeks ago. On paper, three points were well within Marseille's grasp. Coach Rudi Garcia certainly appeared to believe so as he left both Dimitri Payet and Kostas Mitroglou on the bench ahead of Thursday's Europa League semi-final second leg at Salzburg. But despite a third-minute penalty from Florian Thauvin, misfiring Angers finally got back on level terms thanks to Traore's header from a free-kick on 79 minutes. Marseille remain fourth, one point behind Monaco in the third and last Champions League qualifying position. But Garcia remained confident that Marseille will reach their objectives both at home and in Europe. ""We've dropped two points, which is a regret because we're approaching the end of the season,"" he said. ""But we still have three matches to play, and Monaco also dropped points. It's not over yet."" He added: ""Now, we'll turn our focus to the Europa League and do everything we can to make the final. Then we host Nice (in Ligue 1) and we'll start our bid to move up one or two places in the table. ""Everything is possible."" After Monaco's slip-up, motivation should not have been an issue for Marseille at the Raymond Kopa stadium. But Garcia's men struggled to build on the early lead provided by Thauvin after Abdoulaye Bamba had fouled Valere Germain during the first corner of the game. In wet and slippery conditions both keepers were kept on their toes. Marseille shot-stopper Yohann Pele produced a great one-handed save to thwart Flavien Tait from a tight angle minutes before the interval. But Ludovic Butelle was the busiest of the pair, the 35-year-old forced into action quickly after the restart to charge down Jordan Amavi's angled strike before palming a wicked curling effort from Thauvin over the bar moments later. The greasy pitch made for a scrappy affair with passes, and shots, going astray. But not even those challenges were an excuse for Angers missing a golden chance to level on 70 minutes. Karl Toko Ekambi's run through the middle into the area saw the ball stop dead, with Pele stranded. Yet, faced with an empty goal, Thomas Mangani sent his effort high over the bar from 16 yards out. But the home fans were finally given reason to celebrate when Traore rose highest at the back post to meet Tait's free-kick from deep on the left and fire a header past a rooted Pele and into the bottom corner. Champions PSG needed two goals from Uruguayan striker Edinson Cavani to rescue a point at home to mid-table Guingamp. Ludovic Blas and Jimmy Briand had put Guingamp on course for a shock win at the Parc des Princes before Cavani became his club's all-time Ligue 1 top scorer with a 75th-minute penalty and leveller seven minutes from time. The brace took Cavani's career total to 115 goals in the French top flight. Rennes boosted their hopes of fighting for a Europa League place with a precious 2-1 win over Toulouse that pushed the Brittany side up one place to sixth. They are now just one point behind fifth-placed Saint-Etienne."
18,14/03/2018,19:19,Mbappe double keeps PSG perfect at home,Kylian Mbappe grabbed both goals as runaway leaders Paris Saint-Germain defeated Angers 2-1 in Ligue 1 on Wednesday despite losing veteran midfielder Thiago Motta to an early red card.,"The 19-year-old France international struck either side of Motta's 16th-minute dismissal for a crude stamp on Angers defender Romain Thomas at the Parc des Princes. Mbappe confidently swept in a first-time finish on 12 minutes after a brilliant ball in behind the defence by Julian Draxler. The teenager netted his second on 26 minutes after Layvin Kurzawa pulled the ball back from the byline, with Mbappe lifting his league goals tally to 13 for the season. With his team just four points above the relegation zone, Angers coach Stephane Moulin had made no secret of prioritising Saturday's home game against Caen over the trip to the capital. That approach was underpinned by the decision to leave top scorer Karl Toko Ekambi on the bench in Paris, although the Cameroonian bagged his 15th goal of the campaign after coming on with half an hour to play. Mbappe nearly completed his hat-trick with seven minutes remaining but his effort smacked back off the post, while PSG goalkeeper Kevin Trapp denied Toko Ekambi an equaliser right at the end. A 16th successive home league win leaves Unai Emery's side 17 points clear of second-placed Monaco, who face PSG in the League Cup final at the Stade de France on March 31."
19,14/04/2017,23:44,Di Maria sends PSG level with Monaco,Angel Di Maria scored a brace to keep Paris Saint-Germain hot on Ligue 1 leaders Monaco's heels with a 2-0 win at Angers on Friday.,"The Argentina international showed his class with one sublime and another clinical finish as PSG moved level on points at the top of the table. ""We are happy because it was a difficult match at Angers,"" said PSG coach Unai Emery. ""We're content with three points. We were well-prepared, concentrated and worked well."" Monaco can reclaim their three-point advantage with victory at home to relegation threatened Dijon on Saturday but with one eye on next week's Champions League quarter-final second leg against Borussia Dortmund, they could be vulnerable. What's more, Monaco have had one less day to prepare for Saturday's game after their first leg in Germany, which the Principality outfit won 3-2, was postponed 24 hours after a triple bomb blast damaged the home side's team bus and left Spanish defender Marc Bartra with a broken wrist. How much that incident has affected Monaco's already weary players remains to be seen while PSG -- knocked out of Europe themselves in dramatic circumstances in the previous round when Barcelona came back from a 4-0 first leg deficit to triumph 6-5 on aggregate -- have only domestic matters to concentrate on now. Di Maria's first goal was a rare bright spark in an otherwise tight first half, but there was no doubting the quality of the Argentine's placement as he bent a sumptuous free-kick from 25 yards over the defensive wall and beyond the despairing reach of Alexandre Letellier in the Angers goal on 28 minutes. The home side had the ball in the net on 39 minutes through captain Cheikh Ndoye but it was controversially disallowed for a foul by Famara Diedhiou on Serge Aurier when television replays proved inconclusive as to which of the two was the true offender as they wrestled in the area. Ndoye came close again 18 minutes from time when his powerful header appeared destined for the top corner until goalkeeper Kevin Trapp acrobatically tipped the ball over the bar. For a team in mid-table safety, Angers were played with real purpose but lacked the quality to break down a stubborn away defence. And six minutes form time, PSG struck with rapier speed and efficiency on the counter-attack mas Lucas Moura fed Di Maria to slot home his second at the near post, although Letellier's positioning was highly questionable."
20,08/04/2017,19:20,Falcao keeps fortunate Monaco on title track,Radamel Falcao marked his first start in six weeks with the only goal of the game as Monaco cemented their position at the top of Ligue 1 with a 1-0 win at Angers.,"Falcao's goal came just after the hour mark and against the run of play, and Monaco were holding on at the end against in-form opponents at the Stade Raymond Kopa. The result extended the principality side's run without defeat in the league to 13 matches and moved them four points clear at the top of the table with a game in hand on Nice, who won 2-1 at Lille on Friday. Defending champions Paris Saint-Germain -- who hammered Monaco 4-1 in last weekend's League Cup final -- can cut their lead back down to three points if they win at home to Guingamp on Sunday evening. For Monaco it was the perfect preparation for their Champions League quarter-final first leg away to Borussia Dortmund in Germany on Tuesday as they stay on course to win their first French title since Claude Puel's 2000 vintage. This always looked likely to be an awkward trip for Monaco against their fellow French Cup semi-finalists, with Angers unbeaten at home since December. Visiting coach Leonardo Jardim named Falcao in his starting line-up for the first time since late February with the Colombian looking to prove his fitness before the Dortmund clash. Teen sensation Kylian Mbappe made way but Falcao and Monaco offered little going forward in the first half. Indeed they were lucky not to be behind at the interval. Cameroon forward Karl Toko Ekambi pounced on a loose ball just outside the Monaco box only to fire wide, while goalkeeper Danijel Subasic made a crucial intervention in front of Famara Diedhiou. The goal arrived in the 61st minute, Nabil Dirar setting up Falcao for a low right-foot finish from 12 yards for his 17th of the season in the league and his 25th all told. Angers did not deserve to find themselves behind but they passed up a glorious chance to level late on when Thomas Mangani's free-kick was headed on by Nicolas Pepe for Ismael Traore to turn the ball against the far post. Subasic prevented Diedhiou from scoring the follow-up. Mario Balotelli scored both goals for Nice in their win at Lille as they came from behind for the fourth game running and extended their unbeaten run to nine games. Lucien Favre's side are now guaranteed European football next season and Champions League football is a probability with Lyon -- who host Lorient later -- 16 points behind them in fourth."

22,24/09/2016,22:40,Monaco grind out win to go top,"With Radamel Falcao out injured, Monaco came from behind to claim a scrappy 2-1 win over Angers at the Stade Louis II on Saturday and move top of the Ligue 1 table.","Falcao was absent after being hospitalised with a blow to the head in the principality club's 4-0 trouncing at local rivals Nice during the week. And Leonardo Jardim's side struggled to get the better of in-form Angers, a Dickson Nwakaeme own goal proving the difference after Kamil Glik had cancelled out Famara Diedhiou's opener. The result allowed Monaco to go two points clear of Nice, who visit Nancy on Sunday, and Toulouse, conquerors of champions Paris Saint-Germain on Friday. Youngsters Abdou Diallo and Kevin N'Doram started for Monaco with Jardim having one eye on Tuesday's Champions League encounter with Bayer Leverkusen. Angers were chasing a fourth consecutive win and they thought they had taken the lead early in the second half when Karl Toko-Ekambi had the ball in the net but the offside flag cut short the celebrations. However, the visitors did go in front in controversial circumstances in the 56th minute as leggy Cameroon forward Toko-Ekambi slid the ball across goal for Cheikh Ndoye. The Angers captain made a mess of his shot and the ball came up and struck his hand before falling for Diedhiou, who scored. The goal stood despite the appeals for a handball. Nevertheless, Poland defender Glik fired in a 66th-minute equaliser from eight yards after Angers struggled to clear and the hosts secured the points with quarter of an hour left. Mathieu Michel saved from Glik but the ball rebounded off Nigerian substitute Nwakaeme and in. Monaco's eighth win in nine games in all competitions came after Lyon missed the chance to move level on points with stumbling PSG as they lost 1-0 at struggling Lorient. Jimmy Cabot scored the only goal of the game early in the second half in Brittany as Lyon lost for the third time in the league already this season. Bruno Genesio's side, who visit Sevilla in the Champions League this coming midweek, had beaten Montpellier 5-1 on Wednesday but that is now their only win in five Ligue 1 games. ""I am not worried,"" said Genesio, whose side were again without injured leading scorer Alexandre Lacazette and suspended captain Maxime Gonalons, although France midfielder Mathieu Valbuena came in for his first start since April and hit the bar in the first half. ""There is no need to panic after this result. ""I often say that the result is one thing but there is also the performance, whether we win or lose. ""We need to keep calm. It is a shame, because it was a chance to climb the table and I think we deserved better."" Champions PSG slumped to a 2-0 defeat at Toulouse on Friday with Yann Bodiger scoring a penalty and Jimmy Durmaz also netting for the hosts after Serge Aurier had been sent off for the team from the capital. PSG are fourth, three points behind Monaco and level on points with Bordeaux and Metz. Bordeaux were held to a 0-0 draw by Caen while newly-promoted Metz continued their good start to the campaign by winning 1-0 in Montpellier thanks to a Mevlut Erding penalty. Bastia defeated Guingamp 1-0 and Lois Diony scored twice as Dijon beat Rennes 3-0. Lille are bottom of the table before they go to Saint-Etienne on Sunday, with Marseille also in action at home to Nantes."
23,06/02/2016,19:20,"Monaco get Champions League boost, Lyon frustrate Angers",Monaco's hopes of Champions League football next season got a boost with a 1-0 win over Nice on Saturday as Lyon rekindled their European challenge by beating Angers 3-0.,"On a stormy, tense day in Ligue 1, seven players were red-carded in seven games. The Riveria derby clash between the second and third placed teams failed to ignite Monaco's Stade Louis II before midfielder Tiemoue Bakayoko struck after 81 minutes. A long free-kick off the boot of Portuguese midfielder Moutinho found Bakayoko who slotted in after the ball had bounced in front of Nice goalkeeper Yoan Cardinale. The win allows Monaco, second behind runaway leaders Paris Saint-Germain, to move six points clear of Nice, who remain third, two points ahead of Angers with Lyon moving up to fifth a further point back. Monaco's Moroccan midfielder Nabil Dirar was sent off after he vigorously disputed a call by referee Tony Chapron, as Angers were also playing a man down following a 16th minute red card for Thomas Mangani. ""The players showed that apart from PSG, there is no team better than us. We know each other well, we know how to play at 10 and showed this,"" said Monaco coach Leonardo Jardim. ""The players had a great match."" ""Paradoxically, the sending off seemed to do them good,"" said Nice coach Claude Puel. ""If they continue to be successful like that they can even envisage catching Paris,"" added Puel of Monaco who trail Paris Saint-Germain by 21 points. The reigning three-time champions will be looking to extend their Ligue 1 unbeaten streak at bitter rivals Marseille on Sunday. Lyon secured back-to-back league wins for the first time since November and gave new coach Bruno Genesio a first league victory away from home. Last season's runners-up took an early lead through Christophe Jallet, and the hosts fell two behind when winger Rachid Ghezzal picked out the roof of the net just after half-time. Corentin Tolisso wrapped up the scoring late on as Lyon moved to within three points of the Champions League places. ""It is satisfying to have a second consecutive victory and what was important is the way we found confidence as a team,"" Genesio said. ""I am not sure that it was a better performance than in the defeat at Saint Etienne or the draw with Marseille, but with our first real chance we got the opening goal and that is always so important now in Ligue 1."" With eight of the bottom nine teams in action in the five late Saturday kick-offs it was unsurprisingly a tense evening of football. Montpellier blew a great chance to haul themselves out of the bottom three as they were held to a 1-1 draw by ten-man Lorient. Francois Bellugou was given a straight red card, and Kevin Berigaud took advantage to give Frederic Hantz's Montpellier a half-time lead. But Jimmy Cabot scored his first goal for Lorient since joining from Troyes last month to snatch a point. Reims made the most of Montpellier's slip-up as they saw off Caen 2-0. Goals from Thievy Bifouma and Prince Oniangue helped take Olivier Guegan's Reims three points clear of the relegation zone. Bastia picked up a much-needed victory by easing past bottom club Troyes 2-0 despite having a man sent off for the fifth time in five league games. Goalkeeper Jean Louis Leca's red card was sandwiched by a Floyd Ayite brace for the Corsicans, as visiting Troyes were reduced to nine men in a feisty encounter. Gazelec Ajaccio are now winless in six league games and just a point above the drop zone after playing out a goalless draw with fellow strugglers Guingamp, who had Lionel Mathis kick off the pattern of the night with his 10th minute dismissal. Meanwhile, a 0-0 stalemate with Nantes leaves Toulouse second-from-bottom and six points from safety."
24,30/01/2016,22:20,"Angers thump pitiful Monaco, Lyon lose again","Angers inflicted a 3-0 defeat on second-placed Monaco on Saturday to reignite their unlikely challenge for a Champions League spot in France, while Lyon's European hopes suffered another damaging blow following a 1-0 loss at Bastia.","Hosts Angers took an early lead at the Stade Ange Casanova when Cheikh N'Doye deflected in Romain Saiss's effort after Monaco failed to clear a corner. N'Doye doubled the advantage before half-time as Angers took utter control, before gloss was added to the scoreline in the second period by Mohamed Yattara. Monaco stayed 21 points behind champions elect Paris Saint-Germain, who play at Saint-Etienne on Sunday night. Angers moved, temporarily at least, above Nice and into the third and final Champions League place. ""Today I think we totally failed to turn up,"" said Monaco coach Leonardo Jardim. ""We didn't play with the intensity needed to compete in this league. ""It's difficult to explain. It's not possible to play really well five or six days ago (in a 4-0 win over Toulouse) and then perform like we did today."" Stephane Moulin's side have been a menace from set-pieces all season and they took a 19th-minute lead from a corner. Visiting stopper Danijel Subasic kept out a free header from Romain Thomas, but midfielder Saiss got to the rebound first and his shot flew in via the shin of Angers top-scorer N'Doye. The Senegalese midfielder has had a fantastic debut season in the top flight and the fortuitous effort was his sixth league goal this term. Monaco were wearing their training shirts as all three of their kits clashed with Angers' home strip, and it was another scrappy goal that gave N'Doye a brace and Angers a two-goal cushion that they thoroughly deserved. N'Doye's initial shot was turned onto the crossbar by a stunning Subasic save. Yattara then hit the loose ball towards the far corner with the aid of a big deflection, and although Subasic got across to save, the Monaco defence watched on as N'Doye prodded in from on the goalline. The hosts made the points safe ten minutes into the second period when Yattara steered home a third after N'Doye fluffed a great chance to complete the first hat-trick of his career. Despite claiming just their second win in six games, Angers are showing no sign of letting up in the race for Europe as their rivals also keep dropping points. ""Lots of people don't like Angers, but I really like them. They're a good side with 37 points, a return which they deserve for the quality they've shown,"" added Jardim. Lyon slumped to a seventh defeat in their last 10 league outings as Brazilian striker Brandao scored a 69th-minute winner in Corsica, with Bastia seeing out the final few minutes a man down after the dismissal of Gilles Cioni. Corentin Tolisso and Alexandre Lacazette spurned Lyon's best chances to come away with at least a point, the former seeing his shot blocked on the line by Sebastien Squillaci with Lacazette then denied by the legs of goalkeeper Jean-Louis Leca. Montpellier climbed out of the bottom three with a 4-0 win at Gazelec Ajaccio in new coach Frederic Hantz's first game in charge, with Reims sliding into the relegation zone after losing 2-0 at Lorient. Guingamp pulled further clear of trouble with a 2-1 victory at struggling Toulouse, while Nantes are unbeaten in nine games following a 1-0 win at bottom side Troyes. On Friday, Marseille set an unwanted club record as a 1-1 draw against Lille at the Velodrome extended their winless run at home to nine matches."
25,30/01/2016,19:04,Angers see off pitiful Monaco to retake third,Angers inflicted a heavy 3-0 defeat on second-placed Monaco on Saturday to end a three-match losing streak and reignite their unlikely challenge for a Champions League spot in France.,"Home team Angers took an early lead when Cheikh N'Doye deflected in Romain Saiss's effort after Monaco failed to clear a corner. N'Doye doubled the advantage before half-time as Angers took utter control, before gloss was added to the scoreline in the second period by Mohamed Yattara. Monaco stay 21 points behind champions elect Paris Saint-Germain, who play at Saint-Etienne on Sunday night. Angers move, temporarily at least, above Nice and into the third and final Champions League place. ""Today I think we totally failed to turn up,"" said Monaco coach Leonardo Jardim. ""We didn't play with the intensity needed to compete in this league. ""It's difficult to explain. It's not possible to play really well five or six days ago (in a 4-0 win over Toulouse) and then perform like we did today."" In a lively start to proceedings at the Stade Ange Casanova, Bernardo Silva wastefully chipped the ball straight at Angers goalkeeper Alexandre Letellier, while at the other end Billy Ketkeophomphone had a long-range effort pushed wide by Danijel Subasic. Stephane Moulin's side have been a menace from set-pieces all season and they took a 19th minute lead from a corner. Visiting stopper Subasic kept out a free header from Romain Thomas, but midfielder Saiss got to the rebound first and his shot flew in via the shin of Angers top-scorer N'Doye. The Senegalese midfielder has had a fantastic debut season in the top flight and the fortuitous effort was his sixth league goal this term. Monaco were wearing their training shirts as all three of their kits clashed with Angers' home strip, but this was a very competitive encounter and Subasic had to be alert to tip away powerful strikes from Pierrick Capelle and N'Doye. But it was another scrappy goal that gave N'Doye a brace and Angers a two-goal cushion that they thoroughly deserved. N'Doye's initial shot was turned onto the crossbar by a stunning Subasic save. Yattara then hit the loose ball towards the far corner with the aid of a big deflection, and although Subasic got across to save, the Monaco defence watched on as N'Doye prodded in from on the goalline. The visitors started the second half with far more intensity and attacking verve, and Tiemoue Bakayoko drew a low save from Letellier. But the hosts made the points safe ten minutes into the second period. N'Doye had a great chance to complete the first hat-trick of his career but miskicked straight to Yattara, who did the rest with aplomb. Letellier got down quickly to his right to deny Fabio Coentrao as Monaco searched for a consolation goal that would not prove forthcoming. Angers are showing no sign of letting up in the race for Europe as their rivals also keep dropping points. ""Lots of people don't like Angers, but I really like them. They're a good side with 37 points, a return which they deserve for the quality they've shown,"" added Jardim. A very disappointing Monaco lost this match just when threatening to pull away from the chasing pack, while Marseille were held 1-1 by struggling Lille at the Velodrome on Friday."
26,23/01/2016,19:37,Rampant PSG crush Angers to extend huge lead,Paris Saint-Germain served another reminder of their Ligue 1 supremacy with a thumping 5-1 victory at home to Angers on Saturday that moved the reigning champions 24 points clear at the top.,"Zlatan Ibrahimovic opened the scoring at the Parc des Princes with his 17th league goal of the season before Lucas doubled the lead for Laurent Blanc's side just before half-time. The floodgates then opened after the break with Gregory Van der Wiel rounding off a superb team move for PSG's third, only for Pierrick Capelle to pull one back, but Angel Di Maria then scored twice in the space of four minutes to complete the rout. With Paris still competing in four competitions, the capital club face a fixture backlog that will see them play seven games in three weeks ahead of their Champions League last 16, first leg against Chelsea on February 16. Blanc was without captain Thiago Silva, Marquinhos, Marco Verratti and Javier Pastore through injury but still fielded an imposing line-up, although there was no place for Uruguayan striker Edinson Cavani, whose future remains unclear amid reports this week linking him to Manchester United. Angers held Paris to a 0-0 draw when the sides met in December, the last time the capital club dropped points this season and the only occasion in which they have failed to score in Ligue 1 this term. The visitors entered the weekend with the league's second meanest defence, with goalkeeper Alexandre Letellier denying both Van der Wiel and Blaise Matuidi with his feet in the opening half hour. However, there was little the Angers keeper could do on 32 minutes when PSG broke the deadlock through Ibrahimovic, whose low shot from the right side of the area took a slight deflection as it flashed through the legs of Letellier. Di Maria then released Van der Wiel down the right eight minutes later and the Dutchman broke into the box, recovering the ball after an attempted tackle by Romain Thomas, before knocking it back for Lucas to sweep home. Home keeper Kevin Trapp was a spectator for much of the first half, aside from a Thomas header that forced the German to pluck the ball out of the air under heavy pressure inside his six-yard box. The hosts' two-goal lead allowed them to showcase the more expansive side of their game, with PSG's third goal on 54 minutes emanating from a slick interchange between Ibrahimovic and Di Maria before Matuidi's superb volleyed cross was turned in by Van der Wiel at the far post. But Angers continued to battle and reduced the deficit five minutes later as Capelle latched on to a headed clearance and steered a low volley just inside the post. That proved merely a blip on the radar, though, as PSG reasserted their dominance with a fourth goal on 63 minutes when a tumbling Lucas scooped the ball back to Di Maria and the Argentine brilliantly fired past Letellier on the volley from outside the box. Di Maria struck again moments later after he was put through by Matuidi and he once more produced a high-quality finish, chipping over the advancing Letellier to round out an 11th straight win in all competitions. On Sunday, second-placed Monaco are at home to relegation-threatened Toulouse, while two struggling giants meet at the brand new Parc OL as Lyon host Marseille. On Friday, Rennes made a winning start under new coach Rolland Courbis as Roderic Filippi's late own goal saw them beat Gazelec Ajaccio 1-0, ending the visitors' 11-game unbeaten league run."
27,15/01/2016,22:44,Ben Arfa brace of penalties fires Nice,Hatem Ben Arfa scored two late penalties as Nice came from behind to beat second-placed Angers 2-1 in Ligue 1 on Friday.,"Angers had appeared to be on course to strengthen their grip on second spot when Pierrick Capelle put the visitors in front in the first half at the Allianz Riviera with his second goal in as many games. However, Ben Arfa netted a first penalty to bring Nice level 10 minutes from the end after Jean-Michael Seri was fouled inside the area. And the home side were awarded another spot-kick in the 84th minute when a Niklas Hult cross struck the arm of Vincent Manceau. Ben Arfa stepped up again to send Alexandre Letellier the wrong way from 12 yards and score his ninth Ligue 1 goal of the campaign. Nice, whose only defeat in their last six Ligue 1 games came against leaders Paris Saint-Germain, move provisionally up to third on goal difference from their Cote d'Azur rivals Monaco, who visit Lorient on Sunday. Angers remain a point above them in second but they are an enormous 20 points adrift of still unbeaten PSG, who can extend their advantage further with a win at Toulouse on Saturday. The big game of the weekend sees Lyon visit fierce rivals Saint-Etienne on Sunday evening."
28,20/12/2015,19:04,Angers lose as PSG maintain 19-point lead,Paris Saint-Germain will finish 2015 with a 19-point lead at the top of Ligue 1 after Angers lost 1-0 at Saint-Etienne on Sunday.,"Benjamin Corgnet scored the only goal of the game on 62 minutes, denying Angers the chance of going back above Monaco into second place. PSG won 3-0 at fourth-placed Caen on Saturday to set a new record of 51 points at the halfway stage of the season after an unbeaten first 19 matches during the current campaign. PSG also set a club-record 28-match unbeaten league run after expensive stars Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Angel di Maria both hit the target in Caen. Monaco are second after a 0-0 draw at winless and rock bottom Troyes on Saturday took them a point clear of Angers. St Etienne, who have struggled for form this season, moved up to sixth, just three points behind Monaco in the congested race for the European places. ""I'm not looking at the top of the table because we're also rather too close for comfort to the relegation zone,"" Saints coach Christophe Galtier admitted after the game. ""Today's win was a key result, we really needed those three points,"" he added. Hubert Fournier may have overseen his last game at Lyon, who were last year's surprise package but who have flopped this season as they prepare to move into their new stadium in the new year sitting in mid-table and having been knocked out of all European competition. The coach and his club President Jean Michel Aulas were stone faced after watching Lyon lose 2-1 at tiny Gazelec Ajaccio, where Mohamed Larbi scored twice before Clement Grenier pulled a goal back late on. Later on Sunday, 2009 champions Bordeaux host the team that succeeded them a year later, Marseille, in an era before Qatari money helped PSG sweep all before them."

30,01/12/2015,21:36,Angers frustrate PSG in dour draw,Paris Saint-Germain's nine-match winning run in Ligue 1 was brought to a halt on Tuesday as they were held to a 0-0 draw away to promoted Angers.,"The reigning champions dropped points for just the third time this season after being unable to break down the division's tightest defence behind that of their own at the Stade Jean Bouin. The result left PSG on 42 points from 16 matches but still 14 points clear of nearest challengers Caen, who visit Monaco on Wednesday, with Angers one point further back in third. With six games in a 19-day stretch leading up to the winter break, PSG coach Laurent Blanc has made no secret of his desire to rotate his squad. Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who drew level with Mustapha Dahleb's club-record 85 top-flight goals over the weekend, dropped to the bench while Serge Aurier made his first league start since October in defence. Blaise Matuidi also returned to the side after being used as a substitute in Saturday's 4-1 win over Troyes, while Adrien Rabiot again kept his place in midfield after impressing in recent weeks. PSG were bidding to stretch their unbeaten league run to 25 games and nearly grabbed a fifth-minute lead when Edinson Cavani connected with a corner, only for the Uruguayan's glancing header to bounce back off the near post. Aurier then forced Angers goalkeeper Ludovic Butelle, who had kept nine clean sheets in 15 appearances prior to Tuesday, into a sharp save with a fierce angled drive. But the home side were again rescued by the woodwork on 33 minutes when Angel Di Maria weaved his way in from the right side of the penalty area before seeing his curling left-footed strike smack against the far post. Angers also struck the frame of the goal when a looping header from Romain Saiss dropped onto the top of the crossbar and bounced over, although PSG keeper Kevin Trapp appeared to have it covered. The hosts went even closer three minutes into the second half when skipper Cheikh Ndoye rose to meet a corner, but Trapp made a fine stop from point-blank range to thwart the Senegalese midfielder. Saiss again caused trouble from a set-piece, this time at his own end, as he flicked a cross towards his own goal with Butelle doing well to turn it over. Ibrahimovic replaced Lucas Moura on 71 minutes but PSG were still unable to find a way past Butelle who clawed away Rabiot's low strike late on that was destined for the bottom corner to preserve a hard-earned point for Angers. Nice missed the chance to leapfrog Angers into third when they were held to a 0-0 draw at mid-table Lorient."
31,22/11/2015,16:24,Marseillaise rings out in Corscia as Caen held,'La Marseillaise' rang out in Bastia on Sunday ahead of the much-anticipated Corsican Ligue 1 derby won 2-1 by Gazelec-Ajaccio as Caen missed the chance to go second behind Paris Saint-Germain following a goalless draw against Angers.,"Tightened security checks were in place throughout France, just over a week after terrorist attacks in Paris and the Stade de France left 130 people dead and more than 350 injured. And despite threats by Corsican nationalists to boo the French national anthem 'La Marseillaise' was sang with gusto at the Armand Cesari Stadium in Bastia in tribute to the victims of the Paris attacks. The club's leading supporters group Bastia 1905 announced prior to the game that they would not enter the stadium until after the national anthem. Only one solitary whistle could be heard in the stands during the rendition, before the Corsican chant ""Diu vi salvi Regina"" was sung and followed by the release of 130 white balloons, and a blue one for a club official who died the day before the attacks. In a match which had been postponed from Saturday because of strong winds in the Mediterranean island, Brandao opened for the hosts after five minutes following good work by midfielder Julian Palmieri. But 14 minutes later Cameroon international striker Jacques Zoua got the visitors on level terms, slotting home a penalty awarded when Bastia goalkeeper Jean-Louis Leca fouled Khalid Boutaib in the box. Boutaib missed a golden chance to put the visitors ahead with half an hour to go but alone on front of goal it was Leca who won the duel. Ten minutes later Boutaib made no mistake volleying in following a pinpoint David Ducourtioux headed cross. The win away lifts Ajaccio out of the relegation zone with neighbours Bastia taking their place. In Normandy, Caen were down to ten men after half and hour after Alaeddine Yahia was given a straight red card for a dangerous tackle. A win would have seen Caen move second behind PSG, who stretched their lead to 13 points on Saturday with a 2-1 win at Lorient. Caen are now third, equal on 25 points with Lyon, who lost 3-0 to Nice on Friday, and are ahead on goal difference. Angers are sitting fifth. Marseille travel to Saint-Etienne later on Sunday as Rennes host Bordeaux."
32,06/11/2015,23:18,Rennes end seven-match winless streak,"Rennes ended a seven-match winless streak with a 2-0 victory at Angers on Friday, topping off a week which had already seen France playmaker Yoann Gourcuff return to his boyhood club.","Rennes were ahead after just four minutes when Abdoulaye Doucoure finished off a fine move between Sylvain Armand and Giovanni Sio. Gelson Fernandes added the second goal on the hour mark after Angers failed to clear a corner. The win moved Rennes into sixth place in Ligue 1, 12 points behind leaders and champions Paris Saint Germain while Angers are fourth, 10 points off the pace. Earlier this week, Rennes signed former French international Gourcuff who was a free agent. The 31-times capped midfielder had already agreed in September to return to the club where he began his career but had not yet pen to paper."
33,01/11/2015,19:56,Monaco hand Angers rare loss as PSG extend lead,Monaco dealt surprise high-fliers Angers just a second defeat of the season on Sunday with a 1-0 victory over the Ligue 1 newcomers.,"Angers came into the weekend as the nearest challengers to runaway leaders Paris Saint-Germain but slipped 10 points adrift as Mario Pasalic's first-half goal at the Stade Louis II snapped the visitors' six-game unbeaten run. For Monaco it was the first time they had registered back-to-back wins this campaign as Leonardo Jardim's side moved up three places to sixth, two points behind second-placed Lyon, who are above Angers and Saint-Etienne on goal difference. ""This victory is very important for us, it's our first at home this term,"" said Jardim, who had seen his team pick up just three points from five home matches before Sunday. ""I hope with three straight wins (in all competitions) that the team will kick on from here. Winning breeds confidence and that's very important for us."" Angers have made an incredible start to their first season back in the French top flight since 1994 but were undone by Chelsea loanee Pasalic's close-range finish on 35 minutes after a knockdown header from towering Ivorian striker Lacina Traore. Stephan El Shaarawy came close to adding a second just after half-time but the toe of Ismael Traore diverted the Italy international's shot just wide of Ludovic Butelle's near post. Rony Lopes then produced a glaring miss shortly after when he somehow failed to hit the target after Elderson Echiejile's low cross had seemingly presented the Portuguese midfielder with a simple tap-in. Skipper Cheikh N'Doye had the best chance to snatch a point for Angers but the Senegalese midfielder nodded wide from Abdoul Camara's looping cross in the closing stages. Earlier, Nice were held in check by Lille in a 0-0 draw at the Allianz Riviera while Marseille, just three points above the relegation zone, visit Nantes later on. Reigning champions PSG stretched their already sizeable lead at the top with a 1-0 victory in Rennes on Friday courtesy of Angel di Maria's second-half strike. Lyon climbed up to second on Saturday as Claudio Beauvue's late penalty steered them to an unconvincing 1-0 win over 10-man Troyes, with Saint-Etienne easing to a 3-0 win over a slumping Reims side."
34,27/09/2015,19:30,Angers heap more misery on Marseille,Marseille's dismal start to the season continued with a woeful 2-1 defeat at home to Ligue 1 newboys Angers on Sunday.,"Goals from Thomas Mangani, a penalty, and Romain Thomas had Marseille in deep trouble at the Stade Velodrome before Michy Batshuayi reduced the deficit 11 minutes from time, again from the spot. The result left Michel's struggling side down in the bottom half of the table, just four points above the relegation zone. ""We played very badly in the first half, that's not the way to start a match,"" moaned Michel. ""We weren't in the match and were below par for many minutes. We lacked creativity and penetration. ""I can't explain it but we'll have to find a solution."" Angers continued their impressive return to the top flight after an absence of 21 years as they moved into fifth, but level on points with third-placed Rennes. ""Fifteen points after eight matches is crazy,"" said Angers coach Stephane Moulin. ""We managed to play to our strengths, the strengths of our club, our generosity, collective discipline. ""We're not crazy, we know Marseille are better than us, individually and collectively, but in football little teams can make life difficult for the big ones."" It was a dire finish to a peculiar match in which the Velodrome was empty at both ends due to a Ligue 1 punishment related to last weekend's incidents during the 1-1 draw with Lyon, in which several Marseille fans threw missiles at police and onto the pitch. Michel's team failed to muster a single shot on goal in the opening period despite dominating possession. But they were caught out when Remy Cabella gave away a penalty in bringing down Arnold Bouka Moutou and Mangani shot home high down the centre of the goal from 12 yards on 38 minutes. Marseille improved after the break, creating three chances in quick succession but Angers goalkeeper Ludovic Butelle saved the best of those with his feet from Bouna Sarr. Mangani set up the visitors' second 20 minutes from time with a free-kick that Thomas headed home. Nine minutes later the hosts were given a lifeline as Ferebory Dore brought down Lucas Ocampos and Batshuayi despatched the spot-kick. There was still time for Marseille to snatch a point but Paolo De Ceglie, Ocampos, Batshuayi and Cabella all missed good chances. A lucky goal from Nicolas Benezet a minute from time denied Monaco victory as Guingamp snatched a 3-3 draw. Having won 3-2 at Montpellier on Thursday, Monaco looked on course for a second successive away victory but despite taking the lead three times in the match, through Bernardo Silva, Andrea Raggi and Nabil Dirar, the hosts pegged them back each time thanks to Slovan Privat and a Benezet brace. The result left Monaco eighth and Guingamp 13th. Montpellier, the 2012 champions, got their first win of the season in 2-1 victory over mid-table Lorient. Jonas Martin hit the winner in the 57th minute after Lorient's Rafidine Abdullah had cancelled out Ramy Bensebaini's opener, although Montpellier remain in the bottom three. Champions Paris Saint-Germain extended their lead at the top on Saturday with a 4-1 win at Nantes as Zlatan Ibrahimovic, Edinson Cavani and Angel Di Maria all got on the scoresheet. Caen and Reims drew level with Rennes on 15 points with 2-0 wins over Gazelec Ajaccio and Lille respectively. Saint-Etienne remain second and can cut the gap to PSG to a point if they beat Nice later on Sunday."

Angers held off Dijon and Nancy in the battle for third spot behind the goal scoring exploits of striker Jonathan Kodjia who put away 15 goals which saw the 25-year-old voted Ligue 2 player of the season. Ligue 1 wraps up on Saturday with Evian, Metz and Lens guaranteed to drop into the second division next season. Paris Saint-Germain are already crowned champions for the third straight season."
