0,16/01/2021,20:42,Stuttering Marseille slump to shock home defeat,Florian Thauvin missed a penalty as Marseille's hopes of staying in the Ligue 1 title race were dealt another blow in a shock 2-1 home defeat by struggling Nimes on Saturday.,"France World Cup winner Thauvin sent a woeful spot-kick wide in the first half and Swedish winger Niclas Eliasson then converted twice from close range after the break to give the away side an unassailable lead behind closed doors at the Velodrome. Argentine forward Dario Benedetto pulled one back late on for Andre Villas-Boas's side but this result left them with just one win in six Ligue 1 games. Beaten narrowly by Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions Trophy in midweek, Marseille are sixth in the league, now eight points behind leaders Lyon, albeit still with a game in hand. ""We risk losing touch with the teams at the top, who are more consistent than us,"" said Villas-Boas. ""We were very bad and we paid an expensive price for it. We can't go from playing well against Paris to a miserable match like today."" Nimes move off the foot of the table after their first win in nine, but they remain in the bottom three. Lyon are at home to Metz on Sunday, but Paris Saint-Germain -- a point off the top in second -- can move provisionally top by winning at Angers later on Saturday. PSG are without their new coach Mauricio Pochettino, who is isolating after it was revealed on Friday that he had tested positive for coronavirus. Meanwhile relegation-threatened Lorient's home game against fellow strugglers Dijon has been postponed after a Covid-19 outbreak in the Brittany side."
1,16/10/2020,13:29,Neymar misses PSG game after Brazil duty,"Neymar will sit out Paris Saint-Germain's Ligue 1 game away at Nimes on Friday, hot on the heels of his starring role on international duty for Brazil.","The world's most expensive player scored a hat-trick for his country in a 4-2 win in Peru in 2022 World Cup qualifying. That match in Lima did not finish until the early hours of Wednesday, European time, and the quick turnaround means he will play no part for his club this weekend. Instead Paris coach Thomas Tuchel will keep the Brazilian fresh for the Champions League clash at home to Manchester United next Tuesday. PSG are without a raft of players for the game at Nimes, where they are seeking a fifth straight win after starting the season with two straight losses. Angel Di Maria and Marquinhos are suspended, while Marco Verratti and Mauro Icardi are among those missing due to injury. Midfielder Danilo Pereira must wait for his debut after arriving on loan from Porto -- he is isolating after coming into contact with Cristiano Ronaldo, who tested positive for Covid-19, while on international duty with Portugal. However, fellow new arrivals Rafinha and Moise Kean could play, and Kylian Mbappe is in the squad despite playing for France in Croatia on Wednesday evening."
2,07/10/2019,00:16,Late goal earns Saint-Etienne derby win over Lyon on Puel debut,Robert Beric scored a last-minute winner as Saint-Etienne defeated bitter rivals Lyon 1-0 on Sunday and new coach Claude Puel made a triumphant start in his first match in charge.,"Former Leicester City and Southampton boss Puel replaced Ghislain Printant on Friday after signing a three-year deal with the club that entered the derby clash bottom of Ligue 1. ""To produce such a display against Lyon is great, especially in such a short amount of time,"" said Puel, who also spent three years at Lyon from 2008-2011. ""This victory shows the players the sacrifice and desire they need to put into a match. I'm building something here and this fine start must be backed up."" Lyon began the weekend in trouble of their own, languishing a disappointing 11th after a domestic six-match winless run but buoyed by a Champions League victory at RB Leipzig. Anthony Lopes tipped a Riyad Boudebouz effort onto the post in a cagey first half at the Stade Geoffroy-Guichard, and the Lyon goalkeeper made another top reflex save to deny Denis Bouanga on the hour. Moussa Dembele came off the bench for Lyon and forced Jessy Moulin to palm away his header on 85 minutes, with Houssem Aouar then trickling an effort wide after sneaking in behind the hosts' defence. Beric won it at the death though as he rose superbly to head a Boudebouz cross beyond the reach of Lopes to send Saint-Etienne up to 13th and two points above Lyon. ""I'm very worried by our results,"" said Lyon coach Sylvinho. ""We're losing all our matches in the same way. It's not up to me to say if I'm the man for the situation. ""I feel the same as I did after (the 2-2 draws with) Amiens and Brest,"" he added. ""We've conceded again at the end of the match. It's even more frustrating in a derby."" In-form Victor Osimhen's seventh league goal of the season wasn't enough for Lille as they missed the chance to go third after drawing 2-2 with Nimes. Nigeria international Osimhen, 20, who also scored in Lille's 2-1 Champions League defeat to Chelsea midweek, struck the hosts' leveller with 11 minutes remaining after a Renaud Ripart penalty at the end of the first half and Kevin Denkey's neat 70th-minute finish had cancelled out Loic Remy's 13th-minute opener. A win for Lille would have moved them above surprise package Angers following their 4-0 hammering at the hands of league leaders Paris Saint-Germain on Saturday. Instead Christophe Galtier's side stay in fifth on 15 points from nine matches, but they could have easily lost against a spirited Nimes side that belied their pre-match league position of 17th. The lively Romain Philippoteaux, who won the spot-kick that Ripart calmly slotted home, came close to scoring a wonderful individual strike when his finish clipped the outside of the post following an exciting dribble. Reims moved into sixth, a point behind Lille after Boulaye Dia's strike three minutes after half-time consigned former high-fliers Rennes to the latest defeat in a miserable run of form. Level with PSG at the top of the league at the end of August, Julien Stephan's Rennes haven't won in the eight games in any competition since and have plummeted down to 10th. Reims meanwhile consolidated a fine start to the season that sees them with the league's best defensive record alongside PSG, with just four goals conceded in nine games."
3,11/08/2019,23:42,"PSG start title defence with win, fans vent fury at Neymar",Paris Saint-Germain brushed off the ongoing Neymar transfer saga by kicking off their Ligue 1 title defence with a straightforward 3-0 victory over Nimes on Sunday.,"The 27-year-old Neymar was left out of the squad the day after PSG sporting director Leonardo said talks about a possible sale of the Brazilian were ""more advanced than before"". On Sunday, coach Thomas Tuchel told Canal+ he had ""no news"" on Neymar's future and that he would have to ""find solutions without"" him. Edinson Cavani's controversial VAR penalty in the 24th minute set PSG on their way at the Parc des Princes, after supporters had made their negative feelings towards the absent Neymar clear. A fine second-half display from Kylian Mbappe -- with a goal and an assist for Angel Di Maria -- showed Tuchel the obvious solution to Neymar's impending exit, and gave the capital club a perfect start to their bid for a third straight French title and ninth in total. ""We are not going to lie. We will see what happens with Neymar -- but it's not the same team,"" said Mbappe. PSG sit level with Lyon, who beat Monaco 3-0 on Friday, at the top of the fledgling table, and will be hoping to occupy that position for the rest of the season. Former Barcelona forward Neymar's two years in the French capital since PSG made him the world's most expensive player have been plagued by injuries and controversies. Home fans unfurled a banner before kick-off translating to ""Neymar. Get out"". Other banners slammed his recent comment that his fondest memory in football was inspiring Barcelona's stunning 2017 Champions League comeback against PSG, while one called Neymar ""heartless"". Neymar has been linked with a return to Barca or a move to their arch rivals Real Madrid. Tuchel handed Ligue 1 debuts to centre-back Abdou Diallo, signed from Borussia Dortmund in the close-season, and midfielder Pablo Sarabia, who joined from Sevilla. The champions monopolised the ball from the off, with Mbappe shooting straight at visiting goalkeeper Paul Bernardoni after jinking through the massed Nimes defence. They were awarded a penalty by VAR midway through the first half, as a corner struck Nimes defender Pablo Martinez on the arm after Diallo ducked under the ball while standing right in front of him. Cavani slammed the spot-kick into the net, before Nimes coach Bernard Blaquart was booked for his protestations. A pedestrian affair, with Nimes happy to almost exclusively keep all 11 men behind the ball, had to wait until the 57th minute for a second goal when Mbappe slotted in to open his league account for the campaign. Di Maria came off the bench and drilled into the bottom corner after an excellent pass from Mbappe with 20 minutes remaining, and PSG played out the most comfortable of wins -- finishing with 74 percent of possession as goalkeeper Alphonse Areola did not face a shot on target. Earlier on Sunday, new signing Victor Osimhen marked his Ligue 1 debut with two goals as last year's runners-up Lille kicked off their new campaign with a 2-1 victory over Nantes. Christophe Galtier's hosts, who finished 16 points behind PSG last term, were indebted to Nigerian Osimhen, who scored a fabulous 80th-minute winner at the Stade Pierre-Mauroy. ""When I have opportunities, I don't want to miss them,"" said the 20-year-old. ""I'm not yet 100 percent but I'm training hard and I know that with time I'll be in top shape physically."""
4,28/04/2019,23:16,Lille close on Champions League return with Nimes thrashing,Lille moved closer to a return to the Champions League group stage for the first time since 2012 as Christophe Galtier's side produced a fine second-half display to thrash Nimes 5-0 on Sunday.,"Five different players scored after the break as Lille moved six points clear of third-placed Lyon, who they face next weekend, in Ligue 1. The top two in France qualify directly for the Champions League. ""We're averaging two points a game,"" said Galtier. ""We've had a magnificent season, we must make it exceptional by producing a big performance in Lyon next Sunday."" Former Chelsea forward Loic Remy broke the deadlock six minutes after half-time at the Stade Pierre-Mauroy. Jonathan Bamba made it two with a magnificent header 13 minutes later. Turkish full-back Zeki Celik lobbed in the third with 20 minutes to play and Nicolas Pepe tapped in his 20th Ligue 1 goal of the season 10 minutes later. Substitute Rui Fonte to drilled home an injury-time fifth, leaving Lille on the brink of Europe's top table. Elsewhere, fourth-placed Saint-Etienne kept the pressure on Lyon in the race for a Champions League qualifying-round spot, as Robert Beric's early double secured a 2-0 win over Toulouse. The Slovenian striker diverted in Pierre-Yves Polomat's low cross to put Les Verts ahead in only the second minute. Beric slotted in his second only eight minutes later as Wahbi Khazri unselfishly squared the ball. Saint-Etienne are only three points adrift of Lyon with four games of the season remaining, while Marseille sit five points further back in fifth place. Marseille's Champions League hopes all but came to an end, though, as Rudi Garcia's men slipped to a 2-1 home defeat by Nantes later on Sunday despite Mario Balotelli's sixth goal in seven games at the Stade Velodrome for the club. Samuel Moutoussamy curled Nantes into a 22nd-minute lead, but Balotelli headed home Lucas Ocampos' excellent right-wing cross to level only three minutes later. Brazilian Andrei Girotto, who had been sent off three times in his previous four league games, made some amends for those dismissals by bundling in the winner for Nantes less than five minutes after half-time. Marseille remain eight points adrift of Lyon, and now face an uphill battle just to reach the Europa League. Balotelli called on his teammates to keep fighting, but stopped short of fully committing his future to Marseille, despite only joining the club in January. ""Nothing is lost. I was champion of England in the last minute (with Manchester City in 2012),"" said Balotelli, who was substituted in the 68th minute. ""We must believe until the end. I must finish the championship first before talking about my future."" Algerian Youcef Atal scored a hat-trick as Patrick Vieira's Nice beat bottom club Guingamp 3-0 to keep their hopes of reaching the Europa League alive. ""I'm very happy, it's my first hat-trick. Every time you score, you want to start again,"" said Atal, who made the most of playing on the wing despite usually being a full-back. Caen edged out fellow strugglers Dijon 1-0 to move above their opponents into 18th, the relegation play-off place, and keep the pressure on 17th-placed Monaco. Stephanie Frappart became the first female referee to take charge of a Ligue 1 game in Amiens' goalless draw with Strasbourg. ""I feel a lot of pride after this match,"" she said. ""I think that I managed to do what I wanted to do, and that I had the qualities to officiate in Ligue 1."""
5,13/04/2019,19:15,Marseille survive late VAR drama to stay in Champions League hunt,Marseille kept up their hunt for Champions League football on Saturday despite losing in-form striker Mario Balotelli to injury after VAR saw them escape last-gasp penalty drama to beat Nimes 2-1.,"Balotelli has helped kick-start Marseille's chase for European football with seven goals in 10 Ligue 1 games since arriving from Nice in January but left the field with a thigh injury 12 minutes before the break. However Rudi Garcia's side move into the European places after squeaking past Nimes in the enigmatic Italian's absence, taking the three points thanks to two goals in two second half minutes from Valere Germain and Luiz Gustavo. They now sit fourth in Ligue 1's Europa League spot on 51 points, five behind third-placed Lyon -- in the final Champions League spot -- with six matches left to play and a clash between the two sides to come at the Stade Velodrome on May 12. Nimes sit 10th despite Teji Savanier getting the away side back in the game with a 82nd minute penalty following Boubacar Kamara's handball. Bernard Blaquart thought his side had a golden chance for an equaliser in the final seconds when referee Frank Schneider blew for another spot-kick in the fourth minute of added time when Marseille right-back Bouna Sarr handled the ball after falling over in his own area. However after consulting with the video assistant referees Schneider ruled out the penalty for a trip on Sarr. Later on Saturday bottom two teams Caen and Guingamp will try to escape the drop zone when they take on mid-table Angers and Strasbourg respectively, while Monaco hope to further ease their own relegation worries when they host Reims."
6,09/03/2019,22:31,Skipper Marcelo injured as Lyon stumble before Barca trip,"Lyon's stand-in captain Marcelo left the field with a leg injury as his side struggled to a 2-2 draw at Strasbourg on Saturday, just days away from the Champions League last 16 second leg at Barcelona.","Bruno Genesio's side head to the La Liga giants with the tie finely balanced at 0-0 after the first leg in France but the Brazilian defender is a doubt for Wednesday's fixture. ""It's too early to know if he'll play against Barcelona. He has a little issue with his hamstring. We'll do everything we have to so he plays, but we have to wait until Sunday,"" Genesio told Canal+. Genesio added he plans to talk to the club's doctor after extra tests are carried out on the centre-back on Sunday. Moussa Dembele scored twice for Lyon at the Stade de la Meinau before Ludovic Ajorque claimed a double of his own in the space of 60 seconds during the second half. Club skipper Nabil Fekir, forward Bertrand Traore, attacker Memphis Depay as well as midfielder Tanguy Ndombele started on the bench as Genesio attempted to rest the influential four as the French club eye a first quarter-final in Europe's top-tier competition since 2010. Fekir and Traore were brought on during the last quarter of an hour looking for a late winner but their efforts were in vain. Lyon remain in third place in the table, four points behind Lille who travel to Saint Etienne on Sunday. Elsewhere big-spending Monaco dropped down to 17th place after a 1-1 draw against Bordeaux as 10-man Amiens beat mid-table Nimes 2-1 to move to 16th and Dijon rose out of the automatic relegation places with a 1-1 stalemate against Reims."
7,23/02/2019,19:38,Mbappe hits half century record as PSG strenghten hold on Ligue 1 title,Kylian Mbappe became on Saturday the youngest ever player to score 50 Ligue 1 goals after striking twice in Paris Saint-Germain's comfortable 3-0 win over Nimes that tightened the champions' grip on the French title.,"Mbappe scored in the 69th and 89th minutes as runaway league leaders PSG extended their lead on second-placed Lille to 17 points after the northern side's 1-1 draw at Strasbourg on Friday, and snatched the record from Yannick Stopyra, who according to football statistics database Opta was 21 years, 11 months and nine days old when he hit his 50th top flight goal in 1982. ""I work every day to try to help my team as much as possible,"" Mbappe said to Canal+ after the win. ""Football is still fun for me, and scoring goals and breaking records is what drives me so I'm very happy."" Christopher Nkunku's 40th-minute strike, which came after a beautiful chipped pass from Marco Verratti, got the ball rolling for Thomas Tuchel's side against mid-table Nimes, who had goalkeeper Paul Bernadoni and poor PSG finishing -- in particular from Mbappe -- to thank for not taking an even heavier beating at the Parc de Princes. Still missing injured strike partners Edinson Cavani and Neymar, Mbappe should have put the hosts in the lead eight minutes before Nkunku's opener when he somehow hit Bernadoni's outstretched leg instead of the back of the net when put clean through by a sumptuous Verratti pass. World Cup winner Mbappe thought he had sneaked in the second with his hand just before the break, only to be caught punching instead of heading in Thiago Silva's flick-on via the video assistant referee system and booked for his troubles. The 20-year-old appeared on a personal mission to break the record in the second half but, first cutting in from the left and firing just wide eight minutes after the restart before his volley from Marquinhos' chipped past was brilliantly palmed away by Bernadoni. He somehow poked wide on the hour mark after charging onto a low cross from the left before finally making his half-century -- and doubling PSG's lead -- in almost exactly the same fashion nine minutes later, meeting the surging Juan Bernat's cut back with a neat first-time finish. And the Frenchman made the result even more emphatic when he finished off a lightning break started by Nkunku to take his league tally for the season to 22 and his career total to 51."
8,15/02/2019,23:27,Lyon ready for 'game of season' with Barcelona after Guingamp win,"Lyon edged rock-bottom Guingamp 2-1 in Ligue 1 on Friday with a fabulous winner from captain Nabil Fekir, just days ahead of Barcelona's visit for a Champions League clash.","Lyon consolidated third place in Ligue 1 while resting a couple of key players and even taking their foot off the gas with Barcelona in mind. ""It's our game of the year, it'll be a big match, but we often do well in them,"" Lyon president Jean Michel Aulas told French TV. ""Bruno (Genesio the Lyon coach) takes tactical risks and we have surprised (Manchester) City before, and this stadium was built for matches like this,"" he added on their 60,000-capacity home. ""Many of the players had Tuesday on their minds but with Barcelona coming that's normal,"" said Genesio, mastermind of the four points Lyon took off City in the group phase to squeeze into the last-16. ""We have some doubts still about who is playing on Tuesday, but you'll have to wait until Monday to find out,"" Genesio added. Ahead of their Sunday game with Saint Etienne, PSG still lead Ligue 1 on 59 points with Lille second on 49 and Lyon third on 46. Martin Terrier put Lyon ahead after a scramble on 15 minutes before defender Leo Dubois was then overpowered five minutes later by Guingamp's Cameroon midfielder Felix Eboa Eboa, who rushed in for a header at the far post shouldering the defender out of the way to make it 1-1. But then on 35 minutes Fekir controlled the ball on his chest, took a quick touch to set himself up for the shot and curled a fabulous left-foot shot into the top corner from outside the box. Fekir, however, will miss the game against Barcelona through suspension. ""I'll be in the stadium supporting my teammates from the stands and I'll believe in them all the way,"" said French international Fekir. One other worry for Lyon was the loss of lively striker Moussa Dembele, who was replaced late on by Dutch forward Memphis Depay. Earlier Friday, Nimes secured top flight survival with a 2-0 win over Dijon"
9,26/01/2019,23:12,Monaco plight persists in wake of Henry exit,"Monaco suffered another damaging defeat as they lost 2-0 at Dijon in Ligue 1 on Saturday, just 24 hours after reappointing former boss Leonardo Jardim to take over from the sacked Thierry Henry.","Former France and Arsenal star Henry was suspended and later axed by Monaco after just two wins in the league since his arrival in October. Jardim, who led Monaco to the French title in 2017, is returning to the club only three months after he was dismissed following a dreadful start to the season. His first game back in charge will be Tuesday's League Cup semi-final against Guingamp, as Henry's former assistant Franck Passi oversaw the trip to fellow strugglers Dijon. The abject nature of this latest defeat further emphasised Monaco's perilous position in the table where they remain second from bottom, a point above last-placed Guingamp. ""We're giving everything but it's not enough,"" said Monaco captain Radamel Falcao. ""Each player has to continue to give more, all of us together. We're all in the same boat. ""We didn't manage to change things with Thierry Henry and now we must carry on with a better spirit and all fight together."" Dijon's Kwon Chang-hoon notched his first league goal since May, having recently returned from an Achilles injury, with a calm finish on 24 minutes after a static Naldo played the South Korean onside. Monaco were reduced to 10 men on the hour when Brazilian Naldo saw red for a clumsy challenge on Julio Tavares, and another defensive lapse allowed Naim Sliti to wrap up what was just Dijon's second league win since August. It was Naldo's second red card in a week after he was also dismissed in the 5-1 loss to Strasbourg last Saturday. ""We had chances just like in the past four of five matches but we always make a mistake that kills us,"" said Passi, who refused to be drawn on his own future. ""We let the other team go ahead and we're chasing after the result and that obviously makes it harder,"" he added. ""These players have the quality. They have what it takes to stay up but they just need for things to click and for it to happen quickly."" Youcef Atal and Allan Saint-Maximin scored for Patrick Vieira's Nice in a 2-0 home win over Nimes, while Kenny Lala fired home a sweet half-volley with practically the final kick to give Strasbourg a 1-0 victory over Bordeaux. Reims climbed into the top half as a 1-0 win at Guingamp stretched their unbeaten run to six matches. On Sunday, leaders Paris Saint-Germain will host Rennes without the injured Neymar. The world's most expensive player limped out of Wednesday's French Cup win over Strasbourg after hurting his foot, an injury similar to the one that ruled him out for more than two months last season. PSG coach Thomas Tuchel has said it is ""still too early"" to assess the seriousness of Neymar's injury, leaving the French giants sweating over his fitness ahead of their Champions League clash with Manchester United next month."
10,16/12/2018,23:25,Pepe gives second-placed Lille victory at Nimes,In-form striker Nicolas Pepe scored what proved to be the winner as 10-man Lille claimed a 3-2 win at Nimes on Sunday to consolidate second place in Ligue 1.,"Later on Sunday, Lyon won 3-0 at home against struggling Monaco to move into third. Lyon are three points behind Lille with a match in hand, while Montpellier, who did not play for a second consecutive week, are another two points back but have played two games fewer than Lille. The French title race is all but over with reigning champions Paris Saint-Germain 10 points clear, but a young Lille side are eyeing a return to the Champions League group stage for the first time since 2012. ""What a match, I'm really proud of my players,"" said Lille coach Christophe Galtier. ""We must not forget that we played for more than an hour and 20 minutes with 10 men. ""With the added time, it was a very long and hard match physically."" Portuguese teenager Rafael Leao headed Lille into a fourth-minute lead, but Galtier's men suffered a setback when former Southampton centre-back Jose Fonte was sent off in the 16th minute. Jonathan Bamba's deflected effort doubled the advantage shortly before the interval, though, and Pepe appeared to have made the points safe midway through the second half with his 12th goal of the campaign. The 10 men finally started to tire late on, but Lille held on for victory despite Nimes goals from Rachid Alioui and Clement Depres. In the late game, Lyon dominated Thierry Henry's Monaco from beginning to end. They took the lead in only the sixth minute with a goal by Houssem Aouar, his sixth of the season. Nabil Fekir added the second in the 34th minute, attacking Kenny Tete's low cross as Monaco's Jemerson hesitated. Monaco managed only one shot all game. They played almost the whole second half with 10 men after Aleksandr Golovin raked his studs down the back of Fekir's calf in the 47th minute and was sent off. Ferland Mendy added a deserved third for Lyon just before the hour mark."
11,21/09/2018,23:01,Monaco again struggle to make home advantage count,Monaco's home struggles continued on Friday night as they squandered a string of chances in a 1-1 with Nimes to stretch their winless run to six.,"Monaco have not won at their Stade Louis II all season. In their last home league match they lost to Marseille and on Tuesday were beaten by visiting Atletico Madrid in the Champions League. Promoted Nimes took the lead after 19 minutes. Captain Anthony Briancon leapt unchallenged to meet a curling free kick from Antonin Bobichon and bulleted a header between goalkeeper Diego Benaglio's upstretched arms. It was the central defender's first goal in Ligue 1. Monaco captain Radamel Falcao levelled eight minutes later, running at a backpedalling Nimes defence and hitting a low 20-metre shot that deflected off defender Gaetan Paquiez and into the corner of the goal. Monaco dominated the game but were frustrated by a succession of saves from Nimes keeper Paul Bernadoni and by their own wastefulness. The worst misses, both from close range, were from Falcao, who volleyed against the bar, and Moussa Sylla who scooped a chance high a minute after coming on as a substitute. Monaco almost paid the price when Briancon hit the bar in added time."
12,03/09/2018,00:32,Marseille come from behind to stun Monaco,Marseille came from behind to beat southern rivals Monaco 3-2 on Sunday thanks to a 90th minute winner from Valere Germain.,"Konstantinos Mitroglou kissed Dimitri Payet's right boot after his superb cross allowed the Greek to give Marseille the advantage right on half-time at the Stade Louis II. Youri Tielemans hit back for Monaco on 48 minutes before World Cup winner Adil Rami, watched by US actress girlfriend Pamela Anderson, failed to clear properly and Falcao gobbled up the loose ball to smash a shot into the roof of the net and put the home side ahead. But Florent Thauvin equalled things up from a Hiroki Sakai pass before Germain's header sneaked in at the near post to give Marseille a memorable win. Rami joked that his error ""had made a match of it, all on my own"". ""I am going to get down to work, I need to show a better side of myself,"" he said. With seven points from four games, Marseille trail leaders Paris Saint Germain, who beat Nimes 4-2 on Saturday, by five points."
13,20/08/2018,14:06,African players in Europe: Iwobi goal in vain as Arsenal flop again,"Nigeria and Arsenal winger Alex Iwobi opened his 2018/2019 English Premier League goal account at the weekend, but could not prevent a 3-2 loss at London rivals Chelsea.","The Gunners might have avoided a second straight league defeat had 2015 African Footballer of the Year Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang from Gabon not fluffed several scoring chances. Algerian Riyad Mahrez, who succeeded Aubameyang as African Footballer of the Year, made an impressive but goalless home debut for Manchester City in a 6-1 rout of Huddersfield. ALEX IWOBI (Arsenal) Iwobi scored with a clinical close-range finish, but missed a chance to put the Gunners ahead and Chelsea took full advantage. Marcos Alonso's late winner left Arsenal to rue a second successive defeat under new boss Unai Emery. PIERRE-EMERICK AUBAMEYANG (Arsenal) The striker endured a dismal afternoon at Stamford Bridge as his misses contributed to Arsenal's defeat. Aubameyang should have equalised after Chelsea's opening goal, but fluffed his lines with a woeful close-range miss. After Arsenal had battled back to 2-2 from two goals down, Aubameyang misfired again from close-range. RIYAD MAHREZ (Manchester City) The Algeria winger made his home debut for the Premier League champions in their demolition of Huddersfield. Mahrez arrived from Leicester in a £60 million (67 million euros, $76.5 million) move in the close season and made his first appearance in the Community Shield win over Chelsea at Wembley. Mahrez finally got to play in front of the City faithful at Eastlands when he came off the bench as a 64th-minute substitute against Huddersfield. Although he did not get on the scoresheet, he impressed for dominant City. MUBARAK WAKASO/PATRICK TWUMASI (Alaves) Ghana internationals Wakaso and Twumasi were both in the squad for Alaves' tricky trip to Barcelona for the La Liga season opener. Wakaso was part of a four-man midfield as the visitors attempted to snuff out Barcelona's attacking threat and it worked for over an hour until Lionel Messi inspired a 3-0 win. Wakaso had one shot blocked while winger Twumasi, signed from Astana, had to watch from the bench as an unused substitute. SEKO FOFANA (Udinese) Ivorian midfielder Fofana got his first goal of the season, scoring the equaliser as Udinese completed a comeback from two goals down to draw 2-2 at promoted Parma. Fofana, 23, scored four minutes after teammate Rodrigo De Paul had pulled the northeastern side, who narrowly avoided relegation last season, back into the game. It was his ninth league goal in his third season with the club. KWADWO ASAMOAH (Inter Milan) Ghana midfielder Asamoah began life as an Inter Milan player with a 1-0 defeat to Sassuolo after six years at Turin giants Juventus. The 29-year-old had appeals for a spot-kick waved away after being brought down by Francesco Magnanelli. KEVIN-PRINCE BOATENG (Sassuolo) Boateng played an important role in his new centre-forward role after moving to Sassuolo from Germany during the close season. ""Proud of my team and so happy to be back,"" tweeted the 31-year-old former AC Milan player after the win over Inter Milan. Boateng thought he had made it 2-0 for the side from Modena after 65 minutes but his effort bounced off the post. DENIS BOUANGA (Nimes) The Le Mans-born Gabon winger scored his first goal for Nimes since arriving from Lorient last month and the first for his new employers in the top flight at home since 1993 in the 3-1 defeat of Marseille. He also had a decisive role in the counter-attack that led to the second goal."

And it came a week after they opened with a 4-3 win at Angers which has lifted the side with the lowest Ligue 1 budget into the unlikely position of second in the fledgling table, level on points with the wealthiest team in the league, Paris Saint-Germain. As if this embarrassing loss wasn't punishment enough for Marseille coach Rudi Garcia he suffered another blow when his World Cup winning keeper Steve Mandanda had to come off with an apparent injured thigh. Bouanga stunned Garcia's men when he fired the former employers of Eric Cantona into a 34th minute lead, Mustapha Diallo supplying the assist from the left. The Stade des Costieres erupted in celebration to mark the club's first Ligue 1 goal scored at home in 25 years. The Le Mans-born Gabon international was inking his name in the club's history just a month after joining from Lorient. Nimes were in front until four minutes after the restart when Florian Thauvin stylishly completed a move against the run of play begun when Valere Germain intercepted a Nimes freekick. Parity lasted until after the hour when Bouanga was at the heart of a counter finished off by Thioub who rounded Mandanda to tap in to an empty net. Marseille's hopes of salvaging something took a hit when Mandanda came off, with Yohann Pele coming on in the France World Cup winner's place. Ripart rounded off a magical evening for Nimes three minutes from time to leave Marseille already lagging three points off PSG. Earlier, Bordeaux were beaten 2-1 by Toulouse with the loss failing to lift spirits at the club after the suspension of coach Gustavo Poyet. The Uruguayan's future is in serious doubt after he was served with a one week ban for an angry tirade at club bosses over the sale of striker Gaetan Laborde to Ligue 1 rivals Montpellier. Eric Bedouet, one of Poyet's assistants, took charge for Sunday's derby but hopes of a pick-me-up on the pitch were dashed by Leya Iseka and Mathieu Dossevi, who scored for Toulouse in either half. Bedouet sprang to the defence of Poyet at the post-match press conference, describing the former Chelsea and Tottenham player as ""a charming, competent man...who loves the club"". ""It's never ideal when a manager leaves like that,"" he added in explanation of the team's showing in the derby defeat."
