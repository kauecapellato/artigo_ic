0,10/02/2021,23:40,Sevilla double leaves Barca with mountain to climb in Copa del Rey,Barcelona's hopes of winning the Copa del Rey this season were left hanging by a thread on Wednesday after Sevilla won the first leg of their semi-final 2-0.,"Jules Kounde furthered his growing reputation as one of the world's most exciting central defenders by scoring a stunning goal at the Ramon Sanchez Pizjuan before Ivan Rakitic came back to haunt his former club by adding a second late on. The 22-year-old Kounde dribbled past three Barca defenders and shot into the corner while Rakitic's strike turned a setback for Ronald Koeman's side into what now looks like a formidable challenge to make the final. The winner will meet either Athletic Bilbao or Levante, who play the first leg of their semi on Thursday, in the final. ""The result is a bit unfair, the reward feels too much for them,"" said Koeman. ""The return will be complicated at 2-0 but we have had chances and we have to keep going. At home, this team is capable of anything."" Koeman had described the cup as Barcelona's ""shortest route"" to a trophy this term and the sight of Kounde ghosting through his defence hardly inspires confidence ahead of next week's meeting with Paris Saint-Germain. Barca face PSG at Camp Nou in the first leg of the Champions League last 16 on Tuesday. Yet all is not lost in the cup. Although Koeman fielded his best available XI, after resting players against Real Betis in La Liga last weekend, he will also hope to have injured defenders available again for the return game at Camp Nou on March 3. With Ronald Araujo and Gerard Pique out, Koeman played a patched-up back four of Jordi Alba at left-back, the left-footed Junior Firpo at right-back, right-back Oscar Mingueza at centre-back, alongside Samuel Umtiti, who is still regaining sharpness after a string of injuries. ""We are halfway through the tie with the hardest half to come,"" said Sevilla coach Julen Lopetegui. Lionel Messi was quiet but forced a decent save from Bono early on after a superb pass by Antoine Griezmann, with Sevilla the better side in the first half and deserving their goal. Kounde carried the ball out from deep in his own half and bounced the ball off Suso before advancing into Barcelona's defensive third. He ghosted past Griezmann, darted inside Sergio Busquets and with Alba dragged left, nicked it around the legs of Umtiti before driving into the far corner to complete a stunning individual effort. Barca had Marc-Andre ter Stegen to thank for denying Sergio Escudero a second but neither side looked keen to risk conceding by pushing too hard for a goal after half-time. Yet Sevilla were gifted one with five minutes left as Oliver Torres' ball over the top freed Rakitic, who had options inside. Rakitic went alone, blasting into the roof of the net and refusing to celebrate, but putting Sevilla in sight of the final."
1,02/02/2021,23:09,Ocampos fires Sevilla into Copa del Rey semis,Lucas Ocampos' second-half goal was enough to see Sevilla edge past second-tier Almeria 1-0 on Tuesday to reach the Copa del Rey semi-finals.,"Papu Gomez, who joined from Atalanta last week, made his debut for Sevilla but made little impact and was substituted on the hour mark. It was his first appearance since December 16 after falling out of favour with Atalanta coach Gian Piero Gasperini. ""I think he played a good game,"" said Sevilla boss Julen Lopetegui. ""It wasn't easy for him after a month and a half without playing and I think he's at a good level."" Gomez's fellow Argentinian Ocampos broke Almeria's stubborn resistance in the 67th minute, heading home Suso's cross. It is the first time Sevilla, five-time winners, have reached the last four since being thrashed 5-0 by Barcelona in the 2018 final. Sevilla are bidding for a second major trophy under former Spain and Real Madrid coach Lopetegui, having won the Europa League last season. Lopetegui's side have now won six straight matches in all competitions and have lost just one of their last 16 games. Sevilla, who sit fourth in La Liga, are also into the Champions League last 16, where they will face Borussia Dortmund. On Wednesday, record 30-time winners Barcelona visit Granada in their last-eight tie, after Levante host Villarreal, with Real Betis facing Athletic Bilbao on Thursday."
2,26/01/2021,21:09,Gomez signs for Sevilla after leaving Atalanta,Sevilla said on Tuesday they had reached an agreement to sign Argentine playmaker Alejandro 'Papu' Gomez from Atalanta of Serie A.,"The Spanish club said the Argentine, who turns 33 in February, had signed until June 2024. Gomez could become a belated replacement for compatriot Ever Banega, who left to play in Saudi Arabia after Sevilla won the Europa League in August. Earlier in the day, Gomez described his mixed emotions on leaving Bergamo-based Atalanta where he was club captain but fell out with coach Gian Piero Gasperini. ""It's a mixture of feelings, after so many years in this city,"" Gomez told Sky Sport Italia. ""I'm sad, and also happy. Sometimes things happen and go a certain way, but I would do it all again because we wrote the history of this club. I leave Atalanta at the top in Europe."" Gomez joined Atalanta in 2014 from Ukrainian outfit Metalist Kharkiv, and skippered them to the Champions League quarter-finals on their competition debut. He scored 59 goals in 252 games for Atalanta. Gomez fell out with Gasperini after a clash during half-time in a European match this season. The club went through to the last 16 of the Champions League for the second consecutive season where they will play 13-time winners Real Madrid. ""The fans? I'll miss them a lot, Bergamo is in my heart. We will surely see each other again soon,"" added Gomez, who has scored one goal in five appearances for Argentina."
3,19/01/2021,23:59,Suso cracker lifts Sevilla past Alaves,A magnificent long-range strike from Suso secured Sevilla a 2-1 victory at Alaves on Tuesday that sent them up to fourth in La Liga and within a point of Barcelona.,"Moroccan striker Youssef En-Nesyri, a reported January transfer target for West Ham, turned in a Jesus Navas cross to give Sevilla the lead on three minutes. Edgar Mendez soon levelled for the hosts but a thunderous 30-yard drive from Suso put Sevilla back in front on the half-hour, with goalkeeper Bono saving a stoppage-time penalty from Joselu to preserve the win. Julen Lopetegui's side moved up two spots ahead of a favourable run of matches against clubs largely in the bottom half of the table. Real Valladolid recovered from two goals down to draw 2-2 at home to Elche while Cadiz and Levante also ended two apiece. Leaders Atletico Madrid can extend their cushion at the top when they visit Eibar on Thursday. Diego Simeone's side are four points clear of Real Madrid with two games in hand."
4,13/01/2021,00:31,Atletico stretch Liga lead with Sevilla win,Atletico Madrid extended their lead at the top of La Liga to four points on Tuesday after a 2-0 win over Sevilla that strengthened their title credentials.,"Goals in each half from Angel Correa and substitute Saul Niguez on a freezing night following historic snowfall in the Spanish capital allowed Diego Simeone's side to increase the gap between themselves and city rivals Real Madrid. The match at the Wanda Metropolitano was one of three games in hand that Atletico had on Madrid and Barcelona, who sit a further three points back in third. Their home fixture with Athletic Bilbao at the weekend had to be postponed after Madrid experienced its heaviest snowfall in half a century. ""I'm very happy to help the team with this goal... the work pays off,"" said Saul after the win. Sevilla meanwhile stay sixth on 30 points, level with fifth-placed Real Sociedad. Zinedine Zidane's Madrid will have a tough task defending their La Liga crown on the evidence of Tuesday's display which bore all the hallmarks of a Simeone side. Kieran Trippier returned to the Atletico side after FIFA suspended the England international's 10-week ban for breaching betting rules. And the 30-year-old marked his comeback by helping Correa open the scoring in the 17th minute with a cut back that still left the Argentine with plenty of work to do as he controlled the ball in the area. Correa span quickly and got his shot off before Fernando could close him down, and his effort flashed past Yassine Bounou in the Sevilla goal. Trippier almost had another assist eight minutes later when his smart pass put Luis Suarez clean through, but Bounou did well to charge out and block the Uruguayan's close-range effort. Sevilla pushed a typically dogged Atletico but couldn't take advantage of the few chances that game their way and were punished with 14 minutes remaining by Saul's first goal of the season. The Spaniard was cool just outside the area as he collected Marco Llorente's low ball from the right before arrowing a left-footed shot into the far corner to guarantee Atletico's fifth straight league win since losing the Madrid derby last month. They will have the chance to further extend their lead at the top in a week's time when they travel to Eibar while Madrid and Barca -- who play in the in the Spanish Super Cup semi-finals this week -- are involved in the Copa Del Rey. Earlier Granada kept in touch with the European places with a 2-0 home win over lowly Osasuna. Diego Martinez side sit seventh, three points behind Sociedad and Sevilla who are in the Europa League places, thanks to goals from Colombian forward Luis Suarez and Sergio Herrera."
5,10/01/2021,18:55,Lopetegui signs new contract with Sevilla,"Sevilla coach Julen Lopetegui has extended his contract until 2024, the club announced on Sunday.","Lopetegui took over in 2019 and oversaw Sevilla qualifying for the Champions League and winning the Europa League in his first season in charge. They currently sit sixth in La Liga after a 3-2 victory over Real Sociedad on Saturday. ""It is a huge motivation,"" said Lopetegui about his new deal. ""We want Sevilla to be even bigger. It will take a lot of work to make the dream of Sevilla's fans a reality."" Lopetegui's impressive first year came after a nightmare 2018, when he was sacked as coach of both Spain and Real Madrid within five months."
6,06/12/2020,00:17,Barca take 'gigantic step backwards' but Zidane gets breathing space,"Lionel Messi's Barcelona suffered a fourth Liga defeat of the season as they went down 2-1 to Cadiz on Saturday, while Real Madrid eased the pressure on Zinedine Zidane with their first league win since October.","Barca are now a distant seventh, 12 points off leaders Atletico Madrid, who beat Real Valladolid 2-0. ""It's a gigantic step backwards for our chances to fight for La Liga, you have to see it like that,"" the Catalans' coach Ronald Koeman said. ""A points difference of 12 points with a team as strong as Atletico is enormous,"" he added. Koeman made three changes from the midweek Champions League win at Ferencvaros with goalkeeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen coming in for Neto. But Ter Stegen made a first costly error in Andalusia after eight minutes as Alvaro Gimenez claimed his second goal in as many games. The Barca defence failed to clear a corner which fell to Ter Stegen, but his weak parry onto his own line was tapped in by Gimenez. Koeman's men were all-square after 56 minutes as Jordi Alba's low cross was deflected into his own goal by defender Pedro Alcala. But Ter Stegen's second costly error came eight minutes later. Clement Lenglet made a hash of Alba's throw in before Ter Stegen failed to clear under pressure from Negredo and the former Manchester City striker claimed his third goal league goal of the campaign. Under-pressure Zidane said Madrid's scrappy 1-0 victory in Seville was significant after a testing run of results. Sevilla goalkeeper Bono guided Vinicius Junior's effort into his own net in the second half, allowing Zidane's side to take the three points and move up to third in the table, six points behind Atletico. Following two defeats in the past three games, including a 2-0 defeat to Shakhtar Donetsk in midweek that leaves Real's Champions League qualification hopes in the balance, Spanish press reports have linked former Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino and ex-Madrid forward Raul to Zidane's job. Zidane said he was satisfied with the points after a ""difficult"" time. ""These are three very important points for us. It's a well-deserved win, against a very good opponent, who can put you in trouble at any time. We got through this,"" he said. ""It has been a bit difficult lately, today we have to enjoy it, be happy, but nothing more."" Atletico, now unbeaten in 26 games in La Liga, moved to the top of the table after France international Thomas Lemar and Spain midfielder Marcos Llorente scored for Diego Simeone's men against Valladolid. Atletico are among five clubs to remain without a domestic defeat in Europe's main five leagues since the start of the season. Real Sociedad, who have lost just once in the league this term, could regain the lead if they beat Deportivo Alaves on Sunday."
7,05/12/2020,18:51,Zidane gets breathing space after Madrid benefit from goalie's howler,Zinedine Zidane had some of the pressure lifted on Saturday when an own goal from Sevilla goalkeeper Bono gave Real Madrid a 1-0 win away to Sevilla.,"Bono guided Vinicius Junior's effort into his own net in the second half, allowing Zidane's side to move up to third in the table after their first league victory since October. Since Madrid crashed to a 2-0 defeat to Shakhtar Donetsk in midweek to leave their Champions League qualification hopes in the balance, press reports in Spain have linked former Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino and ex-Madrid forward Raul to Zidane's job. Zidane made two changes from the debacle in Ukraine with Casemiro and Vinicius replacing Martin Odegaard and Marco Asensio. Ex-Madrid boss Julen Lopetegui brought back Bono into the starting lineup after he missed four games with coronavirus which included Wednesday's heavy European defeat to Chelsea. Morocco's Bono made a shaky start as his attempted clearance inside his own box was blocked by Vinicius. He made up for the error on his own line despite Karim Benzema's efforts. The former Girona keeper kept the sides equal at the break with a tidy save from Benzema's 38th minute shot, but his crucial mistake came 10 minutes into the second half. Ferland Mendy played a low cross into the area before Vinicius slid in to guide it towards the goal. Bono came out to close the space but deflected Vinicius' limp attempt into his own goal. The hosts' Suso, making his first appearance since late October, and Lucas Ocampos had late chances to equalise but Zidane's men held on for a morale-boosting win before Wednesday's crucial Champions League group game against Borussia Moenchengladbach. Later, Atletico Madrid and in-form forward Joao Felix can go above Real Sociedad and take top spot as they host Real Valladolid, while Barcelona head to Cadiz. Sociedad travel to Deportivo Alaves on Sunday."
8,20/10/2020,23:06,Chelsea kept quiet by Sevilla in goalless stalemate,Chelsea are still waiting for a £220 million ($284 million) spending spree to pay off as Frank Lampard's men began their Champions League campaign with an uninspiring 0-0 draw against Sevilla at Stamford Bridge.,"The Blues have now won just two of their opening six games of the season and the only consolation of a cagey encounter for Lampard was a rare clean sheet. With Champions League debutants Rennes and Krasnodar making up Group E, both sides were happy to settle for a point against what they will perceive as their toughest opponents in the section. Chelsea's defensive problems were exposed as they blew the lead twice to draw 3-3 for the second time in five Premier League games this season to Southampton on Saturday. But with Edouard Mendy back from injury to take the place of the error-strewn Kepa Arrizabalaga in goal, the Blues were far more solid against a Sevilla side that has lost just twice in their last 27 matches. Mendy only had one serious save to make when Nemanja Gudelj's header was deflected by Kurt Zouma and the Senegalese stopper had to react quickly to swat the ball to safety. Sevilla were without highly-rated centre-back Jules Kounde, who attracted interest from Manchester City last month, due to a coronavirus infection. However, the organised defensive structure that saw Julen Lopetegui's men beat Manchester United and Inter Milan to win Sevilla's sixth Europa League title in August kept Chelsea's expensive collection of attacking stars quiet. Timo Werner was the Blues' biggest threat, but the German wasting his best chance by skewing a shot wide with the last action of the first-half. Chelsea posed a greater attacking threat after half-time as Christian Pulisic came alive after the American was switched onto the left flank. Pulisic's run won the corner which produced the home side's best chance of the night, but centre-back Zouma placed his header straight at Bono. Joan Jordan came within inches of winning the game in spectacular style for Sevilla as his sweetly struck volley from the edge of the box dipped onto the roof of the net."
9,19/10/2020,03:45,Sevilla show Chelsea a smarter way to spend,Chelsea's huge transfer spend has so far failed to deliver the expected return on investment as Frank Lampard's men continue to leak goals at an alarming rate.,"The Blues splashed £220 million ($284 million, 242 million euros) on Timo Werner, Kai Havertz, Ben Chilwell, Hakim Ziyech and Edouard Mendy, while Thiago Silva joined from Paris Saint-Germain on a free transfer. By contrast, even the European elite were more cautious as Real Madrid did not make a single signing, Barcelona tried to offload big salaries and Leroy Sane was the only major arrival at Bayern Munich. Yet, Chelsea are far from being considered among the principal contenders as the Champions League returns this week, as Lampard has so far failed to find solutions to familiar problems from his first season in charge at Stamford Bridge. Chelsea have won just two of their opening five Premier League games of the season and twice blew the lead against Southampton on Saturday for already their second 3-3 draw of the campaign. In 43 league games under Lampard, they have now conceded 63 goals. Going forward there are signs that Werner and Havertz, who both scored their first Premier League goals at the weekend, are beginning to click, while Ziyech and Christian Pulisic will add even more firepower as they return from injury. However, another huge error from the world's most expensive goalkeeper, Kepa Arrizabalaga, cost his side against Southampton and the Spaniard may have to start against Sevilla on Tuesday with Mendy unlikely to return from injury in time. The case of Kepa illustrates the very different economic models that Chelsea and Sevilla operate. Just two years on from paying a £72 million buyout clause to sign Kepa from Athletic Bilbao, Chelsea have cut their losses by spending another £20 million on Mendy. Sevilla, on the other hand, consistently have to sell their best talent and evolve to remain a European power. The Andalusians have a better record in European competition than Chelsea over the past seven seasons despite a drastically smaller budget. That is mainly thanks to winning the Europa League four times in that period, most recently in August when they saw off Roma, Wolves, Manchester United and Inter Milan in an impressive run to the title. Even European champions Bayern needed extra-time to see of Julen Lopetegui's men in the UEFA Super Cup last month. ""Sevilla has created a parallel world of happiness for fans in these difficult times,"" Monchi, the club's renowned sporting director, told A Balon Parado this week. But in playing down hopes they can challenge for a first La Liga title since 1946 with Madrid and Barcelona not the forces they once were, Monchi highlighted the stark financial gulf Sevilla still have to bridge. ""We have in mind the moment in which we can take a jump is when we reach revenue of 300 million euros,"" he added. Revenue for the 2018/19 season without Champions League football was just 206 million euros. Chelsea have spent well more than that in one summer, but that is still no guarantee that will buy success at Stamford Bridge on Tuesday. Saturday's 1-0 defeat to Granada, when Sevilla played for half the game with 10 men was the first time Lopetegui's side had lost in 90 minutes since February. They have already drawn at the Camp Nou this season and will have no fear facing a Chelsea side that shown itself incapable of beating Southampton and West Brom."
10,25/09/2020,14:29,Bayern claim record winning streak by team from big five league,Bayern Munich calculated on Friday that victory in the European Supercup had given them the record for most consective wins by a club from one of the continent's 'big five' leagues.,"""For the Munich team it was a 23rd victory in a row,"" said the club on their website the day after Hansi Flick's Bayern team beat Sevilla 2-1 in extra time in Budapest. ""No other team from the European top five leagues has ever managed such a streak. It is therefore unique, a new record!"" Football statisticians confirmed that the longest known winning streak had been by Carlo Ancelotti's Real Madrid, with 22 straight, between September and December 2014. Bayern's run, in contrast, came at the end of a season and included a string of big matches such as the German Cup final and the later rounds of the Champions League, as well as he Super Cup. ""This deserves the utmost respect and recognition. Congratulations to the team and the whole team behind them,"" president Herbert Hainer said. The club website praised the way Bayern had won. ""Much more remarkable than this number is the way Bayern have played the during the streak. Flick's team dominated almost every opponent, no matter if they were called Chelsea, Borussia Dortmund or Barcelona."""
11,25/09/2020,00:47,"Martinez hands Bayern 'dream' UEFA Super Cup win in front of 15,000 fans","Veteran midfielder Javi Martinez admitted it was ""a dream"" to be able to write more UEFA Super Cup history for Bayern Munich on Thursday as his header in extra time sealed a 2-1 win over Sevilla in Budapest.","Having equalised with a crucial 120th-minute goal seven years ago when Bayern won the 2013 Super Cup on penalties against Chelsea in Prague, Martinez struck on 104 minutes at the Puskas Arena to hand the Champions League winners a fourth title in 2020. There were a smattering of travelling Bayern and Sevilla fans among the 15,180 crowd in Budapest as both clubs played for the first time in front of spectators since the Covid-19 pandemic first hit Europe in March. After Lucas Ocampos converted an early penalty for Sevilla, Leon Goretzka equalised for Bayern, who had two second-half goals disallowed before substitute Martinez, 32, struck from a late corner. Bayern head coach Hansi Flick praised his team for ""pulling through with their mentality. In the end, my players went through the pain barrier to win."" Having replaced Goretzka on 99 minutes, it was Martinez - linked to a return to Spain after losing his first-team place - whose header extends Bayern's winning streak to 23 games dating back to February. ""Whenever I wear the Bayern shirt, I always try to give my best and I showed that once again today,"" Martinez told Sky. ""I always want to help the team by scoring a goal. It's a dream come true. ""I'm really happy to win this trophy for a second time after also scoring in 2013."" After also sweeping the Bundesliga, German Cup and Champions League trophies, Bayern can win a fifth title this year when they host Borussia Dortmund in Munich for the German Super Cup on Wednesday. Sevilla midfielder Ivan Rakitic said Bayern goalkeeper Manuel Neuer made the difference with two superb late saves to deny Youssef En-Nesyri. ""We saw tonight how important Neuer is for them,"" said Rakitic. ""We had two great chances to go ahead, but he stopped them. ""Then we gave away a silly corner and they scored. Nevertheless, we can be proud of how we played against the best team in Europe."" Champions League winners Bayern fell behind for the first time this season on 14 minutes when the VAR judged David Alaba had fouled Rakitic in the area and Ocampos converted Sevilla's penalty. Alaba was booked for the challenge and there were nervous glances in the Germans' ranks, especially when defender Benjamin Pavard and Thomas Mueller both missed chances. Goretzka got Bayern back on level terms when Mueller and Robert Lewandowski combined in the area for the midfielder to smash home the equaliser with 34 minutes gone. It stayed 1-1 at the break, but Bayern turned up the heat on the Europa League holders. Just six minutes after the break, Lewandowski had the ball in the net after being set up by Thomas Mueller, but the VAR spotted the Poland striker was offside. With an hour gone, Bayern winger Leroy Sane was left frustrated after his shot powered past Sevilla's Moroccan goalkeeper Bono, but the VAR spotted Lewandowski had fouled a Sevilla defender in the build up. With 90 minutes almost up, Manuel Neuer underlined his status as one of the world's best goalkeepers with a finger-tip save to deny En-Nesyri after Sevilla attacked from the edge of their own penalty area. Sevilla made a great start to extra-time with Bayern in all sorts of trouble, as Ocampos had a shot blocked while En-Nesyri's shot clipped the post after crashing off Neuer's leg. However, the scene was set for Martinez, a veteran of the side which won the 2013 Champions League final in London, to add to his chapter in Bayern's folklore. ""I was so happy when the coach brought Javi on, because I know how good he is with his head from set pieces,"" said Bayern captain Neuer. ""Sevilla are a well-drilled team, it's not easy to play against them, but overall we deserved the win and can be proud of ourselves."""
12,21/08/2020,23:10,Sevilla beat Inter in thrilling final to win sixth Europa League,Sevilla won the Europa League for a sixth time as Diego Carlos's overhead kick deflected in off Romelu Lukaku 16 minutes from time to beat Inter Milan 3-2 in a thrilling final in Cologne.,"Carlos and Lukaku's evening had got off to a very different start as the defender hauled the Belgian striker down and he converted the resulting penalty to put Inter in front after just five minutes. Two Luuk De Jong headers turned the game around for Sevilla, but Diego Godin quickly levelled in a four-goal first half. However, Italy's wait for a first European trophy in a decade, and Inter's nine-year trophy drought, goes on after Lukaku could not stop Carlos's spectacular strike on another famous Europa League night for Sevilla. Antonio Conte's men will have a case that the Sevilla defender should have been sent off after just three minutes as Lukaku accelerated past him with ease on the counter-attack and was hauled to the ground by the Brazilian, who conceded an early penalty for the third consecutive game. Carlos was only shown a yellow card, but Lukaku ensured Inter were rewarded as he confidently slotted home his 34th goal of the season to equal his idol Ronaldo's record in his first season at Inter, which ended in Inter's last UEFA Cup win 1997/98. De Jong has been far from that prolific in his first season in Spain, but the Dutch international suddenly hit form at the right time as he was handed a start by Julen Lopetegui after coming off the bench to score the winner in the semi-final against Manchester United. Inter did not learn from that goal against the English giants. Jesus Navas was again the provider and when De Jong got across Godin, his diving header had too much power for Samir Handanovic. Tempers were also flaring in a pulsating first half with frequent confrontations between the benches as they tried to influence Dutch referee Danny Makkelie. Conte was booked as Inter appealed for a second penalty when Nicolo Barella chipped ball into the arm of Carlos. Sevilla upset the odds when they came from behind to beat Liverpool for the fifth Europa League title four years ago and did the same to another European giant when De Jong rose highest to loop a brilliant header over Handanovic from Ever Banega's free-kick. However, the lead only lasted three minutes as Godin made amends with a bullet header of his own as the Uruguayan became the first defender to score in a Champions League and Europa League final. Both sides had conceded just once in three games since arriving in Germany and after four goals inside 36 minutes, Conte and Lopetegui restored some semblance of order to their defences at the break. Inter were made to rue wasting the better opportunities in the second half as Navas and Carlos converged to block Roberto Galiardini's effort. Lukaku then had the chance to cap his excellent first season in Italy as he raced through on goal 25 minutes from time, but just as in the semi-final victory over United, Sevilla goalkeeper Bono produced a vital save when needed. And like so many of their previous five Europa League final victories, Sevilla conjured up a moment of magic allied with a slice of fortune they needed to again take the trophy they call their own back to southern Spain. Inter failed to clear another Banega free-kick into the box and Carlos more than made amends for some of his heavy-handed defending with an overhead kick that deflected in off the unfortunate Lukaku. Conte threw on the former Premier League trio of Christian Eriksen, Alexis Sanchez and Victor Moses in response and it was Sanchez who had the chance to make himself a hero by taking the game to extra time. But the Chilean failed to get enough purchase on his shot among a goalmouth scramble and Jules Kounde cleared off the line."
13,20/08/2020,18:14,"Only winners are remembered, Conte warns Inter","Inter Milan's progress to a first European final in a decade will not be cherished unless they beat Sevilla to win the Europa League on Friday, coach Antonio Conte has warned his players.","The Italian giants have not won any silverware for nine years, but have made big strides in Conte's first season in charge to close to within one point of perennial champions Juventus at the top of Serie A and sweep aside Getafe, Bayer Leverkusen and Shakhtar Donetsk since the Europa League's return earlier this month in northern Germany. Conte won the Champions League with Juventus as a player, but had more experience on the losing end in major finals, losing two more Champions League finals and at the 1994 World Cup and Euro 2000 with Italy. ""What I've realised is that people only remember when you win finals,"" the former Juventus, Chelsea and Italy boss said at his pre-match press conference on Thursday. ""I won the Champions League, but I lost a further four finals and the people that leave their mark on history are those that win matches and trophies. ""We should be proud we have reached a first final for 10 years, especially at a prestigious club like Inter. But history is written by the conquerors, the winners. That is added motivation for us to go out and win."" Conte has made a habit of having an instant impact. He won league titles in his first season at Siena, Juventus and Chelsea, but believes his first year in Milan has seen a more gradual improvement. ""My perception working with these players day in, day out, all of the players bought into the work and have become braver as the season wore on. ""The braver we became, the greater chances we had to bring home a big trophy like the Europa League. ""We're here now and we need to make the most of the opportunity."" Sevilla are the most successful side in Europa League history with five wins in the competition over the past 14 years. But it is Inter who are favourites in Cologne thanks to a potent striker partnership of Romelu Lukaku and Lautaro Martinez. Both scored twice in a 5-0 thrashing of Shakhtar in Monday's semi-final to take their combined tally for the season to 54 goals. Lukaku was Conte's top priority in the transfer market last summer and finally convinced the club to splash out a club record 75 million euros ($89 million) to sign the Belgian. ""I knew Lukaku very well because he's a player I'd followed for some time,"" Conte added. ""I tried many times to sign him at my former clubs. I knew the characteristics he had. ""As for Lautaro, he was a player I had admired on television, even though he hadn't played much last year. I saw his capability and his quality. ""It was inevitable that, working together, and working a lot, the understanding between the two would develop. They're players who have the typical selfishness of a forward, but also the selflessness to play for the team and help others score."""
14,20/08/2020,15:37,Sevilla's Europa League success a 'love story' for Monchi,"""No one wants it like we do,"" is how Sevilla's renowned sporting director Monchi explains how a club with modest resources is preparing for a sixth Europa League final in 14 years against Inter Milan on Friday.","The Spaniards have won the previous five, making them the most successful side in the history of European football's second most coveted trophy. ""I think the history between the Europa League and Sevilla is a love story,"" Monchi told AFP in Cologne, where the final will be held behind closed doors. ""No one cares or plans to win the Europa League like us. Inter or Sevilla can win because that is football, but the desire, the excitement that the Europa League awakens in the club, no one else achieves, because this competition is what has made Sevilla a big club."" How much it means to be back in the final for the first time since 2016 was evident in the manner in which Monchi and his staff, club directors and substitutes collaborated to compensate for the lack of supporters in the stadium for Sunday's semi-final win over Manchester United. There were perplexed looks on the United bench as they largely sat in silence compared to the wave of noise coming from those in Sevilla suits in the stands. Despite their success on the European stage over the past 15 years, Sevilla still had to bridge a huge financial gulf to beat United and will need to do so again when facing a rejuvenated Inter under Antonio Conte, who could spend 75 million euros ($89 million) on top scorer Romelu Lukaku last summer. Monchi does not have that wealth to work with but has built a reputation as one of Europe's shrewdest movers in the market, buying low and selling high the likes of Dani Alves, Ivan Rakitic, Clement Lenglet, Wissam Ben Yedder and many others. But the summer of 2019 was radical even for the former goalkeeper. After helping Sevilla to 11 trophies in 17 years as director of football, Monchi left for a new challenge at Roma in 2017. His methods were not nearly as successful in the Italian capital and less than two years later he returned home to a fanfare rarely seen for a sporting director as he was paraded in front of a full house at the Sanchez Pizjuan. A huge rebuild ensued with 17 new players arriving over the course of the summer and winter windows and even more leaving, including top scorers Ben Yedder and Pablo Sarabia. There was also a new coach as Julen Lopetegui took his first role since being sacked by Real Madrid just months after also being fired by Spain for taking the Madrid job just days before the start of the 2018 World Cup. However, the combination of Monchi's return and Lopetegui's redemption has not only seen Sevilla past Roma, Wolves and United since the Europa League resumed earlier this month, but also secured a place in the Champions League for the first time in three seasons after finishing fourth in La Liga, level on points with Atletico Madrid. ""For me the key this year has been Lopetegui,"" added Monchi. ""The boss has been capable of knitting together a completely new squad in little time and getting the best out of every one of them. ""I know him and he doesn't like to look back. He looks to the present and the future. He is happy at the club and we are very happy with him. It has been a perfect marriage."" Given his experience in Italy, the huge turnaround in players and a season that was stopped for three months due to the coronavirus pandemic, Monchi concedes this is the final that gives him the most satisfaction of all. But even for the kings of this competition, one huge hurdle awaits in an Inter side that smashed Shakhtar Donetsk 5-0 in their semi-final and finished just one point behind Juventus in Serie A. ""The level of the teams is much higher now,"" continued Monchi, comparing to Sevilla's first win in the competition in 2005/06. ""In the semi-finals of the Champions League there was Leipzig, Lyon, PSG and Bayern. In the Europa League with Manchester United, Inter and Sevilla, there were more European titles. That's why victory means even more because it gets harder every time."""
15,20/08/2020,03:10,"Discarded by Spain and Real Madrid, Lopetegui finds salvation at Sevilla","Two years on from the embarrassment of being sacked as coach of his country on the eve of a World Cup, Julen Lopetegui has rebuilt his reputation to take Sevilla back to a sixth Europa League final in 14 years.","The Spaniards' success in Europe's second-tier competition is no longer a surprise despite the continued churn of players and coaches without the wealth of the continent's superclubs. However, a return to the Europa League final for the first time since 2016 on top of a first top-four finish in La Liga for three seasons, is sweet vindication for Lopetegui after a nightmare few months in 2018 threatened to derail his coaching career. Hopes were high that the former Real Madrid and Barcelona goalkeeper could produce one last hurrah from Spain's golden generation that had won three major tournaments from 2008 to 2012 ahead of the World Cup in Russia. Spain were unbeaten in Lopetegui's 20 games in charge of the national team, including impressive wins over Argentina, Italy, Belgium and eventual world champions France. But he paid a heavy price for his own misjudgement and the politics of Spanish football as he accepted the role as Zinedine Zidane's successor at Real Madrid days before the tournament got underway. Furious Spanish federation president Luis Rubiales fired him two days before Spain's opening match against Portugal in a move that did neither side much good. Lopetegui returned home a haunted figure as he was presented at the Santiago Bernabeu just a day later and Spain limped out on penalties to Russia in the last 16 after winning just one match in four. The decision to take the Madrid job was even more misguided as Lopetegui lasted just 14 games and was sacked again by late October. Sevilla offered a shot at redemption, but also came with a risk. Monchi's return as sporting director kicked off a huge turnover of the playing staff as 17 new players arrived and 28 departed over the course of the season. Among those to leave were top scorers Wissam Ben Yedder and Pablo Sarabia and replacing them has proved problematic with Lucas Ocampos and Munir El Haddadi the only players to reach double figures for goals this season. But Lopetegui has constructed a hard team to beat as is evidenced by a club record run of 20 games without defeat either side of a three-month shutdown due to coronavirus. Only Real Madrid and Atletico Madrid had a better defensive record in La Liga this season and Bruno Fernandes's penalty in the semi-final is the only goal Sevilla they have conceded in three knockout games since arriving in Germany against Roma, Wolves and Manchester United. ""There are always doubts until you really know the coach,"" Monchi told Marca. ""Julen has pleasantly surprised me. Everyone told me that he was very professional and he's won me over. When I see someone like him I fall in love, so I'm very happy to work with him."" The team-spirit Lopetegui has fostered was clearly on show during the semi-final as Sevilla rode their luck, but showed no little heart to beat United 2-1 with a fraction of the budget of the English giants. Despite the empty stands in Cologne, Sevilla were roared on by an enthusiastic crowd of substitutes, team directors and staff compared to the largely silent and bemused United contingent. ""We know we have created our own strong and loud support,"" said Lopetegui of the encouragement from the sidelines. ""It was been a difficult but also a beautiful year,"" he added on a first season in Seville that is now into its 13th month. ""The team has had the possibility to grow, overcoming obstacles, because of their hard work, solidarity and team spirit."" Sevilla will need to be the better unit again in Friday's final against another European giant with better individuals in Inter Milan. But after five wins in five previous finals, Sevilla can never be underestimated in the Europa League."
16,17/08/2020,00:25,Solskjaer eyes signings as Sevilla punish wasteful Man Utd,Ole Gunnar Solskjaer admitted Manchester United face a busy few weeks in the transfer market after losing a third semi-final this season as Sevilla reached the Europa League final by coming from behind to win 2-1 in Cologne.,"United were made to pay for their profligacy in front of goal after Bruno Fernandes's early penalty put them in front. Suso quickly levelled for Sevilla before goalkeeper Bono kept them in the game and substitute Luuk De Jong continued the Spanish side's remarkable Europa League run in recent years by slotting home the winner 12 minutes from time. United had already secured their place in the Champions League next season by finishing third in the Premier League, but an over-reliance on a small core of players was again exposed as Solskjaer did not make a single substitution until three minutes from time. United's new Premier League campaign could now begin in just over four weeks time and initial talks over the signing of Jadon Sancho have stalled with Borussia Dortmund insisting the England international will remain in Germany next season. ""We need to strengthen the squad depth of course. It will be a long season,"" said Solskjaer. ""I cannot say when or if transfers are going to be done, but we are looking at it. It is a quick turnaround. We just have to be 100 percent sure when we do those deals."" Sevilla have now won 25 of their last 26 Europa League knockout ties and will believe they are destined to win the competition for a sixth time when they face Inter Milan or Shakhtar Donetsk in Friday's final. ""This is the best Manchester United of the last few years and the form team in England so it is normal that we had to suffer,"" said Sevilla boss Julen Lopetegui. ""We are very excited for the final, but it will be the hardest game yet and we have to prepare."" Lopetegui is enjoying a renaissance in Seville after a tough couple of years when he was sacked as Spain coach on the eve of the 2018 World Cup for accepting the role as Real Madrid manager and then fired again just months into his time at the Santiago Bernabeu. Sevilla are now unbeaten in a club record 20 games, but were unsettled by the pace and movement of United's front four early as Marcus Rashford was wiped out by Diego Carlos after his initial effort was saved by Bono. Fernandes has ensured United's early season woes from the spot are long forgotten as the Portuguese converted his eighth penalty for the club and the 22nd the Red Devils have been awarded in a 13-month long campaign. Sevilla grew back into the game and levelled with a fine team goal on 19 minutes. On-loan Real Madrid left-back Sergio Reguilon is in demand from a host of top European clubs and his run opened up the United defence before his cross was swept home by former Liverpool winger Suso. Despite the lack of a crowd in Cologne there was no lack of passion or tension as Sevilla were roared on by their substitutes, staff and directors and tempers flared with both benches exchanging words. ""It is one of the curiosities of this situation (playing behind closed doors),"" added Lopetegui. ""The support of your teammates is important."" United rode out the Sevilla storm and had a host of chances early in the second half to go back in front but a combination of Bono, poor finishing and brave last-ditch defending kept them at bay. Anthony Martial was the biggest culprit as three times the Sevilla's second-choice stopper denied the Frenchman one-on-one as United began to cut through Sevilla at will. Lopetegui responded by sacrificing top scorer Lucas Ocampos for De Jong and his changes worked to perfection as Sevilla regained their composure before landing the sucker punch. De Jong has had a difficult first season in Spain, but went a long way to redeeming himself as he was alive to turn home former Manchester City winger Navas's cross with the United defence sleeping, which led to a confrontation between Fernandes and his teammate Victor Lindelof."

18,15/08/2020,17:47,Fernandes wants trophies to back up Cantona comparisons,Bruno Fernandes wants Manchester United to learn from the pain of two semi-final defeats already this season to cap the Portuguese's transformational impact on the club by winning the Europa League.,"United, who lost to Manchester City and Chelsea in the last four of the League Cup and FA Cup earlier in the campaign, face five-time winners Sevilla in the first semi-final on Sunday behind closed doors in Cologne. Fernandes did not arrive at Old Trafford until after the League Cup exit to City in January and has made a massive difference to drag United into the Premier League top four and secure a place in the Champions League next season. The former Sporting Lisbon midfielder's impact has earned comparisons to Eric Cantona, who led United to a first league title in 26 years after joining from Leeds in November 1992. ""For me Cantona was an amazing player for the club. I need to do much, much better to be compared to him,"" said Fernandes. ""For me coming to Manchester is about winning trophies. I will be happy if we win the Europa League. ""It is time to step up for big players. You have to have 100 percent focus. We have learnt it is very painful to lose a semi-final."" Fernandes has flourished where other big-money signings have floundered as United have failed to win a league title since Alex Ferguson's retirement in 2013 despite spending nearly £1 billion ($1.3 billion) in transfer fees. But the Portuguese international, who has scored 11 goals and provided eight assists in 21 appearances, said his own £55 million price tag was a source of confidence rather than a burden. ""When a club pays for a player £55 million you have confidence,"" he added. ""All the conversations I had with my coach and my teammates has helped me. When you have that voice on your own back telling you to do your own game it is easier for you."" United have had six days to prepare for the semi-finals after Fernandes's extra-time penalty saw off FC Copenhagen 1-0 in the last eight. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer welcomed the extra rest, but is wary that the drawn-out format of the competition to not clash with the Champions League latter stages in Lisbon will give his side precious little preparation time for next season. The 2020/21 Premier League season is due to get underway in four weeks, although clubs still in European competition have been assured they will get at least a 30-day break. ""We have had a few good days preparing, recovering and training. It's not very often we have six days between games, so we are ready,"" said Solskjaer. ""It's almost a pre-season for next season because it is not very long before we have to get going again. ""It's just the time we are in. We can't complain because this is the world we are in now."""
19,15/08/2020,03:01,Europa League no longer a consolation prize for European giants,"The Europa League may not be able to match the riches and glamour of the Champions League, but the presence of Manchester United and Inter Milan in the semi-finals is further evidence that Europe's giants are increasingly taking the competition seriously.","United and Sevilla, who face off in Sunday's first semi-final, have already benefited from the introduction of a place in the Champions League for the Europa League winners in 2015, but with Ukranian champions Shakhtar Donetsk facing Inter in the other semi-final on Monday, all four sides remaining have already secured their places in the Champions League next season. Instead, it is the prestige of a European trophy and prize money that is driving the ambitions of the semi-finalists despite the eery atmosphere with all games behind closed doors in northern Germany. ""I think it's so important to win because every player needs to understand how it is to win a trophy for Manchester United,"" said Bruno Fernandes, whose extra-time penalty saw the English giants squeeze past FC Copenhagen in the quarter-finals. ""I think if we finish with a trophy, it will not be perfect, but it will be a good year for us because Manchester United needs to come back again to win some trophies and fight for the European competitions."" United have not won a trophy since they lifted the Europa League for the first time in 2017. Sevilla are the kings of this competition, winning it five times since 2006, but have not claimed any silverware since they last lifted the Europa League in 2016. Inter have made giant strides towards closing the gap to Juventus in Antonio Conte's first season in charge, but are also seeking their first trophy since 2011. The presence of United and Inter means there will be more previous Champions League winners in the Europa League semi-finals than UEFA's premier club competition in Lisbon. But European football's governing body has peaked the interest of the continent's biggest clubs with increased prize money in the Europa League in recent seasons. Spanish and English clubs have combined to win the competition for the past eight years. The 560 million euros ($660 million) distributed among clubs in the Europa League is still just a quarter of the 2 billion euro pot for the Champions League, but provides a significant financial boost, particularly with the coronavirus pandemic squeezing clubs' finances on matchday income. Chelsea pocketed 46 million euros for winning the competition last season, whilst those dropping into the Europa League from the Champions League as Inter and Shakhtar did this season stand to win even more. Sevilla have been the biggest beneficiaries of the laissez-faire attitude of some clubs to the importance of the Europa League in the past. The Spanish side defeated Middlesbrough, Espanyol, Benfica and Dnipro in the first four of their five final victories before outgunning Liverpool four years ago. Shakhtar also took advantage when they became only the second Ukrainian club to ever win a European trophy by beating Werder Bremen in 2009. Both are shining examples how smart player trading can bridge an economic gap to the continent's super clubs, but every season the rebuild gets harder as the likes of United and Inter's financial muscle allows them to scoop up the best talent. Only three of the Sevilla starting line-up that knocked United out of the Champions League two years ago will be part of Julen Lopetegui's squad on Sunday. Next season Lucas Ocampos, Sergio Reguilon and Diego Carlos will likely follow the pathway of Dani Alves, Ivan Rakitic, Clement Lenglet and many others in securing a big move after starring at the Sanchez Pizjuan. But they will hope to sign off with another victory in the competition Sevilla call their own. ""It's brought us a lot of joy"" said Sevilla captain Jesus Navas, who himself left for Manchester City in 2013 before returning for a second spell at his hometown club. ""Given the difficult times we're all experiencing, being able to win the Europa League for the fans and all of us would be really great."""
20,11/08/2020,22:59,"Sevilla down Wolves, Shakhtar thump Basel to reach Europa League semis","Sevilla qualified for the semi-finals of the Europa League on Tuesday after Lucas Ocampos' late header broke Wolverhampton Wanderers' hearts, while Shakhtar Donetsk thumped Basel 4-1 to join the Spaniards in the last four.","Five-time competition winners Sevilla face Manchester United in Cologne on Sunday thanks to a brilliant header from Argentine Ocampos with less than two minutes left on the clock which gave them a deserved 1-0 win, while Shakhtar take on Inter Milan on Monday in another intriguing tie. Sevilla dominated their English opponents over the course of the match, as a tired-looking Wolves' dreams of European glory ended with a whimper. ""I am very proud of my players. We needed to have lots of patience against a very good team,"" said Sevilla coach Julen Lopetegui, whose team are now unbeaten in 19 matches in all competitions, to BT Sport. ""We have ambition we work very hard... but we are going to play against Manchester United... the biggest team in world football."" Premier League outfit Wolves thought they were set to make the perfect start in the 11th minute when Adam Traore set off on a sensational surge towards goal from his own half and was chopped down in the area by Diego Carlos. However Raul Jimenez, who had scored all of his previous eight penalties for Wolves, sent a weak spot-kick towards Yassine Bounou, who could hardly believe his luck as he batted the Mexican's tame shot aside. There were claims that Bounou had left his line while Sevilla players seemed to enter the area before the penalty was taken, but in any case that was to be Wolves' last shot on target of the match as chances became hard to come by. Sevilla though began to take a stranglehold on the play and force Wolves back into their own half. However they struggled to carve out many clear-cut opportunities, with Wolves' defence managing to snuff out their opponents when they did manage to break free. The first good chance of the second half came when Jules Kounde met Suso's beautifully flighted cross in the 66th minute, but the Frenchman had to stretch for the ball and sent it looping over the bar. Eleven minutes later Rui Patrico did well to tip over Ever Banega's dipping free-kick as Wolves began to rock, but the goalkeeper could do nothing to stop Sevilla's winner with two minutes left. Banega was again at the heart of the action, whipping in a fizzing cross that Lucas Ocampos did brilliantly to guide into the bottom corner and send his team into the semis. In Gelsenkirchen Shakhtar booked their spot in the last four with a commanding win over Basel that will give Inter Milan something to think about ahead of their semi-final clash on Monday. ""I'm feeling amazing because we have worked hard and we trust we can reach the final,"" said goalscorer Junior Moraes. ""If you want to test yourself, you have to play against teams at this high level."" The Ukrainian side got off to a flyer thanks to Brazil-born Moraes, who headed home Marlos' corner with less than two minutes on the clock, and they never looked back from that point on. Taison put Shakhtar two ahead 20 minutes later when his deflected shot flashed past Basel's bamboozled goalkeeper Dorde Nikolic. Alan Patrick put the result beyond doubt from the penalty spot with 14 minutes left after Taison's burst into the box was ended by a clumsy challenge from Basel defender Yannick Marchand. Shakhtar rounded off a fine display in the 88th minute when right-back Dodo combined with Tete before smashing home a superb finish. Ricky van Wolfswinkel's close range strike for Basel a minute into stoppage time made no difference to a thumping defeat for the Swiss."
21,10/08/2020,20:10,Wolves want Europa League win for injured Jonny,Wolves manager Nuno Espirito Santo and midfielder Ruben Neves say the serious knee injury suffered by Spanish defender Jonny will inspire them in Tuesday's Europa League quarter-final against Sevilla.,"The 26-year-old wing-back was ruled out of Wolves' European campaign after damaging his cruciate knee ligament in Thursday's last-16 1-0 home win over Greek side Olympiakos which sealed a 2-1 aggregate victory. ""Jonny is an amazing player for us, he's a fantastic boy, we wish him all the best and know he will be with us in spirit,"" said Nuno in Duisburg on Monday. ""We want to play for Jonny, he's one of us, and we will do our best to give him the win,"" added Neves. Wolves are through to the club's first European quarter-final since 1972, when they went on to lose the UEFA Cup final to Tottenham. Their current campaign has spanned 13 months due to the coronavirus pandemic. Five-time winners Sevilla, who lifted the trophy three seasons running between 2014 and 2016, will pose their biggest test to date. ""We know they have won the tournament before but it's different now with just one leg,"" Neves said. ""It will be like a final for us and Sevilla."" Neves admitted that Wolves are short of experience on the European stage, but hungry for success. ""It was our goal since the restart of the Europa League to be in Germany playing in the final eight. ""We achieved it, but we don't want to stop here. ""We know it will be hard but we're ready."" With temperatures in Duisburg around 30 degrees Celsius, Neves dismissed the notion that the heat could help Sevilla, who are used to such conditions. ""That's maybe the only thing they are ahead of us on,"" said Neves. ""They are used to playing in this weather, in the UK we don't have it, but we're professionals and will be ready to play, rain or shine."" The Portugal midfielder also said he wants to get one over Sevilla coach Julen Lopetegui, who gave him his professional debut as a teenager in 2014 at Porto. ""I can't lie, he's a very special coach for me and gave me a chance when I was 17 years old,"" said Neves. ""Tomorrow, of course, I will want to beat him, but I am also thankful to him."""

Sevilla cruised past Roma 2-0 in a one-off Europa League game played at neutral Duisburg, which will one of the host grounds when the Rhineland region of Germany hosts the last three rounds of the competition from August 10-21. At Molineux, Bobby Allain, the visitors' Franco-Scottish goalkeeper, failed to control a back pass in the seventh minute. Daniel Podence, who scored for Olympiakos at Tottenham in September but moved to Wolves in January, darted in and stole the ball. Allain clumsily bundled his former clubmate over and Jimenez converted the penalty. The Greek champions, who had drawn at Tottenham in the Champions League and won at Arsenal in the Europa League this season, responded by dominating possession. They created a string of chances but were thwarted by good saves by Rui Patricio, a tight offside decision and their own inaccurate finishing. Wolves, who began their Europa League campaign on July 25 last year against Crusaders in the second qualifying round, will next face Sevilla at Duisburg on August 11. ""A long, long season,"" Jimenez said. ""Now we are in the quarter-finals and we want to keep going."" Sevilla were also in Duisburg on Thursday where they took the lead against Roma after 22 minutes.

""We've got to accept that Sevilla were superior,"" said Roma coach Paulo Fonseca. In Basel, defender Fabien Frei scored the only goal in the 88th minute as the home team won 1-0 to complete an aggregate 4-0 victory over Eintracht Frankfurt. In Leverkusen, Moussa Diaby scored the only goal after 51 minutes to complete a comfortable victory for Bayer, who won 3-1 in Glasgow in March. ""We had the chances to score one or two more times tonight and in the rounds to come we have to make sure that we're more clinical,"" said Leverkusen captain Lars Bender.

In both games temperatures were hovering around 33 degrees Celsius at kick off. Sevilla and Roma met in Duisburg, a neutral venue, because the first leg in Sevilla on March 12 was called off. The coronavirus pandemic cost each team a player. Roma were deprived of on-loan centre back Chris Smalling, recalled by Manchester United after the Serie A season ended on August 1. Sevilla were without Serbian midfielder Nemanja Gudelj, an ever-present in the competition this season, who is in quarantine after testing positive for COVID-19 The Spaniards had the advantage of a 17-day break after the end of La Liga.

Reguilon surged past two defenders and into the box before sliding a low shot past Spanish goalkeeper Pau Lopez's foot. Roma did not create a dangerous chance until the 34th minute when Nicolo Zaniolo pounced on a loose ball but fired over. They managed just one shot on target in the match. Sevilla added a second on the counter-attack in the 43rd minute. Lucas Ocampos burst down the right. After Lopez failed to cut out the low cross, Youssef En Neysri finished into an empty net from close range.

""Seeing what we've done in the last two rounds, it's going to be very difficult to win this league,"" said a despondent Pique afterwards. ""From what I've seen, it's very hard to see Real Madrid dropping points."" Sevilla, in third, and Valencia, in eighth, always looked capable of shifting the dynamic at the top of the table, with Madrid capitalising to climb back to the summit for the first time since they beat Barcelona on March 1. Asked about Pique's analysis, Barcelona coach Quique Setien said: ""I think it comes from frustration. I am optimistic. I think it will be tough for anyone to take maximum points."" A valuable point for Sevilla, meanwhile, gives them a five-point cushion over Getafe in fifth, albeit having played a game more. Barca could have few complaints at the Ramon Sanchez Pizjuan. They never really troubled Sevilla for any prolonged period and the closest Lionel Messi came to scoring the 700th goal of his career were a pair of free-kicks tipped over. The sight of goalkeeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen jogging up for a late corner demonstrated how big a blow they considered dropping points to be. Yet Real Sociedad are still in the hunt for Champions League qualification and will offer Madrid no guarantees on Sunday while games against Getafe, Athletic Bilbao and Villarreal mean there are still plenty of hurdles for Zidane's team to overcome. Barcelona though would appear to have the tougher run-in, with Athletic Bilbao, Atletico Madrid, Villarreal and local rivals Espanyol coming up. Messi was well-contained by Sevilla and it could be the Argentinian was feeling the effects of a third consecutive 90 minutes in nine days. Setien chose not to rest his captain in either of two comfortable wins over Leganes or Real Mallorca. Instead, Antoine Griezmann dropped to the bench, with Martin Braithwaite preferred in the front three alongside Messi and Luis Suarez, who made his first start since January after recovering from a knee injury. Sevilla's Jules Kounde shot just wide of the post early on but Barcelona controlled the opening 30 minutes, even if chances were few and far between. Messi's curled free-kick was headed off the line by Kounde and Braithwaite almost had a tap-in when Tomas Vaclik spilled, but the ball was hacked away. The half ended with a scuffle and Messi was at the heart of it, squaring up to and then pushing over Sevilla's centre back Diego Carlos. Messi was unhappy with Carlos' challenge on Suarez but escaped punishment. Ever Banega came on at half-time for Sevilla and gave them more purpose in midfield. Munir El Haddadi's shot from the angle was palmed away by Ter Stegen. The game opened up in the final 15 minutes as Jordi Alba made a crucial block to prevent Munir's pass setting up an easy finish in the middle. Alba might then have teed up a winner too but Suarez swept the defender's pull-back over the bar. Sergio Reguilon, on loan at Sevilla from Madrid, had the best chance but he failed to connect with his weaker right foot. Earlier, Gerard Moreno's winner gave Villarreal a 1-0 win away at Granada, putting them within touching distance of the top four. Real Mallorca claimed a 1-1 draw against fellow strugglers Leganes thanks to a stunning late free kick from Oscar Rodriguez."
27,18/06/2020,20:33,Celta capitalise on emergency signing rule to bring in Nolito,Nolito joined Celta Vigo on Thursday after the club used Spain's emergency signing rule to replace an injured goalkeeper with a striker.,"Celta capitalised on the same rule that allowed Barcelona to buy Martin Braithwaite from Leganes in February after they activated Braithwaite's release clause. ""This new signing for the last stage of this season could not arouse greater excitement,"" read a statement from Celta. With goalkeeper Sergio Alvarez suffering a long-term knee injury, Celta were given permission to make a signing outside the transfer window. But instead of buying a back-up goalkeeper, they agreed a deal with Sevilla to sign Nolito, the former Manchester City striker, who has 16 caps for Spain. Nolito played more than 100 matches for Celta before leaving in 2016 for City and joining Sevilla a year later. Celta will hope the 33-year-old can give them a timely boost in their battle against relegation from La Liga. They sit 17th, two points above the bottom three, with a crunch game at home to Alaves to come on Sunday."
28,15/06/2020,21:50,Late own goal sees Sevilla stutter in Champions League chase,Sevilla suffered a setback in their bid to qualify for next season's Champions League group stage as a late own goal by Diego Carlos allowed visiting Levante to grab a 1-1 draw on Monday.,"Julen Lopetegui's side, who sit third in La Liga, hold a five-point lead over fifth-placed Getafe, although most of their closest rivals still have to play in this round of matches. The five-time Europa League winners, who last played in the Champions League in 2017-18, are four points clear of fourth-placed Real Sociedad, with Atletico Madrid, Valencia, Granada and Villarreal also in the top-four hunt. The closest either side came to goal in the first period was when visiting winger Munir El Haddadi's brilliant free-kick crashed against the crossbar. Sevilla did take the lead in the first minute of the second half, as former Barcelona player El Haddadi teed up Dutch striker Luuk de Jong to score his sixth league goal of the season. Levante managed to create some late pressure and centre-back Carlos put through his own net three minutes from time after a mix-up with goalkeeper Tomas Vaclik. The draw helped 12th-placed Levante move 10 points clear of safety with nine matches to play. Later on Monday, Roberto Soldado rescued Granada a 2-2 draw at Real Betis in a dramatic game which saw three goals in the final six minutes. The away side looked set to move within three points of Sociedad as they led late on through Carlos Fernandez's 29th-minute strike, but Sergio Canales equalised from the spot with five minutes to play, before Cristian Tello put the hosts in front. Former Spain striker Soldado had the final say though, as the 35-year-old substitute snatched a point in injury time which moved Granada above Villarreal into eighth."
29,12/06/2020,00:25,La Liga resumes after three months away as Sevilla defeat Betis,"Sevilla beat local rivals Real Betis 2-0 as La Liga returned after three months away on Thursday, becoming the second of Europe's five major leagues to resume following the coronavirus pandemic.","After the Bundesliga in Germany restarted on May 16, La Liga opened its doors again to players but not supporters at the Ramon Sanchez Pizjuan, where the usually vibrant Seville derby was played in front of empty stands. The game was the first in Spain's top flight since March 10 but 93 days later another professional fixture has been completed without incident, offering further encouragement to the Premier League in England and Serie A in Italy. Both are set to return next week. Lucas Ocampos gave Sevilla the lead from a 56th-minute penalty and Fernando Reges then added the second goal for the home side, who are third in the table. This was the first leg of a 39-day sprint to the finish in La Liga, that will see teams playing every three days for five and a half weeks and undergoing stern examinations of their fitness. Both coaches made use of their new allocation of five substitutes and there was a drinks breaks in each half but the contest lost its fluency late on, in part because Betis never looked like staging a comeback. Victory strengthens Sevilla's hold on third place as they move four points above Getafe and Real Sociedad below them. Betis sit 12th and face the possibility of being dragged into a relegation battle. This was as far from a typical Seville derby as could be imagined, a pale shadow of the division's most heated fixture and a clear demonstration of what has been sacrificed to keep the season going. ""I always believed we would play again,"" said La Liga president Javier Tebas, who had also indicated on Thursday that ""10 or 15 per cent"" of fans could attend stadiums before the season finishes on July 19. For now though, stands remain empty, the voices of the players and coaches audible and the atmosphere strange. On television, fans at home had the option to add virtual supporters taken from the computer game FIFA, as well as chanting, which ebbed and flowed according to the action. When the excellent Ocampos and Fernando scored, there was cheering, and when substitutes came and went, there was applause. Earlier, the players had arrived wearing masks and gloves and their temperatures were taken before entering the stadium. Outside, around 200 supporters had come to greet the team buses but they dispersed shortly after, with 600 police and security personnel in attendance to prevent mass gatherings. ""No fans allowed but we're here and we can't wait,"" shouted a 60-year-old supporter in a Sevilla shirt. There was a minute of silence held before kick-off in memory of the victims of the pandemic, with the players standing at a distance from each other around the centre circle. In the 20th minute, there was applause to pay tribute to those working on the front line. In the stands, the substitutes, still wearing masks, sat spread out in the rows behind their coaches and Sevilla's were among the few celebrating when the goals flew in shortly after half-tiime. They were comfortable winners as Ocampos scored a penalty after Marc Bartra was ajudged to have pushed Luuk de Jong and, six minutes later, a delightful Ocampos flick at the near post allowed Fernando to head in a second."
30,11/06/2020,03:30,Silent night as La Liga restarts with Seville derby,Sevilla and Real Betis is the game in Spain most defined by its fans and on Thursday it will be a first glimpse of La Liga without them as the season resumes behind closed doors after three months away due to the coronavirus.,"Fireworks, banners, plumes of smoke and crowds, delirious at the sight of a team bus, let alone a goal, the Seville derby is a fixture renowned for its intensity and cherished by its supporters. There will be 110 games held in 39 days, with clubs playing every three days for five and a half weeks, but none for the rest of the season will be as much of a stark reminder of what is missing. ""We can't wait to return to competing,"" said Sevilla coach Julen Lopetegui on Wednesday. ""In circumstances that three months ago were unimaginable but today it is the reality and we have to adapt. ""The derby is going to be played and we all know what it means. We have to respond."" At the Ramon Sanchez Pizjuan, where Sevilla had only lost two league games this season in front of their fans, the stands will be empty, except for officials and substitutes, who will be strecthed out across rows to maintain social distancing. For those watching on television at home, the stands can be full, with virtual faces planted in place of vacant seats and fake crowd noise, taken from the computer game FIFA, ebbing and flowing according to the action. La Liga's hope is to pitch the restart as a celebration. ""Volver es Ganar"", has been the league's slogan, ""To Return is to Win"", and there is excitement around football's return, to go with the relief in recent weeks as the number of deaths and infections have fallen. Spain has recorded more than 27,000 deaths overall and remains one of the worst-hit countries in the world by coronavirus. But there were 48 new infections on Monday, the lowest since lockdown was declared by the government and down from as many as 10,000 towards the end of March. Sport resuming adds to the sense that the crisis is now under control but the differences in Seville could also be a sobering demonstration of Spain's ""new normal"". All players will arrive wearing masks and gloves and have their temperatures checked before entering the stadium. In total, only around 270 people will be allowed inside while outside, 600 police and security personnel will remain in operation until hours after the final whistle. Their remit will be to ensure fans do not gather together in large groups, fill up small areas or congregate on the same streets. A perimeter fence will be in place to keep them at a distance from the stadium. ""It is very important that they pay attention to what is asked of them,"" said Betis coach Rubi. ""It will be the only time in their life that this will happen. They have to live it 100 per cent but while respecting the rules."" The football will be the same, albeit with five substitutes allowed instead of three and two drinks breaks permitted to take into account the possibility of extreme heat this summer. Sevilla cannot afford a slow restart either given they sit at the front of a tight queue of clubs aiming to overtake them and finish in the top four. One point behind are both Real Sociedad and Getafe. Atletico Madrid are two points back in sixth. Betis have not entirely given up on European qualification themselves although it will take a formidable run to close a nine-point gap on seventh-placed Valencia, who host Levante on Friday. ""We are not going to make any excuses about the unusual circumstances, the lack of fans or the small amount that we have trained,"" said Rubi. ""This is the situation. We have to face it."""
31,31/05/2020,23:38,La Liga to restart with Seville derby on June 11,"The Spanish top-flight football season will restart on June 11 with the derby between Sevilla and Real Betis, La Liga confirmed on Sunday.","The first round of games following the coronavirus shutdown will be played over four days, with leaders Barcelona at Mallorca on June 13 and Real Madrid at home to Eibar the next day. The following matchday will run from Monday, June 15 to Thursday, June 18. Barcelona will host Leganes on June 16 while Madrid take on Valencia in the capital two days later. The Spanish Sports Council released a statement Friday saying that the Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) and La Liga had agreed the format for the 11 remaining rounds in the top two Spanish divisions. La Liga said the season should be completed by July 19. ""We want next season to start September 12,"" La Liga president Javier Tebas told Movistar. ""We have designed the schedule to give each team at least 72 hours of rest between matches... We will update the schedule two matchdays at a time to take into account the weather conditions, which are known two weeks in advance."" Barcelona led Real Madrid by two points at the top of the table when the season was halted in March."
32,15/04/2020,21:45,CAS orders Sevilla to pay Nancy slice of Lenglet transfer,"Sevilla have been ordered by the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) to pay Nancy 3.7 million euros ($4.04 million) from the transfer of Clement Lenglet to Barcelona, the French club said on Wednesday.","The Ligue 2 club released a statement saying on April 14, CAS upheld a decision by FIFA last July, which ordered Sevilla to pay part of the original fee plus interest and costs. When they sold 24-year-old Lenglet to Sevilla for 5 million euros in January 2017, Nancy negotiated a sell-on clause for 12 per cent of any transfer profit. The second tier outfit's statement explained that when the France defender moved to Barca in July 2018 for a fee of ""more than 35 million euros"", Sevilla argued that because Lenglet had activated a release clause he had not been sold but released. But CAS, like FIFA, ""considered that Sevilla FC could not use this release clause as an excuse to avoid its obligation to pay."" Nancy, who have a budget of around 15 million euros this season and were 12th in Ligue 2 when the season was interrupted by the coronavirus pandemic, said Sevilla had 45 days to pay."
33,08/04/2020,12:47,Sevilla join top La Liga clubs in slashing wage bill,Sevilla said Wednesday they planned to join Barcelona and other top Spanish clubs in slashing players' wages by up to 70% in response to the coronavirus pandemic.,"With Spain's La Liga suspended indefinitely and club income sharply reduced, Sevilla said their decision would affect first team players as well as other playing staff and back room staff. That means ""a reduction of 70% of working hours for staff and men's and women's first team players and the reserves,"" the club said, adding that players had agreed to the terms. Sevilla join Barcelona, Espanyol and other top clubs in taking advantage of a government scheme known by its initials ERTE that authorises salary cuts by up to 70 per cent in extreme circumstances. La Liga, which estimates that clubs stand to lose around one billion euros if the season is not resumed, backs the move by clubs hoping to minimise the economic consequences of the virus. Javier Tebas, La Liga president, said Tuesday he expected most Spanish clubs to slash wage bills in the coming days. ""When we are working in the short-term with these measures applied to players, this is to save the future of football,"" he said. ""That is what the players have to take into account."" With 146,690 COVID-19 cases and 14,555 deaths as of Wednesday, Spain stands behind Italy as Europe's second worst-hit country."
34,29/03/2020,04:00,"Isolated in foreign lands, footballers learn to deal without the game","The riches, glamour and glory of playing football in front of packed stadiums attracts the world's top players across borders but with the European game in lockdown, many have been left isolated from their families.","Coronavirus has forced governments across Europe to impose swingeing restrictions on travel and personal freedoms. Footballers' daily routines have been upended with no games to play for the foreseeable future and training sessions now conducted alone at home or via video-conferencing to maintain some semblance of team spirit. ""It is a way to keep in contact with each other, to start a little bit of routine because I think that is important,"" said Brighton manager Graham Potter, who has his squad doing communal morning sessions via video. ""Our guys are all here in the UK. That is why it is important for us to keep in contact and regular dialogue and make sure everyone is alright. ""They are away from families, they are missing families and that is something we understand. We sympathise with that, but we felt it was right to limit international travel and to stay at home and be safe."" Other clubs allowed their stars to jet home. Paris Saint-Germain's Neymar and Thiago Silva returned to Brazil and Edinson Cavani headed to Uruguay before France went into lockdown. By contrast, Chelsea's Spanish winger Pedro Rodriguez was stuck in London as he and the rest of the Blues squad were forced into self-isolation when teammate Callum Hudson-Odoi tested positive. ""It's hard not to be able to see my children,"" Pedro Rodriguez, whose children live in Barcelona, told Spanish radio station Cadena SER. ""I imagine there are many people like me. ""I tell them to stay in the house and that I miss them."" Birmingham boss Pep Clotet sent his family back to Spain before a state of emergency was declared in his homeland, but remained in England to do what work he could. ""I am caught between two worlds,"" said Clotet. ""I feel I cannot do my job properly. I keep thinking 'Maybe I should go back?' But I cannot go back because I am working."" For others, the greatest concern is filling time and the void left by no football. ""I am obviously a little bored since two weeks have passed since the beginning of the quarantine at home,"" Juventus' Polish goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny told Sky Sport Italia. ""I am alone in Turin because my family went to Poland. Having said that, however, I must say that I am having a peaceful time. I sleep a lot."" The unexpected downtime is even allowing some players accustomed to globe-trotting extra quality time with their nearest and dearest. Sevilla midfielder Ever Banega has spent the vast majority of his playing career in Spain, but the 65-time capped Argentine international is used to hopping back and forth across the Atlantic to represent his country. ""It's strange because there is always football on. When La Liga stops, there are international games. Even in the summer, there is football with pre-season games,"" Banega told AFP. ""You miss a lot of moments with your loved ones. Now what I am mostly doing is taking advantage of the time with my kids, my wife, enjoying the family time."" No one knows how long European football's unprecedented stoppage will last, with leagues still hoping to complete a truncated season when it is safe to do so. When it does, players will return with a fresh appreciation for why they travel far and wide to play the game. ""You wake up and you don't know what to do,"" said Celtic's French defender Christopher Jullien. ""Right now it is just a different life. You realise how life is like every day without football. I miss football."""

""More details from UEFA soon,"" the team from the Italian capital said ahead of their last 16, first leg game scheduled for Thursday. Another Italian team, Inter Milan are also due to host Spanish team Getafe on Thursday in the San Siro. But Getafe president Angel Torres said Tuesday his team would not travel to Italy. Spanish authorities on Tuesday suspended all direct flights between Spain and Italy from Wednesday March 25. Italy has been hit hardest of any European nation by the COVID-19 outbreak with 631 deaths, while 47 have died in Spain from more than 2,000 infected. A raft of matches will be played behind closed doors on the continent in the coming weeks, with Roma's fellow Italians Atalanta cruising into the last eight of the Champions League in Valencia's empty Mestalla stadium on Tuesday. Spain's La Liga will play matches in front of no fans for two weeks, while Serie A has been suspended until April 3 as Italy goes into lockdown in an attempt to slow the outbreak."
36,16/01/2020,15:37,Sevilla sign Morocco international En-Nesyri,"Morocco international forward Youssef En-Nesyri has joined Sevilla on a deal that runs until 2025, the La Liga club announced Thursday.","Sevilla did not reveal the transfer fee but reports in Spain indicated it was around 20 million euros ($22.3 million). En-Nesyri moved to Leganes from Malaga in August 2018 and scored 15 goals in 53 matches, becoming the club's leading scorer in the top division. The 22-year-old was called up by Morocco for the 2018 World Cup and scored in a 2-2 draw against Spain in the group stage. He also appeared at last year's Africa Cup of Nations, where he struck twice in four games before Morocco crashed out to Benin on penalties in the last 16. His arrival comes after the departure of Israeli forward Munas Dabbur to Hoffenheim earlier this month."

Kjaer had been on loan at Serie A club Atalanta since last September but had played just six times for the Bergamo side. He also previously played for Italian clubs Palermo and Roma. Kjaer has captained Denmark since 2016, scoring three goals in 95 appearances."
38,03/01/2020,23:21,Sevilla slip again after draw against Bilbao,Sevilla gave Barcelona and Real Madrid the chance to pull further clear in La Liga's title race after they began the year by drawing 1-1 at home to Athletic Bilbao on Friday.,"Bilbao took an early lead through Ander Capa at the Ramon Sanchez Pizjuan and while an own-goal from Unai Nunez brought Sevilla level on the hour, the home side were unable to find a winner. It means Sevilla trail Real Madrid, who they play at the Santiago Bernabeu on January 18, by two points and Barcelona by four. Those gaps will grow on Saturday if Madrid win away at Getafe and Barcelona overcome local rivals Espanyol. With Atletico Madrid struggling for goals and Valencia still recovering after removing their coach, Sevilla have looked like the team most likely to challenge Spain's established duo. But after an encouraging run of form in October and November, Julen Lopetegui's side have managed only one win from their last four league matches. Qualification for the Champions League may soon be the best they can hope for, which would be no mean feat after they signed 13 players and sold 15 last summer, as well as hiring a new coach. Athletic Bilbao are in the hunt too. They sit seventh, three points behind fourth-placed Atletico Madrid, who play at home to Levante on Saturday. Gaizka Garitano's side took the lead in the 15th minute after an excellent control and finish from Capa, with Kenan Kodro finding the net again shortly after only for the goal to be ruled out for offside. Sevilla turned the screw in the second half. Jesus Navas, making his 500th appearance for Sevilla, almost set up an equaliser only for Luuk de Jong's finish from six yards to come back off the post. The home did level with half an hour left. Lucas Ocampos drove to the line and his cross was turned in by Nunez at the near post."
39,07/11/2019,21:19,"Man Utd ease into last 32, Celtic down Lazio to progress","Teenager Mason Greenwood scored as Manchester United cruised into the Europa League last 32 with a 3-0 win over Partizan Belgrade at Old Trafford on Thursday, while Celtic stunned Lazio with a last-gasp goal in Rome to progress.","Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's United knew that a third victory in four Group L games would be enough to send them through. The 18-year-old Greenwood broke the deadlock in the 22nd minute with a cool finish to score his third goal of the season and second in this competition. Anthony Martial doubled the advantage after the half-hour mark with a brilliant individual goal, before Marcus Rashford lashed home the third four minutes after the interval. The comfortable victory saw United bounce back after a 1-0 loss at Bournemouth last weekend had ended a three-game winning run. AZ Alkmaar thrashed Astana 5-0 in Kazakhstan to keep control of the race for second place in Group L behind United, eliminating their hosts and moving four points clear of Partizan. Olivier Ntcham scored a dramatic injury-time winner to grab Celtic a 2-1 victory at Lazio. Neil Lennon's outfit remain top of Group E with two games remaining, seven points clear of third-placed Lazio after their second straight win over the Romans. ""It's great to have qualified with two games to spare,"" Celtic manager Lennon told uefa.com. ""It's too early to say how far we can go in this competition but we can be a difficult opponent for anyone."" Ciro Immobile volleyed the hosts into a seventh-minute lead, but James Forrest drew Celtic level before half-time. But substitute Ntcham latched onto Odsonne Edouard's pass in the fifth minute of added time and dinked a cool finish over Lazio goalkeeper Thomas Strakosha. ""Realistically we have very little chance of qualifying. But never say never in football,"" said Lazio coach Simone Inzaghi. The other game in the group saw CFR Cluj move to within a point of qualification by beating Rennes 1-0 in Romania. Celtic's Old Firm rivals Rangers gave their hopes of reaching the knockout stage for the first time since 2011 a massive boost with a 2-0 victory over Porto at Ibrox. Second-half goals from Alfredo Morelos and Steven Davis fired Steven Gerrard's men second in Group G, three points ahead of Feyenoord after the Dutch side's 1-1 draw with Young Boys. Bundesliga leaders Borussia Moenchengladbach grabbed their first win of the Europa League campaign as Marcus Thuram's 95th-minute strike sealed a 2-1 triumph against Roma. The German club moved second in Group J, ahead of Roma on head-to-head and two points behind leaders Istanbul Basaksehir, who saw off 10-man Wolfsberger 3-0 in Austria. Wolves made it three straight Europa League wins despite Ruben Neves missing a penalty as Raul Jimenez's 92nd-minute goal grabbed a 1-0 success over Slovan Bratislava at Molineux. Nuno Espirito Santo's men now sit five points clear of Slovan in second in Group K, with Braga a point ahead of the Premier League side at the top after beating Besiktas 3-1. Former Barcelona winger Munir El Haddadi starred with a hat-trick as Sevilla thrashed Dudelange 5-2 to also reach the knockout rounds. Record five-time winners Sevilla knew victory in Luxembourg would send them through from Group A and their one-sided win also sealed top spot. Dudelange are still in contention to progress despite sitting bottom of the group, one point behind APOEL and Qarabag after the Cypriot side's 2-1 win in Nicosia. PSV Eindhoven, the 1978 winners, suffered a humbling 4-1 defeat by Austrian team LASK Linz to slip to third in Group D behind their opponents and Sporting Lisbon, who won 2-0 at Rosenborg. Elsewhere, Espanyol moved to the brink of qualification by hammering nine-man Ludogorets 6-0, while Gent moved top of Group I with a 3-1 win at Wolfsburg."
40,02/11/2019,23:24,Real and Atletico fail to capitalise after Barca stunned by Levante,Real Madrid and Atletico Madrid each passed up the chance to go top of La Liga on Saturday after Barcelona conceded three goals in seven minutes during a surprise 3-1 defeat by Levante.,"Lionel Messi converted a first-half penalty at the City of Valencia Stadium for his sixth goal in five games only for Levante to stun the defending champions with an incredible treble shortly after the hour. Yet Atletico and Sevilla played out a 1-1 draw at the Ramon Sanchez Pizjuan, where Diego Costa missed a penalty, before Real squandered a string of opportunities at the Santiago Bernabeu in a goalless draw against Real Betis. It means Barca will be relieved to stay at the summit - ahead of Atletico by a point with a game in hand and in front of Real on goal difference - even if their collapse against Levante should offer encouragement to their title rivals. Meanwhile, Granada will overtake them all if they beat Real Sociedad on Sunday. ""Everything unravelled,"" said Barcelona coach Ernesto Valverde. ""We didn't start the second half well, we weren't creating chances and although they weren't either they suddenly scored two goals. The third one hurt us a lot."" Jose Campana and Borja Mayoral scored in the 61st and 63rd minutes before Nemanja Radoja added a third in the 68th to leave their disheveled opponents with too much to do. After seven wins on the bounce in all competitions, Barca arrived in Valencia as overwhelming favourites, particularly given the irresistible form of Messi, whose goal was the 500th of his career with his left foot. ""Opponents always play us like it is one of the biggest games of the year,"" Valverde added. ""You have to have an answer."" After any Barcelona defeat, Valverde's future is a topic for discussion. Asked if he was surprised by his players or might consider resignation, he said: ""No, to both questions."" To make matters worse, Luis Suarez was forced off in the 41st minute with an injury to his right calf and would now appear to be a doubt for Tuesday's Champions League game at home to Slavia Prague. An unfortunate half for Suarez had seen him booked for a foul committed by Arthur Melo but referee Hernandez Hernandez corrected his error after being made aware by VAR. Messi swept home his penalty after Jorge Miramon brought down Nelson Semedo and Messi might have made it two, but this time Miramon restored some credit by clearing off the line. Levante began the second half on the front foot but nobody could have predicted what was to follow. First, Pique's under-hit clearance was punished, as Mayoral and Jose Luis Morales shifted the ball inside to Campana, who struck hard into the corner. Then a loose Carles Perez header allowed Mayoral space and he did brilliantly to curl past the outstretched right hand of Marc-Andre ter Stegen. With the home fans still celebrating, Radoja made it three. Barcelona again failed to clear and Radoja's effort might have been saved had Sergio Busquets, on as a substitute, not caused a cruel deflection. Messi thought he had launched a comeback when he bundled through and poked in but Antoine Griezmann was offside and Levante might even have made it four late on if Gonzalo Melero been more precise. It left Real Madrid, Atletico and Sevilla all with the chance to claim top spot but none seized the initiative. Real are yet to establish a consistent run of results, even if they created more than enough chances to beat Betis and on another day might have scored five. Eden Hazard saw a much-needed goal ruled out and Sergio Ramos went close too before Karim Benzema skewed wide at the back post from four yards. The best opportunity fell to Ferland Mendy but, with only Joel Robles to beat, he lifted his finish up, over and wide. Hazard had waved Mendy through and might have wondered why he did not take the ball himself. Betis rode their luck, particularly when Zouhair Feddal handled in the box, while Vinicius Junior and Ramos hit the goalkeeper amid mad scrambles in injury-time. Atletico will also rue chances missed, with Costa most guilty, his 72nd-minute penalty saved by Tomas Vaclik after Alvaro Morata cancelled out Franco Vazquez's opener."
41,07/10/2019,00:03,Classy Barca run riot against Sevilla to give La Liga familiar look,Barcelona are back in form and La Liga's big three are back at the top of the table after the defending champions put on a finishing masterclass to thrash Sevilla 4-0 on Sunday.,"Lionel Messi scored his first goal of the season by curling in a brilliant free-kick at Camp Nou after three goals in eight minutes from Luis Suarez, Arturo Vidal and Ousmane Dembele had already put Sevilla out of sight. ""It was crucial for us,"" said coach Ernesto Valverde whose team ended the game with nine men. ""It has been a strange start to the season and we have not added all the points we would have wanted."" Suarez launched the flurry, his stunning left-footed bicycle kick arguably even better than the volley he scored in the Champions League win over Inter Milan on Wednesday. Vidal then finished a superb passing move that involved all 11 Barca players and Dembele powered through to make it three before Messi added a fourth in the second half. The match descended into farce late on as Barcelona's debutant Ronald Araujo was sent off and Dembele followed after collecting a second yellow card for dissent. The referee's report said Dembele was dismissed for calling Mateu Lahoz ""very bad"". He could now miss the Clasico on October 26. ""Dembele's is a mystery,"" said Valverde. ""It is very difficult to get words out of him in Spanish, so what he said couldn't have been very long."" By then, the game was long gone as victory pushed Barcelona up to second in the table, two points behind Real Madrid and one above Atletico, who could have done with some of the Catalans' classy finishing in their goalless draw away at Real Valladolid. For all the turbulence and scrutiny on Valverde and Zinedine Zidane, Barca and Madrid head into the international break not only as the league's two frontrunners but with confidence and momentum too. Eden Hazard scored his first goal for Madrid in their 4-2 win over Granada on Saturday and Barca's star man is off the mark as well after his own injury-interrupted start to the season. This was Barcelona's fourth consecutive victory. Messi's return has increased the pressure on Antoine Griezmann, who was left out of the starting line-up following his quiet display against Inter. Dembele was preferred on the left of the front three. Sevilla, who drop to sixth, had eight shots to Barcelona's seven in the first half but were three down at the break. Luuk de Jong is yet to score since his move from PSV Eindhoven last summer and the 29-year-old had four excellent chances to break his duck, three of them before Barca had taken the lead. He fired Lucas Ocampos' pull-back straight at Marc-Andre ter Stegen, sidefooted wide and mistimed a header. In the second half, Arthur lost possession on the edge of his box but still De Jong could not capitalise, lashing his shot against the post. In between, Barca had already made him pay. Suarez's effort was probably the pick of the trio in terms of difficulty, as he launched himself into the air, turned and threw his weaker left foot over the ball, and banged it into the net. Five minutes later it was two, this one a team goal, quite literally, as all of Barca's players touched the ball in 85 seconds of build-up. Arthur's cross was the 25th pass, finding the sliding Vidal who was just onside. The third three minutes later was about pace and power, and a mistake from Sevilla too, as Arthur robbed Fernando Reges. Dembele raced clear, fooled Diego Carlos with a dummy shot, before guiding the ball into the far corner. After his fourth miss, De Jong was taken off and Messi went close after a barnstorming run. The only surprise was that he had not yet scored and he fixed that in the 78th minute after Sevilla gave him a third attempt at a free-kick. This time he did not miss. The 20-year-old defender Araujo had come on for his debut in the 73rd minute and was sent off in the 87th for tugging down Javier Hernandez as Barcelona's last man. Dembele then saw red after picking up a second yellow card for dissent. Atletico's stalemate means they have managed only two wins from their last seven games in all competitions and they could even have lost if Valladolid's Sandro Ramirez had not skied a first-half penalty. Diego Simeone's side managed only one shot on target. Valladolid sit 13th, with two wins from eight games."
42,03/10/2019,23:36,Martinelli stars for Arsenal in Europa League as Man Utd toil,"Arsenal teenager Gabriel Martinelli scored twice to spark a 4-0 rout of Standard Liege in the Europa League group stage on Thursday, while Manchester United stuttered to a goalless draw against AZ Alkmaar.","Martinelli, 18, headed in superbly to give last year's runners-up Arsenal the lead on 14 minutes at the Emirates Stadium before adding a quick-fire second barely two minutes later. The Brazilian was making just his second start for the Gunners since joining the club in July. He also struck twice on his full debut against Nottingham Forest in the League Cup. Joe Willock fired in a third for a youthful Arsenal on 22 minutes and Martinelli set up Dani Ceballos on the hour to wrap up another comfortable win in Europe as Unai Emery's side moved on to six points at the top of Group F. ""The team had a great performance. It's a very important win for us,"" defender Hector Bellerin told BT Sport, praising the dedication shown by Martinelli. ""He keeps his head down, he works really hard, he is doing what the coach wants him to do and it shows on the pitch. Everyone is really pleased for him."" Arsenal are three points clear of both Standard and Eintracht Frankfurt, who beat Vitoria Guimaraes 1-0 in Portugal. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's United again struggled in attack and failed to muster a single shot on target with the club still searching for a first away win since March. United are winless in 10 games away from home -- a run that has seen them score just five times. ""The conditions were tough but I thought we did very well. It puts us in a good position,"" said Solskjaer. ""If you get your draws away from home and win the home games, you'll be fine."" Academy product Brandon Williams was handed his first start for United, who saw teenager Mason Greenwood denied by a superb block from Ron Vlaar on 30 minutes. The game was played in The Hague, on an artificial surface described as ""one of the worst"" by Solskjaer, after a storm damaged Alkmaar's home ground in August. United rarely threatened with substitute Jesse Lingard firing wide although Solskjaer reacted in disbelief when Marcus Rashford appeared to be chopped down in the penalty area. ""It's a penalty 101 times out of 100,"" said the Norwegian. Owen Wijndal and Oussama Idrissi forced David de Gea into a couple of smart saves late on as the draw left United level on four points in Group L with Partizan Belgrade, who won 2-1 away to Astana. Steven Gerrard's Rangers conceded an injury-time goal in a 2-1 loss at Swiss side Young Boys. Colombian forward Alfredo Morelos put Rangers ahead just before half-time, but Young Boys levelled through Roger Assale and Christian Fassnacht grabbed a 93rd-minute winner. Feyenoord claimed a 2-0 home victory over Porto in a clash of former European champions in the other match in Group G. Celtic gained a degree of revenge on CFR Cluj, the Romanians who ousted them in the third qualifying round of the Champions League, as Odsonne Edouard and Mohamed Elyounoussi scored in a 2-0 win in Glasgow. Wolves, in their first European campaign since 1980, rebounded from an opening loss to Braga as Willy Boly's stoppage-time goal earned them a 1-0 win at Besiktas. ""It's huge for us. We don't want to make up the numbers, we want to compete to win,"" said Wolves captain Conor Coady. Espanyol forward Wu Lei became the first Chinese man to score in a major European competition as his side beat CSKA Moscow 2-0. Austrian debutants Wolfsberg drew 1-1 at home to Roma in Group J, while Javier Hernandez grabbed the only goal as five-time champions Sevilla overcame APOEL of Cyprus. Azerbaijani club Qarabag beat Dudelange 4-1 in a game that was interrupted in the first half when a drone carrying a flag from the disputed separatist region of Nagorno-Karabakh flew over the pitch in Luxembourg. PSV Eindhoven defeated Rosenborg 4-1, while Lazio came from behind to beat Rennes 2-1."
43,29/09/2019,23:19,Sevilla edge out Real Sociedad in five-goal thriller,Sevilla avoided a third consecutive defeat in La Liga and stopped high-flying Real Sociedad from going top after coming from behind to beat them 3-2 on Sunday.,"After Real Madrid's stalemate against Atletico on Saturday, the Basque outfit could have leapfrogged both to claim first place in Spain but came up short in a pulsating contest at the Ramon Sanchez Pizjuan. It looked good for the visitors when Mikel Oyarzabal gave them a fourth-minute lead but Nolito equalised for Sevilla with a sumptuous half-volley before Lucas Ocampos and Franco Vazquez completed the comeback in the second half. Portu still set up a nervy finish when he added a second for Real Sociedad in the 87th minute but Sevilla held on for a much-needed win, after consecutive losses to Real Madrid and Eibar this week. After signing 12 new players in the summer, Sevilla have gelled impressively quickly and they now sit sixth, just two points off the top. Their credentials for keeping pace with the leaders will be tested next weekend, when they play away at defending champions Barcelona. Real Sociedad have been arguably the surprise side of the season so far, having already beaten Atletico Madrid and with Martin Odegaard, the 20-year-old on loan from Real Madrid, back in form. They are fifth after seven games played, level on points with both Sevilla and Barca. Sevilla were undone early as Adnan Januzaj won the ball back and freed Oyarzabal, who finished for his fourth goal of the season. The lead barely lasted even quarter of an hour though as Julen Lopetegui's side hit back with a brilliant goal of their own. Ever Banega's superb pass picked out Nolito at the back post and he took the ball on the half-volley, guiding it inside the far corner. Banega was again involved for Sevilla's second shortly after half-time as his quick free-kick allowed Ocampos to weave his way through while Vazquez made it three with a smart finish from six yards. Sevilla should have been home and dry but la Real had already hit the post through Jordan and pulled one back when Portu made the most of Odegaard's pass. Sevilla held on."
44,26/09/2019,23:06,Sloppy Sevilla surrender two-goal lead away at Eibar,Sevilla threw away a two-goal lead and with it the chance to go second in La Liga as they lost 3-2 to Eibar on Thursday.,"Julen Lopetegui's side could have climbed above Atletico Madrid but instead slipped to their second consecutive defeat after conceding three times in 16 minutes at Ipurua. Lucas Ocampos gave Sevilla an early lead, finishing through the legs of Mark Dmitrovic in the 11th minute before Oliver Torres made it two with just over half an hour played. But Eibar stormed back after the interval with goals in the 66th, 77th and 82nd minutes. The first was a penalty, converted by Fabian Orellana. Pedro Leon then capitalised on some poor defending from Sevilla goalkeeper Tomas Vaclik and Diego Carlo to equalise. Cote completed a remarkable comeback by scoring from a free-kick. Defeat leaves Sevilla seventh in the table and needing a response on Sunday against Real Sociedad, who did jump up to second after continuing their excellent start to the season with a 3-0 win over Alaves. Sevilla bought 12 new players in the last transfer window but la Real may have the signing of the summer in Martin Odegaard, who has moved to Anoeta on loan until the end of the season from Real Madrid. Odegaard joined Madrid aged just 16 in 2015 but has struggled to live up to the hype. Now 20, the Norwegian appears to be finding his feet, the highlight of his display against Alaves was a jaw-dropping assist for Mikel Oyarzabal's opener. After picking the ball up on the right, Odegaard drifted away from one opponent and threaded a remarkable pass inside two more for his team-mate to poke home. Willian Jose's second and a third from the impressive Oyarzabal, this time from the penalty spot, secured a convincing win for Imanol's side, before Alaves midfielder Manu Garcia was sent off with five minutes to play. Elsewhere on Thursday, Celta Vigo drew 1-1 at home to Espanyol as Santi Mina scored a 90th-minute equaliser for Celta to cancel out an opener from Adria Pedrosa."
45,20/09/2019,02:25,Sevilla await weakened Real Madrid at Liga summit,Both Barcelona and Real Madrid travel to Andalusia this weekend in search of precious Liga points after stuttering form in Europe and in their domestic campaigns as table-toppers Sevilla await Zinedine Zidane's injury-stricken outfit.,"Real, thrashed in the Champions League by PSG midweek, face a daunting challenge to regroup at Sevilla, while Barcelona go to an unlikely mountain stronghold to face plucky Granada. Led by Julen Lopetegui, sacked by Spain on the eve of last year's World Cup for accepting a job at Real, the coach will have extra motivation to prove himself after flopping in the Madrid hot-seat. His current charges are on ten points from four matches, but Real can climb above them Sunday with an away win. ""Being top means nothing,"" Lopetegui said last week. ""But it does tell us the team is doing things well."" Sevilla did well again in the Europa League on Thursday coming back from a marathon trip to Baku with a 3-0 win at Qarabag. Real have lost on their last four visits to the Ramon Sanchez Pizjuan, and on six of their last seven trips there. Big-money signing Eden Hazard struggled on his first start for Real on Wednesday as the team failed to muster a single effort on target despite presence of Karim Benzema, James Rodriguez and Gareth Bale. ""It's complicated if you are not strong and don't get into the rhythm,"" said Zidane, under mounting pressure in his second spell at the club. Madrid goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois immediately turned his attentions on their trip to Seville. ""We're all in the same boat. We sink or swim together and we have a big match on Sunday, and that is what we need to focus on,"" said Courtois. ""We need to forget this defeat, it is hard but we have another game on Sunday and we need to focus on that,"" added Zidane. It may be stretching it to say his position is under threat at the moment, but another defeat this weekend might change that, and a derby away to Atletico awaits a week later. Lionel Messi is in line for his first league start of the season after he came on late at Borussia Dortmund in Europe in midweek. The Argentine wizard, who mised the beginning of the campaign with a calf injury, was unable to lift his team past the Germans, who held on for a 0-0 draw in their Champions League opener. Barca fans will hope his partnership with new signing Antoine Griezmann and Luis Suarez can revive memories of the fearsome attacking trident that lost much of its lustre following the 2017 sale of Neymar. With their stadium nestled in the Sierra Nevada not far from the ancient Alhambra fortress promoted, Granada are punching above their weight this season as their coach Diego Martinez admitted after last week's win at Celta Vigo. ""If you had told me when the calendar came out we'd have seven points already, I'd have thought you very optimistic,"" he said. 7 - After a determined comeback to draw 2-2 with Juventus in midweek, second-placed Atletico Madrid host Celta. Diego Simeone's men are unbeaten in seven home games with Saturday's opponents since the Argentine took charge. 7 - The number of goals scored by Sergio Ramos against Sevilla. The Madrid central defender has struck more often against his former club than any other side. Fixtures (all times GMT)"
46,15/09/2019,18:30,Jordan free-kick fires Sevilla to top of La Liga,Sevilla moved to the top of the early La Liga table on Sunday as Joan Jordan's brilliant free-kick helped them seal a 1-0 win at Alaves.,"Julen Lopetegui's side continued their excellent start to the campaign, remaining unbeaten and moving a point clear of Atletico Madrid, who lost 2-0 at Real Sociedad on Saturday, at the summit. Sevilla host Real Madrid next Sunday in a meeting of two sides yet to taste defeat. ""That means nothing (being top),"" said Sevilla coach Lopetegui, whose team next face a marathon trip to Baku to play Qarabag in their Europa League opener on Thursday. ""The only thing that (being top) tells me is that the team is doing things well. We have to keep improving before going to Baku, where they will make it very difficult for us."" It was a first defeat of the season for Alaves, who slipped to 11th in the standings. Lopetegui, who joined Sevilla for his first job since being sacked in quick succession by both Spain and Real Madrid, saw one of his close-season signings produce the game's defining moment. Midfielder Jordan, who arrived at Sevilla from Eibar for a reported 14 million euros ($15.62 million), curled home a wonderful free-kick in the 37th minute which flew into the top corner to give him his second goal of the season. The visitors comfortably saw out the match to claim their third league win this term, as Alaves failed to muster a shot on target. Elsewhere on Sunday, Robert Ibanez's 81st-minute equaliser kept Osasuna unbeaten after a 1-1 draw at Valladolid, while Granada moved up to seventh with a 2-0 success at nine-man Celta Vigo and Espanyol won at Eibar. Real claimed a 3-2 win over Levante at the Santiago Bernabeu on Saturday, when reigning champions Barcelona eased to a 5-2 victory against Valencia, with 16-year-old Ansu Fati scoring inside two minutes."
47,02/09/2019,12:58,Sevilla sign Hernandez from West Ham,"Mexican striker Javier Hernandez has joined Sevilla from West Ham on a three-year deal, the Spanish club announced on Monday.","""Sevilla FC and West Ham United have reached an agreement for the transfer of Javier Hernandez, known as 'Chicharito',"" Sevilla wrote in a statement. ""The striker has signed a three-year contract."" Hernandez's prospects of playing at West Ham had worsened after they bought Sebastien Haller from Eintracht Frankfurt in July. The 31-year-old also had less than a year left on his contract. ""The club would like to thank Chicharito for his contribution and wish him all the best in his future career,"" a West Ham statement read. Hernandez, who previously played for Manchester United and Leverkusen, is Mexico's all-time leading scorer with 51 goals in 108 appearances. The 31-year-old returns to La Liga where he played for Real Madrid for a season in 2014-15. He also reinforces Sevilla's attack after Wissam Ben Yedder was sold to Monaco and Pablo Sarabia to Paris Saint-Germain this summer. Sevilla have made a good start to the season under new coach Julen Lopetegui, with two wins and a draw from their opening three games."
48,22/07/2019,03:48,Liverpool fall 2-1 to Sevilla in Fenway friendly,"Alejandro Pozo delivered the late dagger in 10-man Sevilla's 2-1 friendly win over Liverpool in Boston Sunday, a defeat made worse for the European champions when they saw Yasser Larouci stretchered off.","Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp was furious at Joris Gagnon's outrageous kick at an on-rushing Larouci in the 76th minute. Gnagnon was shown a straight red card after sweeping one of the Frenchman's legs out from underneath him, toppling him to the pitch where his head bounced hard on the ground. ""(It's) much too early in the season to create headlines with saying the things I think about the situation,"" Klopp said at his post-match press conference, where he added that it appeared that the 18-year-old Larouci was ""lucky"" in terms of avoiding serious injury. ""But of course, how it always is with these things we have to wait a little bit. I don't know 100 percent. It looks like he was lucky but I only spoke quickly to the Doc and that's what he said, but we have to see."" Even with the La Liga outfit reduced to 10 men, Liverpool were unable find a way ahead, and Pozo sealed it in the 90th minute as he smoothly collected a pass from Munir El Haddadi, rounded Liverpool keeper Simon Mignolet and knocked the winner into an unguarded net. Sevilla had enjoyed by far the majority of scoring chances on a sweltering evening at Fenway Park -- home of the World Series Champion Boston Red Sox. Both Liverpool and the Red Sox are owned by groups led by John W. Henry. Players were granted water breaks in the hot, humid conditions, and even the pitch created on the baseball diamond received extra water during the match. The pro-Liverpool crowd weren't treated to many of the club's stars as Brazilian internationals Roberto Firmino and Alisson were both absent for the Reds following their Copa America campaign along with Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mane, both missing due to the African Cup of Nations. As in a 3-2 defeat to Borussia Dortmund on Friday in Indiana, there was some shaky defending from Liverpool. Nolito's powerful shot in the 37th minute past Liverpool starting goalkeeper Andy Lonergan -- who was at Middlesbrough last season -- was Sevilla's reward after a half-hour of pressure. It needed a sprawling save from Lonergan in the 13th minute to deny Luuk de Jong after Liverpool lost possession in their own territory and de Jong was just wide with a header in the 23rd. Liverpool's equalizer came off a scrappy set piece as Trent Alexander-Arnold's corner was kept alive by Nat Phillips, the ball falling to an unmarked Divock Origi who swept in from close range in the 44th. Both teams made wholesale changes at halftime, but even a match that was just one more step in both team's pre-season preparations there was nothing laid back about Sevilla. A foul was called on Ever Banega for a hard tackle in the 12th minute and when he slammed the ball to the ground in protest he was shown a yellow card. Liverpool midfielder Harry Wilson took a smack to the face just before halftime -- an infraction that paled in comparison to that of Gnagnon -- who was arguing with the referee as Larouci received treatment. ""Harry got a knock on his jaw and a finger in his eye, so not too cool,"" Klopp said. ""He should be OK as well but couldn't carry on as well."""
49,01/06/2019,13:33,Former Spain striker Reyes killed in car crash,"Former Arsenal, Real Madrid and Spain star Jose Antonio Reyes has been killed in a car crash, his hometown club Sevilla said on Saturday. He was 35.","Reyes, who shot to fame at Sevilla before a switch to Arsenal, followed by spells at Real and Atletico Madrid, was on the books with second-tier Spanish club Extremadura. ""We couldn't be confirming worse news. Beloved Sevilla star Jose Antonio Reyes has died in a traffic collision. Rest in peace,"" Sevilla, where he spent two four-year spells, said on Twitter. The emergency services in Andalusia and the authorities in the player's home town, Utrera, said Reyes died in an accident on the main road from Sevilla to Utrera. They said another member of his family also died and a third person was injured. Spain captain Sergio Ramos, who is also from the province of Seville, came through the youth team just after Reyes and later played with him at Real Madrid also tweeted his grief. ""Broken. Shattered,"" wrote Ramos. ""I have no words. All the affection for the family. We will always remember you, my friend! RIP brother."" Reyes won a European under-21 title with Spain in 2002 and went on to play 21 times for Spain between 2003 and 2006, scoring four goals. He won Premier League and FA Cup medals at Arsenal and came on as a late substitute when the Gunners lost the 2006 Champions League final to Barcelona. He helped Sevilla win the Spanish second division in his first stint at the club. He won the Europa League five times, twice with Atletico Madrid and three times in his second spell at Sevilla. He also won domestic league titles with Real Madrid and Benfica. After leaving Sevilla in 2016, Reyes played for Espanyol, Cordoba and Xinjian Tianshan in China, before arriving at Extremadura this year as a free agent. ""With broken hearts we announce the news of our player Jose Antonio Reyes' death in a car crash and we ask for you to pray for his soul,"" Extremadura said. Monchi, who overlapped with Reyes as a player at Sevilla and is now the club's director of football, also tweeted his sadness and referred to wingback Antonio Puerta, who died of a cardiac arrest playing for Sevilla in 2007. ""Impossible news to believe, impossible to digest, that hard my God,"" wrote Monchi. ""What a left flank you are going to make, Antonio and you, up there."""
50,17/05/2019,02:15,Valencia seek perfect end to remarkable recovery in La Liga,Valencia lost to Arsenal in the Europa League semi-finals but hold pole position for La Liga's last Champions League spot as the race for the top four reaches its climax on Saturday.,"Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang's hat-trick ended Valencia's hopes of qualifying by lifting a trophy and their chances looked slim in the league too, when they trailed Getafe by three points ahead of the penultimate weekend. But a 3-1 win over Alaves, combined with Getafe losing away to a wounded Barcelona, means it is Valencia with their fate in their own hands, as they prepare to face Real Valladolid at Jose Zorrilla. A superior head-to-head over Getafe means they need only match the result of Jose Bordelas' side, who host a Villarreal team sitting 14th and with little left to play for. Yet Valladolid's position appears in Valencia's favour too. Victory away at Rayo Vallecano last weekend means their safety is already secured. Win, and Valencia will be guaranteed Champions League football in consecutive seasons for the first time in seven years, a feat that not too long ago seemed almost unthinkable. After five games, they were 15th and still to win. After 10, they were 14th, having won once and scored seven goals. After 15 games, they had won three but were back in 15th, ground to a halt by nine draws. When Marcelino was appointed in 2017, he was the club's 12th coach in five years and only one of them -- Nuno Espirito Santo -- had overseen enough matches to make even one full league season. Most waited for the trigger to click but Marcelino stayed and after 10 draws in 13 games, they won, coming from behind in the Copa del Rey to beat Segunda B side Ebro, who had a man sent off after 29 minutes. ""There was this click,"" said striker Kevin Gameiro in an interview with AFP this month. ""And there was also a bit of luck."" Defeats by Girona, Juventus and Real Madrid tempered hopes of a recovery but in between came three victories in a row and after, five games unbeaten, including a Champions League win over Manchester United. Eighth in the table at the start of the year, Valencia then surged through March and April, 10 wins thrusting them within sight of the top four. ""The word surrender does not exist in my vocabulary,"" said Marcelino. They stumbled again, twice, defeated last month by Atletico Madrid and Eibar, the resurgence almost evaporating in the space of four days. But their rivals wobbled too as Getafe lost their nerve and Sevilla faded, the bounce from bringing in Joaquin Caparros to replace Pablo Machin proving short-lived. Sevilla's decision to act has them lying sixth, needing to win at home to in-form Athletic Bilbao on Saturday and needing both Valencia and Getafe to lose. Valencia's decision to persevere may be about to pay off, a top-four finish the perfect boost ahead of the Copa del Rey final on May 25 against Barcelona, who will be without Luis Suarez and perhaps goalkeeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen. ""The spirit of the team has merged with the spirit of Valencia, which is always: never give up,"" said striker Rodrigo earlier this month. For Getafe, the Europa League would be a disappointment, even for a team who were promoted to the top flight only two years ago and whose annual wage bill is more than ten times less than Real Madrid, the club they hope to finish one place behind. ""Everything can still happen,"" said Bordalas. Getafe have a chance, which is perhaps more than can be said for Girona, whose players and coach Eusebio Sacristan conceded their loss at home to Levante last weekend had been decisive in the fight against relegation. ""All that's left is to say sorry,"" said an emotional Eusebio afterwards. ""I was convinced I could do it but I failed."" They are 18th, needing to make up three points and a six-goal deficit in goal difference to overtake Celta Vigo on the final day. Celta have the added advantage of hosting already-relegated Rayo Vallecano while Girona play at Alaves. Barcelona's title-winning campaign will end away at Eibar on Sunday just as Real Madrid's miserable season finishes at home to Real Betis."
51,07/04/2019,19:22,Sevilla coach Caparros suffering from leukemia,Sevilla coach Joaquin Caparros announced on Sunday that he has chronic leukemia but says the condition is under control and will not prevent him continuing in his job.,"The 63-year-old, who took over last month after Pablo Machin was sacked, was speaking after Sevilla's 2-0 victory over Real Valladolid in La Liga. ""I have chronic leukemia,"" Caparros said in the post-match press conference. ""I have caught it early and can live a normal life. ""I want to enjoy my job and for everyone to stay calm. I've had no treatment and am grateful for the club giving me the opportunity [to continue coaching]."" Previously Sevilla's sporting director, Caparros is now acting as coach until the end of the season, with the team winning four of his six games in charge so far. Another former Sevilla coach, Eduardo Berizzo, announced in November 2017 that he was suffering from prostate cancer. He was sacked a month later following a string of bad results. The victory over Valladolid moved Sevilla up to fifth in the table after two goals in the final six minutes from Roque Mesa Quevedo and Munir El Haddadi. They are now only a point behind Getafe, who they play later this month after a crunch derby at home to Real Betis next weekend. ""My goal is the Champions League, that's very clear,"" Caparros said. ""That is our objective and we are going to do everything we can to achieve it."" Getafe kept their own remarkable bid for Champions League qualification on track by edging past Athletic Bilbao 1-0, Angel Rodriguez Diaz on target to seal his side's first win in four games. Alaves were held to a 1-1 draw at home to Leganes while Huesca scored two of three goals in six second-half minutes away to Levante, but it was only enough for a 2-2 draw. Despite signs of a revival in recent weeks, Huesca remain six points adrift of safety while Levante sit three clear of 18th-placed Villarreal, who play away to Real Betis later on Sunday."
52,04/04/2019,22:06,Sevilla back into European contention,Goals from Roque Mesa and Pablo Sarabia lifted Sevilla back into European contention on Thursday with a crucial 2-0 win over Alaves.,"The Basque side moved up from seventh to sixth, displacing Alaves to go level on points with fifth-placed Valencia who downed Real Madrid 24 hours earlier. Mesa put Sevilla into a 41st minute lead with a perfectly weighted rising shot from the right that dipped over keeper Fernando Pacheco and into the far corner of the net. With Alaves struggling to make an impact the home side doubled their advantage when Sarabia's skimming shot flashed past the hapless Pacheco and into an empty net with 10 minutes remaining. For Sevilla this was a vital three points after Valencia had inflicted Zinedine Zidane's first defeat since returning as Real boss on Wednesday. Valencia's 2-1 home success moved them to within a point of La Liga's top four, on 46 points, only ahead now of Sevilla on goal difference."
53,31/03/2019,18:23,Valencia stay in Champions League hunt,Valencia maintained their hopes of a place in next season's Champions League after Daniel Parejo's penalty on the stroke of half-time gave them a vital 1-0 victory at Sevilla on Sunday.,"Parejo's spot-kick, which came after Ever Banega brought down Jose Gaya, extended Valencia's unbeaten run to nine matches and moves them up to sixth, level on 43 points with Sevilla and just three back from the final Champions League spot. That place is occupied by Getafe, who fell 2-0 at home to mid-table Leganes on Saturday and have to play the league's top three -- leaders Barcelona, Atletico Madrid and Real Madrid -- and Sevilla in their final nine games. Despite a slightly simpler league fixture list Marcelino's Valencia however have an all-Spanish Europa League quarter-final tie with Villarreal to contend with, as well as the Copa Del Rey final against Barcelona between now and the end of the season. Both teams are way behind Real Madrid, who are third and host bottom club Huesca later on Sunday hoping to keep the pressure on neighbours Atletico Madrid in the fight for second after Diego Simeone's side hammered fifth-placed Alaves 4-0 on Saturday. Barcelona are 10 points clear of Atleti and heavy favourites to retain their La Liga after Lionel Messi fired them to their sixth league win on the bounce, 2-0 at home to local rivals Espanyol."
54,17/03/2019,17:49,"Monchi returns to Sevilla, disappoints Arsenal","Ramon Rodriguez Verdejo, better known as 'Monchi', has agreed to return to Sevilla as the club's sporting director, despite reportedly being close to taking a similar role at Arsenal.","Monchi left Roma earlier this month after coach Eusebio Di Francesco was sacked following their last-16 defeat by Porto in the Champions League. He had been heavily tipped to join Arsenal and reunite with coach Unai Emery, whom he worked alongside while Emery was in charge at Sevilla between 2013 and 2016. Instead, Monchi has chosen to move back to Sevilla, where he worked between 2000 and 2017 and oversaw them winning the Europa League five times and the Copa del Rey twice. The former goalkeeper also spent nine seasons with the club's first team as a player. ""Monchi has returned to what will always be his home,"" Sevilla said in a statement on Sunday. ""Sevilla FC and Monchi have reached an agreement for him to return to what had been his position until two years ago, as general sports director of the club. His role will be effective from April 1."" Sevilla sacked Pablo Machin as coach on Friday after a run of three wins in 11 games left them five points adrift of La Liga's top four and out of the Europa League. Joaquin Caparros, previously the club's sporting director, has been installed as Machin's replacement until the end of the season."
55,15/03/2019,17:26,"Sevilla sack Machin, put Caparros in temporary charge",Sevilla sacked coach Pablo Machin on Friday and appointed the club's director of football Joaquin Caparros as his replacement until the end of the season.,"Machin took charge in May last year after leading Girona to a 10th-place finish in their first campaign in La Liga. But despite a strong start at Sevilla, which included them going top of the table in November, results have dipped and their chances of qualifying for the Champions League next season are under threat. Sevilla sit sixth, five points adrift of fourth, and their Europa League exit at the hands of Slavia Prague on Thursday proved the final straw for Machin. They have won six of their 18 matches since the turn of the year. ""Sevilla FC have made the decision this Friday to part company with first team coach Pablo Machin following a string of poor results in recent weeks,"" read an official club statement. ""Director of football Joaquin Caparros will take the reigns with immediate effect."" Caparros led the team for a month last season after Vincenzo Montella was sacked and oversaw three wins from his four games in charge, including a 3-2 victory at home to Real Madrid. He will be in charge of Sevilla on Sunday, when they play away at Espanyol in La Liga. ""Caparros will have experience in this role,"" the club's statement added. ""He took over from Vincenzo Montella in similar circumstances last season."""
56,23/02/2019,19:05,Messi treble fires Barcelona to thrilling win over Sevilla,"Lionel Messi hit a sumptuous hat-trick, the 50th of his career, to inspire Barcelona to a 4-2 victory over Sevilla on Saturday and take them one step closer to winning La Liga.","Messi was supposed to be lacking fitness and Barca struggling for form but both delivered a resounding response at the Ramon Sanchez Pizjuan, with two matches against Real Madrid just around the corner. After scoring 11 goals in nine games, Messi's thigh strain had coincided with a dip by his own high standards, one goal in four prompting concerns he was being pushed too far. But the Argentinian was back to his scintillating best, this his 44th treble for Barcelona, now the joint most for a Spanish club alongside Cristiano Ronaldo, rounded off by a trademark chip late on. ""We cannot always be at our best,"" Messi said afterwards. ""We came from a streak when, to be honest, we weren't playing our best football. If the game flows it is easier to score goals."" Luis Suarez needed a goal after a disappointing performance against Lyon in midweek and Messi arranged that too. It was his pass that Suarez converted for a fourth, after Jesus Navas and Gabriel Mercado had twice put Sevilla ahead in the first half. Sevilla's top-four hopes look increasingly uncertain but for Barcelona, this was one of the toughest tests left in their run-in, with perhaps the most difficult to come next weekend, against Madrid at the Santiago Bernabeu. Real, who face Levante on Sunday, sit 12 points behind Barca and their best hope of a domestic trophy is surely now in beating them first on Wednesday in the Copa del Rey. ""This is not the title almost won but it was important to win today,"" Messi said. ""It gets harder towards the end and it is never easy here. Today we were back to being us."" As well as a return to form for Barca and Messi, there was a return to the team for Samuel Umtiti, the defender handed his first appearance in three months after recovering from a knee injury. It was given an early test as Wissam Ben Yedder twisted him one way and then the other but Umtiti was quick on his feet and did well to make the block. Sevilla had started at a furious pace and it was the speedy Navas that scored first, sprinting almost 78 metres to meet the end of a slick counter-attack. Messi lost the ball and Ben Yedder set off through the centre, teeing up Navas on the right to find the far corner. Messi soon made amends. Ivan Rakitic sent over a dangling cross, which he volleyed sweetly past Tomas Vaclik with his left foot. The ball was flying from one end to the other as Umtiti stopped the lively Pablo Sarabia and Gerard Pique's blistering break forward was halted by his opposite number three, Sergi Gomez. Sevilla scored next, just before half-time, with Marc-Andre ter Stegen's underhit clearance allowing Sarabia to scuttle down the right. He flicked the ball off the goalline and back to Mercado, who steered it into the net. Ousmane Dembele came on and should have equalised, fluffing his finish after a cross from Suarez, who should have had a penalty when Simon Kjaer caught him late. Messi provided the finishing touch. Again it came from the goalkeeper, Vaclik's punt falling straight to Rakitic. Dembele pulled back for Messi, who took one touch and curled it, this time right-footed, into the top corner. Sevilla looked dead on their feet, their early intensity draining away, and Messi landed the knock-out blow. There was a hint of fortune as Carles Alena's shot deflected neatly into his path. Vaclik came out but Messi scooped it over his body and in. Three times a scorer, there was still time for an assist. Messi chested and poked the ball through for Suarez. His lob made it four."
57,20/02/2019,20:15,Sevilla ease past Lazio to reach Europa League last 16,Wissam Ben Yedder scored his second goal of the tie as Sevilla eased to a 2-0 second-leg win over Lazio on Wednesday to reach the Europa League last 16.,"The record five-time winners had claimed a 1-0 first-leg victory in Rome last week thanks to a Ben Yedder strike, and the Frenchman doubled their overall lead on 20 minutes by tapping in after Pablo Sarabia's shot was saved by Thomas Strakosha. Ben Yedder has now scored 21 goals this season, including eight in the Europa League. Franco Vazquez's sending off on the hour mark gave Lazio hope of an unlikely comeback, but visiting midfielder Adam Marusic was also dismissed 11 minutes later. Sarabia wrapped up a 3-0 aggregate success by lashing home Jesus Navas' pass with 12 minutes to play. Pablo Machin's Sevilla, who sit fourth in La Liga in the race for Champions League qualification, are playing in Europe's second-tier competition for the first time since winning their third straight title in 2015-16."
58,19/01/2019,18:25,Casemiro wonder goal helps Madrid defeat Sevilla,Casemiro's stunning long-range strike and a late goal from Luka Modric earned Real Madrid a 2-0 win over Sevilla on Saturday and a much-needed boost to their flailing title challenge in La Liga.,"Madrid began the day 10 points adrift of leaders Barcelona, a gap that will be restored if the Catalans defeat Leganes on Sunday, but this victory should inject a timely shot of confidence. Casemiro's bending effort in the 78th minute and Modric's injury-time finish settled a compelling contest of third against fourth but Madrid were dominant in the second half and, in the end, deserved the points. It means they jump above Sevilla in the table and register their most impressive result in weeks, following a run of only two wins from five matches. ""Beating your direct rivals is always worth more than three points,"" coach Santiago Solari said afterwards. ""The celebration for our first goal was pure joy."" Madrid had been thrashed by Sevilla in September, a 3-0 defeat that triggered a run of one victory in seven games, the seventh culminating in Julen Lopetegui being sacked. Solari sparked a brief revival but performances had slumped again. This was more like it, a purposeful display led by Modric, who played first with a bandage and then stitches to protect a cut eye. ""He was outstanding,"" Solari said. ""Considering he played with a cut, and stitches, he is a fighter. The fact he scored in the last minute shows his spirit and the spirit of the team."" Sevilla had gone top in November when Barca were also stuttering but doubts remain about their sturdiness under pressure. In their last 28 visits to the Santiago Bernabeu and Camp Nou, they have now lost 27 and drawn one. ""The biggest games hit you not only physically but mentally too,"" Sevilla coach Pablo Machin said. ""I have always said there would be moments this season where we were not playing so well."" Isco again started on the bench, along with the struggling Marcelo, while Gareth Bale was absent as he continues to recover from a calf strain. Vinicius Junior was Madrid's brightest spark in the first half and could have scored early after Modric robbed Ever Banega in midfield but the teenager's shot was saved easily by Tomas Vaclik. Sevilla grew in confidence and had the best chance before the interval as one pass sent Wissam Ben Yedder racing clear on the counter-attack. Madrid's defenders sprawled to track the runners but Sergio Escudero arrived late on the left and only had Thibaut Courtois to beat. He drilled into the side-netting. Modric's head was bandaged after a collision with Franco Vazquez while his team were much improved in the second half. Vinicius' shot was blocked, Modric curled over and Dani Carvajal weaved through. Dani Ceballos' bending effort even rattled the crossbar, with Vaclik tapping it afterwards in gratitude. Isco came on with 14 minutes left and shortly after Madrid finally found the breakthrough. Casemiro collected the ball 25 yards out, looked up and sent it soaring towards the left-hand corner. Vaclik dived but a weak right hand could only help it in. Sevilla, pegged back for so long, never looked like switching the momentum and Modric wrapped up the win in injury time. Daniel Carrico was at fault, caught in possession by the Croatian, who finished like a striker before wheeling away, roaring to the home fans in relief."
59,06/01/2019,21:32,Madrid title hopes hanging by thread after shock loss to Real Sociedad,Real Madrid may not even challenge for the title let alone win it as a shock 2-0 defeat at home to Real Sociedad on Sunday left them even further adrift in La Liga.,"Barcelona, already seven points clear, could extend the gap over their fiercest rivals to 10 by beating Getafe later, while Atletico Madrid and Sevilla gained on the European champions too, despite playing out a 1-1 draw against each other. Antoine Griezmann's stunning free-kick earned Atletico a point at the Ramon Sanchez Pizjuan. Madrid were reduced to 10 men in the second half after Lucas Vazquez was shown a second yellow card but by then they already trailed to Willian Jose's early penalty. Ruben Pardo wrapped up a brilliant victory for La Real, who had won this fixture only once in their last 22 attempts. This was their first victory at the Santiago Bernabeu since 2004 and then Madrid fired coach Carlos Queiroz a day later. Santiago Solari is not there yet, even if he was asked afterwards if he deserved to keep his job. ""We fight to win the next game,"" he said. The honeymoon period Solari enjoyed in November though after replacing Julen Lopetegui is well and truly over. This loss, coming after the draw away to Villarreal on Wednesday, means Madrid sit fifth, outside even the Champions League places. ""Everything went against us today,"" Solari said. ""We did everything we could but the ball just would not go in."" A stoney-faced Florentino Perez was among the 53,412 watching on, the club's second lowest attendance of the season. ""We will try to get them back,"" Solari said, before making a swift exit. Barcelona have won seven out of the last 10 La Liga titles and if they are to slip up in 2019, Atletico or Sevilla would seem the ones now able to take advantage. Gareth Bale was missing with a calf injury but it was the 18-year-old Vinicius Junior that came in, not Isco, who is yet to start a league game under Solari. La Real's penalty was awarded after 75 seconds and converted after 150. Mikel Merino ghosted past Sergio Ramos and inside Marcelo. Casemiro tried to cover but bundled Merino to the ground. Willian Jose went high and down the middle. Madrid poured forward, only to spurn a handful of chances before the break. Karim Benzema had the best of them, lashing wide with only Geronimo Rulli to beat. Rulli was not needed then but he would be, many times. He denied Vinicius, Benzema and Luka Modric in quick succession. Ramos wanted a penalty for a push in his back but the appeal was desperate. Vazquez clipped the post with a looping cross but that was not enough to hush the angry whistles at the end of the half. The second period was frantic, with chances at both ends. Vinicius and Raphael Varane, twice, failed to find a gap in a goalmouth scramble, while Vinicius played a neat one-two with Benzema but his shot sailed inches wide. La Real could have sealed it as Mikel Oyarzabal fired over from close range and the weaving Januzaj twice went close. Isco replaced Casemiro in the 57th minute and in the 61st Vazquez was sent off. A rash sliding challenge had earned him a yellow card towards the end of the first half and even if the chip at Merino's heels seemed harmless, he was foolish to take the risk. Down to 10, Madrid still pushed and had a more convincing penaty appeal when Vinicius tumbled over the arm of Rulli. Referee Jose Munuera stood firm. Januzaj should have wrapped it up when his shot was saved by the legs of Thibaut Courtois but Pardo did, heading in a cross from Willian Jose, who could have made it three in injury time. Defeat made Griezmann's free-kick seem all the more valuable as the Frenchman's fifth goal in as many games earned Atletico a point away to Sevilla. Sevilla would have leapfrogged Atletico into second with a win and took the lead when Wissam Ben Yedder fired home on the turn. Griezmann, however, intervened, whipping a superb shot across the rooted Jan Oblak and into the top right-hand corner."
60,23/12/2018,18:41,Sevilla leave it late to snatch draw against Leganes,Sevilla lost ground at the top of La Liga on Sunday despite Wissam Ben Yedder's late equaliser rescuing them a point against struggling Leganes.,"Mikel Vesga's header looked set to earn Leganes a valuable victory in their fight against relegation but Yedder sneaked in to score in the 91st minute and earn Sevilla a 1-1 draw. The visitors were the ones celebrating at the final whistle but they head into the winter break two points behind Atletico Madrid and five adrift of leaders Barcelona. The gap could easily have been greater. Leganes twice hit the woodwork, the second time just moments before Ben Yedder equalised at the other end. But they have now won two and drawn three of their last five games, an encouraging run that has put four points between them and the relegation places. Sevilla had been top almost exactly a month ago and even if few would see Pablo Machin's side as genuine title challengers, this was a match they would have hoped to win. Key absentees like Ever Banega and Pablo Sarabia were missed while a rain-soaked Butarque made playing conditions difficult. Leganes were ahead after five minutes as Vesga rose high to meet Allan Nyom's chipped ball into the area, and flicked it into the corner. Twice they were denied a second by the woodwork, each time from headers, as Dimitrios Siovas and then Youssef En-Nesyri watched efforts crash against the crossbar. Roque Mesa had nodded onto the post as well for Sevilla and it was his cross that supplied the equaliser in the first minute of added time. Yedder nipped in at the back post and, completely unmarked, made no mistake. There was late drama earlier on Sunday too as Cristiano Piccini scored a 94th-minute winner for Valencia against Huesca. Huesca, who are bottom of the table, had pulled level after Juan Hernandez's penalty cancelled out Dani Parejo's opener at Mestalla. Piccini's goal moves Valencia up to eighth."

Danny Welbeck nodded in a second just after half-time and Aubameyang curled in the Gunners' third, with Mesut Ozil also on target before a lapse in concentration saw Vorskla hit back with two late goals. ""I think we played well in the first half and in the beginning of the second as well,"" Aubameyang told BT Sport. ""We have to improve and try to fight not to concede a goal like we did in the last minute."" Premier League leaders Chelsea made a winning start to their Group L campaign as Willian's seventh-minute effort was enough to see off PAOK at a hostile Toumba Stadium. Eden Hazard was omitted from the Chelsea squad at his own request due to fatigue, but manager Maurizio Sarri fielded a strong side as the Blues extended their winning run to six games in all competitions. ""We were in control of the match for 90 minutes. We had a lot of opportunities. We missed them and so I'm very happy with the three points, very happy with the performance, but not very happy with the result,"" said Sarri. ""When it's time to kill the match, we have to kill the match."" Steven Gerrard's Rangers acquitted themselves well on their first appearance in the group stage of a European competition since the 2010-11 Champions League, as they came away with a 2-2 draw against Villarreal. A disastrous start for the Glasgow side saw Carlos Bacca fire Villarreal ahead inside 60 seconds, but Scott Arfield turned home a cross from Daniel Candeias to level on 67 minutes. Gerard Moreno put the hosts back in front almost immediately, only for Kyle Lafferty to again hit back for Rangers as Gerrard's men made a solid start in Group G. Leigh Griffiths hit a late winner for Celtic in a 1-0 home victory over Rosenborg, a team Brendan Rodgers' side knocked out in this season's Champions League qualifying rounds. Salzburg triumphed in the clash of Red Bulls in the other Group B fixture as Fredrik Gulbrandsen scored a minute from time to give the Austrian club a 3-2 victory over RB Leipzig. Marseille, last season's runners-up, slumped to a 2-1 home defeat by Eintracht Frankfurt in Group H as Luka Jovic grabbed an 89th-minute winner for the reigning German Cup champions. Lucas Ocampos opened the scoring early for Marseille, who were playing behind closed doors at the Stade Velodrome after numerous crowd incidents last season. But Lucas Torro levelled on 52 minutes for Eintracht before Jovic's late strike won it. Dudelange, the first Luxembourg team to play in the Europa League group stage, made seven-time European champions AC Milan work hard for a 1-0 win in Group F. Luxembourg's Grand Duke Henri and Grand Duchess Maria Teresa were in the crowd as Dudelange, who have a dozen non-professional players in their squad, succumbed to a deflected second-half goal by Gonzalo Higuain. Record five-time winners Sevilla launched their Group J campaign with a 5-1 rout of Standard Liege, as Ever Banega and Wissam Ben Yedder both netted twice for the Spaniards."
62,20/08/2018,00:28,"No Ronaldo, no Zidane, no problem as Real start La Liga with victory",Real Madrid got their La Liga campaign off to a winning start with a 2-0 victory at home to Getafe on Sunday in their first league outing since the summer departures of Cristiano Ronaldo and coach Zinedine Zidane.,"The European champions ensured the three points at the Santiago Bernabeu with a 20th-minute goal from Dani Carvajal and a Gareth Bale strike on 51 minutes. Keylor Navas held on to his place as Real Madrid's starting goalkeeper despite the arrival of Thibaut Courtois. Costa Rica international Navas has been first choice since 2015 but had been expected to make way for Courtois, a recent 35-million-euro recruit from Chelsea who was voted best goalkeeper at this summer's World Cup. Julen Lopetegui, who replaced Zidane as coach, also selected Nacho at the heart of the defence rather than French World Cup winner Raphael Varane. Real, playing their first La Liga game since the departure of Ronaldo to Juventus, went into Sunday's game on the back of a 4-2 defeat to Atletico Madrid in the UEFA Supercup in midweek. But they were rarely in trouble on Sunday. Bale was unlucky when a diving header came back off the crossbar in the first half before the Welshman was key in the build-up to the first goal with Carvajal heading in his cross. Another defensive error helped Real grab their second goal when Marco Asensio stole the ball and sent over a cross for Bale to score with his left foot. Asensio was close to getting his name on the scoresheet but was denied by the woodwork. Meanwhile, Portuguese striker Andre Silva marked his La Liga debut with a hat-trick as Sevilla romped to a 4-1 win at Rayo Vallecano, surpassing his total of goals scored for AC Milan in the whole of last season's Serie A. Silva had managed just two goals for the Serie A giants and was loaned out to Sevilla this summer. Franco ""Mudo"" Vazquez opened the scoring with a backheel in the 15th minute before Silva bagged his first just after the half hour mark. The 22-year-old added his second in first-half stoppage time after a corner and completed his hat-trick 10 minutes from time. However, he endured a nervous wait before he could celebrate, requiring the VAR to overturn an offside decision which had ruled out Silva's effort. It was the first time in La Liga history that the VAR had made such an intervention. The system was called upon again in the last minute when Adrian Embarba converted a penalty for Rayo after the referee had initially whistled for a free-kick outside the box."
63,13/08/2018,00:18,Barcelona fight back to win Spanish Supercup,Barcelona battled back to defeat Sevilla 2-1 and win the Spanish Supercup on Sunday with French World Cup winner Ousmane Dembele hitting a sensational winner to help give Lionel Messi a winning start as captain.,"It was Barcelona's 13th Supercup and sixth in the last nine seasons. However, Sevilla squandered a golden chance to send the match into extra-time when Wissam Ben Yedder missed a last-minute penalty. Pablo Sarabia gave Sevilla the lead after just nine minutes on a counter-attack. Gerard Pique, who announced his international retirement with Spain on Saturday, levelled three minutes before the interval for Barcelona after he was fastest to respond to a loose ball following a Messi free-kick. That set the stage for French star Dembele to take the headlines with a 78th minute screamer from 25 yards and again Messi played a crucial role with the key pass. There was still time for late drama when Barca goalkeeper Marc-Andre Ter Stegen brought down Aleix Vidal in the area as the Sevilla youngster closed in on an equaliser. But Ben Yedder hit a weak penalty which was easily saved by Ter Stegen. The match had endured a controversial build-up when Sevilla threatened to file a complaint against Barcelona if the La Liga champions fielded more than three non-EU players. The Spanish football federation (RFEF) said on Saturday that there would be no restrictions on players from outside the EU for the Supercup, despite only three being allowed in squads for league matches. Sevilla said they could file a complaint if Barca name an ""improper lineup"" in Tangier. New signings Malcom, Arturo Vidal and Arthur were expected to be Barca's three non-EU players on Sunday, although Brazilian centre-back Marlon also travelled with the squad. In the end, 21-year-old winger Malcom, signed from Bordeaux in the summer, was left out of the match day line-up. Philippe Coutinho has reportedly acquired a Portuguese passport through his wife in the last week, while his fellow South Americans Messi and Luis Suarez are already EU citizens. Sevilla qualified for Sunday's match as last season's Copa del Rey runners-up, after Barcelona won the league and cup double."

The 22-year-old Silva moved to Milan last summer from Porto where he had scored 24 goals in 58 games. But he was unable to repeat that form in Serie A, scoring 10 goals in 40 matches.

They must now replace Machin and have been linked with two of Pep Guardiola´s assistant coaches at Manchester City, Mikel Arteta and Domenec Torrent. Arteta was in the running to succeed Arsene Wenger at Arsenal earlier this month, only for former Sevilla boss Unai Emery to be given the job. Machin has signed a two-year contract at Sevilla, who snuck into the Europa League qualification spots after sacking Vincenzo Montella in April. Joaquin Caparros oversaw the upturn as caretaker but did not want the job full time and has instead become the club's director of football. ""Pablo Machin will be the new manager of Sevilla FC,"" a Sevilla statement said on Monday. ""The club has reached an agreement for the next two seasons, with the coach joining after three and a half years of success at Girona FC.

69,04/05/2018,03:30,'Clasico of honour' - Real look to crash unbeaten Barca's party,"Real Madrid can transform their own season by beating Liverpool in this month's Champions League final, and on Sunday they can dent Barcelona's by becoming the first team to defeat the Catalans in La Liga.","This 'clasico' at Camp Nou will have minimal impact on the league, with Barca already crowned champions and Real's passing interest in pipping Atletico to second place diminished by their ambitions in Europe. But there is still much at stake in what Madrid's daily newspaper Marca has billed ""the clasico of honour"". It could even be argued this match will go some way to defining the seasons of these two teams. Barca, in particular, have been careful in celebrating their domestic double, their players aware of the disappointment that lingers from their Champions League crash in the quarter-finals. Even as they ordered pizza and slurped beer from the top of their open-top bus down Las Ramblas this week, it was noticeable how many interviews still referenced the disappointment in Rome. ""The elimination in the Champions League, it hurt us because it was unexpected,"" said Barca coach Ernesto Valverde. ""But it is very difficult to do what we have done and now what are we going to do? We keep trying."" To soften the blow, Barca's best response was to win the Copa del Rey and La Liga and finish unbeaten in the league for the first time, while hoping Real do not go all the way in the Champions League. The latter two are still to be decided. Real's march towards a 13th European triumph has certainly weighed heavily on Barcelona, whose sense of absence has been heightened by the progress of their rivals. ""It's amazing to be in a Champions League final for the third time in a row and have the chance to win it for the fourth time in the last five years,"" Real midfielder Toni Kroos said on Tuesday. ""It's hard for me to find words to describe that. When it comes to the Champions League, we have extra motivation."" Barca are looking to avoid defeat this weekend, and in their last three league games against Villarreal, Levante and Real Sociedad to seal a historic season. But if Real snatch a victory at the Camp Nou and also see off Liverpool, perhaps the balance is tipped in their favour. It will certainly be the last 'clasico' for Andres Iniesta as a player while Gareth Bale may also wave goodbye to this fixture, with the Welshman expected to consider his future at Real in the summer. The suggestion is both teams could give the departing Iniesta, Barca's captain, a guard of honour, even if Real refuse to do so for Barcelona's La Liga triumph. Bale was again a substitute against Bayern Munich on Tuesday, meaning he has now started only one of Real's six Champions League knock-out games. Zidane has been playing Bale, and resting key players, in La Liga matches but he is not likely to field a weakened team this weekend. Elsewhere, Sevilla will play their first match under their caretaker coach Joaquin Caparros on Friday against Real Sociedad. Vincenzo Montella was sacked after last weekend's loss to lowly Levante, which left the team eighth in the table and a point outside the Europa League qualification places. ""We have changed some subtle things but there is no time,"" Caparros said on Thursday. ""Our work with the players so far has been more than anything emotional."" Atletico Madrid, who are five points ahead of Real, host struggling Espanyol on Sunday."
70,13/03/2018,22:44,Sevilla shock Man Utd to reach Champions League quarter-finals,Manchester United crashed out of the Champions League as Wissam Ben Yedder struck twice in four second-half minutes to send Sevilla into the quarter-finals for the first time in 60 years with a stunning 2-1 win at Old Trafford on Tuesday.,"The Spaniards progressed by the same score on aggregate after a goalless first-leg draw. The visitors were deserving winners as they controlled the game throughout but had to wait for Ben Yedder's introduction as a substitute to add a clinical finish. Ben Yedder put Sevilla in front 16 minutes from time when he blasted into the bottom corner before heading in a second shortly after. Romelu Lukaku reduced United's arrears, but it was too little, too late with United boss Jose Mourinho's decision to once again drop Paul Pogba certain to be scrutinised. Mourinho sprang a surprise before kick-off by recalling Marouane Fellaini at the expense of Pogba, who had also been dropped for the first game. Jesse Lingard also returned in place of Juan Mata in Mourinho's only other change from the side that beat Liverpool 2-1 at the weekend. And Lingard nearly had an instant impact as he teed up Lukaku on the edge of the box, but the Belgian's effort drifted high and wide. Sevilla dominated the vast majority of the first leg only to be denied by some stunning saves from David de Gea. However, it was wayward finishing rather than the Spanish number one that prevented the visitors making the most of their ascendency for most of the match. Joaquin Correa headed just over from a corner before Luis Muriel and Franco Vazquez fired off target when well-positioned on the edge of the area. Indeed, of Sevilla's 10 efforts on goal in the first period only one weak Muriel effort forced De Gea into making a save. Mourinho's gamble on Fellaini appeared to have largely backfired as he failed to impose his physical presence on Sevilla's ball players in midfield. Yet, the Belgian nearly made the breakthrough with United's best move of the opening period when he latched onto Alexis Sanchez's layoff and his powerful effort was turned behind by Sergio Rico. The second period began in the same vein as the first with Sevilla on the front foot, and only a brilliant last-ditch tackle by Eric Bailly denied Correa a clear sight of goal. Chances kept coming for Sevilla as Muriel then turned a dangerous Pablo Sarabia cross inches wide. Pogba, who cost United a then-world record £89 million ($116 million) in 2016, was eventually introduced just after the hour mark with Fellaini sacrificed. However, even the Frenchman couldn't kickstart the hosts and they were eventually made to pay. Ben Yedder had only been on the pitch for two minutes after replacing Muriel, when he finally broke the deadlock in the tie with brilliant finish low into De Gea's bottom left-hand corner. Mourinho responded by throwing on Anthony Martial and Juan Mata, but their attacking edge was needed far earlier as Ben Yedder soon put the outcome beyond any doubt when he forced home a corner at the far post despite a despairing effort by De Gea. Sevilla should even had added to their lead as Clement Lenglet and Correa came close. Lukaku finally got United on the board six minutes from time when he swept home a corner. But it was to little avail as United have now failed to reach the quarter-finals for five straight years."
71,09/03/2018,16:25,Injured Navas will not face Manchester United - Sevilla,"Jesus Navas will not be fit to face Manchester United in the Champions League next week, Sevilla confirmed on Friday.","Navas, who joined Sevilla from Manchester City last summer, has a calf injury and will miss the last 16 second leg at Old Trafford. The first leg finished 0-0. ""Jesus Navas will not recover in time for Tuesday's Champions League match in Manchester,"" a Sevilla statement read. ""The player was injured on 25 February in the game against Atletico Madrid and has been working alone with the idea of returning for the match against Valencia CF and especially to play at Old Trafford. ""However, the evolution in the last 48 hours has not been as expected."" Navas will therefore also miss Sevilla's La Liga game at home to Valencia on Saturday."
72,03/03/2018,18:38,Sevilla close gap on top four with victory over Bilbao,Sevilla kept alive their hopes of a top-four finish in La Liga by easing to a 2-0 victory over Athletic Bilbao on Saturday.,"Two goals in five first-half minutes from Luis Muriel and Franco Vazquez were enough for Sevilla, who play Manchester United later this month in the second leg of the Champions League last 16. They head to Old Trafford after being held to a goalless draw in the first leg. Vincenzo Montella's side face a fight, however, to qualify for the competition again next season, their victory over Bilbao closing the gap behind fourth-placed Valencia to five points. Valencia host Real Betis on Sunday. Elsewhere, Villarreal's ambitions of securing European football next season also took a knock as they were beaten 2-0 at home to Girona. Girona sit seventh, but now just one point behind their opponents, who were undone by goals from Christian Stuani and substitute Anthony Lozano."
73,22/02/2018,13:13,Mourinho's cautious Man Utd tactics win few admirers,Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho left Spain with a precious clean sheet but few admirers after an uninspiring 0-0 Champions League draw with Sevilla that featured a limp attacking display.,"It could have been a bleak night for Mourinho and United but for the heroics of goalkeeper David de Gea, who produced a dazzling display on Wednesday. The Spaniard was forced into eight saves, including one remarkable stop from a point-blank Luis Muriel header just before half-time that was so spectacular the Colombian striker congratulated United's number one as they left the field at the break. However, the result did not spare Mourinho from criticism, after he set his stall out from the start by leaving Paul Pogba on the bench for a workmanlike midfield three of Nemanja Matic, Ander Herrera and 21-year-old Scott McTominay. Injury to Herrera forced Mourinho to introduce Pogba after just 17 minutes but even the French midfielder's talents, for which United paid Juventus £89 million ($124 million) 18 months ago, failed to inspire a visiting side playing to strict instructions. A team also containing the attacking talents of Alexis Sanchez and Romelu Lukaku had just one shot on target all evening at the Sanchez Pizjuan stadium and even that was a tame McTominay strike from outside the box that was easily beaten away by Sergio Rico. But Mourinho reacted angrily when asked whether he is betraying United's rich tradition of attacking football, most recently during Alex Ferguson's trophy-laden 27 years in charge. ""The next time I see David Beckham, I'm going to ask him 'David, when you were playing right wing in Manchester United, when the left-back attacked, do you stay looking at the stands or you come back with the guy?'"" said Mourinho. ""Now it looks like all the good players, they have to play free... which I think is such a stupid thing to say,"" he added. ""The winning teams, the top teams in the world now, not 10 years ago, or 20 or 30, now, the top teams, everybody works, everybody has tactical discipline,"" he said. Mourinho was also irritated at the focus on the absence of Pogba from his starting line-up. ""In my pre-match interview I had four questions and three were about Paul, and Paul was not even playing,"" he said. ""That's a bit strange."" The United manager even hugged a TV reporter who asked him a question about McTominay, relieved it was not another about the French midfielder. Sevilla, who conceded more goals than any other side that reached the last 16 of the Champions League, did not have their defensive weaknesses exposed by a cautious United team. ""Mourinho, look how hard it is to win when you don't want to,"" Spanish sports daily Marca headlined its match report, in a withering criticism of the former Real Madrid coach's tactics. It was a performance thrown into an even harsher light by the free-flowing attacking intent showed by Liverpool, Manchester City and Tottenham Hotspur on the road in the Champions League last week. ""Compared to other teams in our league in this competition they are not as pleasing on the eye,"" said former United defender Rio Ferdinand. ""But they grind out results and in Europe I would be very satisfied with that and think 'we will beat them at home'. ""Sometimes it can't be pretty and it can't always be free-flowing. There have been times this season United have played well but they aren't as consistent in those performances of other teams."" However, the tactics were in keeping with Mourinho's cautious approach against the stronger sides away from home this season. In trips to Chelsea, Liverpool, Spurs and Sevilla, United have managed zero goals and a total of just seven shots on target. That heaps the pressure on Mourinho to be far more daring with Chelsea and Liverpool visiting Old Trafford in the Premier League before the second leg against Sevilla on March 13 as he seeks to ensure qualification for next season's Champions League."
74,22/02/2018,01:45,Mourinho hails McTominay after leaving out Pogba for Sevilla draw,"Jose Mourinho described Scott McTominay as ""fantastic"" in response to his decision to select the young midfielder ahead of Paul Pogba for Wednesday's Champions League last 16, first-leg draw with Sevilla.","Pogba had been left out of the starting line-up for the goalless draw with Mourinho apparently unhappy after the French star withdrew from last weekend's FA Cup win at Huddersfield Town citing illness. That followed criticism from Mourinho of Pogba's recent performances, with the Portuguese making a statement by selecting McTominay, 21, alongside Ander Herrera and Nemanja Matic in midfield. Mourinho later complained that there had been too much focus on Pogba before and after the match, and not enough on a player making his second Champions League start. ""In my pre-match interview I had four questions and three were about Paul, and Paul was not even playing. That's a bit strange,"" he said. ""If I was one of you (journalists), I would ask if the Manchester United manager agrees that Scott McTominay had a fantastic performance, and my answer would be that yes, he had a fantastic performance. ""He looked a senior player, a player with great maturity. Scott probably looked like a man with dozens and dozens of matches in the Champions League when this is only the second (start)."" Pogba played most of the game anyway, being sent on after just 17 minutes when injury forced Herrera off. The French star played his part in a typically cautious, backs-to-the-wall away European performance from Mourinho's side. But, tellingly, he later refused to stop for journalists in the mixed zone of the Sanchez Pizjuan. ""Paul made a big effort to try to give the team what I asked of them,"" insisted Mourinho. ""He gave us stability. For a match away to Sevilla we had a good percentage of the ball, and I think Paul had responsibility for that."" The injury to Herrera came after the Spaniard had been passed fit to return from a hamstring injury that had kept him out of United's previous three games. He could now face another untimely spell on the sidelines, with United's programme including Premier League games against Chelsea and Liverpool before the Sevilla second leg on March 13. ""The medical department gave him fully fit. On the pitch he showed the intensity that is only possible if you are fully fit,"" Mourinho said. ""Then it was a back-heel and a back-heel creates a contraction in the muscular area where he had the biggest problem, and now we have proof that he was not 100 percent fit."" Mourinho said the scoreline ""reflected what the game was"", despite the Old Trafford side managing just one shot on target all evening. Sevilla created almost all of the chances, but could not find a way past an inspired David de Gea, who made two stunning saves from Steven N'Zonzi and Luis Muriel late in the first half. ""Even with a couple of mistakes the team defended well,"" Mourinho said. ""When we made the mistakes David was obviously there and that is the reason why he is what he is."" United are hoping to reach the quarter-finals for the first time since 2014, while Sevilla have never made it past the last 16 of the Champions League in three attempts in the last decade. Their coach Vincenzo Montella believes his side have a good chance of progressing, despite struggling recently in big matches away from home. ""I think this Sevilla have to always play to score and try to be superior to our opponents,"" said the Italian. ""It is not always possible but that is what we have to do, and play to win."""
75,21/02/2018,23:53,Mourinho admits concern at Herrera injury in Sevilla draw,"Jose Mourinho fears Ander Herrera has a ""bad injury"" after the Spanish midfielder was forced off in the first half of Wednesday's 0-0 draw with Sevilla in the Champions League.","Herrera hadn't played in United's previous three matches due to a muscle injury before being recalled for the last 16, first leg at the Sanchez Pizjuan. However, he lasted only 17 minutes before being replaced by Paul Pogba. ""I think it's a bad injury. He had a small injury that stopped him for the last couple of matches, but the medical department gave him 100 percent ready for last Saturday,"" said Mourinho after the game in Spain. ""We didn't play him to give him more work and more protection but it looks like he wasn't fully fit."" Mourinho added: ""He looked fit and the way he was playing during the time he was on the pitch -- he was pressing a lot, really high -- you only do that when you feel good. ""Then it was a back-heel and a back-heel creates a contraction in the muscular area where he had the biggest problem, and now we have proof that he was not 100 percent fit."" United were reliant on some fine David de Gea saves to leave the Sanchez Pizjuan with a draw, but the result leaves the tie wide open ahead of the return at Old Trafford next month. ""We have to decide it at Old Trafford,"" Mourinho added. ""Last season we had Europa League knockout games there which obviously is not the same. ""In previous years we were out in the group phase, so Old Trafford needs a big Champions League night."""
76,20/02/2018,15:41,"How to stop Sanchez? Tie him up, says Sevilla coach Montella",Sevilla coach Vincenzo Montella joked he might have to use a novel approach to dealing with the threat of Alexis Sanchez when his team come up against Manchester United in the Champions League on Wednesday.,"""Manchester have fantastic players and Sanchez has improved hugely over the course of his career,"" said Italian Montella, who knows the Chilean from the time he spent in Serie A with Udinese. ""How do we stop him? I don't know. We'll have to tie him up!"" Another player Montella knows from Serie A is Paul Pogba, although it is not certain the former Juventus midfielder will even start in the last 16, first leg at the Ramon Sanchez Pizjuan amid reports of an uneasy relationship with his manager Jose Mourinho. ""He is a complete player, strong, technical and scores goals. He is fantastic,"" Montella told reporters at Sevilla's stadium on Tuesday. ""He was the most expensive player in history before Neymar. I hope he doesn't play!"" Montella was appointed during Spain's winter break following the controversial sacking of Argentine coach Eduardo Berizzo, who had just undergone surgery for prostate cancer. Sacked by AC Milan in November, Montella will be taking charge of only his second Champions League game when he comes up against United. He previously oversaw Roma's defeat to Shakhtar Donetsk in the second leg of the last 16 in 2011, while Jose Mourinho has vast experience of the Champions League, a competition he has won with both FC Porto and Inter Milan. ""He was a pioneer. I have read books about his style of coaching,"" said Montella of Mourinho. ""I don't know how many Champions League matches he has managed. But against his experience we will need to not think about that and be brave."" Montella also said that winger Joaquin Correa had trained on Tuesday and could play after coming off in the first half of Saturday's La Liga win at Las Palmas, while his fellow Argentine, playmaker Ever Banega, could also return."
77,12/02/2018,17:59,Atletico stadium to host Copa del Rey final,"Atletico Madrid's Wanda Metropolitano stadium will host this season's Copa del Rey final between Barcelona and Sevilla, the Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) confirmed on Monday.","The 68,000-seat stadium, which was opened at the start of this season, will stage the game on Saturday, April 21. The decision means that Atletico's home game with Betis in La Liga, scheduled for that weekend, will have to be moved. Barcelona's home game with Villarreal and the match between Sevilla and Real Madrid have already been moved from that weekend to Wednesday, May 9. Atletico's ground was the only realistic option to host the final, with Real Madrid never likely to agree to stage the game at their 81,000-capacity Santiago Bernabeu. Barcelona have won the Copa del Rey in each of the last three seasons and will be appearing in their fifth consecutive final. Next season's Champions League final will also be played at the Wanda Metropolitano."
78,11/02/2018,14:21,Goalkeeper Rico stars in Sevilla victory,Sergio Rico was the hero for Sevilla with a penalty save and several key interventions as his side boosted their European hopes with a 1-0 win over Girona in La Liga on Sunday.,"The only goal of the game at a sunny Sanchez Pizjuan was scored just over 30 seconds into the second half, with Pablo Sarabia making sure the ball went in after a Joaquin Correa effort was stopped on the line. But, before that, Rico had intervened to prevent the home side going behind just prior to the interval, diving to his right to save an Aday Benitez penalty awarded for a handball by Luis Muriel. The Spanish international goalkeeper made several key saves, including one to deny Portu from point-blank range with just two minutes left, as Sevilla reclaimed sixth place in La Liga from Eibar, 1-0 winners at Leganes on Saturday. The victory comes as a big boost to Sevilla following their win over Leganes in midweek that took them through to April's Copa del Rey final, in which they will face Barcelona. Vincenzo Montella's side, who host Manchester United in the first leg of their Champions League last-16 tie on February 21, have struggled for consistency recently. They are currently four points behind fourth-placed Valencia, who host local rivals Levante later on Sunday. Real Madrid moved back up to third with a comprehensive 5-2 win over Real Sociedad on Saturday night in which Cristiano Ronaldo scored a hat-trick for the first time this season. Atletico Madrid, in second, moved to within six points of unbeaten league leaders Barcelona with a 1-0 win at bottom side Malaga on Saturday thanks to Antoine Griezmann's early goal. However, Barcelona can stretch their lead back to nine points by beating Getafe at the Camp Nou later (1515 GMT)."

Leganes had stunned European champions Real Madrid last month to progress to the semi-finals of the domestic cup competition for the first time in the club's 90-year history. But the modest outfit from the Madrid suburbs saw their dream run come to an end when Vazquez finished off a counter-attack in lethal fashion a minute from time to complete a 2-0 win on the night. ""It's a great feeling, it's the reward for the all the work put in,"" Correa told Spanish TV station Gol, before paying tribute to Sevilla's vanquished opponents. ""(Leganes) are a team who know what they're doing, a team worthy of a cup semi-final."" Sevilla will meet either holders Barcelona, who beat the Andalusian side 2-0 after extra time to lift the trophy in 2016, or Valencia in the final on April 21.

On Wednesday Real crashed to a humiliating exit when they were knocked out by little Leganes in the quarter-finals, adding to the atmosphere of crisis at the European champions. Real lost 2-1 in the second leg at their Bernabeu home as the tie finished 2-2 on aggregate with their modest city neighbours going through on away goals despite having lost the first leg 1-0 last week. Leganes's next opponents Sevilla beat Atletico Madrid 5-2 on aggregate. Barcelona, who have won the Copa del Rey in the last three seasons, progressed to the semis 2-0 against Espanyol on Thursday courtesy of goals from Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez for a 2-1 aggregate win.

And Escudero's lightning contribution all but sealed Atletico's fate. Antoine Griezmann levelled on the night with a sublime lob in the 13th minute, but the second half was only minutes old when Ever Banega scored from the penalty spot to put Sevilla back in charge. Pablo Sarabia bagged Sevilla's third in the 79th minute with a frustrated Atletico coach Diego Simeone sent to the stands at the end of the tie. ""This knock-out is my responsibility. Now we have to improve because there are still four months of competition,"" said Simeone.

That means United fans will pay £54, the same as what Liverpool fans paid to see their side draw 3-3 in Seville in the group stage. ""In this instance we believe that our travelling supporters are unfairly being subjected to increased/excessive ticket prices from the host club,"" Manchester United said in a statement. ""We have received lots of requests from individuals and supporter groups to intervene in this matter. ""This has been raised with Sevilla, and internally, but ultimately Sevilla have not agreed to significantly lower the price of tickets for our fans to what we view as a reasonable level."" United said they had felt it was only fair to charge their opponents fans a similar amount. ""Therefore, we have taken the difficult decision to charge Sevilla fans for the return leg at Old Trafford the same amount as our fans have been charged for the away fixture. ""We will use this increase to subsidise our fans, as we want this to act as a deterrent to future opponents who look to increase ticket prices for our travelling supporters.""

85,09/12/2017,18:10,Ronaldo stars as rejuvenated Real thrash Sevilla,Real Madrid sent a warning to Barcelona just two weeks ahead of El Clasico by storming back into form as Cristiano Ronaldo scored twice in a 5-0 thrashing of Sevilla on Saturday.,"Sevilla had started the afternoon on the same number of points as Madrid in joint fourth, but the sides looked worlds apart as Real scored all five goals before half-time to close to within five points of Barca at the top of the table. Nacho got the hosts off to a perfect start before Ronaldo doubled his La Liga tally for the season with a cool finish and a penalty inside the half mark. Toni Kroos and Achraf Hakimi rounded off the rout as Real leapfrogged cross city rivals Atletico Madrid into third. Barca can regain their eight-point advantage over Real when they visit Villarreal on Sunday. Real's spirits were lifted even before kick-off as Ronaldo showed off his record-equalling fifth Ballon d'Or to an adoring Santiago Bernabeu. There had been concern in Madrid ranks all week at the European champions' lack of defensive options with Sergio Ramos, Dani Carvajal and Casemiro all suspended and Raphael Varane injured. However, it was Sevilla who looked like the side without a defence as they gifted the hosts the opener after just three minutes. A harmless corner to the back post saw Sevilla duo Simon Kjaer and Luis Muriel get in each other's way and present Nacho with a gift to fire home from point-blank range. Ronaldo has just become the first player to score in all six games of a Champions League group, but there had been a stark contrast between his stunning European form and his lack of goals in La Liga. On Saturday, Ronaldo struck twice. The Portuguese swept home Marco Asensio's lovely through ball to double Madrid's advantage. Ronaldo's penalty then had just enough power to beat Sergio Rico after Jesus Navas handled inside his own area. Only a fine reaction save from Rico prevented Ronaldo completing a first-half hat-trick moments later. However, the Madrid goals kept coming before half-time as a lovely one-two on the counter-attack between Kroos and Lucas Vazquez left the German midfielder with a simple finish. Hakimi then made it five with his first Madrid goal from a narrow angle after being played in by Benzema's inch-perfect pass. With Madrid facing a busy fortnight as they jet off to Abu Dhabi to defend the Club World Cup this week before hosting Barca, Zinedine Zidane's men understandably took their foot off the gas after the break. Ronaldo, Luka Modric and Kroos were all withdraw, but Real could easily have added to their tally as Benzema's diving header came back off the post. Yet, a first five-goal haul in La Liga season in undoubtedly Madrid's best performance since they swept aside Barca in the Spanish Super Cup in August was more than enough to set up the Catalans' return visit on December 23 nicely."

The Argentine's assistant Ernesto Marcucci took charge as Sevilla beat Deportivo la Coruna 2-0 to move above Real Madrid into fourth for a few hours at least ahead of Madrid's trip to Athletic Bilbao later on Saturday. The club have repeatedly stated that Berizzo will continue as coach once a successful course of treatment has been completed. A former centre-back for River Plate, Marseille and Celta Vigo among others, Berizzo is in his first season as Sevilla boss after three successful years in charge of Celta. News of his condition was made public just hours after Sevilla produced a historic comeback from 3-0 down to draw 3-3 with Liverpool in the Champions League on November 21. Sevilla can seal their place in the last 16 of the Champions League with a point away to Maribor on Wednesday."

Paco Alcacer kept up his fine strike rate this season with his fourth goal of the campaign from just over 400 minutes on the field when he headed home Aleix Vidal's pass on 16 minutes. Barca had to wait until 10 minutes into the second-half to double their advantage when captain for the night Gerard Pique tapped into an empty net from another Vidal cross. Vidal then completed a fine team move himself when he headed home Nelson Semedo's cross. And fine finishes from Denis Suarez and Jose Manuel Arnaiz rounded off the scoring. Wissam Ben Yedder scored twice in the opening six minutes as Sevilla cruised past Cartagena 4-0 to seal a 7-0 aggregate win in the absence of coach Eduardo Berizzo. Berizzo underwent surgery on a cancerous tumour of the prostate on Tuesday with his assistant Ernesto Marcucci taking charge whilst he recovers. Paulo Henrique Ganso and Joaquin Correa were also on target for the five-time winners. Third tier Lleida pulled off a stunning comeback and the upset of the Cup so far by overcoming a 2-0 deficit on the night and 3-0 on aggregate to oust Real Sociedad on away goals. Diego Llorente and Juanmi put the La Liga side in a commanding position before half-time, but second-half goals from Aitor Nunez, Manu Molina and Bojan Radulovic handed Lleida a famous win. The returning Gareth Bale helped Real Madrid overcome a scare of their own to reach the last 16 on Tuesday despite being held 2-2 at the Santiago Bernabeu by Fuenlabrada in a 4-2 aggregate win. Celta Vigo, Leganes, Levante and Numancia have also sealed their places in the last 16."

Messages of goodwill towards Berizzo, 48, have flooded in from across the spectrum of Spanish football with Villarreal's players and fans showing their support before Sevilla's 3-2 win there on Sunday. ""I am grateful to Sevilla FC, the president, board, employees and players for the support, affection and closeness they have shown, and for the confidence in my work in the face of this setback,"" Berizzo said ahead of the match at Villarreal. ""I thank the club for the trust placed in me and my team to imagine a future together. I will try to return as soon as I can."" A former centre-back for River Plate, Marseille and Celta Vigo among others, Berizzo is in his first season as Sevilla boss after three successful years in charge of Celta. Sevilla sit fifth in La Liga and are second on eight points in Group E in the Champions League, just a point behind leaders Liverpool."

""Further tests will determine which steps to follow regarding his treatment. ""Sevilla FC wants to show their full support to the coach right now and wishes him a speedy recovery."" Berizzo, 48, made no statement on his health when speaking to media after the Spanish side came from 3-0 down at half-time to draw 3-3 against the five-time European champions. A former centre-back for River Plate, Marseille and Celta Vigo among others, Berizzo is in his first season as Sevilla boss after three successful years in charge of Celta. Several Sevilla players had hailed Berizzo's powers of motivation to orchestrate their second-half fightback. ""We had to come out with a different attitude for the fans and for the boss, he made us play like that,"" said Argentine international Ever Banega. ""He turned the situation around in the second-half."" Spanish football has rallied round Berizzo with numerous clubs, including his former side Celta sending their support. ""All our strength and support for Berizzo,"" the Galicians posted on Twitter. ""Be strong boss, you are in the best place in the world to not give in because there they never give up,"" said Sevilla's legendary former sporting director Monchi, who joined Roma earlier this year. Sevilla sit fifth in La Liga and need just a point from their final Champions League group game away at Maribor to secure their place in the last 16. It remains to be seen whether Berizzo will need to take time away from his duties as coach to concentrate on his recuperation. In the 2012/13 season, then Barcelona coach Tito Vilanova stood aside for several months as he underwent treatment for throat cancer in New York. Vilanova returned for the final two months of the season as Barca won the league with a club record 100 points, but resigned shortly afterwards and passed away in April 2014 at just 45."

91,21/11/2017,23:05,Sevilla fightback halts Liverpool's path to last 16,Sevilla produced a stunning fightback from a three-goal half-time deficit to earn a well-earned point with a thrilling 3-3 draw with Liverpool on Tuesday thanks to Guido Pizarro's stoppage-time equaliser.,"Roberto Firmino scored twice as Jurgen Klopp's side looked set to qualify for the knockout stages for the first time in nine years and seal top spot in Group E with a three-goal blitz in the first half-hour, with Sadio Mane also netting. However, Wissam Ben Yedder pulled two goals back before Pizarro stabbed home from a corner to protect Sevilla's year-long unbeaten run at home. Both sides remain well-placed to reach the last 16 as Liverpool still lead the group on nine points from Sevilla on eight with Spartak Moscow in third on six points. Liverpool host the Russians at Anfield in two weeks' time when Sevilla travel to Maribor for the final games in the group. Both sides were gifted a huge boost before kick-off as Maribor's stoppage-time equaliser for a 1-1 draw in the Russian capital prevented Spartak from jumping into second place in the group. Sevilla's joy didn't last long, though, as they were punished for awful defending from a corner less than two minutes in when Firmino was left completely unmarked at the far post to fire high past Sergio Rico. The hosts had their chances to get back into the game when Loris Karius got a fingertip to Nolito's goalbound effort to turn the ball onto the post before Ben Yedder fired inches wide with just the German goalkeeper to beat. Yet, the pace of Liverpool's 'fab four' attack of Firmino, Mane, Mohamed Salah and Philippe Coutinho looked capable of opening up the Sevilla defence at will and only a fine save from Rico prevented Firmino from doubling his tally midway through the half. That save only delayed a two-goal Liverpool lead by a matter of seconds as, from the resulting corner, Mane scored almost a carbon copy of the opener when he stooped to head home Firmino's flick-on. Eight minutes later it was 3-0 as Mane sped away from a lumbering Sevilla backline and his initial effort was only parried by Rico into the path of the grateful Firmino to slot into an empty net. It could have got even worse for Sevilla before they got into the shelter of the dressing room to regroup at half-time as Salah raced onto a lovely Coutinho through ball only to be denied by another smart Rico save. Sevilla came out a side transformed in the second half and were given a lifeline when Ben Yedder got across his marker to head Ever Banega's free-kick inside the far post. Belief was coursing through the home side and fans moments later when Ben Yedder went down under a challenge from former Sevilla favourite Alberto Moreno and German referee Felix Brych awarded a penalty. Ben Yedder stepped up and slotted home from the spot twice after Brych ordered his first attempt be retaken. Liverpool produced the most unbelievable fightback from 3-0 down to win the Champions League against AC Milan back in 2005 and Sevilla were inches away from their own Istanbul moment 25 minutes from time when Franco Vazquez's shot was turned onto the underside of the bar by Karius. Klopp restored some order to the visitors with the introduction of Emre Can and James Milner for Coutinho and Moreno and Liverpool should have settled their nerves with a fourth goal as Salah, Mane and Can all passed up big chances. And they were made to pay for their profligacy and poor defending when Pizarro stretched to turn home a loose ball after a corner wasn't properly cleared in injury time."
92,04/11/2017,22:51,Alcacer double edges Barca past Sevilla,Barcelona continued their record-breaking start to a La Liga season by beating Sevilla 2-1 thanks to Paco Alcacer's double on Saturday in an atmosphere at the Camp Nou marked by the political upheaval in Catalonia.,"A huge Catalan flag and banners reading ""justice"" in Catalan and English were displayed before kick-off after eight ministers of the Catalan government deposed by Madrid were detained pending a possible trial for their roles in the drive for Catalan independence. Loud cries of ""freedom"" also rang around Europe's largest stadium sporadically throughout the 90 minutes. Two other banners reading ""Freedom for political prisoners"" and ""Europe shame on you"" were held up by the Barca singing section behind one of the goals. Barca coach Ernesto Valverde last week joked such off-field distractions appeared to be helping his side and once again they weren't fazed in registering a 10th win in their opening 11 La Liga matches. The hosts could have scored three times in the opening 10 minutes as Clement Lenglet cleared off the line from Sergio Busquets, David Soria denied Luis Suarez and Ivan Rakitic fired a long-range effort inches wide. Alcacer was the surprise choice in Valverde's starting line-up and he opened the scoring on his first league start since the first day of the season. Suarez's cross-field pass was miscontrolled horribly by Sergio Escudero and fell perfectly for Alcacer to slot past the advancing Soria. Barely a threat before half-time, Sevilla came out a different side after the break and levelled just before the hour mark when Guido Pizarro bulleted home Ever Banega's corner. Barca reacted immediately, though, and just six minutes later got the winner when Alcacer turned home Rakitic's precise cross at the near post. On his 600th Barca appearance, Lionel Messi had the chance to make the game safe when his low effort was saved by Soria, but Barca held on to move 11 points clear of Real Madrid, who face Las Palmas on Sunday (1945 GMT). Valencia remain Barca's closest challengers, four points back, as they swept aside Leganes 3-0 for a club record seventh straight league win. ""No one will go undefeated through 38 games, but we are going to enjoy the moment,"" said Valencia coach Marcelino Garcia Toral. ""In the dressing room there is no euphoria, there is realism and constant analysis. ""We know how difficult it will be to keep this up, it's practically impossible."" Dani Parejo's clever free-kick that skidded underneath the Leganes wall got Valencia off to a perfect start on 14 minutes. The hosts had to wait until 19 minutes from time to seal the points with a blistering counter-attack that ended with Spanish international Rodrigo heading home Manchester United loanee Andreas Pereira's cross. And the team spirit in this Valencia side was demonstrated when habitual penalty-taker Parejo let Santi Mina take responsibility from the spot eight minutes from time to round off the scoring. ""It was a phenomenal (gesture). They worked it out themselves and I prefer it like that,"" added Marcelino. ""It goes to show the atmosphere there is within the group, which is the foundation for us to perform like this."" By contrast, Atletico Madrid's struggle for goals continues but Diego Simeone's men were bailed out by Thomas Partey's 91st-minute winner in a 1-0 victory at Deportivo la Coruna. A 1-1 draw at home to Azerbaijani champions Qarabag all but ended Atletico's Champions League campaign in midweek amidst a run of one win in eight games. And they suffered from a familiar lack of creativity at Riazor with Simeone even substituting star frontman Antoine Griezmann 10 minutes from time. However, a relieved Simeone punched the air in delight when Ghanaian midfielder Partey curled home Gabi's layoff from a free-kick on the edge of the box to pass Griezmann and join Angel Correa as Atletico's top scorer this season on four goals."
93,01/11/2017,22:48,Spartak win puts Sevilla back on track for last 16,Sevilla put themselves back in pole position to qualify for the last 16 of the Champions League as goals either side of half-time from Clement Lenglet and Ever Banega secured a nervy 2-1 win over Spartak Moscow on Wednesday.,"Victory moves Sevilla back above the Russians in Group E on seven points to Spartak's five with Liverpool in top spot on eight points after their 3-0 win over Maribor at Anfield. Smarting from a 5-1 thrashing in Moscow two weeks ago, Sevilla needed to win to keep their Champions League fate in their own hands. The hosts started like the more needy side and should have been in front after just two minutes when Banega dragged Pablo Sarabia's fine through ball. Sarabia on the right and Nolito on the left posed a constant threat in the opening stages, but often Sevilla's final ball let them down. Nolito's drive from a narrow angle was parried by Aleksandr Selikhov before the former Manchester City frontman's lobbed volley dipped onto the roof of the net. Eduardo Berizzo's side needed a set-piece to break the Russian's resistance on the half hour mark as Lenglet rose highest to power home Banega's corner despite Selikhov getting a hand to his header. Going behind brought the visitors out of their shell and they would have levelled with their first attempt on goal but for a stunning save from Sergio Rico low to his left to turn Fernando's free-kick behind. Spartak pressed much higher up the field after the break, but that only resulted in handing Sevilla far more space to break into and Nolito should have scored when he dragged his shot inches wide after one long ball took out the Spartak defence. Sevilla looked to have made the game safe just before the hour mark when Banega curled a fine effort from the edge of the area into the top corner. Wissam Ben Yedder couldn't have come much closer to adding a third when he prodded Nolito's cross goalwards only for goal line technology to decide the whole ball hadn't crossed the line by the finest of margins before it was scooped away by a Spartak defender. That intervention became even more important 12 minutes from time when Ze Luis brought the visitors back into the game when he swept home on the rebound after Rico had denied Glushakov. But on a poor week for Spanish clubs in Champions League action as Real Madrid fell to defeat at Tottenham Hotspur, Barcelona drew a blank away to Olympiakos and Atletico Madrid look set to crash out after being held by Qarabag, Sevilla held on to salvage some pride for La Liga."
94,11/10/2017,18:38,Sevilla's Pareja to undergo groin operation,"Sevilla's Argentine international centre-back Nico Pareja will go under the knife on Thursday to fix a groin injury, his La Liga team said on Wednesday.","Pareja, the Sevilla captain, faces ""several weeks"" on the sidelines following his operation in Barcelona, Sevilla said. The 33-year-old first felt the injury in February but went on to finish the season nonetheless. The injury bothered him again in August against Getafe when he had to be substituted. He had been receiving treatment for the injury since but with no cure in sight, club and player have decided Pareja needs an operation. He has one Argentina cap, in a 1-0 friendly win over Brazil in November 2010, but was an unused part of Argentina's 2011 Copa America squad and played in the Olympic team in Beijing in 2008."
95,30/09/2017,18:38,Sevilla go second by piling misery on Malaga,Sevilla moved up to second in La Liga as second-half goals from Ever Banega and Luis Muriel ensured a routine 2-0 Andalusian derby victory over winless Malaga on Saturday.,"A sixth defeat in seven games pushes Malaga boss and legendary former Real Madrid player Michel ever closer to becoming already the fourth managerial change of the La Liga season. The hosts did, though, have to wait until 22 minutes from time to open the scoring from the penalty spot and with some fortune when Roberto Rosales was harshly adjudged to have brought down Joaquin Correa inside the box. Banega coolly dispatched the spot-kick and just two minutes later Muriel showed great pace to burst clear from the halfway line into the Malaga box before firing inside Roberto's near post. Victory moves Sevilla to within two points of leaders Barcelona, who host Las Palmas on Sunday. However, Atletico Madrid can retake second spot with a win later on Saturday at Leganes. Earlier, former West Bromwich Albion manager Pepe Mel's job at Deportivo la Coruna was saved by a second-half fightback to beat Getafe 2-1. Amath Ndiaye put the visitors in front at La Riazor, but Lucas Perez levelled with his first goal since returning to the club on loan from Arsenal before Florin Andone grabbed the winner three minutes from time."
96,26/09/2017,22:53,Ben Yedder hat-trick eases Sevilla past Maribor,French forward Wissam Ben Yedder hit a hat-trick as Sevilla soared to the top of Champions League Group E by cruising to a 3-0 win over Slovenian champions Maribor on Tuesday.,"Ben Yedder produced clinical finishes from close range twice in 11 first-half minutes to put the hosts well on course for victory before completing his hat-trick with a penalty seven minutes from time. Liverpool's 1-1 draw at Spartak Moscow sees the Spaniards lead the group with four points to Liverpool and Spartak's two. Ben Yedder's inclusion was one of seven changes made by Sevilla boss Eduardo Berizzo from Saturday's 2-0 defeat at Atletico Madrid. And Sevilla carried much more of a potent threat in the final third with he and Joaquin Correa recalled up front. The two combined for the opening goal when Correa's cut-back was slotted home at the near post by Ben Yedder. A flowing team move saw Sevilla double their advantage seven minutes before the break as Ben Yedder latched onto Franco Vazquez's through ball inside the area before firing with unerring accuracy in off the far post. Sevilla were happy to take the sting out of the game after the break with an important three points assured. However, Ben Yedder got the chance to take his Champions League tally to six in four games this season when Sebastien Corchia was felled inside the area. And the striker didn't disappoint by slotting low into Jasmin Handanovic's bottom left-hand corner."
97,14/09/2017,02:16,Klopp at peace after stormy Sevilla conclusion,Jurgen Klopp claimed he had made peace with opposite number Eduardo Berizzo and the Sevilla coaching staff after a stormy conclusion to Liverpool's 2-2 Champions League draw with the Spanish side at Anfield.,"Young Liverpool defender Joe Gomez was sent off in the dying seconds of the group game, the second 'dismissal' of the night after Berizzo had been sent to the stands on the hour for throwing the ball away after Gomez hurried to take a throw-in for the home team. On the final whistle on Liverpool's return to the competition after two years, members of Berizzo's staff appeared to remonstrate with Klopp as the two benches walked down the tunnel. ""It's all fine. I thought they might have been responsible for the red card,"" explained Klopp. ""But I don't think I had a percentage of influence on his (manager's) position to be honest. ""I was not happy with him throwing the ball away but we're fine. He invited me into the dressing room and we spoke about it. ""But in this situation I was not exceptionally emotional. It was an offensive situation for us, taking a throw-in, and somebody threw the ball away. But I didn't send him to the stand!"" Strangely, the Argentinian manager claimed he was wasting his own team's time to make amends for an incident in the first half when he had been warned by Dutch referee Danny Makkelie for a similar offence. ""In the first half, when we were winning and Liverpool were on the counter attack, I did something that wasn't right, I threw the ball away to waste time,"" said Berizzo. ""I realised that was a mistake and in the second half, when the ball came to me and we were losing, I decided to throw the ball away to try and make up for what I did in the first half. ""I've had a chat with Klopp and explained exactly that I wanted to put right my initial mistake. He accepted that."" Berizzo could be satisfied with his evening's work after Joaquin Correa grabbed a late equaliser for the visitors. Liverpool, in contrast, were left counting the cost of a Roberto Firmino penalty miss with the Brazilian hitting the post just before the interval. Firmino and Mohamed Salah had earlier put the hosts 2-1 in front, cancelling out an early effort from Wissam Ben Yedder. ""Of course I'm not happy with the result but I'm happy with a big part of the game,"" he said. ""A lot of times when good teams play each other, the games are kind of boring, but this game was the opposite. And that was due to the desire, the passion, the greed of my team. ""Disappointment and frustration are completely normal. We're responsible for the very, very, very good parts in the game and also responsible for the not so good parts. That means you have to take it and use it, you have to feel disappointment."" Klopp had the consolation of seeing Brazilian star Philippe Coutinho return, as a substitute for the final 15 minutes, for his first action since his potential summer move to Barcelona collapsed. ""Philippe trained the last few days really, really well,"" said Klopp. 2Maybe tonight in one or two situations he was not lucky but that was him without rhythm. ""It helped him that he could play tonight in the long-term, that's for sure.2"
98,16/07/2017,22:14,Sevilla sign Nolito from Man City,"Sevilla signed Spanish international winger Nolito from Manchester City, the La Liga club announced on Sunday.","The 30-year-old, who only joined City from Celta Vigo a year ago, moved for a reported fee of nine million euros ($10.3m) and has signed a three-year contract. ""Nolito is with Sevilla for the next three seasons, until June 2020,"" the club said in a statement on their website. Nolito has scored six international goals in 16 appearances, but struggled to nail down a regular first-team place under City coach Pep Guardiola last term. He will take the place of Vitolo at the Ramon Sanchez-Pizjuan, after his Spain team-mate left for Atletico Madrid earlier this week, and be reunited with Sevilla head coach Eduardo Berizzo, who he played under for two years at Celta. Berizzo will hope Nolito can refind the form that saw him score 39 La Liga goals in 100 appearances from 2013-2016 while he was with Celta. The deal caps a good week for Sevilla, after also capturing Colombian forward Luis Muriel from Sampdoria on Tuesday. The club have now made four close-season signings in total since Berizzo joined as head coach in May, after Jorge Sampaoli left for the Argentina national side. Berizzo is looking to build on an excellent season last term, in which Sampaoli led Sevilla to a fourth-placed finish and a place in the Champions League."
99,12/07/2017,20:31,France full-back Corchia set for Sevilla,"French international right-back Sebastien Corchia is set to join Spanish side Sevilla from Lille, sources close to the deal told AFP on Wednesday.","The agreement reached between the two clubs should see Sevilla pay five million euros ($5.7 million) for the 26-year-old, who will sign a four-year contract, the source said. Lille director general Marc Ingla confirmed that Corchia was set to undergo a medical in Spain before signing his contract with Sevilla. Corchia joined Lille from Sochaux in 2014 and has appeared in several France squads, winning his first and only cap to date in a friendly against the Ivory Coast last November. Sevilla finished fourth in La Liga last season to qualify for the Champions League and have since named Eduardo Berizzo as coach to replace the departing Jorge Sampaoli. Lille, who have appointed the enigmatic Argentine Marcelo Bielsa as coach, had already moved to cover his departure by signing another right-back, Kevin Malcuit from Saint-Etienne."
100,16/04/2017,18:28,Sevilla slump continues in Valencia stalemate,Sevilla's alarming slump in form continued but the visitors were grateful to escape with a point from a 0-0 draw at Valencia on Sunday.,"Valencia were denied a fourth consecutive win as Italian striker Simone Zaza had a goal ruled out for handball 17 minutes from time. Sevilla's best effort saw Stevan Jovetic hit the post early on, but Jorge Sampaoli's men have now won just one of their last eight games in all competitions. A point means Sevilla trail third-placed Atletico Madrid by three points in the battle for automatic Champions League qualification. However, they enjoy a comfortable eight-point lead over fifth-placed Villarreal, who travel to Alaves on Monday. Earlier, Leo Baptistao struck in stoppage time to hand Espanyol a 1-0 win at Leganes."
101,04/04/2017,01:26,Barca visit hands Sampaoli last chance to impress,Jorge Sampaoli has a final shot to further his case to land his dream job at the end of the season when his slumping Sevilla side travel to Barcelona on Wednesday.,"Sampaoli looked to be at the head of the queue when Barca boss Luis Enrique announced he would step down at the end of the campaign little over a month ago. However, since then Sevilla have been knocked out of the Champions League by Leicester City and tumbled out of contention for the La Liga title with Atletico Madrid passing them into third place. Sampaoli's future at the Sanchez Pizjuan is far from clear with long-term sporting director Monchi's decision to leave last week adding further uncertainty. What does seem obvious, though, is that Sampaoli would jump at the chance to coach compatriot Lionel Messi and Barca's host of other stars next season. ""I want to manage Messi to be able to watch him from the sideline every day."" Sampaoli told Argentine newspaper Ole last week. ""It is a unique dream to be able to see the best in the world up close."" Sampaoli may get his wish to coach Messi, albeit not on a daily basis with the Argentine Football Association reportedly set to offer him the chance to salvage their faltering World Cup qualifying campaign. Barca, meanwhile, look set to go in another direction with Athletic Bilbao coach Ernesto Valverde and Enrique's assistant Juan Carlos Unzue emerging as the favourites to take over next season. Wednesday's clash gives Sampaoli one last chance to impress the Barca hierarchy, whilst the Sevilla squad are focused on booking their place in next season's Champions League without needing to win a trick August qualifier by beating out Atletico for third place. ""It is difficult for us to accept right now, but we have to turn it around because we are the same team as five games ago when we were second,"" said striker Stefan Jovetic after a frustrating 0-0 draw at home to third bottom Sporting Gijon on Saturday. Unfortunately for Sevilla, though, Messi is back after missing his last two games for club and country through suspension. ""It is very difficult for a team with Leo playing well to lose,"" added Sampaoli. The five-time World Player of the Year's absence didn't prove a fatal blow to Barca's title hopes as Luis Suarez and Neymar both scored in Sunday's 4-1 win at Granada to remain just two points behind La Liga leaders Real Madrid. All three are set to be reunited, whilst Gerard Pique and Andres Iniesta also return for Barca after being rested from the start against Granada. Madrid also have a game in hand, but Barca can ramp up the pressure on their title rivals by going top with victory before Real travel to Leganes later on Wednesday. Fixtures (all times GMT)"
102,30/03/2017,22:48,Monchi leaves Sevilla amid Roma reports,"Sevilla said Thursday that highly respected sporting director Ramon Rodriguez Verdejo, better known as ""Monchi"", was leaving the club after guiding it through its most successful era.","Spanish media reports say Monchi, who has admirers across Europe, will go to Roma in Italy in a similar role. ""FC Sevilla and Ramon Rodriguez Verdejo, Monchi, have reached a deal for the departure of the club's sporting director,"" the club announced in a short statement, adding a press conference would be held Friday with further details. Since taking over as sporting director in 2000 the former goalkeeper has helped guide Sevilla from Spain's second division to five Europa League or UEFA Cup titles. Moreover, Monchi did it while raking in hundreds of millions of euros as the likes of Dani Alves, Sergio Ramos and Ivan Rakitic headed for greener pastures and replacing them at a fraction of the cost. In a February interview with AFP he hinted at a move: ""I have said many times that France and Italy are the models that are perhaps the leagues that attract me most because the figure of sporting director has more weight."""
103,29/03/2017,19:41,Sevilla ordered to close terrace over Ramos abuse,"Obscene chants from Sevilla fans targeting former favourite Sergio Ramos earned the La Liga team a one-match partial stadium closure, Spanish football authorities ruled on Wednesday.",The incidents took place at a highly charged January 16 La Liga encounter when Sevilla ended Real Madrid's 40-match unbeaten streak at the Ramon Sanchez Pizjuan. It was the third game in 10 days between the sides including a home and away Copa del Rey clash decided by a dramatic late Ramos header. In a volatile atmosphere Sevilla came from 1-0 down with five minutes to go to defeat Madrid 2-1 deep in injury time as passion from the terraces spilled over into hate chants against the charismatic Ramos. Sevilla will have to close one stand as punishment.

On-loan Manchester City midfielder Nasri felt Vardy conned the official by making too much of the clash to get the Frenchman sent off: ""For me he's a cheat because if he was a foreign player you, the English press, would be saying he's a cheat. They were winning 2-0, play the game like a man."" But Shakespeare responded on Thursday with a strong defence of Vardy. ""Jamie's not a cheat and never has been, never will be. I think Jamie responded well to the comment and we have to put it to bed,"" he said. ""The game has gone, the referee made his decision and we have to move on."""
105,14/03/2017,23:51,Sinking Sevilla up there with title win - Shakespeare,"Leicester City's achievement of reaching the Champions League quarter-finals stands comparison with last season's fairytale Premier League title success, according to new manager Craig Shakespeare.","Wes Morgan and Marc Albrighton struck at the King Power Stadium on Tuesday and Kasper Schmeichel saved a late penalty as Leicester beat Sevilla 2-0 to record a famous 3-2 aggregate win. Shakespeare has now won all three games since stepping into the vacancy created by Claudio Ranieri's sacking after the first leg and he said beating Sevilla -- Europa League winners in the last three seasons -- ranked alongside the club's greatest feats. ""I think it has to stand right up there because of the quality of the opposition,"" he told his post-match press conference. ""When the draw was made, everyone said, 'Ooh, Seville.' We knew what they're about. It has to stand up there with all the achievements. ""Of course when you win the league it's over a lot more games, but the quality of the opposition means this has to stand right up there."" Morgan, who opened the scoring with an untidy 27th-minute finish, said Leicester had ""pulled off the impossible again"". ""We proved a lot of people wrong and pulled off the impossible again,"" the centre-back told BT Sport. ""Incredible. I can't quite believe it. We are newcomers in the Champions League, didn't expect to get this far and here we are."" Leicester will find out their last-eight opponents in Friday's draw and Morgan was relaxed about which of Europe's heavyweights they will face next. ""We will take whoever comes,"" said Morgan, whose side have never previously reached the last eight of Europe's top club competition. ""It is a fantastic night for Leicester. We still need to concentrate on the league, but we will enjoy this moment."" Sevilla saw Samir Nasri sent off after he was shown a second yellow card for lowering his head towards Jamie Vardy's face, while coach Jorge Sampaoli was sent to the stands in the dying stages. ""It's not for me to evaluate why he was sent off,"" Sampaoli said of Nasri's 74th-minute dismissal. ""It's the referee who decides, not me. I was never going to take him off (to protect him from a second yellow card)."" Sampaoli added: ""I think maybe we lost it on one or two fine details. We didn't manage to finish our chances. ""We had control of the ball in the second half and had three decent chances, but that was when they scored their second goal. ""But despite the difficult circumstances, I'm pleased with how the team tried to get back into the game until the last minute."""
106,14/03/2017,22:46,Schmeichel thwarts Sevilla as Leicester rekindle fairytale,Kasper Schmeichel pulled off a dramatic late penalty save as Leicester City sank Sevilla 2-0 on Tuesday to reach the Champions League quarter-finals for the first time.,"Trailing 2-1 from the first leg, after which Claudio Ranieri was sacked as manager, Leicester scored through Wes Morgan and Marc Albrighton before Schmeichel repelled Steven N'Zonzi's spot-kick. It gave them a 3-2 aggregate win and continued a remarkable turnaround under new manager Craig Shakespeare, who has won three games in a row since stepping up from his role as Ranieri's assistant. Unrecognisable in the defence of their miraculous Premier League title, Leicester have found solace in the Champions League and have now won all four of their home matches in the competition. They also chose a good time to rediscover a bit of defensive solidity -- and good fortune -- having previously gone 12 matches without keeping a clean sheet in all competitions. Sevilla, winners of the last three Europa Leagues, saw Samir Nasri sent off late on after he was shown an extraordinary second yellow card for aiming a headbutt at Jamie Vardy. N'Zonzi might yet have taken the game to extra time after Schmeichel was penalised for catching Vitolo after the forward had dinked a shot past him. But the Dane redeemed himself with a save low to his left, thwarting Sevilla's hopes of reaching the last eight for the first time since 1958. The back-to-back 3-1 wins against Liverpool and Hull City overseen by Shakespeare had restored Leicester's self-belief and the stadium crackled with anticipation prior to kick-off. A carpet of blue and white flags greeted the teams, while Leicester's fans unveiled a giant banner of Shakespeare, accompanied by the rousing William Shakespeare quote: ""Let slip the dogs of war."" For all the sound and fury generated by the home support, it was Sevilla who procured the first two sights of goal. Nasri, one of eight changes made by Jorge Sampaoli, was denied by a one-handed save from Schmeichel in the fourth minute, while Pablo Sarabia dragged wide with his left foot. But in the 27th minute Leicester took control of the tie, Riyad Mahrez swinging a free-kick into the box after Vicente Iborra had felled Vardy and Morgan bundling home with his right knee. The King Power Stadium erupted with a noise that recalled the triumphs of last year and short of a mishit Gabriel Mercado cross that Schmeichel had to palm over, Leicester reached the break without alarm. Sampaoli made two changes at half-time, sending on Mariano Ferreira and Stevan Jovetic for Mercado and Sarabia, and eight minutes in his side came within millimetres of restoring their advantage. Sergio Escudero let fly with a fluttering effort from 35 yards that crashed against the bar before bouncing down and out, with Jovetic hoisting the rebound over. Barely a minute later Leicester took the lead in the tie outright. Mahrez's cross from the right was tamely headed away by Adil Rami, allowing Albrighton to chest the ball down and arrow a left-foot drive past a statuesque Sergio Rico. Nasri's moment of madness arrived shortly after Schmeichel had parried from substitute Joaquin Correa. With play ongoing, the Frenchman, taking exception to a push from Vardy, squared up to the England striker and lowered his head, prompting a second yellow card from referee Daniele Orsato. Orsato was not prepared to abandon centre-stage and after awarding Sevilla's penalty, he compounded the visitors' frustrations by sending the protesting Sampaoli to the stands."
107,22/02/2017,22:44,Vardy gives Leicester hope in Sevilla defeat,Jamie Vardy's first Champions League goal gave Leicester City a lifeline in their last 16 tie despite going down 2-1 to Sevilla in Wednesday's first leg.,"Goals from Pablo Sarabia and Joaquin Correa had given Sevilla a deserved 2-0 lead, whilst Correa also saw a penalty saved by the inspired Kasper Schmeichel. However, despite Sevilla's dominance, Schmeichel's heroics and Vardy's strike means the English champions are well in the tie ahead of the second leg at home on March 14. The two sides couldn't be in more contrasting form with Sevilla just three points off the top of La Liga, whilst Leicester face a relegation battle just a year after defying all the odds to win the Premier League. Sevilla's first big chance arrived 14 minutes in when Correa showed more fight and fleetness of foot than the Leicester defence inside the area and was chopped down by visiting captain Wes Morgan. Correa won a battle with his teammates to take the spot-kick, but was less successful with a tame effort that Schmeichel easily collected. The Dane then showed fine reflexes to get down low to his left to parry Sergio Escudero's low driven effort from the edge of the box. Sevilla finally made their superiority count 24 minutes in when Escudero's cross from the left was met with a powerful header from his opposite wing-back Sarabia that nestled in the far corner for his ninth goal of the season. The one way traffic continued as Stefan Jovetic's looping long-range effort was turned over by Schmeichel before the 'keeper produced another stunning stop to once again deny Correa. Leicester didn't have a single effort on goal in the first-half, but did at least test Sergio Rico early in the second period, albeit with a routine save when he collected Wilfred Ndidi's volley from range. Vitolo then nearly undid Schmeichel's good work in the first half with an audacious effort from the narrowest of angles that clipped the inside of the Leicester 'keeper's near post. Just as the visitors were beginning to gain a foothold, Sevilla doubled their lead as Jovetic held off two Leicester defenders then laid the ball perfectly into Correa's path to finish high past Schmeichel from close range. However, Claudio Ranieri's men responded to get an away goal that could prove vital in three weeks' time. Danny Drinkwater broke down the left and his low cross was turned home on the stretch by Vardy for his first goal since December. Leicester still had to see out a late onslaught as Sevilla sought to restore their two-goal advantage. Adil Rami came closest when his thunderous header came back off the bar, but Leicester held out to maintain hope their maiden Champions League campaign can stretch into the last eight."
108,21/02/2017,21:06,Ranieri seeks matadors inside faltering Leicester,"Under fire Leicester City manager Claudio Ranieri on Tuesday called on his players to show the courage of ""matadors"" to cause a huge Champions League shock against high-flying Spaniards Sevilla.","A year on from winning the Premier League title against all the odds, Ranieri's men lie just a point above the relegation zone. However, the Italian hopes that with the pressure lifted on their return to Champions League action, Leicester can summon the spirit of last season. ""I want the gladiator, the matadors,"" said Ranieri when asked if his players would be lambs to the slaughter at the daunting Sanchez Pizjuan. ""We know they are better than us, but we know we can fight. ""We have to fight with our heads held high and chests out."" The contrast in form and European pedigree between the sides couldn't be starker with Sevilla flying high in La Liga and having won the Europa League in each of the past three seasons. ""We are serious underdogs. If you look at what Sevilla have achieved in the past 10 years they are used to staying at the top,"" added Ranieri. However, having saved their best for the Champions League so far this season, Ranieri is hoping a famous European night can turn their campaign around. ""Tomorrow could be the turning point. If we lose nothing happens, but if we win something inside could change and we need one match like this."" Record signing Islam Slimani hasn't recovered from injury so Jamie Vardy is likely to start on his own up front for the visitors. The England international's dip in form has been a key reason to Leicester's change in fortunes this season, but he too is hoping a relief from the pressures of the Premier League will unleash their best. ""It's going to be a big game, we just hope we can make it a memorable one,"" said Vardy. ""It is a game where we can just forget about that for one night and hopefully if we get a good performance we can use that to kick on and pull ourselves away from the relegation zone."" Leicester's disastrous form also saw them dumped out of the FA Cup in embarrassing fashion in a 1-0 defeat to 10-man Millwall of the third tier League One on Saturday. However, Ranieri is set to recall a host of first team regulars after making 10 changes against Millwll as the likes of Vardy and Riyad Mahrez should return. Sevilla boss Jorge Sampaoli highlighted Vardy as Leicester's major threat. ""Vardy was decisive last year and his lack of goals explains Leicester's current problems,"" said the Argentine. ""When Vardy starts scoring we will once again see the Leicester that are extremely dangerous."" Sampaoli, though, admitted the pressure building on Ranieri is inevitable unless results drastically improve. ""Now no one talks about the team that won the league in an incredible and historic way, but of the present when they are not playing well and fighting against relegation,"" he added. ""Common sense would say that someone who achieved so much from a team with so little can turn the situation around, but time waits for no one, not even someone as good as Ranieri who won the Premier League."" Sevilla's only absences are at the back with Gabriel Mercado and Nico Pareja missing through suspension and injury respectively. Sampaoli is expected to make just two changes from the side that beat Eibar 2-0 on Saturday to remain third in La Liga, with Brazilian right-back Mariano and Spanish international Vitolo coming into the side."
109,15/01/2017,22:39,Real Madrid's 40-game unbeaten run ended by Sevilla,A stunning stoppage time winner from Stevan Jovetic ended Real Madrid's Spanish record 40-game unbeaten run on Sunday as Sevilla scored twice in the final five minutes to win 2-1 at the Sanchez Pizjuan.,"Cristiano Ronaldo's penalty put Madrid in front 23 minutes from time, but Sergio Ramos's own goal levelled before Jovetic, making his La Liga debut on loan from Inter Milan, curled home from 25 yards. Victory takes Sevilla ahead of Barcelona into second and to within a point of Real at the top of the table, but Madrid also have a game in hand. ""I couldn't imagine a better start,"" Jovetic told BeIN Sports Spain after only arriving in Seville on Tuesday. Defeat ends a marvellous run for Zinedine Zidane's men, who haven't tasted defeat since losing to Wolfsburg on April 6. However, the Frenchman urged his players to shrug off their disappointment with Real still well-placed to win a first ever treble of La Liga, Copa del Rey and Champions League. ""We did the most difficult thing which was to score the goal and with such little time left they caught us out twice, which is the disappointing thing,"" said Zidane. ""I have to be very proud of them all for what we have done until now. ""We know this was going to happen some day, it is today, and now we have to continue working hard in all competitions."" Sevilla had been just seconds away from ending Real's run just four days ago until Karim Benzema's stoppage time equaliser allowed Real to advance 6-3 on aggregate in the Copa del Rey after a 3-3 draw on Thursday. However, the bad blood from that match boiled over as former Sevilla favourite Ramos's clash with the most fervent section of the home support continued with the Real captain roundly jeered every time he touched the ball. And the home fans took extra delight as it was Ramos, so often Real's saviour with important late goals, who inspired Sevilla's fightback when he turned into his own net before Jovetic struck in the most dramatic of circumstances. Until the final five minutes Real had looked defensively solid as Zidane switched to a back three to match up with Sevilla's favoured formation. And in contrast to Thursday's goal fest, the sides cancelled each other out in an intense first 45 minutes short on clear-cut chances. Ronaldo had the best opportunity of the first-half when he sliced wide from Benzema's dangerous cross. However, the match and title race, looked to be swinging decisively in Real's favour when Sergio Rico clipped the heels of Dani Carvajal as the Madrid full-back burst into the area midway through the second-half. Despite Vitolo's best attempts to damage the penalty spot as Ronaldo prepared to take, the Portuguese comfortably dispatched the ball into the bottom corner for his 23rd goal against Sevilla. Real's run has been littered with late goals and fightbacks, but for once the European champions were on the receiving end of a stunning turnaround late on. Firstly, Pablo Sarabia's fiercely dipping free-kick caught Ramos off guard as he powered a header into his own net. The Spanish international nearly scored another own goal seconds later as he turned Jovetic's dangerous drive over the bar But Jovetic grabbed his second goal in as many games for the Europa League holders two minutes into stoppage time when he curled the ball into the top corner from despite Navas getting a hand to his effort."

112,22/11/2016,23:54,10-man Sevilla furious as Juventus fightback to qualify,Sevilla were left fuming at English referee Mark Clattenburg as Juventus came from behind to win 3-1 in Spain and seal their place in the last 16 of the Champions League on Tuesday.,"The hosts made the perfect start through Nico Pareja's ninth minute opener, but were reduced to 10 men after just 36 minutes when Franco Vazquez was shown a second yellow card by Clattenburg. A controversial Juventus penalty converted by Claudio Marchisio followed and Sevilla coach Jorge Sampaoli was also sent to the stands before two goals in the final six minutes from Leonardo Bonucci and Mario Mandzukic ensured the Italian champions' progress. By contrast, Sevilla's first defeat in Group H means they have to avoid defeat by a two-goal margin away to Lyon in two weeks to guarantee their place in the last 16. ""When they went down to ten men, they closed down all the space and we made several mistakes. Fortunately my left foot came to the rescue,"" Bonucci told UEFA.com. ""We can celebrate because we reached our first objective, but now we have many others."" However, Sevilla winger Vitolo claimed it was Clattenburg who changed the game. ""Today two decisions from the referee have harmed us,"" the Spanish international told BeIN Sports Spain. ""At 1-0 we were playing well, in control and taking the game to them; we didn't have many problems. ""All of a sudden we are left with a man less and he has given a penalty that for me you can't give."" Juventus travelled to Spain shorn of a number of key players, including first choice strike pairing Gonzalo Higuain and Paulo Dybala, and got off to the worst possible start. A corner from the right was only partially cleared and the loose ball was expertly dispatched into the bottom corner from the edge of the area by Pareja. Sergio Escudero nearly added a spectacular second as his volleyed effort flew just over the bar. However, ugly clashes between the two sets of fans on Monday night that left one Belgian Juventus fan in hospital, spiled onto the pitch in a bad-tempered encounter in which Clattenburg became the protagonist. Vazquez's poorly timed trip on Sami Khedira just inside the Sevilla half was shown no mercy by the official who took charge of last season's Champions League final. Sevilla were far more infuriated in first-half stoppage time, though, as Clattenburg pointed to the spot when a series of bodies went to ground from a Juventus corner. Sergio Rico got a hand to Marchisio's spot-kick, but couldn't keep the midfielder's effort out. Sampaoli's frustrations with Clattenburg continued after the break and he too was sent to the stands early in the second-half. Rico had rarely been troubled, though, until centre-back Bonucci strode forward and hammered a loose ball from 25 yards low and hard into the bottom corner. And with Sevilla exposed chasing a late equaliser, Mandzukic added a third deep into stoppage time to leave Juventus needing just to beat the pointless Dinamo Zagreb at home in their final game to seal top spot in the Group."
113,21/11/2016,15:30,Under-strength Juventus offer Sevilla route to last 16,Sevilla have a golden opportunity to seal their return to the Champions League last 16 for the first time in seven years when a Juventus side lacking firepower visits the Sanchez Pizjuan on Tuesday.,"Despite winning three consecutive Europa League titles, Sevilla have struggled to take the step up to Europe's premier club competition in recent years, missing out on the last 16 to Juventus and Manchester City last season. However, a repeat of their win over the Italian champions at the fortress Sanchez Pizjuan 11 months ago would seal Sevilla's place in the last 16 as group winners. Three wins following a 0-0 draw in Turin on matchday one means even a point would be enough to seal qualification, but Sevilla boss Jorge Sampaoli insists Sevilla will start with far more attacking intent than in their last meeting against Juventus. ""We neutralised them but we didn't attack. The idea is to change that because if we restrict ourselves to neutralising them then at some point I am sure Juve will score against us,"" said Sampaoli on Monday. ""The idea will be different and we will see if what we propose is enough to give us the victory."" Sampaoli will have the luxury of welcoming back a host of first-team regulars he rested for Saturday's last gasp 3-2 win at Deportivo la Coruna. Spanish international Vitolo, Adil Rami and Franco Vazquez are set to return with the only doubt concerning Samir Nasri's fitness. The French playmaker trained on Monday despite carrying a hamstring injury. ""He will have a fitness test at six (on Tuesday) and if he is fit he will play,"" added Sampaoli. Nasri, meanwhile, believes Sevilla's sights should be set further than just the last 16. ""We want to get to the quarter-finals. It would be very prestigious for the club to be among the eight best in Europe,"" he told UEFA.com. Juventus boss Massimiliano Allegri has far more injury concerns as 90-million euro striker Gonzalo Higuain was left back in Italy due to a left thigh injury suffered in Saturday's 3-0 win over Pescara. With Higuain's fellow Argentine international teammate Paulo Dybala also sidelined, 16-year-old Moise Kean is one of only two strikers included in Allegri's 20-man squad. Medhi Benatia and Andrea Barzagli also miss out so Daniele Rugani is set to deputise alongside Leonardo Bonucci and Giorgio Chiellini in defence. Juventus were expected to launch a significant challenge to win the Champions League this season after five consecutive Serie A titles and a summer splurge in the transfer market. However, home draws to Sevilla and Lyon mean the two-time European champions need to win in Spain to guarantee their place in the last 16. Allegri's men do though have the insurance policy of a home game against the pointless Dinamo Zagreb in two weeks' time should they fail to join Barcelona as they only visiting side to win at the Sanchez Pizjuan so far this season."
114,21/11/2016,02:01,Spotlight on Ronaldo for European homecoming,worldfootball looks ahead to Tuesday's Champions League action as Cristiano Ronaldo goes back to first club Sporting Lisbon and Tottenham Hotspur face a crunch trip to Monaco (kick-offs 1945 GMT unless stated):,"<strong>Group E</strong> At Moscow (1700 GMT) CSKA Moscow (RUS) v Bayer Leverkusen (GER) Morale is on the floor in Moscow with CSKA bottom of Group E before Leverkusen's visit. The defending Russian champions this week saw their midfielder Roman Eremenko hit with a two-year ban for cocaine use after a positive test following the reverse fixture between the teams in September. Eremenko's goal in that match gave CSKA a 2-2 draw after being two goals down. The Muscovites registered their first win in five league games at the weekend and must win this game to keep alive their hopes of reaching the last 16. Leverkusen can progress by avoiding defeat, provided Tottenham Hotspur lose away to Monaco. The Germans are unbeaten in the section, following up three draws by beating Tottenham at Wembley last time out. However, they are struggling in mid-table in the Bundesliga having lost at home to RB Leipzig at the weekend. At Monaco Monaco (FRA) v Tottenham Hotspur (ENG) Tottenham travel to the Mediterranean principality boosted by claiming a first win in eight matches at the weekend, when they beat West Ham United 3-2 after a dramatic late fightback in the Premier League. Mauricio Pochettino's side are in real trouble in the Champions League having lost at home to Monaco and Bayer Leverkusen. They will be eliminated if they fail to win at the Stade Louis II and Leverkusen better their result when they face CSKA Moscow in Russia. Monaco need only draw the game to be sure of a place in the last 16. They will secure first place if they win and Leverkusen drop points. Leonardo Jardim's side are the leading scorers in Europe's big five leagues, averaging three goals a game in Ligue 1, including a 3-0 win at Lorient on Friday. Leading their attack is a revitalised Radamel Falcao, with the Colombian having netted nine times in all competitions this season. The teams drew 1-1 here in the Europa League last season. Toby Alderweireld and Ben Davies are on the sidelines for Spurs and Erik Lamela, who scored at the Stade Louis II last season, is also doubtful. <strong>Group F</strong> At Dortmund, Germany Borussia Dortmund (GER) v Legia Warsaw (POL) Dortmund, the 1997 winners and 2013 runners-up, are already certain to progress to the last 16 having amassed 10 points from their first four matches. Thomas Tuchel's side are now looking to secure top spot and a win at home to already-eliminated Legia will guarantee them first place, as long as Real Madrid drop points at Sporting Lisbon. At the very least, a win will ensure the Bundesliga club go to Madrid next month in a position to clinch the group. Dortmund are fresh from beating Bayern Munich 1-0 in ""Der Klassiker"" at the weekend thanks to Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang's 12th Bundesliga goal of the season. The Gabon star was also on target as Dortmund won 6-0 away to Legia in their group opener in September. Legia, who remain in with a chance of finishing third and going into the Europa League, have improved since a poor start to the campaign. The Poles have won five of their last six games, the exception being a 3-3 draw at home to Real Madrid. At Lisbon Sporting Lisbon (POR) v Real Madrid (ESP) Cristiano Ronaldo takes on his first professional club Sporting as a champion of Europe with Real and Portugal and is widely expected to pick up his fourth Ballon d'Or. He will doubtless receive a hero's welcome on his return to the Estadio Jose Alvalade. Ronaldo's hat-trick this weekend, his 39th for Real, delivered a 3-0 away win at Atletico Madrid despite the visitors missing six key players in captain Sergio Ramos, Pepe, Casemiro, Toni Kroos, Alvaro Morata and Karim Benzema. Champions League holders Real won the reverse fixture 2-1 and are unbeaten in 29 games in all competitions. All Zinedine Zidane's men need here is a point to secure passage to the next round, but with Dortmund top of the group by two points Real will want to hunt them down as a point of pride -- and to earn an easier draw in the next round. Sporting are on an upturn and scoring regularly and are still in with a chance of the Europa League. <strong>Group G</strong> At Leicester, England Leicester City (ENG) v Club Brugge (BEL) English champions Leicester top Group G with 10 points and have yet to concede a goal. Conversely, Brugge are yet to notch up a single point. A draw for the hosts would mean they progress to the next stage with a game to spare. Domestically, the unlikely Premier League champions have struggled to reproduce the form that delivered the title to the King Power Stadium and sit just two points above the relegation zone after a 2-1 weekend defeat to Watford. Claudio Ranieri's men however, including Jamie Vardy and Riyad Mahrez, who are on the Ballon d'Or list, are a different proposition in their maiden Champions League campaign. It even looks as if Ranieri is prioritising Europe over the Premier League. At Copenhagen FC Copenhagen (DEN) v Porto (POR) Copenhagen bagged a 1-1 draw away to second-placed Porto in September and are fighting for Champions League survival in this game, in which a win for the Portuguese would see them qualify. But Porto are misfiring with only two wins in their past five outings in all competitions while Stale Solbakken's charges are unbeaten in their five games at home in Europe this season. Porto go into the clash with the depressing effect of having lost a penalty shoot-out to Chaves in the Portuguese Cup at the weekend, while the hosts powered to yet another win in the league. A win for the Danes would see them leap-frog their opponents in the group. Has the makings of a classic. <strong>Group H</strong> At Seville, Spain Sevilla (ESP) v Juventus (ITA) This is arguably the match of the round with Sevilla top on 10 points and visitors Juve second on eight with a tight 0-0 draw in Italy in the reverse fixture. Sevilla are flying high in Spain after they produced a stunning fightback from 2-0 down to win 3-2 at Deportivo la Coruna. Argentine coach Jorge Sampaoli's version of Sevilla is thrilling fans after transforming the Europa League champions into a free-thinking outfit. Italian champions Juventus go into the showdown on the back of a 3-0 Serie A win over Pescara. ""It's an important game for us because we have to win one of our last two games to go through,"" coach Massimiliano Allegri said. Juve may have to do it the hard way with several defenders carrying knocks, but the forward line of Mario Mandzukic and Gonzalo Higuain is a frightening prospect for Sevilla. At Zagreb Dinamo Zagreb (CRO) v Lyon (FRA) Dinamo cannot qualify for the next round after a miserable Champions League campaign that has seen them fail to earn a point or even score a goal in four matches. They still have the consolation of the Europa League just about alive, but must win this game for starters. Lyon, with four points from four games, are only slightly better off and need a victory in Zagreb and for Juventus to fail to win to live another day. Lyon are fourth in Ligue 1 in France and their form has picked up in domestic competition after a slow start. Bafetimbi Gomis -- now at rivals Marseille -- scored four, including an eight-minute hat-trick, when Lyon won 7-1 in Zagreb in the 2011/12 group stage."
115,05/11/2016,15:34,Luis Enrique expects Sevilla title challenge,Barcelona coach Luis Enrique believes Sevilla will pose a serious threat to Spain's established top three for the La Liga title this season ahead of his side's trip to the Sanchez Pizjuan on Sunday.,"Sevilla lie fourth after 10 games, but just three points behind leaders Real Madrid, two adrift of Barca and level with Atletico Madrid. ""Without any doubt for what they have shown until now,"" said Enrique on Saturday when quizzed on Sevilla's ability to launch a title challenge. Sevilla have already beaten Atletico in winning all seven home games since Barca last visited in the Spanish Super Cup in August. However, Enrique's men have looked increasingly brittle in recent weeks without the injured Gerard Pique and Andres Iniesta and were beaten 3-1 by Manchester City in the Champions League on Tuesday. Yet, the Barca boss rounded on his critics and called for patience in judging his side until the end of the season. ""If I look at our first 40 minutes in Manchester, I think they are the best minutes of our era since I have been coach,"" he added. ""There is desperation to praise or criticise very quickly, but there has to be more rationality when analysing teams. At the end of the season is when I think it is just. ""You have a very recent example in our first year (2014/15). You (the media) vilified the coaching team and in the end we were the coaching staff that won most titles in the world that year."" Defeat against former Barca boss Pep Guardiola in midweek was Barca's third in their last 12 games. And with Real Madrid facing the easier challenge of Leganes at home and an two-week international break to come, Enrique is determined not to lose more ground in the title race. ""This is like the Tour of Spain or Tour de France (in cycling). You have to try not to lose it in the early stages to get to the key stages with a chance of winning. ""That means getting to February or March with a real and clear chance to win all of the titles. That is our objective."" Pique, Iniesta and Jordi Alba are all missing once more for the trip to Sevilla. Enrique is expected to make just change from the side that started against City with Rafinha or Arda Turan replacing Andre Gomes."
116,01/11/2016,16:51,Sampaoli laments Nasri loss as Sevilla eye last 16,"Europa League holders Sevilla finally look set to make their mark on the Champions League, but coach Jorge Sampaoli's in-form side will have to do without influential playmaker Samir Nasri for Wednesday's visit of Dinamo Zagreb.","Nasri has starred since joining on-loan from Manchester City as Sampaoli's excellent start in Seville has seen the Spanish side pick up seven points from their first three Group H games without even conceding a goal. However, the Frenchman picked up a hamstring injury in Saturday's 1-1 draw at Sporting Gijon that will keep him out for the visit of the Croatian champions and makes him a doubt for Barcelona's trip to the Sanchez Pizjuan on Sunday. ""It is a difficult situation because Nasri's performances recently have been excellent,"" said Sampaoli on Tuesday. Sevilla won three consecutive Europa League titles under former boss Unai Emery, but haven't reached the last 16 of the Champions League since the 2009/10 season. Victory over Zagreb will guarantee the Andalusians' place in the knockout stages as long as Lyon don't win at Juventus in the other game in the group. ""Hopefully, tomorrow in his (Nasri's) absence the team takes flight to achieve something exciting in the best competition in the world,"" added Sampaoli. ""We need to learn to play without him. It is difficult, but it is our obligation."" Sampaoli admitted there will also be other changes from the side that started against Sporting. However, the Argentine rejected suggestions he is resting players for the visit of Barca. ""I try to put out the best team for every game,"" he said. ""Right now I am thinking about tomorrow and after Zagreb we will think about Barcelona. Honestly, I am not thinking about the game on Sunday."" Dinamo have yet to take a point in the group and have lost all 10 of their last away games in the Champions League group stage. However, they have improved both domestically and in their one European outing under new coach Ivaylo Petev. A 1-0 defeat to Sevilla two weeks ago is Dinamo's only loss in six games under Petev and he expects more attacking threat from his side in Spain. ""We have to be brave,"" he told UEFA.com. ""I don't think I will change much from the first match in Zagreb. We didn't look dangerous in the first half in Zagreb, but after the break we had some chances to score. ""We had a team full of youngsters, so I can't say anything against them but I am sure we will be more dangerous in Seville."""
117,14/09/2016,22:57,"Higuain, Khedira fire blanks as Sevilla hold Juve","Gonzalo Higuain, Paulo Dybala and Sami Khedira fired blanks as Sevilla held dominant but wasteful Juventus to a scoreless draw in their Champions League opener in Turin on Wednesday.","Juventus welcomed the Europa League champions looking to stretch their 17-match unbeaten run at home in Europe with a win that would get the tournament co-favourites off the mark. But despite dominating for long periods, Higuain's first-half header notably coming off Sergio Rico's crossbar, the Serie A champions were left frustrated by Jorge Sampaoli's visitors. Sampaoli, who replaced current Paris Saint Germain coach Unai Emery over the summer, had promised attacking football from the Spanish league side. But they offered anything but in a game that, ultimately, went in their favour. In the opening minutes Higuain's midfield interception allowed Dybala to send Khedira through on goal, but the German skewed his shot wide of Rico's far post. When Dybala produced some magic with a superb mid-air lob to set up Khedira again, the central midfielder fired straight at the onrushing Rico. Sevilla finally fashioned a rare chance but Sergio Escudero's drive following a poor Juve clearance from a free kick was no problem for Gianluigi Buffon, who collected down low. Higuain then chested down for Dybala, but the striker could only get a touch as Rico came out to close down the move. Despite Bosnian midfielder Miralem Pjanic sitting on the bench after hitting his maiden goal for Juve on his first start last weekend, Allegri resisted the temptation to shake up his midfield at half-time. And initially, he looked to have made the right decision as Juve enjoyed another flurry of chances. Mario Lemina's intelligent ball for Evra saw the France defender bundle past Pablo Sarabia on the left to deliver for Higuain, but the cross came up short. A deft touch from Dybala with the outside of his boot sent Alves free down the right to leave the Sevilla defence desperately chasing back. Higuain rose to meet the ex-Barcelona winger's cross only to fire his header off the crossbar. Finally, the game looked to be coming to life. Indeed, even Sevilla were entertaining thoughts of scoring a goal. On 66 minutes second-half substitute Joaquin Correa did well to dribble his way past Giorgio Chiellini but his shot across the bows failed to worry Buffon. At the other end, Rico did brilliantly to get down low and push the ball to safety after Alves's low drive for Dybala a yard from the goalline. Allegri finally buckled, replacing Asamoah with Pjanic and Evra with fellow wing-back Alex Sandro with 22 minutes remaining. Juve continued to dominate, but Higuain spurned another chance when he sent Khedira's cross wide of the upright and five minutes later Pjanic dragged his shot wide of the posts. Higuain, on 80 minutes, fired wide and in the final seconds their frustration continued when Rico pulled off a great save down low to thwart Sandro when the Brazilian sent a diving header towards the near post."
118,13/09/2016,19:37,"Sampaoli wants 'desire, passion' from Sevilla","Sevilla coach Jorge Sampaoli wants ""desire and passion"" from his players as the Europa League champions look to kickstart their Champions League campaign by ending Juventus' impressive home record in Europe Wednesday.","""We have to go out and play with a lot of desire and passion because we're facing a team that has the potential to win the competition,"" Sampaoli told media at Juventus Stadium on Tuesday. ""I think they can win it. Because they have a great foundation of experienced players who have been at the club for many years, and they've recently added several top quality players."" Juventus, beaten finalists in 2015, face Sevilla in the group stages for the second successive year -- and will be hoping for a repeat of those results, give or take a tweak or two. The Serie A champions, defending a 17-match unbeaten run at home in UEFA competition, had Alvaro Morata and Simone Zaza to thank for the goals in a 2-0 win over Sevilla a year ago. On the return leg, ex-Juve striker Fernando Llorente's 65th minute winner was enough to secure victory for the Spaniards, who eventually finished third in the group to drop into the Europa League. It was a bittersweet defeat as Sevilla went on to win their third consecutive Europa League triumph under former coach Unai Emery. But over the summer, both clubs underwent several changes that, on paper, leave Juventus as the big favourites on Wednesday. While Emery took over Paris Saint Germain, Juventus went on a spending spree that, with the notable acquisitions of Gonzalo Higuain and Miralem Pjanic, has underlined their Champions League final credentials. On Higuain alone, Juve spent an Italian record of 90 million euros ($100 million). Sevilla spent 60m euros in total over the summer transfer period. ""Thankfully, football is a team game,"" added Sampaoli, a 56-year-old Argentinian who joined Sevilla in the summer after four successful years as coach of Chile. ""If it was a one-man game, it would be advantage Juventus on that score."" Higuain, who hit a new Serie A record of 36 goals for former side Napoli last season, was bought specifically to add potency to Juve's attack in key Serie A games and in Europe. Sevilla midfielder Franco Vazquez says Higuain is not the only danger, with Argentinian striker Paulo Dybala expected to work his magic up front for the hosts. ""He (Dybala) and indeed a lot of their players can make the difference in the final third of the pitch,"" said Vazquez. ""But we'll be trying to mark Higuain as much as possible."" But he said Sevilla won't be cowed by Juve's big-name stars. Asked if he would settle for a draw, he said: ""We've come to play our game, to attack, play in their half as much as possible, and ultimately to try and win. ""Juventus are a strong side, but we're used to playing against strong sides in Spain and I think we've shown what we're capable of."""
119,01/09/2016,16:55,Nasri ready to put troubles behind him at Sevilla,French midfielder Samir Nasri said Thursday he was ready to turn the page and put last season's woes behind him to rediscover his best level at new club Sevilla.,"Nasri has joined the La Liga side from Manchester City on a season-long loan deal. The 29-year-old scored 27 goals and won two Premier League titles in five years in Manchester, but after an injury-plagued 2015/16 season, new City boss Pep Guardiola had criticised his condition when he returned to pre-season overweight. ""It was a very difficult season in every sense of the word, on the sporting front with injuries and in my private life, for reasons which will remain private,"" said Nasri during his official presentation at the Sanchez Pizjuan stadium. ""My time injured allowed me to rest and reflect... I learned a lot last year,"" he continued, adding his ""obsession"" was now to be ""good on the pitch"" and adopt an ""irreproachable"" behaviour. ""Physically I feel good, I did all the preparation with Manchester City and I even played on the last day,"" said Nasri. The former France international said he had chosen Sevilla over Turkish club Besiktas to work alongside new coach Jorge Sampaoli, adding that Guardiola had wanted to keep him in Manchester. ""Until the last minute he (Guardiola) insisted that I remain but I knew I had to leave to rediscover my best level."""
120,31/08/2016,16:00,Nasri joins Sevilla on season-long loan,"French midfielder Samir Nasri has joined La Liga side Sevilla from Manchester City on a season-long loan deal, both sides confirmed on Wednesday.","Nasri scored 27 goals and won two Premier League titles in five years in Manchester, but after an injury-plagued 2015/16 season, new City boss Pep Guardiola had criticised his condition when he returned to pre-season overweight. ""The attacker arrives on loan from Manchester City until June 30 2017 without an option to buy,"" Sevilla said in a statement. ""@ManCity it's been a pleasure thanks to everyone in the club and the fans for the 5 amazing years and wish you best of luck for the season,"" Nasri posted via his official Twitter account. After making a strong impression as a substitute for the last 15 minutes of City's 3-1 win over West Ham on Sunday, Guardiola even opened the door for Nasri to stay and fight for his place at the Etihad. ""Samir arrived overweight but after seven days, 10 days, it was fantastic how he trained. His quality is on another level,"" said Guardiola. ""It depends on him. If he wants to help us and stay to be part of something, it depends on him."" However, Nasri faced stiff competition from the likes of David Silva, Kevin de Bruyne, Raheem Sterling and new signings Leroy Sane and Gabriel Jesus for a place in Guardiola's new-look side. Instead, the 29-year-old has opted to try and relaunch his career in Spain with Europa League winners Sevilla also offering the lure of Champions League football. Nasri becomes Sevilla's 11th signing of the window with the huge turnover sparked by coach Unai Emery's departure to Paris Saint-German with the notoriously attack-minded Argentine Jorge Sampaoli now in charge at the Sanchez Pizjuan. ""This is the last piece that the coach asked from us,"" said Sevilla sporting director Monchi. ""We have found the player we have been looking for practically since the market opened. ""A player who can play as a false winger and inside, a player with quality, capable of maintaining the ball and generating important possession in the opponent's half."" Sevilla lost in both the Spanish and European Super Cups to Barcelona and Real Madrid respectively, but have started the La Liga season under Sampaoli brightly with four points from their opening two games."

Sirigu, who was PSG's first-choice goalkeeper for four years before losing his place to German Kevin Trapp last season, is expected to sign on a one-year loan in the south of Spain."
122,16/08/2016,01:45,Sevilla face mission improbable in Super Cup,Sevilla have a mountain to climb in the second leg of the Spanish Super Cup on Wednesday if they are to overcome Barcelona.,"Goals from Luis Suarez and Munir El Haddadi earned last year's Liga and Copa del Rey winners a 2-0 victory in Andalusia on Sunday and they have one hand on the trophy. Jorge Sampaoli's men impressed in the first half but struggled to create many clear chances and now find themselves in an extremely tough position going into the return fixture at the Camp Nou. The Argentine coach believes playing against Real Madrid in the UEFA Super Cup last Tuesday harmed his side's chances of victory in this competition. ""We came from 120 minutes against Real Madrid and had several casualties. The calendar has hurt us a bit and we're feeling the weight of fatigue,"" he explained after the defeat. ""Hopefully we will play a more dignified role (in the return leg)."" Sevilla goalkeeper Sergio Rico, who was his side's outstanding player, agreed with his coach. ""We suffered in the second half because we were worn down after the other final,"" Rico said. ""I hope we win the next one. It's home and away, and we will go there with all the hope in the world to put in a good performance and turn things around. All is not lost."" Michael Krohn-Dehli and Benoit Tremoulinas are still out injured, while captain Vicente Iborra should return after being rested. Barcelona, meanwhile, will be without captain Andres Iniesta and defender Jeremy Mathieu, who injured their knee and hamstring respectively during Sunday's clash. New signings Denis Suarez and Lucas Digne were their replacements from the bench on the night and having both impressed are likely to start on Wednesday. With the return just three days after the first match, it would be no surprise to see the coaches shuffle their packs. Neymar is still absent, at the Olympic Games, and Luis Enrique must decide if he will opt for Arda Turan to replace him again, or if Munir is the better option, while Andre Gomes and Samuel Umtiti will be hoping to make their official debuts. ""The players who started played very well and so did those who came on. We're going to need all the players because we will be playing every three days,"" said the coach. ""Some people focus on the trees but I look at the forest. These players have shown over the years how much quality they have. But we are just starting the season and playing for our first trophy so we have to look after them. ""We are all very excited about this chance to win the Spanish Super Cup, it's the first big trophy of the season. And if you want to win titles, you need to be ambitious."" Enrique was impressed by Sevilla's performance at the Ramon Sanchez-Pizjuan, even though the scoreline looked comfortable for his team. ""It might be a good result, but it's not a definitive one,"" he added. ""Every coach tries to implement his own style, and I like Sampaoli's a lot. He wants to win by playing the ball, by controlling it and by playing attacking football."""
123,15/08/2016,03:12,Suarez gives Barcelona edge in Supercup,Luis Suarez insisted the Spanish Super Cup is not Barcelona's yet after helping his team shoot down Sevilla 2-0 to give them a comfortable lead after Sunday's first leg of the final.,"The Uruguayan opened the scoring early in the second half, making amends for two earlier misses, before Munir El Haddadi sealed the win when he ran on to a Lionel Messi through-ball and fired home. Having been beaten 4-0 by Athletic Bilbao in the first leg of last year's final, Barcelona were determined to improve on that showing, setting themselves up nicely for the return at Camp Nou on August 17. ""This is not decided,"" Suarez told Spanish television after the game. ""In the second half we played very well. It's important to win away from home against an opponent as good as Sevilla."" He was not impressed with some of the home supporters who shouted insults at him from the stands at the Ramon Sanchez-Pizjuan. Suarez added: ""They can keep talking, I'm going to do my thing, which is to play football. It's not a problem, we are the protagonists, not them."" Luis Enrique was thrilled with the performance, which puts his team halfway towards the first trophy of the season. ""We continue with the same ambition as always,"" he said in his post-game press conference. ""This team knows how to sacrifice and compete, because we want all the titles and we've ended up with a magnificent result. ""We played a good game, as much defensively as in attack, and in the second half we were able to connect with the forwards and open the scoring. I am very happy with everything."" The coach sprang a surprise with his selection, picking Jeremy Mathieu at left-back and Arda Turan at left-wing in place of the absent Neymar, with all four summer signings left out. Sergi Roberto was also chosen out of position at right-back, ahead of Aleix Vidal. However, by the 35th minute both Lucas Digne and Denis Suarez had to be brought on for their official debuts, with Mathieu and Andres Iniesta injuring their hamstring and knee respectively. Iniesta was making his 594th appearance for Barcelona, taking over from Carles Puyol as the player with the second most appearances for the club, behind Xavi Hernandez, but it was ended prematurely after a fierce challenge by Gabriel Mercado. The first period saw few chances created, although the best of them fell to Luis Suarez in the sixth minute. Sergio Busquets played him in and after spinning masterfully away from the defence his low strike was saved well by goalkeeper Sergio Rico. At the other end Jorge Sampaoli's team worked their way into the game but despite plenty of possession in dangerous areas, they couldn't worry Claudio Bravo. Luis Suarez spurned another good chance at the start of the second half when Rico saved his flicked effort, but it was third time lucky for the Uruguayan. Denis Suarez lofted a neat ball into the area and Turan chested it home for the forward to finish with aplomb. Messi should have doubled the lead moments later, but Rico made a fine stop from his dinked effort, after good work by Turan and Suarez carved the Argentine an opening. Eventually substitute Munir put the game and probably the tie to bed sliding the ball past Rico with the outside of his left boot after Messi fed through an inviting pass. It was evident that neither team were as fit as they would have liked, with Sevilla energy levels falling away in the second half, no doubt as a result of playing 120 minutes in a heartbreaking last gasp 3-2 defeat Real Madrid in the UEFA Super Cup earlier in the week. Now Sampaoli needs to pick them up ahead of the second leg on Wednesday, where a monumental effort will be required if they are to overturn the deficit."
124,09/08/2016,23:45,Last-gasp Real break Sevilla hearts in Supercup,Real Madrid beat Sevilla 3-2 in the European Supercup final in rainy Trondheim on Tuesday thanks to a brilliant individual last minute of extra-time clincher from Dani Carvajal.,"Sevilla had been on the verge of victory leading 2-1 deep into added time, before Sergio Ramos equalised in the 93rd minute with the last kick of normal time, leaving the losers to taste a double dose of pain when Carvajal grabbed the late, late winner. Marco Asensio had given Madrid the lead with a brilliant strike before Franco Vazquez equalised shortly before half-time. Ramos had loked set to be the villain of the piece when he conceded a penalty that Yevhen Konoplyanka's slickly converted in the 72nd-minute, which looked set to win it for Europa League champions Sevilla. The Andalucians could have little to complain about over Carvajal's winner, as he flew into the box and clipped the ball past two defenders and the 'keeper with a lovely flick from the outside of his right boot. ""The goal came from trying and trying again. Dani Carvajal's strike was spectacular, he deserves it more than anyone,"" Madrid's Lucas Vazquez said told UEFA after the game. ""Sergio Ramos is the first to never give up and he is always there in important moments. It is brilliant to have him. We have got a lot of depth and a side to take on all comers."" Zinedine Zidane's Madrid were not at full strength, with neither Cristiano Ronaldo nor Gareth Bale, nor Toni Kroos, involved and both Luka Modric and Karim Benzema coming off the bench in the second half at the Lerkendal Stadion. ""We were trailing for all of the second half, but Madrid never give up and a goal in 90 minutes allowed us to become champions,"" Carvajal told UEFA after the game. ""Today we had a lot of players missing but we have a great squad of homegrown players."" Having just sold Jese Rodriguez to Paris Saint-Germain, Madrid started with Alvaro Morata in attack, back at the club from Juventus. The 20-year-old Spain international Asensio, back from loan at Espanyol, was also included from the off and he put Real ahead midway through the first half with a tremendous left-foot strike that swerved into the top-left corner from 25 yards. However, Sevilla responded well and Daniel Carrico forced a good save from Casilla -- standing in for Keylor Navas -- before the equaliser arrived. Vitolo controlled a Luciano Vietto cross, and while he could not get the shot away, Vazquez did, sticking out his left boot to volley low into the bottom-right corner. Argentine playmaker Vazquez was signed from Palermo during a close season of much change at Sevilla, who lost coach Unai Emery -- the mastermind of their three consecutive Europa League triumphs -- to PSG. Grzegorz Krychowiak, Ever Banega and Kevin Gameiro have all moved on to PSG, Inter Milan and Atletico Madrid respectively, while captain Coke has signed for Schalke. Vazquez was one of three new faces to start for Sevilla, the others being Japanese international Hiroshi Kiyotake and Vietto, brought in from Atletico. After an Isco effort was deflected narrowly wide early in the second half, Vietto made way for Konoplyanka and he scored from 12 yards to put Sevilla in front after Ramos had penalised for bringing down Vitolo in the box. That looked set to be the winner until Ramos appeared unmarked six yards out in the third minute of added time to head home a Lucas Vazquez cross with goalkeeper Sergio Rico, blocked by one of his team-mates, unable to get across to block."

Gameiro enjoyed the most prolific season of his career last term, scoring 29 goals in all competitions, including 10 in Europe, but missed out on selection for Dider Deschamps' France Euro 2016 squad. Atletico coach Diego Simeone had been looking to strengthen his forward line, as Griezmann and Fernando Torres have been sharing the bulk of the striking duties. Argentinian Simeone had also added former Benfica winger Nicolas Gaitan and Croatian defender Sime Vrsaljko to his squad this summer. Atletico will be hoping to push on in the coming season, after narrowly missing out on both the Champions League and La Liga titles last campaign.

A small numbers of supporters clashed behind one of the goals shortly before kick-off, with fans blaming poor segregation for the problems.

However, the Spanish international was left flat-footed when Alba latched onto Messi's ball over the top six minutes into extra-time and volleyed across goal into the far corner. Rico kept Sevilla in the game with brilliant saves from Pique and Sergio Busquets, whilst Dani Alves also hit the post from distance as Barca threatened a second. Sevilla's hopes of an equaliser were ended when Daniel Carrico was also sent-off for a second bookable offence. And Messi promptly teed up Neymar to round off Barca's fourth Cup triumph in eight years in stoppage time."
133,21/05/2016,16:06,"Season comes full circle as Barca, Sevilla seek doubles","Newly-crowned Spanish champions Barcelona face Sevilla, fresh from winning their third consecutive Europa League, as both seek more glory in the Spanish Cup final on Sunday.","Another successful campaign for both sides will end as it began after Barca edged Sevilla 5-4 after extra-time in a thrilling season-opening European Super Cup final. Indeed, Barca could end the season with four trophies in total having also claimed the Club World Cup in December. Barca captain Andres Iniesta laughed off suggestions that a La Liga and Cup double is the minimum requirement for the Catalan giants to ease the pain of their Champions League exit to Atletico Madrid at the quarter-final stage last month. However, the Spanish international did admit Barca's success of winning six La Liga titles and three Copas del Rey in the past eight years has provoked a relentless demand for more trophies. ""When you win a league it's impossible for it to be a bad season. It will always be a good season,"" Iniesta said on Saturday. ""This team always has the obligation to win in a final. We fight for all the titles each season, sometimes we win and other times we don't, but the obligation to win is permanent. ""It is like that in every game we play, so imagine what it is like in a final. ""The club doesn't allow errors, dips or not winning things and this will not change."" Sevilla appear to have the significant disadvantage of having beaten Liverpool in the Europa League final just five days before facing Barca at Atletico Madrid's Vicente Calderon. By contrast, Luis Enrique's men have had a free week since Luis Suarez's hat-trick in a 3-0 win at Granada retained their league title. Enrique insisted he expects to win, but warned that Sevilla's experience in finals could pose Barca problems. ""I am an optimist, I think we are going to win,"" he said. ""Sevilla have brilliantly won again the Europa League final and they have the chance to do the double too which is very important for a team like Sevilla. ""They keep winning titles. With us they are one of the teams most used to playing finals and that will make tomorrow a very attractive match."" The action off the field has been dominated by a political row in the build up as Catalan separatist flags were initially banned from the stadium by the Spanish government before Barca successfully appealed that decision through the courts. ""Very few things surprise me in this country,"" said Enrique. ""In the end the logical thing has happened and the freedom of expression for everyone has been respected."" All three previous meetings between the sides this season have been settled by one goal as Sevilla won 2-1 at home in October in La Liga before Barca claimed victory by the same scoreline at the Camp Nou in February. ""We have their respect because we have earned it when we've faced them,"" said Sevilla coach Unai Emery. And Emery is keen to pile the pressure on Barca as favourites despite Sevilla's fantastic cup record in the three years since he took charge. ""They need this title because Barcelona feed off winning titles, but our strength is our desire,"" he added. ""These moments come around very rarely for us. How many times have Barca won the Cup? Loads. We haven't, but for us to play in tomorrow's final is a gift that we will happily unwrap."" Barca are expected to name an unchanged team from the side that started at Granada with Enrique afforded the luxury of choosing from a squad free of injuries and suspensions. Sevilla are without the suspended Steven N'Zonzi and Timothee Kolodziejczak, whilst Benoit Tremoulinas and Michael Krohn-Dehli remain sidelined by injury. However, Spanish international goalkeeper Sergio Rico and captain Jose Antonio Reyes could return after missing out against Liverpool in midweek."
134,20/05/2016,19:43,Spanish judge allows Catalan flags at Madrid cup final,A Spanish judge on Friday overturned a controversial ban on Barcelona fans flying Catalan flags at Sunday's Copa del Rey final against Sevilla in Madrid.,"The Madrid authorities had told Barcelona on Wednesday that the Estelada independence flags could not be flown at the Vicente Calderon stadium, the home of Atletico Madrid because they contravened a 2007 law. That legislation allowed for a ban on flags and symbols that are deemed to ""incite violence"" or ""show contempt for participants in a sporting event"". But the judge on Friday ruled that ""in no case had it been proven"" that the exhibition of the flags could ""incite violence, racism, xenophobia or any other form of discrimination that is an affront to human dignity"". Barcelona said they welcomed the judicial decision to allow the display of Estelada flags. ""The club celebrates that the judge's decision will allow the free expression of legal symbols and banners by its members and supporters,"" the Spanish champions said in a statement. ""At the same time, FC Barcelona expresses its concern about the reoccurrence of situations like the one on Wednesday, and which are an affront to the freedom of expression, and do nothing to benefit what has always been a celebration of football and sport. ""The club reiterates its commitment to the defence of the freedom of expression among its members and supporters."""
135,19/05/2016,13:29,Sevilla steamroller highlights Spain's weight in Europe,Sevilla's rout of Liverpool in the Europa League final is a new sign of which country rules the continent's football and a powerful warning to Barcelona ahead of their kings of Spain clash.,"Coke's double in the 3-1 win in Basel highlighted the value of the Spanish system of turning home talent into title winners. And Sevilla's record five titles in the UEFA Cup and Europa League have shown them to be masters of the art. Real and Atletico Madrid will dispute the Champions League next week in a showdown that highlights how Spanish clubs can also buy world class talent successfully to dominate European football. The Europa League ""belongs"" to Sevilla, AS sports daily wrote Thursday after the stunning second half comeback spurred the triumph. Losing 1-0 at half-time, Coke's double and a third from Kevin Gameiro saw Sevilla to a win that left Liverpool on their knees. ""The Andalusian team steamrollered the English in an unforgettable second half,"" said Mundo Deportivo. The win again left English Premier League clubs wondering how to turn their wealth into European success. AS editor Alfredo Relano said that Sevilla have a ""magnificent structure with a model sporting system and an extraordinary business plan, buying well and selling even better"". Spanish clubs have bought and nurtured outstanding talent from Portugal, South America and other smaller football nations. But they have a core of players that have come through their own academies. Sevilla bought their match-winner Coke for a reported 2.5 million euros from Rayo Vallecano in 2011. They developed Brazilian right back Dani Alves from the youth ranks and sold him to Barcelona for more than 28 million euros. Alves left in tears saying he would like to play with Sevilla again some day. Ivan Rakitic, Aleix Vidal and Seydou Keita have also been sold on by Sevilla to Barcelona at a big premium. With Barcelona and Real Madrid leading the Spanish pack on the international stage, clubs like Atletico, Sevilla and Villareal have a huge incentive to up their game to survive. Coaches also have a far wider variety of styles that goes far past the 'tiki-taka' short passing style that has brought Barcelona success. Diego Simeone's Atletico Madrid have a rock-solid defensive structure that has stifled Europe's best. Real Madrid, Sevilla and Villarreal are all deadly on the counter-attack. ""Football in Spain is a very technical game. The best football is here,"" said Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini, whose side was dumped out of the Champions League semi-finals by Real Madrid. ""Spanish teams work very well at the academy level,"" Spain coach Vicente del Bosque told AFP in a recent interview. ""From there, with the improvement of coaching too, it has improved the standard at club and international level."" Now Sevilla are a Europa legend and their win means that Spain has secured the Europa League-Champions League double two years in a row. Atletico play Real in Milan on May 28 for the Champions League title -- their second clash in the final in three years. Sevilla can add to their history if they overcome Barcelona in the Kings Cup final on Sunday. The Sport newspaper said Thursday that Sevilla's comeback from a ""torrid"" first half meant that ""Barcelona have been warned."" But win or lose, Spanish clubs have scored another key win over their English rivals. ""Liverpool may be legendary, but Sevilla are eternal,"" declared Sport."
136,19/05/2016,02:30,"Reds fall to better technique, says Sevilla defender","Superior technique honed by playing in the ""best league in the world"" was key to Sevilla's record-setting Europa League triumph over Liverpool on Wednesday, said the club's French central defender Timothee Kolodziejczak.","Five-time European champions Liverpool travelled to St Jakob-Park in Basel confident of a first Europa League trophy since 2001. But Jurgen Klopp's men failed to build on Daniel Sturridge's superb 35th-minute opener When Kevin Gameiro caught Liverpool napping to equalise seconds after half-time, it opened the floodgates with Spanish midfielder Coke scoring twice in six minutes to give Unai Emery's men a 3-1 lead by the 70th minute. Coke looked offside for his second goal, when Ever Banega's pass came off a Liverpool player. But after angry scenes that saw Klopp sprint down the touchline to confront the linesman, Swedish referee Jonas Eriksson pointed to the centre circle after consulting with his official. Sevilla's fifth Europa League trophy since 2006 means they earn automatic entry to next season's Champions League. Liverpool, who also lost in this season's English League Cup final to Manchester City, walk away with nothing. Klopp -- in his first season in charge at Anfield -- has now collected a fifth consecutive loser's medal from his past five Cup finals. The German said he will use Liverpool's absence from Europe next season to improve his young squad ahead of a fresh assault, but for Kolodziejczak, Spanish clubs already have an advantage over their richer English counterparts. Asked why Liverpool failed to muster a response in the second half, he told AFP: ""We started the second half with a lot more desire. And we knew that, technically, we were better than them, although we also stepped up our game physically."" Klopp looked to have made the correct choice when he left Jordan Henderson and Divock Origi on the bench as both have only recently recovered from injury. Sturridge stepped in for Origi and after spurning two half-chances, he beat David Soria with a delightful shot with the outside of his left boot for Liverpool's opener on 35 minutes. It sent St. Jakob-Park into raptures, although the massive army of Reds supporters -- some of whom got into scuffles with Sevilla fans inside the stadium prior to kick-off -- were conspicuously quiet after the interval. Sevilla had got off lightly when Liverpool twice saw penalty appeals waved away - defender Daniel Carrico handling twice in the area - but the Spaniards were a different team after the interval. Gameiro had come close with a speculative overhead kick in the opening half and he made no mistake with an easy tap-in after right-back Mariano Ferreiro pounced on a poor clearance from Liverpool left-back Alberto Moreno seconds after the restart to power unchallenged down the right. It brought an expletive-tainted reaction on Twitter from retired Liverpool great Jamie Carragher, who said: ""Jurgen, transfer committee, anyone sign a f*****g left-back."" The unwelcome irony for Reds fans is that Liverpool signed Moreno from Sevilla in 2014 for 12 million pounds (euros). Klopp admitted: ""Their first goal was a big influence on our game. We lost faith in our style of play, we lost our formation, (we were) not compact any more, but we've had this problem before."" Kolodziejczak said the leveller changed their whole outlook. ""It gave us a huge boost and helped us to relax. And when we get relaxed, we can beat anyone,"" he added. ""But we knew between ourselves that we were technically and tactically superior."" Liverpool's confidence sunk and when Banega dribbled through an inefficient Reds defence, Coke pounced to ram the ball past goalkeeper Simon Mignolet from 20 yards. It took several minutes for officials to finally decide whether Coke's second was valid, but it will take Liverpool's fans much longer to get over what was a poor second half display. Despite his comments, Kolodziejczak has not ruled out a move to England. ""Everyone dreams about playing there. Maybe sometime in the future career,"" he added. ""I've never played in England, but it's only Spanish teams winning the European Cups now. ""The Spanish League is the best in the world."""
137,18/05/2016,22:53,Coke breaks Liverpool hearts in Europa League triumph,Sevilla midfielder Coke broke Liverpool hearts with a second-half brace in a controversy-filled 3-1 victory that secured a record third consecutive Europa League title on Wednesday.,"Liverpool travelled to St Jakob-Park confident in their chances of a first Europa League trophy since 2001 after an impressive campaign in Europe's second tier competition. But Jurgen Klopp's men failed to build on Daniel Sturridge's superb 35th minute opener, and when Kevin Gameiro found Liverpool asleep to level seconds after the restart, it opened the floodgates. Liverpool's heads went down and, as they began to sit back, Coke struck in six second-half minutes to give Unai Emery's men a 3-1 lead by the 70th minute. Coke looked offside, but after angry scenes that saw Klopp sprint down the touchline to confront the linesman, Swedish referee Jonas Eriksson pointed to the centre circle after consulting with his official. An emotional Klopp, losing his fifth consecutive final, admitted Gameiro's leveller had taken the wind out of Liverpool's sails -- although the German hopes defeat will serve as a lesson in the long run. ""Their first goal was a big influence on our game. We lost faith in our style of play, we lost our formation, (we were) not compact any more, but we've had this problem before,"" said Klopp. With victory rewarding the winners with a place in next season's Champions League, and the losers nothing, Klopp added: ""We are disappointed, we are frustrated. ""Now it's clear, we're not in an international tournament next year. It means we have time to train, to work harder. ""The boys showed what they are capable of, many of them are still young and this was the first big final, and we will use this experience together. ""Some day everybody will say defeat to Sevilla was the turning point in the success of Liverpool FC."" Emery had demanded a last push from some of the experienced players who had helped the Spaniards to four Europa League crowns since 2006, and they came good in a stunning second half. Yet Klopp looked to have made the correct choice when he left Jordan Henderson and Divock Origi on the bench as both recently recovered from respective injuries. Sturridge stepped in for Origi to play in front of Coutinho, Roberto Firmino and Adam Lallana and spurned two half-chances before beating David Soria with a delightful shot with the outside of his left boot on 35 minutes. It sent St. Jakob-Park into raptures, although the massive army of Reds supporters -- some of whom got into scuffles with Sevilla fans inside the stadium prior to kick-off -- were conspicuously quiet after the interval. Sevilla had got off lightly when Liverpool twice saw penalty appeals waved away - defender Daniel Carrico handling twice in the area - while Dejan Lovren saw his header from Sturridge's corner ruled offside. UEFA made history by using Hawk-Eye goalline technology in a Europa League final for the first time, but the organisers could have done with it around the penalty area as well. ""Everybody told me about the two handballs in the first half,"" added Klopp. Sevilla were kept on a tight rein in the opening half although Gameiro, with 28 goals this season including seven in eight Europa League games, had his first sniff with an ambitious overhead kick after Coke's cross on the right following a corner. But Liverpool were beginning to fire, and when Coutinho found Sturridge unmarked to his left the England striker coolly beat Soria at his far post. Neither Firmino nor Sturridge could get to the ball when Lallana released Nathaniel Clyne down the right for the right-back to deliver an inviting ball across the face of goal just before half-time. It would prove costly, because whatever Emery said at half-time worked wonders. When right-back Mariano Ferreiro pounced on a poor clearance from Alberto Moreno seconds after the restart, the Sevilla right-back was allowed to power unchallenged down the right to deliver for Gameiro, who tapped home from yards out. Liverpool's confidence sunk and Coke got his first after a great combination with Banega, who dribbled through the Reds defence before seeing Coke ram the ball past Mignolet from 20 yards. It took several minutes for officials to finally decide whether Coke's second was valid, but it will take Liverpool's fans much longer to get over what was a poor second half display."
138,17/05/2016,21:01,Klopp confident ahead of Europa League final,Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp is confident the Reds can end a difficult season on a high note and claim their first European trophy in 11 years by beating Sevilla in the Europa League final on Wednesday.,"Sevilla arrive in the Swiss city of Basel aiming for a hat-trick of victories in the competition. They are also looking to win the trophy for the fifth time in 11 seasons, having also successfully defended their 2006 title in 2007. Liverpool were struggling before Klopp's arrival earlier in the campaign, but he insisted his faith in the players' abilities was there even before he joined the club. ""I came here because I was really convinced about the qualities of these players and this squad, despite the doubts people had,"" he said. ""When I came here there was a big amount of doubt about these players and now I am really happy they can show how strong they are. ""It is a big opportunity to make the final step this season and achieve something."" Klopp owns a loser's medal from the Champions League final in 2013 when his Borussia Dortmund side lost to Bayern Munich and his Dortmund side also lost the German Cup final in 2014 and 2015. After collecting another runners-up medal in February when Liverpool lost the League Cup on penalties to Manchester City, the German admitted he has ""a little too many silver medals"" at home. Liverpool captain Jordan Henderson could play a part at St Jakob-Park after returning from a knee ligament problem at West Bromwich Albion on Sunday, while Divock Origi, preferred to Daniel Sturridge up front in the Europa League, is waiting on the sidelines. He came through training unscathed on Monday following a recent ankle knock and Klopp said: ""We will see after training with Divock, we will see how he feels and then we will make a decision."" With a chance to make Europa League history -- no team has claimed three consecutive titles -- Sevilla are not lacking in belief themselves and Liverpool midfielder Emre Can admitted: ""Sevilla know how to play in the Europa League."" Frenchman Kevin Gameiro, Sevilla's top scorer this season with 28 goals, has managed seven in just eight Europa League outings. But coach Unai Emery is looking for all his players to step up: ""We can change history and have our names written in the competition's history books. ""All my players have special characteristics and we need the best of them against Liverpool; we need everything they have. ""We must find a balance, though, to keep our emotions in check so we can be fully focused. We'll need it."" Sevilla might be chasing history, but they are fully aware of Liverpool's former glories and Emery added: ""Liverpool are among the best 10 teams in the world. They have a great history - they have won the European Cup five times, the UEFA Cup, English league titles. ""The team have changed under the new coach, they are a happy team. They're like Athletic Bilbao the way they press and give 100 percent."" Liverpool are chasing a first European trophy since a stunning comeback to beat AC Milan in the final of the 2005 Champions League. Memories of that night in Istanbul remain fresh, and Klopp added: ""The longer you don't win anything, the harder you try. ""We already know about the desire of our supporters. We know how much they want to win this cup. ""We have a big chance and winning tomorrow will make it much more easy for you to see it as a success -- and I try to help."""

Already holding the cushion of two away goals from the first leg last week, Gameiro gave Sevilla the perfect start when he fired into the far corner after just nine minutes. Former Arsenal striker Eduardo briefly gave the Ukrainians hope when he levelled on the night with a calm finish a minute before half-time. However, Sevilla quickly reasserted their stranglehold on the tie with a fine team goal finished off by Gameiro two minutes into the second-half for his 28th goal of the season. Brazilian right-back Mariano handed Sevilla a two-goal advantage they never looked like relinquishing when he smashed home a stunning third just before the hour mark from outside the box."

""The player has been operated on...for a displaced fracture of the left kneecap. The operation was performed without incident,"" Sevilla said in a statement. The club added Krohn-Dehli, who joined Sevilla from Celta Vigo last July, would miss ""between seven and eight months"" depending on his recovery, meaning the 32-year-old may not return to action until 2017. Sevilla host Shakhtar in the return leg next Thursday as the Spaniards chase a third successive Europa League title. Unai Emery's side are also through to the Copa del Rey final against Barcelona on May 22."
141,28/04/2016,23:09,Gameiro penalty gives Sevilla edge against Shakhtar,Holders Sevilla remain on course to reach yet another Europa League final after escaping from Ukraine with a 2-2 draw against Shakhtar Donetsk in their semi-final first leg on Thursday.,"Marlos and Taras Stepanenko scored for Shakhtar after Vitolo had given Sevilla an early lead, but Kevin Gameiro's 82nd-minute penalty ensured the holders have the upper hand ahead of the return in Spain next week. Unai Emery's side, who defeated Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk of Ukraine in the final last season, are bidding to win the trophy for a third year running and they got off to a dream start in Lviv. The game was just six minutes old when Ever Banega and Gameiro combined to set up Vitolo, who left Yaroslav Rakitskiy on the ground and fired low through Andriy Pyatov and in. That silenced the crowd at the Arena Lviv in western Ukraine, where 2009 UEFA Cup winners Shakhtar have set up home due to the conflict in the east of the country. However, Pyatov was a virtual spectator for the rest of the first half as Mircea Lucescu's men roared back to turn the game on its head. First a Rakitskiy pass midway through the opening period cut open the Sevilla defence and the Brazilian Marlos controlled before finishing low into the net with the side of his left foot. Then Shakhtar went in front on 36 minutes, Stepanenko meeting a magnificent Marlos cross from the left with a thumping header at the near post. Sevilla, who like Shakhtar were eliminated from this season's Champions League in the group stage, were dealt a blow 20 minutes from the end when substitute Michael Krohn-Dehli was stretchered off with an apparently serious knee injury. Despite that they pressed in search of an equaliser and a precious second away goal, but Gameiro had one effort disallowed, blazed another shot over and was then denied by a miraculous Olexandr Kucher clearance off the line. The French striker did strike with eight minutes left, though, scoring from the spot after Facundo Ferreyra was adjudged to have fouled Vitolo in the box."
142,15/04/2016,12:56,"Liverpool-Villarreal, Shakhtar-Sevilla in Europa League semis",Jurgen Klopp's Liverpool earned a Europa League semi-final against Villarreal from their heroic comeback against his former side Borussia Dortmund.,"Defending champions Sevilla face Ukraine's Shakhtar Donetsk in the second semi-final drawn Friday. Liverpool, who hit back from 2-0 and 3-1 down to beat Borussia 4-3 and progress into the semis 5-4 on aggregate, have never played Villarreal before. Sevilla ousted fellow Spaniards Athletic Bilbao on penalties in Thursday's quarter-final in their bid to win a third consecutive Europa League. The final is set for Basel, Switzerland, on May 18. The winners will get a place in next season's Champions League group stages. Liverpool are the only unbeaten side left in the competition, and goals from centre-backs Mamadou Sakho and Dejan Lovren completed one of the great Anfield comebacks against Dortmund. The first leg will be played in Villareal on April 28, with The Yellow Submarine heading to Merseyside for the return leg on May 5. The Spanish outfit, currently fourth in La Liga, are looking to reach their maiden major European final, after Europa League last-four defeats in 2004 and 2011 and a Champions League semi-final loss in 2006. In stark contrast, Liverpool are attempting to win their ninth major continental trophy, and in the process, draw level with Sevilla as the competition's record four-time winners. Sevilla's quartet of titles have all come in the last decade, with victory against Espanyol in 2007 making them just the second club after Real Madrid to win the competition in successive years. They backed that performance up by repeating the feat 11 months ago against Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk, and now they have another Ukrainian outfit in Shakhtar standing in their way. The first leg will be played in Seville, before 2009 champions Shakhtar host the second game in Lviv. The country's civil war has forced them to play away from their home city."
143,14/04/2016,23:58,Sevilla's treble hopes alive after shoot-out win,Sevilla maintained their quest to win a third straight Europa League crown by ousting fellow Spaniards Athletic Bilbao on penalties on Thursday.,"Sevilla joined Liverpool, Shakhtar Donetsk and fellow La Liga outfit Villarreal in the semi-finals despite losing 2-1 at home. That made it a 3-3 tie on aggregate and after extra-time provided no more goals, the game went to penalties. Frenchman Kevin Gameiro scored the decisive spot-kick after Benat had his kick for Athletic saved by goalkeeper David Soria. Gameiro had also scored in normal time either side of strikes from Aritz Aduriz and Raul Garcia for Athletic. The tie of the round came in England where Liverpool hit back from 2-0 and 3-1 down to beat Borussia Dortmund 4-3 and progress 5-4 on aggregate. Playing against his former side, Jurgen Klopp's team trailed to goals from Henrikh Mkhitaryan and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang. Divock Origi pulled a goal back before Marco Reus restored the Germans' two-goal advantage. Liverpool needed three goals to progress due to the away goals rule and Dejan Lovren pounced to head home the injury-time winner after Philippe Coutinho and Mamadou Sakho had drawn the hosts level on the night. Villarreal striker Cedric Bakambu continued his sublime form with two more goals in a 4-2 win over Sparta Prague in the Czech Republic to complete a 6-3 aggregate victory. Shakhtar, the 2009 UEFA Cup champions, also powered into the last four with a 4-0 thrashing of Braga in Lviv. Darijo Srna converted a first-half penalty before Ricardo Ferreira twice put through his own net either side of a Viktor Kovalenko strike as the Ukrainians strolled through 6-1 on aggregate."
144,07/04/2016,23:23,"Klopp's Liverpool hold Dortmund, champions Sevilla win",Liverpool claimed an excellent 1-1 draw with Borussia Dortmund in the first leg of their Europa League quarter-final on Thursday as Jurgen Klopp made an emotional return to the Westfalenstadion.,"The game marked Klopp's first coming together with his former club since his departure last summer and subsequent appointment by Liverpool back in October. He saw Divock Origi put the Premier League side in front in the 36th minute before Mats Hummels equalised for the hosts three minutes into the second half. However, that away goal means Liverpool have the upper hand ahead of next Thursday's second leg at Anfield and Klopp will be confident his side can progress to the last four after an encouraging display in Germany. ""Dortmund's a pretty good side. Everybody could see that but we had our moments and we could have won the game,"" Klopp told BT Sport. A rousing rendition of 'You'll Never Walk Alone' -- the Liverpool hymn that is also a Dortmund anthem -- preceded kick-off as Klopp took in the scene at the stadium where he is still idolised after a highly successful seven years as coach. ""It was respectful, nice and how it should be,"" Klopp said of his welcome. But perhaps the emotion of the occasion got to the Bundesliga team because they were unable to repeat their superb performance in tearing Tottenham Hotspur apart in the last round. Their 36-goal leading scorer Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang was subdued and they were denied an opener when Mamadou Sakho bravely blocked a Henrikh Mkhitaryan shot. Dejan Lovren should have done better than head straight at Roman Weidenfeller at the other end but Origi put the visitors in front when he held off his marker and slotted low past the 'keeper after latching onto a Jordan Henderson flick. Weidenfeller prevented Origi from scoring again just before the interval and Dortmund drew level shortly after the restart, captain Hummels rising above Adam Lallana to head in a Mkhitaryan cross. Weidenfeller saved well from Philippe Coutinho and the final scoreline means the tie remains up for grabs, even if Liverpool have the edge. Meanwhile, holders Sevilla remain on course to win the trophy for the third season running after coming from behind to win 2-1 away to Spanish rivals Athletic Bilbao in the first leg of their tie. Sevilla have not won away from home all season in La Liga and, after a goalless first half in which Aritz Aduriz hit the post for the hosts, they went behind in the 48th minute. Iker Muniain crossed and the evergreen Aduriz headed in his 32nd goal of a remarkable campaign. But as the rain lashed down in the Basque Country, Sevilla silenced San Mames when Ever Banega pounced on a short headed back-pass by Muniain and set up Timothee Kolodziejczak to score. Kevin Gameiro then set up substitute Vicente Iborra to give Sevilla the win seven minutes from time and leave beaten 2012 finalists Athletic up against it ahead of the return leg. One Spanish side is guaranteed to make the last four and Villarreal hope to be there too after beating Sparta Prague of the Czech Republic 2-1 at El Madrigal. Cedric Bakambu got both goals for the hosts, charging down a clearance by goalkeeper David Bicik for the early opener and then scoring the winner in the second half after Jakub Brabec had headed Sparta's equaliser. Meanwhile Ukraine's Shakhtar Donetsk, the 2009 UEFA Cup winners, are in the driving seat in their tie against Braga after a 2-1 victory in Portugal. Yaroslav Rakitskiy fired Shakhtar ahead on the stroke of half-time and Facundo Ferreyra increased their lead before Wilson Eduardo grabbed a potentially vital goal for 2011 runners-up Braga late on."
145,28/02/2016,22:38,Barca equal unbeaten record in Sevilla win,Barcelona came from behind to equal a Spanish record of 34 games unbeaten in all competitions by moving eight points clear at the top of La Liga with a 2-1 win over Sevilla.,"Sevilla were the last side to beat Barca back in October and deservedly struck first through Vitolo. However, as so often of late, Barca recovered from a slow start thanks to Lionel Messi's brilliant free-kick and Gerard Pique's winner early in the second-half. Luis Enrique's men have now matched Real Madrid's record run from the 1988-89 season and in doing so moved 12 points clear of third-placed Madrid. Atletico Madrid remain Barca's closest challengers after beating Madrid 1-0 on Saturday. ""We are in great form, but records don't mean anything. At the end of the day everything is judged by titles,"" Pique told Movistar+. ""Our season is well on track, but we need to finish it off."" Sevilla were a constant threat on the counter-attack, but should have taken the lead from a set-piece when Timothee Kolodziejczak somehow blazed over from point-blank range. Barca nearly went in front in spectacular fashion as Messi's audacious attempt from a corner hit the post and Luis Suarez then blasted the rebound off the crossbar. Sevilla did eventually make the breakthrough 20 minutes in thanks to a fine breakaway as Benoit Tremoulinas's cross from the left was slotted home at the back post by Vitolo. However, as ever Messi came to the fore when Barca needed him most and the five-time World Player of the Year levelled with a stunning free-kick high into the far corner 11 minutes later. Sergio Rico prevented Messi turning the game around single-handedly before the break with a great save low to his left. Barca upped the pace after the break and were rewarded when brilliant link-up play between Messi and Suarez teed up Pique to tap home from close range. Sevilla still had the chance to take something from the game when Claudio Bravo flew from his line to block Kevin Gameiro as the Frenchman bore down on goal. Earlier, Valencia's four-game winning run came to a sudden halt as Gary Neville's men were beaten 3-0 by Athletic Bilbao in a dress rehearsal of their Europa League last-16 tie. The Basques moved up to seventh in La Liga with three goals in seven second-half minutes at Mestalla. However, Neville was furious at two strong Valencia penalty appeals that were waived away before the opener. ""I thought the referee was a joke,"" said the former Manchester United captain. ""I've not blamed refs in every game, but his management of the game was awful. Some of the things he did were incredible."" Sabin Merino headed the visitors in front before Iker Muniain then doubled the lead to register his first goal in 18 months. And Aritz Aduriz compounded a miserable afternoon for Neville by rising highest to head home Benat Extebarria's corner for his 27th goal of the season. Villarreal moved to within two points of Real Madrid by stretching their unbeaten league run to 13 games with a comfortable 3-0 win over Levante thanks to goals from Leo Baptistao, Samu Castillejo and Adrian Lopez. Marcelino's men should at least be assured a place in the Champions League qualifiers next season as they now lead Sevilla by 11 points in the fight for fourth place."
146,26/02/2016,02:15,Derby win a must for Ronaldo in Barca chase,Cristiano Ronaldo insists Real Madrid can still catch La Liga leaders Barcelona if they can overcome their hoodoo against local rivals Atletico Madrid on Saturday.,"Real trail Atletico by a point and are nine adrift of Barca with just 13 games remaining, but can move up to second place should they beat Diego Simeone's men for the first time in six league games. ""It is a game we need to win,"" Ronaldo told Madrid's website. ""It is an important game at home, in front of our fans and against a very strong team that defends well. ""We know that (winning) La Liga will be difficult, but we need to fight until the end. Football is box full of surprises and anything can happen."" Real are expected to once again be without Gareth Bale as the calf injury that was initially expected to keep the Welsh star out for three weeks in mid-January drags on. Karim Benzema is likely to return having missed the 1-1 draw at Malaga last weekend, whilst James Rodriguez could start after being left on the bench by Zinedine Zidane at La Rosaleda. Zidane's record at the Bernabeu since taking over has been impeccable with four wins and 20 goals from four games. However, Atletico's rock-solid defence will pose a much more difficult obstacle to break down. Simeone's men recorded their 24th clean sheet in 38 games this season in a 0-0 draw at PSV Eindhoven in the Champions League in midweek. However, goals at the other end of the field has been the major problem for Atletico with just one in their last three games. ""The goal will come. We need to keep going and, if we have to be patient, I'll be the first to wait,"" said Simeone. Stefan Savic misses out through injury, so Jose Maria Gimenez will come into the Atletico defence. Meanwhile, Fernando Torres is likely to earn a recall to the starting line-up unless Yannick Carrasco recovers in time from an ankle ligament injury. Barca can maintain their stranglehold on the title race when Sevilla visit the Camp Nou on Sunday. The Andalusians' charge for a top-four finish has been maintained by their brilliant home form as they still haven't won away in the league all season. That run seems highly unlikely to chance as Barca seek to extend a 33-game unbeaten run in all competitions. However, the last time the European champions tasted defeat it was to Sevilla in October. ""Stats are there to be broken,"" said Barca's top scorer Luis Suarez. ""We are dedicated to playing well and getting good results."" With three La Liga games to come in seven days, Barca boss Luis Enrique is likely to rotate with the likes of Arda Turan and Sergi Roberto in line to start. Similarly with Sevilla aiming to catch Villarreal, who they trail by eight points, in fourth, coach Unai Emery may prioritise more winnable clashes with Eibar and Getafe in the next week. However, Villarreal are strong favourites to stretch their commanding lead over the Europa League holders to 11 points when they host Levante on Sunday. Gary Neville's upturn in fortunes as Valencia boss continued with a 4-0 win over Rapid Vienna on Thursday to seal a remarkable 10-0 aggregate win and a fourth consecutive victory in all competitions. With fears of being dragged into a relegation battle eased, Valencia could even challenge for a Europa League place should they continue their momentum at home to Athletic Bilbao on Sunday.

However, in the driving Galician rain, Celta did make Sevilla fret as they went 2-0 up on the night thanks to a brace either side of half-time by Iago Aspas. But Ever Banega quickly pulled one back for Sevilla and Swedish striker John Guidetti struck the post with a penalty for Celta after he had been brought down in the box by goalkeeper Sergio Rico. Sevilla then equalised on the night when Vitolo set up Yevhen Konoplyanka for an easy finish late on. Sevilla and Barcelona, who met in the final of the UEFA Super Cup in Tbilisi at the start of the campaign with Barca winning 5-4 in extra time, will now clash again in the final of the Copa del Rey, with the game scheduled for May 21 at an as yet undecided venue. Barcelona are the holders while Sevilla last lifted the trophy in 2010, when they defeated Atletico Madrid 2-0 in the final at the Camp Nou."

Meanwhile, defeat for Juventus means they could face the likes of Bayern Munich, Barcelona or Real Madrid in the last 16 as they slipped to second in the group. Last season's beaten finalists were left to rue a series of missed chances as they suffered a first defeat in eight games. Sevilla goalkeeper Sergio Rico was alive early on to claw away Stefano Sturaro's header. However, at the other end Gianluigi Buffon showed his reflexes haven't waned with age as he made a fine double save from Llorente and Yevhen Konoplyanka. Juventus's Spanish international Alvaro Morata then missed the first of a number of chances on a night to forget on his return to Spain as he prodded wide from Paulo Dybala's knockdown. And Rico stood tall again to turn Dybala's free-kick to safety just before half-time. Sevilla started stronger after the break and were rewarded 25 minutes from time when Llorente flicked Konoplyanka's cross into the far corner for just his fourth goal since leaving Juventus in August. The hosts then had to withstand a Juventus onslaught in the final 10 minutes as Dybala hit the crossbar, whilst Rico produced another brilliant save from Paul Pogba. The visitors had one final chance in stoppage time, but Morata again failed to hit the target as their chances of avoiding Europe's elite in Monday's draw for the knockout stages slipped away."

""For us the game tomorrow is a final. We need to be aware of what we have in play in the Europa League, where we want to play an important role again,"" said Sevilla striker Fernando Llorente on Monday. ""We don't depend on ourselves, but we have to take the first step. There is a big chance that Manchester City, playing for first place in the group, will win at home."" Sevilla only qualified for the Champions League thanks to winning the Europa League for the fourth time in 10 years last season. After a run of four consecutive defeats, coach Unai Emery admitted his side haven't dealt with the step up in quality to Europe's premier club competition, but believes they can return next season via the Europa League once more. ""We all wanted to play in the Champions League and, when you do that, the demands increase,"" he said. ""Rising to that challenge is the goal we haven't been able to accomplish. The next goal is to return to the Champions League with Sevilla. We have the power tomorrow to beat Juventus and have an open door to the Europa League."" Sevilla have also suffered an inconsistent campaign in La Liga, but have beaten Real Madrid and Barcelona at the Sanchez Pizjuan already this season and Emery wants his side to reach that level of performance against the Italian champions. ""We need to play like we did against Madrid and Barcelona and find consistency. ""We don't depend on ourselves to continue in Europe, but it is in our hands to play well and prepare ourselves for an opponent that will demand a lot."""
150,25/11/2015,22:49,Gladbach run riot to end Sevilla hopes,Borussia Moenchengladbach enjoyed an historic first Champions League win on Wednesday as their 4-2 home victory over Sevilla ended the Spaniards' hopes of reaching the knock-out phase.,"A brace by Lars Stindl, plus goals from Fabian Johnson and Raffael capped Gladbach's win which lifted them off the bottom of Group D in an impressive display. Manchester City and Juventus have wrapped up the last-16 qualifying spots from the group. Bottom side Sevilla had needed a win at Borussia Park to keep alive their faint hopes of reaching the last 16 but left only with two late consolation goals from Vitolo and an Ever Banega penalty. Borussia, who are in the Champions League for the first time, enjoyed their first home win in Europe since 1978 in the now defunct European Cup. Stindl, in the attacking midfielder role, was outstanding all evening with two goals and an assist for Raffael's final goal. Gladbach are now in pole position to finish third in the group and qualify for the Europa League, but need at least a point in their final game at Manchester City in two weeks. The victory came at a price as Guinea winger Ibrahima Traore limped off after only 13 minutes with a suspected hamstring injury from taking a corner. Gladbach broke the deadlock on 29 minutes when captain Granit Xhaka fired in a low shot, which skidded wide, and Stindl tapped it past stranded Sevilla goalkeeper Sergio Rico. The hosts doubled the lead when USA international Johnson curled his shot across the face of the goal, around Rico and into the far corner on 68 minutes. Raffael then added the third when Stindl drew two defenders and slipped the ball through the backline to the Brazilian, who was clinical in his finishing on 78 minutes. Sevilla enjoyed a brief moment of hope on 82 minutes when Fernando Llorente flicked a pass over the defence and right winger Vitolo lobbed Gladbach goalkeeper Yann Sommer. Gladbach extended their lead within a minute when Stindl blasted in his shot from 20 metres out with a superb strike for his third European goal. Gladbach captain Xhaka gave away a late penalty when he fouled Grzegorz Krychowiak on the edge of the area and Banega blasted home the spot kick."

Victory at Borussia Park would guarantee them at least a place in the Europa League, which they have won for the last two years running. With Gladbach's Champions League exit already confirmed, defeat would confirm the Germans will finish bottom of the group, but they want to knock Sevilla from third to advance to the Europa League. ""We need to be courageous and play our own game, like we did against Juventus,"" said Gladbach's Guinea winger Ibrahima Traore. ""Our confidence is high, we are in good shape and our goal is third place to qualify for the Europa League."" Gladbach are buoyed by their German league form which has seen them climb from bottom to fourth with seven wins and a draw in their eight Bundesliga games since Andre Schubert took charge in September. ""We have to go to our absolute limit and give it everything we have,"" said Schubert, whose side sealed a 2-1 win over Hanover on Saturday in his first game as head coach, with a contract until 2017, after two months as caretaker boss. ""We aren't under any pressure, but we do have a duty to give it our all."" Having drawn 1-1 last time out at home to Juventus, Gladbach want another strong performance. Schubert has breathed life back into Gladbach with a consistent team selection policy, bringing in talented teenagers Andreas Christensen and Mahmoud Dahoud and tightening the defence. He has also given Swiss defensive midfielder Graint Xhaka the captaincy and the 23-year-old, who has been linked to a big-money move to Liverpool, has revelled in the role. The Foals are nine unbeaten since losing at home to Manchester City at the start of September and had few problems beating mid-table Hanover on Saturday with goals by Traore and Brazilian striker Raffael. Sevilla are 11th in the Spanish league. They inflicted a first defeat of the season on La Liga giants Real Madrid with a 3-2 home win three weeks ago when ex-Borussia Dortmund striker Ciro Immobile scored his maiden goal for the club. But on Saturday, they crashed 2-0 at Real Sociedad, who were playing their first match since David Moyes was sacked after a run of six defeats in nine games. Portugal goalkeeper Beto (knee injury), Gaeel Kakuta (thigh) and defender Daniel Carriço (hamstring) will all miss the game with injury."

Benoit Tremoulinas pulled a goal back for Sevilla, but Wilfried Bony restored City's two-goal cushion before half-time. Borussia Moenchengladbach's 1-1 draw with Juventus in the other game in the group means City cannot now be caught by the Germans or Sevilla due to their superior head-to-head record. Victory takes City a point ahead of Juventus at the top of the group with the two set to meet in Turin in three weeks' time. Kevin de Bruyne had fired a late winner when the sides met at the Etihad two weeks ago, but the Belgian was left out of Manuel Pellegrini's starting line-up in favour of Jesus Navas on his homecoming after making nearly 400 appearances for Sevilla. Yet, even without the on-form Belgian and the injured Sergio Aguero and David Silva, City started at a whirlwind pace and were 2-0 up inside 11 minutes. Sterling opened the scoring with his first European goal for City as he was played in by Fernandinho's fine through ball and slotted calmly into the far corner. The pace of Sterling and Navas was causing Sevilla endless problems on the counter-attack and the visitors should have made more of an overlap when Sterling teed up Aleksandr Kolarov to fire an effort that Rico parried to safety. Sevilla's reprieve only lasted a minute as another counter-attack saw Sterling set up Bony and although his inital effort was brilliantly saved by Rico, Fernandinho was on hand to nod into an empty net. Navas then fired against the post as City threatened to run riot. However, Sevilla managed to wrestle themselves back into the game as the half wore on. Fernando Llorente fired the first warning Joe Hart's way when he just couldn't turn Vicente Iborra's header on target. The hosts did get a goal back in some style on 25 minutes when Coke skipped past Nicolas Otamendi and his deft cross was headed in by Tremoulinas at the back post. Only a fantastic stop from Hart then prevented a Sevilla equaliser as he got down to parry Timothee Kolodziejczak's header before Iborra could only fired the rebound into the side-netting. Yet, Sevilla undid all their good work nine minutes before the break when Navas was given acres of room down the right to pick out Bony to side-foot home his first Champions League goal. City should have added to their lead after the break as Rico again came to the hosts rescue to beat away Fernandinho's fierce effort before Bony slotted wide with the goal at his mercy after more good work by Sterling. Yaya Toure was inches away from rounding off arguably City's most accomplished Champions League performance 18 minutes from time after a lovely one-two with Bony. Sterling was replaced by De Bruyne to a smattering of applause from the Sevilla fans which spoke volumes of the Englishman's display. But De Bruyne had little time to add to his six City goals as Pellegrini's men comfortably saw out the final stages to take their place in the last 16."

154,02/11/2015,15:56,Man City clash a must win - Sevilla boss,Sevilla coach Unai Emery believes his side have to beat Premier League leaders Manchester City on Tuesday to have any chance of advancing to the last 16 of the Champions League.,"The Europa League holders sit third in Group D, three points behind City, with Italian champions Juventus a point further clear at the top of the table. ""If we win tomorrow then City are catchable,"" Emery said on Monday. ""If we draw we have a significant disadvantage, plus there is Juve there already with seven points. ""Therefore, tomorrow is decisive. If we want to have optimistic hopes of reaching the last 16 then winning is the only option we have."" Emery questioned his side's fight after they suffered a fourth defeat in 10 La Liga games this season at Villarreal on Saturday to slip to 11th in the table. However, they have won their last 10 European games at home en route to winning back-to-back Europa League titles and three consecutive matches in La Liga at the Sanchez Pizjuan, including a 2-1 win over Barcelona last month. ""Tomorrow we are playing at the Sanchez Pizjuan and we have to continue with this consistency,"" added Emery. ""It is a huge challenge, similar to that when we played Barcelona for the calibre of the opponent, the leaders of the Premier League, and it will take our best to overcome them."" Sevilla were denied a deserved point away to City two weeks ago as Kevin de Bruyne's injury time winner handed the English side a 2-1 win. However, Spanish international Vitolo said that match has given Sevilla confidence they can inflict another painful European night upon City. ""I think in the first game you saw that we have a good team when we play for each other,"" said the winger. ""We worked very hard and it is clear that we can make things even more difficult for them at home in front of our fans. ""In the past two years the success we have had has been based on us all running and fighting for the team above any individual. ""If we want to do great things we need to do the same. Work together and run for each other."" Emery is hopeful of having influential Argentine midfielder Ever Banega fit after he missed Saturday's defeat due to an ankle injury. However, top scorer Kevin Gameiro misses out with a hamstring problem."

But the diminutive striker suffered a hamstring injury in the Europa League holders 2-1 defeat at Villarreal on Saturday. Sevilla remain hopeful he could return for Real Madrid's Liga game in Seville next weekend. ""Gameiro suffered a grade one tear in his left hamstring according to tests carried out this morning,"" Sevilla said on their website on Sunday. ""The injury will prevent him playing on Tuesday against Manchester City,"" the statement confirmed."
156,22/10/2015,02:17,Pellegrini purrs over 'perfect' De Bruyne,"Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini branded Kevin De Bruyne the ""perfect"" signing after the Belgian forward's 91st-minute goal snatched a 2-1 Champions League victory over Sevilla.","With Wednesday's Group D game at the Etihad Stadium poised at 1-1, Pellegrini rejigged his attack by moving De Bruyne up front and the change paid off when the 24-year-old fired home left-footed from Yaya Toure's pass. It was De Bruyne's first Champions League goal since his club-record £55 million ($84.8 million, 74.8 million euros) transfer from Wolfsburg and it had the effect of lifting City three points clear of Sevilla and to within a point of leaders Juventus at the group's halfway point. ""We bought Kevin because we thought he was a very creative player and he has goals in him,"" Pellegrini told his post-match press conference. ""This team always tries to play attractive and offensive football and for that you need good players. I think that in all senses, he was the perfect player to arrive to our team."" De Bruyne's strike, his seventh in nine games for club and country, was City's reward for a dogged display in which they weathered several spells of Sevilla pressure. City trailed for only six minutes, Adil Rami's own goal cancelling out Yehven Konoplyanka's 30th-minute opener, and yet prior to a late surge by the Premier League leaders, it was the Spanish side who looked the more likely winners. But after an opening 2-1 loss to Juventus, City have now come from behind to win twice, having beaten Borussia Moenchengladbach 2-1 on their previous outing courtesy of a last-minute Sergio Aguero penalty. ""It's important because we won both games in the last minute and in both games we were one goal down,"" Pellegrini said. ""Maybe you've had a lot of criticism about this team in Europe, but I think that these two last games reflect that we have the character to try to win. ""We will try to improve our play, but for me the character, concentration and intensity to win in Europe is also very important."" City will now switch their thoughts to Sunday's trip to Manchester United and Pellegrini said they would approach the derby with a spring in their step. ""When you win, it's very important for the trust (confidence) of the players to arrive at an important game like the derby winning and not losing, with a lot of doubts,"" said the Chilean. ""It's a very tight (Champions League) group with nine points more to play for, but now it's important to recover and continue having good performances in the Premier League. ""It's always good to arrive at a derby when you've won."" Pellegrini refused to be drawn, however, when asked whether captain Vincent Kompany would remain on the bench at Old Trafford, with Nicolas Otamendi and Eliaquim Mangala having been preferred to the Belgian -- fit again after a calf problem -- against Sevilla. ""We have a lot of different things to think about,"" was all he would say. Defeat prolonged a difficult start to the season for Europa League champions Sevilla, who are currently 13th in La Liga with only two wins from eight games. But with home matches against City and Juventus to come in the Champions League, sandwiching a trip to Gladbach, coach Unai Emery remains optimistic about his team's chances of reaching the round of 16. ""The next game is at home and the Sanchez Pijuan is really special, where the team usually plays to a high level,"" he said. ""We'll have the fans behind us, and I won't give up while it's still possible. We have chances to win the next game and if we do well, we'll be in with a shout. ""We can learn from what we've done in the short term, and then think about the next game against Getafe. ""We might be frustrated, but we need to realise we've learnt things about ourselves that will make us a better team."""
157,21/10/2015,22:55,Last-gasp De Bruyne shoots down Sevilla,Kevin De Bruyne's injury-time strike illuminated Manchester City's path to the Champions League last 16 as they beat Sevilla 2-1 in dramatic fashion at the Etihad Stadium on Wednesday.,"An open, occasionally breathless game was heading for a draw after Adil Rami's own goal had cancelled out Yevhen Konoplyanka's 30th-minute opener for Sevilla, only for De Bruyne to gather a pass from Yaya Toure and slam home with his left foot seconds into stoppage time. City had been second-best at times against the Europa League champions, but De Bruyne's goal enabled them to move three points clear of their Spanish rivals in Group D and close to within a point of leaders Juventus. Manuel Pellegrini's side now face their two most difficult games of the group phase, away to Sevilla and then Juventus, who won 2-1 at the Etihad last month, but they will travel with hope fully intact after securing only a fourth win in 13 Champions League home games. It was a special night for City winger Jesus Navas, who made 393 appearances for Sevilla over a 10-year spell, and he almost opened the scoring with a 25-yard shot that faded away from the left-hand post. The Spaniard's early sighter was in keeping with a positive start by the hosts, who also saw Wilfried Bony -- deputising for the injured Sergio Aguero -- prod a shot straight at Sergio Rico before De Bruyne dragged a shot wide. But City's fans have learnt to be wary of Champions League home games and their anxieties resurfaced in the 17th minute when Konoplyanka wobbled the post with a cunning free-kick from wide on the right and Joe Hart had to turn Grzegorz Krychowiak's follow-up effort behind. Suddenly City looked edgy, Timothee Kolodziejczak flicking a corner across the face of goal and Krychowiak heading wide from another dead-ball situation, and on the half hour Sevilla's pressure told. Bacary Sagna, filling in again at left-back with Aleksandar Kolarov only fit enough for the bench, had been caught upfield once already and on the second occasion it proved fatal, with Vitolo stealing in behind him and teeing up Konoplyanka to sweep home. Fortunately for the Frenchman, it took City just six minutes to equalise. Toure had hit out at a perceived lack of recognition in the English media prior to the game, but here he took matters into his own hands in a manner that recalled his displays in City's 2011-12 and 2013-14 title-winning campaigns. Faced up by Kolodziejczak on the right-hand side of the area, the Ivorian rolled his man brilliantly before crossing from the byline. Raheem Sterling's firmly hit shot was kept out by Rico, but Bony instinctively stuck a foot out as the rebound flew towards him and the ball flicked off Rami's right knee and into the goal. Kevin Gameiro had two good opportunities to put Sevilla ahead either side of half-time, heading over from close range on both occasions. There were half-chances for City, De Bruyne drilling wide and seeing a shot blocked after neatly moving the ball onto his left foot, but Sevilla continued to find gaps, Vicente Iborra volleying wide and substitute Michael Krohn-Dehli hitting the side-netting. Pellegrini's solution was to send on Fernando in front of Bony, which freed Toure to go forward and saw De Bruyne move up front. Belatedly, City sparked, Bruyne's cross narrowly evading Sterling and Rico thwarting Toure before the Belgian dealt the decisive blow at the death."
158,03/10/2015,19:09,Luis Enrique sure Barca's killer touch will return,Barcelona coach Luis Enrique backed his misfiring strikers to find their form after the European champions were beaten 2-1 at Sevilla on Saturday.,"The Catalans were without the injured Lionel Messi, but still had 28 shots on goal as Luis Suarez and Neymar failed to find a way past Sergio Rico in the Sevilla goal until a late penalty from the Brazilian pulled a goal back. ""It was a game in which both sides had a lot of chances, it is almost incredible that we go away from here having scored just one goal after seeing the ball ping around the opposition box,"" said Enrique. ""We have players of the highest level, you only have to look at their numbers. ""As coaches we always look to have the greatest number of chances possible because the individual talents of those players will finish them. That is the difference between those stars and other players. ""We are far from having our best numbers in that facet of the game in general from the whole team since the start of the season, but that will change for sure, I don't have any doubt."" Barca have now lost two of their last three league games and can be passed by either Real Madrid or Atletico Madrid in the table when the capital city rivals face each other on Sunday. And Enrique refused to take any solace in the fact that his side had dominated large spells of the game despite being shorn of Andres Iniesta as well as Messi. ""There is no one that can be happy at Barca when you lose. It doesn't matter that we created a lot of chances. The objective is always to win and if you don't you cannot be happy."" Suarez insisted that his boss hadn't given him or Neymar any special instructions on how to cope without Messi and admitted his culpability in passing up a series of first-half chances to put the visitors in front. ""We did enough to at least not lose the game,"" said the Uruguayan. ""In the first-half was when we missed our chance to go in front. They started the second-half very quickly. We reacted enough to get back into the game at 2-1 and had a lot of shots from outside the area that were blocked, but we did all we could to not lose the game. ""They scored a great first goal and you have to give credit to the opponents as well. The second one surprised us a bit more. ""The team showed its character in a difficult moment to try and turn the game around."""
159,29/09/2015,19:56,Sevilla inspired by Europa triumph for Juve clash,Coach Unai Emery said Sevilla will look for inspiration from their Europa League triumph two years ago when they seek to belie their poor La Liga form against Juventus in their Champions League group D clash on Wednesday.,"Emery has fond memories of Juventus Stadium, having steered his side to the first of two consecutive Europa League triumphs in 2014 when they beat Benfica in a penalty shoot-out. But the La Liga side are in a transition phase following the departure of key players during the summer, and have been hit hard recently with injury. Sevilla's form in the Spanish top flight appears at odds with what will be required to beat Juventus in Turin on Wednesday. Emery's men only moved up to fifth from bottom at the weekend after claiming their first win of the season. The only positive for the visitors is that Juve, who have slumped to 15th place in Serie A, are in similar straits. With Beto, Adil Rami, Daniel Carrico, Nico Pareja, Ever Banega, Gael Kakuta and Fernando Llorente all missing out through injury, Emery admitted his first team choices will be limited. But the Spaniard is counting on the 11 players he does choose. ""After winning the Europa League here, we're back for the Champions League which in football terms is the best event in the world,"" said Emery. ""We're really motivated being back here. I will pick the best 11 players I have and hopefully they will go out and capitalise on the experience of being here."" Sevilla, who defended their Europa League title with a 3-2 triumph over Dnipro in Warsaw last season, opened their group campaign with a 3-0 win at home against Borussia Moenchengladbach. Juventus stunned Manchester City 2-1, meaning both sides find themselves in the peculiar situation of winning in Europe while struggling at domestic level. Juventus have several key players out injured, with striker Mario Mandzukic (thigh) joining a casualty list that already includes Claudio Marchisio. On Tuesday, Swiss wingback/defender Stephan Lichsteiner was also ruled out, as was Martin Caceres -- although the Uruguayan was suspended by the club for crashing his Ferrari while driving under the influence. Sevilla defender Grzegorz Krychowiak said: ""Both sides started the season badly. Juve are a great side with top players but we have a lot of belief in ourselves and I'm sure both will play well."" Asked if Sevilla would be looking to play for a draw, Krychowiak said: ""No, we always play to win."" Emery, meanwhile, suggested that when it comes to the Champions League, the influence of domestic form goes out the window. ""Juventus showed they can beat Manchester City, away from home when City were playing well,"" said Emery. ""They have a great side full of top quality players."""
160,29/09/2015,02:34,Domestic form unwelcome as Juve host Sevilla,Juventus host Sevilla hoping to continue their positive start to this season's Champions League in a group D encounter that will see both sides endeavour to leave their poor domestic form well behind them.,"Juventus's stock among Europe's football elite rose considerably after they became the first Italian team since Inter Milan in 2010 to reach last season's final, where they were outclassed 3-1 by Barcelona. But hopes of a repeat this year are already looking slim, if Juve's disappointing start to the fledgling Serie A season is anything to go by -- although Sevilla are in similar straits. While Juventus have dropped to 15th place with just five points from six games -- their worst start to a season since 1969-70 -- Sevilla sit just two points off the relegation zone in La Liga after six games. Both have struggled to adapt to a significant turnover of players over the summer, although in Europe's premier club competition both, ironically, have made impressive starts. Juve claimed a shock 2-1 win at Manchester City thanks to goals in open play from Mario Mandzukic and Alvaro Morata, while Sevilla kicked off their campaign with a 3-0 win over Borussia Moenchengladbach. But in a matter of weeks the landscape has changed dramatically for the Italian champions, whose confidence levels -- if Saturday's 2-1 defeat at Napoli was anything to go by -- look uncharacteristically low. Mandzukic is sidelined as he recovers from a thigh strain, while Juve's dysfunctioning midfield is in dire need of Claudio Marchisio, who is also out with a thigh injury. The only good news for Allegri's men of late is the return to the squad of Swiss wing-back/defender Stephan Lichsteiner following his speedy recovery from a head knock. Midfielder Sami Khedira also trained with the squad on Monday, but the German, whose Juve debut lasted only 25 minutes into a pre-season friendly against Marseille on August 1, is not expected to be match fit until next weekend. With four consecutive league titles under their belt and having won their first league and Cup double last season for the first time in 20 years, the impact of Juve's domestic woes cannot be underestimated. When club captain and goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon gave a rare television interview on Sunday, it was seen as a collective mea culpa but also an impassioned call to arms. ""We have to put aside all talk of the scudetto for the next few months,"" Buffon said. ""The distance (between Juventus and the top of the league) is so great that we can't allow ourselves to get carried away by flights of fancy."" Buffon added: ""We have to roll up our sleeves, get our hands dirty and deal with the situation. We know what we need to change to improve, and we'll be taking it now match by match. ""The Champions League is a beautiful showcase, and it's now a chance for us to regain a certain degree of certainty and enthusiasm. ""We need a ferocious, determined approach to Sevilla. It's a game we want to win."" If Sevilla are to travel with confidence to Manchester City in three weeks time, a result at Juventus Stadium would be welcomed by Unai Emery's men. The Andalusians may have been decimated by injury, with Beto, Adil Rami, Daniel Carrico, Nico Pareja, Ever Banega and Gael Kakuta all missing out through injury, but Emery's side are no strangers to tough, European fixtures. The Spaniards are the defending Europa League champions and although they expect to be facing another testing game, Emery said: ""We want to love the Champions League like we did the Europa League. ""We are going there with the idea of enjoying the experience and improving. ""Juventus were the Champions League finalists, they are a great team, although at the moment they are a bit below that level. ""I am sure in the Champions League they will perform very well."""

Celta's bright start to the campaign had been aided by their three previous opponents having a man sent-off early on, but they needed no such help in Andalusia as a brilliant first-half display put them on course for victory. Nolito added to his burgeoning reputation as one of Spain's top strikers with a sweet finish from a narrow angle to open the scoring before Daniel Wass pounced on some shambolic Sevilla defending to fire in the second. Fernando Llorente was introduced at half-time by Sevilla boss Unai Emery and made a quick impact by nodding home his first goal for the club nine minutes into the second period. Yet, for all their dominance in the final half hour, Sevilla couldn't find an equaliser as they remain on just two points after four games. Athletic are only one point better off as they have struggled to overcome the hangover of their Spanish Super Cup success over Barcelona to start the campaign. By contrast, Villarreal are flying high as they scored three goals for the third consecutive game thanks to a penalty from Bruno and fine strikes from Mario Gaspar and Leo Baptistao before Aritz Aduriz scored a consolation for the visitors in stoppage time. Sporting Gijon claimed their first victory since returning to the top flight with a 3-2 win in a thrilling encounter away at Deportivo la Coruna. Antonio Sarabia struck twice in the opening seven minutes for Sporting before Juanfran and Luis Alberto brought Deportivo level before the half hour mark. However, the visitors got the winner in an open first-half through Alex Menendez to move into the top half of the table."

163,14/09/2015,02:16,Winless Sevilla seek Champions League refuge,Confidence will be in short measure when Sevilla take on Borussia Moenchengladbach in their Champions League opener on Tuesday with both sides still searching for their first win of the season.,"Sevilla have taken just two points from their opening three La Liga fixtures as well as losing out to Barcelona 5-4 after extra time in a remarkable UEFA Super Cup final last month. However, the Spanish side could have a psychological edge after beating Moenchengladbach in both legs to win 4-2 on aggregate on their way to winning the Europa League last season. Another busy summer of comings and goings at the Sanchez Pizjuan has been pinpointed as one of the reasons for a slow start to the campaign by Unai Emery's men. However, the Andalusians have also been hamstrung by a series of injuries. Goalkeeper Beto became the latest player forced onto the sidelines as he suffered a sprained lateral ligament in his right knee that is expected to keep him out for up to six weeks in a 1-1 draw at Levante on Friday. Defenders Adil Rami, Nico Pareja and Daniel Carrico will all miss out through injury. Moenchengladbach's start to the Bundesliga season has been even more disastrous as they sit bottom of the table having lost all four opening games for the first time in their history. ""Our situation in the Bundesliga is unusual and uncomfortable for us, so it's hard to talk about Sevilla,"" midfielder Andre Hahn said to the Moenchengladbach website. ""I think the game could be a nice break from the league. It's also perhaps an advantage for us that we don't have too much time to dwell on the Hamburg game. ""In any case, we're going into it with a lot of excitement. We worked hard last season to earn ourselves this chance, so we're looking forward to finally getting to hear the Champions League anthem."" Swiss international Granit Xhaka is suspended for the visitors after being sent-off in the second-leg of last season's tie against Sevilla. Meanwhile, captain Martin Stranzl is out after suffering a fractured cheekbone in Friday's 3-0 home defeat to Hamburg."

""The estimated period of time out is between four and six weeks."" Sevilla open their Champions League campaign at home to Borussia Monchengladbach on Tuesday. The Andalusians are already without the defensive trio of Adil Rami, Nico Pareja and Daniel Carrico due to long-term injuries. Unai Emery's men are still searching for their first win of the campaign after taking two points from their first three La Liga games and losing the UEFA Super Cup final 5-4 to Barcelona last month."
165,11/09/2015,22:44,Winless Sevilla held at Levante,Europa League holders Sevilla are still looking for their first win of the season after they were held 1-1 at Levante on Friday.,"Former Stoke City midfielder Steven N'Zonzi gave the visitors a deserved lead when he curled home his first goal for the Andalusians after just 12 minutes. However, Sevilla failed to turn their dominance into a more commanding lead in the first-half and were made to pay after the break. Victor Camarasa levelled from close range just before the hour mark after Sevilla 'keeper Beto had made a fine initial save from Nabil Ghilas. Both sides now have just two points from their opening three La Liga fixtures. Champions Barcelona are in action on Saturday when they face a daunting trip to face Atletico Madrid. Real Madrid also play on Saturday away at Espanyol."
166,30/08/2015,22:38,Atletico show title credentials with win at Sevilla,"Atletico Madrid maintained their perfect start to the La Liga season as goals from Koke, Gabi and Jackson Martinez handed them an impressive 3-0 win at Sevilla on Sunday.","The visitors had the better of the opening period and deservedly went in front when Koke slotted home after good work from Antoine Griezmann. Sevilla were beaten at home only once last season and threw everything at the Atletico goal after the break but couldn't find a way through before Gabi's deflected effort 12 minutes from time made the points safe. And substitute Martinez put the seal on a huge win for Diego Simeone's men with a fine curling effort to register his first goal for the club. Sevilla handed a debut to Fernando Llorente after he completed his switch from Juventus on Thursday and it was the hosts who started brightest as Coke forced Jan Oblak into a smart save after just three minutes. Atletico slowly grew into the game to take control of the first-half and were nearly handed a fortunate opener when Griezmann's free-kick struck Fernando Torres and flew inches wide with Sevilla 'keeper Beto wrong-footed. Beto was then forced into action for the first time as he parried Oliver's fierce effort, but there was nothing he could do as Koke pounced from close range after being played in by a prone Griezmann. Sevilla eventually carved out a glorious chance to equalise after the break when Diego Godin only half-cleared a cross from the left, but Llorente missed the chance to make himself an instant hero as he pulled his shot wide. Atletico then doubled their advantage against the run of play when Gabi's hopeful shot from range took a big deflection on its way into the bottom corner. Martinez had replaced Torres seconds before the second goal and made his case to start against Barcelona next time out with a stunning finish from outside the box to open his account after a 35 million euro move from Porto. Elsewhere, Valencia are still looking for their first win of the league season after being held 1-1 at home by Deportivo la Coruna. Lucas Perez put the visitors in front with a stunning individual effort before Alvaro Negredo levelled for Los Che just before the break. Basque minnows Eibar also maintained their 100 percent start to the campaign with a 2-0 win over local rivals Athletic Bilbao to go joint top with Celta Vigo."
167,26/08/2015,21:58,Juve's Llorente set for Sevilla medical,"Juventus striker Fernando Llorente is set to join Europa League winners Sevilla with teammate Mauricio Isla also on his way to the Spanish club, it was announced on Wednesday.","Juventus signed Llorente -- scorer of seven goals in 24 appearances for Spain and a member of the 2010 World Cup and Euro 2012 winning sides -- on a free transfer from Athletic Bilbao two years ago but the towering striker is now surplus to requirements in Turin and Juve have decided to cash in with Sevilla confirming the deal on Wednesday. ""Fernando Llorente is coming to Seville tonight with permission from his club, Juventus, to have a medical in the next few hours with Sevilla FC"", said the La Liga side. Gazzetta dello Sport's website had earlier said the Italian champions will recoup 7m euros ($10m) plus performance-related bonuses for the 30-year-old Spaniard, who will sign a permanent deal with Unai Emery's side and fill the gap left by the departure of Colombian international Carlos Bacca to AC Milan. Chilean international midfielder Isla, who last season went on loan to Queens Park Rangers, is also reported to be part of the deal. Juventus have seen key changes among personnel in the wake of losing the Champions League final to Barcelona last May. Striker Carlos Tevez (Boca Juniors) and midfielders Arturo Vidal (Bayern Munich), Andrea Pirlo (New York City FC) and Simone Pepe (Chievo) were among the several players who left the club. But the Old Lady have filled the gaps, and arguably have an excess of strikers with Mario Mandzukic (Atletico Madrid) and Paulo Dybala (Palermo) joining this summer, with Spanish international Alvaro Morata and French youngster Kingsley Coman already on their books. Coach Massimiliano Allegri welcomed a total of seven new faces in the close season, including Germany international midfielder Sami Khedira (Real Madrid), Brazilian defender Alex Sandro (FC Porto) and Chelsea forward Juan Cuadrado, who sealed a season-long loan move from the English champions on Tuesday."
168,11/08/2015,23:21,Pedro Barca's hero in nine-goal Super Cup classic,Barcelona added the UEFA Super Cup to their treble win of trophies last season despite blowing a 4-1 lead with a stunning 5-4 win over Sevilla thanks to Pedro Rodriguez's extra time winner.,"Two magnificent free-kicks from Lionel Messi plus goals from Rafinha and Luis Suarez looked to have Barca well on course to claim their fourth trophy of the year after Ever Banega had given Sevilla a shock early lead. However, Jose Antonio Reyes reduced the arrears before a Kevin Gameiro penalty and a debut strike from Yevhen Konoplyanka forced the game into an extra 30 minutes. Barca weren't to be denied, though, and, in what could be his last game for the club, Pedro pounced on the rebound after Beto had denied Messi his hat-trick. Pedro had been controversially left out of the starting line-up despite the absence of Neymar due to the mumps as he appears set for a move to Manchester United after Barca technical secretary Robert Fernandez admitted he has asked to leave the club. ""He deserves it,"" Messi said of Pedro's match-winning contribution. ""The players and the club don't know what he is going to do. It is his decision, but whatever he does we wish him the best."" Sevilla made the brighter start and Javier Mascherano was lucky to avoid further punishment after being adjudged to have brought down Reyes on the edge of the area. The punishment was still to come for the European champions, though, as Banega clinically curled the resulting free-kick past the helpless Marc-Andre Ter Stegen with an effort his international teammate Messi would have been proud of. Unfortunately, for Unai Emery's men the lead lasted only four minutes as Suarez was blocked by Grzegorz Krychowiak and Messi delicately chipped the ball over the wall into the top corner. The four-time World Player of the Year's next set-piece was even more spectacular as he this time fired a free-kick in off the inside of the post to move level with Cristiano Ronaldo as the all-time leading scorer in European competitions with 80. Suarez passed up a huge chance for the third when he fired straight at Beto two minutes before half-time but made immediate amends by collecting the rebound to tee up Rafinha to slot home. Sevilla's hopes of a comeback appeared to be over when a shocking pass from Benoit Tremoulinas was intercepted by Sergio Busquets and turned home by Suarez. Yet, they were given a lifeline when Reyes turned home Vitolo's excellent cross at the far post to reduce the arrears. Jeremy Mathieu then pulled down Vitolo inside the area and was also lucky only to see a yellow card before Gameiro fired home the spot-kick. And a remarkable comeback was complete when two substitutes on their debut combined for the equaliser as Konoplyanka tapped home Ciro Immobile's low cross. Pedro was finally introduced three minutes into extra time and just as in the Super Cup six years ago against Shakhtar Donetsk he grabbed the winner by firing into the roof of the net after Beto had parried Messi's follow-up effort from another dangerous free-kick. Sevilla still had two great chances to force an incredible match into a penalty shootout but both Coke and Adil Rami fired off target as a relieved Barca hung on."

Sources close to Bordeaux said Sevilla would pay a little over three million euros ($3.25m, £2m) for the former Fluminense defender, who has a year remaining on his contract. Sevilla, who will feature in this season's Champions League, have been busy in the transfer market recently, having already signed French midfielder Steven Nzonzi from Stoke City for 9.7 million euros this week and added Italian striker Ciro Immobile on loan from Borussia Dortmund. Last week they signed Ukraine winger Yevhen Konoplyanka from Dnipro, the team Sevilla beat in May's Europa League final, while French defender Adil Rami has also arrived from AC Milan. However, they have sold Aleix Vidal to Barcelona, Stephane Mbia to Trabzonspor and striker Carlos Bacca to Milan."
170,12/07/2015,17:23,Dortmund loan misfit Immobile to Sevilla,Borussia Dortmund have sent Italy striker Ciro Immobile on loan to Europa League champions Sevilla following just one season in Germany after he failed to break into the first team.,"The 25-year-old, who was brought in to replace Robert Lewandowski, is set to sign a one-year deal to join the Spanish league side after starting just nine league games for Dortmund last season since his transfer from Torino in 2014. He failed to make his mark on the 2013 Champions League finalists having been the Serie A top scorer with 22 goals in 33 appearances in his final season in Italy. He scored just three goals in 23 league appearances, most of which were off the bench. Immobile scored four goals in six Champions League games for Dortmund last season and according to media reports, the German club will receive an initial payment of three million euros ($3.3m) for the player who cost them 18 million. New Dortmund coach Thomas Tuchel is said to have no plans for Immobile in his team and the Italian did not help his cause by oversleeping for a team public relations appointment on their recent Asia tour. Seville confirmed the transfer on their website and said Immobile will undergo a medical in Spain on Monday."

Stoke's previous record transfer fee received was £4.5 million from Bundesliga outfit Wolfsburg for Tuncay Sanli in 2011. ""The club would like to place on record its thanks to Steven and offer him our best wishes,"" read a statement from Stoke. Stoke manager Mark Hughes had said on Wednesday that, hard as they had tried, there had been no persuading Nzonzi in staying and thus Sevilla were granted permission to speak to him. ""We worked really hard to persuade him his future lay here but it didn't seem to be enough for him,"" said Hughes. His sale represents good business for Stoke as they signed him for just £3 million three years ago from Blackburn Rovers. Since then Nzonzi, who joined Rovers from French side Amiens in 2009, has played 120 times for Stoke but was no stranger to wishing to leave them having asked for a transfer in 2013 and again in 2014. Nzonzi may well not be the only player to leave Stoke in the near future as Bosnian international goalkeeper Asmir Begovic has been linked to a move to Chelsea."

Stoke manager Mark Hughes said that hard as they had tried there had been no persuading Nzonzi in staying and thus Sevilla were granted permission to speak to him. ""We worked really hard to persuade him his future lay here but it didn't seem to be enough for him,"" said Hughes. His sale if it goes through will still represent good business for Stoke as they signed him for just £3million three years ago from Blacburn Rovers when the latter were relegated from the Premier League. Since then Nzonzi, who joined Rovers from French side Amiens in 2009 when they were relegated to the third tier of French football, played 120 times for Stoke but is no stranger to wishing to leave them having asked for a transfer in 2013 and again in 2014 but had the first one turned down and last year nobody showed any interest in signing him."

179,27/05/2015,22:44,Sevilla retain Europa League trophy,Sevilla became the first side to win the Europa League four times with a thrilling 3-2 win over Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk on Wednesday.,"Carlos Bacca was the hero for the Spaniards as he struck the winner 17 minutes from time to ensure Sevilla also qualify for the group stages of next season's Champions League. It was also the second time they have retained the trophy with all four of their wins coming in the past 10 years. Nikola Kalinic had given Dnipro a dream start to the Ukrainian side's first ever European final as he headed home the opener after just seven minutes. Grzegorz Krychowiak and Bacca turned the game in Sevilla's favour, but Ruslan Rotan's free-kick sent the sides in level once more at the break. Bacca had the final say when he volleyed home, but his strike was nearly overshadowed when Dnipro's Matheus collapsed two minutes from time just after he had been involved in a clash of heads going up for a header. Thankfully, though, the Brazilian was able to move as he was stretchered off to a rousing reception from the whole stadium and both sets of players. Sevilla came into the game as big favourites and made the faster start with English referee Martin Atkinson turning down strong claims for a penalty when Jose Antonio Reyes went down under pressure from Rotan. However, they were stunned moments later when Kalinic flicked on a long ball into the path of Matheus and then got on the end of his cross to head home the opener. Sevilla responded like a side that have won this competition three times in the previous nine years as they laid siege to the Dnipro goal in search of an equaliser. Vitolo saw his shot bravely blocked when well-placed on the edge of the area before Reyes flashed an effort just wide. Krychowiak then forced Denys Boyko into a superb save with a downward header from Ever Banega's corner. However, the Polish international had to wait just four more minutes to register on home soil as he showed great composure to control Bacca's layoff before firing low past Boyko. Unai Emery's men had turned the game on its head three minutes later when Bacca controlled Reyes's brilliant through ball and rounded Boyko before slotting into an empty net. Yet an incredibly open game turned again before the break. Firstly, Sergio Rico produced a stunning save to turn Yevhen Konoplyanka's dipping drive over the bear. There was nothing Rico could do though when Rotan curled in a fantastic free-kick two minutes before half-time. The second-half started at a more pedestrian pace with Dnipro enjoying more of the ball than in the first period. Slowly, though, Sevilla started to impose themselves as the half wore on and went close in quick succession from two corners as Krychowiak was crowded out before Atkinson waved away more penalty appeals when Vitolo went down inside the area. The winner ultimately arrived when Bacca latched onto Vitolo's pass and confidently dispatched the ball past Boyko for his 28th goal of the season. And Boyko prevented Bacca a memorable hat-trick as he got just enough on the ball to turn the Colombian's header over moments later."
180,26/05/2015,11:40,Sevilla seek history against dogged Dnipro,Sevilla can become the first side ever to win four Europa League or UEFA Cup titles when the holders face a Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk side playing in their first major European final on Wednesday.,"Moreover, victory would also secure direct qualification to next season's Champions League having missed out by just a point to Valencia in the battle for fourth place in La Liga. ""The growth that the team has experienced is thanks to what we feel for the Europa League,"" Sevilla boss Unai Emery told Uefa.com. ""It means something. The team want the fans to feel the vibrations that this competition gives us. We've achieved something that makes us bigger, it gives us prestige, it gives us a place in history and recognition in Europe for our hard work. ""We can't deny that we have the chance to write history. Of course we are grateful to have that chance, to be able to pursue this. ""We are aiming to achieve something with this team, with Sevilla. It shouldn't feel like pressure or stop us from executing our game plan against Dnipro. It will serve more as motivation, like a dream we can achieve."" In contrast to the late goals and two penalty shootouts that led them to glory in last season's Europa League, Emery's men have been rampant this campaign losing just once in 14 games and scoring 26 goals in the process. Dnipro's unlikely road to Warsaw has been far more hard-fought as the Ukrainians have won just seven of their 16 matches in reaching the final. However, having already upset the likes of Olympiakos, Ajax and Napoli, coach Myron Markevich is prepared for his side's stiffest task yet in the Polish capital. ""We've studied Sevilla's matches in the national championship and Europa League thoroughly,"" Markevich said. ""They're very strong opponents. I consider Sevilla to be among Europe's 10 strongest clubs. ""I expect a very hard encounter in Warsaw, but we want to show our best in the final."" Dnipro maintained their hopes of Champions League qualification through the Ukranian league with a 3-2 victory over Shakhtar Donetsk at the weekend despite Markevich resting a number of key players ahead of the final. Yet, they could be without striker Yevhen Seleznyov, who scored both goals in the 2-1 aggregate semi-final win over Napoli, as he is a doubt with a knee injury. Other than long-term injury absentees Nico Pareja and Sebastian Cristoforo, Sevilla have a clean bill of health with Timothee Kolodziejczak and Vitolo expected to be fit despite missing Saturday's 3-2 win at Malaga due to injury. And the Spaniards could have the local fans on their side too with Polish international Grzegorz Krychowiak set to start in midfield."
181,15/05/2015,00:02,"Holders Sevilla, unheralded Dnipro, into Europa League final","Holders Sevilla, who crushed Fiorentina, face unheralded Ukrainians Dnipro in the Europa League final in Warsaw on May 27.","The finalists progress to the Polish capital finale in wildly contrasting fashions. Sevilla, seeking a record fourth success in the competition, were firmly in the driving seat after last week's 3-0 first leg success, and finished off Fiorentina with first half goals from Carlos Bacca and Daniel Carrico. Dnipro, a former rocket factory side, on the other hand secured their first ever European final by grittily edging Rafa Benitez's Napoli 1-0 in Kiev to go through 2-1 on aggregate. Napoli, the 1989 UEFA Cup winners, were the better side in the first half but Yevhen Seleznyov put paid to their Europa League dreams when heading past keeper Mariano Andujar in the 58th minute, with Yevhen Konoplyanka's cross from the left setting up the all important goal. Napoli will be fed up with the sight of Seleznyov as it was he who had come on as a substitute last week to snatch a vital 1-1 draw in Naples. Napoli's Gonzalo Higuain had an early effort kept out by Dnipro keeper Denys Boyko, who also proved a match for the Argentina striker as the half hour appoached. In relentless rain, Dnipro emerged after the break only 45 minutes away from their first ever European final on the away goals rule. But Ukraine international Seleznyov settled the nerves of the 'home' side - Dnipro hosting Napoli in the safety of the Ukraine capital, which is 450 kilometres further away from the conflict in eastern Ukraine than Dnipropetrovsk. In Florence, any hopes of a Fiorentina fightback fizzled out when Colombian striker Bacca opened the scoring for Sevilla in the 22nd minute off an Ever Banega free-kick. Five minutes later the Italians were caught napping by another setpiece, Carrico tapping in a deflected long ball up the right. Fiorentina's attempt at a crucial early goal would have paid off if it hadn't been for Sevilla's young keeper Sergio Rico superbly denying Gonzalo Rodriguez's close range header. Fiornetina manager Vincenzo Montella said: ""We weren't very lucky, at least with the amount of chances we created over the two legs. Sevilla had a good rate of success."" The lopsided manner of Sevilla's path to the final was a world away from last year's route when they needed the away goals rule to see them past Benfica. While the La Liga outfit are old Europa League hands, Dnipro are sailing in uncharted waters, setting up an intriguing climax to the competition with the winner for the first time securing direct entry to next season's Champions League."
182,13/05/2015,02:20,Sevilla on brink of return to Europa League final,Holders Sevilla are on the brink of a return to the Europa League final as they take a 3-0 lead to Italy for the second leg of their semi-final against Fiorentina on Thursday.,"It would take a remarkable turnaround in Florence for Unai Emery's side to miss out on reaching the final again as they look to retain the trophy they won by defeating Benfica on penalties in Turin 12 months ago. A brace by Aleix Vidal and a Kevin Gameiro strike last week have the Spanish side in control and Sevilla are a team in form too, having lost just once in 18 games in all competitions, with that loss coming at the hands of Real Madrid 10 days ago. Currently fifth in La Liga with two games left, three points adrift of Valencia in the fourth and final Champions League qualifying berth, winning the Europa League may be their more likely route into the continent's elite club competition for next season. Emery named goalkeeper Beto, who has been on the sidelines with a shoulder problem, in a squad of 22 for the match at the Stadio Artemio Franchi, where Sevilla right-back Coke is expecting the hosts to throw the kitchen sink at them. ""It is going to be a long 90 minutes. Despite beating them 3-0, Fiore played very well in the first half and had two or three clear chances,"" Coke told the Sevilla website. Winners of the competition in successive years in 2006 and 2007 in its former guise as the UEFA Cup, Sevilla are attempting to become the first club to lift the trophy four times. ""These are historic moments for the club, in your professional career. This competition means a lot to us and you can see the results we have been getting,"" added Coke. Fiorentina, who are fifth in Serie A, must do what they have never done in Europe to overturn a 3-0 first-leg deficit if they are to keep alive their chances of reaching the final in Warsaw and winning a European trophy for the first time since the 1961 Cup Winners' Cup. ""I think the team did not deserve such a heavy defeat,"" Viola coach Vincenzo Montella said of the first leg. ""On Thursday we will above all need great inner belief, the fans pushing us on and a bit of luck. It is my duty to transmit my belief to the team. It will be a huge task, but I believe we can do it against Sevilla."" The prospect of an all-Italian final appears slim, with Napoli also having work to do if they are to progress past Dnipro of Ukraine. The sides played out a 1-1 draw at the San Paolo last week, with Yevhen Seleznyov snatching an away goal for Dnipro after David Lopez had given the 1989 UEFA Cup winners the advantage. While Napoli coach Rafa Benitez is seeking to win the trophy for the third time after previous triumphs with Valencia and Chelsea, Dnipro are aiming to reach a first European final. The path has not been easy for them -- Myron Markevych's side have already played 17 games in Europe this season with their continental campaign beginning with a 2-0 defeat to FC Copenhagen in the Champions League third qualifying round in August. They will 'host' Napoli in Kiev, which is 450 kilometres further away from the conflict in eastern Ukraine than Dnipropetrovsk. Nevertheless, Seleznyov is hoping Dnipro can emulate the performance of compatriots Shakhtar Donetsk, who won the UEFA Cup in 2009. Seleznyov, who was on the books at Shakhtar six years ago but did not play in their 2-1 final victory over Werder Bremen, told UEFA.com: ""I didn't appreciate the importance of that triumph for the city of Donetsk and for Shakhtar. ""Winning a European trophy was very significant back then -- and that's still the case.""

183,10/05/2015,23:18,Sevilla slip-up hands Atletico Champions League return,Atletico Madrid secured their place in the Champions League for next season despite only managing a 2-2 draw at Levante on Sunday as Sevilla were held 1-1 at Celta Vigo.,"A point for both sides means that Atletico lead the Europa League champions by seven points with just two games remaining. Atletico now need three points from their final two fixtures at home to Barcelona and away to Granada to guarantee third place ahead of Valencia and avoid a qualifier for the group stages in August. The La Liga champions started brightly at the Ciutat de Valencia, but couldn't find a way past Diego Marino as Mario Mandzukic's three-month goal drought continued when the Levante 'keeper got down brilliantly to save the Croatian's header nine minutes in. Juanfran then made a fine clearance at the other end to prevent Jose Luis Morales applying the finishing touch to an incisive counter-attack by the hosts. Levante did go in front just after the half-hour mark when Miranda's poor defensive header presented the ball to Ivan Lopez as his low cross left Barral with the easiest of finishes for his 13th goal of the season. Atletico responded immediately as left-back Siqueira swept home his first goal for the club since joining from Benfica last summer from Tiago's cross. The visitors were again the dominant side for much of the second period, but were caught out once more when another simple cross from Lopez found Uche unmarked and the ball ricocheted into the net off the Nigerian after his initial effort had been saved by Jan Oblak. Fernando Torres replaced Mandzukic for the final half hour and provided the finishing touch that the former Bayern striker has lacked recently 11 minutes from time as he rose highest to bullet home Koke's corner. Atletico could have snatched all three points towards the end, but Marino made another fine stop to deny Jose Maria Gimenez as Levante edged closer to sealing their La Liga status for a sixth consecutive season. Sevilla could still qualify directly into the group stages of next season's Champions League themselves should they go onto retain the Europa League. But their hopes of doing so through La Liga took another blow as Celta remained in the fight for a European place of their own. Kevin Gameiro fired the visitors into an early lead with a brilliant finish after a neat one-two with Iago Aspas. However, Santi Mina levelled from the penalty spot after Alejandro Arribas had felled Charles inside the area just before the hour mark. Celta now trail Malaga by three points in the race for seventh place after they edged an Andalusian derby against Almeria 2-1. Villarreal are guaranteed a place in next season's Europa League as Joel Campbell's solitary goal handed them a first victory in 10 league games against Elche."
184,01/05/2015,02:03,Madrid's title aspirations on line in Seville,European champions Real Madrid will need to inflict Sevilla's first home defeat in over 13 months to realistically maintain their bid for the La Liga title when they visit the Sanchez Pizjuan on Saturday.,"Los Blancos trail Barcelona by two points at the top of the table with four games remaining and also have to contend with the daunting trip to Andalucia just four days before they travel to face Juventus in the first leg of their Champions League semi-final. However, Sevilla are also desperate for the points as they battle with Valencia for the fourth Champions League place for next season. ""It will be very difficult, like all the games we have left,"" Madrid captain Iker Casillas admitted. ""Our most important game right now is on Saturday. It is against a very strong team at home, who have been solid all season. Moreover, they are fighting for the Champions League places and are in the semi-finals of the Europa League. ""It will be a great game for the fans, but there are three vital points at stake because we need to win our games and hope Barcelona slip-up."" Madrid should be boosted by the return of Gareth Bale from a calf injury, but Karim Benzema won't be risked ahead of the trip to Turin in midweek. Sevilla beat Madrid at home last season at the beginning of their unbeaten run with Carlos Bacca scoring twice in a 2-1 victory. The Colombian bagged another brace as Sevilla stretched their unbeaten run in all competitions to eight games with a 3-1 win at Eibar on Wednesday and is confident home support can drive them onto another big three points. ""At home we have been playing very well. It is a great game and with our fans there is great excitement,"" said Bacca. ""We are getting closer to our objectives and we need to fight for them. We need to win all the remaining games. At home we beat them last season, I don't see why we can't again."" On paper Barcelona have a far easier task this weekend as they travel to rock bottom Cordoba, who could be mathematically relegated. Cordoba are 11 points from safety having now won in 16 games stretching back to January and their return to the top-flight after a 43-year absence will come to an end unless they pull off a monumental upset at the Nuevo Arcangel. However, Barca will also have Champions League preparations on their minds as they host former boss Pep Guardiola and German champions Bayern Munich on Tuesday. Boss Luis Enrique made four changes for the 6-0 thrashing of Getafe in midweek, but granted the full 90 minutes to his star strike trio of Lionel Messi, Luis Suarez and Neymar as they moved onto a combined 102 goals for the season. Enrique has a fully-fit squad to choose from and defender Marc Bartra hailed the former Barca captain's management of the squad this season to ensure they have come into the decisive part of the campaign as fresh as possible. ""We have worked very well on the physical side of things since pre-season. As well as psychologically because when there are rotations, when you know that at any moment you could play, you are always prepared. ""This is what he has done to ensure now we are in good condition."" Atletico Madrid can strengthen their hold on third place when Athletic Bilbao visit the Vicente Calderon on Saturday. Fernando Torres's winner at Villarreal in midweek ensured Diego Simeone's men remain on course for a direct return to the Champions League next season and the former Liverpool and Chelsea striker could be rewarded with a start ahead of the misfiring Mario Mandzukic.

""The injury will require surgery at a date yet to be confirmed, and he will be out for an estimated time of between six and seven months."" The Europa League holders progressed to the semi-finals of the tournament once more after securing a 2-2 draw in Russia to progress 4-3 on aggregate. Spanish international Vitolo also suffered a hamstring strain, but he is expected to be fit for the first leg of their semi-final at home to Fiorentina on May 7."
186,24/04/2015,12:37,Italian clubs kept apart in Europa League semis,The draw for the semi-finals of the Europa League on Friday kept alive the possibility of an all-Italian final as Serie A sides Napoli and Fiorentina avoided each other.,"Rafa Benitez's Napoli will take on Dnipro of Ukraine while Fiorentina will face holders Sevilla in the semi-finals, with the first legs to be played on Thursday, May 7 and the second legs on Thursday, May 14. Napoli, who are through to their first European semi-final since the side captained by Diego Maradona won the UEFA Cup in 1989, will be favourites to beat a Dnipro outfit appearing in their first ever continental semi-final. Coach Rafa Benitez is looking to win yet another European trophy having led Valencia to the UEFA Cup in 2004 before winning the Champions League with Liverpool a year later and then the Europa League with Chelsea in 2013. Meanwhile, Fiorentina's reward for beating Dynamo Kiev and reaching their first semi-final since the 2008 UEFA Cup is a clash with the holders, with the first leg to come in Spain. Having beaten Benfica on penalties in last year's final in Turin, Sevilla remain on course to repeat their achievement of 2006 and 2007, when they won the UEFA Cup in consecutive years. There has not been an all-Italian European final since AC Milan beat Juventus on penalties to win the Champions League in 2003. However, there were four all-Italian finals in the UEFA Cup in the 1990s. The final will be played in the Polish capital Warsaw on May 27. For the first time, the winners of the Europa League will qualify for next season's Champions League."
187,23/04/2015,23:20,Holders Sevilla through to Europa League semis,Holders Sevilla sealed their place in the semi-finals of the Europa League on Thursday after a dramatic 2-2 draw with Zenit St Petersburg in Russia saw them progress 4-3 on aggregate.,"The Spanish side threw away a commanding lead in the tie by conceding two second-half goals, and the match looked to be heading for extra time until substitute Kevin Gameiro popped up with five minutes remaining. The French striker, whose penalty in the shoot-out against Benfica in last season's final secured the trophy for Unai Emery's side, beat Yuri Lodygin with a crisp strike to silence the Petrovski Stadium and take Sevilla into Friday's draw. Having won 2-1 in the first leg in Spain a week ago, Sevilla were in a fantastic position in the tie after Carlos Bacca converted a penalty in the sixth minute for his 22nd goal of the season after Vitolo went down under the slightest of contact from Luis Neto. Zenit now needed to score twice without reply just to force extra time but they were given hope just after the interval when Jose Rondon netted after Beto fumbled Oleg Shatov's cross. And then Brazil star Hulk squared the tie on aggregate with an incredible strike from 40 yards out wide on the right that hit the underside of the bar and landed just over the line. But Gameiro emerged to send Andre Villas-Boas's Russian Premier League leaders packing from European competition. Italy will have two representatives in the semi-finals after Fiorentina and Napoli both sealed their progress. After scoring a late away goal in Kiev last week to hold Dynamo Kiev to a 1-1 draw, Fiorentina won the return 2-0 against the Ukrainian giants thanks to a goal in each half from Mario Gomez and substitute Juan Manuel Vargas. Vincenzo Montella's side battered the visitors in the opening stages with Gomez having an effort disallowed for offside, Marcos Alonso hitting the bar and Gomez and Mohamed Salah both being denied by Olexandr Shovkovskiy. Dynamo were then reduced to 10 men five minutes before the interval as Dutchman Jeremain Lens was shown a second yellow card after being harshly adjudged to have dived on the edge of the box. Moments after that Gomez diverted a driven ball by Joaquin into the net to score his 40th goal in European competition, one more than his illustrious compatriot Karl-Heinz Rummenigge. Despite their one-man advantage, nerves got the better of Fiorentina in the second half and they had to wait until the fourth minute of added time to make sure of the victory as Peruvian forward Vargas fired home from a tight angle. The Florence outfit are through to a first European semi-final since reaching the last four of the UEFA Cup in 2008 and they are joined by Napoli, whose 2-2 draw at home to Wolfsburg saw them progress 6-3 on aggregate. After a big win in Germany last week, Rafa Benitez's side increased their aggregate lead as Gonzalo Higuain set up Jose Callejon and Dries Mertens to score second-half goals at the San Paolo. Timm Klose and Ivan Perisic scored to earn Wolfsburg a draw on the night and rescue some pride. In Kiev, Dnipro made it through to a first ever European semi-final as a late goal from substitute Yevhen Shakhov sealed a 1-0 win over Club Brugge. After a goalless first leg last week, the tie appeared to be heading for extra time until Shakhov struck in the 82nd minute to inflict a first defeat on the Belgians in 16 games in the competition this season. With Dnipro progressing, Zenit's exit cures something of a headache for UEFA, who have been keeping Russian and Ukrainian sides apart in continental competition ever since the conflict broke out in eastern Ukraine last year."
188,22/04/2015,02:15,Sevilla's road to Warsaw must go through Russia,"Sevilla put their Europa League crown on the line on Thursday with a treacherous trip to Zenit St Petersburg, while two of the other quarter-finals remain on a knife-edge but Napoli are all but qualified after routing Wolfsburg last week.","Sevilla often save their best football for Europe's second-tier competition, having lifted the trophy in 2006 and 2007, as well as last year when they defeated Benfica on penalities. They carry a 2-1 first leg lead into their 4,500km trek to the Baltic after late goals from Carlos Bacca and Denis Suarez overturned a first-half opener from Zenit's Alexander Ryazantsev. But coach Andre Villas-Boas expects the home crowd and his league leaders to make it a difficult night for their visitors. ""What can really help us is the support of the stadium,"" said the former Tottenham handler. ""The atmosphere that the fans are going to create can really encourage the team."" added the 37-year-old Portuguese coach, who won the competition with Porto, when they beat Braga 1-0 in 2011. Zenit, who became the first Russian team to win the competition when they defeated Rangers 2-0 in 2008, will be boosted by the return of captain Miguel Danny, star striker Hulk as well as defenders Domenico Criscito and Igor Smolnikov, who all sat out the match in Spain through suspension. On the down side, Ryazantsev is now suspended as is Argentine defender Ezequiel Garay after both picked up first-leg bookings. ""We have to score,"" said Ryazantsev. ""Sevilla showed that they're really dangerous on the counter-attacks but I think that in St Petersburg they will play a little bit different football. ""Zenit will also change their style. We will have to attack but we can't forget about defending. We have to be very careful."" Bacca, who grabbed the all-important equaliser in the first match, feels Sevilla's love for the competition could have a bearing on the outcome. ""With Sevilla having won it three times, there is a lot of excitement about playing in this tournament,"" he told Uefa.com. ""But we don't want to just play in it - we want to become champions. It's not easy, we know that, but the Europa League is a competition that Sevilla and the Sevilla fans like a lot."" Fiorentina, the 1990 finalists, picked up a priceless injury-time equaliser in their first-leg tie to earn a 1-1 draw against Dynamo Kiev. The Italians, sixth in Serie A, will be hoping the match doesn't go to penalities after they missed their fourth straight spot-kick of the season on Monday in the 1-0 home defeat to Verona. No team in the top five European leagues (England, Spain, Italy, Germany, France) have ever set such an unwanted record. Rafa Benitez's Napoli are firmly on track for the semi-finals after a brace from captain Marek Hamsik paved the way for a surprise 4-1 win over Bundesliga side Wolfsburg in Germany. Benitez is chasing a third trophy in the competition, with his third different club, after guiding Valencia (2004) and Chelsea (2013) to victory. The latter, clinched with a 2-1 win over Benfica in the final in Amsterdam, was one of his final matches in charge of the Londoners, and he faces a similar scenario this season with expectations high that he will leave in the summer even if Napoli lift the trophy. Belgian outsiders Club Brugge, seeking their first European trophy, forced a 0-0 draw at home to Dnipro of Ukraine in their first leg. Brugge are the only unbeaten team left in the tournament, having won 11 and drawn four, while Dnipro have tasted defeat four times, although they have won their last three home matches without conceding a goal. Dnipro have never gone past the quarter-finals of a European competition while Brugge's best continental showing was reaching the 1992 Cup Winners' Cup semi-finals when they went out at the hands of Werder Bremen. The semi-final draw takes place on Friday with the final scheduled for Warsaw on May 27."
189,15/04/2015,02:16,Sevilla face depleted Zenit in Europa League quarters,Holders Sevilla host a Zenit Saint Petersburg side ripped apart by suspensions in the Europa League quarter-final first leg on Thursday.,"Andre Villas-Boas's Russian league leaders travel to Spain missing no fewer than five first team regulars. Defenders Domenico Criscito and Igor Smolnikov, skipper Miguel Danny and Brazilian star striker Hulk are all banned after collecting third bookings in the last 16 return leg against Torino. Villas-Boas's plight is compounded by the absence of Russian international midfielder Viktor Faizulin, recovering from knee surgery. ""We have to think hard (about our line-up on Thursday) since we have four players that are suspended and we have to think about the objective (in that match),"" the Zenit boss said. The 2008 winners face a stiff task against a Sevilla side fresh from holding Barcelona to a 2-2 draw in La Liga at the weekend. That fightback extended their unbeaten run at home to 33 games and ensured they remain just four points adrift of Atletico Madrid in the fight for a return to the Champions League next season. Sevilla, who claimed their third Europa League title when beating Benfica on penalties last year, will fancy their prospects of gaining an edge on Thursday ahead of next month's return leg in Russia. They beat Zenit 5-2 at the same stage in 2006. ""Winning the Europa League for the second successive year will be very complicated,"" said Fernando Navarro, the Sevilla defender and Spanish Euro 2008 winner. Ukraine are doubly represented in the last eight by Dynamo Kiev, who ended Premier League club Everton's ambitions in the last 16, and Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk. Dnipro are the surprise packages this season, stunning Dutch giants Ajax to set up a last eight clash with Club Brugge of Belgium. Dnipro owe their continued presence in the competition to the away goals rule after their last 16 tie with Ajax ended 2-2 on aggregate. Dnipro coach Myron Markevych insisted his team must show Brugge plenty of respect after they were drawn against the Belgian outsiders. ""It's ridiculous to say that Brugge is a good draw for us. This is a very strong, classy team that plays great attacking football and got past Besiktas so easily, which says a lot,"" said the coach. Dynamo Kiev have been ordered by UEFA to close part of their stadium for Fiorentina's visit after racist behaviour by their fans towards Everton players last month. The last eight line-up is completed by Wolfsburg, who brushed aside Inter Milan last month to set up a meeting on Thursday with another Serie A outfit, Rafael Benitez's Napoli. The 2009 German champions enjoyed their best run in the competition in 2010, when they reached the quarter-finals, while Napoli memorably won the former UEFA Cup in 1989 when Diego Maradona inspired them to a 5-4 aggregate victory over Stuttgart. The quarter-final second legs will be played on April 23, with the final in Warsaw on May 27.

The two sides had met in the last 16 of the Europa League with the holders progressing to the last eight 5-2 on aggregate. However, it was Villarreal who enjoyed much the better of the opening 45 minutes on Sunday with Moi Gomez striking the bar and Nico Pareja clearing on-loan Arsenal forward Joel Campbell's goalbound shot off the line. Yet, as in their European meetings, it was Sevilla who were more deadly in front of goal and went in front five minutes into the second-half as Coke collected Diogo Figueiras's pass and slotted in off the far post. Vitolo then displayed the quality finishing that has caught Vicente del Bosque's eye with a cushioned volley past Sergio Asenjo from Coke's deflected cross."

193,12/03/2015,22:52,"Vitolo's 13sec goal, a new Europa record",Victor Machin 'Vitolo' set a new Europa League fastest goalscoring record when he put Sevilla into a 13 second lead against Villarreal on Thursday.,"The previous quickest goal in the competition belonged to Argentina's Ismael Blanco, who scored after 19sec for AEK Athens against BATE Borisov in November, 2009. History was made in this last 16 first leg when the ball was lofted forward from kick-off, with Kevin Gameiro passing to Vitolo who controlled it with his body before firing past Villarreal keeper Sergio Asenjo. The holder of the fastest goal in any European competition belongs to Roy Makaay, the Dutch player who scored after 12sec for Bayern Munich against Real Madrid in the Champions League in 2006/2007."
194,22/02/2015,14:06,Sociedad beat Sevilla in seven-goal thriller,David Moyes's Real Sociedad struck twice in the final 10 minutes to come from behind and beat Sevilla 4-3 in a thrilling match on Sunday.,"The hosts had got off to an ideal start as Imanol Agirretxe slotted home the opener after 16 minutes, but Timothee Kolodziejczak levelled for the Europa League holders before the break. Sociedad were then gifted a soft penalty at the start of the second period, which Xabi Prieto converted, but Sevilla responded once more when their top scorer Carlos flicked home Ever Banega's free-kick. Sevilla then looked set to go on and claim a vital three points in their battle for a return to Champions League football next season when Kevin Gameiro scored from the spot after a handball by Inigo Martinez inside the area. However, there was a final twist as Sociedad equalised when the ball ricocheted into the net off the unfortunate Arribas from Gonzalo Castro's initial effort. And Moyes' men then grabbed the winner when Prieto flicked home a corner at the near post as the game entered stoppage time. Defeat means Sevilla still trail Valencia by five points in the fight for fourth place, while Sociedad jump three places to 10th and are now eight points clear of the relegation zone."

196,10/02/2015,14:31,Sevilla suffer quadruple injury blow,"Europa League holders Sevilla will be deprived of the services of Beto, Stephane Mbia, Iago Aspas and Coke for the coming weeks, the club confirmed on Tuesday.","Portuguese international goalkeeper Beto will not require surgery on a shoulder injury he suffered when Karim Benzema crashed into him during his side's 2-1 defeat to Real Madrid last week. However, he will still be sidelined for eight weeks meaning he will miss Sevilla's return to Europa League action against Borussia Monchengladbach later this month, as well as La Liga games against Atletico Madrid and Barcelona. Mbia and Coke suffered hamstring injuries in another 2-1 reverse at Getafe on Sunday and will be out for up to three weeks and a month respectively. Meanwhile, on-loan Liverpool striker Aspas has a groin problem that will also keep him out for up to four weeks."
197,08/02/2015,19:00,Sevilla slump to defeat at Getafe,Sevilla blew the chance to extend their advantage over Valencia in fourth as Pedro Leon's late winner handed Getafe a 2-1 victory on Sunday.,"The hosts went in front on the half hour mark when former Swansea City striker Alvaro Vazquez was brought down by Diogo Figueras inside the area and he picked himself up to dispatch the resulting penalty. Sevilla enjoyed the majority of possession after the break, but it took a wonder strike from Polish international Grzegorz Krychowiak to bring them level as he fired in his first La Liga goal from 20 yards. However, Getafe secured a vital three points in their battle to avoid the drop five minutes from time when Leon forced the ball home from close range after Sergio Rico had made a double save from Fredy Hinestroza and Diego Castro. A second defeat in four days for Sevilla means Valencia can move back into the top four should they avoid defeat away at Espanyol later on Sunday. Meanwhile, Barcelona can move to within a point of Real Madrid at the top with victory at Athletic Bilbao after the European champions were thrashed 4-0 by Atletico Madrid on Saturday."
198,06/02/2015,15:49,Sevilla 'keeper Beto out for up to three months,"Sevilla have been dealt a major blow after goalkeeper Beto was ruled out for up to three months with a shoulder injury, the club announced Friday.","The Portuguese international, 32, who has won 10 caps for his country, collided heavily with Real Madrid's French striker Karim Benzema during their 2-1 midweek defeat. ""It was diagnosed that FC Sevilla goalkeeper Beto is suffering from a dislocated shoulder and the situation probably requires surgery which will mean an minimum absence of ten weeks."" read a club statement. The player, who needed lengthy treatment, was eventually taken off on a stretcher while Benzema escaped without a yellow card for the incident. Sevilla are currently fourth in La Liga, 12 points behind Real Madrid, and continue their Europa League defence when they face Germany's Borussia Moenchengladbach in the last-32 in two weeks' time."
199,22/01/2015,23:57,Espanyol on verge of Cup semis after Sevilla win,Espanyol have one foot in the semi-finals of the Copa del Rey after a surprise 3-1 win over Europa League holders Sevilla on Thursday.,"Sevilla came into the game on an unbeaten 10-game run that had seen them rise to fourth in La Liga, but coach Unai Emery paid for making a number of changes as Espanyol throughly merited their win. Ecuadorian striker Felipe Caicedo continued his fine recent form with a sumptuous strike into the top corner to give the Catalans an early lead. Captain Sergio Garcia then converted from the penalty spot after Alejandro Arribas had been harshly adjudged to have handled inside his own area 12 minutes from time. Moments later Garcia turned provider as Lucas Vazquez rounded off a swift counter-attack with a precise low finish. However, Sevilla's top scorer Carlos Bacca came of the bench to give the Andalusians hope for the return leg next Thursday when he volleyed home in stoppage time. The winners of the tie will face Malaga or Athletic Bilbao, who played out a 0-0 draw in their first leg on Wednesday, in the last four. Meanwhile, on the other side of the draw, Barcelona and Villarreal take 1-0 leads into the return leg against Atletico Madrid and Getafe respectively."
200,10/12/2014,02:29,Holders look to secure berth in Europa League last 32,Trophy holders Sevilla are among the clubs looking to claim one of the 10 berths still up for grabs in the Europa League knockout stage in Thursday's final round of group games.,"The Spanish side, who beat Benfica on penalties in last season's final in Turin, host Rijeka of Croatia needing just a point to progress, while their visitors have to win to advance from Group G alongside Dutch giants Feyenoord. However, coach Unai Emery has urged his side, who are currently in fourth place in La Liga, to make sure they win the game. ""Our objective is to win the game and be in the hat for the last 32,"" Emery wrote on his personal website. ""We feel that we are strong in our own stadium and we hope to maintain that by carefully preparing a game in which (Rijeka) can't afford to settle for a draw."" Elsewhere, Borussia Moenchengladbach and Villarreal will advance from Group A by avoiding defeat in their games, while Qarabag can become the first club from Azerbaijan to survive in a major European competition into the spring if they can win at home to Italian giants Inter, who are already certain to win Group F. ""We will be playing in front of our fans and this sometimes can add to the pressure,"" Qarabag captain Rashad F Sadygov told UEFA.com, mindful of the fact that a slip-up could see either Saint-Etienne or Dnipro of Ukraine take advantage. ""We have a huge responsibility and just can't let them down. So we have to be patient and hope God will help us."" Among the other decisive encounters, Lille welcome Bundesliga high-flyers Wolfsburg to northern France in a direct shoot-out to decide who progresses from Group H along with Everton. While Wolfsburg can afford to settle for a draw, Lille have to win, something they have yet to do in the group. Everton are already certain to progress as group winners, which means they will be seeded in next Monday's draw for the last 32 along with the four third-placed teams with the best records in the Champions League group stage. Given their current travails in the Premier League, that means Toffees manager Roberto Martinez will shuffle his pack when already-eliminated Krasnodar visit Goodison Park, and Ghanaian winger Christian Atsu is one of those looking to get a chance. ""It's been quite difficult since I came here,"" Atsu, who has started just three games since joining on loan from Chelsea, told evertontv. ""I'm working hard for the team and I believe the fans haven't seen the best of me yet."" Of the game, the 22-year-old added: ""We have a very good team spirit and we want to win every game. We are not treating it like we have qualified - we are not going out to relax."" Scottish champions Celtic are also already through, although Ronny Deila's side know they will finish second in Group D to Salzburg, rendering their trip to play Dinamo Zagreb in Croatia meaningless. ""The pressure will be off and the gaffer might change the team but we don't want to let the fans down over there,"" said Celtic's Irish forward Anthony Stokes, scorer of his team's winning goal in the weekend Premiership win at Motherwell. Tottenham Hotspur are also through, although in their case first place in Group C is still up for grabs as they go to Istanbul to face Besiktas. A draw will be enough for Spurs to clinch top spot, but a defeat would see them leapfrogged by the current Turkish league leaders, who reports suggest may be forced to do without leading scorer Demba Ba due to a toe injury."
201,14/09/2014,19:16,"Valencia, Sevilla maintain strong starts",Valencia and Sevilla continued their unbeaten starts to the Spanish season to move within two points of leaders Barcelona thanks to victories over Espanyol and Getafe respectively on Sunday.,"Despite missing their reported 28 million-euro ($36 million, £22.3 million) deadline day capture from Manchester City, Alvaro Negredo, due to a foot injury, Valencia were still too good for the Catalans as Pablo Piatti fired them into a seventh-minute lead. Dani Parejo then doubled the hosts' advantage just after the hour mark and Paco Alcacer rounded off his fine week after scoring on his competitive international debut for Spain against Macedonia when he made it 3-0 17 minutes from time. A Sergio Garcia penalty in stoppage time was all Espanyol could muster as they remain without a win so far this season. Sevilla also moved onto seven points from three games with a 2-0 win over Getafe at the Sanchez Pizjuan. Colombian international Carlos Bacca converted from the penalty spot a minute before half-time and Aleix Vidal sealed the three points late on. Valencia sit second on goal difference ahead of Sevilla with champions Atletico Madrid in fourth also just two points adrift of Barcelona. Granada also remain unbeaten on five points after they played out a 0-0 draw at home to Villarreal. And Elche edged Rayo Vallecano 3-2 in the day's early game to move into the top half of the table with their first victory of the new campaign."
202,29/08/2014,20:56,Sevilla recruit French defender Kolodziejczak,"French left-back Timothee Kolodziejczak, 22, has joined Spanish side Sevilla from Nice on a four-year deal, the two clubs announced on Friday.","The official fee for the former Lyon player is undisclosed, but sources close to the deal say Sevilla have paid four million euros ($5.25m) to buy out the remaining two years of his contract. Kolodziejczak had been out of favour at Nice ever since a proposed transfer to English side West Ham United fell through in July. Sevilla, who recently signed another French left-back in Benoit Tremoulinas from Dynamo Kiev, had been looking to strengthen their back line after the sale of Federico Fazio to Tottenham Hotspur."
203,29/08/2014,16:55,"Sevilla, Everton get tricky Europa League draws","Spanish holders Sevilla and English side Everton have been handed tricky ties in the draw for the UEFA Europa League group stage, made in Monaco on Friday.","Sevilla, bidding for a record fourth title in the second-tier European competition, won last season by beating Benfica on penalties in the final in Turin. But in their path this time are Standard Liege of Belgium and Dutch two-time UEFA Cup winners Feyenoord, in a Group G which also includes Croatian minnows Rijeka. Sevilla coach Unai Emery descibed the draw as ""good, nice and hard."" ""There was very good teams, top teams,"" he continued. ""Who says we are favourites? We're challengers. Any of the four can get to the next phase,"" added Emery. English side Everton have been drawn in Group H alongside Wolfsburg of Germany, French side Lille and Turkish outfit Krasnodar, who advanced past Real Sociedad in the play-off round. However, with Samuel Eto'o and Romelu Lukaku in their strike force, Everton seem well armed up front. Wolfsburg also have several top-class players such as Ivica Olic, Josuha Guilavogui, Kevin De Bruyne and Brazilian Luiz Gustavo. Eliminated by Porto in the Champions League play-offs, Lille can count on their tight defence which helped them to third in Ligue 1 last season. Lille coach Rene Girard was anticipating a tough group. ""It is an extremely complicated draw. It is tough as Monaco's Champions League group (featuring Bayer Leverkusen, Zenit St Petersburg, Benfica). That gives you an idea of the size of the task,"" he said. ""Playing in Germany or England for example will be great challenges."" In Group C, English side Tottenham Hotspur are favourites but face three tough trips to Besiktas in Turkey, Serbian side Partizan Belgrade and Greek outfit Asteras Tripolis. Scottish champions Celtic avoided meeting Legia Warsaw, the side who they controversially beat in Champions League qualifying due to a technicality, and are in Group D alongside Salzburg, Dinamo Zagreb and Astra Giurgiu of Romania, conquerors of Lyon in the play-offs. Celtic manager Ronny Deila told UEFA.com: ""It's an interesting group. There are good teams but we are going to fight to go through. We are disappointed we didn't make the Champions League but we have to close this chapter for this year and remember the feeling we had. ""We have to work really hard, learn from our defeats and use that experience when we hopefully get in that situation again next year."" In Group A the battles should be between Villarreal and Borussia Moenchengladbach, while Group E is all to play for between PSV Eindhoven, Panathinaïkos, Dynamo Moscow and outsider Estoril. The four Italian clubs all drew groups which they are capable of advancing through, even if Inter Milan must be wary of Dnipropetrovsk and Saint-Etienne in their Group F which also includes first-timers Qarabag of Azerbaijan. ""Inter isn't the only difficulty in this group,"" Saint-Etienne sporting coordinator Dominique Rocheteau said. ""Going to play in Ukraine is never easy."" Napoli should have an easier time against Sparta Prague, Swiss side Young Boys and Slovan Bratislava in Group I, as should Fiorentina, who are up against Greek side PAOK in Group K, which also includes Guingamp of France and Belarussian side Dynamo Minsk. Torino play Copenhagen, Club Brugge and Helsinki in Group B. The six matches will take place on September 18, October 2 and 23, November 6 and 27 and December 11. The top two from each group will qualify for the last 32 where they will be joined by the third-placed finisher from the Champions League group stages. The final takes place in Warsaw on May 27 with this season's winners qualifying for next year's Champions League for the first time."
204,16/08/2014,20:16,Liverpool complete signing of Moreno,"Liverpool have completed the signing of 22-year-old Spanish left-back Alberto Moreno from Europa League champions Sevilla, the Premier League club announced on Saturday.","Liverpool did not disclose either the length of Moreno's contract or how much they paid to sign him, but British press reports put the transfer fee at around £12 million ($20.2 million, 15.1 million euros). ""In my view, Liverpool are the best club in England and I couldn't waste an opportunity to come and play for them,"" Moreno told the club website. The Spain international completed the formalities of his move at Liverpool's Melwood training base, but he has not signed in time to feature in their Premier League opener at home to Southampton on Sunday. ""I spoke with (former Liverpool players) Xabi Alonso, Pepe Reina and Alvaro Arbeloa and they told me this is a spectacular club whose fans follow it in a very special way,"" Moreno added. ""They all told me I can grow a lot here as a footballer as this is a massive club. I'm very happy to be joining a club as big as Liverpool. I hope to give my best and do all I can to help."" Moreno, who bade a tearful farewell to Sevilla's fans after their 2-0 loss to Real Madrid in the UEFA Super Cup in Cardiff on Tuesday, becomes Liverpool's eighth close-season signing. The Seville-born defender graduated from Sevilla's youth academy and made his first-team debut in April 2012. He has won three caps for Spain, but was not included in their World Cup squad. He will compete with 28-year-old compatriot Jose Enrique and home-grown academy graduate Jon Flanagan for a place on the left flank of manager Brendan Rodgers's defence."
205,14/08/2014,23:05,Barcelona loan Deulofeu to Sevilla,"Barcelona starlet Gerard Deulofeu is set to join Sevilla on a season-long loan, the two clubs announced on Thursday evening.","Sevilla, who lost the UEFA Super Cup to Real Madrid on Tuesday, said that they had reached ""an agreement in principle"" to sign the 20-year-old, adding that the deal would be concluded once the player has undergone a medical on Monday. Barcelona added that the move was ""designed to maximise the participation and optimise the sporting development of the player."" Deulofeu spent last season on loan in England with Everton, whose manager Roberto Martinez had been keen to bring the player back for a second campaign at Goodison Park. However, the Catalans, who have a new coach in Luis Enrique, had initially turned down any chance of loaning Deulofeu out again, only to change their mind. Sevilla have already signed former Manchester City midfielder Denis Suarez from Barcelona this summer on a two-year loan."
206,12/08/2014,22:40,Ronaldo brace gives Real Madrid Super Cup,Cristiano Ronaldo upstaged new team-mates Toni Kroos and James Rodriguez and homecoming hero Gareth Bale as Real Madrid beat Sevilla 2-0 in Cardiff on Tuesday to win the UEFA Super Cup.,"World Cup stars Kroos and Rodriguez were making their Madrid debuts, while Bale was returning to his hometown, but it was Ronaldo, characteristically, who hogged the spotlight with a brace in the Welsh capital. The Portugal captain claimed a 30th-minute opener from Bale's cross and then slammed home a second goal shortly after half-time to earn the European champions what could be the first of six trophies this season. While 80-million-euro ($108 million) new recruit Rodriguez had a modest debut, Madrid's new-look attack -- which cost roughly 310 million euros to assemble -- showed ominous flashes of quality. Victory gave Madrid only their second Super Cup, after a maiden triumph in 2002, and enabled Carlo Ancelotti's side to avenge a costly 2-1 loss at the hands of Europa League winners Sevilla in La Liga last season. While Ancelotti named both Kroos and Rodriguez in his starting XI, Sevilla left-back Alberto Moreno was omitted from his side's match-day squad amid reports he is on the verge of joining Liverpool. With Kroos sitting in front of the back four and Rodriguez to his left in a 4-3-3 shape, Madrid quickly assumed control of the game at the Cardiff City Stadium. Bale and then Ronaldo, with a free-kick, saw efforts deflected narrowly off-target, before Bale's outside-of-the-foot volley from a Rodriguez left-wing cross was blocked by a defender. A misplaced pass by Daniel Carvajal gave Sevilla winger Vitolo a chance to shoot at goal, obliging Iker Casillas to save at his near post, but Madrid were soon back on the front foot. After Federico Fazio headed a deflected cross from Fabio Coentrao off his own line and Sevilla goalkeeper Beto blocked sharply from Ronaldo, Madrid's lavishly assembled forward line clicked into gear for what their fans hope will be the first goal of many. When a Sevilla attack broke down, Ronaldo flashed a pass inside to Rodriguez, who immediately sprayed the ball wide to Bale on the left flank. The Cardiff-born Welshman took a touch before sending a fine, searching cross towards the back post, where Ronaldo powered in to volley home. Moments later, a shanked clearance from Rodriguez meant that Casillas had to save from Daniel Carrico, but Madrid were good value for their half-time lead. Ronaldo doubled his side's lead, and his personal tally, four minutes into the second period, gathering a pass from Karim Benzema and walloping a left-foot shot past international colleague Beto. Beto prevented Madrid from extending their lead by clawing away a shot from Benzema and then brilliantly blocking a crisp strike by Colombia star Rodriguez, who made way for Isco with 18 minutes to play. Beto also produced a late flying save to thwart Bale, who was unable to crown his return to Cardiff with a goal, but who has now won three titles in his first 12 months at Madrid."
207,11/08/2014,20:37,"Kroos and Rodriguez to start, says Ancelotti","Real Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti confirmed on Monday that he will unleash his big guns, including new signings Toni Kroos and James Rodriguez, in Tuesday's UEFA Super Cup against Sevilla.","The two midfielders only started training on August 5 after starring at the World Cup -- Rodriguez for Colombia, Kroos for champions Germany -- but Ancelotti said that both would start the match in Cardiff. Asked if the two players would feature from kick-off, Ancelotti replied: ""Yes, they will both be in the line-up."" With Xabi Alonso suspended, Kroos is expected to partner Luka Modric in central midfield for the European champions, with Rodriguez playing at number 10. Ancelotti said that reigning Ballon d'Or-winner Cristiano Ronaldo was also in line to feature despite struggling with a knee problem during the World Cup. ""Cristiano is well,"" the Italian told a pre-game media conference at the Cardiff City Stadium. ""He has no problem. He's worked with the others at maximum intensity and I believe he's in good physical condition. ""He's participated in everything and is ready to play this match. He's facing this season with a positive spirit."" Welsh forward Gareth Bale is also expected to start on his return to his home-town, although Ancelotti could not resist making a joke at the expense of the local media. ""I don't know if he's going to play, because everyone's saying, 'He's back home, he's back home,'"" Ancelotti said. ""It could be strange if he starts on the bench!"""
208,11/08/2014,18:42,More to Madrid than Rodriguez,Sevilla coach Unai Emery warned his players on Monday not to fixate on Real Madrid's star signings James Rodriguez and Toni Kroos in Tuesday's UEFA Super Cup in Cardiff.,"The midfield pair joined Madrid after shining at the World Cup -- Rodriguez for quarter-finalists Colombia, Kroos for champions Germany -- and are both in line to make their debuts in the Welsh capital. The first sight of 80-million-euro ($108 million) playmaker Rodriguez in a Madrid shirt is particularly keenly anticipated, but Emery knows that there is much more to the European champions than their two new recruits. ""Of course we've tried to think about the kind of line-up they might come up with, but we're very prepared regardless of who will be in their line-up,"" he told a pre-match press conference at the Cardiff City Stadium. ""The only handicap that might play either for or against us is the fact that Kroos and James haven't yet played with Real Madrid. ""It will be the very first time they play with Real Madrid and the very first time we'll see them. But we can't just prepare for them. We have to see what the whole line-up will look like. ""Of course it's true they're players from the highest level, players of the highest rank both in physical, technical and tactical terms. ""They've had little previous training, but they know how to give their best even in these circumstances."" While Madrid will start as favourites, Sevilla won 2-1 when the sides last met in March and goalkeeper Beto says that his team can also take heart from their victory over Benfica in last season's Europa League final. ""The most important thing we have to do is really enjoy the match, which is a very special, very unique moment and a first for many of our players,"" he said. ""It's the fruit of all our hard work last year. It's the culmination of that and we should enjoy it. We have to believe in our quality and everything that brought us here."" The Super Cup is contested once a year by the winners of the previous season's Champions League and Europa League."
