0,24/01/2021,23:58,Lyon crush Saint-Etienne to stay in touch at the top,Marcelo and Tino Kadewere kept Lyon in touch with Ligue 1's pace-setters on Sunday after they scored twice in a 5-0 derby thumping of a Saint-Etienne side missing a host of players to the coronavirus.,"Rudi Garcia's team stay two points behind leaders Paris Saint-Germain and Lille, who earlier won 1-0 at Rennes, after a comfortable victory at the Stade Geoffroy-Guichard thanks to two carbon copy headers from Brazilian Marcelo, another brace from Kadewere and a Denis Bouanga own goal. The win put Lyon back on track after falling at home to Metz last weekend but came against a Saint-Etienne team missing seven players following a Covid-19 outbreak at the club which also led to president Roland Romeyer testing positive. Ten-time French champions Saint-Etienne sit 16th after the defeat, only four points above the relegation zone after their miserable run of form was extended to just one win in their last 18 matches. ""This might have been our most complete performance. We could have scored more but winning a derby 5-0 is not something that comes every day,"" said Garcia. Kadewere put the away side in the lead in the 16th minute when a Memphis Depay corner fell to the Zimbabwean, who only had to tap home to open the scoring. Mattia De Sciglio almost doubled Lyon's lead when he smacked a long-range shot against the bar seven minutes later, but it didn't take too for the deserved second goal to arrive. Leo Dubois whipped in a superb free-kick into the Saint-Etienne area in the 36th minute which allowed Marcelo to attack the ball aggressively and head in his first goal of the season. Marcelo repeated the trick just before the hour mark when he met another perfect Dubois cross to crash in the third, before Kadewere claimed his ninth of the campaign in the 68th minute after collecting a pass from Memphis Depay. Bouanga completed the home side's misery by nodding Depay's free-kick into his own net with eight minutes remaining. ""It is difficult to accept, we're angry with ourselves for making it so easy for them,"" said Saint-Etienne coach Claude Puel. ""Even with the situation we were in we believed but we were very quickly disillusioned because we were so sloppy both defensively and going forward."" Earlier, Jonathan David made sure that Lille stayed level on 45 points with PSG by scoring the only goal in their 1-0 win at Rennes. David pounced in the 16th minute when Yusuf Yazici's corner was palmed out to him by Rennes goalkeeper Romain Salin, the Canada forward lashing home. The 21-year-old's fourth league goal of the season was his second winner in as many weeks after striking in injury time against Reims last time out. His strike gave Christophe Galtier's Lille their third win in a row and handed Rennes, who are fifth on 36 points, their first defeat in eight matches. ""It was a very important win,"" said Galtier. ""I don't think we are really rivals to PSG, given the quality of their squad... but we're going to fight."" Bordeaux sit in seventh on 32 points after an early brace from South Korea striker Hwang Ui-Jo powered them to a 2-1 home win over Angers. Raymond Domenech is still waiting for his first win as Nantes coach after falling to his first defeat with his new club, 2-0 at Metz. Nantes sit a point behind Saint-Etienne in 17th after a 12th successive match without a win, a defeat which came after former France coach Domenech had led them to three straight draws. ""You can't play with your hands in your pockets,"" said the 69-year-old. ""We are in a tough situation now, and the players need to know that."""
1,18/01/2021,13:46,"Messi sees red, 'fearful' Juventus, PSG back top: Talking points from around Europe","Frustration got the better of Lionel Messi as he saw red in the Spanish Super Cup final, while Inter dealt a major blow to Juventus's Serie A title hopes but Paris Saint-Germain are back on top in France.","AFP Sport rounds up some of the main talking points from across the continent: Lionel Messi was sent off for the first time in 753 appearances for Barcelona at the end of his side's 3-2 extra-time defeat by Athletic Bilbao in the Spanish Super Cup final in Seville, after lashing out at Asier Villalibre in a moment that seemed to encapsulate his recent frustration with his boyhood club. Messi had twice been shown a red card playing for Argentina, including at the 2019 Copa America, but never in more than 16 years with Barcelona, before Sunday. His dismissal came right at the end of extra time, after Athletic had scored a late equaliser to force the additional 30 minutes and then a stunning Inaki Williams strike gave the Basques a 3-2 win and their second Super Cup in six years. Barcelona had hoped to win their first trophy under Ronald Koeman and Messi had been in good form, with four goals in his club's previous two league games. ""Do I excuse him? I'd need to see it again,"" said Koeman of the incident. Andrea Pirlo's hopes of leading Juventus to a 10th straight Serie A title in his first season as a coach took a major knock as the reigning champions lost 2-0 away to Inter, one of the clubs he represented as a player. Arturo Vidal -- a former teammate of Pirlo's at Juve -- and Nicolo Barella scored the goals as Inter, coached by ex-Juventus boss Antonio Conte, moved level on points with leaders AC Milan, who have a game in hand to play on Monday. Juve, who had been on their best run of the season with three straight league wins, are now seven points off top spot. ""We couldn't have put in a worse performance than this,"" said Pirlo, who said his side were ""fearful"" and too defensive. They now play Napoli in the delayed Italian Super Cup on Wednesday. Paris Saint-Germain were without their new coach Mauricio Pochettino for their game at Angers after the Argentine tested positive for Covid-19. But, three days after winning his first trophy in management in the Champions Trophy against Marseille, he watched from afar as PSG ground out a 1-0 win that took them back to the top of Ligue 1. Layvin Kurzawa's goal made the difference, before former leaders Lyon saw their 16-game unbeaten run ended in dramatic fashion in a 1-0 home defeat against Metz. They were denied a late opener by a marginal offside call, and conceded in the 90th minute to Aaron Leya Iseka. Lyon are now third, two points off PSG who lead from Lille on goal difference. Lille beat Reims 2-1 with a last-minute Jonathan David winner. Bayern Munich coach Hansi Flick was facing up to his first mini-crisis in charge as his side lost 3-2 at Borussia Moenchengladbach last weekend and then went out of the German Cup on penalties to second-tier Holstein Kiel. However they got back on track as Thomas Mueller's strike secured a 2-1 win over Freiburg on Sunday to move Bayern four points clear at the top of the Bundesliga from RB Leipzig, who drew 2-2 at Wolfsburg. With Bayer Leverkusen and Borussia Dortmund slipping up as well, it seems doubtful that any of their rivals have the consistency needed to stop Bayern winning a ninth straight title, although there is still a long way to go. Benfica and Porto are Portugal's two most successful clubs and between them have won each of the last 18 league titles. On Friday they played out a 1-1 draw at the Estadio do Dragao, with Moussa Marega cancelling out Alex Grimaldo's opener before the Iranian Mehdi Taremi was sent off for Porto. It was a result that left the two teams level on 32 points from 14 games, and perhaps the big winners were Sporting. Looking for their first title since 2002, they stay four points clear and unbeaten, although they were held 1-1 at home by mid-table Rio Ave. Sporting are due to face Benfica later this month."
2,17/01/2021,23:44,Metz end Lyon's run as PSG take Ligue 1 lead,Lyon slumped to a shock 1-0 home defeat to Metz on Sunday that ended a long unbeaten run and allowed Paris Saint-Germain to stay top of Ligue 1.,"Rudi Garcia's side had come into Sunday's late match on the back of 16 league games without defeat, knowing that a win would have put them back in the lead of France's top flight. However Aaron Leya Iseka struck in the final minute to snatch the points for resilient Metz, who had to withstand a second-half onslaught before finally prevailing and moving ninth. ""We pushed, they pushed, and we were rewarded for our efforts. We knew that we would have little of the ball and that we would have to counter well, and that's what we did,"" said Belgian Leya Iseka. The loss leaves Lyon third, two points behind PSG and Lille, whose own late goal from Jonathan David secured a 2-1 win over Reims. Lyon should have taken the lead six minutes before the break when Karl Toko Ekambi was fed by Tintotenda Kadewere on a breakaway attack. Cameroonian Ekambi, who had forced a good save from Alexandre Oukidja three minutes earlier, successfully cut inside to fashion himself a shooting opportunity but could only blast over. Three minutes later Metz twice came close to taking a shock lead, first hitting the post following a Farid Boulaya cross before Marcelo charged back to block Lamine Gueye's shot on the line. With 16 minutes remaining Ekambi slammed home what he thought was the opener when the ball fell to him after fine play between Memphis Depay and Thiago Mendes. However after a long VAR review the goal was ruled out for Houssem Aouar straying offside when Mendes shot and then pressuring Metz defender Fabien Centonze, who had nodded the ball out to Ekambi. Islam Slimani had the perfect chance to win the match with seven minutes left of his Lyon debut but he shanked his shot, and Oukidja then did brilliant to keep out Aouar's close range effort after fine work from Memphis Depay. That allowed Leya Iseka to claim a shock win for Metz. Earlier David pounced in the first minute of stoppage for Lille to tap home after Xeka's powerful low drive was spilled by Reims goalkeeper Predrag Rajkovic to put Lille on 42 points, equal with champions PSG. Jonathan Bamba's long-range leveller two minutes after the break gave Lille a chance to snatch the win after Arber Zeneli had given Reims a 35th-minute lead with a cross that bamboozled home stopper Mike Maignan. Monaco are six points off the lead in fourth after Wissam Ben Yedder's brace gave them a 3-2 win over Montpellier on Friday. The Principality club are level on 36 points with fifth-placed Rennes, who earlier on Sunday fought back from going a goal down after just three minutes at Brest to win 2-1. Saint-Etienne are just four points above the relegation zone after a 1-0 defeat at Strasbourg. The 10-time French champions are 16th and winless in five league matches thanks in part to a missed 10th-minute penalty from Ryad Boudebouz. Ludovic Ajorque scored the winner for the team from Alsace just before the half-hour mark. Nantes are hovering above the drop zone after drawing 1-1 at home with Lens, with Gael Kakuta's 81st-minute leveller for the away side denying Raymond Domenech a first win in charge of the hosts. The former France coach has guided Nantes to three straight draws since his much-derided appointment last month, with his team battling a run of games without a win that stretches back to early November. Bordeaux strolled to a thumping 3-0 win at Nice, who are also without a win in five."
3,19/12/2020,23:47,Kadewere helps 'magnificent' Lyon go top of Ligue 1,Lyon climbed to the top of Ligue 1 as Zimbabwe attacker Tino Kadewere scored a goal and set up another in a 4-1 win at Nice on Saturday.,"Kadewere made an impact either side of half-time to move his side a point above Lille who entertain third-placed Paris Saint-Germain on Sunday. ""We understand each other on the field when we play together,"" he told Canal+ of his teammates. ""If you play with players like my teammates it's magnificent, we have a lot of good players. ""We need to work further to finish the season with a lot of points to get back to the Champions League."" The visitors' boss Rudi Garcia handed Belgium defender Jason Denayer his 100th Lyon appearance as Memphis Depay returned to the starting line-up after scoring off the bench in the midweek draw with Brest. Nice attacker Jeff Reine-Adelaide was ineligible for the fixture against his parent club as Alexis Claude-Maurice came into Adrian Ursea's side on the right wing. Depay opened the scoring just after the half-hour mark with a 'Panenka' penalty before Kadewere took his tally for the season to six goals on 39 minutes. He intercepted a Hicham Boudaoui pass and beat home goalkeeper Walter Benitez with ease. Kadewere turned provider in the 63rd minute as he set up Cameroon striker Karl Toko Ekambi with a squared pass into the box. The three points were secured with less than 30 minutes to go as France playmaker Houssem Aouar fired home from close range for his first goal since late October. Earlier, Andre Villas-Boas said Marseille's 1-1 draw with Reims was a ""missed opportunity"" as they failed to move into the top three for the first time this season. Japan's Yuto Nagatomo scored an own goal before Florian Thauvin grabbed an equaliser at the Stade Velodrome. Villas-Boas' men, who lost to Rennes on Wednesday when Pape Gueye was sent off, stay fourth in the table, five points behind leaders Lyon, albeit with at least one game in hand on all their title rivals. ""It's a missed opportunity and I didn't expect it after a good performance when it was 11 v 11 at Rennes,"" the former Chelsea and Tottenham boss said. ""It's a blow and we were very disappointed in the changing room."" Opa Nguette and Farid Boulaya scored in Metz's 2-0 win over Lens to send their side up to eighth."
4,14/12/2020,16:25,Neymar says ankle injury 'could have been worse',Brazilian star Neymar gave fans a reassuring message on Monday after undergoing tests on the ankle he injured in Paris Saint-Germain's 1-0 Ligue 1 defeat to Lyon at the weekend.,"Neymar left the field on a stretcher in apparent agony on Sunday but on Instagram he said: ""It could have been worse."" PSG had earlier said ""the clinical opinion following a left ankle sprain sustained last night, is reassuring."" ""These tears, it's the pain, the fear, the worry, the surgeries, the crutches and other bad memories,"" Neymar wrote on his Instagram story alongside a picture of him in tears clutching his ankle. It was a reference to previous injuries he has suffered -- notably twice breaking his foot -- since joining the French champions in 2017. ""It could have been worse, but once again, God saved me from something serious,"" added Neymar. ""I'm going to recover and return as soon as possible."" The announcement is positive news for PSG after a bad night on Sunday in which they lost top spot in Ligue 1 to Lille following a 1-0 home defeat to Lyon, who also leapfrogged the capital club into second place. Lyon's Brazilian midfielder Thiago Mendes, who was sent off for the foul that resulted in Neymar's injury, apologized on Instagram. ""Mistakes happen. But I'm here to sincerely apologize to Neymar. Like all Brazil's footballing public, I admire his football and I hope it's nothing serious."" Qatar-backed PSG will feel confident Neymar will be back in time for their Champions League last 16 clash in February against troubled Barcelona. It will be another chance for the French side to avenge their soul-destroying 'Remontada' defeat to Barca in 2017. Having beaten the Catalans 4-0 in the French capital, PSG crashed to a 6-1 defeat at the Camp Nou orchestrated by Neymar, who joined PSG in a 222-million-euro ($269 million) world record move weeks later. On Sunday night, Neymar's father hit out at the treatment he claims the 28-year-old is subjected to by opponents, calling for more yellow cards. PSG have been ravaged by a series of injuries, suspensions and coronavirus cases this season, which has left coach Thomas Tuchel's position in the balance. Despite heavy investment since Qatar Sports Investments bought the club in 2011, PSG are yet to claim Europe's biggest prize despite dominating in Ligue 1 with the likes of Neymar and France star Kylian Mbappe. They reached the final last season but were beaten 1-0 by Bayern Munich thanks to a goal from PSG's own youth product Kingsley Coman."
5,14/12/2020,00:24,Lyon defeat PSG as Neymar stretchered off with ankle injury,Paris Saint-Germain surrendered top spot in Ligue 1 after losing 1-0 at home to Lyon on Sunday but potentially suffered a more devastating blow as an anguished Neymar was stretchered off with an ankle injury.,"Tino Kadewere's first-half goal secured Lyon a seventh win in eight matches as they moved level with Lille, who took over first place earlier in the day following a 2-1 home victory over Bordeaux. PSG dropped to third after losing for the fourth time in 14 games this season, but the far greater concern will be the health of Neymar after his ankle appeared to twist awkwardly under a challenge from Thiago Mendes in stoppage time. The Lyon midfielder was sent off for the tackle following a VAR review while a distraught Neymar, in considerable pain, was taken off on a stretcher having immediately signalled for medical assistance. ""He's with the physio and the doctors and we have to wait for the tests tomorrow (Monday),"" PSG coach Thomas Tuchel told French broadcaster Telefoot. Lyon's first win away to PSG since October 2007, the last season they won the Ligue 1 crown, provided fresh hope of a genuine title race this term with the top five teams separated by just three points. ""We defended well, we destroyed their strength, and then played well enough in attack to score at least once,"" said Lyon coach Rudi Garcia. PSG trail the leading duo by a point with Marseille, who have two games in hand on their rivals, another point back in fourth alongside Montpellier. ""Losing top spot doesn't worry me. But we didn't have the right approach and I have a problem with that,"" said Tuchel. ""We were never mentally ready to play this match. We were shot mentally. We never found our rhythm either. We didn't play with enough concentration or discipline. ""It was a big step backwards after the last match. I'm surprised. I was expecting a very high level."" With Kylian Mbappe rested from the start, Moise Kean partnered Neymar in attack following the Brazilian's hat-trick in the midweek 5-1 Champions League win against Istanbul Basaksehir -- a game that was completed 24 hours later than planned after an unprecedented anti-racism protest. However it was Lyon, without any European commitments this season, who took the lead on 35 minutes after a loose pass under pressure from PSG captain Presnel Kimpembe. Karl Toko Ekambi collected the ball in the PSG half and immediately picked out Kadewere who steadied himself before sliding low beyond Keylor Navas for the Zimbabwe international's fifth goal of the campaign. Alessandro Florenzi drew a sharp save from Anthony Lopes before half-time while a thumping effort from Lucas Paqueta called Navas into action midway through the second half, just after the introduction of Mbappe. After Navas kept out an attempt from Lyon substitute Bruno Guimaraes, Mbappe had a late chance to rescue a point for PSG but shot wide from the edge of the area in time added on before Neymar's unwelcome injury. Portugal defender Jose Fonte, who turns 37 later this month, scored the winner for Lille with a bullet header just before half-time against Bordeaux. Jonathan Bamba's exquisite curling strike gave Lille the lead on 16 minutes at the Stade Pierre-Mauroy before Toma Basic levelled from a Hatem Ben Arfa corner. Lille travel to bottom side Dijon in midweek before the visit of defending champions PSG next Sunday in what could be a defining week for a club chasing a first league title since 2011. ""I don't think we can fight with Paris for the title. We need to fight to pick up points and stay at the top,"" said Lille coach Christophe Galtier, keen to temper expectations."
6,29/11/2020,18:19,"Lyon see off Reims to climb second, Monaco cruise","Lyon continued their fine run of form with a 3-0 win over Reims on Sunday which lifted them to second in Ligue 1, while Monaco beat Nimes to also move within two points of leaders Paris Saint-Germain.","Karl Toko Ekambi, Bruno Guimaraes and Moussa Dembele scored for Lyon as they made it 16 points from their last six matches to sit two points behind PSG and above Monaco and Montpellier on goal difference. ""We must continue in this vein and look upwards. We must put a run of victories together,"" said Lyon coach Rudi Garcia. ""This is the first time that we have won three times in a row. As in Angers (last week), we had an opportunity to (move up the) table. We seized it."" Lille can leapfrog Lyon, Monaco and Montpellier if they win at Saint-Etienne later on Sunday. PSG gave the chasing pack a chance to cut the gap in the title race with a 2-2 home draw against Bordeaux on Saturday, having blown a two-goal lead to lose to Monaco last week. Reims, who had Moreto Cassama sent off on 33 minutes, remain fourth from bottom and look destined for a relegation dog-fight. Toko Ekambi, returning from suspension, proved the key for Lyon, hitting the post early on before scoring the opener in the 22nd minute with a header at the back post from a cross by Memphis Depay. He also created the second -- Guimaraes's first for Lyon -- four minutes after the break, the Brazilian's shot taking a deflection off Marshall Munetsi. Toko Ekambi also teed up Dembele for the third shortly after he came on as a substitute for Tino Kadewere who had hit the post in the first half and had a goal ruled out for offside. Cassama was sent off for a foul on Depay when he looked to be in on goal. Later in the day, Monaco eased to a 3-0 victory over Nimes to notch their fourth straight league win. Young midfielder Sofiane Diop gave the hosts an early lead at the Stade Louis II, before Gelson Martins and Kevin Volland both struck in the second half to see off Nimes, who had Lucas Deaux dismissed in the 69th minute. Germany striker Volland has now scored five Ligue 1 goals for Monaco since his close-season move from Bayer Leverkusen. Fourth-placed Montpellier also extended their winning streak to four matches as Petar Skuletic scored late on to grab a 1-0 win at Lorient, despite midfielder Teji Savanier's missed penalty in the first half."

Lille can leapfrog them if they win at Saint-Etienne on Sunday evening. Reims, who had Moreto Cassama sent off after 33 minutes, remain fourth from bottom and look destined for a relegation dog fight. Toko Ekambi, returning from suspension, proved the key for Lyon, hitting the post early on before scoring the opener in the 22nd minute with a header at the back post from a cross by Memphis Depay.

8,01/11/2020,23:56,Unbeaten Lille held by stubborn 10-man Lyon,Lille lost ground on Ligue 1 leaders Paris Saint-Germain after a 1-1 draw at home to 10-man Lyon on Sunday but kept their unbeaten record this season intact.,"Jonathan Bamba curled in a fine 20-yard strike to give Lille the lead but Zeki Celik's own goal just before half-time brought Lyon level. The visitors played most of the second half a man down after Brazilian defender Marcelo was shown a second yellow card for a foul on Bamba but Lille could not take advantage. ""The first yellow was very harsh,"" said Lyon coach Rudi Garcia. ""Quite frankly, it killed the match. I would like to have seen 95 minutes against Lille with 11 against 11. I'm not going to say what I think... I'm very annoyed because it became difficult afterwards."" Lille stayed second but fell two points back of PSG while Lyon moved up to sixth after a fifth draw in nine outings this term. Bamba notched his fourth goal of the campaign with a terrific first-time effort after an inviting lay-off from Turkey international Burak Yilmaz. The goal came moments after Mike Maignan stood tall at the other end to deny Karl Toko Ekambi after the Cameroon striker was played clean through. Lyon goalkeeper Anthony Lopes pawed away a long-range shot from Yilmaz and Bamba then fizzed just over, but OL equalised when Houssem Aouar's drive smacked Celik in the chest and flew past Maignan. The dismissal of Marcelo five minutes into the second half prompted Garcia to withdraw Aouar for centre-back Djamel Benlamri, the Algerian Africa Cup of Nations winner who joined Lyon last month on a free transfer. Lille were unable to transform their sustained pressure into a winning goal and were held to a second consecutive draw. Earlier, Germany international Kevin Volland scored his first goals for Monaco since signing for the club in September as Niko Kovac's side thrashed Bordeaux 4-0. Monaco struck three times in as many minutes through Wissam Ben Yedder, Gelson Martins and Volland in the first half to take control at the Stade Louis II. Volland then grabbed another in the second half as Monaco won for just the second time in six matches to climb up to eighth place. France forward Ben Yedder crashed home a spot-kick on 27 minutes after his header was handled by Pablo, with a penalty awarded despite the ball looping over Benoit Costil and into the net following the deflection. Martins grabbed his first goal since serving a six-month ban for pushing a referee last season when he lunged at the far post to poke in a Ruben Aguilar cross. And former Bayer Leverkusen forward Volland promptly headed in from a Ben Yedder delivery to end his drought following his 11 million-euro ($13 million) move from Germany. The 28-year-old tapped in a second on 57 minutes as Martins slid the ball across goal for his unmarked team-mate. Nice moved up to fourth as Patrick Vieira's team extended their unbeaten domestic run to five games with a 3-0 victory at Angers. Rony Lopes put Nice ahead on 11 minutes and Pierre Lees-Melou added a second from the spot. Hicham Boudaoui came off the bench to net a third as Nice stayed four points behind PSG. Metz continued their fine recent form with a 1-0 win at Nimes while Montpellier defeated Saint-Etienne by the same scoreline courtesy of a goal from Englishman Stephy Mavididi. Reims beat Strasbourg 2-1 while Dijon remain the only team without a victory following a goalless draw at home to Lorient."
9,25/10/2020,23:55,Toko Ekambi at the double as Lyon thrash Monaco,"Lyon continued their revival with another first-half spree on their way to thrashing Monaco 4-1 in Ligue 1 on Sunday but earlier Lille faltered and blew a chance to retake top spot, drawing at Nice.","Lyon ended the eighth round of the French league season with an decisive home victory as Karl Toko Ekambi struck twice for the second week in a row. ""Toko Ekambi played a huge match,"" said Lyon coach Rudi Garcia. ""Let's hope he keeps it up."" Memphis Depay opened the scoring after a pass from Houssem Aouar in the 12th minute. Toko Ekambi converted a cross from Tino Kadewere at the second attempt in the 34th minute. In the 41st minute, the Cameroon striker won a penalty that Aouar converted. Three minutes later, Toko Ekambi took advantage of a misunderstanding in the Monegasque defence to score. ""We led 4-0 at half-time on our four shots on target,"" said Garcia. ""In the first half, Anthony Lopes made at least two great saves that allowed us to reach the break in the lead."" Monaco had dominated possession and their coach Niko Kovac agreed that the half-time score flattered Lyon. ""It was a pretty incredible first half,"" said Kovac. ""I have never experienced such a first half before."" Last week in Strasbourg, Lyon led by three goals after 42 minutes only to finish the game clinging to a 3-2 victory. Wissam Ben Yedder converted a Monaco penalty early in the second half but even though the visitors dominated possession, they could not make the game close. ""We had opportunities to put in a fifth goal but the main thing is to hold on to a good win,"" said Lopes. Lyon moved up to sixth and next week face Lille who are second on goal difference after drawing at Nice. Lille remain unbeaten after eight matches but trail reigning champions Paris Saint-Germain on goal difference. Patrick Vieira's Nice sit fifth, four points off the top two. Kasper Dolberg put Nice ahead less than five minutes into the second half, getting in front of Lille defender Domagoj Bradaric before dinking the ball into the net to score his third goal of the season. Lille levelled in the 58th minute as Luiz Araujo's pass freed Burak Yilmaz, who hammered home a fierce volley. The veteran Turkish striker has netted four Ligue 1 goals since signing from Besiktas in the close season. PSG had moved to the top of the table with a 4-0 home victory over Dijon on Saturday. jc-pb/dj <org>BESIKTAS FUTBOL</org>"
10,23/10/2020,03:58,"Clasico, Dortmund v Schalke - what to look out for in Europe this weekend","Two of the biggest rivalries in world football will dominate the weekend's action in Europe, with the first Clasico of the season being followed by the Ruhr derby between Borussia Dortmund and Schalke on Saturday.","AFP Sport previews the standout action on the continent this weekend: Barcelona v Real Madrid, Saturday 1400 GMT Once the undisputed greatest fixture in world football, the Clasico has lost much of its lustre. Cristiano Ronaldo, Neymar and Andres Iniesta were among the superstars to move on from Real Madrid and Barcelona in recent years, and this year Gareth Bale and Luis Suarez departed too. Lionel Messi would have left as well, had Barcelona let him. Usually there would be 99,000 fans packed into the Camp Nou. This time, because of the coronavirus pandemic, there will be none. The huge global audience will remain, but it's a long time since these teams have been at such a collective low ebb. Barca are struggling to get back on their feet under new coach Ronald Koeman and lost 1-0 at Getafe last weekend. Real won La Liga last season but the last week gives a more accurate picture of where they stand: Zinedine Zidane's team lost 1-0 at home to Cadiz and then went down 3-2 to Shakhtar Donetsk in the Champions League. Madrid have lost just once in their last seven visits to the Camp Nou though. Borussia Dortmund v Schalke, Saturday 1630 GMT Another great fixture usually played before a huge crowd, only 300 fans will be allowed in to see Dortmund host Schalke, rather than the usual 80,000. These sides are fierce rivals and tensions are running extra high after Dortmund prodigy Youssoufa Moukoko, 15, received alleged death threats and racist abuse from Schalke fans after scoring a hat-trick in last Sunday's 3-2 win in an Under-19 derby. Dortmund, with Erling Braut Haaland leading the line, will be favourites to get the better of a struggling Schalke who lost 4-0 on their last visit in May. Schalke sacked coach David Wagner after their poor start this season followed a long winless run at the end of the last campaign. Manuel Baum has replaced him and got his first point last weekend against Union Berlin. Dortmund's 1-0 victory at Hoffenheim last weekend made it three wins out of four in the Bundesliga this season, but Lucien Favre's side lost 3-1 at Lazio in the Champions League in midweek. Atletico Madrid v Real Betis, Saturday 1900 GMT Atletico are hoping to take advantage of the struggles of Real Madrid and Barcelona to win a first La Liga title since 2014. The signing of Luis Suarez from Barcelona underlined their ambition, but they head into Saturday's home meeting with Betis on the rebound from their joint-worst defeat in Diego Simeone's nine years as coach in Wednesday's 4-0 loss at Bayern Munich. Manuel Pellegrini's Betis have been inconsistent so far but, with the likes of Nabil Fekir, Sergio Canales and the evergreen Joaquin, should not be underestimated. Lyon v Monaco, Sunday 2000 GMT Lyon and Monaco have been Champions League semi-finalists in recent seasons but are not in Europe at all in this campaign, so each is desperate to get back to the promised land. Lyon have started poorly in Ligue 1 with just two wins in seven but have kept hold of star men Memphis Depay and Houssem Aouar. Monaco have been inconsistent too under new coach Niko Kovac but in Wissam Ben Yedder they have one of Europe's most lethal marksmen. AC Milan v Roma, Monday 1945 GMT Milan put their perfect start to the Serie A campaign on the line when they welcome Roma to San Siro on Monday. The Rossoneri have won four out of four so far in the league with Zlatan Ibrahimovic in fine form, but Roma have some useful veterans of their own in attack in Edin Dzeko and Pedro and are also slowly building form."
11,18/10/2020,16:42,Lyon back on track after Depay triple assist,Captain Memphis Depay set-up three goals as Lyon beat Strasbourg 3-2 away in Ligue 1 on Sunday to claim their first win since August.,"Netherlands' attacker Depay was the provider for Tino Kadewere and twice for Karl Toko Ekambi in the first half before Habib Diallo and Jean-Eudes Aholou scored for the hosts. Depay's side move up to eighth with their first three points since an August 28 win over Dijon. Strasbourg remain in 18th with just one victory this season. Zimbabwe forward Kadewere opened the scoring after a quarter of an hour, firing home first time from Depay's long ball. Depay, who also assisted Donny van de Beek on international duty on Wednesday, then combined on two occasions with Toko Ekambi before the 42-minute mark to make it 3-0. The hosts fought back as Senegal's Diallo cut the deficit 79 seconds later. Ivory Coast midfielder Aholou, on loan from Monaco then made it a one-goal game with his first effort since the opening day of last season with a left-footed volley into the bottom corner 10 minutes into the second half. Depay, who was linked with a move to Barcelona during the transfer window, almost claimed a fourth assist but Marcelo's header from a corner was blocked on the line by Kenny Lala. The highlight of later matches Sunday is the northern derby as third-placed Lille host promoted Lens in fourth. On Saturday, Marseille warmed up for their return to the Champions League next week with a 3-1 victory over Bordeaux. On Friday, Kylian Mbappe scored twice in PSG's 4-0 win at Nimes."
12,04/10/2020,23:51,"Marseille and Lyon's struggles continue in draw, Rennes stay top",Marseille and Lyon continued their shaky starts to the season on Sunday with a 1-1 draw that leaves both sides languishing in mid-table in Ligue 1.,"Marseille are 10th on nine points following the draw at the Groupama stadium while Rudi Garcia's Lyon, who reached the semi-finals of last season's Champions League, are two points and four places back. Andre Villas-Boas' Marseille have not won in the four matches since they beat Paris Saint-Germain last month while Lyon's winless run already stretches to five matches in the six-game-old season. The hosts have drawn four of those matches and struggled to break down Marseille even though the away side played most of the match with 10 men following Dmitri Payet's 19th-minute red card for a high challenge on Leo Dubois. Marseille had taken the lead thanks to talisman Payet's smart finish just three minutes before he was sent off, but Houssem Aouar levelled from the penalty spot just before the half hour mark and that's how the scores remained. Aouar, who was set to be leaving in the summer transfer window which closes on Monday, thought he had also scored the winner with 14 minutes remaining only to see his goal ruled out for what looked like a soft foul on Marseille keeper Steve Mandanda. ""In the circumstances it's a good point which gives us some confidence,"" said Villas Boas. ""I'm happy because the players gave everything, we rediscovered the spirit that we has last season."" Earlier Rennes clung on to top spot in Ligue 1 after scrabbling to a 2-2 home with Reims which allowed Lille to move level on points with the leaders with a 3-0 win at Strasbourg. Rennes were leading at the break and were set to go back clear in first place but Boulaye Dia barged through the home defence before slotting home the goal that would give Reims a point in the 66th minute. Lille meanwhile stormed to victory in Alsace thanks to goals from Zeki Celik, Renato Sanches and Burak Yilmaz which maintained their unbeaten start to the season. Both sides are on 14 points, one ahead of newly-promoted Lens, who drop down to third but are on a storming run after beating 10-time league champions Saint-Etienne 2-0 on Saturday. Champions PSG meanwhile are lurking ominously a further point back in fourth after destroying Angers 6-1 on Friday night."
13,30/09/2020,19:19,Lyon sign Brazil's Lucas Paqueta from AC Milan,"Brazil midfielder Lucas Paqueta has signed for Lyon from AC Milan on a five-year deal for a fee of 20 million euros ($23.4m), the French club announced on Wednesday.","""He is joining us for five seasons. He already knows some of the players in our squad and we are convinced he will quickly settle in,"" said Lyon president Jean-Michel Aulas before confirming the fee. Paqueta, 23, had earlier arrived in the city to undergo a medical. Capped 11 times by Brazil, he joined Milan from Flamengo in January last year but failed to properly settle at San Siro. ""Good luck to Lucas. He is still a good player and I told him to have full belief in his own ability,"" said Milan coach Stefano Pioli, who was speaking ahead of his side's Europa League play-off tie against Rio Ave in Portugal. The Lyon squad already features several Brazilians, including Paqueta's fellow midfielder Bruno Guimaraes. The club's sporting director Juninho is also from Brazil. Paqueta's arrival at last season's Champions League semi-finalists could smooth the way for Houssem Aouar to leave the club. The midfielder has been linked with Arsenal and Juventus. Jeff Reine-Adelaide could also leave Lyon, with Aulas indicating there are two offers on the table for the France Under-21 midfielder. Those are thought to be from Rennes and Hertha Berlin. Another player set to come in to Lyon is the 18-year-old Uruguayan winger Facundo Pellistri from Penarol."

Responding on Twitter, Aulas said: ""The president of Barcelona told me on Sunday that Barca are really suffering from the Covid crisis and were not able to make an offer."" Koeman has been on the hunt for a striker after telling Uruguayan Luis Suarez he wasn't in his plans for the coming season. Depay played an important role in Lyon's progress to the Champions League semi-final and scored a hat-trick in their opening Ligue 1 win of the season over Dijon. However, he had announced that he did not wish to extend his Lyon contract, which expires next summer, and has never hidden his desire to play ""for a bigger club"". The 26-year-old started on the bench for Lyon's Ligue 1 match against Montpellier on Tuesday night. He began his career with PSV Eindhoven before moving to Manchester United and, in 2017, Lyon."

""Barcelona hope to confirm officially the transfer and introduce Depay to Camp Nou later in the week,"" said De Telegraaf. The transfer amount would be 25 million euros according to the daily, plus five million euros at the end of this season, and two million euros in bonuses.

""I feel blessed to be here. I cannot wait to start my new journey and meet my new team-mates,"" Tete told Fulham's website. ""I heard of Fulham's interest and I was bowled over. I spoke with people around me and knew quickly I wanted to leave Lyon and join Fulham. ""The team is back in the Premier League now and I will give 100 per cent to keep us there."" Tete, who has won 13 caps for the Netherlands, began his career at Ajax before joining Lyon in 2017. The 24-year-old right-back helped Lyon reached the Champions League semi-finals last season and made the last of his 82 appearances for the club against Dijon last week. ""He's a young player with great experience, and I'm thrilled that he's joining us on a long contract,"" Fulham sporting director Tony Khan said. ""I'm confident that with his talent and his desire to win, he'll be a great asset for us now and in future seasons.""

17,29/08/2020,00:00,Depay hat-trick powers Lyon to win,Memphis Depay scored a hat-trick including two penalties as Champions League semi-finalists Lyon began the new French season with a 4-1 victory over Dijon on Friday.,"Dutch forward Depay bagged his first Ligue 1 goals since December, having missed the coronavirus-shortened second half of last season after rupturing knee ligaments just before Christmas. ""I'm really happy to have scored three goals tonight. It wasn't my best match personally. We needed to win and that's what we did,"" said Depay. ""It's a strange feeling going from one season to another very quickly,"" he added, with the game coming just nine days after Lyon's 3-0 loss to Bayern in Lisbon. Lyon sporting director Juninho has said there will be departures before the end of the transfer window on October 5 as the club heads into its first season without European football since 1996-97. Depay, along with Houssem Aouar and Moussa Dembele, have repeatedly been linked with moves but the 26-year-old insisted he is concentrating on helping Lyon make a run at ending Paris Saint-Germain's dominance. ""I'm focused on OL. I can dream of big clubs but I'm looking to do my best here,"" said Depay, who doesn't believe the lighter schedule this season is necessarily a plus. ""I don't think not playing in Europe is an advantage because when you play in Europe you get better."" Lyon, who finished a poor seventh last term, were without midfielder Aouar for their opening game of the new campaign after he tested positive for Covid-19 earlier in the day, and the home side fell behind to a first Dijon goal for Aurelien Scheidler. Depay, the Lyon captain, equalised from the penalty spot after Ahmad Ngouyamsa barged Maxwel Cornet over as Rudi Garcia's side turned the game in their favour with three goals in the space of six minutes just before half-time at the Groupama Stadium. The former Manchester United winger spun past his defender on the corner of the box and fizzed in a dangerous low cross that caused Dijon's Wesley Lautoa to poke into his own net and give Lyon the lead. Seconds after the subsequent restart Depay struck again, Karl Toko Ekambi's deflected ball finding its way to the Dutchman who displayed great poise and skill to volley beyond Alfred Gomis from six yards. Senegal goalkeeper Gomis produced a magnificent save to deny Depay his hat-trick on the hour as Lyon continued to attack freely. England youth international Jonathan Panzo, who won the Under-17 World Cup alongside Phil Foden in 2017, came on for his Dijon debut in the second half two days after the defender's arrival on a three-year deal from Monaco. The Chelsea academy graduate promptly conceded another penalty after a VAR review as he was adjudged to have clipped the heels of Leo Dubois. Depay again converted by blasting home via the underside of the crossbar to seal his hat-trick on a memorable return to top-flight action. Nine games are scheduled in Ligue 1 this weekend, with Marseille due to visit Brest on Sunday despite another three reported coronavirus cases at the club. Marseille's planned opener against Saint-Etienne last Friday was postponed after five players tested positive for Covid-19. Title holders PSG's scheduled game at Lens on Saturday has been pushed back to September 10 following their run to the final of the Champions League in Lisbon."

""The results received this morning by the medical management of the club revealed that Houssem Aouar is the only player in the squad to have tested positive for Covid-19,"" the club said in a statement. ""As soon as the results were made known, Houssem was put into isolation for a fortnight while still being completely asymptomatic."" Lyon added that Aouar would ""return to training with the first-team squad in 10 to 15 days, depending on his next follow-up tests."" He is expected to be withdrawn from the France squad he was named in Thursday by coach Didier Deschamps for next month's Nations League matches against Sweden and Croatia. Manchester United midfielder Paul Pogba was omitted from the initial squad after he also tested positive for Covid-19."
19,27/08/2020,16:33,Lyon hungry for Ligue 1 success after European exploits,"Just over a week since the end of their Champions League adventure in Lisbon, Lyon return to domestic action on Friday at home to Dijon with aspirations of dethroning Paris Saint-Germain for a first Ligue 1 title since 2008.","Lyon reached the Champions League semi-finals for only the second time, eliminating Juventus and Manchester City before falling to eventual winners Bayern Munich, as France had two clubs in the last four of the competition for the first time. Despite matching their best run in the tournament, the 2020-21 campaign will be Lyon's first without European football in 24 years after finishing seventh in a shortened French season. ""We want to show we have a great team and that we can play in the Champions League again next season. We want to take back the (Ligue 1) trophy,"" said defender Fernando Marcal. ""I think with a lot of work that we can compete for first place and the title. That's our goal and not to come second or third."" Lyon coach Rudi Garcia believes the lack of other commitments can be turned into an advantage, although the make-up of his squad could change significantly before the end of the transfer window on October 5. Midfielder Houssem Aouar, captain Memphis Depay and forward Moussa Dembele may all be sold before then, joining a long list of key players to depart in recent years. ""Those are just guesses. Between now and the end of the transfer period we have five matches to play. We don't know what's going to happen,"" said Garcia. ""For the time being, there's not a lot going on in the countries where the market is open. With the consequences of the pandemic, we don't know how clubs are going to react."" If Lyon are to seriously challenge PSG, whose scheduled game at Lens on Saturday has been pushed back to September 10, they will need to make a much better start than a year ago when Sylvinho was sacked in October with the club languishing in 14th place. ""It's very important to start strongly or you will fall behind,"" stressed Garcia. Nine games are scheduled this weekend, with Marseille due to visit Brest on Sunday despite another three reported coronavirus cases at the club. Marseille's planned opener against Saint-Etienne last Friday was postponed after five players tested positive for Covid-19. Champions League newcomers Rennes are at home to Montpellier on Saturday while Nice will hope new signing Amine Gouiri can build on his two-goal debut for the club when they travel to Strasbourg. Lille go to Reims in Sunday's early game while Niko Kovac is chasing his first win as Monaco boss away to Metz following a 2-2 draw on the opening weekend. Former Newcastle winger Thauvin missed almost the entire 2019-20 season with an ankle injury that limited him to just 20 minutes of action. The 27-year-old winger is entering the final season of his contract at Marseille but sporting director Pablo Longoria is keen to sort out an extension for the France international, having just tied down goalkeeper Steve Mandanda until 2024. Marseille coach Andre Villas-Boas guided the team to second place in his first year in charge and believes the return of Thauvin, scorer of 53 Ligue 1 goals in his past three full seasons, can drive the club on further. ""He's going to give us another dimension, in tight matches he will be able to make the difference. He'll bring his quality and assists."" Fixtures (all times 1300 GMT unless stated)"

22,20/08/2020,00:05,Gnabry eyes Champions League title after stirring display for Bayern Munich,Serge Gnabry celebrated with his NBA-inspired 'stir the pot' gesture after scoring two goals in Wednesday's Champions League semi-final against Lyon to keep Bayern Munich on course to repeat their 2013 treble after a 3-0 victory.,"""We really want to win the final. That will be the deciding factor, we will give our all to win the treble,"" Gnabry said with an eye on Sunday's final in Lisbon against Paris Saint-Germain. Robert Lewandowski added the third goal for his 55th of the season to keep Bayern on course to add a sixth Champions League title to their Bundesliga and German Cup triumphs. Seconds after a shot by Lyon forward Karl Ekambi hit Bayern's post, Gnabry opened the scoring with a stunning piece of skill in the 18th minute. After trapping Joshua Kimmich's long-range pass, he cut in from the right wing, beat two defenders and powered his shot out of reach of Lyon goalkeeper Anthony Lopes. Gnarby, 25, then doubled Bayern's lead on 33 minutes by tapping home after Lopes parried a Lewandowksi shot. ""Lyon put a lot of pressure on us,"" admitted Gnabry. ""They were very aggressive, they didn't give us many chances early on and we had a bit of luck in the beginning before finding our feet. ""You can't defend against everything, but all in all we were very strong."" His brace leaves Gnabry on nine Champions League goals this season, including four in Bayern's stunning 7-2 demolition of Tottenham in the group stages. After Bayern's goal romp at Tottenham last October, Gnabry, a former Arsenal winger could not resist tweeting ""North London is RED!!!"". He netted two more goals in London last February in a 3-0 win at Chelsea in the last 16, first leg tie. Gnabry also scored Bayern's third in Friday's jaw-dropping 8-2 rout of Barcelona in the quarter-finals and has now scored 23 goals in 45 games in all competitions. Gnabry is this season's third-highest scorer in the Champions League behind Lewandowski (15) and Dortmund teenager Erling Braut Haaland (10). He celebrated his stunning opener on Wednesday by making the gesture of stirring a spoon in a pot. Earlier this season, he revealed, ""I'm a big fan of the NBA, especially James Harden"". The Houston Rockets playmaker celebrates with the same pot-stirring gesture when he lands a big shot. Born in Stuttgart, Gnabry joined the Bundesliga club when he was 12. From Stuttgart's academy, where he played alongside future Germany team-mates Timo Werner and Joshua Kimmich, Gnabry's performances attracted Arsenal. He joined the Gunners after his 16th birthday in 2011 and was promoted to Arsenal's reserves after less than a season with the Under-18 squad. ""I went to England because everyone told me not to go, that I couldn't make it. I wanted that challenge,"" Gnabry says of his time in north London. After only a handful off appearances for Arsenal, Gnabry spent 2015/16 on loan at West Bromwich Albion before being selected for Germany's Olympic team. He won a silver medal, aged 21, and finished joint top-scorer with six goals at the 2016 Rio de Janeiro games as Germany lost to the Neymar-led Brazil in the final. His senior debut followed in November 2016 with a hat-trick at minnows San Marino in Germany's 8-0 away romp in a World Cup qualifier. He returned to Germany for 2016/17 with Werder Bremen where he scored 11 goals in 27 appearances for the Bundesliga strugglers. Bayern bought him in 2017, but immediately loaned him to Hoffenheim, before Gnabry joined the German giants permanently for 2018/19. He has replaced Arjen Robben, whose winning goal in the London final gave Bayern their last Champions League title in 2013."

Bayern humiliated Barcelona 8-2 on Friday after winning a record-extending 29th Bundesliga title earlier this year. ""Bayern have quite incredible statistics. But you can't stop at that. We're underdogs. Even if we have less of a chance of making it through than them, we have a chance,"" Garcia, who replaced the sacked Sylvinho in October, said. ""We are not a big mountain to climb but sometime you just need a small stone in your shoe to stop you from climbing. We're hoping to be that small stone tomorrow,"" he added. Garcia's side, who need to win the Champions League to play in Europe next season after a seventh-placed finish in Ligue 1, have overcome Serie A winners Juventus and Pep Guardiola's Manchester City to feature in just their second last four appearance in the competition. ""It's huge to be in a semi-final. But we've won nothing. We have to keep all our determination and remain mobilised for the next match,"" the ex-Marseille and Roma boss said. ""The two qualifications we claimed have to give us confidence, as much as the team needs, and we need to show we can do big things."" French World Cup winner Corentin Tolisso left Lyon for the Bavarians in 2017 and has featured in the two most recent European victories from the bench. ""He's worked a lot in recent weeks and now he's on form again,"" Bayern coach Hansi Flick said. ""He came on against Chelsea, he scored a goal, he came on against Barcelona. We didn't bring him on by accident, he was present straight away.

The shockwaves are still being felt in Barcelona where both coach Quique Setien and sports director Eric Abidal have been sacked. Following that jaw-dropping victory, Bayern are ""really hungry"" for more success, says captain Manuel Neuer. However, semi-final opponents Lyon have punched above their weight by beating Juventus and Manchester City to reach the last four. Flick takes confidence from the ""very good atmosphere"" and ""enormous quality in training"". ""That gives you confidence in the team. I'm relaxed because, I know that they're very focused and have big goals."" The Bayern boss warns ""the game starts from scratch. We have to play like we did against Barcelona. Less than 100 percent will not be enough"". His side have won their last 20 matches in all competitions, securing an eighth straight Bundesliga title and lifting the German Cup in the process. Their striker Robert Lewandowski is the Champions League's top-scorer this season on 14 goals -- three short of Cristiano Ronaldo's record. Bayern winger Serge Gnabry, who has seven so far in the competition, including four in the 7-2 thrashing of Tottenham away in the group stages, says they must not underestimate Lyon. ""I think we were all surprised by the end result (against Barcelona), but Lyon will be a different opponent in a different game,"" said Gnabry ""They've beaten Juventus and Manchester City - both those teams were favourites. It looks like we're favourites now and we have to be careful."" Flick knows what to expect from Lyon coach Rudi Garcia. ""They are very compact in defence, can run all day and are strong on the counter-attack,"" he said. ""We want to reach the final and beat Lyon, knowing full well that it's not that easy, so we have to be on the front foot from the first minute."""
25,18/08/2020,03:10,'Greedy' Bayern wary of Man City-slayers Lyon,"Corentin Tolisso says treble-chasing Bayern Munich should be wary of his former club Lyon in Wednesday's Champions League semi-final as the ""greedy"" Bavarians look to build on their demolition of Barcelona.","""From a German point of view, perhaps Lyon's the least known team. But against Manchester City, we all saw what this team is capable of,"" warned France midfielder Tolisso, who joined Bayern from Lyon in 2017. ""We will never underestimate them. When the big games come up, Lyon is always there. ""No team can reach the semi-finals by chance,"" added the 2018 World Cup winner, who is likely to start on the bench on Wednesday. Two second-half goals by substitute Moussa Dembele helped Lyon dump Pep Guardiola's City out of the Champions League and Bayern have no intention of following suit. In the wake of their stunning 8-2 thrashing of Barcelona in the quarter-finals, there is an air of determination in the Bayern camp. Defender Jerome Boateng has compared the current squad to the 2013 outfit who landed the first treble of Bundesliga, German Cup and Champions League titles in the club's history. ""To be honest, I noticed from day one that something was up,"" remembers Boateng of the 2013 squad. ""That was our big goal for the season. ""We played better in the Champions League from the start than we might have done in the Bundesliga. ""We were extremely greedy all the time."" The current crop of Bayern stars has the same insatiable appetite, earning the nickname 'FC Never Satisfied' by the German media. They are certainly goal hungry. Bayern's average of 4.33 goals per game is a new Champions League record. They have scored 39 goals in nine European games, including a 7-2 drubbing of Tottenham and a 6-0 romp at Red Star Belgrade. Robert Lewandowski is the competition's top scorer with 14 goals -- three short of Cristiano Ronaldo's 2013-14 record for a Champions League season. However, nothing is being taken for granted against Lyon. ""The next game is always the most difficult,"" said Boateng despite Bayern winning their last 20 games. The thrashing of Barcelona now counts for ""nothing. Our opponent is not standing where he is for nothing,"" he added. Coach Hansi Flick should have right-back Benjamin Pavard fit again after injury."
26,17/08/2020,15:56,'No coincidence': German coaches dominate Champions League semis,Bayern Munich boss Hansi Flick is hoping for a rendezvous with compatriots Julian Nagelsmann or Thomas Tuchel in Sunday's Champions League final as three German coaches contest the last four for the first time.,"Having demolished Barcelona 8-2 in Friday's jaw-dropping quarter-final, Bayern now face French side Lyon on Wednesday for a place in the final. The other berth will be decided when Flick's fellow German coaches Nagelsmann and Tuchel go head-to-head in Tuesday's other semi-final between RB Leipzig and Paris Saint-Germain. ""Of course I am happy for Thomas and Julian"", said Bayern coach Flick. ""We'll try to meet one of them in the final."" Should Bayern and Leipzig both progress, it would set up the first all-German Champions League final since 2013, when the Bavarians beat Dortmund 2-1 at Wembley Stadium. ""This shows that we are training good coaches,"" Bayern chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge told Sky Sports Italia. ""Two German teams haven't come this far in years."" Coincidentally, Leipzig coach Nagelsmann, PSG boss Tuchel and Flick all turned to coaching after injuries prematurely ended their playing careers. Nagelsmann, 33, who was barely out of his teens when a knee injury ended his playing career in 2008, has steered Leipzig to the Champions League semis for the first time in the club's short history in his debut season in charge. Under 46-year-old Tuchel, PSG are in the last four for the first time since 1995. Flick, who made 100 appearances as a midfielder for Bayern and won the Bundesliga title four times between 1986 and 1990, has excelled in just under 10 months in charge. The 55-year-old has seen Bayern win all six Champions League games since replacing Niko Kovac in late 2019. Under Flick, Bayern have won their last 20 games with Friday's demolition of Barcelona the stand-out result of this season's competition. Flick was also assistant coach when Germany won the 2014 World Cup, which included a jaw-dropping 7-1 win over hosts Brazil in the semi-finals. He is on the verge of winning Bundesliga, German Cup and Champions League titles for Bayern in a single season, which would be the first time since Jupp Heynckes' treble feat in 2013. ""I know from personal experience how it feels to reach a semi-final,"" said Flick. ""You are among the best teams in Europe, so you are very happy."" As Jurgen Klopp steered Liverpool to both the 2018 and 2019 Champions League finals, for the third season in a row there will be at least one German coach in Sunday's final. ""We should be happy that a few German coaches are in the top four in Europe. It's a nice thing,"" said Nagelsmann. Three Germans coaches in the last four is tribute to the work done behind the scenes by the Association of German Football Coaches (BDFL), whose demanding courses consistently produce high-quality coaches. ""It's certainly no coincidence,"" BDFL President Lutz Hangartner told AFP subsidiary SID. ""It's rather proof that the training of coaches in Germany is very good."" Nagelsmann, the youngest coach in history to reach a Champions League semi-final, ""enjoyed a good coaching education"" thanks to the German Football Association (DFB). However, he says while a trio of German coaches in the semi-finals is unusual, his countryman have often been in charge at the business end of the Champions League. ""I remember what was written when German football was in the doldrums,"" he said after no Bundesliga club reached the Champions League quarter-finals last season. ""Now everything is good again? ""That's not how it is. You shouldn't live in extremes -- but you can enjoy the moment."""
27,16/08/2020,17:00,"Ruthless Bayern must build on Barcelona rout, says Boateng","Jerome Boateng on Sunday praised the form of ""world-class"" Alphonso Davies and said treble-chasing Bayern Munich must stay focused in the wake of their Champions League demolition of Barcelona when they play Lyon in the semi-finals.","""I don't know whether the others read the papers, I certainly don't much, but we know that it is already behind us,"" Boateng said of Bayern's stunning 8-2 hammering of Barcelona in Friday's quarter-final. ""It's clear that a result like that doesn't happen every day, but it doesn't count for anything from now on,"" he added. ""Now we really want to reach the final."" Thomas Mueller and substitute Philippe Coutinho both scored two goals each as Bayern crushed Lionel Messi's Barcelona, marking the Germans as favourites to win next Sunday's final. As Bayern sent records tumbling, Boateng singled out the dazzling run of left-back Davies, who sliced through the defence to set up Joshua Kimmich to score Bayern's fifth goal against Barcelona. ""Wow! It was world-class. You don't often see such a talented boy,"" Boateng said of the Canadian teenager. ""I am happy for him because he is a nice, down-to-earth lad off the field. ""There is still a lot of potential in there, he will get a lot better."" In Wednesday's semi-final, Bayern face a Lyon side which shocked Pep Guardiola's Manchester City in the last eight. ""Of course we were surprised, but Lyon had already beaten Juventus,"" said Boateng. ""It was a somewhat strange game, because Manchester had a lot of possession. ""But it really doesn't matter to us who we play, we just want build on the positive game we had against Barcelona."" Bayern chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge admitted being surprised by the steely attitude in Bayern's dressing room after dismantling Barcelona. ""After the game, I went into the dressing room and expected the boys to celebrate a glorious victory, but they were calm and concentrated, ready for the next challenge,"" Rummenigge told Sky Sport Italy. Bayern coach Hansi Flick has won all six Champions League games since he replaced Niko Kovac last November, and the club is on a 20-match winning run dating back to February, claiming an eighth straight league title and lifting the German Cup in the process. Boateng has also rediscovered his best form under Flick, Germany's assistant coach when they won the 2014 World Cup in Brazil. ""He has developed in a really positive way, his speeches are very good, training is fun,"" said Boateng. ""He's not become more distant, he has less time, but you can still talk to him about topics other than football."""
28,16/08/2020,13:34,Lyon surprise means new Champions League format leaves major powers locked out,"Lyon were not supposed to make it to Lisbon at all for the Champions League 'Final Eight', but now they are through to one of two Franco-German semi-finals against Bayern Munich while the giants of England, Spain and Italy watch from the sidelines.","It is an unlikely last-four line-up in this unprecedented finale to the competition, reduced to a straight knockout tournament from the quarter-finals onwards after the long delay to the season caused by the coronavirus pandemic. Among those celebrating this shared Franco-German success on Saturday night was the French president, Emmanuel Macron. ""In Brussels and on the football field, France and Germany are the driving forces in Europe,"" wrote Macron, a Marseille fan, on Twitter. France may be the world champions but their best players usually move abroad. Ligue 1 is often derided by outside observers. Now, for the first time it has two clubs in the Champions League semi-finals in the same season. ""FARMERS LEAGUE"" wrote PSG's Kylian Mbappe in a tweet on Saturday as he congratulated Lyon, in an ironic reference to an oft-used insult towards Ligue 1 on social media. The two French clubs could still meet in the final, a year after Liverpool beat Tottenham Hotspur in an all-English final and Europe appeared to accept once and for all that the Premier League was an unstoppable force. But aside from the more unpredictable nature of one-off matches behind closed doors on neutral territory compared to the usual home and away ties, maybe there is a more obvious explanation. Those in France who feared the decision to end their season early in April due to the health crisis would prove a major handicap for their clubs in Europe are being forced to revise their thinking. At the time, a front-page headline in sports daily L'Equipe summed up the mood. ""Like idiots"", it said. Paris Saint-Germain had played two competitive matches in five months before defeating Atalanta in their quarter-final. Lyon managed just one competitive outing in the same period before going to Turin and eliminating Juventus on away goals last weekend. Buoyed by that triumph, a team that finished seventh in the shortened French season promptly ousted Manchester City. ""It is incredible because we are the surprise team now. I don't think many people expected us to get here,"" said Lyon goalkeeper Anthony Lopes. PSG and Lyon now face RB Leipzig and Bayern respectively, with the two German clubs having come into the 'Final Eight' rested and raring to go, the Bundesliga season having restarted before ending in late June. In contrast, City played 12 matches in 40 days after the Premier League resumed in mid-June, before beating Real Madrid in their last 16, second leg. Atalanta played 13 games in six weeks, while Spain's representatives played twice a week between mid-June and mid-July. Lyon's players ran a combined nine kilometres more than City on Saturday. More importantly, those players will have come into the 'Final Eight' better rested mentally. UEFA president Aleksander Ceferin this week told AFP that the 'Final Eight' format would be a one-off, saying it was ""impossible"" in a normal year because of the crowded match calendar. The 'Final Eight' has thrown up something not seen since 1991 and the end of the old European Cup. That is the last year in which none of the semi-finalists came from Spain, England or Italy, the most successful nations in the tournament's history. Red Star Belgrade defeated Bayern and then won the final against Marseille, who had overcome Spartak Moscow in the semis. That was also the last year to feature no English teams after their long ban from Europe following the 1985 Heysel disaster. The next season, 1991/92, was the first with a group stage, and the Champions League was born. Only clubs from Spain, England and Italy have featured in the last six finals. Now it is the chance for Germany and France -- the political giants of the EU -- and if Bayern do not live up to their favourites' tag by winning a sixth European Cup, there will be a new name on the trophy."
29,16/08/2020,12:19,Guardiola's tinkering ends in familiar Champions League exit for Man City,Manchester City's latest shock Champions League exit to Lyon left Pep Guardiola in the spotlight for all the wrong reasons as the Catalan coach again tinkered to ill-effect when it mattered most in Europe.,"Guardiola, one of the most decorated coaches of all-time with eight league titles to his name in Spain, Germany and England, has now not won the Champions League since the second of his two triumphs in the competition as Barcelona manager in 2011. City still have never won the Champions League despite the billions spent by the club's Abu Dhabi owners. The English side's early years as Champions League regulars were met with growing pains as they fell to European giants like Barca, Bayern Munich and Real Madrid. But since Guardiola arrived in Manchester in 2016, City have failed to make it beyond the quarter-finals while exiting to Monaco, Liverpool, Tottenham and now a Lyon side that finished seventh in the curtailed Ligue 1 season. ""Maybe one day we will break these quarter-finals,"" said a visibly exhausted Guardiola after a 3-1 defeat riddled with errors at both ends of the field. ""I am not able to do it with these incredible guys."" Guardiola's decision to match up Lyon with an unfamiliar 3-5-2 formation that left the creative talents of David Silva, Bernardo Silva, Riyad Mahrez and Phil Foden on the bench was just the latest questionable call of his nine-year Champions League drought. ""This one was down to another bout of the too-clever-by-half tinkering that has inexplicably seemed to grip Guardiola on his biggest Champions League nights ever since he last won it,"" commented The Times. Guardiola's European woes at City and three years at Bayern have come from conceding in waves. Monaco won a thrilling 6-6 tie on away goals in 2017, Liverpool thrashed a City team on their way to 100 points in the Premier League 5-1 over two legs and Tottenham scored three times at the Etihad last season. Guardiola conceded his change of system was borne of a lack of trust in his defence, which saw City meekly surrender their Premier League title to Liverpool without a fight this season. ""They are so fast up front the way they play and we are not so quick central defenders. I didn't want to leave them 2 v 2,"" he said. But that problem is rooted in City's lavish spending on defenders Guardiola cannot rely on. John Stones and Nicolas Otamendi cost nearly as much as Lyon's starting XI but watched on from the bench as a 35-year-old converted midfielder Fernandinho and 19-year-old Eric Garcia, who Guardiola admitted last week does not want to extend his contract at the club, started in a back three. While Guardiola shouldered most of the blame, a familiar cocktail of defensive errors, missed chances and VAR controversy also did for City. Lyon's pivotal second goal was allowed to stand despite claims for a foul on Aymeric Laporte by Moussa Dembele. Goalkeeper Ederson also should have done better for both Dembele's goals in the final 11 minutes, but in between Raheem Sterling inexplicably did not add to his 31 goals this season by firing over with the goal gaping. ""Different year, same stuff,"" said Kevin De Bruyne, whose goal brought City level at 1-1 midway through the second half. ""We need to learn, it's not good enough."" City will at least have the chance to try again next year after beating UEFA in the courts to overturn a two-year ban from European competition. But time is running out for Guardiola to deliver on what he was brought to Manchester to do. The 49-year-old has one more year left on his contract and will for the first time in his managerial career start a fifth season with the same club in a few weeks time. For all his domestic success with six major trophies in four years in England, City had already won the Premier League title twice before Guardiola arrived in the Abu Dhabi era. Winning the Champions League is what his paymasters really want and they need Guardiola to get out of his own head to do it."
30,16/08/2020,00:50,Lyon coach Garcia sets 'no limits' for his side after Man City success,"Lyon coach Rudi Garcia said his side were ""not setting any limits"" after their stunning win over Manchester City on Saturday set up an unlikely Champions League semi-final against Bayern Munich.","The French team defeated Pep Guardiola's men 3-1 in the 'Final Eight' in Lisbon with a late brace from substitute Moussa Dembele deciding the game after Kevin De Bruyne's goal had cancelled out Maxwel Cornet's opener. Their victory against much-fancied City comes after they ousted Italian champions Juventus on away goals in the previous round. But they will now have to see off an ominous Bayern team on Wednesday if they are to make the final. ""We know who we are coming up against next,"" said Garcia. ""We eliminated a Juventus side who were one of the contenders to win the Champions League, and a Manchester City side who were contenders to win the Champions League. ""Bayern will be exactly the same, but on the basis of what the players have shown logically we can still hope to get through another round and that is what we are going to prepare to try to do."" Lyon finished seventh in the curtailed French season, a desperately poor showing from France's second-richest club meaning they have to now win the Champions League just to qualify for Europe again in the new campaign. They have appeared in continental competition in each of the last 23 seasons, but they have never gone beyond the semi-finals of the Champions League. That has happened just once before, when they lost to Bayern in the last four in 2010. ""Confidence is growing within the squad, but we will be outsiders and once again it will need an exploit from us to go through,"" said Garcia. ""When you are in the last four we can say that we deserve to be there and if we get to the final we really will deserve it."" The former Lille, Roma and Marseille coach was appointed last October and has never won over Lyon supporters, but this result can only have improved his standing. ""I do this job to experience these moments but they are very rare in a career,"" he said. ""Tonight is magnificent but it doesn't give us anything, there is no title or place in Europe. Now we need to recuperate, savour this and let it sink in."""
31,16/08/2020,00:07,Lyon stun Guardiola's Man City to reach Champions League semis,"Moussa Dembele came off the bench to score two late goals as Lyon caused another Champions League sensation on Saturday, dumping out Pep Guardiola's Manchester City with a 3-1 quarter-final win in Lisbon.","City had looked on course to come back and win the tie behind closed doors at the Estadio Jose Alvalade after Kevin De Bruyne's goal midway through the second half had cancelled out Maxwel Cornet's first-half opener. However, Dembele put Lyon back ahead in the 79th minute and then capitalised on a shocking miss by Raheem Sterling to clinch the victory three minutes from the end. Against all expectations, a team who finished seventh in the curtailed French season, and had played just two competitive games since early March, now find themselves through to a Champions League semi-final on Wednesday against Bayern Munich. That, surely, will be a step too far for Rudi Garcia's team but then again nobody expected them to eliminate Juventus in the last round, never mind knock out City here. ""We are still in it, which means we have a great team,"" former Celtic striker Dembele told French television channel RMC Sport. ""We are taking it game by game, not getting carried away. We will try to be ready for Bayern."" Guardiola's team had been warned about Lyon, losing at home and then drawing away against the French club in last season's Champions League. But that was almost two years ago now and Lyon had lost several key players since then. This, a day after Bayern's 8-2 demolition of Barcelona, is a seismic shock and a hammer blow to the ambitions of City under Guardiola. Their wait for European glory will go on, with this a third consecutive quarter-final exit. ""It is what it is. Maybe one day we are going to break through the quarter-finals. We are not able to do it now, with these incredible guys, but we are going to try in the future,"" Guardiola said. He was brought to the Etihad Stadium to deliver the Champions League, but he has not managed to equal the club's best performance to date in the competition, a semi-final appearance in 2016, just before he was appointed. And so, a year after Liverpool beat Tottenham Hotspur in an all-English final, there will be no English representative in the semi-finals in the Portuguese capital. Instead both ties will be Franco-German duels, with Paris Saint-Germain facing RB Leipzig before Bayern meet Lyon in a repeat of the 2010 semi-finals. Guardiola had set his team up with a three-man defence, as Fernandinho and Aymeric Laporte were joined by the young Spaniard Eric Garcia. Phil Foden dropped out of their line-up. City created little in the first half and were caught out by a long ball over the top as Lyon took the lead. Garcia raced back to tackle Karl Toko-Ekambi but Cornet was quickest to the loose ball and, with Ederson off his line, curled a low shot first-time into the corner of the net to keep up his remarkable record against these opponents -- the wing-back scored three times against City in last season's two meetings. De Bruyne appeared the most likely to make something happen for City and threatened from free-kicks after the restart, as City turned up the heat following the introduction of Riyad Mahrez in place of Fernandinho. The equaliser duly arrived in the 69th minute as Mahrez clipped a ball forward towards Sterling and he cut it back from the byline to De Bruyne, the Belgian arriving unmarked at the edge of the box to sidefoot home. Few would have bet against City going on to win the game from there. Lyon had offered nothing going forward in the second half and coach Garcia even decided to take off Memphis Depay, who had been anonymous. But it proved an inspired decision as his replacement Dembele latched onto Houssem Aouar's through ball to race through on goal and beat Ederson. City expected the effort to be disallowed following a VAR review but the Dutch officials let it stand, and Lyon were back in front. Still they should have been pegged back again, but Sterling somehow put the ball over with the goal gaping having been teed up by Ilkay Gundogan. Lyon went straight downfield and sealed a famous victory as Dembele converted the loose ball after Ederson had saved from Aouar."
32,15/08/2020,23:34,De Bruyne admits City 'not good enough' in Champions League,Kevin De Bruyne lamented Manchester City's failure to learn form their mistakes in the Champions League after crashing out in the quarter-finals for the third straight season after a shock 3-1 defeat to Lyon in Lisbon.,"A familiar cocktail of defensive errors, missed chances and VAR controversy did for Pep Guardiola's side with the Catalan coach also underfire for another surprise team selection in the knockout stages of the Champions League. ""Different year, same stuff,"" said De Bruyne, who scored City's equaliser 21 minutes from time. ""We need to learn, it's not good enough."" The Belgian levelled only after Guardiola had resorted to his usual 4-3-3 formation and City looked more like their old selves in the second half after Maxwel Cornet put Lyon in front at the break. However, Moussa Dembele's strike to restore the French side's lead was allowed to stand despite a VAR check for a trip on Aymeric Laporte before Raheem Sterling incredibly fired over with the goal gaping to bring City back on level terms. An error from goalkeeper Ederson then allowed Dembele to tap home and seal Lyon a semi-final meeting with Guardiola's old club Bayern Munich. ""I've no idea, I've not seen it back so whatever they decide, they decide. I'm not going to blame that, I think we should have done better,"" added De Bruyne on Lyon's second goal. ""The first half wasn't good enough, we know that we started slow. The second half we played really well, we came back for the 1-1 and had a couple of chances then the 2-1, 3-1 ends the game. It's a shame for us to go out that way."""
33,14/08/2020,03:44,"Lyon, France's faded force, can still roar in Europe","Lyon's days as France's dominant team have become a distant memory with Paris Saint-Germain's emergence, but their European pedigree shows they should not be underestimated in Saturday's Champions League quarter-final against Manchester City.","Really, just being at the 'Final Eight' in Lisbon is a bonus for Rudi Garcia's team. They produced one of their famous European results by eliminating Italian champions Juventus in the last round on away goals, setting up the free hit of a one-off tie against Pep Guardiola's side. City know from recent experience that Lyon are not to be taken lightly. The sides clashed in the group stage last season, with Lyon inflicting a rare home defeat on Guardiola's team when they won 2-1 at the Etihad Stadium. They followed that by drawing 2-2 back in France. Nevertheless, that was close to two years ago now, and Lyon's team in the latter encounter included three key players who have since departed. Captain Nabil Fekir, part of France's World Cup-winning squad in 2018, was sold to Betis, while midfielder Tanguy Ndombele left for Tottenham Hotspur and left-back Ferland Mendy is now at Real Madrid. They also have a different coach. Bruno Genesio is now working in China and, after a brief experiment with former Brazil defender Sylvinho, Garcia is at the helm. Yet his past connection with Marseille meant he was never a popular appointment and poor performances in the league have done nothing to endear him to supporters. Lyon, France's second-richest club, were seventh when the Ligue 1 season ended early in late April, with 10 rounds of matches unplayed, because of the coronavirus pandemic. They returned to action with a defeat on penalties to PSG in the League Cup final in July, meaning an eight-year trophy drought goes on and that Lyon have to win the Champions League if they are to be back in Europe again next season. A first campaign without European football in 24 years therefore looks likely, with Bayern Munich or Barcelona in their way in the semi-final should they see off City. ""We wanted to get to the 'Final Eight' in Lisbon and here we are,"" said Garcia, after ousting Juventus. ""We are the outsiders now but that suits us."" Only once before have Lyon made it beyond this stage: in 2009/10 they beat Liverpool at Anfield in the group stage, stunned Real Madrid in the last 16 and then defeated Bordeaux before losing to Bayern in the semis. Before that, in the middle of their run of seven successive domestic league titles, Lyon lost in the quarter-finals three years running between 2004 and 2006. Then, Brazilian midfielder Juninho was their star player, frequently scoring brilliant free-kicks. Now he is their sporting director, and it was thanks to him that Lyon unearthed a new Brazilian gem earlier this year. Bruno Guimaraes is a classy midfielder, just 22 but capable of running games, as he did in the 1-0 win over Juventus just before football stopped due to the pandemic. Juninho believes his compatriot will become ""one of the best in the world"". Lyon have other potential match-winners, notably Dutch forward Memphis Depay. They are also confident a corner has been turned since the restart. ""The players know we have a talented team but that before they were not playing well together,"" said Juninho. ""But with the right mentality they can do great things."" Beating City would fall into that category, and they have done that before."
34,09/08/2020,12:48,Lyon's Aulas revives grudge over early end to Ligue 1 season,"Two days after his club eliminated Juventus in the Champions League, Lyon president Jean-Michel Aulas returned to his grievance over the early end of the French league saying he ""would not forgive.""","In an interview published on Sunday, Aulas told Lyon daily Le Progres, that the decision to halt the 2019-20 Ligue 1 season was ""a profound injustice"" and ""an absolute scandal"". ""We're in seventh place with 10 games to go,"" he said. ""There were still 30 points at stake. This stop is an absolute scandal."" When the league was halted because of the coronavirus pandemic, Lyon were nine points behind Lille who took the last Champions League place and one point behind Reims who gained the last guaranteed Europa League spot. After losing the League Cup final on penalties to Paris on July 31, Lyon's only chance to play Europe next season is to win the Champions League. They kept their hopes alive by edging Juventus on away goals to reach the last eight. They play Manchester City in a one-off quarterfinal on August 15 in Lisbon. ""There's still a one in a million chance, so we have to play it. It's a difficult route. We have to play Manchester City who have just eliminated Real Madrid,"" he said. ""Only a big stroke of luck can overturn (this) injustice."" ""The league has done everything wrong,"" Aulas said. ""They did not have the right, when there was so much at stake, to stop a league when others did not stop. It's a profound injustice and I won't forgive it."" ""The wound is still there,"" he said. ""We are very angry."" Aulas estimated that the early end to the league had already cost his club 100 million euros (118 million dollars) with further losses to come. ""Because if we're not in Europe, we'll lose another 80 million euros, and that's terrible for a club. There have been colossal mistakes by the league,"" he said."
35,07/08/2020,23:14,Lyon hold off Juventus,Lyon qualified for the quarter-finals of the Champions League on Friday despite losing 2-1 in Turin.,"A goal up after winning February's first leg, French side Lyon will face Manchester City at the final tournament in Lisbon after drawing 2-2 on aggregate and going through on away goals. Lyon squeezed past the Italian champions thanks to Memphis Depay's 12th-minute penalty which put Rudi Garcia's side two goals ahead in the tie and left Juve with a mountain to climb. Needing to score three unanswered goals in order to go through, Cristiano Ronaldo tried his best to drag the Italian champions over the line. He levelled the scores on the night with a penalty of his own with two minutes left in the opening period before crashing a second home on the hour mark. However Juve performed poorly and Lyon managed to hold on to set up a clash with Pep Guardiola's City, who put out 13-time winners Real Madrid, on August 15. Despite their nine consecutive Italian league titles in a row, Juventus could not get past a French side that finished seventh in Ligue 1 this season. Ronaldo spearheaded the Juventus attack as the five-time Champions League winner pushed for the last eight spot in his native Portugal. Lyon's early breakthrough came after Rodrigo Bentancur was judged to have fouled Houssem Aouar, and Depay calmly slotted past Wojciech Szczesny from the spot. Juventus had dominated play early with Federico Bernardeschi dribbling through the Lyon defense after 19 minutes before Marcelo deflected the shot clear of goal. Ronaldo sent a header wide after 21 minutes with Lopes denying a curling Ronaldo free kick, but he drew Juve level from the spot just before the break when Depay handballed a Miralem Pjanic free-kick. The Portuguese then scored a second long range effort, with Leonardo Bonucci missing a chance minutes later. Paulo Dybala came on with 20 minutes to go but failed to lift the Italians, with the Argentine who had been carrying a thigh injury, limping off quarter of an hour later. Ronaldo missed to win the tie when he sent a header wide, ending Juventus' hopes of a first Champions League title since 1996. Juve, who had won only two of their last eight league games, end the season in the worst possible way, exhausted by the accumulation of matches at the end of a season interrupted for three months because of coronavirus. The Ligue 1 season did not finish with Lyon's only hope of qualifying for next year's Champions League now resting on winning the 2020 edition."
36,06/08/2020,19:04,Sarri insists Juve future not riding on Lyon result,"Juventus coach Maurizio Sarri dismissed talk that his future would depend on the result of Friday's Champions League last 16, second leg match against Lyon in Turin.","Juve trail the Ligue 1 side following their 1-0 defeat in France six months ago before the coronavirus lockdown. ""I don't think my future is riding on this game,"" said Sarri as Juventus look to keep their hopes of a first European title since 1996 on track. ""Thinking this way you make the club directors look like amateurs. ""I think I'm dealing with high level directors. They will decide whether to continue or to change. But it doesn't depend on a single game."" Juventus won a ninth league title in a row but have shown a dip in form after the coronavirus lockdown with just two wins in their last eight matches. ""We are happy to have won possibly the most difficult Serie A in history,"" continued Sarri with matches played without fans in the Allianz Stadium. ""The away match was played with fans and the return without. That's how it is,"" said Sarri. ""A Champions League match without the public will not be pleasant. ""But the important thing is to get to Portugal and play the final eight as it would mean joining the world's elite."" Argentina forward Paulo Dybala remains uncertain with a thigh injury but Cristiano Ronaldo has been training ""with intensity and strength,"" said Sarri. ""We will try to recover Dybala up until tomorrow morning. At the moment he's still training with the medical staff,"" added the former Chelsea coach. ""Ronaldo is training in the right manner, yesterday he scored an excellent goal in training. ""He played many games in a short time, he rested a little and now he has trained with intensity and strength."""
37,01/08/2020,13:28,PSG look forward to Champions League challenge after cup final wins,That match will be played on August 12 as a one-off tie behind closed doors in Lisbon.,"PSG have also had a handful of friendly matches, but Atalanta may be in better shape having resumed their Serie A campaign in June. They only finish the season this weekend. Herrera's team, meanwhile, looked sluggish for much of Friday's final, although the suffocating heat was partly responsible. They missed Kylian Mbappe, who was crocked in the French Cup final a week earlier, suffering an ankle injury that could rule him out against Atalanta. In his absence, Mauro Icardi was poor through the middle of the Paris attack and they only claimed victory thanks to Pablo Sarabia's sudden-death penalty in the shoot-out. ""We are optimistic for Kylian. We saw that he can walk now, he is young and he is a real professional,"" said Herrera. ""He really wants to play (against Atalanta) and is working every day, morning and night. ""Of course his presence is important and we hope he will play."" Mbappe is not the only worry -- defensive duo Marquinhos and Thiago Silva came off with cramp, while full-back Layvin Kurzawa hobbled off in the second half. In any case, PSG claimed their fourth domestic treble in six years, underlining the extent of their domination of French football under Qatari ownership. Lyon used to be top dogs but this defeat saw their silverware drought go on. They have not won a trophy since the French Cup in 2012, a year after the Qataris arrived and changed the footballing landscape in the country. Rudi Garcia's team, who had Brazilian defender Rafael sent off late in extra time, were a disappointing seventh when the league season was curtailed and will miss out on European football next season for the first time in 24 years. Unless, that is, they can go on and win the Champions League in Lisbon on August 23. OL visit Juventus next Friday in their long-delayed last 16 second leg, defending a 1-0 lead from the first leg. ""We will need to do better to score in Turin but this is a good base for us to work on,"" insisted Garcia. ""It is important that we keep our heads up and keep in mind the things we did well in order to go on and qualify for the Champions League quarter-finals."" If they do see off Juventus, they will face Manchester City or Real Madrid in the last eight."
38,30/07/2020,19:54,PSG target domestic treble while hoping for Mbappe 'miracle',"Paris Saint-Germain can belatedly wrap up another domestic treble on Friday when they face Lyon in the final of the French League Cup, but their build-up to the game has been overshadowed by Kylian Mbappe's ankle injury.","The World Cup-winning superstar was crocked in last Friday's French Cup final against Saint-Etienne in the first competitive game on French soil since the coronavirus-imposed shutdown in March. Mbappe was left with a sprained right ankle after a crunching challenge from Saint-Etienne's Loic Perrin and looks certain to miss the game that really counts for the Qatar-owned club, the Champions League quarter-final against Atalanta on August 12. On Thursday, PSG coach Thomas Tuchel admitted it would take ""a miracle"" for the 21-year-old to recover in time for that game in Lisbon. Angel Di Maria has already been ruled out of that match because of suspension, and asked if there was any hope for Mbappe, Tuchel said: ""Yes, always, but it's going to be tight. Every day counts for us to produce a miracle."" PSG were handed a third straight Ligue 1 title by virtue of being top of the table when the season was ended in April with 10 rounds of matches unplayed because of the health crisis. They came out of the long shutdown to win their fifth French Cup in six years by beating Saint-Etienne 1-0 thanks to an early Neymar goal. That game was played in front of just 2,800 spectators inside the 80,000-seat Stade de France due to restrictions on gatherings. Friday's game against Lyon will go ahead in front of a similarly limited number of fans. Postponed in early April, it will be the last ever final of an unloved competition, albeit one which PSG have also dominated, with five successive victories -- and eight overall -- before Strasbourg won it last year. For both teams, it is a last chance to prepare in a competitive environment before resuming their Champions League campaigns. PSG head to Lisbon for the final stages after their win over Borussia Dortmund in the last 16 in March. Meanwhile, Lyon have to go to Italy on August 7 to face Juventus defending a 1-0 lead from the first leg of their last-16 tie played in February. Both clubs fear being at a disadvantage given all their Champions League rivals returned to complete their domestic seasons while France opted not to. Juventus and Atalanta play their final games in Serie A this weekend. However, Tuchel said the final cannot be used to prepare his team to face Atalanta. ""It is not possible to prepare tactically for Atalanta because I don't know any team that plays the way they do,"" said the German. ""The only thing we can prepare is our own mindset."" ""Being without Kylian has a big influence, that's clear. I hope we can find the solution."" The game will be played in searing heat, with temperatures in the French capital forecast to reach 40 degrees Celsius on Friday. Lyon are chasing a first piece of silverware in eight years and have extra motivation to win the trophy. Having failed to qualify for Europe next season via the league, Rudi Garcia's team have to beat PSG to secure a place in the qualifying rounds of the Europa League. If they fall short, they will need to win the Champions League in Lisbon on August 23 to feature in continental competition again next season. ""This is a terrific opportunity to win a trophy,"" said Garcia. ""PSG might be a level above us but we have a top-class team too and one that is also in a position to qualify for the Champions League quarter-finals. There is only positive pressure on us."" as-yk/pb <org>BORUSSIA DORTMUND</org> <org>JUVENTUS FOOTBALL CLUB</org>"

Maurizio Sarri's side are scheduled to take on Lyon in Turin in exactly two weeks' time on August 7. They trail Rudi Garcia's side 1-0 after February's first leg in France. Costa is an important member of Sarri's squad despite inconsistent displays and fitness issues, the 29-year-old often being brought on as an impact substitute in the second half of matches."

The French league (LFP) brought a premature end to the campaign in late April due to the coronavirus pandemic. The decision to call the season off with 10 rounds of matches unplayed followed an announcement by the French government that football could not restart because of the health crisis. The judge also ordered the LFP to re-examine with the French football federation the proposed format for the top division next season, which could feature 22 teams in Ligue 1 -- two more than usual. Lyon, who have reached this season's Champions League last 16, were left seventh in the table and outside the European qualification places when the season was halted. Paris Saint-Germain were declared champions for the seventh time in eight years."

Toko Ekambi, who has scored three goals in 30 international appearances, netted twice in 12 games during his loan stint at Groupama Stadium.

Lyon, who have reached this season's Champions League last 16, were left seventh in the standings and outside the European qualification places. An administrative court in Paris had already rejected an appeal from the club. The judge of the Paris administrative court ""has logically retained... that the decisions taken by the league's board of directors on April 30 could only be challenged before the Council of State,"" the LFP said in a statement on Friday. Lyon took objection to the LFP expressing satisfaction at the decision, replying via a statement of their own that ""the administrative tribunal did not rule on the merits of the case"". ""It in no way changes the nature and the basis of the action brought"" by the club, Lyon said, warning they would take the matter to the Council of State on Monday. Amiens, who are contesting their relegation to Ligue 2 and whose initial appeal was also turned down last week by the Paris court, indicated their plans to turn to the Council of State as well. ah-fjt/ama/mw/iwd"
44,22/05/2020,20:31,Court rejects appeals against ending French football season,A Paris court on Friday rejected an appeal from relegated French Ligue 1 clubs Toulouse and Amiens as well as rivals Lyon who claimed the season had wrongly been abandoned last month.,"While Toulouse and Amiens were both relegated, Lyon fell short of European qualification when time was called on the campaign due to the coronavirus. When the LFP, which runs the top two divisions in French football, decided late last month to call an end to the season, there were still 10 of the 38 scheduled rounds of games to play. That was after the French government ruled out any prospect of matches returning before August. The decision confirmed Paris Saint-Germain as champions and also meant that the bottom two, Amiens and Toulouse, were condemned to Ligue 2. Lorient and Lens have been promoted in their place. The judge of the Paris administrative court ""has logically retained...that the decisions taken by the league's board of directors on April 30 could only be challenged before the Council of State,"" said the LFP in a statement on Friday. Lyon insisted they were not pushing so hard for a restart of the season for ""OL's exclusive interests"" and claimed that French football could suffer short-term losses of 900 million euros ($987 million). Amiens say they felt the ruling was ""unjust"" after the season was ended early as they were just four points from sagfety. ""The decision is a punishment from the league. It is unjust,"" the club's president, Bernard Joannin, said on Tuesday. Toulouse were 17 points from safety when the season was suspended in March. ""There were more than 30 points in play,"" Toulouse president Olivier Sadran said this week."

Lyon, who have reached this season's Champions League last 16, were left seventh in the standings and outside the European qualification places. ""Today, it is not only about OL, but quite simply about the future of French football,"" the seven-time champions said in a lengthy statement. ""There is still time, until May 25, to back off and avoid a huge rout for the French championship."" Lyon insisted they were not pushing so hard for a restart of the season for ""OL's exclusive interests"" and claimed that French football could suffer short-term losses of 900 million euros ($987 million). ""How can we fight with our foreign competitors who, in the vast majority, chose to wait cautiously to restart their championship?,"" continued the statement. ""How can we prevent the gap from widening further between French football and all the other major European countries?"" The German Bundesliga is set to resume next weekend, although the Dutch season has been abandoned. Ligue 1's revenue in 2018 was barely half the Bundesliga's 3.2 billion euros, according to UEFA.

""Lyon reserve the possibility of trying to appeal against this decision and claiming damages and interest,"" the club said in a statement.

As it stands, Wednesday's two last 16, second legs between Bayern Munich and Chelsea and Barcelona and Napoli are still set to go ahead behind closed doors. However, UEFA is to have a crisis meeting on Tuesday with representatives from all 55 national associations and club and player bodies to decide how national leagues, European competitions and Euro 2020 should proceed.

The LFP said the two league matches scheduled for that weekend, but postponed because of the final, were now back on. PSG will face Metz and Lyon play Nimes behind closed doors on either April 4 or 5. The final was due to be the last of its kind because the organisers have been unable to find a domestic broadcaster willing to pay to show the competition next season.

The defeat Lyon ends a five-match unbeaten run that included an impressive 1-0 win over Juventus in the Champions League and the weekend's triumph over local rivals Saint-Etienne. ""It was a solid, serious display full of concentration,"" said PSG coach Thomas Tuchel. ""After the Dortmund match (lost 2-1 in Germany), Mbappe has responded brilliantly. He uses his speed so intelligently ... he is in good form."" Mbappe equalised for the away side with a simple tap-in just three minutes after Martin Terrier had given the raucous home fans hope with a neat 11th-minute opener. The 21-year-old was also key to PSG taking the lead in the 64th minute from the penalty spot. Collecting the ball out on the left wing, he casually saw off two Lyon defenders before floating over a cross to fellow forward Edinson Cavani, who controlled the ball only for Marcal to then handle before the Uruguay striker could let his shot go. Neymar slotted home the subsequent spot-kick after confirmation of the handball by VAR, while Marcal had to leave the field after being handed his second red card. ""I prefer to say nothing about the penalty,"" said Lyon boss Rudi Garcia, who side face PSG in the League Cup final next month. ""When you are 10 against 11 playing such a strong team it's no longer a contest."" Mbappe made sure of the Parisian's visit to the Stade de France next month with a superb solo effort with 20 minutes left, embarrassing Bruno Guimaraes and Marcelo before calmly slotting past Anthony Lopes. Pablo Sarabia added a fourth with a stinging low strike 11 minutes later, and Mbappe completed his hat-trick in stoppage time, tapping home Neymar's cross after good work on the left from the world's most expensive footballer.

Cameroon striker Toko Ekambi, who joined on loan this week from Villarreal until the end of the season, sealed the victory six minutes later as Lyon climbed up to fifth in Ligue 1. Toko Ekambi came on as a first-half substitute after a scary incident involving France Under-21 forward Martin Terrier. Terrier was stretchered off after fainting on the pitch, but Lyon said at half-time that the player had regained consciousness. Sixteen-year-old Rayan Cherki also made a brief appearance off the bench, having scored twice and provided two assists in a 4-3 French Cup win over Nantes last weekend. Nantes and Bordeaux honoured Argentine forward Sala before an emotional Derby de l'Atlantique at the Stade de la Beaujoire. Bordeaux won 1-0 courtesy of a late goal by Jimmy Briand as Nantes played most the second half with 10 men after the dismissal of Andrei Girotto. The 28-year-old Sala was killed last January when the small plane taking him to join Cardiff City after being bought from Nantes for £15 million ($19.5 million, 17.6 million euros) crashed off the Channel island of Guernsey. Nantes wore a special white and pale blue shirt inspired by Argentina while Bordeaux's kit featured an Argentine flag beneath the club crest flanked by the player's initials. Proceeds from the sales of the strips will go to the two Argentine clubs Sala played for in his youth. A portrait of Sala was also displayed in the centre circle during the warm-up and there was a minute's applause ahead of kick-off. Supporters laid flowers outside the ground and broke out into a song commemorating Sala in the ninth minute, representing the shirt number worn by the player which has since been retired by Nantes. Sala left his homeland to join Bordeaux in 2012 and then played for Nantes between 2015 and 2019. League leaders Paris Saint-Germain visit last year's runners-up Lille in Sunday's late game. PSG could stretch their advantage over Marseille to 10 points with victory, although Thomas Tuchel's side lost 5-1 on their last trip to Lille in April.

Lyon said at half-time that Terrier ""was the victim earlier of a fainting incident"". The club added he was doing ""better and has regained consciousness"". France Under-21 international Terrier was replaced by Karl Toko Ekambi after the health scare midway through the first half. Toko Ekambi scored the final goal in a 3-0 victory in his first appearance for Lyon. ""I am very happy with the victory but we were thinking of Martin. It's complicated when a teammate suffers such a problem,"" said Toko Ekambi."

Toko Ekambi will provide Lyon coach Rudi Garcia with another attacking option after winger Memphis Depay was ruled out until the end of the season after suffering a knee injury. Lyon will pay four million euros ($4.44 million) as a loan fee, with the deal including an option to make Toko Ekambi's stay permanent for 11.5 million euros. The forward scored 17 goals in the 2017/18 Ligue 1 season for Angers, before netting 18 times in all competitions for Spanish outfit Villarreal last term. Lyon face Lille in the French League Cup semi-finals on Tuesday, take on Nice in the French Cup last 16 later this month and are also still in the Champions League, where they will next play Juventus."

Lyon boss Rudi Garcia, who handed Cherki his professional debut against Dijon in October, said it was the youngster's all-round commitment that most pleased him. ""We know he's a boy who has the ability to decide a match. Of course that pleased me,"" said Garcia. ""What delighted me though was his overall game and how he played with his team-mates, the intelligence of his choices and his defensive runs. If he continues likes that he will be able to keep making progress."" Garcia must also try and temper expectations for a burgeoning talent who has drawn comparisons to fellow Lyon academy graduates Karim Benzema and Hatem Ben Arfa. ""My role is also to lower those levels because everyone is going to praise him to the skies, but he's only 16 years old,"" said Garcia. ""It's going to be a great danger if he stops listening to me, no longer works hard and thinks he's already made it, when he's still got a long way to go."" Nantes counterpart Gourcuff admitted he didn't know too much about Cherki but was quickly impressed by his breakout performance. ""He has a big future. He's a very, very good footballer,"" Gourcuff said succinctly. It was only Cherki's eighth appearance for Lyon, and just a second start, but one that could prompt Garcia to fast-track his path to the first team, with Memphis Depay and Jeff Reine-Adelaide long-term absentees. ""We see him at training. Perhaps he surprised you but not us,"" said Lyon goalkeeper Anthony Lopes. Cherki, who became the club's youngest goalscorer the previous round in a 7-0 rout of Bourg-en-Bresse, was quick to deflect to the acclaim. ""It's thanks to my team-mates that I had this kind of match,"" he said. ""You can't just dwell on the statistics, it's the whole team. Now we need to take care of the fixtures to come."" Lyon host Lille in the French League Cup semi-finals in midweek before welcoming bottom side Toulouse on January 26, when Cherki could make his first Ligue 1 start."

Samuel Grandsir gave Brest hope with a tidy finish five minutes from time but Jean Lucas made sure Lyon joined Reims in the last four with a firm 20-yard drive in stoppage time. Reims eliminated holders Strasbourg on Tuesday after winning 4-2 on penalties following a goalless draw. Record eight-time champions Paris Saint-Germain host Saint-Etienne later on Wednesday while Lille take on Amiens. The competition, which includes all the clubs from France's top two divisions and a handful of teams from the third tier, will be suspended indefinitely at the end of this season. The draw for the last four takes place on Thursday."
57,15/12/2019,20:56,Depay's Euro 2020 at risk after potential cruciate ligament tear,Memphis Depay's bid to play for the Netherlands in Euro 2020 could be in doubt after Lyon coach Rudi Garcia revealed he may have torn the cruciate ligaments in his left knee during Sunday's 1-0 Ligue 1 defeat to Rennes.,"Depay was hurt in a clash with Hamari Traore in the 29th minute but was only substituted at half-time and Garcia feared the worst for his star attacker, who has scored eight times in his last eight matches in all competitions for Lyon, including the goal that took them to the last 16 of the Champions League. ""We will wait to know more but it really doesn't look good for Memphis. We think it's the cruciate (ligaments),"" Garcia said after a defeat which keeps his side eighth in Ligue 1. ""I hope we get news contrary to what we think in the hope that it is not too serious."" Depay has been a key player for a revitalised Dutch team, scoring eight times and making eight assists as the Oranje qualified for their first major tournament since finishing third at the 2014 World Cup. However, should the injury be confirmed, he faces months on the sidelines and no guarantee of being fit for next summer's Euros. Lyon failed to follow up on the dramatic 2-2 draw with RB Leipzig that took them to the next round of the Champions League as they were booed off following their dismal defeat to Rennes, who moved into the European places with the win. Youngster Eduardo Camavinga shot Rennes into fourth place with a late strike that gave Rennes their fourth league win in a row. The 17-year-old's first ever Ligue 1 goal in his debut season in the French top flight moved his side to 30 points in the Europa League spot, just one point away from the Champions League places. The game looked to be heading for a goalless draw when Rennes goalkeeper Edouard Mendy pulled off a sensational double save with six minutes left to deny Maxence Caqueret and Bertrand Traore. However, Camavinga stunned the home fans after 89 minutes when he collected Romain Del Castillo's pass and slalomed past Rafael and Joachim Andersen before squeezing his shot past Anthony Lopes."

Lyon's Rudi Garcia made two changes from the side who beat Nimes on Friday as winger Martin Terrier and midfielder Lucas Tousart started. Leipzig coach Julian Nagelsmann, safe in the knowledge his side were guaranteed top spot, brought in five new faces following their convincing weekend victory over Hoffenheim. Forsberg opened the scoring after nine minutes as he slotted in from the spot after referee Anthony Taylor checked an Anthony Lopes foul on Yussuf Poulsen with VAR. Naglesmann's men doubled their advantage 24 minutes later after Tousart felled Christopher Nkunku in the box. Germany forward Werner converted the penalty for his 20th goal in all competitions for the season. Lyon's best chance to halve the deficit in the first half fell to Moussa Dembele two minutes into injury time. His powerful deflected effort smashed against the crossbar and the Germans cleared the danger. Houssem Aouar gave Lyon reason to believe five minutes into the second half with a curling lob over Peter Gulacsi. Dembele then could have made up for his earlier miss on 63 minutes but he failed to make contact with a low driving Terrier cross. Dutch international Depay claimed the crucial goal with eight minutes remaining when his low shot beat Gulacsi at his back post. Substitute Konrad Laimer could have knocked Lyon out of Europe in the closing stages but looped his effort over the crossbar. Benfica will parachute into the last 32 of the Europa League after pipping Zenit to third place in the group following victory in Lisbon."

Midfielder Jeff Reine-Adelaide scored the winner as Lyon bounced back from the midweek defeat at Zenit Saint Petersburg which left them third in their Champions League group. ""We came home at 5am from Zenit on Thursday so it's normal for my players to have cramps,"" said Garcia. ""I love it. We were really tired. It's a victory for the group today. ""I really liked the self-sacrifice, the togetherness. We were pretty shaken in the first half and in the second we were able to put our foot on the ball."" Youssouf Fofana drilled in the opening goal to put Strasbourg ahead midway through the first half, but Maxwel Cornet's fine left-footed finish five minutes before the break drew the visitors level. The 21-year-old Reine-Adelaide climbed highest at the back post to head home his third goal of the season with 15 minutes remaining. Lyon still trail league leaders Paris Saint-Germain, who visit Monaco on Sunday, by 11 points, with second-placed Marseille five points adrift of the reigning champions after their 2-1 win over Brest on Friday. Third-placed Angers let a lead slip as they fell to a 3-1 loss at Patrick Vieira's Nice. Danish forward Kasper Dolberg scored for the second straight game for Nice as Angers saw their four-match unbeaten run in the league ended. Josh Maja scored his third Ligue 1 goal for Bordeaux since signing from Sunderland in January, but the away side conceded an injury-time equaliser to Boulaye Dia in a 1-1 draw at Reims. Last season's runners-up Lille moved up to seventh as Victor Osimhen's penalty in first-half stoppage time saw them past Dijon 1-0."

Lyon are now third behind Zenit, level with the Russians on seven points, ahead of their final group match on December 10 against leaders Leipzig, who are three points clear at the top and assured of a place in the knockout round. ""Lyon are a really good team. But we were prepared well and did what we had to,"" Zenit midfielder Magomed Ozdoev told UEFA.com. ""Now it's all about the match in Lisbon and we will be ready for it."" Bundesliga side Leipzig's last-gasp 2-2 draw with Benfica later in the day gave them a place in the last 16 for the first time leaving Lyon and Zenit in pursuit of the second qualifyng spot. ""It's not over, we still have our last match to play and we're supporting Benfica (who face Zenit in the last round),"" Garcia said. ""What is certain is that we have to beat Leipzig, who I think are the best team in the group."" Zenit coach Sergei Semak kept faith in the starting lineup from the weekend's 2-1 league victory over Rubin Kazan, with Artem Dzyuba who scored that winner in that game leading the attack. Garcia, who replaced the sacked Sylvinho in October, was without injured midfielder Thiago Mendes and ill winger Martin Terrier after beating Nice on Saturday as 16-year-old attacking midfielder Rayan Cherki was named on the bench. The best of the early chances fell to Sardar Azmoun on 35 minutes after Daler Kuzayev and Joachim Andersen were shown yellow cards in the opening half an hour. Iran forward Azmoun, broke through the French defence but his chipped shot hit the post before he was brought down by Anthony Lopes, with VAR deciding against awarding a penalty. Dzyuba went one better than Azmoun seven minutes later to claim a lead for the Russian outfit. The Russia international headed in from a Douglas Santos corner as Lyon protested with referee Daniele Orsato for Dzyuba's tussle with Marcelo in the penalty area. Captain Leo Dubois and fellow-wing back Marcal were shown yellow cards by Orsato for their complaints. Semak's men controlled a lacklustre second-half and Ozdoev made sure of all three points with his third goal of the season in the 84th minute."
61,25/11/2019,21:27,Lyon in talks to buy Megan Rapinoe's team Reign FC,"American superstar Megan Rapinoe's team Reign FC are in negotiations to be bought out by the owners of current women's European champions Lyon, both teams said on Monday.","OL Group, which owns Lyon's men's and women's teams, said in a statement that the move will consolidate their position as the ""top women's football group in the world"". Lyon president Jean-Michel Aulas unveiled at the club's most recent AGM plans to expand his team's brand in both the United States and China and earmarked a budget for the purchase of an American franchise. Based in Tacoma near Seattle, Reign FC will start their eighth season in the American National Women's Soccer League next term and have on their roster FIFA's women's world player of the year Megan Rapinoe. Rapinoe, 34, was joint top scorer with six goals at this year's women's World Cup -- won by the United States -- and bagged the Golden Boot. She also won the Golden Ball for the best player and became the face of the tournament for her outspoken views on US president Donald Trump and campaigning for LGBT rights. Rapinoe played for Lyon in between 2013 and 2014, with follow USA forward Alex Morgan briefly playing for the six-time Champions League winners in 2017. Reign FC said Monday that they expected to conclude a deal with OL Group before the end of January. ""Our ambition has always been to operate the best women's football club in the world,"" said Reign FC's majority owner Bill Predmore. ""This is a distinction long held by OL, making them the perfect organisation to help us achieve our long-term objectives for the club."" With thirteen consecutive domestic league titles and six Champions League, Lyon's women's outfit fit that bill. Reign midfielder Jess Fishlock told her club website she was massively behind the move. ""Lyon and Reign are both amazing organisations and I am so proud to have played for both clubs,"" she said. ""Bringing the clubs together is for me the perfect combination -- I literally can't think of a better outcome for two clubs who are so dedicated to the growth of the women's game."""
62,11/11/2019,00:17,Payet fires Marseille to fiery derby win after fans attack Lyon bus,Dimitri Payet scored twice as 10-man Marseille beat rivals Lyon 2-1 on Sunday in a bad-tempered derby which was overshadowed by the behaviour of a record home crowd.,"The build-up to the game was focused on former Marseille boss Rudi Garcia's return to the Stade Velodrome after his controversial decision to join Lyon as coach, but it is more likely to be remembered for ugly scenes off the pitch. Home supporters attacked the Lyon bus with stones, bottles and other projectiles on its way to the stadium, before visiting players were repeatedly bombarded with objects thrown from the crowd while taking corners during the match. Payet netted a first-half double as Marseille moved second in the Ligue 1 table, eight points adrift of Paris Saint-Germain. The Lyon team coach was left with two shattered windows by the pre-game ambush, with club president Jean-Michel Aulas threatening to pull his team out of the match if anything else happened. ""We were bombarded with stones, bottles and other projectiles. It's a disgrace, it's just sick,"" regional newspaper La Provence reported an unidentified passenger of the bus saying. The match was also suspended for two minutes in the second half due to thick smoke billowing around the pitch, coming from pyrotechnics by the record Marseille crowd of 65,421. Earlier in the evening, around 6,000 fans had gathered at a city beach to perform a short but boisterous ceremonial parade to celebrate Marseille's 120th anniversary. Controversy also reigned on the pitch early on, as Marseille were awarded a penalty in the 13th minute for a clear handball by Thiago Mendes. But there was a lengthy stoppage for a VAR review, before Leo Dubois collapsed to the floor in apparent agony after being lightly slapped by Dario Benedetto as the players waited for the penalty to be taken. Another VAR check deciding against sending off the Marseille forward, with Payet slamming the spot-kick into the top corner five minutes after it had been originally awarded. Lyon struggled to pose a threat up front, although their players did have to avoid several missiles, including plastic bags and cups, thrown from the stands. Marseille moved two goals in front when Payet, who was in inspired form, won the ball from Bertrand Traore inside his own half, before later finishing the move with a low drive into the bottom corner. Lyon gave themselves hope shortly after the interruption as Moussa Dembele headed home in the 59th minute when Marseille goalkeeper Steve Mandanda and defender Alvaro left Traore's cross for each other. Spaniard Alvaro was sent off just minutes later for hauling down Dembele with the striker clean through on goal. But OM managed to hold on despite some late Lyon pressure, with Martin Terrier blasting the final chance wide in the 90th minute. ""It's a night to enjoy,"" said Marseille boss Andre Villas-Boas. ""Payet was very motivated, he had a great match. ""I hope it will continue. We had a great desire to win the game. We felt that, and we had talked about that desire this week."" Garcia's Lyon remain 14th in the table, only four points above the relegation zone. Elsewhere on Sunday, Lyon's local rivals Saint-Etienne moved up to fourth with a 3-2 victory at Nantes, who have slipped from second to ninth in the table after four straight league defeats. PSG had extended their advantage at the top on Saturday thanks to Mauro Icardi's late winner in a 2-1 success at Brest."
63,08/11/2019,02:35,PSG hail Navas as bitter rivals Marseille and Lyon clash,"If Paris Saint-Germain have been held back in recent years by their lack of a truly top-class goalkeeper, Keylor Navas showed just why they were so keen to bring him to the French capital with his midweek performance in the Champions League.","The Costa Rican joined PSG in September from Real Madrid as Alphonse Areola moved in the other direction, and on Wednesday his late penalty save helped secure a 1-0 win over Club Brugge that clinched his side's place in the last 16. The last line of defence for Real as they won three successive Champions Leagues between 2016 and 2018, Navas is yet to concede a goal in Europe since arriving in Paris. Indeed, the 32-year-old has let in only five goals in 12 matches for Thomas Tuchel's side. ""He is an extraordinary goalkeeper. He won three Champions Leagues with Real Madrid in a competition where goalkeeper is such an important position. They can change the outcome of a game,"" remarked midfielder Marco Verratti after Wednesday's game, in which Mauro Icardi scored the winner. ""He will bring so much experience and calmness to the side,"" said sporting director Leonardo. Leading sports daily L'Equipe on Thursday gave over its front page to the goalkeeper with a headline referencing 1982 Jean-Paul Belmondo action comedy The Ace of Aces. And yet less than a week ago it is true that Navas hardly covered himself in glory as PSG suffered a shock 2-1 defeat at Dijon. Then again, neither did any of his teammates, and Europe is where this team will really be judged. A trip to Real Madrid later this month, when Neymar should be fit again, could be revealing. In Ligue 1, PSG have lost three of their opening 12 games and yet they are already seven points clear of Angers at the top. They travel to face Brest on Saturday where Tuchel will again have to decide whether to leave the club's all-time top goal-scorer, Edinson Cavani, on the bench. Icardi has been preferred to the Uruguayan recently and has now scored eight times in the last seven matches. Few tears were shed among Marseille fans when Garcia left his job as coach at the Velodrome at the end of last season. In contrast, there was plenty of unrest in the Lyon support when the 55-year-old was appointed as successor to the sacked Sylvinho last month. Garcia's recent past with Marseille was always going to be difficult to swallow for Lyon fans given the frankly bitter rivalry that has developed between the clubs. On Sunday, Garcia heads back to Marseille with his new team for the 'Olympico' as the sides jostle for position in a packed table behind PSG. Lyon are 10th but sit just four points behind Marseille in fourth and have won their last three games, including a precious 3-1 defeat of Benfica in the Champions League in midweek. Garcia has been dealt a major blow, though, with the news that Memphis Depay -- scorer of 11 goals in 14 games this season -- will miss the match with a hamstring injury. 8 - The number of goals scored by Mauro Icardi in PSG's last seven matches. 5 - Lyon have won their last five Ligue 1 meetings with Marseille and are unbeaten in 10 encounters since a 4-2 defeat in May 2014. 10 - Lille are unbeaten in their last 10 home league games, a record they will hope to extend as they entertain Metz on the rebound from a 4-1 loss at Valencia which eliminated them from the Champions League."
64,19/10/2019,20:35,Lyon labour to Dijon draw in Garcia's first game,Lyon stuttered to a 0-0 draw against fellow Ligue 1 strugglers Dijon on Saturday as already-embattled new coach Rudi Garcia took charge for the first time.,"The 55-year-old's appointment was greeted with anger by Lyon supporters because of his three-year stint at bitter rivals Marseille. He was roundly booed at the Groupama Stadium ahead of kick-off. Garcia's day did not get any better, as his side wasted a string of excellent chances against dogged Dijon. ""The fans were good during the match, at the end of the day they're not happy with results and neither are we,"" he told Canal+. ""We weren't missing much, aggression in front of goal. We're starting from scratch. When we play a team in the relegation zone, we must win."" Lyon, who sacked Brazilian Sylvinho, in his first job as a head coach, after only 11 matches earlier this month, have failed to win in eight league games. The draw left Lyon, who have not finished outside the top five since 1998, languishing 14th in the table after 10 matches, just one point above the relegation zone. The seven-time French title-winners, who were widely tipped to be Paris Saint-Germain's closest challengers this season, are 14 points adrift of the defending champions. PSG beat Nice 4-1 on Friday to move five points clear of second-placed Nantes, who visit Metz later on Saturday."

""To produce such a display against Lyon is great, especially in such a short amount of time,"" said Puel, who also spent three years at Lyon from 2008-2011. ""This victory shows the players the sacrifice and desire they need to put into a match. I'm building something here and this fine start must be backed up."" Lyon began the weekend in trouble of their own, languishing a disappointing 11th after a domestic six-match winless run but buoyed by a Champions League victory at RB Leipzig. Anthony Lopes tipped a Riyad Boudebouz effort onto the post in a cagey first half at the Stade Geoffroy-Guichard, and the Lyon goalkeeper made another top reflex save to deny Denis Bouanga on the hour. Moussa Dembele came off the bench for Lyon and forced Jessy Moulin to palm away his header on 85 minutes, with Houssem Aouar then trickling an effort wide after sneaking in behind the hosts' defence. Beric won it at the death though as he rose superbly to head a Boudebouz cross beyond the reach of Lopes to send Saint-Etienne up to 13th and two points above Lyon. ""I'm very worried by our results,"" said Lyon coach Sylvinho. ""We're losing all our matches in the same way. It's not up to me to say if I'm the man for the situation. ""I feel the same as I did after (the 2-2 draws with) Amiens and Brest,"" he added. ""We've conceded again at the end of the match. It's even more frustrating in a derby."" In-form Victor Osimhen's seventh league goal of the season wasn't enough for Lille as they missed the chance to go third after drawing 2-2 with Nimes. Nigeria international Osimhen, 20, who also scored in Lille's 2-1 Champions League defeat to Chelsea midweek, struck the hosts' leveller with 11 minutes remaining after a Renaud Ripart penalty at the end of the first half and Kevin Denkey's neat 70th-minute finish had cancelled out Loic Remy's 13th-minute opener. A win for Lille would have moved them above surprise package Angers following their 4-0 hammering at the hands of league leaders Paris Saint-Germain on Saturday. Instead Christophe Galtier's side stay in fifth on 15 points from nine matches, but they could have easily lost against a spirited Nimes side that belied their pre-match league position of 17th. The lively Romain Philippoteaux, who won the spot-kick that Ripart calmly slotted home, came close to scoring a wonderful individual strike when his finish clipped the outside of the post following an exciting dribble. Reims moved into sixth, a point behind Lille after Boulaye Dia's strike three minutes after half-time consigned former high-fliers Rennes to the latest defeat in a miserable run of form. Level with PSG at the top of the league at the end of August, Julien Stephan's Rennes haven't won in the eight games in any competition since and have plummeted down to 10th. Reims meanwhile consolidated a fine start to the season that sees them with the league's best defensive record alongside PSG, with just four goals conceded in nine games."
66,02/10/2019,23:14,Depay makes Leipzig pay as Lyon find form,Lyon ended their poor recent run as Memphis Depay scored in a 2-0 Champions League win that condemned RB Leipzig to a second home defeat in four days on Wednesday.,"Goals by ex-Manchester United forward Depay and Martin Terrier sealed a deserved victory for the French side which put them level on points with Group G leaders Zenit Saint Petersburg, one point clear of third-placed Leipzig. Lyon arrived in Germany on a seven-match winless streak which had seen them plummet to 11th in the Ligue 1 table. Leipzig were leading the Bundesliga as recently as Saturday before falling to a 3-1 defeat at home by Schalke. Coach Julian Nagelsmann insisted it was just a blip, but Lyon again exposed Leipzig's lack of composure at the back on a sobering night for the hosts. The visitors took an early lead after a horrible mistake in the home defence. Lyon midfielder Houssem Aouar nicked the ball from Leipzig's Ibrahima Konate, beat defender Dayot Upamecano and sprinted into the area. He generously let the ball roll for winger Depay to fire home and silence the home crowd. The Dutchman had the ball in the net again after he got in behind the Leipzig defence just before half-time, but he was ruled offside. Leipzig striker Timo Werner squandered two great chances and forward Yussuf Poulsen had an effort cleared off the line as Lyon stayed in front at the break. Both Nagelsmann and Lyon coach Sylvinho were shown yellow cards early in the second half after a touchline dispute. Leipzig's next calamity came when a poor pass across the back by Upamecano fell to substitute defender Nordi Mukiele. The 21-year-old Frenchman watched in horror as he lost control and the ball was snapped up by Terrier, who rounded Leipzig 'keeper Peter Gulacsi to make it two on 65 minutes. Nagelsmann reacted by dragging off Upamecano moments later and despite a few half-chances, Leipzig could not claw their way back."
67,01/10/2019,03:15,"Nagelsmann, Werner on the rise for ambitious Leipzig","With coach Julian Nagelsmann touted as the next Jurgen Klopp or Pep Guardiola and striker Timo Werner providing the goals, ambitious RB Leipzig target a home Champions League win over Lyon on Wednesday in their bid to reach the last 16.","Leipzig flew out of the blocks a fortnight ago when Germany international Werner, 23, scored twice in a 2-1 win at Benfica to top Group G, while Lyon drew 1-1 at home to Zenit St Peterburg. ""It's not like we're here to make up the numbers, we want to get out of the group,"" said Werner who targets home victories over Lyon, Zenit, and Benfica. ""If we win those games, and we can beat anyone at home, then we will almost have a foot in the last 16. That has to be our goal."" Ambitious words for an ambitious club during only their second Champions League campaign. ""The key is that we have more experienced players on the pitch, who know what it's all about,"" assured attacker Emil Forsberg. Their 2017-18 competition debut ended in disappointment when they finished third in the group, dropping to the Europa League where they reached the quarter finals. Nagelsmann, 32, and Werner have points to prove against Lyon after the harsh reality check of Saturday's 3-1 home defeat by Schalke cost them top spot in the Bundesliga. Despite his tally of seven goals so far this term, Werner has not scored in the three games since the Benfica win, while by his own admission, Nagelsmann lost his composure against Schalke. ""You could tell that he's a guy who doesn't like to lose,"" said captain Willi Orban. ""That was not typical RB football"". Werner and Nagelsmann epitomise the club's aspirations to consistently challenge in the Bundesliga and become a force in Europe, backed by energy drinks firm Red Bull. Werner could have spoken for Nagelsmann in admitting ""I am not world class yet, no, and I'm working on getting to that level."" His role model is Robert Lewandowski and persistent rumours suggest Bayern Munich have ear-marked Werner, who signed a new contract in August, to eventually replace their star striker. Leipzig are only in their fourth year in Germany's top tier and this is Nagelsmann's first season in charge. The club regard him as a rising coaching star who is set to reach the same elite level as Liverpool's Klopp or Manchester City's Guardiola. ""Julian is a huge German talent as a coach,"" Ralf Rangnick, the beverage company's head of sport, told daily newspaper paper the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung. ""He is very mature for his age and has come a long way, if he continues to develop like this, he can reach the level of Klopp and Guardiola."" However, to be considered a peer of Klopp and Guardiola, Nagelsmann needs to win titles and, like Werner, is the first to admit he is still learning. ""I find it relatively easy to remain humble - if you go crazy every match day, you're out of your element, because it's all about confirming and repeating performances,"" he said earlier this month. However, he broke his own rules when he was booked on Saturday ""because I acted like a mad man"" for arguing with the referee after Schalke's Amine Harit was awarded a dubious penalty after faint contact in the area. Both Nagelsmann and his team must do better against Lyon. Skipper Orban expects an ""intensive game"" against a French side with ""a lot of quality and experience"". He admitted defeat before a key Champions League game is a ""little setback"". ""That's annoying, but we're still a young team,"" like their coach, and he added ""we have to learn from it."""

As Samuel Moutoussamy broke into the home area, left back Fernando Marcal slid in and attempted to poke the ball out for a corner. Instead, it struck his other leg and looped over goalkeeper Anthony Lopes and into the goal. As the home fans whistled their team, the Lyon players appeared increasingly lost, although the brilliance of Nantes goalkeeper Alban Lafont was a major factor in their failure. Lyon remained 11th after a seventh straight winless match, a run that includes three losses and three draws in the league and a home draw with Zenit St. Petersburg in the Champions League. They visit RB Leipzig in Europe on Wednesday. Nantes had not won in Lyon since December 1996, a run of 17 matches. The victory continues their revival under coach Christian Gourcuff. The Canaries climbed one point clear of Paris Saint-Germain, who visit Bordeaux in the afternoon, and Angers who host Amiens in the evening."
69,17/09/2019,21:06,Inter scrape late draw with Slavia Prague in Champions League opener,Substitute Nicolo Barella scored in added time to rescue a 1-1 draw for a disappointing Inter Milan in their Champions League opener against rank outsiders Slavia Prague on Tuesday.,"It looked as though the Czech side would leave San Siro with all three points in the Group F clash after Nigerian forward Peter Olayinka put them ahead in the 63rd minute, only for Barella to level in the second of eight minutes of stoppage time. Olayinka, who has previously played in Albania and Belgium, pounced to score in the 63rd minute after Inter goalkeeper Samir Handanovic had saved from Jaroslav Zeleny. However, Inter equalised when a Stefano Sensi free-kick rattled off the bar and the ball came out to Barella, whose shot found the net with the aid of a deflection. Slavia goalkeeper Ondrej Kolar then made a fine reaction save from a Romelu Lukaku header in the 97th minute, and a draw was the least the visitors deserved. They are among the longest shots with bookmakers to win the Champions League in their first appearance in the group stage since 2007-08, and this result suits neither side in a section also featuring Barcelona and Borussia Dortmund. Inter came into their Champions League campaign with optimism after winning their opening three games of the season in Serie A under new coach Antonio Conte. However, they are now already at serious risk of exiting in the group stage for the second season running. The other early kick-off on Tuesday saw Lyon come from behind to draw 1-1 at home to Russian champions Zenit Saint-Petersburg in France in Group G. Iranian striker Sardar Azmoun gave Zenit the lead just before half-time after playing a one-two with strike partner Artem Dzyuba on the edge of the area. The home side needed just five minutes of the second half to draw level, though, with Memphis Depay converting a penalty after he had been brought down by Magomed Ozdoev. Benfica and RB Leipzig meet later in the same group in Lisbon. Also on Tuesday, holders Liverpool kick off their campaign away to Napoli and Salzburg take on Genk in Group E, while Chelsea host Valencia and last season's semi-finalists Ajax meet Lille in Group H."

Lyon, who were considered PSG's likeliest challengers for the title at the start of the season, host Thomas Tuchel's men next weekend. ""When you don't play for 90 minutes, you pay the price,"" Sylvinho, whose team host Zenit Saint Petersburg in the Champions League on Tuesday, told Canal+ Sport. They fell behind in only the seventh minute on Friday, as veteran former Lyon defender Christophe Jallet's left-wing free-kick found its way into the far corner of the net to put Amiens ahead. But Dembele continued his excellent start to the season by volleying in an equaliser only two minutes later. The 23-year-old former Celtic striker then produced an acrobatic effort to divert home Bertrand Traore's cross in the 34th minute and make it five goals in as many league matches this term. Martin Terrier was denied a third Lyon goal early in the second period by a fine save from Regis Gurtner, and Lyon were made to pay as Amiens struck in injury time. Substitute Bodmer, 36, diverted the ball into the bottom corner to snatch the home side a point. ""In the second half, simply, we stopped playing... The goal that we conceded at the end was deserved,"" said Lyon captain Leo Dubois. Earlier on Friday, Nigerian youngster Victor Osimhen also scored his fifth Ligue 1 goal of the season as Lille claimed a 2-1 win over Angers. The 20-year-old Osimhen netted the opener six minutes before half-time and is now level at the top of the early goalscoring charts in France with Dembele. Luiz Araujo's fine individual strike in the 53rd minute doubled the lead for last season's runners-up, who held on to take their third victory of the new campaign despite a late goal from Angers forward Stephane Bahoken. Osimhen, who scored doubles in previous home victories over Saint-Etienne and Nantes, took advantage of a dreadful error by visiting goalkeeper Ludovic Butelle to grab his goal. Lille next travel to Amsterdam to face Ajax in their Champions League opener on Tuesday. ""If we play the same way at the end of the game when we were leading 2-0 against Ajax on Tuesday, then we will lose the match,"" said coach Christophe Galtier. ""No (heads weren't turning to Amsterdam). Now, yes... It will take a great determination, a great desire to do something because it will be very difficult.""

Martin Terrier was denied a third Lyon goal early in the second period by a fine save from Regis Gurtner, and Lyon were made to pay as Amiens struck in injury time. Substitute Bodmer, 36, diverted the ball into the bottom corner to snatch the home side a point. ""In the second half, simply, we stopped playing... The goal that we conceded at the end was deserved,"" said Lyon captain Leo Dubois. Earlier on Friday, Nigerian youngster Victor Osimhen also scored his fifth Ligue 1 goal of the season as Lille claimed a 2-1 win over Angers. The 20-year-old Osimhen netted the opener six minutes before half-time and is now level at the top of the early goalscoring charts in France with Dembele. Luiz Araujo's fine individual strike in the 53rd minute doubled the lead for last season's runners-up, who held on to take their third victory of the new campaign despite a late goal from Angers forward Stephane Bahoken. Osimhen, who scored doubles in previous home victories over Saint-Etienne and Nantes, took advantage of a dreadful error by visiting goalkeeper Ludovic Butelle to grab his goal. Lille next travel to Amsterdam to face Ajax in their Champions League opener on Tuesday. ""If we play the same way at the end of the game when we were leading 2-0 against Ajax on Tuesday, then we will lose the match,"" said coach Christophe Galtier. ""No (heads weren't turning to Amsterdam). Now, yes... It will take a great determination, a great desire to do something because it will be very difficult."" Lille are now third in the fledgling table, level on points with leaders PSG and second-placed Rennes."
72,31/08/2019,22:10,Ten-man Lyon slip up with home draw against Bordeaux,Ten-man Lyon dropped points in Ligue 1 for the second straight match as Sylvinho's side were held to a 1-1 draw at the Groupama Stadium by Bordeaux.,"A busy transfer window and thumping victories in their opening two games of the season had raised hopes that Lyon could challenge reigning champions Paris Saint-Germain for the title. But the midweek 1-0 loss to Montpellier was followed with another disappointing performance, as Jimmy Briand grabbed Bordeaux a point midway through the second half after Memphis Depay's opener and Thiago Mendes' sending off. ""The sending off of Thiago Mendes penalised us. It seemed to me that it was an exaggerated (fall),"" said Sylvinho, who replaced Bruno Genesio as Lyon coach in May. ""I am sad about the result and the sending off."" Depay fired the hosts into a 32nd-minute lead with a low, left-footed strike after racing away from the visiting defence and has now scored four league goals in as many games this season. But the dismissal of Mendes, a close-season signing from Lille, for a second yellow card changed the match and Briand equalised in the 67th minute after a goalmouth scramble. ""It's very hard to digest, clearly two points lost, but the good thing is that we did not lose,"" said Lyon goalkeeper Anthony Lopes. ""We lacked focus and maturity to finish the game XI against XI."" Rennes will put Ligue 1's last 100 percent record on the line against Nice on Sunday, but only need a point to retake top spot from PSG, who beat Metz 2-0 on Friday. Elsewhere on Saturday, promoted Brest suffered their first defeat of the season with a 3-0 loss at Nimes, while Angers moved into third by beating pointless Dijon 2-0."
73,27/08/2019,22:49,Kone sent off as Lyon lose to superb Montpellier strike,"Defender Youssouf Kone was sent-off for a headbutt as Lyon lost 1-0 to Montpellier in Ligue 1 on Tuesday, in Sylvinho's first defeat in charge.","Kone was sent off early in the second half after clashing heads with the home side's Algeria international Andy Delort. Before the defeat, coach Sylvinho had guided the side to convincing wins over Monaco and Angers in his first two Ligue 1 matches in charge. Montpellier claimed their opening win of the season with right back Arnaud Souquet's wonderful half-volley shortly before the break. The fixture had been moved, along with two other games, from the weekend to free police resources for the G7 summit taking place in Biarritz in France's south-west. ""We had a lot of chances. Even if the red card changed things a little we managed the second half well. We could have killed the match off,"" goalscorer Souquet said. ""For the goal, I hit the ball as it came. When the ball left my foot I told myself there was a good chance it would end in the back of the net,"" he added. The hosts dominated the early play at Stade de la Mosson with forward Delort wasting a good chance after 15 minutes. Delort, an African Cup of Nations winner during the summer, had a chance to claim an advantage a quarter of an hour later. Denmark youth international Joachim Andersen tripped Delort in the box. The bleach-blonde forward took the spot kick, but hit the post. Montpellier took the lead with three minutes of the first half remaining. Lyon left-back Kone headed a Florent Mollet corner away but Souquet met the clearance on the half-volley. His shot flew high into the net untouched with goalkeeper Anthony Lopes flat footed. Kone's match went from bad to worse six minutes into the second-half when he was shown a red card after a clash with Delort off the ball. Lyon captain Jason Denayer had a chance to bring the side level but his header from Bertrand Traore's free-kick only found the side netting. With five minuted play, Delort's chipped effort beat Lopes and also the cross bar. On Wednesday, in the remaining early games of the round, Nice, fresh from a takeover by English billionaire Sir Jim Ratcliffe, host Marseille, looking for their first league win under Andre Villas-Boas, while Lille host Saint-Etienne."
74,16/08/2019,22:45,"Depay, Dembele at the double as Lyon hammer Angers",Lyon forwards Memphis Depay and Moussa Dembele both scored twice to guide their side to a 6-0 drubbing of Angers in France's Ligue 1 on Friday.,"Midfielder Houssem Aouar and new face Jean Lucas also helped coach Sylvinho and sporting director Juninho to continue the perfect start to their tenures. A large banner behind one goal carrying Brazilian Juninho's face was unveiled pre-match as the former playmaker made his return to the club where he won numerous league titles more than a decade ago. The two sides faced each other less than 48 hours after Jeff Reine-Adelaide completed a club record 25 million euros ($27.7 million) move from Angers to Lyon. The midfielder's new employers took an early lead through Aouar's 11th minute effort. The 21-year-old Lyon academy product intercepted a sloppy Romain Thomas pass before charging forward and beating goalkeeper Ludovic Butelle. Their second goal arrived on the 36-minute mark as Dembele made the most of a lucky ricochet. Lucas Tousart's attempted pass was deflected onto Dembele's path inside the Angers box and the former Celtic forward held-off the back-tracking Mateo Pavlovic to shoot past Butelle's right hand. Depay's double came in a seven-minute spell either side of half-time. Aouar became the provider setting up Depay for both, the second a deft lob before the Dutch international cooly finished despite VAR checking an off-the-ball collision between Dembele and right-back Vincent Maneau. Dembele claimed his second with 25 minutes remaining as Pavlovic was once again caught out after attempting to intercept Depay's pass. The France youth international picked up the loose ball and slotted easily past a hapless Butelle. The rout was confirmed with 18 minutes to go as substitute Jean Lucas scored his first goal for the club since joining from Flamengo during the summer. On Saturday, Andre Villas-Boas takes his Marseille team to Nantes looking for an improvement after losing his first league game in charge last weekend. On Sunday the saga of Neymar's possible departure overshadows champions Paris Saint-Germain's trip to Rennes in a replay of last season's French Cup final when the Brazil forward was banned for three games after an altercation with a fan."
75,31/07/2019,13:04,Bruno Genesio hired as ruthless Beijing axe Schmidt,Beijing Guoan sacked Roger Schmidt and replaced him with former Lyon manager Bruno Genesio on Wednesday -- despite the German taking the club to third in the Chinese Super League.,"Schmidt inspired Beijing to the best start in CSL history as they won all 10 of their opening matches, to go with the FA Cup they lifted under him the previous season. But they failed to progress out of their Asian Champions League group and stuttered of late in the CSL, falling to third, albeit only four points off leaders Guangzhou Evergrande. With a crunch home clash against Fabio Cannavaro's Evergrande on August 11 and a third of the season left, Beijing have acted ruthlessly to oust the former Bayer Leverkusen coach, 52. They lost their last three matches in all competitions, the final straw being a 1-0 defeat to mid-table Henan Jianye. ""We sincerely thank Mr. Schmidt for his hard work these two years and wish him all the best in his work and life,"" the club said in a statement on the Twitter-like Weibo. Genesio, the 52-year-old Frenchman, takes charge until the end of the season. He left Ligue 1 club Lyon earlier this year after 12 years at the club, first as an assistant and then head coach. The former midfielder also played for Lyon from 1985 to 1995. Beijing separately said that they had signed the Brazilian international midfielder Fernando from Spartak Moscow on loan."
76,28/07/2019,18:53,Dembele double fires Lyon to victory against Arsenal,Substitute Moussa Dembele scored twice as Lyon came from behind to beat Arsenal 2-1 in a pre-season friendly in London on Sunday.,"Gunners boss Unai Emery had opted against including Sead Kolasinac and Mesut Ozil in his squad after they were involved in an attempted car-jacking during the week. He also named new signings Dani Ceballos and Gabriel Martinelli on the bench, with the pair coming on as the Ligue 1 side overturned Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang's opener to win the pre-season trophy. Alexandre Lacazette limped off injured early as Arsenal dominated the opening half, Aubameyang smartly tucking home Henrikh Mkhitaryan's cross 10 minutes before half-time. But after the break, with changes taking place for much of the half, Lyon battled back and Dembele struck either side of Martinelli having a debut Emirates Stadium goal ruled out for handball. Before kick-off the fans observed a period of applause in memory of Jose Antonio Reyes. The former Arsenal forward died in a car accident on June 1."
77,23/07/2019,10:59,Fekir leaves Lyon in surprise move to Real Betis,"French World Cup winning midfielder Nabil Fekir has completed a surprising move from Lyon to Real Betis, the La Liga club announced on Tuesday.","""Real Betis and Olympique Lyonnais have reached an agreement for the transfer of midfielder Nabil Fekir,"" the club stated on its website. ""The French international has signed a contract until 2023 with the Green and White club. Fekir becomes the fourth team signing for the season 2019/2020. ""With the arrival of Fekir, Real Betis acquire creativity, great technique, shooting ability and attacking edge."" No transfer fee has been made public although reports in France and Spain put the fee at just over 20 million euros which could rise by another 10 million through bonuses. Fekir, who has signed a five-year deal, and Betis both have a 20 percent sell-on clause included in the deal. In spite of a likely pay rise from his Lyon salary, estimated by L'Equipe at 350,000 euros a month, it appears a surprising move for the 26-year-old on a football front. Unlike Lyon, who qualified for this season's Champions League, Seville club Betis have no European competition after finishing 10th in La Liga last season. A year ago, Fekir came close to signing for Liverpool for 70 million euros, negotiations only breaking down when he went to Anfield for the medical. With just a year left on his contract at Lyon, and after a season in which he scored just nine goals, he had also been linked with Sevilla, Valencia and Napoli. Fekir has won 21 caps for France and came on as a late substitute in last year's World Cup final win against Croatia in Moscow."
78,12/07/2019,16:21,Lyon break transfer record for Danish defender Andersen,"Lyon have completed the signing of Danish defender Joachim Andersen from Serie A side Sampdoria on a five-year deal for a fee rising to a club record 30 million euros ($33.7m), the French outfit announced on Friday.","OL said in a statement they had agreed to pay Sampdoria an initial 24 million euros for the 23-year-old, with a further six million euros in potential bonuses. That means the 1.90m tall centre-back becomes the club's most expensive player ahead of Brazilian midfielder Thiago Mendes, who signed from Lille for 26.5 million euros earlier this month. Formerly with Twente Enschede in the Netherlands, Andersen moved to Italy in 2017. He has yet to be capped by Denmark at full international level. ""Signing him was one of our priorities. We had watched him very closely. We are delighted to have him,"" said Lyon president Jean-Michel Aulas. He is Lyon's fifth major signing of the summer following the arrival of a new Brazilian management team, with club legend Juninho Pernambucano returning as sporting director and Sylvinho appointed coach. As well as Andersen and Mendes, Lyon have signed Malian left-back Youssouf Kone from Lille for nine million euros, young Brazilian midfielder Jean Lucas from Flamengo, and giant Romanian goalkeeper Ciprian Tatarusanu from Nantes. The spending spree has been funded by the big-money sales of French international duo Ferland Mendy and Tanguy Ndombele. Left-back Mendy moved to Real Madrid for a fee reportedly reaching 53 million euros, while powerful midfielder Ndombele has signed for Tottenham Hotspur for up to 70 million euros. Lyon will be in the Champions League again next season after finishing third in Ligue 1."
79,03/07/2019,11:51,Lyon sign Brazilian Thiago Mendes after sales of young stars,"French club Lyon on Wednesday completed the signing of Brazilian midfielder Thiago Mendes, reinvesting some of the 70 million euros ($79 million) they received from Tottenham for French international midfielder Tanguy Ndombele.","Mendes, 27, was signed from Lyon's Ligue 1 rivals Lille for a fee reported to be 25 million euros. He is Lyon's second Brazilian recruit of the summer after Jean Lucas was signed for eight million euros from Flamengo in a deal negotiated by Juninho Pernambucano, the Brazilian former Lyon player who has returned to the club as sporting director, and new coach Sylvinho. On Tuesday, Ndombele finalised his move to Champions League finalists Tottenham, who smashed their transfer record to sign the highly-coveted 22-year-old. Lyon have also sold defender Ferland Mendy to Real Madrid in a deal worth up to 53 million euros and in total their transfer receipts this summer amount to 113 million euros."
80,29/05/2019,23:49,Chelsea victory hands Lyon Champions League spot,Chelsea were not the only ones celebrating their victory over Arsenal in Wednesday's Europa League final.,"Their 4-1 win in Baku was also great news for French club Lyon, who will now go directly into the group stage of next season's Champions League. While Arsenal -- who finished fifth in the Premier League -- needed to win the game in order to return to the Champions League after a two-year absence, Chelsea were already assured of their return to Europe's top table. Sarri's side qualified by virtue of coming third in the Premier League, so the berth on offer to the winner of Europe's secondary competition instead goes to Lyon. The French side finished third in Ligue 1, meaning ordinarily they would be required to go through two qualifying rounds to return to the group stage of a competition in which they reached the last 16 this season. It is the second year running in which Lyon have benefited in such a way - they also came third in Ligue 1 last season but went straight into the group stage after Atletico Madrid won last year's Europa League and finished second in La Liga. Lyon have just appointed a new Brazilian management team, with former player Juninho as sporting director and Sylvinho -- once of Arsenal -- as coach."
81,17/05/2019,23:33,Ex-Barcelona and Arsenal player Sylvinho to be new Lyon coach - report,"Brazil's Sylvinho, who once played for Barcelona and Arsenal, was set to be named as the new coach of French Ligue 1 club Lyon on a two-year contract, reports claimed on Friday.","RMC Sport said that the 45-year-old will replace Bruno Genesio for next season after being hand-picked by compatriot Juninho, a former Lyon star who will be the club's new sporting director. Sylvinho has been working as right-hand man to Brazil coach Tite and had been preparing a team for the 2020 Olympics in Japan. However, he announced he was standing down from that job earlier Friday. In his playing career as a defender, Sylvinho started his career in his native Brazil with Corinthians before moving to Arsenal, Celta Vigo and Barcelona. He ended his playing days with one season at Manchester City in 2009-2010."
82,12/05/2019,23:33,Lille on verge of Champions League as Marseille fans revolt,"Loic Remy scored for the third game running as Lille all but secured a place in next season's Champions League group stage, while Marseille fans vented their anger towards players in a dismal 3-0 home defeat by Lyon.","Former France forward Remy smashed in a volley from a clever free-kick on 27 minutes to hand Lille a 1-0 win over Bordeaux and keep them six points clear of Lyon with two games to play. Christophe Galtier's team are virtually guaranteed second place owing to a far superior goal difference, a remarkable turnaround after the club narrowly avoided relegation last season. Bordeaux's turbulent end to the campaign will see them finish with their lowest points total since 2004-05 as they suffered a fifth successive defeat. Lyon's team bus was pelted with stones upon its arrival in Marseille, while home supporters displayed a series of banners lambasting the club's failures this season as Rudi Garcia's side were eliminated from European contention in abject fashion. ""You don't have the shoulders or the balls to wear the shirt, get lost"" read one banner at the Stade Velodrome, where Marseille fell behind to a Maxwel Cornet goal in the 25th minute. The mood soured further when Duje Caleta-Car was dismissed on 67 minutes after hauling back Martin Terrier as the Lyon forward skipped clear of the defence. Moussa Dembele doubled Lyon's lead on 84 minutes and Cornet added his second shortly after, prompting calls for Garcia and other club officials to resign as a section of home fans tried to invade the pitch. Lyon pulled four points clear of bitter regional rivals Saint-Etienne in third, and could qualify directly for the Champions League if Chelsea win the Europa League final against Arsenal on May 29. Earlier on Sunday, Guingamp's six-year stint in the top flight came to an end after Marcus Thuram missed a stoppage-time penalty in a 1-1 draw at Rennes."
83,19/04/2019,22:56,Depay helps Lyon end winless streak,Memphis Depay helped Lyon defeat Angers 2-1 in Ligue 1 on Friday to end a three match winless run and maintain their push for Champions League football next season.,"First half goals from the Dutch international and Martin Terrier saw Lyon consolidate their hold on third place on 59 points, six clear of fourth-placed Saint-Etienne. But not before they suffered a late scare when Lucas Tousart sent the ball into his own net just minutes after coming on after a poor clearance from Lyon keeper Anthony Lopes. This was Lyon's first outing since coach Bruno Genesio announced his departure at the end of the season. That came in the aftermath of last week's Ligue 1 defeat to struggling Nantes with the former multiple French champions also knocked out of the Champions League and French Cup in just over a month. Depay put Lyon in front on 14 minutes, Houssem Aouar providing the long assist. Outsprinting Angers defender Mateo Pavlovic the former Manchester United star's angled shot had keeper Ludovic Butelle foxed. The 25-year-old striker almost added to that tally minutes later only for his shot to be deflected off Butelle's near post. As half-time approached Terrier wrong-footed Butelle to double Lyon's advantage after another counter-attack with Aouar once again providing the decisive pass. Earlier Rennes, who face Paris Saint-Germain in next weekend's French Cup final, lost 3-2 at Dijon. PSG can wrap up the Ligue 1 title on Sunday when they host Monaco, and will be crowned champions before that match if second-placed Lille fail to win at Toulouse."
84,13/04/2019,16:20,Under-fire Lyon coach Genesio to leave at end of season,"Coach Bruno Genesio, who has fallen out with Lyon fans, said on Saturday he would leave the club after the season ""to allow the team to develope in a more serene atmosphere"".","""For some time now, I have been facing a rather negative climate -- to say the least -- which I think could be a major obstacle for the team,"" said Genesio, who has been in charge since December 2015 and who was reaching the end of his contract. Lyon suffered a third straight defeat on Friday, away to struggling Nantes. They have been knocked out of the Champions League and French Cup in just over a month. They are third in Ligue 1, five points behind second-placed Lille. Genesio urged the fans to support the team as they chase second place and a Champions League group-stage berth. ""What is unacceptable is to see that because of my situation some can wish the team loses or does not reach its objectives,"" he said. In the stands and on social media, the club's ultras have launched an uprising against Genesio, who joined Lyon, his hometown club, as a teenager and made 171 appearances for the first team."
85,06/04/2019,22:07,Pressure mounts on Genesio as 'unacceptable' Lyon beaten by Dijon,Lyon slipped to a second damaging defeat this week as a 3-1 loss to struggling Dijon and a hostile atmosphere at the Groupama Stadium piled the pressure on Bruno Genesio on Saturday.,"The 52-year-old coach had been told by president Jean-Michel Aulas that he would be offered a two-year contract extension if Lyon reached the French Cup final and finished in the Ligue 1 top three. But a 3-2 Cup semi-final defeat by Rennes on Tuesday put his future in doubt, and fans on Saturday unfurled banners calling for Genesio's departure. ""We had already been eliminated on Tuesday. It's unacceptable,"" said goalkeeper Anthony Lopes, who added that the players need to put Genesio's unstable situation to the back of their minds. ""We are professionals. We must know what to do. We know that it's football. Part of the decision on the (future of the) coach was made on Tuesday but we must know how to ignore all that. ""The truth is on the pitch. If we don't turn up on the pitch it can only be difficult in the future."" Martin Terrier's first-minute goal briefly placated the home support, but only six minutes later Lyon were behind. Wesley Said danced through the hapless home defence to slot in a third-minute equaliser, before his speculative long-range effort was deflected past Lopes by Lyon centre-back Marcelo. Genesio's beleaguered men never seriously threatened a response and put paid to their own hopes in comical circumstances midway through the second half. Said's pull-back was inadvertently backheeled into the net by Lyon full-back Rafael, with the spin on the ball leaving Lopes grasping at thin air. The result leaves Lyon six points clear of Saint-Etienne in the third and final Champions League spot, after Les Verts grabbed a late 2-2 draw with Amiens. A first league win since January lifted Dijon off the foot of the table and into the relegation play-off place. Later on Saturday, Monaco took another step towards safety as Stevan Jovetic's 94th-minute equaliser rescued a 1-1 draw against fellow strugglers Guingamp. Leonardo Jardim's men trailed to Felix Eboa Eboa's 23rd-minute strike, but Jovetic bundled the ball in after a penalty-box scramble to score his second league goal of an injury-plagued season. Monaco are now seven points clear of 18th-placed Dijon, despite a run of only one win in five games. Saint-Etienne took some advantage of Lyon's slip-up thanks to Remy Cabella's effort in the fifth minute of added time which snatched a point at 10-man Amiens."
86,03/04/2019,00:42,Genesio future unclear as Lyon lose in French Cup,Lyon president Jean-Michel Aulas said he will wait until the end of the season to decide the future of coach Bruno Genesio following Tuesday's 3-2 defeat at home to Rennes in the French Cup semi-finals.,"Rennes twice led at the Groupama Stadium through goals from Mbaye Niang and Benjamin Andre, but Lyon hit back with a Bertrand Traore goal and Moussa Dembele penalty. Algeria defender Ramy Bensebaini drilled home the winner for Rennes on 81 minutes to send his side through to the final and a possible showdown with holders Paris Saint-Germain. Bensebaini's strike allowed Rennes to avenge Friday's 1-0 league defeat by Lyon and denied Genesio's side the chance to claim their first silverware since lifting the trophy in 2012. ""It was agreed that if we were in the final -- which is no longer the case -- and if we were in the top three, there would be a two-year extension,"" Aulas said afterwards. ""The deal that was reached with Bruno is that there will not be a contract renewal between now and the end of the season. ""It will stay like that. It's really sad not to be able to say that Bruno will extend his stay."" Lyon are third in Ligue 1 and trail Lille by four points in the race for the second automatic Champions League qualifying spot. ""I'm very disappointed we're not through to the final,"" said Genesio, who has been in charge at Lyon since December 2015. ""There are eight games left in the league and I'm going to do everything to lead the team into the Champions League. ""My personal situation is not the priority. We're not in control of our destiny because we're third. The goal is to be less than three points adrift of Lille when they come to play us (in early May)."" Rennes will face either four-time reigning champions PSG or Nantes, who meet in Paris on Wednesday, in the French Cup final at the Stade de France on April 27."
87,14/03/2019,12:14,Messi mission on course after masterclass against Lyon,"Lionel Messi pledged at the start of the season to bring ""that beautiful cup"" back to the Camp Nou and on the evidence of Wednesday night, few would bet against him.","Barcelona's 5-1 thrashing of Lyon in their Champions League last 16 second leg, a score that overlooked a nervy spell in the second half when the visitors were a goal from going through, in the end, was all about him. Messi scored twice, including once from the penalty spot, although it was no ordinary spot-kick, instead a delightful chip that hung in the air and plopped perfectly down the middle. There was a pair of assists too, for Gerard Pique and Ousmane Dembele, during a three-goal flurry in the final 12 minutes, with Messi leaving Lyon defenders sprawled to add a second of his own. ""Almost everything went through Messi,"" said Lyon coach Bruno Genesio, whose team had held Barcelona to a 0-0 draw in the first leg. ""When he is at that kind of level he is almost unstoppable. We did what we could."" They restricted him to two goals, one short of Cristiano Ronaldo's hat-trick that had sent Juventus through and Atletico Madrid crashing out in Turin on Tuesday. Messi paid tribute. ""Cristiano had a magical night,"" he said. The talk has been of a changing of the guard, after Real Madrid's European hegemony was ended by Ajax, and a new era, with Spain having only one side in the Champions League quarter-finals for the first time since 2010. But Messi and Ronaldo remain constant, the former now on 108 goals in the competition, behind the latter's imperious 124. Each still has the power to settle a tie on their own and those most ardent in the debate about who is greater might be hoping for a Barca-Juve showdown when the draw for the quarter-finals is made on Friday. ""Big players like Leo and Cristiano, they give you so much,"" said Pique. ""Not just in results. Having Leo on your team makes you feel like you can face anything."" Certainly, Barca will be amongst the two or three opponents that clubs will be keenest to avoid, with only Manchester City and perhaps Juve, because of Ronaldo, carrying the same sense of power and momentum. Ernesto Valverde's team are not without weaknesses. Their defence, as proven against Lyon, is always susceptible while teams like Real Betis, Sevilla and Levante have laid a template for success in recent months, using speed on the counter-attack. But with a seven-point lead in La Liga, Valverde can afford to keep his players fresh while last year's collapse against Roma in the Champions League quarter-finals should mean complacency is out of the question. For Barcelona, domestic dominance has become the norm, meaning the Champions League is what will define their season, however unfair that assessment might be. ""From all over Spain, this team is given little credit for what we do,"" said Jordi Alba on Wednesday. ""The team has been consistent in all the competitions but the Champions League is decided by fine margins. We will try to do better."" Messi perhaps feels that urge more than most and the 31-year-old, who has won the competition four times but only once since 2011, is playing like a man on a mission. ""We are all extremely focused for this competition and Leo too,"" Valverde said. ""He played an incredible match, extraordinary. He made assists, scored goals, won the ball back. ""We are used to him, but somehow he always surprises us."""
88,13/03/2019,22:59,Messi stars as Barca reach Champions League quarter-finals,ionel Messi came up just short of matching Cristiano Ronaldo's hat-trick a day earlier but still scored twice and set up two more as Barcelona beat Lyon 5-1 on Wednesday to reach the Champions League quarter-finals.,"After Ronaldo's treble on Tuesday for Juventus sent Atletico Madrid packing in Turin, Messi delivered his own symphony at the Camp Nou, where Lyon were outplayed save for a very brief period in the second half when they threatened a comeback in this last-16 tie. A 0-0 draw in France in the first leg last month meant Lyon always had a chance to make Barca nervous, but Messi's sumptuously chipped penalty and a simple finish from Philippe Coutinho looked to have finished the tie before half-time. Yet Lucas Tousart's volley left Lyon one goal away from putting Barcelona out, only for Messi to take charge. He scored once more, before teeing up Gerard Pique and Ousmane Dembele to complete the victory. Messi now has 108 goals in the Champions League, behind Ronaldo's imperious 124, but his latest double takes his team one step closer to the trophy they crave the most. They go into Friday's draw for the last eight as the sole Spanish representative, along with Juventus, Manchester United, Manchester City, Liverpool, Tottenham Hotspur, Porto and Ajax. The last time Spain only had one team left at this stage of the competition was 2010 and after Atletico Madrid's exit to Juventus on Tuesday, Barca needed to win to avoid the first Spanish black-out in the quarter-finals since 2005. Coutinho had been whistled off by his own fans last weekend but was picked to start, preferred to Dembele who had just recovered from a hamstring strain. World Cup winner Nabil Fekir started for Lyon, having served a suspension in the first leg. Lyon could barely escape their own penalty area in early exchanges as Messi got to work. He fired one shot towards the top corner and then latched onto a Sergio Busquets pass but Anthony Lopes sprung out to intercept. Jason Denayer was not as quick in the 16th minute. By the time he had twisted to follow Messi's pass, the excellent Luis Suarez was a step ahead. Denayer slid but was nowhere near the ball and Suarez dragged his foot to make the contact clear. A penalty was given, although Messi was made to wait while VAR checked but there was no sign of tension. His chip down the middle was exquisite. Lyon improved and Moussa Dembele's shot needed a strong block from Clement Lenglet before Lopes collided with Coutinho and had to be replaced, in tears, in the 34th minute by Mathieu Gorgelin. That was not before Barca had scored a second as the faultless Arthur Melo played an angled pass into Suarez, who wriggled clear. With only Lopes to beat, he tapped across for Coutinho, who had an open net. Suarez let the ball run through his, and Marcelo's, legs while Messi twice could have added a third, once before half-time when he was denied from the angle, and once shortly after, when Fernando Marcal cleared his lifted finish off the line. Lyon looked dead and buried but found a way back in just before the hour. It came from a corner, which Barca three times failed to clear. Amid the scramble, Tousart had time to chest and volley into the corner. For 10 minutes, Barcelona were edgy but while Fekir lashed over, Lyon failed to step forward. Their momentum subsided and Messi finished them off in a late flurry. First, his dummy sent Denayer and Marcelo flying and his shot was too strong for the weak hand of Gorgelin. Then, he twice tore away on the counter-attack, finding Pique at the back post and finally Dembele, who made it five."
89,12/03/2019,18:05,"Barca to make late Dembele call for Lyon, says Valverde","Barcelona will make a late decision on the fitness of Ousmane Dembele ahead of their Champions League second leg against Lyon, coach Ernesto Valverde said on Tuesday.","Dembele sustained a minor hamstring strain against Rayo Vallecano on Saturday and is a doubt for the game at the Camp Nou, where Lyon arrive after a 0-0 draw in the first leg. ""We will see how he is and make a decision later,"" Valverde said. ""It is an important match but we cannot take any risks. If he isn't fit, he will have to wait for the next opportunity,"" he added. Dembele's absence could mean a start for Philippe Coutinho, who has struggled in recent weeks and was whistled off by a minority of Barcelona fans when substituted last weekend. Signed for 160 million euros ($180 million) from Liverpool just over a year ago, Coutinho has started 16 of Barcelona's 27 La Liga games this season. Asked if he had spoken to the Brazilian about his form, Valverde said: ""The way we handle the players is a private matter. What we want is for them to give us their best and we expect a lot from him."" The pressure is on Coutinho, and Barca, to deliver against Lyon on Wednesday as they aim to make amends for a disappointing run of three consecutive quarter-final exits in the Champions League. ""The fact that Paris Saint-Germain and Madrid have been eliminated tells you how hard the competition is and warns us to be vigilant,"" Valverde said. ""The pressure is on to progress but we focus on the game and if we generate the same chances as we did in the first leg, we will go through."" Madrid sacked Santiago Solari and re-appointed Zinedine Zidane as coach on Monday after they lost to Ajax in the last 16, a defeat that came after consecutive losses to Barcelona. ""He's a great coach,"" Valverde said of Zidane. ""We look forward to facing him next season."""
90,12/03/2019,03:00,"Lyon hoping Fekir, Depay rise to the occasion in Barcelona","Lyon go to Barcelona for their Champions League last 16, second leg on Wednesday hoping to pull off a shock result with the tie still open after a goalless draw in France last month.","The odds appear stacked against the French club -- it is nine years since they won a Champions League knockout-round tie, while Barcelona are unbeaten in their last 29 home games in the competition, winning 26 of those. Bruno Genesio's team could also be without their influential Brazilian centre-back Marcelo after he pulled up injured at the weekend, but they do have two potential match-winners further forward. Lyon's prospects of a top-three finish in France and a return to next season's Champions League were compromised in a 2-2 draw at Strasbourg on Saturday. Genesio rested a host of key players and the move backfired as OL surrendered a two-goal lead in the second half. Nabil Fekir was one of those who started the game on the bench, although he came on late as Lyon looked for the winner. The club captain is Lyon's main man, and one for the big occasion after featuring for France on their run to World Cup glory last year. Scorer of 12 goals this season, the 25-year-old was missed in the first leg against Barcelona as he served a suspension but will be back in an attacking midfield role on Wednesday. ""When Nabil is on the field, we know what to expect, he's a great player who gives us reassurance. He has already shown his importance on the European scene,"" said teammate Martin Terrier of Fekir, who scored in Lyon's 2-1 win at Manchester City in the group stage and also netted the decisive goal against Shakhtar Donetsk that clinched their place in the last 16. Can he repeat the feat at the Camp Nou? Lyon's detractors see them as a side who can mix it with the best one week only to go missing in games they are expected to win. They took four points from Manchester City in the group stage and beat Paris Saint-Germain last month before holding Barcelona in the first leg. But Saturday's match in Strasbourg encapsulated that inconsistency after they seemed to have the points in the bag thanks to Moussa Dembele's double. If Lyon's Jekyll and Hyde nature is summed up by one player, then it has to be Memphis Depay. The Dutchman has relaunched a career that stalled at Manchester United since moving to France for an initial 16 million euros in January 2017. So much so that he recently said in an interview with a Dutch magazine that he wanted ""a new transfer to a top-level club this summer. Lyon is a big club but it's not one of the five best in Europe."" Unfortunately, the 25-year-old's comments came in the midst of a goal drought that would last for three-and-a-half months, taking in 17 appearances. However, he broke that by scoring in consecutive games before watching the entirety of Saturday's match from the bench to keep him fresh for Barcelona. ""Throughout the period where he wasn't scoring, he was still helping the team,"" said Genesio last week. ""Now he has been rewarded for his efforts -- in football, you get what you deserve."" Genesio must decide whether to start the ex-PSV Eindhoven star on the left wing, or use him as a central striker rather than top scorer Dembele."

We'll do everything we have to so he plays, but we have to wait until Sunday,"" Genesio told Canal+. Genesio added he plans to talk to the club's doctor after extra tests are carried out on the centre-back on Sunday.

Fekir and Traore were brought on during the last quarter of an hour looking for a late winner but their efforts were in vain.

93,08/03/2019,16:50,"Lyon, Rennes carrying French hopes in Europe after PSG exit","Paris Saint-Germain's repeated Champions League failures may reflect badly on French football, but Lyon and Rennes are still both in contention to qualify for European quarter-finals.","PSG are licking their wounds and reflecting on where they go from here after their humiliating exit at the hands of Manchester United in the last 16, one that has damaged the reputation of Ligue 1 abroad. ""The elimination of Paris is not good for our standing in Europe, nor for our image,"" said Monaco coach Leonardo Jardim, who took his team to the Champions League semi-finals in 2017. Jardim expressed hope that Lyon can do better when they face Barcelona away in their last 16, second leg next Wednesday. A 0-0 draw at home in the first leg means Bruno Genesio's side head to the Camp Nou for the return still in with a chance, even if they are by no means the favourites. For one thing, they have World Cup-winning captain Nabil Fekir back available after suspension kept him out of the first leg. In addition, Memphis Depay is back among the goals, scoring in each of the last two games after previously going three and a half months without finding the net. Lyon have already shown in taking four points off Manchester City in the group stage that they can mix it with the best teams on the continent, although Genesio insisted PSG's elimination does not add extra pressure for his side. ""We are competitors and we wanted to qualify regardless of PSG's result, so we will still want to do so. It changes nothing,"" said Genesio on Friday. ""I was very disappointed for their coach, their players and for French football. It just shows that in football everything is possible and you are never safe from anything."" Before going to Barcelona, Lyon face mid-table Strasbourg at the Stade de la Meinau on Saturday looking to stay on track for a top-three finish in Ligue 1. OL are five points behind second-placed Lille and five better off than Marseille in fourth -- only the top two qualify automatically for next season's Champions League. Meanwhile, Rennes can be optimistic about their chances of progressing to the Europa League quarter-finals after beating Arsenal 3-1 on Thursday in their last 16, first leg in Brittany. They head to London for the return next week after coming from behind to beat an Arsenal side who played more than half the game with 10 men, although their coach Julien Stephan sought to take the pressure off his team. ""Despite the victory, for me, Arsenal remain favourites given their past and their experience,"" said Stephan, who was appointed in December. ""The only thing I think is that we will need to score there, at least once, if not twice."" Regardless of what happens in the return, this is already Rennes' best ever European run. To put the result into some context, Arsenal are just one point behind Manchester United in the Premier League, while Rennes are 10th in Ligue 1, 34 points adrift of leaders PSG. Rennes are at home to relegation-threatened Caen on Sunday, but PSG will not play -- their game at Nantes was postponed with authorities concerned about the impact of ongoing ""yellow vest"" protests in France. Thomas Tuchel's team will be back in action next Tuesday away at Dijon. Fixtures (all times GMT)"
94,03/03/2019,20:18,Dembele nets double as Lyon thrash Toulouse,"Moussa Dembele scored twice as Lyon thrashed Toulouse 5-1 on Sunday to strengthen their grip on a top-three place in France, while second-placed Lille edged out Dijon.","Bruno Genesio's Lyon, who are also through to the French Cup semi-finals and claimed a 0-0 first-leg draw in the Champions League last 16 against Barcelona, continued their strong season by moving six points clear of fourth-placed Saint-Etienne. ""Often this season, we haven't been calm under pressure, but against Toulouse it was a good match,"" said Lyon captain Nabil Fekir, whose 21-year-old younger brother Yassin made his Ligue 1 debut as a 79th-minute substitute. ""Playing with my brother was a huge pleasure."" The home side took less than 10 minutes to break the deadlock at the Groupama Stadium as Memphis Depay fired home a wonderful individual goal. Mathieu Dossevi levelled for Toulouse on the quarter-hour mark, but the visitors folded after Bertrand Traore restored Lyon's advantage in the 30th minute. Nabil Fekir netted a penalty five minutes later, and former Celtic striker Dembele compounded Toulouse's misery in the second half. He powered through the pitiful away defence midway through the second period and slotted a left-footed shot into the corner, before tapping in his 13th goal of the season shortly afterwards from Fekir's low cross. Traore also had another goal ruled out by VAR for offside, while Toulouse finished the game with 10 men as former Bastia midfielder Yannick Cahuzac was sent off for the 11th time in his Ligue 1 career. Lille remain second behind Paris Saint-Germain after Christophe Galtier's men claimed a narrow 1-0 win over struggling Dijon. With PSG still 17 points clear at the top with a game in hand, Lille are well-placed to secure a return to the Champions League group stage for the first time since 2012. Dijon, who remain five points from safety in 19th spot, made life tough for Lille at the Stade Pierre-Mauroy until Wesley Lautoa put through his own net in the 72nd minute. ""We will continue to work to be able to hold off the teams who want to take our place, qualifying for the Champions League is a dream we will try to achieve,"" said Lille forward Rui Fonte. Elsewhere, Patrick Vieira's Nice boosted their hopes of qualifying for next season's Europa League as Youcef Atal's 20th-minute strike was enough to see off Strasbourg 1-0. Nice are seventh in the table, three points adrift of fourth-placed Saint-Etienne."
95,20/02/2019,15:37,Three Lyon players become latest victims of game-time burglaries,"Three Lyon players were burgled while their club was playing Barcelona in the Champions League, continuing a recent pattern for players and officials at big French clubs.","Police said they were called at 0045 on Wednesday morning to the home of attacker Memphis Depay, in the Lyon suburb of Ecully. Thieves had forced a window and took goods, mostly fashion items, of an unspecified value. Depay had already been burgled last September, while Lyon were playing Nice. On that occasion property worth more than one million euros was taken. Midfielders Lucas Tousart and Pape Cheikh Diop, who both came off the Lyon bench in the second half of the goalless draw, returned to their homes in the suburbs to the same unpleasant surprise. Thieves broke down a basement door at Tousart's home in Chaponost and took a bag and ""multimedia"". There were also signs that thieves tried to break into his car, said the local gendarmerie. Burglars broke in through Cheikh's terrace in Limonest and stole jewels and branded clothing. Officials and players in Marseille and Paris have also been the targets during games in recent months. The home of Marseille president Jacques-Henri Eyraud was robbed during the night of February 8 while he was in Dijon watching the team in Ligue 1. Forward Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting's house was broken into twice: once while PSG were playing in November and again in December by burglars who fled when they set off the alarm. PSG captain Thiago Silva was burgled in December while playing at the Parc des Princes. In December 2017, the Paris apartment of then-PSG coach Unai Emery was robbed as his team played Strasbourg."
96,20/02/2019,12:47,Concern for misfiring Suarez as goals dry up for Barcelona,"The image of a frustrated Lionel Messi with his hands on his hips in Barcelona's 0-0 Champions League draw in Lyon on Tuesday may reverberate the most around the world, but it is Luis Suarez's form in front of goal that is causing most concern in Catalonia.","Suarez laboured throughout much of the Champions League last 16, first leg in France, although he came as close as anyone to scoring for Barcelona when he fired just wide from a Jordi Alba cutback 20 minutes from time. Barca's recent struggles away from home at the business end of the Champions League go on -- it is now six matches without an away win in the knockout rounds, with just one goal scored in that time, since beating Arsenal 2-0 three years ago. Suarez, meanwhile, has now gone 16 away matches without scoring in the competition since a draw at Roma in the group stage in 2015. That adds up to more than 24 hours in total. ""I'd be worried if he were not creating chances, but he has always had chances, he creates them for his teammates, and he is a constant headache for opponents,"" said coach Ernesto Valverde in defence of the 32-year-old. Suarez has 16 goals in all competitions this season, but only one in his team's last eight matches. ""Maybe he is saving them for the games to come,"" added Valverde. The performance has added to the worries back in Catalonia, with Barcelona ""unable to translate their overwhelming dominance into a goal"", as the daily Sport put it on Wednesday. They had 24 attempts at goal, but just five were on target. ""Nobody had the punch, precision, sharpness or clarity to kill the game,"" said El Pais, with Barcelona ""victims of a negative run, all blinded, including the infallible Messi. It's a mystery"". It is not just their away form in Europe that is an issue -- Valverde's team have now won just one of their last five matches, drawing the other four. They have scored just once in their last three outings, and that was a Messi penalty against Valladolid last weekend. While drawing against a Lyon side deprived of their World Cup-winning captain Nabil Fekir due to suspension could be seen as a missed opportunity, the result also needs to be put into context. Lyon had already taken four points from Manchester City in the group stage and recently beat Paris Saint-Germain in Ligue 1. They have not lost in Europe this season. Barcelona should still finish the job in the return at the Camp Nou on March 13. After all, of their last 29 home matches in the competition, they have won 26 and drawn three, losing none. Messi -- who made his 130th Champions League appearance on Tuesday, equalling Andres Iniesta's tally of games in the competition -- has not been at his majestic best in the last couple of weeks, but he has scored 30 goals this season. It would be wrong to question him, but fatigue has to be a worry for the Argentine and his team. Tuesday's game was Barca's 13th in 2019 in all competitions, and this is an ageing side. While a young Lyon team featured nine players aged between 20 and 25, Barcelona fielded five players in their 30s at the Groupama Stadium. All of them -- Gerard Pique, Sergio Busquets, Ivan Rakitic, Messi and Suarez -- are vital, and Valverde needs them at their best in the weeks ahead. There are two trips to Real Madrid to come in the next 10 days, one in the Copa del Rey and one in La Liga. An eighth league title in 11 seasons seems likely, but there is work to be done if they are to be the side to end Madrid's recent dominance in the Champions League, starting up front."
97,20/02/2019,00:10,Valverde finds positives as Barcelona draw blank in Lyon to leave tie open,Barcelona coach Ernesto Valverde shrugged off his team's struggles in front of goal after they were held to a 0-0 draw away at Lyon in the first leg of their Champions League last-16 tie on Tuesday.,"The Spanish side had most of the chances at the Groupama Stadium, with Luis Suarez firing just wide in the second half, although it was Lyon who came the closest when Martin Terrier hit the bar early on. Lionel Messi and co. were once again left frustrated on the road at the business end of the competition, and have now gone six away matches without winning in the Champions League knockout rounds, scoring just a single goal in that time. It is a run that goes back three years. Desperate to end Real Madrid's recent European dominance, Barca must now finish the job when the teams meet again at the Camp Nou on March 13, but Lyon remain in the tie. Barcelona's form needs to improve between now and then, though -- they have drawn four of their last five matches in all, and have scored just once, from a penalty, in their last three outings. ""We played good football, but you have to hit the target as well, and we didn't,"" Valverde said. ""We are on the right road, though, and the tie is still up in the air. We will try to win it in front of our fans."" He added: ""I am not happy with the result, but I am happy with the performance and with what we created. ""We didn't score, but that is how it is. It is not easy to win away from home in the Champions League."" The visitors -- who started with Sergi Roberto in midfield rather than the out-of-form Philippe Coutinho -- had good reason to be wary of their hosts, who have excelled in big games this season. Bruno Genesio's team had taken four points from a possible six against Manchester City in the group stage and recently won at home to Paris Saint-Germain in Ligue 1. They are still unbeaten in Europe this season, although this was their sixth consecutive draw. ""It's a satisfying result because it leaves us with a chance for the second leg, and we didn't concede. If we can score at the Camp Nou we'll have a chance of going through,"" said Genesio. He admitted that he had hoped for an even better performance, but Lyon were missing their World Cup-winning captain Nabil Fekir due to suspension here. It was the 21-year-old Terrier who surprisingly started in his place, and he delivered the most exciting moment of the first half for the crowd of almost 58,000 with a thunderous strike from 20 yards out in the ninth minute that was tipped onto the bar by Marc-Andre ter Stegen. The same player later shot over at the end of a fantastic move, while Houssem Aouar had earlier been denied by the goalkeeper, but it was Barcelona who enjoyed the longer spells of possession. Ousmane Dembele -- one of two Frenchmen in the away line-up -- came closest for them in the first half, although their best chances came after he had been replaced by Coutinho midway through the second period. Suarez came within inches of breaking the deadlock 20 minutes from time, firing narrowly wide from Jordi Alba's cutback. He has now gone 16 away matches without scoring in the competition. Coutinho had a powerful shot beaten away by Anthony Lopes, with the Lyon goalkeeper also frustrating Messi and Sergio Busquets as Barcelona dominated but departed without a potentially precious away goal. ""It is a little bit of a disappointment, but there is still the second leg to come and we hope to do better,"" said defender Clement Lenglet. At least they extended their unbeaten record against Lyon to seven matches, but there remains hope for the French club ahead of the return."

It is a run that goes back three years. Desperate to end Real Madrid's recent European dominance, Barca must now finish the job when the teams meet again at the Camp Nou on March 13, but Lyon remain very much in the tie. Barcelona's form needs to improve between now and then, though -- the Catalans have drawn four of their last five matches in all, and have scored just once, from a penalty, in their last three outings. With Arthur missing due to injury, Valverde opted to play Sergi Roberto in midfield here, leaving the out-of-form Philippe Coutinho on the bench alongside Arturo Vidal. That may have been an acknowledgement that the visitors were wary of Lyon's flying left-back Ferland Mendy, who has been linked with Barca in some quarters. The visitors were certainly right to be wary of a Lyon side whose best performances this season have come against the big boys -- four points from a possible six against Manchester City in the group stage and a recent win at home to Paris Saint-Germain in Ligue 1. The French club were without their World Cup-winning captain Nabil Fekir due to suspension though, and it was the 21-year-old Terrier who was surprisingly handed a start in his place. Terrier is an unassuming talent, but he delivered the most exciting moment of the first half for the crowd of almost 58,000 with a thunderous strike from 20 yards out in the ninth minute that was tipped onto the bar by Marc-Andre ter Stegen.

Suarez came within inches of breaking the deadlock 20 minutes from the end, firing narrowly wide with a first-time shot from Jordi Alba's cutback. Coutinho then had a powerful shot beaten away by Anthony Lopes, with the Lyon goalkeeper also frustrating Messi and Sergio Busquets as Barcelona dominated but departed without a potentially precious away goal.

99,18/02/2019,20:08,Valverde calls on Barcelona to overcome away-day challenge in Champions League,Barcelona coach Ernesto Valverde hopes his team have learned the lessons of last year' humiliation in Rome as they look for a rare win on the road in the Champions League in Tuesday's clash with Lyon.,"The Spanish champions are in France for the first leg of their last-16 tie, their first knockout match in the competition since their shock collapse in last season's quarter-finals. Then, Barcelona lost 3-0 away to Roma to bow out on away goals after winning 4-1 in the first leg at home. They have not won any of their last five away games in the Champions League knockout rounds, losing four of them while scoring just once and conceding 13 goals. ""It shows that it is a hard competition, but challenges are there to be overcome,"" said Valverde at a press conference at Lyon's Groupama Stadium on Monday. He pointed out that his team had performed well on the road in this season's group stage, taking seven points from a possible nine and notably beating Tottenham Hotspur 4-2 at Wembley. ""It was also said that we couldn't score goals but we have done that this season against difficult opponents like Tottenham and Inter."" The humiliation against Roma last season clouded Valverde's debut campaign in charge at the Camp Nou, despite the Catalans winning a domestic double. But they came into this season spurred on by a desire to end Real Madrid's recent dominance in Europe as they look to lift the Champions League trophy for the first time since 2015. ""When we came into that match (against Roma), I remember everyone telling us they were the best opponents for us, that they were the weakest side, but that did not help us,"" Valverde added. ""We need to come into these games not with our guard down but with our guard up."" Barcelona come to France having lost just twice in the last three months, and both losses came in Copa del Rey ties they eventually won over two legs. Their recent performances have been patchy, however, with three straight draws preceding Saturday's laboured 1-0 win over Valladolid, secured thanks to a Lionel Messi penalty. ""Our problem has always been away from home, but it also depends on the order of the two legs,"" said midfielder Sergio Busquets, who played when Barcelona drew 1-1 in Lyon at this stage 10 years ago, on the way to a 6-3 aggregate victory. ""We know how to suffer, which you have to do in every game, especially in the Champions League."" The return will be at the Camp Nou on March 13, and Busquets added: ""You get chances in every game, and we need to try to improve on previous years and get a good result for the second leg."""
100,18/02/2019,18:08,Man City match-ups give Lyon inspiration ahead of Barcelona clash,"Lyon coach Bruno Genesio says his team's performances against Manchester City in the group stage prove they can compete with Barcelona in Tuesday's Champions League last 16, first leg.","The French club are in the knockout phase of the competition for the first time in seven years after emerging from their group unbeaten. They beat Pep Guardiola's City side 2-1 away before a 2-2 home draw with the Premier League leaders. ""They are two teams who have the same way of playing -- they like to have possession of the ball, and they like to attack,"" Genesio said at a press conference at Lyon's Groupama Stadium on Monday. ""The experience can help us -- we played really well in the two games against City, and if we were capable of doing it against them, we can do it again."" An inconsistent Lyon side are often their own worst enemy, and they are a huge 16 points behind Ligue 1 leaders Paris Saint-Germain in third place, having played two games more. However, they are the only team in the league to have beaten PSG this season, winning 2-1 at home earlier this month. That was after they lost 5-0 in Paris back in October despite being the better team for long spells. ""Even in Paris we managed to raise our game against a Champions League side,"" Genesio pointed out. ""We need to have confidence and belief as well, but I think Barcelona will raise their game compared to recent matches."" Lyon's biggest problem is that captain Nabil Fekir will miss the first leg. The World Cup winner scored the goal that gave them a 1-1 draw at Shakhtar Donetsk in their last group game to take them through, but a booking a few minutes later means he is suspended here. ""Nabil is our captain and our leader from a technical viewpoint, so obviously it is difficult,"" Genesio said. ""He is capable of being decisive and often performs very well in these games, but being a team is also about coping with absences and having players who can take his place. We will do what we can in the absence of Nabil."" Genesio also admitted that there are doubts surrounding the fitness of both Jason Denayer and Tanguy Ndombele. Belgian defender Denayer suffered an adductor injury in Friday's 2-1 win over Guingamp in Ligue 1, while French international Ndombele -- a vital presence in midfield -- has been struggling with an ankle problem and did not play at the weekend. ""In my head my starting line-up is clear, but what the doctors tell me might make me change my mind,"" the coach added."
101,18/02/2019,02:30,All falling into place? Lyon building foundations for big future,"Gone are the days when Lyon were France's dominant club, winning seven straight league titles in the last decade, and Tuesday's last 16, first leg against Barcelona will be their first Champions League knockout match in seven years.","Unable to keep up with Paris Saint-Germain in Ligue 1, it would be a major shock if Bruno Genesio's team beat the Catalans over two legs. However, while 'OL' have no Lionel Messi, and their revenue last season was less than a quarter of Barcelona's -- a huge 690.4 million euros ($780m) according to the Deloitte Football Money League -- they are genuine competitors to Barca elsewhere. According to analysis by the CIES (International Centre for Sports Studies) Football Observatory on the number of players to have been trained at youth level by clubs who have gone on to play in Europe's five leading leagues since 2014, Lyon are right on the tails of Spain's giants. Barcelona and Real Madrid each provided 69 players, with Lyon third on the list with 56, two fewer than Manchester United but with more minutes played overall. Barcelona have not been as reliant on youth from their renowned La Masia academy recently, tending towards buying proven talent instead, including France centre-back Samuel Umtiti from Lyon. Meanwhile, three of Lyon's starters as they beat Guingamp on Friday emerged from their academy: goalkeeper Anthony Lopes, Houssem Aouar and Nabil Fekir. The latter helped France to World Cup glory in Russia, and a move at the end of this season seems likely, with Fekir set to follow in the footsteps of many before him. Since OL last won the title in 2008, the list of youth products to have come through before being sold for big money is a long one -- Karim Benzema, Anthony Martial, Umtiti, Alexandre Lacazette and Corentin Tolisso to name a few. Youth development is vital for Lyon. ""In terms of youth development, we invest more than any other club in France by a long way -- more than 10 million euros a year, and that is growing all the time,"" said long-serving president Jean-Michel Aulas. Keeping young players until their peak is not always possible, just as Lyon are unable to compete with Europe's giants when it comes to buying talent. Instead, they have been successful at signing gifted youngsters from smaller teams, notably Tanguy Ndombele. Bought from Amiens for 10 million euros, the midfielder has broken into the France squad and could move for in excess of 50 million. There is also cause for optimism regarding the future for the club, whose listed holding company OL Groupe is part-owned by Chinese investors. In a country where, as a general rule, clubs do not own their stadiums, Aulas has overseen the construction of a privately-funded, 59,000-seat ground, the Groupama Stadium, that is among Europe's best. The club now plan to build an adjacent, covered arena for other events, with capacity for up to 15,000. ""Others invest primarily in players, while we preferred to start with the infrastructure and then build a competitive team,"" said Aulas. They already have Europe's best women's team -- led by Ballon d'Or winner, Ada Hegerberg -- and the Groupama Stadium will host the women's World Cup final in July. Taking the men's team to the next level could be considered the missing piece of the jigsaw, and Lyon's aim is to ""break into the top 20 clubs in Europe"", and hit the 400 million-euro mark in annual revenue. A more regular presence at this stage of the Champions League is the aim, but can all that help OL beat Barcelona, especially with Fekir suspended on Tuesday? ""Manchester City are one of the best sides around and we beat them,"" Brazilian defender Marcelo told AFP. ""Maybe this year will mark the return of the great years for Lyon in the Champions League."""
102,15/02/2019,23:27,Lyon ready for 'game of season' with Barcelona after Guingamp win,"Lyon edged rock-bottom Guingamp 2-1 in Ligue 1 on Friday with a fabulous winner from captain Nabil Fekir, just days ahead of Barcelona's visit for a Champions League clash.","Lyon consolidated third place in Ligue 1 while resting a couple of key players and even taking their foot off the gas with Barcelona in mind. ""It's our game of the year, it'll be a big match, but we often do well in them,"" Lyon president Jean Michel Aulas told French TV. ""Bruno (Genesio the Lyon coach) takes tactical risks and we have surprised (Manchester) City before, and this stadium was built for matches like this,"" he added on their 60,000-capacity home. ""Many of the players had Tuesday on their minds but with Barcelona coming that's normal,"" said Genesio, mastermind of the four points Lyon took off City in the group phase to squeeze into the last-16. ""We have some doubts still about who is playing on Tuesday, but you'll have to wait until Monday to find out,"" Genesio added. Ahead of their Sunday game with Saint Etienne, PSG still lead Ligue 1 on 59 points with Lille second on 49 and Lyon third on 46. Martin Terrier put Lyon ahead after a scramble on 15 minutes before defender Leo Dubois was then overpowered five minutes later by Guingamp's Cameroon midfielder Felix Eboa Eboa, who rushed in for a header at the far post shouldering the defender out of the way to make it 1-1. But then on 35 minutes Fekir controlled the ball on his chest, took a quick touch to set himself up for the shot and curled a fabulous left-foot shot into the top corner from outside the box. Fekir, however, will miss the game against Barcelona through suspension. ""I'll be in the stadium supporting my teammates from the stands and I'll believe in them all the way,"" said French international Fekir. One other worry for Lyon was the loss of lively striker Moussa Dembele, who was replaced late on by Dutch forward Memphis Depay. Earlier Friday, Nimes secured top flight survival with a 2-0 win over Dijon"
103,07/02/2019,23:04,In-form Dembele scores as Lyon reach French Cup quarters,Former Celtic striker Moussa Dembele continued his strong run of form with the opening goal as Lyon saw off Guingamp 2-1 to reach the French Cup quarter-finals on Thursday.,"Lyon, who are looking for a first major trophy since 2012, will face Caen in the last eight in three weeks' time. The visitors backed up their 2-1 win over runaway Ligue 1 leaders Paris Saint-Germain at the weekend by beating the top flight's bottom club Guingamp. Dembele put Bruno Genesio's side ahead in the seventh minute by latching onto a long ball forward and slotting home his fifth goal in six games, having scored and won a penalty against PSG. Maxwel Cornet volleyed in Ferland Mendy's cross four minutes after half-time as Guingamp's Cup run ended despite a late consolation from Alexandre Mendy. Holders PSG, who face Manchester United in the Champions League last 16 next week, needed extra time to beat third-tier Villefranche 3-0 on Wednesday to progress."
104,03/02/2019,23:01,Dembele stars as Lyon end PSG's unbeaten run,Moussa Dembele scored and won a penalty as Lyon stunned Paris Saint-Germain 2-1 on Sunday to end the runaway leaders' hopes of an unbeaten Ligue 1 campaign.,"Angel Di Maria fired PSG into a seventh-minute lead, but Dembele equalised and Nabil Fekir scored the winner from the spot three minutes after half-time. ""I don't know if the defeat was deserved. In the first half it was deserved, but after half-time, we still dominated,"" said PSG forward Kylian Mbappe. The reigning champions remain 10 points clear of second-placed Lille at the top of the table despite the defeat, with two games in hand, while Lyon strengthened their grip on third spot, three points further back. ""We did what we had planned, namely high pressing, quick transitions, and to cause them problems every time we had the ball,"" said Lyon coach Bruno Genesio. ""I don't think they're used to that in Ligue 1."" All eyes will now turn to the Champions League for PSG, with only a French Cup tie at third-tier Villefranche and a home game against Bordeaux to come before the last-16, first-leg clash with Manchester United at Old Trafford on February 12. Man United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and his assistant Mike Phelan were both in attendance at the Groupama Stadium on Sunday, just hours after their side's 1-0 Premier League win at Leicester. The pair would have learned plenty from watching Lyon regularly slice through the PSG defence against seemingly little resistance, while Mbappe shouldered the majority of the attacking responsibility in the absence of the injured Neymar. ""I'm not worried about the Champions League,"" insisted Mbappe. ""We must take it match by match and wait for the Champions League."" On paper, this looked the toughest test remaining for PSG in their bid to go through the league season unbeaten, having won on just two of their previous 13 Ligue 1 visits to Lyon, losing seven. But Thomas Tuchel's men almost forged ahead inside the first two minutes, as Kylian Mbappe raced clear only to shoot tamely at Lyon goalkeeper Anthony Lopes. The away side did not have to wait long to strike, though, as Houssem Aouar carelessly gifted possession to Julian Draxler, who strode forward and teed up Di Maria to slot in his 10th goal of the season. But Lyon, on a six-match unbeaten run in the league themselves, quickly improved and twice wasted clear-cut chances to level, as PSG 'keeper Alphonse Areola denied Bertrand Traore from point-blank range before Dembele nodded wide. Areola had to be alert again, springing to his right to tip away a vicious long-range drive from Nabil Fekir, before producing a wonderful double stop from Traore and Memphis Depay. However, just seconds after another excellent save to deny Fekir, Areola was totally at fault for Lyon's 33rd-minute equaliser. The 25-year-old misjudged Leo Dubois' cross, allowing Dembele the simplest of tasks to head into the net. PSG almost snatched a half-time lead against the run of play, but Lyon centre-back Jason Denayer made an incredible diving header to keep out Draxler's close-range shot. Lyon, who face Barcelona in the Champions League knockout stage, continued to dominate after the restart, and were awarded a spot-kick when Dembele was brought down by Thiago Silva, with Fekir doing the rest. That provoked PSG into life, and Lopes made two brilliant saves from Mbappe in the space of just 20 seconds. Mbappe was PSG's best hope of salvaging their unbeaten record, but he saw Lopes divert away a low drive, before former Celtic striker Dembele wasted a golden opportunity to wrap up the points as he was again foiled by Areola. But Lyon held on anyhow, ending their opponents' 21-game unbeaten run in the French top flight."

Lyon is a big club but it's not one of the five best in Europe,"" the Dutch international told Helden Magazine. ""I want to go to a club like Real Madrid, Barcelona, Chelsea, Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain or Bayern Munich,"" he added, saying he wanted to join a club that ""suits me"" and play ""in a team that really wants to play football."" He added: ""I always talk about Real Madrid, a royal club. White and gold shirts,"" he added. Depay added that he was still ""focused"" at Lyon ""and then we'll see where I end up."" Depay joined Lyon in January 2016 on a 16 million euro transfer from Manchester United where he had fallen out of favour."
106,27/01/2019,23:14,PSG cruise to victory as worries grow over Neymar fitness,Edinson Cavani scored twice as Paris Saint-Germain shook off the loss of Neymar to injury with a 4-1 win over Rennes at the Parc des Princes on Sunday that keeps them unbeaten at the top of Ligue 1.,"The Uruguayan's goals took him to 16 for the season in 14 league appearances and bookended the scoring in the French capital, with Angel Di Maria and Kylian Mbappe also on target for PSG. Mbaye Niang had equalised for Rennes in the first half, but Thomas Tuchel's side eventually ran away with the game after the break and are once again a massive 13 points ahead of Lille at the top of the table, with two matches in hand. Despite that, this encounter was played out in a rather flat atmosphere, with one end of the stadium partially closed as a punishment following incidents during a game late last year. Brazil coach Tite and national team coordinator Edu were in attendance at the start of a European tour to check on the form of some of their key players, but it is unclear what they will have taken from this game. Neymar was missing after suffering a metatarsal injury in a French Cup win over Strasbourg in midweek, with some media reports in France now claiming that the world's most expensive player will definitely miss the first leg of their Champions League last-16 tie against Manchester United on February 12. Meanwhile, a lack of alternatives meant Tuchel fielded Marquinhos and Daniel Alves out of position together in midfield. On top of that, skipper Thiago Silva was caught out as Niang flicked Rennes level just before the half-hour, cancelling out Cavani's headed opener from a Di Maria cross. Rennes were arguably the better side in the first half, although Tuchel was raging after Niang escaped with a yellow card for a dangerous challenge on Thilo Kehrer. The referee upheld his decision even after a VAR review. Nevertheless, PSG ran away with the game after the break, going back in front on the hour mark when Silva sent Di Maria through to clip a delightful finish over Tomas Koubek. When Clement Grenier was caught in possession, Julian Draxler released Mbappe to score his 18th league goal of the campaign and make it 3-1. PSG completed the scoring in the 71st minute when Mbappe squared for Cavani to grab his second of the evening, making it 15 goals in three home wins for them in nine days. Earlier, Lyon strengthened their grip on a Champions League position after defender Jason Denayer's headed goal handed them a 1-0 win at Amiens. With their Champions League last-16 first leg against Barcelona looming on the horizon, Lyon remain third in Ligue 1, three points behind second-placed Lille. Lille won 2-1 at Marseille on Friday in a game which was held up for more than half an hour in the second half after a firecracker thrown from the stands exploded next to home player Kevin Strootman. Struggling Monaco slumped to a 2-0 defeat at relegation rivals Dijon on Saturday in their first game since Thierry Henry was sacked as coach. Henry lasted just three months in charge before being replaced by his predecessor Leonardo Jardim, who watched Saturday's game in the stands in Dijon. Monaco remain three points from outright safety."
107,21/01/2019,00:08,Last-gasp Dembele wins derby for Lyon as Marseille halt slide,"Moussa Dembele grabbed a stoppage-time winner for Lyon in a 2-1 victory over bitter foes Saint-Etienne on Sunday, while Marseille snapped a wretched run of nine games without a win as they beat Caen 1-0 in Ligue 1.","Romain Hamouma headed Saint-Etienne into the lead on 21 minutes at the Stade Geoffroy Guichard, but Nabil Fekir converted a second-half penalty to haul Lyon level following a handball by Loic Perrin. An unmarked Dembele headed over in the dying stages after coming on as a substitute, but the forward made no mistake with another chance moments later to floor the hosts in the 95th minute. ""We do this job for this kind of feeling,"" said Lyon coach Bruno Genesio. ""It was an excellent derby. Both teams got properly into it."" Lyon goalkeeper Anthony Lopes had earlier pulled off a stunning triple save to keep the visitors in the game, twice denying the in-form Wahbi Khazri before tipping away Hamouma's follow-up. Saint-Etienne again had a chance to win the match in a frantic goalmouth scramble but Remy Cabella was thwarted by Lopes and Leo Dubois produced a vital block to repel Lois Diony's subsequent effort. ""Honestly, I knew this job was cruel but today was a bit of a knockout blow,"" said Saint-Etienne coach Jean-Louis Gasset. ""We gave everything. Both teams had chances and would have each deserved a point."" A pitch invasion by angry home fans caused a lengthy stoppage when Lyon won 5-0 last season, and tempers again briefly threatened to boil over following the final whistle on Sunday. Lyon climbed back above their rivals into third place after dealing Saint-Etienne a first home loss of the season. Earlier, Marseille recorded a first win since late November despite losing the influential Dimitri Payet to a knee injury after just 24 minutes. Morgan Sanson, on as a substitute for Payet, guided home a header from a Kevin Strootman cross two minutes after the interval to earn Marseille a welcome three points. Caen played most of the second half with 10 men after Frederic Guilbert was dismissed for a second booking. Marseille had faced angry supporters in heated exchanges following last weekend's 1-1 home draw with Monaco, the culmination of a dismal run that included a humiliating French Cup defeat by fourth-tier amateurs Andrezieux at the start of the month. ""I'm not relieved. I'm happy for the players because it confirms the good things we'd done in the last two matches against Monaco and Saint-Etienne,"" said Marseille coach Rudi Garcia, who again faced calls to resign from Marseille fans in the away section. He also provided an update on Payet, saying he was unsure whether he would be available for next week's visit of Lille. ""I don't know. It's never good when it's the knee,"" said Garcia. ""He felt it all of a sudden... I think it was a Caen player who fell on top of him, or something like that, when he was on the ground."" Marseille moved up to seventh and to within six points of the Champions League spots after inflicting a fifth home defeat in six outings on a Caen outfit with just three wins all season. Kylian Mbappe and Edinson Cavani both scored hat-tricks on Saturday as Paris Saint-Germain romped to their biggest-ever home win with a 9-0 thrashing of bottom side Guingamp. Meanwhile, Thierry Henry's nightmare spell in charge of Monaco took another turn for the worse as Cesc Fabregas gifted Strasbourg a goal and fellow new signing Naldo was shown a seventh-minute red card in a 5-1 home humbling."

PSG coach Thomas Tuchel can also go on holiday relaxed with his club on 47 points, as second-placed Lille, 13 points adrift, lost 2-1 at home to Toulouse. ""I'm very happy because we can see the progress of the team,"" said Tuchel. ""You can feel the energy, it's a good thing to build on next year."" With Neymar away, Angel Di Maria was in the line-up and came closest to making it 2-0, forcing a fine save from Nantes goalkeeper Ciprian Tatarusanu, who then watched the Argentine hit the crossbar from the rebound. Meanwhile, third-placed Lyon drew 1-1 at fourth-placed Montpellier after opening the scoring thanks to their captain Nabil Fekir before a great header from Ruben Aguilar gave the surprise-package southerners a share of the spoils. Henry's Monaco were dreadful and the former Arsenal striker spat on the ground after Nolan Roux of Guingamp made fools of the Monaco defence to make it 2-0. ""I'm not going to have a good holiday,"" bemoaned Henry. ""Now you have to work and make do with what you have. ""It's necessary to work and work. There are still a lot of points to play for and that's the only positive thing about this evening."" Monaco were champions in 2017 but now have 13 points from 18 matches, just two more than Guingamp, and vice-president Vadim Vasilyev said the club needs to dip into the January transfer market. ""Until tonight, I thought we didn't need new players, but we do,"" Vasilyev told Canal+. ""It's difficult to analyse right now as I'm upset like the supporters. I understand the disappointment, it's up to us to act and draw the right conclusions."" Strasbourg paid hommage to the victims of a terror attack that killed five people on December 11 in their first home game since as they won 2-0 against Nice.

""It was hard in difficult conditions. We gave ourselves a fright and it's a pity we didn't kill off the game in the first half,"" Lyon midfielder Houssem Aouar told RMC Sport. ""The main thing is that we've qualified."" Shakhtar forged ahead midway through the opening period with what proved their only shot of the first half, just seconds after Lyon forward Bertrand Traore had been denied by Andriy Pyatov when clean through one-on-one with the goalkeeper. The Burkina Faso international was made to pay for his profligacy, as Junior Moraes slotted home after being picked out by Ismaily. Lyon continued to dominate, though, and finally equalised in the 65th minute as Nabil Fekir hammered a left-footed strike into the top corner following excellent play by Memphis Depay. Man City wrapped up top spot in the group by coming from behind to beat Hoffenheim 2-1 at the Etihad Stadium. Andrej Kramaric gave Hoffenheim a surprise 16th-minute lead from the penalty spot, although Leroy Sane levelled on the stroke of half-time with a magnificent free-kick. City wasted a host of chances, with away goalkeeper Oliver Baumann in inspired form, but Sane grabbed his second just after the hour mark to complete the turnaround. Bayern Munich went into their game at Ajax just needing a point to beat their opponents to first place in Group E, and Niko Kovac's men did just that in a thrilling 3-3 draw. The game burst into life in the second half when Dusan Tadic equalised Robert Lewandowski's early opener just after the hour mark, with Ajax defender Maximilian Woeber sent off in the 67th minute for a dangerous lunge on Leon Goretzka. But Bayern were also reduced to 10 men only eight minutes later, as Thomas Mueller was given his marching orders for planting his studs into the head of Nicolas Tagliafico. Ajax briefly moved top of the live standings when Jerome Boateng carelessly conceded a penalty, which was dispatched emphatically into the roof of the net by Tadic. But Tagliafico brought down Thiago Alcantara, with Lewandowski slotting in the spot-kick, before Kingsley Coman looked to have settled matters with a wonderful 90th-minute strike. Tagliafico went up the other end to equalise again, but Ajax failed to find a winner as Bayern just about held on. ""That was an advert for football,"" smiled Kovac. ""The most important thing was to finish top of the group and with 14 from 18 points we are happy."" Juventus finished at the Group H summit ahead of Manchester United despite slumping to a 2-1 defeat by Young Boys in Bern, as Jose Mourinho's Premier League giants lost at Valencia. United had to beat Valencia and hope Juve failed to win in Switzerland, but Carlos Soler and a comical Phil Jones own goal did the damage for the visitors, with Marcus Rashford scoring a late consolation. ""I didn't learn anything at all,"" Mourinho said. ""Nothing surprised me at all."" Guillaume Hoarau netted twice to help Young Boys end their European campaign on a high note. CSKA Moscow stunned a much-changed Real Madrid with a 3-0 victory at the Santiago Bernabeu, but still finished bottom of Group G as Viktoria Plzen beat Roma. The Russian side, who also downed Real 1-0 in the reverse fixture, had to better Plzen's result to finish third and qualify for the Europa League. But Plzen edged out Roma 2-1 in the Czech Republic to render CSKA's famous victory ultimately meaningless, despite inflicting the heaviest ever European home loss on the record 13-time champions. ""It's sad to say the least to beat Real Madrid, earn seven points, but finish bottom and get eliminated from Europe,"" said CSKA coach Viktor Goncharenko. Holders Real had already progressed to the last 16 as group winners, with Roma through in second place. Home coach Santiago Solari boosted CSKA's hopes before kick-off by making seven changes to his starting XI, and goals from Fedor Chalov, Georgiy Schennikov and Arnor Sigurdsson gave CSKA a comprehensive win."
110,11/12/2018,21:14,Shakhtar coach believes in 'fantastic' outcome against Lyon,"Paulo Fonseca said on Tuesday he believes his Shakhtar Donetsk side are ready for a ""fantastic"" victory as they aim to overhaul Lyon in their all-or-nothing Champions League clash.","Shakhtar are two points behind second-placed Lyon heading into Wednesday's final Group F match in Kiev, and must win in order to qualify for the competition's last 16. ""Tomorrow we will face a very strong, very difficult opponent. But there is nothing impossible in football,"" the Portuguese told reporters. ""We need a victory. Lyon are now in the lead, they will be satisfied with both a draw and a win, and only a victory will suit us. ""If tomorrow it happens, it will be something fantastic. It will be remembered by absolutely everyone and it will be very good for our team."" Shakhtar retained the Ukrainian title in May and are seven points clear of Dynamo Kiev in the current championship race. But their task in the Champions League was made harder last week when the decider against Lyon was switched from their temporary home ground in Kharkiv to Kiev, some 700 kilometres (435 miles) from their home city of Donetsk. Eastern Ukraine's Kharkiv fell under the martial law decree issued in November by the Kiev government amid tensions with Russia, leaving fans with a huge round trip to back their team. ""I believe, our team believe that tomorrow all our players will be super motivated and we will try to win and go through,"" Fonseca said. Lyon coach Bruno Genesio, meanwhile, says the Ligue 1 outfit will play their own game as they attempt to secure qualification. Lyon, who impressed in taking four points off group leaders Manchester City, need just a point to ensure a spot in the knockout stages. ""We need to attack this match... we know our ability to play regardless of where we are or the opponent,"" said Genesio. ""The best way to qualify is to play our game and not worry about what could happen."""
111,10/12/2018,03:01,Shakhtar prepare for home match 700 kilometres from home,It is a big week for Shakhtar Donetsk and their fans as they prepare to host Lyon in the final round of Champions League group games on Wednesday.,"But the spectre of war has cast a shadow over the match with the fans now expected to travel over 700 kilometres (435 miles) to watch their own team 'at home'. Victory over the visiting French side will see Shakhtar, the Ukrainian champions, book their place alongside Group F winners Manchester City in the last 16 of Europe's top club tournament. A draw will be enough for Lyon to progress at Shakhtar's expense, so for the Ukrainians it is all or nothing. Anticipation among the players and the fans of a packed and pulsating home stadium cheering the team to a place among the very elite of Europe was rising... until the match was moved last week to the capital Kiev. Shakhtar will now host Lyon in a city over 700 kilometres away from home, the lair of one of their biggest rivals. The reason? War. And the introduction of martial law. In late November, Russia seized three Ukrainian navy vessels and detained 24 crew members in the most dangerous incident in years between the ex-Soviet neighbours. In response, Kiev imposed martial law for 30 days in 10 regions that border Russia, including Shakhtar's temporary home in Kharkiv. That in turn prompted UEFA to move the Shakhtar-Lyon match to Kiev. ""It's very hard for a club to play in an alien city,"" Ruslan, a Shakhtar supporter from Donetsk, told AFP. ""The team, of course, lacks all those fans... their support."" Shakhtar fans have become used to having to travel to home games. For the last two years, the club has been sheltering in Kharkiv, a mere 300 kilometres from their Donbass Arena in Donetsk, which they abandoned in 2014 when the region fell under the control of Russia-backed separatists. Kharkiv was a step up for the fans as Shakhtar has spent two years travelling over 1,200 kilometres to play home games in Lviv on the other side of the country. Shakhtar's coach Paulo Fonseca has urged fans to support the team in the capital. ""We regret that the match venue has been changed, causing inconvenience for our fans who planned to attend the match in Kharkiv... We hope for your support in Kiev!"" the Portuguese manager said in a statement to the fans on the club website. The club even offered to book the best seats at the 70,000-seat Olympic Stadium in Kiev for those supporters who bought tickets to the Kharkiv arena, but now are willing to come to the capital. The problem for the fans is twofold. Distance is certainly a factor but the other stumbling block for them is that they will have to play in the capital, home of their longtime rival Dynamo Kiev. They can hardly rely on local support. ""It would be better to play in Kharkiv. There are more of our fans there,"" Shakhtar fan Sergiy Tsvelyov told AFP. ""I myself planned to go (to Kharkiv). But it will be very difficult for me to go to Kiev,"" the 20-year-old student, who lives in a small town in eastern Ukraine, said. Fonseca and his players are doing their best not to be distracted by the switch and head into the match in good spirits. ""We do not feel any danger in the cities which we visit,"" said Fonseca. After retaining the Ukrainian title in May, Fonseca's side are seven points clear of Dynamo Kiev in the current championship race. They beat FC Mariupol 3-0 away on Friday in their last match before the domestic league winter break. The players echoed their coach but admitted the Lyon switch is a nuisance for their supporters. ""It didn't create big problems for us (footballers),"" midfielder Taras Stepanenko told AFP. ""This is a big problem for our fans."" ""We hope that the fans will have the opportunity to come... and support the team. It is very important for us."" A win on Wednesday will make the journey all the more worthwhile."

Monaco remain mired in 19th place in the 20-team division. Last weekend Henry eked out his first victory as Monaco manager at Caen, but on Wednesday his side lost away to Atletico Madrid, a defeat that ensured they will finish last in their Champions League group. Against Montpellier, Monaco had a chance to double their lead in the 54th minute when Tielemans, faced with an open goal, passed to Aleksandr Golovin, who hit the bar. After that the visitors took control ""You've got to shoot into the empty net,"" said Henry after the match. Asked if the match was a disaster, Henry answer: ""Yes!"" ""We talk about the fear of losing, but the fear of winning also exists,"" he said. ""We gave a good performance for 54 minutes....but that's not enough."" The victory lifts Montpellier to second. They are 13 points behind Paris Saint-Germain, who round off the weekend's matches in Bordeaux on Sunday evening, but are just one point ahead of Lyon and two clear of Lille. Those two met on Saturday and drew 2-2. In Lille, the home team raced into a two goal lead with goals by Loic Remy, after 17 minutes, and Nicolas Pepe, after 28 minutes. Lyon, who drew by the same score against Manchester City on Tuesday to remain on course for the last 16 of the Champions League, by Bertrand Traore after 63 minutes and Moussa Dembele with four minutes to play. ""There is automatically a feeling of frustration among the players,"" said Christophe Galtier, the Lille coach. ""In the end, I'm happy with this point."" The Lyon president, Jean-Michel Aulas, also said he was happy with a point in the battle to finish second. ""A draw away against a direct opponent for the European places is a good result,"" Aulas said. ""We saw a good match and a very good Olympique Lyonnais (performance)."""

Cornet struck again with nine minutes to play as Lyon looked on course to inflict their second defeat on City this season, but Aguero promptly glanced home at a corner to give the visitors the point they needed to reach the last 16. Lyon must avoid defeat away to Shakhtar Donetsk in their final game to join City in the next round after the Ukrainians won 3-2 at Hoffenheim to keep alive their hopes of progressing from Group F. Nabil Fekir shook off a groin complaint that resurfaced in Friday's win over bitter rivals Saint-Etienne to captain Lyon, who stunned City 2-1 in the opening round of matches in September -- their only loss this season. City coach Pep Guardiola made the trip without Bernardo Silva, Ilkay Gundogan or Gabriel Jesus due to injury, but he elected against handing a rare start to 18-year-old midfielder Phil Foden who was named among the substitutes. Cornet fluffed an early headed chance from a corner, although his miss was considerably less glaring than Memphis Depay's after 13 minutes, when the Dutch forward failed to make sufficient contact from the Ivorian's cross with the goal gaping. Lyon nearly paid the price immediately as City launched an attack of their own that forced Anthony Lopes to plunge down to low to keep out a side-footed effort from Riyad Mahrez. Ferland Mendy earned his first France cap in last week's friendly with Uruguay, and it was a bursting run in behind Kyle Walker from the wing-back that presented Cornet with another magnificent chance. Mendy's cross was met with a heavy touch by Cornet but one that wrong-footed Ederson, only for the forward to lose his footing as he looked destined to fire Lyon ahead, instead skying over the crossbar under pressure from Laporte. Cornet went even closer just before half-time as Depay scampered away down the left flank and hung a deep cross towards the far post that the former volleyed first time, the ball skipping off the turf before smacking against the bar. Mahrez again tested Lopez moments later with a low strike from distance, but Lyon eventually grabbed a deserved breakthrough 10 minutes into the second half. Depay collected a raking crossfield pass deep down the left before floating the ball towards Cornet on the right, where the Ivorian drifted in and hammered an unstoppable left-footed effort into the far corner from 20 yards. Lopes produced a stunning reflex save to claw away a Sergio Aguero header from close range, but City needed just seven minutes to pull level, Laporte nodding in after Raheem Sterling's free-kick was flicked on by David Silva. Lyon then switched off right after the restart to almost gift City the lead, as Leroy Sane's scuffed shot was spilled by Lopes who rolled over to scoop the ball up off the line just in time. The hosts regrouped though and regained the lead on 81 minutes when Depay slid a pass through for Cornet who slipped the ball under an advancing Ederson. But after twice conceding injury-time equalisers against Hoffenheim, Lyon were again unable to hold on as Aguero headed in a Mahrez corner just two minutes later to seal City's place in the knockout draw."
114,26/11/2018,03:15,Laporte set to show France what they are missing in Lyon,"Aymeric Laporte may still be trying to win the confidence of France coach Didier Deschamps, but as Manchester City travel to Laporte's homeland to face Lyon on Tuesday, Pep Guardiola's trust in the centre-back is indisputable.","Signed for a then club record £57 million ($73m) in January, there was skepticism as to whether City needed to splash out once more for a centre-back after investing more than £80 million in John Stones and Nicolas Otamendi and the return to fitness of captain Vincent Kompany. On his arrival from Athletic Bilbao, Laporte took time to settle in his new surroundings with all three of his Champions League outings last season ending in defeat. However, having had a full summer under Guardiola's orders in pre-season as he missed out on Deschamps' World Cup-winning squad, Laporte has become the stalwart of a City defence that has conceded just eight goals in 19 games. In an incredibly deep squad with choices aplenty for Guardiola, the 24-year-old is the only outfield player to have played every single minute of Champions League and Premier League action. ""I can move the squad but when one player plays good, good and good, it gives me confidence so I give you another opportunity. It is not complicated,"" said Guardiola to explain why Laporte has not been rotated. Another is the fact Laporte has continued to be overlooked by France despite his solid start to the season with the likes of Crystal Palace's Mamadou Sakho and veteran Adil Rami retaining Deschamps' faith instead. ""Sooner or later Laporte will be selected for France because it is difficult to find a better left central defender than him in the world,"" insisted Guardiola. ""But of course it is good for the team for some of our players that are not selected for their countries to get rest."" Three international breaks in the past three months have given Laporte the rest and recovery time he needs while many of his team-mates have been putting tired bodies on the line after the World Cup in the Nations League. ""Laporte didn't have the World Cup, was fresh and arrived in top condition and especially he is a left-footed player,"" added Guardiola, highlighting another key attribute the Frenchman has over the likes of Stones, Otamendi and Kompany. ""He helped us to make our build-up and when the ball comes from the right, he immediately controls to the left and plays it to Leroy (Sane) quicker than we would play with a right-footer in that position."" Laporte's ability to build from the back was why he caught Guardiola's eye as a teenager at Athletic when playing against his coach's all-conquering Barcelona side. Only Chelsea's Jorginho, another one-time City target, has completed more passes in the Premier League this season and Laporte also has the third most touches in the league. Another routine 4-0 for the English champions at West Ham on Saturday began with Laporte winning possession inside his own half and not panicking when pressed to find Fernandinho in the build-up to the visitors' opener at the London Stadium. City are out to avenge the only blip in a near-perfect season so far when they last faced Lyon to open their Champions League campaign in September and lost 2-1. A run of 12 wins and a draw at Liverpool in 13 games since has put them back on top in England and within a point of sealing a place in the last 16 of the Champions League. With Laporte an ever-present, France's loss has been City's gain."
115,08/11/2018,16:57,Gourvennec returns as coach of Guingamp,Ligue 1 strugglers Guingamp announced the imminent appointment of Jocelyn Gourvennec as coach following the sacking of Antoine Kombouare earlier this week.,"""Guingamp and Jocelyn Gourvennec have agreed in principle to an agreement that will lead to a new page being written in the history of the club,"" said a statement. Gourvennec, who coached Guingamp from 2010-2016 and steered the Brittany side to a French Cup triumph, is scheduled to take over on what is believed to be a two-year deal on November 12. Guingamp sit bottom of the table on seven points from 12 games ahead of this weekend's clash against Lyon."
116,07/11/2018,23:38,Hoffenheim snatch thrilling draw at Lyon to stay afloat in Champions League,Hoffenheim revived their hopes of reaching the Champions League last 16 as Pavel Kaderabek scored an injury-time equaliser to cap a dramatic comeback with 10 men and snatch a 2-2 draw at Lyon.,"First-half strikes from Nabil Fekir and Tanguy Ndombele put Lyon in control at the Groupama Stadium, and Kasim Nuhu's sending off shortly after the restart left Hoffenheim with a mountain to climb. But Andrej Kramaric gave the Germans hope, and Kaderabek popped up at the back post to stab in a dramatic leveller in the second minute of added time and extend Hoffenheim's debut group-stage campaign. ""We didn't realise that in a football match, nothing is ever finished,"" bemoaned Lyon midfielder Lucas Tousart to RMC Sport. ""These are unacceptable errors to make at this level, when you're looking to qualify... It's so annoying to end up with a draw when we had the game in our hands."" Lyon slip three points behind Group F leaders Manchester City -- who thrashed Shakhtar Donetsk 6-0 at the Etihad Stadium -- as they bid to qualify for the last 16 for the first time since the 2011-2012 season. ""We played a good match anyway, even if we don't leave with victory and we are disappointed,"" said Fekir. ""We must continue with the same state of mind we had before these two goals. There are still two games, nothing is done yet, and it's up to us to learn from this match."" But Julian Nagelsmann's Hoffenheim are now only three points adrift of Lyon in third, and host bottom club Shakhtar at the end of the month. ""At 2-0, Lyon were full of confidence and we had lost all of ours,"" said 31-year-old coach Nagelsmann. ""But, after the red card, for us it was double or quits."" Lyon took the lead in bizarre circumstances as Ferland Mendy's fierce drive against the post precipitated a frantic goalmouth scramble which ended with Fekir prodding in from just a couple of yards out. It was a wide open game, much like the 3-3 draw between the teams in Sinsheim two weeks ago, and home goalkeeper Anthony Lopes made a magnificent save from Nico Schulz to deny the visitors an equaliser. Lyon quickly went up the other end and doubled their advantage as Mendy powered forward again from wing-back and squared for the unmarked Ndombele to slot home with the aid of a big deflection. It was the 21-year-old France midfielder's second goal in as many games against Hoffenheim, having previously only scored once in his Lyon career. Florian Grillitsch's long-range strike was just centimetres from giving Nagelsmann's away side a lifeline in the opening minute of the second half, but Kasim was given his marching orders for a second yellow card in the 51st minute. Lyon missed chances to put the game to bed, though, with Jason Denayer seeing a goal ruled out for offside before Fekir fired straight at Hoffenheim 'keeper Oliver Baumann, and Kramaric set up a tense final quarter of the match with a low 25-yard strike into the bottom corner. Memphis Depay wasted yet another chance to seal Lyon the three points as his low effort was palmed away by Baumann, and Kaderabek met Joelinton's free-kick in the dying seconds to make Lyon pay for their profligacy."
117,02/11/2018,15:22,Fekir back for Lyon ahead of Bordeaux visit,"Lyon captain Nabil Fekir will return for Saturday's French league game at home to Bordeaux following a month out with an ankle injury, coach Bruno Genesio said on Friday.","The France international, who scored a career-best 18 goals in Ligue 1 last season, twisted his ankle during a 5-0 defeat by leaders Paris Saint-Germain on October 7. Fekir resumed full training on Tuesday, although Genesio declined to say whether Fekir would start this weekend with Lyon also due to host Hoffenheim next week in a crucial Champions League tie. ""We'll see. The most important thing is that he's ready to play,"" said Genesio. ""He's our captain and one of our most technical players. How much will he play? The nature of the match will decide that. ""We also have another match on Wednesday and that needs to be taken into account."" Ivorian forward Maxwel Cornet, hurt on international duty last month, is also expected to return."
118,23/10/2018,23:39,Joelinton snatches Hoffenheim thrilling draw with Lyon,Joelinton's stoppage-time equaliser crowned a dramatic Champions League tie on Tuesday night as Hoffenheim twice came from behind to draw 3-3 at home with Lyon and keep their Champions League dream alive.,"Having gone behind early on, Hoffenheim turned the game around to lead 2-1 as they chased their first-ever Champions League win. A string of individual errors saw the tide turn again, before Joelinton's late strike gave the German side faint hope of progressing from the group stage. ""You could say we scored three own goals today because all of them came from individual mistakes,"" Hoffenheim coach Julian Nagelsmann told German broadcaster DAZN. ""Joelinton's goal was important because it means that we can still make something happen with a result in Lyon."" Hoffenheim have only two points from their first three games, while Lyon have five and sit in second place in Group F. Lyon started brightly and could have taken the lead early on, Bertrand Traore slicing the ball wide after a slick one-two with Tanguy Ndombele. Hoffenheim soon began to create chances themselves, and Ishak Belfodil came within inches of an opener on 20 minutes. Yet the hosts were left red-faced when a defensive mix-up gifted Lyon the lead in the 27th minute. Hoffenheim captain Kevin Vogt lost the ball in front of goal after a short goal-kick, and Traore pounced, rounding goalkeeper Oliver Baumann to slot in. Lyon's joy lasted only six minutes, as Hoffenheim rallied and Andrej Kramaric lashed in a loose ball at the far post to level the scores. Hoffenheim then took full control of the game, peppering the Lyon penalty area with crosses and forcing chances for Belfodil and Adam Szalai before half-time. They were rewarded just after the break as Kerem Demirbay's cross picked out Kramaric, who fired in his second of the evening. The game took an unexpected twist just before the hour mark, however, when Ndombele's fierce shot beat Baumann at the near post to give Lyon an equaliser against the run of play. ""We had a lot of bad luck today, we had a lot of chances going forward and conceded three goals in unfortunate circumstances,"" Baumann told DAZN. ""It's a shame, because we fought so hard."" Belfodil missed a golden opportunity to restore the lead five minutes later, and was promptly punished as Memphis Depay burst free of Vogt on the counter-attack, squeezing the ball past Baumann to put Lyon back in front. Vogt had a shot at redemption four minutes from time when he sent a header just past the post, before Joelinton turned in Nico Schulz's cross with 90 seconds to play."
119,16/10/2018,17:53,French fan jailed for firework attack on Lyon goalkeeper,A French judge on Monday handed down a six-month jail term and a six-month suspended sentence to two fans found guilty of throwing fireworks that put Lyon goalkeeper Anthony Lopes in hospital in 2016.,"The first firework thrown from behind the Lyon goal on their visit to Metz knocked Lopez off his feet, while the second one exploded beneath him as he fell on it, leaving him temporarily deafened and with no sense of balance. Players from both teams remonstrated angrily with supporters behind the goal as Lopes was rushed away following the explosion. One 25-year-old man was handed a six-month jail sentence while a 36-year-old was handed a suspended term. Both were members of a Metz ultras supporter group known as 'la Horda Frenetik'. The prosecutor said the pair were guilty of ""an incredibly dangerous disregard for safety"". ""These idiots have sullied the reputation of sport,"" she told the court. The pair originally risked up to three years in jail but still face a civil law suit for damages filed by the club. The match, held on December 16, 2016, was abandoned and Lyon were awarded the win. Metz were docked a further three points for failing to provide a safe environment. Lopes quickly regained fitness but was subsequently attacked on a football pitch a second time, in April 2017, on a visit to Bastia. On that occasion 11 men were arrested and the game was abandoned, although the Corsican club later refused to blame its fans for the incident. The 11 could face up to a year in prison if found guilty of encroaching onto the pitch."
120,07/10/2018,23:09,Four-star Mbappe helps PSG break 82-year-old record,Kylian Mbappe tore Lyon to shreds on Sunday with four goals as a 5-0 thrashing at the Parc des Princes saw Paris Saint-Germain set a new French top-flight record of nine straight wins to start a season.,"Thomas Tuchel's Ligue 1 leaders broke the 82-year-old record of eight consecutive wins set by Olympique Lillois in 1936, having equalled the mark with their 3-0 victory at Nice last weekend. A Neymar penalty gave PSG a ninth-minute advantage, but Presnel Kimpembe was sent off just after the half-hour mark to give Lyon hope. Bruno Genesio's side threw away their man advantage, though, as Lucas Tousart was dismissed, and after missing a string of chances, the sensational Mbappe capped an virtuoso display by scoring four times in 13 minutes to seal history for PSG. The capital-city giants, bidding for a sixth title in seven seasons, are already eight points clear of second-placed Lille at the top of the table, with Lyon five points further back in sixth. Lyon endured the worst possible start to the match, as star man Nabil Fekir was forced off injured in the seventh minute, and the hosts were awarded a spot-kick just seconds later. Mbappe raced to reach a loose ball, and visiting goalkeeper Anthony Lopes needlessly charged off his line to bring down the teenager. Neymar stepped up and sent Lopes the wrong way with a stuttering run-up to score his 11th goal of the season. Lyon responded well, though, with veteran goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon having to shovel a Memphis Depay free-kick over the bar, before Di Maria was fortunate not to concede a penalty for handball. The reigning champions thought they had got lucky again when Kimpembe was only shown a yellow card for a nasty tackle on Tanguy Ndombele, but with the young midfielder lying stricken on the ground, a video review resulted in the centre-back's punishment being upgraded to red. But Lyon shot themselves in the foot on the stroke of half-time as Tousart tripped Mbappe inside the PSG half and was given a second yellow card. OL should have equalised early in the second period, but Maxwel Cornet contrived to miskick with the goal at his mercy. Cornet, who came on for Fekir, almost scored in bizarre circumstances shortly after, as a Silva clearance ricocheted off his back and bounced back off the base of the post. Mbappe almost put PSG out of sight three times in the space of five minutes -- powering clear after Cornet's unwitting effort and drilling against the far post, seeing Lopes dive at his feet as he ran through one-on-one, and shooting too close to the Lyon 'keeper. But the World Cup-winner's persistence finally paid off in the 61st minute as he latched onto the ball inside the area after Neymar had burst forward, turned his man and smashed the ball in off both posts. Confidence was coursing through PSG, and the floodgates opened as centre-back Marquinhos drove into the box and squared for Mbappe to stab in his eighth goal of the campaign. Neymar soon sent the 19-year-old bearing down on goal yet again, and Mbappe lofted the ball into the net to complete an incredible eight-minute hat-trick. He was not done there, though, as he pounced to slam home his fourth with 16 minutes left after Neymar had seen a low shot blocked. Earlier on Sunday, 10-man Monaco slumped to a fifth defeat in nine Ligue 1 matches as former PSG outcast Hatem Ben Arfa earned Rennes a 2-1 victory with his first league goal since April 2016. Leonardo Jardim's Monaco, runners-up to PSG last season, remain winless since the opening weekend and above the automatic relegation spots only on goal difference. Elsewhere, ex-Japan coach Vahid Halilhodzic saw his Nantes side beaten 3-0 at Bordeaux on his return to French football, while Kostas Mitroglou and Florian Thauvin scored as Marseille climbed to third following a 2-0 victory over Caen."
121,02/10/2018,23:40,Lyon fight back to thwart Shakhtar,Lyon battled back from two goals down to earn a spirited 2-2 Champions League Group F draw with Shakhtar Donetsk in a match played behind closed doors on Tuesday.,"Lively Brazilian Junior Moraes scored both Shakhtar goals but Moussa Dembele and Leo Dubois forced a draw in a vastly-improved Lyon second-half performance. The French side were punished by UEFA for crowd trouble during their Europa League tie against CSKA Moscow in March and the game was played to echoing near-empty stands. Perhaps the dead atmosphere weighed on Lyon, who initially looked a shadow of the team that beat Premier League champions Manchester City in their opening group match. Memphis Depay was dropped for Dembele and Lyon failed to fire in the first half as Shakhtar reaped their reward. A minute before half-time, Ismaily's superb low cross fell perfectly for Moraes to squeeze a neat first-time finish past Anthony Lopes. Shakhtar went 2-0 up when Taison began a move, feeding Alan Patrick who found Moraes and the Brazilian curled a sublime finish inside Lopes' post. Lyon showed signs of life when Jason Denayer's header into the turf was parried by Andriy Pyatov and Houssem Aouar tapped in but he was in an offside position. However, Depay's introduction in the second half injected new pace into the home side. Nabil Fekir's cross allowed Dembele to score with a powerful header to give Lyon a fighting chance with 20 minutes remaining. The difference made by Depay's energy was underlined when Lyon pulled level. Depay's cross was parried, but Aouar collected the ball and pulled back a pass that Dubois fired home. Minutes later, Ismaily fired across the goal when he could have restored Shakhtar's lead. And all of Lyon's second-half efforts were almost undone again as substitute Olarenwaju Kayode hit the junction of post and crossbar in the dying moments, but the point means the French side top the group."
122,01/10/2018,19:24,Lyon handicapped by stadium ban in Champions League clash with Shakhtar,Lyon coach Bruno Genesio hopes his side can get the better of Shakhtar Donetsk in the Champions League on Tuesday despite being forced to play the game behind closed doors.,"Supporters will be absent from the 59,000-capacity Groupama Stadium for the Group F encounter after Lyon were told by UEFA they must play one European game behind closed doors as a punishment for trouble during their Europa League tie against CSKA Moscow back in March. They were also handed a suspended ban for a second home game, and it is a major handicap for the French club after they stunned Pep Guardiola's Manchester City last month, winning 2-1 in England. ""With or without fans, we will need to play as well as we did at Manchester City to make the most of our victory there,"" Genesio told reporters on Monday. With a reference to some of the home games during Lyon's run to the Europa League semi-finals in 2016-17, Genesio added: ""We know that it is very important to have our fans behind us in these games. ""We have had quite extraordinary European atmospheres here against Besiktas and Roma which strengthened us greatly. We will just have to do without on Tuesday. ""It is regrettable for everybody. A football match should be played in front a crowd and that is why we all love the big games. ""We have to accept the punishment and find the motivation even if the atmosphere will be a bit strange. ""We had a lot of praise after the win in Manchester but I can confirm that Shakhtar are a very good side as well."" The Ukrainian champions began their campaign with a 2-2 draw at home to Hoffenheim, and a victory for Lyon on Tuesday would put them in a very strong position. The last time Lyon played behind closed doors was in April last year, when they won 3-0 away to Metz in Ligue 1. There will still be around one thousand people at the Groupama Stadium on Tuesday, including 300 representatives of UEFA, 200 guests of Shakhtar and 130 accredited journalists."
123,26/09/2018,23:14,Record-setting PSG make it seven wins in seven,Paris Saint-Germain set a new club record on Wednesday when a 4-1 victory over Reims gave them a seventh win from seven games this season and an eight-point lead in Ligue 1.,"With a perfect 21 points, new coach Thomas Tuchel surpassed the previous best start of 19 points by predecessor Unai Emery last season. The champions can now claim another slice of history on Saturday where a victory over Nice will allow PSG to equal Lille's all-time record of eight wins at the start of a season set back in 1936-1937. Missing the injured Lassana Diarra and suspended Kylian Mbappe, PSG surprisingly fell behind to Reims after just two minutes on Wednesday when Xavier Chavalerin stunned the Parc des Princes. But Edinson Cavani levelled after five minutes and then won the 24th-minute penalty which was converted by Neymar. Uruguay striker Cavani hit the third before half-time to take his season's goal tally to five, the same as Neymar. Thomas Meunier tucked away the fourth in the 55th minute after being set up by young striker Moussa Diaby much to the delight of watching US basketball legend Michael Jordan in town for this week's Ryder Cup. Moussa Dembele scored his first two goals for Lyon in two minutes in Dijon to set his team on course for an 3-0 victory that lifted them into second in Ligue 1. The 22-year old striker, who joined from Celtic on August 31, scored the opener after 17 minutes with a first-time chip over the goalkeeper and two minutes later added a second, acrobatically putting home a rebound. Martin Terrier headed a third in the 35th minute. On a night when six early matches produced six red cards, Lyon played the last 34 minutes with 10 men after Lucas Tousart received a second yellow card. Dijon's Enzo Loiodice followed in the final minute. Lyon are on 13 points from seven games, eight behind PSG. Lille, who started the evening in second, lost 1-0 at Bordeaux. Francois Kamano put the home team ahead after just seven minutes. Lille played the last few minutes with 10 men after Adama Soumaoro received a second yellow card. The other two teams who could have climbed to second, Marseille and Montpellier played games that followed similar patterns until the dying seconds. Montpellier fell behind at Caen to a goal by Saif-Eddine Khaoui after 10 minutes. Andy Delort and Damien Le Tallec resplied and put the visitors ahead and, briefly, second in the league. But Yacine Bammou leveled after 64 minutes. Seven minutes from time, Montpellier's Vitorino Hilton was sent off for a wild sliding tackle. Caen created dangerous chances, but Montpellier held on to draw 2-2. In Marseille, Kenny Lala broke away and put Strasboug ahead after 27 minutes. The home team replied twice just before half time. After Florian Thauvin was sent flying in the 41st minute, Dimitri Payet coolly converted the penalty. Then Morgan Sanson curled a shot inside the post to put Marseille ahead on the stroke of half time. After Jordan Amavi received a straight red in the 52nd minute the 10 men of Marseille held out until the 89th minute when Nuno Da Costa leveled for the visitors. Marseille responded with one last attack, and Valerie Germain met a low cross with a ferocious shot to secure a 3-2 win."
124,21/09/2018,21:42,Lyon appeal after UEFA upholds Champions League stadium ban,"Lyon reacted to a UEFA ruling on Friday that they must play their next Champions League match behind closed doors by saying they would appeal again, this time to the Court of Arbitration for Sport.","The punishment was originally handed down in August following scenes of mob violence ahead of a Europa League home game against CSKA Moscow in March. Lyon appealed to UEFA in August, but on Friday the governing body of European football announced that they had upheld the punishment, which also includes a second match behind closed doors if there is further trouble and a 100,000 euro ($117,000) fine. Lyon said it would carry on the fight through CAS. ""The club regrets that UEFA did not take into account that the events occurred outside the stadium and that in France clubs are not allowed to intervene in public spaces which are under the responsibility of the civil authorities,"" the club said in a statement. Lyon lead Champions League Group F after opening their campaign with a surprise victory at Manchester City on Wednesday. Next, they face Shakhtar Donetsk at Parc OL stadium on October 2. The punishment stems from a Europa League game in March. Before the game, a group of 100 hooded black-clad fans pelted police. Lyon then lost the match and were eliminated from the competition. One man was later sentenced to 18 months in jail and others receive suspended sentences. The club said in their statement ""that following the match against CSKA Moscow, nine individuals involved in the incidents were sentenced thanks to the sophisticated surveillance system"" at the stadium. The club added that they were cooperating with police in Manchester after a Lyon fan was caught on film giving a Nazi salute at the Etihad Stadium. ""OL has decided to acknowledge events at the Etihad Stadium to ban for life the individual concerned and to file a criminal complaint against him,"" concluded their statement."
125,20/09/2018,15:52,"Lyon fly flag for France as PSG, Monaco disappoint in Europe","If only one French club was going to emerge victorious in the Champions League this week, probably very few thought that team would be Lyon, for all that they possess in their ranks a World Cup winner in Nabil Fekir.","France's Champions League trio all had extremely difficult assignments, with Lyon recording a stunning 2-1 win on Wednesday away to Pep Guardiola's Manchester City. That contrasted with Paris Saint-Germain's 3-2 defeat in Liverpool a day earlier, while Monaco's limits were exposed as they went down 2-1 at home to Atletico Madrid. Lyon's win was their best result in Europe since they reached the Champions League semi-finals in 2010, and came with the pressure growing on coach Bruno Genesio. Their start to the Ligue 1 season has been poor, and they are already eight points behind leaders PSG after five games. But against City, with 10 players aged 24 or under featuring in Genesio's side, Lyon demonstrated what they are capable of. Their goals came from Maxwel Cornet and captain Fekir, who shows no sign of being troubled by the knee issue that saw Liverpool pull out of a move for him in the summer. ""Nabil showed that our captain is back, well and truly back. He was decisive and was also exemplary when we didn't have the ball. I am very proud of my players,"" said Genesio. He has been in charge for two and a half years but is not popular with all supporters -- disgruntled fans have draped the Groupama stadium with banners targeting Genesio, who has also been accosted by fans while walking in the streets of the city. However, he and his team are now galvanised ahead of another huge match, when they host bitter rivals Marseille in the league. ""We need to be able to put together a run of these performances, and we will need a repeat on Sunday against a team who are of Champions League standard,"" Genesio added. Meanwhile, the inquest into PSG's defeat against Liverpool has focused largely on their problems in midfield. The defeat in itself was no disgrace, and the result may not ultimately matter, but the manner of the performance from Thomas Tuchel's side was a cause for concern. After five straight wins in Ligue 1, they were unable to deal with the step up against last season's Champions League finalists. Their star attacking trio of Neymar, Kylian Mbappe and Edinson Cavani did not perform, while they were overrun in midfield. Tuchel has publicly expressed frustration at the club's failure to sign a new holding midfielder after Thiago Motta's retirement. And while Marco Verratti was suspended at Anfield, Brazil defender Marquinhos played the holding role. ""We were maybe a bit too prudent at the end of the game, but there was also quite a lot of tiredness,"" said Thomas Meunier, and his team could have done with a player capable of holding possession. Instead, they struggled to cope with Liverpool's intensity, and they visit Rennes on Sunday stung by a fourth successive defeat in a Champions League game. Rather less was expected of Monaco. Coach Leonardo Jardim insists his side can qualify for the last 16, but they missed absentees like Rony Lopes, Aleksandr Golovin, Pietro Pellegri and Stevan Jovetic in midweek. ""Experience made the difference. I didn't think there was much between the teams,"" said Jardim, who has very few survivors from the team that reached the Champions League semi-finals in 2017. Monaco host Nimes on Friday and are in the bottom six in Ligue 1 having not won since the opening weekend. Fixtures (kick-offs GMT)"
126,19/09/2018,23:03,Lyon stun favourites Man City in Champions League opener,Pep Guardiola had to watch on in horror from the stands as Manchester City's Champions League campaign got off to the worst possible start in a 2-1 home defeat by Lyon on Wednesday.,"Guardiola was serving a touchline ban for being sent-off in last season's quarter-final exit to Liverpool and the competition favourites failed to live up to their billing. Maxwel Cornet and Nabil Fekir fired Lyon into a 2-0 half-time lead and despite Bernardo Silva pulling a goal back, City slumped to their first defeat of the season. A decade into their stewardship, winning the Champions League for the first time may remain the holy grail for City's Abu Dhabi owners. But it seems City's fans still need to be convinced with plenty of empty seats dotted around the Etihad and the Champions League anthem again booed before kick-off. That flat atmosphere transferred into City's first-half display as Guardiola could only sit and watch a performance riddled with uncharacteristic basic errors from the Premier League champions. Lyon have won just two of their opening five Ligue 1 matches of the season, but pounced on City's sloppiness. Cornet thought he had opened the scoring when he rounded Ederson and slotted into an empty net only to be marginally flagged offside midway through the first half. Moments later there was no flag to rescue City from some calamitous defending. Fekir's low cross should have been easily cut out by Fabian Delph at the back post. However, the England international swiped at fresh air and Cornet gratefully slotted into the far corner. Conceding at least sparked City into life and they also had the ball in the net only to be called back for offside when Raheem Sterling's cross was converted by Ilkay Gundogan, before Gabriel Jesus had claims for a penalty waived away. Guardiola's ban meant he wasn't even allowed into the dressing room at half-time, and Arteta's team talk got an awfully lot tougher two minutes before the break when long-time Liverpool target Fekir drilled a shot from 25 yards into the bottom corner. Arteta surprisingly resisted the temptation to make changes at the break despite having a cavalry of Leroy Sane, Sergio Aguero and Riyad Mahrez on the bench. Anthony Lopes made a smart stop low to his right to deny Jesus, but it wasn't until Sane and Aguero were summoned before the hour mark that City started to threaten. By that point, it should have been too late as former Manchester United winger Memphis Depay hit the post with just Ederson to beat on another threatening Lyon counter-attack. Sane's introduction moved Bernardo Silva into the central role where he has shone in recent weeks in the absence of Kevin De Bruyne and the two combined to get the hosts back into the game 23 minutes from time. The German got to the by-line and his cut-back was swept into the far corner by the Portuguese international. Sane scored on his first start of the season against Fulham on Saturday and seemed determined to ride to City's rescue as a fleet-footed run set up a low effort from Aguero that Lopes did well to stop. Aguero and Sane fired off target when well-placed in stoppage time, but Lyon held out to leave City with plenty of work to do in Group F to progress."

The 22-year-old walked off the field after about 15 minutes following a discussion with Rodgers, just 24 hours after sitting out Thursday's Europa League win over Suduva following negotiations between the clubs. Aware that they were in danger of being stuck with an unhappy player as the Scottish transfer window drew to a close, Celtic finally decided to accept Lyon's reported £18 million offer late on Friday. ""Every decision we make at Celtic will always be in the best interests of the Club and our supporters,"" Rodgers said in a statement on Celtic's website. ""It is vital to make clear that we have never promised any player that he can leave the Club at a particular time. It has never happened. ""In fact, we have said all along that we did not wish to sell Moussa, given the circumstances within the transfer window and that is why we rejected a significant offer yesterday. ""However, this particular decision to accept this offer has been taken in order to serve the best interests of the first-team squad, my coaching team and the culture and environment we have created in these last two seasons. ""The Board and myself are united and they have been very supportive to me on this issue. ""Finally, I would like to thank Moussa for his contribution in our last two seasons and want to wish him well in his new adventure at Lyon."" Celtic, who have failed to qualify for this season's Champions League group stage, will start life without Dembele on Sunday when they face arch rivals Rangers in the first Old Firm derby of the season."

The home side took the lead shortly before half-time as full-back Ferland Mendy slipped through an inch-perfect pass for Terrier, who spent last season on loan at Strasbourg, to curl into the bottom corner. Former Chelsea forward Traore wrapped up the win in style with a fantastic individual goal in the 64th minute, latching onto Memphis Depay's ball before dribbling past visiting goalkeeper Matz Sels and a backtracking defender to slot in. Fekir missed the first two games of the season after returning late from the World Cup, where he made six substitute appearances in France's triumphant campaign. Lyon, who finished third last season to qualify for the Champions League group stage, have now won their last eight home Ligue 1 matches.

The 23-year-old joined City's academy as a youth but never established himself in their first team, and has spent the last four years being loaned out to various clubs. After stints at Celtic and Sunderland, Denayer played for Galatasaray last season, helping them win the Turkish title. The arrival of Denayer, who has played eight times for Belgium but did not go to the World Cup in Russia, comes after a summer in which Lyon have been linked with moves for several defensive reinforcements. Among those linked with the seven-time French champions was Colombian centre-back Yerry Mina, who eventually joined Everton from Barcelona."

Fekir, who came on as a substitute in France's 4-2 win against Croatia in last month's World Cup final, was not included in the Lyon squad having only returned to training on Monday. He scored a career-best 18 goals in Ligue 1 last season and appeared to be on the verge of a move to Liverpool in June before negotiations with the Premier League club broke down. Bruno Genesio's side coped without their captain at the Groupama Stadium as Dutch star Depay made the points safe with a terrific 20-yard free-kick on 75 minutes. ""I'm happy to be in form. I've never enjoyed being on the pitch as much even at Manchester United or PSV,"" said Depay, who has played a part in 18 goals in his last 10 league games for Lyon. ""I'm the happiest right now and not just in football but also in my private life. I hope that's going to continue.""

""As you can see, I'm in Lyon. I'm very happy here,"" Fekir said in an interview on the club's website as he returned to training on Monday. ""But there is a still a long way to go in the transfer window and everything happens very quickly in football."" Chelsea are reportedly also interested in Fekir as Maurizio Sarri attempts to bolster his side before the Premier League transfer deadline on Thursday. ""You don't know what will happen in the future but I'm very comfortable at Lyon. I feel really good within the squad,"" said Fekir. ""We have very good players and there's a good atmosphere. It's a bit like in the France team, there's a mix of older players and younger ones, with some more experienced players than others."" Lyon are back in the Champions League this season after missing out last term, and Fekir is targeting a much more successful campaign than their group stage exit in 2016-17. ""It was important to play in it. We're lucky to be able to play in this magnificent competition. I hope we will have a very good run and aim for as high as possible."""

""I think this club's a very big club. I'm very happy to be here,"" Griffiths told Lyon's in-house TV channel. ""I know a lot about the club, the players coming through, (Karim) Benzema and (Alexandre) Lacazette."" Griffiths was part of the England squad that lost last year's European Under-17 Championship final to Spain on penalties. Jadon Sancho, voted the best player at that tournament, moved to Borussia Dortmund from Manchester City last summer for around eight million euros. Keanen Bennetts, 19, also left Spurs for Borussia Moenchengladbach at the end of last season, as a growing number of English youngsters have started to look abroad in a search for first-team football."
136,24/07/2018,18:26,"Difficult for Fekir to find a better club, says Lyon president","Lyon president Jean-Michel Aulas said on Tuesday that it would be ""difficult"" for his club captain Nabil Fekir to find a better side, despite the persistent rumours over the midfielder's future.","The 25-year-old came close to a move to Champions League runners-up Liverpool before the World Cup, but negotiations between the two clubs ended on June 9, with Lyon announcing he would stay in France. Fekir made six substitute appearances, including in the final victory over Croatia on July 15, as France won the World Cup in Russia. ""In the current context, as a world champion and with a Lyon team with the ambition to do something very good next year, it's difficult for Nabil to find a much better club,"" Aulas claimed in a press conference. Centre-back Marcelo has also been heavily linked with a move to the Premier League, and Aulas admitted he faces a struggle to keep both the Brazilian and Fekir before the English transfer window closes. ""I don't fear anything,"" he insisted. ""If they leave it will be that we've found our amount, but we will do everything so that they don't leave. ""We will surely have a bit of a storm in the week before the end of the English market on August 9."" Lyon will return to the Champions League group stage after a one-year absence this season. Fekir scored 18 goals in Ligue 1 last term as Lyon finished third behind champions Paris Saint-Germain and Monaco."
137,09/06/2018,21:50,Lyon cancel dealings with Liverpool over Fekir transfer,Lyon ended negotiations with Liverpool on Saturday over the possible transfer of forward Nabil Fekir to the Premier League club.,"""Nabil Fekir is staying at Lyon... pending other propositions,"" said Lyon in a statement, just hours after the president of the French football federation (FFF) claimed Fekir had undergone a Liverpool medical. ""The three-way negotiations with Liverpool and Nabil Fekir for the transfer of the Lyon captain have not succeeded and Lyon have decided to end these negotiations tonight (Saturday) at 8pm,"" added the Ligue 1 club in their statement. The latest development in the on-off transfer saga came after FFF chief Noel Le Graet had earlier said: ""Nabil Fekir is in the process of being transferred."" That came just a day after Lyon branded reports of the pending deal as ""fake news"". British and French media have been reporting for several days that the 24-year-old, who is part of France's World Cup squad, was on the verge of joining Liverpool for 60-70 million euros ($71-82 million). But on Friday, Lyon released a statement ""categorically"" denying the reports. ""The transfer has not been done and even less so at this price,"" Jean-Michel Aulas, the Lyon chairman said in a message to l'AFP. Such a sum would top the record 53 million euros Lyon received for Alexandre Lacazette's switch to Arsenal a year ago. Le Graet, speaking in Lyon a few hours before France played the United States in a World Cup warm up game in the city, said: ""These are negotiations. They can sometimes drag along. ""Every time a player is on the market, there's a price; the buyer tries to lower the price, the seller tries to increase it -- it takes time. ""And even if he did not leave, he won't be devastated,"" Le Graet said at the opening of an indoor football complex in Lyon. ""He's a lad who loves football and likes Lyon, but for the moment, quite frankly he is only talking about the France team."""
138,08/06/2018,11:28,"Lyon calls ""fake news"" on Fekir move to Liverpool","French club Lyon denounced ""fake news"" Friday amid reports that captain Nabil Fekir's signature for Liverpool in a £53 million ($71 million, 60 million euro) deal was imminent.","""In this period of transfers when the slightest rumour is often presented as reality, Lyon would like to underline that only information released on the club's website is reliable,"" the club said in a statement. Lyon categorically denied as ""fake new"" media reports suggesting that a transfer would take place within hours which would bring 24-year-old Fekir to Anfield once he has finished duty for France at the World Cup in Russia. Lyon chairman Jean-Michel Aulas told AFP in a statement that ""no deal has been done, and certainly not at the price"" of 70 million euro ($82 million) given by the French sports newspaper L'Equipe. Fekir, who can play in both midfield or attack, is wanted by Liverpool to fill the creative void left by the January departure of Philippe Coutinho to Barcelona. The Merseysiders were reported to be keen to close the deal before Fekir jets off to Russia following France's final warm-up friendly against the United States in Lyon on Saturday. Fekir scored 24 goals this season to help qualify Lyon for the Champions League by finishing third in Ligue 1."

""We are prefectly serene. ""We try always to go in the same direction as the players. We listen to them carefully,"" Aulas said. ""We will certainly know more after the World Cup. But for now, he's a Lyon player."" Fekir is a 24-year-old Lyon-born forward who came through the club's youth system and is part of the France squad for the upcoming World Cup and for the warm-up game against Ireland on Monday night. ""We are hugely proud that a natural talent we developed is in the national squad and I will be at the match tonight when he will play for France,"" said Aulas. ""If Nabil wishes to play in the Champions League at our Groupama Stadium next season, we will be delighted."" This season, Fekir scored 23 goals and had seven assists in 43 matches in all competitions and helped Lyon finish third in the French league. He has 10 France caps and one international goal."
140,20/05/2018,12:06,Depay treble sees Lyon beat Nice and pip Marseille to Champions League spot,Memphis Depay struck a wonderful hat-trick as Lyon fought back to beat Nice 3-2 at the Groupama Stadium on Saturday to qualify for the Champions League from Ligue 1 at the expense of Marseille.,"Monaco saw off relegated Troyes 3-0 to wrap up second spot behind champions Paris Saint-Germain, as Bruno Genesio's Lyon finished one point clear of Marseille in third after a dramatic final day of the season. It capped a miserable week for beaten Europa League finalists Marseille, who will have to make do with a return to Europe's second-tier competition despite beating Amiens 2-1. Nice missed out on the Europa League with Saturday's defeat, and coach Lucien Favre announced he was leaving the club after the game. Marseille's defeat by Atletico Madrid on Wednesday in Lyon had ensured that the third-placed finishers in Ligue 1 would join the top two in the group stage of Europe's premier competition, rather than face the qualifying rounds. ""The group this year has done very well, it is a fair reward to finish third,"" Lyon captain Nabil Fekir told French television, before refusing to commit his future to the club. ""I don't know, frankly. I gave everything at Lyon, we'll see for the future. It hasn't been perfect this season, but it's a good finish."" Lyon were the first of the three sides in contention to slip up, as Alassane Plea raced clean through on goal and fired through the legs of home goalkeeper Anthony Lopes to put Nice ahead. OL desperately needed a quick leveller after half-time and Depay provided just that. Fekir did excellently to twist into space and square for Depay to tap home. Depay has arguably been the best player in France during the latter stages of the season, and the Dutchman produced the moment of magic needed to send Lyon into the Champions League. The former Manchester United flop showed magnificent creativity and execution to roll a free-kick under the wall and into the bottom corner to score his 18th goal of the campaign and his ninth in as many games. Depay completed a sublime treble late on by dinking the ball over away goalkeeper Walter Benitez, and although Plea fired home from long range in the 89th minute, Lyon held on as Nice missed on a Europa League spot. Marseille struck first in the race for the Champions League against Amiens at the Stade Velodrome, as teenager Boubacar Kamara's clever pass picked out Morgan Sanson who slammed a fierce shot into the roof of the net to give Rudi Garcia's men an 11th-minute lead against Troyes. Just seconds after Lyon fell behind at the Groupama Stadium, things got even better for Garcia's team as Kostas Mitroglou reacted quickest after Lucas Ocampos' header was saved to stab in the ninth goal of his first Ligue 1 season. But Amiens hit back to give Lyon a boost, as Moussa Konate took advantage of some terrible home defending to halve the deficit before half-time. Visiting midfielder Thomas Monconduit was rightly sent off for a horrendous challenge as he slammed his studs into the planted leg of Ocampos, who was lucky not to escape serious injury, early in the second half. Marseille saw out the win, but the three points provided little joy as results elsewhere meant they wasted two chances to return to Europe's top table in just four days. ""Everyone started screaming in the stands and we thought it was 3-3 in Lyon,"" said Marseille star forward Florian Thauvin. ""We've had a good season, but haven't been rewarded."" Monaco knew that they would be assured of a Champions League place if they avoided defeat and a double from Rony Lopes and Jordi Mboula's late strike saw them relegate Troyes with a comfortable win. That result sent Troyes down to the second tier with already-relegated Metz, as Toulouse secured a playoff with a 2-1 victory over Guingamp. Elsewhere, Caen held champions Paris Saint-Germain to a goalless draw to secure safety, while Bordeaux thrashed Metz 4-0 to join Marseille and Rennes in the Europa League."
141,05/05/2018,02:10,Five things to watch out for in Ligue 1 this weekend,"Fresh from becoming the first French side to reach a European final since 2004 with their Europa League victory over Salzburg, Marseille turn their attentions back to the fight for a top-three spot in Ligue 1 this weekend.","Rudi Garcia's men are locked in a fight with Lyon and Monaco for the two Champions League spots behind champions Paris Saint-Germain, with just two points separating the three clubs. Here are five things to watch out for in Ligue 1 this weekend: Monaco will have to make do without injured captain Radamel Falcao as they bid to end a three-match winless streak which has dragged them into the battle for the top three. Falcao will sit out Sunday's visit to Caen with a thigh injury, while Leonardo Jardim is also missing Keita Balde, Stevan Jovetic and Adama Diakhaby. Those injury woes could mean a full debut for 18-year-old Moussa Sylla in one of Monaco's biggest games of the season after a dreadful run which was kicked off by the calamitous 7-1 thrashing by PSG. The player to watch in Ligue 1 at the moment is undoubtedly Lyon's Memphis Depay. The Dutch forward had an up-and-down start to the season but has exploded into life since scoring a dramatic late winner against Marseille in March. The 24-year-old, who struggled after a big-money move to Manchester United three years ago, has now scored seven goals and assisted six in his last six league matches. A goal against relegation-threatened Troyes on Sunday would take him to 20 in all competitions for the season for the first time since his last campaign at PSV Eindhoven in 2014/15. Garcia's revolution is well underway at Marseille, with the former European champions on the brink of a return to the continent's premier competition. Victory in the Europa League final over Atletico Madrid in Lyon on May 16 would secure a Champions League spot for next season, but Monaco's recent slump has also boosted their chances of qualifying through Ligue 1. Marseille have not played in the Champions League since losing all six of their group-stage matches in 2013, but Rolando's extra-time strike in Salzburg on Thursday kept them fighting on two fronts, and they host Nice in the pick of the weekend's matches on Sunday. Like Marseille, Lille went into this season expecting a revival after an influx of new players under Marcelo Bielsa, but instead face the ingnominy of dropping out of the top flight for the first time since being promoted in 2000. Argentinian Bielsa has been locked in a bitter legal battle with the club since being sacked last December, while the team has never managed to get out of trouble. Christophe Galtier's side head to fellow strugglers Toulouse knowing that defeat would leave their fate out of their own hands. Lille sit second-bottom in the table, two points adrift of 17th-placed Toulouse and behind Troyes, who occupy the relegation play-off place, on goal difference. In February Saint-Etienne were fighting to avoid the drop, but head into their clash with Bordeaux in fifth place and leading Nice and Rennes by one point in the race for the Europa League. They are unbeaten in 13 league matches, having won just once in their previous 13 outings.

142,20/04/2018,23:13,Five-star Lyon take another step towards Champions League return,Captain Nabil Fekir scored a superb goal as Lyon stayed on course for a return to the Champions League by romping to a 5-2 win at Dijon in Ligue 1 on Friday.,"Memphis Depay, Houssem Aouar, Bertrand Traore and Maxwel Cornet were also on target for the visitors in Burgundy, as a rampant Lyon claimed a sixth consecutive league victory. Bruno Genesio's side -- who missed out on a Champions League place this season -- are now just a point behind second-placed Monaco, who visit Guingamp on Saturday. Crucially, they are also three points ahead of fourth-placed Marseille, who entertain Lille in another Saturday game. Only the top three sides qualify for the Champions League in Ligue 1, and OL looked to be out of the running after a poor run of form in February and into March. However, they have come roaring back on a winning run that has included a dramatic away victory at Marseille and has seen them score 19 goals while taking 18 points from a possible 18. This was the fifth away game this season in which they have scored five times, with Depay setting them on the way when he turned in a cross from fellow former Manchester United man Rafael early on. The Dutchman has now scored 15 Ligue 1 goals this season, with six coming in his last five games. A terrific Naim Sliti strike meant the scores were level at the interval, but Depay helped on another Rafael cross for Aouar to put Lyon ahead again five minutes after the break. French international Fekir, making his first start since returning from a knee injury, then dribbled into the penalty area before finishing neatly into the roof of the net at the end of a counterattack to make it 3-1 in the 53rd minute. Dijon still made a fight of it, with Sliti scoring again to reduce the deficit before the hosts were left furious when Wesley Said went down under a Rafael challenge in the box but no penalty was given. However, substitute Cornet came on to set up former Chelsea forward Traore to side-foot in Lyon's fourth, and Cornet himself completed the scoring with seven minutes left. Elsewhere on Friday, Rennes came from behind to draw 1-1 at derby rivals Nantes in a meeting of two sides fighting for Europa League qualification. Adrien Thomasson put Claudio Ranieri's Nantes in front before the break, but they then had Emiliano Sala sent off just after the restart, and James Lea-Siliki got Rennes' leveller. Rennes are fifth, in a Europa League qualifying slot, while Nantes are two points behind in eighth. Reims secured promotion back to Ligue 1 after a two-year absence, with the former European Cup finalists beating Ajaccio 1-0 to clinch the Ligue 2 title. After winning a fifth Ligue 1 title in six seasons last weekend, champions Paris Saint-Germain are at Bordeaux on Sunday."
143,14/04/2018,19:19,Depay helps Lyon maintain Champions League assault,Memphis Depay grabbed a goal and an assist as Lyon secured a fifth straight Ligue 1 win by beating Amiens 3-0 on Saturday to continue their push for a place in next season's Champions League.,"Dutch international Depay, who had a hand in all five goals against Metz last weekend, set up Mariano Diaz for the opening goal against Amiens on 30 minutes. The former Manchester United player gathered a pass from Bertrand Traore and rolled the ball across to Mariano, who shifted back onto his right foot before finishing inside the near post for his 18th league goal of the season. Depay nearly doubled the lead on the stroke of half-time when Amiens goalkeeper Regis Gurtner made a sharp save at his near post to keep out the forward's header. Substitute Stiven Mendoza came closest to an equaliser for Amiens midway through the second half when his downward header was smothered on the line by Anthony Lopes. Lyon captain Nabil Fekir returned after seven weeks out through injury for the final 15 minutes as the hosts eventually wrapped up the three points. Gurtner and Prince-Desir Gouano combined to frustrate Traore and then Depay in a matter of seconds, but the latter gave Lyon room to breathe when he volleyed in a cross from the Burkina Faso striker on 83 minutes. Traore himself got on the scoresheet two minutes later, following up after Fekir's effort was blocked to seal a victory that moved Lyon three points clear of fourth-placed Marseille. Rudi Garcia's Marseille, who advanced to the semi-finals of the Europa League on Thursday with a thrilling 5-3 aggregate defeat of RB Leipzig, are back in domestic action away to Troyes on Sunday. Paris Saint-Germain will reclaim the French title if they beat reigning champions Monaco at the Parc des Princes in Sunday's late game."
144,08/04/2018,19:38,Depay stars again as Lyon boost Champions League bid,Memphis Depay continued his hot streak of form as Lyon won 5-0 at Metz on Sunday to climb above Marseille as the two sides fight it out for Champions League qualification in France.,"The Dutchman scored one goal and set up the other four, with Lyon claiming a fourth consecutive win to move into third place in Ligue 1 above Marseille, who could only draw 0-0 with Montpellier in the late game. Well adrift of champions-elect Paris Saint-Germain and second-placed Monaco, goal difference is all that separates the sides with six games of the season remaining. Lyon were 2-0 up at half-time against Ligue 1's bottom club, with Depay twice sending in corners for Brazilian defender Marcelo to score. The former Manchester United man got his name on the scoresheet in the 65th minute and then teed up Bertrand Traore and Mariano Diaz for further goals as Lyon won 5-0 on their travels for the fourth time this season. Depay has now scored 13 league goals this season, with four coming in his last three games. ""He seems happy on the pitch and full of confidence. When you have talent like he has, and that much confidence, you get performances like his last two,"" said Lyon coach Bruno Genesio of the 24-year-old. ""But I also think that his position, with more freedom and fewer defensive tasks, really helps him in that regard."" With only the top three qualifying for Europe's elite club competition from France, it has come down to a straight fight between Lyon and Marseille to see who will join PSG and Monaco. Former European champions Marseille were five points ahead of OL before hosting their rivals last month. Depay's late goal gave Lyon a 3-2 win that night and now the Dutchman's side have the advantage on goal difference. Missing several key players, including top scorer Florian Thauvin, Marseille were not at their best against Montpellier, with tiredness also an issue after their 1-0 defeat at RB Leipzig in their Europa League quarter-final, first leg on Thursday. Injured defender Adil Rami was another of those missing, and he watched from the stands with his girlfriend, Canadian-American actor and model Pamela Anderson. They saw Morgan Sanson come closest to scoring for Marseille, with a shot against the post in the second half. PSG are 14 points clear at the top of the table from Monaco and will have the chance to clinch the title when they host last season's champions next weekend. The capital side drew 1-1 at Saint-Etienne on Friday while Radamel Falcao and Rony Lopes scored as Monaco beat Nantes 2-1 on Saturday. The principality club, unbeaten in 17 in the league, are seven points ahead of Lyon and Marseille."
145,19/03/2018,18:52,Lyon facing possible European ban after UEFA charges,Lyon could be banned from all European competition after UEFA on Monday charged the French club over incidents at last week's Europa League match against CSKA Moscow.,"UEFA said the charges centre on racist behaviour and crowd disturbances. The club already have a suspended two-year ban hanging over them from incidents at a previous Europa League game with Turkish side Besiktas in April 2017. Last Thursday's trouble started outside Parc OL, which will host the Europa League final in May, before the last-16 second leg against CSKA. Police said that at least eight officers were hurt as 100-150 hooded fans attacked an anti-terrorist unit. Problems continued inside the stadium and UEFA's Control, Ethics and Disciplinary Body has charged Lyon over the throwing of objects and the setting off of fireworks, crowd disturbances, racist behaviour and blocking stairways. Lyon police said there were three arrests. French sports daily L'Equipe quoted a source within UEFA as saying that the racism charge relates to Nazi symbols displayed inside the stadium, Nazi salutes and an attack on a non-white spectator. CSKA won 3-2 on the night to progress to the quarter-finals on away goals, where they meet English club Arsenal. The case will be decided on May 31. Under UEFA guidelines, the two-year suspended sentence will be automatically enforced if Lyon are found guilty. Last April, at the quarter-final against Besiktas in Lyon, there were confrontations between the two sets of fans outside the stadium, fighting in the stands and a pitch invasion by dozens of Lyon supporters which forced the kick-off to be delayed by 45 minutes. The latest incidents raise questions about security at the Europa League final on May 16, although Parc OL, built for Euro 2016, has already hosted several major matches with no notable incidents. Marseille have also been charged by UEFA over ""crowd disturbances"" and ""use of fireworks"" in their home victory over Athletic Bilbao."
146,19/03/2018,15:58,Depay grabs Lyon dramatic win over top-three rivals Marseille,Memphis Depay's last-gasp winner clinched Lyon a thrilling 3-2 victory at Marseille on Sunday that kept them firmly in the hunt for Champions League qualification.,"Kostas Mitroglou looked to have snatched Marseille a vital point with an 84th-minute equaliser to make it 2-2, but Depay showed great bravery to nod home in the final minute of normal time. Bruno Genesio's Lyon are now just two points adrift of their opponents in the race for the third and final Champions League spot, after following a six-game winless run with back-to-back victories. Marseille had forged ahead in the 31st minute through Portuguese defender Rolando, but Lyon levelled as Adil Rami put through his own net before Houssem Aouar scored early in the second period. Both sides clashed after the final whistle, with fights also breaking out in the tunnel as Marseille frustrations boiled over. ""Over the whole game, it was deserved, we had more chances and we controlled the game,"" said Lyon coach Genesio. ""We're back to two points and it's very possible to catch them, but we need to repeat the performances we put in against the big teams against the so-called weaker teams."" Both teams looked dangerous going forward early on, with Lyon forward Mariano Diaz seeing an effort spin narrowly wide of the far post, before visiting goalkeeper denied Dimitri Payet with a sprawling save. Marseille dominated possession, but Lyon always looked a threat on the counter-attack and Steve Mandanda had to get down quickly to push away Bertrand Traore's low drive. It was Rudi Garcia's hosts who struck the first blow, though, as Rami nodded a Payet free-kick back across the area for his centre-back partner Rolando to turn the ball in through the legs of Lopes. Mandanda made a magnificent save to tip Maxwel Cornet's curling effort onto the post, but Lyon equalised in fortuitous circumstances shortly afterwards. Traore completely miskicked with the goal gaping, but the ball ricocheted off Rami and looped past a stranded Mandanda. It took Lyon less than seven minutes of the second period to take a deserved lead, as Traore picked out Aouar on the edge of the area and the 19-year-old midfielder curled low into the corner to score his fourth league goal of the season. A draw would have been an excellent result for Marseille with a five-point lead to defend, but Lyon continued to outplay their hosts and Mandanda had to show all of his agility to get a vital hand on Traore's backheeled effort. Marseille managed to get a grip on proceedings and some terrible defending from the away side gifted Mitroglou the equaliser as Jeremy Morel's sliced clearance dropped for the Greek striker to head home. But former Manchester United winger Depay, who came on as a second-half substitute, leapt highest to direct Diaz's flick-on header into the far corner and spark wild Lyon celebrations. Earlier on Sunday, Dani Alves snatched champions elect Paris Saint-Germain a 2-1 victory at Nice in an early kick-off aimed specifically at the Asian television market. The Brazilian full-back stepped up in the absence of his injured compatriot Neymar with a late header after Angel Di Maria had cancelled out Allan Saint-Maximin's early opener for Nice. ""After the defeat against Real Madrid (in the Champions League), we have reacted very well. I'm pleased to see how the team has responded after that loss,"" PSG coach Unai Emery said. ""We were lacking that little something to forget the defeat. Perhaps a tiny element of it will never leave. But we've won against Metz, Angers, and now here and I like that."" PSG remain in total control of the title race, with reigning champions Monaco 17 points adrift in second place, with Marseille now seven points further behind. Claudio Ranieri's Nantes missed the chance to retake fifth spot from Rennes as they were held to a 1-1 draw at rock-bottom Metz, while Saint-Etienne moved into the top half of the table with a 2-0 win over Guingamp."
147,09/03/2018,12:28,Russian clubs' blame European defeats on winter break,Three top Russian clubs blamed the protracted winter break on defeats in the Europa League on Thursday.,"CSKA Moscow, Zenit St Petersburg and Lokomotiv Moscow all said the three-month recess had hampered their preparations for the last 16 first leg ties. ""We've played only four matches after the winter break,"" Zenit's former Chelsea defender Branislav Ivanovic said after a 2-1 loss in Leipzig. ""It was hard to prepare for this match properly because it's very difficult to find a quality pitch to train on in Saint Petersburg at this time of the year. ""Now we need to forget this match and to focus on our match on Sunday at Rostov, which, I believe, will also be very difficult,"" he said. CSKA Moscow, beaten 1-0 at home by French side Lyon, also reproached the wintry weather and the poor condition of the pitch at their home venue for their lacklustre performance. ""It's not a good result for a home match,"" CSKA playmaker Alan Dzagoev told Russian TV after the match. ""Our venue's service staff did everythng they could to prepare the pitch for the match but it wasn't enough at such a (bad) weather. ""We've all failed to show our best today as it was very hard to perform creative and skilled football at the pitch of such (a low) quality."" Dzagoev also expressed hope that the pitch at Grozny, where CSKA will face Terek on Sunday, will be in much better condition. Russian league table-toppers Lokomotiv Moscow also blamed lack of match practice after the winter break and the absence of their Peruvian midfielder Jefferson Farfan and Brazilian forward Ari, who were both sidelined with injuries, for their 3-0 drubbing at Atletico Madrid. ""We've played against a very strong team that always perform at their top and never reserve their strength,"" managers Yury Semin told the club's website. ""We've made too many mistakes and paid the price for it. But we've played just a couple of games since the winter break. Besides, we played without two of our team's first-choice players."" Semin also said that Lokomotiv will need to focus on their match at Ural Yekaterinburg which he considered to be very important for his team, seeking their third domestic title ever and first since 2004. The railway-backed outfit have a seven-point lead at the top over second-placed Krasnodar, who tackle strugglers Dynamo Moscow on Saturday. Reigning champions Spartak, CSKA and Zenit St Petersburg are all one point further back."
148,23/02/2018,13:32,Arsenal paired with AC Milan in Europa League last 16,"Arsenal, the last surviving British club, on Friday drew seven-time European champion AC Milan in the last 16 of the Europa League.","Arsenal struggled to overcome Swedish minnows Ostersunds in the last round, being booed off by their fans at the Emirates after losing 2-1 on Thursday but going through 4-2 win on aggregate. Atletico Madrid and French striker Antoine Griezmann were paired with Lokomotiv Moscow, the day after another Spanish-Russian game, between Athletic Bilbao and Spartak Moscow, was marred by violence in which a Spanish policeman died of a heart attack. Bilbao will face 1993 European champions Marseille for the matches on March 8 and 15. Another French side, Lyon, must overcome CSKA Moscow to keep alive their hopes of appearing in the final which will be played at their own stadium on May 16. Lyon were comfortable 4-1 aggregate winners over Villarreal in the round of 32 and former club stalwart Bernard Lacombe welcomed the draw which sees the second leg played in France. ""We qualified well against Villarreal, who are a good club. Obviously it would be fantastic to play in our own stadium (in the final) but there are high-level opponents left in the competition and we have to respect that,"" he told beIN Sports. RB Leipzig, who dropped into the competition after being eliminated from the Champions League, will play Zenit Saint-Petersburg, who won the Europa League in 2008. Borussia Dortmund meanwhile face potentially the weakest team in the last 16, Czech side Plzen."
149,18/02/2018,19:43,Lyon lose more ground in Champions League race,Bertrand Traore struck twice but Lyon fell further behind their rivals for a Champions League berth in France after surrendering a two-goal lead in Sunday's 2-2 draw at struggling Lille.,"Burkina Faso forward Traore, who joined from Chelsea last July, scored twice in the first half as Lyon looked on course for a welcome victory following three successive defeats in Ligue 1. But goals after the break from Nicolas Pepe and Brazilian striker Luiz Araujo earned Christophe Galtier's side a point that left Lille just one place above the relegation zone. Lyon looked the side most capable of troubling Paris Saint-Germain after beating the league leaders in January, but a subsequent rotten run of form means they could finish the weekend six points adrift of third-placed Marseille. Rudi Garcia's men host in-form Bordeaux later on Sunday at the Velodrome. Earlier, Nice captain Dante scored his first Ligue 1 goal for the club in a 1-1 draw with Claudio Ranieri's Nantes to snap a four-match losing run. The result bumped Nantes back up to fifth, while Mario Balotelli's Nice -- who lost 3-2 to Lokomotiv Moscow in the Europa League on Thursday -- are ninth after halting their recent slide. Nantes goalkeeper Ciprian Tatarusanu had a busy and effective afternoon but Dante got a toe to a loose ball in a scramble to give last season's third-place finishers a fifth-minute lead at the Allianz Riviera. The 34-year-old Dante joined Nice from Wolfsburg in 2016 and this was his first strike for them in 55 league games. The equaliser for Ranieri's visitors came courtesy of an Emiliano Sala penalty on 27 minutes as the Argentine striker netted his 11th goal of the campaign. Atlantic coast outfit Nantes appointed Ranieri, who won the Premier League with Leicester, just ahead of the current campaign when Sergio Conceicao quit to join Porto. PSG defeated Strasbourg 5-2 on Saturday to remain perfect at home this campaign, while second-placed Monaco thumped Dijon 4-0 on Friday."

But Fekir grabbed his 20th goal of the season with a 27th-minute spot-kick to restore his team's advantage. Lyon move into the last eight for the first time since winning the trophy for a fifth time six years ago, bouncing back from back-to-back league defeats that have seen them slip to fourth in Ligue 1. Coach Bruno Genesio made five changes to the side that blew a two-goal lead to lose 3-2 to 10-man Monaco at the weekend, and it was Cornet who made the most of his opportunity by giving them a 13th-minute lead. The 21-year-old latched onto Bertrand Traore's pass, and with Lecomte anticipating a cross, he fired home inside the near post with a clever first-time effort to score his fourth goal of the season. But Montpellier levelled just nine minutes later, as 19-year-old Paris Saint-Germain loanee Ikone met Paul Lasne's cutback to hammer into the top corner. It took Lyon less than five minutes to move back in front, though, as Pedro Mendes clumsily bundled over Fekir in the area, with the attacking midfielder picking himself up to slot in from the penalty spot. Lyon goalkeeper Anthony Lopes had to make a couple of good saves in the second half, while Memphis Depay spurned an excellent chance at the other end, but the away side held on with relative ease. Earlier on Wednesday, Caen edged out Ligue 1's bottom club Metz on penalties after a 2-2 draw, while third-tier Chambly ended fourth-division outfit Granville's run and Lens beat top-flight side Troyes. Paris Saint-Germain continued their bid for a fourth straight title as Angel Di Maria scored a hat-trick in Tuesday's 4-1 win at Sochaux. Marseille are also through after Kostas Mitroglou and Lucas Ocampos both scored trebles in a 9-0 thumping of second-tier Bourg-en-Bresse."

152,05/02/2018,00:09,Lopes caps rousing Monaco comeback win over Lyon,Rony Lopes struck a dramatic late winner as Monaco recovered from two goals down and overcame the first-half dismissal of Keita Balde to stun Lyon 3-2 in Ligue 1 on Sunday.,"Mariano Diaz scored a 12th-minute opener for Lyon at the Stade Louis II as his deflected shot from distance deceived Monaco goalkeeper Danijel Subasic, who hobbled off injured after tangling with the net. Lyon doubled their lead before the half-hour as Bertrand Traore, making his first league start since early November, volleyed in at the near post past replacement keeper Seydou Sy. But Senegal international Balde held off a succession of defenders before rifling in a low angled drive to halve the deficit just three minutes later. Radamel Falcao then equalised on 36 minutes when he converted the rebound after seeing his penalty, awarded for a foul on Kamil Glik, saved initially by Anthony Lopes. It took the Colombian to 17 league goals for the season -- trailing only Paris Saint-Germain duo Edinson Cavani (21) and Neymar (18). But Monaco were reduced to 10 men on the stroke of half-time as Balde, booked moments earlier for kicking away the ball in frustration, was shown a second yellow card for a nasty foul on Ferland Mendy. The hosts then lost captain Falcao to a thigh injury 10 minutes into the second half, but it was his replacement Stevan Jovetic who set up Portugal international Lopes for the winning goal a minute from time. Lyon conceded possession cheaply inside their own half, and the Montenegrin striker rolled the ball into the path of Lopes who drilled into the far corner to complete a sensational turnaround and help avenge last month's 3-2 loss in the French Cup. ""It was a very tough match. We conceded two goals far too early, we lost two players to injury and had a man sent off, everything was against us,"" Lopes said. ""But we showed we are a strong team and we deserved to win on the basis of the second half. It's our best match in terms of solidarity, but not in quality. We showed that we're a real team."" The result bumped Monaco up to third, one point behind Marseille, while Lyon finished the weekend a point outside the Champions League places in fourth after dropping from second. ""It was a sin not to have won tonight,"" Lyon coach Bruno Genesio said. ""Even worse to lose after the way we started. We had a really good start but then we practically stopped playing when we were 2-0 ahead."" Earlier, Claudio Ranieri's Nantes slumped to a 3-2 defeat at Caen as Damien Da Silva scored twice for the hosts, including an 80th-minute winner, after Yacine Bammou had grabbed a brace for the Canaries. Yeni Ngbakoto's stoppage-time goal at Roazhon Park edged Guingamp to a 1-0 victory at Rennes. A superb Neymar free-kick helped PSG to a 3-0 win at troubled Lille on Saturday as the Ligue 1 leaders began a decisive month as they mean to go on. The world's most expensive player netted the second goal at the Stade Pierre-Mauroy after Yuri Berchiche had opened the scoring just prior to half-time. Giovani Lo Celso's delightful chip secured the victory late on, with PSG now 11 points clear of Marseille at the top of the table. Marseille climbed to second on Friday as Florian Thauvin tormented Metz by hitting a hat-trick in a 6-3 rout of the league's basement side."
153,28/01/2018,23:47,"Fabinho grabs Monaco point at Marseille, Bordeaux stun Lyon","Fabinho struck to secure French champions Monaco an entertaining 2-2 draw at southern rivals Marseille on Sunday, while Malcom was at the centre of a penalty controversy as Bordeaux stunned Lyon.","Both teams at the Stade Velodrome missed the chance to take second place from Lyon, with Paris Saint-Germain now 11 points clear at the Ligue 1 summit. Keita Balde gave the visitors a fourth-minute lead, but Marseille centre-back Adil Rami quickly levelled with a close-range header. The hosts moved in front shortly after half-time as Valere Germain headed in against his former club. But Fabinho waltzed through the hapless home defence to equalise for Monaco, denying Marseille a seventh straight win in all competitions and extending his team's unbeaten league run to eight matches. ""Fabinho played a big match today, not only for the goal but for his defensive quality and ability to break the line,"" said Monaco coach Leonardo Jardim. The chase for the Champions League places remains wide open in France, with Lyon, Marseille and Monaco separated by just one point in the hunt for the second and third spots behind PSG. ""One point each was fair. In the war for second place there are no easy games, and it will continue like this until May,"" Jardim added. Senegal striker Balde, a close-season signing from Lazio, pounced on a loose ball to race clear and clip home his sixth league goal for Monaco and give them the perfect start. But the lead lasted less than three minutes, as Monaco shot themselves in the foot. A low cross from Valere Germain caused havoc and Florian Thauvin put pressure on right-back Almamy Toure, who saw his clearance deflected straight into the air for Rami to nod in his first league goal for Marseille. The game settled down after its frenetic start, but Rudi Garcia's hosts should have forged ahead in the 27th minute when Dimitri Payet blazed over with the goal at his mercy. Marseille completed the turnaround in the 47th minute, as Payet whipped in a free-kick and Germain stooped to send a diving header past away goalkeeper Danijel Subasic. It was the 27-year-old's 12th goal for OM since joining from Monaco last July. The champions hit back four minutes later, though, as Brazilian midfielder Fabinho strolled straight through the middle of the Marseille backline and slotted the ball in off the post. Monaco thought they had retaken the lead, but Jemerson's header was ruled out by the linesman's flag, despite the defender not being one of two visiting players in an offside position when Rachid Ghezzal swung in a free-kick. Both sides had chances to snatch all three points, with Marseille keeper Steve Mandanda denying Ghezzal and Germain volleying agonisingly wide, but neither could find the winner they needed to go second. Brazilian star Malcom appeared to dive for a crucial penalty as 10-man Bordeaux upset high-flying Lyon 3-1 to give new coach Gustavo Poyet a winning start in Ligue 1. Malcom, the 50 million-euro ($62m, £44m) rated winger who has been linked with Arsenal, also scored the 27th-minute penalty to give Bordeaux a shock 2-0 lead. Poyet had already seen Nicolas De Preville put the home side in front in south-western France, with Gaetan Laborde scoring another penalty for the hosts after Marcelo had pulled one back for Lyon. Bordeaux had another Brazilian, Otavio, sent off after the break but they held on to make it two wins from two games since previous coach Jocelyn Gourvennec was sacked. The result was a big blow to Lyon, who had beaten PSG at home last weekend and then won at Monaco in the French Cup on Wednesday. PSG beat Montpellier 4-0 on Saturday, with Neymar scoring twice and Angel Di Maria also on target after Edinson Cavani got the opener to take him to a club record 157 goals in all competitions."
154,19/01/2018,19:17,Aulas provokes PSG into 'fake news' accusation,"Paris Saint-Germain accused Lyon chairman Jean-Michel Aulas of peddling ""fake news"" on Friday, after he attacked the Ligue 1 leaders over their big transfer spending.","Aulas had denounced ""the dangerous inflation PSG creates in France"", and the capital club hit back on Twitter. PSG responded with an angry tweet that suggested Lyon were just trying to cash in and draw a big crowd when the visitors' big-name stars such as Neymar and Kylian Mbappe come to town. ""After today's fake news from Jean-Michel Aulas as a Lyon-PSG teaser, a question: are you trying to break records for attendance and gate receipts by hosting PSG?"" asked the tweet. Aulas took over at Lyon in 1987 and steered the club to seven consecutive league titles between 2002 and 2008. Since being bought by Qatar Sports Investments in 2011, PSG have won four league titles and are running away with Ligue 1 again this season, 11 points ahead of second-placed Lyon. Aulas has previous form in provoking PSG, especially before the clubs play. Ahead of the first meeting this season, a hard-won home victory for PSG, Aulas said there was ""no chance for second level clubs to compete on the field with PSG"". Paris midfielder Adrien Rabiot said at the time that he did ""not know if it is in order to destabilise us but it is not the first time, and it is often before PSG-Lyon"". ""PSG want to win the Champions League for geopolitical reasons,"" Aulas told French newspaper Le Parisien. ""The inflation generated in France by PSG is artificial inflation because the funds come from a state. PSG are trying to catch up and overtake the most powerful clubs, but they are clubs who generate their own resources."" Aulas also suggested that world-record signing Neymar isn't being paid 100 percent by PSG and questioned whether some of his salary comes directly from Qatar."
155,19/11/2017,20:29,Lyon held to draw by Montpellier,Lyon's four-match winning streak in Ligue 1 came to an end in the absence of captain Nabil Fekir as they were held to a 0-0 home draw by Montpellier on Sunday.,"Bruno Genesio's men slipped to nine points adrift of league leaders Paris Saint-Germain after a disappointing performance, while they could lose third place to Marseille, who play Bordeaux later on Sunday. The hosts went into the game in a rich vein of form, having scored 21 goals in six league matches since a 2-0 defeat at PSG in September. But they had to make do without top scorer Fekir, with the 24-year-old suspended after picking up his third yellow card of the campaign for his celebration after scoring the final goal in the 5-0 derby thrashing of Saint-Etienne. ""Montpellier, who defended well, were good and we didn't know what to do to win,"" said Lyon defender Mouctar Diakhaby. ""It's certain that Nabil (Fekir) was missed today. We can not do without such a player."" Brazilian centre-back Marcelo added: ""We know that we have a good team, but when we miss a player of the quality of Nabil Fekir, it's obviously a big problem. He is very important for us."" Lyon coach Bruno Genesio replaced Fekir with Maxwel Cornet, with 20-year-old Tanguy Ndombele coming in for Bertrand Traore who was left on the bench. The hosts should have taken the lead less than 10 minutes in, but midfielder Houssem Aouar fired wide from close range. Midtable Montpellier also went close early on, with Paul Lasne crashing a 25-yard strike narrowly over the top of Anthony Lopes' crossbar. The best chance of the opening 45 minutes fell to Cornet, but after bursting through, the winger's tame effort was saved by the legs of Montpellier goalkeeper Benjamin Lecomte. Memphis Depay struggled to make an impact on the left-hand side, curling an ambitious effort straight at Lecomte midway through the second half, while Traore was a peripheral figure after coming off the bench as the game fizzled out. Earlier on Sunday, Nice's miserable start to the season continued as Ronny Rodelin scored an injury-time equaliser for Caen in a 1-1 draw. Pierre Lees-Melou had given Nice a first-half lead, but with Mario Balotelli suspended, Lucien Favre's men failed to build on that advantage and are now just two points clear of the bottom two. PSG extended their lead at the top of the table over Monaco to six points by beating Nantes 4-1 on Saturday, with Edinson Cavani scoring a brace. Defending champions Monaco dropped two points in a 1-1 draw at newly-promoted Amiens on Friday, despite a second-half equaliser from Stevan Jovetic."

But a banner at one end of the ground carried the slogan ""This Game is Over"" in English, parodying Evra's favourite slogan of ""I love this game"". Another banner read: ""We don't want you in our colours anymore. Evra get lost."" Chants also rang out insulting the former Manchester United and Juventus left-back, who was red-carded after the incident, which occurred in the pre-match warm-up before the game in Portugal. Without him Marseille ran riot, stretching their unbeaten run in the league to seven games to stay fourth. Luiz Gustavo put the home side ahead just before the break, sweeping home after a Florian Thauvin shot had been blocked. Thauvin then made it 2-0 just after the restart before Morgan Sanson got the third. But Thauvin was the main threat and the winger crossed for Kostas Mitroglou to head in before he completed the scoring with his second of the afternoon. ""It's difficult to go through, of course, but what counts is having three points more tonight,"" Marseille coach Rudi Garcia said. ""As athletes we only have one thing to do: express ourselves on the pitch, enjoy it and please our fans."" Lyon captain Nabil Fekir scored twice -- taking his tally for the season to 11 -- in a 5-0 demolition of bitter rivals Saint-Etienne, but he could face punishment after a provocative celebration sparked a late pitch invasion that forced a 30-minute delay. Memphis Depay rolled in Lyon's first goal on 10 minutes -- after the match was briefly interrupted by a flurry of smoke bombs inside the Stade Geoffroy-Guichard -- before Fekir made it 2-0 on 25 minutes. Leo Lacroix was sent off for Saint-Etienne just after half-time, with goals from Mariano Diaz and Bertrand Traore piling on the misery for the home side before Fekir completed the rout. But the France international triggered a furious reaction in the stands after removing his shirt and dangling it in front of the home fans, prompting the deployment of riot police to clear the pitch of a horde of supporters. ""Perhaps it's not a gesture to do, there was no need for that. I don't regret it but there you go,"" Fekir told Canal+. ""I think it's a shame, the solution was to win the match,"" Lyon coach Bruno Genesio said. ""There's no point in rubbing it in and provoking. You need to be able to remain modest. You shouldn't do something like that, it's not good."" Earlier, Mario Balotelli scored the only goal of the game as Nice beat Dijon 1-0, only for his afternoon to be marred when he was sent off late on. The Italian striker converted a penalty five minutes from half-time for his sixth league goal of the campaign. He was then sent off for the third time in Ligue 1 since moving to Nice at the start of last season, receiving a straight red card for chopping down Dijon defender Cedric Yambere from behind with a minute left. Balotelli remonstrated with the fourth official as he went off but Nice held on to end a run of four successive league defeats and six consecutive losses in all competitions. ""Without criticising anyone, it seems a bit harsh. He wanted to win the ball and had no intention to hurt anyone,"" said Nice coach Lucien Favre of Balotelli's sending-off. ""But it is true that a tackle from behind is a straight red. He was annoyed after the match and thought it was too hard on him. But now he's ok."" Lille eased the pressure on coach Marcelo Bielsa with a 3-0 win away at bottom club Metz -- their first victory since the opening weekend of the campaign."

Bertrand Traore rounded Jordan Pickford to break the deadlock on 68 minutes, with the Burkina Faso striker breaking down in tears just days after the death of former international team-mate Soulama Abdoulaye. The 37-year-old Abdoulaye died last week after a long illness. He won 42 caps for Burkina Faso and featured in the squad that reached the 2013 Africa Cup of Nations final. An emotional Traore was replaced moments after scoring, as Memphis Depay then set up 19-year-old Houssem Aouar to steer in a slick second goal for the hosts on 76 minutes. The former Manchester United winger completed the scoring himself late on after another ex-United player, Morgan Schneiderlin, was sent off for a second booking in the Group E clash. ""We're really disappointed with the result. For nearly 70 minutes, we were nearly perfect with our game plan and created a couple of opportunities and should have scored,"" said Everton caretaker manager David Unsworth, who refused to be drawn on his future. ""It's not about me, it's about the football club. Whatever will be, will be. It's for other people to decide. It's about recovering from this result and picking the team for Sunday (against Watford) -- a cup final, for me."" Everton also lost defender Cuco Martina to a worrying incident in the first half as the Curacao international was stretchered off in a neck brace following an awkward fall. ""Cuco was concussed and complaining of pains down his neck. He's gone straight to hospital for X-rays and scans. We wish him all the best,"" said Unsworth. Seven-time European champions AC Milan, in the midst of a poor run of form in Serie A, failed to relieve much pressure on under-fire manager Vincenzo Montella following a 0-0 draw at AEK Athens. The Italians hit the post on 57 minutes through Riccardo Montolivo, while Turkey midfielder Hakan Calhanoglu had a powerful drive turned away as Milan remained two points clear of their Greek hosts in Group D. Vitaliy Buyalskiy fired Dynamo Kiev into the knockout phase after the Ukrainian side secured a 1-0 victory over Group B rivals Young Boys in Switzerland. Villarreal are on course to advance from Group A after a 2-0 victory at Slavia Prague, but Hoffenheim's qualification hopes in Group C suffered a costly blow as the Germans conceded a stoppage-time equaliser in a 1-1 draw away to Istanbul Basaksehir. Having made a perfect start to their Europa League campaign, Arsenal can secure a place in the knockout phase with two group games to spare by beating Red Star Belgrade later on Thursday. The Gunners play host to the 1991 European Cup winners in north London a fortnight after Olivier Giroud's remarkable late goal secured a 1-0 win in Belgrade. Surprise Swedish side Ostersund -- coached by Englishman Graham Potter -- will extend their run in Europe into the New Year with the right combination of results as they visit Athletic Bilbao."
158,20/10/2017,16:04,Everton ban fan who attacked Lyon player while holding child,Everton on Friday banned a fan who appeared to try and strike a Lyon player while holding a child during their Europa League tie as UEFA opened disciplinary proceedings following the crowd trouble at Goodison Park.,"The ugly scenes on Thursday erupted after Ashley Williams barged into Lyon goalkeeper Anthony Lopes midway through the second half of the 2-1 victory for the French side, sparking a melee. That skirmish moved to pitch-side advertising hoardings, at which point a man carrying a young boy pushed Lopes in the head before hitting out at him again. ""Club officials have reviewed the footage of an incident that occurred in the 64th minute of the game against Olympique Lyonnais where supporters towards the front of the lower Gwladys Street End became involved in a confrontation between players,"" Everton said in a statement. ""We have identified one individual whom action will now be taken against. This will include a ban from attending future Everton fixtures and the club registering a formal complaint with Merseyside Police."" European football's governing body UEFA later issued a statement saying it had opened disciplinary proceedings against Everton, charging the club with ""aggressions by supporters against players"". The case will be dealt with by UEFA's control, ethics and disciplinary body on November 16. Merseyside Police said they were investigating the incident, adding in a statement: ""Detectives will be reviewing footage and speaking to witnesses to establish what, if any, offences have been committed."" Williams, who was Everton captain, instigated the trouble when he shoved Lopes off the pitch as the goalkeeper went up to make a catch on the byline. Numerous Lyon players reacted angrily and a fracas broke out involving players from both sides. Williams, who shortly afterwards equalised for Everton, was booked for his role and appeared fortunate to escape with just a caution as replays showed he raised his hands to Lucas Tousart's face. ""It's what happens, it's football, it is what it is,"" said Williams after the game. ""It's high emotions. We want to win the game, they want to win the game and stuff happens. That was just one of those times."" After the game, Toffees manager Ronald Koeman blamed referee Bas Nijhuis for his players losing their cool during a defeat that leaves Everton facing Europa League elimination after just one point from three games. He said the referee did not take strong enough action against what he termed the ""theatre"" of the Lyon players. But speaking to the press on Friday, Koeman, while admiring Williams's battling qualities, said the player needed to ""control himself"". ""By frustration you get maybe more aggression, and that's not bad -- but you need to control yourself,"" he said. ""I understand his situation of yesterday, his personal situation. It was difficult after missing out on the World Cup with Wales and he had made some mistakes that cost a goal. ""I like that mentality -- he showed his face yesterday, he played well, he was the captain on the pitch. Of course, in the situation of the brawl he needs to control himself."" The defeat compounded another miserable night for Everton and Koeman, who is under mounting pressure, with his team having won just two of their previous 12 fixtures."
159,19/10/2017,23:09,Lyon beat Everton to pile pressure on Koeman,"Lyon piled the pressure on Everton manager Ronald Koeman with a 2-1 Europa League win at Goodison Park on Thursday, while Olivier Giroud's acrobatic late strike snatched Arsenal a 1-0 victory over 10-man Red Star Belgrade.","Nabil Fekir's penalty put French side Lyon ahead early on as Everton struggled for inspiration with Wayne Rooney rested and watching on from the stands. The crowd only really got behind their team when a mass brawl broke out between the players in the second half after skipper Ashley Williams pushed over Anthony Lopes as the Lyon goalkeeper jumped to catch the ball. The Wales international was lucky not to see red as he also appeared to land blows on several players, while some home fans tried to get in on the action by leaning over the barriers. The incident is unlikely to go unnoticed by UEFA, but Williams brushed it off by powering home a header from a Gylfi Sigurdsson free-kick just minutes later. But Lyon were the better side and retook the lead through Bertrand Traore's clever finish. Williams played down his moment of madness, telling BT Sport: ""It's football. It is what it is. We want to win and so do they. These things happen."" Everton now turn their attentions to a home Premier League match with Arsenal on Sunday, where anything other than three points would put Koeman's position under even more scrutiny. ""It is a big one. They are all big, especially against a top team at home,"" Williams added. ""We need a win and a performance."" The Merseyside outfit, who have only won two Premier League matches in eight games this season despite significant close-season transfer investment, remain bottom of Group E on one point after a winless three games. Italians Atalanta top the standings ahead of Lyon after seeing off Apollon Limassol 3-1. Captain Fekir put Lyon ahead in just the sixth minute from the spot after a rash tackle from Everton full-back Mason Holgate on Fernando Marcal. The hosts finally created a chance as Kevin Mirallas was denied by Lopes after a clever pass from Tom Davies, before Lyon almost doubled their lead when a long-range Memphis Depay free-kick struck the crossbar with the aid of a deflection. After Williams' crazy spell ultimately dragged Everton back into the game, they were hit by a sucker-punch as Burkina Faso forward Traore gave Bruno Genesio's Lyon a deserved victory with a backheeled finish from Maxwel Cornet's cutback. Goalkeeper Jordan Pickford spared Everton further embarrassment with a string of late saves. Earlier on Thursday, Arsenal rode their luck at times in an uninspiring performance, before Giroud struck in the 85th minute after Red Star had seen Milan Rodic sent off. Arsenal took advantage in style with a wonderful goal, as Jack Wilshere's clever flick was turned across goal by Walcott for Giroud to send an overhead kick spinning into the top corner. The Premier League side stay top of Group H, five points clear of Red Star, after three straight wins. ""I said yesterday in our press conference I don't think anyone can question our character, we showed that tonight,"" midfielder Jack Wilshere told arsenal.com. Italian Serie A high-flyers Lazio came from behind to win 3-1 at Nice. Mario Balotelli opened the scoring for Nice in the fourth minute, after announcing the birth of his son Lion earlier this week, only for Felipe Caicedo to equalise seconds later. The Italian capital-city side took top spot in Group K and extended their unbeaten away run in the Europa League to 11 matches as midfielder Sergej Milinkovic-Savic scored a second-half brace. But seven-time European champions AC Milan continued to struggle as they were held to a 0-0 home draw by AEK Athens in Group D. Real Sociedad bounced back from their 3-1 defeat by Zenit St Petersburg last time out with a 6-0 thrashing of Vardar in Macedonia as Brazilian Willian Jose scored four goals in 25 minutes."
160,13/10/2017,23:22,Monaco beaten by late Lyon thunderbolt,Nabil Fekir's last-gasp free-kick delivered three crucial points to Lyon in Ligue 1 Friday as their captain sealed a 3-2 home win over champions Monaco.,"The defeat of the second-placed southerners offers Paris Saint-Germain the chance to climb six points clear at Dijon on Saturday. Lyon, who last won the title in 2008, climbed to third after back-to-back 3-3 draws. With an eye on their Champions League game at home to Besiktas on Tuesday Monaco had rested key striker Radamel Falcao who had scored 12 goals in eight league games but played for Colombia in midweek. Lyon started with all guns blazing as new boy Mariano, signed from Real Madrid, almost stole a goal sneaking up on Danijel Subasic on the line only to hit the post. But he stole in again unmarked to tap in a Fekir cross on 11 minutes before Monaco's new star Rony Lopes fired an impressive equaliser form the edge of the box on 17 minutes. Fekir then rounded off a magnificent Lyon move with a slick shot from near the penalty spot on 23 before Adama Traore cracked a belter into the top corner on 34 minutes to equalise for Monaco. The second half was less breathtaking but built to a stunning finale with Fekir victim of a razor's edge off-side decision on 90 before his late long range free-kick earned Lyon their fourth league win so far. ""The three points are really important. It was a great result even if they were missing key players,"" Fekir told French television. Monaco's Lopes was keen to forget a match they might easily have won. ""We should have scored in the second half, it's always tough to lose late like that, but we'll put it behind us. We have the Champions League now,"" said the 21-year-old attacking midfielder. Monaco are unrecognisable from the team that romped to Ligue 1 last season having lost Kylian Mbappe to PSG, Benjamin Mendy and Bernardo Silva to Man City and Tiemoue Bakayoko to Chelsea. But many of their new players especially Lopes, formerly of Man City, and Terence Kongolo in defence look promising. PSG pay a visit to lowly Dijon on Saturday with five key players out including Edinson Cavani, Marco Verratti, Thiago Motta, Thiago Silva and Layvin Kurzawa after international action."
161,12/10/2017,02:10,Falcao-less Monaco bid to put pressure on PSG,"French champions Monaco will make the tricky trip to Lyon on Friday without red-hot striker Radamel Falcao, as they look to keep up the pressure on Ligue 1 leaders Paris Saint-Germain.","Leonardo Jardim's side dropped two points with a 1-1 home draw against Montpellier before the international break to slip three points adrift of PSG at the top of the table. Colombian Falcao has been in stunning form so far this season, scoring 12 goals in just eight league outings, but his midweek efforts in helping his country qualify for next year's World Cup have ruled him out of Friday's game. ""He played last night, then there are the different trips (to get back to Monaco),"" Jardim said on Wednesday. ""To try to play against Lyon could kill him. He will not play. In fact, his physical condition doesn't allow him to play two matches in 48 hours."" Falcao will play in the World Cup finals for the first time in Russia, after setting up James Rodriguez's goal as Colombia booked their place with a 1-1 draw in Peru. ""He deserves to play in a World Cup, he is a great player of a very high quality,"" added Jardim. ""I congratulated him for the qualification, but my management of Falcao won't change. I'll do everything I can to keep him at his best."" Despite Falcao's early goal, Monaco were far from their best in their last league match against Montpellier and will have to bounce back with Argentinian Guido Carrillo likely to start up front. Lyon have started to struggle in recent weeks after a bright start to the season and are winless in their last three matches, including back-to-back 3-3 draws against Angers and Dijon. Bruno Genesio's men will be without centre-back Marcelo, after the Brazilian's bizarre sending off against Angers, when he was given a straight red card for accidentally knocking a yellow card out of the referee's hand. PSG pay a visit to lowly Dijon on Saturday with key forwards Kylian Mbappe and Edinson Cavani boosted after helping their countries qualify for the World Cup in midweek. World-record signing Neymar failed to score in Brazil's final two World Cup qualifiers, so he will be desperate to terrorise a Dijon defence which has already shipped 17 goals in Ligue 1 this term. Mbappe came off the bench as France confirmed their place in Russia with a 2-1 win over Belarus, while Cavani scored as Uruguay sealed second in South American qualifying, behind Brazil, by beating Bolivia 4-2. Unai Emery's side may have half an eye on Wednesday's Champions League game against Anderlecht in Brussels, but should have more than enough to continue their unbeaten start to the season in all competitions. The capital-city club are brimming with confidence after a stunning start to the campaign, which they continued by thrashing Bordeaux 6-2 a fortnight ago. But centre-back Thiago Silva is likely to miss the matches at Dijon and Anderlecht after suffering a thigh muscle injury while on Brazil duty. Under-fire Lille coach Marcelo Bielsa sees his team host Troyes as they continue their search for a first win since the opening weekend, after their last match at Amiens was abandoned when a stadium barrier collapsed, injuring 29 people. On Sunday, Claudio Ranieri's Nantes defend a seven-game unbeaten run at Bordeaux, while third-placed Marseille bid for a fourth straight win against newly-promoted Strasbourg.

163,05/07/2017,18:17,Arsenal break club record to clinch Lacazette deal,"Arsenal agreed a deal to sign France striker Alexandre Lacazette from Lyon for a club-record fee that could rise to 60 million euros ($68m, £52.56m), the two clubs confirmed on Wednesday.","The transfer fee is also a new record sale for the Ligue 1 outfit, worth an initial 53m euros, according to a statement on the Lyon website. The deal beats the 50m euros that Arsenal paid to bring Mesut Ozil to the Emirates from Real Madrid in 2013, while it sees Lyon break their highest sale for the second time in a month after seeing midfielder Corentin Tolisso move to Bayern Munich for 47.5m euros. Arsenal said the 26-year-old had signed a ""long-term contract"". ""We are very happy to have Alexandre join our group. He has shown over a number of years that he can score goals and that he is a very efficient finisher,"" Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger said in a statement. ""As well, he has very interesting technical qualities and a strong character. ""So he is a guy who is a great addition for us, and someone who will help us challenge at the top level this season."" He had been at Lyon since the age of 12, and scored 129 goals for the senior team, including 100 in Ligue 1. Lacazette, who has made 11 international appearances for France, last season became the first player to score 20 goals or more in three successive French top-flight seasons since Jean-Pierre Papin in 1992. ""I am very pleased with the success of Alexandre, who, besides being one of Olympique Lyon's best-ever strikers, is a charming player who I became very close to,"" said Lyon president Jean-Michel Aulas in his club's statement. Lacazette will be hoping that the move to Arsenal can help boost his hopes of cementing a place in the France squad ahead of next year's World Cup, having only played one international in the last two years. The north London club will be expecting Lacazette to add some much-needed firepower up front, after a disappointing fifth-placed finish in the Premier League last term that saw them miss out on the Champions League for the first time in 19 years. He scored 37 goals in all competitions last season, including 28 in just 30 league games. Meanwhile, the signing puts the Arsenal future of Olivier Giroud in doubt. The former Montpellier front-man is currently above Lacazette in France coach Didier Deschamps' pecking order, but he could now struggle to find a place in Wenger's Gunners starting XI under pressure from his compatriot. Giroud has been linked with possible moves to both Everton and West Ham United. But Arsenal supporters will be delighted to see Wenger spending big, as they look to mount a serious challenge on a first league title since 'the Invincibles' lifted the Premier League trophy in 2004."

""After speaking with Monchi (Sports director) and the coach about their ambitions, I did not hesitate for a moment,"" Gonalons said. ""For this reason there were no issues and everything was agreed very quickly,"" said Gonalons, who has over 300 Ligue 1 appearances and many Champions League campaigns under his belt. ""Maxime is a footballer of international stature,"" sporting director Monchi said. ""In addition to his technical ability, we are delighted to add his experience and personality to our group."""
165,26/06/2017,21:26,Traore leaves Chelsea for Lyon,"Chelsea forward Bertrand Traore has joined Lyon for 10 million euros (£8.8m, $11.2m) on a five-year deal, the French club announced on Monday.","Chelsea will earn 15 percent of any profit from a future sale of the player and the English champions will have first refusal on Traore should he eventually move on, Lyon president Jean-Michel Aulas said at a press conference to announce the signing. ""I was really keen to come to Lyon,"" admitted the 21-year-old Burkina Faso international, who spent last season on loan at Europa League runners-up Ajax. ""We wish him well for his career in France and thank him for his contribution at Chelsea,"" the London club said in a statement. Traore, who was handed his Chelsea debut by Jose Mourinho in a Champions League game against Maccabi Tel Aviv in September 2015, is Lyon's second summer signing following the arrival of Brazilian left-back Fernando Marçal from Benfica. Lyon begin pre-season training on Tuesday but Traore will not join up with his new team-mates until July 10.

United will travel to Spain for the first leg on May 4 before Celta visit Manchester for the return on May 11. With United currently four points outside the Premier League top four, winning the Europa League for the first time may represent their best chance of qualifying for the Champions League. Celta sit 10th in La Liga and progressed from the quarter-finals after following up a 3-2 home win against Genk by drawing Thursday's second leg 1-1 in Belgium. United have never faced Celta in UEFA competition and the Spanish side are through to a major European semi-final for the first time in their history. As England's final European representatives this season, United were made to sweat by Anderlecht in the quarter-final second leg on Thursday. Marcus Rashford's extra-time goal sealed a 2-1 win at Old Trafford that sent United through 3-2 on aggregate. If United make it to the final in Stockholm's Friends Arena on May 24 it will be the club's first appearance in the decisive match of Europe's second-tier tournament. It would also be United's first European final since they lost the 2011 Champions League decider against Barcelona at Wembley."
167,21/04/2017,00:29,Lyon break Besiktas hearts in Istanbul after 1st leg clashes,"Lyon ended the Europa League dream of Turkey's Besiktas in an epic penalty shoot-out in Istanbul Thursday, with the French side pulling into the semi finals despite travelling with virtually no fans after first leg clashes between supporters.","With the result ending 2-1 to Besiktas on the night and 3-3 on aggregate, the match went to penalties as the clock ticked well past midnight. Matching each other penalty for penalty until number six, Dusko Tosic saw his effort saved by Lyon's Anthony Lopes but Christophe Jallet skied over the crossbar for Lyon. But on number eight, Matej Mitrovic's effort was saved for Besiktas and Maxime Gonalons then made no mistake to put Lyon through and plunge the Turks into despair. The first leg tie last week in Lyon had been marred by angry clashes between fans that resulted in a delay to the start of the game and led to both sides receiving bans -- suspended for two years -- from their next European competition. As a precaution, Lyon advised fans not to travel and only a dozen Lyon fans made the journey to Istanbul, comfortably and safely seated in the VIP section as Besiktas fans happily snapped up their seat contingent. ""What is important is to salute the Lyon team who, despite all the adversities of the last 10 days, have succeeded in an incredible story,"" said Lyon president Jean-Michel Aulas. The tension was on the pitch rather than the stands as both sides scrapped energetically for the semi-final berth. Adding further spice, the game took place days after a disputed referendum in Turkey that has led to daily protests in the Besiktas district of the city, a well known opposition hub. Carrying a 1-2 deficit into the home leg but with the crucial away goal, Besiktas could count on the fanatical support of some 40,000 of its famously passionate fans. Roared on by the packed Vodafone Arena on the shores of the Bosphorus just opposite a former palace for Ottoman Sultans, Besiktas drew first blood as Brazilian Talisca scored after a corner in the 27th minute. But Lyon's highly regarded Alexandre Lacazette equalised 10 minutes later with an exquisite chip over Fabricio in the Besiktas goal. Lacazette nearly put the game beyond Besiktas' reach after the break, hitting the woodwork with a pearl of a shot and watching the ball cross across the goal. Causing near pandemonium in the stadium, Talisca pulled Besiktas level on aggregate with a powerful header that beat the stranded Lopes in the Lyon goal on the 57th minute. In a heart-stopping end to normal time, Besiktas' Ricardo Quaresma hit the outside post with a daring angled shot and Ryan Babel failed with the rebound. For Lyon, Lacazette hit the crossbar. Besiktas had the running for most of the extra time but failed to convert chances. Fabricio denied Lyon's Corentin Tolisso with a spectacular one handed save. Besiktas has branded the sanction levied by UEFA for the fighting last week as ""scandalous"" while Lyon said that it was fair. At the tie in France, up to 20,000 Turkish fans, the majority living in France or Germany, were intermingled among the 35,000 supporters of Lyon on top of the 3,000 fans from Istanbul situated in the visitors' section. But clearly aware they were under the microscope, Besiktas fans put on a blemish-free display at the Vodafone Arena, which was opened in 2016. The November 1993 clash between Istanbul's Galatasaray and Manchester United -- when Turkish fans welcomed the English team with ""Welcome to Hell"" banners -- is still remembered but Turkish football bosses like to think fan behaviour has moved on since then. ezz-sjw/dj GALATASARAY SPORTIF BESIKTAS FUTBOL VODAFONE GROUP MANCHESTER UNITED"

""As organisers of the game we are responsible,"" said Lyon's deputy chief legal director Vincent Ponsot on the day after the game. ""Except that in this instance it's clear we were victims of aggression from Turkish supporters.""

There is no need to punish Besiktas,"" club spokesman Metin Albayrak told state-run Anadolu news agency before the UEFA ruling on Wednesday. The second leg of the tie, in which Lyon lead 2-1, takes place in Istanbul on Thursday. Lyon president Jean-Michel Aulas had expressed fears for the safety of his team in the Turkish city. But Besiktas chairman Fikret Orman said that Lyon had nothing to be scared of at the team's stadium on the shores of the Bosphorus, distancing the club's fans from responsibility in the violence. ""Here is our home,"" he said at a club meeting inside the Vodafone Arena stadium. ""Don't be afraid. We are everyone's defender so come here and watch the match in a really nice way."""

Lyon president Jean-Michel Aulas was subsequently seen calling for calm inside the stadium via a loudspeaker. The incidents were the latest in a tense week for European football after the Borussia Dortmund team bus was attacked with explosives on Tuesday just before their Champions League game at home to Monaco.

That would make Depay, capped 27 times at international level, Lyon's biggest signing since the club-record purchase of Yoann Gourcuff from Bordeaux for 22 million euros in 2010. ""Hungry to play for OL. I feel strong and ready to rise to the challenge #TeamOL,"" Depay wrote on his Twitter account. ""Thanks for all the memories during my time as a Red Devil. I will never forget all your support at @ManUtd. #RedDevils #ManUtd"" The 22-year-old joined United from PSV Eindhoven in June 2015, but the winger had a disappointing first season under compatriot Louis van Gaal and had made just one start in all competitions since Jose Mourinho became manager last July. The deal reportedly includes buy-back and sell-on clauses, and Mourinho refused to rule out an eventual return to Old Trafford for the Dutchman. ""He didn't succeed in this 18 months, I would say, but he is very young so I think it is important for the club to keep control of this talent,"" said the Portuguese. ""And we all wish that he plays very, very well at Olympique Lyon and why not to come back because everyone here likes him."" Depay, who scored seven goals in 53 United appearances, becomes the second player to leave Old Trafford this month after France international midfielder Morgan Schneiderlin joined Everton."
175,18/01/2017,20:00,Man Utd and Lyon agree Depay fee - reports,"Manchester United have agreed to sell Dutch winger Memphis Depay to Lyon for a fee that could reach around 25 million euros ($26.7 million), British media reported on Wednesday.","Depay, 22, joined United from PSV Eindhoven for a reported fee of £25 million ($30.7 million, 28.8 million euros) in June 2015. But he had a disappointing first season under compatriot Louis van Gaal and has made just one start in all competitions since Jose Mourinho became manager last July. Media outlets including Britain's Press Association and Sky Sports said United had reached a deal with Lyon that included buy-back and sell-on clauses. A Lyon spokesman told AFP earlier on Wednesday that the deal was ""on the right track"". Depay stands to become Lyon's biggest signing since the club-record purchase of Yoann Gourcuff from Bordeaux for 22 million euros in 2010. Lyon coach Bruno Genesio praised Depay, capped 27 times by the Netherlands, during a recent press conference and described the player as his ""priority"" for the January transfer window. ""He's forceful, powerful, capable of scoring and helping to score,"" Genesio said. ""He's a fairly complete player, a winger, who can play with both feet."" Depay is thought to have been signed as a replacement for Rachid Ghezzal, who is currently at the Africa Cup of Nations with Algeria and whose contract expires at the end of the season. Depay, who has scored seven goals in 53 United appearances, will become the second player to leave Old Trafford this month after France international midfielder Morgan Schneiderlin joined Everton."
176,13/01/2017,14:40,Dutch striker Depay top Lyon target,"Manchester United's Dutch striker Memphis Depay has become the top target of French club Lyon during the winter transfer window, coach Bruno Genesio said Friday.","""I'm a fan of this player and have made him my priority,"" Genesio told a press conference as he outlined the 23-year-old's qualities. ""He's forceful, powerful, capable of scoring and helping to score. He's a fairly complete player, a winger, who can play with both feet."" Genesio said he was looking to Depay as a possible replacement for Algerian winger Rachid Ghezzal. ""His profile is interesting in view of the probable departure of Ghezzal at the end of the championship,"" said the Lyon coach. ""He's a young player who has quite a margin for progression with international experience. ""He has enormous potential but I'm not discussing the transfer fee. ""We don't know the fixed price but it's possible his recruitment would allow us to anticipate for next season."" Capped 27 times for the Netherlands, Depay started his career at PSV Eindhoven and has played at Manchester United since 2015."
177,21/11/2016,02:01,Spotlight on Ronaldo for European homecoming,worldfootball looks ahead to Tuesday's Champions League action as Cristiano Ronaldo goes back to first club Sporting Lisbon and Tottenham Hotspur face a crunch trip to Monaco (kick-offs 1945 GMT unless stated):,"<strong>Group E</strong> At Moscow (1700 GMT) CSKA Moscow (RUS) v Bayer Leverkusen (GER) Morale is on the floor in Moscow with CSKA bottom of Group E before Leverkusen's visit. The defending Russian champions this week saw their midfielder Roman Eremenko hit with a two-year ban for cocaine use after a positive test following the reverse fixture between the teams in September. Eremenko's goal in that match gave CSKA a 2-2 draw after being two goals down. The Muscovites registered their first win in five league games at the weekend and must win this game to keep alive their hopes of reaching the last 16. Leverkusen can progress by avoiding defeat, provided Tottenham Hotspur lose away to Monaco. The Germans are unbeaten in the section, following up three draws by beating Tottenham at Wembley last time out. However, they are struggling in mid-table in the Bundesliga having lost at home to RB Leipzig at the weekend. At Monaco Monaco (FRA) v Tottenham Hotspur (ENG) Tottenham travel to the Mediterranean principality boosted by claiming a first win in eight matches at the weekend, when they beat West Ham United 3-2 after a dramatic late fightback in the Premier League. Mauricio Pochettino's side are in real trouble in the Champions League having lost at home to Monaco and Bayer Leverkusen. They will be eliminated if they fail to win at the Stade Louis II and Leverkusen better their result when they face CSKA Moscow in Russia. Monaco need only draw the game to be sure of a place in the last 16. They will secure first place if they win and Leverkusen drop points. Leonardo Jardim's side are the leading scorers in Europe's big five leagues, averaging three goals a game in Ligue 1, including a 3-0 win at Lorient on Friday. Leading their attack is a revitalised Radamel Falcao, with the Colombian having netted nine times in all competitions this season. The teams drew 1-1 here in the Europa League last season. Toby Alderweireld and Ben Davies are on the sidelines for Spurs and Erik Lamela, who scored at the Stade Louis II last season, is also doubtful. <strong>Group F</strong> At Dortmund, Germany Borussia Dortmund (GER) v Legia Warsaw (POL) Dortmund, the 1997 winners and 2013 runners-up, are already certain to progress to the last 16 having amassed 10 points from their first four matches. Thomas Tuchel's side are now looking to secure top spot and a win at home to already-eliminated Legia will guarantee them first place, as long as Real Madrid drop points at Sporting Lisbon. At the very least, a win will ensure the Bundesliga club go to Madrid next month in a position to clinch the group. Dortmund are fresh from beating Bayern Munich 1-0 in ""Der Klassiker"" at the weekend thanks to Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang's 12th Bundesliga goal of the season. The Gabon star was also on target as Dortmund won 6-0 away to Legia in their group opener in September. Legia, who remain in with a chance of finishing third and going into the Europa League, have improved since a poor start to the campaign. The Poles have won five of their last six games, the exception being a 3-3 draw at home to Real Madrid. At Lisbon Sporting Lisbon (POR) v Real Madrid (ESP) Cristiano Ronaldo takes on his first professional club Sporting as a champion of Europe with Real and Portugal and is widely expected to pick up his fourth Ballon d'Or. He will doubtless receive a hero's welcome on his return to the Estadio Jose Alvalade. Ronaldo's hat-trick this weekend, his 39th for Real, delivered a 3-0 away win at Atletico Madrid despite the visitors missing six key players in captain Sergio Ramos, Pepe, Casemiro, Toni Kroos, Alvaro Morata and Karim Benzema. Champions League holders Real won the reverse fixture 2-1 and are unbeaten in 29 games in all competitions. All Zinedine Zidane's men need here is a point to secure passage to the next round, but with Dortmund top of the group by two points Real will want to hunt them down as a point of pride -- and to earn an easier draw in the next round. Sporting are on an upturn and scoring regularly and are still in with a chance of the Europa League. <strong>Group G</strong> At Leicester, England Leicester City (ENG) v Club Brugge (BEL) English champions Leicester top Group G with 10 points and have yet to concede a goal. Conversely, Brugge are yet to notch up a single point. A draw for the hosts would mean they progress to the next stage with a game to spare. Domestically, the unlikely Premier League champions have struggled to reproduce the form that delivered the title to the King Power Stadium and sit just two points above the relegation zone after a 2-1 weekend defeat to Watford. Claudio Ranieri's men however, including Jamie Vardy and Riyad Mahrez, who are on the Ballon d'Or list, are a different proposition in their maiden Champions League campaign. It even looks as if Ranieri is prioritising Europe over the Premier League. At Copenhagen FC Copenhagen (DEN) v Porto (POR) Copenhagen bagged a 1-1 draw away to second-placed Porto in September and are fighting for Champions League survival in this game, in which a win for the Portuguese would see them qualify. But Porto are misfiring with only two wins in their past five outings in all competitions while Stale Solbakken's charges are unbeaten in their five games at home in Europe this season. Porto go into the clash with the depressing effect of having lost a penalty shoot-out to Chaves in the Portuguese Cup at the weekend, while the hosts powered to yet another win in the league. A win for the Danes would see them leap-frog their opponents in the group. Has the makings of a classic. <strong>Group H</strong> At Seville, Spain Sevilla (ESP) v Juventus (ITA) This is arguably the match of the round with Sevilla top on 10 points and visitors Juve second on eight with a tight 0-0 draw in Italy in the reverse fixture. Sevilla are flying high in Spain after they produced a stunning fightback from 2-0 down to win 3-2 at Deportivo la Coruna. Argentine coach Jorge Sampaoli's version of Sevilla is thrilling fans after transforming the Europa League champions into a free-thinking outfit. Italian champions Juventus go into the showdown on the back of a 3-0 Serie A win over Pescara. ""It's an important game for us because we have to win one of our last two games to go through,"" coach Massimiliano Allegri said. Juve may have to do it the hard way with several defenders carrying knocks, but the forward line of Mario Mandzukic and Gonzalo Higuain is a frightening prospect for Sevilla. At Zagreb Dinamo Zagreb (CRO) v Lyon (FRA) Dinamo cannot qualify for the next round after a miserable Champions League campaign that has seen them fail to earn a point or even score a goal in four matches. They still have the consolation of the Europa League just about alive, but must win this game for starters. Lyon, with four points from four games, are only slightly better off and need a victory in Zagreb and for Juventus to fail to win to live another day. Lyon are fourth in Ligue 1 in France and their form has picked up in domestic competition after a slow start. Bafetimbi Gomis -- now at rivals Marseille -- scored four, including an eight-minute hat-trick, when Lyon won 7-1 in Zagreb in the 2011/12 group stage."
178,01/11/2016,19:23,Lyon defiant ahead of Juventus challenge,Maxime Gonalons said sightseeing is off the menu when Lyon face Juventus in Turin looking to salvage their Champions League campaign on Wednesday.,"Lyon went down 1-0 at home to 10-man Juve two weeks ago after Alexandre Lacazette had a penalty saved by Gianluigi Buffon, with Juan Cuadrado scoring the winner for the visitors. The defeat left Bruno Genesio's men third in Group H, four points behind both Juve and Sevilla, and needing all three points on Wednesday to maintain a realistic chance of reaching the last 16. A Juventus victory, coupled with a Sevilla win over Dinamo Zagreb, would see the Italians and the Spaniards advance to the last 16, and leave Lyon battling with Dinamo for third place and a Europa League spot. Gonalons, however, was defiant at the same time as he labelled Buffon a ""monument"" ahead of what will be the veteran goalkeeper's 100th Champions League appearance. ""Buffon is a monument in Turin. In the home game he broke our hearts. He's class, and we have a lot of respect for him,"" Gonalons said. ""It's going to be difficult. They're top of Serie A and they're doing well in the Champions League, but we'll do everything we can to cause problems for Juventus."" Lyon have struggled this season but arrived in Italy fresh from a morale-boosting 2-1 win away at Toulouse at the weekend in Ligue 1. Gonalons added: ""We're not coming here as tourists, we've come to try and win this match. Football can throw up a few surprises, sometimes when you're the underdog you come up with a great performance just when you need it."" History is not on Lyon's side -- they have lost their last four games against Italian opponents and were beaten home and away when the sides met in the Europa League quarter-finals in 2014. Juventus, meanwhile, are unbeaten in their last 18 home matches in Europe but Genesio believes his side can cause the Italian champions problems. ""I don't see why we can't have the same game plan as we did against Toulouse,"" said Genesio. ""But I want to see improvements in terms of our technique, our passing and ball control. ""I have faith in my players. The home game (against Juventus) comforted us in the sense it showed us we can put them in danger. ""We lacked a few, important details in that game but tomorrow (Wednesday) we'll be going for it."""
179,18/10/2016,22:53,Cuadrado strikes as 10-man Juve sink Lyon,Juan Cuadrado came off the bench to score a late winner as 10-man Juventus beat Lyon 1-0 in France in Champions League Group H on Tuesday.,"The Italian champions saw Gianluigi Buffon save a first-half Alexandre Lacazette penalty and then had Mario Lemina sent off early in the second period. But substitute Cuadrado struck in the final quarter of an hour to stun the home fans at the Parc OL and leave the Serie A giants, Champions League runners-up in 2015, in a strong position in their section. They are level at the top of Group H on seven points along with Sevilla, who were 1-0 winners away to Dinamo Zagreb in Croatia, while Lyon sit four points back in third place. ""It's never easy to win away from home,"" said Juventus coach Massimiliano Allegri. ""I should thank Mario Lemina for his sending-off because I thought we played better with a man less,"" he added. ""What more do you want us to do,"" Lyon captain Maxime Gonalons told beIN Sports after the home side failed to find a way past an often inspired Buffon. ""We gave everything. It was a tactical battle. We had chances but Buffon was in great form. He was remarkable."" Juventus had never won in six previous visits to France in the competition but Allegri's side arrived on a run of five consecutive wins in all competitions. Opponents Lyon had the fit-again Lacazette leading their attack but selection worries in defence meant coach Bruno Genesio handed a start to the 19-year-old Mouctar Diakhaby at the back. Juventus, with former Lyon hero Miralem Pjanic in their midfield, were the dominant force in the early stages and Gonzalo Higuain fizzed a shot just over and then forced a fine save from Anthony Lopes. Lyon were struggling to get into the game but they won a penalty in the 34th minute when Leonardo Bonucci was penalised for wrestling Diakhaby to the floor at a corner. With France coach Didier Deschamps watching from the stands, Lacazette stepped up to take the spot-kick but his effort was saved by Buffon, diving down low to his left. Lopes then denied Higuain and Bonucci headed narrowly wide as the first period ended goalless, before Lyon emerged as more of a threat after the restart. Buffon, who had been guilty of conceding soft goals for Italy against Spain recently and in Juve's win over Udinese at the weekend, produced a great save from Nabil Fekir's deflected shot and also somehow kept out a Corentin Tolisso header from point-blank range. ""He doesn't need to be defended by anybody. He is quite simply different to the rest,"" Allegri said of his veteran goalkeeper. In between Buffon's saves, the visitors had been reduced to 10 men in the 54th minute when French midfielder Lemina was shown a second yellow card for a foul on Fekir, although he had appeared to take the ball. But Lyon could not make their man advantage count and Cuadrado, who had replaced Paulo Dybala midway through the second half, collected a Dani Alves pass before cutting in from the right and firing in a shot that took Lopes by surprise and flew in between the 'keeper and his near post."
180,05/08/2016,20:22,Lyon provide first test for new-look PSG,The post-Zlatan Ibrahimovic era officially begins for Paris Saint-Germain when they take on Lyon in the French Champions Trophy on Saturday in the unlikely surroundings of the Austrian city of Klagenfurt.,"PSG have undergone a summer of considerable change since securing a second consecutive clean sweep of France's domestic trophies in May, with Ibrahimovic leaving for Manchester United at the end of his contract. Coach Laurent Blanc was sacked, paying the price for failing to take Paris beyond the quarter-finals of the Champions League, with Unai Emery arriving from Sevilla as his replacement. Emery's new-look PSG, with new signings Hatem Ben Arfa, Grzegorz Krychowiak, Thomas Meunier and Giovanni Lo Celso, now attack their first competitive game after winning all four matches in pre-season. ""For us this is very important,"" said Emery, whose team begin their Ligue 1 title defence at Bastia next Friday. ""It is still a pre-season match but it is also a chance to win a first trophy."" PSG will be without Thiago Silva and Edinson Cavani, while Adrien Rabiot and Poland midfielder Krychowiak, who followed Emery from Sevilla, are suspended. ""Cavani has a little strain so it was better that he stayed in Paris,"" said Emery, who will choose between Ben Arfa and France under-19 striker Jean-Kevin Augustin in attack. Their European limitations ultimately cost Blanc his job, but PSG's dominance of the French game has been outrageous in recent seasons and this weekend they will be bidding to win the Champions Trophy for the fourth year running. The season curtain-raiser traditionally pits the champions against the French Cup holders, but just like last year, PSG will meet the Ligue 1 runners-up Lyon for the trophy. Twelve months ago the game was played in the Canadian city of Montreal and it has also been staged in China, Gabon, the United States, Morocco and Tunisia in recent years. The reasons for taking the match to these exotic venues appeared obvious, but the decision to go to Klagenfurt -- the 32,000-seat Woerthersee Stadion was rebuilt to host matches at Euro 2008 -- this time is rather harder to fathom. In fact, it was a conscious decision to remain in Europe despite offers from Asia and Australia, according to the French league's director of economic development. ""PSG had just come back from the United States so it would have been complicated to go to Asia or Oceania,"" admitted Mathieu Ficot. ""So instead we decided to go somewhere in Europe, where we hadn't previously been."" Unlike Paris, Lyon stayed in Europe for their pre-season, although they did find themselves in Istanbul for a planned friendly against Fenerbahce when Turkey was hit by a botched military coup. They have also seen defender Samuel Umtiti depart for Barcelona but have so far kept hold of midfielder Corentin Tolisso and star striker Alexandre Lacazette, the latter a target for PSG among others. Defensive trio Nicolas Nkoulou, Emanuel Mammana and Maciej Rybus have all arrived, although the latter two will not feature this weekend. ""There is a trophy up for grabs and also the chance to measure ourselves against this Paris side to see what we can do over the course of the season and if we can reduce the gap between us and PSG,"" said Lyon coach Bruno Genesio. Of the departure of Ibrahimovic, he added: ""It changes things a little bit because he scored a lot of goals but they have other great players. We will still be up against one of the best teams in Europe."""
181,26/07/2016,13:24,Lyon reject Arsenal bid for Lacazette,"French club Lyon said Tuesday they had rejected a 35-million-euro (£29 million, $39 million) bid from Arsenal for star striker Alexandre Lacazette.","Lyon called the 25-year-old, who has long been linked with a move to the Premier League having scored 48 goals over the last two seasons, ""irreplacable"" and said he would not be sold. In May, Lyon president Jean-Michel Aulas said the club had dismissed a 40-million-euro offer from West Ham United for the prolific French international."
182,12/07/2016,16:10,Barca complete deal for Lyon's Umtiti,"Barcelona have completed the signing of France defender Samuel Umtiti from Lyon in a deal worth 25 million euros ($27.7 million), the Spanish champions announced on Tuesday.","Umtiti, 22, will pen a five-year contract with Barcelona which includes a buy-out clause of 60 million euros, the club said in a statement. Barcelona president Josep Maria Bartomeu confirmed last month that the two clubs had reached an agreement over the transfer while Umtiti was on international duty for France at Euro 2016. The Cameroon-born centre-back made his France debut in the quarter-finals against Iceland and retained his place in the team for the next two matches, including Sunday's 1-0 defeat by Portugal in the final. Umtiti, who can also play at left-back, will be officially presented as a Barcelona player on Friday after undergoing a medical at the Camp Nou. He will compete for playing time with Gerard Pique, Javier Mascherano and France team-mate Jeremy Mathieu, whose injury prompted Didier Deschamps to call up Umtiti for the European Championship. Umtiti, an under-20 World Cup winner in 2013, becomes Barca's second signing of the summer after the Catalan giants exercised a buy-back clause to re-sign midfielder Denis Suarez from Villarreal last week."
183,08/04/2016,22:35,Cornet brace lifts Lyon into second,Lyon moved above Monaco and into second spot and automatic qualification for the Champions League with a 2-0 win at Montpellier on Friday.,"Maxwell Cornet's quickfire first half brace pushed the in-form former multiple champions onto 55 points, but in line for the ticket to the Champions League on goal difference. Monaco can regain second if they beat Lille on Sunday. This was Lyon's eighth win from their last 10 games, a run that has catapulted them back into contention for Europe's top club competition. Their fine run continued when Jordan Ferri set up Cornet for the 34th minute opener, with the striker following up from close range six minutes later after great work from Alexandre Lacazette. Aside from the three points Lyon will also have been relieved at the presence on the bench of Nabil Fekir. The France international missed seven months with a serious knee injury but returned to action with Lyon's reserve team last weekend. And the 22-year-old was introduced for Cornet with quarter of an hour to go for his first taste of Ligue 1 action since August 29. ""It's been seven months, it feels good to be back on the pitch,"" he said. ""I was waiting for him (coach Bruno Genesio) to call me up. We won, that's the main thing."" On his prospects of securing a place on Didier Deschamps' Euro 2016 France squad he added: ""Frankly, that would be a bonus. After an injury like mine it's complicated to comeback."" The loss left Montpellier hovering above the drop zone, four points from safety. On Sunday, Monaco face a taxing trip to Lille, who have undergone a remarkable turnaround under Frederic Antonetti and are gunning for a fifth win in a row. On Saturday, champions Paris Saint-Germain will use their visit to Guingamp to iron out the mistakes that plagued them in their 2-2 draw against Manchester City in the first leg of the Champions League quarter-final. Laurent Blanc's side have their hands full going into next week's return leg in England having drawn Wednesday's encounter 2-2 at the Parc des Princes."
184,19/03/2016,23:22,Lacazette on target in Lyon's late surge,Teenaged substitute Gaetan Perrin turned the tide as a late Lyon rally saw them climb to third in Ligue 1 with a 2-0 home win over Nantes on Saturday.,"While champions Paris Saint Germain celebrate their latest Ligue 1 title at home to second placed Monaco on Sunday, the race for the third Champions League spot is wide open. Lyon went into the game in fourth and had been regretting a series of spurned chances before the impressive Rachid Ghezzal dribbled round four Nantes defenders and lashed a shot at goal in the 83rd minute. The shot was deflected by a desperate defender, but Perrin, who had been on the pitch just two minutes, was in the right place to nod the ball home. Last season's Ligue 1 stand out striker Alexandre Lacazette then converted a penalty four minutes into stoppage time after he had been tripped in the area, delivering a deserved 2-0 win. The opener had come just as Nantes looked like they would emerge from the game with more than a point when a period of pressure saw Adrian Thomasson's shot from the edge of the area for Nantes fizz just wide. But Bruno Genesio's Lyon dug deep to suggest they might have what it takes for a late run for Europe. They never stopped working for the three points despite the disappointment of a series of near misses in the first half, culminating with a Ghezzal shot hitting the crossbar. Lyon have 49 points in third while Rennes, who hammered Marseille 5-2 away on Friday, have 48, Nice have 47 but play minnows Gazalec Sunday, while Caen have 46 after beating rock-bottom Troyes 2-1. A further place behind and after three defeats in four games, Saint Etienne got their push for Europe back on course with a late flurry of goals to win 3-0 at home to Montpellier. In another relegation struggle Guingamp climbed five points above the drop zone when they clinched a 1-0 win at Reims courtesy of their Senegalese striker Younousse Sankare's 26th minute shot. Morgan Amalfitano got his first goal of the season to hand mid-table Lille a 1-0 victory over second-bottom Toulouse Meanwhile, troubled Bordeaux play their first game under new interim coach Ulrich Rame when they entertain Bastia on Sunday."
185,06/03/2016,23:20,Five-star Lyon show Champions League credentials,Lyon continued their surge towards Champions League qualification on Sunday as Alexandre Lacazette netted twice in a 5-1 thrashing of Guingamp.,"Rachid Ghezzal and Maxwell Cornet were also on target for Lyon, while a Reynald Lemaitre own goal secured a handsome victory for Bruno Genesio's side, with Mevlut Erding getting Guingamp's reply. The result allowed OL to build on last weekend's impressive victory against champions-elect Paris Saint-Germain and made it five wins from their last six league games. With almost all of their rivals dropping points, Lyon end the weekend in third place and retain hope of catching Monaco, with six points separating them from the principality club in second. Lyon are determined to return to the Champions League next season after a disappointing showing in the group stage this campaign, and they are threatening to pull away from the chasing pack thanks to some impressive results at their new stadium. They had taken 13 points from a possible 15 at the Parc OL since its inauguration in January and they set about improving those statistics early on, Ghezzal opening the scoring with just three minutes played as he followed in to net after Cornet had hit the post. Erding got a touch to a Younousse Sankhare ball to bring Guingamp briefly back level before Lacazette restored Lyon's lead and Cornet made it 3-1 10 minutes prior to the interval, racing through to beat Jonas Lossl from an offside position after latching onto Ghezzal's pass. Lacazette converted a Ghezzal free-kick for his second and Lyon's fourth just after the hour mark and Lemaitre headed a corner into his own net late on to complete Guingamp's misery. Earlier, Marseille stretched their club record run of games without a league win at home to 12 when they were held 1-1 by Toulouse at the Stade Velodrome. Toulouse were playing their first game since Pascal Dupraz replaced Dominique Arribage as coach but the new boss was not at the game after being taken ill at training on Saturday and spending the night in hospital. Dupraz told Canal Plus that reports he had suffered a heart scare were not true and he would have been buoyed by the performance of his relegation-threatened side. Wissam Ben Yedder put them ahead with his 10th league goal of the campaign, but stuttering OM secured a draw when Steven Fletcher's shot was deflected in by Brazilian defender Somalia. ""We needed to win, one point was useless,"" complained Marseille's Spanish coach Michel. Marseille remain in the bottom half, while Rennes are fifth, level on points with Nice and just a point behind Lyon, after trouncing local rivals Nantes 4-1 thanks to a superb showing by teenage sensation Ousmane Dembele. The 18-year-old netted a first-half hat-trick, while Kamil Grosicki was also on target, and Rennes were comfortable winners despite having Giovanni Sio sent off in the second half. Adryan got a goal back for Nantes as they suffered a first league defeat in 14 games since November. ""Dembele gives me pleasure and satisfaction but his situation is also very delicate,"" said Rennes coach Rolland Courbis of a player who has drawn admiring glances from around Europe. ""To be just 18 and have all the offers he has in such a short space of time, I would need to be totally inexperienced and incompetent not to be wary,"" Courbis added after admitting he had almost left the starlet on the bench at kick-off. On Saturday, runaway leaders Paris Saint-Germain warmed up for their Champions League trip to Chelsea with a lifeless 0-0 home draw against Montpellier. However, they remain 23 points clear of Monaco at the top after the principality club could only draw 2-2 at Caen on Friday. If Monaco fail to win at home to Reims next Friday, PSG could secure the title by beating bottom side Troyes away next Sunday. Otherwise, Laurent Blanc's side will have the chance to wrap up a fourth straight title when they host Monaco on March 20."
186,04/03/2016,02:20,PSG focus on Chelsea ahead of Montpellier visit,Paris Saint-Germain head into Saturday's clash at home to a resurgent Montpellier with most eyes firmly fixated on next week's return leg at Chelsea in the last 16 of the Champions League.,"PSG rebounded from losing their 46-game unbeaten domestic run at Lyon last weekend by remaining on course to defend their French Cup crown after beating Saint-Etienne 3-1 in midweek. However, victory at the Stade Geoffroy-Guichard potentially came at a cost with midfielder Blaise Matuidi facing a race against time to be fit for Wednesday's trip to Stamford Bridge. The France international was seen clutching his hamstring after he was taken off ""as a precaution"" midway through the second half, with Laurent Blanc admitting he was ""worried"" about Matuidi's fitness. Blanc will have to decide whether or not to rest key players ahead of the Chelsea clash, with Marco Verratti (groin) and Angel Di Maria (thigh) also struggling with injuries. The PSG boss though was pleased with the manner in which the runaway Ligue 1 leaders responded at Saint-Etienne after suffering their first defeat of the season. ""We can't erase (the loss), but we can use it to our advantage. That's what we did (on Wednesday) and I'm very happy about it. It was a good way to respond after the defeat which provoked quite a buzz,"" said Blanc, in quotes published by French daily L'Equipe. ""Montpellier will be a difficult match because we'll be thinking about the game against Chelsea which will be huge,"" said PSG captain Thiago Silva, with 2012 French champions Montpellier arriving in the capital on the back of three straight wins to pull clear of relegation trouble. ""We're ready for Chelsea. I think everyone knows what awaits us over there. I hope (Matuidi) will be able to play because he's an important player for the team,"" the Brazilian added. Defeat at Lyon means Paris can't clinch a fourth straight French title this weekend, but they could do so next week should Monaco slip up at fellow European hopefuls Caen on Friday. Monaco have lost just once in 15 league outings and have an eight-point cushion over Caen, who trail third-place Lyon on goal difference, in the race for the second automatic Champions League qualifying berth. Four wins in five has reignited Lyon's campaign and Bruno Genesio's side will bid to build on recent momentum when Guingamp visit Parc OL in Sunday's late game. A four-match winless run has slowed Nice's European charge, but they will fancy their chances of ending that series at home to bottom side Troyes on Saturday. Rennes and Nantes, unbeaten in the league since November, meet in the Brittany derby with both sides also firmly in the hunt for Europe, while Saint-Etienne travel to slumping Angers. Pascal Dupraz will embark on the daunting task of trying to salvage Toulouse's top-flight status having replaced Dominique Arribage ahead of Sunday's trip to Marseille. Toulouse are 10 points from safety and without a win in eight, but there is hope as Marseille have struggled mightily at the Stade Velodrome with just two wins all season and none in their last 11 home fixtures.

187,01/03/2016,02:20,PSG looking to bounce back from Lyon loss in Cup,"Paris Saint-Germain will be desperate to get back on track after their shock 2-1 defeat at Lyon, when they face a trip to Saint Etienne for a French Cup quarter-final on Wednesday.","The capital city side suffered a first domestic defeat since March 2015 on Sunday, and know that it will not be easy away to Les Verts, who are well in the hunt for a Champions League place. PSG coach Laurent Blanc said that his men were ""too average"" in their loss at Parc OL, but it will be interesting to see if St Etienne try and mirror Lyon's tactics and play a high press against the cup holders. The Frenchman called on his team to rediscover the spirit that helped them go 36 league matches unbeaten. ""When I see the last ten minutes of the game, when we tried to come back and stay unbeaten, I can say that we were too average to do anything, even if it is Paris, even if it is my team,"" he said. ""The mentality and the aggression that enabled us to stay unbeaten for so long had gone, but it is possible that we can very quickly rediscover that spirit."" Blanc also has injury problems to worry about with the fixtures coming thick and fast. Marco Verratti is once again on the sidelines, while Angel Di Maria missed the Lyon loss after limping off against Reims the week before. With the second leg of the Champions League, last 16 tie against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge to come on March 9, it is unlikely that Blanc will risk either Verratti or Di Maria for the match at the Stade Geoffroy-Guichard. PSG have won the Coupe de France on nine occasions, second only to arch rivals Marseille who have ten, while the last of St Etienne's six cup successes came back in 1977. Marseille will be hoping to extend their record haul this season, as they face a last eight encounter with fifth-tier Granville on Thursday night. It is a dream tie for the Lower Normandy club, who continue the rich tradition of lower league success in the competition, they are the fifth team from the fifth division to reach the quarter-finals since 1999. The amateur side's Stade Louis Dior is not big enough to host such a match, though, and the game will be played at Ligue 1 club Caen's Stade Michel d'Ornano. This decision has drawn heavy criticism from Monaco, who play at Caen in the league on Friday. The principality outfit, who sit second in the top-flight, are worried about the state of the pitch when they play there. ""AS Monaco wish to express their displeasure following the scheduling of the quarter-final of the Coupe de France between Granville and Marseille,"" the club said in a statement. ""We cannot understand it, as the pitch at Stade d'Ornano already appeared in poor condition in the last game against Rennes."" Nantes, whose 0-0 draw with Monaco on Sunday means they have gone 16 outings without defeat, go to second-tier Sochaux on Wednesday. Sochaux have already claimed the top-flight scalps of Bastia and Monaco in previous rounds. The other quarter-final is an all-Ligue 1 clash between Lorient and Gazelec Ajaccio, with Gazelec having had a few extra days rest after their weekend league match with Marseille was postponed due to a waterlogged pitch.

188,28/02/2016,23:57,PSG's record unbeaten run ended by Lyon,Lyon stunned Paris Saint-Germain 2-1 on Sunday to end the defending champions' hopes of becoming the first French team to avoid defeat for a whole league season.,"Young forward Maxwell Cornet stroked Bruno Genesio's men into a surprise early lead and Lyon deservedly made it two through Sergi Darder's wonderfully-taken goal on the stroke of half-time. Lucas Moura pulled one back for the runaway league leaders, but Lyon held on for a famous victory that moves them into the top three. For PSG this was a first league loss since a 3-2 defeat at Bordeaux in March 2015, although they remain 23 points clear of Monaco at the top of the table. Manager Laurent Blanc admitted that his side were off the pace and did not deserve to take anything from the game. ""We were too average, myself included,"" he told Canal+. ""Lyon were in a better state of mind. Were we not at our best? I don't know, we must regroup."" ""We expected a difficult game, but not as hard. I took off a player at half-time (Benjamin Stambouli), I could have made more changes,"" he admitted. Lyon manager Genesio wants his team's display to help them kick on for the rest of the campaign. ""The game counts for three points, but of course beating PSG makes it more satisfying,"" he said. ""What pleased me? The way we implented the plan, with the will to press them high. Certainly, we were up against one of the best teams in Europe, but we need to repeat this performance until the end of the season."" PSG were looking to extend their record unbeaten league streak to 37 matches, but Lyon started the stronger at Parc OL and they forged ahead in the 13th minute. Alexandre Lacazette picked out 19-year-old Cornet, who displayed good footwork to cut inside Gregory van der Wiel, before curling confidently into the far corner to grab his third Ligue 1 goal. The visitors are not used to being behind and their frustration boiled over when Thiago Motta appeared to strike Jordan Ferri in the face, with the Italian fortunate to escape with just a yellow card. On the day that Silva spoke of suffering a bout of depression in the aftermath of Brazil's World Cup thrashing at the hands of Germany two years ago, he was embarrassed by Darder in first half injury-time. Despite Rafael's cross being slightly behind Darder, the Spanish midfielder flicked the ball over the head of centre-back Silva with his first touch, and coolly steered home past Kevin Trapp with his second. With the unbeaten run close to coming to an end Blanc responded by sending on Javier Pastore for Benjamin Stambouli at the interval. The substitute was instrumental in creating space in the Lyon penalty area as the away side pulled one back less than six minutes into the second period. Pastore was crowded out by a group of home defenders, but the ball broke kindly for Brazilian Lucas, who bent his shot just inside the far post. Lyon went straight up the other end and could have restored their two-goal cushion, only for Ferri to side-foot wide. It was by far the busiest outing for Trapp since his move to Paris last summer and the German made an excellent point-blank save with his legs to keep out Rachid Ghezzal. But last season's runners-up closed out a fourth win in five games with ease to move into the third and final Champions League place and become the first team to beat PSG domestically in almost a year. Monaco were held to a goalless draw by in-form Nantes as Caen reignited their unlikely Champions League push with a 2-1 win at Saint-Etienne. Monaco are eight points clear in second but the six teams directly below are separated by just two points in the race for third place. Meanwhile, Marseille's match away to Gazelec Ajaccio was postponed due to the inclement weather in Corsica."
189,26/02/2016,01:45,Lyon-PSG clash highlights gulf in France,Paris Saint-Germain can provide further proof of the growing gulf in class between the champions elect and the rest of Ligue 1 when they travel to last year's runners-up Lyon on Sunday.,"A fourth straight French league crown is well within sight for PSG, who could conceivably wrap up the championship next weekend, while Lyon's turbulent campaign has rendered last year's title challenge a distant memory. Laurent Blanc's runaway leaders are unbeaten in 36 matches in Ligue 1 dating back to last March, whereas Lyon have suffered 10 defeats -- three more than all of last season -- and find themselves embroiled in a congested scrap for Europe. PSG have beaten Lyon three times already this term, a crushing 5-1 win at the Parc des Princes in December was followed up by further triumphs in both domestic cup competitions, but OL will hope to maintain an unbeaten record in their new 60,000-seater fortress. Since moving into the Parc OL in January, Bruno Genesio's side have registered three wins out of four at home, with their lone dropped points coming in a 1-1 draw with Marseille. However, last Sunday's 1-0 defeat at Lille not only snapped a run of three successive victories but also left Lyon without midfielder Clement Grenier and former PSG defender Christophe Jallet for this weekend's clash after the pair were sent off to compound a miserable evening up north. ""We had the chance to go third and not only did we fail to do that, we also lost two players who will be suspended against Paris so we're paying a heavy price,"" said Genesio, whose side trail PSG by a staggering 34 points. ""That handicaps us even more against Paris, when that was the last thing we needed."" Monaco can take another stride towards claiming the second automatic Champions League berth when they travel to Nantes. Leonardo Jardim's side are eight points clear of Nice and Saint-Etienne, but will face an in-form Nantes outfit unbeaten in 15 matches in all competitions. ""We're very happy. There are still 11 games to go, and we have to hold on to second place,"" Monaco vice-president Vadim Vasilyev told RMC radio. ""The most important thing is always the league table. The goal is to be in the Champions League next season, it's vital."" Bastia fans will be banned from Friday's trip to third-place Nice after recent violence, which prompted last weekend's game at home to Nantes to be postponed. Fourth-place Saint-Etienne are at home to Caen on Sunday, while Marseille, with just two wins in 11 league outings, visit a Gazelec Ajaccio side chasing a first win in nine.

190,21/02/2016,23:08,Nine-man Lyon slump to defeat at Lille,"Nine-man Lyon missed the chance to move into the third and final Champions League place in France as they lost 1-0 at Lille on Sunday, while Michy Batshuayi rescued a 1-1 draw for Marseille against Saint-Etienne.","Sofiane Boufal scored the only goal of the game at Lille in the 28th minute, as a desperately poor Lyon saw their run of three consecutive wins come to an end. After Saint-Etienne's draw, Lyon knew three points would move them into the coveted third place, but they failed to take their chance. Boufal has been the only stand-out performer in a lifeless Lille attack this season, and he opened the scoring at the Stade Pierre-Mauroy with his eighth goal this term. His free-kick from the left wing evaded everyone in the middle, including a leaden-footed Lyon goalkeeper Anthony Lopes, as it bounced into the net. After scoring 10 goals in a run of three comprehensive victories, Bruno Genesio's Lyon would have been confident going into this encounter. But they created very little in a drab first half display and shortly after the restart they were lucky to see Lille striker Yassine Benzia drag a shot hopelessly wide when in on goal. On the hour mark any fading hopes the visitors had of moving into the Champions League spots were all but ended, when right-back Christophe Jallet saw a second yellow card for holding back Eric Bautheac. Lille have the second-worst attack in the division but the second-best defence, so perhaps it was no surprise that Lyon struggled to create chances. A miserable outing for Lyon was ended as Clement Grenier's elbow into the face of Florent Balmont left them with only nine men. At the Velodrome OM's Belgian forward Batshuayi had come off the bench 15 minutes from the end and headed home a Romain Alessandrini free-kick in the fifth minute of injury-time. That was a 13th league goal of the season for Batshuayi, putting him behind only Zlatan Ibrahimovic in the Ligue 1 goalscoring charts. It was only five minutes from time that St Etienne thought they had scored the potentially winning goal that would have sent them above Nice into third place in Ligue 1. Kevin Monnet-Paquet shot home left-footed from Romain Hamouma's pass. ""Nothing we saw was new -- we created chances, we were close to scoring, we got back into the match just like against Lille (a 1-1 draw), we fought to the end and there was a lot of courage,"" said Marseille coach Michel. The draw barely helps either side as St Etienne stay behind Nice on goal difference, while Marseille are 10th and still five points behind in the tight race to qualify for Europe's premier club competition. Asked if he feared for his job, Michel said: ""I don't think about that, never. I think about doing my job and going forwards."" Caen ended a three-match losing streak, as a first goal in French football for Burundian midfielder Saidi Ntibazonkiza saw off Rennes. The 28-year-old has broken into the first team in recent weeks and took his chance with a fine second half finish, moving Caen above their opponents and to within two points of the top three. For Rennes though the pressure continues to build, they are now lower in the table than they were a month ago when they sacked former manager Philippe Montanier and brought in Rolland Courbis. There was one positive for Courbis as midfielder Yoann Gourcuff made his first start since rejoining the club in the summer, being withdrawn in the 59th minute. On Saturday, Paris Saint-Germain maintained their 24-point lead with a 4-1 victory over lowly Reims as Ibrahimovic scored a brace. They now need only three more wins and a draw from their final 11 matches to win the Ligue 1 title. Monaco remain second after a 3-1 win over rock-bottom Troyes sent them eight points clear of Nice, who drew 0-0 at Bordeaux on Friday."
191,19/02/2016,02:20,Reims out to inflict European hangover on PSG,"Unbeaten runaway leaders Paris Saint-Germain return to Ligue 1 duty against struggling Reims on Saturday, four days after earning a narrow first-leg advantage over Chelsea in the Champions League last 16.","Edinson Cavani made an immediate impact as a substitute on Tuesday by netting a 78th-minute winner at the Parc des Princes after John Obi Mikel had cancelled out Zlatan Ibrahimovic's deflected free-kick to hand Laurent Blanc's side a 2-1 edge. The Uruguayan has started just twice in the league in 2016 after losing his place as a regular starter, but Cavani could well return to the line-up with Blanc preparing to rotate his side this weekend. Reims are one of the few teams to frustrate PSG this season, with the capital club needing another late goal from Cavani to rescue a point in a 1-1 draw back in September. ""Even if it's PSG, a big European team, we're not going there as victims. We always want to show what we're capable of doing against the big teams,"" said Reims defender Abdelhamid El Kaoutari. ""I think (the outcome) will depend on what Paris have to offer. If it's the PSG from Tuesday (against Chelsea), there are few teams who can stand up to them,"" added Reims coach Olivier Guegan, whose side enter the weekend two points above the drop zone. Paris on the other hand are unbeaten in 35 league games and cruising towards a fourth straight French title, with a mammoth 24-point gap separating themselves and nearest challengers Monaco, who are at home to bottom side Troyes this weekend. Lyon were in crisis mode less than a month ago, but three convincing wins in a row have propelled Bruno Genesio's side right back into contention for a top-three finish. OL travel to Lille on Sunday with the visitors trailing third-place Nice and bitter rivals Saint-Etienne by just a point in the race for France's final Champions League berth. ""It's the start of a run we have to continue with a couple of difficult matches coming up. We have to keep on working with the same spirit,"" said Genesio in the wake of last weekend's 4-1 demolition of Caen. Lyon will be without influential midfielder Corentin Tolisso for several weeks after he hurt his hamstring in training, but there was a welcome sight as Nabil Fekir, out since September with a knee injury, stepped up his road to recovery in midweek. Saint-Etienne secured a 3-2 victory at home to Basel in the last 32 of the Europa League on Thursday having thrown away a two-goal lead, with Christophe Galtier's men facing a quick turnaround as they head to Marseille this weekend. Early-season surprise packages Angers and Caen will bid to turn around their fading fortunes at home to Montpellier and Rennes respectively, with both sides losers of their last three matches. Toulouse, currently eight points from safety, can ill-afford another defeat as they risk being cut further adrift when they take on 18th-placed Gazelec Ajaccio. Meanwhile, Bastia's match at home to in-form Nantes, planned for Saturday, has been postponed following violent clashes between fans and police in Corsica.

192,14/02/2016,17:01,Lyon win again to boost top three hopes,"Lyon recorded their third successive big win in Ligue 1 on Sunday, thumping Caen 4-1 to further boost their hopes of snatching Champions League qualification from a frustrating season.","Samuel Umtiti, Alexandre Lacazette, Maxwell Cornet and Corentin Tolisso all scored for OL with Andy Delort replying for Caen as Lyon bounced back from their 3-0 defeat at Paris Saint-Germain in the French Cup during the week. Bruno Genesio's side had won 3-0 against both Bordeaux and Angers in their previous two league outings and this latest success moves them up to third in the table, although both Nice and Saint-Etienne can leapfrog them when they play later against Marseille and Monaco respectively. Umtiti opened the scoring with 10 minutes played following a Mathieu Valbuena set-piece and Lacazette netted his 10th league goal of the season to double the lead six minutes later. Young forward Cornet slotted home the third on the stroke of half-time and Tolisso's deflected strike sealed the points late on after Delort had pulled a goal back with his ninth of the campaign just before the hour mark. On Saturday, runaway leaders Paris Saint-Germain extended their record-breaking unbeaten league run to 35 matches but they had to settle for a point in a 0-0 draw at home to Lille in their final outing before facing Chelsea in the Champions League on Tuesday. PSG coach Laurent Blanc rested the likes of Zlatan Ibrahimovic, Thiago Silva, Thiago Motta and Maxwell, while Edinson Cavani missed their best chance, somehow blasting off target with the goal gaping after Lille keeper Vincent Enyeama dropped a cross. The capital club are an enormous 25 points clear but Monaco can trim that lead slightly when they visit Saint-Etienne later. Among Saturday's other games, Nantes beat Lorient 2-1 to make it 15 games unbeaten between league and cup. The Canaries are now sixth and right in contention for European qualification."
193,12/02/2016,14:57,Valbuena sex-tape blackmail suspects released from custody,"Three of the suspects charged in the Mathieu Valbuena sex-tape blackmail affair involving France striker Karim Benzema have been released from custody, the public prosecutor in Versailles, near Paris, said on Friday.","Axel Angot and Younes Houass were released from prison on Wednesday while Mustapha Zouaoui was released on Friday. The three have been released as French law prevents suspects being held in pre-trial detention for longer than four months. A fourth man charged in the affair, Karim Zenati, a boyhood friend of Benzema, remains in custody, the prosecutor confirmed. Benzema, who has been charged with complicity to blackmail and conspiring to commit a criminal act involving the sex tape featuring Valbuena, is still not allowed to come into contact with his international colleague and has been excluded from the France set-up pending the outcome of the criminal investigation. The affair has rocked the France squad ahead of Euro 2016, which the country will host, and the chances of Real Madrid star Benzema being able to return to the side in time for the finals still appear slim. Angot and Zouaoui, both from Marseille, along with Houass, are suspected of using the presence of the sex tape to try to extort money from Valbuena. Benzema approached Lyon playmaker Valbuena about the tape at a national team training camp in October and was charged by police on November 5. His coach at Madrid, fellow Frenchman Zinedine Zidane, admitted on Friday that he was ""tired"" of the affair. ""I am tired of the Benzema affair, as is Karim. It would be good if this all ended as soon as possible,"" said Zidane at a press conference ahead of Saturday's home game against Athletic Bilbao in La Liga. ""He wants to focus purely on football and I think that soon we will be able to forget all about this. I hope so."""
194,09/02/2016,17:03,Clubs must compromise on ticket prices says Lyon president,"Lyon president Jean Michel Aulas predicted Tuesday that market logic would prevail in the Premier League ticket price rift because full stadiums make exciting football, which in turn makes exciting and lucrative television.","""In football one of the fundamental elements is the presence inside the stadium of a certain amount of spectators,"" Aulas said, when asked his views on the £77 ($112, 99 euros) it will cost for the most expensive match ticket at Liverpool next season. At Anfield on Saturday over 10,000 Liverpool supporters left Anfield in the 77th minute (to relate to the £77 ticket) of the 2-2 draw with Sunderland in protest at the hike in price. Club great Jamie Carragher joined in and was pictured on social media posing with a fan outside the ground. Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp says the club's owners are keen to resolve the row. ""What I know is everyone in the club has a big interest in finding a solution for this,"" he said on Monday. ""It is not what we want, we don't want the people leaving the stadium before the game is finished."" Former Newcastle United striker Alan Shearer used his role on the BBC's flagship 'Match of the Day' programme to condemn clubs for raising prices. For Aulas, club owners need to listen to rumblings of discontent from the terraces. ""When the price is right something happens when you get a full stadium, and that makes for better television and more television revenue,"" explained Aulas, who was attending a two day European Club Association ECA meeting in Paris. ""A balance has to be found. And if there is this reaction today from supporters groups obviously the club directors will realise it."" Aulas said he felt that there was so much money in England because clubs had invested, but that without the famously enthusiastic English fans they might see a turn around in affairs. ""They are lucky to have such massive television revenues,"" he said. ""Much higher ones that in other countries. However that's because they have invested in that. In the game, on stadiums, on the atmosphere and fans have a great deal to do with that atmosphere so clubs will realise it's in their interests to find the right balance."" At the same meeting AC Milan director Umberto Gandini also expressed admiration for the Premier League and its colossal revenue, but pointed a finger at the competitive roll commercial revenues had on certain clubs. ""It's an amazing league and has consistently high revenues. If you look how revenues are distributed at English clubs it's a situation of real equality,"" he said. ""Sponsorships and commercial revenues however are what makes the difference, it makes a difference to some clubs who want to compete but don't have maybe the same level of sponsoring. Sky and BT Sport's blockbuster £5.14 billion domestic TV rights deal kicks in at the start of next season, with the sale of overseas rights -- expected to be confirmed in the coming weeks -- set to swell that figure to £8 billion (10.2 billion euros and 11.5 billion dollars) for the period 2016-2019. English top-flight clubs broke new ground by shelling out £870 million on new talent in the 2015 close-season transfer window -- a rise of four percent on the previous record, established the previous summer."
195,06/02/2016,19:20,"Monaco get Champions League boost, Lyon frustrate Angers",Monaco's hopes of Champions League football next season got a boost with a 1-0 win over Nice on Saturday as Lyon rekindled their European challenge by beating Angers 3-0.,"On a stormy, tense day in Ligue 1, seven players were red-carded in seven games. The Riveria derby clash between the second and third placed teams failed to ignite Monaco's Stade Louis II before midfielder Tiemoue Bakayoko struck after 81 minutes. A long free-kick off the boot of Portuguese midfielder Moutinho found Bakayoko who slotted in after the ball had bounced in front of Nice goalkeeper Yoan Cardinale. The win allows Monaco, second behind runaway leaders Paris Saint-Germain, to move six points clear of Nice, who remain third, two points ahead of Angers with Lyon moving up to fifth a further point back. Monaco's Moroccan midfielder Nabil Dirar was sent off after he vigorously disputed a call by referee Tony Chapron, as Angers were also playing a man down following a 16th minute red card for Thomas Mangani. ""The players showed that apart from PSG, there is no team better than us. We know each other well, we know how to play at 10 and showed this,"" said Monaco coach Leonardo Jardim. ""The players had a great match."" ""Paradoxically, the sending off seemed to do them good,"" said Nice coach Claude Puel. ""If they continue to be successful like that they can even envisage catching Paris,"" added Puel of Monaco who trail Paris Saint-Germain by 21 points. The reigning three-time champions will be looking to extend their Ligue 1 unbeaten streak at bitter rivals Marseille on Sunday. Lyon secured back-to-back league wins for the first time since November and gave new coach Bruno Genesio a first league victory away from home. Last season's runners-up took an early lead through Christophe Jallet, and the hosts fell two behind when winger Rachid Ghezzal picked out the roof of the net just after half-time. Corentin Tolisso wrapped up the scoring late on as Lyon moved to within three points of the Champions League places. ""It is satisfying to have a second consecutive victory and what was important is the way we found confidence as a team,"" Genesio said. ""I am not sure that it was a better performance than in the defeat at Saint Etienne or the draw with Marseille, but with our first real chance we got the opening goal and that is always so important now in Ligue 1."" With eight of the bottom nine teams in action in the five late Saturday kick-offs it was unsurprisingly a tense evening of football. Montpellier blew a great chance to haul themselves out of the bottom three as they were held to a 1-1 draw by ten-man Lorient. Francois Bellugou was given a straight red card, and Kevin Berigaud took advantage to give Frederic Hantz's Montpellier a half-time lead. But Jimmy Cabot scored his first goal for Lorient since joining from Troyes last month to snatch a point. Reims made the most of Montpellier's slip-up as they saw off Caen 2-0. Goals from Thievy Bifouma and Prince Oniangue helped take Olivier Guegan's Reims three points clear of the relegation zone. Bastia picked up a much-needed victory by easing past bottom club Troyes 2-0 despite having a man sent off for the fifth time in five league games. Goalkeeper Jean Louis Leca's red card was sandwiched by a Floyd Ayite brace for the Corsicans, as visiting Troyes were reduced to nine men in a feisty encounter. Gazelec Ajaccio are now winless in six league games and just a point above the drop zone after playing out a goalless draw with fellow strugglers Guingamp, who had Lionel Mathis kick off the pattern of the night with his 10th minute dismissal. Meanwhile, a 0-0 stalemate with Nantes leaves Toulouse second-from-bottom and six points from safety."

For Lyon, who exited the League Cup in midweek following a 2-1 defeat at holders Paris Saint-Germain, this latest loss simply yielded another disappointment in a season full of setbacks. Both sides had entered Sunday's clash level on 29 points and looking to keep in touch with the European places, and it was Lyon who largely bossed the first half. On-loan striker Jean-Christophe Bahebeck tried to catch out Lyon goalkeeper Anthony Lopes with an early free-kick, but the visitors were on top after that as Stephane Ruffier twice thwarted Rachid Ghezzal, the second stop a stunning low save just before the break. Ruffier then palmed away a Clement Grenier free-kick after half-time, before the crossbar came to Saint-Etienne's rescue as Ghezzal's cross was diverted towards his own goal by Kevin Theophile-Catherine. But it was the hosts who made the breakthrough on 76 minutes when a stray pass from Corentin Tolisso was pounced upon by Kevin Monnet-Paquet, who slipped in Soderlund for the Norwegian to notch his first goal for his new club. Earlier, Marseille snapped a four-match winless run in the league as they claimed a fifth victory in six away games. Marseille arrived at the Stade Michel d'Ornano unbeaten in seven league matches, although they had drawn their last four outings, and grabbed a 12th-minute lead when goal-line technology was used to determine that Michy Batshuayi's shot had crossed the line after coming back off the post. Batshuayi should have added a second with the goal at his mercy a few minutes later, but the Belgian atoned for that miss by setting up Georges-Kevin Nkoudou to steer in Marseille's second on the hour. Ronny Rodelin pulled one back for the hosts after beating Steve Mandanda to a free-kick, but Bouna Sarr erased any hopes of a comeback as he volleyed home Alaixys Romao's inviting cross on 83 minutes. The victory pushed Marseille up to eighth, five points adrift of third-place Angers, with Caen dropping to seventh. Monaco moved back into second place in the table after winning 2-0 at Lorient to stretch their unbeaten run in the league to eight games. Thomas Lemar gave Monaco a 53rd-minute lead in Brittany before Joao Moutinho curled home an exquisite free-kick to leave Leonardo Jardim's men 21 points behind runaway leaders Paris Saint-Germain. PSG recorded their ninth consecutive win in all competitions and extended their club record unbeaten league run to 30 matches dating back to last March as Zlatan Ibrahimovic's 73rd-minute strike was enough for them to see off Toulouse 1-0 on Saturday."
197,15/01/2016,02:10,Saint-Etienne to test improved Lyon in derby,"Boosted by a recent upturn in performances, Lyon face bitter rivals Saint-Etienne on Sunday in the most passionate derby in France with both teams looking to keep in touch with the European places.","Lyon's disastrous first half to the season led to coach Hubert Fournier being sacked with former assistant Bruno Genesio appointed as his replacement, and Genesio oversaw a 4-1 win against bottom club Troyes last weekend as OL opened their impressive new stadium. That result allowed Lyon to climb back into the top six, and they make the short trip to the Stade Geoffroy-Guichard above Les Verts on goal difference, with just four points separating them from Monaco in the third and final Champions League qualifying berth. Lyon lost in midweek, going down 2-1 away to Paris Saint-Germain in the League Cup quarter-finals, but Genesio was happy with the display from a much-changed side. ""I always said that I had confidence in my team,"" he insisted. ""We need to be lucid about what we are capable of doing, but we need to be capable of repeating that performance."" Lyon's best performance this season came when they trounced Saint-Etienne 3-0 at home in November with Alexandre Lacazette scoring a hat-trick. Christophe Galtier's side have finished in the top five in each of the last three campaigns but their prospects of doing so again this year have been undermined by nine defeats already this season, including a 2-1 loss at Nantes last weekend. ""This league is dangerous and there might be a lot of surprises. I hope we will quickly get to 42 points and finish the season well,"" said Galtier in the wake of the Nantes setback as he admitted the first aim had to be guaranteeing survival in a tight division. Galtier has moved to strengthen his squad this month with the arrival of Norway striker Alexander Soderlund from Rosenborg being followed by that this week of Moroccan-born winger Oussama Tannane from Dutch side Heracles. Tannane serves a suspension this weekend and skipper Loic Perrin is still injured for the home side, while Lyon captain Maxime Gonalons is out but Mathieu Valbuena could return. Runaway leaders Paris Saint-Germain are a huge 20 points clear of second-placed Angers before going to Toulouse on Saturday. It will be the first of three meetings between the clubs in 11 days as they will clash at the Parc des Princes in the French Cup next Tuesday and then again in the League Cup semi-finals at the end of the month. Laurent Blanc's side have not lost any of their last 36 domestic outings, a run stretching back 10 months. Toulouse, meanwhile, are in the relegation zone but they have lost just one of their last nine games. ""To play three matches against PSG is nice. We need to be prepared. Every players wants to test himself against the best and this gives us the chance,"" said Toulouse skipper Jean-Daniel Akpa-Akpro. Angers go to Nice on Friday, while Caen host inconsistent Marseille and third-placed Monaco visit Lorient on Sunday on a run of just one defeat in their last 14 league matches. The principality club this week moved to strengthen their mis-firing attack by signing 20-times capped Brazil forward Vagner Love from Corinthians, although he is not expected to make his debut just yet. ""I am here to help the team as best I can and lend them my experience. Monaco are a big European club. My wife loved the idea of coming. I treat her like a princess. Our little princess will be born here,"" said Love, clearly delighted at returning to Europe. Fixtures (kick-offs 1900 GMT unless stated)"
198,11/01/2016,14:31,Blanc wary of Lyon focus in League Cup quarters,Runaway league leaders Paris Saint Germain take on Lyon in the pick of the French League Cup quarter-finals in midweek with coach Laurent Blanc warning of a highly focussed opponent.,"With a clean sweep of domestic trophies last season Paris Saint Germain top League 1 by a massive twenty points, so can afford to focus on the League Cup themselves, which they have won in the last two seasons. Saint-Etienne handed PSG their last defeat in this tournament, overcoming the Parisians 5-3 on penalties in the 2012-13 quarter-finals, but PSG saw off the Greens 1-0 in the last round. ""You have to work hard in January, the weather conditions may not be great,"" coach Blanc warned after their latest outing, a 2-0 league win over Bastia. ""There are heavy legs in January but we have big goals for February, March, April and May,"" said Blanc, whose side are also targeting the Champions League and face Chelsea in the last-16. Lyon are fourth and inaugurated their new 59,000-seater stadium with a 4-1 victory over bottom side Troyes on Saturday, snapping a six-game winless run in the league. Lyon's stand-in coach Bruno Genesio applauded the style of play and said the players were as keen as he was to deliver results. Blanc is tipped to rotate his team and rest 1 top scorer Zlatan Ibrahimovic and instead play mercurial Javier Pastore alongside Edinson Cavani, whose late goal was enough to beat Saint Etienne in the last round of the League Cup. Bordeaux are undefeated in their last five league outings and thrashed Monaco 3-0 in the last round as they travel to Lorient on Tuesday night in search of the first semi-final spot. Marseille travel to relegation threatened Toulouse and an away tie may suit their coach Michel who had to sit through chants of ""Bielsa! Bielsa!"" at the weekend as his injury depleted outfit drew 0-0 at home to Guingamp. But Michel has overseen 11 straight games without defeat and while Marseille may be mid-table they are also in the running for the French Cup too. Second bottom outfit Guingamp take on resurgent Lille, who are on a roll and undefeated in their last five league games since Frederic Antonetti took over from Herve Renard as coach.

However, Lyon went back in front courtesy of a fine Rachid Ghezzal strike on 72 minutes before Jordan Ferri and Claudio Beauvue added late goals to clinch a first league win for OL in two months. ""I'm happy with the result and at the style at certain times,"" said Lyon coach Bruno Genesio. ""The atmosphere was magnificent. It was impressive and full of emotion and I think the players really appreciated it. It's our job now to deliver the results expected of us."" Lyon had limped into the winter break after picking up just one point from six matches, with Genesio stepping up from his backroom role to take over from Hubert Fournier. They climbed up to sixth following Saturday's victory, while Troyes did little to dispel the likelihood of an immediate return to the second tier, having yet to win 20 matches into the season. Lyon romped to a 7-0 win over fifth-tier Limoges in the French Cup last weekend to rebuild some confidence, and the hosts went ahead again as Lacazette held off a defender before steering past Paul Bernardoni for his seventh goal of the season. But Troyes, who had recorded three straight draws in the league, pulled level on 67 minutes when Camus fired a swerving long-range shot past Anthony Lopes. However, Lyon regained the lead five minutes later as Ghezzal swivelled inside the area and struck a sweet left-footed effort beyond Bernardoni. Ferri then thumped home a third goal on 81 minutes after an inviting lay-off from Clement Grenier with Beauvue heading in a fourth in stoppage time. On Friday, Paris Saint-Germain extended their lead at the top to a staggering 22 points as Thiago Motta and Maxwell were on target in a 2-0 home win over Bastia. Second-placed Monaco host Gazelec Ajaccio later on Saturday, while Angers, in third, are at home to fourth-placed Caen."

PSG coach Laurent Blanc rested several key players including Angel di Maria, Edinson Cavani and Thiago Silva, but still fielded a strong team with the likes of Ibrahimovic, Verratti, Blaise Matuidi and Thiago Motta. ""Getting back into competition is always the hardest part, even more so with the tricky weather conditions,"" said Blanc after PSG's first competitive game following France's short winter break. ""We would have liked to have played better to wrap things up earlier and make things easier but we weren't capable of doing that this afternoon. ""The most important thing is to move on and we've done that."" Elsewhere, Lyon made a promising start under new coach Bruno Genesio as Maxwell Cornet and Rachid Ghezzal scored twice apiece with Claudio Beauvue, Sergi Darder and Corentin Tolisso also on target in a 7-0 hammering of fifth-division Limoges. Monaco hit double digits with a crushing 10-2 defeat of seventh-tier Saint-Jean-Beaulieu in a local derby as Lacina Traore scored four first-half goals before he was sent off for a half-time altercation. Saint-Etienne were given a scare by Raon-l'Etape as the Ligue 1 side were taken to penalties following a 1-1 draw, eventually prevailing 4-3 in a shootout against their fifth-tier opponents. Bordeaux came from behind to beat third-tier Frejus Saint-Raphael 3-2 with Diego Rolan grabbing a 90th-minute winner for the visitors after Cheick Diabate had twice levelled for Willy Sagnol's side. Montpellier, who saw Pascal Baills and Bruno Martini take joint control of the first team after the resignation of Rolland Courbis last month, edged past fifth-division Epernay 1-0 courtesy of a second-half goal from Mustapha Yatabare. Benjamin Jeannot scored an extra-time winner for Lorient as they overcame Ligue 2 outfit Tours 3-2, while Lille scraped past Amiens AC 1-0 with Guingamp comfortable 4-0 winners at Chantilly."
201,13/12/2015,23:07,Five-star PSG punish Lyon to extend enormous lead,Zlatan Ibrahimovic took his tally to 14 goals in his last 11 Ligue 1 games as Paris Saint-Germain outclassed Lyon 5-1 on a gloomy Sunday night in the French capital.,"Ibrahimovic and Serge Aurier both netted in the first 17 minutes for Laurent Blanc's side before a shocking error by goalkeeper Kevin Trapp allowed Jordan Ferri to pull one back for Lyon. However, Edinson Cavani restored PSG's two-goal advantage after the restart and Ibrahimovic got his second of the night from a penalty. Substitute Lucas added the fifth in stoppage time as PSG moved a scarcely credible 17 points clear of their nearest challengers Angers and Monaco with the campaign just 18 games old. PSG are now unbeaten in 27 Ligue 1 games, a run going back to March, and remain on course to break the record for the most points halfway through a French season. The great Lyon team of the last decade had 50 points at the mid-way stage in 2006/07, but Paris already have 48 points and so can set a new mark with a victory at Caen in their last game of the year. This was a meeting of the reigning champions and the team that pushed them the furthest in the title race last season, but Lyon are a shadow of their old selves and were deprived of a host of key players at the Parc des Princes, including the injured Alexandre Lacazette. Visiting goalkeeper Anthony Lopes had already saved from Ibrahimovic and Cavani before the Swede opened the scoring 11 minutes in when Mapou Yanga-Mbiwa, rather than clear, headed Thiago Silva's long ball into his path. Six minutes after that Paris struck again, Aurier gratefully heading in from close range after a brilliant dead-ball delivery from the left by Angel Di Maria. Lyon were given hope when Ferri let fly from almost 30 yards and Trapp, attempting to tip the shot over, only succeeded in helping the ball into the net. The German was ironically cheered by the home fans whenever he got the ball after that and the goal did lift the away side. Nevertheless, there was a gulf in class between the teams and PSG scored again just after the hour mark, Cavani turning in another Di Maria cross to score for the 10th time in Ligue 1 this season. Ibrahimovic then struck again inside the final quarter of an hour, beating Lopes from the spot to score for the 14th time in his last 11 appearances after going down under a Henri Bedimo challenge in the box. The fifth goal came on the break in stoppage time, Di Maria again with the assist and Lucas, always so effective coming off the bench, with the finish. Lyon are sixth in the table and have now gone five Ligue 1 games without a win as the pressure on coach Hubert Fournier refuses to subside. Angers came from behind to draw 1-1 with Bordeaux as Romain Thomas cancelled out the opener from Diego Rolan, and they are ahead of Monaco only on goal difference. The principality club moved into the top three for the first time since the opening weekend of the season as a late Fabinho penalty gave them a 1-0 win against Saint-Etienne, who had Kevin Malcuit sent off. ""It was a positive match. We controlled the opposition and they didn't have many chances,"" said Monaco coach Leonardo Jardim. Meanwhile, Marseille are now seven home league games without a win after a 1-1 draw with Gazelec Ajaccio at the Stade Velodrome. Jacques Zoua put the Corsicans in front from the penalty spot but Michy Batshuayi equalised before half-time with his 11th league goal of the season before OM had Abdelaziz Barrada sent off."
202,10/12/2015,01:50,Neville seeks fresh Valencia after poor start,Valencia boss Gary Neville believes his side suffered from their exertions in holding Barcelona at the weekend as they crashed out of the Champions League with a 2-0 home defeat to Lyon on Wednesday.,"The Spanish side needed to win and hope Gent dropped points at home to Zenit St Petersburg to qualify for the last 16, but they were stunned by an already eliminated Lyon side, who picked up their first European win of the season thanks to goals either side of half-time by Maxwel Cornet and Alexandre Lacazette. Neville watched on the from the stands as a depleted Valencia battled back to seal a point against the European champions on Saturday thanks to Santi Mina's late equaliser. However, they didn't reach the same heights in Neville's debut as a head coach as Lyon's pace tore the hosts apart on the counter-attack. ""When you have 10 injuries and the same players play every three days, particularly these type of games -- Sevilla, Barca, tonight versus Lyon -- you get a deterioration of sharpness,"" he said. ""One or two percent goes each time. I know from my own playing career that to have the same level of energy every three days is difficult. ""The effort against Barca was immense, out of this world, but today that same level of sharpness was just missing. It's not a fitness problem but a concern. We need to get players back and more freshness into the squad. ""We must take the defeat on the chin and realise it is unacceptable to lose at Mestalla. It's not something we can take lightly."" The outcome could have been very different had Shkodran Mustafi's early headed goal not been controversially ruled out, but Neville accepted his side had been second best rather than point the finger at Slovenian referee Matej Jug. ""I've not seen the Mustafi goal yet, but players thought it was not a foul,"" he added. ""I can sit here and say if that counts, of course it is a different game. We can sit back and then counter. They scored first, which was important, it allowed them to counter on us rather than vice-versa. ""From that point of view, I used to whinge a lot as a player, but I wont blame refs as a manager unless I feel I have to and tonight I don't have to as Lyon did well in the game, so I won't create headlines about the ref."" A third-place finish in Group H means Valencia drop into the Europa League, just as Manchester United did 24 hours earlier. Neville won 20 trophies with United over a 19-year playing career, but insisted a reunion with the Red Devils was the furthest thing from his mind ahead of his first La Liga game in charge away to Eibar on Sunday. ""We will take the competition seriously number one. Who we draw, and whether we play Man Utd, is the last thing on my mind at moment. ""I'm thinking about recovering for Sunday's league game. At this moment I couldn't care whether we play Man Utd or someone else in the Europa League. I have to think of tomorrow, the next day, and preparing players for Sunday."""
203,09/12/2015,22:51,Lyon consign Neville to nightmare Valencia start,Gary Neville endured the worst possible start to his managerial career as Valencia crashed out of the Champions League due to a 2-0 home defeat to the already eliminated Lyon on Wednesday.,"Goals either side of half-time by Maxwel Cornet on his first Champions League start and Alexandre Lacazette handed the French side their first European win of the season. Belgian champions Gent beat Zenit St Petersburg 2-1 to seal their place in the last 16 behind the Russians in Group H. England coach Neville was set for a baptism of fire after his surprise appointment last week with Valencia needing to win and Gent to drop points to seal their place in the last 16 for the first time in three years. The former Manchester United defender made just two changes from the side that held European champions Barcelona to a 1-1 on Saturday with Joao Cancelo returning from suspension and Shkodran Mustafi fit again to take his place at the heart of the defence. And Mustafi was desperately unlucky not to get Neville off to a flying start inside 10 minutes as he thundered a header off the post and was then penalised for a foul when he did find the net from Valencia's next corner. Lyon were already eliminated from all European competitions and hadn't won any of their last five games in all tournaments. However, the visitors produced an impressive display and Valencia had to count on goalkeeper Jaume Domenech to keep them in the game. Domenech's first fine save came on 11 minutes when he turned Cornet's effort to safety as the 19-year-old bore down on goal. Valencia started the evening without eight first team players through injury and they suffered another setback when Argentina international Enzo Perez hobbled off to be replaced by Javi Fuego. Domenech had to come to Valencia's rescue twice more in quick succession as he denied Corentin Tolisso and Rafael da Silva. At the other end, Lyon 'keeper Anthony Lopes showed he was just as capable of pulling off a big save as he flew to his left to parry Paco Alcacer's header. However, Lyon were handed the half-time lead they deserved by Cornet's stunning solo effort nine minutes before the break as he cut inside before firing into the top corner via a slight deflection off Aymen Abdennour. Neville made a bold move at the start of the second period by throwing on Alvaro Negredo for his first appearance in over two months in place of the more defensively minded Danilo. Yet, despite the home fans roaring on their side with encouragement after Zenit briefly restored parity against Gent, it was Lyon who again posed the greater threat after the break on the counter-attack. Lacazette blasted over from close range before he played in Sergi Darder with a wonderfully timed pass, but the former Malaga midfielder was denied by another fine stop from Domenech. There was nothing the Valencia stopper could do 15 minutes from time, though, as Lacazette was released in behind the defence and the French international sprinted beyond Abdennour before slotting home his second Champions League goal of the season."

205,05/12/2015,19:25,Lyon beaten in final league game at Gerland,Lyon lurched further into crisis on Saturday as they went down 2-0 to Angers to ruin what was their last ever Ligue 1 match at the Stade de Gerland.,"Cheikh N'Doye scored both goals for the visitors from headers either side of half-time as the promoted club built on a goalless draw at home to Paris Saint-Germain in midweek to continue their remarkable season. But Lyon have now taken just one point from their last four league games and, coupled with their limp exit from the Champions League, that form has left coach Hubert Fournier under huge pressure. OL president Jean-Michel Aulas has not been shy to express his displeasure with recent performances and this latest display was particularly painful as it came on such a special occasion for the club. ""Our recent performances have been catastrophic and even today there was not much of a reaction. That is the most worrying and frightening thing,"" Mathieu Valbuena told Canal Plus. ""The players are 100 percent responsible. The coach tries to put out the best team possible. It is easy to blame him."" After 65 years at the Stade de Gerland, Lyon will move into a new 59,000-capacity stadium in January and a host of former players were invited to take to the field before kick-off in what was their final Ligue 1 outing at the old ground. Brazilian duo Sonny Anderson and Juninho Pernambucano, who played as the club won an unprecedented seven consecutive titles in the last decade, were among those present and watched the game alongside the Lyon ultras massed behind the goal. But the match itself was further proof that all is not well at last season's runners-up. Fournier pushed Valbuena right up front alongside Alexandre Lacazette and handed a top-flight debut to teenager Lucas Tousart in midfield, and yet the changes could not prevent another defeat. Angers took the lead from their first chance just before the midway point in the first half, N'Doye rising high above Bakary Kone to head in a Thomas Mangani free-kick. N'Doye then flashed another header just wide from a Gilles Sunu set-piece delivery and Anthony Lopes saved from Sunu to keep Lyon in the game going into the interval. There was a response from the hosts after the restart and Valbuena crashed a shot off the bar before substitute Clement Grenier set up Lacazette to put the ball in the net only for the offside flag to cut short the celebrations. But it was to be N'Doye who had the honour of scoring the last Ligue 1 goal at the old stadium as he made sure of the win for Angers with his and his side's second nine minutes from the end. The 29-year-old Senegalese midfielder, who had never played in the top flight before this season, has been a revelation captaining the unfancied Angers. At 1.92m tall and 90kg, he is a monster of a player, and yet he was left unchallenged to head in a corner from the left as Angers moved provisionally into second place. Lyon, who will play one last game at Gerland in the League Cup later this month, are fourth but are likely to tumble down the table over the course of the weekend. PSG are 15 points clear of Angers after continuing their unbeaten start to the domestic season with a 3-0 win at Nice on Friday. Edinson Cavani put the capital club ahead before Zlatan Ibrahimovic netted twice, including one from the penalty spot, to become PSG's all-time leading scorer in the top flight with 87 goals. Caen can reclaim second place with a win at home to Lille later on Saturday, while Monaco can go fourth with a win at Bastia."
206,04/12/2015,17:58,Lyon ready for final league game at Gerland,Lyon have invited 120 former players to help bid farewell to the Stade de Gerland which hosts its last ever Ligue 1 match on Saturday.,"The seven-time French champions, who are due to move into a new 59,000-seat stadium in the suburbs of the city in January, will play their final game at their old home against Tours in the League Cup on December 16. But before that they will welcome Angers to the Stade de Gerland for one last league game at the ground on Saturday and some of their former greats, including members of the teams that won seven straight titles in the last decade, will be in attendance. Inaugurated in 1926 and Lyon's home since 1950, the 41,000-capacity Gerland was revamped for the 1984 European Championship and again for the 1998 World Cup. It has also staged matches at the Rugby World Cup in 2007 and Tour de France stage finishes seven times in the days when it featured a cycling track. After OL leave, the stadium will live on as home to the local rugby club, who are in the French second tier. The first game scheduled for Lyon's new ground will be against Troyes on January 9. It will stage six games at Euro 2016, including a semi-final. New grounds built for Euro 2016 have opened over the last three years in Bordeaux, Lille and Nice, while existing stadiums in Marseille, Saint-Etienne, Lens and Toulouse have been refurbished."
207,04/12/2015,15:14,Lyon bid farewell to Gerland stadium,"Lyon have invited 120 former players to help bid farewell to their Gerland Stadium, which hosts its last ever Ligue 1 match on Saturday.","Built in 1913 by architect Tony Garnier and revamped for the 1984 European Championships and the 1998 World Cup, the 41,000 capacity Gerland will host its last game on December 16 in the League Cup. The ultra-modern 59,000 capacity new stadium in the Lyon suburbs will take the name of a yet to be revealed sponsor and is scheduled to host six Euro-2016 games. Another French Ligue 1 outfit Bordeaux will also switch to a brand new stadium ahead of 2016. Lyon have been resident at the Gerland since the club was formed in 1950 playing their first game there August 27 that year when 3,000 people turned up to see a 3-0 win over CA Paris in the second division. On top of hosting Euro-84 and World Cup 1998 matches it also hosted Tour de France stages seven times in the days when it featured a cycling track. There were 2007 Rugby World Cup games, and concerts from David Bowie, the Rolling Stones, Michael Jackson and a host of others. Pope John Paul II even hosted a mass there before 50,000 people October 5, 1986. After Lyon leave, the stadium will live on as home to Lyon Rugby club, who are in the French second flight and well-placed for promotion to the Top-14. Italian side Juventus moved to a new stadium in 2011, England's Arsenal moved in 2006, and Germans Bayern Munich switched in 2005."

Laurent Blanc's men are 13 points clear with a trip to promoted Angers awaiting them next as the first of six fixtures in a busy 19-day stretch leading up to Christmas. ""To be autumn champions with four matches still to play this year is good, but our goal is to be champions come the end of the season,"" said Blanc after Saturday's thumping win extended their unbeaten league run to 24 matches. ""We can pick up even more points between now and the winter break, and I hope we collect a maximum,"" he added. Another goal for Zlatan Ibrahimovic would see him surpass Mustapha Dahleb's club-record 85 goals in Ligue 1, with the Swede having drawn level with the mark over the weekend. Operating on a meagre 24-million-euro budget, the second smallest in the French top flight, Angers are punching well above their weight in their first season back in Ligue 1 since 1994. Angers are third in the table, two points behind Caen, despite going four matches without a win prior to Saturday's 2-0 defeat of struggling Lille. Fourth-placed Lyon will aim to rebound from a miserable past week which saw the former seven-time French champions bundled out of the Champions League group stage in between chastening defeats to Nice and Montpellier. ""We know we're going through a difficult patch,"" said midfielder Clement Grenier, who made his return after four months out in Friday's 4-2 home loss against resurgent Montpellier. ""We have to stay together and we are going to get back on our feet just like we've done before,"" he added, ahead of Lyon's trip to mid-table Nantes. Monaco remain well within sight of the European places despite twice squandering a lead in Sunday's pulsating 3-3 draw at Marseille. On Wednesday, Leonardo Jardim's men host Caen, fresh off a 4-1 demolition of slumping Bordeaux, at the Stade Louis II with a chance to join their opponents in the top three. Saint-Etienne followed up their qualification for the Europa League knockout phase with a resounding 3-0 home win over Guingamp to banish memories of back-to-back league defeats. Les Verts head to Lille next in what will be Frederic Antonetti's first home game in charge after the northerners dropped into the relegation zone following Saturday's reverse at Angers. Marseille round out the midweek action away to Rennes where Michel's men will seek a fourth consecutive win on their travels. Fixtures (kick-offs 1800 GMT unless stated):"
209,27/11/2015,22:42,Lyon in crisis after crushing defeat,Lyon completed a miserable week by slumping to a third straight defeat as they were thumped 4-2 at home by a resurgent Montpellier in Ligue 1 on Friday.,"Unheralded Chadian striker Casimir Ninga was the hero for Montpellier with a brace in between a Maxime Gonalons own goal and a Souleymane Camara strike for the visitors, who ran riot against shambolic Lyon defending at the Stade de Gerland. Alexandre Lacazette and Rachid Ghezzal netted for the home side, but this was a worrying performance from Hubert Fournier's team, who were lucky not to lose by a much wider margin. Soundly beaten 3-0 at Nice a week ago, last season's Ligue 1 runners-up were sent packing from the Champions League with a 2-1 home loss to Gent on Tuesday, and this was their fourth loss in five outings in November. Lyon remain in second place for now, but are 13 points behind leaders Paris Saint-Germain and the five sides below them are all within three points so they risk plummeting down the table by Sunday evening. ""We had a difficult European campaign in which we made too many errors and now an early goal from my mistake put us in trouble,"" captain Gonalons told beIN Sports. ""We just need to keep working. Without a great performance by Antho (Lopes) we would have lost much more heavily. ""We are a big club and everything the people who were here before us built we must not throw away. We need to be men, not behave like boys."" The contrast with the good times of last season, when OL hammered Montpellier 5-1 home and away, were stark at a Gerland where both ends of the ground were left empty as a punishment for trouble after the recent derby win against Saint-Etienne and loud jeers rung out from the reduced crowd at full-time. After a dreadful start to the campaign, 2012 champions Montpellier were looking to extend a five-game unbeaten run in the league and score a third consecutive victory. They took an early lead when Gonalons turned a low Jerome Roussillon cross into his own net and Ninga doubled their advantage in the 11th minute, holding off Rafael before slotting past Anthony Lopes. Lyon quickly got back into the game as Lacazette nodded in after a Claudio Beauvue effort had been blocked on the line. However, Montpellier looked like scoring every team they broke into the home half and Lopes had to come to Lyon's rescue on more than one occasion before the interval, notably to save from Ninga. Nevertheless, Montpellier did score again within three minutes of the restart thanks to more horrendous defending. Rafael's short backpass put Roussillon through, and while Lopes saved at his feet, Ninga was on hand to convert the follow-up. It was a third goal in French football for Ninga, the 22-year-old striker from Chad who was playing in Gabon last season. Clement Grenier made his first appearance of the season after injury for Lyon when he replaced Mathieu Valbuena on the hour, but Montpellier continued to make chances and substitute Camara got a fourth goal when he finished after his initial effort had been saved. Ghezzal pulled another goal back from a free-kick for the hosts but that was scant consolation. PSG are at home to winless bottom club Troyes on Saturday while Nice have the chance to leapfrog Lyon into second when they go to Toulouse. The standout fixture of the weekend sees Marseille host Monaco on Sunday evening."
210,26/11/2015,02:30,Hurting Lyon redirect energy on home affairs,Lyon face Montpellier in Ligue 1 on Friday badly in need of a quick fix after being bundled out of the Champions League by Gent in midweek.,"The Belgian visitors' 2-1 win in the last European game to be played at the Stade de Gerland put an end to Lyon's hopes of reaching the last 16 in what has been a miserable continental campaign. The seven-time French champions are bottom of Champions League Group H with just one point from five games and now cannot even claim the consolation of a place in the Europa League in the new year. Hubert Fournier's team are in a better position domestically, but while they come into the weekend in second in Ligue 1 they are 13 points behind runaway leaders Paris Saint-Germain and just three points ahead of Saint-Etienne in seventh. OL were beaten 3-0 at Nice last weekend and followed that up with another loss against the Belgians despite Jordan Ferri giving them an early lead. Danijel Milicevic levelled with a free-kick before Kalifa Coulibaly's last-gasp winner which led to sports daily L'Equipe leading with the headline 'Pathetic' on Wednesday morning. Nevertheless, on the premise that every cloud has a silver lining, Lyon president Jean-Michel Aulas suggested the premature ending of their European journey may not be a bad thing. ""It's perhaps a question of no pain, no gain. We are now going to focus all our energy on qualifying directly for the Champions League like we did last season,"" he said. But he cautioned: ""We're in a good position but we know that all that can be quite fragile. We must regroup now in Ligue 1. ""So this (Champions League exit) is a plus in terms of us tackling the league but a negative for our image because what's happened is way below our ambitions."" Captain Maxime Gonalons, suspended against Gent, makes his return but right-back Christophe Jallet is injured and Samuel Umtiti has been struggling with a thigh injury. Montpellier turn up in decent enough spirits with last weekend's 3-1 defeat of Reims lifting them one point clear of the relegation zone. After a dreadful start to the season, they have won three and drawn two of their last five matches to climb the table. On Saturday, PSG's home match against bottom side Troyes will be their first appearance at the Parc des Princes since the attacks on November 13 that left 130 people dead and hundreds injured in Paris."
211,22/11/2015,12:50,Ghent fans banned from Champions League tie at Lyon,Supporters of Belgian club Ghent have been banned from travelling to Tuesday's Champions League tie at Lyon as a result of the aftermath from the terrorist attacks that killed 130 people in Paris on November 13.,"The Interior Minister announced in a statement that the main reason for depriving Belgian fans from attending the match at the Stade Gerland was that police forces were too stretched at the moment as they attend to protecting national security. Belgium is also on full alert against a terrorist attack after one of the men involved in the horror attacks, that struck the French capital, reportedly fled to Brussels. ""The attacks on November 13 have lifted the security alert to the highest level against the threat of terrorism and security forces cannnot be diverted by this priority to deal with issues relating to the behaviour of supporters,"" read the statement. There is also a history of violence between the two club's supporters which has forced the Ministry to ban fans from travelling from Monday at 1200 local time (1100GMT) until midnight (2300GMT) on Tuesday. Fans from the two clubs clashed during the first group match on September 16 in Belgium and more trouble was expected for Tuesday's return tie. Football violence is not uncommon in Lyon and there was serious trouble on January 22, 2013, when Tottenham Hotspur fans came under attack in the city centre during a Europa League match, as well as incidents during matches against Marseille, Lens and Valenciennes. Away fans were also banned from travelling to Ligue 1 and Ligue 2 matches this weekend which was again due to the increasing demands being put on French security forces across the country."
212,20/11/2015,22:41,Nice beat Lyon as Ligue 1 resumes after Paris attacks,"Nice beat second-placed Lyon 3-0 as Ligue 1 resumed on Friday as scheduled, a week on from the Paris terror attacks that left 130 people dead and more than 350 injured.","Valere Germain and Vincent Koziello struck either side of a Mapou Yanga-Mbiwa own goal on an emotional evening at the Allianz Riviera as tributes were paid to the victims of last week's attacks in the French capital. A moving rendition of the French national anthem, 'La Marseillaise', was played before kick-off and was followed by a minute's silence, during which fans held aloft candles. A Nice supporters group had urged fans to come dressed in black to honour victims of last Friday's attacks, while players wore black armbands as a traditional mark of respect. Sports Minister Thierry Braillard, along with French football officials, had taken the decision on Tuesday to allow Ligue 1 and Ligue 2 matches to go ahead under heavy security, but without away fans. League president Frederic Thiriez said security forces across the country were too stretched to allow fans to travel. Mathieu Valbuena was named in the Lyon team just hours after giving evidence in the sex tape blackmail affair in which his France colleague Karim Benzema has been charged. Valbuena, who was seen leaving a Versailles court, on the outskirts on Paris, at around 12:45pm local time (1145 GMT) then travelled to the Cote d'Azur, almost 1,000 kilometres away, on a private jet laid on by the club. Lyon should have taken an early lead when Claudio Beauvue was left unmarked 10 yards out, only for the striker to blaze over the crossbar. The visitors, unbeaten on their last five trips to Nice, went even closer on the quarter hour as last year's leading scorer Alexandre Lacazette fired against the base of the post. Having initially rode their luck early Nice made the breakthrough 20 minutes in as Valere Germain gathered Jean-Michael Seri's pass and glided into the box before lifting a superb dinked finish over Lyon goalkeeper Anthony Lopes for his sixth goal of the season. The hosts stretched their lead three minutes after half-time when Lyon defender Mapou Yanga-Mbiwa inexplicably diverted Jeremy Pied's low cross into his own net. Twenty-year-old Vincent Koziello rounded off the victory on 71 minutes with a thumping finish into the roof of the net as Nice climbed to third in the table, just a point behind Lyon. Reigning champions Paris Saint-Germain travel to Lorient on Saturday with a chance to further increase their healthy 10-point cushion at the top."
213,20/11/2015,19:44,Valbuena lines up for Lyon after hearing in sex tape probe,Mathieu Valbuena was named in the Lyon team to play Nice in Ligue 1 on Friday just hours after giving evidence in the sex tape blackmail affair in which his France colleague Karim Benzema has been charged.,"Valbuena gave evidence before a judge investigating the affair for more than two hours in Versailles, on the outskirts of Paris, on Friday morning. He was seen by an AFP journalist leaving the court in a black Mercedes at around 12:45pm local time (1145 GMT) following a hearing that began around 10:30am. The 31-year-old then travelled to the Cote d'Azur, almost 1,000 kilometres away, on a private jet laid on by Lyon. ""He was very calm and answered all questions honestly,"" Valbuena's lawyer Didier Domat said outside the court. The lawyer refused to discuss what had been said during the hearing because of the ""confidentiality of the investigation"". However, Domat added that Valbuena ""had no wish to damage the integrity of the French national team or of French football"" and had only acted ""within his right as a citizen"" in pressing charges. He was expected to be questioned by judge Nathalie Boutard about a conversation he had with Benzema on October 5 at the France national training centre in Clairefontaine, outside Paris. The inquiry will seek to determine whether the 27-year-old Real Madrid striker Benzema acted as a friend or a blackmailer during the conversation. A source close to the investigation has said Benzema has admitted approaching Valbuena about the tape on behalf of a ""childhood friend"", Karim Zenati, who himself had been contacted by blackmailers in possession of the tape. But Benzema's lawyer said the player was innocent and ""has admitted nothing at all"". Investigators have recordings of a telephone conversation on October 6 with Zenati during which Benzema tells his friend about his conversation with Valbuena the previous day. ""I did have a conversation with Zenati on the way to approach the subject with Mathieu Valbuena ... but without a second thought,"" Benzema told investigators. ""That Karim Zenati benefited from it wasn't my aim, I didn't think about it, I'm frankly shocked, I feel stupid when I see that."" Both players were left out of the France squad for the recent friendly matches against Germany -- which was disrupted by suicide attackers outside the Stade de France last Friday -- and the game against England at Wembley on Tuesday. The blackmail case began in June, when Valbuena lodged a complaint with police after being telephoned by an unknown person who said he had the sex tape in his possession. Lyon's game at Nice is the first to be played in France's top flight since last week's devastating terror attacks in Paris that have left 130 people dead and hundreds more injured."
214,20/11/2015,12:27,Valbuena appears before judge in sex tape probe,"Mathieu Valbuena, the victim of a sex tape blackmail attempt, over which fellow France international Karim Benzema has been charged, appeared before a judge investigating the affair on Friday, judicial sources confirmed.","The hearing began around 0930 GMT on Friday morning in a court in Versailles, on the outskirts of Paris, hours before Valbuena was due to play for his French club Lyon against Nice. Judge Nathalie Boutard will question the 31-year-old player notably concerning a conversation he had with Benzema on October 5 at the France national training centre in Clairefontaine, outside Paris. The enquiry will bid to determine whether 27-year-old Real Madrid striker Benzema acted as a friend or a blackmailer during the conversation.

215,13/11/2015,19:27,Benzema 'admitted he was sex tape case go-between',"Real Madrid striker Karim Benzema admitted to investigators he was supposed to act as an intermediary between a friend and his French international teammate Mathieu Valbuena in a sex tape blackmail case, sources told AFP on Friday.","Benzema also told police he felt ""stupid"" when confronted with the evidence, said one source close to a case that has cast a shadow over the national team as France prepares to host Euro 2016 next year. The centre-forward has been charged over the case in which Valbuena went to the police after being approached for money by men claiming to be in possession of a sex tape featuring the Lyon midfielder. Benzema had initially denied any involvement following his arrest on November 5, but in a third session of questioning he began to open up. He eventually admitted he was only trying to help Karim Zenati, a childhood friend from Lyon where the player grew up, who already had a criminal record. ""I feel embarrassed towards my friend Karim Zenati because when he came out of prison and even when he was inside, I looked after him. We're very close,"" Benzema said, according to the sources. He added: ""I was supposed to act as the go-between and develop a relationship between Mathieu (Valbuena) and Karim Zenati."" Police then produced the recording of a conversation between Benzema and Zenati, in which the footballer related -- using a mocking tone -- his conversation with Valbuena at the French national training base in Clairefontaine on October 5. After hearing the tape, Benzema admitted: ""I did have a conversation with Zenati, about how to bring up the subject with Mathieu Valbuena. ""It was not my aim that Karim Zenati benefited from this, I didn't think about that. I'm shocked. Honestly, I look stupid when I see all that,"" he said. But he was not prepared to abandon his friend. ""Zenati is a serious person and someone I have confidence in,"" Benzema told police, the sources said. Benzema's lawyer Alain Jakubowicz told AFP the conversation with police showed that his client ""had no malicious intent"". Neither Benzema nor Valbuena were selected for the squad for France's friendly against Germany on Friday, nor for the game against England on Tuesday. Real Madrid president Florentino Perez has pledged his ""full support"" for Benzema."
216,08/11/2015,23:38,Lacazette leads Lyon to derby victory,Alexandre Lacazette returned to form in style with a hat-trick as Lyon beat bitter rivals Saint-Etienne 3-0 in the last derby meeting of the teams at the Stade de Gerland on Sunday.,"Last season's Ligue 1 player of the year Lacazette opened the scoring in the first half and added two more after the break on his 150th top-flight appearance as Lyon, who will move to a new 59,000-seat stadium early in 2016, claimed the bragging rights in the Rhone-Alpes rivalry. The victory, Lyon's third in a row in Ligue 1, allows Hubert Fournier's side to go clear in second place, although they remain 10 points adrift of unbeaten league leaders Paris Saint-Germain and also lost captain Maxime Gonalons and centre-back Samuel Umtiti to injury. Saint-Etienne, meanwhile, are fifth, behind Angers on goal difference, after a disappointing display. Lyon, who are staring at an early exit from the Champions League following a 2-0 home loss to Zenit St Petersburg in midweek, were unlucky not to get the breakthrough late in the first half when Stephane Ruffier made a double save to deny Jordan Ferri and Mathieu Valbuena. Valbuena was included in the Lyon line-up at the end of a week overshadowed by the arrest of his France colleague Karim Benzema, who was charged with complicity to blackmail and conspiring to commit a criminal act in an extortion case involving a sex tape featuring the little playmaker. He put in a lively performance but Lacazette stole the show, opening the scoring four minutes before the break when he spun away from Loic Perrin and then lifted the ball over Ruffier. Lacazette collected a Valbuena pass and worked his way into a shooting position before stabbing wide early in the second half, but he did find the net again in the 59th minute. Ruffier saved from a Rafael piledriver but Lacazette followed in to convert the rebound, and he completed his hat-trick in stoppage time when he latched on to Ferri's pass before rounding Ruffier to slot home. Scorer of a club record 27 league goals last season, he now has six goals in all competitions in this campaign and his performance was a timely reminder to France coach Didier Deschamps, who left him out of the latest national squad. ""I felt that Alexandre Lacazette was coming good in the last few days. And a hat-trick in a derby -- that does not happen all the time,"" said Fournier who was also happy to have selected Valbuena. ""Despite what has happened to him, he is happiest on the football pitch. He had already been punished enough by not being selected for the national team."" Meanwhile, Bordeaux came from behind to beat Monaco 3-1, inflicting a first defeat in 10 games on the principality side. Portuguese forward Helder Costa put the visitors ahead at the Matmut Atlantique, but Nicolas Maurice-Belay, Cedric Yambere and former Monaco midfielder Jaroslav Plasil all netted for Bordeaux. Monaco are ninth, while Bordeaux move up to 11th, above Marseille, who were beaten 1-0 at home by Mediterranean rivals Nice earlier on Sunday. Valere Germain, who was born in Marseille when his father Bruno was playing for OM and supported the club as a boy, got the only goal of the game in the 16th minute, collecting a Wallyson Mallmann pass and drilling in a low shot from range that beat Steve Mandanda and found the bottom-left corner. It was a welcome win for Nice, who were recently inspired to a fine run of form by the brilliance of Hatem Ben Arfa but made the trip along France's south coast after failing to win any of their previous three Ligue 1 outings. Claude Puel's side move up to sixth, but there was more frustration for Marseille, who have never really got going under Spanish coach Michel. After three straight wins in all competitions, this setback leaves OM in 13th place, only three points above the relegation zone. ""I am more disappointed than worried,"" said Michel, who had to make do without the injured Romain Alessandrini and the suspended Lassana Diarra, Remy Cabella and Nicolas Nkoulou. ""I don't think it was the absences that made the difference today."" PSG continued their unbeaten start to the season by thumping hapless Toulouse 5-0 on Saturday at the Parc des Princes. Zlatan Ibrahimovic scored twice, and now has nine goals in his last six Ligue 1 appearances."
217,20/10/2015,22:54,Zenit in sight of last 16 after Lyon win,Zenit St Petersburg edged closer towards a place in the last 16 of the Champions League on Tuesday after a 3-1 home victory over Lyon in Group H.,"Artem Dzyuba continued his impressive goalscoring form as he put Zenit ahead after just three minutes at the Stadion Petrovskiy. Lyon pulled level shortly after half-time through Alexandre Lacazette but Hulk drilled home a trademark long-range strike to restore the lead for Zenit. Danny then ended any hopes of a Lyon comeback on 83 minutes as Andre Villas-Boas' men registered a third win in as many attempts to strengthen their position at the top of the group. Zenit are three points clear of second-placed Valencia who beat Gent 2-1 in the night's other game to leave both defeated sides, Lyon and Gent, on one point apiece with their European dreams fading fast. Lyon were caught cold on a chilly night in St Petersburg as the hosts secured an early breakthrough when Oleg Shatov played in Dzyuba to coolly steer beyond Lyon goalkeeper Anthony Lopes for his sixth goal in his last seven appearances for club and country. Mapou Yanga-Mbiwa stung the palms of Zenit 'keeper Mikhail Kerzhakov with a snap volley but the home side should have increased their lead when Hulk found Dzyuba in acres of space inside the box, only for the Russia striker to slip as he pulled the trigger. Having conceded possession for the Zenit opener, it was from right-back Christophe Jallet's low cross that Lyon restored parity as Lacazette cleverly flicked the ball past Kerzhakov four minutes into the second half. However, Lyon were made to pay a heavy price seven minutes later after Hulk shrugged off a couple of challenges before taking aim from distance and beating Lopes with a vicious swerving effort. Dzyuba wasted a chance to add to his tally after prodding wide on 67 minutes but Zenit skipper Danny ensured the Russians achieved a hat-trick of wins to start a group stage campaign for the first time as Shatov raced clear before squaring for the Portuguese to tap in."
218,16/10/2015,22:38,Rafael rescues draw for Lyon at ten-man Monaco,Former Manchester United defender Rafael salvaged a 1-1 draw with an 85th minute equaliser for Lyon at ten-man Monaco in Ligue 1 action on Friday.,"The 25-year-old right-back, who spent seven years at Old Trafford and won three Premier League titles, came to the rescue as Monaco failed to hang on to their 39th-minute lead. ""I'm happy to get the goal but we're a bit disappointed that we didn't push on and get the win,"" said Rafael. ""The goal will give us some energy for the Champions League next week but we paid the price for a poor first half and a lack of rhythm."" Croatian international Mario Pasalic poached the opening goal for the home side six minutes before half-time following a corner from Thomas Lemar and a mistake by Lyon goalkeeper Anthony Lopes. The 20-year-old Pasalic, who is on loan from English champions Chelsea, planted his header past the embarrassed Lopes and put Leonardo Jardim's side in front. Monaco, who came into the match with a record of 10 victories and five draws against Lyon, appeared to be well on their way to improving that statistic before Rafael's first goal for the club. The task for Monaco to protect their lead was compromised with 24 minutes left when Brazilian defender Wallace was shown a straight red card for a horror tackle on Algerian winger Rachid Ghezzal. Then came Rafael's equaliser and a welcome boost for Hubert Fournier's men who now travel to Russia on Tuesday and a key Champions League tie against Zenit St Petersburg. Ligue 1 leaders Paris Saint-Germain put their undefeated start to the season on the line in the Saturday afternoon match at Bastia while Angers and Caen, who are the surprise rivals to Laurent Blanc's side and five points back, are also on the road. Promoted Angers travel to fourth-from-bottom Toulouse while Normandy outfit Caen travel to the Champagne region and a fixture against Reims. Marseille will have a section of their Velodrome stadium closed to supporters, following crowd trouble in the league match against Lyon last month, as they await Lorient in one of three Sunday fixtures that also feature high-scoring Nice at Rennes and Bordeaux at home to Montpellier in a battle of former champions."
219,15/10/2015,02:15,Depleted Monaco and Lyon looking for lift-off,"Tipped as the most likely challengers to Paris Saint-Germain this season, Monaco and Lyon have been hit by injuries and inconsistency as they prepare to meet in the principality on Friday.","Lyon were runners-up last season in Ligue 1 but come into this weekend's visit to the Stade Louis II in sixth place as they struggle to adapt to losing France's reigning young player of the year Nabil Fekir to a serious knee injury. France playmaker Clement Grenier is another long-term absentee and their attacking options were further reduced this week when teenage striker Aldo Kalulu was ruled out for two months with an ankle injury. French league rules allow clubs to sign a 'medical joker' outwith the transfer window to replace players ruled out with long-term injuries, but Lyon president Jean-Michel Aulas continues to rule out any possibility of bringing in a new face. ""At the moment we have no plans to bring in a medical joker, for several reasons,"" said Aulas. ""We have a good squad and players like Clement Grenier will come back. There are also players in the youth squad. And it is difficult for the morale of a player when he comes back and sees that another player has been signed and is playing in his place."" That may not please coach Hubert Fournier, whose side have a tricky trip to Russia to face Zenit St Petersburg in the Champions League next week. Lyon beat Reims 1-0 in their last outing before the international break but have not yet won back-to-back games this season, although Monaco are still looking for their first win at home in the league this season. And the principality side's coach Leonardo Jardim has a host of selection problems, with defenders Andrea Raggi and Ricardo Carvalho suspended and Malian midfielder Adama Traore having been ruled out with a fractured ankle. ""I don't know yet who will be fit to play on Friday,"" admitted Jardim, whose side are 10th in the standings, a distant 10 points behind unbeaten league leaders PSG. The reigning champions will look to extend their unbeaten start to the campaign when they face Bastia in Corsica on Saturday, although they could be forgiven for having one eye on next midweek's glamour Champions League clash at home to Real Madrid. Paris, who beat bitter rivals Marseille 2-1 a fortnight ago and are five points ahead of the chasing pack, saw centre-back David Luiz injure his left knee playing for Brazil in a World Cup qualifier against Chile last week, although they are hopeful he will be back in time to face Madrid. In addition, Salvatore Sirigu is set to return in goal after Kevin Trapp -- who usurped the Italian in the pecking order after arriving from Eintracht Frankfurt in the summer -- suffered a hamstring injury in training last week. Paris lost 4-2 in Bastia last season, but the Corsicans are not in great shape coming into this match, having lost five of their last six games. Angers, who were promoted last season, sit surprisingly in second place at the moment and visit struggling Toulouse on Saturday, while Caen in third go to Reims. Saint-Etienne had been in second place before losing their last two games so will be looking to bounce back at home to bottom side Gazelec Ajaccio. Marseille took encouragement from their performance against PSG, even in defeat, but are just four points clear of the relegation zone before hosting Lorient at the Stade Velodrome on Sunday.

It was just a second win in seven games in all competitions for OL, who pulled to within five points of Paris Saint-Germain, after they had suffered a damaging 1-0 home defeat against Valencia in Europe four days earlier. ""We put in a good first-half display but it wasn't as good in the second half when we began to retreat a bit,"" said Lazacette. ""The most important thing is the three points, though."" Lyon coach Hubert Fournier added: ""We're not going through our best period in terms of confidence. We need to boost it and it's through winning matches that we can achieve that."" Meanwhile it was just a second reverse of the season for surprise package Reims as their five-match unbeaten run was brought to an end. Lyon, soundly beaten at Bordeaux last weekend, were forced into an early reshuffle on Saturday when Milan Bisevac hobbled off after just six minutes and was replaced by Jordan Ferri. Johny Placide, whose injury-time own goal handed Lyon a 2-1 win in the same fixture last season, made a smart low stop to turn behind a deflected strike from Lacazette midway through the first half. Nicolas de Preville then tested Lyon goalkeeper Anthony Lopes at the other end with a low drive that the Portuguese international pushed away at his near post. The hosts were awarded a penalty on 41 minutes when Jaba Kankava handled inside the area but Reims were handed a reprieve as Lacazette smashed his spot-kick against the crossbar. It was the second time Lacazette had failed to convert from the penalty spot this season following a costly miss in a 1-1 draw at nine-man Gent in the Champions League last month. Last year's Ligue 1 Player of the Year redeemed himself, however, on the stroke of half-time as Lacazette exchanged passes with Claudio Beauvue before firing across Placide to put Lyon in front. The frame of the goal came to Reims' rescue for a second time on 56 minutes with Beauvue sending a thumping header against the bar following a Mathieu Valbuena corner. Placide then made a fine stop to tip over a stinging long-range effort from Lacazette with substitute Grejohn Kyei squandering a glorious chance to level for Reims on 75 minutes after a wonderful ball in from Diego on the left. Prince Oniangue nearly snatched a point for the visitors at the death but Lopes threw himself to his right to palm away the Congo midfielder's scissor kick. Elsewhere, promoted Angers continued their terrific start as they climbed to second, two points behind PSG, following a 1-0 win over Bastia. Guingamp ensured Troyes remained winless as the Brittany outfit claimed a 1-0 victory, while bottom side Gazelec Ajaccio drew 2-2 with Toulouse. Nice's match against Nantes was abandoned at the start of the second half, with the score 2-2, due to heavy rain on the south coast. On Sunday, all eyes will be on the Parc des Princes when league leaders PSG take on bitter rivals Marseille in Le Classique. Third-place Saint-Etienne visit Caen with fourth-placed Rennes at Monaco and Bordeaux making the trip to Lorient.

""Our start to the Champions League is perfect but we're still not qualified for the next round,"" PSG captain Thiago Silva told Canal+ after the match in Lviv. ""Now we have to rest up and starting Thursday we'll prepare ourselves for Sunday. Marseille have plenty of qualities, it's always special to play against them."" Wednesday's performance in Ukraine was arguably PSG's most complete display this term, a worrying sign for a Marseille side languishing down in 15th place, 12 points behind their arch rivals. Despite thumping wins over Troyes and Bastia, OM have lost four of eight league matches so far and new boss Michel is still adapting to the French mentality. ""It appears that in French football players preserve themselves so they don't play too many matches in a row, and they choose their matches within reason. This surprises me but I have to get used to it,"" said Michel, in quotes published by French sports daily L'Equipe. ""They tell me that when there are big games coming up, against PSG for example, that this is normal behaviour. I have to accept it but I have trouble understanding it,"" added the former Real Madrid midfielder, who spoke of certain players asking to sit out Thursday's home Europa League clash against Slovan Liberec, which OM lost 1-0. Recent history is not on the Spaniard's side either as PSG have won the last seven meetings between the two clubs, including a 3-2 victory at the Stade Velodrome in April that effectively signalled the end of Marseille's title challenge. Lyon's woes in front of goal persisted in their midweek 1-0 Champions League defeat at home to Valencia as last season's runners-up continue to struggle to overcome a long-term injury to Nabil Fekir. Hubert Fournier's men enter Saturday's showdown with fourth-placed Reims, unbeaten in their last five, already eight points adrift of PSG. ""Winning against Reims would be a good remedy to (Tuesday's) disappointment,"" Fournier, whose side have won just one of six matches since losing Fekir, told the club's website. ""There are more expectations than last season, perhaps too many right now for several reasons. ""Alexandre (Lacazette) is a case in point. He's struggling, just like the rest of the team, to meet people's expectations,"" Fournier said of the reigning Ligue 1 Player of the Year, who has scored just one goal this term and was left out of Didier Deschamps' latest France squad. ""(But) we're just four points from second place, so it's not an irreversible situation,"" added the OL coach. Second-placed Saint-Etienne, who had their five-match winning run emphatically snapped by Nice last weekend, will aim to get back on track at Caen, while third-placed Rennes, coming off three successive draws, go to mid-table Monaco. Free-scoring Nice have racked up 13 goals over the course of a three-match winning streak and will look to continue their ascent at home to Nantes. Promoted Angers, one of four teams five points off the pace, host Bastia, Lorient face Bordeaux, while goal-shy Lille kick off week nine against fellow strugglers Montpellier on Friday."
223,29/09/2015,15:01,Marseille fan arrested over Valbuena death threat,"A Marseille supporter was arrested on Tuesday, accused of publically threatening to kill the club's former star Mathieu Valbuena, a police source said.","The incident occurred during the match between Marseille and Lyon at the Stade Velodrome on September 20. The 27-year-old man, who has not been named, is accused of having shouted out a death threat over a loudspeaker during the match where Valbuena appeared for his new club Lyon against Marseille. Valbuena was a firm fan-favourite during an eight-year spell at Marseille before leaving to join Dynamo Moscow in 2014. After just one season in Russia he returned to Ligue 1 but joined Lyon. He was afforded a fiery reception by Marseille fans when the two sides clashed and an inflatable effigy of Valbuena was hung by the neck by a group of fans behind one of the goals. Seven Marseille fans have been arrested in relation to violence in and around the ground during the match. Three of those have already been condemned to prison sentences, although those may be commuted to community service. The two ends of the Velodrome were closed for Marseille's last home match -- a 2-1 defeat to Angers last Sunday -- as punishment for those incidents. The clubs fans have decided not to travel to the French capital this coming Sunday for the usually combustible clash with champions Paris Saint-Germain."

""When he speaks, lots of fans follow him, and when he tells stories, from his point of view, he makes it sound as if the player is in the wrong,"" said Lacazette in the Monday edition of the popular sports daily. ""Yes, his behaviour hurt and disappointed me."" Lacazette also blasted Fournier for not defending him over his form, despite the 24-year-old suffering from a back problem. ""It's true I've played badly in some matches -- you could even say I was rubbish -- but my back hurts,"" he said. ""I'd have prefered him (Fournier) to defend me, to show he's behind me rather than to stick the needle in a bit deeper."" Lacazette was top scorer in Ligue 1 last year with 27 goals and named player of the year. This season, though, he had failed to score until putting away a penalty against Marseille just over a week ago."

226,21/09/2015,03:17,Lyon chief blasts Marseille crowd violence,Lyon president Jean-Michel Aulas insisted early Monday that the toxic Ligue 1 clash between his side and Marseille should not have been restarted after a 20-minute stoppage caused by missile-throwing fans.,"With just over an hour gone at Marseille's Stade Velodrome ground, officials instructed both teams to return to the dressing rooms as objects, including bottles and cups, rained down from the stands as Lyon goalkeeper Anthony Lopes was trying to take a goal-kick. The return of Lyon's Mathieu Valbuena to face his former club had already made for a charged atmosphere with the France international, roundly booed throughout, already the target of missiles when taking corners. Lyon were leading 1-0 through a first-half penalty from Alexandre Lacazette when play was interrupted. But on the resumption, Marseille equalised to rescue a point. ""The best decision would have been not to restart the game,"" said Aulas, who believes such a decision would have prompted Marseille to rein in their notoriously unruly hardline fans. ""It was a very disagreeable atmosphere. I have been in football for 28 years but never have I seen the things like tonight. What happened to Valbuena was a vendetta, his physical safety was put in danger."" Marseille president Vincent Labrune tried to play down the trouble. ""The club will take its responsibility for the two or three bottles of beer that were thrown on the pitch. But we all have to be sensible. Me, I will accept my responsibilities as president and I want others to do the same -- from the federation, the referees' body and Lyon,"" he said. Lacazette, scorer of a club-record 27 goals last season on his way to winning Ligue 1's Player of the Year award, converted a contentious first-half penalty to atone for his midweek miss in the Champions League. But Marseille, despite seeing Romain Alessandrini sent off just before half-time, rescued a point after the interruption courtesy of Karim Rekik's first goal in French football. Valbuena was returning to the Stade Velodrome where he starred for Marseille until leaving for Dynamo Moscow last year before signing with Lyon in August. The Lyon playmaker brushed off the jeers and missiles from the crowd as well as a series of heavy challenges and played a key role in the visitors taking a 25th-minute lead. Valbuena threaded a pass through to Lacazette who then went down following minimal contact with Marseille goalkeeper Steve Mandanda before calmly tucking away the resulting spot-kick. Lacazette had seen his late penalty saved in Wednesday's 1-1 draw against nine-man Gent in Belgium but held his nerve on Sunday to end his early-season drought. Lacazette should have added to his tally a few minutes later when he timed a run in behind the Marseille defence to perfection only for his shot to crash back off the upright with Mandanda well beaten. Marseille were reduced to 10 men just before half-time with Alessandrini dismissed for a crude challenge on Valbuena. Earlier, Saint-Etienne recorded a fourth successive league win, 2-0 against Nantes, to move to within a point of leaders Paris Saint-Germain. Les Verts took a first-half lead at the Stade Geoffroy-Guichard through a first Ligue 1 goal from teenager Jonathan Bamba. Slovenian international Robert Beric, who arrived from Rapid Vienna last month, then added the second just after half-time to seal victory for Christophe Galtier's side. Monaco's indifferent start to the season continued as the principality side found themselves two goals down to Lorient inside 20 minutes. Didier Ndong hammered a long-range thunderbolt beyond Monaco goalkeeper Danijel Subasic before Benjamin Jeannot added a second for the visitors. Almamy Toure pulled one back for Monaco shortly after and the hosts were back on level terms when Thomas Lemar equalised just after the interval but substitute Benjamin Moukandjo's 59th-minute strike won it for Lorient. On Saturday, Edinson Cavani kept Paris Saint-Germain's unbeaten start to the season intact as he equalised late on at Reims in a 1-1 draw."

But the OL playmaker brushed off the jeers and missiles from the crowd as well as a series of heavy challenges and played a key role in the visitors taking a 25th-minute lead. ""Perhaps we allowed our concentration to lapse in the five minutes after the interruption, but that's not an excuse,"" said Lyon coach Hubert Fournier. ""I don't want comment on the incidents, the officials made their decisions."" In the build-up to Lyon's goal, Valbuena threaded a pass through to Lacazette who then went down following minimal contact with OM goalkeeper Steve Mandanda before calmly tucking away the resulting spot-kick. Lacazette had seen his late penalty saved in Wednesday's 1-1 draw against nine-man Gent in Belgium but held his nerve on Sunday to end his early-season drought.

Play was then interrupted in the second half for roughly 20 minutes as objects rained down from the stands but Marseille equalised within a few minutes of the resumption when former Manchester City defender Rekik headed home from a corner. Christophe Jallet, on target at Gent four days earlier, nearly snatched all three points for Lyon late on but was denied by a fine reflex stop from Mandanda with Valbuena then fizzing a volley just wide. Earlier, Saint-Etienne recorded a fourth successive league win to move to within a point of leaders Paris Saint-Germain. Les Verts took a first-half lead at the Stade Geoffroy-Guichard through a first Ligue 1 goal from teenager Jonathan Bamba.

Enzo Crivelli scored a minute from time to salvage a 1-1 draw for Bordeaux against ten-man Toulouse. Moroccan midfielder Adrien Regattin smashed home the opening goal Toulouse in the 23rd minute but a straight red card shown to Oscar Trejo with 13 minutes left hampered the visitors chances of holding on for maximum points. On Saturday, Edinson Cavani kept Paris Saint-Germain's unbeaten start to the season intact as he equalised late on at Reims in a 1-1 draw. Rennes, like Saint-Etienne, are also just one point back after coming from behind to draw 1-1 at home to Lille on Friday evening."
228,16/09/2015,15:44,France star Valbuena takes old club Marseille to court,"Lyon and France playmaker Mathieu Valbuena has gone to court to claim 568,000 euros ($640,000; £414,000) in compensation from his old club Marseille following a dispute with his former agent.","Valbuena, 30, believes the money, which he paid to his former agent Christophe Hutteau in May as compensation for breaking their contract, should in fact have been paid by Marseille. Valbuena is preparing to face his old side, for whom he starred between 2006 and 2014 before spending a season at Dynamo Moscow, when Lyon go to the Stade Velodrome in Ligue 1 on Sunday, and he can expect a hostile reception from the home fans. The player's lawyer said that Marseille president Vincent Labrune had made a ""verbal commitment"" to pay the sum in question when Valbuena left OM last year. The 50-times capped midfielder had been ordered to pay Hutteau the money in two instalments. When he refused to do so, the agent asked for accounts and luxury cars belonging to Valbuena to be seized, including a Porsche Cayenne. Marseille deny having made any commitment to pay the money. A protocol signed by the three parties stated that the club would do so if Valbuena was transferred before the end of June 2014, but the move did not go through until August last year. A verdict will be announced early next month."
229,12/09/2015,19:44,Lyon miss chance to close gap on PSG,Lyon missed an opportunity to make up ground on French league leaders Paris Saint-Germain as they were held to a frustrating 0-0 draw by Lille on Saturday.,"Lyon returned to domestic duty without Nabil Fekir after the France international ruptured the anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee in his country's 1-0 win over Portugal last week. Lille entered the weekend with just one goal scored through their first four matches under new coach Herve Renard but Junior Tallo and Adama Soumaoro forced home goalkeeper Anthony Lopes into two smart saves in quick succession. Mathieu Valbuena then came agonisingly close to netting his first Lyon goal since joining from Dinamo Moscow last month when his free-kick from 30 yards smacked back off the crossbar minutes before the interval. Hubert Fournier's hosts ramped up the pressure after the break but couldn't find a way past Lille goalkeeper Vincent Enyeama. A slick passing move on the edge of the visitors' box found Valbuena in space on the right but his goalbound effort was tipped over by the Nigerian international. Another Valbuena free-kick nearly resulted in the breakthrough Lyon craved but Rafael da Silva's glancing header bounced back off the inside of the post with Enyeama well beaten. Lyon continued their furious assault on the Lille goal right until the finish as Mapou Yanga-Mbiwa saw a header tipped over by Enyeama that preserved a fourth clean sheet in five for the northerners. Later on Saturday promoted Angers put their unbeaten record on the line away to winless Lorient while second-place Reims can draw to within a point of PSG with a victory at Toulouse. Monaco visit bottom side Gazelac Ajaccio on Sunday with high-flyers Rennes travelling to Nantes while struggling Marseille, who have lost three of their first four matches, host Bastia. A nightmare evening for PSG goalkeeper Kevin Trapp ended the French champions' perfect start to the season on Friday. Laurent Blanc's men twice led through goals from Uruguayan striker Edinson Cavani but an own goal from Trapp followed by another mistake from the German allowed Wahbi Khazri to earn Bordeaux a precious point."
230,12/09/2015,00:54,France striker Fekir set for surgery,"France international striker Nabil Fekir will undergo knee surgery on Monday after picking up the serious injury playing against Portugal last week, his Ligue 1 club Lyon confirmed.","The operation will be carried out by Dr. Bertrand Sonnery-Cottet in the private Jean-Mermoz Hospital in Lyon in south-east France. Fekir, 22, lasted just 13 minutes of his first international start in a 1-0 friendly victory against Portugal in Lisbon before succumbing to what was later confirmed as a ruptured anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee. The Lyon star, who made his full international debut against Brazil in March and has won five caps, will be out for around six months and already faces a race against time to recover form and fitness before the European Championship. France coach Didier Deschamps described the long-term loss of the exciting Lyon attacker as a ""body blow"" for the Euro 2016 hosts."
231,05/09/2015,18:14,Lyon boss rules out cover for injured Fekir,Lyon president Jean-Michel Aulas on Saturday ruled out signing another player to cover for injured star striker Nabil Fekir who is expected to be sidelined for six months.,"""Fate often hits men in top form,"" said Aulas of 22-year-old Fekir who ruptured cruciate ligaments in his right knee in France's 1-0 friendly win in Portugal on Friday night. Fekir returned to the Ligue 1 club on Saturday and was immediately taken under the wing of Lyon's medical staff and doctor Emmanuel Orhant, with the club expecting him to undergo surgery for the injury. ""First of all, the rules are not in our favour for the hiring of a wildcard as this possible cover might not be on the list to compete in the Champions League,"" Aulas said in an interview on the club's website. ""After discussions .. we're all in agreement that we have great confidence in the group. We have Alex (Lacazette) and Claudio (Beauvue). There is also Maxwel (Cornet) who has impressed everyone and Aldo (Kalulu),"" he continued. ""We said to ourselves that taking an additional player now while Nabil is going to undergo surgery isn't the best thing and it would give the young players the opportunity to make their mark."" Fekir had been in form this season scoring a hat-trick for last season's Ligue 1 runners-up at Caen last weekend. Lyon are fifth in the table, five points behind leaders Paris Saint-Germain."
232,29/08/2015,20:18,Fekir hits hat-trick as Lyon thrash Caen,French international Nabil Fekir scored a hat-trick as last season's Ligue 1 runners-up Lyon rumbled to a 4-0 win at Caen and temporarily into third in the French top flight.,"Corentin Tolisso helped set up two of Fekir's goals on a day when new signing Mathieu Valbuena was also on display. Guadaloupean-born 27-year-old Claudio Beauvue was also on the scoresheet as Hubert Fournier's side got back to winning ways following a 2-1 home loss to Rennes last time out. ""The win was important because we are Olympique Lyonnais and to lose twice would already be the beginning of a small crisis so it was good to find some serenity and especially with our offensive players who were great today,"" said Fournier. ""We messed up against Rennes at home (defeat last week) in a situation when we were not quite up to our level but tonight we scored four goals which doesn't happen to everyone. Things are not yet perfect and we realise that but to win 4-0 is good for our morale."" added Fournier. Fekir's first came on 18 minutes as he took a pass from Tolisso, beat Damien Da Silva and then shot past goalkeeper Remy Vercoutre. His second came a minute before the break after he turned Chaker Alhadhur inside out. Valbuena set up the third on 57 minutes and four minutes from time Beauvue hit a cross-shot from the corner of the area that gave Vercoutre no chance. Lyon now trail defending champions Paris Saint-Germain by two points, although Laurent Blanc's undefeated capital outfit can restore their lead when they travel to Monaco in the weekend's final match on Sunday. Caen remain in the top eight, three points behind PSG after two wins and two defeats form four games. On Friday night, Sloan Privat and Nicolas Benezet gave Guingamp their first goals of the season in a 2-0 win which sent Marseille crashing back to earth. Marseille had been riding a tide of euphoria since the arrival of new coach Michel with a 6-0 rout of Troyes last weekend following losses in their opening two games, but cold reality hit again in Brittany. ""The rhythm of the game was very fast and the opposition very strong,"" said Spaniard Michel, who took over after Argentine Marcelo Bielsa quit after the first game of the season. The 26-year-old Privat had missed a penalty early on but made up by getting his team's first goal after 72 minutes at the Roudourou Stadium with Benezet scoring the second with one minute to go. Their first points of the season lifted Guingamp off the bottom of the table just behind Marseille who are 13th, also with three points from four games. Playing later on Saturday, 2012 champions Montpellier travel to Troyes and Herve Renard's Lille entertain promoted GFC Ajaccio."
233,17/08/2015,15:11,Yanga-Mbiwa targets Euro 2016 after joining Lyon,"Central defender Mapou Yanga-Mbiwa has targeted a return to the France squad for Euro 2016 after completing a move from Roma to Lyon last week for an initial eight million euros (£5.7m, $8.9m).","""There will be a lot of expectation around me and I am going to do everything to live up to that. ""With Lyon our objective is to have a good season in all competitions and notably finish in the top three in the league, and then after that, why not think about the Euro,"" said the 26-year-old defender, who was born in the Central African Republic. Yanga-Mbiwa is back in France, where he previously starred in the Montpellier team that won the Ligue 1 title in 2012, after spells at Newcastle United and in the Italian capital. He has won four caps for Les Bleus, all under current coach Didier Dschamps, the most recent coming in a friendly against Albania in November last year. France will host next year's European Championship as they look to repeat their feat of 1984, when they were crowned continental champions on home soil. OL turned to Yanga-Mbiwa to strengthen their defence ahead of their return to the Champions League group stage after previously failing in a bid to sign Cameroon international Nicolas Nkoulou from Marseille. ""He is a player who has the objective of playing at the Euro and, unlike Nicolas Nkoulou, he will not pose any problems when it comes to the Africa Cup of Nations,"" declared Lyon president Jean-Michel Aulas. The fee for Yanga-Mbiwa could eventually rise to 10 million euros with bonuses. Lyon recorded their first win of the new French season at the weekend, beating Guingamp 1-0 thanks to a goal from another summer signing, forward Claudio Beauvue."
234,15/08/2015,23:10,Lyon's Beauvue thwarts old club Guingamp,Claudio Beauvue came back to haunt his old club Guingamp as he struck a late winner for Lyon in a 1-0 Ligue 1 win on Saturday.,"Hubert Fournier's men were frustrated in a goalless draw at home to Lorient in their opener last week, but they put that right thanks to new signing Beauvue, who hit 17 league goals for Guingamp last term. The striker from the French Caribbean island of Guadeloupe, who scored for the Brittany-based club in a 3-1 defeat against Lyon in this fixture last season, struck the only goal after 79 minutes to condemn Guingamp to a second straight defeat. Lyon now have four points from two games, and are in a group of four teams joint second behind leaders Caen, the only side with a maximum six points ahead of Sunday's games when champions Paris Saint-Germain are at home to newly-promoted Corsican minnows Gazelec Ajaccio. Normandy side Caen continued their perfect start with another 1-0 success, this time at home to Toulouse. Patrice Garande's men stunned Marseille at the Stade Velodrome on the opening weekend -- a result which prompted Marcelo Bielsa's resignation -- and they got the better of Toulouse thanks to a wonderful 69th-minute header from Damien Da Silva. ""Let's say we're lucky leaders,"" said Caen coach Patrice Garande. ""The positive point is to have won because for the first 20 minutes we were very poor technically and in our defence. This result demonstrates the dogged spirit of the team."" Serbia defender Uros Spajic was red carded late on to compound the visitors' misery. Nice threw away a two-goal lead at ten-man Troyes to draw 3-3 in a pulsating game at the Stade de l'Aube. Claude Puel's men also blew a lead against Monaco in their opening 2-1 loss last weekend. Newly-promoted Troyes got off to flying start in front of their home fans thanks to Corentin Jean's third-minute opener. But Nice responded as former Lyon, Marseille and Newcastle winger Hatem Ben Arfa levelled from the penalty spot minutes later. Alassane Plea turned the game around for the visitors after 16 minutes before the hosts were reduced to ten men after Chris Mavinga's second yellow card on the half hour. Maxime Le Marchand scored Nice's third before the break and there appeared no way back for Troyes. Fabien Camus halved the deficit after 77 minutes before Thiago Xavier struck a dramatic leveller in stoppage time to salvage an unlikely draw for last year's Ligue 2 champions. Montpellier's dismal early season form continued as they suffered their second straight defeat, going down 1-0 at Rennes following an 86th-minute winner from Polish international winger Kamil Grosicki. Meanwhile, former eight-time French champions Nantes and Angers, who are back in the top flight after a 21-year absence, played out a 0-0 draw. The result moves both sides on to four points with neither club having conceded a goal in their opening two matches. Earlier on Saturday, a stoppage-time free-kick by stand-in captain Henri Saivet gave Bordeaux a 1-1 draw with Saint-Etienne at the Stade Geoffroy-Guichard. Saint-Etienne looked set for all three points when Fabien Lemoine set up Romain Hamouma to finish after 58 minutes. The match was in stoppage time when the visitors won a free-kick, and the wall opened up to let Senegal international Saivet's low shot through to ensure a share of the points."

The 26-year-old centre-back, who has four caps, was part of the Montpellier side that won the title in 2012 before moving to Newcastle United in 2013 and then moving on to Roma last year. He will become Lyon's second signing of the week after that of France playmaker Mathieu Valbuena from Dynamo Moscow and fifth of the summer with Jeremy Morel (Marseille), Rafael da Silva (Manchester United) and Claudio Beauvue (Guingamp) also arriving."

Lyon did not divulge the size of his transfer fee nor the duration of his contract. He passed a medical in Lyon on Tuesday morning having arrived in the city on Monday night and is due to be officially unveiled later on Tuesday afternoon. Valbuena began his career at Libourne before moving to Marseille in 2006. He won the French title with the southern giants in 2010, the same year he made his France debut -- he has since scored seven goals in 48 appearances for the national team."

""It was complicated and long,"" the 24-year-old France international declared after putting pen to paper to a deal worth reportedly 4,5 million euros ($4.9 million, £3.1 million) a year. ""I let it be known my wish to stay at the club and to refuse any outside offer,"" he added. ""The important thing for me was not whether I would extend my contract or not, but to stay at the club. ""I knew that I was going to stay here."" He becomes Lyon's top earner ahead of playmaker Clement Grenier, who has also signed a new deal. Among those suitors intent on signing up the £30 million (42 million euro, $46.5 million)-rated striker were Premier League sides Liverpool, Manchester United and Arsenal. Saturday's announcement follows Lyon manager Hubert Fournier's assertion on July 24 that Lacazette would remain a Lyon player. Seven-time former champions Lyon finished second to champions Paris-Saint Germain last season, and open their 2015-2016 campaign at home to Lorient on Sunday."
238,01/08/2015,23:10,PSG ease past Lyon in Champions Trophy,"Paris Saint-Germain started the new season on Saturday just as they ended the old, lifting silverware in the shape of the French Champions Trophy thanks to a 2-0 win over Lyon in Montreal.","Two early goals by Serge Aurier and Edinson Cavani put Paris in control of the traditional season-opening contest and left Lyon with a mountain to climb long before their captain Maxime Gonalons was sent off in the 64th minute. Having completed an unprecedented clean sweep of the domestic honours in France last season, this win underlined their status as the team to beat again in the coming campaign. Tipped to be their main challengers once more, Lyon were invited to face the treble winners after finishing second to them in Ligue 1 last season as the Champions Trophy was played outside France for the seventh year in a row. But, weakened by a series of injuries to key players and by the absence of suspended starlet Nabil Fekir, Lyon never looked like winning a game played in front of an enthusiastic crowd at the Saputo Stadium in the largest city of Canada's French-speaking Quebec province. A strong PSG side featuring German summer signing Kevin Trapp in goal opened the scoring in the 11th minute as the Lyon defence failed to clear a free-kick into the box and David Luiz drove the ball back into the six-yard box for his fellow defender Aurier to head home. The second goal arrived just six minutes later when Anthony Lopes saved from Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Cavani, who started pre-season late after featuring for Uruguay at the Copa America, lashed home the loose ball. With last season's top scorer and player of the year Alexandre Lacazette unable to make an impression, Lyon offered little at the other end and Blaise Matuidi missed a great chance to increase PSG's lead after Lopes saved from Ibrahimovic's extravagant backheeled effort. Ibrahimovic, who has been in good form during his club's pre-season tour of North America as he enters the last year of his PSG contract, fired wide in the second half when finding himself with just Lopes to beat. And shortly after he was on the receiving end of a Gonalons challenge that saw the Lyon captain pick up a second yellow card and depart for an early bath. ""The mood in the camp is good. It is early days but we have prepared well,"" Matuidi told beIN Sports. ""The season will be long. Now we have spent 18 days abroad and it is difficult, so we are looking forward to going home, seeing our families again and resting before the season starts."" Fresh from winning a third successive Champions Trophy, Laurent Blanc's PSG side start their title defence at Lille on Friday, while Lyon will begin the new Ligue 1 season at home to Lorient next Sunday."
239,26/07/2015,17:18,Villarreal add to Lyon's misery in Emirates Cup,Villarreal piled on the pain for Lyon with a 2-0 victory that kept alive the Spanish club's hopes of winning the Emirates Cup on Sunday.,"Goals from Bruno Soriano and Leo Baptistao gave Marcelino Garcia Toral's side their second win in the pre-season tournament at Arsenal's Emirates Stadium after Saturday's success against Wolfsburg. Villarreal sit top of the four-team table, but hosts Arsenal will win their own tournament for the first time since 2010 if they beat Bundesliga runners-up Wolfsburg later on Sunday due to their superior number of goals scored. It was another dispiriting defeat for Hubert Fournier's Lyon just 24 hours after the French team's humiliating 6-0 thrashing against Arsenal. Fournier admitted he will consider making new signings in the aftermath of a weekend that rocked his plans for the season after France midfielder Clement Grenier suffered a ruptured quad muscle on Saturday. ""We don't need to consider it's the end of the world by any means. But based on what I've noticed in the Emirates Cup we really have to strengthen,"" he said. ""It's up to us to try to find an answer so we can have a more solid central defensive partnership than we managed over the two games. ""We are a lot more leaky than we have been previously."" Fournier made 11 changes to his starting line-up and the switches made Lyon more competitive, but they still couldn't avoid another morale-denting loss ahead of their Trophee des Champions showdown with Paris Saint Germain next weekend. And the Lyon boss conceded his team's poor form has left him uncertain who to select for the PSG clash. ""We will analyse what we have seen and try to come up with the most suitable line-up,"" he added. ""Grenier's injury means we need to think about the best formation to meet Paris Saint Germain. ""It was a complete rupture of the muscle. It is a serious injury that is for sure. As for the exact length of time he will be out, I will have to ask the medical staff."" Lyon were first to threaten through teenage striker Aldo Kalulu, whose low shot drew a good save from Alphonse Areola. Villarreal also had plenty of chances, with both Samuel Castillejo and Gerard Moreno denied by keeper Mathieu Gorgelin. Lyon captain Steed Malbranque rattled the crossbar with a dipping volley from the edge of the penalty area. But it was Villarreal who took the lead in the 31st minute when Dylan Mboumbouni conceded a penalty with a clumsy barge into the back of Javier Espinosa as they contested a header. Villarreal skipper Soriano stepped up to calmly stroke the spot-kick past Gorgelin. Lyon struck the woodwork again just before half-time when Bakary Kone's powerful header cannoned back off the bar from Arnold Mvuemba's corner. However, Villarreal doubled their lead in the 54th minute as Brazilian forward Baptistao ran onto Moreno's pass into the penalty area and lifted his shot over Gorgelin."
240,25/07/2015,20:08,Lyon star Grenier set to miss start of season,"Lyon manager Hubert Fournier admits France midfielder Clement Grenier is likely to miss the start of the season after suffering a ""serious injury"" in Saturday's 6-0 defeat against Arsenal.","Grenier clutched his leg and collapsed to the turf while attempting a pass in the first half and appeared to wipe away tears as he limped down the tunnel. The 24-year-old, who only returned to action late last season after a year on the sidelines due to a groin injury and other fitness issues, has pulled a quad muscle and Fournier doesn't expect him to recover for several weeks. That will rule him out of Lyon's Trophee des Champions clash against Paris Saint Germain on August 1 and their Ligue 1 opener against Lorient on August 9. ""It's not great news I'm afraid. He's got a problem with his quad. he's pulled a muscle, so it's not encouraging,"" Fournier said. ""It's not the groin but it's still a serious injury and that's going to give us a problem at the start of the season. ""We are going to wait for the tests on Clement to see how long he will be out."" Grenier's injury summed up a dispiriting day for Fournier, whose side offered little resistence as they slumped to a dismal defeat in their opening match in the pre-season Emirates Cup tournament. ""We have definitely taken a bit of a clip around the ear. The fact we conceded six is a huge disappointment,"" he said. ""The injury to Clement did destabilise us, but we won't use that as an excuse. ""We weren't particularly calm. We were found wanting in our mindset. We gave up at one stage in the first half. ""When you concede four goals in 10 minutes it is a mental issue and we have to address that. ""But there is no emergency here. It will allow us to get everyone back on task with their responsibilities because it was a team defeat."""
241,25/07/2015,19:25,Rampant Arsenal hit Lyon for six,Arsenal made a stylish start to their Emirates Cup campaign as four goals in nine minutes inspired a scintillating 6-0 rout of Lyon on Saturday.,"Arsene Wenger's side demolished their woeful French opponents before half-time in their first match in the four-team pre-season tournament at the Emirates Stadium. Olivier Giroud opened the scoring on the half-hour before Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain doubled the lead. Alex Iwobi and Aaron Ramsey continued the remarkable goal spree, with Mesut Ozil and Santi Cazorla netting after half-time to cap a swaggering Arsenal display that suggested they are already approaching peak form with their Premier League opener against West Ham still two weeks away. Although an Arsenal director this week claimed Wenger has been given a £200 million ($310 million) transfer warchest as the north Londoners aim for a first English title since 2004, the Gunners boss remains happy with the squad that won last season's FA Cup and has so far signed only goalkeeper Petr Cech from Chelsea. Arsenal fans arriving at the Emirates might have been disappointed to discover Cech had been left on the bench as Wenger, on the verge of loaning Wojciech Szczesny to Roma, took a look at Argentine back-up Emiliano Martinez. But that was quickly forgotten as the hosts, despite the absence of Alexis Sanchez -- still resting after helping Chile win the Copa America -- tore apart last season's Ligue 1 runners-up. The first chance fell to Lyon when Alexandre Lacazette's backheel set up a Clinton N'Jie drive that Martinez saved with his legs. But Hubert Fournier's team went into complete meltdown after France midfielder Clement Grenier was forced off in the 25th minute. Grenier had clutched his left leg and collapsed to the turf while attempting a pass and appeared to wipe away tears as he limped down the tunnel. To add insult to injury for Lyon, Wenger's team took the lead in the 29th minute when France forward Giroud rose to direct a glancing effort off his shoulder and into the far corner from Ozil's inswinging free-kick. Giroud turned provider when Arsenal increased their advantage five minutes later with the kind of rapier thrust that so often pierces opposing defences. Breaking at speed from inside their own half, Ramsey led the Arsenal charge as he picked out Giroud, whose perfectly-weighted pass sent England midfielder Oxlade-Chamberlain galloping clear to fire low past Lyon goalkeeper Anthony Lopes. The rampant Gunners were almost unstoppable by now and added a third 60 seconds later after a bewildering blur of quickfire passes gave Iwobi the chance to finish emphatically. Iwobi, a nephew of Nigeria legend Jay-Jay Okocha, has yet to make his competitive debut for Arsenal, but the 19-year-old winger impressed Wenger during the club's recent tour to Singapore and his cool strike was the perfect way to announce himself to Arsenal's fans. Wenger's men still weren't satisfied with their half's work and made it four in the 38th minute when Ramsey passed to Ozil before embarking on a lung-bursting run that ended with the Wales midfielder prodding past Lopes from close-range. After that blitz, Arsenal took it easier in the second half, but they were still dominant enough to score twice more. Ozil finished off a flowing move with a composed 62nd minute strike and Cazorla came off the bench to blast his 85th minute free-kick past the shell-shocked Lopes. Earlier on Saturday, Villarreal kicked off the tournament with a 2-1 win over Wolfsburg. On Sunday, Arsenal face Wolfsburg after Villarreal take on Lyon."
242,24/07/2015,19:20,In-demand Lacazette will stay at Lyon says Fournier,Lyon manager Hubert Fournier on Friday claimed France forward Alexandre Lacazette will remain at his club this season despite interest from Europe's superpowers.,"Lacazette has been attracting attention from a host of top teams, with recent reports suggesting Premier League sides Liverpool and Manchester United were ready to make offers for the £30 million-rated star. Another club reportedly showing an interest is Arsenal, with Gunners boss Arsene Wenger able to take a closer look at the 24-year-old when his team face Lyon in the Emirates Cup pre-season tournament on Saturday. But, speaking ahead of the match, Fournier insisted Lacazette is happy at the Stade de Gerland and will be an important part of a Lyon squad looking for success in all competitions having finished second to Paris Saint-Germain in Ligue 1 last year. When asked where he saw Lacazette playing this season, Fournier said: ""Olympique Lyonnais. I haven't got much to say. He has said he wants to stay with us. ""Of course some clubs are going to be attracted to the sort of player he is but he is under contract at Lyon and with all of the different competitions we have this season with the Champions League and the domestic French cups, we obviously want to keep him at the club."""
243,08/07/2015,15:18,Striker Fekir commits to Lyon,"Striker Nabil Fekir committed his future to French side Lyon on Wednesday after signing a contract extension until 2020, the club said.","The 21-year-old, who scored 13 goals for Les Gones last season as they finished as runners-up to Paris Saint-Germain, has agreed a deal estimated to be worth around four times more than he was earning last season. ""This was an easy decision for me to make,"" said Fekir. ""This is the club of my heart and I want to take it as high as possible,"" added the striker, who was born in Lyon but is of Algerian descent. Fekir, who made his France debut this year in a friendly defeat to Brazil, was a key component as Hubert Fournier's side pushed PSG all the way in the Ligue 1 title race. The news will be a major boost to Lyon with several top European sides, including Premier League giants Arsenal, said to be interested in signing the player. Lyon chairman Jean-Michel Aulas said: ""I congratulate Nabil for the extension and for what he did on and off the field."" The seven-time French champions also announced that goalkeeper Anthony Lopes had also extended his stay at the Stade Gerland until 2020. The 24-year-old goalkeeper, who made his international debut for Portugal this year, played every minute for Lyon in Ligue 1 last season. Lyon have also tied down French under-21 midfielder Corentin Tolisso to a new contract until 2020. The 20-year-old also played in every league game for the club last season."
244,03/07/2015,18:13,Nganioni signs professional deal with Lyon,"France Under-20 international defender Louis Nganioni signed his first professional contract with Lyon, the French club announced Friday.","The 20-year-old, who came through the youth system at Lyon after they took him on in 2010, signed a three-year deal. Nganioni, capped seven times at Under-20 level, played in several friendly pre-season matches last year but has yet to play in Ligue 1. Nganioni's decision to remain with Lyon comes on the heels of last season's title runners-up completing the signing of Guingamp's freescoring forward Claudio Beauvue on Thursday. They had previously strengthened their defence with the signing of the experienced fullback Jeremy Morel from Marseille."

247,19/06/2015,17:09,Lyon ready to offer Lacazette bumper new deal,"Lyon are ready to offer a new deal with an annual salary of at least four million euros ($4.5m, 2.9m pounds) to star striker Alexandre Lacazette in an attempt to keep him at the club.","""Alexandre wishes to be the number one and receive the biggest salary at the club, which is absolutely understandable. He will earn at least four million euros a year,"" said Lyon president Jean-Michel Aulas on Friday at the site of the club's new stadium, which is due to open early in 2016. Lacazette has become a target for leading clubs around Europe after ending last season as the top scorer in Ligue 1 with 27 goals, but Aulas said it would be ""a strategical error"" to sell the French international. ""That is why we have made him an offer that will see him become the best paid player at Lyon by far,"" added Aulas. Lacazette, France's player of the year, is currently under contract until 2018 and Aulas said that he would be consulted, along with club captain Maxime Gonalons, about potential new signings."
248,11/06/2015,13:02,France midfielder Grenier extends Lyon deal,Lyon's French international playmaker Clement Grenier has agreed a new deal that will keep him at the club until 2018.,"Lyon, who finished second in Ligue 1 last season to return to the Champions League, announced the news on their website on Thursday. The player's existing contract was due to expire at the end of next season. Grenier, who joined OL as an 11-year-old, has won five caps for France. However, he missed last year's World Cup and the bulk of last season through injury, only returning to feature in the run-in."
249,24/05/2015,12:39,Keeping home-grown stars the key for Lyon,"After several years of decline, the future looks bright for Lyon with an exciting young team, a return to the Champions League and the prospect of a move into a new stadium next season.","However, whether the seven-time French champions can maintain their revival will depend on their ability to keep hold of their biggest assets, notably Ligue 1 player of the year Alexandre Lacazette and young player of the year Nabil Fekir. Hubert Fournier's side pushed overwhelming favourites Paris Saint-Germain almost all the way in the race for the title, only seeing their dream of a first Ligue 1 crown since 2008 ended with a game to spare. Nevertheless, second place was their best performance since 2010 and better than most fans would have hoped for last summer, when the highly-respected Remi Garde departed following the club's worst finish -- fifth -- in 16 years. His replacement Fournier had done an excellent job in leading Reims back into the top flight and keeping them there, but few expected him to lead Lyon into the Champions League. ""I've got a few ideas and a different methodology, and my arrival should allow a new impetus at the club - and change a few old habits,"" he said after being unveiled, but Lyon lost three of their first four matches. With playmaker Clement Grenier struggling with his fitness and the injury-prone Yoann Gourcuff still unable to put a run of games together, Fournier's squad looked ill-equipped to compete. However, they somehow emerged as title challengers, thanks largely to a run of 10 consecutive home wins and the form of Lacazette and Fekir. Lacazette scored 27 league goals, a club record in a league campaign, while Fekir had scored 13 and set up nine more before the final game of the season at Rennes, breaking into the France squad as a result. With other home-reared stars like goalkeeper Anthony Lopes, Samuel Umtiti, captain Maxime Gonalons, Jordan Ferri and Corentin Tolisso, Lyon were a joy to watch at times and can now prepare for Champions League football next season. They will go straight into the group stage for the first time since 2011-12, although they are likely to be in the third pot of seeds. ""We are going to draw some really big teams. But that doesn't scare me,"" captain Gonalons told sports daily L'Equipe last week. ""All season, watching the Champions League on television and hearing the music, I have thought about getting back into it and reliving it all. We have been away from it for too long."" The prize money that comes with playing in the Champions League will help the finances of a club who recorded another big loss last season of more than 26 million euros ($29.8m, £18.9m). That will give them a chance of keeping hold of their best players, despite interest from elsewhere. ""We need to keep the majority of the players. But we will need to improve the contracts of two or three of them,"" former Lyon striker Bernard Lacombe, now an advisor to president Jean-Michel Aulas, told L'Equipe. He was certainly referring to Lacazette and Fekir, who has yet to agree terms on a new deal since emerging as a genuine star turn this season, although his agent Jean-Pierre Bernes has publicly encouraged him to stay put. However, Gourcuff will leave with his contract ending, while Gonalons says he is staying and hopes his colleagues will too. A long-awaited move into a new 60,000-seat stadium will come at the turn of next year, and Aulas needs as good a team as possible on the pitch in order to fill seats. But is quite possible that Lyon's star players will not want to risk moving away this summer and thereby potentially jeopardising their chances of featuring for France on home soil at Euro 2016. ""The club is in a better position to resist, but of course we can't stop a big offer coming in. But we need to be ready for a difficult next season. We will be playing every three days so we will need to keep everyone,"" Gonalons said."
250,17/05/2015,20:06,"Lacazette, Blanc take honours in French awards",Lyon striker Alexandre Lacazette was named France's player of the year at a ceremony in Paris on Sunday as Paris Saint-Germain boss Laurent Blanc won the Ligue 1 coach of the year prize.,"Lacazette won the award, voted for by his peers, ahead of PSG trio Zlatan Ibrahimovic, Javier Pastore and Marco Verratti after a remarkable season in which he has scored 27 Ligue 1 goals to help Lyon finish second and qualify for next season's Champions League. His form has attracted interest from elsewhere, with PSG and Arsenal among those linked with an approach for the 23-year-old. And Lacazette admitted that he is uncertain where his future lies beyond this campaign. ""I don't know,"" he replied when asked if he would still be at OL next season. ""That is a question that will be asked at the end of the season. ""I am very proud, it is a boyhood dream come true to win the trophy for the best player."" There was to be no third straight player of the year gong for Ibrahimovic, but Blanc won the coach's award for the second time in his career, a day after the capital club retained the French title. The 49-year-old, who previously took the honour when in charge of Bordeaux in 2008, saw his PSG side secure a third consecutive Ligue 1 crown with a game to spare on Saturday after they beat Montpellier 2-1. Having already won the season-opening Champions Trophy and the League Cup, PSG can win an unprecedented clean sweep of the domestic honours by beating second-tier Auxerre in the French Cup final on May 30. Hubert Fournier of runners-up Lyon, Saint-Etienne coach Christophe Galtier and Guingamp coach Jocelyn Gourvennec were the other nominees. ""This trophy is not a title, but a reward,"" said Blanc. ""Titles are won on the field and are more important, they represent more. But I am nevertheless happy to be rewarded."" Blanc was beaten to the prize last year by Lille's Rene Girard and he added: ""Last year I did not get the reward when we were more dominant in the league. But when I started out, I won it when we finished second (with Bordeaux)."" Lyon forward Nabil Fekir, who has scored 13 goals in Ligue 1 this season playing alongside Lacazette and recently broke into the French national set-up, won the young player of the year award. ""A year ago I never would have imagined experiencing this. But I deserve this trophy,"" insisted Fekir, who chose France over Algeria and made his debut for Les Bleus against Brazil in March."
251,17/05/2015,12:38,Lyon to let talented misfit Gourcuff go,The rollercoaster career of former France international Yoann Gourcuff suffered a new blow Sunday when Lyon president Jean-Michel Aulas revealed he was surplus to requirements.,"""He's a great player but he just couldn't fit in,"" Aulas said of the 28-year-old he signed in 2010 for 22 million euros ($25million) on a five year deal worth 450,000 euros per month for the former AC Milan and Bordeaux attacking midfielder. The Lyon president was talking the morning after Paris Saint Germain's 2-1 win away at Montpellier erased their slim hopes of winning the Ligue 1 title with a game to spare. ""What would have been wonderful is if he could have proved with Lyon what a great player he is,"" Aulas told French television on Sunday. ""This is not great news for him,"" Aulas admitted. ""But it stops here."" Operating on a more modest economic system than in their heyday when they won seven straight titles between 2002-2008, the club have been offloading those remaining players on big salaries. The 31-times capped Gourcuff, France's player of the year in 2009, was infamously frozen out by star players Franck Ribery and Nicolas Anelka at France's disastrous 2010 South Africa World Cup campaign, which ended in a player strike and first round elimination. Lyon have had a successful run with a young team built with up to nine first team starters coming from not only the youth team, but also the Lyon area. Their 2014-2015 campaign, which has seen them return to the Champions League, has been marked by the emergence of Alexandre Lacazette, who has scored 27 times in the league with a game to go."
252,02/05/2015,23:17,Lyon reclaim top spot in France,Lyon reclaimed top spot in Ligue 1 on Saturday with a convincing 2-0 victory over strugglers Evian to put the pressure back on title rivals Paris Saint-Germain.,"A superb free-kick from Clement Grenier after just 20 minutes and an Alexandre Lacazette penalty seven minutes from the break gave Lyon the three points as they remain in the race for their first French league title since 2008. Lyon have the same 71 points as PSG but lead on goal difference. However, the capital city club can restore their three-point lead when they head to mid-table Nantes in Sunday's late game. ""We don't want to have any regrets in the end. There's three matches to play. We are going to get maximum points,"" said Lyon defender Henri Bedimo. ""PSG has maturity with players used to playing at the highest level and they are used to fighting for the title. ""But we're not thinking about them. We are struggling a bit at the moment but the three points were the most important thing today."" ""We believe in ourselves of course but we also have to be realistic,"" the Cameroon player added. ""We'll need a bit of help from another team but we will have to do our job too."" Lyon's victory was tarnished to a degree when Clinton Njie limped off early in the second half with what looked like a tweaked hamstring. Evian lost their 20th Ligue 1 game of the season and remain locked in 17th place, just one point away from safety. On Friday, an Andre Pierre Gignac-inspired Marseille boosted their prospects of competing in next season's Champions League win a 2-0 win over relegation-bound Metz. Gignac, out of contract at the end of the season, celebrated his 100th goal in the French top flight as the first half was drawing to a close, and then made inroads into his second century after the break. Marseille, who were desperate to put a stop to a four-match losing streak, moved provisionally above Saint-Etienne on goal difference into fourth on 60 points, two points shy of Monaco occupying the third and final Champions League spot. The Principality side host strugglers Toulouse on Sunday hoping to widen the gap with Saint-Etienne, who slipped tofifth, following their 1-0 slip up at Bastia on Saturday. Elsewhere, European hopefuls Montpellier and Bordeaux were held to goalless draws by Brittany sides Rennes and Lorient respectively. Strugglers Reims lost 2-0 to Guingamp, who are now assured of staying in the top flight, while 13th-ranked Nice and 14th-placed Caen played a 1-1 draw. On Sunday, Lille face local rivals Lens, who already now they will be playing in Ligue 2 next season as Lorient, now 15th with 39 points, are out of reach. Reims, 17th, and Evian, 18th, play each other next week, with ther winner making a huge step towards safety."

254,01/05/2015,02:20,No margin for error for PSG and Lyon as title battle heats up,Paris Saint-Germain and Lyon continue their game of cat and mouse at the top of Ligue 1 this weekend as they face Nantes and Evian respectively.,"PSG opened up a three-point lead over Lyon at the top of the table on Tuesday with a 3-1 win in their game in hand against Metz, putting the defending champions in the driver's seat with just four matches remaining. The capital club have, on paper at least, an easier route to the title as their first step takes them to mid-table Nantes, where they haven't lost since 2004. Any fears that PSG would take their foot off the gas following their deflating Champions League quarter-final exit to Barcelona have been allayed with their displays in their last two outings, a 6-1 demolition of Lille being followed by the victory against Metz. With Zlatan Ibrahimovic back from his three-match ban, Paris coach Laurent Blanc has a difficult decision over who to drop out of in-form trio Javier Pastore, Ezequiel Lavezzi and Edinson Cavani. But it is the kind of dilemma most coaches would love to have, and former France and Liverpool boss Gerard Houllier, who won titles in charge of both PSG, in 1986, and Lyon, in 2006 and 2007, believes the capital side are now poised to secure a third consecutive Ligue 1 title. ""Even if the race is still wide open, the Parisians are 80 percent favourites for me,"" the 67-year old told sports daily L'Equipe. ""For Lyon to be champions, they will have to win all of their games and hope for a PSG slip-up. But the Parisians are on the upswing."" Lyon coach Hubert Fournier also conceded his side's titles hopes are out of their hands but insisted they would give PSG a run for their money. ""We no longer hold our destiny in our hands,"" Fournier admitted ahead of the meeting with relegation-threatened Evian. ""But it's up to us to give our all right to the death so we have no regrets should Paris eventually slip up. If they don't falter, that doesn't really change anything -- we still have the desire to get the best possible result every time. ""We still believe in our chances even though we're up against a side who are having a great season, and who possess one of the best squads in Europe -- better than Chelsea, for example."" Fournier is waiting on the fitness of forward Nabil Fekir, who has a slight back problem, but will again look to 26-goal leading scorer Alexandre Lacazette as they attempt to extend a four-game unbeaten run. Leaders at Christmas, Marseille's title challenge has crumbled in 2015 and their meltdown has been so dramatic that even second-bottom Metz fancy their chances for their showdown on Friday. While Marseille are now five points adrift of a Champions League qualifying berth, Metz are eight points from safety and so could be relegated this weekend if they lose and other results go their way. Elsewhere, third-placed Monaco host strugglers Toulouse while Saint-Etienne, in fourth, go to Corsica to face Bastia. On Sunday, Lille face local rivals Lens, who are rock bottom and must win and hope other results go their way to put off an inevitable relegation back to Ligue 2.

255,20/04/2015,00:02,Lyon back on top after fiery derby draw,Ten-man Lyon came from behind to earn a savagely-contested 2-2 draw at home to bitter rivals Saint Etienne on Sunday and thereby climb back on top of Ligue 1.,"A swashbuckling Lyon played for over an hour with ten men after the referee harshly awarded a 28th minute penalty and a straight red card to Lindsay Rose for a deliberate handball. Lyon and Paris Saint-Germain both have 65 points with Lyon leading on goal-difference although Paris, who beat Nice 3-1 on Saturday, have played a game less. Lyon coach Hubert Fournier hinted that the comeback stood his side in good stead for the fight with Paris: ""It shows we have both the mental resources and the technical ability to come from behind and to believe in ourselves all the way."" The bitter derby between regional rivals was further enflamed ahead of the game by a terrace animator, a fan with a microphone, who said 'we need to crush these parasites.' No Saint Etienne supporters were there to hear it, though, as they had declined Lyon's offer of 600 seats for away fans as a protest at the meagre allocation. Lyon took the lead after a fiery start when Nabil Fekir fed Clinton Njie on 25 minutes, and his shot crept under Stephane Ruffier for a deserved lead. Referee Said Ennjimi then sent off Lyon defender Rose after he handled in a goalmouth scramble. Forward Max-Alain Gradel sent Anthony Lopes the wrong way from the spot, and wearing Ivory Coast wristbands, danced away to the corner flag in celebration. Worse was to come for the hosts as Romain Hamouma then rounded Lopes and deftly slotted home on the stroke of half-time. But shortly after the break, Lyon's Christophe Jallet stole in at a corner to produce a powerful header on the six yard line and level the scores. ""I regret the fact the players couldn't or wouldn't dare go after the win after the equaliser,"" said Saint-Etienne coach Christophe Galtier. Saint Etienne picked up five yellow cards and Lyon a further two as the game threatened to boil over, the referee doing a good job to keep control. ""This gives Paris the upper hand in the race for the title but we can count on the quality of our team and we can also hope that they slip up. We're still in with a good chance,"" Lyon president Michel Aulas said. On Saturday, Paris Saint-Germain bounced back from their Champions League humbling against Barcelona by beating Nice 3-1 in their bid for a hat-trick of Ligue 1 titles. Monaco are in third place after drawing 1-1 with Rennes on Saturday where a lapse of concentration cost them two points through a last minute goal for the visitors. They refocus now on overturning a 1-0 first-leg deficit at home to Juventus in the second leg of their Champions League quarter-final in midweek. But crucially, they failed to fully exploit fourth-placed Marseille's continued slump as Marcelo Bielsa's side went down to a 1-0 defeat at Nantes on Friday night. Saint Etienne's draw with the leaders leaves them in fifth, level with Marseille on points while Lille and Montpellier also climbed back into contention with Bordeaux for Europa League spots. Lille beat Bordeaux 2-0 as Nolan Roux headed in his fifth goal of the season after an incisive run by Sofiane Boufal, who also provided the clincher for Adama Traore. Montpellier can thank their 37-year-old Brazilian defender Vitorio Hilton, who followed up his goal, a powerful near-post header in the fourth minute, by sliding joyously and chest down through a huge puddle."
256,17/04/2015,11:30,Lyon's Lacazette says won't be lured abroad by money,"With Premier League giants Arsenal, Manchester City and Liverpool hovering, Lyon's red hot striker Alexandre Lacazette said Friday that any move abroad will be a sporting rather than financial choice.","The 23-year-old is Ligue 1's top scorer so far with 25 goals this season. His latest goal on Wednesday against Bastia lifted seven-time former champions Lyon to the top of the table ahead of Paris Saint-Germain. Discussing his future in an interview with Le Progres newspaper, he said: ""It's too early to say if I'll have opportunities abroad. It's always going to be a question of a sporting choice because financially I'm already earning enough in my life. ""And so for me to go off to Qatar next year to earn lots of cash doesn't interest me."" Born and raised in Lyon, where he emerged from the club's youth academy to break into the first team in 2010, Lacazette said he would be happy to remain a one-club player. He signed a two year extension to his contract in 2014 tying him to the side until 2018. ""To make my entire career at Lyon doesn't bother me as long as they continue to have the development and ambition to have a competitive team, even if we're not certain to win the Champions League. That's not a problem."" Lacazette opened his international scoring account in Euro 2016 hosts France's 2-0 friendly victory over Denmark last month. He scored the winning goal in the 2010 Euro Under-19 championship final for France against Spain. If he continues his rich vein of form he is comfortably on target to eclipse PSG forward Zlatan Ibrahimovic's tally of 26 goals last season and the Swede's 30-goal haul the previous campaign."
257,17/04/2015,02:25,"Wounded Paris resume title chase, Lyon face derby rivals",Paris Saint-Germain will have little time to lick their wounds following their Champions League loss to Barcelona as they turn their focus back to the Ligue 1 title race for Saturday's trip to Nice.,"PSG are staring at a third successive exit from the Champions League at the quarter-final stage after losing 3-1 at home to Barcelona in the first leg at the Parc des Princes on Wednesday. The second leg at the Camp Nou awaits next Tuesday, but Laurent Blanc's side can ill afford a slip-up when they face Nice, 650 kilometres along the Mediterranean coast, at the Allianz Riviera on Saturday afternoon. Blanc acknowledged the game is one his side ""absolutely have to win"" as they lie a point behind leaders Lyon, albeit with a game in hand. Already banned against Barcelona in midweek, Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Marco Verratti will be suspended again, while captain Thiago Silva came off with a thigh injury in the first half on Wednesday and Blanc may not be willing to risk David Luiz after he had to play 70 minutes of the Champions League game after being rushed back from a hamstring problem. Having already beaten Lyon, Monaco and Marseille this season, mid-table Nice may therefore fancy their chances as they look to pull further clear of the relegation zone. However, when asked if he thought this was a good time to face PSG, Nice coach Claude Puel replied: ""I don't think so. I would have preferred to play PSG after a good result. For them, for French football and for us. ""They didn't play as well as they would have wanted against the Catalans and they will be eager to put in a better showing against us."" Lyon reclaimed top spot on Wednesday when they beat Bastia 2-0 thanks to late goals by Mohamed Yattara and Alexandre Lacazette, the latter getting his 25th in the league this season. Hubert Fournier's side have won their last two outings to boost their title chances but now they play host to Saint-Etienne in the most passionate derby in French football at the Stade de Gerland on Sunday evening. Lyon may have home advantage but Les Verts come into the Rhone derby in great shape, a run of seven games unbeaten in the league leaving them fifth in the table, two points shy of the podium. In addition, having struggled so badly in the derby for the last two decades, Christophe Galtier's team won 3-0 at home to Lyon in November and have lost on just one of their last six visits to their rivals. ""It is a chance for us to make the supporters and the city proud. It would be great if we could repeat our performance of last season but Lyon will want revenge,"" said Saint-Etienne midfielder Jeremy Clement, who started his career with Lyon. Monaco currently occupy the third and last qualifying berth for next season's Champions League as they prepare to welcome Rennes to the Stade Louis II on Saturday. ""For me it is the key game that we have to win if we are to finish on the podium. It is the most important match in Ligue 1 this year,"" said Monaco coach Leonardo Jardim. His team are unbeaten in eight league games but this match falls between the two legs of their Champions League quarter-final tie against Juventus and captain Jeremy Toulalan could again miss out with a hamstring problem. A point behind Monaco in fourth, Marseille are at Nantes on Friday, while Bordeaux in sixth go to in-form Lille on Sunday. At the foot, the bottom two Metz and Lens meet in what is almost certainly the last chance for either to avoid the drop. Fixtures (kick-offs 1800 GMT unless stated)"
258,15/04/2015,21:32,Lyon go top of Ligue 1 after defeating Bastia,"Lyon went back to the top of Ligue 1 on Wednesday, two points in front of Paris Saint-Germain, after second-half goals from substitute Mohamed Yattara and captain Alexandre Lacazette sealed a 2-0 win at home against struggling Bastia.","PSG are now second two points behind Lyon but have a game in hand and could reclaim top spot when they host second-from-bottom Metz on April 28. The defending champions are in Champions League action against Barcelona in their first-leg quarter-final, also on Wednesday. Lyon are six points ahead of third-placed Monaco and seven on Marseille who are fourth after 32 matches. Lyon pushed hard in the first half creating several chances but came up against a tough Bastia defense and inspired goalkeeping from Alphonse Aerola. The hosts had to wait until a flurry in the final fifteen minutes to wrap up the three points as the Corsicans wilted following their 4-0 League Cup final defeat against PSG on Saturday. Yattara gave Lyon the advantage after 77 minutes when he picked up a Clement Grenier cross following a poorly cleared corner from the visiting defence. It was Grenier's first match since last August after suffering a groin injury and he had come on 15 minutes earlier in place of Steed Malbranque, while Yattara was on the pitch just two minutes in place of Nabil Fekir when he found the net. Eight minutes later Lacazette put the score 2-0 after picking up a centre from Clinton Njie for his league-leading 25th Ligue 1 goal of the season, equalling the record of Lyon's Andre Guy back in the 1968-1969 season. The goals confirmed Lyon's domination of the match, following a disappointing first half. Only Jordan Ferri (6), Njie (42) and a Fekir free kick just before the break had in any way threatened Areola, while Lacazette missed a shot off a Malbranque centre after 41 minuets. The defeat is another blow for Bastia who have taken just one point from a possible 12 in their last four matches and remain in 14th just two points above the drop zone, as they host Reims on Saturday in a game which could be crucial to their top flight status next season. Lyon meanwhile host neighbouring Saint-Etienne this weekend."
259,04/04/2015,19:47,Lyon top Ligue 1 ahead of Marseille v PSG clash,Lyon provisionally reclaimed top spot in Ligue 1 with a 3-1 win at 10-man Guingamp on Saturday as fellow title-challengers Paris Saint-Germain and Marseille go head-to-head later this weekend.,"Lyon, who won the last of their seven Ligue 1 titles in 2008, now have 61 points from 31 games, two ahead of champions Paris Saint-Germain (59) who travel to third-placed Marseille (57) on Sunday. Despite missing key players such as right-back Christophe Jallet, defensive midfielder Maxime Gonalons and forward Yoann Gourcuff, Lyon dominated in Brittany with hosts Guingamp hit by the sending off of Christophe Kerbrat just before half-time. Hubert Fournier's Lyon, who lost 2-1 at home to Nice in their last outing, sealed a comfortable victory largely thanks to French internationals Nabil Fekir and Alexandre Lacazette. ""It was important to win to remain in the title race,"" said Fournier. ""There are seven games to go and we're still here. It was a game we controlled, against a team that was waiting for us. ""We showed patience and we managed to be efficient and opportunistic as soon as we could. ""The first goal put us on the right track and afterwards we remained focussed as we controlled most of the game."" Guingamp's Jonas Lossl gifted the opener to Fekir as the Danish 'keeper failed to catch a tame effort and deflected it into his own net with just 27 minutes gone. Twelve minutes later, Lacazette doubled the lead with his seventh penalty this season, and his 24th goal of the campaign. Cameroon forward Clinton Njie sealed the deal just after the hour mark, even if Claudio Beauvue pounced on a double defensive mistake by Samuel Umtiti and Mouhamadou Dabo 10 minutes from time to grab his 12th goal of the season. Midtable Guingamp had been looking to dent Lyon's title challenge as the club's league form had picked up again after a slump. But with defensive midfielder Benjamin Angoua serving the third of his four-match ban and his replacement Kerbrat seeing red just before halftime for a foul on midfielder Jordan Ferri, the Brittany side never were in a position to make the seven-time champions tremble. Lyon provisionally leapfrog PSG, but the Parisians can strike a major blow in the title race by continuing their impressive recent record at the Stade Velodrome. Laurent Blanc's side have dominated the fixture known as 'Le Classique' in recent years, with their 2-0 win at the Parc des Princes in November their sixth in a row against Marseille. In Friday's early game, Monaco, fourth with 54 points, drew 1-1 at home to Saint-Etienne, one spot below in fifth, as both lost ground on the leading trio."
260,30/03/2015,17:54,Lyon lose Jallet for four weeks with shoulder injury,"Lyon defender Christophe Jallet will be out for up to four weeks with a left shoulder injury, the Ligue 1 club confirmed on Monday.","The 31-year-old, who spent five seasons at Paris Saint-Germain winning two French titles, picked up the injury while playing for France in their 2-0 friendly victory over Denmark on Sunday. He is the player to used most often by Lyon coach Hubert Fournier but will now miss league matches against Guingamp, Bastia, Saint-Etienne and Reims. Lyon are involved in a thrilling battle for the French title, lying one point behind defending champions Paris Saint-Germain, after 30 matches, and with Marseille third a further point adrift."
261,24/03/2015,13:59,Gourcuff out for at least a month - Lyon,"Lyon midfielder Yoann Gourcuff is set for at least a month on the sidelines after tearing a hamstring, his club said Tuesday.","Gourcuff was forced off in the 47th minute of Saturday's damaging 2-1 defeat at home to struggling Nice -- a result which allowed Paris Saint-Germain to leapfrog Lyon at the top of Ligue 1. The Lyon statement said Gourcuff will be out for four weeks and will undergo medical tests next week. It was the 20th injury suffered by the 28-year-old, who will be out of contract in June, since joining Lyon in 2010. He created a scandal against Nice as he left the field and returned to the changing rooms without informing either the referee or his team -- he has been accused several times of not caring about the team. Maxime Gonalons, another Lyon midfielder, is also due to sit out the next four weeks after suffering a similar hamstring tear. He has had to pull out of the France squad for friendlies against Brazil and Denmark later this week."
262,20/03/2015,14:11,Gourcuff gives Lyon timely boost,"Lyon's Yoann Gourcuff has recovered in time to be included in the 18-man squad set to face Nice in Saturday's Ligue 1 clash, the club announced on Friday.","Coach Hubert Fournier explained the 28-year old midfielder ""had worked hard in the past week"". ""We can be optimistic about his return to the pitch"", Fournier added before explaining a last-minute test Friday morning provided a positive reaction. The France playmaker had been ruled out of the Ligue 1 leaders' goalless draw with Marseille last week due to a thigh injury. The former French player of the year, who has been plagued by a series of injuries throughout his career, came off during his side's 5-1 victory over Montpellier two weeks ago. Lyon are two points clear of defending champions Paris Saint-Germain, who host Lorient on Friday, while Marseille, who head to Lens on Sunday, remain four points adrift of the pacesetters."
263,19/03/2015,15:21,Lyon eye Marseille forward Gignac,"Ligue 1 leaders Lyon launched an all-out charm offensive on France and Marseille's Andre-Pierre Gignac Thursday, as both the club's president and coach admitted interest in signing the forward in June.","""I really like Gignac. He is Marseille's best player,"" president Jean-Michel Aulas told 'Le Phoceen', a website that focuses on Marseille news. ""I know his contract ends in June, of course. If we had the top two French goalscorers in the same club, it would be interesting, don't you think?"" he added. ""I don't know if we can sign him but, if we have the chance of playing the Champions League, having Gignac and (Alexandre) Lacazette up front alongside (Nabil) Fekir, I don't think we could do better."" Coach Hubert Fournier also had positive things to say about Gignac. ""His contract situation could be a great opportunity. Especially as, if we qualify for the Champions League, we won't be the richest. He's a possible lead for us, among others,"" Fournier confessed. Gignac, 29, is second in the Ligue 1 scoring charts behind Lacazette but ahead of Zlatan Ibrahimovic, having found the back of the net 16 times for Marseille this season."
264,08/03/2015,23:26,Fekir inspires five-star Lyon back to top,Lyon moved back up above Paris Saint-Germain to the top of the Ligue 1 table on Sunday after Nabil Fekir inspired them to a thrilling 5-1 victory at Montpellier.,"Fekir and the league's leading scorer Alexandre Lacazette both bagged braces, and Corentin Tolisso was also on target as OL recovered from falling behind to an early Lucas Barrios goal at the Stade de la Mosson. It was a very welcome victory for Hubert Fournier's side, who won just once in five Ligue 1 outings in February, and it ensures they end the weekend where they started it, on top of the table. Reigning champions Paris Saint-Germain had temporarily gone top after easing to a 4-1 win at home to Lens on Saturday, but OL are a point clear of the capital club again, and four ahead of Marseille in third. Montpellier came into the game on a run of just one defeat in seven matches and they took the lead just six minutes in when Barrios tapped in after great work by Bryan Dabo. It was the Paraguayan's eighth goal in his last 10 Ligue 1 games, but in Fekir and Lacazette Lyon boast the most exciting attacking duo in France this season. The visitors were back level on the half-hour mark, Lacazette converting from the penalty spot after Fekir was brought down in the box by Abdelhamid El Kaoutari. And the outstanding Fekir then scored a magnificent goal to put OL in front, cutting in from the right and playing a one-two with Yoann Gourcuff before curling a shot past Geoffrey Jourdren and into the far corner of the net. It was a 10th goal of the season for the talented Fekir, who has been at the centre of a tug of war between Algeria and France, with both desperate for him to commit his international future to them. Fekir and Jordan Ferri both hit the bar in the second half before Fekir scored again to take him to 11 for the campaign, chipping in after another Gourcuff assist. Montpellier could have set up a nervy finale after they won a penalty when Samuel Umtiti was harshly adjudged to have fouled Paul Lasne in the area. However, Barrios saw his penalty saved by Anthony Lopes, and Lyon went on to add two more goals in injury time. Substitute Mohamed Yattara set up Tolisso for the fourth goal and then laid the fifth on a plate for Lacazette -- his 23rd of the season -- as Lyon repeated their 5-1 win against Montpellier in the reverse fixture in October. Earlier on Sunday, Saint-Etienne brought their seven-game winless streak to an end with a 2-0 victory over strugglers Lorient on Sunday and leapfrogged Bordeaux into fifth place, closing in on the European places. Yohan Mollo came off the bench to break the deadlock with just 15 minutes to go before Max-Alain Gradel made sure of all three points in injury time, with both goals coming after Lorient's Didier Ndong had been sent off. ""It's an important win for us. We needed it after last week's draw at Toulouse and the French Cup win,"" said Saint-Etienne coach Christophe Galtier, whose team needed penalties to win at third-tier Boulogne-sur-Mer in the Cup. ""We have had quite a few injuries lately and lost a few players so there have been some changes in the team. ""But this has given us the chance to look at some of the younger players. And the substitutes have played their part, too."" Meanwhile, Guingamp slumped to a third straight league defeat, going down 1-0 at home to Lille with Nolan Roux scoring the only goal of the game. The weekend also saw Marseille win 6-1 at Toulouse and fourth-placed Monaco triumph 3-1 away at Evian."
265,28/02/2015,19:09,Lille stun Lyon and give PSG massive boost,"Ligue 1 leaders Lyon suffered their first defeat in 12 matches on Saturday, going down 2-1 at Lille to leave second-placed Paris Saint-Germain trailing by just two points with a game in hand.","Hubert Fournier's side broke the deadlock after just three minutes when Corentin Tolisso converted a Nabil Fekir corner. However, Idrissa Gueye clawed back an equaliser in the second half after a clever one-two with Rony Lopes. And four minutes later, right on the hour mark, Manchester City loanee Lopes completed the turnaround with a nice strike from outside the box. ""A game is 90 minutes long. We can have regrets though, especially after our quality first half,"" coach Fournier said. ""We could have been more ambitious instead of sitting back. ""It's a big blow and I am angry because we missed a great opportunity. Every time we have the chance to widen the gap between us and the teams below us in the table, we slip up. I just hope we won't regret it in the coming weeks."" Tolisso's chance was Lyon's first attempt on target but it seemed to force the Ligue 1 leaders into a coma. The young midfielder netted his fifth of the season when he fired low past Vincent Enyeama following Fekir's corner, but the Nigerian goalkeeper was never really troubled after that. Meanwhile, LOSC never seemed able to trouble the leaders themselves in the first half as they looked to improve on a run of just one win in their last six league outings. However, the second half saw a complete turnaround with Gueye sparking the hosts into life by stabbing the ball past Anthony Lopes in the Lyon goal after a quick one-two with Rony Lopes inside the area. The Lyon 'keeper was once again beaten soon after when his fellow countryman curled a superb shot low into the net from just outside the area. Henri Bedimo and Christophe Jallet were both denied by Enyeama in the latter stages as Lyon pushed forward in search of an equaliser. Their defeat gives Paris the chance to climb above OL into top spot if they can win at in-form Monaco on Sunday night. OL remain four points ahead of third-placed Marseille, who suffered a shock 3-2 defeat at home to Caen on Friday after leading 2-0. Meanwhile, Lille move provisionally up to eighth before the rest of the weekend's games."
266,22/02/2015,19:13,Lyon grind out win to reclaim top spot,A scrappy goal credited to Nabil Fekir was enough for Lyon to beat Nantes 1-0 at the Stade de Gerland on Sunday and move back to the top of the Ligue 1 table.,"Hubert Fournier's side broke the deadlock midway through the second half when Yoann Gourcuff and Alexandre Lacazette combined to set up Fekir, although the final touch appeared to come off Nantes defender Kian Hansen as the ball dribbled over the line. It was Lyon's first attempt on target but the goal allowed them to make it 11 league games without defeat as they reopened a two-point gap to reigning champions Paris Saint-Germain, who beat Toulouse 3-1 on Saturday. OL are also five points ahead of third-placed Marseille, who travel to Saint-Etienne later on Sunday evening. Lyon had drawn their last three matches in the absence of 21-goal leading scorer Lacazette, but he returned after a hamstring injury to lead the line against a Nantes side still looking for their first league win of 2015. In a game of few clear chances, Nantes could have opened the scoring in the first half when Serge Gakpe broke in behind the home defence only to prod his shot wide of the far post. Lyon almost broke the deadlock five minutes before the interval as Fekir crashed a free-kick against the junction of bar and post. Apart from that, Nantes 'keeper Remy Riou was never really troubled until the goal, although he was called into action to deny substitute Clinton Njie before he conceded a penalty in stoppage time for bringing down Fekir in the box. However, with the last kick of the game, captain Maxime Gonalons missed the opportunity to score his first Ligue 1 goal in over two years as he put the penalty wide. Elsewhere on Sunday, Montpellier boosted their chances of qualifying for Europe with a 2-0 win against Guingamp in Brittany. Morgan Sanson gave the visitors a second-minute lead and Guingamp, perhaps feeling the effects of Thursday's Europa League win against Dynamo Kiev, were unable to come back into the game. Kevin Berigaud doubled Montpellier's lead in the second half and they could have won by a greater margin, but Djamel Bakar hit the bar with a late penalty. For Guingamp, it was a first defeat in eight games in all competitions and a first loss at home since November. Meanwhile, Metz remain bottom of the table on goal difference after seeing their run without a league win extended to 14 games as they drew 0-0 at Reims. On Saturday, Adrien Rabiot scored twice and Thiago Silva was also on target as PSG downed Toulouse to temporarily move above Lyon. Monaco warmed up for their Champions League trip to Arsenal in midweek by winning 1-0 at Nice in the Cote d'Azur derby on Friday night thanks to a late Bernardo Silva strike. There were also wins for Caen and SC Bastia, who are now undefeated in nine league games after coming from behind to beat Lille 2-1. Rennes and Bordeaux drew 1-1 while the game between Evian and Lorient was called off because of snow in Annecy, in the shadow of the Alps."

268,15/02/2015,23:24,Lorient stop Lyon for Ligue 1 status quo,Leaders Lyon failed to take advantage of stalemates by chasing Paris Saint-Germain and Marseille being held to a 1-1 draw at Lorient in Ligue 1 action on Sunday.,"PSG and Marseille, who were both held 2-2 over the weekend, remain two points behind Lyon, who have 51 points from 25 games. A Jordan Ayew header early in the second half stunned the French leaders before they grabbed a point when Clinton N'Jie levelled with 12 minutes to go. The Ghanaian forward, playing his first game since losing to the Ivory Coast in the Africa Cup of Nations final, was at the end of a Benjamin Jeannot cross to net his seventh goal of the season just five minutes after coming on at halftime. Struggling in Brittany, Lyon relied on N'Jie to find the net at a time when a goal seemed unlikely. The young forward profited from a Wesley Lautoa mistake, exploited by Yoann Gourcuff and Henri Bedimo, to apply a low finish past keeper Benjamin Lecomte. Jeannot, who has netted six goals in his last ten Ligue 1 games, was the first in action. Just three minutes into the game, the Lorient forward went through on goal but was denied by a diving Anthony Lopes at the first attempt and Samuel Umtiti on the rebound. Ten minutes later, it was Rafidine Abdullah's turn to give Lyon a fright with a 25-yard screamer that rattled Lopes' crossbar. Lyon had to wait for the 35th minute to get their first chance, but Nabil Fekir's low shot didn't worry Lecomte. Before that, Jeannot was again at the end of a superb collective display from Vincent Le Goff, Walid Mesloud and Raphael Guerreiro. But Umtiti was on hand to deflect the effort. The U23 France defender could only watch minutes later as Jeannot's glancing header flew just wide of the far post. Lorient played with fire after N'Jie's equaliser and can thank keeper Lecomte for a fine save as Christophe Jallet's curled strike looked like it was looping into the top corner with only five minutes remaining on the clock. The draw prevents Lyon from widening the gap at the top of the table, but it allowed Lorient to leapfrog Toulouse to sit 16th with 28 points, two points above the first relegation spot. Earlier, Bordeaux defeated Saint-Etienne 1-0 to help their chances of European football next season. A 42nd minute strike from Diego Rolan, which 'handcuffed' goalkeeper Stephane Ruffier, lifted Willy Sagnol's side level on 40 points with Monaco and one point behind fourth-placed Saint-Etienne. It was Bordeaux's first win at home since December 6, while Saint-Etienne failed to win in the league for the fifth straight outing. ""It's a great success against one of our direct rivals,"" said delighted Bordeaux coach Sagnol. ""We knew the importance of this match and could have been seven points back but now we're only one back which is within our capacities."" Guingamp added to Metz' woes with a 2-0 victory away from home. Goals from Christophe Mandanne and Jeremy Pied helped the Brittany side jump to the 10th place. Metz, who are in search of the first goal in five games, remain bottom of the league."

The player, who signed with Lyon from PSG in 2012, will undergo surgery on Thursday and will be out of action for up to six months."
270,01/02/2015,23:53,Gritty Lyon stay top after Monaco deadlock,Lyon saw their lead at the top of Ligue 1 cut to two points on Sunday but may count themselves fortunate to have come away from resurgent Monaco with a 0-0 draw.,"Seven straight wins prior to Sunday saw Lyon surge to the top of the French League, where they have 49 points, but title rivals Marseille and Paris Saint Germain are both on 47 after wins for both this weekend. Earlier Sunday, Saint Etienne went down 1-0 away to relegation strugglers Caen, but they stay fourth on 40 points, ahead of Monaco on goal difference. Monaco have much to regret as Bulgarian veteran Dimitar Berbatov missed the best chance of the first half when heading onto the post from the six yard line with Lyon 'keeper Anthony Lopez stranded. Perhaps even more fortunately Moutinho's stunning 50th minute free-kick was then disallowed after it flew into the goal without another player touching it. Referee Benoit Millot had signalled it was an indirect free-kick. Hubert Fournier, the Lyon coach, was content with the result saying: ""The least you can say is we left Monaco with a nine- point lead over them."" ""But we needed a great deal of spirit and teamwork to get this draw even if we edged the first half they got better as the game advanced,"" he added. Monaco coach Leonardo Jardim however felt his side should have won. ""We had two great chances and we should have won. I'm not happy, but it was an even game in the end."" Monaco's Croatian 'keeper Danijel Subasic has now gone 791 minutes, a record in the French top flight this season, without conceding a goal and played a key role in keeping the scores level in the first half. He first saved a fierce long range drive from France international midfielder Yoann Gourcuff, cut the angle to deny Nabil Fekir from close range, and then stretched to parry a Corentin Tolisso free-kick all in the first half. Both sides also lost key defenders with Lyon's Serbian enforcer Milan Bisevac twisting a knee and Monaco's Italian central defender Andrea Raggi also picking up a knock. Raggi ripped off part of the Monaco dug out structure in his anger as he left the field and it was revealed after the game he had knee ligament damage that will keep him out at least six weeks. In the Sunday afternoon game defender Clement Chantome made his debut for Bordeaux after closing a 15-year chapter with Paris Saint Germain with a transfer on Friday. But his side drew 1-1 with Guingamp, whose striker Claudio Beauvue's 11th league goal of the season was a peach, twisting on the edge of the area before dispatching a stunning shot into the bottom corner to open the scores on 28 minutes. Maxime Poundje's equaliser for Bordeaux on 56 minutes also helped justify the price of a match ticket, with a determined run and fierce shot. Marseille climbed back to second on Saturday with a hard-fought 1-0 home win over plucky Evian. The victory was secured when Andre-Pierre Gignac converted a 49th minute penalty, for his 14th goal of the season, after referee Frank Schneider awarded Marseille a controversial spot-kick when Dimitri Payet took a slight knock in the box. On Friday, Ezequiel Lavezzi scored the only goal as champions Paris Saint-Germain edged Rennes 1-0 rounding off a fabulous piece of teamwork from the capital outfit. The goal came on 29 minutes after a neat interchange of passes down the left between Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who was involved twice, Adrien Rabiot and Javier Pastore. The win was PSG's sixth consecutive home win in all competitions while stretching their Ligue 1 record at the Parc des Princes to eight wins and three draws. In other games Lille took a share of the spoils at Nantes in a 1-1 draw, Metz and Nice ended scoreless, Toulouse beat Reims 1-0 at home and Bastia drew 1-1 at Lens."
271,25/01/2015,17:23,Lyon lose Lacazette with thigh strain,"French league leaders Lyon will be without key striker Alexandre Lacazette after he was forced off against Metz with a thigh injury, the club announced.","Lacazette, the league's leading scorer with 21 goals, limped off after 34 minutes of Sunday's 2-0 victory which saw Lyon go four points clear at the top of the table. Coach Hubert Fournier confirmed that Lacazette would miss next week's trip to Monaco and was doubtful for the game against champions Paris Saint-Germain the following week. ""We'll have to wait for a full report from the club's medical staff before we know how long he will be out,"" Fournier said. ""We've got two important matches against title rivals and there's never a good time for these things to happen, but even less so now."" Lacazette went off shortly after opening the scoring from the penalty spot and was replaced by Maxwel Cornet."
272,20/01/2015,23:43,Bessat hat-trick ousts league leaders Lyon from Cup,French league leaders Lyon's hopes of the domestic double this season ended on Tuesday as a hat-trick by Vincent Bessat gave Ligue 1 rivals Nantes a 3-2 victory in a thrilling round of 32 French Cup clash.,"The 29-year-old -- who was born in Lyon -- scored the winner two minutes from the end of normal time to book the 'Canaries' place in the last 16. France international Lacazette had given Lyon the lead in the fifth minute but Bessat struck twice in three minutes later in the first-half to put the hosts in front. Lacazette had benefited from a glaring error by Nantes central defender Koffi Djidji, who was making his first appearance of the season. Bessat, though levelled with a rasping left-footed shot that beat Lyon 'keeper Anthony Lopes in the 19th minute after being set up by Ismael Bangoura. Minutes later Lopes was beaten by Bessat again as the Lyon defence opened up for the winger. Lyon, however, got back on level terms thanks again to an error by the unfortunate Djidji as he was caught out by the run of Nabil Fekir, who ran on to a ball delivered by Lacazette to score with just over half an hour remaining. Nantes, though, were not to be denied and Georges-Kevin Nkoudou's cross picked out Bessat at the back post and he delivered a stunning volley to win the match. Earlier the team that Lyon beat to win the 2012 French Cup Quevilly produced another famous exploit as the fourth division French side claimed the scalp of Ligue 1 side Bastia, holding their nerve to prevail 3-1 on penalties after the match finished 1-1 after extra-time. The round of 32 continues on Wednesday with the feature match French champions Paris Saint Germain playing Bordeaux where defeat for the Paris club would heap the pressure on coach Laurent Blanc."
273,17/01/2015,19:02,Goal-machine Lacazette keeps Lyon top,French strike sensation Alexandre Lacazette scored his 20th goal in 21 league matches so far this season as Lyon made short work of Lens in a 2-0 Ligue 1 away win on Saturday.,"This latest victory leaves Lyon clear at the top on 45 points, four clear of Marseille on 41, while Saint Etienne are on 39 and Paris Saint Germain 38, all three play on Sunday against Guingamp, Rennes and Evian respectively. Lyon have now won 11 of their last 13 league games and Lacazette has been the steel-tipped spearhead of that charge and is on track to eclipse the goals scored by Zlatan Ibrahimovic, top scorer in the last two Ligue 1 seasons with 30 and 26. The record is held by the Yugoslav Josip Skoblar who scored 44 for Marseille in 1970-1971. Lyon always fancied the win against a promoted side who had been banned from the transfer market and languishing second from bottom. So it was no surprise when Lens' 19-year-old central defender Jean-Philippe Gbamin scored an own goal with an astonishing back heel that left his 'keeper Rudy Riou no chance after 22 minutes. Nor was it any great surprise when Lacazette stepped up to send Riou the wrong way from the penalty spot after 26 minutes after provoking a defender into handball with his tricky movement inside the box. Lyon president Jean Michel Aulas described the 23-year-old Lacazette as better than Real Madrid's Welshman Gareth Bale, and claimed he would not sell the centre-forward even if Real dug deep for another 100 million euros. Paris Saint-Germain welcome back strikers Ezequiel Lavezzi and Edinson Cavani for their home tie with Evian after the pair were punished with three matches of exclusion after coming home late from their Christmas holiday. PSG last won a league match on December 6 and coach Laurent Blanc, who seems to be under pressure even when his side is winning, has been widely criticised in the press this week. Marseille lost the league lead last week after months top of the heap when going down 2-1 at Montpellier, but will look for a quick bounce against Guingamp, their cup conquerors the week before, at the Stade Velodrome on Sunday. On Friday Nice eased their relegation concerns with a shock 2-1 win at high-flying Bordeaux. The hosts, who could have moved up a place to fifth with victory, made light of their missing Africans on Cup of Nations duty when Diego Rolan opened the scoring from the penalty spot on 33 minutes, after goalkeeper Mouez Hassan was adjudged to have brought down Nicolas Maurice-Belay in the box. Jordan Amavi equalised midway through the second period with a deflected header from Valentin Eysseric's free-kick. And Alassane Pleas notched the winner in the final minute from Eric Bautheac's pass to snatch the three points. Later Saturday Caen host Reims, Lorient take on Lille, Montpellier travel all the way north to Metz, Nantes travel to Monaco and Toulouse await Corsicans Bastia."
274,16/01/2015,14:11,Lyon sign teenage striker Cornet,"French league leaders Lyon have signed the 18-year-old want-away striker Maxwel Cornet from Metz, the selling club said on Friday.","The under-19 international had been refusing to extend his contract which had been due to run out in June 2015, and the club had subsequently sidelined him. Lyon, winners of seven French league titles between 2002-2008, paid a fee of 400,000 euros (465,000 dollars) and also agreed a cut of any sell-on fee would go to Metz, where the player had trained since the age of seven. Cornet will join France's current striking sensation Alexandre Lacazette at Lyon, the French international who has 19 goals from 20 league games so far."
275,11/01/2015,18:57,Lyon defeat Toulouse to go top of Ligue 1,Seven-time champions Lyon are the new Ligue 1 leaders after comfortably defeating Toulouse 3-0 at the Stade Gerland on Sunday.,"Frenchman Alexandre Lacazette extended his lead at the top of the scoring charts with his 18th and 19th goals of the season while Nabil Fekir added further gloss to a perfect evening for Hubert Fournier's side as they lead the table in January for the first time since 2012. In Sunday's other early match, Nantes were held to a 0-0 draw in Brittany by Metz, a result that lifts the Canaries up to sixth while Metz climb out of the relegation zone but only ahead of Evian on goal difference. Previous leaders Marseille slumped to a 2-1 defeat at Montpellier on Friday while champions Paris Saint-Germain threw away a 2-0 lead and were beaten 4-2 by Bastia in Corisca on Saturday. Those results left Lyon one point clear of Marseille with Saint-Etienne third, three adrift, and PSG surprisingly fourth and five points back. ""It's great to be top after 20 matches but there's a long way to go and it's not finished yet,"" said Lyon captain Maxime Gonalons. ""There are some big teams out there and we can't let up because you never know what can happen in football,"" added the 25-year-old. ""Things can change quickly and we just have to concentrate on our objectives. Alexandre (Lacazette) has been incredible and he brings a lot of quality, to score two goals in four straight games shows what he can do and it's good for the club and our objectives."" Lyon's victory was their ninth straight home success and fifth straight league win as they edge closer to a first French title since 2008 when they won the last of seven in a row. Lacazette's closest rival in the scoring charts is Marseille's Andre-Pierre Gignac who is now seven back on 12 goals for the campaign. ""The result is logical but severe,"" bemoaned Toulouse coach Alain Casanova. ""We created some chances but made some mistakes which cost us, especially on the first goal which made the game more complicated for us and when they got the third goal it was all over. ""Today there was too much difference in quality between the two teams and Lyon definitely have the potential to be champions."" added Casanova. PSG's shock defeat left them in fourth place after Saint-Etienne extended their unbeaten league run to 10 games on Saturday, beating Reims 2-1 to climb up to third. Elsewhere on Saturday, Nice beat Lorient 3-1 with Carlos Eduardo's lovely volley rounding off the win. Evian and Rennes shared the spoils of a 1-1 draw, Guingamp beat Lens 2-0 while Lille beat rock bottom Caen 1-0. In the weekend's final match fifth-placed Monaco host sixth-placed Bordeaux at the Louis II stadium on the Cote d'Azur."
276,09/01/2015,14:38,League 1 game time changed for Paris attacks tribute,The French Ligue 1 match between Lyon and Toulouse has been pushed back by three hours on Sunday to respect a national tribute being held in honour of the victims of a deadly terrorist attack in Paris.,"The match had initially been planned for 1400 local time (1300GMT) but will now be played at 1700 (1600GMT), the Professional Football League (LFP) confirmed on Friday. Twelve people, including two policemen, were shot dead in the assault on the offices of the satirical weekly magazine Charlie Hebdo in central Paris on Wednesday morning. ""This change was programmed in order to respect the national homage which will be made on Sunday afternoon during the Republican walk after the attack against Charlie-Hebdo,"" a LFP spokesman said. France's professional football league had already declared that a minute's silence will also be observed at all Ligue 1 and Ligue 2 matches this weekend. The same tribute will also be observed ahead of all French rugby and basketball matches and cycling events this weekend."
277,19/12/2014,02:20,"Marseille, PSG and Lyon in three-way fight in France","Marseille, Paris Saint-Germain and Lyon head into the final round of games before Christmas this weekend looking to take the symbolic crown of Ligue 1's 'Autumn Champions'.","The significance of being on top of the table at the season's halfway stage is debatable, although PSG looked down on the rest of Ligue 1 at Christmas in each of the last two years before eventually being crowned champions in May. The capital club come into this weekend in second place, a point behind leaders Marseille, with Lyon two points off top spot in third place. OL managed to close the gap on the top two after both suffered defeats last weekend, with Paris losing for the first time in the league this season at Guingamp. Laurent Blanc's side host Montpellier at the Parc des Princes on Saturday, and there is pressure on PSG after they followed losses to Barcelona in the Champions League and then Guingamp with an unconvincing 3-1 victory at second-tier AC Ajaccio in the League Cup in midweek. ""We are a team who are going through a bad spell, and at times like that nothing smiles for you,"" said Blanc, whose biggest problem just now lies in central defence, where Brazilian duo Thiago Silva and David Luiz are struggling to find their best form. ""It is true that our defence has been a recurring problem since the start of the season, and it is something of a paradox that we also have the best defence in the league. ""Our biggest job is there, although there are other things we need to do."" Mid-table Montpellier have scored seven goals in their last two games, but PSG should be too strong for the 2012 champions, with the likes of Silva, Thiago Motta and Zlatan Ibrahimovic set to return refreshed after being rested in midweek. Before that game, Blanc had declared that some of his players would ""stay behind to recharge a little physically and mentally to be ready for the match against Montpellier"". However, visiting coach Rolland Courbis is relishing the chance to spring a surprise. ""End the year with a win at Paris Saint-Germain? Now there's a challenge,"" he said. ""I want my team to get in amongst them and bother them."" Courbis and his side host PSG in their next competitive match too as the two came out of the hat together in the French Cup draw, with the last-64 tie to be played in early January. A victory for PSG will take them above Marseille, at least before Marcelo Bielsa's side play on Sunday at home to Lille. The visitors come into the game fresh from beating Bordeaux on penalties in the League Cup on Wednesday night and must now try to stop OM recording a ninth straight league win at the Stade Velodrome. Lyon, meanwhile, travel to Bordeaux chasing a fourth successive league win and a return to form after being eliminated from the League Cup on penalties by Monaco. Forward Yassine Benzia is ruled out of the game for Lyon but they received a boost on Wednesday when playmaker Yoann Gourcuff made his comeback after his latest two-month spell on the sidelines due to injury. As for Monaco, the principality club are themselves riding the crest of a wave with their League Cup qualification following progression to the Champions League last 16 and last Sunday's 1-0 win over Marseille which left them sixth in the table. However, after going all the way to penalties on Wednesday, and with the likes of Ricardo Carvalho, Layvin Kurzawa, Geoffrey Kondogbia and Dimitar Berbatov all on the sidelines, Monaco coach Leonardo Jardim is less than pleased about having to go to Metz on Saturday. ""It is hard physically to put all these games together. It would have been more logical to play on Sunday,"" he moaned."
278,12/12/2014,22:43,Lyon win again to close gap at top,Ligue 1's leading scorer Alexandre Lacazette grabbed a brace as Lyon beat struggling Caen 3-0 on Friday to make it eight consecutive home wins.,"Lacazette's early penalty set OL on their way and the France striker struck again just before the hour mark, with Yassine Benzia then making sure of the victory. Hubert Fournier's side have won eight of their last 10 Ligue 1 games and remain third in the table, although they are now only two points adrift of leaders Marseille, who go to Monaco on Sunday. Caen had gone six matches without a win to sink into the relegation zone and their evening got off to a bad start as Jean-Jacques Pierre was harshly adjudged to have fouled Nabil Fekir inside the area in seven minutes. Lacazette beat his old team-mate Remy Vercoutre from the spot to set Lyon on their way, although the second goal did not arrive until the 58th minute. Samuel Umtiti headed down a corner for Lacazette to lash home his 15th goal of a fine campaign on the volley at the back post, and Benzia then drilled a low shot into the net from 16 yards four minutes later. Only Vercoutre kept the score remotely respectable for Caen, as he saved another penalty, this time taken by Fekir, and then turned a Rachid Ghezzal free-kick onto a post in the latter stages. As well as closing the gap on Marseille, Lyon are also now just one point behind reigning champions Paris Saint-Germain, who visit Guingamp on Sunday."
279,30/11/2014,22:53,Saint Etienne end Lyon hoodoo,"Saint Etienne beat Lyon 3-0 in France on Sunday, their first home win over their local rivals in twenty years, after Ligue 1's top two Marseille and Paris Saint Germain also won this weekend.","Moustapha Sall and Ricky Van Wolfswinkel had given Saint Etienne a 2-0 lead by half-time and Renaud Cohade finished the job in the 69th minute. The result sent a wave of joy round the stadium as it ended a run dating back to April 1994 and a series of seven home defeats by their bitter local rivals. Playing with a five-man defence the home side were rarely troubled by Lyon's 4-4-2 but breathed huge sighs of relief when Lyon striker Alexandre Lacazette missed a sitter at 1-0 before also sending a penalty wide in the 79th minute. Marseille remain top on 34 points after their 2-0 home win over Nantes on Friday while the champions Paris Saint Germain are second on 33 after their 1-0 win over Nice on Saturday. Lyon had gone 10 games unbeaten since the beginning of September to climb to third in the table, where they still remain on 27 points ahead of Bordeaux in fourth on goal difference. Bordeaux remained in the hunt for a Champions League place after a 1-0 win over Lille, thanks to a goal by giant Mali striker Cheick Diabate. Meanwhile, Lille, the 2011 champions, remain 14th and just two points above the relegation zone. It was a welcome return to form for Bordeaux, who lost last week at Marseille to drop three points off the Champions League places. But in maintaining one of only two unbeaten home records in Ligue 1 -- the other belonging to PSG -- Willy Sagnol's side kept in the European hunt. Lille's lethargy could only partly be explained by a draining trip to Krasnodar, in the heart of Russia, for a Europa League match on Thursday, but tired legs could not be blamed entirely for such an insipid display and lack of fight. Bordeaux could have gone in front as early as the third minute but Thomas Toure's shot came back off the post and Diego Rolan was flagged offside as he knocked in the rebound. Lille, who have not won for two months, largely contained Bordeaux's four-pronged attack in the first 45 minutes and even rattled their hosts five minutes from the break when Cedric Carrasso had to make a one-handed save to deny Roux. Toure hit the post again on 50 minutes direct from a corner that caused confusion in the visiting defence. But they finally broke the deadlock just after the hour mark as 6ft 4in (1.94m) Diabate converted a cross from Nicolas Maurice-Belay to score his sixth goal of the season. PSG are the only unbeaten side but still trail Marseille despite Saturday's ninth consecutive win in all competitions. Sweden striker Ibrahimovic stroked home the spot-kick just past the hour mark after Nice defenders Jordan Amavi and Romain Genevois had cleaned out Lucas in the box. Florian Thauvin scored one goal and set up the second at the Stade Velodrome on Friday evening. Thauvin deftly converted a Dimitri Payet cross and then saw his free-kick headed home by Rod Fanni as Marseille claimed a seventh successive home victory, their best run at the Velodrome since their 2009-10 title-winning campaign."
280,22/11/2014,19:17,Lyon miss chance to go second after Bastia draw,"Lyon extended their unbeaten Ligue 1 streak to ten matches on Saturday, with a hard-fought 0-0 draw at Bastia, but wasted the opportunity to climb above Marseille into second spot.","Hubert Fournier, who has enjoyed just two victories in nine trips to Corsica as a player, looked on as the seven-time champions failed to break down the rugged home defence. The league's top scorer Alexandre Lacazette was kept quiet and failed to add to his 11 goals this season. Marseille's Andre-Pierre Gignac, who is on ten goals, will be in action at the Velodrome on Sunday when Marcelo Bielsa's side host Bordeaux. The draw also ended Lyon's five match winning run and they next travel to arch-rivals Saint-Etienne next Sunday. ""It was a very difficult match because they pressed us high up the pitch and made it very hard to get our passing game going,"" said Lyon's French midfielder Maxime Gonalons. ""It's a good point for us and it's never easy to come here and win but we kept our streak going and we just have to continue to pick up results,"" he added. On Friday, Paris Saint-Germain went top for the first time this season with a 3-2 win at mid-table Metz, as star forward Zlatan Ibrahimovic made his first start in two months. Argentines Javier Pastore and Ezequiel Lavezzi scored either side of a Gaetan Bussman own goal for the visitors, who remain unbeaten this season. PSG now lead Marseille by two points with Lyon one further back in third ahead of four matches later on Saturday. Guingamp host Rennes in the Brittany derby, a repeat of last season's French Cup final, while Lorient are at home to Lens, Caen travel to Monaco and Nice host Reims. On Sunday, fifth-placed Nantes host Saint-Etienne who are sixth, Toulouse are in Montpellier and Lille v Evian has been postponed to January 7 due to the ongoing tennis Davis Cup final at their home ground between France and Switzerland."

The Lyon striker, 23, who has three caps, has found the target 10 times in league action this season to join Marseille's Andre-Pierre Gignac as the top flight's best marksman. There were also recalls for Saint-Etienne's Loic Perrin, fellow defender Benoit Tremoulinas of Sevilla and Wolfsburg midfielder Joshua Guilavogui. Gignac is also in the squad, and a possibility with Lacazette, to link up with Real Madrid striker Karim Benzema while Tottenham goalkeeper Hugo Lloris will captain the side. Rennes 'keeper Benoit Costil retains his place in the squad, with Saint-Etienne custodian Stephane Ruffier unavailable, and he will lend support to Lloris and number two 'keeper Steve Mandanda of Marseille."

The club said in a statement the former Rennes, AC Milan and Bordeaux star, who is the son of Algeria coach Christian Gourcuff, will ""undergo a rigorous rehabilitation process in order for Yoann to be healthy as soon as possible"" It is the 17th injury suffered by Gourcuff since arriving at Lyon in 2010 while he has never played more than seven straight matches for the club without breaking down."

Marseille beat Caen 2-1 away Saturday and are runaway leaders on 22 points, Bordeaux second on 17, while Lille and Nantes both have 15 and defending champions PSG are on 14. Lille had to play without eight first choice players and also had their coach Rene Girard sent off for the second time this season. They have now lost twice and drawn one of their last three league games. For Lyon, former France player of the year Yoann Gourcuff finally got a place in the starting line-up as his form comes back and he set up the first goal for Lacazette in the 39th minute. The 23-year-old striker with three France caps took his league tally to seven with another strike just on half-time and his hat-trick put the gloss on a fine days work when he wrapped up victory with six minutes to play. Saint-Etienne could have climbed to second place above Bordeaux with a home win but lost 1-0 at home to Toulouse thanks to Wissam Ben Yedder's sixth Ligue 1 goal this season. Saint Etienne have suffered two defeats and a draw in their last three league outings. With his fist ever top-flight goal Nantes' teenager Georges-Kévin Nkoudou grabbed the winner that took the Canaries up to fourth and edged Guingamp 1-0 in the Brittany derby."
284,02/09/2014,18:23,"Football: Lacazette, Gourcuff agree new Lyon deals","France striker Alexandre Lacazette has agreed a new two-year contract with Lyon, the club's president Jean-Michel Aulas announced on Tuesday.","It ties the 23-year-old to the Ligue 1 side until 2018, with Aulas confirming that agreement had been reached after ""lengthy discussions"". The striker has already scored three league goals this season and could add to his two caps for France after being called up for Thursday's friendly with Spain and Sunday's game against Serbia. Meanwhile, talented but injury-prone playmaker Yoann Gourcuff has agreed to a pay cut although not to an extension to his existing deal, which expires next summer. The 28-year-old, a big-money signing from Bordeaux in 2010, has been plagued by injuries in his time at the Stade de Gerland. ""It was a question of making mutual concessions that show that everyone wants the best for Olympique Lyonnais,"" said Aulas. Lyon have had a difficult start to the new season, losing three of their four Ligue 1 games and being eliminated from the Europa League at the play-off stage."

Briand, who turned 29 earlier this month, admitted he was ""curious to experience the league in the country of the world champions after playing in France for so many years."" Briand started his career with Rennes before moving to Lyon in 2010 and scoring 22 goals in 110 Ligue 1 appearances at the Stade de Gerland.

Grenier made his competitive return on Thursday, coming on as second-half substitute, in a shock 2-1 home defeat to Romanian side Astra Giurgiu in the first leg of the Europa League play-off round. Lyon boss Hubert Fournier's decision to throw on Grenier with 15 minutes remaining backfired with the midfielder conceding a penalty that led to the visitors' winning goal before finishing the contest doubled over in pain. ""We put him in the game. There was a one in two chance (of a relapse). It didn't work out in our favour. It's not the worst thing though because it means he will undergo an operation,"" said Fournier. ""He will be sidelined for six to eight weeks. Afterwards things will be resolved because for the past so many months we've been carrying a player who isn't 100 per cent,"" he added."

289,17/07/2014,18:28,Lyon complete signing of Lindsay Rose,French Ligue 1 club Lyon on Thursday confirmed the signing of under-21 international defender Lindsay Rose from Valenciennes on a four-year deal.,"Lyon did not confirm the transfer fee paid for the defender, but it is thought to be under 2 million euros (£1.58m, $2.7m). Rose, who spent just 18 months at Valenciennes and was out injured for much of last season as the northern club were relegated to the second tier, signed on at the Stade de Gerland until the summer of 2018. He is Lyon's first recruit of the summer but coach Hubert Fournier denied that the arrival of Rose will definitely see fellow defender Samuel Umtiti depart. ""We don't want him or Clement Grenier to leave but they have asked to be allowed to depart if another club offers them the chance to progress in their careers,"" said Fournier. The 23-year-old midfielder Grenier was named in France's World Cup squad before withdrawing due to injury."
