0,13/02/2021,17:38,Haaland spares Dortmund blushes,A late equaliser from Erling Braut Haaland spared Borussia Dortmund's blushes on Saturday as they drew 2-2 at home against Bundesliga rivals Hoffenheim.,"Haaland's 81st minute strike averted a fourth defeat in five Bundesliga games for crisis-hit Dortmund. Yet even a draw leaves Dortmund three points adrift of the Champions League places in sixth, and heaps more pressure on interim coach Edin Terzic. Dortmund have won just four of ten league games since Terzic took the reins from Lucien Favre in December, prompting growing speculation over his future. Yet veteran defender Mats Hummels defended his coach on Saturday and backed Dortmund to revive their season. ""It's never the case that things are exactly how you want them a few weeks after a new coach takes over. That wasn't the case years ago under Jurgen Klopp, and it isn't the case now under Edin,"" Hummels told Sky. ""We're working hard, and success will come,"" he added. England international Jadon Sancho gave Dortmund a perfect start, racing up the left-wing to score his fourth league goal this season on 24 minutes. The lead didn't last long, as Munas Dabbur scuffed a shot past Marwin Hitz to level just seven minutes later. Ihlas Bebou bundled in Hoffenheim's second just after half-time, the ball bouncing off the Togolese and into the goal as Hitz tried to beat away a dangerous cross from the left wing. Haaland had a goal ruled out for offside in the second half before pouncing on a misplaced pass to snatch a crucial late equaliser. Fellow Champions League hopefuls Bayer Leverkusen also dropped points after they conceded two late goals to draw 2-2 with strugglers Mainz. Lucas Alario tapped in a low Moussa Diaby cross to give Leverkusen the lead on 14 minutes. Patrik Schick appeared to have sealed three points with a second on 84 minutes. Yet second-from-bottom Mainz were rewarded for a brave performance as late goals by Robert Glatzel and Kevin Stoeger saved a point and continued their recent revival under new coach Bo Svensson. Elsewhere, Werder Bremen were held to a 0-0 draw at home to Freiburg while Sami Khedira helped rescue a 1-1 draw for Hertha Berlin against boyhood club Stuttgart. ""It was the first time I'd ever played against Stuttgart so it was strange, but it was nice to come back,"" Khedira, who joined Hertha from Juventus in January after a decade abroad, told Sky. Austrian striker Sasa Kalajdzic headed in his ninth goal of the season to give Stuttgart the lead at the end of a scrappy first half. Veteran midfielder Khedira came off the bench in the second-half and set up a late equaliser for 17-year-old Luca Netz to save the capital club from a fifth straight defeat."
1,29/01/2021,03:03,Hoffenheim plot new Bayern shock on Munich return,"As the architect of Bayern Munich's single defeat in 2020, Hoffenheim coach Sebastian Hoeness hopes to again down the European champions in the Bundesliga on Saturday when he returns to his former club.","Bayern host mid-table Hoffenheim at the Allianz Arena seeking revenge for September's 4-1 league defeat - their only loss of 2020 in any competition. The shock win over the European champions ""will certainly still be in our heads,"" admitted Hoeness, ""but we want to use this game to annoy Bayern again"". Bayern hold a seven-point lead in the table and are near full-strength with only Corentin Tolisso and Tanguy Nianzou sidelined. After poor results around Christmas, Hoffenheim are back up to 11th thanks to back-to-back 3-0 wins against strugglers Hertha Berlin and Cologne. However, the European champions are a huge test for Hoffenheim on Hoeness' return to Munich, where the 38-year-old coached the reserves last season having previously worked with Bayern's junior teams. A key factor Saturday is the form of Hoffenheim striker Andrej Kramaric, who has scored twice in each of his last two games. Leading the pack chasing Bayern, RB Leipzig host Bayer Leverkusen on Saturday night with both clubs eager to bounce back from defeats. After crashing 3-2 at second-from-bottom Mainz, Leipzig coach Julian Nagelsmann compared Bayern to Germany's high-speed ICE trains and his team to a regional train, struggling to ""catch up"". In order to get back on track, Leipzig must beat third-placed Leverkusen, who trail them by three points. ""The game has no direct influence on the title race - it's all about qualifying for the Champions League,"" Nagelsmann insisted Thursday. Leipzig welcome back Yussuf Poulsen after a groin injury, but playmaker Emil Forsberg is sidelined by a knee knock. Leverkusen, who crashed at home to Wolfsburg last weekend, are missing midfielders Julian Baumgartlinger, who underwent knee surgery on Monday, and Nadiem Amiri, who is quarantined after testing positive for Covid-19. Having slipped out of the European places to seventh, Dortmund host Augsburg on Saturday chasing a first win in four games. ""We have to correct mistakes from set-pieces,"" said caretaker coach Edin Terzic after Dortmund conceded three goals from deadball situations in a 4-2 defeat at Gladbach. Erling Braut Haaland scored twice in the Gladbach defeat, but Dortmund need him and England winger Jadon Sancho to fire their attack. ""When they (Augsburg) make mistakes, we have to be there - ice-cold,"" added Terzic. Eintracht Frankfurt, who are a point above Dortmund in the table and bouyed by a 5-1 thrashing of Bielefeld, are home on Saturday to Hertha Berlin, where Pal Dardai is back in charge. The 44-year-old replaces Bruno Labbadia, who was sacked following their 4-1 thrashing at home by Werder Bremen. Frankfurt striker Luka Jovic has scored three goals in three appearances off the bench since returning on loan from Real Madrid. Dardai predicts it could be ""5-4 or 6-5"" at Frankfurt, who ""score a lot of goals.... we're going there to score one more"". The Croatia striker scored twice in last September's 4-1 win over Bayern and has also netted two goals in Hoffenheim's recent wins against Hertha and Cologne. He is back in form after contracting Covid-19 on international duty last October which sidelined him for seven games. Kramaric will test Bayern's defence and his four goals in two games, ""speak for themselves,"" said Hoffenheim coach Hoeness. 76 - the minutes Luka Jovic has needed for three goals off the bench having been loaned back to Eintracht Frankfurt after failing to settle at Real. 18 - home league games since Bayern last lost at the Allianz Arena when Leverkusen managed a 2-1 win in November 2019. 1 - the single victory Hoffenheim has managed at the Allianz Arena, poaching a 2-1 win in Munich in October 2019.

2,10/01/2021,17:55,Stuttgart romp to first league win since thrashing Dortmund,Stuttgart romped to a 4-1 triumph at 10-man Augsburg on Sunday to earn their first Bundesliga win since thrashing Borussia Dortmund last month.,"Stuttgart claimed their fifth away win this season after taking the lead at Augsburg thanks to Argentine striker Nicolas Gonzalez's early penalty which came when his south American compatriot Mateo Klimowicz was fouled in the area. Stuttgart were 2-0 up at half-time after Congolese winger Silas Wamangituka finished a counter-attack with his first goal since netting twice in the 5-1 win at Dortmund which ultimately cost Lucien Favre his job. Augsburg pulled a goal back almost immediately after the break when midfielder Marco Richter fired home from close range after Swiss winger Ruben Vargas prised open the defence. Stuttgart captain Gonzalez Castro fired his side 3-1 up on the hour mark when he banged home a long pass to the far post. Soon after, Richter received his second booking inside three minutes and was shown a red card after accidentally kicking the Achilles tendon of Waldemar Anton. The Stuttgart defender had the last laugh when his cross to the far post was tapped home by substitute Daniel Didavi three minutes before the whistle. After two defeats and a draw in their previous three league games, the victory lifts Stuttgart above Augsburg into 10th. Bayern Munich remain top of the Bundesliga despite crashing to a 3-2 loss at Borussia Moenchengladbach on Friday while second-placed RB Leipzig lost 3-1 at home on Saturday to Dortmund, the only top six team to win this weekend."
3,02/01/2021,23:20,Olmo fires RB Leipzig top of Bundesliga ahead of Bayern Munich,RB Leipzig dislodged Bayern Munich at the top of the Bundesliga table Saturday as Dani Olmo's second-half goal was enough to seal a 1-0 win at Stuttgart.,"""It was really good for me and the team to start the year with a win,"" Olmo told DAZN. With European champions Bayern at home to strugglers Mainz on Sunday, Leipzig took the chance to go a point ahead as Olmo fired through the legs of Stuttgart goalkeeper Gregor Kobel. Stuttgart's Swiss shot-stopper had earlier pulled off some heroics by using his foot to save a Emil Forsberg first-half penalty attempt. Leipzig also wasted a golden chance when Amadou Haidara fired wide just after the break. With 23 minutes left, Spain midfielder Olmo finally got the breakthrough, finishing a move he started after Leipzig had moved the ball across the Stuttgart penalty area. ""It feels good to be top,"" admitted Leipzig defender Willi Orban. ""The first half was good, the second was better - we were clearly the dominant team."" Earlier, Bayer Leverkusen blew the chance to take first place after stumbling to a 2-1 defeat at Eintracht Frankfurt which saw them drop to third as the league resumed after a two-week break. ""I have made my feelings clear in the dressing room,"" Leverkusen head coach Peter Bosz told Sky. ""We deserved to lose. Frankfurt had a better claim to the victory."" Leverkusen midfielder Nadiem Amiri scored with a deft back-heel flick to give the visitors the lead after only 10 minutes in Frankfurt. However, Amin Younes equalised to make it 1-1 at half-time before Japan midfielder Daichi Kamada put in a cross which Leverkusen defender Edmond Tapsoba turned into his own net. Before kickoff, Frankfurt director Fredi Bobic confirmed reports his club are interested in Bayern's teenage striker Joshua Zirkzee, 19, after selling Dutch forward Bas Dost to Brugge. Zirkzee could back up Frankfurt's top scorer Andre Silva, who has notched nine league goals this season. Union Berlin rose to fourth - into the Champions League places for the first time in the club's history - after their 2-0 win at Werder Bremen. Liverpool loanee Taiwo Awoniyi, who has scored in his last three league games, capped another impressive display with a goal and assist. After Bremen lost the ball in their own half, the 23-year-old Nigeria international took advantage of a two-on-two situation by drawing the defence and passing to Sheraldo Becker, who fired home on 12 minutes. Awoniyi doubled Union's lead on 28 minutes by tapping the ball over the line, just out of the reach of Bremen goalkeeper Jiri Pavlenka. Bremen had a penalty appeal turned down when a shot by Japan midfielder Yuya Osako clipped the hand of a Union defender, then Romano Schmid had a goal ruled offside. Hoffenheim lost both defender Kevin Akpoguma and Germany midfielder Sebastian Rudy with early leg injuries as they crashed to a 3-1 home defeat to Freiburg. With the hosts struggling to reshuffle, Freiburg were 3-0 up at half-time thanks to a Baptiste Santamaria goal, a Vincenzo Grifo penalty and an own goal by Senegal defender Kasim Adams. Hoffenheim scored a second-half consolation goal through Togo winger Ihlas Bebou. Borussia Moenchengeladbach, who host Manchester City in the first leg of the Champions League last 16 next month, earned their first win in five league games with a 1-0 victory at Arminia Bielefeld. Swiss striker Breel Embolo netted the winning goal just after half-time when he held off a defender and fired home. Mid-table Augsburg rebounded after back-to-back defeats with a 1-0 win at Cologne with Brazilian winger Iago netting the late winner. Bottom side Schalke are now 30 games without a win -- one short of the Bundesliga record -- after a 3-0 defeat away to Hertha Berlin. Former Tottenham manager Christian Gross, installed as Schalke's fourth head coach this season, got off to a losing start as Arsenal loanee Matteo Guendouzi, Colombia striker Jhon Cordoba and his replacement, Poland forward Krzysztof Piatek, scored for Hertha. Having netted two minutes after coming off the bench, Piatek had a second late goal ruled offside."
4,13/12/2020,20:48,Bailey fires Leverkusen top as late goal denies winless Schalke,"Jamaica winger Leon Bailey scored twice as Bayer Leverkusen knocked Bayern Munich off the top of the Bundesliga with a 4-1 win against Hoffenheim on Sunday, while bottom side Schalke saw their winless run stretch to 27 games in a dramatic 2-2 draw with Augsburg.","Bailey opened the scoring with a scintillating strike early on against Hoffenheim as in-form Leverkusen picked up their seventh win of the season to leapfrog champions Bayern into top spot. ""The table is only a snapshot, but it's an important one because we know how tough this league can be,"" said midfielder Julian Baumgartlinger after Leverkusen went top for the first time in six years. Hoffenheim's Florian Grillitsch brushed the bar with a header after just 14 seconds, but it was Leverkusen who landed the first blow on four minutes. Playing a quick one-two with Nadiem Amiri from a Leverkusen corner, Bailey curled the ball brilliantly into the top corner from the edge of the penalty area. A misjudged pass from Andrej Kramaric allowed Bailey to double the lead just before the half-hour mark, rounding stranded goalkeeper Oliver Baumann and slotting the ball into the open goal from 20 yards out. Baumann kept his side in the game with a flying save to deny Florian Wirtz just before half-time, and Christoph Baumgartner pulled a goal back with a brilliant long-range strike after the break. Yet Hoffenheim's joy was short-lived, as Wirtz danced through the box and beat Baumann with a dainty chip on 55 minutes. The visitors' fate was sealed when both Grillitsch and Stefan Posch were sent off for second yellow cards within 15 minutes, and Lucas Alario added a fourth for Leverkusen with a stoppage-time penalty. Earlier Sunday, Schalke's hopes of a first win in 27 games were dashed by Marco Richter's stoppage-time equaliser in a 2-2 draw overshadowed by a serious injury to Mark Uth. Richter's late header crowned a heartbreaking evening for Schalke, who remain on course to equal Tasmania Berlin's notorious, 54-year-old Bundesliga record of 31 games without a win. Schalke's misery was compounded by concerns for Uth, who was stretchered from the field unconscious after a clash of heads with Augsburg defender Felix Uduokhai in the 10th minute. The striker was treated on-field for around 15 minutes before being carried from the pitch attached to a drip and wearing a neck brace. Schalke later confirmed that the 29-year-old was ""stable and responsive"" and on his way to hospital, but both sets of players were left visibly shocked by the incident. ""I didn't realise how serious it was at first, but then I saw him lying on the floor. A lot of things go through your head, I was scared and worried. I am so happy that he is ok,"" Uduokhai told Sky. After the game resumed with a 15-minute delay, Augsburg took the lead from a corner in the 32nd minute, Suat Serdar accidentally heading the ball into his own net. Benito Raman levelled the scores with a delicate chip over goalkeeper Rafal Gikiewicz on 52 minutes, before a second yellow card for Florian Niederlechner dealt another blow to Augsburg moments later. Serdar then redeemed himself as he fired a low cross towards Nassim Boujellab, who smashed the ball past Gikiewicz to give Schalke the lead. Yet Richter dashed hopes of a first league win since January 17 when he flicked a Michael Gregoritsch cross past Ralf Faehrmann two minutes from time to save a point for 10-man Augsburg. The draw leaves Schalke bottom of the league, with just four points from 11 games this season."
5,13/12/2020,18:20,Injury-time goal keeps Schalke winless after Uth injury scare,Bundesliga crisis club Schalke saw their winless run extended to 27 games on Sunday after Augsburg forward Marco Richter snatched a stoppage-time equaliser in a 2-2 draw overshadowed by a serious injury to Mark Uth.,"Richter's late header crowned a heartbreaking evening for Schalke, who remain on course to equal Tasmania Berlin's notorious, 54-year-old Bundesliga record of 31 games without a win. Schalke's misery was compounded by concerns for Uth, who was stretchered from the field unconscious after a clash of heads with Augsburg defender Felix Uduokhai in the 10th minute. ""It was a very worrying moment with Mark. He will stay in hospital overnight and we are crossing our fingers for him,"" Schalke technical director Sascha Riether told Sky. The striker was treated on-field for around 15 minutes before being carried from the pitch attached to a drip and wearing a neck brace. Schalke later confirmed that the 29-year-old was ""stable and responsive"" and on his way to hospital, but both sets of players were left visibly shocked by the incident. After the game resumed with a 15-minute delay, Augsburg took the lead from a corner in the 32nd minute, Suat Serdar accidentally heading the ball into his own net. Uduokhai later clashed heads with another Schalke player, Nassim Boujellab, who played on with bandages on his head. Schalke came out fighting in the second half, and Benito Raman levelled the scores with a delicate chip over goalkeeper Rafal Gikiewicz on 52 minutes. Augsburg's Florian Niederlechner was sent off for a second yellow card several minutes later after colliding with Schalke defender Salif Sane in another aerial duel. Serdar redeemed himself shortly afterwards as he fired a low cross towards Boujellab, who smashed the ball past Gikiewicz to give Schalke the lead. Yet Richter dashed hopes of a first league win since January 17 when he flicked a Michael Gregoritsch cross past Ralf Faehrmann two minutes from time to save a point for 10-man Augsburg. The draw leaves Schalke bottom of the league, with just four points from 11 games this season."
6,28/11/2020,17:41,Lewandowski hits 15th goal of season as Bayern Munich stay top,Robert Lewandowski claimed his 15th goal this season in all competitions as Bundesliga leaders Bayern Munich came from behind to claim a 3-1 win at Stuttgart on Saturday.,"After 19-year-old striker Tanguy Coulibaly gave Stuttgart a shock early lead, Kingsley Coman equalised before Lewandowski drilled home from 20 metres to put Bayern 2-1 up at the break. Brazil winger Douglas Costa, a second-half replacement for Coman, grabbed Bayern's third goal late on to seal the win which leaves the holders two points clear of RB Leipzig. Dortmund are third, four points behind Bayern, after crashing to a shock 2-1 defeat at home to Cologne, as Leipzig climbed above them thanks to a 2-1 home win over Arminia Bielefeld. Cologne avoided a club record 19th match without a win with their first victory in Dortmund since 1991."
7,21/11/2020,23:11,Haaland scores four as Dortmund cut Bayern's lead,Erling Braut Haaland netted four goals and Youssoufa Moukoko became the youngest player in Bundesliga history on Saturday as Borussia Dortmund routed Hertha Berlin 5-2 to trim Bayern Munich's lead at the top of the table to just a point.,"It was the first time the 20-year-old Haaland had scored four goals in a game for Dortmund since his January debut, with all of them coming in the second half. ""I drank a Red Bull at half time, I got some wings and everything was good,"" said Haaland. The Norwegian now has 10 goals in seven Bundesliga matches this season to give him a total of 31 goals in 30 games in all competitions for Dortmund. After Matheus Cunha gave Hertha a first-half lead at Berlin's Olympic Stadium, Dortmund roared back. Haaland equalised when he tapped home an Emre Can pass on 47 minutes. He grabbed his second two minutes later with perfect timing to slip his marker and fire in a Julian Brandt pass. Haaland wrapped up his hat-trick on 62 minutes, just before Raphael Guerreiro stabbed the ball home from close range to make it 4-1. Cunha converted a late penalty, but the night belonged to Haaland who finished a move he started with 10 minutes to play. There was still time for history to be made as Moukoko made a late cameo off the Dortmund bench to replace Haaland. One day after his 16th birthday, Moukoko is the youngest player in Bundesliga history. ""He's only just turned 16 -- that is amazing,"" Haaland said of Moukoko. ""He has a big career ahead of him."" Dortmund's romp in Berlin moved them second in the standings, behind defending champions Bayern who stayed top despite a 1-1 home draw with Werder Bremen. Germany goalkeeper Manuel Neuer produced great stops to twice deny US forward Josh Sargent as Bremen earned their first point at Bayern for a decade. ""We had to invest a lot,"" Neuer told Sky. The 34-year-old bounced back after conceding six goals in Germany's crushing defeat by Spain in midweek with two brilliant first-half saves in quick succession. He used a boot to block a Sargent shot, then lunged across goal to save from Ludwig Augustinsson. In the dying stages, Neuer then stood tall to block a shot by Sargent, who had broken clear. Bayern coach Hansi Flick was far from pleased that Bremen took the lead in his 50th game in charge, saying his team ""have to defend better"". Bremen deservedly went ahead just before half-time when midfielder Maximilian Eggestein finished off a superb attack. ""We conceded a very cheap goal, that's how Bremen's plan worked and they defended very well,"" said Bayern forward Thomas Mueller. Kingsley Coman equalised in the 62nd minute at the Allianz Arena by meeting a Leon Goretzka cross at the far post. Bayern forward Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting fired over with the goal at his mercy five minutes from time. However, Neuer's heroics at the other end preserved the draw. Bayer Leverkusen are third after their 2-1 win at strugglers Arminia Bielefeld thanks to Aleksandar Dragovic's late winner. The victory was a relief for Leverkusen goalkeeper Lukas Hradecky, who scored a embarrassing own goal early in the second half. Leverkusen were 1-0 up thanks to a Leon Bailey goal when Hradecky sliced a clearance, which rolled into the empty net behind him. Dragovic stabbed home from close range two minutes from time to spare Hradecky's blushes. RB Leipzig sit fourth after Yussuf Poulsen came off the bench and produced a deft second-half volley in their 1-1 draw at Eintracht Frankfurt after winger Aymen Barkok gave the hosts an early lead. Despite having seven players quarantined with the coronavirus, a depleted Hoffenheim drew 3-3 at home with Stuttgart. Schalke's winless run stretched to 24 league games, dating back to January, after losing 2-0 at home to Wolfsburg. A Daniel Caligiuri equaliser two minutes from time gave 10-man Augsburg a 1-1 draw at Borussia Moenchengladbach."
8,07/11/2020,18:33,"Leipzig go top in Germany ahead of Bayern, Dortmund showdown",RB Leipzig went back to the top of the Bundesliga table on Saturday with a 3-0 home win over Freiburg before Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund clash in the evening showdown.,"Defender Ibrahima Konate fired home Leipzig's opener before midfielder Marcel Sabitzer added their second goal with a 70th-minute penalty. Manchester City loanee Angelino claimed Leipzig's third with a stunning free-kick which curled over the Freiburg wall just before the final whistle. The home win put Leipzig top, a point ahead of Bayern and Dortmund who meet later at Signal Iduna Park. ""We really deserved the win - we were very, very good in the first-half,"" said Leipzig head coach Julian Nagelsmann. He was especially pleased with Konate's opening goal from a towering cross before winger Christopher Nkunku, who scored in the mid-week win over Paris Saint Germain, won the penalty which Sabitzer converted after the VAR scrutinised the decision. ""We have trained a lot from set pieces,"" said Nagelsmann. ""It certainly wasn't an obvious penalty, but if the VAR says it was, then it must have been,"" he added after Nkunku went down after the slightest of touches from Freiburg defender Nicolas Hoefler. Union Berlin climbed to fourth with a 5-0 home thrashing of strugglers Arminia Bielefeld. Former Germany striker Max Kruse helped set up Union's first three goals, then converted a late penalty. After just three minutes, Japan winger Keita Endo scored his first goal for Union when he swept home Sheraldo Becker's final pass after Kruse's superb long pass. Endo went off with an injury soon after, but Union kept up the pressure as Kruse set up the next two goals for centre-back Robert Andrich and winger Becker. Kruse, 32, capped an outstanding display by converting a penalty before Cedric Teuchert, a right wing replacement for Becker, grabbed Union's late fourth goal. At the other end of the table, bottom side Mainz were held to a 2-2 draw at home to Schalke, who sit one place above them and have now gone 23 games without a league win dating back to January. After Daniel Brosinski and Jean-Philippe Mateta converted penalties for Mainz, Mark Uth pulled a goal back for Schalke who were 2-1 down late on. Schalke took a deserved point back to Gelsenkirchen when Mainz defender Jeremiah St. Juste turned the ball into his own net eight minutes from time. After five games without a win, Hertha Berlin roared back with a 3-0 win in the fog at Augsburg. Forwards Matheus Cunha, Dodi Lukebakio and Krzysztof Piatek, who cost Hertha 24 million euros ($28 million) from AC Milan in January, got on the scoresheet as Augsburg's defence crumbled."
9,02/10/2020,18:42,Augsburg boss Herrlich hospitalised with lung problem,"Augsburg, who are currently second in the Bundesliga, will be without coach Heiko Herrlich for Sunday's league match at Wolfsburg as he needs hospital treatment for a lung problem, but has tested negative for the coronavirus.","Augsburg manager Stefan Reuter revealed Herrlich needs hospital treatment ""for a few days"" for a pneumothorax - an abnormal collection of air between the lung and the chest wall. Reuter says he does not know how long Herrlich will be unavailable for, but insisted the situation is ""not dramatic"". Herrlich, 48, had complained of cold-like symptoms, but Reuter stressed there are ""no reservations whatsoever"" that he could be suffering from Covid-19. With Herrlich in charge, Augsburg pulled off a 2-0 shock win over Dortmund last Saturday. The result left them second in the league table on goal difference behind surprise leaders Hoffenheim after two matches. In Herrlich's absence, his assistant coach Tobias Zellner will take charge at Wolfsburg. Zellner already stepped in last May when Herrlich had to sit out their first league game after the re-start - also against Wolfsburg - for breaking quarantine to buy toothpaste. A red-faced Herrlich apologised after leaving the team hotel - and breaking the league's hygiene concept - to buy toiletries from a supermarket. Augsburg playmaker Daniel Caligiuri, who scored against Dortmund, said it was ""a pity"" that Herrlich will be absent from the bench at Wolfsburg, ""but I think we have the quality in the coaching team to replace him"". The Bavarian club are looking for a fourth straight win at the start of the new season."
10,26/09/2020,21:02,Haaland draws a blank as Dortmund crash at Augsburg,"Borussia Dortmund crashed to a 2-0 defeat at Augsburg on Saturday as Norway striker Erling Braut Haaland failed to rescue the visitors on his return to Bavaria, where he wrote Bundesliga history in January.","With defending champions Bayern Munich at Hoffenheim on Sunday, last season's runners-up Dortmund blew the chance to build on their impressive 3-0 win over Borussia Moenchengladbach last Saturday when Haaland scored twice in an electric display on the opening weekend of the season. The 20-year-old has netted 18 goals in 21 games this year for Dortmund and wrote himself into Bundesliga history in January when he became the first player to score a hat-trick off the bench on his German league debut. Haaland's three goals in 20 minutes sparked a 5-3 fight-back win. However, the Norwegian hot-shot drew a blank on his return to Augsburg's WWK-Arena with just one clear shot on goal as centre-back Felix Uduokhai powered home a header for the hosts from a free-kick on 40 minutes. Augsburg's former Schalke playmaker Daniel Caligiuri added to Dortmund's misery by holding off Thomas Meunier to fire home the hosts' second on 54 minutes. Haaland was booked with a half an hour gone after some pushing and shoving with Augsburg defender Jeffrey Gouweleeuw, who was also shown a yellow card. Dortmund had three times as many shots on goal and dominated with 80 percent possession, which left their Swiss coach Lucian Favre to admit, ""we are very disappointed, it's hard to accept this defeat"". ""We have much to do,"" admitted Favre, with one eye on Wednesday's German Super Cup match against Bayern in Munich. ""We almost completely dominated the game, we started well, but we weren't precise enough and were too hasty in our play. ""Augsburg defended well, we need to be more patient and play more down the flanks."" Schalke coach David Wagner is on the verge of being dismissed with his side now 18 games without a win after slumping to a 3-0 defeat at home by Werder Bremen, whose striker Niclas Fuellkrug claimed a hat-trick. Schalke were hammered 8-0 by Bayern last weekend and Bremen profited from some equally woeful defending. Fuellkrug tapped home his first goal on 22 minutes, was left unmarked to head home a free-kick on 37 minutes, then converted a penalty on the hour before Mark Uth scored Schalke's late consolation goal. There could also be consequences for Schalke centre-back Ozan Kabak who was sent off for a second yellow card late on. Television cameras also caught Kabak spitting at defender Ludwig Augustinsson after a tackle just before the break, which the referee missed. ""I didn't notice it at the time,"" said Augustinsson after watching a post-match replay, ""but it has nothing to do with football or fair play"". Earlier RB Leipzig were held to a 1-1 draw at Bayer Leverkusen as Emil Forsberg's superb opening goal for the Champions League semi-finalists was cancelled out by a long-range effort from Leverkusen's Kerem Demirbay. Leverkusen's new signing Patrik Schick, who spent last season on loan at Leipzig, curled in a superb shot from 16 metres out but his stunning strike was ruled offside with 23 minutes left. Borussia Moenchengladbach had to settle for a point at home to Union Berlin in their 1-1 draw. Marcus Thuram's headed goal for Gladbach on 56 minutes was cancelled out by an equaliser from Union defender Nico Schlotterbeck, 20, making his Bundesliga appearance for the Berlin-based club, with 11 minutes left. History was made in Arminia Bielefeld's 1-0 win at Cologne as Joan Simun Edmundsson, 29 came on to score the winner and become the first Faroe Island player to play and score in the Bundesliga. Newly-promoted Stuttgart romped to a thumping 4-1 win at 10-man Mainz. Sweden forward Robin Quaison scored early on for Mainz, but Congo winger Silas Wamangituka and Daniel Didavi netted for Stuttgart before Mainz had Moussa Niakhate sent off for a second booking. The flood gates opened with goals by replacement Mateo Klimowicz and forward Sasa Kalajdzic in the final ten minutes."
11,19/09/2020,21:15,Haaland and Reyna shine as Dortmund youngsters down Gladbach,Erling Braut Haaland scored twice and 17-year-old Giovanni Reyna shone as youthful Borussia Dortmund swept aside fellow Champions League side Borussia Moenchengladbach 3-0 on Saturday on the opening weekend of the Bundesliga season.,"After holders Bayern Munich had kicked off the 2020/21 campaign on Friday with a record 8-0 thrashing of Schalke, Dortmund's youngsters also dazzled at home to Gladbach. ""It was a really good start to the season. We have a lot of young guys, it's fun to play with guys near my age,"" said USA Under-17 international Reyna. ""This is an exciting group and we have to keep working."" Haaland converted a second-half penalty, then again showcased his clinical eye for goal by finishing a superb counter as Dortmund attacked from their own goal. Coach Lucien Favre banked on youth by starting two 17-year-olds in Reyna and England Under-21 midfielder Jude Bellingham, who made his league debut, with Sancho and Haaland, both 20, leading Dortmund's attack. Reyna, making just his third league start, paid back the faith by scoring the opening goal and winning the penalty Haaland converted. Reyna drilled home Bellingham's superb pass from a tight ankle on 34 minutes, then had his ankle clipped after a darting run into the area to win the penalty for Haaland. Sancho tried to convince Haaland to let him take the spot-kick, but ""I was confident whoever took it, would score, which is the most important thing"" said Reyna. Haaland then stole the show with a stunning end-to-end sprint to support Sancho's break before crashing home Dortmund's third goal on 78 minutes. The towering Norwegian, the first player in Bundesliga history to score a hat-trick from the bench, now has 18 goals in 20 games for Dortmund since his arrival in January. For the first time since March, some German league clubs were able to welcome back limited numbers of fans, depending on permission from local health authorities. The biggest crowd of the day was in Dortmund, as 9,300 cheered the impressive home win. ""It's amazing to have fans back, they support us so much,"" added Reyna. Having finished runners-up to Bayern for the last two seasons, Dortmund are on a collision course with the European champions who they meet in the German Super Cup showdown on September 30 in Munich. Earlier, Hertha Berlin's new-signing Jhon Cordoba scored on his debut in a 4-1 away romp at Werder Bremen as the ambitious capital city club also threw down an early marker. In front of 8,500 in Bremen, Hertha defender Peter Pekarik and Belgian-born winger Dodi Lukebakio scored quick-fire goals at the end of the first half to leave Werder 2-0 down at the break and the hosts were whistled off the pitch by their own fans. Colombia striker Cordoba, signed from Cologne in mid-week, came on to start the move which Brazil Under-23 forward Matheus Cunha finished as Hertha went 3-0 up with an hour gone. Davie Selke scored Bremen's second-half consolation goal before Cordoba capped his debut by tucking home Hertha's fourth goal on 90 minutes. Just like Bayern, Cologne also had to play behind closed doors due to a rising rate of infection for their 3-2 home defeat to Hoffenheim, for whom Andrej Kramaric scored a hat-trick. The Croatia striker put the visitors ahead after three minutes following a mix up in defence, netted a penalty and smashed home the winning goal in added time after Cologne had launched a late fight back. In the capital, playmaker Michael Gregoritsch and winger Andre Hahn scored late goals as Augsburg beat hosts Union Berlin 3-1 in front of 4,600 fans. Newly-promoted Arminia Bielefeld earned a point with a 1-1 draw at Eintracht Frankfurt on their return to the top flight in front of 6,500. Stuttgart, who also came up, gave Freiburg a scare with late goals by Sasa Kalajdzic and Silas Wamangituka as they fought back in a 3-2 defeat in front of 8,000."
12,27/06/2020,18:01,"Bremen snatch play-off survival chance, champions Bayern rout Wolfsburg","Werder Bremen gave themselves hope of avoiding relegation from the German Bundesliga by thrashing Cologne 6-1 to grab a play-off place on the last day of the season, while champions Bayern Munich routed Wolfsburg before lifting the trophy on Saturday.","Japan striker Yuya Osako scored twice as Bremen stole the lifeline of the relegation/promotion play-off place from Fortuna Duesseldorf, who lost 3-0 at Union Berlin and were relegated with Paderborn, finishing one point behind Bremen. Florian Kohfeldt's Werder will face second-tier opponents in either Heidenheim or possibly neighbours, rivals and fellow fallen giants Hamburg in the play-off first leg on Thursday. Bremen have spent more seasons than any other team in the Bundesliga, having only spent one term in the second tier, in 1980-81. A burst of goals from Osako, Milot Rashica and Niclas Fuellkrug -- all in the space of eight minutes -- had Werder 3-0 up at the break against Cologne at the Weserstadion. Former Everton midfielder Davy Klaassen then fired home a rebound just after the break before Osako, facing his old side, added his second and USA international Josh Sargent completed the rout. Dominick Drexler pulled a goal back for Cologne. Werder, the four-time Bundesliga champions, also needed a favour from Berlin and got one as Union beat Fortuna 3-0 with goals from Nigerian duo Anthony Ujah and Suleiman Abdullahi either side of veteran midfielder Christian Gentner's effort. Bremen will find out their play-off opponents on Sunday, with Heidenheim currently in the play-off place ahead of the final round of matches in the second division. At Wolfsburg, Bayern striker Robert Lewandowski scored a penalty for his 34th league goal of the season, finishing as the top scorer for the fifth time. Kingsley Coman, Michael Cuisance and Thomas Mueller also got on the scoresheet as Bayern, champions for the eighth straight season, finished 13 points clear of second-placed Borussia Dortmund. Mueller set up Coman for Bayern's opening goal to finish the campaign with a league record 21 assists, and his goal that rounded out the win was also Bayern's 100th league goal this season -- one short of the Bundesliga record. Wolfsburg captain Josuha Guilavogui was sent off for a second yellow card after fouling Cuisance, leading to Lewandowski's penalty. Meanwhile, Borussia Moenchengladbach and RB Leipzig secured qualification for next season's Champions League after 2-1 wins over Hertha Berlin and Augsburg respectively, as fifth-placed Bayer Leverkusen missed out by two points despite beating Mainz 1-0. Dortmund, who had already wrapped up second place, crashed to a 4-0 home defeat by Hoffenheim, for whom Croatia striker Andrej Kramaric scored all four goals, including one penalty. That result allowed Hoffenheim to leapfrog Wolfsburg and take sixth place, although both sides will go into the Europa League next season along with Leverkusen. Before kick-off in Dortmund, Mario Goetze, whose winning goal sealed Germany's victory in the 2014 World Cup final, was given a send-off by the club. He will leave this summer with his contract having expired, but the 28-year-old attacking midfielder has not announced his future club. Elsewhere, Timo Werner signed off with a brace in RB Leipzig's 2-1 win at Augsburg in what was his final appearance for the club before moving to Chelsea. Schalke's disastrous second half of the season was completed with a 4-0 thrashing at the hands of Freiburg as they finished the season 12th, having been third in December. Eintracht Frankfurt beat bottom side Paderborn 3-2 in Saturday's other game."
13,14/06/2020,20:55,Schalke set club record 13 league match winless streak,"Bayer Leverkusen moved back into the Bundesliga's Champions League places with a 1-1 draw on Sunday at injury-hit Schalke, who set a new club record of 13 league games without a win.","The result leaves Schalke winless since January's 2-0 victory at home to Moenchengladbach, as they drop to ninth in the table having been third in December. A penalty early in the second-half was converted by Schalke's Daniel Caligiuri after a handball by Burkina Faso defender Edmond Tapsoba. But Schalke defender Juan Miranda then turned the ball into his own net nine minutes from time to extend the winless streak. Caligiuri was partly to blame for the late own goal as he lost the ball to Leverkusen's Brazilian defender Wendell, who crossed low into the Schalke box and Miranda turned the ball into his own net. Leverkusen, who booked their place in the German Cup final on July 4 in mid-week, are now fourth with three games left and heading for next season's Champions League group stages. Schalke are suffering from a mounting injury list with ten players out. ""I've stopped counting,"" quipped head coach David Wagner, the former Huddersfield manager, before kick-off as he made four changes from the team which drew 1-1 at Union Berlin last weekend. The Royal Blues' Under-19 captain Can Bozdogan made his debut on the right wing while second-half replacement Jonas Hofmann, 23, also played his first Bundesliga match having been promoted from the reserves. Earlier, Nigerian forward Taiwo Awoniyi was hospitalised with a severe concussion after a nasty clash of heads during Mainz's 1-0 loss to Augsburg in Sunday's relegation battle. Liverpool loanee Awoniyi, 22, was left motionless after landing awkwardly following an aerial collision with Augsburg defender Felix Uduokhai in the first half. Awoniyi was stretchered off with his neck in a brace after a long delay while he received medical attention on the pitch. Mainz said Awoniyi, a former Under-17 World Cup winner, was responsive and taken to hospital for observation. ""We have received the all-clear from the doctors,"" said Mainz coach Achim Beierlorzer. ""He has regained consciousness and can remember the things that happened. ""He has a severe concussion and has to stay in hospital for observation."" Awoniyi has yet to make an appearance for Liverpool since joining the club in 2015, spending numerous spells on loan in Germany, the Netherlands and Belgium. Augsburg moved seven points clear of the relegation play-off place with just three games to play after striker Florian Niederlechner scored the only goal just 43 seconds into Sunday's match. Niederlechner was happy to atone for his penalty miss in last weekend's 1-1 draw with Cologne. ""Last week I was the idiot, this week I am the hero,"" he said. ""That was a big step (towards safety), but we can't afford to relax."" Augsburg must still face Hoffenheim, third-from-bottom Duesseldorf and Champions League quarter-finalists RB Leipzig. Mainz stayed three points above the bottom three. They came closest to equalising when French striker Jean-Philippe Mateta rounded the Augsburg goalkeeper but had his shot cleared off the line by defender Philipp Max. Mainz face second-placed Borussia Dortmund on Wednesday before Saturday's crucial home match against Werder Bremen, who are second from bottom and three points behind them in the table. League leaders Bayern Munich can claim an eighth straight Bundesliga title at Bremen on Tuesday after Saturday's 2-1 win at home to Moenchengladbach left them seven points clear with three games left."
14,30/05/2020,21:10,Lewandowski hits brace as Bayern Munich go 10 points clear,Bayern Munich opened a 10-point lead at the top of the Bundesliga on Saturday with a 5-0 drubbing of relegation-threatened Fortuna Dusseldorf behind closed doors with the league's top-scorer Robert Lewandowski scoring twice.,"Duesseldorf defender Mathias Joergensen scored an early own goal before Benjamin Pavard, Lewandowski (2) and Alphonso Davies hit the target. With five games left, Bayern, who have won their last eight league games, are comfortably on course for an eighth straight league title. However, second-placed Borussia Dortmund could trim their lead on Sunday at bottom side Paderborn. Several records fell as Lewandowski now has 43 goals in all competitions, a season's best for the Poland striker with games in hand. Also head coach Hansi Flick claimed his 22nd win in his first 25 games, bettering the start made by Pep Guardiola when he took charge in 2013. ""Statistics and records don't interest me, what's important is to have a successful season,"" said Flick, in his first season since replacing Niko Kovac in November. ""At Bayern Munich, you are expected to win. I am very happy, we were very aggressive and didn't give them any chances."" Lewandowski, who had never previously scored in six games against Duesseldorf, made amends with goals either side of half-time. Fortuna, who were unbeaten in their three games since the league resumed after a two-month coronavirus-enforced hiatus, were humbled at the Allianz Arena where they last poached a 3-3 draw in November 2018. They fell behind on 15 minutes when Joergensen turned the ball into his own net after Pavard mishit his shot. Right-back Pavard then grabbed the second with a powerful header on 29 minutes before Lewandowski made it 3-0 just before the break after being presented with a tap-in by Thomas Mueller. Duesseldorf were floored with two goals in as many minutes as Lewandowski profited again with another poacher's goal after Serge Gnabry's good work. Davies then scored the game's best goal. After some high pressing, the Canadian teen won the ball in the Duesseldorf area, barged past a succession of defenders and fired home to make it 5-0 on 52 minutes. Werder Bremen boosted their survival hopes with a 1-0 win at Schalke, who are winless in 11 games and continue to plummet. Midfielder Leonardo Bittencourt scored a first-half winner. ""This is a very, very important away win,"" said Bremen coach Florian Kohfeldt. ""We have taken seven points from the last three games, but if you look at the table, we are still behind."" Bremen have spent more seasons in the Bundesliga than any other club, but currently sit second from bottom. However, Saturday's victory leaves them just three points from guaranteed safety with six games left. They are two points behind Duesseldorf in 16th, which carries a relegation play-off at the end of the season. Werder could climb out of the relegation places for the first time since December on Wednesday if they beat Eintracht Frankfurt at home. Bittencourt hit a stunning strike from just outside the box which beat Schalke's Bayern-bound goalkeeper Alexander Nuebel on 32 minutes. Schalke succumbed to their fourth straight defeat, piling pressure on head coach David Wagner. In the same game, Schalke's American midfielder Weston McKennie wore a 'Justice for George' armband as part of the growing protests over the death of an unarmed black man during a police arrest in the United States. ""To be able to use my platform to bring attention to a problem that has been going on too long feels good!!!,"" tweeted 21-year-old McKennie. ""We have to stand up for what we believe in and I believe that it is time that we are heard."" George Floyd died in Minneapolis in an arrest by a police officer who pinned him to the ground for several minutes by kneeling on his neck. Hertha remain unbeaten with three wins and a draw since Bruno Labbadia took charge during the lockdown after their 2-0 win at home to Augsburg thanks for goals by Javairo Dilrosun and Krzysztof Piatek. Having routed Leverkusen 4-1 away on Tuesday, Wolfsburg crashed to a 2-1 defeat at home to 10-man Eintracht Frankfurt. Japan midfielder Daichi Kamada scored the winner 10 minutes from time while Frankfurt had replacement midfielder Lucas Torro sent off in the dying stages for a second yellow card. Frankfurt took the lead when striker Andre Silva converted a penalty on 27 minutes, but Wolfsburg equalised when right-back Kevin Mbabu headed home on 58 minutes. Hoffenheim are seventh after their 1-0 win at Mainz thanks to Ihlas Bebou who darted into the area, swept past two defenders, and fired home on 43 minutes. On Friday, Leverkusen went third when Germany midfielder Kai Havertz became the first player in Bundesliga history to score 35 goals before his 21st birthday to seal a 1-0 win at Freiburg."

Eduard Loewen, Noah Sarenren Bazee and Sergio Cordova scored as Augsburg moved seven points clear of the relegation play-off place. This was the ninth away win in the 16 Bundesliga matches since the league resumed behind closed doors last weekend after the coronavirus lockdown. The 48-year-old Herrlich apologised to his squad after breaking a week-long quarantine by leaving the team hotel -- to buy toothpaste and skin cream -- before the Wolfsburg match last weekend. With Herrlich back in charge, Augsburg enjoyed their first win in seven league games. Having been as high as third last December, Schalke are now winless in their last nine league games, including last Saturday's 4-0 drubbing at Borussia Dortmund. Loewen gave the visitors the lead in the fifth minute with a superb free-kick which flew into the top corner from 30 metres out at a near-empty Veltins Arena. Augsburg doubled their lead 14 minutes from time when Schalke defender Salif Sane was wrong-footed by a long ball and substitute winger Bazee rifled home. Cordova also came off the bench to score in injury time, latching onto a loose pass from Sane, rounding goalkeeper Markus Schubert and firing into an empty net. Augsburg host bottom side Paderborn on Wednesday, the same day Schalke visit strugglers Fortuna Duesseldorf, who occupy the relegation play-off spot."

""I made a mistake by leaving the hotel,"" admitted Herrlich who said he went to a supermarket to buy toothpaste and skin cream. ""In this situation, I didn't live up to my position as a role model for my team and the public."" Herrlich, who underwent treatment for a brain tumour in 2000, admitted: ""I'm a risk patient, to be precise."" He added: ""I made a mistake by leaving the hotel. Even if I have followed all hygiene measures both when leaving the hotel and otherwise, I cannot undo this. ""Because of this misconduct, I will not be leading the training tomorrow (Friday) and will not be in charge of the team against Wolfsburg on Saturday."" The former Germany international took over from Martin Schmidt earlier his year, penning a deal until 2022. Augsburg are just five points clear of the relegation play-off spot. Ex-Dortmund forward Herrlich previously coached Bayer Leverkusen from 2017-18."

18,08/03/2020,18:14,Bayern go clear at top as Bundesliga faces virus threat,"Thomas Mueller scored as Bayern Munich opened up a four-point lead at the top of the Bundesliga with a 2-0 victory over Augsburg at the Allianz Arena on Sunday, while the spread of the coronavirus threatened to curtail the season.","Bayern lacked fluency in the opening stages despite scoring 13 goals in their previous three Bundesliga games, but did enough to edge closer to an eighth straight title. German health minister Jens Spahn on Sunday called for the cancellation of all gatherings of more than 1,000 people in the country over fears surrounding the spread of the new coronavirus. But the German league immediately reacted, insisting that it was ""out of the question"" that the season would be delayed beyond its scheduled finish on May 16, a week before the German Cup final. Cases of COVID-19 in the country reached close to 850 on Sunday. Bayern extended their unbeaten run to 15 games despite starting slowly. It was not until near the end of the first half when the home side looked like troubling the scorers, with Mueller shooting over the crossbar with just the keeper to beat. Mueller made no mistake in the 53rd minute however, collecting a long ball from Jerome Boateng and side-footing into the net. The goal, reminiscent of the prolific Mueller of a decade ago, continued his recent strong form under manager Hansi Flick. Since Flick took over, Mueller has scored six Bundesliga goals and assisted 12 more in 15 games. Augsburg had several chances to equalise on the counter. Their best opportunity came when Florian Niederlechner had two bites at the cherry just two yards from goal in the 80th minute. He had his first effort saved by Manuel Neuer and was unable to take advantage of a fortunate bounce from the rebound, shooting straight into the desperate Bayern defence. Niederlechner found the back of the net in the 89th minute, but the goal was later ruled out for a marginal offside near the halfway line. Leon Goretzka put the game beyond doubt with a goal in second-half stoppage time after being expertly fed by Serge Gnabry before dribbling the ball past keeper Andreas Luthe. In Sunday's other`game, 16th-placed Fortuna Duesseldorf head to 15th-placed Mainz in a crucial game in the clubs' relegation battle."

His pace and trickery unsettled Liverpool and he was rewarded with two goals before setting up Troy Deeney for the third. ISMAILA SARR (Watford) The Hornets' record signing was up against his idol Mane and stabbed home the opener at the near post and then showed his pace and poise to chip Alisson Becker for Watford's second. Sarr then turned provider for the third as he teed up Deeney to complete a famous win that lifted Watford out of the bottom three. JORDAN AYEW (Crystal Palace) Ayew scored the only goal as Palace got the better of rivals Brighton to ease any fear of being dragged into a relegation battle. The Ghanaian's strike took his league tally for the season to seven -- matching his best tally for a single campaign in England. MBWANA SAMATTA (Aston Villa) Samatta did Tanzania proud by scoring in the League Cup final against Manchester City, but his diving header at the near post just before half-time was merely a consolation for Villa as City won 2-1 to lift the trophy for a third straight season. YOUSSEF EN-NESYRI (Sevilla) En-Nesyri scored a 93rd-minute winner as Sevilla beat Osasuna 3-2 to move up to third in La Liga. The Moroccan striker, who joined Sevilla from Leganes in January, opened the scoring with a guided shot into the corner before Lucas Ocampos made it two on the stroke of half-time. Osasuna came back in the second half through goals from Aridane and Roberto Torres, only for En-Nesyri to snatch victory for Sevilla in injury-time with a close-range finish. RAMY BENSEBAINI (Borussia Moenchengladbach) Algerian Bensebaini scored a crucial early goal for Moenchengladbach as they beat Augsburg 3-2 to keep pace with the top of the Bundesliga table. Bensebaini, in his first start in 2020 after returning from injury, headed home a cross from Lars Stindl to put the visitors 1-0 up. When asked how it felt to be back in the Foals' line-up after the match, he simply replied ""it was fun"". ACHRAF HAKIMI (Borussia Dortmund) Having made his name as one of Dortmund's best going forward this season, the Real Madrid loanee was called on to do more than his fair share of defending against a stubborn Freiburg side. Working on the edge of a four-man midfield, Hakimi's pace was valuable during the 1-0 win as he snuffed out several Freiburg counter attacks. He did have a shot on goal deflected in the dying stages but was unable to add to his tally of two Bundesliga goals this season. STEPHANE BAHOKEN (Angers) The Cameroon striker was rewarded with a start for his team at Brest after coming off the bench against Montpellier last weekend and scoring the winner a minute later. He delivered again in Brest, although he needed a full 43 minutes to bag the only goal of the match this time. MAX-ALAIN GRADEL (Toulouse) Ivory Coast winger Gradel, 32, returned to the Toulouse starting line-up last weekend for the first time in a Ligue 1 game since early December following injury. He kept his place and wore the captain's armband but could not prevent the division's bottom side from going down 2-0 at home to Rennes. They have now taken just a single point from their last 17 league games and are heading fast towards relegation. KARL TOKO-EKAMBI (Lyon) Cameroon forward Toko-Ekambi, who joined Lyon on loan from Villarreal in January, came off the bench and contributed to their 2-0 win over derby rivals Saint-Etienne. Having earlier had a goal disallowed for offside, he won the late penalty which Moussa Dembele scored to seal the victory. Toko-Ekambi had started the 1-0 Champions League last-16, first leg win over Juventus in midweek and hit the bar in the first half against the Italians."

Borussia Moenchengladbach can draw level on 34 points if they beat Hertha Berlin, who are chasing a third straight win under Jurgen Klinsmann, on Saturday night. Leipzig fell behind at home after just eight minutes when Augsburg's top-scoring forward Florian Niederlechner stabbed home a cross. However, Leipzig battered the visitors' goal and their 16th attempt finally went in when midfielder Konrad Laimer curled his shot inside the top corner on 68 minutes. The hosts took the lead with ten minutes to go when Czech forward Patrik Schick headed home his third goal in as many games after he was left unmarked at the far post. Danish striker Yussuf Poulsen grabbed Leipzig's third goal in the 89th minute when he converted a pass from Timo Werner. Elsewhere, Dutch teenager Joshua Zirkzee continued his dream scoring run for Bayern Munich by giving the defending champions a late lead in their 2-0 win at home to Wolfsburg. Having scored on his Bundesliga debut in their 3-1 midweek win at Freiburg, Zirkee, 18, fired home a Thomas Mueller pass with his first touch after coming off the bench at the Allianz Arena. Germany winger Serge Gnabry then added a second goal just before the final whistle to seal the three points which leaves Bayern third. The win came at a price, however, as defender Javi Martinez had to be helped off. Bayern already have fellow centre-backs Niklas Suele and Lucas Hernandez sidelined by long-term injuries. Schalke are fifth after their 2-2 draw at home to Freiburg, who converted two second-half penalties. The Royal Blues took the lead in Gelsenkirchen when Turkey midfielder Suat Serdar showed great finishing. Freiburg equalised early in the second half when Germany striker Nils Petersen converted a penalty. Their South Korean midfielder Kwon Chang-Hoon then hit the post just before Freiburg winger Vincenzo Grifo chipped home a penalty attempt to put them 2-1 up with 23 minutes left. However, Schalke claimed a point when substitute forward Ahmed Kutucu hit a brilliant shot from the edge of the area. The result leaves Schalke level on 30 points with Borussia Dortmund, who crashed 2-1 defeat at Hoffenheim on Friday. Cologne left the relegation places with a 1-0 win at home to Werder Bremen, who drop into the bottom three, thanks to a first-half goal by Colombia striker Jhon Cordoba from close range. After three straight defeats, 10-man Leverkusen are now sixth after their 1-0 win at Mainz as Argentina striker Lucas Alario scored a 90th-minute winner. Leverkusen played the last 20 minutes with ten man after Brazilian defender Wendell was sent off for a second yellow card."

Hertha are just a point above the relegation zone. Left-back Max opened the scoring for the Bavarians in the 18th minute with a free-kick but the turning point came 10 minutes later. Jarstein earned a red card with a studs-up challenge on Niederlechner. Cordova claimed the home side's second in the process. Substitute Hahn added a third in the 52nd minute with a superb curling strike from the edge of the box. Niederlechner bagged his side's fourth in the 79th minute. Earlier on Sunday, Borussia Dortmund's squad were booed and jeered when they appeared at the side's annual general meeting, with fans screaming ""shame on you"". Coach Lucien Favre is under pressure as Dortmund, expected to challenge for the title after an ambitious off-season recruitment drive, languish in sixth after a draw to lowly Paderborn on Friday. On Saturday managerless Bayern Munich closed the gap at the top of the table to just a point with a 4-0 romp at Fortuna Duesseldorf as leaders Borussia Moenchengladbach suffered a shock 2-0 loss at Union Berlin. In Sunday's late game, struggling Mainz head to Hoffenheim who can move fourth with a sixth straight win."
22,09/11/2019,21:52,Bayern brush aside off-field woes to thrash Dortmund in 'Klassiker',Managerless Bayern Munich thrashed Borussia Dortmund 4-0 in 'Der Klassiker' on Saturday as Robert Lewandowski continued his phenomenal scoring run with two goals at the Allianz Arena.,"Lewandowski's first-half header and 76th-minute tap-in mean he has scored in all of Bayern's Bundesliga and Champions League games this season for a tally of 23 goals. ""We were very focused, we knew we had to give 100 percent and improve,"" said Lewandowski after the reigning Bundesliga champions bounced back emphatically from last weekend's 5-1 drubbing at Eintracht Frankfurt. Serge Gnabry claimed Bayern's second, while visiting captain Mats Hummels scored a late own goal for his former club as Dortmund suffered another heavy defeat in Munich after a 5-0 rout in April. ""After 10 minutes, we made it clear that we wanted to win,"" said Bayern forward Thomas Mueller. ""The alibis had all been used up."" Bayern moved up to third, level on points with second-placed RB Leipzig and one behind leaders Borussia Moenchengladbach, who host Werder Bremen Sunday. Interim coach Hansi Flick enjoyed his second win in charge since Niko Kovac was sacked last Sunday. ""It's not been easy for the team, we didn't have that many training sessions,"" said Flick. ""They knew they had a duty to improve and they did."" Afterwards, club chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge said Flick will stay in charge for Bayern's next game on November 23 at Fortuna Duesseldorf. However, Bayern are having difficulties finding a new coach, with Arsene Wenger on Saturday contradicting their claims they turned him down as Kovac's successor and slammed the club for a lack of discretion. Ajax coach Erik ten Hag and Paris Saint-Germain boss Thomas Tuchel have already made it clear they will not join Bayern this season. Despite their off-field troubles, Bayern dominated as Lewandowski opened the scoring with a superb header from a Benjamin Pavard cross on 17 minutes. Dortmund winger Jadon Sancho was taken off on 36 minutes after failing to make an impact on proceedings. Gnabry had a goal ruled out for offside as Bayern went in 1-0 up at the break, but the Germany winger struck two minutes into the second half. When Lewandowski stumbled with the goal at his mercy, Gnabry fired home. With an hour gone and his side 2-0 down, Dortmund coach Lucien Favre brought on forwards Marco Reus and Paco Alcacer, who have only just recovered from foot and calf injuries respectively. Alcacer had his head in his hands after failing to connect with an Achraf Hakimi cross with 20 minutes left as Dortmund's best chance went begging. Bayern's third came as Lewandowski finished another counter-attack by the hosts, just before Hummels' own goal. ""That was a huge disappointment, a lot of our players didn't play well. Bayern were better,"" admitted Dortmund coach Lucien Favre. Earlier, Timo Werner netted twice as Leipzig went second with a 4-2 win at Hertha Berlin in the capital, where the Berlin Wall fell on November 9, 1989. To mark the 30th anniversary, a replica of the Wall, which divided Germany's capital from 1961, separated Hertha and Leipzig before being knocked down prior to kick-off. Midfielder Maximilian Mittelstaedt gave Hertha a first-half lead which lasted six minutes before Werner converted a penalty. Marcel Sabitzer added Leipzig's second on the stroke of half-time before three goals came in the final five minutes. Kevin Kampl netted Leipzig's third with a superb left-footed strike before Werner grabbed his second for his 11th league goal in as many games, before Hertha striker Davie Selke scored against his former club. Striker Rouwen Hennings completed his hat-trick five minutes from time as Fortuna Duesseldorf held Schalke to a 3-3 draw. The Royal Blues squandered the lead three times as goals by Daniel Caligiuri, Ozan Kabak and Suat Serdar in Gelsenkirchen were cancelled out by Hennings.

Augsburg climbed out of the bottom three with a 1-0 win at bottom club Paderborn thanks to a goal by defender Philipp Max."
23,03/11/2019,18:50,Düsseldorf beat regional rivals Cologne,Fortuna Düsseldorf beat bitter regional rivals Cologne 2-0 in the Bundesliga on Sunday in what was a first home triumph over their North Westphalian neighbours since 1983.,"The win came against the run of play and lifts Düsseldorf up to 13th place, while Cologne end the round second from bottom. Borussia Moenchengladbach top the Bundesliga on 22 points from 10 games with Dortmund second on 19, while Freiburg, RB Leipzig, 8-0 winners on Saturday, and Bayern Munich, who fell to their heaviest defeat in 10 years 5-1 at Eintracht Frankfurt, are all on 18. Plucky Cologne dominated the early exchanges but the away side's verve was dented after Düsseldorf were awarded a penalty in the 36th minute when Alfredo Morales was brought down in the box. Fortuna forward Rouwen Hennings converted from the spot to give the home side a 1-0 lead going into the break. Cologne started the second half well, going close on two occasions, but just after the hour mark Düsseldorf doubled their lead on a rare counter-attack, with Erik Thommy taking advantage of some sloppy defending to smash the ball home. Düsseldorf then held firm to keep just their second clean sheet of the season. Fortuna's American keeper Zack Steffen was particularly impressive throughout and now has a league-leading 42 saves to his name in the 2019-20 season. In Sunday's late game, Schalke have the chance to move level with Bayern and company when they travel to Augsburg. In Saturday's action flares halted play briefly as FC Union defeated city rivals Hertha Berlin 1-0 in their first Bundesliga derby since German reunification. Niko Kovac admitted his future as Bayern Munich coach hung in the balance after their thrashing in Frankfurt."
24,27/10/2019,18:08,VAR denies Wolfsburg chance of going top,"A late VAR intervention cost Wolfsburg the chance to go top of the Bundesliga on Sunday, with Joao Victor's 84th-minute goal disallowed in a goalless draw against Augsburg.","Wolfsburg celebrated what they thought was a victory after Tin Jedvaj's cross was tapped home by Victor before referee Tobias Stieler overturned the strike for offside. The visitors started on top, dominating the first period. Augsburg striker Florian Niederlechner had a number of chances, going close in the 17th minute with a close range shot. Niederlechner had another chance to open the scoring in the 50th minute, but again failed to convert. Brazilian defender William was the home side's best player, probing and asking constant questions of the Augsburg defence. It was a rare offensive stalemate for Wolfsburg, who had scored in every Bundesliga game so far this season. They are now third, level on 17 points with Freiburg. Wolfsburg remain the Bundesliga's only unbeaten side, while Augsburg finish the weekend in 17th after chalking up their fourth draw of the season. The stalemate highlighted the congested nature of the 2019-20 Bundesliga campaign, with only four points separating leaders Bayern Munich from 10th-placed Hoffenheim. Borussia Moenchengladbach have a chance to go top in Sunday's final game when they take on Eintracht Frankfurt at Borussia Park."
25,19/10/2019,18:41,Bayern slip up again as Augsburg grab last-gasp leveller,Bayern Munich were denied top spot in the Bundesliga when Alfred Finnbogason's injury-time equaliser snatched Augsburg a dramatic 2-2 draw on Saturday.,"Niko Kovac's men sit one point adrift of both leaders Borussia Moenchengladbach and second-placed Wolfsburg, who drew 1-1 at RB Leipzig. Gladbach face a difficult trip to Borussia Dortmund later on Saturday with a chance to move three points clear at the summit. It was the second league match in succession that reigning champions Bayern had slipped up, having lost 2-1 at home to Hoffenheim before the international break. Augsburg opened the scoring in stunning fashion, Marco Richter finding the net just 30 seconds after kick-off, the fastest goal of the season so far. Richter took advantage as Bayern struggled to clear a bouncing ball deep in their own box. The 21-year-old sweetly struck a right-footed volley to grab a rapid lead -- just as Augsburg had done in the corresponding fixture last year. Bayern replied as Robert Lewandowski stretched his scoring streak to eight games in the 14th minute from a Serge Gnabry cross. After a host of missed chances, former Arsenal winger Gnabry threaded the needle in the 49th minute to put Bayern 2-1 ahead. But a strong, bullying run in injury time by Sergio Cordova on the wing set up Finnbogason, who finished past Manuel Neuer to earn a point for Augsburg, and put another early dent in Bayern's title defence. Thomas Mueller missed two chances after coming on as a late substitute after a week of controversy over the fact he has not started a game since September. Timo Werner scored his first goal in five games for Leipzig in a tight tussle against Wolfsburg at the Red Bull Arena. It was not enough. Wolfsburg scored a late equaliser when Dutch striker Wout Weghorst finished a William cross to keep the race at the top close. Wolfsburg are the only unbeaten team in the division. At the Weserstadion, Werder Bremen opened the scoring at home against Hertha Berlin as Josh Sargent's strike took a useful deflection on its way into the net in the seventh minute. Dodi Lukebakio hit back in the 70th minute for Hertha to secure a 1-1 draw. He beat three defenders, including Theodor Gebre Selassie twice, in a mazy run from the wing. Union Berlin claimed just the second win of their debut top-flight season by beating Freiburg 2-0 at a bouncing Stadion an der Alten Foersterei. Marius Buelter gave them the lead with a long-range strike, his third goal of the season. A second goal from distance by Marcus Ingvartsen, over substitute goalkeeper Niclas Thiede, making his debut, was enough to secure victory for the home side. Elsewhere, Rouwen Hennings scored a late winner to seal Fortuna Duesseldorf a 1-0 home win over 10-man Mainz."
26,18/10/2019,03:01,Kovac tells Bayern to dig in after Hoffenheim slump,Niko Kovac says Bayern Munich need to prove their shock defeat to Hoffenheim was only a Champions League hangover in their bid to reclaim top spot in the Bundesliga Saturday.,"Bayern followed up their 7-2 thrashing of Tottenham in the Champions League by crashing to a 2-1 loss in the Bundesliga a fortnight ago when mid-table Hoffenheim earned their first win at the Allianz Arena. In the process, Moenchengladbach topped the table and Bayern dropped to third with five other teams all within two points of first place. Now Kovac wants a win this weekend at Augsburg, where Bayern conceded a first-minute Leon Goretzka own-goal and needed two Kingsley Coman goals to earn a 3-2 win in February. ""There are teams all over Europe who have problems in their league after Champions League games,"" said Kovac on Thursday. ""Hoffenheim were better than their place in the table (12th) suggested - the same goes for Augsburg (14th). ""We know that is a hard place to win, we were a goal down after 10 seconds there last season. ""I expect a game in which we will have to hang in there and make the most of our opportunities."" Fresh from scoring a hat-trick for Poland, and helping them qualify for the Euro 2020 finals, Bayern striker Robert Lewandowski can equal the league record by scoring at Augsburg to continue his run of a goal in each of the first eight games. The 31-year-old is in blistering form with 15 goals, including 11 in the Bundesliga, so far in 11 matches in all competitions. Kovac said Germany winger Serge Gnabry, who had a leg knock, and French defender Lucas Hernandez (knee) were both ""ready to play"". Things are so tight in the top half of the table that seventh-placed Bayer Leverkusen could move into first place by beating Eintracht Frankfurt on Friday night. ""It's striking that the league is divided into two parts,"" acknowledged Kovac. ""Many of the top teams play in Europe, but I think that Leipzig, Dortmund and Leverkusen will stay at the top for a long time."" Despite Kovac's confidence in Bayern's rivals Dortmund, Lucien Favre's team must end their run of three consecutive 2-2 league draws -- in which they have thrown away the lead on each occasion -- at home to current leaders Gladbach on Saturday. On Thursday, Dortmund extended the contract of Euro 2016 winner Raphael Guerreiro until 2023, but Favre says it is still ""too early"" for striker Paco Alcacer, who has an Achilles tendon injury. Favre says Dortmund must improve ""five to ten percent"" to beat Gladbach and close the four-point gap behind the leaders. The 2014 World Cup winner has started Bayern's last six games on the bench -- ""a trend that doesn't make (him) happy"" -- with Kovac preferring Philippe Coutinho in the attacking midfielder role behind Lewandowski. Mueller could start at Augsburg after Coutinho endured a mammoth round-trip to Singapore, on duty with Brazil, for internationals against Senegal and Nigeria. On Thursday, Kovac admitted he ""made a mistake"" by saying the 30-year-old Mueller, who has made 495 appearances for Bayern and helped them win eight Bundesliga title, will only be called upon off the bench ""in case of emergencies"" and held clear-the-air talks. 1.57 - the number of goals Lewandowski has scored on average per Bundesliga game this season. 52 - his projected goal tally for 34 matches in the 2019/20 season if he maintains his present average. It would beat the record of 40 Gerd Mueller set in 1971/72. 88 &amp; 90 - the minutes in which Dortmund have conceded own-goals in two of their last three matches - all of which ended in 2-2 draws.

27,28/09/2019,21:00,Lewandowski hailed for 'extreme goals quota' as Bayern go top,"Record-breaking Bayern Munich striker Robert Lewandowski was hailed for his ""extreme quota of goals"" on Saturday as the defending German champions warmed up for their European duel against Tottenham with a nervy win at strugglers Paderborn which took them to the top of the Bundesliga.","Lewandowski became the first player in Bundesliga history to score 10 goals in the first six games to seala 3-2 victory at bottom club Paderborn. While Bayern squeezed past Paderborn, Leipzig were shocked 3-1 at home to Schalke to surrender top spot. Bayern took full advantage to claim first place before Tuesday's key Champions League clash at Spurs, but not before conceding two second-half goals. Philippe Coutinho, who is rebooting his career on loan in Munich after an unhappy stint at Barcelona, played a key role by setting up Serge Gnabry's opening goal with a sublime first-half pass. Having scored his first Bayern goal the week before in a rout of Cologne, the Brazilian playmaker tapped home Gnabry's neat pass after the break before substitute Kai Proeger pulled a goal back for Paderborn. With time almost up, Lewandowski showed great finishing prowess to put away a Niklas Suele pass and make it 3-1, becoming the first Bayern player to score in each of the first six matches of the season. He is also the first Bundesliga player to reach 10 goals after the first six games. ""It's an extreme quota, which helps when they decide games like that,"" said midfielder Joshua Kimmich of Lewandowski's goal haul. ""To have ten already is something else."" There were, however, nervous looks in Bayern's ranks during the final ten minutes after Paderborn defender Jamilu Collins beat Germany goalkeeper Manuel Neuer from 30 metres out. ""We didn't finish them off,"" admitted Gnabry. ""In the second half, we had so many goal opportunities to decide the game, but our finishing was missing. ""Tottenham will be a completely different game and, of course, we must improve, but I think we can do well there."" In Leipzig, Morocco international midfielder Amine Harit inspired Schalke to an impressive away win, winning and drilling home a penalty, then setting up a first Bundesliga goal for Welsh teenager Rabbi Matondo. The Royal Blues raced into a 2-0 lead with first-half goals as Senegalese centre-back Salif Sane headed home from a corner on 29 minutes before Harit's penalty. The referee took a long look at the replays after Harit went down after the faintest of contact from Mali defender Amadou Haidara. Schalke, under ex-Huddersfield coach David Wagner, made sure of the three points when Matondo claimed his first Bundesliga goal since joining from Manchester City. Harit again did the damage, punishing a mistake in midfield then putting in a well-timed pass which sent Liverpool-born Matondo away to fire home on 58 minutes. Emil Forsberg's consolation goal came too late for Leipzig. The shock result shook up the table with Bayern now top, Leipzig drop to second and Schalke jumped from fifth to third. Questions about Borussia Dortmund's mentality will again be raised after more defensive lapses in their 2-2 draw at home to Werder Bremen left them seventh. Milot Rashica gave Bremen an early lead at Signal Iduna Park, but Germany pair Mario Goetze and Marco Reus both scored with headers to put Dortmund 2-1 up at half-time. However, Werder claimed a point when Marco Friedl poked the ball home ten minutes into the second half. The disappointing draw comes after Dortmund skipper Reus was left fuming after his side leaked a late own goal in last Sunday's 2-2 at mid-table Eintracht Frankfurt. ""We should have had a third goal and conceding their final goal really hurts. We didn't play well,"" said Reus after the Bremen defeat. Borussia Moenchengladbach went fourth as goals from French strikers Alassane Plea and Marcus Thuram sealed a 2-0 victory at Hoffenheim. Bayer Leverkusen are just behind them in fifth thanks to late goals from forwards Kevin Volland and Kai Havertz that added to a Florian Niederlechner's first half own goal in a 3-0 win at Augsburg."
28,02/04/2019,23:33,Late Halstenberg penalty snatches dramatic German Cup win for Leipzig,Marcel Halstenberg's last-gasp penalty saw RB Leipzig snatch a 2-1 victory over Augsburg in a nerve-shattering German Cup quarter-final tie on Tuesday.,"After Alfred Finnbogason's equaliser had rescued Augsburg in injury time of normal time, Halstenberg restored the lead in injury time of extra time to send Leipzig into the first German Cup semi-final of their history. The hosts held Leipzig at bay for long periods and looked dangerous themselves until a momentary lapse in concentration allowed Werner to break away and slot in the opener on 74 minutes. Leipzig were left shellshocked, however, when Finnbogason snatched an equaliser four minutes into injury time. Yet it was Leipzig who had the last laugh in a jaw-dropping game, as Michael Gregoritsch's late handball in the box broke Augsburg hearts and gifted Leipzig victory. ""We are so frustrated because we were at least on the same level as Leipzig today,"" Augsburg coach Manuel Baum told Sky. Tensions bubbled over after full-time, as the two teams' sporting directors Oliver Mintzlaff and Stefan Reuter clashed on the sidelines. ""It was a very emotional game, it was a fight, and tempers flared a bit at the end,"" Mintzlaff told ARD. ""The team fought so hard, and we deserved to win."" Leipzig will be joined in the last four by Hamburg, who beat Paderborn 2-0 earlier in the evening. Hamburg striker Pierre-Michel Lasogga continued his fine scoring form in the German Cup as he grabbed both goals to fire his side into the semi-finals for the first time in ten years. Lasogga has now scored six goals in the competition this season, equalling a club record set by Ivica Olic the last time Hamburg reached the last four in 2009. ""I've never been in the semi-finals before, and I can't describe how good it feels,"" Lasogga told Sky. ""We deserved to win today. It was an extraordinary evening."" After a handful of chances after half-time, Lasogga gave Hamburg the lead on 54 minutes, rising high at a corner to nod the ball in from close range. Fourteen minutes later, he smashed a powerful shot into the bottom corner to seal Hamburg's passage to the semi-finals. The other two semi-finalists will be decided on Wednesday, as Bayern Munich host Heidenheim and Werder Bremen travel to Schalke. The draw for the semi-final will take place next Sunday."

""It is very frustrating because we had done so well to catch up with Dortmund, and now we have to start again,"" Kovac told Sky. ""I assume my players know what is at stake next weekend. We have to win now."" Dortmund survived a tough afternoon at Signal Iduna Park without captain Marco Reus before Alcacer snatched a dramatic victory. Reus missed the game to be at the birth of his first child, and Dortmund toiled against Wolfsburg's energetic pressing in his absence. Yet Alcacer's starring role saw them reclaim top spot as Bayern slipped in the Black Forest. ""We always believed we were going to score"" Dortmund's Mario Goetze told Sky. ""It wasn't easy, and we were a bit fortunate, but it shows the quality we have."" Bayern were left stunned when Freiburg took the lead after just three minutes. Lucas Hoeler, who scored a late equaliser in Munich in November, towered over Mats Hummels to head in Christian Guenter's cross. Yet the champions hit back 20 minutes later, Robert Lewandowski hooking in the equaliser with an elegant finish. Lewandowski hit the post in added time but Bayern could not force a winner. The two title contenders will to go head-to-head at the Allianz Arena next Saturday. ""We're very happy that we are back on top, and it's a good feeling to be flying to Munich as league leaders,"" Dortmund sporting director Michael Zorc told Sky. Borussia Moenchengladbach suffered a fourth defeat in seven games as they were put to the sword by local rivals Fortuna Duesseldorf. Duesseldorf's Benito Raman tormented Gladbach from the wing early on, setting up two goals for Rouwen Hennings and one for Kevin Stoeger in the first quarter of an hour. Denis Zakaria then grabbed a late consolation goal for the visitors. Having been hot on the heels of Bayern and Dortmund earlier in the season, Gladbach are now in free fall, and will drop out of the top four for the first time since September if Eintracht Frankfurt win on Sunday. Goals from Mikael Ishak, Matheus Pereira and Eduard Loewen gave Nuremberg a ray of hope in the relegation fight as they battled to a 3-0 win over Augsburg. Loewen sealed the win late on to give his team their first win in 21 games and bring them within four points of the relegation play-off place. Elsewhere, Werder Bremen moved into the Europa League spots with a 3-1 win over Mainz. Milot Rashica gave Bremen an early lead, and Max Kruse blasted in Bremen's second on 36 minutes. Robin Quaison pulled one back for Mainz after half-time, but Kruse struck again shortly afterwards to restore Bremen's two-goal lead."
30,09/03/2019,20:39,'Perfect day' as Bayern return to Bundesliga summit with Liverpool looming,"Bayern Munich warmed up for Liverpool with a ""perfect day"" by knocking Borussia Dortmund from the top of the Bundesliga for the first time since September with a 6-0 thrashing of Wolfsburg on Saturday.","Bayern, who host Liverpool on Wednesday in their Champions League, last 16, return leg clash after a goalless draw at Anfield, went top on goal difference from Dortmund, who needed late goals to win 3-1 at home to Stuttgart. ""I'm very pleased. We want to be just as focused on Wednesday,"" said Bayern head coach Niko Kovac. Bayern ran riot in Munich as Robert Lewandowski scored twice, leaving him with 20 goals in 17 league games against Wolfsburg, while Serge Gnabry, James Rodriguez and Joshua Kimmich also netted. ""We are now where we want to be -- first in the table and that's where we want to stay,"" added Kovac with nine rounds of league games left. Having been told on Tuesday, along with Bayern team-mates Jerome Boateng and Mats Hummels, that his Germany career is over, Mueller took out his frustration, setting up the first goal and scoring Munich's second. ""The three wanted to give a response and they all played well -- it was a perfect afternoon,"" said goal-scorer Kimmich. Gnabry gave Bayern the lead on 34 minutes at the Allianz Arena by tapping home Mueller's cross, then turned provider three minutes later when he served up a simple tap in for Lewandowski to make it 2-0. Rodriguez, thriving in the attacking midfield role, got on the scoresheet when his superb 52nd-minute shot hit the top corner. Having set up the first goal, Mueller showed Germany head coach Joachim Loew what he is missing by wrong-footing Wolfsburg goalkeeper Koen Casteels to score with his heel on 76 minutes. Kimmich scored with a header on 82 minutes and Lewandowski claimed his second by guiding his header into the far corner three minutes later. Lewandowski, the top-scoring foreigner in Bundesliga history with 197 goals, has now scored in each of his last seven games against Wolfsburg, who he single-handedly battered in 2015 with five goals in just nine minutes. In Dortmund, late goals by Paco Alcacer and Chelsea-bound Christian Pulisic saw off dogged Stuttgart, but Borussia are now second after 23 weeks on top. ""I don't care about who is top now,"" said Dortmund captain Marco Reus. ""It only matters who is top at the end and everything is still open."" The win, only Dortmund's second in their last nine games, was vital to stay level on 57 points with Bayern. Despite some dogged Stuttgart defending, Dortmund took the lead at Signal Iduna Park when Reus netted a penalty on 62 minutes. The lead lasted just nine minutes as Stuttgart's Marc-Oliver Kempf headed home unmarked. However, Alcacer calmed nerves when the Spanish striker stabbed home on 84 minutes after a goal-mouth scramble. The third goal came when Axel Witsel beat three defenders, played Mario Goetze into the box to set up Pulisic, who netted in stoppage time. ""They parked a gigantic bus (in front of goal) -- it was hard to find the holes,"" complained Dortmund coach Lucien Favre. ""We tried everything and managed it, we ran a lot and defended a lot, but all in all, the win was deserved."" Third-placed RB Leipzig were held to a goalless draw at home by Augsburg, who beat Dortmund last Friday and went down fighting against Bayern last month. Mid-table Hertha Berlin crashed to a 2-1 defeat at Freiburg after the visitors captain Vedad Ibisevic cancelled out a Nils Petersen goal, but then scored an own-goal by turning the ball into the Berlin net. Later, Borussia Moenchengladbach bounced back from last weekend's 5-1 thumping at home to Bayern with a 1-0 win at mid-table Mainz, thanks to a second-half goal from defender Nico Elvedi. Gladbach stay fourth, level on 47 points with Leipzig, and both clubs lag nine points behind new leaders Bayern and Dortmund."
31,01/03/2019,22:41,Ji for two as Dortmund crash at Augsburg,South Korea striker Ji Dong-won netted twice against his former club Borussia Dortmund as the league leaders suffered a shock 2-1 defeat at Augsburg on Friday to stumble again in the Bundesliga title race.,"Defending champions Bayern Munich, who are second, will draw level with Dortmund on 54 points if they win at third-placed Borussia Moenchengladbach on Saturday. The result is a blow for Dortmund as they try to overturn a 3-0 defeat on Tuesday when they host Tottenham Hotspur in the return leg of their Champions League last 16 tie. Dortmund now have just one win in their last seven matches in all competitions. They have also dropped nine points in their last five league games. Both Augsburg goals were a result of mistakes by inexperienced Dortmund defenders Dan-Axel Zagadou, 19, and Achraf Hakimi, 20. Having also scored against Bayern a fortnight ago, Ji gave Augsburg the first-half lead, then hit a superb second to chip inside the post home 22 minutes from time. Paco Alcacer scored Dortmund's consolation goal nine minutes from time, but victory left Augsburg now five points clear of the relegation battle in 15th place. This was only Dortmund's second league defeat this season, but is another significant set-back after being held to a goalless draw at bottom side Nuremberg ten days ago. Once again, Dortmund struggled against relegation-threatened opposition as Augsburg gave the perfect response after three straight defeats and last weekend's 5-1 thrashing by Freiburg. Dortmund's top-scorer and playmaker Marco Reus returned after four weeks out with a thigh injury. Augsburg were forced into an early substitution when defender Konstantinos Stafylidis limped off injured after just 17 minutes. Just as they did a fortnight ago, when mighty Bayern Munich had to twice come from behind to win 3-2 at the WWK Arena, Augsburg took a surprise early lead. When Andre Hahn fired in a cross, Zagadou slipped and despite the best efforts of three Dortmund defenders, Ji curled home his shot for the opening goal on 24 minutes. At the other end, defensive midfielder Thomas Delaney shot over the bar and centre-back Manuel Akanji headed wide. Then Dortmund midfielder Jacob Bruun Larson fired direct at Augsburg goalkeeper Gregor Kobel at point-blank range as the hosts went into the break 1-0 up. Heavy rain blighted the second-half, but Ji showed lightning reactions for his second goal. When Hakimi put in a lazy pass, Ji pounced and sprinted clear before chipping the ball inside the far post to delight the home crowd. The 27-year-old has now scored four goals in seven games against his old Dortmund. With Reus off, his replacement Alcacer gave Dortmund hope on 81 minutes when he tapped home Mario Goetze's final pass, but it was too little, too late."
32,28/02/2019,01:24,Dortmund eager to learn from Bayern slip-up at Augsburg,Lucien Favre says his Bundesliga leaders Borussia Dortmund must learn from Bayern Munich's stumble against Friday's opponents Augsburg to stay ahead in the tense title race.,"With just under a third of the season left, recent poor results have slashed Dortmund's lead from nine to just three points before Friday's trip south to Augsburg, where Bayern came perilously close to a shock defeat a fortnight ago. The defending champions leaked two goals from crosses, including a weak own-goal by Leon Goretzka 13 seconds into the Bavarian derby, and needed two Kingsley Coman goals to draw level before David Alaba scored the winner in a 3-2 victory. Dortmund had their own close shave at home to Augsburg last October in a seven-goal thriller after replacement Paco Alcacer claimed a hat-trick by drilling home a stunning 96th-minute free-kick to seal a dramatic 4-3 win. Augsburg sit just above the relegation places, but their winger Philipp Max still found lots of space on the flanks against Bayern and Favre, Dortmund's head coach, expects a few more surprises from Manuel Baum's side. ""Augsburg played very well the last time we faced them, they change their tactics regularly,"" said Favre on Wednesday. ""Against Bayern, they played some high risk football and caused a few problems. Augsburg have a lot of goal chances in every game."" This will be Dortmund's final chance to tune up before next Tuesday's all-or-nothing Champions League clash at home to Tottenham Hotspur with the Germans needing to overturn a 3-0 deficit after being thumped in the last 16, first leg tie at Wembley. Dortmund hope to welcome back Marco Reus, their captain and chief goal-scorer, at Augsburg after missing nearly four weeks with a thigh strain, during which his side went five games without a win, but Lukasz Piszczek is out with a foot injury. Last Sunday's 3-2 victory at Bayer Leverkusen, when stand-in skipper Mario Goetze and England winger Jadon Sancho supplied key goals, ended Dortmund's slump. ""It was important to win again,"" explained the Swiss coach. ""Leverkusen played very well, but we're always learning and everyone was a part of that."" On Saturday, Bayern, who have won ten of their last 11 league games, have a tricky away trip to faltering Borussia Moenchengladbach, who inflicted a stunning 3-0 defeat on the Bavarian giants at the Allianz Arena when the sides met in October. Dieter Hecking's Gladbach sit third, but stumbled in recent weeks by crashing to 3-0 defeats against Hertha Berlin and Wolfsburg either side of a 1-1 draw at Eintracht Frankfurt. Bayern hope to have a host of stars fit after missing the start of the week with illness. Both goalkeepers Manuel Neuer and Sven Ulreich were absent on Monday with flu while forwards Franck Ribery and Robert Lewandowski sat out Tuesday's session with upset stomachs.

33,15/02/2019,22:59,Bayern fight back twice in Liverpool tune-up win,Bayern Munich conceded the fastest own-goal in Bundesliga history on Friday and twice had to equalise before securing a 3-2 win at Augsburg in their final tune-up before their Champions League tie at Liverpool.,"Ahead of Tuesday's last 16, first-leg clash at Anfield, Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp will have watched with interest how Augsburg, who sit just above the Bundesliga relegation places, caused Bayern a few problems. The away league win means defending champions Bayern trimmed the gap to just two points behind leaders Borussia Dortmund, who are at bottom side Nuremberg on Monday. With one eye on Anfield, Bayern goalkeeper Manuel Neuer returned after three games out with a thumb injury, but conceded two goals in the opening 24 minutes -- the first after just 13 seconds. Leon Goretzka claimed an unwanted record for the Bundesliga's fastest own-goal when he turned the ball into his own net. ""I can't remember a worst start from us,"" admitted Bayern coach Niko Kovac. ""We have to play much better at Liverpool."" The win could have come at a price as Kingsley Coman, who scored Bayern's first-half goals, was injured in the dying stages. ""We need to see how he is, but it doesn't look good,"" admitted Kovac. Coman twice equalised in the opening half, cancelling out the own-goal then levelling at the half-time break after South Korea international Ji Dong-won had restored Augsburg's lead. David Alaba scored Bayern's winning goal early in the second half, but Bayern will need to improve to trouble Liverpool. ""The goals we conceded were crazy,"" said Bayern captain Neuer. ""We had said we wanted to defend well and we didn't manage that. ""Liverpool are a strong, attacking team and we must do better, luckily we have a few days to improve."" Bibiana Steinhaus, the first female referee in Europe's top five leagues, had barely blown for kick-off when Augsburg winger Philipp Max put in a cross which flummoxed the Bayern defence. Goretzka watched in horror as the ball ricocheted off his boot and into the net as the injury-hit hosts took a shock lead. It was short of the Bundesliga's record fastest goal, just nine seconds, shared by Kevin Volland, for Hoffenheim against Bayern in 2015/16, and Karim Bellarabi, for Leverkusen against Dortmund in 2014/15. However, shell-shocked Bayern quickly regrouped. Serge Gnabry and Robert Lewandowski went close, then Bayern drew level on 17 minutes when a beautifully curling Joshua Kimmich cross found Kingsley Coman, who tapped home at the far post. Augsburg restored their lead with almost a copy of their first goal when Max again fired in a cross and Ji rifled an unstoppable shot past Neuer from 14 metres out on 24 minutes. Bayern still managed to go into the half-time break level when Coman claimed his second goal. Goretzka made up for his earlier mistake with a pass to the French winger, who fired through the legs of Augsburg goalkeeper Gregor Kobel to make it 2-2 just before the break. The winning goal arrived eight minutes into the second-half when Coman flicked the ball inside to Alaba and the 26-year-old fired a trademark low-shot inside the post which gave Augsburg keeper Kobel no chance. Augsburg's Reece Oxford headed over with a brilliant effort with 26 minutes left, but Bayern held on for victory."
34,10/02/2019,19:17,Werder Bremen eye Europe after Augsburg cruise,Werder Bremen moved to within three points of the European places after a dominant 4-0 victory over a hapless Augsburg in the Bundesliga on Sunday.,"The home side were 3-0 ahead in the first 30 minutes before adding a fourth in the closing moments. Bremen had defeated Bundesliga leaders Borussia Dortmund mid-week in the German Cup on penalties and they took that form into Sunday's game. Wearing a special kit for their 120th birthday, Kosovan midfielder Milot Rashica scored Bremen's first goal after just five minutes, latching onto an expertly-weighted pass from Davy Klaassen to hammer the ball into the bottom corner. Augsburg's English defender Reece Oxford went close in the 24th minute, but the on-loan West Ham player's header drifted just over the bar. Johannes Eggestein scored Bremen's second almost immediately, thumping a deflected shot from Max Kruse into the net. Less than a minute later Bremen were on the attack again, with Rashica scoring a memorable goal. The midfielder cut inside off the left wing, beat Oxford before curling a stunning shot into the top corner. It was more of the same after the break for Augsburg, who lacked rhythm and confidence while looking a long way away from the side that beat Mainz 3-0 last week. Bremen's veteran striker Claudio Pizarro, who scored against Dortmund in midweek, came off the bench in the 77th minute and he provided the flick which allowed Kevin Mohwald to add the fourth."
35,23/02/2018,02:10,Five things to look out for in the Bundesliga,"Bayern Munich coach Jupp Heynckes will be chasing a 38-year-old club record when his team host Hertha Berlin on Saturday, but will do so without the injured James Rodriguez.","Heynckes is looking to become the first Bayern coach to win 15 games in a row as his team look to consolidate a commanding 19-point lead at the top of the Bundesliga. Second-place Borussia Dortmund host Augsburg on Monday, with fans from both sides set to boycott the game. Elsewhere, Bruno Labbadia takes charge of Wolfsburg for the first time against Mainz on Friday, while RB Leipzig look set to host Cologne without star midfielder Naby Keita. Here are five things to look out for in this weekend's Bundesliga action: Jupp Heynckes has worked wonders since returning to Bayern Munich, and on Saturday he looks set to break an incredible club record. Heynckes, who has led Bayern to 23 victories in 24 games since October, could now become the first Bayern coach ever to win 15 games in a row. The 72-year-old watched his side romp to victory over Besiktas in midweek to pick up a 14th consecutive win, equalling a club record set under Pal Csernai back in 1980. Bayern are expected to be without James Rodriguez, who was forced to leave the pitch after 44 minutes against Besiktas with a calf problem. A diagnosis on Wednesday confirmed that the Colombian will be out of action for no more than a few days. More fan protests are expected this Monday when Borussia Dortmund take on Augsburg in the Bundesliga's second Monday night fixture. Last week's inaugural Monday game saw fierce protests from Eintracht Frankfurt fans, who blew whistles and held up banners in protest at the new scheduling. This Monday, both Dortmund and Augsburg fan groups are expected to continue protests. Around 300 Dortmund fan clubs have reportedly signed up to a boycott led by the influential fan group ""Suedtribuene Dortmund"". ""We accept every opinion and every protest, as long as it is carried out peacefully,"" said Dortmund CEO Hans-Joachim Watzke. RB Leipzig will be without star midfielder Naby Keita when they host Cologne on Sunday evening. The Guinean midfielder left the field after just an hour in Leipzig's defeat to Frankfurt on Monday, having pulled his hamstring. Captain Willi Orban is also a doubt after suffering a cut to his knee in a collision with Frankfurt's Sebastien Haller on Monday. Coach Ralph Hasenhuettl, though, claimed that the injuries were not a disaster for his team, as Leipzig look to muscle their way back into the top four this weekend. ""We have enough quality to replace both of them,"" insisted Hasenhuettl. Bruno Labbadia takes charge of Wolfsburg for the first time on Friday evening, as the Wolves travel to Mainz for a crucial bottom of the table clash. Labbadia took charge of the struggling Wolves after Martin Schmidt's sudden resignation earlier this week, and is now tasked with leading the club back to safety. ""We have to use every hour available to us,"" said Labbadia. ""I will demand of my players that they invest everything into this fight."" Relegation threatened Hamburg find themselves in last chance saloon ahead of Saturday's visit to arch rivals Werder Bremen. Hamburg have not won in 10 games, and are now six points from safety as they prepare for a must-win game over fellow strugglers Bremen. ""The derby is coming just at the right time,"" said Hamburg's Aaron Hunt. ""It is a great chance for us to turn things around."" Playing Friday (all times GMT) Mainz v Wolfsburg (1930) Playing Saturday Bayern Munich v Hertha Berlin, Hoffenheim v Freiburg, Hanover v Borussia Moenchengladbach, Stuttgart v Eintracht Frankfurt (1430), Werder Bremen v Hamburg (1730) Playing Sunday Bayer Leverkusen v Schalke (1430), RB Leipzig v Cologne (1700) Playing Monday Borussia Dortmund v Augsburg (1930)"
36,18/02/2018,20:50,Five things we learned from the Bundesliga,"Arjen Robben missed his first penalty in six years, but that didn't stop Bayern Munich from snatching victory against Wolfsburg and taking their lead to 19 points. Borussia Dortmund moved up to second after Marco Reus fired them to victory over Borussia Moenchengladbach, but RB Leipzig could yet overtake them with a win against Eintracht Frankfurt on Monday. Elsewhere, Mario Gomez lifted Stuttgart away from the relegation zone with a winner against Augsburg.","Here are five talking points from this weekend's Bundesliga action. Arjen Robben stirred unhappy memories in Bayern Munich's 2-1 win against Wolfsburg, missing a penalty for the first time since the 2012 Champions League Final. Robben's penalty misery six years ago marked a low point in his career, as opponents Chelsea went on to win the title. The Dutchman had not missed a spot-kick since for Bayern until he failed to beat Koen Casteels from 12 yards on Saturday. He would quickly make amends, however, providing the assist for Bayern's equaliser and winning the penalty for Robert Lewandowski's injury-time winner. ""If you pick up an assist and win a penalty after having missed one earlier in the game, I think you can be happy,"" said Robben. Marco Reus marked his return to fitness with a fine goal on Sunday, but it was the playing surface which made the headlines as Borussia Dortmund beat Borussia Moenchengladbach. Ravaged by both cold and wet weather in recent weeks, the pitch at the Borussia Park was in a dreadful condition, and became steadily worse as the game progressed. Referee Bastian Dankert chose to let the game go ahead, however, and bobbling balls and a slippy surface were not enough to stop Reus from lashing in a brilliant first-half winner for Dortmund. Breel Embolo netted what would be the decisive goal in Schalke's 2-1 victory over Hoffenheim on Saturday, and immediately dedicated his winner to the team's video analyst. The Swiss international took advantage of a mistake by Hoffenheim's Kevin Vogt, intercepting a pass across the defensive line and sliding the ball effortlessly past goalkeeper Oliver Baumann. ""At least 80 per cent of the goal belongs to our video analyst,"" admitted Embolo. ""We knew in advance that Vogt has a tendency to play brave passes, and that sometimes he is too brave."" Mario Gomez will be hoping that his winner for Stuttgart on Sunday will have caught the eye of Germany coach Joachim Loew. The 32-year-old has his sights set on a return to the national team set-up for this summer's World Cup in Russia. ""Joachim Loew knows that he can rely on me,"" he told Welt. ""The important thing is that he sees I am fit, that I have energy and self-confidence. At the moment, I have all those things, 100 per cent."" Gomez certainly showed that on Sunday, as his first-half strike inspired Stuttgart to a first away win of the season. The video assistant referee was once again the subject of controversy. Cologne were left furious when Claudio Pizarro's late winner against Hanover was ruled out with the help of VAR, and there was confusion in Augsburg after Michael Gregoritsch's equaliser was disallowed after a full two minutes of discussion. ""It's not about whether the decision is right or not, it's that it seems arbitrary when the referee chooses to use VAR,"" said Cologne goalkeeper Timo Horn. ""Anyone who loves football has lost something this season."""
37,18/02/2018,20:44,Pitch battle as Reus ends goal drought in Dortmund win,A brilliant first-half strike saw Marco Reus grab his first Bundesliga goal since May to secure a 1-0 win for Borussia Dortmund at Borussia Moenchengladbach on Sunday in a match played on an atrocious pitch.,"The two teams were forced to play on a highly uneven surface in Moenchengladbach after recent poor weather had badly-affected the pitch at Borussia-Park. There were chances for both Lars Stindl and Raul Bobadilla early on, but the pitch remained the focus of attention, as Andre Schuerrle appeared to slip and hurt himself. Schuerrle recovered to set up Reus as Dortmund took the lead against the run of play on 32 minutes. Picking up a pinpoint long pass from Mario Goetze, Schuerrle squared the ball to Reus, whose dipping shot glanced off the crossbar on its way in. ""I actually wanted to hit it further to the left,"" Reus told Sky. ""But the main thing is that the ball went in. We had to scrap today, and we have a lot of work ahead of us."" Reus has missed most of the current campaign with a cruciate ligament tear, and had not been on the scoresheet for Dortmund since scoring a brace on the final day of last season. Jannik Vestergaard found the net for Gladbach just before half-time, but was judged to be offside by the video assistant referee. Thorgan Hazard should have equalised moments later, darting into the box from the left wing before slicing the ball wide. Gladbach continued to push forward after the break, chances falling to both Denis Zakaria and Matthias Ginter before Sokratis denied Bobadilla with a goal-line clearance on 55 minutes. As the second half wore on, Roman Buerki was forced into a string of saves, denying Stindl, Bobadilla and Nico Elvedi to keep Dortmund ahead. At the other end, Reus saw his fizzing half-volley beaten away by Yann Sommer. Earlier in the day, Mario Gomez's goal was enough to secure a first away win of the season for Stuttgart, and inflict a first home defeat since October on Augsburg. The veteran striker gave Stuttgart the lead just before the half-hour mark. After Erik Thommy's free-kick was blocked by the defensive wall, Gomez pounced on the loose ball and swept it into the bottom corner. Michael Gregoritsch appeared to equalise for Augsburg ten minutes later, but he too was correctly ruled offside after a two-minute long consultation with the video assistant referee. Only a superb save from Marwin Hitz stopped Stuttgart from doubling the lead on 65 minutes, the Augsburg goalkeeper denying Gomez from point blank range. ""We should really have won by three or four goals today,"" Gomez told Sky. ""But we showed amazing character, and we're going in the right direction."" The win lifts Stuttgart four points clear of the bottom three, while Dortmund move into second ahead of RB Leipzig's visit to Eintracht Frankfurt on Monday."
38,18/02/2018,18:00,Gomez gives Stuttgart space to breathe,"Mario Gomez fired Stuttgart to a 1-0 victory over southern rivals Augsburg on Sunday, lifting the struggling side four points clear of the bottom three.","Gomez's first-half strike was enough to secure a first away win of the season for Stuttgart, and inflict a first home defeat on neighbours Augsburg since October. The veteran German international who at 32 has returned to his boyhood club, gave Stuttgart the lead just before the half-hour mark. After Erik Thommy's free-kick was blocked by the defensive wall, Gomez pounced on the loose ball and swept it into the bottom corner. Michael Gregoritsch appeared to equalise for Augsburg ten minutes later, but he was correctly ruled offside after a two-minute long consultation with the video assistant referee. Only a superb save from Marwin Hitz stopped Stuttgart from doubling the lead on 65 minutes, the Augsburg goalkeeper denying Gomez from point blank range. While both Gomez and Daniel Ginczek squandered further chances for Stuttgart, the home side found the net in stoppage time, only for Koo Ja-Cheol to be ruled offside. Augsburg, already furious with the confusion over VAR in the first half, then saw a penalty appeal turned down in the dying seconds of the game as Stuttgart held on to secure the win."
39,05/02/2018,12:11,Five things we learned from the Bundesliga weekend,"Michy Batshuayi made a blistering start to life at Borussia Dortmund on Friday, firing the team back into the top four with two goals on his debut.","The Belgian wasn't the only debutant to make an impact, as 20-year-old English forward Ademola Lookman grabbed a late winner in his first game for RB Leipzig. The goal saw Leipzig move up to third in the Bundesliga, drawing level on points with second-place Bayer Leverkusen. Both Leverkusen and Leipzig are now 18 points behind leaders Bayern Munich, whose victory over Mainz on Saturday was overshadowed by speculation over coach Jupp Heynckes' future. Here are five things we learned from this weekend's Bundesliga action. Who needs Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang when you have Michy Batshuayi? Just three days after joining Dortmund on a six-month loan deal, Batshuayi enjoyed an explosive debut, grabbing two goals and an assist to inspire his new team to a 3-2 victory in Cologne. ""The way the game went for him today was like a dream,"" said coach Peter Stoeger of his new striker. Batshuayi, meanwhile, is already dreaming of big goals for his six-month sojourn in Westphalia. ""I want to get into the Champions League with Dortmund,"" he said. ""I want to win every single game."" Bayern Munich's dominance of the Bundesliga continued at the weekend, but there was more attention paid to Jupp Heynckes' future. The 72-year-old's contract runs until June, and he has repeatedly refused to talk about extending it. ""I can imagine that readers, viewers and listeners are bored of this topic,"" he said on Friday. Since coming out of retirement to take over at Bayern in the autumn, Heynckes has led the team to 14 victories in 15 Bundesliga games, so it is little wonder that the club would like him to stay beyond the end of the season. ""If I stood naked in front of him, I might have a small chance of persuading him to stay,"" joked club president Uli Hoeness earlier in the week. Everton loanee Ademola Lookman grabbed the headlines on Saturday, scoring 12 minutes into his RB Leipzig debut to secure a late victory over Borussia Moenchengladbach. The 20-year-old Englishman might, however, want to invest in a pair of new boots. ""He was lucky that I didn't take him off again straight away,"" admitted Leipzig coach Ralph Hasenhuettl. ""He was just sliding around in the boots he was wearing. They were the only pair he had brought with him from England, and he didn't want to take them off."" Both goalkeepers were left blushing in Gelsenkirchen as Werder Bremen snatched a late 2-1 win over Schalke. Bremen 'keeper Jiri Pavlenka allowed Yevhen Konoplyanka's shot to slip through his fingers in the first half. His error was overshadowed by the woes of opposite number Ralf Faehrmann, however -- he first fumbled a free-kick to gift Bremen an equaliser, before being nutmegged by Zlatko Junuzovic's late winner. ""Ralf said sorry in the dressing room, and I told him he had nothing to apologise for,"" said Schalke coach Domenico Tedesco. Michael Gregoritsch will have enjoyed watching the Super Bowl on Sunday, having secured three points for Augsburg just hours earlier. The Austrian scored Augsburg's second in a 3-0 win over Eintracht Frankfurt, and celebrated by miming a quarterback's throw. ""I will definitely be watching the Super Bowl later,"" admitted Gregoritsch after the game. ""My four best friends are coming over; I never sleep after a game anyway."""
40,04/02/2018,17:42,Frankfurt miss chance to go second with Augsburg loss,Young forward Marco Richter scored his first Bundesliga goal as Augsburg beat Eintracht Frankfurt 3-0 on Sunday.,"The win saw Augsburg move up to seventh, while Frankfurt missed an opportunity to go second in the table and remain sixth, one point adrift of fourth-placed Borussia Dortmund in the race for Champions League qualification. ""We were aggressive from the very first minute today,"" Augsburg goalscorer Michael Gregoritsch told Sky. ""I think that the win was a fair result."" After Kevin Danso had missed a sitter early in the game, Augsburg took the lead on 19 minutes, Koo Ja-cheol holding the ball up well in the penalty area before squeezing it into the far corner. Frankfurt responded brightly, Luka Jovic hitting the post just minutes later, but it was Augsburg who had the better of the first half, as good chances came and went for Caiuby and Gregoritsch. Marcel Heller forced a smart save from Lukas Hradecky just after the break, as Augsburg continued to dominate. With 15 minutes to go, the home side finally doubled the lead, Gregoritsch hooking the ball out of the air and prodding it in from close range. With just minutes to go, the 20-year-old Richter broke into the box, and fired the ball into the bottom corner to pick up a first goal in just his second senior appearance for Augsburg."
41,30/09/2017,18:14,Dortmund go clear despite Aubameyang penalty howler,Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang's miserable week continued as he missed a penalty but Borussia Dortmund still ground out a 2-1 win at Augsburg on Saturday to extend their Bundesliga lead.,"Star striker Aubameyang followed on from his poor performance in Tuesday's 3-1 Champions League defeat at home to Real Madrid by firing a weak penalty straight at Augsburg goalkeeper Marwin Hitz 10 minutes from time. Despite last season's Bundesliga top-scorer squandering the chance to kill off the game, Dortmund held on as goals from Andriy Yarmolenko and Japan's Shinji Kagawa either side of Caiuby's equaliser sent Borussia five points clear at the top. It was a controversial penalty awarded by the video assistant referee (VAR) after referee Marco Korb missed a foul by Koo Ja-Cheol, South Korea's ex-captain, on Lukasz Piszczek. That came after the VAR had earlier failed to award Augsburg a penalty when Dortmund's Sokratis clearly tugged at the shirt of Brazil midfielder Caiuby. Dortmund had taken the lead after just four minutes through winger Yarmolenko before Caiuby headed an equaliser. Kagawa scored what proved to be the winner on 23 minutes with a dream goal when he floated a shot over Hitz following good work from Gabon's Aubameyang and Yarmolenko. ""We're happy with the result, but that was the worst performance since I became Dortmund coach,"" said Borussia boss Peter Bosz. ""We didn't play good football, and it was even worse after the break. ""Every team has about two such games like that per season, which they normally lose."" The result left Dortmund five points clear of Hoffenheim, who are at Freiburg on Sunday, and six ahead of defending champions Bayern Munich, who play Hertha Berlin. Former full-back Willy Sagnol will lead Bayern after Carlo Ancelotti was sacked in the wake of Wednesday's 3-0 defeat at Paris Saint Germain in the Champions League. Elsewhere, Belgium's Thorgan Hazard netted a 94th-minute penalty winner, awarded by the VAR, in Borussia Moenchengladbach's 2-1 home victory over Hanover 96. Austria international Martin Harnik equalised for Hanover after Mathias Ginter, a member of Germany's 2014 World Cup-winning squad, stabbed the hosts ahead in the second-half. Hanover, who suffered their first defeat this season, stay fourth while Moenchengladbach climb to sixth. Frenchman Sebastien Haller scored 10-man Eintracht Frankfurt's dramatic 93rd-minute winner to seal a 2-1 victory at home to VfB Stuttgart. Frankfurt had French defender Simon Falette sent off for bringing down striker Simon Terodde when he was through on goal after 65 minutes. Just four minutes earlier, Terodde had equalised with a header after Ante Rebic had given the hosts a first-half lead. Japan international Yoshinori Muto earned Mainz a 1-1 draw at Wolfsburg. Josuha Guilavogui had scored for Wolves, who had France's Paul-Georges Ntep sent off deep into injury time. The north German derby ended in a goalless draw as hosts Hamburg, who were founded 130 years ago, held arch rivals Werder Bremen on their anniversary celebrations."
42,20/09/2017,14:27,German FA investigate Baier for obscene gesture,Augsburg captain Daniel Baier could face a heavy German Football Association (DFB) fine after being investigated for making an obscene gesture during a televised Bundesliga match.,"When Baier was tackled near the RB Leipzig bench late in Augsburg's 1-0 victory during Tuesday's bad-tempered match, the 33-year-old spat in the direction of RB coach Ralph Hasenhuettl. The television camera caught Baier also making an obscene gesture. The DFB confirmed Wednesday they will investigate, referee Daniel Siebert not having seen the incident. Baier claims he twice tried to apologise, both after the final whistle on the pitch and again in the dressing room, but that Hasenhuettl rejected the apology. ""He should have been shown a red. It was a pity that the fourth official didn't see it. He (Baier) did not apologise,"" fumed Hasenhuettl. Immediately after the match, Augsburg's skipper saw no reason to say 'sorry'. ""What should I apologise for?"" he told Sky. ""My god, it's a football match and emotions are involved. ""I made a gesture, what more can I say?"" However, he apologised in a statement posted on social media channel Instagram on Wednesday. ""Out of the emotion, I let myself be swept into making a gesture that I don't know how I got to,"" Baier wrote. ""I apologise to all those who interpreted it as offensive. ""I apologised to the team before training, because the senseless gesture pushed our great performance into the background. ""I hope that those at RB Leipzig will also think differently following last night, when I tried to apologise on the pitch and later in their dressing room to clean up the misunderstanding."" There is a history of bad-blood between the pair after Hasenhuettl previously commented on Baier's behaviour. Augsburg are having a stellar start to the season with 10 points from their first five league games to go third in Germany's top flight. In contrast, Champions League side RB Leipzig are struggling to recapture last season's form, which saw them finish second to reigning champions Bayern Munich. They are eighth having lost twice in the league so far this season after starting the 2016/17 campaign with a record 13-game unbeaten run on their Bundesliga debut."
43,30/04/2017,17:54,Augsburg rout Hamburg in relegation battle,Augsburg climbed out of the Bundesliga's relegation zone with a 4-0 hammering of Hamburg on Sunday as Turkey international Halil Altintop netted twice.,"Hamburg took Augsburg's place in 16th after the away defeat as the hosts climb to 13th giving themselves a two-point buffer from the drop zone with three games left. Altintop, 34, struck twice to leave Augsburg 2-0 up at the break before winger Philipp Max netted their third with a quarter of an hour to play. Max, 23, then set up replacement striker Raul Bobadilla, who was on for Altintop, to bang in their fourth goal on 85 minutes, just five minutes after coming off the bench. On Saturday, Bayern Munich were crowned Bundesliga champions for the fifth straight season after their 6-0 thrashing of 10-man Wolfsburg on Saturday. Robert Lewandowski netted twice to leave the Poland hot-shot as the league's top scorer on 28, one more than Dortmund's Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang. After second-placed RB Leipzig had earlier been held to a goalless draw by Ingolstadt, Bayern wrapped up the title as the win over Wolfsburg left them ten points clear with three games left. David Alaba, Thomas Mueller, Joshua Kimmich and Arjen Robben also netted in Wolfsburg's thrashing at the Volkswagen Arena. Wolfsburg, the 2009 German league champions, are level with Hamburg on 33 points, but they are only above relegation places on goal difference."
44,09/04/2017,17:31,Stocker helps Hertha end losing streak,Swiss winger Valentin Stocker had a hand in both goals as Hertha Berlin ended their three-match losing streak with a 2-0 Bundesliga win over Augsburg on Sunday.,"Hertha climb back up to fifth after victory at Berlin's sun-drenched Olympic Stadium to keep their European hopes alive following straight defeats to Cologne, Moenchengladbach and Hoffenheim. Stocker played a key role as his attempted shot was headed home by US international John Anthony Brooks for the opening goal on 12 minutes. The Swiss international then netted his own goal, profiting from good play by Hertha's strikers Vedad Ibisevic and Salomon Kalou. Ibisevic held off two defenders to stab a pass through to Kalou, who spotted Stocker unmarked in the area and presented the right winger with a tap-in on 37 minutes. Kalou could have netted a late third, but failed to get a clean connection on his shot. The defeat keeps Augsburg 16th in the table -- amongst the relegation places -- and their plight was compounded later Sunday when Ingolstadt cut the gap behind them to a point by beating bottom side Darmstadt 3-2. On Saturday, Robert Lewandowski overtook Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang in the race to be the Bundesliga's top-scorer this season by netting twice in Bayern Munich's 4-1 thrashing of Borussia Dortmund. Runaway league leaders Bayern dominated the clash of Germany's giants and the win leaves them 10 points clear with six games left as Munich edge closer to a fifth straight league title. Lewandowski netted either side of half-time at the Allianz Arena to leave him with 26 league goals this season -- one more than main rival Aubameyang, who failed to find the net on Saturday. Veteran wingers Arjen Robben and Franck Ribery also netted in Bayern's morale-boosting win before Wednesday's crunch Champions League quarter-final, first-leg, tie against Real Madrid. The defeat leaves Dortmund, who host Monaco in the Champions League quarter-finals on Tuesday, fourth in the table and 18 points behind Bayern. Yussuf Poulsen's 93rd-minute goal gave 10-man RB Leipzig a 1-0 victory at home to Bayer Leverkusen after captain Willi Orban was sent off for a second yellow card. Leipzig's victory was a big step towards direct Champions League qualification next season and they are now seven points ahead of third-placed Hoffenheim, who crashed to a 2-1 defeat at Hamburg. Aaron Hunt stole the show for Hamburg -- who are unbeaten in their last nine home league games -- with both goals as Hoffenheim suffered only their third defeat this season. Wolfsburg, the 2009 champions, are just one point above the bottom three after a 4-1 hammering away to mid-table Schalke, for whom Guido Burgstaller netted twice. Mainz are only outside the relegation places on goal difference after their 1-0 defeat at Freiburg, whose striker Nils Petersen scored the second-half winner off the bench. The victory lifted Freiburg into the Europa League places in sixth above Cologne, who lost 3-2 at home to local rivals and fellow European hopefuls Borussia Moenchengladbach."
45,12/03/2017,18:27,Burgstaller's brace ends Schalke's winless streak,Austria striker Guido Burgstaller netted twice on Sunday as Schalke 04 broke their six-match winless streak with a 3-0 victory at home to Augsburg in the Bundesliga.,"Schalke's coach Markus Weinzierl had an enjoyable afternoon against his former club as the Royal Blues wrapped up the win with just over half an hour played in Gelsenkirchen. ""We put in a very strong first half -- I must pay the team a big compliment,"" said Weinzierl, whose team next face Borussia Moenchengladbach away in the Europa League's last 16 after Thursday's 1-1 first-leg draw. ""In the second half, you could see we had a few games in our legs. ""A lot of people have written us off in the Europa League, but we still believe in our chance,"" he added ahead of Thursday's away leg at Gladbach. Burgstaller opened the scoring with four minutes gone when he stabbed home at the far post from a corner, then grabbed his second on 29 minutes after a cross from Cameroon's Eric Choupo-Moting. Schalke captain Benedikt Hoewedes, a World Cup winner with Germany, conceded a penalty by fouling Augsburg's burly striker Raul Bobadilla. Goalkeeper Ralf Faehrmann saved Paul Verhaegh's spot kick on 32 minutes but Schalke's attacking midfielder Daniel Caligiuri netted the home team's third goal just two minutes later. The victory reverses Schalke's slide down the table. They climbed two places to 11th, two ahead of Augsburg. It takes the pressure off Schalke's coach Weinzierl, who had been under the cosh following last weekend's 4-2 drubbing at Borussia Moenchengladbach. At the top of the table, leaders Bayern Munich extended their lead to 10 points on Saturday after their 3-0 win over Eintracht Frankfurt on a red-letter day for the Bavarian giants as their nearest rivals lost. Second-placed RB Leipzig crashed to a shock 1-0 defeat at home to Wolfsburg, while Borussia Dortmund, who are third, suffered a Champions League hangover in the capital as they lost 2-1 at Hertha Berlin."
46,05/02/2017,17:45,Bobadilla's late winner breaks Bremen hearts,Burly striker Raul Bobadilla broke Werder Bremen's hearts on Sunday with a 94th-minute winner to seal Augsburg's 3-2 comeback win and lift the Bavarians up the German league table.,"The powerfully-built Paraguay international chested down a long ball from midfielder Koo Ja-Cheol and slammed his shot into the Bremen goal as Augsburg fought back with two goals in the final fifteen minutes. Relegation-threatened Bremen had been heading for a valuable 2-1 win after Germany striker Max Kruse had converted a second-half penalty for Werder. But South Korea's Koo put Augsburg level for the second time when the attacking midfielder fired home Paul Verhaegh's pass from close range to make it 2-2 with 11 minutes to go before Bobadilla struck. The first-half had finished 1-1 after Augsburg midfielder Jonathan Schmid scored to cancel out Theodor Gebre Selassie's early goal for Bremen. The result in Bavaria leaves Bremen 15th, only out of the bottom three on goal difference, while Augsburg climb three places to 10th. It was another tough result for battling Bremen, who went down fighting in last Saturday's 2-1 home defeat to leaders Bayern Munich having lost by the same scoreline to Borussia Dortmund the week before. Carlo Ancelotti's Bayern finish the weekend four points clear at the top of the league despite a disappointing display in Saturday's 1-1 draw at home to mid-table Schalke. Robert Lewandowski's early goal for Bayern at Munich's Allianz Arena was cancelled out by a free-kick from Schalke's Brazil defender Naldo. Bayern's cause was later helped when Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang netted his 17th Bundesliga goal of the season in Borussia Dortmund's 1-0 win over second-placed RB Leipzig, who had been hit by flu. Aubameyang remains two goals ahead of Bayern hot-shot Robert Lewandowski in the race to be the German league's top scorer thanks to his superb first-half winner. The Gabon striker headed home after teenage French winger Ousmane Dembele ghosted past two RB defenders down the right wing and crossed for Aubameyang to head home unmarked on 35 minutes. Leipzig struggled without top-scorer Timo Werner, midfielder Diego Demme and striker Marcel Sabitzer, who all have flu, while playmaker Emil Forsberg was suspended. The result lifted Dortmund from seventh to third, eight points behind Leipzig."
47,14/12/2016,15:37,Augsburg fire Schuster in shock move,Dirk Schuster on Wednesday became the sixth Bundesliga coach fired this season after Augsburg surprisingly sacked him after just six months in charge.,"The 48-year-old only joined Augsburg from Darmstadt in July after predecessor Markus Weinzierl left for Schalke 04 and Schuster has been dismissed along with both of his assistant coaches. The club says ""different views on the direction and the way FC Augsburg want to play football"" was the reason for the unexpected split. Schuster has been shown the door after six defeats, five draws and just three wins from his 14 Bundesliga games in charge. His replacement is the 37-year-old Manuel Baum, head coach of the club's youth team, who has a coaching licence, but precious little experience in senior football. Baum will be in charge ""until further notice"" as Augsburg have two league games left in 2016 -- at home to Borussia Moenchengladbach on Saturday and away to Borussia Dortmund next Tuesday. The club is 13th of the 18 teams in Germany's top flight and four points above the relegation places. But last Saturday's 1-0 defeat to Hamburg was only their first defeat in four games after draws against Hertha Berlin, Cologne and Eintracht Frankfurt, who are all in the top half of the table. With forwards Raul Bobadilla of Paraguay, Iceland's Alfred Finnbogason and Brazil's Caiuby all struggling with injuries, Augsburg have one of the worst goal records in the league having scored just 11 times in 14 games. Schuster joins Norbert Meier, who replaced him at Darmstadt, Markus Kauczinski (Ingolstadt), Dieter Hecking (Wolfsburg), Bruno Labbadia (Hamburg) and Viktor Skrypnyk (Werder Bremen) who have all been sacked since September by Bundesliga teams"
48,29/10/2016,17:54,Robben shines as Bayern floor Augsburg again,Robert Lewandowski and Arjen Robben combined for all three goals as Bundesliga leaders Bayern Munich eased to an impressive 3-1 victory for their second win over Augsburg this week.,"Having also beaten their Bavarian neighbours by the same margin on Wednesday at home in the German Cup, Bayern completed the double thanks to Robben's outstanding display with two assists and a goal. Bayern took the lead at Augsburg's WWK Arena when Robben's pass found Lewandowski unmarked in the area to rifle home his first Bundesliga goal for six weeks on 19 minutes. The Poland hot-shot returned the favour two minutes later. His shot was parried by Augsburg goalkeeper Marvin Hitz, but Lewandowski spotted Robben unmarked and the Dutchman drilled home the pass. Just after the break, Robben snapped up a disastrous pass from Augsburg's Gojko Kacar to thread a pass for Lewandowski to fire home on 48 minutes for his seventh goal in nine league games. Just as they had done in the cup on Wednesday, Augsburg pulled a goal back when Koo Ja-Cheol tapped home Daniel Baier's pass after Bayern centre-back Mats Hummels failed to clear the danger on 67 minutes. This was Augsburg's third straight loss in all competitions to leave them just above the relegation places. Munich, who are at PSV Eindhoven on Tuesday in the Champions League, are two points clear in the table, but second-placed Leipzig kept up the pressure with a 2-0 win at Darmstadt as Marcel Sabitzer scored both goals. Leipzig are now nine games unbeaten on their debut season in Germany's top flight -- just one short of the record for a newly promoted team. Freiburg are up to seventh after their 3-1 win at Werder Bremen thanks to goals by Maximilian Philipp, a Vincenzo Grifo penalty and a strike by Albanian international Amir Abrashi. Defender Santiago Garcia pulled a second-half goal back for Bremen, but the defeat leaves them 15th and just a point from the relegation places. Bayer Leverkusen warmed up for Wednesday's away Champions League match at Tottenham Hotspur with a 2-1 comeback win at VfL Wolfsburg, who remain in the relegation places. Wolfsburg, now winless in eight league games, took the lead when Maximilian Arnold converted a cross with the Leverkusen defence in pieces, leaving Roger Schmidt fuming from behind glass in a private box. The Leverkusen boss was completing his two-match ban for calling Hoffenheim's coach Julian Nagelsmann ""a nutter"" during last Saturday's 3-0 defeat which saw him banished to the stands. But Leverkusen roared back with two goals in five second-half minutes from Swiss striker Admir Mehmedi and Croatia international Tin Jedvaj to give Bayer their first win in five games to go 10th. Yunus Malli and Levin Oztunali scored in Mainz's 2-0 over second-from-bottom Ingolstadt, who had Max Christiansen sent off late on for a second yellow card."
49,28/10/2016,01:50,Bayern hunt quickfire second win over Augsburg,Bayern Munich face familiar opposition in neighbours Augsburg on Saturday as the Bundesliga leaders take on their Bavarian rivals for the second time in four days.,"Bayern beat Augsburg 3-1 on Wednesday in the second round of the German Cup as US international Julian Green -- deputising for striker Robert Lewandowski -- David Alaba and Philipp Lahm all scored. Carlo Ancelotti rested a host of stars including Arturo Vidal, Arjen Robben, Xabi Alonso and Lewandowski ahead of this weekend's league game at Augsburg's WWK-Arena stadium. The Munich giants need a win in their warm-up for next Tuesday's Champions League clash at PSV Eindhoven to ensure they remain clear at the summit. The top clash of the weekend is Saturday's Ruhr Valley derby between Borussia Dortmund and arch-rivals Schalke 04. Dortmund are unbeaten in their last three league meetings against Schalke but are struggling with a lengthy injury list and are winless in their last three Bundesliga games. Andre Schuerrle, Raphael Guerrerio, Marcel Schmelzer, Sven Bender, Erik Durm, Neven Subotic and Marco Reus are all either out injured or returning from injury. Dortmund hope to have striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang back from a calf knock after he missed Wednesday's nervy German Cup penalty shootout win over Union Berlin. Schalke made a disastrous start to the season when they lost their first five games, but Markus Weinzierl's side have steadied the ship by picking up seven points in the three matches since. Midfielder Nabil Bentaleb, on loan from Tottenham Hotspur, has been a revelation during the revival with three goals in his last two games. Schalke are eager to make his move permanent, but director of sport Christian Heidel says Spurs want at least 20 million euros ($21.8 million) for the Algeria international. ""It was a double-digit sum and there was a two at the front,"" Heidel said. Bentaleb is relishing his first Ruhr derby and likened it to a match against Spurs' north London rivals Arsenal. ""I don't know if you can compare it to a London derby, but I'm looking forward to it,"" said the 21-year-old. Unbeaten RB Leipzig, who trail Bayern by just two points, can take a step closer to a record when they face Darmstadt away. Under Austrian coach Ralph Hasenhuettl, Leipzig have won five of their first eight games with three draws. They are just two short of the record of 10 matches unbeaten, set by MSV Duisburg in 1993/94, for a side at the start of their first season in Germany's top flight. Wolfsburg and Bayer Leverkusen meet on Saturday with both coaches in desperate need of a victory. Leverkusen's Roger Schmidt serves the last of his two-match touchline ban for verbally abusing Hoffenheim's Julian Nagelsmann in last Saturday's 3-0 defeat. Leverkusen, who go to Tottenham in the Champions League on Wednesday, are winless in their last four games and suffered a shock German Cup defeat to third division Sportfreunde Lotte in midweek. Wolfsburg are without a win in seven league games and caretaker coach Valerien Ismael, who lost his first game 3-1 at strugglers Darmstadt, has been tasked with reversing the team's fortunes. Bottom club Hamburg, who are still winless after their first eight league games, are at Cologne on Sunday. Unbeaten Hoffenheim host fellow high-flyers Hertha Berlin in south-west Germany, with Pal Dardai's side suffering their lone defeat to Bayern and starting to look like realistic contenders for a Champions League place next season.

In Munich, Bayern coach Carlo Ancelotti rested a host of stars for Saturday's away Bundesliga clash -- also against Augsburg -- and next Tuesday's Champions League clash at PSV Eindhoven. Alaba, Holger Badstuber, Arjen Robben, Arturo Vidal, Xabi Alonso and Robert Lewandowski were all on the bench while US striker Green made a rare start. Bastuber came on for the last ten minutes for his first appearance in nearly nine months after injury. ""In the first galf we controlled the game, but we weren't so good after the break,"" admitted Ancelotti. ""I'm very pleased that Holger is back, he worked hard for it."" Bayern went ahead with two minutes gone when Thomas Mueller fed Lahm and the Bayern captain drilled home his shot. Mueller then floated in the cross which Green headed home to make it 2-0 on 41 minutes. Bayern defender Mats Hummels conceded a penalty on Augsburg midfielder Gojko Kacar, but Manuel Neuer came to the rescue when Germany's goalkeeper saved Koo Ja-Cheol's spot kick on 49 minutes. Augsburg pulled a goal back on the counter attack when Ji Dong-Won cut in and blasted his shot home from a tight angle on 69 minutes. But Alaba came on with five minutes to go and rifled home Bayern's third in the 94th minute to settle the result. Dortmund, missing a host of injured stars like Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Marco Reus, went through after a scare. Dortmund took the lead thanks to a first-half own goal from ex-Dortmund defender Michael Parensen, but Union striker Steven Skrzybski levelled with nine minutes left Goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller was Dortmund's hero with two saves in the shoot-out, while Ousmane Dembele, Matthias Ginter and Mario Goetze netted their spot-kicks. Schalke scrapped into the third round with a nervy 3-2 win over second-division Nuremberg. Ukraine winger Yevhen Konoplyanka scored twice as the Royal Blues raced into a 3-0 half-time lead. But Ghana defender Abdul Rahman Baba, on loan from Chelsea netted an own goal, then Tobias Kempe converted a penalty for Nuremberg to set up a tense final 20 minutes. Cologne beat Hoffenheim 2-1 as Anthony Modeste, the Bundesliga's top scorer, netted a 91st-winner in extra time as Hoffenheim suffered their first defeat of the season. There were several upsets elsewhere. Bundesliga club Darmstadt were humbled 1-0 by fourth division Astoria Walldorf while second division Greuther Fuerth sealed a 2-1 win over top-tier side Mainz. In total, seven top German league clubs exited at the second-round stage. On Tuesday, Champions League side Bayer Leverkusen lost on penalties to third-division Sportfreunde Lotte which leaves head coach Roger Schmidt under pressure. Freiburg were beaten by second-division Sandhausen and Eintracht Frankfurt beat Ingolstadt on penalties in an all-Bundesliga clash."

Bayern broke a three-match winless streak by thrashing PSV Eindhoven 4-1 last Wednesday in the Champions League, before beating Gladbach, but Rummenigge says they must maintain their current winning form at the Allianz Arena. ""The first-half display was perhaps the best performance of the season, which deserves praise, but in my experience, not too much,"" said Rummenigge. ""We must do exactly the same again on Wednesday."" Augsburg lost 2-1 to Freiburg on Saturday in Germany's top flight, but travel the 80 kilometres to Munich buoyed by results against Bayern in recent years. They have won two of their last five games against Bayern and beat Pep Guardiola's sidein both 2014 and 2015 under ex-coach Markus Weinzierl, who is now in charge of Schalke. Bayern, who beat Borussia Dortmund on penalties in the 2016 German Cup final in May, have lifted the trophy a record 18 times. Their only fitness concern is Franck Ribery, who sits out the match with a leg injury. Dortmund, who came back from two goals down to draw 3-3 at Ingolstadt on Saturday in the league, host second-division Union Berlin at Signal Iduna Park also on Wednesday. Borussia have a lengthy walking-wounded list with captain Marcel Schmelzer and Raphael Guerreiro out, while Sven Bender, Marco Reus, Neven Subotic and Erik Durm are all working their way back after injury. Bayer Leverkusen, another of Germany's Champions League representatives who were beaten 3-0 by Hoffenheim on Saturday in the Bundesliga, must be wary of third-division Sportfreunde Lotte, who knocked Werder Bremen out in the first round. Alongside the Bayern-Augsburg clash, the other all-Bundesliga matches see Eintracht Frankfurt play Ingolstadt on Tuesday, while Cologne host Hoffenheim on Wednesday.

The 30-year-old has won over 100 caps for Estonia and is well known to Liverpool's German manager Jurgen Klopp, a former Borussia Dortmund coach, after spending four seasons playing in the Bundesliga. Klavan, who featured in both legs of Augsburg's Europa League last-32 tie against Liverpool in February, will provide cover at centre-back as Mamadou Sakho and Joe Gomez are both currently injured and Tiago Ilori is heading to the Olympics with Portugal. The defender is Klopp's fifth close-season signing, following the arrival of goalkeeper Loris Karius, defender Joel Matip, midfielder Marko Grujic and forward Sadio Mane. ""I'm really honoured to be part of this amazing club, this amazing team,"" Klavan told Liverpool's website. ""It's hard to put it into words because it's been a dream of mine for 22 years to come to the Premier League and be a part of this amazing club, Liverpool.

53,20/03/2016,19:31,Ramos helps seal Dortmund comeback win,Second-placed Borussia Dortmund trimmed Bayern Munich's lead at the top of the Bundesliga to five points on Sunday with a superb 3-1 comeback win at Augsburg.,"Dortmund's Adrian Ramos, in for striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang who sat out after the death of his grandfather, played a big part in turning the game Borussia's way in the second-half. Augsburg took an shock lead at their WKK Arena when Iceland striker Alfred Finnbogason slotted home Brazilian winger Caiuby's cross on 16 minutes. But Dortmund winger Henrikh Mkhitaryan dragged his side back into the game with an equaliser just before the half-time whistle after superb passing from Marco Reus and Nuri Sahin. Ramos then came into his own, showing great skill in chesting down Mats Hummels' long ball for replacement Gonzalo Castro to fire home on 69 minutes. The Colombia international then netted on 75 minutes to give Dortmund the three points that keep them in touch with Pep Guardiola's Bayern. The defeat leaves Augsburg just above the relegation places on goal difference. Earlier, Bayer Leverkusen rejoined the fight for a Champions League qualifying berth with a 2-0 win at VfB Stuttgart that saw them break back into the top six. Goals by Julian Brandt and Karim Bellarabi handed Leverkusen a win that put them level on points with fifth-placed Borussia Moenchengladbach and two points behind Schalke, who sit in the fourth place that offers a spot in next season's Champions League play-offs. Germany Under-21 star Brandt gave the vistors the lead at Stuttgart's Mercedes Benz Arena on 11 minutes when he finished off a flowing attack. Bellarabi celebrated his call-up to the Germany squad for the forthcoming internationals against England and Italy by adding Leverkusen's second on 49 minutes. Brandt, 19, could have claimed his second of the game, but his shot hit the post when he got away from the Stuttgart defence with an hour gone. On Saturday, Robert Lewandowski's 25th league goal of the season gave leaders Bayern Munich a 1-0 win at Cologne. Hertha Berlin remain on course to qualify for the Champions League for the first time since 1999/2000 after a 2-1 victory over Ingolstadt in the capital kept them four points clear of Schalke in third. Wolfsburg, who will face Real Madrid in the Champions League quarter-finals next month, needed a last-minute Andre Schuerrle equaliser to grab a 1-1 draw at home to Darmstadt as they stay eighth.

Despite their midweek Europa League exertions and exit at the hands of Liverpool, Augsburg, who are 13th, roared back with two goals in quick succession. Iceland striker Alfred Finnbogason thumped a header home on 50 minutes, his first goal since joining from Olympiakos, before Brazil winger Caiuby slotted neatly home just three minutes later. Gladbach's American winger Fabian Johnson however gave the perfect answer as he smashed home his shot on 55 minutes to make it 2-2. The visitors should have won as Sweden's Oscar Wendt fired wide late on with the goal at his mercy while only a Marwin Hitz save denied Borussia captain Granit Xhaka. Gladbach could be usurped from fourth if Bayer Leverkusen win later on Sunday at Mainz. Also playing later Sunday are second-placed Borussia Dortmund, who are hosting second-bottom Hoffenheim. Meawhile it was back to business for Bayern Munich after their midweek Champions league drtaw at Juventus, they racked up yet another win on Saturday. Robert Lewandowski scored his 23rd league goal of the season as Bayern went 11 points clear with a 2-0 win at Wolfsburg. Pep Guardiola's outfit now have 62 points out of a possible 69, their tally exactly double that of Wolfsburg, who are eighth. Bayern could effectively wrap up the league title with two victories in the coming week, at home to Mainz on Wednesday and then at Dortmund in next Saturday's key match. A tight struggle in Wolfsburg was settled by second-half goals as Kingsley Coman scored for the first time since November before Lewandowski netted for the 33rd time this season in all competitions. Elsewhere, bottom side Hanover gained ground in the relegation battle with a shock 2-1 win at Stuttgart after an eight-match losing streak.

Both sides are in mid-table, but Werder Bremen are deep in the relegation battle despite their 2-2 draw at home to Darmstadt. Anthony Ujah's early opener was cancelled out by Darmstadt's Sandro Wagner, and Aytac Sulu headed Darmstadt ahead on 82 minutes before Claudio Pizarro gave Bremen a 90th-minute equaliser. On Friday, Hertha Berlin strengthened their grip on third place with a 1-0 victory at Cologne as Vedad Ibisevic scored the winner to break their run of six games without a win."

Fans have clamoured for tickets for the round of 32, first-leg clash at the WWK Arena in deepest Bavaria to see Liverpool, who are unbeaten in their six European games under Klopp and buoyed by Sunday's thrashing of Aston Villa. Augsburg received 5,000 applications for just 2,000 away tickets for the Liverpool game, which will be a 26,160 sell-out, with the return leg at Anfield on February 25, just three days before the Reds play Manchester City in the League Cup final. While he is looking forward to returning home, Klopp is focused on the job in hand. ""During the draw, I wasn't thinking 'please let it be a German club'. At that point, I'd only been away for four months,"" he admitted. ""I'm looking forward to coming to Germany, but it's work and it's not as though I've been waiting for it. ""(For Augsburg) Liverpool would have been an exciting enough draw, without a German coach (being involved). ""The stadium would have already been full."" Liverpool arrive in Bavaria buoyed by their 6-0 drubbing of Villa which left them eighth in the Premier League. After a mid-season injury glut, Liverpool are getting back to a fully fit squad. Daniel Sturridge, Philippe Coutinho and Divock Origi all played in the drubbing of Villa after recent injuries. Sturridge, who scored the opener at Villa Park, made his first start since early October, while it was Coutinho's first start since January 5. Klopp is expected to name a strong side, as Liverpool do not have any games between the two legs after being knocked out of the FA Cup by West Ham earlier this month. In the Bundesliga, Augsburg are 14th, just a point from the relegation places after Sunday's 3-1 defeat at home to runaway league leaders Bayern Munich.

""This is an aboslute dream game for all of us at Augsburg,"" said the club's director of sport Stefan Reuter, while coach Markus Weinzierl described it as a ""highlight in the club's history"". From his Dortmund days, Klopp knows all about Augsburg, who qualified for the Europa League by finishing fifth last season, their highest placing in the club's history. Klopp has faced Augsburg ten times while in charge of either Dortmund or Mainz and has lost only once in five games as a coach at the WWK Arena. The Bavarians have struggled with their key playmaker Daniel Baier out with a fractured ankle since the start of January.

Both matches have long since been a sell-out. The club received 5,000 applications for just 2,000 away tickets for the Liverpool game with Klopp set to make his first appearance in Germany since leaving Borussia Dortmund to coach Liverpool. But first, Markus Weinzierl is chasing his third win over Bayern as Augsburg coach as they hunt for precious points to keep them away from relegation fight with just one win in their last five matches. Curiously, Augsburg have beaten Bayern in each of the last two seasons, but the shock results always came after Bayern had already won the league title at a canter. ""In each of the last two seasons, we have beaten Bayern, but we know that on both occasions we caught them at a good time,"" said Weinzierl. ""On Sunday, Bayern will want to win the game will certainly be highly motivated. ""We need a really good day and the support from our fans."" Augsburg have won just five league games all season, but Bayern coach Pep Guardiola expects a battle. ""I don't look at what we have done, this is a derby against a good opponent,"" said Guardiola and as Bayern forward Thomas Mueller succinctly put it: ""there are definitely more pleasant tasks than Augsburg away in February. ""I don't expect them to wave the white flag at home."" Guardiola is expected to be without superstars Franck Ribery and World Cup-winner Mario Goetze as both continue to work their way back to fitness after injury. Midfielder Xabi Alonso is suspended after being sent off in last weekend's goalless draw with Bayer Leverkusen. New signing Serdar Tasci is expected to make his debut in defence after suffering concussion in his first training session since joining on loan for the season from Spartak Moscow. Augsburg will be without midfield playmaker Daniel Baier, who has fractured his ankle.

At the same stage, more than four decades ago, Mueller had 17 goals, one less than Aubameyang, who has also scored twice in the cup and hit seven in the Europa League. ""I don't know where his limit is and I don't think he knows himself,"" Dortmund's director of sport Michel Zorc told German daily die Welt. ""The most important thing for Pierre-Emerick is to stick to what he's doing, because now the adulation is coming his way from all corners.""

Bundesliga bottom side Stuttgart needed extra-time to book their place in the last eight with a 3-2 win over second division Eintracht Braunschweig. Bochum join Heidenheim as the only other second division side in the last eight draw after their 2-0 win at 1860 Munich. In Tuesday's cup ties, a thunderbolt of a volley from Spain international Xabi Alonso booked Bayern Munich's place in the quarter-finals after a 1-0 win over Darmstadt. Having knocked out holders Wolfsburg in the previous round, Pep Guardiola's remain the team to beat in the cup. Werder Bremen went through at Borussia Moenchengladbach as they claimed a shock 4-3 win over the hosts to progress. Javier Hernandez claimed his 16th goal in just 13 games for Bayer Leverkusen when he scored in their 3-1 win at fourth division Unterhaching.

After losing in the league for the first time this season with a 3-1 humbling at Gladbach last Saturday, Bayern produced a subdued performance at the Allianz Arena before pulling away with two second-half goals. Bayern coach Pep Guardiola gave Lahm a note on 58 minutes which contained tactical instructions which had an almost immediate effect. Lewandowski claimed his 15th league goal of the season when he pounced on Jerome Boateng's long pass on 65 minutes before Lahm struck with 15 minutes left. With second-placed Borussia Dortmund playing at Eintracht Frankfurt on Sunday evening, Bayern took their chance to go eight points clear. Gladbach crashed to their first defeat in 11 league games under coach Andre Schubert in a 5-0 hammering at Bayer Leverkusen, for whom Javier Hernandez claimed a hat-trick. 'Chicharito' needed just 13 second-half minutes to score his three goals with ex-Germany striker Stefan Kiessling also scoring either side of half-time for Leverkusen, who are sixth after only their second win in their last nine games. Gladbach are fifth. Hertha Berlin took the chance to leapfrog Gladbach into third when they romped to a 4-0 win at Darmstadt as Bosnia striker Vedad Ibisevic scored twice, Marvin Plattenhardt hit a free-kick and Salomon Kalou netted a fourth. Fresh from Tuesday's Champions League win over Manchester United, which confirmed their place in the last 16 as group winners, fourth-placed Wolfsburg laboured to a 1-1 draw at home to Hamburg. Werder Bremen continue to hover just above the relegation places after a 1-1 draw at home to Cologne as Nigeria striker Anthony Ujah had a first-half penalty saved for the hosts. Hoffenheim enjoyed their first win since September when Jonathan Schmid's first-half goal sealed their 1-0 win at home to Hanover 96 which lifted them to 17th. Stuttgart are bottom again after their goalless draw at Mainz on Friday."
62,21/11/2015,17:53,Wolfsburg warm-up for Moscow by hammering Bremen,Germany striker Max Kruse netted twice in Wolfsburg's 6-0 rout of Werder Bremen in the German league on Saturday to warm-up for Wednesday's key Champions League clash in Moscow.,"In Europe, Wolfsburg are third in Group B, but just a point behind leaders Manchester United ahead of their penultimate group game at bottom side CSKA Moscow in the Russian capital on Wednesday. The Germans still have every chance of qualifying for the knock-out stages and consolidated third in the German league table by hammering Bremen. There was a minute's silence at all Bundesliga grounds this weekend -- the players also wore black armbands -- out of respect for the victims of the Paris terror attacks. Stuttgart's 4-0 thumping at home to Augsburg was delayed by 15 minutes due to the tightened security checks at stadiums across the country. There were no such problems at Wolfsburg's Volkswagen Arena as Bremen gifted their hosts the opener when defender Alejandro Galvez slid the ball into his own net on 11 minutes. Kruse put Wolfsburg 2-0 up at the break by heading home a free-kick then Portugal international Vierinha scored from the right wing on 56 minutes. The floodgates opened when French defensive midfielder, on for the injured Brazil star Luiz Gustavo, stabbed home his shot on 67 minutes. Kruse then set up Netherlands striker Bas Dost on 78 minutes before completing the scoring three minutes from time by converting a cross from Germany team-mate Andre Schuerrle to leave him with five league goals for the season. The result leaves Wolfsburg five points behind second-placed Borussia Dortmund who lost 3-1 at Hamburg on Friday night, while leaders Bayern Munich play at Schalke on Saturday evening. Ex-Manchester United star Javier Hernandez now has 12 goals for Bayer Leverkusen in all competitions after scoring twice in their 3-1 win at Eintracht Frankfurt. Christmas came early for 'Chicharito' in Frankfurt when Eintracht centre-back David Abraham allowed a cross to roll between his legs and the grateful Hernandez stabbed home on 11 minutes. The Mexico striker doubled his tally on 39 minutes when a Hakan Calhanoglu pass split the Frankfurt defence. Hernandez did the rest, but it finished 2-1 at the break when Serbian midfielder Slobodan Medojevic slammed in a powerful header on the stroke of half-time. Calhanoglu made sure of the three points by scoring Leverkusen's third on 72 minutes. Augsburg climbed off the bottom of the table with an emphatic 4-0 win at VfB Stuttgart. Woeful defending by the hosts allowed Augsburg to race into an early 2-0 lead with both goals by midfielder Alexander Esswein. Defender Jan-Ingwer Callsen-Bracker grabbed a third before former South Korea captain Koo Ja-Cheol scored Augsburg's fourth when he hit the top right-hand corner from 10 metres out on 54 minutes. The Rhine derby finished goalless as Mainz drew at Cologne as the hosts abandoned plans to play in a special-edition carnival-themed shirt out of respect for those who died in Paris."
63,25/10/2015,17:51,Aubameyang hits hat-trick as Dortmund down Augsburg,Gabon striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang netted a hat-trick on Sunday as Borussia Dortmund ran riot in a 5-1 home win over Augsburg to stay second in the Bundesliga.,"Dortmund trimmed the gap at the top back to seven points behind run-away leaders Bayern Munich as Aubameyang took his tally to 13 goals in 10 league games to become the league's joint top-scorer alongside Bayern's Robert Lewandowski. This was an emphatic victory for Dortmund, who tore the Augsburg defence to pieces as Japan midfielder Shinji Kagawa set up three of the goals. Aubameyang claimed the third hat-trick in his two years at Dortmund. He opened his account by finishing off a superb move for the opener on 18 minutes, started by right-back Matthias Ginter on the flank, as a series of quick passes saw Ilkay Gundogan provide the striker with a simple tap in. Reus doubled the lead on 21 minutes when he fired home a superbly worked cross from Kagawa and the fleet-footed winger claimed his second with Kagawa again providing the final pass. It was 3-0 at the break, but Augsburg striker Raul Bobadilla pulled a goal back when he out-jumped Mats Hummels from a free-kick to head home on 49 minutes. It proved to be no more than a consolation as Aubameyang grabbed his second on 85 minutes, then took advantage of another good Kagawa pass to delay his shot before beating Augsburg goalkeeper Roman Burki on 91 minutes. On Saturday, Arjen Robben netted on his return from injury as Bayern romped to a 4-0 home win against Cologne to claim their 10th straight win this season and 1000th victory in the Bundesliga. Netherlands captain Robben scored in his first match since August after a groin strain while Arturo Vidal, Lewandowski and Thomas Mueller also got on the scoresheet. Wolfsburg stayed fourth with a 1-0 win at Darmstadt as Daniel Caligiuri hit their 78th minute winner. Fresh from their 4-4 draw at home to Roma in the Champions League on Tuesday, Bayer Leverkusen had to come from 2-0 down before beating Stuttgart 4-3 in another thriller. Stuttgart took a 2-0 lead through Martin Harnik and Daniel Didavi before Germany winger Karim Bellarabi made it 2-1 on 57 minutes. Midfielder Lukas Rupp netted for the visitors' to make it 3-1 with an hour played when two goals in two minutes levelled the scores before Swiss striker Admir Mehmedi netted the 89th-minute winner. The victory lifted Leverkusen to sixth while Stuttgart remain in the bottom three. Nigeria striker Anthony Ujah scored twice as Werder Bremen broke their five-match losing streak with a 3-1 win at Mainz where Japan striker Yoshinori Muto scored the hosts' consolation goal in the 90th minute. The result lifted Bremen out of the relegation zone and up to 14th while Mainz dropped to 13th. Midfielder Marc Stendera was Eintracht Frankfurt's star with both of their second-half goals in a 2-1 comeback victory at Hanover 96, who hang just above the relegation places. Hertha Berlin are fifth after their 1-0 win at Bavarian side Ingolstadt on Saturday night when ex-Bayern Munich midfielder Mitchell Weiser scored the winner after just 11 minutes. Ten-man Hoffenheim are second-from-bottom after their 1-0 defeat to Hamburg on Friday thanks to Pierre-Michel Lasogga's late winner. Hoffenheim's Bosnian defender Ermin Bicakcic was sent off for a second yellow card."
64,29/09/2015,13:07,Gladbach confirm interest in Augsburg's Weinzierl,"Borussia Moenchengladbach sports director Max Eberl has confirmed approaching Markus Weinzierl, coach of their Bundesliga rivals Augsburg, following Lucien Favre's shock resignation.","Gladbach host Manchester City in the Champions League on Wednesday. They have won their last two games under caretaker coach Andre Schubert after Favre resigned ten days ago in the wake of five straight league defeats which left Borussia bottom of the Bundesliga. Weinzierl, 40, has forged a good reputation in Germany having steered Bavarian side Augsburg to finish fifth last season -- the best placing in the club's history -- to qualify for this season's Europa League. ""In football everything is possible and we have been thinking in all directions,"" Eberl, 42, said on Monday at a sponsors event when asked about Markus Weinzierl. ""I am pleased with the way things have gone for him, he has not only been consistent, but also successful."" Weinzierl has a contract at Augsburg until 2019, but Eberl says he is not deterred. On Sunday, Augsburg president Klaus Hofmann said they had already been approached about their coach. ""I can't forbid Gladbach to talk to Markus Weinzierl,"" Hofmann told Sky. ""We already had a discussion in May and June with Schalke, but he decided to stay with Augsburg despite a huge offer. ""I believe the situation will stay that way until 2019."" Eberl and Weinzierl used to play against each other as youth team players in Bavaria. ""He was a much better footballer than me,"" said Eberl. ""But in football, you can always meet again."""

""I've always felt comfortable at Augsburg and now have the feeling of coming home,"" said Koo, who passed the medical on Monday before the transfer window closed. ""It's great that it worked out at such short notice. ""Now I am looking forward to being back at the club and I want to help the team achieve their goals in the Bundesliga, cup and Europa League."" After signing his Augsburg contract on Tuesday, Koo, who captained Korea at the 2014 World Cup, flew off to link up with the squad for their Russia 2018 qualifiers at home to Laos on Thursday and away to Lebanon next Tuesday. His new club said they were delighted to have Koo back after the Korean scored eight goals in 36 league games for Augsburg. ""We were in regular contact with Koo Ja-Cheol after his departure and we took the chance to have him back as soon as it emerged,"" said Augsburg's director of sport Stefan Reuter. ""He knows the club, the environment as well as the team and coach, so he won't need much time to settle back in here. ""From a sporting perspective, he will help us in attack to get more width on our game."""
66,16/08/2015,20:23,Augsburg confirm Baba's transfer to Chelsea,"Germany's Augsburg confirmed on Sunday they have sold Ghana international defender Abdul Rahman Baba to Premier League champions Chelsea for a reported fee of 19.8 million euros (£14 million, $21.9m).","With bonuses, the deal could exceed 30 million euros -- more than Augsburg's budget for the season. The 21-year-old cost just 2.5 million euros ($2.7m) when he joined Augsburg last year from German second-division club Greuther Fuerth, who are now set to get a 25 percent share from his sale to Chelsea. ""Abdul Baba Rahman has developed enormously is his one year with us and made a giant leap,"" said Augsburg's chief executive Stefan Reuter. ""It's not just a reward for his performances, but also for our work, if an international giant like Chelsea shows interest."" Baba passed a medical on Saturday and is off to battle for the Blues' left-back berth following the departure of Brazil defender Filipe Luis back to Atletico Madrid after only one season at Stamford Bridge. ""I have to take this opportunity to play at a top club in England, even if I had planned on a long-term stay at Augsburg only a year ago,"" said Baba. Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho welcomed the news. ""It is important because he is a left-back, so he can compete with (Cesar) Azpilicueta,"" said Mourinho after his team's 3-0 defeat to Manchester City. ""At the same time, Azpilicueta can compete with (Branislav) Ivanovic for the right-back position, so he replaces Filipe Luis in the balance of the squad."" Rahman has made 13 appearances for the Black Stars and played in the African Cup of Nations defeat to the Ivory Coast on penalties in the final in January."
67,15/08/2015,19:10,Augsburg's Baba poised to join Chelsea,Augsburg manager Stefan Reuter confirmed Saturday that Ghana's Abdul Rahman Baba is poised to join English champions Chelsea with the deal set to net the Germans up to 30 million euros ($33m).,"""All that is missing is the signature,"" said Reuter after Augsburg's 1-0 defeat to Hertha Berlin on the opening weekend of the season. The left-back was missing from Augsburg's matchday squad against Hertha having undergone a medical check for the Blues in Paris while a British work visa is arranged. The Blues have targeted the Augsburg defender following the departure of Brazil defender Filipe Luis to Atletico Madrid after just one season at Stamford Bridge. The 21-year-old Ghana international cost Augsburg just 2.5 million euros ($2.7m) when he joined from Greuther Fuerth in 2014 after signing a five-year contract. The transfer fee is set to be £14 million (19.8 million euros, $21.9m), with further bonuses of up to ten million euros built into the contract, depending on Rahman's number of appearances for Chelsea and the London club's future success. Rahman has made 13 appearances for the Black Stars and played in the African Cup of Nations defeat to the Ivory Coast on penalties in the final in January."
68,15/08/2015,16:59,Bobadilla sees red after penning new Augsburg deal,"Paraguay striker Raul Bobadilla penned a contract extension at Augsburg until 2018, only to be sent off after just 45 minutes into the new Bundesliga season on Saturday.","The 28-year-old Bobadilla was shown a second yellow card, and the subsequent red, when he was booked just before the half-time whistle at home to Hertha Berlin. Having caught Hertha captain Fabian Lustenberger in the face early on, Bobadilla was booked with five minutes gone and was then shown his second card when he caught Lustenberger on the hip during added time at the end of the first-half. Augsburg have qualified for the Europa League this season for the first time in their history and Bobadilla was a key factor by scoring ten goals and providing four assists to help the Bavarians finish fifth in the table last season. Buenos Aires-born Bobadilla, who has made eight international appearances for Paraguay, joined Augsburg from FC Basel in 2013 and is in his second stint in the Bundesliga after playing for Borussia Moenchengladbach from 2009-11."
69,09/05/2015,17:48,Ten-man Bayern suffer fourth straight defeat,"Ten-man Bayern Munich suffered a morale-sapping fourth straight defeat by losing 1-0 to Augsburg on Saturday ahead of their mission-impossible Champions League semi-final, second-leg against Barcelona.","Augsburg's Paraguay striker Raul Bobadilla followed on from Barcelona's Lionel Messi by inflicting more misery on Bundesliga champions Bayern. Bayern host Barca in Tuesday's home semi-final facing an uphill task having been routed 3-0 in Spain, when Messi scored twice, which followed defeats to Borussia Dortmund in the German Cup semi-final and a league defeat at Bayer Leverkusen. ""It's not easy, after the defeat to Barcelona, to play 80 minutes with a man down,"" said Bayern coach Pep Guardiola, who is missing injured wingers Franck Ribery and Arjen Robben. ""We haven't got any more wingers, so our wing-backs have to attack as well."" On Tuesday's clash with his former club Barcelona, Guardiola added: ""If we just focus on scoring goals, we will lose heavily. ""We have to stay calm and try to control our game."" Guardiola named a near full-strength team against Augsburg, resting only Xabi Alonso and goalkeeper Manuel Neuer. But the German giants played nearly 80 minutes with ten men after reserve goalkeeper Pepe Reina was shown a straight red card. Neuer came on to face a penalty after Reina was sent off with just 13 minutes gone for fouling Bobadilla. Dutch defender Paul Verhaegh hit the post with the resulting spot-kick having beaten the diving Neuer. Mario Goetze then hit the Augsburg post early on and striker Robert Lewandowski clattered the crossbar late in the first-half for Bayern. Augsburg grabbed the winner when Danish midfielder Pierre-Emile Hoejbjerg, on loan from Bayern, put in a cross which Bobadilla deftly back-heeled past Neuer on 71 minutes. With two games left, Borussia Moenchengladbach are virtually assured a direct Champions League place next season after their 3-0 win over Bayer Leverkusen moved them up to second. Germany striker Max Kruse, who is set to join Wolfsburg next season, put them ahead when he converted Patrick Herrmann's 50th-minute pass before the Gladbach winger added their second on 81 minutes. Guinea forward Ibrahima Traore then claimed his second in two games when he blasted the third in from the right two minutes from time. The win moves Lucien Favre's Gladbach up to second ahead of Wolfsburg, who are at Paderborn on Sunday. Borussia Dortmund are on the verge of a Europa League place next season after enjoying a 2-0 win at home to Hertha Berlin. Goals by defenders Neven Subotic and Erik Durm lifted Dortmund to seventh and two points behind sixth-placed neighbours Schalke who are at Cologne on Sunday. With Germany winger Marco Reus rested, Subotic headed home on nine minutes before Henrikh Mkhitaryan provided his second assist when his pass found Durm and the World Cup-winner rifled home his first goal of the season on 47 minutes. Hanover remain third from bottom after their 1-1 draw at home to Werder Bremen. Stuttgart stayed in last place despite their 2-0 home win over Mainz thanks to goals by Daniel Didavi and Filip Kostic which means just two points separate the bottom five clubs. Mid-table Eintracht Frankfurt enjoyed a 3-1 win over Hoffenheim while Hamburg stayed above the relegation places with a 1-1 draw at home to Freiburg on Friday thanks to Gojko Kacar's 90th-minute equaliser."
70,05/04/2015,17:39,"Schalke, Augsburg suffer Champions League setback",Schalke 04 and Augsburg's hopes of reaching next season's Champions League suffered a setback on Sunday after their goalless Bundesliga draw in Bavaria.,"Roberto di Matteo's Schalke remain fifth in the German league, eight points behind fourth-placed Leverkusen, with the top four in Germany's top flight qualifying for next season's Champions League and only seven games left. Sixth-placed Augsburg are a point behind Schalke and are also destined to play in the Europa League next season alongside Di Matteo's Royal Blues if they keep their current place. Both sides had their chances at Augsburg's SGL Arena with Schalke's Dutch striker Klaas-Jan Huntelaar squandering four chances, while Augsburg's Argentine striker Raul Bobadilla had four of his sides 20 shots on Schalke's goal. On Saturday, Robert Lewandowski scored against his ex-club Borussia Dortmund to seal league leaders' Bayern Munich's 1-0 win which keeps them on course for a third Bundesliga title. Lewandowski's 35th-minute header clinched Bayern's win which left them ten points clear at the top of the table. Their victory underlines Bayern's domination in Germany and came without injured stars David Alaba, Arjen Robben and Franck Ribery, while Germany captain Bastian Schweinsteiger limped off with an ankle injury and is doubtful for Wednesday's German Cup quarter-final at Bayer Leverkusen. Dortmund's best chance was when Marco Reus' second-half free-kick was superbly saved by Manuel Neuer as Borussia suffered their first league defeat since the start of February. Earlier, Borussia Moenchengladbach and Bayer Leverkusen posted big wins as the battle for third-place, and an automatic Champions League spot, intensifies. Third-placed Gladbach enjoyed an impressive 4-1 comeback win at Hoffenheim which keeps them two-points clear of Leverkusen, who posted a 4-0 win at home to over hapless Hamburg. Hosts Hoffenheim took the lead at home to Gladbach when forward Sven Schipplock enjoyed a simple tap-in on 17 minutes, but Gladbach proved their mettle with three goals in ten first-half minutes as winger Patrick Herrmann scored twice. Fourth-placed Leverkusen also underlined their Champions League pedigree by putting Hamburg to the sword and are currently on course for a play-off place. With the team third from bottom and on course for a first relegation from Germany's top flight, Hamburg sacked Joe Zinnbauer ten days ago, but his successor Peter Knaebel could only watch as his team was thrashed as Gonzalo Castro and Stefan Kiessling both scored twice for Leverkusen. Second-placed Wolfsburg remain seven points clear of Gladbach with a 3-1 win at home to bottom VfB Stuttgart. Swiss midfielder Ricardo Rodriguez converted a penalty and a free-kick either side of half-time before ex-Chelsea winger Andre Schuerrle came off the bench to add their third. Freiburg find themselves three-points clear of the relegation zone after their 1-0 win at home to Cologne while Hanover dropped to just above the bottom three with a 2-2 draw at Eintracht Frankfurt. Hanover's Ivory Coast striker Didier Ya Konan rescued his team with a late equaliser, his first for the north German club since his six month sojourn at Saudi Arabian side Al Ittihad Jeddah."

Fifth-placed Augsburg are enjoying one of the best seasons in the club's history and romped to a 3-1 win over Hoffenheim on Sunday while Dortmund are enduring their worst season for 30 years. Borussia are waiting on the fitness of defender Lukasz Piszczek and midfielder Ilkay Gundogan while new signing Kevin Kampl is set to make his home debut at Borussia's Westfalenstadion. Despite the 14-point lead his team holds over Dortmund in the Bundesliga table, Augsburg coach Markus Weinzierl says they are underdogs. ""We will face an opponent who has a very strong squad and, although it sounds strange to say this with fifth place playing against 18th, they are certainly the favourites,"" said Weinzierl on Tuesday. ""With their fans behind them, Dortmund will do everything to get the three points and climb out of the bottom three. ""The situation is very interesting for us and explosive for Dortmund, because they have to win."" Klopp has said points are Dortmund's priority by insisting ""I can't preach about relegation and in the next breath demand Champagne football"" in the battle to stay up. ""We have to take the next step against Augsburg by using the advantage of playing in our own stadium,"" said Klopp, whose side face Juventus away in the Champions League's last 16, first leg, in three weeks. ""We can't worry about style in times like these, it's about points -- we need results."" Klopp's side was criticised for a lack of eye-catching football at Leverkusen, which the Dortmund boss fails to understand. ""Once we get some confidence back, then some of our footballing elements will return, but you can't please everyone,"" he added."
72,08/01/2015,18:31,Hoejbjerg pens Bayern extension until 2018,Danish international midfielder Pierre-Emile Hoejbjerg on Thursday extended his contract with Bayern Munich until June 2018 before going on loan to Augsburg until the end of the season.,"""It clearly demonstrates to Pierre-Emile Hoejbjerg that Bayern are counting on him for the future, and at the same time, his loan to Augsburg is a good solution for him to collect playing time before returning to us,"" explained club sporting director Matthias Sammer. Hoejbjerg, 19, played 13 times for the double champions this season. Augsburg are sixth in the Bundesliga 18 points behind fellow Bavarians Bayern."

After a goalless first-half, Bayern burst into life after the interval as Arjen Robben netted twice while Medhi Benatia and Robert Lewandowski were also on target. Despite the drubbing, Bayern's Bavarian neighbours Augsburg remain third in the table. Centre-back Benatia headed his first Bayern goal on 58 minutes, then Robben slotted his ninth in all competitions just two minutes later when he hit the top left-hand corner. Poland striker Lewandowski claimed their third when he fired home a final pass from captain Bastian Schweinsteiger on 68 minutes. Robben added the fourth three minutes later as Augsburg's defence capitulated. Bayern, who started with Thomas Mueller and Mario Goetze on the bench, can further hammer home their superiority later this week when they host Freiburg on Tuesday before travelling to face Mainz on Friday in their last league match of 2014. Despite qualifying for the Champions League's last 16, Borussia Dortmund dropped back into the relegation places after slumping to a 1-0 defeat at Hertha Berlin. Dortmund's ninth defeat in 15 league games -- the most in Germany's top flight -- saw them drop to 16th from 14th having started December at the bottom. To rub salt into the wounds, Julian Schieber scored the first-half winner against his old club. Dortmund coach Jurgen Klopp swapped attacking midfielder Heinrikh Mkhitaryan for Poland's Jakob Blaszczkowski with 35 minutes gone, but the move backfired. Blaszczkowski lost possession in midfield, Norway's Per Skjelbred pounced on the loose ball and fed Berlin striker Schieber, who fired home on 40 minutes. Only Hanover 96's 3-3 draw at Werder Bremen prevented Dortmund dropping to second from bottom. Spanish striker Joselu scored twice for Hanover to claim four goals in his last three league games. Having scraped into the Champions League's last 16 with a 1-0 win at Slovenia's Maribor on Wednesday, Schalke 04 slumped to a 2-1 defeat at home to Cologne. Nigeria striker Anthony Ujah scored his fourth goal in five league games just after the break before midfielder Matthias Lehmann netted a penalty. Teenage replacement Leroy Sane scored his first goal for Schalke by way of consolation on only the 18-year-old's fourth league appearance as Schalke dropped to sixth. Hamburg were held to a goalless draw at Freiburg with both teams just above the bottom three. On Sunday, fourth-placed Bayer Leverkusen host Borussia Moenchengladbach with Lucien Favre's side just one place behind in the league table. On Friday, Hoffenheim enoyed a 3-2 win at Eintracht Frankfurt to stay seventh and just outside the European places for next season."

That result may have only come after Bayern had wrapped up the title, but it gives Augsburg reason to believe they can once again spring a surprise against the dominant force not just in the region, but in the whole country. Midfielder Tobias Werner acknowledged that it will be ""a mammoth task"" for his side, but added: ""It's one we're looking forward to. We've already shown we can cause Bayern problems."" Bayern make the short 70-kilometre trip fresh from wrapping up their Champions League group-stage campaign with a routine 3-0 victory against CSKA Moscow in midweek. The reigning champions have dropped just six points, and conceded only three goals, in an unbeaten start to the campaign and are seven points clear of VfL Wolfsburg at the top of the table. However, Augsburg, who were promoted to the top flight for the first time in 2011, are enjoying a superb season in their own right under Markus Weinzierl. The 39-year-old, who spent time on the books at Bayern as a player in the 1990s, has taken his team to third place, the highest the club has ever been in the Bundesliga, thanks to a club-record run of four consecutive wins. ""It'll be an interesting game. They've been very good in recent years and if my memory serves me correctly we didn't do too well there last season. It's difficult to play there,"" said Bayern's World Cup final hero Mario Goetze. Elsewhere, Wolfsburg, after a decisive Europa League trip to Lille on Thursday, will be looking for a ninth win in 10 Bundesliga games when they host Paderborn on Sunday. Meanwhile, fourth-placed Bayer Leverkusen, one of four German clubs through to the last 16 of the Champions League, entertain Borussia Moenchengladbach. Leverkusen this week welcomed Stefan Reinartz, who has been out since October with a fractured eye socket, back to training, although he will not be ready for a return to the team yet. However, the match will see Germany midfielder Christoph Kramer return to face his parent club just days after confirming he would rejoin Leverkusen next summer at the end of his two-year loan to Gladbach. Borussia Dortmund, another of Germany's Champions League hopefuls, go to Hertha Berlin bidding to make it back-to-back Bundesliga wins for the first time since September. Jurgen Klopp's men beat Hoffenheim 1-0 last time out, but they remain just a point clear of the relegation zone after an underwhelming start to the season. However, Hertha's own form has been poor - the capital club have lost four of their last five matches. Klopp confirmed that Australian goalkeeper Mitchell Langerak is set to continue in goal after being selected ahead of Roman Weidenfeller for his side's last two matches. ""Little details worked in Mitch's favour. He's done well so far and provided nothing untoward happens then he'll be in goal for our three matches this week,"" said Klopp. Fixtures (kick-offs 1430 GMT unless stated)"

Huntelaar scored his seventh goal of the season in all competitions after Japan defender Atsuto Uchida won possession in his own half and fed the Dutch striker after a superb piece of play. The victory may have come at a heavy price ahead of Wednesday's trip to Sporting Lisbon in the Champions League after Schalke's Germany midfielder Julian Draxler went off with a thigh injury after only four minutes.

Eintracht Frankfurt are playing at tailenders Hamburg later Sunday with a chance to move to nine points as well, with their hosts hoping to finally score a goal this season. Reigning champions Bayern Munich extended their lead on Saturday with a 2-0 win at FC Cologne. Bayern kept a clean sheet for their fourth straight Bundesliga match to move to 14 points, two points clear of Borussia Moenchengladbach. Pep Guardiola's Munich opened on 19 minutes as Mario Goetze struck his third goal in the last two matches. The visitors continued to press Cologne and finally doubled the lead midway through the second half as Daniel Halfar put through his own net. Meanwhile, Gladbach won 2-1 at Paderborn thanks to early goals from Patrick Herrmann and Raffael, with Jens Wimmer getting one back for the promoted club, who had been top of the table before losing at Bayern in midweek. Gladbach's win took them above Leverkusen, who had to play more than an hour with 10 men but held on for a 0-0 draw away at SC Freiburg. Leverkusen defender Emir Spahic was sent off in the first half, although Freiburg also finished the game a man down after Pavel Krmas was dismissed. The visitors might have won it but Karim Bellarabi and Son Heung-Min both hit the crossbar in the final 17 minutes. In Gelsenkirchen, Schalke 04 picked up their second straight victory with a 2-1 win at home over bitter rivals Borussia Dortmund. Dortmund's recent defensive struggles continued as goals from Joel Matip and Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting left them trailing 2-0 by the midway point in the first half. Jurgen Klopp's side did reduce the deficit shortly afterwards courtesy of a Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang strike but they could not find an equaliser and have collected only seven points from six games this season, one less than Schalke. In Wolfsburg, Ivica Olic scored in the 57th minute to secure VfL Wolfsburg a 2-1 victory at home against Werder Bremen to jump to seventh with eight points. After Ricardo Rodriguez pushed Wolfsburg ahead in the 15th minute, Marnon Busch equalised for Bremen after 37 minutes. Elsewhere, Hanover 96 went down 1-0 at struggling VfB Stuttgart, Daniel Schwaab scoring his team's first goal at home this season in the 69th minute, while Mainz and Hoffenheim played out a scoreless draw on Friday, the result leaving both teams with 10 points."
78,29/08/2014,02:16,Klopp urges Dortmund to let rip in Augsburg,Borussia Dortmund manager Jurgen Klopp has called for his team to show their true colours in Augsburg on Friday following their defeat against Bayer Leverkusen last weekend.,"Augsburg also lost 2-0 at Hoffenheim in their opening Bundesliga fixture, meaning that the home side and Dortmund prop up the standings ahead of their game at the SGL Arena. Roman Weidenfeller should start in goal for Dortmund for the first time this season but fellow German international and World Cup winner Mats Hummels is not yet ready. Klopp is again without Jakub Blaszczykowski, Nuri Sahin, Marcel Schmelzer and Ilkay Gundogan. Adrian Ramos and Sven Bender are doubtful for last season's runners-up. ""Two teams that can do better than they've shown until now will be playing against each other,"" said Klopp, who could be set to bring Manchester United midfielder Shinji Kagawa back to Dortmund. ""We want to give our opponents so many problems that it will take them another week to get back on track."" Last weekend Dortmund never recovered once Leverkusen's Karim Bellarabi scored the fastest goal in Bundesliga history after just nine seconds. Meanwhile, Augsburg conceded two goals in three minutes against Hoffenheim. Markus Weinzierl's team were also beaten by fourth division Magdeburg in the German Cup. The home team, who finished eighth last season, will not have fond memories of Friday's visitors. On the opening weekend last year, Pierre Emerick-Aubameyang scored a hat-trick as Dortmund won 4-0 in Augsburg. ""We should approach the game positively,"" Augsburg Sporting Director Stefan Reuter told Kicker. ""The stadium will be packed. I hope the fans can give the team the necessary momentum to get them back to winning ways."" Following their win over VfL Wolfsburg last Friday, defending champions Bayern Munich strengthened their squad to compensate for the long-term absence of injured Spanish international Javi Martinez. Centre back Mehdi Benatia joined on a five-year deal from Roma, while Bayern also hope to complete a move for Real Madrid midfielder Xabi Alonso. On Saturday evening, Pep Guardiola's side take on fellow Champions League qualifiers Schalke 04. Gelsenkirchen native and ex-Schalke goalkeeper Manuel Neuer will return to the Veltins Arena for the first time since helping Germany win the World Cup this summer. ""It's definitely a special game,"" he said. Neuer has been on the winning side and kept a clean sheet on the three previous occasions he has played there as a Bayern player. In total, Schalke have lost their last seven matches against Bayern. This season, Jens Keller's team have already been knocked out of the German Cup and last Saturday they lost 2-1 at Hanover in the Bundesliga. ""In this situation, you don't necessarily want them as your next opponent,"" Schalke midfielder Julian Draxler said of Bayern. ""But now we have to pull ourselves together and stop the negative trend. I'm convinced that we have the chance to do so against Bayern."" Midfielder Kevin-Prince Boateng, who has an ankle problem, is unlikely to start for Schalke. Striker Klaas-Jan Huntelaar is also doubtful. Also on Saturday, Bayer Leverkusen will look to continue their blistering start to the season when they host Hertha Berlin.

79,19/08/2014,02:05,Germany riding crest of wave as Bundesliga begins,The new Bundesliga season gets underway this weekend with German football riding the crest of a wave following the national team's triumph at the World Cup in Brazil last month.,"That thoroughly deserved victory, given to Joachim Loew's side by Mario Goetze's extra-time strike in the final against Argentina, saw a unified Germany crowned as world champions for the first time. But at club level, the Bundesliga has been leading the way for some time. It averaged 3.16 goals per game last season, considerably more than any of its major European counterparts, while average gates were over 42,000, making the German top flight the best attended league anywhere. ""In my opinion, the Bundesliga's the most attractive league in the world,"" Borussia Moenchengladbach coach Lucien Favre told bundesliga.com. ""The hype in Germany is amazing, and now they've won the World Cup so it's not going to tail off in a rush."" Nevertheless, the biggest problem facing the Bundesliga, as ever, is how to counter the dominance of Bayern Munich, who have romped to the title and added the German Cup in each of the last two campaigns. They have seen Toni Kroos and Mario Mandzukic depart and lost Javi Martinez to a serious knee injury in last week's SuperCup defeat to Borussia Dortmund, but the Bavarians remain favourites. And yet the rest can draw some hope from the very fact this is a Bundesliga season immediately following a World Cup, and that has not tended to help Bayern in the recent past. After Germany hosted the 2006 World Cup, Stuttgart went on to win the Bundesliga, while in 2011 Dortmund pipped Bayern to the title. In 2009, after Germany reached the Euro 2008 final, it was Wolfsburg who were champions. Six members of Pep Guardiola's squad played in the World Cup final, including Goetze, while Dante and Arjen Robben were also involved until the latter stages in Brazil. That is why chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge wanted the start of the new season delayed in order to give these players longer to prepare, but that request was unsurprisingly turned down by Bayern's rivals. ""We have to face the fact that the first half of the season will be difficult,"" said Guardiola, who at times had only a skeleton squad in pre-season training. ""We are at least one month behind schedule."" Guardiola has added to his squad with compatriots Juan Bernat from Valencia and Pepe Reina, who will provide competition in goal for Manuel Neuer. But the marquee signing was Robert Lewandowski, a prolific goalscorer for Dortmund in the last four years. However, Dortmund have moved to replace the Pole by signing Italy striker Ciro Immobile from Torino and Colombia's Adrian Ramos from Hertha Berlin. Stability is key at the Signal Iduna Park, where coach Jurgen Klopp, who led Dortmund to back-to-back titles in 2011 and 2012 and a Champions League final defeat to Bayern in 2013, is entering his seventh season in charge. ""We want to establish ourselves further at the top of the league and qualify directly for the Champions League,"" said sporting director Michael Zorc modestly. However, Guardiola knows where the danger lies, saying: ""We may have won the last two league titles, but they clinched the previous two. Our great challenge is to keep up our level to keep them at distance."" Beneath them, Schalke, Bayer Leverkusen and Wolfsburg will again be hoping to contend for Champions League qualification at least. Schalke have kept Klaas-Jan Huntelaar and Julian Draxler, while Sidney Sam has joined from Leverkusen, and few teams can boast a midfield as strong as Wolfsburg, with Kevin de Bruyne, Luiz Gustavo and France's Josuha Guilavogui. Bayer have signed Swiss striker Josip Drmic from Nuremberg and have a new coach in Roger Schmidt, back in his native country after winning the Austrian title with Salzburg. Hamburg will be hoping for a stable campaign after almost being relegated for the first time in their history last season. There are new coaches at Mainz, Eintracht Frankfurt and Stuttgart, who have reappointed Armin Veh, the architect of their 2007 title triumph, while Cologne are back among the elite and Paderborn are in the Bundesliga for the first time."

82,15/08/2013,12:04,Football: Augsburg sign Argentine bad-boy Bobadilla,Augsburg have brought bad-boy Argentinian striker Raul Bobadilla back to the Bundesliga on a three-year contract from Swiss champions FC Basel.,"The 26-year-old has already spent three years in Germany's top flight having made 59 appearances for Borussia Moenchengladbach, scoring eight goals between 2009 and January 2012. Bobadilla was under contract at Basel until 2017, but was suspended by the club in July after being stopped by police having driven his Maserati sports car at 111 kilometres per hour (69mph) through a village where the limit was 50kph (31mph). Basel signed the Argentinian from Swiss league rivals Young Boys in January while he was still completing a seven-match ban for insulting a referee after being shown a red card. Augsburg coach Mark Weinzierl said he hopes Bobadilla will strengthen their attack, which failed to score in last Saturday's 4-0 defeat at home to Champions League finalists Borussia Dortmund on the opening weekend of the Bundesliga season. ""I am grateful to FC Augsburg for giving giving me the chance to play in the Bundesliga again,"" Bobadilla said. As a replacement for Bobadilla, Basel are reported to be interested in signing Hoffenheim's Eren Derdiyok and Fulham's former Hamburg striker Mladen Petric."
