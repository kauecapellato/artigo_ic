0,31/01/2021,18:33,Suarez double at Cadiz sends Atletico 10 points clear,Luis Suarez sent Atletico Madrid 10 points clear at the top of La Liga on Sunday by scoring a sensational free-kick and then a penalty in a pulsating 4-2 win over Cadiz.,"Atletico's victory puts their lead at the top of the table into double figures and it could get even worse for the chasing pack, given Diego Simeone's side still have a game in hand. Real Madrid remain closest despite their defeat by Levante on Saturday while Barcelona are now 13 points back, although they could reduce the gap when they play at home to Athletic Bilbao later on Sunday. Both would have been given hope by a rousing display from newly-promoted Cadiz, who were inspired by the relentless Alvaro Negredo. The 35-year-old scored twice, could have had a hat-trick and certainly did not deserve to be on the losing side. But Suarez's double, between goals from Saul Niguez and Koke late on, sealed another three points for Atletico, who now have the La Liga crown within their grasp, even with half of the season left to play. Suarez was their driving force yet again, his two goals making it nine in his last eight games and 14 for the season. His goals and assists have now earned Atletico 12 extra points in the league, with Barcelona's decision to let him leave, and join title rivals, seeming more misjudged by the week. Atletico took the lead in the 35th minute after the marauding Joao Felix was brought down a few yards outside the penalty area. Suarez stepped up and sent a superb shot, curling into the left-hand corner. Cadiz rallied and then capitalised on some lethargic Atletico defending as Negredo was too strong for Thomas Lemar on the right of the area after Felipe had failed to cover. Negredo whipped a left-footed shot into the far corner of Jan Oblak's net. Atletico edged ahead again when Saul's touch from Lemar's cross looped, seemingly inadvertently, over Jeremias Ledesma and in before Cadiz had a penalty, Koke's hand touching the ball only for VAR to prompt the referee to rule it out. Cadiz's frustration was compounded by Atletico being awarded a penalty three minutes after half-time, Marcos Lopez clattering Lemar and Suarez making no mistake. Fali Jimenez almost pulled one back for Cadiz but his mishit cross dropped onto the crossbar and then Negredo did, his scuffed finish bobbling in with 20 minutes left after Atletico failed to clear. Negredo was on a mission. He rose high to meet Fali's cross but headed straight into the hands of Oblak and then nodded over for Saponjic, who looked certain to head in from five yards but Oblak was there again. All hope was extinguished in the 88th minute when Angel Correa, on as a substitute scuttled onto a loose ball and squared for Koke to tap in a fourth."
1,10/01/2021,19:09,Negredo leads Cadiz to victory over 10-man Alaves,Alvaro Negredo helped Cadiz register their first victory in five games on Sunday as they defeated 10-man Alaves 3-1.,"A red card for Alaves defender Alberto Rodriguez proved pivotal in the second half, with Antony Lozano and Negredo each scoring soon after to seal the win for Cadiz. Alaves had earlier pulled level through a Joselu penalty after Alex put Cadiz in front. The win ends a barren spell for Cadiz, who take one step closer to safety after being promoted last term. They climb to ninth while Alaves sit 14th. Earlier, Levante had also moved into the top half of the table by coming from behind to beat Eibar 2-1, Gonzalo Melero and Jose Luis Morales scoring the goals for them in the second half."
2,06/12/2020,00:17,Barca take 'gigantic step backwards' but Zidane gets breathing space,"Lionel Messi's Barcelona suffered a fourth Liga defeat of the season as they went down 2-1 to Cadiz on Saturday, while Real Madrid eased the pressure on Zinedine Zidane with their first league win since October.","Barca are now a distant seventh, 12 points off leaders Atletico Madrid, who beat Real Valladolid 2-0. ""It's a gigantic step backwards for our chances to fight for La Liga, you have to see it like that,"" the Catalans' coach Ronald Koeman said. ""A points difference of 12 points with a team as strong as Atletico is enormous,"" he added. Koeman made three changes from the midweek Champions League win at Ferencvaros with goalkeeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen coming in for Neto. But Ter Stegen made a first costly error in Andalusia after eight minutes as Alvaro Gimenez claimed his second goal in as many games. The Barca defence failed to clear a corner which fell to Ter Stegen, but his weak parry onto his own line was tapped in by Gimenez. Koeman's men were all-square after 56 minutes as Jordi Alba's low cross was deflected into his own goal by defender Pedro Alcala. But Ter Stegen's second costly error came eight minutes later. Clement Lenglet made a hash of Alba's throw in before Ter Stegen failed to clear under pressure from Negredo and the former Manchester City striker claimed his third goal league goal of the campaign. Under-pressure Zidane said Madrid's scrappy 1-0 victory in Seville was significant after a testing run of results. Sevilla goalkeeper Bono guided Vinicius Junior's effort into his own net in the second half, allowing Zidane's side to take the three points and move up to third in the table, six points behind Atletico. Following two defeats in the past three games, including a 2-0 defeat to Shakhtar Donetsk in midweek that leaves Real's Champions League qualification hopes in the balance, Spanish press reports have linked former Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino and ex-Madrid forward Raul to Zidane's job. Zidane said he was satisfied with the points after a ""difficult"" time. ""These are three very important points for us. It's a well-deserved win, against a very good opponent, who can put you in trouble at any time. We got through this,"" he said. ""It has been a bit difficult lately, today we have to enjoy it, be happy, but nothing more."" Atletico, now unbeaten in 26 games in La Liga, moved to the top of the table after France international Thomas Lemar and Spain midfielder Marcos Llorente scored for Diego Simeone's men against Valladolid. Atletico are among five clubs to remain without a domestic defeat in Europe's main five leagues since the start of the season. Real Sociedad, who have lost just once in the league this term, could regain the lead if they beat Deportivo Alaves on Sunday."
3,17/10/2020,23:12,"Barcelona, Real Madrid both lose ahead of Clasico",Real Madrid and Barcelona will each head into the Clasico next weekend on the back of a defeat after La Liga's two title favourites were punished for slack performances on Saturday.,"Zinedine Zidane made four substitutions at half-time but could not spark a lethargic Madrid into life as his team fell 1-0 at home to newly-promoted Cadiz. Then two hours later on the opposite side of the city, Ronald Koeman tasted his first competitive loss as coach of Barcelona as they followed Madrid's example by being beaten 1-0 by Getafe at the Coliseum Alfonso Perez. Madrid's was perhaps the more concerning display, the reigning champions managing just two shots on target against Cadiz, who could have scored more after Anthony Lozano's early strike. But Barca were not much better, with Lionel Messi strangely quiet and the team failing to rebound after Jaime Mata's penalty gave Getafe the lead in the second half. For Madrid, there was an injury concern too as Sergio Ramos spent the second half in the stands with ice strapped around his left knee. Madrid said the injury was not serious but it puts in doubt Ramos' involvement in their first Champions League game against Shakhtar Donetsk on Wednesday, as well the Clasico three days later. ""Hopefully it's minor, said Zidane. ""Tomorrow we'll see what he has done."" A prolonged absence for Ramos would cap a deflating night for the champions, whose dreary display certainly hands an early boost to their title rivals. Even if Barcelona were unable to capitalise, Atletico Madrid had earlier beaten Celta Vigo 2-0, with Luis Suarez opening the scoring at Balaidos. ""There is no explanation,"" said Zidane. ""If they scored two or three goals in the first half, we couldn't have complained. There are no excuses."" This is Cadiz's first season in the top flight in 14 years and their first victory over Real Madrid in 29. Their reward is second place in the table, denied top spot by their opponents only due to goal difference. Isco, Luka Modric and Lucas Vazquez were the other three players to be hauled off by Zidane, who was reacting to a particularly poor display from his side in the first half. Eder Militao, Casemiro, Fede Valverde and Marco Asensio came on while a surprised-looking Toni Kroos also departed in the second period, replaced by Luka Jovic. But Cadiz could have been three up in the first quarter of an hour as Ramos prevented Alvaro Negredo's finish from rolling in before Negredo created the opener. His cushioned header put through Lozano, who skipped beyond Madrid's sleepy defence and poked over the onrushing Thibaut Courtois. Madrid might have equalised in the second half as Vinicius Junior headed wide of an open goal and Karim Benzema rattled the crossbar with a long-range shot. But Cadiz were not overly troubled. Getafe were never really hanging on either, even if Barcelona went close to an equaliser, Messi hitting the post and then driving a loose ball wide in injury-time. Antoine Griezmann also ballooned over when put through in the first half. Getafe's Cucho Hernandez also hit the bar after a clumsy challenge from Frenkie de Jong on Djene Dakonham gave Mata his chance. Earlier, Suarez partnered Diego Costa for the first time and scored as Atletico Madrid beat struggling Celta Vigo. But the Suarez-Costa combination came to an early end as Costa was forced off injured in the second half. ""I liked the mix of the two,"" said Diego Simeone. ""Their characteristics mean they can play together. They give us strength and presence and personality in the penalty area. It's one of the options the team has."" Sitting in the stands, Costa was seen with his face in his hands and he seems likely now to miss Atletico's Champions League opener at Bayern Munich on Wednesday. Suarez had earlier finished off a sweeping move down the left before Yannick Carrasco made sure of the victory in injury-time, heading in after Joao Felix's effort came back off the crossbar. There was also a debut for Lucas Torreira, the Uruguayan signed on loan from Arsenal, who was energetic and tidy in central midfield, despite feeling some cramp late on. Atletico climb to fourth, two points behind Real Madrid and one ahead of Barcelona. Celta, meanwhile, have managed only one win from their first six games and sit 13th."
