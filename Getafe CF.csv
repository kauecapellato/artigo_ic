0,06/01/2021,12:38,Barca youngster Alena joins Getafe on loan,"Barcelona midfielder Carles Alena has joined Getafe on loan until the end of the season, the clubs announced on Wednesday.","Getafe, who have dropped to 16th in La Liga, will pay all of Alena's wages as the 23-year-old looks to kickstart his career away from Camp Nou. ""FC Barcelona and Getafe CF have reached an agreement for the loan of the player Carles Alena until the end of the 2020/21 season,"" Barca said in a statement. Alena has long been circled as a potential star of the future after coming through at Barca's La Masia youth academy but he has been unable to establish himself in the first team. He failed to make much of an impression during a loan spell at Real Betis last season and has made only five appearances for Barca this term under new coach Ronald Koeman. The Spaniard scored on his debut in the Copa del Rey in November 2016. ""Alena is a player for the future that has to play,"" said Koeman on Tuesday. ""He has decided to look for an exit."""
1,30/12/2020,21:32,Suarez ensures Atletico top La Liga,Luis Suarez made sure that Atletico Madrid will end 2020 top of La Liga after scoring the only goal in a 1-0 win over Getafe on Wednesday.,"Suarez struck in the 20th minute with a superb header from Yannick Carrasco's cross to take Diego Simeone's side three points ahead of Real Madrid, who are in action at lowly Elche later on Wednesday. Real Sociedad, Sevilla and Villarreal are all a further six points back, with Barcelona 10 points behind Atletico in sixth after their 1-1 draw with Eibar on Tuesday. Even if Madrid win in the late kick-off they will stay behind Atletico thanks to their significantly inferior goal difference, which currently separates teams locked on the same points. Atletico will have also played two fewer matches than their local rivals come the end of the day's fixtures after a win emblematic of Simeone's reign on his 500th match as coach of the club. Thomas Lemar almost opened the scoring in the 15th minute when he crashed a shot off the near post from a tight angle. Suarez gave the hosts the lead with a beautifully placed header that was all the more impressive for the way Carrasco's cross was flashed into a crowded area from midfield. The Uruguayan's eighth goal of the season was a good as it got for Atletico, who despite a fielding a full-strength line-up did not impress in a match of little incident at the Wanda Metropolitano. They failed to take the game by the scruff of the neck against a Getafe team that have scored just 12 times in 15 matches and are 14th, two points above the relegation zone. However Atletico's third win in a row ensures they remain top of the pile after a fraught last few days in which Diego Costa was allowed to leave and Kieran Trippier was banned until the end of February for betting breaches. Earlier Granada moved to within two points of the Champions League places after beating Valencia 2-1 in a fiesty match where three players were sent off in six second-half minutes. Jorge Molina's powerful header two minutes from time keeps Granada in seventh place on 24 points, two behind fourth-placed Sevilla. Granada, who levelled through Kenedy on the stroke of half-time after Kevin Gameiro had opened for Valencia in the 36th minute, are also one point away from Barcelona. Valencia's seventh league defeat of the season leaves them level on 15 points with Real Valladolid, who are third-from-bottom in the relegation zone and earned a point at Cadiz on Tuesday. Javi Gracia's side haven't won a La Liga match in their last seven attempts and had their task made harder when Jason and Goncalo Guedes were sent off within three minutes of each other midway through the second half. Granada's Domingos Duarte was then shown a straight red card three minutes later after he cynically hacked down Manu Vallejo as he attempted to burst through on goal with the scores still level. Molina punished the beleaguered away side by thumping home Alberto Soro's cross."
2,28/12/2020,16:03,Real resume Atletico chase as Messi absent for Barca,Real Madrid will attempt to sign off the year with a sixth win on the bounce as Zinedine Zidane's in-form side continue their pursuit of La Liga leaders and city rivals Atletico Madrid on Wednesday.,"Defending champions Real are level on 32 points with Atletico but have played two games more than Diego Simeone's men ahead of their trip to Elche. Karim Benzema has been the driving force behind Real's excellent December run, claiming key goals in wins over Athletic Bilbao, Eibar and Granada after securing the club a spot in the Champions League knockout phase. Eden Hazard is also in line to feature after recovering from his latest injury setback. The Belgian was an unused substitute in last week's victory over Granada and has made just three league starts this campaign. Real coach Zinedine Zidane hopes the short festive break afforded to his players over Christmas will not interrupt the momentum built over a domestic five-game winning streak. ""We're going to keep working hard. We have an awful lot of games, we should be pleased with what we're doing,"" said Zidane. ""We're going to lose games again, but we're going to try to win as many as possible. From time to time it's inevitable."" Atletico have responded well to the 2-0 defeat by Real earlier this month that snapped their 26-match unbeaten league run. However, the loss of Kieran Trippier is a substantial blow to a defence that has conceded just five goals in 13 matches, easily the fewest in the division. The England defender, an ever-present for Atletico in La Liga and Europe this term, was recently hit with a 10-week ban for breaching betting rules and will be unavailable until March. The club is said to be considering an appeal. Diego Costa has reportedly asked to terminate his contract for family reasons, having just returned from a blood clot that sidelined the Brazil-born Spain international for a month. Joao Felix is expected to return after missing the 2-0 win at Real Sociedad, although the Portuguese star hasn't scored in the league since November 7. Barcelona will bid to end a turbulent 2020 on a winning note at home to Eibar, but Ronald Koeman's side will be without Lionel Messi after the Argentine was granted an extended break as he recovers from an ankle knock. The six-time Ballon d'Or winner admitted his aborted departure in the summer had affected him at the start of the season, but stressed he felt ""excited"" to play under Koeman. ""Barca is my life, I'm in love with the club. And the city, my children were born here,"" Messi said in an interview with Spanish TV channel La Sexta broadcast on Sunday. ""I feel good right now, ready to fight for everything."" The Celta Vigo forward, the leading Spanish scorer in La Liga three of the past four years, has inspired a turnaround at Balaidos after the team won just one of their first 10 matches. The 33-year-old Aspas, who in November became the club's all-time leading scorer in the top flight, has netted eight times in 15 appearances this term and led Celta back into the top half following four wins in five games before Christmas. Much like with Real and Benzema, who is level at the top of the scoring charts with Aspas, Celta's success in 2021 could heavily rely on the former Liverpool attacker. 500 - Diego Simeone will take charge of his 500th match as Atletico boss against Getafe on Wednesday. He has won 300 games since his appointment in December 2011. 35 - Lionel Messi has been involved in more La Liga goals than any other player this year. The Argentine has scored 19 times and provided 16 assists. 9 - the number of games without a win for Real Sociedad across all competitions. Two weeks ago the Basques held top spot, but three successive defeats have dropped Imanol Alguacil's side six points off the pace."
3,17/10/2020,23:12,"Barcelona, Real Madrid both lose ahead of Clasico",Real Madrid and Barcelona will each head into the Clasico next weekend on the back of a defeat after La Liga's two title favourites were punished for slack performances on Saturday.,"Zinedine Zidane made four substitutions at half-time but could not spark a lethargic Madrid into life as his team fell 1-0 at home to newly-promoted Cadiz. Then two hours later on the opposite side of the city, Ronald Koeman tasted his first competitive loss as coach of Barcelona as they followed Madrid's example by being beaten 1-0 by Getafe at the Coliseum Alfonso Perez. Madrid's was perhaps the more concerning display, the reigning champions managing just two shots on target against Cadiz, who could have scored more after Anthony Lozano's early strike. But Barca were not much better, with Lionel Messi strangely quiet and the team failing to rebound after Jaime Mata's penalty gave Getafe the lead in the second half. For Madrid, there was an injury concern too as Sergio Ramos spent the second half in the stands with ice strapped around his left knee. Madrid said the injury was not serious but it puts in doubt Ramos' involvement in their first Champions League game against Shakhtar Donetsk on Wednesday, as well the Clasico three days later. ""Hopefully it's minor, said Zidane. ""Tomorrow we'll see what he has done."" A prolonged absence for Ramos would cap a deflating night for the champions, whose dreary display certainly hands an early boost to their title rivals. Even if Barcelona were unable to capitalise, Atletico Madrid had earlier beaten Celta Vigo 2-0, with Luis Suarez opening the scoring at Balaidos. ""There is no explanation,"" said Zidane. ""If they scored two or three goals in the first half, we couldn't have complained. There are no excuses."" This is Cadiz's first season in the top flight in 14 years and their first victory over Real Madrid in 29. Their reward is second place in the table, denied top spot by their opponents only due to goal difference. Isco, Luka Modric and Lucas Vazquez were the other three players to be hauled off by Zidane, who was reacting to a particularly poor display from his side in the first half. Eder Militao, Casemiro, Fede Valverde and Marco Asensio came on while a surprised-looking Toni Kroos also departed in the second period, replaced by Luka Jovic. But Cadiz could have been three up in the first quarter of an hour as Ramos prevented Alvaro Negredo's finish from rolling in before Negredo created the opener. His cushioned header put through Lozano, who skipped beyond Madrid's sleepy defence and poked over the onrushing Thibaut Courtois. Madrid might have equalised in the second half as Vinicius Junior headed wide of an open goal and Karim Benzema rattled the crossbar with a long-range shot. But Cadiz were not overly troubled. Getafe were never really hanging on either, even if Barcelona went close to an equaliser, Messi hitting the post and then driving a loose ball wide in injury-time. Antoine Griezmann also ballooned over when put through in the first half. Getafe's Cucho Hernandez also hit the bar after a clumsy challenge from Frenkie de Jong on Djene Dakonham gave Mata his chance. Earlier, Suarez partnered Diego Costa for the first time and scored as Atletico Madrid beat struggling Celta Vigo. But the Suarez-Costa combination came to an early end as Costa was forced off injured in the second half. ""I liked the mix of the two,"" said Diego Simeone. ""Their characteristics mean they can play together. They give us strength and presence and personality in the penalty area. It's one of the options the team has."" Sitting in the stands, Costa was seen with his face in his hands and he seems likely now to miss Atletico's Champions League opener at Bayern Munich on Wednesday. Suarez had earlier finished off a sweeping move down the left before Yannick Carrasco made sure of the victory in injury-time, heading in after Joao Felix's effort came back off the crossbar. There was also a debut for Lucas Torreira, the Uruguayan signed on loan from Arsenal, who was energetic and tidy in central midfield, despite feeling some cramp late on. Atletico climb to fourth, two points behind Real Madrid and one ahead of Barcelona. Celta, meanwhile, have managed only one win from their first six games and sit 13th."
4,21/09/2020,15:00,"African players in Europe: Mane, Zaha two-goal stars",Senegalese Sadio Mane and Ivorian international Wilfried Zaha were two-goal stars for Liverpool and Crystal Palace respectively in the English Premier League at the weekend.,"Mane punished 10-man Chelsea by scoring twice within four minutes soon after half-time to give defending champions Liverpool a 2-0 victory at Stamford Bridge. Zaha converted a penalty and scored again to assure Palace of a shock 3-1 triumph at Old Trafford over Manchester United, his former club. SADIO MANE (Liverpool) The Senegal forward tormented Chelsea as he triggered Andreas Christensen's red card and then scored twice in the champions' win. With a tight clash goalless heading into first half stoppage-time, Mane raced onto Jordan Henderson's pass and was pulled down by Christensen, who was initially booked before the decision was changed to a red card. Mane made sure Liverpool took advantage of their numerical superiority with a 50th-minute header from Roberto Firmino's cross. He followed his first goal of the season with his second four minutes later, this one a gift as he seized a wayward pass from Chelsea goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga and slotted into the empty net. WILFRIED ZAHA (Crystal Palace) The Ivory Coast forward returned to haunt Manchester United as his double fired Palace to a shock win. Zaha had a difficult spell with United between 2013 and 2015 before rejoining Palace, where he is fulfilling his vast potential. The 27-year-old showed why Palace are so keen to keep him out of the clutches of a host of admiring clubs as he calmly converted a 74th-minute penalty and then killed off United with a fine finish five minutes from full-time. SAMUEL CHUKWUEZE (Villarreal) The young Nigerian midfielder provided an assist to help Villarreal come from behind and beat Eibar 2-1 in La Liga. A fine cross from Chukwueze midway through the second half enabled Gerard Moreno to equalise. DAKONAM DJENE/ALLAN NYOM (Getafe) Togolese centre-back Djene and Cameroon midfielder Nyom played the full 90 minutes for Getafe in a 1-0 home win over Osasuna in their first outing of the season. Jaime Mata scored the only goal nine minutes into the second half. VICTOR OSIMHEN (Napoli) Nigerian international Osimhen came off the bench after an hour for his Napoli debut to trigger the two goals in a 2-0 win over Parma. Three minutes after his introduction, the 21-year-old was involved in the opener from Dries Mertens, with Lorenzo Insigne adding a second a quarter of an hour later. ""Osimhen has an extra gear,"" said coach Gennaro Gattuso of the player Napoli paid Lille a club record 80 million euros ($94.6 mn) for. ""He's a serious lad who does not forget where he comes from. He lost his parents as a child... he is a young man with the head of a 40-year-old."" MEHDI BOURABIA (Sassuolo) Morocco international midfielder Bourabia came on after 62 minutes and equalised three minutes from time with his free-kick salvaging a point for hosts Sassuolo in a 1-1 draw against Cagliari. It was a rare league goal for the 29-year-old, who now has three in as many seasons with the club. CEBIO SOUKOU (Arminia Bielefeld) The Bochum-born winger, who debuted for Benin last year, gave promoted Bielefeld a shock lead at Eintracht Frankfurt in a 1-1 draw. The 27-year-old sprinted to the ball in the area and lifted his shot over Germany goalkeeper Kevin Trapp with an hour gone. SILAS WAMANGITUKA (VfB Stuttgart) The 20-year-old Democratic Republic of Congo forward netted Stuttgart's second goal, but their late fightback was not enough to avoid a 3-2 home loss to Freiburg on their return to the Bundesliga. Wamangituka fired into the bottom corner on 81 minutes. RAMY BENSEBAINI (Borussia Moenchengladbach) The Algeria defender clipped the ankle of 17-year-old United States junior international Giovanni Reyna to concede a penalty in Moenchengladbach's 3-0 loss at Borussia Dortmund. Erling Braut Haaland converted the penalty. AMADOU HAIDARA (RB Leipzig) The Mali international scored Leipzig's third goal in a 3-1 home win over Mainz, sweeping the ball home from point-blank range just three minutes after the visitors had halved a two-goal deficit. The Haidara goal was the decisive final act in a swashbuckling attacking performance from Leipzig. ANDY DELORT (Montpellier) Algeria forward Delort scored just before half-time and again on the hour mark as Montpellier trounced visiting Angers 4-1 to lie third in Ligue 1, one point behind Saint-Etienne and Rennes. IBRAHIMA NIANE (Metz) Metz ended a run of three losses since the season kicked off by winning 2-1 at home to Reims thanks to a brace from Senegalese Ibrahima Niane. He opened the scoring on 18 minutes and snatched the winner with two minutes of regular time remaining."
5,05/08/2020,23:03,"United, Inter reach Europa League last eight",Manchester United edged LASK 2-1 and Inter Milan beat Getafe 2-0 on Wednesday in rescheduled ties due to the coronavirus pandemic to clinch places in the quarter finals of the Europa League.,"United had a 5-0 lead from their first leg played in March and will face Copenhagen who enjoyed a 3-0 victory on the night over Istanbul Basaksehir. Antonio Conte's Inter Milan will face either Steven Gerrard's Rangers or Bayer Leverkusen with the Germans holding a 3-1 lead going into Thursday's match. Despite United's comfortable lead from March 12's first leg the visitors caused problems early on. Andres Andrade hit the crossbar with a powerful header after 10 minutes at an almost empty Old Trafford before Peter Michorl fired wide just after the quarter of an hour mark. The Linz-based outfit had to wait until the second half to break the deadlock as defender Philipp Wiesinger rifled into the top corner from outside the box after 55 minutes. Their celebrations were shortlived as Jesse Lingard equalised on the counter attack for United three minutes later. Anthony Martial claimed the match-winner with two minutes to go despite LASK goalkpeer Alexander Schlager getting a foot to the France striker's shot. Inter's meeting with the La Liga side was played over just one leg in Gelsenkirchen to save time ahead of next week's last eight to be held in Germany. They advanced to the next round as Romelu Lukaku became the club's first player to score in five straight European appearances since Brazilian striker Adriano in 2004. Lukaku slotted home after Alessandro Bastoni's long ball after 33 minutes. The Spaniards were given a chance to take the game to penalties with 25 minutes remaining as VAR said Diego Godin had handballed in his own box but veteran cente-forward Jorge Molina missed the resulting penalty. Christian Eriksen made sure of Inter's spot after 84 minutes with his first touch after Dakonam Djene made a mess of a clearance inside his own area. Elsewhere, 2009 champions Shakhtar Donetsk booked a last eight spot against Basel or Eintracht Frankfurt after three goals within the closing four minutes clinched a 3-0 win over Wolfsburg. On Thursday Rangers head to Leverkusen, Wolves host Olympiakos, and Sevilla face Roma in Duisburg."
6,30/06/2020,00:13,Jaime Mata double revives Getafe Champions League bid,Jaime Mata scored twice as Getafe beat fellow European hopefuls Real Sociedad 2-1 on Monday to give their push for Champions League qualification from La Liga a boost.,"Getafe had seen their top-four bid hit by a four-game winless run since the league restarted following the coronavirus pandemic, but they moved back to within two points of fourth-placed Sevilla. Sociedad, who were in the Champions League places before the COVID-19 lockdown, have picked up just one point from a possible 15 since and are now seven points adrift in seventh. Sevilla's 1-1 draw with Real Valladolid on Friday had given Getafe a chance of narrowing the gap, and they took a 20th-minute lead through Mata's penalty. Former Manchester United winger Adnan Januzaj levelled for visitors Sociedad 10 minutes after the break with his third league goal of the season. But Mata had the final word with seven minutes remaining as he latched onto Jorge Molina's quick throw-in and poked a low finish into the net from the tightest of angles to send Getafe back into fifth. Sixth-placed Villarreal remain in the Champions League hunt though, just one point further back."
7,20/06/2020,22:10,Getafe stumble again in race for top four,Getafe's hopes of finishing in La Liga's top four took another knock on Saturday as their disappointing return from the three-month suspension continued with a 1-1 draw at home to Eibar.,"Peter Etebo's smart finish put Getafe in front at the Coliseum Alfonso Perez before Eibar's Charles equalised from close range on the stroke of half-time. Eibar might even have snatched victory, only to have a late goal from Pedro Bigas ruled out for offside. Getafe have now taken just two points from three games since the restart, with Atletico Madrid primed to take advantage when they host struggling Real Valladolid later on Saturday. Victory for Atletico would send them four points ahead of Getafe and five clear of Real Sociedad, who have also lost momentum and face Real Madrid on Sunday. ""It's clear we needed to win to give us a boost,"" said Getafe's Jaime Mata. ""It would have kickstarted us after the break but we have to keep fighting until we get that win. People say our ambitions are too high but we are going to keep fighting."" Getafe are punching above their weight towards the top of the table, having enjoyed a remarkable four years under coach Jose Bordalas. They were only promoted to the top tier in 2017 and missed out on Champions League qualification on the final day last year, edged out by Valencia. But their challenge may not extend so far this term given this draw followed a stalemate at home to struggling Espanyol and defeat by newly-promoted Granada. It contributes to a more prolonged dip in form that has included only two wins in nine. Eibar are without a victory themselves in five matches but this was a valuable point that gives them something to build on in their battle to avoid relegation. They sit 16th, three points above the bottom three. With their coach Jose Luis Mendilibar serving a touchline ban, Eibar fell behind after half an hour when Marc Cucurella's deep cross was volleyed back in by Angel Rodriguez and Etebo steered the ball first time into the corner. But Eibar responded and when Getafe's defence failed to push out together after a botched Eibar free-kick, Bigas was left free to nod across to Charles, who had a simple finish. Neither team really deserved to win it in the second half but Eibar thought they had when Pape Diop's cross grazed the top of Bigas' head and bounced in. But Bigas had strayed just offside and Eibar had to settle for a point. Earlier, Espanyol were beaten 3-1 at home by Levante, a blow to their morale after they resumed with an impressive win over Alaves and hard-fought draw against Getafe. Espanyol stay bottom, three points adrift of safety. Athletic Bilbao climbed to ninth after Inigo Martinez's flicked finish was enough to beat Real Betis 1-0. Betis' Sergio Canales missed an 85th-minute penalty in the defeat, which leaves coach Rubi on the brink of the sack."
8,16/06/2020,22:23,Getafe's Champions League charge falters with Espanyol stalemate,Getafe dropped more points in the race for Champions League qualification on Tuesday after they failed to break down struggling Espanyol despite their opponents playing most of the 0-0 draw with 10 men.,"The stalemate represents a missed opportunity for Jose Bordalas' side and they could even have lost to Espanyol, who are building momentum after returning from the three-month suspension due to the coronavirus pandemic. Getafe stay fifth, level on points with fourth-placed Real Sociedad, who will play their game in hand away at Alaves on Thursday. Getafe could also be overtaken if Atletico Madrid win on Wednesday against Osasuna. Espanyol move to within two points of safety and after resuming with a 2-0 victory over Alaves on Saturday, their point against a top-four hopeful will be welcome. They will particularly satisfied given their defender Bernardo Espinosa was sent off in the 16th minute for throwing his hand into the face of Damian Suarez. Espanyol coach Abelardo Fernandez hurled a bottle down in frustration but his team rallied and were never really made to feel uncomfortable by Getafe, who managed only four shots on target. Their best chance came in stoppage time but Espanyol's goalkeeper Diego Lopez made an excellent double save, denying Angel Rodriguez's header and then the follow-up from Marc Cucurella. Getafe have now won just once in their last six games. ""You have to say it is a slip-up,"" said Getafe goalkeeper David Soria afterwards. ""We were with an extra player for a long time and perhaps a little bit of anxiety creeps in when you have an extra man. You rush your chances and maybe that played a part. It's true, we're not on a good run."" Elsewhere, Villarreal stayed in the hunt for the European places by beating Real Mallorca 1-0. Carlos Bacca's early finish leaves Villarreal seventh, three points from fourth. Mallorca remain 18th."
9,13/06/2020,00:19,Valencia and Getafe stumble in La Liga race for top four,Ten-man Levante scored a 98th-minute penalty on Friday to snatch a 1-1 draw against Valencia as La Liga completed its second day of fixtures since its return from the coronavirus suspension.,"It was a miserable night for the league's top-four hopefuls as Granada also came from behind to beat Getafe 2-1, meaning Atletico Madrid and Real Sociedad have the chance to capitalise on Sunday. Valencia looked to have grabbed a later winner themselves at an empty Mestalla when Rodrigo Moreno diverted in at the near post in the 89th minute. But Mouctar Diakhaby pulled down Ruben Vezo deep into injury-time and Gonzalo Melero made no mistake, equalising for Levante from the spot. The visitors also had Roger Marti sent off for a second yellow card in the 74th minute. Granada, also playing behind closed doors at Los Carmenes, scored in the 70th and 79th minutes as a Djene Dakonam own-goal and Carlos Fernandez's finish wiped out Getafe's lead, given to them in the first half by David Timor. Defeat means Getafe stay fifth, handing Atletico the chance to overtake them if they can win away at Athletic Bilbao on Sunday. Valencia remain seventh, three points of adrift of Real Sociedad, who are at home on Sunday to Osasuna. Granada, who were only promoted last season, move up to eighth, with the Europa League places now in sight while Levante edge up to 12th. La Liga became the second of Europe's five major leagues after the German Bundesliga to resume on Thursday, when Sevilla overcame Real Betis 2-0 in the division's first match since March 10. League leaders Barcelona play away at Real Mallorca on Saturday before Real Madrid, two points behind in second, return at home to Eibar on Sunday."

Villarreal also released a statement on behalf of the club and players on Friday ""to show their absolute rejection of the accusations"". Getafe missed out on Champions League qualification after drawing 2-2 against Villarreal, which meant fourth place went to Valencia, who beat Real Valladolid 2-0.

It added: ""Likewise, Villarreal CF will study and assess the possibility of taking legal action in this situation."" Molina's Getafe teammate Jaime Mata posted a message on Twitter, together with a picture of Molina, that said: ""The truth is incontrovertible.

Getafe might still have been feeling the effects of their superb 2-0 win over Ajax on Thursday in the Europa League as Jose Bordalas' side lacked the defensive discipline that has thrust them into the mix again for a Champions League spot. Sevilla, meanwhile, were arguably the favourites to finish fourth at the start of the season and former Spain coach Julen Lopetegui will have been relieved to return to winning ways, just as the pressure on him was beginning to mount. This was only their second victory in La Liga since the start of the year. Ocampos scored Sevilla's opener two minutes before half-time, teed up by Sergio Reguilon after Getafe's Djene Dakonam slipped. Getafe pushed for an equaliser but were undone by two goals in eight minutes shortly after the hour as Fernando Reges bundled in Luuk de Jong's smart header to the back post before David Soria failed to prevent Jules Kounde's shot creeping inside the far post."
15,19/02/2020,02:30,Five ties to watch in the Europa League this week,"The Europa League knockout phase begins on Thursday, with VAR being introduced to Europe's secondary club competition for the first time outwith the final for the last 32, first-leg ties. AFP Sport picks five games to watch this week:","Manchester United's Champions League aspirations have been given a major boost in recent days, first with the news of Manchester City's two-year ban from the competition. Then, on Monday, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's side beat Chelsea 2-0 away to close to within three points of their opponents in fourth place in the Premier League. Now they revert their focus to the Europa League, which could also offer them a ticket to next season's Champions League if they reach the final in Gdansk in May and lift the trophy. United head to Belgium to take on Club Brugge in the first leg of their tie. Beaten by Liverpool in two European finals in the 1970s, Club Brugge are not a side to be taken lightly. They dropped out of the Champions League group stage despite holding Real Madrid away, and are nine points clear atop the Belgian league. Arsenal are unbeaten in their last eight games under Mikel Arteta, although the Gunners' new Spanish boss could do with turning some of his team's many draws into more victories. Currently in mid-table in the Premier League, last season's beaten finalists travel to face Olympiakos knowing this competition is surely their best bet if they are to return to the Champions League next term. ""They may not have started well in the Premier League this season, but they have great players, are dangerous and deserve our respect,"" said Pedro Martins, the coach of Olympiakos. The Greek league leaders dropped out of the Champions League group stage despite holding Tottenham Hotspur to a 2-2 draw in Piraeus. After enchanting Europe on their run to the Champions League semi-finals last year, Ajax were brought crashing back to earth when they were eliminated from this season's competition in the group stage. The Dutch champions were then handed a tough Europa League draw against a Getafe side who have been one of the stories of the season in Spain. The unfashionable outfit from the working-class satellite town just south of Madrid finished fifth in La Liga last season and are currently third under Jose Bordalas, whose his idol as a youngster was Johan Cruyff. ""They are warriors. They fight for every ball and really give everything,"" Ajax star Dusan Tadic told Dutch daily Algemeen Dagblad. ""They are physically very strong and go beyond the limits if necessary."" It is Getafe's first European knockout tie since they took Bayern Munich to extra time in the UEFA Cup quarter-finals in 2008. Erling Braut Haaland's eight goals were not enough for Salzburg to qualify from the Champions League group stage, and the Austrians have since lost their striker to Borussia Dortmund. Japanese winger Takumi Minamino also departed for Liverpool, leaving them looking seriously weakened for the second half of the season. Salzburg did sign Swiss starlet Noah Okafor, but their first league game after a long winter break ended in a 3-2 home defeat by title rivals LASK Linz last weekend. Now Salzburg face Eintracht Frankfurt, meaning a reunion with Adi Huetter, who coached Salzburg to a league and cup double in 2015. Celtic have been eliminated at this stage in the last two seasons but should fancy their chances against FC Copenhagen as they head to Denmark. While Celtic have claimed nine straight wins this calendar year, Copenhagen's first league game of 2020 ended in defeat last weekend. Current Celtic manager Neil Lennon was a player when the Glasgow giants lost 3-1 on their last trip to Copenhagen in the Champions League in 2006. His team qualified by topping their group, and of this tie he said: ""It's great to have European football after Christmas, and it's a tough draw. It could have been tougher, but it could have been easier."""
16,13/02/2020,17:02,Hazard returns for Real as Barcelona struggle to keep their sparkle,"Real Madrid could welcome back their priciest Galactico this weekend at home against Celta Vigo, while Barcelona must adjust to life without yet another of the most expensive members of their squad as they entertain Getafe.","Eden Hazard cost Real 100 million euros ($108.4 million) last summer, eclipsing the initial fee paid for Gareth Bale. So far, Real have not got much for the money they paid Chelsea. The Belgian started the season with a hamstring problem, then broke a bone in his foot against Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions League in late November. He has not played since. He is expected to be on the bench against Celta. The Galicians climbed out of the relegation places last Saturday with a home win over Sevilla. But Celta's victory was their only win in six games while Real, on a run of five straight wins, are the hottest team in league. For Hazard, and for Real, Celta are not the target, nor are mid-table Levante who they face next Saturday. The date ringed on their calendars will be February 26 when they face Manchester City in the first leg of their Champions League last-16 tie. After a difficult autumn, Zinedine Zidane has his team purring and the endless questions over Bale's role are a sideshow he can ignore. The other team in what is turning into a traditional Spanish two-horse race are looking less comfortable. Barcelona were top as recently January 25. Now they trail Real by three points. They also face a traditional also-ran at home this weekend. But Getafe are the surprise of the Spanish season and have won four straight matches to climb to third and can cut the gap to second to four points with a first league victory away to Barcelona. ""Everything is possible,"" said Getafe defender Allan Nyom. Last week, against Real Betis, Lionel Messi assisted all three goals, setting up midfielders Frenkie de Jong and Sergio Busquets and defender Clement Lenglet. ""When he doesn't score he gives assists,"" said Nyom. Of the players Barcelona have bought to provide creativity and goals alongside Messi, only Antoine Griezmann, who started on Sunday is available. Philippe Coutinho is on loan to Bayern Munich, Luis Suarez is recovering from a knee injury and the club confirmed this week that Ousmane Dembele is out for the season. Lenglet will be missing too. Seven minutes after scoring his second league goal of the season he was sent off. He also picked up a red when Barcelona won at Getafe in a bad-tempered match in September. While Barcelona and Real have another week to prepare for their return to the Champions League, Atletico Madrid host Liverpool next Tuesday and Valencia play Atalanta in Milan on Wednesday. Conveniently they were scheduled to meet this weekend in Valencia and La Liga has brought the game forward to Friday. Their Champions League opponents are both playing league matches on Saturday. If they want to return to the competition next year, Friday's meeting could prove crucial. Atletico are clinging onto the fourth Champions League place only on goal difference from Sevilla while Valencia are just two points back in seventh. Barcelona are making noises about asking for an exemption to buy a striker because of their injury problems. Real Sociedad's Willian Jose, a 28-year-old Brazilian who has gone from journeyman to must-have striker in the last month, and Moron, a 26-year-old who has only established himself in the Betis team in the last 18 months, are reportedly top of the list. They can improve their value by adding to their modest eight league goals each this season on Sunday. Willian's Real Sociedad make the short trip to Eibar and Betis visit Leganes. 14: Lionel Messi is the top scorer in La Liga 11: Lionel Messi is the top assist provider in La Liga 75: Yellow cards Getafe have accumulated, most in La Liga. They collected four against Barcelona in September, but Barcelona edged them with four yellows and a red"
17,09/02/2020,00:09,"Atletico get timely victory, Getafe make top-four statement","Atletico Madrid won for the first time in four games on Saturday thanks to a 1-0 win over Granada that moved them into fourth place in La Liga, as Getafe continued their surprising charge towards Champions League football.","Argentinian forward Angel Correa scored Atletico's only goal in the sixth minute at the Wanda Metropolitano, netting for the fifth time in nine matches. Atletico had goalkeeper Jan Oblak to thank for preserving the three points with a superb save from Roberto Soldado's crafty second-half backheel. Diego Simeone's side could be overtaken on Sunday by Sevilla, who visit Celta Vigo, but the coach welcomed the return to form for a side who must face holders Liverpool in the last 16 of the Champions League later this month. ""We needed to win. Our stadium's support was extraordinary, we needed that energy,"" Simeone said. Getafe took another step towards Champions League qualification as Jorge Molina scored twice in a sensational 3-0 win over fellow top-four contenders Valencia. The 37-year-old Molina capped a storming performance with two goals in the second half before Jaime Mata added a third with three minutes left, after Valencia's Alessandro Florenzi had been sent off. Getafe stay third, three points ahead of Atletico and Sevilla. Up next for Jose Bordalas' side is a trip to Barcelona next weekend but on this evidence, it will be the stumbling Catalans feeling nervous ahead of that game. Getafe face La Liga's defending champions on the back of four consecutive victories, in which they have scored nine goals and conceded none. They bullied Valencia from start to finish, faster to the ball and hungrier in the tackles with all three goals coming from Getafe's players reacting quicker than their opponents. ""It was all shit, in defence and in attack,"" said Valencia's Gabriel Paulista. ""We have to change today's attitude. They have been more like men."" After Barca, they will play Ajax in the Europa League. Valencia, meanwhile, have won only four out of nine games since the turn of the year, with their own Champions League last 16 tie against Atalanta fast approaching. Getafe had to wait until 13 minutes into the second for Molina's opener. He slid the ball to Mata and then beat two Valencia defenders to the rebound from Jaume Domenech's save. Dani Parejo was at fault for the second as he gave the ball away in midfield and one pass set Molina free. He had three defenders to beat but somehow bundled through, a final pirouette making space for a smart finish. Florenzi was sent off with 12 minutes left for a frustrated spear tackle from behind on Marc Cucurella before Mata made it three. Villarreal were held to a 1-1 draw by Real Valladolid as well-travelled French forward Hartem Ben Arfa made his debut as a second-half substitute."
18,04/01/2020,18:34,Ruthless Real Madrid dismantle gutsy Getafe,Real Madrid made an impressive start to the year as they picked apart a robust Getafe side to win 3-0 in La Liga on Saturday.,"Raphael Varane was the instigator of two goals at the Coliseum Alfonso Perez, first pressuring Getafe David Soria into a missed punch and an own-goal before himself heading home a cross from Toni Kroos. Luka Modric then added a third deep into injury-time after a brilliant first-time pass by Gareth Bale had set Madrid away on the counter-attack. Victory sends Zinedine Zidane's side top of the table briefly at least, one point above Barcelona, who play later on Saturday against Catalan rivals Espanyol. Getafe remain seventh and very much in the race for Champions League qualification. Another excellent season under coach Jose Bordalas is proving last year's remarkable top-four challenge was far from a fluke. But their usually stubborn defence was overly-generous as Soria's mistake and then a free header put Madrid in charge before Modric complete what was, in the end, a comfortable win. Without either Sergio Ramos, who was suspended, or Eden Hazard, who continues to nurse an ankle injury, this looked an awkward fixture for Zidane's team on the back of a two-week winter break. Instead, they keep the pressure on Barcelona before travelling to Saudi Arabia next week, where they could be set for a Clasico final in the Spanish Super Cup, with Valencia up first on Wednesday in the last four. Hazard will stay at home after Zidane confirmed on Friday the Belgian will not return until later this month at the earliest. His worryingly extended absence has offered a reprieve for Isco, who started again, and Bale, who twice should have scored in the second half, only to tee up Modric via substitute Fede Valverde. At the other end, Thibaut Courtois appears finally to be finding his best form after a rocky start since his summer move from Chelsea. Courtois made three strong saves before Varane's second gave Madrid breathing space. Getafe's success under Bordalas has been built upon tenacity as well as discipline and hard work, with right-back Allan Nyom particularly eager to make his presence felt on Bale early on. Yet one late challenge too many earned Nyom a yellow card and Madrid a dangerous free-kick that led to the opener shortly after the half-hour mark. Kroos' cross was put back in by Ferland Mendy on the opposite side and while Soria sprung out to punch, he failed to connect and only succeeded in sending the ball bobbling into his own net. Karim Benzema tested Soria at his near post but Courtois was the busier of the two keepers. He palmed away a stinging volley from Mauro Arambarri, pushed out a drive from Faycal Fajr and then blocked a close-range header from Leandro Cabrera. Getafe's frustration was compounded eight minutes into the second half when an unmarked Varane nodded in Kroos' whipped cross and the home side never looked like being revived thereafter. Bale tried to chip Soria and then go round him but made amends for his misses in injury-time. Mendy twisted free before feeding Bale, who curled the ball beautifully, first time and on the turn, into the path of the sprinting Valverde. He could have scored himself but instead set up Modric, who finished into an open net."
19,02/01/2020,19:08,Barca and Real continue title tussle ahead of Super Cup,Barcelona and Real Madrid recommence their war of attrition on Saturday as Spanish league action returns briefly before the pair controversially head off to Saudi Arabia for next weekend's Super Cup.,"League leaders and defending champions Barcelona have an easy trip to cross town rivals Espanyol, who are floundering at the bottom of the table. However Espanyol hired former Barca player Abelardo Fernandez in the hope of turning their fortunes around after losing to second-bottom Leganes just before the Christmas break. Ernesto Valverde's Barca are unbeaten in all competitions since the start of November and sit two points ahead of Real Madrid despite some below-par performances. Madrid meanwhile return to action off the back of three straight draws before the break, including a goalless stalemate in the politically charged 'Clasico' in December. They have a trickier task than Barca too, with another derby against a Getafe side showing that their fifth-placed finish last year was no fluke. Coach Zinedine will be without the injured Eden Hazard for the clash, captain Sergio Ramos is suspended, although James Rodríguez, Brazilian Marcelo and Lucas Vázquez are all available. Both Barca and Real may switch up their line-ups given their controversial voyage to Saudi Arabia to contest the Super Cup, alongside Atletico Madrid and Valencia, from January 8. The decision in November hold a four-team tournament in Saudi Arabia in the European winter for the next three years has caused a storm in Spain. Spain's public broadcaster RTVE refused to bid for the rights to the match due to it being held in a country where ""human rights are not respected"". Barca will face Atletico and Valencia will play Real before the final on January 12, a radical revamp to what has traditionally been a the season's curtain raiser between the league champions and Copa del Rey winners. The tournament's scheduling means that La Liga will take another break while the Super Cup is being played, with league action restarting on January 17. Atletico will go to the tournament looking over their shoulder in the league. Diego Simeone's side were wildly inconsistent before the winter break, and have found goals hard to come by despite spending 126 million euros ($142 million) on Joao Felix in the summer. Fourth-placed Atleti have score just 20 times in 18 matches and have Getafe, Real Sociedad, Valencia and Athletic Bilbao all snapping at their heels for the final spot in the Champions League.

20,28/09/2019,23:12,Real hold off Atletico in tight derby to grab top spot in Spain,Real Madrid regained top spot in La Liga on Saturday after a goalless derby with Atletico that saw them move above surprise package Granada and maintain their small lead over a crowded chasing pack.,"Real will stay top by a point over promoted Granada and Atletico Madrid after Diego Simeone's side failed to break down their well-drilled local rivals, whose disciplined performance at the Wanda Metropolitano was deserving of at least the point they gained. They are a further point ahead of fourth-placed Barcelona, who won a hard-fought clash at Getafe 2-0 thanks to goals from Luis Suarez and Junior, and Real Sociedad who travel to a Sevilla side down in eight but just five points behind Zidane's leaders. On a night of few clear-cut chances Atletico probably had the best opportunities but failed to test Thibaut Courtois in the Real goal, while the away side drew a couple of fine saves from Jan Oblak on their forays forward. The best came 15 minutes from the end, when the Slovenian stopper got down brilliantly to his left to palm away Karim Benzema's powerful header from a Nacho cross. Just seconds before Atletico had come to within inches of opening the scoring when Saul Niguez met a corner with a header that flashed just past the upright. Granada had moved temporarily top of La Liga before the derby after Antonio Puertas' first-half strike saw them squeeze past rock-bottom Leganes. Puertas crashed his long-range winner into an empty net after Juan Soriano had come charging out of his goal to close down Roberto Soldado just before the half-hour mark. A remarkable counter-attack goal launched by Marc-Andre Ter Stegen and finished off by Luis Suarez put Barcelona on their way four minutes before the break at Getafe, and Junior's tap-in shortly after the restart made sure of Barca's first away win since April. ""This match was crucial for us to rid ourselves of the sensation of never being able to win away,"" said Valverde. ""We didn't play well in the first half but once we took the lead they basically didn't have any chances."" Ter Stegen is embroiled in a row with Bayern Munich captain Manuel Neuer over the Barca stopper's lack of opportunities with the Germany team. However he showed his class when he raced out of his goal to stop a Getafe attack before launching a pin-point pass over the home side's dozing defence to Suarez, who calmly lobbed the opener over David Soria. ""Sometimes when passes come off like this the goalkeeper is just clearing the ball. I don't know if that is the case here, but regardless he brings us a lot,"" added Valverde. The win was Barca's second in a week as they attempt to recover from an miserable start that led to questions surrounding Valverde's future. Athletic Bilbao lost for the first time this season at home to crisis club Valencia, who bagged their second win of the season thanks to Denis Cheryshev's 27th minute strike. 'Los Che' had been sent into turmoil when owner Peter Lim sacked Marcelino Garcia Toral earlier in the month. But despite player and fan anger at Lim's decision, two draws and now a win after their shock victory at Chelsea in the Champions League have them in ninth on nine points."

22,19/08/2019,00:15,Trippier and Morata combine to give Atletico winning start,Alvaro Morata headed in a sumptuous Kieran Trippier cross to ensure a new-look Atletico Madrid beat Getafe 1-0 on Sunday and made a winning start in La Liga.,"Trippier looked right at home at the Wanda Metropolitano when his bending ball was nodded in by Morata before two red cards in four minutes, one for each team, made it 10 against 10 before half-time. Getafe striker Jorge Molina and Atletico left-back Renan Lodi were the players sent off and then Morata missed a penalty, earned after a mesmeric run from Joao Felix, Atletico's 126 million euro signing from Benfica. It was enough for Felix to depart to a standing ovation and Atletico held on, even if this was perhaps not the statement opening to the season that Diego Simeone might have hoped for. After losing Antoine Griezmann to Barcelona, Atletico have spent close to 250 million euros this summer, just over half of that on Felix, whose electric run lit up an otherwise rather disjointed contest. The 19-year-old is supposed to be the heartbeat not only of a new team but a different style too, one that is more attractive to watch and that could even pip Barcelona and Real Madrid to the title. But Getafe were stubborn opponents, showing again why they finished fifth last season, only narrowly missing out on a place in the Champions League to Valencia on the final day. Felix aside, Atletico's other debutants impressed, including Lodi, before he was sent off, and Trippier, the first Englishman to play for Atletico since the Spanish Civil War and 20th in the history of the Spanish top flight. The former Tottenham defender's pin-point cross was the highlight of a confident performance that earned regular praise from the home fans. The early signs were encouraging as Trippier and Lodi pushed high and wide, like wingers, and the former almost played Koke in with a superb first-time pass. Felix showed some nice touches and his team-mates were quick to protest on his behalf after Leandro Cabrera barged him over. Trippier was the team's best outlet and Atletico might have scored had he managed to pick out either Felix or Morata in the middle after a brilliant pass from Saul Niguez. He had another chance moments later though and this time Trippier was more precise. A bending cross from the right allowed Morata to head in and Trippier enjoyed the celebrations, rousing the crowd on his way back and accepting a huge roar in return. Getafe had struggled to find a way into the match but two red cards in four minutes threatened to shift the balance. First, referee Cuadra Fernandez turned a yellow card into a red for Molina after consulting VAR, the striker catching Thomas Partey late down the back of his heel. Then Lodi was handed a second yellow for planting his hand in the face of Damian Suarez. Atletico dropped Saul into left back before Felix was sacrificed later in the second half, Mario Hermoso coming on for his debut where Lodi had started. But not before Felix produced the most exhiliarating moment of the match, for which an otherwise rather muted debut will be remembered. Collecting the ball in his own half, he slid past one Getafe opponent, nutmegged another and then weaved through two more. After motoring 30 yards, he was finally brought down by Bruno for a penalty, the fans cheering as if they had seen a goal. It should have been worth one but Morata's shot was pushed wide by David Soria and Getafe remained in touch. Getafe kept it close and Morata should have made it two when sent through in injury-time. One was enough."
23,18/05/2019,20:31,"Valencia hold on to fourth, Griezmann jeered on last Atleti appearance",Valencia held their nerve to secure La Liga's last Champions League place on Saturday as a 2-0 victory over Real Valladolid ended the hopes of Getafe and Sevilla of snatching fourth.,"Getafe had to better Valencia's result at the Estadio Jose Zorrilla as they faced Villarreal, while Sevilla needed to beat Athletic Bilbao and hope both Getafe and Valencia lost. Sevilla did their part by seeing off Bilbao 2-0 while Getafe drew 2-2 but Valencia ensured those results did not matter and reached the Champions League for a second consecutive year. ""It has been an outstanding season,"" said Valencia coach Marcelino. ""We have had a lot of problems but we stayed calm. To get back into the Champions League again is a great achievement."" Valencia sit seven points behind Real Madrid, who play Real Betis at home on Sunday, and are 15 adrift of second-placed Atletico, who drew 2-2 away at Levante, with Antoine Griezmann jeered in his final match for the club. Valencia's Champions League chances looked slim when a miserable start to the season left them 15th after 15 games, with a scrap for survival more likely than a dash for the top four. They did reach the Europa League semifinals but defeat to Arsenal two weeks ago close that route to the Champions League. Their season could have a final flourish if they beat a drained Barcelona and win the Copa del Rey on May 25. ""It's one goal achieved after a difficult season,"" said captain Dani Parejo. ""But there is still one more to do."" After 11 weeks in the top four, fifth place and the Europa League might come as a disappointment for Getafe, even for a team promoted to the top flight only two seasons ago and whose annual wage bill is less than one tenth of Real Madrid's. ""We don't feel sorry for ourselves, not at all,"" said Getafe coach Jose Bordalas. ""At the start of the season, we would definitely have signed for this."" Sevilla qualify for the Europa League too, finishing sixth after Ben Yedder and Munir El Haddadi extinguished Bilbao's own hopes of European football next season. Instead, Sevilla are joined by Espanyol, whose fans invaded the pitch when the full-time whistle blew at Cornella, where a 2-0 win over Real Sociedad means the Catalan side clinched seventh. Getafe sat fourth for 23 minutes on Saturday, after Francisco Portillo pulled an early shot into the corner, but news soon filtered through that Valencia had scored against Valladolid, Carlos Soler capitalising on a mistake by Kiko Olivas. From there, everything went Valencia's way as Rodrigo gave them a two-goal cushion, shortly after Villarreal's Vicente Iborra had nodded in an equaliser against Getafe. A brilliant header from Nemanja Maksimovic looked to have given Getafe a winning finish but Gerard Moreno's angled shot bobbled its way in after some clumsy handling by David Soria. Earlier, Griezmann was barracked by fans during his last game for Atletico and Rodrigo might have scored his final goal for the club as they came back from two goals down to draw with Levante. Griezmann was whistled at the City of Valencia Stadium by visiting fans, who were also heard chanting ""out, out, out"" before goals from Sergio Camello and Rodrigo ensured Atletico ended the season with a point. ""We had to highlight the work of the gladiators who are leaving,"" Simeone said afterwards. ""Their greatest legacy is not the titles won, it is their commitment and respect. I love them very much."" Simeone has dismissed fears of a mass exodus, despite both Diego Godin and Griezmann already announcing their departures, with the likes of Rodrigo, Juanfran and Filipe Luis all expected to follow. If this was to be their farewell outing for Atletico, it was an underwhelming finale as impressive Levante could have been out of sight before they were eventually pegged back. Simeone's side finish runners up with 76 points. They come in above Real Madrid for a second consecutive year but will end up 13 points behind Barcelona, if the Catalans win away at Eibar on Sunday."
24,17/05/2019,02:15,Valencia seek perfect end to remarkable recovery in La Liga,Valencia lost to Arsenal in the Europa League semi-finals but hold pole position for La Liga's last Champions League spot as the race for the top four reaches its climax on Saturday.,"Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang's hat-trick ended Valencia's hopes of qualifying by lifting a trophy and their chances looked slim in the league too, when they trailed Getafe by three points ahead of the penultimate weekend. But a 3-1 win over Alaves, combined with Getafe losing away to a wounded Barcelona, means it is Valencia with their fate in their own hands, as they prepare to face Real Valladolid at Jose Zorrilla. A superior head-to-head over Getafe means they need only match the result of Jose Bordelas' side, who host a Villarreal team sitting 14th and with little left to play for. Yet Valladolid's position appears in Valencia's favour too. Victory away at Rayo Vallecano last weekend means their safety is already secured. Win, and Valencia will be guaranteed Champions League football in consecutive seasons for the first time in seven years, a feat that not too long ago seemed almost unthinkable. After five games, they were 15th and still to win. After 10, they were 14th, having won once and scored seven goals. After 15 games, they had won three but were back in 15th, ground to a halt by nine draws. When Marcelino was appointed in 2017, he was the club's 12th coach in five years and only one of them -- Nuno Espirito Santo -- had overseen enough matches to make even one full league season. Most waited for the trigger to click but Marcelino stayed and after 10 draws in 13 games, they won, coming from behind in the Copa del Rey to beat Segunda B side Ebro, who had a man sent off after 29 minutes. ""There was this click,"" said striker Kevin Gameiro in an interview with AFP this month. ""And there was also a bit of luck."" Defeats by Girona, Juventus and Real Madrid tempered hopes of a recovery but in between came three victories in a row and after, five games unbeaten, including a Champions League win over Manchester United. Eighth in the table at the start of the year, Valencia then surged through March and April, 10 wins thrusting them within sight of the top four. ""The word surrender does not exist in my vocabulary,"" said Marcelino. They stumbled again, twice, defeated last month by Atletico Madrid and Eibar, the resurgence almost evaporating in the space of four days. But their rivals wobbled too as Getafe lost their nerve and Sevilla faded, the bounce from bringing in Joaquin Caparros to replace Pablo Machin proving short-lived. Sevilla's decision to act has them lying sixth, needing to win at home to in-form Athletic Bilbao on Saturday and needing both Valencia and Getafe to lose. Valencia's decision to persevere may be about to pay off, a top-four finish the perfect boost ahead of the Copa del Rey final on May 25 against Barcelona, who will be without Luis Suarez and perhaps goalkeeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen. ""The spirit of the team has merged with the spirit of Valencia, which is always: never give up,"" said striker Rodrigo earlier this month. For Getafe, the Europa League would be a disappointment, even for a team who were promoted to the top flight only two years ago and whose annual wage bill is more than ten times less than Real Madrid, the club they hope to finish one place behind. ""Everything can still happen,"" said Bordalas. Getafe have a chance, which is perhaps more than can be said for Girona, whose players and coach Eusebio Sacristan conceded their loss at home to Levante last weekend had been decisive in the fight against relegation. ""All that's left is to say sorry,"" said an emotional Eusebio afterwards. ""I was convinced I could do it but I failed."" They are 18th, needing to make up three points and a six-goal deficit in goal difference to overtake Celta Vigo on the final day. Celta have the added advantage of hosting already-relegated Rayo Vallecano while Girona play at Alaves. Barcelona's title-winning campaign will end away at Eibar on Sunday just as Real Madrid's miserable season finishes at home to Real Betis."
25,11/05/2019,23:11,Valverde feels Barcelona support despite Champions League collapse,Barcelona coach Ernesto Valverde has said he feels supported by club president Josep Bartomeu and compared the reaction to their Champions League exit to a child having a tantrum.,"Barca crashed out in the semi-finals on Tuesday after one of the greatest comebacks in the tournament's history saw them lose 4-0 to Liverpool and throw away a 3-0 advantage from the first leg. The defeat has left Valverde's future in doubt but, ahead of their penultimate La Liga game of the season at home to Getafe on Sunday, he insists he wants to continue. ""I'm not thinking about it, not at all,"" Valverde said in a press conference on Saturday. ""I have the strength to continue, I'm fine, I'm like everyone else, what we want to do is take a step forward and face the situation, not hide under a stone. ""I've talked to the president and I've always felt supported by the club. ""I know that when there's a blow of this kind, everything becomes disjointed. It's as if you have to burn everything, like when our children have a tantrum, but you have to rebuild."" Barcelona have already been crowned La Liga champions and could make it a domestic double by beating Valencia in the final of the Copa del Rey later this month. But even two trophies would not make amends for the collapse against Liverpool, given the Champions League was the one the club really craved this season. ""We are hurt, I'm not going to deny it,"" Valverde said. ""But we have time to recover for ourselves and also with our fans. We're have to be honest with ourselves. We can lose against Liverpool, they have proved to be a great team. ""The problem it's how we lost, especially in the second half when we did not play well. It was painful because we lost from a very favourable situation. But there is no other way than to look forward."" Barcelona will be without Luis Suarez against Getafe after the Uruguayan had surgery on a knee injury on Thursday night. Suarez is expected to be out for four to six weeks. Ousmane Dembele, Arthur Melo and Rafinha are also injured. Valverde's side are nine points clear at the top of La Liga with two games left while Getafe are chasing Champions League qualification. They sit fourth, three points ahead of Valencia and Sevilla."
26,26/04/2019,07:25,Struggling Madrid held to goalless draw,Real Madrid's dreary end to the season took another turn for the worse on Thursday as they were left holding on for a goalless draw away to Champions League chasers Getafe.,"Just 48 hours before Barcelona are set to be celebrating a 26th La Liga title at Camp Nou, Madrid drifted to a stalemate that leaves them 15 points behind the soon-to-be champions and, on this evidence, with significant ground to make up. It says something that Getafe were, in the end, disappointed not to win here, Sevilla's 5-0 thrashing of Rayo Vallecano before kick-off meaning they stay fourth, only by virtue of a superior head-to-head. Real Madrid were mathematically ruled out of the title race after Barcelona beat Alaves on Tuesday while Atletico Madrid look likely to finish above them too for a second consecutive year. Zinedine Zidane has insisted La Liga will be the club's ""bread and butter"" next season, their priority ahead of the Champions League after seven years with only one league title to their name. But they have work to do, with very few of his squad showing many reasons to keep them this summer and several more looking like they could well be replaced. ""The shame today is we deserved more,"" Zidane said. ""We created chances, in the first half especially. I am not happy with the result, but with the way we played, our concentration, I am happy."" Getafe still have a lot to play for. If they snatch a Champions League spot, it would be one of the greatest shocks La Liga has seen in years, perhaps even trumping Atletico Madrid winning the title in 2014. Their average attendance here is just under 10,000 while the club's wage bill stands at a little less than 40 million euros. Madrid's is close to 570 million. Karim Benzema skewed wide of the far post with 62 seconds on the clock and Madrid hardly created a better chance for the rest of the half. Gareth Bale started and was greeted by silence rather than the whistles that have accompanied him at the Santiago Bernabeu in recent weeks. But he looked low on confidence, a shadow of the player he can be. Bale pulled back for Benzema, who could only find the hands of David Soria on the slide while Casemiro had an instinctive effort blocked from six yards. But Getafe were largely untroubled even if they lacked creativity, their best opening coming from a free-kick which Mauro Arambarri caught well but Keylor Navas was equal to. For 10 minutes, Madrid peppered the Getafe goal after the break. Soria came out quickly to deny Bale, pushed a Casemiro shot around the post and then saved from Isco, who should have scored after Dani Carvajal picked him out. Bale and Brahim Diaz departed, replaced by Marco Asensio and Lucas Vazquez, but it was Navas that was called upon next, making two quick-fire saves to keep out Jorge Molina and Jaime Mata. Mata wanted a penalty for a Carvajal push as Getafe looked more likely to find a late winner. It was not to be. Getafe's Champions League dream hangs in the balance."
27,31/08/2015,23:58,Celtic flop Scepovic joins Getafe on loan,"La Liga side Getafe have signed Serbian striker Stefan Scepovic on loan from Celtic, both clubs confirmed on Monday.","""Scepovic has joined Spanish side, Getafe, on a season-long loan,"" Celtic said in a statement on their website. The 25-year-old moved to Celtic at the end of August last year and has made 26 appearances for the club, scoring six goals. He has also been capped eight times by Serbia. ""Everyone at Celtic sends Stefan their best wishes, and hope that he and Getafe have a successful season."" Getafe sit second from bottom of the La Liga table after losing their first two games of the season to Espanyol and Granada respectively."
28,28/04/2015,22:36,"Messi, Suarez, Neymar hit century mark in Barca rout","Barcelona's star front three of Lionel Messi, Luis Suarez and Neymar brought up a century of goals in all competitions as the Catalans moved five points clear at the top of La Liga with a 6-0 humbling of Getafe on Tuesday.","All three were on target inside 28 minutes as Messi opened the scoring from the penalty spot before teeing up Suarez to volley home and Neymar was left with the simple task of registering the 100th goal between the trio from Suarez's pass. Xavi Hernandez then curled home a stunning fourth before Suarez made it 5-0 with a similar finish into the far corner and Messi rounded off the scoring in typical style on his favoured left foot early in the second-half. Real Madrid can close the gap at the top back to two points when they host Almeria on Wednesday. ""Luckily the first shots on goal we had went in, the team played very well in the first-half and that is the most important thing,"" said Suarez. ""I don't know if there is a key to our success. There is total commitment among the team and the fans. We are obliged to win important things and we are entering the most important stage of the season."" Barca boss Luis Enrique had resisted the temptation to rest any of his front three despite making four changes from the side that won 2-0 at Espanyol on Saturday with one eye on next week's Champions League semi-final, first-leg against Bayern Munich. That decision was richly rewarded in a stunning first-half display that tore the helpless visitors to shreds. Messi put his recent yips from the penalty spot behind him as he opened the scoring by chipping the ball straight down the middle of the goal in the style made famous by Czech legend Antonin Panenka in the 1976 European Championships after Suarez had been felled by Alvaro Arroyo. Getafe nearly drew level moments later when Claudio Bravo made a brilliant recovery save to claw Fredy Hinestroza's lob to safety to make up for his original poor positioning. Suarez put the result beyond doubt with a sumptuous volley from Messi's inviting cross and the Uruguayan then turned provider for Neymar to bring up the century. Moments later Xavi scored what could well be his final goal at the Camp Nou with the veteran expected to move to Qatar at the end of the season by curling the ball high into the far corner. Xavi's flick then set up Suarez to finish in similar style to register his 21st goal of the season before the break. Despite the upcoming date with former coach Pep Guardiola and Bayern in eight days time there was little let up from the hosts after the break. However, the goals did dry up after Messi had curled home his 38th league goal of the campaign to move within one of Cristiano Ronaldo in the race to be La Liga's top goalscorer two minutes into the second period. The four-time World Player of the Year came close to a seventh hat-trick of the season six minutes from time, but Vicente Guaita made a fine save to turn his free-kick to safety."
29,08/02/2015,19:00,Sevilla slump to defeat at Getafe,Sevilla blew the chance to extend their advantage over Valencia in fourth as Pedro Leon's late winner handed Getafe a 2-1 victory on Sunday.,"The hosts went in front on the half hour mark when former Swansea City striker Alvaro Vazquez was brought down by Diogo Figueras inside the area and he picked himself up to dispatch the resulting penalty. Sevilla enjoyed the majority of possession after the break, but it took a wonder strike from Polish international Grzegorz Krychowiak to bring them level as he fired in his first La Liga goal from 20 yards. However, Getafe secured a vital three points in their battle to avoid the drop five minutes from time when Leon forced the ball home from close range after Sergio Rico had made a double save from Fredy Hinestroza and Diego Castro. A second defeat in four days for Sevilla means Valencia can move back into the top four should they avoid defeat away at Espanyol later on Sunday. Meanwhile, Barcelona can move to within a point of Real Madrid at the top with victory at Athletic Bilbao after the European champions were thrashed 4-0 by Atletico Madrid on Saturday."
30,05/01/2015,14:58,Getafe appoint Sanchez Flores as new coach,"Spaniard Quique Sanchez Flores, a former coach with Valencia and Atletico Madrid, has been appointed the new coach of struggling Liga side Getafe, the club confirmed on Monday.","Sanchez Flores, was in charge of the Madrid-based club when they first reached the top flight in 2005-05, before moving onto spells at Valencia, Benfica and Atletico, the latter of which he guided to glory in the 2010 Europa League. The 49-year-old arrives from Dubai outfit Al-Ain and succeeds Romania's Cosmin Contra who leaves the club in 14th place and just four points above the relegation zone."
31,13/12/2014,18:41,Barcelona slip up in Getafe stalemate,Barcelona's La Liga title hopes suffered a blow as they fell four points behind leaders Real Madrid after being held to a disappointing 0-0 draw at Getafe on Saturday.,"In a bitty first half at the Coliseum Alfonso Perez the visitors were indebted to goalkeeper Claudio Bravo, who kept his side on level terms with a top-drawer save from an Angel Lafita effort. Barca improved after the break and piled on the pressure, yet were unable to find a way past Vicente Guaita with Lionel Messi striking the bar from a free-kick and some resolute defending from the Getafe back line. ""The draw isn't a great result, but the side came into the game with a positive dynamic and we have to carry on that way. There's still a long way to go in the league, but admittedly it's a step backwards,"" said Barcelona captain Xavi Hernandez. ""It is a game we can normally get a result in, but we couldn't make the breakthrough. Defensively they were really strong, we had four chances and couldn't take any of them. ""We've got a lot of goals in attack, but today it just wouldn't go in for us."" In a match played out in unforgiving conditions, Barcelona desperately missed the attacking presence of Neymar, who was absent through an ankle injury, and notably lacked a cutting edge in the final third as they were frustrated by the home side's defence, who were able to limit the Blaugrana to few clear-cut chances. The Catalan outfit saw a couple of long-range efforts fly over from Luis Suarez and Ivan Rakitic, before Messi forced a block from Guaita in the home side's goal after combining well with the Croatia international as they sought to make the breakthrough. Guaita could then only punch a cross as far as Pedro Rodriguez on the edge of the box, but the Spain international's mishit effort was turned just wide by Suarez, who is still looking for his first Liga goal. Both sides then felt aggrieved not to be awarded a penalty within a minute of each other as firstly Juan Valera appeared to handle the ball while on the ground as Messi looked to dribble past him, before in the next attack Lafita's cross struck Dani Alves on the arm. Referee Inaki Vicandi Garrido was unmoved on both occasions. As the half wore on Getafe took the initiative, and the home side were unlucky to not go into the break leading after Lafita beat Alves and Pique on the edge of the box, only to see a rasping drive somehow tipped round the post by Claudio Bravo at full stretch. Barcelona came out for the second half with more attacking intent, and went close to opening the scoring after Messi, who had been brought down by Emiliano Velazquez on the edge of the box, saw a free-kick clatter the crossbar before Suarez fired wildly over from distance. Guaita then kept out another Messi effort as the pressure grew, with Xavi volleying just wide and Messi heading over when well positioned. However, despite the introduction of Andres Iniesta and Munir El Haddadi, they couldn't find the breakthrough as Getafe held on bravely for a point. On Friday, two late Cristiano Ronaldo goals helped Real Madrid make it 20 consecutive victories in all competitions as they saw off Almeria 4-1 at the Estadio de los Juegos Mediterraneos. First-half goals from Isco and Gareth Bale either side of Verza's stunning equaliser sent the visitors in ahead at half-time, but they needed a big save from captain Iker Casillas when he parried Verza's penalty on the hour mark. Ronaldo then sealed the win when he turned home crosses from Karim Benzema and Dani Carvajal to take his La Liga tally to 25 goals this season."
