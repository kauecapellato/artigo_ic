0,10/02/2021,21:33,Ex-France coach Domenech sacked by Nantes,Former France coach Raymond Domenech was sacked by Nantes on Wednesday after less than two months in charge with the club languishing in the Ligue 1 relegation play-off place.,"A club source said Domenech had been released although the club made no official statement. Former Nantes player Antoine Kombouare takes over, according to the club source, as the struggler look to break a run of 16 matches without a win in all competitions. Domenech had been in charge of seven of those games following his appointment in late December. News of his sacking emerged during Nantes' 4-2 defeat by Lens in the French Cup on Wednesday, a match Domenech was unable to attend as he was in isolation following a positive Covid-19 test on Monday. Nantes fans were never convinced by Domenech, who arrived in Brittany a decade after his rollercoaster reign as France coach ended in a player strike and early elimination at the 2010 World Cup in South Africa. The 69-year-old took charge of les Bleus in 2004, lost the 2006 World Cup final to Italy in an infamous match in which Zinedine Zidane headbutted Marco Materazzi, led his team to bottom of their group in Euro 2008 and then suffered humiliation two years later. The 2010 World Cup was a fiasco for France with temperamental striker Nicolas Anelka sent home and players refusing to train before the team was knocked out in the group stage. Before being hired by Nantes, Domenech had not managed a team since his sacking as national coach in September 2010. Domenech was greeted at his first Nantes training session in December by a band playing circus music with a 'ringmaster' taking aim at him and club owner Waldemar Kita. ""Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Kita Circus! The Kita Circus brings you some new amazing new acts,"" boomed a member of a supporters' club to a background of deafening music, saying Domenech would ""make us laugh"". The club sit 18th in Ligue 1, four points above the automatic relegation places. Kombouare, a former Paris Saint-Germain and Lens coach, left his last job at Toulouse in 2020 after a dreadful 10-match losing streak. cor-fcc/gvy/td/jc/iwd"
1,17/01/2021,23:44,Metz end Lyon's run as PSG take Ligue 1 lead,Lyon slumped to a shock 1-0 home defeat to Metz on Sunday that ended a long unbeaten run and allowed Paris Saint-Germain to stay top of Ligue 1.,"Rudi Garcia's side had come into Sunday's late match on the back of 16 league games without defeat, knowing that a win would have put them back in the lead of France's top flight. However Aaron Leya Iseka struck in the final minute to snatch the points for resilient Metz, who had to withstand a second-half onslaught before finally prevailing and moving ninth. ""We pushed, they pushed, and we were rewarded for our efforts. We knew that we would have little of the ball and that we would have to counter well, and that's what we did,"" said Belgian Leya Iseka. The loss leaves Lyon third, two points behind PSG and Lille, whose own late goal from Jonathan David secured a 2-1 win over Reims. Lyon should have taken the lead six minutes before the break when Karl Toko Ekambi was fed by Tintotenda Kadewere on a breakaway attack. Cameroonian Ekambi, who had forced a good save from Alexandre Oukidja three minutes earlier, successfully cut inside to fashion himself a shooting opportunity but could only blast over. Three minutes later Metz twice came close to taking a shock lead, first hitting the post following a Farid Boulaya cross before Marcelo charged back to block Lamine Gueye's shot on the line. With 16 minutes remaining Ekambi slammed home what he thought was the opener when the ball fell to him after fine play between Memphis Depay and Thiago Mendes. However after a long VAR review the goal was ruled out for Houssem Aouar straying offside when Mendes shot and then pressuring Metz defender Fabien Centonze, who had nodded the ball out to Ekambi. Islam Slimani had the perfect chance to win the match with seven minutes left of his Lyon debut but he shanked his shot, and Oukidja then did brilliant to keep out Aouar's close range effort after fine work from Memphis Depay. That allowed Leya Iseka to claim a shock win for Metz. Earlier David pounced in the first minute of stoppage for Lille to tap home after Xeka's powerful low drive was spilled by Reims goalkeeper Predrag Rajkovic to put Lille on 42 points, equal with champions PSG. Jonathan Bamba's long-range leveller two minutes after the break gave Lille a chance to snatch the win after Arber Zeneli had given Reims a 35th-minute lead with a cross that bamboozled home stopper Mike Maignan. Monaco are six points off the lead in fourth after Wissam Ben Yedder's brace gave them a 3-2 win over Montpellier on Friday. The Principality club are level on 36 points with fifth-placed Rennes, who earlier on Sunday fought back from going a goal down after just three minutes at Brest to win 2-1. Saint-Etienne are just four points above the relegation zone after a 1-0 defeat at Strasbourg. The 10-time French champions are 16th and winless in five league matches thanks in part to a missed 10th-minute penalty from Ryad Boudebouz. Ludovic Ajorque scored the winner for the team from Alsace just before the half-hour mark. Nantes are hovering above the drop zone after drawing 1-1 at home with Lens, with Gael Kakuta's 81st-minute leveller for the away side denying Raymond Domenech a first win in charge of the hosts. The former France coach has guided Nantes to three straight draws since his much-derided appointment last month, with his team battling a run of games without a win that stretches back to early November. Bordeaux strolled to a thumping 3-0 win at Nice, who are also without a win in five."
2,31/12/2020,16:45,"'Hope not to repeat mistakes': 10 years after World Cup fiasco, Domenech back in dugout","Raymond Domenech was unveiled as the new boss of struggling French Ligue 1 side Nantes on Thursday, 10 years after his rollercoaster reign as France coach ended in a player strike and World Cup humiliation.","""I'm happy, it's a real pleasure....maybe I understand your problems better, I hope not to repeat my mistakes"", he told journalists. The 68-year-old Domenech was in charge of Les Bleus from 2004 until the 2010 World Cup in South Africa. The tournament was an utter fiasco with temperamental striker Nicolas Anelka sent home, players striking in response before the team was knocked out in the first round. That was the last time Domenech coached a team. If that was an excruciating experience for the combative Domenech, the next six months will be just as testing with Nantes down in 16th place in the table, three points above the relegation trapdoor. ""The objective is to bring pleasure, to offer something coherent to this team,"" said Domenech who has not coached at top-flight club level since a five-year spell at Lyon from 1988-1993. ""Through what we are going to show on the field, I hope that we will bring everyone together. ""I'm not worried, I want things to go well on the pitch, we are moving forward, we are training, the players are strong in spirit, they are happy, with a lot of joy and desire."" The club's fans, however, may need convincing. When he arrived for training on Wednesday, he was greeted by a band playing circus music with a 'ringmaster' taking aim at him and club owner Waldemar Kita. Players were compared to goats. ""Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Kita Circus! The Kita Circus brings you some new amazing new acts,"" boomed a member of the 'Brigade Loire' supporters' club to a background of deafening music. ""Raymond Domenech will explain to us his vision of football, what will make us laugh on the upcoming weekends."" Domenech insisted Thursday that he was unperturbed by the hostility. ""At all clubs there are problems. There are worries everywhere. If everything was rosy, you'd have nothing more to write,"" he told reporters. ""I don't know anyone at this club who does not want it to work, everyone wants it to work."" Domenech's first match in charge will be on January 6 at home against Breton rivals Rennes."
3,30/12/2020,13:57,Ex-France coach Domenech gets a clown's welcome at Nantes,"Raymond Domenech's first training session at Ligue 1 club Nantes Wednesday was marred by a band of supporters playing circus music with a 'ringmaster' taking aim at the former France coach and club owner Waldemar Kita, and comparing players to goats.","An onlooking Domenech, who has signed a six-month contract with Nantes for his first job since the fiasco at the 2010 World Cup, had taken a back seat to allow club trainer Cyril Moine to put the players through their paces. But the peaceful atmosphere soon changed, with Domenech, who last coached a club side in 1993 and left his role as les Bleus boss after finishing bottom of the group and suffering a player revolt in South Africa, the clear target. ""Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Kita Circus! The Kita Circus brings you some new amazing new acts,"" boomed a member of the 'Brigade Loire' supporters' club to a background of deafening circus music. ""Raymond Domenech will explain to us his vision of football, what will make us laugh on the upcoming weekends."" Domenech and Kita aside, the players were also targeted. ""And finally the Kita Circus brings you its traditional animal act. Eleven goats will be dispersed on a green rectangle and will have to pass a ball. ""Exclusively at the Kita Circus, a show that has lasted 13 years, for the young and the old,"" the 'ringmaster' said in reference to the arrival of Kita as club president in 2007. The criticism did not sit well with the players, Abdoulaye Toure having to be held back by his teammates. Flanked by two bodyguards, Kita himself attended the end of the training session to talk with the players in front of a complete turnout of backroom staff."
4,08/12/2020,11:56,Ligue 1 club Nantes fire coach Gourcuff,"French first division side Nantes have fired their coach Christian Gourcuff after a run of poor results, the Atlantic coast club said on Tuesday.","The final straw was the 4-0 defeat to struggling Strasbourg at the weekend. Nantes stand 14th on 13 points, just three clear of the relegation zone. Gourcuff, a 65-year-old journeyman, was the 14th incumbent in as many years at the passionately supported club who last won the French title in 2001."
5,31/10/2020,23:22,Mbappe on target as PSG win without injured Neymar,"Kylian Mbappe scored from the penalty spot as Paris Saint-Germain eased to their seventh straight Ligue 1 win on Saturday, beating Nantes 3-0 away to move provisionally three points clear at the top of the table.","All the goals came in the second half at the Stade de la Beaujoire, with Ander Herrera opening the scoring two minutes after the restart and Mbappe converting a 65th-minute spot-kick before Pablo Sarabia secured the points late on. PSG have now taken maximum points since starting the season with back-to-back defeats and the reigning champions are three clear of Lille and Rennes at the summit. Lille, who are unbeaten, can rejoin the club from the capital at the top if they win at home to Lyon on Sunday. Rennes beat Brest 2-1 earlier on Saturday. Paris coach Thomas Tuchel made six changes to his line-up following the 2-0 midweek win at Istanbul Basaksehir in the Champions League, with Neymar one of those missing after suffering an adductor injury that is expected to keep him out until the upcoming international break. However Nantes, whose game at Lens last weekend was called off following a coronavirus outbreak in their opponents' squad, were missing an entire back four here, including three to Covid-19. Sarabia hit the post early on for the visitors in this game, which was played behind closed doors after France returned to a full national lockdown in an attempt to stem a surge in coronavirus cases. Nigerian winger Moses Simon then missed an open goal for Nantes, somehow failing to turn in a Randal Kolo Muani assist. Kolo Muani then curled a shot agonisingly wide after a Herrera slip had let Nantes in, and PSG lost Moise Kean -- scorer of four goals in the previous two games -- to injury at the break. Nevertheless the league leaders got the breakthrough at the start of the second half when Mbappe picked out the former Manchester United midfielder Herrera to fire home. Mbappe, who moved from the left wing to a more central role in the second half, then benefited from a very soft penalty award when he went down under pressure from Jean-Charles Castelletto. The World Cup winner stroked home the penalty for his seventh league goal of the season, all of which have come in the last six matches. He was then withdrawn and headed straight down the tunnel clutching his right hamstring, giving Tuchel potentially another injury headache ahead of Wednesday's key Champions League clash with RB Leipzig in Germany. Just before he went off, Nantes won a penalty of their own when Colin Dagba fouled Marcus Coco in the box, but Abdoul Kader Bamba's effort from 12 yards was saved by Keylor Navas. PSG have conceded just one goal in their seven-game winning run, while Sarabia chipped in after pouncing on Imran Louza's back-pass to make it 23 goals scored in that time. Earlier Rennes got back on track by coming from behind to beat Brest 2-1 as they prepare to go to Chelsea in the Champions League in midweek. Defensive duo Damien Da Silva and Nayef Aguerd got the goals for Rennes after Franck Honorat had given the visitors the lead at Roazhon Park in a Brittany derby. A third-place finish in the last, curtailed French season allowed Rennes to qualify for the Champions League for the first time, but they have taken just one point from their first two group games, a 1-1 draw at home to Russians Krasnodar being followed by a 1-0 loss away to Sevilla in midweek. They face Chelsea in London on Wednesday, a game which will be missed by teenage French international midfielder Eduardo Camavinga, who is injured and also played no part against Brest."
6,21/08/2020,21:25,Marseille confirm fifth COVID-19 case as Ligue 1 starts under virus cloud,"Marseille have found a fifth asymptomatic case of coronavirus in their squad, a club spokesperson told AFP on Friday, on the same day the new French Ligue 1 season kicked-off under an increasingly darkening COVID-19 cloud.","Andre Villas Boas' squad had been scheduled to open the French season later in the day at home to Saint-Etienne but the game was cancelled after the four earlier positive tests. The club have not revealed the names of the players but said they are in isolation at home. The rest of the Marseille squad were given the weekend off ahead of next Sunday's game at Brest. Hours later, Saint-Etienne said one of their players had also tested positive. Nantes' trip to Bordeaux was moved from Saturday to replace the season-opening fixture at the Velodrome. It proved little comfort as the game, the first in the competition in 166 days following the coronavirus lockdown and played behind closed doors, ended in a tame 0-0 draw. Nantes had a one-man advantage for more than an hour after a 20th-minute red card for Mehdi Zerkane. The Bordeaux player was punished after a VAR consultation for an ugly lunge into the leg of Nicolas Pallois. Earlier on Friday, Nice coach Patrick Vieira said he was concerned about the impact two coronavirus cases could have on his club. Nice said a pair of players had been held out of training and placed in quarantine after contracting the virus. ""I felt on the pitch the rest of the squad is worried. I am too, for the match against Lens on Sunday and for what happens next,"" Vieira told a press conference. ""It complicates the planning. We'll have to put up with it and be very responsible at home."" Newly-promoted Lens are awaiting the results of further tests after defender Jonathan Clauss returned a positive sample earlier in the week. ""I hope we will play. If we start by postponing the first weekend, we'll get nowhere,"" said Lens boss Franck Haise. ""I think we need to play as much as we can when it's possible otherwise we're going to finish the season in 2023."" Meanwhile, Nimes announced a fourth coronavirus case within their squad putting Sunday's fixture against Brest at risk. ""I hope we can play it, I think we can play it,"" the southern side's coach Jerome Arpinon said. According to a club source captain Anthony Briancon and striker Nolan Roux are among those to have tested positive for the illness. Brest also recorded a case, saying the individual had been placed in isolation while the rest of the squad and the coaching staff have tested negative. A 57-page medical and health protocol set up by the French league is designed to limit stoppages and reduce contamination as much as possible. Players will be tested two to three days before each match and a game will be postponed as soon as four cases are found at the same club within an eight-day period."
7,22/02/2020,22:23,'Not very good' Marseille lose unbeaten run after Nantes defeat,Andre Villas-Boas had few excuses for his Marseille team on Saturday after their 14-match unbeaten run in Ligue 1 came to an end with a surprise 3-1 home defeat by off-form Nantes.,"Marseille are second and have put themselves in a strong position to qualify for the Champions League next season thanks to their hot streak but were downed by goals either side of half-time by Anthony Limbombe and Abdoul Kader Bamba and a late Alvaro own goal at the Stade Velodrome. Morgan Sanson had given Marseille hope of continuing their run after levelling the scores with a lovely finish five minutes before the break, but Villas-Boas admitted his side deserved to lose after a weak display. ""We weren't very good today, we lost the ball a lot and struggled to build play,"" said the Portuguese coach. ""We had confidence that we could change the match when we equalised, but their second goal hit us hard."" Marseille are nine points clear of third-placed Lille, who won 3-0 against rock-bottom Toulouse -- who have now lost 14 of their last 15 matches -- to move third following a first-half brace from Loic Remy. However Rennes can retake third with a home win over Nimes on Sunday. The defeat for Marseille also means Paris Saint-Germain can move 13 points clear at the top if they beat Bordeaux at the Parc des Princes on Sunday. Nantes meanwhile climb to 10th after bagging their first win in six league matches and are level on 37 points with Lyon, Nice and Montpellier, who were beaten 1-0 by an Angers side that is now five points clear of the relegation zone. All four teams are in a multi-team race for European football with four points separating Nantes and Rennes, who are fourth and sit in the Europa League spot. Limbombe stunned the Velodrome when he stooped to head home Bamba's cross in the 35th minute in what was the game's first shot on target, but the hosts reacted positively to going a goal down and were level shortly after. First Nantes goalkeeper Alban Lafont was forced into a smart save from Valentin Rongier's long-range drive a minute after Limbombe's opener, but the Frenchman couldn't stop Sanson's curling effort three minutes later. The away side were back ahead again seven minutes after the break when Bamba pounced on Rongier losing the ball to curl home a stunning finish that was only confirmed as a goal after a long VAR check for offside. However there was no response from Marseille this time despite the return of star man Dimitri Payet from injury, and Nantes sealed the win in stoppage time in comical fashion. Steve Mandanda spilled Moses Simon's shot to Bamba, who failed to control the rebound and instead sent it bouncing off the legs of unwitting Marseille defender Alvaro and into the net. Elsewhere, Monaco failed to close the gap on the European places after their three-match winning streak came to an end with a 1-1 draw at Dijon. They are four points behind Lille, who occupy the last Champions League spot, in fifth after Guillermo Maripan earned a point for the away side with his 79th-minute equaliser after Mama Balde had put the hosts ahead 10 minutes after the break. Islam Slimani missed a golden chance to snatch the points for Monaco when he slammed a shot into the side netting after Youssouf Fofana had a rifled effort well saved. The point lifts Dijon out of the drop zone on goal difference, and they are five points ahead of Amiens, who stalled sixth-placed Strasbourg's charge for Europe with a goalless draw."
8,04/02/2020,23:27,PSG move 15 points clear with tight Nantes win,Paris Saint-Germain further strengthened their dominance of Ligue 1 on Tuesday with a 2-1 win at Nantes that moved the champions 15 points clear of the domestic rivals.,"Goals in either half from Mauro Icardi and Thilo Kehrer were just about enough for Thomas Tuchel's side to stretch their lead over second-placed Marseille ahead of their trip to Saint-Etienne on Wednesday. PSG extended their unbeaten run in all competitions to 20 matches despite a Presnel Kimpembe howler allowing Moses Simon to race through and pull one back in the 68th minute, setting up a nervy finish. The capital club were dominant for long periods despite the absence of Neymar with a rib complaint, and it was Kylian Mbappe, starting following his touchline spat with Tuchel at the weekend, who created the opener. World Cup winner Mbappe burst down the left flank before pulling back perfectly for Angel Di Maria, whose shot brushed fellow Argentine Icardi before nestling in the back of the net. The three points looked to be sealed 11 minutes after the break when Kehrer headed home Di Maria's corner. However, Kimpembe let Nantes back into the game 11 minutes later when his fluffed attempt at a flicked pass to centre-back partner Kehrer gave Simon his chance. PSG had a series of good opportunities to go back two goals ahead, with Mbappe twice denied by fine last-ditch defending, but they failed to capitalise and had to thank Keylor Navas for twice saving the result in the final minutes. First, he got out well to stop Simon as the Nigerian bore down on goal and in stoppage time got down brilliantly to push away Renaud Emond's close-range flick. Earlier, Rennes missed the chance to go second after Loic Remy's early goal consigned them to a 1-0 defeat at Champions League-chasing Lille. Remy struck in the fourth minute for the hosts when he collected Jonathan Ikone's pass before lashing home a long-range effort to move his fourth-placed side up to 37 points, three behind Rennes. The away side remain a further three points away from Marseille, who would have been temporarily overtaken by Rennes had they won by two goals or more. Monaco meanwhile won their first league match of 2020 1-0 over Angers thanks to Stevan Jovetic, who guided in Youssouf Fofana's long pass with his head to move Robert Moreno's side ninth, level on 32 points with four other teams. The victory ends a four-match winless run in the league for Monaco that was made worse by last week's French Cup exit at the hands of Saint-Etienne last week."
9,28/01/2020,20:46,Cardiff begin legal action over transfer of tragic Sala,"Cardiff City have made a legal complaint in a French court to ""fully understand"" the events surrounding the air crash death of Emiliano Sala, the Championship club told AFP on Tuesday.","Argentine Sala was killed just over a year ago when the small plane taking him to join Cardiff after being bought from French side Nantes for £15 million ($19.5 million, 17.6 million euros) crashed off the Channel island of Guernsey. In a statement, a Cardiff spokesperson said to AFP that they had carried out their own investigation into the 28-year-old's death and were presenting their findings to the Nantes public prosecutor's office. Their action was also aimed at answering ""the wider questions that have been highlighted in this case, specifically related to the use of illegal flights in the football industry and the role of intermediaries in player transfers,"" the spokesperson said. ""As a result of our investigation we believe there is sufficient evidence of wrongdoing that necessitates investigation by the French authorities of those responsible for the arrangement of the transfer on behalf of FC Nantes and for arranging the doomed flight."" The circumstances of the crash are murky and the aftermath has seen a bitter dispute between Ligue 1 club Nantes and Cardiff, in particular over the payment of the transfer fee. There were questions over the suitability of the plane, the qualifications of the 59-year-old pilot, David Ibbotson and the decision to hire both. The flight was arranged by another pilot, David Henderson, at the request of football agents Willie McKay and his son Mark, who were representing Nantes. In September, football's world governing body FIFA ordered Cardiff to pay the first six million euro instalment of the transfer fee. But the Welsh club has taken the matter to the Court of Arbitration for Sport, whose decision is not expected until June. On Tuesday Cardiff's legal representatives said that they wanted to know more about Nantes' role in the organisation of the fatal flight. A source at Nantes told AFP that they were ""amazed"" at Cardiff's actions, slamming the Welsh club for ""exploiting the tragedy and running away from its responsibilities"". The club had paid an emotional tribute to the striker ahead of their 1-0 home defeat to Bordeaux at the weekend. ""We are outraged at this new media offensive just days after the commemorations for Sala,"" added the source."
10,26/01/2020,19:09,Toko Ekambi scores on Lyon debut as clubs remember Sala,"Karl Toko Ekambi scored on his Lyon debut Sunday in a 3-0 victory over bottom club Toulouse while Nantes and Bordeaux paid tribute to their former striker Emiliano Sala, a year after his death in a plane crash.","Ivory Coast international Maxwel Cornet opened the scoring on the half-hour for Lyon before Moussa Dembele prodded in a second on 71 minutes at Groupama Stadium. Cameroon striker Toko Ekambi, who joined on loan this week from Villarreal until the end of the season, sealed the victory six minutes later as Lyon climbed up to fifth in Ligue 1. Toko Ekambi came on as a first-half substitute after a scary incident involving France Under-21 forward Martin Terrier. Terrier was stretchered off after fainting on the pitch, but Lyon said at half-time that the player had regained consciousness. Sixteen-year-old Rayan Cherki also made a brief appearance off the bench, having scored twice and provided two assists in a 4-3 French Cup win over Nantes last weekend. Nantes and Bordeaux honoured Argentine forward Sala before an emotional Derby de l'Atlantique at the Stade de la Beaujoire. Bordeaux won 1-0 courtesy of a late goal by Jimmy Briand as Nantes played most the second half with 10 men after the dismissal of Andrei Girotto. The 28-year-old Sala was killed last January when the small plane taking him to join Cardiff City after being bought from Nantes for £15 million ($19.5 million, 17.6 million euros) crashed off the Channel island of Guernsey. Nantes wore a special white and pale blue shirt inspired by Argentina while Bordeaux's kit featured an Argentine flag beneath the club crest flanked by the player's initials. Proceeds from the sales of the strips will go to the two Argentine clubs Sala played for in his youth. A portrait of Sala was also displayed in the centre circle during the warm-up and there was a minute's applause ahead of kick-off. Supporters laid flowers outside the ground and broke out into a song commemorating Sala in the ninth minute, representing the shirt number worn by the player which has since been retired by Nantes. Sala left his homeland to join Bordeaux in 2012 and then played for Nantes between 2015 and 2019. League leaders Paris Saint-Germain visit last year's runners-up Lille in Sunday's late game. PSG could stretch their advantage over Marseille to 10 points with victory, although Thomas Tuchel's side lost 5-1 on their last trip to Lille in April. That remains PSG's worst league defeat since 2000."
11,19/01/2020,12:47,Lyon teen Cherki set for 'big future' after French Cup star turn,"Lyon starlet Rayan Cherki was tipped for a ""big future"" by Nantes coach Christian Gourcuff after the teenager contributed to all four goals in his side's 4-3 victory in their French Cup tie.","The 16-year-old Cherki scored twice, provided two assists and won a penalty -- missed by Moussa Dembele -- in an eye-catching display as Lyon held off Nantes in the round of 32 on Saturday. Lyon boss Rudi Garcia, who handed Cherki his professional debut against Dijon in October, said it was the youngster's all-round commitment that most pleased him. ""We know he's a boy who has the ability to decide a match. Of course that pleased me,"" said Garcia. ""What delighted me though was his overall game and how he played with his team-mates, the intelligence of his choices and his defensive runs. If he continues likes that he will be able to keep making progress."" Garcia must also try and temper expectations for a burgeoning talent who has drawn comparisons to fellow Lyon academy graduates Karim Benzema and Hatem Ben Arfa. ""My role is also to lower those levels because everyone is going to praise him to the skies, but he's only 16 years old,"" said Garcia. ""It's going to be a great danger if he stops listening to me, no longer works hard and thinks he's already made it, when he's still got a long way to go."" Nantes counterpart Gourcuff admitted he didn't know too much about Cherki but was quickly impressed by his breakout performance. ""He has a big future. He's a very, very good footballer,"" Gourcuff said succinctly. It was only Cherki's eighth appearance for Lyon, and just a second start, but one that could prompt Garcia to fast-track his path to the first team, with Memphis Depay and Jeff Reine-Adelaide long-term absentees. ""We see him at training. Perhaps he surprised you but not us,"" said Lyon goalkeeper Anthony Lopes. Cherki, who became the club's youngest goalscorer the previous round in a 7-0 rout of Bourg-en-Bresse, was quick to deflect to the acclaim. ""It's thanks to my team-mates that I had this kind of match,"" he said. ""You can't just dwell on the statistics, it's the whole team. Now we need to take care of the fixtures to come."" Lyon host Lille in the French League Cup semi-finals in midweek before welcoming bottom side Toulouse on January 26, when Cherki could make his first Ligue 1 start."
12,04/12/2019,23:06,"Neymar, Mbappe fire PSG five points clear in Ligue 1",Neymar and Kylian Mbappe both scored as Paris Saint-Germain restored their five-point cushion at the top of Ligue 1 with a 2-0 win over Nantes on Wednesday.,"Mbappe's smart finish shortly after half-time and Neymar's late penalty saw the hosts ease to victory at the Parc des Princes. PSG, whose scheduled game against Monaco last weekend was postponed due to bad weather, also have a game in hand on second-placed Marseille as they bid for a seventh French league title in eight seasons. Marseille won 2-0 at Angers on Tuesday to briefly cut the gap to only two points. Thomas Tuchel started Neymar and Mbappe together for the first time this season, although the German coach left Edinson Cavani and Mauro Icardi on the bench. Mbappe fired the first opening over the crossbar, before Nantes' Ludovic Blas was denied by Keylor Navas in the PSG goal. Neymar appeared to have put the hosts in front with a fantastic left-footed strike after Nantes could only half clear a corner, but following a lengthy delay, the goal was ruled out by VAR for an apparent high foot from Julian Draxler. The world's most expensive player almost gave PSG a half-time lead anyway, but saw his low shot tipped away by visiting goalkeeper Alban Lafont. The league leaders did forge ahead in the 52nd minute as Mbappe met Angel Di Maria's low cross with a backheel flick into the corner after fine work by Neymar. The Brazilian eventually got his goal with five minutes remaining, scoring his penalty at the second time of asking after substitute Icardi encroached in the area. Earlier on Wednesday, Gelson Martins came off the bench to fire Monaco to a 2-1 win over Toulouse as the principality side made it six victories in nine league outings. Saint-Etienne moved into fifth with a 4-1 success over Nice, while Montpellier were held to a 2-2 draw at lowly Dijon. Amiens' game against Reims was postponed due to fog. Bordeaux were ordered to temporarily close the south stand at their Matmut Stadium after fans protesting against club president Frederic Longuepee delayed their 6-0 thrashing of Nimes by 25 minutes on Tuesday after invading the pitch."
13,30/09/2019,19:09,FIFA order Cardiff to pay Nantes first instalment of Emiliano Sala transfer,"Cardiff City must pay French club Nantes an initial six million euros ($6.5 million) in their dispute over the payment of the transfer fee for Emiliano Sala, FIFA said on Monday.","The amount corresponds to the first instalment of the 17 million-euro fee Cardiff had agreed to pay Nantes before Sala died in a plane crash on January 21 while travelling to join his new club. Cardiff had previously resolved not to pay any of the money even though the transfer had been completed before the accident. In relation to the remainder of the initially agreed fee, FIFA told AFP: ""For confidentiality reasons, we cannot comment at this stage on potential future instalments or other conditions of the transfer agreement."" The announcement from world football's governing body followed a meeting by its Players' Status Committee. In a statement, FIFA said it had ""never lost sight of the specific and unique circumstances of this tragic situation during its deliberations on the dispute at stake."" Both clubs can appeal the decision to the Swiss-based Court of Arbitration for Sport, although in a statement Nantes said they were ""pleased with FIFA's decision."" ""Cardiff must honour their commitments and the rule of the laws of sport,"" the club's lawyers wrote in a text message sent to AFP. ""Above and beyond the human tragedy of Emiliano Sala's death which touched everyone in the sport, FIFA have provided a reminder that the commitments made by clubs when they sign players obviously must be respected."" Nantes had previously appealed in February over Cardiff's failure to pay the 17 million euros they said was owed because Sala had already signed for the Welsh side. ""The International Transfer Certificate, delivered by FIFA, established that, on the day of the accident, Emiliano was a Cardiff player,"" Nantes added. A Cardiff spokesperson said the club ""acknowledges the decision"" but added that they ""will be seeking further clarification from FIFA on the exact meaning of their statement in order to make an informed decision on our next steps."" The plane Sala was travelling on came down in the English Channel during a night-time flight. His body was recovered, but that of the pilot, David Ibbotson, has never been found. A report by Britain's Air Accidents Investigation Branch in August said that Sala and the pilot were likely exposed to ""potentially fatal"" levels of carbon monoxide on the plane. In the aftermath of the tragedy, Cardiff were relegated from the Premier League after just one season back in the top flight."

As Samuel Moutoussamy broke into the home area, left back Fernando Marcal slid in and attempted to poke the ball out for a corner. Instead, it struck his other leg and looped over goalkeeper Anthony Lopes and into the goal. As the home fans whistled their team, the Lyon players appeared increasingly lost, although the brilliance of Nantes goalkeeper Alban Lafont was a major factor in their failure. Lyon remained 11th after a seventh straight winless match, a run that includes three losses and three draws in the league and a home draw with Zenit St. Petersburg in the Champions League. They visit RB Leipzig in Europe on Wednesday. Nantes had not won in Lyon since December 1996, a run of 17 matches. The victory continues their revival under coach Christian Gourcuff. The Canaries climbed one point clear of Paris Saint-Germain, who visit Bordeaux in the afternoon, and Angers who host Amiens in the evening."

""We can confirm that a letter was sent to the parties on behalf of the chairman of the players' status committee. Please understand we cannot comment further at this stage,"" FIFA said in a statement to AFP. Nantes appealed to the commission in February after Cardiff failed to pay 17 million euros the French club said it was owed following the transfer of Argentinian striker Sala, who died on January 21 in a plane crash while travelling to join his new club. Cardiff had earlier resolved not to pay a first instalment of six million euros of the 17 million fee agreed before the accident."

The Daily Telegraph said Sala signed a contract with Cardiff that was rejected by the Premier League and died before a revised one could be signed, adding that there is a dispute about whether he had agreed to sign a new deal. According to the report, a source close to Cardiff said the agreement stipulated that Welsh and French football authorities had to confirm to both clubs that Sala ""has been registered as a Cardiff City FC player and that the player's International Transfer Certificate has been released"". The source said this had not happened before Sala died. ""The transfer agreement between Cardiff and Nantes was subject to several conditions,"" the source told the paper. ""If any were not satisfied, the contract would be deemed null and void, with no payment due. Nantes proposed that clause. They asked for the strict notification requirements."" Nantes reportedly plan to dispute Cardiff's case, saying the club completed the required paperwork. The club last month referred their dispute with Cardiff over the transfer to FIFA, football's governing body. Britain's Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) previously said the plane carrying Sala, piloted by David Ibbotson, did not have a commercial licence. But it said the journey would have been allowed as a ""private"" flight in which costs are shared between pilot and passenger. It added that the basis on which Sala was a passenger had not been established. The investigators also said since the pilot's logbook and licence were not recovered, it was unclear whether Ibbotson was authorised to fly at night. Sala's body was recovered from the wreckage early last month but Ibbotson's body has not been found."

21,27/02/2019,15:30,Nantes take Sala transfer dispute to FIFA,"French club Nantes have referred their dispute with Cardiff City over the transfer fee of Emiliano Sala to FIFA, football's governing body confirmed on Wednesday.","The clubs are wrangling over payment of the fee following the tragic death of Argentinian Sala in an airplane accident in January. Nantes referred the matter to the sport's global body after the Welsh side declined to pay an initial six million euros ($6.8 million) of the 17 million euros ($19.4 million) total fee. ""We can confirm that we have received yesterday evening (Tuesday) a claim from FC Nantes against Cardiff City in connection with the transfer of Emiliano Sala,"" a FIFA spokesperson said. ""We are looking into the matter and consequently we have no further comments at this stage."" Sala died in plane crash on his way from Nantes to Cardiff to join his new club. Pilot David Ibbotson, 59, was flying the 28-year-old Argentine striker Sala to the Premier League outfit on January 21 when the accident happened. Cardiff said they wanted to wait for the results of the investigation into the accident before transferring the fee. Britain's Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB)said Monday the plane carrying Sala did not have a commercial licence. But it said the journey would have been allowed as a ""private"" flight in which costs are shared between pilot and passenger. It added that the basis on which Sala was a passenger had not been established. Football agent Mark McKay had a mandate from Nantes to negotiate the transfer of the professional contract between the two clubs. Nantes has said that the mandate had expired by the time Sala boarded the flight as he had already signed for Cardiff City. The investigators also said that since the pilot's logbook and licence were not recovered, it was unclear whether Ibbotson was authorised to fly at night. Ibbotson's body has not been found."
22,25/02/2019,16:49,Sala plane did not have commercial licence: investigators,"The plane carrying footballer Emiliano Sala that crashed in the Channel last month did not have a commercial licence, British investigators said Monday.","But the Air Accidents Investigation Branch said the journey would have been allowed as a ""private"" flight in which costs are shared between pilot and passenger. ""The basis on which the passenger was being carried on N264DB has not yet been established but, previously, the pilot had carried passengers on the basis of cost sharing,"" the AAIB said in an interim report. Pilot David Ibbotson was flying Sala to his new Premier League club Cardiff City from his previous side in Nantes in France on January 21 when the accident happened. Football agents Willie and Mark McKay, father and son, were hired by Nantes to secure the transfer. Speaking to The Times, Willie McKay has said that Mark arranged the flight, just as he had organised several flights for brokers of the deal in previous weeks. The plane, a Piper PA-46 Malibu from 1984, was registered in the US, according to the report. The investigators also said that since the pilot's logbook and licence were not recovered, it was unclear whether Ibbotson was authorised to fly at night. The report said the plane took off at 1915 hours. At 1958, Jersey air traffic control asked the pilot if the plant's altimeter was working because the radar indicated it was flying lower than it should have been. The weather radar at the time showed ""a band of showers, some heavy, passing through the area"". At 2002 the pilot requested clearance to descend. The controller asked if the plane required another descent to which the pilot responded: ""Negative, just avoided a patch there, but back on heading five thousand feet."" At 2012, Ibbotson did request a further descent. The plane then descended twice and ascended twice before disappearing from the radar. The wreckage was found on the seabed at a depth of approximately 68 metres, the report said, as investigators released fresh pictures of the plane. ""The aircraft was extensively damaged, and the main body of the aircraft was in three parts held together by electrical and flying control cables,"" it said. ""The engine had disconnected from the cockpit areas, and the rear section of the fuselage had broken away from the forward section adjacent to the trailing edge of the wing."" The report said two seat cushions, an arm rest and what may have been a piece of fuselage washed up on the French coast, while a seat cushion was found on Jersey. The aircraft was not fitted with black box data and voice recorders and was not required to be. Sala's body was recovered from the submerged wreckage on February 7."

They were also punished for the same reasons following their home game against Nimes on February 10, three days after Sala's body was recovered from the wreckage of the plane.

24,20/02/2019,13:51,Sala tragedy sparks unsavoury legal wrangle,The tragedy of the plane crash that killed Argentine footballer Emiliano Sala has now entered an ugly aftermath as Premier League club Cardiff City and French side Nantes threaten to go to court over his £15 million ($19 million) transfer fee.,"Sala, who was buried at the age of 28 in the Argentine village of Progreso on Saturday, never played a game for Cardiff. The plane carrying the striker and pilot David Ibbotson came down in the English Channel en route to the Welsh capital on January 21, two days after he completed his transfer from Nantes. Cardiff have so far refused to pay the first instalment of the club record fee, believed to be £5 million, as they await the results of an Air Accidents Investigations Bureau (AAIB) investigation into the causes of the crash. The Telegraph reported on Sunday that Cardiff believe that if the AAIB find Ibbotson did not hold the necessary licence to carry passengers on a commercial basis, then a negligence claim could be launched against whoever arranged the flight. That would point the finger at agents Willie and Mark McKay, who were hired by Nantes to secure the transfer. Willie McKay has accused Cardiff of ""trying to throw me under the bus"" in an attempt to avoid paying the transfer fee. Speaking to The Times, Willie McKay said his son Mark arranged the fateful flight carrying Sala and Ibbotson, just as he had organised several flights for brokers of the deal in the weeks previously, including Cardiff manager Neil Warnock. Willie McKay also rejected a statement from Cardiff chairman Mehmet Dalman that the club were unaware of who made Sala's flight arrangements. In his published timeline of events, Willie McKay said: ""Emiliano was due to be met by the Cardiff City player liaison officer who was waiting for him to arrive at the Signature Flight Support building at Cardiff Airport on Monday evening (January 21). Cardiff City knew of the flight and who organised the flight."" Cardiff have also reportedly questioned Willie McKay's practice of trying to inflate transfer fees by fabricating interest in players from clubs. ""It was us who put in the media about other clubs wanting you - West Ham, Everton etc - to create an interest on you that's what we do,"" Willie McKay wrote in a letter to Sala that has now been made public. However, that is a common, if dubious, practice among football agents and Cardiff's case to use that as a reason for avoiding any part of the transfer fee is unlikely to be met with favour should the case proceed to court. Nantes believe the McKays' work for them ended when Sala's move was transfer was completed, therefore absolving them of any responsibility over the arrangements of the flight. The Guardian reported on Wednesday that Nantes will take their case to FIFA this week if the £5 million instalment is not paid. ""FIFA has not been contacted on this matter,"" world football's governing body said when contacted by AFP. A resolution via FIFA's players' status committee or even the Lausanne-based Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) is likely unless Cardiff relent on their current stance. ""There are, in my opinion, two possible solutions,"" sports lawyer Gianpaolo Monteneri, who was head of FIFA's Players' Status Department from 1997-2005, told the Press Association. ""The first one is that the parties have established to go to FIFA and, in such a case, the matter is submitted to the players' status committee in the first instance, with the possibility of an appeal to CAS. ""But it is also possible that the parties have decided to skip FIFA and go direct to CAS."" Should Cardiff be found to have failed to comply with their contractual obligations without due cause, a range of sanctions are on offer to FIFA, according to Monteneri. ""If certain deadlines, which are mentioned in the transfer contract, are not met then these may trigger consequences for the club in question. ""This can be from an admonishment right up to a withdrawal of league points."""
25,17/02/2019,13:42,Cardiff considering legal action against Nantes over Sala 'negligence' - report,"Cardiff City could launch a negligence claim against Nantes as soon as next week if an official report finds Emiliano Sala was flown to his death by a pilot who did not have the correct licence, according to Britain's Sunday Telegraph.","Premier League side Cardiff already find themselves involved in a legal dispute with French side Nantes over whether they are contractually obliged to pay a transfer fee for the Argentinian striker, who died without playing a game for the Welsh side. Sala had signed for Cardiff for a club record £15 million ($19 million) and was flying to his new team from former side Nantes in France when his plane went missing over the Channel on January 21. The wreckage was located on the seabed. Sala's body was recovered but pilot David Ibbotson is still missing. The aircraft remains under the sea. Details of how Sala died, and who was responsible, could be clarified in the coming days by Britain's Air Accidents Investigations Bureau, which had previously said it intended to publish an interim report into the crash within a month of it occurring. The Telegraph said an internal Cardiff inquiry had found no evidence that Ibbotson held the licence necessary to carry passengers on a commercial basis. If the AAIB report upholds this view, it may constitute the basis for a claim of negligence against whoever recruited Ibbotson as the pilot for Sala's flight. Agents Willie and Mark McKay have said they arranged Sala's flight but did not select the plane or pilot. The pair had been working for Nantes. A successful negligence claim against Nantes would reduce the transfer fee that Cardiff owed the French club. And that payment could decrease further if Cardiff can show that Sala's transfer was incomplete at the time of his death because he had not yet been registered to play in the Premier League. ""We believe that the player was not registered with the Premier League,"" Cardiff chairman Mehmet Dalman told the Telegraph. Sala was buried in his hometown of Progreso in Argentina on Saturday, with Cardiff manager Neil Warnock and club executive Ken Choo among the mourners. ""It was important for us to come and pay the respect to the family,"" Warnock told AFP. ""People tell me: 'He never played for you,' but he was my player, I signed him, we had two or three conversations and he told me he would score the goals to keep Cardiff in the Premier League."""

""For the family of Emiliano and the pilot it is just terrible,"" added Halilhodzic, who broke down in tears as he spoke to reporters. The Bosnian had been appointed by Nantes in October and had been hoping to keep Sala, who scored 12 league goals for the club in the first half of the season. The player was eventually sold to Cardiff City last month for 17 million euros ($19.3 million) and had been on his way to Wales to begin training with his new club when he disappeared on January 21 near the British island of Guernsey. The only other person on board was the aircraft's 59-year-old pilot David Ibbotson, who has not been found. Nantes announced Friday that they would retire Sala's old number nine jersey. Halilhodzic said that Sala ""will forever leave a mark on this club for the way he carried himself, his modesty, not just as a player but as a man. He was popular with everyone. ""You know, in football nowadays a lot of players are selfish, and only think of themselves...he was the opposite of that."" The press conference was scheduled to be about Nantes' Ligue 1 game against Nimes on Sunday before it emerged late on Friday that Sala's body had been found. Halilhodzic admitted that Sala's old teammates would find it difficult to turn their thoughts back to playing football. ""Before training we will have a small ceremony, dignified and modest like he was. But whether we will be able to do any work is another matter."" The Nantes coach also reacted angrily to a question about moves by the French club to ensure Cardiff pay the transfer fee for Sala. ""I don't want to talk about that, stop that, it's not my problem...To talk about money in these moments is disgusting,"" he said."

According to the source, the first instalment of the 17-million-euro ($19.3 million) deal for the Argentine striker has yet to be paid, despite the transfer being finalised. Nantes would also consider taking the case to FIFA, the source added. According to BBC Wales, Nantes have given Cardiff a 10-day ultimatum over the first payment of five million euros. A source at Cardiff told British media that the Welsh club will honour the contract but only once they have clarified ""all the facts"". The missing plane, which was also carrying 59-year-old pilot David Ibbotson, was found on Sunday after a private search organised by the Sala family. A body was spotted in underwater images of the wreckage and Britain's Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) has launched an operation to try and recover it. Sala, who signed a three-and-a-half year deal with Cardiff, was the club's record signing. The two clubs had agreed on a payout in three instalments, which is relatively common in big transfers. Sala's former club Bordeaux, who sold the Argentine to Nantes in 2015, are entitled to receive half of the total fee."

British crash investigators on Tuesday launched an underwater operation to recover a body from the wreckage of the plane, which was carrying Sala and pilot David Ibbotson. Nantes progressed to the quarter-finals a few hours later with a 2-0 win at home to Toulouse after goals by Kalifa Coulibaly and Anthony Limbombe. ""In two games we could be in the final. If the draw is kind to us why not go to the final? It would be a gift to pay tribute (to Sala),"" Halilhodzic said. The Bosnian fought back tears last week when Nantes paid an emotional tribute to Sala at the Stade de la Beaujoire in the club's first match since his disappearance. ""We're coming back slowly, after Saint-Etienne and Sannois-Saint-Gratien,"" Halilhodzic added. ""It's almost a second beginning.

On Monday, the 28-year-old was a passenger in a private plane on its way to Wales, where he was due to attend a training session on Tuesday. However, the plane disappeared from radar around 20 kilometres (12 miles) north of Guernsey on Monday night. Fans in both Nantes and Cardiff held vigils for the player on Tuesday night but one question that faces both clubs, is who will pay the transfer fee, which represents a substantial amount of money for both clubs. ""The transfer contract is valid as soon as it is registered with FIFA,"" Alexandra Cohen Jonathan, a lawyer and partner at the Paris firm August Debouzy, told AFP. ""If this is the case, in principle Cardiff must pay the 17 million to Nantes even though the player has disappeared."" According to a source close to FC Nantes, the deal had been finalised. ""The contract was signed Saturday at 5pm and approved Monday,"" said the source. Broadly, big clubs take out two types of insurance to cover players. There is liability cover, against bodily injuries suffered by players which is attributable to the employer. Then there is 'key man' insurance, originally designed to protect businesses from the sudden loss of important members of the company, which football clubs use to cover themselves in case they lose valuable squad members. It is based on transfer values. ""Nantes had certainly signed a contract of this type, but does this contract still apply when a transfer has already been signed?"" asked Cohen Jonathan. ""Have Cardiff already taken out this insurance? Had it already come into effect?"" As for the liability insurance, that would only come into play ""if one of the two clubs was the organiser of air transport,"" said Cohen Jonathan, adding that this does not seem to be the case. Cardiff president Mehmet Dalman said on Wednesday that the club had offered to arrange Sala's trip but the attacker had opted to make ""his own arrangements"". In plane accidents, the carrier is responsible for compensation but the payout is normally capped at 100,000 euros, said Cohen Jonathan. But that cap disappears ""if you prove the air carrier is at fault,"" the lawyer added. ""In that case, the right to compensation is complete and full, that is to say that if the damage is 17 million, we have the right to the entire sum in compensation."" The interested parties would need to prove the owner of the plane was to blame and, indeed, to establish who that is. Shortly before take off, Sala sent relatives a desperate message saying the plane looked like it was ""going to fall apart"". That message ""will necessarily lead to an examination of the plane's maintenance log"" to try to establish a possible fault and the responsibility of the air carrier or, in case of the failure of a component, an equipment manufacturer in case of failure of a component, said the lawyer. ""In any case, someone will have to pay 17 million euros,"" said Cohen Jonathan."
31,23/01/2019,19:07,Cardiff striker Sala presumed dead as rescuers suspend sea search,"Hopes all but vanished of finding new Cardiff City striker Emiliano Sala alive as British, French and Channel Islands rescuers on Wednesday suspended a second day of searches after the plane he was flying in disappeared at sea.","The Argentine footballer had sent relatives a desperate message shortly before taking off saying the plane looked like it was ""going to fall apart"". Objects have been found in the water, and police on the British island of Guernsey, which sits off the north coast of France, warned there was little chance of finding him. ""A decision about whether to recommence will be taken early Thursday morning,"" police said in a statement. ""The water is very cold at the moment, the sea conditions are very rough out there, the wind is very strong,"" John Fitzgerald, chief officer of Channel Island Air Search, to AFP. ""I think even the most hardened person out there -- they'd have to be really tough to survive those conditions for the length of time that they'd been there."" The Guernsey coastguard also named the pilot, the only other person in the plane, as David Ibbotson. British media said he was a 60-year-old married father of three and lived in Scunthorpe in northern England. Argentine media reported that Sala sent a final message before the plane disappeared from radar around 20 kilometres (12 miles) north of Guernsey on Monday night. ""I'm on a plane that looks like it's going to fall apart, and I'm leaving for Cardiff,"" the 28-year-old said in a rambling WhatsApp audio message. ""If in an hour and a half you have no news from me, I don't know if they will send people to look for me, because they will not find me, you know... I'm so scared,"" he added. The player's mother, Mercedes, told Argentine television channel C5N that the plane belonged to Cardiff chairman Mehmet Dalman, but he disputed the claim. ""I can say to you categorically that the plane had nothing to do with Cardiff City,"" he said. Dalman said the club had offered to pay for his flight but Sala had ""made his own arrangements"". ""I can't tell you who arranged the flight because I don't know."" Britain's Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB), which is investigating, said the single-engine Piper PA-46 Malibu plane was registered in the United States. Sala, who signed with the Premier League club on Saturday from French Ligue 1 club Nantes for a reported fee of 17 million euros ($19.3 million), was due to attend a training session with Cardiff on Tuesday. In Sala's Argentine hometown of Progreso, his father Horacio told the press that as ""the hours go by and I don't know anything, it makes me fear the worst"". Sala, who had been at Nantes since 2015 and had scored 13 goals in all competitions this season, had signed a three-and-a-half-year contract with relegation-threatened Cardiff subject to receiving international clearance. Cardiff's executive director Ken Choo said they were all ""very shocked"" at the news. ""We continue to pray for positive news,"" he said. Cardiff called off Tuesday's training session, and stunned supporters laid flowers and scarves outside the club's stadium. ""The excitement of a new signing arriving at your club can bring so much happiness. That's how we felt about Sala,"" said Cardiff fan Josh Thomas, 24. ""He was the one who was going to turn our fortunes around and score the goals that would keep us up. He was going to be the one adored by the fans, including me. But within a few hours so much has changed."" Argentine football legend Diego Maradona said he was hoping the plane had simply gone astray. ""I hope it went to the wrong airport and we find him alive, that's all,"" he said in an audio message. Real Madrid coach Santiago Solari, also an Argentinian, said: ""We feel great sadness of course and we send all the strength and love in the world to the relatives, close friends, and people that know him."" ""And of course we never lose hope until the end,"" he said. With his former teammates in shock, Nantes have postponed their French Cup tie against third-tier side Entente Sannois Saint-Gratien on Wednesday until Sunday. Hundreds of fans gathered for a vigil in the western French city on Tuesday, placing flowers, scarves and flags on a fountain and chanting the striker's name. ""I still have hope, he is a fighter,"" Nantes president Waldemar Kita tweeted."
32,22/01/2019,13:06,Emiliano Sala - the unorthodox Argentine striker made in France,"""Everyone is happy, except me,"" said the Nantes coach Vahid Halilhodzic last week as he accepted that his leading scorer, Emiliano Sala, was leaving the club in a record transfer to Premier League side Cardiff City.","The Welsh club had agreed to pay a reported £15 million (17 million euros; $19.3 million) for the 1.87m-tall Argentine forward, hoping that his eye for goal would fire them to Premier League safety. Now Sala, 28, is feared dead after French authorities confirmed that he was on board a light aircraft that disappeared over the English Channel on Monday night, just north of the island of Guernsey. He was on his way from Nantes back to Wales, having signed a lucrative three-and-a-half-year contract in Cardiff on Saturday. ""For me it feels special,"" he said of being Cardiff's record signing. It was a move that looked in doubt at one point, with Sala having previously expressed a desire to join a club involved in European competition in the event of a transfer away from Nantes, the eight-time French champions. An imposing physical presence but also adept with his feet, Sala left Ligue 1 having scored 12 goals this season, a tally currently bettered only by Paris Saint-Germain's superstar trio of Neymar, Kylian Mbappe and Edinson Cavani, as well as Nicolas Pepe of Lille. That tally also matched his statistics for each of the last two campaigns, and only a certain Lionel Messi has scored more goals this season among Argentine players in the big five European leagues. Despite that, Sala has never played for his country and remains little known back in his homeland -- an article on the website of popular sports daily Ole on Tuesday carried the headline: ""Who is Emiliano Sala?"" That is because, like many talented young footballers in Argentina, Sala left for Europe at such a young age. Born in the province of Santa Fe, Sala developed as a player at Proyecto Crecer (Growth Project), an academy based in the town of San Francisco, four hours north of the capital Buenos Aires. The academy has a partnership with Bordeaux, and Sala is one of a handful of players to have gone from there to the French side. Another, midfielder Valentin Vada, is currently in their first-team squad. Having joined Bordeaux aged 20 in 2010, Sala never really broke into their first team, but he had prolific spells on loan in the French lower leagues, including at Niort in Ligue 2. After another loan stint at Ligue 1 side Caen, Sala was sold to Nantes in 2015 and quickly became a fan favourite for his performances in the famous yellow shirt of the Canaries. ""People see the way he fights for every ball. That encourages his teammates to do the same. He is a good example for everyone,"" said Claudio Ranieri, his coach at Nantes last season. Despite Sala's importance to Nantes, he was keen to move on, and club president Waldemar Kita was keen to cash in on a player whose contract was due to expire in 2020. Having finally put pen to paper on his move to Cardiff, Sala was back at Nantes' Joneliere training base on Monday to collect his belongings and wave goodbye to his former teammates before departing for Wales again. He would have been hoping to make his Premier League bow away at Arsenal next Tuesday. ""@EmilianoSala1, forever in yellow and green,"" tweeted Nantes on Monday evening, along with the hashtag #MerciEmi."

PSG coach Thomas Tuchel can also go on holiday relaxed with his club on 47 points, as second-placed Lille, 13 points adrift, lost 2-1 at home to Toulouse. ""I'm very happy because we can see the progress of the team,"" said Tuchel. ""You can feel the energy, it's a good thing to build on next year."" With Neymar away, Angel Di Maria was in the line-up and came closest to making it 2-0, forcing a fine save from Nantes goalkeeper Ciprian Tatarusanu, who then watched the Argentine hit the crossbar from the rebound. Meanwhile, third-placed Lyon drew 1-1 at fourth-placed Montpellier after opening the scoring thanks to their captain Nabil Fekir before a great header from Ruben Aguilar gave the surprise-package southerners a share of the spoils. Henry's Monaco were dreadful and the former Arsenal striker spat on the ground after Nolan Roux of Guingamp made fools of the Monaco defence to make it 2-0. ""I'm not going to have a good holiday,"" bemoaned Henry. ""Now you have to work and make do with what you have. ""It's necessary to work and work. There are still a lot of points to play for and that's the only positive thing about this evening."" Monaco were champions in 2017 but now have 13 points from 18 matches, just two more than Guingamp, and vice-president Vadim Vasilyev said the club needs to dip into the January transfer market. ""Until tonight, I thought we didn't need new players, but we do,"" Vasilyev told Canal+. ""It's difficult to analyse right now as I'm upset like the supporters. I understand the disappointment, it's up to us to act and draw the right conclusions."" Strasbourg paid hommage to the victims of a terror attack that killed five people on December 11 in their first home game since as they won 2-0 against Nice. Meanwhile, Marseille, in sixth, drew 1-1 at Angers and fifth-placed Saint-Etienne beat Dijon 3-0."
34,12/12/2018,13:43,Two French Ligue 1 games postponed as protests tie up police,"Two Ligue 1 games in France scheduled for the weekend have been postponed because police resources are required elsewhere, the league (LFP) said Wednesday.","The LFP said one of the games, Saint-Etienne's visit to the southern city of Nice, scheduled for 8:45pm (1945 GMT) on Friday, could be played on Sunday at 5:00pm. Both teams also had their matches called off last week, ahead of a weekend of ""yellow vest"" anti-government protests in France that descended into violence in Paris and several other cities. LFP said it would reschedule the other match, between Nantes, scene of violent demonstrations last weekend, and Montpellier, at a later date. The league said it had taken the decision ""because of current events and the assignment of the police on other missions"". Last Saturday, protests in Nanted by nearly 3,000 people resulted in 13 arrests and injuries to five police officers and three protesters. Last weekend, six Ligue 1 matches were postponed at the request of local authorities. They are due to be played in midweek on January 15 and 16. In addition to possible protests, the government have increased security levels following a deadly attack on the Christmas Market in Strasbourg on Tuesday."
35,12/11/2018,00:10,Cavani bags hat-trick as perfect PSG leave Henry's Monaco down and out,Thierry Henry's disastrous start as coach of Monaco continued on Sunday as Edinson Cavani's VAR-assisted hat-trick helped Paris Saint-Germain to an easy 4-0 win in the principality that saw them extend their perfect record in Ligue 1 this season.,"Neymar netted a penalty to complete PSG's victory, as they made it 13 wins from 13 league games under Thomas Tuchel, further stretching their start to the season that is a record in France and in Europe's so-called big five leagues. The result for them came after a week marred by revelations from French investigative website Mediapart that youth scouts at PSG had subjected potential signings to racial profiling over several years. But while they go 13 points clear of second-placed Lille at the Ligue 1 summit, the club who have been their main challengers in recent seasons continued their deeply worrying slump, with Henry again left to look on helplessly from the touchline. Champions in 2017, Monaco are in the relegation zone and five points away from outright safety having failed to win in six matches in all competitions since the Arsenal and France great took charge. They have now gone 16 games without a win altogether, with this result following a 4-0 home reverse against Club Brugge which knocked them out of the Champions League. Monaco are on their worst run in France's top flight in 32 years, at a time when Football Leaks claims about their Financial Fair Play breaches and the arrest of their Russian billionaire owner Dmitry Rybolovlev on corruption charges have cast a further shadow over the club. ""We are playing for survival, nothing else,"" said Henry, who has picked up a squad cursed by injuries. Here he was missing a dozen players due either to injury or suspension at kick-off, while both Belgian international Nacer Chadli and his replacement Jordi Mboula had to come off hurt. ""We lost two more players tonight, so it is starting to become a lot,"" he said, adding: ""I am staying positive because even with all that we managed to create chances against PSG."" The average age of his bench here was under 19, while his starting line-up featured a 17-year-old debutant in defence in Benoit Badiashile. It was little wonder that PSG -- themselves showing six changes following their Champions League draw at Napoli -- found the going so easy. They went ahead in the fourth minute when Neymar drove the ball across goal for Cavani to convert. The goal was initially disallowed before being given by the Video Assistant Referee, and the same thing happened in the 11th minute when Cavani turned the ball in again after the flag was wrongly raised for an offside against Moussa Diaby. In contrast to those two goals, a fine Julian Draxler finish in first-half stoppage time was initially given before being disallowed on review. However, Diaby squared for Cavani to complete his hat-trick in the 54th minute, and Neymar then rolled in a penalty after Kylian Mbappe had been fouled by France teammate Djibril Sidibe. ""I am very satisfied with the result, and with the fact we showed the hunger to win a 13th straight game. That is extraordinary,"" said Tuchel. ""Monaco and Henry are in a very difficult situation with lots of players out injured. This wasn't the night for Monaco to challenge us. They can do that if they have all their players back but not today."" Elsewhere on Sunday, Lucas Ocampos and Adil Rami scored as Marseille bounced back from a run of four straight defeats to beat Dijon 2-0 on an emotional afternoon at the Velodrome. A minute's silence was held before kick-off in memory of the eight people killed when two buildings collapsed in the southern French city on Monday. The result lifted Marseille up to sixth, back to within three points of third-placed Montpellier, who beat them 3-0 last weekend. Bordeaux were held to a goalless draw by Caen, while Rennes drew 1-1 with local rivals Nantes."
36,02/10/2018,16:17,Nantes fire Cardoso and hire former Japan coach Halilhodzic,"French league strugglers Nantes replaced under-fire Portuguese coach Miguel Cardoso with former player Vahid Halilhodzic on Tuesday, the club announced.","Cardoso, who arrived in the summer, amassed only six points from eight league matches during his brief spell with the Canaries and came under fire from club president Waldemar Kita for not deploying players who had been bought in the summer. Nantes currently sit second from bottom of Ligue 1, 18 points behind leaders Paris Saint-Germain. A club statement said: ""FC Nantes and Miguel Cardoso have reached a mutual agreement to end their collaboration. ""FC Nantes would like to thank the Portuguese coach and all of his staff for their contribution and efforts."" Franco-Bosnian Halilhodzic, 66, was a striker with Nantes during their golden age in the 1980s. He went on to coach Lille and Rennes but has not worked in France since he was fired by PSG in 2005, less than a year after leading the capital club to the French Cup title and qualifying them for the 2005 Champions League. Since then he has coached clubs in Turkey, Croatia and Saudi Arabia. He also managed the national teams of Ivory Coast, Algeria -- who he led to the knockout rounds at the 2014 World Cup -- and Japan, where he was fired after qualifying the Blue Samurai for the 2018 World Cup. Halilhodzic arrived at Nantes' training ground early on Tuesday afternoon. Halilhodzic, who has a reputation as a strict and fiery coach with a more defensive approach than Cardoso, represents a switch in direction for the club."
37,07/04/2018,19:04,Falcao inspires Monaco to victory over Nantes,Radamel Falcao starred as Monaco strengthed their grip on second place in Ligue 1 with a come-from-behind 2-1 victory over Nantes in the principality on Saturday.,"Captain Falcao scored one and created another as reigning champions Monaco moved eight points clear of third-placed Marseille, although they remain 14 points behind champions elect Paris Saint-Germain. Midfielder Adrien Thomasson put Nantes into a 32nd-minute lead with a magnificent strike, bringing down a long ball and firing a dipping volley over Monaco goalkeeper Danijel Subasic and into the far corner. But Monaco turned the game around in the space of three minutes before half-time. Falcao drilled in an equaliser from Rony Lopes' excellent lay-off after Fabinho's driven cross. The Colombian international, despite struggling with injuries for much of the campaign, has now scored 24 goals in all competitions this season. Portuguese winger Lopes has also been in fine form this term, and he gave Leonardo Jardim's hosts the lead with a clever turn and left-footed strike after being picked out by Falcao. Nantes hung in the game in the second half but couldn't find an equaliser, and Claudio Ranieri's men remain two points off a Europa League spot. Players and fans paid their respects before the match to Le Havre youngster Samba Diop, who died earlier on Saturday at the age of 18. The second-division French club did not state the midfielder's cause of death. ""This is a horrible moment for all the players, from the academy to the professional squad,"" the club said in a statement. PSG could seal the title next weekend when they welcome Monaco to the Parc des Princes, despite Friday's 1-1 draw at Saint-Etienne."
38,06/04/2018,12:50,Ranieri angrily challenges talk of a split with Nantes,"With results slipping and the club only grudgingly denying rumours of a divorce, the love affair between French club Nantes and Claudio Ranieri appears to be fading.","The Italian coach was unhappy with questions about his future at the press conference on Thursday ahead of Saturday's French league match against Monaco. ""What do I need to clarify?"" Ranieri stormed. ""If you say I'm going there or there or there, produce the contract! Next year, I have a contract here. What more can I say?"" While uncertainty has begun to grow over Ranieri's future at Nantes, it also hovers over a more glamorous position that might attract him: coach of the Italian national team. Back in February, Ranieri said on Italian television: ""If I was approached about the Italy job, I would go and see the president of Nantes and ask him to release me."" The Italian has also been linked to positions at Nice and Lyon that could become vacant before next season. Later on Thursday, club president Waldemar Kita did not display great enthusiasm for keeping Ranieri. ""I'm not someone who puts the brakes on the professional ambitions of my employees, so I'm not going to do it,"" Kita said. Nantes recruited Ranieri in a hurry last June and signed him to a contract that reflected his past successes but was extremely high for a club of their means. This season, Nantes have been hyper-defensive and struggled to score goals, hitting just 30 in 31 league games. Last Sunday's 3-0 home loss to Saint-Etienne dropped the Canaries to eighth in Ligue 1, two points behind fifth-place Rennes in the last Europa League spot. Montpellier are sixth and Nice seventh. Asked if European football was slipping away, Ranieri showed less fire as he answered: ""Perhaps. There are now a lot of clubs ahead of us."" ""For the moment, I'm still in the job and I want to think positive, fight and motivate my players,"" Ranieri said. ""After that, we will see."""
39,18/02/2018,17:43,Dante breaks duck and Nice losing streak,Nice captain Dante scored his first Ligue 1 goal for the club in a 1-1 draw with Claudio Ranieri's Nantes on Sunday to snap a four-match losing run.,"The result bumped Nantes back up to fifth, while Mario Balotelli's Nice -- who lost 3-2 to Lokomotiv Moscow in the Europa League on Thursday -- are ninth after halting their recent slide. Nantes goalkeeper Ciprian Tatarusanu had a busy and effective afternoon but Dante got a toe to a loose ball in a scramble to give last season's third-place finishers a fifth-minute lead at the Allianz Riviera. The 34-year-old Dante joined Nice from Wolfsburg in 2016 and this was his first strike for them in 55 league games. The equaliser for Ranieri's visitors came courtesy of an Emiliano Sala penalty on 27 minutes as the Argentine striker netted his 11th goal of the campaign. Atlantic coast outfit Nantes appointed Ranieri, who won the Premier League with Leicester, just ahead of the current campaign when Sergio Conceicao quit to join Porto. Runaway leaders PSG defeated Strasbourg 5-2 on Saturday, while second-placed Monaco thumped Dijon 4-0 on Friday with Marseille and Lyon both in action later Sunday."
40,28/11/2017,01:50,Ranieri set for Monaco reunion as PSG look to power on,"Claudio Ranieri admits he has ""fantastic memories"" of coaching Monaco as his Nantes side prepare to host the faltering reigning champions in a midweek round of games in Ligue 1.","The Italian was appointed by Monaco in 2012 and lasted two seasons in the principalty, winning Ligue 2 and leading them to promotion in his first campaign before taking them to second place on their return to Ligue 1. The disappointment of his departure was soon forgotten as he led Leicester City to their historic Premier League title triumph in 2016 before returning to the French game with Nantes in the summer. ""I have fantastic memories. We were Ligue 2 champions then second in Ligue 1. I often went to see them in the Champions League last year and their project has not changed,"" said the Italian, who still has a home in the principality. Monaco head to the Stade de la Beaujoire in need of a boost after a week which saw them eliminated from Europe following a 4-1 home defeat to RB Leipzig and then lose 2-1 at home to Paris Saint-Germain on Sunday. That result left Leonardo Jardim's side nine points behind the unbeaten leaders. ""We know it's very difficult against Paris,"" said Ranieri, whose team lost 4-1 at PSG recently. ""They (Monaco) are rebuilding after selling a lot of players. But I am convinced that they will fight for second place with Lyon and Marseille."" Nantes are currently fifth having lost three of their last four matches, while Lyon have moved above Monaco into second on a run of eight league games without defeat. Bruno Genesio's Lyon have won 5-0 in each of their last three away games and haven't conceded a league goal in nearly eight-and-a-half hours, and next up they host crisis club Lille, in the relegation zone and without a coach after Marcelo Bielsa was suspended by the club. Nobody can keep up with Neymar's PSG, who are still unbeaten this season and would have won by a far greater margin in Monaco if they had taken half the chances that fell their way. Coach Unai Emery may be tempted to rotate his squad for Wednesday's home meeting with Troyes and again at Strasbourg at the weekend with a Champions League trip to Bayern Munich to follow. The likes of Angel Di Maria, Javier Pastore, Thomas Meunier and Presnel Kimpembe can hope to get a run-out against Troyes, who sit in mid-table with the South Korean Suk Hyun-Jun impressing on loan from FC Porto. There will be a strange atmosphere at the Parc des Princes as the end of the stadium where the club's most boisterous fans gather will be closed. That is as a punishment for the use of flares during a match against Nice last month. Heavily criticised for his performances at the start of the season, Dutch winger Depay has found some stunning form in recent weeks to help a prolific Lyon side climb up to second in the table. The former Manchester United man, 23, scored twice in Sunday's 5-0 romp at Nice, as Lyon coped admirably in the absence of ill skipper Nabil Fekir and the injured Bertrand Traore. He has scored seven times in Lyon's last seven outings in all competitions and now has his sights set on struggling Lille. Fixtures (1800 GMT kick-offs unless stated)"
41,18/11/2017,19:42,Cavani kills Ranieri's Canaries,Edinson Cavani fired two goals past Claudio Ranieri's Nantes as Paris Saint-Germain went six points clear in Ligue 1 on Saturday with an eye-catching 4-1 win.,"With the Champions League visit of Celtic looming in midweek, PSG's Kylian Mbappe was rested but his replacement Javier Pastore scored one and made one, while Angel Di Maria fired home the other goal from a corner he had taken himself. The win puts PSG on 35 points from 13 games ahead of the defending champions Monaco on 29, with the sides to meet in a a table-top showdown on the south coast next weekend. ""We aren't thinking about Monaco, just about winning,"" Cavani said. The star of the show Saturday may have been Pastore but Cavani's brace lifted his goal tally to 15 league goals from 13 games, or 68 goals from 67 matches since Zlatan Ibrahimovic left for Manchester United. ""Very pleasing for a striker, but there's a long way to go and I want to carry on and get bigger and better match after match,"" Cavani said. Cavani timed his run onto Pastore's through ball perfectly before lashing a fierce shot low past 'keeper Ciprian Tatarusanu on 38 minutes for the opener. ""I gave him the ball and he scored the goal, that's the kind of player he is,"" Pastore said. Cavani's other strike was a tap-in late on after defenders watched in horror as the loose ball fell to the wrong man. In between Di Maris took a short corner which Marco Verratti returned to him before his searching left foot cross-shot crept in at the far corner to make it 2-0. Ranieri, the mastermind of Leicester City's Premier League title two seasons ago, brought on Pjejuce Nakoulma at 2-0 down and he pegged PSG back within three minutes to make it 2-1. But Parstore, fed by Verratti, lobbed the giant Romanian 'keeper, who got a hand to the ball only to see it drop over the line on 65 minutes. ""We were unlucky to lose 4-1, we played a good match. They are a huge team and you have to congratulate them,"" Ranieri said."

Nantes have picked up 23 points from a possible 30 following back-to-back defeats to start the campaign, and Ranieri is fairly relaxed ahead of the trip to the Parc des Princes. ""I'm going to take two buses,"" quipped Ranieri, as he mused how to stop a PSG attack that has plundered 39 goals in 12 matches. ""I know what's going to happen Saturday night. I want to see my team calm and really determined to play well. As for the result? I know we could lose,"" he said. ""I always have a precise idea (of how to play) against an opponent. The idea is always fantastic, but the reality is a bit different!"" ""Paris are going to win the championship. They've grown into a great team which is getting better all the time,"" he added. Brazilian superstar Neymar returns to domestic duty after a tumultuous fortnight with Brazil, cutting a fragile figure in the press conference that followed a 3-1 win over Japan in Lille last Friday. Though Neymar has scored 11 goals in 12 games since his world-record move to PSG from Barcelona, recent weeks have yielded stories of rifts with his team-mates and disagreements with coach Unai Emery. Brazil coach Tite spoke out in Neymar's defence last week as the striker wiped away tears, while Emery insisted there were no issues between himself and the player. ""None of these rumours are important. What counts are the discussions I have with him. We're very happy with him, he will triumph here,"" said Emery, whose side lead defending champions Monaco by four points. ""It's the same for all the players who change clubs, coaches, team-mates and cities. The adaptation process takes time,"" added the Spaniard. ""His team-mates, the staff and the club must do everything to help this process. He's getting better and better. It's what happens on the pitch that's most important. When the team gets results, things are good and everyone feels better."" Monaco face Amiens on Friday at the reopened Stade de la Licorne ahead of a crucial week that could spell the end of their Champions League campaign and heavily impact on their Ligue 1 title defence, with PSG heading to the principality next Sunday. Promoted Amiens were cleared to return to their home ground for the first time since a barrier collapse during the September 30 clash with Lille injured 29 people. The match with northern rivals Lille -- originally called off after just 16 minutes -- will be replayed on November 20. Nabil Fekir and in-form Lyon will chase a fifth straight league win away to Nice, while Marseille visit Bordeaux in the club's first match since terminating the contract of Patrice Evra. The former Manchester United star and France international left Marseille by mutual consent on November 10 after his infamous karate kick on one of Marseille's own fans. Saint-Etienne, who were thrashed 5-0 at home by fierce rivals Lyon last time out, are without a coach going into Friday's game with struggling Lille following the resignation of Oscar Garcia who stepped down on Wednesday after just five months at the helm.

43,12/06/2017,22:33,Ranieri set to join French club Nantes,"Nantes closed in on former Leicester City manager Claudio Ranieri on Monday after agreeing a two-year contract, but are awaiting French Professional League approval because of his age, a club source said.","The LFP does not allow coaches aged over 65 to join French clubs. Ranieri is 65 and the Ligue 1 outfit have requested a waiver from the LFP and are waiting for a response before finalising the deal. Lens went to the European Commission to push through the recruitment of Guy Roux in 2007, but Nantes do not intend to go that far and will comply with the LFP's decision. Ranieri was sacked by Leicester in February, just nine months after leading the English side to a stunning Premier League triumph. It was the first league title of the Italian's career, although he has won major cup trophies in both Spain and his home country. The news from France brings an end to speculation that Ranieri would stay in England, after he was heavily linked with both the vacant jobs at Crystal Palace and Leeds United. Former Nantes boss Sergio Conceicao left for Porto a week ago, after dragging the Canaries out of a relegation fight to a seventh-placed finish. The southern Brittany side won the last of their eight league titles in 2001."
44,05/03/2017,23:53,Mbappe torments Nantes to restore Monaco lead,Teenage sensation Kylian Mbappe punished Nantes with a first-half brace as Monaco strolled to a 4-0 victory on Sunday to rebuild their three-point cushion at the top of Ligue 1.,"Mbappe volleyed in the opener at the Stade Louis II with just four minutes gone and headed in his second in first-half stoppage time after Valere Germain had doubled Monaco's lead. Fabinho tucked away his sixth penalty of the season on 59 minutes to seal a fifth win in six outings for Monaco, who extended their unbeaten league run to 10 matches. Leonardo Jardim's free-flowing side are showing no sign of slowing down as a three-team title race looks poised to go down to the wire with Monaco chasing a first league crown since 2000. ""I continue to learn from the great players here and I am discovering all the time,"" said Mbappe. Radamel Falcao was left out the Monaco squad with muscle fatigue, but Bernardo Silva and Thomas Lemar returned to the line-up after coming off the bench in Wednesday's thrilling 4-3 extra-time victory at Marseille in the last 16 of the French Cup. Silva's weaving runs were immediately a threat to Nantes and Mbappe profited from a stroke of good luck to guide the ball beyond Maxime Dupe when a shot from the Portuguese international was deflected into his path. Brazilian left-back Lima forced a smart stop out of Monaco goalkeeper Danijel Subasic with a crisply-struck free-kick, but Nantes paid heavily for a pair defensive errors as the hosts killed off the game just before the interval. A poor clearing header allowed Kamil Glik to drill across goal, with Germain bringing the ball down on his chest and stabbing past Dupe for his ninth goal of the season. Silva then pinched possession back from Felipe Pardo inside the Nantes half and his curling cross was glanced in by Mbappe as the 18-year-old netted for the eighth time in his last seven appearances. Nantes compounded their problems when a rash challenge from Koffi Djidji on Lemar handed Monaco a penalty, with spot-kick specialist Fabinho converting for his seventh goal of the campaign. Mbappe had a chance to complete his hat-trick after a sublime first touch enabled him to spin away from the defence, but Dupe dived sharply to his right to palm the ball to safety. Both Mbappe and Silva were then replaced with Jardim already looking ahead to next Friday's clash at home to Bordeaux, as well as the return leg of their Champions League last 16 tie against Manchester City on March 15. Dimitri Payet struck with a clever improvised finish as Marseille recovered from last week's heavy defeat by arch rivals PSG by thrashing bottom side Lorient 4-1 in Brittany to move up to sixth place. Centre-back Rolando headed Marseille into a sixth-minute lead, while Payet grabbed the visitors' second midway through the first half. Florian Thauvin added a third on 53 minutes before Morgan Sanson turned home his first goal for the club since arriving from Montpellier in January, with Cameroon international Benjamin Moukandjo netting Lorient's consolation. Lille goalkeeper Vincent Enyeama saved a late Martin Braithwaite to earn his side a 1-1 draw at Toulouse after Yassine Benzia cancelled out Christopher Jullien's first-half strike for the home side. Reigning champions PSG and Nice both stayed in pursuit of Monaco following respective 1-0 wins over Nancy and Dijon on Saturday. Edinson Cavani scored his league-leading 27th goal from the spot as PSG laboured past Nancy at the Parc des Princes, while Wylan Cyprien's calm finish steered Nice to a vital win at Dijon."
45,17/05/2016,18:20,Girard keeping expectations in check at Nantes,"New Nantes coach Rene Girard said on Tuesday that his target at the club is just to bring them consistent top-10 finishes in Ligue 1, after taking over from Michel Der Zakarian.","The Canaries finished down in 14th place under Armenian-born Der Zakarian after a 4-0 thrashing at champions Paris Saint-Germain in their final match of the season on Saturday. Eight-time French champions Nantes have not won a major trophy since their last Ligue 1 title in 2001 and have not appeared in Europe in 14 years. Former Bordeaux midfielder Girard stunned French football in 2012 when he led his Montpellier side to an unlikely title triumph, but he insists that he has lower ambitions at the Stade de la Beaujoire. ""We have to work hard to move forward, to sustain the club in the top 10,"" he said in a press conference. ""There are two or three teams who are very strong financially. And there is a second set of clubs. I hope that we will be part of this pack behind the big three, that would be ideal."" Before his time in charge of Montpellier, Girard spent six years coaching France national youth teams, and he says he will stick with the young players already at his disposal at Nantes. ""I know there are good young players here. Some have played and showed their potential, so we will support them,"" he added. ""We won't go out and just buy new players for the sake of it."" Girard, 62, last coached Lille before being replaced by Herve Renard in 2015."
46,11/05/2016,10:48,Nantes appoint Girard as new coach,French Ligue 1 side Nantes on Wednesday named Rene Girard as their new coach on a two season deal.,"Girard, who guided Montpellier to a shock French title triumph four years ago, will replace Michel Der Zakarian, whose contract runs out at the end of the season. After leaving Montpellier in 2013, Girard coached Lille for two years. He is being tasked with pushing Nantes into the top half of the table, something they have not achieved since climbing back up to the top division three years ago. The Bretons are 12th in Ligue 1 with one match to play at runaway champions Paris Saint-Germain, leaving them scant hopes of improving their final position."
47,24/04/2016,17:19,Crisis-hit Marseille falter again at home,Struggling French giants Marseille saw their winless home run in Ligue 1 extended to 15 matches on Sunday after the 10-man hosts were held to a 1-1 draw by Nantes.,"Nicolas Nkoulou gifted Nantes a first-half lead when he headed a cross into his own net under little pressure, but Florian Thauvin, whose goal in midweek sent Marseille through to the French Cup final, grabbed an equaliser just after the break. However, Marseille's hopes of snapping a 10-match winless streak in the top flight suffered a damaging blow when Alaixys Romao was sent off on 55 minutes for kicking out at Yacine Bammou. And there was worse to come for OM as Abou Diaby, starting his second straight game after 18 months out through injury, hobbled off midway through the second half. ""There was a lack of rhythm in the first half and we started the game poorly. Then there was the goal which was a bit unlucky and that knocked down my players' confidence to a level even lower than it was at the start of the game against Sochaux,"" said OM interim coach Franck Passi. ""Since the start of the season quite a few things have gone against us, but the players never give up. Faced with adversity, to get back level and earn a point is important,"" he added, with OM six points above the relegation zone with three games left to play. Wednesday's 1-0 victory at Sochaux in the last four of the French Cup, which set up a showdown with bitter rivals Paris Saint-Germain next month, was one of the few positives for Marseille in a season which has lurched from bad to worse. Sunday's game at the Velodrome was played in front of fewer than 20,000 fans as Marseille served a partial stadium ban following crowd trouble during their 0-0 draw against Bordeaux a fortnight ago. Michy Batshuayi went close to scoring the opening goal on 29 minutes, but the Belgian striker's effort was tipped onto the post by Nantes goalkeeper Maxime Dupe. And just two minutes later Marseille fell behind in needless circumstances as a breakdown in communication between Nkoulou and goalkeeper Steve Mandanda resulted in the former diverting a cross into his own net. However, the home side responded on 49 minutes as Thauvin picked up the ball just inside the Nantes area, wriggling free past two defenders before calmly slotting past Dupe. But a moment of madness from Romao, who lashed out at Bammou, checked any momentum Marseille had been building and allowed Nantes, whose coach Michel Der Zakarian announced he will step down at the end of the season, to halt a four-game losing streak."
48,22/04/2016,02:35,Race for Europe enters home straight in France,The battle for European places in France's Ligue 1 is set to come down to the wire with just four matches of the season remaining and several teams still in the running.,"Monaco reclaimed second place from Lyon last weekend after a 2-1 win over Marseille, while Bruno Genesio's men slipped to third after being held 1-1 by fellow Champions League hopefuls Nice. Four straight wins have fired Saint-Etienne back into contention along with Lille, who were at one stage in a relegation scrap before reeling off six victories in succession. Rennes' charge has been slowed by back-to-back defeats but the Bretons still harbour realistic hopes of qualifying for the Europa League, although their challenge could peter out should they lose to Monaco on Sunday. ""There's a scent of Europe. I'm sure that everything is still possible. We're a bit behind our direct rivals (...) but a victory against Monaco would put us back in the mix,"" said Rennes goalkeeper Benoit Costil. Monaco, meanwhile, still must go to Lyon on the penultimate weekend of the season which could determine the destination of France's second automatic Champions League qualifying spot behind runaway title-winners Paris Saint-Germain. Last weekend's draw at Parc OL, in which Lyon played for over an hour with 10 men, snapped a five-game winning run at home for OL, who will aim to respond on Saturday at relegation-threatened Toulouse. The visitors will be without the suspended Maxwel Cornet, while time is running out for Toulouse with three points separating them from safety despite a mini-revival under Pascal Dupraz. Nice coach Claude Puel felt it was a case of two points lost at Lyon and said beating struggling Reims on Friday was imperative if they are to remain on course for Europe's premier club competition. ""The peak of our season is on Friday. If we're not good against Reims, it's not even worth talking about the other matches, whether it's those of our opponents or our own,"" said Puel, whose side also face fifth-place Saint-Etienne in week 37. Saint-Etienne, who are level on points with Nice, have based their recent success on an impenetrable defence and host Lorient on Sunday, while Lille won't face Angers until next Wednesday with Frederic Antonetti's side taking on PSG in the League Cup final at the Stade de France this weekend. Crisis-hit Marseille enjoyed a rare highlight in a disastrous season as they set up a showdown with bitter rivals PSG in next month's French Cup final following Wednesday's 1-0 victory at second-tier Sochaux. However, they remain just six points clear of the bottom three and will hope interim coach Franck Passi, who has stepped in after the dismissal of Michel, can finally bring about an end to their 14-game winless run at the Stade Velodrome against Nantes. Gazelec Ajaccio host Bastia in a Corsican derby given added importance in light of the top-flight newcomers' battle to avoid an immediate return to Ligue 2. Gazelec have won just once since the turn of the year and find themselves trailing 17th-place Reims by two points, with games against Lyon and PSG still to come. Fixtures (kick-off times GMT)"

In his second season in charge of Bordeaux, Sagnol is under pressure with his side languishing in the bottom half of the Ligue 1 table and leaking goals at an alarming rate in recent weeks."
50,04/03/2016,02:20,PSG focus on Chelsea ahead of Montpellier visit,Paris Saint-Germain head into Saturday's clash at home to a resurgent Montpellier with most eyes firmly fixated on next week's return leg at Chelsea in the last 16 of the Champions League.,"PSG rebounded from losing their 46-game unbeaten domestic run at Lyon last weekend by remaining on course to defend their French Cup crown after beating Saint-Etienne 3-1 in midweek. However, victory at the Stade Geoffroy-Guichard potentially came at a cost with midfielder Blaise Matuidi facing a race against time to be fit for Wednesday's trip to Stamford Bridge. The France international was seen clutching his hamstring after he was taken off ""as a precaution"" midway through the second half, with Laurent Blanc admitting he was ""worried"" about Matuidi's fitness. Blanc will have to decide whether or not to rest key players ahead of the Chelsea clash, with Marco Verratti (groin) and Angel Di Maria (thigh) also struggling with injuries. The PSG boss though was pleased with the manner in which the runaway Ligue 1 leaders responded at Saint-Etienne after suffering their first defeat of the season. ""We can't erase (the loss), but we can use it to our advantage. That's what we did (on Wednesday) and I'm very happy about it. It was a good way to respond after the defeat which provoked quite a buzz,"" said Blanc, in quotes published by French daily L'Equipe. ""Montpellier will be a difficult match because we'll be thinking about the game against Chelsea which will be huge,"" said PSG captain Thiago Silva, with 2012 French champions Montpellier arriving in the capital on the back of three straight wins to pull clear of relegation trouble. ""We're ready for Chelsea. I think everyone knows what awaits us over there. I hope (Matuidi) will be able to play because he's an important player for the team,"" the Brazilian added. Defeat at Lyon means Paris can't clinch a fourth straight French title this weekend, but they could do so next week should Monaco slip up at fellow European hopefuls Caen on Friday. Monaco have lost just once in 15 league outings and have an eight-point cushion over Caen, who trail third-place Lyon on goal difference, in the race for the second automatic Champions League qualifying berth. Four wins in five has reignited Lyon's campaign and Bruno Genesio's side will bid to build on recent momentum when Guingamp visit Parc OL in Sunday's late game. A four-match winless run has slowed Nice's European charge, but they will fancy their chances of ending that series at home to bottom side Troyes on Saturday. Rennes and Nantes, unbeaten in the league since November, meet in the Brittany derby with both sides also firmly in the hunt for Europe, while Saint-Etienne travel to slumping Angers. Pascal Dupraz will embark on the daunting task of trying to salvage Toulouse's top-flight status having replaced Dominique Arribage ahead of Sunday's trip to Marseille. Toulouse are 10 points from safety and without a win in eight, but there is hope as Marseille have struggled mightily at the Stade Velodrome with just two wins all season and none in their last 11 home fixtures.

51,28/02/2016,16:15,Nantes hold Monaco to extend unbeaten run,Nantes remain in contention for a surprise podium finish in Ligue 1 after holding second-placed Monaco to a 0-0 draw at the Stade de la Beaujoire on Sunday.,"In the process the Canaries, who had the best chances in the first half of a match played in bright sunshine, extended their long unbeaten run to 13 league games and 16 matches in all competitions. That has lifted Michel Der Zakarian's team provisionally up to sixth place, just one point behind Nice in third, and raised hopes among their fans of an unlikely Champions League qualification. Nantes are one of France's greatest clubs, but they have fallen on harder times since winning the last of their eight league titles in 2001. They have not finished in the top six in Ligue 1 since 2004 and have endured the ignominy of two relegations in the last decade, but they came into this fixture undefeated since a 1-0 reverse in Monaco in November. The home side had the best chances in a lively start to the game, but Kolbeinn Sigthorsson, on two occasions, and Emiliano Sala were unable to find a way past Danijel Subasic in the visitors' goal. Guido Carrillo came close for Monaco early in the second half while Alejandro Bedoya did have the ball in the net for Nantes in the 71st minute, only to be denied by the offside flag. While Monaco are nine points clear of the chasing pack in second spot, their failure to win the game means runaway leaders Paris Saint-Germain could secure an inevitable fourth consecutive title as early as next Saturday. For that to happen, Laurent Blanc's side must win away at Lyon later on Sunday and then hope Monaco slip up at Caen next Friday. PSG, who are unbeaten domestically since March last year, would then go into their home clash with Montpellier next Saturday knowing victory would suffice for them to be confirmed champions with two months of the season remaining. Elsewhere on Sunday, Marseille's match away to Gazelec Ajaccio was postponed due to the inclement weather in Corsica, but Saint-Etienne have the chance to go third when they entertain Caen. Nice's Champions League hopes were hit when they lost 2-0 at home to bitter rivals Bastia on Friday, while Rennes climbed up to fourth by coming from behind to win 2-1 at struggling Toulouse thanks to two late goals on Saturday. Toulouse parted company with coach Dominique Arribage after that defeat, which left them second from bottom and 10 points from safety."
52,26/02/2016,01:45,Lyon-PSG clash highlights gulf in France,Paris Saint-Germain can provide further proof of the growing gulf in class between the champions elect and the rest of Ligue 1 when they travel to last year's runners-up Lyon on Sunday.,"A fourth straight French league crown is well within sight for PSG, who could conceivably wrap up the championship next weekend, while Lyon's turbulent campaign has rendered last year's title challenge a distant memory. Laurent Blanc's runaway leaders are unbeaten in 36 matches in Ligue 1 dating back to last March, whereas Lyon have suffered 10 defeats -- three more than all of last season -- and find themselves embroiled in a congested scrap for Europe. PSG have beaten Lyon three times already this term, a crushing 5-1 win at the Parc des Princes in December was followed up by further triumphs in both domestic cup competitions, but OL will hope to maintain an unbeaten record in their new 60,000-seater fortress. Since moving into the Parc OL in January, Bruno Genesio's side have registered three wins out of four at home, with their lone dropped points coming in a 1-1 draw with Marseille. However, last Sunday's 1-0 defeat at Lille not only snapped a run of three successive victories but also left Lyon without midfielder Clement Grenier and former PSG defender Christophe Jallet for this weekend's clash after the pair were sent off to compound a miserable evening up north. ""We had the chance to go third and not only did we fail to do that, we also lost two players who will be suspended against Paris so we're paying a heavy price,"" said Genesio, whose side trail PSG by a staggering 34 points. ""That handicaps us even more against Paris, when that was the last thing we needed."" Monaco can take another stride towards claiming the second automatic Champions League berth when they travel to Nantes. Leonardo Jardim's side are eight points clear of Nice and Saint-Etienne, but will face an in-form Nantes outfit unbeaten in 15 matches in all competitions. ""We're very happy. There are still 11 games to go, and we have to hold on to second place,"" Monaco vice-president Vadim Vasilyev told RMC radio. ""The most important thing is always the league table. The goal is to be in the Champions League next season, it's vital."" Bastia fans will be banned from Friday's trip to third-place Nice after recent violence, which prompted last weekend's game at home to Nantes to be postponed. Fourth-place Saint-Etienne are at home to Caen on Sunday, while Marseille, with just two wins in 11 league outings, visit a Gazelec Ajaccio side chasing a first win in nine.

53,19/02/2016,02:20,Reims out to inflict European hangover on PSG,"Unbeaten runaway leaders Paris Saint-Germain return to Ligue 1 duty against struggling Reims on Saturday, four days after earning a narrow first-leg advantage over Chelsea in the Champions League last 16.","Edinson Cavani made an immediate impact as a substitute on Tuesday by netting a 78th-minute winner at the Parc des Princes after John Obi Mikel had cancelled out Zlatan Ibrahimovic's deflected free-kick to hand Laurent Blanc's side a 2-1 edge. The Uruguayan has started just twice in the league in 2016 after losing his place as a regular starter, but Cavani could well return to the line-up with Blanc preparing to rotate his side this weekend. Reims are one of the few teams to frustrate PSG this season, with the capital club needing another late goal from Cavani to rescue a point in a 1-1 draw back in September. ""Even if it's PSG, a big European team, we're not going there as victims. We always want to show what we're capable of doing against the big teams,"" said Reims defender Abdelhamid El Kaoutari. ""I think (the outcome) will depend on what Paris have to offer. If it's the PSG from Tuesday (against Chelsea), there are few teams who can stand up to them,"" added Reims coach Olivier Guegan, whose side enter the weekend two points above the drop zone. Paris on the other hand are unbeaten in 35 league games and cruising towards a fourth straight French title, with a mammoth 24-point gap separating themselves and nearest challengers Monaco, who are at home to bottom side Troyes this weekend. Lyon were in crisis mode less than a month ago, but three convincing wins in a row have propelled Bruno Genesio's side right back into contention for a top-three finish. OL travel to Lille on Sunday with the visitors trailing third-place Nice and bitter rivals Saint-Etienne by just a point in the race for France's final Champions League berth. ""It's the start of a run we have to continue with a couple of difficult matches coming up. We have to keep on working with the same spirit,"" said Genesio in the wake of last weekend's 4-1 demolition of Caen. Lyon will be without influential midfielder Corentin Tolisso for several weeks after he hurt his hamstring in training, but there was a welcome sight as Nabil Fekir, out since September with a knee injury, stepped up his road to recovery in midweek. Saint-Etienne secured a 3-2 victory at home to Basel in the last 32 of the Europa League on Thursday having thrown away a two-goal lead, with Christophe Galtier's men facing a quick turnaround as they head to Marseille this weekend. Early-season surprise packages Angers and Caen will bid to turn around their fading fortunes at home to Montpellier and Rennes respectively, with both sides losers of their last three matches. Toulouse, currently eight points from safety, can ill-afford another defeat as they risk being cut further adrift when they take on 18th-placed Gazelec Ajaccio.

France international Mathieu Debuchy made his Bordeaux debut following his loan move from Arsenal, while Uruguayan striker Diego Rolan was twice denied by fine saves from Lyon goalkeeper Anthony Lopes. Lyon climbed back into the top half of the table, above 10th-place Bordeaux on goal difference, and are six points adrift of the Champions League spots. Nice leapfrogged Angers into third as Hatem Ben Arfa grabbed his 11th goal of the campaign in a 1-0 win over Toulouse, while 10-man Angers were beaten 2-1 at Reims. Nantes extended their unbeaten streak to 10 matches following a 3-1 victory over Gazelec Ajaccio, Guingamp condemned lowly Troyes to a 4-0 defeat and Lille earned a 1-0 win over Caen. Runaway leaders Paris Saint-Germain can break Nantes' 20-year-old record unbeaten run in Ligue 1 later when they host Lorient. Laurent Blanc's side stretched their streak without a loss to 32 matches with Sunday's 2-0 victory at Saint-Etienne and can claim the top-flight record outright if they avoid defeat at the Parc des Princes. On Tuesday, Monaco tightened their grip on second place with a 2-0 win at home to Bastia, while 10-man Marseille claimed a 1-0 victory at Montpellier to push their unbeaten run in the league to 11 matches."

The decision, taken a day after Sunday's Rhone-Alpes derby between Saint-Etienne and Lyon for which travelling fans were also unable to attend, comes with France still under a state of emergency following the Paris terror attacks on November 13.

56,11/12/2015,20:15,"Drawing England 'could be fun', says Iceland's Sigthorsson",Iceland striker Kolbeinn Sigthorsson is hoping his nation find themselves in the same group as England when the draw for Euro 2016 is made in Paris on Saturday.,"The North Atlantic island nation of just 330,000 people caused a sensation by making it to a major tournament finals for the first time when they finished second in their qualifying group ahead of Turkey and the Netherlands. Under the management duo of former Sweden coach Lars Lagerback and Heimir Hallgrimsson, Iceland stunned Europe by defeating the Dutch home and away and beating Turkey 3-0 in Reykjavik. That performance came after they almost qualified for the 2014 World Cup, only losing out in a play-off against Croatia. ""It was a hard pool and we didn't expect that we could qualify, but we really hoped that we could keep the level we played in the qualification for the World Cup before, (where) we did well and we almost went to the final tournament,"" said Sigthorsson. The 25-year-old Nantes striker scored three times during the qualifying campaign, including the decider in a 2-1 home victory over group winners the Czech Republic. The star man, and top scorer in qualifying with five goals, was Gylfi Sigurdsson of Premier League side Swansea City, and there is much more depth to their squad now than in the past when former Chelsea and Barcelona forward Eidur Gudjohnsen stood out above all others. Sigthorsson, who moved to French football in the summer from Dutch giants Ajax, says investment in improved facilities and coaching in a country with an ill-suited climate has created the platform for current success. ""There are many aspects. A lot of facilities have changed in Iceland, a lot of artificial grass football fields have been built. It has been helping us a lot improving. We can now train in Iceland all year round,"" he said. ""Ten or 15 years ago, we had to train for nine or 10 months per year on sand fields. ""We are getting better coaches and if you look at the ideas Lars Lagerback brought in for us when he took charge four years ago, he changed a lot and I think he put a lot of new ideas into Icelandic football. I think that helps a lot."" Iceland are among the bottom seeds for Saturday's draw in Paris for the first 24-team finals, so they could find themselves in a group with holders Spain and 2012 finalists Italy, while England are another possible opponent. ""For me it doesn't really matter. It could be fun to have England. We haven't played against them,"" he said. ""The Icelandic people watch a lot of the Premier League, so I think it could be nice. And Spain, of course, is really good. So I would like to skip them."" Whoever they come up against, though, Sigthorsson believes Iceland can compete. ""We have a chance against every team. We just have to play our tactic and try to go in every game with the confidence that we can win. ""It's going to be a different experience for us to play in the final tournament, of course because it's the first time, but we want to do a good job there and qualify, for sure and try to get as far as possible."""

It will be the second time they wear the 'Je suis Paris' shirts after Wednesday's Champions League game against Malmo when they strolled into the last 16 with a 5-0 rout of their Group A rivals in Sweden. As well as the lack of away fans, security will be beefed up with spectators required to present identity papers and banned from carrying bags into the grounds with the security perimeter outside the Paris stadium extended. Similar security measures were also planned for Thursday's Europa League clash between Marseille and Dutch side Groningen in the Stade Vélodrome. The French football league (LFP) confirmed Thursday that the subsequent three rounds of Ligue 1 games and the next two rounds of Ligue 2 fixtures will be played without away fans with the ban to be extended to European Champions League and Europa League games playing in France until December 10. The decision was taken because of lack of available police with France in a state of emergency after the attacks, and with the COP21 climate change conference taking place in the French capital from November 30 to December 11. ""Given the current circumstances, the travel ban of supporters will be maintained, because of the rationalisation of security measures, as it is obvious that the police have other things to do now than accompany the fans,"" French Minister of State for Sports Thierry Braillard said. Travelling fans will not be able to attend games until December 18-20, the final weekend before the Christmas break. PSG will be overwhelming favourites to maintain their unbeaten Ligue 1 run against Troyes who by contrast have failed to win a game with just five points after 14 games. Troyes defender Jonathan Martins Pereira admitted the odds were stacked against the side from 150km southeast of Paris, not only because they will be without their fans. But he warned: ""Even if we only have a five-percent chance, we'll give it everything we have to try and pull off a shock. ""We'll go to Parc des Princes to stand up to Paris Saint-Germain. And why? There are so many surprises in football ... "" In the weekend's early match on Friday, Lyon, sitting second 13 points behind PSG, face Montpellier badly in need of a quick fix after being bundled out of the Champions League by Gent in midweek. The Belgian visitors' 2-1 win in the last European game to be played at the Stade de Gerland put an end to Lyon's hopes of reaching the last 16 in what has been a miserable continental campaign. Caen, equal on points with Lyon but behind on goal difference, travel to Bordeaux on Sunday looking to make up for last week's disappointing 0-0 draw at home against Angers, as Nice a point behind the Normandy side, travel to Toulouse on Saturday.

It will be the second time they wear the 'Je suis Paris' shirts after Wednesday's Champions League game against Malmo when they strolled into the last 16 with a 5-0 rout of their Group A rivals in Sweden. As well as the lack of away fans, security will be beefed up with spectators required to present identity papers and banned from carrying bags into the grounds with the security perimeter outside the Paris stadium extended. Similar security measures were also planned for Thursday's Europa League clash between Marseille and Dutch side Groningen in the Stade Vélodrome. The French football league (LFP) confirmed Thursday that the subsequent three rounds of Ligue 1 games and the next two rounds of Ligue 2 fixtures will be played without away fans with the ban to be extended to European Champions League and Europa League games playing in France until December 10. The decision was taken because of lack of available police with France in a state of emergency after the attacks, and with the COP21 climate change conference taking place in the French capital from November 30 to December 11. ""Given the current circumstances, the travel ban of supporters will be maintained, because of the rationalisation of security measures, as it is obvious that the police have other things to do now than accompany the fans,"" French Minister of State for Sports Thierry Braillard said. Travelling fans will not be able to attend games until December 18-20, the final weekend before the Christmas break. PSG will be overwhelming favourites to maintain their unbeaten Ligue 1 run against Troyes who by contrast have failed to win a game with just five points after 14 games. Troyes defender Jonathan Martins Pereira admitted the odds were stacked against the side from 150km southeast of Paris, not only because they will be without their fans. But he warned: ""Even if we only have a five-percent chance, we'll give it everything we have to try and pull off a shock. ""We'll go to Parc des Princes to stand up to Paris Saint-Germain. And why? There are so many surprises in football ... "" In the weekend's early match on Friday, Lyon, sitting second 13 points behind PSG, face Montpellier badly in need of a quick fix after being bundled out of the Champions League by Gent in midweek. The Belgian visitors' 2-1 win in the last European game to be played at the Stade de Gerland put an end to Lyon's hopes of reaching the last 16 in what has been a miserable continental campaign. Caen, equal on points with Lyon but behind on goal difference, travel to Bordeaux on Sunday looking to make up for last week's disappointing 0-0 draw at home against Angers, as Nice a point behind the Normandy side, travel to Toulouse on Saturday. Monaco, in sixth place, host fellow southerners Marseille on Sunday.

59,29/10/2015,02:15,Rennes betting on upset against dominant PSG,"Unbeaten Paris Saint-Germain will go 10 points clear at the top of Ligue 1, at least for 24 hours, with a win against Rennes in Brittany on Friday.","The capital club's imperial domestic form in recent times has raised the question of whether anyone can beat them in Ligue 1 this season ahead of a match brought forward to help Paris prepare for their trip to Real Madrid in the Champions League next week. Laurent Blanc's side were streets ahead of Saint-Etienne -- seen as contenders for a top-three finish -- in a 4-1 stroll at the Parc des Princes last Sunday. They are currently seven points clear of second-placed Angers and have gone 22 matches without losing in all competitions since being beaten by Barcelona in the Champions League quarter-finals last April. In Ligue 1, their unbeaten run covers 20 games going back to March, and few give Rennes, or anyone, a chance of ending that record right now. ""Against PSG, I get the impression that players from other teams go onto the pitch with a feeling of resignation,"" former Lyon, Paris and France goalkeeper Gregory Coupet told leading sports daily L'Equipe this week. ""For example, on Sunday for PSG v Saint-Etienne, we try to talk it up as a big match, but well...you could see that they were just trying to avoid getting hammered. ""It feels like when clubs face PSG they go into the game knowing already they won't get one point never mind three."" Rennes have gone six games without a league win, although a strong line-up secured a 1-0 victory at Bastia in the League Cup on Tuesday. ""They are superior to us in every area,"" said Rennes coach Philippe Montanier, although he remains hopeful of causing an upset. ""In one match everything is possible. If someone wants to become rich they should put a euro on us."" Javier Pastore, who missed the win over Saint-Etienne with conjunctivitis, could start for the visitors at Roazhon Park if Blanc decides to rest one of Angel Di Maria, Edinson Cavani or Zlatan Ibrahimovic. The Swede, who continues to be linked with a move to MLS when his contract expires at the end of the season, has scored seven goals in his last five league games. David Luiz, who has had a knee injury, might not feature while goalkeeper Benoit Costil could return for Rennes after being injured on international duty for France last month. Angers are in action on Sunday away to Monaco, who are unbeaten in seven games and beginning to look like the side that finished third last season. Caen, currently in third, visit struggling Bastia on Saturday, while Lyon are away at winless bottom side Troyes as they seek a confidence-boosting win ahead of a crucial Champions League clash against Zenit St Petersburg. Saint-Etienne are at home to Reims as they look to bounce back from a punishing trip to Paris, and Marseille travel to Nantes on Sunday evening. Before that, Nice will seek to get back on track after a shock loss to struggling Gazelec Ajaccio when they face Lille on the Cote d'Azur. Claude Puel's side had scored 17 goals in recording four straight wins prior to that, inspired by the superb form of Hatem Ben Arfa, who is now being linked with a France recall. ""I am not going to question Hatem's quality and his talent,"" France coach Didier Deschamps told Eurosport as he refused to rule out naming the mercurial playmaker for next month's friendly matches against Germany and England. ""Why not? I will think about it based on what he has done with Nice,"" added Deschamps of Ben Arfa, who has had a chequered career but has scored seven Ligue 1 goals this season.

60,26/09/2015,19:47,PSG overcome poor start to stroll past Nantes,Paris Saint-Germain recovered from a sluggish start at Nantes on Saturday as they came from behind to record a 4-1 victory that provisionally stretched their lead to four points at the top of Ligue 1.,"Yacine Bammou had nodded Nantes into an 11th-minute lead at the Stade de la Beaujoire but Zlatan Ibrahimovic equalised for the reigning champions just after half-time. Edinson Cavani then came off the bench to notch his league-leading sixth goal of the season as PSG went ahead on 73 minutes before Angel Di Maria added a third with Serge Aurier also getting on the scoresheet. Laurent Blanc stuck with his rotation policy, ahead of week's trip to Ukraine to face Shakhtar Donetsk in the Champions League, as Cavani, Blaise Matuidi, Thiago Motta and Maxwell were all left out of the starting line-up. PSG had recorded seven straight victories against Nantes in the league but the visitors fell behind early on Saturday after Javier Pastore was dispossessed just outside own area and Valentin Rongier's cross was expertly converted by Bammou. PSG rode their luck and were fortunate not to concede a second just a few minutes later as Bammou nipped in ahead of Thiago Silva to connect with Alejandro Bedoya's near-post delivery only for his header to come back off the post. Nantes had scored just twice in six matches prior to the weekend but were creating plenty of chances as Jules Iloki then scuffed wide with just Kevin Trapp to beat after being played in by Rongier. Having failed to capitalise on several openings Nantes were pegged back on 48 minutes as Pastore played a floated ball into the area, and although Di Maria's volley was cleared off the line, Ibrahimovic was on hand to bundle in the rebound to draw to within one goal of Pauleta's club record of 109. Blanc introduced Cavani for Lucas Moura just past the hour and the Uruguayan made an immediate impact as he rose to flick in a Di Maria free-kick at the near post to give PSG the lead. Di Maria then netted his second goal in as many matches after racing onto Pastore's ball over the top and lobbing onrushing Nantes 'keeper Remy Riou. There was time for Aurier, back from suspension, to add further gloss to the scoreline on 90 minutes as the Ivorian acrobatically volleyed in a Pastore corner. Later, Lyon go to a Bordeaux side still licking their wounds following a midweek 6-1 thrashing at Nice, while fourth-placed Rennes take on winless Troyes. Saint-Etienne will aim to trim PSG's lead back to a single point on Sunday when they host Nice with Marseille, hit with a partial stadium ban following last week's crowd trouble, taking on Angers and Monaco going to Guingamp. David N'Gog struck the only goal for Reims in a 1-0 win on Friday that lifted them to third."
61,16/05/2014,02:22,"Football: Quest for Europe, to avoid drop climaxes in France",The curtain falls on the Ligue 1 season this Saturday but the stage is set for a thrilling final weekend in France with European places and the fight against relegation still to be settled.,"Lille have stuttered down the stretch allowing Saint-Etienne, unbeaten in eight matches, to claw to within just two points of the third and final Champions League spot. Rene Girard's side need a victory at Lorient to assure themselves of a place in next season's third qualifying round, but anything less would open the door for Saint-Etienne, who host rock-bottom Ajaccio, to pip them at the post. ""We know what we have to do Saturday to finish in third, a position we've occupied for a large part of the season,"" said Girard. ""In the event that we miss out on third, we could talk about disappointment, but not failure, because don't forget that at the start of the season we weren't forecasted to finish this high."" Saint-Etienne must beat Ajaccio and hope Lille slip up if they're to clinch their highest finish since ending the 1981/92 season as runners-up. ""The prospect of finishing in third place is a source of extra motivation. The stadium will be full, and the crowd will be our 12th man. We want to make sure we win so that there can be no regrets when we find out how Lille do away to Lorient,"" said striker Mevlut Erding, who leads Les Verts with 11 goals this campaign. Meanwhile, successive defeats for Lyon has paved the way for Marseille to potentially snatch fifth place and a berth in the Europa League qualifying rounds. Remi Garde will take charge of Lyon for the final time in Nice having opted not to renew his expiring contract due to ""family and personal reasons"", while Marseille host Guingamp needing to better Lyon's result to leapfrog OL. Jose Anigo is also on his way out at the Stade Velodrome with Marcelo Bielsa to take over at Marseille next season, and the outgoing OM boss wants to bow out on a high note. ""We don't have our destiny in our hands but hopefully our friends at Nice will get a result against Lyon,"" said Anigo. ""We're at home and we'll try to finish with a flourish. If we can do that it'll be very nice for everyone."" Sochaux and Evian meet at the Stade Bonal in a straight shootout to avoid relegation. 17th-placed Evian are one point above their rivals but Sochaux are unbeaten in seven matches and have turned their home ground into a fortress of late, taking 20 points from a possible 24. ""We have no choice but to win,"" said Sochaux coach Herve Renard. ""If we keep playing like we have in the last few games, we can make it. ""If we are not able to do it here, then it will mean that we don't deserve to stay in the top division,"" added the former Zambia manager. Despite the tricky trip awaiting his players Evian boss Pascal Dupraz sounded confident of survival. ""Don't forget that we're one point clear. ""You don't know the history of our club. I do. I know what we're made of. I know we'll do it,"" said Dupraz. Elsewhere, champions Paris Saint-Germain can establish a new record for most wins in a season should they beat Montpellier. Laurent Blanc is expected to rest several of his World Cup-bound stars as PSG go in search of win number 27, which would surpass the previous mark held by Reims, Monaco and Nantes. The Claudio Ranieri era at Monaco is likely to draw to a close when the principality side host Bordeaux with Sporting Lisbon coach Leonardo Jardim hotly-tipped to replace the Italian at the Stade Louis II.

62,15/05/2014,03:04,Football: France guided by 'lucky star' Deschamps,"Didier Deschamps has had luck on his side throughout his career, and the France boss will be hoping that a kind World Cup draw can set Les Bleus up for a successful campaign in Brazil.","When the draw for the finals was made back in December, French media rejoiced after seeing their team thrown in with Honduras, Switzerland and Ecuador in Group E, quite an escape given that Les Bleus were not among the top seeds. ""The day that luck was handed out, Didier Deschamps was there in the front row"", remarked sports daily L'Equipe, adding that the 45-year-old Basque-born coach was accompanied by a ""lucky star which watches over him"". France great Michel Platini, these days the president of UEFA, once said that Deschamps ""must have been blessed with holy water when he was born"", although he has a lot more going for him than just that. Schooled at Nantes under the legendary coach Jean-Claude Suaudeau, 'DD' was part of the France side that famously suffered a gut-wrenching last-gasp loss to Bulgaria to miss out on qualifying for the 1994 World Cup in the United States. That defeat marked a generation, with the exception of Deschamps, who recovered from the heartache to lift the World Cup at the Stade de France in 1998 and also captained the side that won the European Championship two years later. Seventeen years on from that he coached Marseille to the Ligue 1 title, while his coaching CV also includes a Champions League final appearance with Monaco in 2004. Deschamps clearly knows what he is doing, but his time in charge of Les Bleus has been a trying one, with just nine wins to his name in 19 games in charge. After being appointed as successor to former international team-mate Laurent Blanc in 2012, Deschamps said that ""it would make no sense to carry on"" as coach if France failed to qualify for the World Cup in Brazil. They made it, if only just, finishing second in their qualifying group behind reigning world and European champions Spain and then beating Ukraine in a play-off, overcoming a 2-0 first-leg defeat in Kiev by producing a stirring display to win 3-0 in the return at the Stade de France. ""I have lived through some great moments in my long career,"" said the 45-year-old after that victory. ""To take France to a World Cup is fabulous, especially after the first leg, where the result was not favourable."" Deschamps was thrown into the air by his players in the centre-circle of the Stade de France at the end of that game, just as he was at the end of the 1998 World Cup final win against Brazil. Nobody is even contemplating a repeat of that triumph this time around, but a run to the quarter-finals would be considered a success as the coach looks to build a team capable of winning Euro 2016 on home soil."
63,10/05/2014,23:49,Football: PSG crush Lille to break Ligue 1 points record,Champions Paris Saint Germain achieved a new Ligue 1 points record on Saturday with a 3-1 win over 10-man Lille to ensure the race for Europe in France goes down to the wire.,"Laurent Blanc's side now have 86 points to overtake Lyon's all-time record of 84 in 2006, in a tie which was overshadowed by PSG's France midfielder Yohan Cabaye suffering a right ankle injury. European places will now be allocated on the final day of the season next Saturday with Champions League and Europa League berths still up for grabs. PSG's goals came through Brazilians Marquinhos (41) and Lucas (66) and Blaise Mathuidi (83) with the titleholders bidding to close out their season on a further high at home against Montpellier next weekend. Cabaye picked up the injury late in the first half after a tackle for which Lille's France international midfielder Marvin Martin was given his marching orders. The 28-year-old was stretchered off and taken to hospital immediately for a scan, which Blanc later said had not revealed anything serious. ""The ankle is very swollen, but obviously it was more fear than harm,"" said Blanc. ""I didn't see it but yes I was scared. Obviously he must have been thinking of the World Cup."" Minutes later, Brazilian defender Marquinhos broke the deadlock with a header, with Zlatan Ibrahimovic, playing for the first time in a month, missing a chance to give the visitors a two-goal advantage just before the break. Lucas got the second after 65 minutes as he picked up a cross from Argentine teammate Javier Pastore, with the Brazilian also setting up the third as Matuidi gave the Lille defence the slip behind Ibrahimovic. Midfielder Jonathan Delaplace got one back for the hosts in extra time, but it was too little too late as third-placed Lille are just two points ahead of Saint Etienne, 3-1 winners at Nantes, thanks to a Mevlut Erding double. Lyon were the big losers of the weekend as they could miss out on an 18th straight Champions League spot after losing 1-0 at home to Lorient. Lyon were reduced to ten men after just 14 minutes when Mouhamadou Dabo was red-carded, with Cheick Doukoure giving the Brittany side the only goal after 53 minutes. Lyon are fifth, just one point ahead of Marseille who shared the spoils 1-1 at Bordeaux, and could grab the final Europa League berth. Nothing is decided yet at the bottom of the table, either, although French Cup winners Guingamp secured their top flight place next season with a 2-0 win at home against Toulouse. The final Ligue 1 ticket will be decided in a winner-takes-all tie between Sochaux and Evian on Saturday after both won their ties. Sochaux won 2-1 at Rennes and Evian beat Nice 2-0."
64,09/05/2014,02:25,Football: Lille look to clinch Champions League place,Lille will hope to extend Paris Saint-Germain's recent run of poor form and beat the newly-crowned champions to clinch a potentially lucrative prize of their own this weekend.,"The northern side have been in the top three in Ligue 1 since the start of October but need a win at home to the capital club to make sure of a podium finish and seal qualification for next season's Champions League. The gap down to Saint-Etienne in fourth is five points, but a Lille slip-up coupled with a win for Les Verts away to Nantes will take the battle for France's last Champions League spot down to the final round of games. Nevertheless, while PSG have reigned supreme over French football this season, they have gone off the boil since being knocked out of the Champions League by Chelsea last month and have taken just four points from their last four games. On Wednesday, they were confirmed as champions just before going down to a 2-1 defeat at home to Rennes, while Lille are France's form team at the moment, on a run of 13 games without defeat. ""I don't know what frame of mind PSG will be in on Saturday,"" admitted Lille coach Rene Girard. ""Will Laurent Blanc rotate his squad? Is it a good or a bad thing that they have already won the title? Maybe some players will already be thinking about the World Cup. ""But they remain a squad full of great players, so we must just worry about ourselves and take the points we need to be sure of taking third place."" PSG coach Blanc, who on Thursday extended his contract by an extra year through to 2016, has refused to criticise his team for their poor performances in recent weeks but has urged them to go on and set a new record for the most points in a Ligue 1 season. With two games to go, Paris are only one point away from equalling Lyon's all-time record tally of 84, set in 2006, and Blanc said: ""I think this team deserves to be in the record books, but to do that we will need to get points against Lille and Montpellier."" Saint-Etienne are guaranteed Europa League football next season but two wins from their last two games would see them snatch a Champions League place if Lille took no more than one point themselves. However, Saint-Etienne coach Christophe Galtier is more interested in making sure that his side finish above great rivals Lyon, something Les Verts have not achieved since 1993. ""Lille haven't collapsed so far and I don't see why it would happen now,"" said Galtier ahead of the visit to mid-table Nantes. ""I only want us to focus on ourselves. Our main objective is to secure fourth place."" Marseille could still pip Lyon to the final Europa League berth after winning last weekend's meeting of the clubs to move to within two points of Remi Garde's side. Lyon are at home to Lorient on Saturday while Marseille go to Bordeaux in what will be Jose Anigo's penultimate game as interim coach before Marcelo Bielsa takes over at the Stade Velodrome in the summer. At the bottom, the battle to avoid joining Valenciennes and Ajaccio in being relegated to the second tier is intensifying, with Sochaux a point adrift of safety but in fine form. Herve Renard's side are unbeaten in their last six matches and travel to Rennes, who are now safe after surprisingly beating PSG in midweek. Evian, in 17th, are at home to Nice before travelling to Sochaux on the final day of the season, while French Cup winners Guingamp, two points above the drop zone, entertain Toulouse knowing a victory will confirm their safety."
65,25/04/2014,02:29,Football: PSG on brink of second straight Ligue 1 crown,Paris Saint-Germain can wrap up their second straight Ligue 1 title this weekend as relegation-threated Sochaux provide what could be their final obstacle on Sunday.,"A 10-point lead, following a sparkling domestic campaign which has seen Laurent Blanc's side suffer just two defeats, means the title is theirs with a lunch-time win away to Sochaux or 24 hours earlier if Monaco lose at relegated Ajaccio. Herve Renard, the flamboyant Sochaux coach who memorably led Zambia to their first African championship in 2012, has worked miracles to lift his men within three points of safety after taking over in mid-season. The Frenchman would ideally hope PSG arrive at the Stade Auguste Bonal with the title wrapped up and in relaxed mood to face his players, who he told recently to ""never give up"" in their remarkable bid to avoid the drop. While PSG's season was severely damaged by their Champions League quarter-final exit against Chelsea, a 2-1 victory in the League Cup final last weekend over Lyon and a laboured 1-0 midweek win over Evian has helped lift the gloom of another failed European campaign. Blanc was hardly satisfied by the form of his players on Wednesday and is just eager to tie up the title race before deciding on his own future for next season. ""It wasn't our best match of course but we got the job done,"" said Blanc, following Blaise Matuidi's late winner against Evian. ""We have to improve (against Sochaux) or we'll have the same problems and it's up to the players and staff to think about this. ""Nothing is ever accomplished in football if you don't put in the necessary ingredients,"" continued the former Bordeaux and France coach. ""I have told the players that the title isn't won yet and we're still missing that final little effort but nothing is ever easy. While few, if any, believe PSG can self-destruct from their position of power, a celebration has already been planned for the final day of the season on May 18 when Montpellier come to the capital's cauldron. After the ugly scenes of violence and hooliganism that marred their trophy celebration last year, it has already decided there will be no party in the streets of Paris this time around. Elsewhere, Lille have a stranglehold on third spot and carry a seven point advantage to Bordeaux, while their closest pursuers Saint-Etienne cling to a Europa League spot by just two points over bitter rivals Lyon. Saint-Etienne are on the road at Evian on Saturday while Lyon, who were held 0-0 by Toulouse in midweek, host Bastia at their Stade Gerland 24 hours later. French Cup finalists Guingamp have been sucked into a relegation dogfight and host an equally desperate Valenciennes outfit in a massive match to keep surging Sochaux at bay. The Brittany club are just two points above Renard's side while Valenciennes are a further four adrift. Nantes host Marseille in the only match on Friday while Lorient make the short trip to Rennes, Montpellier host Toulouse and Reims head south to Nice in the other Saturday fixtures.

66,04/04/2014,02:26,Football: PSG look for Cavani to step forward in Ibra absence,Ligue 1 leaders Paris Saint-Germain will hope that record signing Edinson Cavani can fill the void left by the absence of injured top scorer Zlatan Ibrahimovic as they prepare to host Reims on Saturday.,"The meeting with the club from the Champagne country comes in between the two legs of the Champions League quarter-final against Chelsea, with Laurent Blanc's side leading 3-1 ahead of Tuesday's return at Stamford Bridge. And given that the capital club sit 13 points clear of nearest challengers Monaco at the top of the table with just seven games left, Blanc is bound to give a rest to some of his key players with Chelsea in mind. One man who will definitely miss the game is Ibrahimovic, who is set for a spell on the sidelines after coming off in the second half against Chelsea with an injury to the back of his right thigh. ""I just hope he comes back quickly because we will need him,"" admitted Blanc of the Swede, who has scored a club record 40 goals in all competitions so far this season. However, one man who stands to benefit from Ibrahimovic's misfortune is Cavani, the Uruguayan who cost 64 million euros (£52.9m, $87.7m) from Napoli last summer. Cavani has scored 21 goals altogether in his debut season in France, but he has only three in an injury-hit 2014 and earlier this week he admitted his displeasure at having to play on the wing in a 4-3-3 formation. ""For a striker who is used to finishing chances, having to fulfil other tasks is not easy,"" he told sports daily L'Equipe, before adding: ""There are things that I need to talk about with the club, things that need to be done differently."" Paris are on a club record-breaking run of 10 consecutive wins in all competitions and have not lost at home in the league since November 2012, so it would be a huge shock if they failed to record a positive result this weekend. Opponents Reims have twice reached the European Cup final themselves, including in the first ever final in 1956, when they were beaten 4-3 by Real Madrid at the Parc des Princes. These days their aims are rather more modest, but they are enjoying an excellent season under coach Hubert Fournier and come into the weekend just a point behind Marseille in sixth. ""It will be difficult, we can't hide that. But we are going to the Parc to get a result,"" insisted Reims' Cape Verde winger Odair Fortes. Elsewhere, second-placed Monaco will look to bounce back from a shock defeat at Evian last weekend when they host Nantes on Sunday, with the principality club's coach Claudio Ranieri sweating on the fitness of Layvin Kurzawa, Joao Moutinho and James Rodriguez. Lille are just six points behind Monaco in third but they face a tricky test at Toulouse, whose five-game unbeaten run means that a top-five finish, and possible European qualification, is not out of the question. ""Europe is not a taboo word for us and it's great that the players are talking about it,"" said Toulouse coach Alain Casanova last week. ""But talking about it and actually going out and doing it are two different things."" The south-western side are poor at home, though, having won just one of their last eight games in front of their own fans. Fresh from winning last week's Rhone derby at Lyon, Saint-Etienne in fourth continue their push for a podium finish and a Champions League berth when they host Nice, while Lyon go to struggling Valenciennes in between the two legs of their Europa League quarter-final against Juventus. Meanwhile, Lorient entertain Evian amid ongoing uncertainty about the future of their long-serving coach Christian Gourcuff, who has been linked with a move to take over the Algerian national team."
67,30/03/2014,23:00,Football: Ivorians star for Lille and St. Etienne,Ivory Coast international Salomon Kalou grabbed an injury time winner for Lille in Ligue 1 action on Sunday while his compatriot Max Gradel was the hero in Saint-Etienne's 2-1 derby win at arch rivals Lyon.,"Lille had earlier tightened their grip on third place with a dramatic 1-0 over Guingamp when Kalou came off the bench to prod the ball home in the 92nd minute to snatch three desperately needed points for Rene Girard's side. But in the weekend's final match, Gradel scored with 16 minutes left to keep Saint-Etienne three points behind Lille, and the final Champions League berth, with seven matches left. In a tense Rhone derby at Lyon, Turkish international Mevlut Erding scrambled home a right wing cross in the 28th minute to put Saint-Etienne in front. However Lyon responded 11 minutes later when Bafetimbi Gomis laid on a pinpoint cross from the wing which Alexandre Lacazette skillfully volleyed home to level the match at 1-1. It was the 22-year-old Frenchman's 14th goal of the season, drawing him level with Paris Saint-Germain's Edinson Cavani as the second top scorer in Ligue 1 behind PSG's Swedish talisman Zlatan Ibrahimovic who rests on 25. It was then down to Ivory Coast striker Gradel to steal the headlines, as the former Leicester City, Bournemouth and Leeds United player, plucked the winner with a quarter hour to play. Earlier at Lille, the match appeared to be heading for a goalless draw before Kalou popped up inside the six yard box to knee the ball home following a corner from the right that led to a scramble. ""We came out of that one very, very well,"" said a delighted Girard. ""We're still in third so where is the problem? I think that many teams in France would like to be in third place even if we've struggled of late and have been missing efficiency,"" he added. ""We've got some complicated matches coming up so we'll just have to see. I was sorry to see some of the players whistled (by Lille fans) but we're not going to place too much importance on that. It was the public, it was not supporters."" continued Girard. In the only other match on Sunday, Rennes made it back-to-back league wins with a confident 3-0 home success against Bastia that moved them eight points clear of the drop zone. It was the first time this season that the Brittany outfit had picked up three straight victories following their French Cup quarter-final success over Lille on Thursday. They will now play second division Angers for a place in the Stade de France final against either Monaco or Guingamp. ""It's been a beautiful week, with three wins in three matches without conceding a goal,"" said Rennes coach Philippe Montanier. ""It boosts morale after the many difficult weeks. ""It's a week which has put us on the right track. We took another step towards staying in the top flight, and the perspective of a French Cup semi-final has spiced up our season."" The Corsican outfit remain in 10th position. Monaco suffered a surprise 1-0 defeat away to Evian on Saturday to leave PSG well on track for a second straight French title. Laurent Blanc's PSG side warmed up for their Champions League showdown against Chelsea on Wednesday with a 1-0 win over Nice on Friday. Elsewhere on Saturday, Odair Fortes scored to earn Reims a 1-1 draw at home to Lorient, after Vincent Aboubakar netted a first-half penalty, while there were goalless stalemates between Montpellier and Valenciennes and Nantes and Bordeaux. Marseille scored in the dying minutes to salvage a 1-1 draw at relegation-threatened Sochaux while Ajaccio and Toulouse battled to a 2-2 draw in Corsica."
68,30/03/2014,19:01,Football: Kalou rescues Lille with injury time winner,Lille tightened their grip on third place in Ligue 1 with a dramatic 1-0 injury time victory over Guingamp on Sunday.,"Ivory Coast international Salomon Kalou came off the bench to prod the ball home in the 92nd minute to snatch three desperately needed points for Rene Girard's side. The match appeared to be heading for a goalless draw before Kalou popped up inside the six yard box to knee the ball home following a corner from the right that led to a scramble. The win extends Lille's advantage to six points over fourth placed Saint-Etienne who are involved in the Rhone derby at Lyon in the weekend's final match later on Sunday. Lyon are alone in fifth spot and nine points adrift of Lille and the all important final Champions League berth for next season. Earlier, Rennes made it back-to-back league wins with a confident 3-0 home success against Bastia that moved them eight points clear of the drop zone. It was the first time this season that the Brittany outfit had picked up three straight victories following their French Cup quarter-final success over Lille on Thursday. They will now play second division Angers for a place in the Stade de France final against either Monaco or Guingamp. ""It's been a beautiful week, with three wins in three matches without conceding a goal,"" said Rennes coach Philippe Montanier. ""It boosts morale after the many difficult weeks. ""It's a week which has put us on the right track. We took another step towards staying in the top flight, and the perspective of a French Cup semi-final has spiced up our season."" The hosts dominated from the outset with Romain Alessandrini opening the scoring after 14 minutes and Swedish striker Ola Toivonen doubling their advantage on 28 minutes. Cameroonian midfielder Jean Makoun rounded off the scoring after 59 minutes. The victory lifts Rennes up to 12th position and eight points above the relegation zone with seven matches to play. The Corsican outfit remain in 10th position. Monaco suffered a surprise 1-0 defeat away to Evian on Saturday to leave Paris Saint-Germain 13 points clear at the top of the Ligue 1 table with just seven games left. Toulouse missed the opportunity to leapfrog Marseille into the top six as they were held to a 2-2 draw by Ajaccio in Corsica. The visitors had fallen two goals behind as Ricardo Faty and Gadji Tallo netted for Ajaccio, but Issiaga Sylla pulled one back before Clement Chantome, the on-loan PSG midfielder, equalised. But Toulouse missed a great chance to win the game when Jonathan Zebina saw a stoppage-time penalty saved by Guillermo Ochoa in the home goal. Elsewhere on Saturday, Odair Fortes scored to earn Reims a 1-1 draw at home to Lorient, for whom Vincent Aboubakar netted a first-half penalty, while there were goalless stalemates between Montpellier and Valenciennes and Nantes and Bordeaux. On Friday, champions PSG took another step towards retaining their title and warmed up for next Wednesday's Champions League quarter-final first leg at home to Chelsea by winning 1-0 at Nice."

Lyon and St-Etienne are Lille's main rivals for Champions League qualification. Rene Girard's Lille were devoid of any real attacking menace and were booed by their home supporters. ""I'm disappointed,"" said Girard. ""We were very average. We were beaten in the one on ones, we lacked rhythm, it was a non-match."" Later Saturday Sochaux beat Lortient 2-0 in a result that confirmed their recent good form which has seen them harvest 10 points from their last five games. It left them five points above the relegation zone. Elsewhere, third from bottom Evian lost 1-0 at home to Valenciennes, Nice beat Bastia 2-0, Guingamp defeated bottom side Ajaccio 2-1 and Toulouse edged Rennes 3-2. Friday's lone fixture saw Marseille held 1-1 at Reims in a result that did neither side's European qualification aspirations any good. Antoine Devaux gave the hosts the lead midway through the second period when he headed home a cross from full-back Franck Signorino. But the 1993 European champions earned a deserved equaliser 10 minutes from time when France forward Andre-Pierre Gignac tapped home at the back post after Reims goalkeeper Kossi Agassa missed a cross from Rod Fanni. ""It's no doubt the lack of clinical finishing that cost us victory,"" said Marseille coach Jose Anigo. On Sunday, PSG, having sealed their place in the quarter-finals of the Champions League in midweek, will hope to get the better of bogey team Saint-Etienne. Blanc's side are unbeaten in 12 league games and come into the weekend eight points clear of nearest challengers Monaco at the top of the table. Les Verts, European Cup runners-up in 1976, have a good recent record against PSG, although they did squander a two-goal lead in a 2-2 draw at the Stade Geoffroy-Guichard in October and lost in extra time in Paris in the League Cup in December."

71,14/02/2014,02:25,Football: Challengers Monaco face stiff test in Corsica,Monaco's challenge at the top of Ligue 1 faces a stiff examination on Saturday when they cross the Mediterranean to take on SC Bastia in Corsica.,"The principality club came from behind to hold leaders Paris Saint-Germain to a 1-1 draw last weekend and stay within five points of top spot, with coach Claudio Ranieri later promising: ""If PSG lose games and lose the title then we'll be there."" The Italian then saw his side triumph 1-0 after extra-time away to Cote d'Azur rivals Nice in the French Cup last 16 on Wednesday as recent signing Dimitar Berbatov got his first goal for the club. That success was achieved despite Ranieri making sweeping changes to his line-up, but now the likes of Eric Abidal, Joao Moutinho and James Rodriguez are set to return to the side. ""I rotated the squad a lot at Nice because Monaco have to play three big games this week,"" said Ranieri, before lauding the contribution of his Bulgarian recruit, who appeared as a second-half substitute. ""Berbatov got the goal. I asked him to play in between the lines and he did that well."" Bastia, meanwhile, have had a great week. After failed to register an away win all season, they ran out 3-1 victors at Toulouse in a rearranged game on Tuesday that was notable for Djibril Cisse's first goal since returning to French football last month. ""Djibril put in a courageous performance. It was important for him to score,"" admitted Bastia coach Frederic Hantz, who is hoping the 32-year-old former Marseille striker can score enough goals to stake a late claim for a place in France's World Cup squad. ""We need to be careful with him and not go too quickly, so that he is in top form by March, April, May. If we do that we can help him achieve his (World Cup) objective."" Bastia then claimed another away win on Wednesday when the French League (LFP) confirmed that their 2-0 opening-day defeat at Nantes had been overturned because Les Canaris fielded an ineligible player. Hantz's side therefore now have European qualification in their sights, and they will be hopeful of claiming another positive result at Furiani, where only Lyon have taken three points this season. They are without goalkeeper Mickael Landreau due to a calf injury though, and Monaco are defending an unbeaten record in 2014. Nevertheless, they have managed just two wins in their last six league games and could find themselves eight points off top spot come kick-off. Before facing Bayer Leverkusen in Germany in the first leg of their Champions League last 16 tie next Tuesday, PSG entertain struggling Valenciennes at the Parc des Princes on Friday. The capital club, who are still without the injured Edinson Cavani, have not been at their best since hammering Nantes 5-0 last month and could do with a boost in a game that may see January signing Yohan Cabaye make his first start for the club. Third-placed Lille travel to face Evian on Sunday before fourth and fifth face off at the Stade Geoffroy-Guichard as Saint-Etienne meet Marseille. Les Verts have lost just once in eight league games and have won their last five home matches, all without conceding a goal. Marseille, meanwhile, are enduring a season of ups and downs but head to Le Chaudron having taken seven points from a possible nine. ""We are on a good run at home and we are fourth in the table. That gives us reason to be ambitious,"" midfielder Benjamin Corgnet told Saint-Etienne's website. Lyon have also revived their hopes of European qualification via the league in recent weeks, and Remi Garde's side will expect to register three points when they host bottom side Ajaccio.

He is due to miss Ligue 1 games against Monaco, Saint Etienne and defending champions and leaders Paris Saint Germain. Landreau is currently third in Didier Deschamps' pecking order to keep goal for France at the World Cup finals in Brazil behind Tottenham's Hugo Lloris and Steve Mandanda of Marseille. Landreau has 11 caps to his name. He made his debut in the 2001 Confederations Cup, and was a member of the French squad that reached the 2006 World Cup final, although coach Raymond Domenech didn't give him any playing time. After falling out of favour - he was overlooked for Euro 2008 - he earned a recall in 2012 from Deschamps, with Cedric Carrasso making way."

For Belgian youth international Origi it was his first goal since the opening weekend of the season, while Cape Verde striker Mendes rounded off a clinical counterattack to belatedly get his campaign up and running as Rene Girard's men moved three points clear of Saint-Etienne. Earlier, Marseille gave their European aspirations a timely boost as they cruised to a 3-0 home win over Bastia. Dimitri Payet struck twice in the first half before Andre-Pierre Gignac added his 11th of the campaign after the break to keep Marseille fifth, five points adrift of Lille. With Marseille out of both domestic cup competitions, the league represents the only avenue to European football next term for Jose Anigo's side, who appear to be trending upwards after a third win in five. ""We mastered our subject. We did what we needed to do by scoring very quickly and then killing off the match with the second goal,"" said Gignac afterwards. ""We scored three goals without conceding any, that's the most important thing. ""Since the end of December, we have scored an average of two goals per match. It's good and today we also kept a clean sheet."" Successive victories had seen Bastia looking to break into the top half of the table at the Stade Velodrome but the visitors fell behind on 13 minutes as Payet exchanged passes with Gignac before scuffing a shot that deceived goalkeeper Mickael Landreau. There was little the league's record appearance maker could do about Payet's second though as the winger curled in a sumptuous long-range effort on 25 minutes to take his season's tally to seven. Landreau prevented Marseille from increasing their lead as he turned a Gignac effort round the post before the burly striker headed over from a Benjamin Mendy cross. Wahbi Khazri came close to reducing the deficit two minutes after half-time when he fired against the outside of the post but Bastia's day was to get worse shortly after as Landreau limped off with an ankle injury. His replacement Jean-Louis Leca's first task was to pick the ball out of the net as Gignac netted Marseille's third on 55 minutes, slotting home the rebound after Giannelli Imbula's venomous 25-yard strike cannoned back off the crossbar. Florian Thauvin missed a glorious chance to add his name to the scoresheet just after the hour mark following another Mendy delivery but it mattered little as Marseille strolled to victory. Basement side Ajaccio picked up just their second win of the season after beating Rennes 3-1, while fellow relegation candidates Valenciennes collected three vital points following a 2-1 victory at home to Nice. Elsewhere, Reims came behind to defeat Guingamp 2-1, while Remy Cabella was on target as 10-man Montpellier drew 1-1 with Evian TG. Leaders Paris Saint-Germain travel to title rivals Monaco on Sunday in a top of the table clash at the Stade Louis II, while two of France's most storied clubs, Nantes and Lyon, meet at the Stade de la Beaujoire.

Claudio's Ranieri's men are five points adrift of PSG, and with Colombian star Falcao ruled out for the season with a knee injury, Monaco turned to former Manchester United striker Berbatov in the January transfer window to help fill the void. Berbatov arrived on loan from Premier League strugglers Fulham, with the Bulgarian saying a recommendation from ex-teammate, and former Monaco defender, Patrice Evra convinced him to swap England for the Cote d'Azur. Looking ahead to his first match in Monaco colours, Berbatov said: ""It's the best possible way (to start). ""You play against one of the biggest clubs in football, one of the best players in football (Zlatan Ibrahimovic), so what else can a player want? ""It's going to be a fantastic opportunity for me. ""They are favourites, but they're coming to ours so it will be difficult for them. ""It won't be easy, but we can win Sunday,"" added the 33-year-old, who could start on the bench should Ranieri elect to keep faith with in-form duo Emmanuel Riviere and Valere Germain up front. PSG kept their hopes of a domestic double intact on Tuesday as two goals from Ibrahimovic saw the capital club edge past Nantes 2-1 to seal a place in the final of the League Cup. With several key fixtures on the horizon, including the Champions League last-16 tie against Bayer Leverkusen, PSG are entering what coach Laurent Blanc has dubbed ""money-time"" and is counting on his side to perform. Midfielder Yohan Cabaye, thrust into the midst of a title race after signing from Newcastle United last month, knows victory against Monaco would steer Laurent Blanc's men ever closer to defending their crown. ""It won't be over, there are still 14 matches to play. But a win would bring us closer to the title,"" said the France international, who could be in line for his full debut. Defender Gregory van der Wiel echoed the thoughts of his teammate, adding: ""We want to win. We feel strong. It's never over while there are still points to play for but we would be even further ahead."" Meanwhile Lille have picked up just a solitary point since the turn of the year, leaving their grip on the third and final Champions League berth under serious threat. Saint-Etienne can climb above Lille on Friday night should Les Verts avoid defeat at mid-table Toulouse. However, the visit of relegation candidates Sochaux, who are seven points from safety, could provide the perfect tonic for Rene Girard's stuttering side on Saturday. A resurgent Lyon had their seven-match league unbeaten run ended at Rennes last weekend but Remi Garde's team, who advanced to the final of the League Cup in midweek, will seek to continue their ascent up the table at Nantes on Sunday.

Olivier Veigneau responded with an equaliser nine minutes from the end but Ibrahimovic popped up with his second of the match, and 31st of the season, in the final minute to send the three-time winners through to April's final at the Stade de France. ""It was a real cup tie, the script is often like that,"" said PSG coach Laurent Blanc afterwards. ""In the first (period) we led 1-0. We had chances to double our lead but didn't. ""In the second half Nantes applied more pressure, were more involved, created some chances and equalised. ""But in the last 10 minutes my team stepped up a gear. ""We're in the final, that's what we were looking for and we've done it."" With PSG already eliminated from the French Cup, Blanc fielded a strong side that featured just three changes from the team that beat Bordeaux 2-0 on Friday evening. Ezequiel Lavezzi was drafted in to replace the injured Edinson Cavani on the left of an attacking three, while Marco Verratti, back from suspension, was restored to his midfield duties at the expense of Javier Pastore. Reserve goalkeeper and cup-specialist Nicolas Douchez came in for Salvatore Sirigu, but new recruit Yohan Cabaye was again only listed among the substitutes. Having swept the two league encounters this season, including a 5-0 demolition at the Parc des Princes just over a fortnight ago, PSG almost struck first blood just four minutes in as Lavezzi hit the outside of the post following Blaise Matuidi's burst into the box. Heavy rain made for a slick playing surface at La Beaujoire and it played a factor just moments after that initial reprieve as a poor clearance from Nantes keeper Remy Riou gifted Ibrahimovic the opening goal. Riou appeared to slip as he went to launch Issa Cissokho's backpass upfield, succeeding only in sending the ball straight to Ibrahimovic with the Swede firing a first-time left-foot effort from 30 yards over the head of the unfortunate Nantes keeper. Thiago Silva nearly added a second for the visitors inside the opening 15 minutes but Riou managed to divert the Brazilian's fierce drive from a narrow angle away to safety. Lavezzi then found himself in behind the Nantes backline but was thwarted by the legs of Riou on the half hour. The hosts almost drew level from their first genuine opportunity as Papy Djilobodji rose to meet Vincent Bessat's corner only for a perfectly placed Verratti to clear off the line with referee Laurent Duhamel waving away protests for a handball. A fractious second half produced little in the way of goalmouth action until Veigneau netted an 81st-minute equaliser for Nantes as he slammed home substitute Georges-Kevin Nkoudou's cross. But with extra time beckoning the hosts were undone as Ibrahimovic escaped the attentions of Oswaldo Vizcarrondo to head in Lucas' cross from the right on 90 minutes and punch PSG's ticket to the Stade de France.

But first they will look to get the better of a Nantes side who lost 5-0 at the Parc des Princes in Ligue 1 last month and clinch their place in the final at the Stade de France. ""We are coming up to the money time, so we need to perform,"" said Blanc, who said the focus for now is solely on winning Tuesday's semi-final. ""We are trying to concentrate fully on this tie. The most important thing in a Cup is to get to the next round, especially as the next game will be at the Stade de France."" Uruguay striker Edinson Cavani will miss the game at the Stade de la Beaujoire with a thigh injury which is expected to keep him out for three weeks, but Yohan Cabaye could start for the three-time winners after coming off the bench to make his debut in Friday's 2-0 league win against Bordeaux. ""Cavani will start running again soon but we didn't want to aggravate it so we will not take any risks. We have a big squad and we need to use it when there are injuries,"" added Blanc.

Now Cabaye, who played under Blanc for France, must try and work his way into the coach's favoured 4-3-3 formation, where Blaise Matuidi, Marco Verratti and Thiago Motta are considered the first-choice trio in the centre of the park. However, Blanc said Cabaye was just the player he was looking for and said he had no doubts the former Lille man will get enough game time between now and the end of the season to guarantee his place in the France squad for the World Cup. ""I'm very satisfied. I said when the transfer window opened that I would be satisfied if we could bring in one extra player in midfield,"" said Blanc at a press conference ahead of Friday's home match against Bordeaux at the Parc des Princes. ""We had a good number of propositions but there weren't many who had all the characteristics we were looking for. ""I am happy because I know him well. But when I spoke to the directors a month ago I only gave them the profile I was looking for, not the name. ""He will play, you will see. When you have a three-man midfield, if you have four, five or six players who can play there it's not too many. ""People don't ask such questions of Bayern, (Manchester) City, Milan or Juve. The best three play, and then you get injuries and suspensions."" Indeed, with Italy playmaker Verratti suspended and Adrien Rabiot struggling with a knee problem, Cabaye could be thrown straight into the team on Friday, as long as his transfer is officially ratified in time. ""We have not received the letter. We are hoping it will arrive later today (Thursday). If it comes through, he will be in the squad. ""Otherwise he will have to wait until next Tuesday,"" he said, when PSG travel to Nantes in the semi-finals of the League Cup.

79,25/01/2014,20:07,Football: PSG settle for draw at modest Guingamp,Paris Saint-Germain came within three minutes of suffering a shock defeat on Saturday before an Alex equaliser earned them a 1-1 draw away to Guingamp in Ligue 1.,"The Brazilian's 87th-minute header cancelled out Mustapha Yatabare's effort at the other end with six minutes remaining of a hard-fought encounter played in wet and windy conditions in Brittany. The draw is enough for the defending champions to extend their lead at the top of the table to six points, although second-placed Monaco can trim the gap back to three with a win against Marseille on Sunday. PSG had endured a mixed week, thumping Nantes 5-0 to underline their superiority over the rest of Ligue 1 before being surprisingly eliminated from the French Cup by Montpellier. At the Stade du Roudourou, coach Laurent Blanc was without injured captain Thiago Silva, so Marquinhos lined up in the heart of the defence, while there was a first start in Ligue 1 since the beginning of December for Javier Pastore. And against opponents who had not won in six league games and had scored just three times since the start of November, PSG for once struggled to stamp their authority on proceedings. Zlatan Ibrahimovic had a shot from 40 yards turned around the post by Guy Roland Ndy Assembe with the visitors' best chance of the first half, but that came just two minutes before the interval. Guingamp were a greater threat at the other end, with the 21-year-old Rachid Alioui taking advantage of a rare start to volley just wide early on and then send in a long-range free-kick that moved in the air and was turned desperately onto the crossbar by PSG 'keeper Salvatore Sirigu. Edinson Cavani had an effort correctly ruled out for offside at the start of the second half, and the game looked set to peter out to a goalless draw on a difficult pitch. However, the home side had other ideas and took the lead in the 84th minute when striker Yatabare stole a yard on Marquinhos to head in from a right-wing corner. It was the Malian striker's sixth league goal of the campaign, and his first since early October, and it sparked wild scenes of celebration among the packed crowd inside a stadium which boasts a capacity greater than that of the small town of Guingamp itself. However, the giants from the capital were rescued soon after when Brazilian centre-back Alex got to a corner before Ndy Assembe to head home and restore parity. ""It is always difficult to win games.

""We were not as good today. Why? I don't want to hide behind it but the state of the pitch was deplorable. It is the case for both sides but it handicaps the team that plays the most football. ""We knew it would be difficult and we have to get on with it. It maybe won't be the last time either, but we were not exactly helped."" Monaco will now look to close the gap without the services of top scorer Radamel Falcao, who underwent knee surgery on Saturday after suffering a serious injury in a French Cup win at Chasselay in midweek. Third-placed Lille could only manage a 1-1 draw at home to Rennes on Friday despite Salomon Kalou giving them the lead, and they have now gone four games without a win. Saint-Etienne can move to within a point of the podium with a win at Bordeaux on Sunday, while in-form Lyon are also in action on Sunday against Evian.

80,25/01/2014,19:21,Football: PSG settle for draw at modest Guingamp,Paris Saint-Germain came within three minutes of suffering a shock defeat on Saturday before an Alex equaliser earned them a 1-1 draw away to Guingamp in Ligue 1.,"The Brazilian's 87th-minute header cancelled out Mustapha Yatabare's effort at the other end with six minutes remaining of a hard-fought encounter played in wet and windy conditions in Brittany. The draw is enough for the defending champions to extend their lead at the top of the table to six points, although second-placed Monaco can trim the gap back to three points with a win against Marseille on Sunday. PSG had endured a mixed week, thumping Nantes 5-0 to underline their superiority over the rest of Ligue 1 before being surprisingly eliminated from the French Cup by Montpellier. At the Stade du Roudourou, coach Laurent Blanc was without injured captain Thiago Silva, so Marquinhos lined up in the heart of the defence, while there was a first start in Ligue 1 since the beginning of December for Javier Pastore. And against opponents who had not won in six league games and had scored just three times since the start of November, PSG for once struggled to stamp their authority on proceedings. Zlatan Ibrahimovic had a shot from 40 yards turned around the post by Guy Roland Ndy Assembe with the visitors' best chance of the first half, but that came just two minutes before the interval. Guingamp were a greater threat at the other end, with the 21-year-old Rachid Alioui taking advantage of a rare start to volley just wide early on and then send in a long-range free-kick that moved in the air and was turned desperately onto the crossbar by PSG 'keeper Salvatore Sirigu. Edinson Cavani had an effort correctly ruled out for offside at the start of the second half, and the game looked set to peter out to a goalless draw on a difficult pitch. However, the home side had other ideas and took the lead in the 84th minute when striker Yatabare stole a yard on Marquinhos to head in from a right-wing corner. It was the Malian striker's sixth league goal of the campaign, and his first since early October, and it sparked wild scenes of celebration among the packed crowd inside a stadium which boasts a capacity greater than that of the small town of Guingamp itself. However, the giants from the capital were rescued soon after when Brazilian centre-back Alex got to a corner before Ndy Assembe to head home and restore parity. Monaco will now look to close the gap without the services of top scorer Radamel Falcao, who underwent knee surgery on Saturday after suffering a serious injury in a French Cup win at Chasselay in midweek. Third-placed Lille could only manage a 1-1 draw at home to Rennes on Friday despite Salomon Kalou giving them the lead, and they have now gone four games without a win. Saint-Etienne can move to within a point of the podium with a win at Bordeaux on Sunday, while in-form Lyon are also in action on Sunday against Evian. Elsewhere on Saturday, the meeting between Toulouse and Bastia was called off because of the wet weather in south-western France."

Blanc will start with a strong side against Brest, although Christophe Jallet has a back problem that may require surgery.

Monaco, who sit second in the top flight, travel to third-tier strugglers Vannes with the focus on whether Colombian striker Radamel Falcao will start a game for the first time since November 24. The former Atletico Madrid man made his comeback after a thigh complaint as a substitute in the shock 2-1 home defeat to Valenciennes just before Christmas. Bordeaux travel to amateur outfit Raon l'Etape, a team they beat on penalties on the way to winning the competition last season, while elsewhere there are a number of ties between Ligue 1 sides.

He is suffering from a hamstring niggle but rumours are rife in the French press that all is not well between player and coach, something both have denied. ""I'm very happy at Monaco,"" Falcao said in French at an improvised press conference at the club shop, where he was signing autographs. ""My wife is very happy to live here. There's no problem with the coach, no problem with the doctor and no problem with the team. ""I've just got a little problem with a (hamstring). But I'll soon be playing again."" Earlier, Ranieri had announced the 27-year-old's comeback was on hold again. ""He won't play against Guingamp. He and I hope he'll be present for the match against Valenciennes (on December 20),"" said Ranieri. Every week, though, the Italian has claimed Falcao is close to a return, only for him to be ruled out. After the 1-0 win at Ajaccio on Sunday, Ranieri had said he thought his 60-million-euro ($83m) signing would be fit on Saturday. But Monaco released a statement explaining that he was continuing ""treatment on the muscular discomfort (scarring of an old tear to the hamstring of the right thigh) which remains painful."" ""The improvement is progressive but will not allow participation in the next match,"" added the statement. Earlier that day, French sports daily L'Equipe claimed the case surrounding Falcao's injury was a ""mystery"" while adding that his absence from the pitch was ""unexplained"" and that the club were being ""silent"" about his injury. It continued, saying ""all (the elements) are there to create a problem around Radamel Falcao"". As well as Falcao himself, France international midfielder Jeremy Toulalan also rubbished the rumours. ""What's being said about him, I don't think it bothers us or worries us,"" said the 30-year-old. ""And we've shown that. I've been through it myself. The most annoying thing is for him. The most bothered is him. He'd like to be playing. But we're continuing to advance without him, even though surely it would better with him. ""As soon as there's a little thing you (the media) plunge into it. I don't have the impression that there's any problem. But even if I say that, you'll keep going. That's the game. For us, there's no problem. ""I've had injuries like that. You feel like you'll never get over it and you do everything to do so.

Napoli, who are on nine points with Dortmund and three behind Arsenal, must beat the Premier League pacesetters by three clear goals, should Dortmund also win in France. However it will be the German club who go through with Rafa Benitez's team due to their superior head-to-head record against both clubs. Arsenal will go through with a draw or a defeat by two goals or less. Marseille meanwhile are in turmoil, and fired coach Elie Baup following their 1-0 home defeat against Nantes on Friday, replacing him with Jose Anigo. They cannot even dream of the consolation of Europa League football in the New Year as they are pointless following five straight defeats. Dortmund coach Jurgen Klopp looked on as his side suffered their fourth league defeat of the season on Saturday when they slumped 1-0 at home to second-placed Bayer Leverkusen but the price was heavier than just three points. Germany midfielder Sven Bender is ruled out after limping off with an ankle injury while Turkey international Nuri Sahin is doubtful after slightly tearing an ankle ligament. ""We lost 1-0, but that's actually the least of our problems,"" Klopp said following the match. Dortmund are already withouth midfielder Ilkay Gundogan, defender Mats Hummels, Neven Subotic and Marcel Schmelzer as Klopp's injury worries show no sign of easing. He is also down to his fourth choice at centre-back, having played Bender out of position in the 3-1 win over Napoli on matchday five, as Manuel Friedrich is cup-tied and Hummels injured. ""We now find ourselves in the situation where we are constantly having to react,"" said Klopp. ""But necessity is the mother of invention, so we'll see what happens. ""We have certainly had easier moments, but we have to fight on."" Caretaker manager Anigo takes charge of his first match back at the helm of Marseille after a four year spell between 2001 and 2005, preceded before then as sporting director.

That setback ended PSG's 36-match undefeated run and it was rock-bottom Sochaux who were cast in the role of fall guys on Saturday. Ibrahimovic scored twice in the last five minutes after Thiago Silva, Ezequiel Lavezzi and Edinson Cavani, with his 11th of the season, had also hit the target. PSG were on top from the start at the Parc des Princes where Sochaux had lost on their last five visits, conceding 16 goals. Ibrahimovic had two early opportunities -- grazing the post in the eighth minute before smashing a free-kick into the wall, five minutes later. Their pressure told after 14 minutes with the big Swede once again involved. His pass to the far post allowed Silva to slot the ball right-footed past Pierrick Cros in the Sochaux goal. Ibrahimovic then freed Thiago Motta who was thwarted by the busy Cros. PSG continued to toy with the visitors with Marco Verratti, Cavani and Maxwell causing a string of problems. Cavani came closest to adding a second goal just on the stroke of half-time when his 20-metre drive was kept out by Cros. PSG were rewarded for their endeavour with a second goal in the opening minute of the second half. Lavezzi scored from a Motta pass although there was a hint of offside when the Argentine striker collected the ball. On the hour mark, Cavani made it 3-0 and again Ibrahimovic was involved. The Swede crossed for Cavani at the far post who controlled the ball before quickly hitting the target. Ibrahimovic deservedly grabbed the fourth in the 85th minute with a brutally-struck free-kick from 20 metres which fizzed past the despairing dive of Cros. Cavani then teed-up Ibrahimovic in the 89th minute for the fifth. Lille can close the gap on PSG to one point with a win at Bordeaux on Sunday while third-placed Monaco, who are five points off the lead, meet Ajaccio. Earlier Saturday, flagging Marseille sacked manager Elie Baup, the dismissal coming at the end of a week when the south coast club suffered two successive Ligue 1 defeats. The 1-0 loss to Nantes on Friday, which followed a similar reverse at Lille left Marseille in fifth and they now trail PSG by 13 points.

The unexpected setback has allowed Lille to close within one point and Monaco two, after both clubs picked up wins over Marseille and Nice respectively, heading into the weekend's action. It was also a notable week for veteran goalkeepers Mickael Landreau of Bastia and Lille's Vincent Enyeama. Landreau, who began his incredible career between the sticks for Nantes in 1996 at just 17, set a new mark for top flight appearances in midweek when he raised the bar to 603, one better than former Monaco custodian Jean-Luc Ettori who set the previous record between 1975 and 1992. Nigeria's African champion Enyeama was also very much the talk of the league when he extended his number of minutes without conceding a goal to 1035 with a match-winning performance against Marseille. He is now within 141 minutes of the Ligue 1 all-time record of 1176 minutes unbeaten, held by Gaetan Huard and set in 1993. ""In the dressing room, it was incredible, everyone congratulated me,"" confessed Enyeama following the 1-0 win and passing the mythical 1000 minute mark. ""Above all, I am just very proud to be here and be a part of this team,"" he added. Landreau equalled Lettori's mark last Sunday with a clean sheet during Bastia's 2-0 win over Evian before breaking the record against Corsican neighbours Ajaccio in a 1-1 draw on Wednesday. Ettori, 58, was diplomatic after losing his long standing record. ""It is not just an anecdote and created a buzz,"" he said in reference to his mark. ""Six hundred and three matches is not insignificant, it's huge in fact and I'm happy for Mickael,"" said Ettori. ""I played 750 matches for the same club (all competitions) and that is a record that is going to last, in fact I think it will never be broken,"" he added. At PSG, Blanc's men have a chance to bounce back with what appears to be a home banker against rock bottom Sochaux on Saturday while Monaco host equally struggling Ajaccio and Lille travel to in-form Bordeaux. Nantes have positioned themselves just one point behind fourth placed Marseille and the two teams meet in a Friday clash at the Velodrome, with Elie Baup's position as OM coach potentially on the line. League Cup holders Saint-Etienne, were beaten by Rennes in midweek, and await the buoyant Evian side after their best win of the season over PSG. Lorient and Rennes meet in Brittany, Reims and Nice will do battle in the Champagne-region and Valenciennes are at home to Guingamp on Saturday.

That goal came just seconds after Javier Pastore had missed a glorious chance to bring the defending champions level, and the result ends PSG's unbeaten record under Laurent Blanc. Indeed, the capital club's sequence of Ligue 1 matches without defeat ends at 26, one short of the club record set in their title-winning 1993-94 campaign. And their overall run without losing in all competitions ends at 36 matches, also one short of the club record. However, that sequence does not include a defeat to Evian on penalties in the quarter-finals of the French Cup last season, and now the club from the shadow of the Alps can claim to be PSG's bogey side. ""This win is marvellous for all our fans, the whole region. I have to congratulate my players,"" said Evian coach Pascal Dupraz, who nevertheless admitted his frustration that his side were unable to produce such performances on a regular basis. Blanc did not dwell long on the run coming to an end. ""We had our chances in the first-half and we can have regrets about the loss because we should have opened the scoring and that could have meant a different result,"" he said. Blanc's side are now just a single point clear of Lille at the top of the table, with the northern side having beaten Marseille 1-0 on Tuesday, with Nolan Roux scoring a stoppage-time winner as Nigerian goalkeeper Vincent Enyeama kept his 11th consecutive clean sheet. Meanwhile, Monaco are just one point futher behind in third after they won 3-0 away to Nice in a Cote d'Azur derby on Tuesday, achieved without Radamel Falcao, as the Colombian missed a second successive game due to injury. James Rodriguez, Emmanuel Riviere and Lucas Ocampos got the goals for Claudio Ranieri's men, as Nice fell to a sixth straight defeat. Elsewhere on Wednesday, veteran goalkeeper Mickael Landreau broke the record for the most appearances by any player in France's top flight as he started for Bastia in their Corsican derby draw with Ajaccio. French international Landreau played his 603rd Ligue 1 game, three days after equalling the previous record held by former Monaco 'keeper Jean-Luc Ettori, in a game played on neutral ground on the mainland at the Stade Parsemain, home of second-tier club Istres. But Landreau, formerly of Nantes, PSG and Lille, was unable to help Bastia beat their island rivals as the game ended in a 1-1 draw, a late Eduardo strike for Ajaccio cancelling out Florian Raspentino's early opener. ""It is fabulous to experience this and to be able to share it,"" said Landreau after the match. ""The game was played behind closed doors, but I prepare for every match in the same manner. ""I can feel what this represents, and it is massive."" Saint-Etienne missed the chance to reclaim fifth spot as they went down 3-1 away to Rennes in Brittany, with Argentine striker Silvio Romero scoring his first two goals in French football for the hosts. Bordeaux inflicted a first home defeat on Guingamp since the opening day of the season, winning 1-0 thanks to a solitary Julien Faubert strike, while Lorient increased the pressure on beleagured Montpellier coach Jean Fernandez with a 2-0 victory at the Stade de la Mosson. Maxime Barthelme put Lorient ahead before Cameroon international forward Vincent Aboubakar scored his ninth goal of the season from the penalty spot at the death after the home side had been reduced to nine men by the dismissals of Vitorino Hilton and Abdelhamid El-Kaoutari. However, Montpellier's plight is not as serious as that of Sochaux, who remain rooted to the bottom seven points from safety after losing 2-0 at home to Reims."

That goal came just seconds after Javier Pastore had missed a glorious chance to bring the defending champions level, and the result ends PSG's unbeaten record under Laurent Blanc. Indeed, the capital club's sequence of Ligue 1 matches without defeat ends at 26, one short of the club record set in their title-winning 1993-94 campaign. And their overall run without losing in all competitions ends at 36 matches, also one short of the club record. However, that sequence does not include a defeat to Evian on penalties in the quarter-finals of the French Cup last season, and now the club from the shadow of the Alps can claim to be PSG's bogey side. ""This win is marvellous for all our fans, the whole region. I have to congratulate my players,"" said Evian coach Pascal Dupraz, who nevertheless admitted his frustration that his side were unable to produce such performances on a regular basis. Blanc's side are now just a single point clear of Lille at the top of the table, with the northern side having beaten Marseille 1-0 on Tuesday, with Nolan Roux scoring a stoppage-time winner as Nigerian goalkeeper Vincent Enyeama kept his 11th consecutive clean sheet.

PSG's last defeat of any sort came against Evian in Annecy in April, when they lost on penalties in the quarter-finals of the French Cup. Not including that, however, PSG are 36 games unbeaten in all competitions, one short of the overall club record. Their nearest challengers Lille beat Marseille 1-0 on Tuesday, with Nolan Roux scoring a stoppage-time winner as Nigerian goalkeeper Vincent Enyeama kept his 11th consecutive clean sheet.

Lille's win moved them to wthin a point of leaders Paris Saint Germain, who play Evian on Wednesday, while Marseille are 10 points adrift of PSG and being threatened for fourth spot by Nantes, who grabbed a late winner in a 2-1 victory over struggling Valenciennes. Monaco stayed third and moved to within two points of PSG when they beat ailing Nice 3-0 later on Tuesday with Emmanuel Riviere ending a scoring drought dating back nine games as he grabbed the second goal to help his side to their third successive win. Enyeama moved past 1000 minutes in not conceding a goal -- since the 2-0 defeat by Nice on September 15 -- taking it to 1035 minutes. The 31-year-old goalkeeper -- who captained Nigeria to their Africa Cup of Nations triumph earlier this year -- is second on the all-time top flight list behind Frenchman Gaetan Huard who in the 1992-1993 season didn't concede a goal for Bordeaux for 1176 minutes. ""What can I say! I am just enjoying the moment,"" Enyeama told Bein Sport. ""It's not just me, though, it is the whole group. We stay strong like a team. We have the spirit and the strength. ""I don't know what is possible now. All I can say is that I havre a great team round me and a great set of coaches."" Going into the match there had been fears over how former Lille star Florian Thauvin would be received after a group of Lille supporters went to the airport and booed and hissed him when Marseille arrived for the match. Thauvin -- in form of late with five goals in the last 12 games and creating another three -- produced not much of note in the first-half, save one wonderful mazy run deep into Lille territory and although he was dispossessed the ball fell to Mathieu Valbuena who found Andre-Pierre Gignac. The former France striker shrugged off a defender and only had Enyeama to beat but the goalkeeper proved equal to the task blocking Gignac's shot and when the rebound fell to Valbuena his shot drifted wide. One double save in the second-half in particular stood out, Dimitri Payet's fierce strike being batted away by Enyeama but straight to Gignac out wide right in the area, but his curling effort was tipped away by the goalkeeper. Marseille's frustrating evening deepened when the ever lively Valbuena went down heavily on his left shoulder and had to be taken off immediately, leaving the pitch and trudging down the tunnel holding his left arm gingerly. The game seemed to be petering out into a deserved share of the points only for Roux to reward Enyeama's superb display as he headed into the far corner."

They remain four points clear of Lille and five ahead of Monaco at the top of the standings after easing past a Lyon side who once dominated the French scene themselves but who are currently languishing in mid-table. But while Lyon coach Remi Garde accepted that his team are ""not competing in the same league as Paris"", opposite number Laurent Blanc insisted the scoreline was not necessarily a fair reflection on the game. ""The size of the scoreline could make you think it was easy from beginning to end, but Lyon made life difficult for us early on,"" he said. ""If we keep playing at 100 percent, I think it will be very difficult to beat PSG. But we need to avoid complacency and be at our very best every game."" The build-up to the match was overshadowed by the news that both team buses were stoned on the way to the stadium, while Lyon lost Bafetimbi Gomis to injury in the warm-up. In his absence, OL played with a three-man central defence and for much of the first half they succeeded in frustrating the hosts. They were also helped by referee Antony Gautier's decision not to award a penalty when Cavani went down under a challenge from Bakary Kone 16 minutes in. Alexandre Lacazette had been left to plough a lone furrow up front for Lyon and he had the visitors' best opportunity of the first half, creating space for himself inside the box and lashing a shot against the bar. But PSG got their noses in front nine minutes before the interval when Cavani met a corner from the left and headed in through the legs of Yoann Gourcuff, who was standing on the near post. Five minutes later, the Uruguayan was brought down again inside the box. This time, Lyon goalkeeper Remy Vercoutre was the culprit, and a penalty was awarded. Ibrahimovic sent Vercoutre the wrong way as he coolly chipped into the net, and Lyon's chances of getting back into the game appeared to be over by the interval. They conceded again on the hour mark, though, Brazil skipper Silva converting the loose ball following a corner for his first ever goal in Ligue 1. And there was more pain to come for the visitors as Ibrahimovic beat Vercoutre from the spot once again after being fouled by Samuel Umtiti, taking his tally to 20 goals in his last 13 games for club and country. PSG are now unbeaten in 26 Ligue 1 matches and maintain a safe distance from Lille, who won 1-0 at northern neighbours Valenciennes on Saturday as Nigerian goalkeeper Vincent Enyeama extended his remarkable run without conceding a goal to 945 minutes. Meanwhile, Monaco proved too strong for Rennes on Saturday despite being without the injured Radamel Falcao -- James Rodriguez and Anthony Martial scoring in a 2-0 triumph. Elsewhere on Sunday, Mickael Landreau equalled fellow goalkeeper Jean-Luc Ettori's record of 602 appearances in France's top flight as he kept a clean sheet for Bastia in a 2-0 win over Evian. The 34-year-old French international began his career at Nantes in 1996 and won the title with Les Canaris in 2001 before spells at Paris Saint-Germain and Lille, with whom he won the double in 2011. ""I have worked so hard to get to this point. I am enormously lucky,"" said Landreau after drawing level with Ettori, who spent his entire career at Monaco between 1975 and 1992 and picked up nine caps for France. Milos Krasic and Wahbi Khazri got the goals for Bastia, who are eighth, while Brazilian forward Jussie scored twice in Bordeaux's 4-0 win against hapless Ajaccio in Sunday's other game."

Landreau, who has played 11 times for his country, remains part of the France set-up under Didier Deschamps and looks likely to appear at his second World Cup next year in Brazil following a role as a squad member in 2006 when Les Bleus lost in the final against Italy on penalties. On-loan Serbian winger Milos Krasic put the Coriscan side in front four minutes inside the second half before Tunisian international Wahbi Khazri sealed the result in stoppage time. Landreau, who was appointed captain for the match, helped Bastia move into the upper half of the table, while Evian remain fifth from bottom. Earlier on Sunday, Bordeaux rumbled to their biggest win of the season as they crushed relegation threatened Ajaccio 4-0 to move ninth in Ligue 1. Leaders Paris Saint-Germain host Lyon later on Sunday attempting to extend their one point cushion on Lille with Monaco third a further point back after both the chasing teams won Saturday against Valenciennes and Rennes respectively. At the Chaban-Delmas stadium, Brazilian Jussie was the catalyst for Bordeaux, scoring the opening and closing goals while Gregory Sertic and Nicolas Maurice-Belay were also on target. ""It's very pleasing to score a double, as much as the victory,"" said the 30-year-old Jussie, who joined Bordeaux in 2007 from Lens after beginning his career at Brazilian club Cruzeiro. ""We've been in a bit of a black period, even if we weren't losing much, but this relieves the pressure a bit,"" added the striker, who took on French nationality in 2011 and was part of the championship winning team under current PSG coach Laurent Blanc in 2009.

""I don't know if we're going to be able to compete with PSG. For the moment Paris are four points ahead, you can't say that they've pulled ahead,"" said Girard. It was a largely unconvincing display from the northerners who struggled to create anything despite playing the final 34 minutes with a numerical advantage following Oscar Trejo's red card. ""The sending off totally changed the direction of the match,"" complained Toulouse coach Alain Casanova. ""When I see my player with three stitches it makes me think there surely must have been a foul beforehand.

""We were lucky because they had a player sent off while they had been playing very well up until that."" Meanwhile, Saint-Etienne got back to winning ways at Nice despite the absence of their fans. Around 250 visiting fans were evacuated from Nice's Allianz Riviera stadium after coming under fire from sections of the home support, who tore up seats and threw them at their rival supporters. The visitors however let their football do the talking with Mevlüt Erding scoring his first goal for Saint-Etienne after 23 minutes, lifting his side to sixth. It was a fourth straight defeat for Nice, who were hit by a string of injuries, with an error from third goalkeeper Luca Veronese, 22, accounting for the goal. On Saturday, PSG kept their unbeaten start to the season intact with a dominant 3-0 win at Reims. Lucas Moura and Jeremy Menez shared goals either side of half-time and Zlatan Ibrahimovic added a late insurance marker as Laurent Blanc's men rumbled to their 10th victory in 14 outings. Lyon were held 1-1 at home by relegation threatened Valenciennes, while Lorient picked up a rare away win by thrashing French Cup finalists Evian 4-0.

Third-placed Monaco travel to Nantes in the final match of the weekend on Sunday with the promoted clubs doing battle for the first time since returning to the top flight.

104,22/11/2013,22:35,Football: Marseille defeat Ajaccio to climb fourth,"Last season's runners-up Marseille, picked up their second straight Ligue 1 victory after a slump of seven matches without winning as they defeated Ajaccio 3-1 on Friday in Corsica.","Dimitri Payet gave Elie Baup's men the ideal start with a 27th minute opener, only for Grenddy Perozo to level terms four minutes later. Former France international Andre-Pierre Gignac celebrated his recall to the side by restoring the visitors' lead six minutes before half-time before Florian Thauvin wrapped up maximum points on 58 minutes as Marseille climbed to fourth. Baup, who has seen his struggling outfit eliminated from Champions League action with two games to play in the group phase, received a welcome tonic following the international break as the Velodrome giants moved one point above Nantes. It was a tetchy encounter that featured five yellow cards, but only one against the 1993 European champions. Unbeaten Paris Saint-Germain continue to set the pace with the defending champions still seven points in front of their arch rivals Marseille ahead of their Saturday afternoon clash at Reims, a venue where they lost 1-0 last season. Third-placed Monaco travel to Nantes in the final match of the weekend on Sunday with the promoted clubs doing battle for the first time since returning to the top flight. Lille begin the weekend in second and four points adrift of PSG as they host Toulouse on Sunday."
105,22/11/2013,02:05,Football: PSG put record to test as French ride crest of wave,"After a week in which the national team's qualification for the World Cup provided a huge boost to French football, Paris Saint-Germain will bid to extend their long unbeaten run as Ligue 1 returns.","The capital club, who come into the weekend four points clear of Lille at the top of the table, travel to Champagne country to face Reims on Saturday afternoon. They have a score to settle with Hubert Fournier's side after losing 1-0 at the Stade Auguste-Delaune last season, although remarkably they have not lost in the league since that match on March 2, a run of 24 games. Indeed, the capital club have not lost any of their 18 matches in all competitions this season, but Saturday's opponents are in formidable form themselves. Reims have lost just once in 13 matches, a run that has seen them beat Lille, Lyon and Marseille, and draw with Monaco, while they also knocked the principality club out of the League Cup. They come into the weekend in sixth position and Fournier is hoping his side can spring another surprise. ""We need to make sure we have no regrets at the end of the game,"" he said. ""If a little window opens, we need to enter it. We must believe we can cause an upset."" Their chances of doing so may be helped by the fact PSG's preparations have been hindered by the late return from international duty of numerous players. Record signing Edinson Cavani was not due to return to France until Friday morning after helping Uruguay qualify for the World Cup in a play-off against Jordan and coach Laurent Blanc admitted that he is likely to be rested. While some members of his squad -- including Blaise Matuidi, who helped France beat Ukraine in remarkable fashion in their decisive World Cup play-off -- will be on a high, others had a less enjoyable experience playing for their countries. That was the case for Zlatan Ibrahimovic, whose Sweden side missed out on a place in Brazil after losing to Portugal. ""I would have been happier had Zlatan qualified for the World Cup with Sweden, (but) now we need to try to fulfil our objectives at club level, and I know that Zlatan's personal aims are high. That will help ease his disappointment,"" Blanc said. ""You can expect changes to the team,"" he added. ""(But) those who have stayed here during the international break do not necessarily have a greater chance of playing the next game."" Conditions are likely to be tricky, with temperatures in France having plummeted in recent days, and Blanc is not taking anything for granted. ""They will be especially motivated and we expect a difficult game. We have not been able to prepare in the best possible manner. ""I am afraid of them, just as I am afraid of any team. Another thing that concerns me at the moment is the weather because pitches are not going to be in great condition. Our philosophy is based on playing football, and to do that we need a good pitch."" Elsewhere, second-placed Lille entertain Toulouse on Sunday looking to extend a run of eight games without losing or even conceding a goal, while Nantes, in fourth, face third-placed Monaco. Two of France's most famous clubs, both were promoted back to Ligue 1 in the summer, but while big-spending Monaco were expected to compete near the top of the table, Nantes have surprised observers with their impressive form. Les Canaris have lost just once in seven outings and a win will see them leapfrog Monaco on goal difference, with Claudio Ranieri's men having won just one of their last four.

However, Monaco coach Claudio Ranieri had made as many as nine changes to the team that beat Lyon in Ligue 1 on Sunday, with the suspended Radamel Falcao among those missing. This weekend, Monaco travel to face Lille in Ligue 1 in a meeting of the two sides immediately behind Paris Saint-Germain at the top of the table. Lille have not lost or conceded a goal in their last six league games, although they were also knocked out of the League Cup this midweek, losing 1-0 at home after extra-time to second-tier Auxerre on Tuesday.

110,27/10/2013,23:36,"Football: PSG stay unbeaten, top after controversial draw",Paris Saint-Germain were 60 seconds from their first defeat of the season on Sunday before a desperate equaliser from Blaise Matuidi salvaged a 2-2 draw at Saint-Etienne and kept them top of Ligue 1.,"In a match full of drama and controversy, Saint-Etienne threw away a 2-0 second half lead albeit hindered by a red card which allowed Laurent Blanc's men back in the match. The point allowed PSG to cling to top spot as they lead Monaco on goal difference after Claudio Ranieri's side defeated Lyon 2-1 earlier in the day. ""It was a difficult evening for Paris and an intense match but I enjoyed myself regardless,"" said Blanc. ""PSG have to understand that we are going to come up against very good, organised teams and we were in a great stadium tonight. ""We gave them two goals which were terrible defensive mistakes and we were punished. ""I thought we were average and Saint-Etienne fully deserved at least a point."" added the former France and Bordeaux handler. Midfielder Benjamin Corgnet opened the scoring after just 18 minutes when he took advantage of a missed clearance from Brazilian centre-back Marquinhos to crash the ball past a static Salvatore Sirigu in the PSG goal. The visitors failed to convert their possession dominance as they chased an equaliser and fell further behind in comical circumstances six minutes after the break. Sirigu came out of his goal to collect a cross but tangled with his own defender Alex which allowed Romain Hamouma to clip the ball into an empty goal. It was the first time since last March that PSG had conceded two goals in a league match -- ironically against the same opposition. But the turning point occurred on 59 minutes when Fabien Lemoine tangled with Ezequiel Lavezzi who elbowed him in the face leaving him covered in blood. Referee Ruddy Buquet saw the incident differently and sent off the furious Frenchman who may have been dismissed for dissent in the heat of the moment. The red card swung the momentum in favour of Blanc's men and when Edinson Cavani stabbed the ball home from close range after a good pass from Brazilian defender Maxwell, the comeback was half completed. However stubborn defending from Saint-Etienne and some rousing support almost inspired Christophe Galtier's League Cup holders to victory. But with seconds remaining a looping ball into the penalty area from Matuidi eluded Saint-Etienne 'keeper Stephane Ruffier and bounced into the net. Earlier at the Louis II stadium, Ligue 1's top scorer Radamel Falcao found the target for the first time in four matches as he helped Monaco defeat Lyon 2-1. The former Atletico Madrid striker chipped Lyon 'keeper Anthony Lopes in the 36th minute following Mounir Obbadi's 28th minute opener as Claudio Ranieri's men extended their unbeaten run to seven wins and four draws in 11 outings. French striker Bafetimbi Gomis gave the visitors hope with 28 minutes left when he powered home a close-range header but it wasn't enough as Lyon suffered their fifth defeat. ""It was important for Falcao to score and when he scores Monaco usually win and we have to win all our matches if we want to stay at the top,"" explained Monaco's Portuguese defender Ricardo Carvalho. Lille slip to third, two points back behind PSG and Monaco following their disciplined 1-0 win at Nantes on Friday. Earlier on Sunday, Bordeaux rode two late goals from Mali international Cheikh Diabate and Polish winger Ludovic Obraniak to defeat Montpellier 2-0 in a battle of former champions at the Chaban Delmas stadium."

Colombian hitman Falcao took his season's tally to eight goals in 11 matches and surprisingly came in for criticism in recent weeks after a brief drought of three fixtures without scoring. The former Atletico Madrid striker chipped Lyon 'keeper Anthony Lopes in the 36th minute following Mounir Obbadi's 28th minute opener as Claudio Ranieri's men extended their unbeaten run to seven wins and four draws in 11 outings. French striker Bafetimbi Gomis gave the visitors hope with 28 minutes left when he powered home a close-range header but it wasn't enough as Lyon suffered their fifth defeat. Lyon are in domestic free-fall as the seven-time champions endure one of the worst starts to their season in over a decade and have just three wins all season under embattled coach Remi Garde. ""We had a pretty easy first half but made life difficult for ourselves by conceding a goal,"" explained Monaco's Portuguese defender Ricardo Carvalho. ""It was important for Falcao to score and when he scores Monaco usually win and we have to win all our matches if we want to stay at the top,"" he added. Lille slip to third, one point behind PSG and two behind Monaco following their disciplined 1-0 win at Nantes on Friday. Earlier on Sunday, Bordeaux rode two late goals from Mali international Cheikh Diabate and Polish winger Ludovic Obraniak to defeat Montpellier in a battle of former champions at the Chaban Delmas stadium. The victory for the 'Girodins' eases them away from the relegation zone and up to 13th while Montpellier's dismal start to the season continues as they slip to three places above the relegation zone."
113,24/10/2013,13:30,Football: Ibra extending PSG's horizons to new frontiers,Zlatan Ibrahimovic remains the talk of Ligue 1 as the Sweden captain continues to carry leaders Paris Saint-Germain to heights they have rarely tasted before.,"The Swedish star's stunning Champions League quadruple was the cornerstone of PSG's 5-0 thrashing of Anderlecht on Wednesday. The 32-year-old has now scored 10 goals in his last five matches as Laurent Blanc's side continue their near perfect start to the season. Applauded off the pitch by the Brussels' faithful in a rare tribute to an away player, his form has hit new levels of greatness as the capital club stand on the brink of the European knockout phase, and have a two point lead to protect heading into Sunday's away fixture at Saint-Etienne. It was the club's record away victory in Champions League action and their 12 goals in three matches is the second highest tally in competition history behind Arsenal's 14 in 2010-11. ""He is in excellent form and scoring lots of goals,"" understated Blanc. ""But what I really appreciate is he is more and more involved in the play and he is very difficult to mark. ""I had the chance to play with some great players and he is a great player. He is like a locomotive for the others and pulls everyone to greater heights."" continued the former France and Bordeaux handler. Monaco are the only other unbeaten side in the league and could only look on with envy as PSG stole the midweek headlines while coach Claudio Ranieri must rally the troops for Sunday's home match against Lyon after being held 2-2 by lowly Sochaux in their last outing. Questions have cropped up over Monaco's title credentials despite six wins in ten matches and after throwing away a two goal lead at Herve Renard's revamped Sochaux side, the match against struggling Lyon takes on added importance. Rejuvenated Nantes are enjoying a new lease of life as the eight-time champions have a chance to move level with Monaco in what is a tasty appetiser on Friday, at home to third-placed Lille. Last season's runners-up Marseille have seen their season nosedive after losing 1-0 at Nice last week and crashing to a third straight Champions League defeat against Napoli on Tuesday. Elie Baup's side have fallen seven points off the pace and have already suffered three domestic defeats but a home match against lower table Reims on Saturday, may be the remedy to get back to winning ways. Bordeaux who won the 2008 title under Blanc have also seen their fortunes turn sour and they come into their home match against Montpellier sixth from bottom and only four points above the relegation zone. Renard has already enhanced his reputation after inspiring Sochaux's comeback last week and the 45-year-old, who memorably led Zambia to their first African championship in 2012, will relish the trip to a Lorient side just one point above them, near the foot of the table. Elsewhere, Toulouse host Rennes, Guingamp await Ajaccio, Nice visit Bastia and Valenciennes are at home to Evian on the Saturday evening slate.

115,18/10/2013,02:35,Football: PSG sweating on Ibra fitness ahead of Bastia,Champions Paris Saint-Germain are sweating on the fitness of star striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic ahead of the visit of Bastia on Saturday.,"PSG trail big-spending rivals Monaco on goal difference at the top of a Ligue 1 table increasingly developing into a two-horse race, already at this early stage of the season. Those two remain the only unbeaten sides after nine games and have both returned from the Velodrome cauldron with maximum points from a trip to their only potential challengers, Marseille. But the news is not good for PSG as Ibrahimovic was injured when playing for Sweden last Friday. He started training on his own on Thursday but the thigh problem could yet see him miss Saturday's match. It would be a further blow for the Parisians, who will already be without suspended midfield pair Thiago Motta, who was sent-off against Marseille, and Marco Verratti, whose booking against the same team led to his ban. Brazilian centre-back Marquinhos insists, though, that the champions have the squad to make light of any absences. ""They (Motta and Verratti) are two very important players for us but we have a big squad with quality players to replace them and in whom we have every bit of faith,"" he said. While they may be missing certain players, PSG can count on a rapidly improving Marquinhos, who said he was fatigued when he first arrived at the club from Roma at the start of the season. ""It was very difficult for me. I was out of condition when I arrived,"" he said. ""Physically (I'm now at 100 percent), yes, and mentally. But I still think I can improve a lot. I'm keeping my feet on the ground and continuing to improve."" Marquinhos, who cost 30 million euros ($41 million) from Roma even though he is still only 19, has one eye on earning a World Cup berth with his country. ""Why not? I have to dream and believe in myself. To play in the World Cup in my home country would be a dream,"" he added. Bastia are also likely to be without a crucial player in former PSG goalkeeper Mickael Landreau, who is suffering from a hamstring problem. Landreau is closing in on the record number of Ligue 1 appearances held by former Monaco goalkeeper Jean-Luc Ettori. He has 596 compared to Ettori's 602 and is set to break the record at the beginning of December should he play every one of Bastia's matches until then. Such matters won't concern PSG, though, who are simply looking for three points to ensure Monaco, who travel to second-from-bottom Sochaux on Sunday, do not get away from them. Monaco look set to recall France midfielder Jeremy Toulalan, who has been out since the beginning of September with a groin strain. ""I've been through a physical training programme and I'm better now, I'm ready to play,"" he said. In other matches, Marseille were looking to bounce back to form following their home defeat to PSG in the Cote d'Azur derby away to Nice in Friday night's early game. Marseille coach Elie Baup was expecting to have striker Andre-Pierre Gignac fit again after a toe injury, although winger Dimitri Payet was suspended. Nice's greatest worry was over the state of their pitch at the Allianz Riviera following the French Top 14 rugby match between Toulon and Clermont played there on October 5. Nice would draw level on points with fourth-placed Marseille with victory.

117,29/09/2013,23:17,Football: Monaco go top despite being held at Reims,Monaco moved back to the summit of Ligue 1 on Sunday despite being held to a 1-1 at Reims as the momentum swung again at the top in France.,"After Antoine Devaux had given the Champagne-region outfit a shock fourth-minute lead with a close range header, Portuguese international Joao Moutinho opened his season's scoring account with a brilliant free-kick that flew inside the near post nine minutes later. Up until Sunday, Colombian Radamel Falcao and Frenchman Emmanuelle Riviere had scored all of Monaco's goals in the league. Reims almost snatched a shock winner in the 86th minute but Togo international Floyd Ayite was denied by Monaco's Croatian 'keeper Danijel Subasic despite being clear on goal. In a feisty finale, Reims had Atlia Turan sent off for a second bookable offence with two minutes left, but Monaco were unable to capitalise. Claudio Ranieri's men however, have seen their two-point cushion at the top slashed to goal difference over Paris Saint-Germain who defeated Toulouse 2-0 on Saturday, as both clubs ended the weekend's action with identical records of five victories and three draws. ""We gave up a stupid goal early in the match and it's the second time we've started badly,"" explained Monaco captain Eric Abidal. ""It was important to be collective and efficient and we didn't do that. Reims played well and tryed to catch us on the counter but we just weren't clinical in front of goal. ""Even when they were down to ten men, they still created chances."" Marseille are in third on 17 points with Lille and Nice in fourth and fifth respectively, just ahead of Nantes and Saint-Etienne. Promoted Nantes continued their fine start to the campaign earlier on Sunday with a display reminiscent of the style that made them eight-time champions as they defeated Rennes 3-1. The afternoon kick-off at Rennes's Stade de la Route de l'Orient produced a feisty derby that was eventually taken over by the 'Canaries' thanks to strikes from Filip Djordjevic, Serge Gakpe and an injury time clincher from Lucas Deaux. ""We had a very good first half and produced good play and created good chances,"" said their 50-year-old Armenian-Franco coach Michel Der Zakarian. ""We should have been 3-0 up at half-time because we should have had a clear penalty and after we had a black spell at the start of the second half."" His slick passing formation outwitted their hosts in midfield and which led to Djordjevic's headed opener after just 17 minutes. In front of a crowd of some 25,000, Rennes, who suffered only their second league defeat, pushed forward in search of an equaliser only to slip further behind with a brilliant Nantes second on the stroke of half-time. Togo international Gakpe, cut into the box before turning two defenders inside out and then hooking a low shot around Rennes 'keeper Benoit Costil and into the far corner. Nelson Oliveira then broke through for Rennes on 55 minutes after the ball pin-balled into his path and he made no mistake with his one-on-one duel against Nantes number one Remy Riou to pull it back to 2-1. Der Zakarian's men then had to endure a nerve shredding finale before Lucas Deaux finished off a counter-attack deep into injury time to make the scoreline 3-1. Fabrizio Ravanelli's Ajaccio side followed their first win of the season against Lyon in midweek with a hard earned 1-1 draw at home to 2012 champions Montpellier. The Corsican side went behind when Ajaccio-born midfielder Remy Cabella converted a ninth minute penalty before grabbing a share of the points with Ronald Zubar's header 10 minutes before the break."

Radamel Falcao scored twice at the Stade Louis II on Wednesday to take his season's tally to a league-best seven goals, as Monaco extended their best start to a Ligue 1 campaign. ""As a striker of course I'm always happy when I score and that was again the case in the victory against Bastia,"" said Falcao. ""For us it was important to win, thanks to the victory, we stay top,"" added the Colombian. Ranieri, though, said it was premature to cast Monaco, who only returned to the top flight this season after a two-year absence, as genuine title challengers despite their strong start. ""I think it's too early to say we've sent out a signal (to the other teams) but we continue to reaffirm our good start to the season. ""With the results we play with confidence and calmness,"" said Ranieri, who dismissed the significance of being first in the table so early in the campaign. ""The standings? The important thing is the way in which the team moves forward,"" explained the Italian. On Sunday Monaco travel to mid-table Reims who have lost just once in seven outings and conceded only one goal since mid-August. Second-placed PSG, who are in the middle of a run of five fixtures in 15 days, return to the capital on Saturday to host Toulouse. Alain Casanova's men were languishing in the bottom three a fortnight ago but back-to-back victories have catapulted Toulouse up to 11th. Meanwhile, PSG put the disappointment of Sunday's 1-1 draw with Monaco behind them as Edinson Cavani struck the decisive goal in a 1-0 win away to Valenciennes. ""We got the main thing, the three points, because there was a lot of fatigue (on Wednesday). We had a difficult match but it won't be the first, nor the last this season,"" said PSG midfielder Blaise Matuidi. ""We had to recover the two points dropped at home to Monaco, and we did that. Now we have to continue our march forward,"" added the France international. The fixture marks a return to the Parc des Princes for Clement Chantome, who left Paris in the summer to join Toulouse on loan. Despite strong ties to PSG, who are unbeaten so far this term and have not lost any of their last 18 Ligue 1 games, a confident Chantome insisted Toulouse were capable of causing a surprise this weekend. ""We should go there to play the game. PSG are a beatable team when they doubt (themselves),"" said Chantome. Marseille, who are a point behind PSG in third, visit Lorient in Saturday's early game seeking to build on Tuesday's 2-1 win over Saint-Etienne. Joint-leading scorer Andre-Pierre Gignac could return for Marseille after the burly forward was back in training on Thursday following a toe problem, while Jeremie Aliadiere may be welcomed back into the Lorient line-up after a six-week injury lay-off. Elsewhere, Lyon will seek to bounce back from a defeat to lowly Ajaccio when they host Lille, while Saint-Etienne are at home to Bastia and Rennes entertain Nantes in a local derby. Valenciennes go to Sochaux, who are without a coach following the resignation of Eric Hely, in a bottom of the table clash. Fixtures (kick-off 1800GMT unless stated)"

Claudio Ranieri's side welcome 10th-place Bastia to the Stade Louis II as part of a full programme of midweek fixtures in France, leaving Monaco just three days to recover from Sunday's trip to the capital. ""It's a very good point to pick up. It was a difficult match against an excellent Paris team,"" said Monaco midfielder Mounir Obbadi of the draw in the capital. ""Now, we have to recover very quickly because we play again (on Wednesday) against Bastia, another very difficult match,"" added the Moroccan. Monaco are one of the league's two remaining unbeaten sides, along with PSG, and 60-million-euro ($81 million) striker Radamel Falcao has adapted well to life in Ligue 1, having netted five goals in six matches, including the equaliser on Sunday. ""Both teams tried to win and had their chances. In the end it was a draw. The most important thing for us is that the result keeps us top of the standings,"" said Falcao. ""We're making strides as a team. Personally, I'm especially happy to have scored because we stay first,"" added the Colombian. PSG, who climbed a spot to second after surpassing Saint-Etienne on goal difference, travel to lowly Valenciennes, who have lost five in a row following their lone victory on the opening weekend of the season. France midfielder Blaise Matuidi praised Monaco's display on Sunday but conceded the Parisians felt they should have won and vowed that PSG would bounce back at the Stade du Hainaut. ""Monaco showed they have a good team, even if I thought we were better than them (on Sunday). We'll hope to return to winning ways with a victory at Valenciennes on Wednesday,"" said Matuidi. Despite netting a fifth-minute opener, Zlatan Ibrahimovic endured a difficult evening against Monaco, spurning several chances to add to his haul, and echoed Matuidi's sense of regret. ""We're disappointed because we should have won the match. We played at home and we had a lot of chances. We scored but made an error for their equaliser and we paid for it,"" said the Swede, whose goal was just his second of the campaign. ""This season there's more pressure on us. We're the champions and everyone wants to beat us."" Ibrahimovic's partnership with club record signing Edinson Cavani again failed to sparkle, but the former stressed the need for patience. ""My understanding with Cavani? It's coming, it's coming,"" said Ibrahimovic. PSG will be without captain Thiago Silva, who could be out for several weeks, after the Brazilian defender sustained a thigh injury at the weekend. Third-place Saint-Etienne travel to Marseille on Tuesday knowing that a victory at the Velodrome would send Christophe Galtier's side top, for 24 hours at least. However, Marseille, who are a point behind Tuesday's opponents, could also move to the summit should they win by a three-goal margin. The hosts will be without forward Andre-Pierre Gignac, though, who was ruled out for seven to 10 days with a toe problem. Elsewhere, Nice, fresh off a 4-0 thumping of Valenciennes in the opening game at their new Allianz Riviera stadium, travel to Nantes, while Lyon are away to winless Ajaccio. Evian go to Lille on Tuesday and Montpellier entertain Rennes on Thursday. Fixtures (kick-off 1700GMT unless stated)"

The draw kept Monaco in first place on 14 points, two ahead of PSG, who moved into second, ahead of Saint-Etienne on goal difference. ""It was a good match. Paris played well but so did we,"" said Monaco boss Claudio Ranieri. ""We tried to win right up until the end and I'm very satisfied. I have no regrets. ""I know that Paris have a lot of quality and more experience than our players, so I'm happy,"" the Italian continued. PSG coach Laurent Blanc made one change to the side that beat Olympiakos 4-1 midweek in the Champions League with Argentine winger Ezequiel Lavezzi replacing Lucas Moura on the left side of an attacking trio. Ranieri, meanwhile, kept faith with the team that beat Lorient 1-0 last weekend as Mounir Obbadi continued alongside Geoffrey Kondogbia in central midfield with Jeremy Toulalan still out injured. Ibrahimovic had endured a slow start to the season with just one goal prior to Sunday, but last year's leading scorer made an immediate impact at the Parc des Princes as he gave PSG a fifth-minute lead. Thiago Silva's raking downfield ball picked out the run of left-back Maxwell who crossed for Ibrahimovic to volley past Danijel Subasic from close range. The hosts were dealt a blow on the quarter-hour, though, as Silva limped off with a hamstring injury to be replaced by Zoumana Camara. Falcao then hauled Monaco level on 20 minutes as he threw himself at Joao Moutinho's teasing cross into the box, the Colombian bravely putting his body on the line to head beyond Salvatore Sirigu. Monaco's Yannick Ferreira Carrasco fired just over on the volley shortly after, while Edinson Cavani dragged a shot wide of the far post after clever interplay between himself and Ibrahimovic. The Swede then wasted a glorious chance to add to his tally and restore PSG's advantage as he headed over after being left completely unmarked as Lavezzi swung in a dangerous free-kick. And Ibrahimovic was again guilty of botching another opening just moments later. Played through by Marco Verratti, the striker elected to cut back onto his right foot and, rather than shooting, over hit a chip towards the far post as he tried to pick out an advancing Lavezzi. There was further frustration for Ibrahimovic after the interval as he flicked a low cross from Lavezzi the wrong side of the post. Ferreira Carrasco volleyed wide when well placed, while substitute James Rodriguez and Layvin Kurzawa took turns to test Sirigu from distance but the contest began to peter out as the second half wore on. However, Cavani twice very nearly snatched all three points for PSG in stoppage time. The Uruguayan was firstly denied by a fantastic sliding intervention from Andrea Raggi after he chested down Blaise Matuidi's lofted pass and shot on the turn before he sent a header narrowly wide of the near post as Monaco withstood a late threat. ""We played a very good match, unfortunately we weren't able to get that decisive goal,"" said PSG midfielder Blaise Matuidi. ""We put them in difficulty, we had the chances but we failed to take them. We can be happy with the performance we produced, (it was) one of the best of the season.""

But Lyon, winners of seven consecutive Ligue 1 crowns between 2002 and 2008, replied through Bafetimbi Gomis three minutes later as the striker ran onto Jimmy Briand's flick-on before lifting the ball over goalkeeper Remy Riou. Set-piece specialist Clement Grenier then demonstrated his prowess as he dispatched a superb free-kick beyond Riou to put Lyon ahead 10 minutes after half-time.

It was enough to move Saint-Etienne a point above Paris Saint-Germain at the top of Ligue 1 following the champions' 2-0 win at Bordeaux on Friday. Big-spending Monaco could go back to the summit if they win at home to Lorient on Sunday. New Turkish attacking signing Mevlut Erding, formerly of PSG, may have drawn a blank but his supporting act stepped up to the mark in fine style. Corgnet slotted into an empty net on 17 minutes after home goalkeeper Nicolas Penneteau had denied Hamouma. The latter then doubled the advantage on 47 minutes, beating Penneteau with a fine strike from 20 yards. Corgnet wrapped up the victory with a shot through Penneteau's legs from Hamouma's cross six minutes later. Valenciennes' sole response came from a generously-awarded penalty when the referee gave handball against Bayal Sall. Midfielder Corgnet said it was his positioning further forward, behind the front man, that had made the difference. ""That's two matches now that I've played in the hole (behind the striker), my favourite role,"" he said. ""We've been playing better these last two matches and it's a pleasure to be a part of this team."" Earlier, former European champions Marseille had needed a late goal from Brazilian defender Lucas Mendes to snatch a point against the team that began the day bottom of the league.

""We had some good periods, especially in the first half, some real quality moves, well co-ordinated, but we didn't turn them into goals,"" said Marseille coach Elie Baup. Marseille created, and squandered, several opportunities, including a shocking miss by Dimitri Payet, who failed to find the net while goalkeeper Ali Ahamada lay helpless on the ground. Ahamada then made an important save to deny France winger Mathieu Valbuena before Toulouse took a shock lead as Wissam Ben Yedder slotted home a pass from Dane, Martin Braithwaite. It would have been enough to secure a first win of the season but Mendes headed home a Valbuena free-kick three minutes from time to earn a point. Even so, Baup's team will need to up their game considerably if they are to gain anything at home to Arsenal in the Champions League in midweek. ""we will have to go looking to make things happen with mental strength, we will have to work hard because our team depends on a lot of collectivity,"" said Baup. On Friday, France midfielder Blaise Matuidi put PSG ahead from a precise Zlatan Ibrahimovic pass before Brazilian winger Lucas Moura sealed the victory for Laurent Blanc's team in the second half. It was a dominant performance from the champions against woeful opponents as PSG demonstrated they are starting to find their feet under Carlo Ancelotti's replacement. Sochaux dropped to the bottom of the table following a 1-0 defeat at Nantes, who moved up to sixth.

However, Ezequiel Lavezzi got what proved to be the winner in the 74th minute, firing home the loose ball after a Lucas effort had been blocked on the line by Gabriel Cichero. With his choice of a 4-4-2 formation coming in for some criticism after the defending champions were held by Montpellier and then Ajaccio in their opening two games, PSG coach Laurent Blanc opted for a three-man attack here, with Lavezzi brought back in alongside Cavani and Zlatan Ibrahimovic. ""We could go back to the 4-4-2 but also (try out) other systems. We need to find a system which gives us balance,"" said Blanc. ""We have an attacking potential that many other clubs envy but we mustn't forget that to win a match we have to defend well."" Even against a five-man Nantes defence, PSG threatened to run riot in the early stages, with home goalkeeper Remy Riou racing off his line to deny Ibrahimovic before Cavani's first-time half-volley flashed just wide midway through the first half. Shortly after, Ibrahimovic and Cavani combined for the opening goal, with the latter racing on to the Swede's pass before firing low past Riou. Yet the visitors could not build on that and only a fine Salvatore Sirigu save prevented Cichero from equalising for Nantes from an overhead kick just before the break. The hosts did draw level soon after the restart when the unfortunate Alex, under pressure from Papy Djilobodji, saw a Jordan Veretout free-kick rebound off him and into the net at the back post. Sirigu then had to save well to keep out a net-bound Alejandro Bedoya header, but PSG silenced the 37,000 crowd when Lavezzi scored what proved to be the winner. Earlier on an attritional weekend in France's top flight, Nice were held to a goalless draw by Ajaccio in Corsica, while Saint-Etienne dropped their first points of the league campaign, going down 1-0 away to a young Lille side. Salomon Kalou scored the only goal from the penalty spot to deny Les Verts the chance to move level at the top of the table with leaders Marseille. ""Saint-Etienne are a team who often pose us problems,"" acknowledged Kalou, mindful that it was they who pipped Lille to a European place at the end of last season, having also knocked them out of both domestic cup competitions. Marseille end the weekend two points clear of Monaco at the summit after maintaining their perfect start to the season with a hard-fought 1-0 win at Valenciennes, Andre-Pierre Gignac netting a late winner. Monaco drew 0-0 at home to Toulouse on Friday in a game played behind closed doors at the Stade Louis II as a punishment for crowd trouble at the end of last season. Claudio Ranieri's side now travel to face Marseille in a top-of-the-table clash at the Stade Velodrome next Sunday. In contrast to Marseille, Lyon's perfect start to the campaign was ended in a 1-0 home defeat to Reims, as Odair Fortes's deflected effort gave the visitors the points after Clement Grenier had missed a penalty for the hosts in a second half delayed for 35 minutes because of torrential rain at the Stade de Gerland. That result came four days after Lyon's chances of making the Champions League group stage were severely compromised by a 2-0 home defeat to Real Sociedad in the first leg of their play-off."

Gignac turned in the loose ball with just five minutes remaining after Valenciennes goalkeeper Nicolas Penneteau had failed to hold Andre Ayew's header on Saturday afternoon.

Reims then twisted the knife by snatching all three points when Odair Fortes' cross from the left deflected off Milan Bisevac and looped into the net. ""It is very tough to come away with nothing. A draw would have been fairer,"" said Garde. ""We just lacked a little bit of luck in the second half, everyone could see that. We were much the better side, and Reims scored with their only shot of the second period. ""We need to grin and bear it and keep working. The better days will return.""

On the pitch, sixty-million euro signing Radamel Falcao is off to an impressive start with two goals in two games since his move from Atletico Madrid. The Colombian celebrated the birth of his new daughter on the eve of his strike against Montpellier last Sunday which helped spark a 4-1 rout of the 2012 champions.

At the Velodrome, French international Andre-Pierre Gignac inspired Marseille to a 2-0 defeat of Evian with a brilliant opener on 16 minutes before the home side then made the points safe with 23 minutes left when Dimitri Payet pounced on a rebound for his third goal of the young season. ""The numbers speak for themselves,"" said delighted Marseille coach Elie Baup. ""We've got six points, scored five and conceded one so we've got our season off to a very good start."" Saint-Etienne, who picked up their first silverware last season since winning the league in 1981 title when they won the League Cup, continued where they left off with a deserved 1-0 win over promoted yet pointless Guingamp. The only goal of the match was a flowing move on 52 minutes that was superbly finished off by Fabian Lemoine after a one-two on the edge of the box. Bordeaux gave themselves a hard nights' work when defender Marc Planus was shown a straight red card after just 28 minutes for a shocking tackle on Israeli international Eden Ben Basat but managed to escape with a 1-1 draw at Toulouse. The visitors, who last won the title under current PSG coach Laurent Blanc in 2009, took the lead just before half-time when Malian international Cheick Diabate broke the offside trap and beat Toulouse keeper Ali Ahamada with a close range finish. The lead lasted just two minutes however as Toulouse equalised through Ben Basat who shook off an earlier disallowed goal and blasted home a loose ball after a mixup in the Bordeaux defence. Europa League hopefuls Nice bounced back from their 4-0 thrashing at Lyon last weekend with a 2-1 win over Rennes as they got off to a bright start with a 20th minute opener from Argentine Dario Cvitanic against Rennes. Rennes got the perfect tonic before half-time when Nelson Oliveira scored in the dying seconds of the opening 45 minutes before a defensive howler put Nice back in front. An unforgivable mistake from Nigerian Ejike Uzoenyi - who was last man back - handed the ball on a plate to Jeremy Pied who calmly slotted in past astonished Rennes 'keeper Benoit Costil for three priceless points. Bastia were also the benificiaries of poor defending as they notched up their first points of the season with a 2-0 win over Valenciennes thanks to a Gianni Bruno tap-in with 14 minutes left before a powerful header from Adama Ba three minutes later carried the Corsicans home. Elsewhere, Reims handed new Lille coach Rene Girard his first defeat since moving from Montpellier where he won the 2012 title as they ran out 2-1 winners just outside Paris.

But awash with cash from their Qatari owners the capital club, touting a budget of 400 million euros, are hot favourites to repeat their success, even if newly-promoted fellow moneybags outfit Monaco will look to push them hard. Falcao, a 60-million-euro acquisition from Atletico Madrid, is the big draw for the Monegasques, bankrolled by Russian billionaire owner Dimitri Rybolovlev. But the principality club must begin the season with a two-point deduction after a series of incidents at the end of a game last season. Montpellier represented a tough opening day test for the Parisians given the southerners' status as 2012 champions though they saw the architect of that win, Rene Girard, switch to Lille in the summer, with Jean Fernandez arriving to replace him. PSG, now under the stewardship of former France and Bordeaux coach Laurent Blanc, elected to start with a strike tandem of Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Ezequiel Lavezzi, leaving 64 million-euro new boy Edinson Cavani on the bench to begin with at the Stade de la Mosson. ""We expected a better result,"" admitted Blanc. ""But we created too little for my taste and made too many mistakes which allowed Montpellier to score."" Fernandez believed the game could have been wrapped up in the first 45 minutes. ""We could have won the game in the first half. If we had been a little more clear-headed, we could have created more chances. But then we suffered in the second half,"" he said. But after an early Lavezzi header flashed off target it was the hosts who scored the opening goal of the new season, a rasping drive from Remy Cabella after just ten minutes. Cabella robbed Ibrahimovic and then found Emanuel Herrera, who fired in an effort which was blocked only for Cabella to drive in at the second attempt. Though enjoying the lion's share of the possession PSG were forced to grind through the gears as they strove to respond and Ibrahimovic sent in a fizzing effort which Geoffrey Jourdren in the home goal tipped away. A goal to the good at the break, Montpellier could have doubled their lead on 50 minutes but Herrera fired over from the edge of the area. And PSG finally managed to get back on terms on the hour mark through Brazilian Maxwell. Javier Pastore fired over a cross form the left which Ibrahimovic just reached at the far post, nodding on for former Barcelona defender Maxwell to net from close range. Montpellier had a nervous final 18 minutes after their Moroccan defender Abdelhamid El Kaoutari was red carded for a foul on Pastore.
